["Q: How to access Windows 10 PC from Ubuntu 14.04 using Remote Acess Client like Remmina I have a laptop with Ubuntu 14.04LTS and my friend has Laptop with Windows 10. How should I configure both these laptop so that I can access Windows desktop from my Ubuntu? Specifically how should I configure Windows so that it can be accessible from Ubuntu and vice-versa?\n\nA: I also was initially unable to connect to Windows 10 from Linux, but found a change to the Windows configuration and a reboot fixed it. There are actually several potential clients. You'll probably like remmina since it's friendly and GUI based, but I prefer the scripting friendly command line based xfreerdp because I can set it to reconnect as I prefer and include my credentials. Here's the command I use:\nxfreerdp /u:'myusername@mydomain.com' /p:'mypassword' /sound:sys:alsa /size:1900x1050 /cert-ignore ignore certificate /v:192.168.0.1\n\nSee: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2287213\nWith reference to: https://cyberarms.net/security-insig...e-desktop.aspx\nI changed the registry key\n\\HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp SecurityLayer\n\nfrom DWORD Hex '2' to a value of '1'\nThis reduces the security resilience of the windows machine but allows older software to remote in.\n\nA: You can use Remote Desktop connection which is a feature in windows 10 and will let you connect to a computer which is on the same Network as yours, if you want to access his computer through the internet you would need to set up a VPN. You can also use a software like Hamachi to simulate a virtual network between you and your friend which is a very easy to configure and use. \nTo connect to the Windows machine you can use remmina. To connect from your windows machine to the Ubuntu machine you can use SSH or if you want a Graphical interface, VNC can be used.\nYou would first need to Enable Windows Remote desktop on the windows 10 PC. If you're on the same network as the PC, open remmina and choose the RDP protocol. Input the WIndows 10 IP and you should be able to connect. If you're trying this over the internet then you would need to setup a VPN like i said previously, which can be easily done with Hamachi.\n\nA: I accomplished this by installing tightVNC on the Windows computer and connecting with remmina.  You must open a port in the router to allow incoming connections to tightVNC.  The particulars are spelled out in the tightVNC documentation, not elaborating here since it's Windows.\nYou can then connect through remmina using the VNC protocol. \nI cannot answer the Windows->Linux part of the question.  Although I could speculate that if you run vino on your Linux machine and open the appropriate port, your friend could connect with tightVNC.\n", "Q: Remove gnome from Xubuntu I tried out Gnome-shell on Xubuntu 15.10 by installing the meta-package \"gnome\". I didn't like it much, so I want to remove it again.\nI tried apt-get purge gnome && apt-get autoremove, but unfortunately I got an error on boot, so I decided to reinstall gnome. Everything works fine, but I'd like to get rid of gnome again.\n\nA: Test this:\nSwitch on your computer.\nPress and hold the Shift key, which will bring up the Grub menu.\nSelect the line which starts with Advanced options.\nSelect the line ending with (recovery mode)\nPress Return and your machine will begin the boot process.\nYour computer should display a menu with a number of options. \nOne of the options will be Enable networking.

It's supposed to work on a Raspbian. So the main part has to be delt with in a screen session. Or else the user would have to keep the ssh connection active all the time.\nIt's also supposed to get it's input from a textfile containing multiple entries like:\nhttp://youtube.com/BlaBla video ~/Videos\nhttp://vlc-project.org/downloads/BlaBla file ~/Downloads\nBlaBla.torrent torrent ~/Downloads\n\nSo the codeblock would be something like:\nwhile read -r line; do\n  # Code for simple file\n  # Code for Video\n  # Code for torrent\ndone < \"$inputFile\"\n\nHow do I execute the entire while loop in a screen session? Is this even possible?\nGreetings and thanks in advance\nMarkus\n\nA: Screen man page mentions the following syntax:\n\nscreen [ -options ] [ cmd [ args ] ]\n\nAnd this:\n\nIn addition, new windows can be created by running a command like:\n          screen emacs prog.c\n\nfrom  a  shell prompt within a previously created window.  This will not run another copy of screen, but will\n         instead supply the command name and its arguments to the window manager (specified in  the  $STY  environment\n         variable)  who will use it to create the new window\n\nSo put your codeblock into a script , and launch from a terminal it like so \nscreen myScript.sh\n\n", "Q: Where is \"Settings\" information stored? When I tweak a setting in the Settings menu in Ubuntu, where is that information stored? For example if I add a custom keyboard shortcut, or set my default display, where does is this information later retrieved from by the OS? I am sure it ends up in a text file somewhere, but I haven't found it yet (probably because I am not quite sure where to look). \nUpdate:\nWOW! All the answers below so far have been super helpful! My question was perhaps a little too general, and ideally I would accept all answers as correct because they all provide very useful tools for finding useful config (or other) information. \nI am accepting @A.B.'s answer, because dconf watch / scratched my particular itch perfectly. However, I would direct future readers to @serg's answer for it's detail, and @DK Bose's answer for its general usefulness. I would also suggest anyone with a similar question to experiment with all the suggested commands as I will be doing!\n\nA: There are many possible places:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your config folder ~/.config. Watch with\ninotifywatch -e modify,create,delete -r ~/.config\n\n\n*The dot files direct to your home folder. Watch, e.g. your .mozilla folder with \ninotifywatch -e modify,create,delete -r ~/.mozilla\n\n\n*The files in your local folder ~/.local. Watch with \ninotifywatch -e modify,create,delete -r ~/.local\n\n\n*The dconf database, watch with\ndconf watch /\n\nand make some changes to check it ...\n\nA: One possible general approach is this. Close all other programs except the one you're going to tweak. Make your tweak. Then, immediately run something like this:\nfind ~/ -mmin -1 -type f -ls\n\nYou may see some hits you may decide aren't relevant. find allows you to eliminate them:\nfind ~/ ! -path \"*mozilla*\" ! -path \"*google-chrome*\" ! -path \"*cache*\" ! -path \"*dropbox*\" -mmin -1 -type f -ls\n\nYou can add or delete paths, depending on your needs.\nAs an example, I'll change a setting of a text editor, Mousepad, and then run the long version.\n$ find ~/ ! -path \"*mozilla*\" ! -path \"*google-chrome*\" ! -path \"*cache*\" ! -path \"*dropbox*\" -mmin -1 -type f -ls  \n7735309   12 -rw-r--r--   1 dkb    dkb       10948 Oct 29 10:56 /home/dkb/.config/Mousepad/accels.scm  \n7734498    4 -rw-rw-r--   1 dkb    dkb        1397 Oct 29 10:56 /home/dkb/.config/Mousepad/mousepadrc  \n7209188  240 -rw-------   1 dkb    dkb      242407 Oct 29 10:56 /home/dkb/.local/share/recently-used.xbel  \n$ \n\n(The last hit mostly isn't useful.)\n\nA: Where Settings menu information is stored depends on some of the items. Such things as desktop background, themes, language, and keyboard shortcuts ( including custom ones ) - those all go into dconf schemas, while such things as Display settings and Network settings have to interface with xrandr and network-manager programs respectively. \nFor instance, in the settings menu I have a custom shortcut PAGE-DOWN. If I do dconf dump / | grep -C 5 PAGE Appropriately enough, I will see the following entry:\n[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom7]\nbinding='<Alt>period'\ncommand='bash -c \"xdotool getactivewindow key Page_Down\"'\nname='PAGE-DOWN'\n\nSame thing for Power settings , it's in dconf:\n[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power]\nidle-dim=false\nlid-close-battery-action='nothing'\nlid-close-ac-action='nothing'\n\nTheme:\n$ dconf dump / | grep  theme                                       \ncursor-theme='crystalblue_classic'\nicon-theme='Deepin-2013'\ngtk-theme='Numix'\ntheme='Numix'\n\nAs far as positioning the screen goes, you can do it through Settings -> Display menu or use xrandr , for example something like \nxrandr --output VGA1 --auto --output HDMI1 --auto --right-of VGA1\n\n(Example from  Arch Wiki)\nEven more manual way, is to alter .config/monitors.xml file, which is what xrandr does.\nBut above all of them governs gnome-settings-daemon if you have Gnome shell or unity-settings-daemon if you have Unity ( default desktop ). Knowing that, I've used dconf, gconf and xrandr in numerous scripts on this site to adjust desktop functionality, and used gnome-settings-daemon to simplify behavior of openbox environment. Bellow are some of the examples,\nAssign default keyboard language per-application ( uses gsettings)\nHow to permanently set my second screen's resolution?(uses xrandr )\n", "Q: Can't login to my Ubuntu 14.04 after system update When I try to log it shows the desktop background then shows a black screen and then It takes me back to the log in screen...\nI can't even log in as guest, I tried with Ctrl + alt + F1 and I can log in from terminal. I did some of research and tried solutions like:\nsudo chmod -R ug+rwx /home/[username]\nchown -R [user-name]:[user-name] /home/[user-name]\nsudo mv .Xauthority .XauthorityBak\nTried also installing sudo apt-get install ubuntu-session \nWell but none of them worked, what else can I do?\n\nA: You can get into console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nYou can login there and install or remove drivers.\nIf your video adapter is new, run\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall fglrx-updates\n\nThat will install AMD drivers.\nYou can remove them by \nsudo apt-get purge 'fglrx.*'\n\n", "Q: How to install bootloader on usb-stick after failure? When you write iso to usb-stick in the end it asks you password in order to install bootloader. But if you enter wrong password (it seems 2 times) or leave computer for some time then writing process stops. How can I install bootloader after this failure.\n\nA: Sounds like you're using the \"Startup Disc Creator\".  Try using unetbootin instead, it's in the repositories.  If it asks you about overwriting a file just click \"Yes to All\".  I've historically had more luck out of Unetbootin than the \"Startup Disc Creator\".\n", "Q: Iterate over files in directory, create folders based on file names and move files into respective folders I would like to move files in a directory into folders with the same names.  I would like to do all this using the command line or a bash script\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor  f in $1; do\n  mv \"$f\".* <not sure what do do>\ndone\n\nHow can I grab the names of the files and create the folders?\n\nA: As I understand it, you intend to supply a directory name as the first argument of the shell script.  Files in that directory are to be moved into subdirectories of that directory whose names are the same as the files but with extensions omitted.  In that case:\n#!/bin/bash    \nfor f in \"$1\"/*\ndo\n    [ -d \"$f\" ] && continue\n    base=${f%.*}\n    mkdir -p \"$base\"\n    mv \"$f\" \"$base/\"\ndone\n\nHow it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*[ -d \"$f\" ] && continue\nTo avoid recursion, this skips subdirectories of $1.\n\n*base=${f%.*} \nThis assigns to shell variable base the name of $f with its extension removed.  This is an example of suffix removal.\n\n*mkdir -p \"$base\"\nThis makes sure that the directory $base exists.\n\n*mv \"$f\" \"$base/\"\nThis moves the file to the directory.\n\nA: Answer under construction, please be patient :)\nHow this works\nCreate a file named makeDirs.sh, copy over the script bellow into the file, save, and make script executable with chmod +x /path/to/makeDirs.sh\nREMEMBER TO HAVE BACKUPS BEFORE RUNNING ANY SCRIPT\nCall the script with directory on which you want to operate as command line argument.

I'm trying to use iptables on my newly purchased openvz container.

Was the NTFS drive in hibernation? Did it suffer a power cut?\nPart of the man page of ntfsfix reads as follows:\nntfsfix is a utility that fixes some common NTFS problems.\nntfsfix is NOT a Linux version of chkdsk. It only repairs some\nfundamental NTFS inconsistencies, resets the NTFS journal file and\nschedules an NTFS consistency check for the first boot into Windows.\n\nYou may run ntfsfix on an NTFS volume if you think it was damaged by\nWindows or some other way and it cannot be mounted.\n\nTry this:\nntfsfix /path/to/ntfsdevice\nIn your case it would be:\nntfsfix /dev/sda2\nWhere /dev/sda2 is the NTFS partition with the issue. ntfsfix has some useful options like:\nntfsfix -b /dev/sda2\nThe -b options does the following: Clear the list of bad sectors. This is useful after cloning an old disk with bad sectors to a new disk.\nOr:\nntfsfix -d /dev/sda2\nThe -d option does the following:\nClear the volume dirty flag if the volume can be fixed and mounted.\nIf the option is not present or the volume cannot be  fixed the dirty\nvolume flag is set to request a volume checking at next mount.\n\nHope this helps.

People said that emulating it will make it much smoother. I emulated steam, downloaded CS, installed a version of Direct X whilst launching as it made me do so (I knew it was not going to end well) and the game instantly crashed. Then my res was changed for some reason and I had to restart my PC in order to do anything. \nThis might sound vague, but I really don't know what the problem is. Any insight would be appreciated.\n\nA: I experienced a similar problem with doom3 compiled from source.  I found on a forum that killing pulseaudio solved the problem.  It might be the same problem.  Try killing pulse and seeing if that solves your problem.  CS can run natively, so it should use ALSA if nothing else is available.  \nBe careful with killing pulse though.  At one point, it put my sound card in an inconsistent state, and it didn't work at all for a while.  I don't remember how I fixed it.\n\nA: If you are using Global Offensive, it is now available by Steam for Linux platform too. Just check it.\nI use Steam on Linux and play \"Counter Strike Global Offensive\" without using wine or any other emulater.\nBonus : You can now play many other games on Linux without using any emulator.

(Ubuntu 14.04.3) I created a live system using Systemback in \"computer A\" and installed it with no problems in \"computer B\" but the only annoyance is that HAL gave my network interface cards the names eth1 to the Wired Interface and wlan2 to the Wireless Interface in \"computer B\". I have a lot of scripts and aliases hardcoded (BAD PRACTICE, I know).\nSystemback created an exact copy of my configuration in \"computer A\" so this is why in \"computer B\" It couldn't hand out eth0 and wlan0 because these two names were already in use.\nI know how to and can easily replace the problematic text with sed in all the scripts and aliases but i'd like to know how can I change these names given by HAL.\n\nA: Here's what happened: when you did the original setup on System A, your machine reserved the names eth0 and wlan0 for the particular devices you had in that machine.\nWhen you moved to System B, the new network devices were found, and (as you mention) renamed to not conflict with those earlier definitions of eth0 and wlan0.\nThat original mapping of names is kept in:\n/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\n\nIf you delete that file, your next boot will start up with no \"reserved\" names for those network devices in System A, and you'll get eth0 and wlan0 back.\nIf they're discovered in a different order (say, if you had two ethX devices in System B, and you expect them in a different order), you can edit the NAME= defintions in that file to suit your own naming requirements.\n", "Q: Google Chrome not retaining default browser selection in Ubuntu 15.10 Google Chrome is set being my default browser in System Settings, Details.

I have looked around but only found discontinued projects. What audio equalizers are able to be used in 15.10.\n\nA: There are 2 PulseAudio EQs I know of: qpaeq and pulseaudio-equalizer (ladspa-sink).\nThe issue I ran into with PulseAudio EQs is that they tend to introduce audio latency and crackling/popping sounds when starting/quitting applications on my hardware (Xonar DX).\nThe best solution I came up with is to use the JACK audio server that is used for professional audio production on Linux and put that between PulseAudio and ALSA (the hardware connection). This allows for various EQ modules to be applied on a low-latency basis while still keeping the PulseAudio interface for your applications, so you don't have to adjust them in any way.\nIt is a rather non-invasive approach; you can give it a try using my guide here: https://github.com/M4he/Linux/tree/master/JACK/PA_through_JACK\n\nA: The PulseAudio-Equalizer is the best for Unity and Gnome desktop environment. It has 15-band Graphic Equalizer with many presets available and it's completly integrated with Audio-Indicator on system tray of Ubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf and also with VLC media player and Popcorn Time.\nTo install, just follow the steps below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio-equalizer\n\n", "Q: Gnome 3.18 Activities overview and application list very slow with Ubuntu 15.10 Ok, any help would be great: \nAfter updating to 15.10 and Gnome 3.18, the activities overview has become very unresponsive.

Just about everything I can come up with, but nothing makes a difference. When going back to 3.16 the overview seems to work normally, but a reinstall of 3.18 takes things back to a slideshow. \nNothing seems to be taking up cpu time, memory isn't the issue, and hardware should not be a problem (i7 4770, GTX970, 16GB, 120GB ssd for home and root). \nThe only strange thing I'm spotting, is that the NVIDIA X server settings application reports my GPU's performance level at level 3 (max) almost all the time even without any load, even though it should be set to adaptive mode. \n\nA: I was experiencing the same issue. What worked for me was:\n1) Activities > Settings > Search\n2) Turn off all the stuff that you don't need to search\nIn my case, I was able to mitigate the problem quite a lot because I only use the search to launch applications quickly, hence I turned off most of the stuff. I imagine that searching for files, documents and photos causes the most slowdown. I hope this works for you too.\n", "Q: How can I configure the buttons on a Corsair gaming mouse? I bought a Corsair M95 mouse which I have used on my computer with Ubuntu Studio & Xubuntu 14.04, 15.04, and 15.10. It works out-of-the-box as a standard mouse, plus a button to slow down the cursor, but I haven't been able to fully utilize the extra buttons.\nFirefox and some Thunar file manager recognize two of the buttons for forward/back. These seem to be the only programs I use that recognize anything.\nThe key-bindings settings in Team Fortress 2 recognizes the 3 standard mouse buttons as it should. But the rest of them are all recognized by the title \"mouse4\" as if they were all the same button (in Ubuntu 15.10, 2 of them are recognized as \"mouse5\").  \nIf I use the Corsair program on Windows, then I can assign the mouse buttons to keys on my keyboard. It fortunately stores the profiles on the mouse; but I can't reconfigure them on Linux.  I would much prefer to have them recognized by my games (and even productive programs), so I can bind the mouse buttons in the settings for each game/program.\nIt appears that xinput recognizes it as 3 devices.

However, there are a couple of work arounds. Although it's important to note that I haven't tested these solutions myself. In addition, my M95 doesn't use the config that's on it when I'm on Linux, but it works on Windows.\n1: Windows VM\nYou could use VirtualBox and a Windows virtual machine to configure the mouse. Not ideal, but it works.\nNote: A second mouse is recommended.\nSetup\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a Windows VirtualBox VM for IE and Edge development from Microsoft. These expire after 90 days, so remember to make a snapshot of the VM after you install the driver software.\n\n*While that's downloading, install VirtualBox:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\n*Add your user to the \"vboxusers\" group (very important):\nsudo useradd -G vboxusers username\n\n*Log out, and back in for this to take effect (also very important).\n\n*Open the virtual machine.\n\n*Install the Guest Additions in the VM.\n\n*Install the M95 driver software.\n\n*Make a snapshot of the VM.\n\n*You are now done with setting up the VM.\n\n\nModifying Mouse Configs\nNote: You will probably want to have a second mouse on hand.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the VM, if you haven't already.\n\n*In the VirtualBox tool bar, go to Devices > USB Devices > Corsair M95 Gaming Mouse. This will disable your mouse outside of the virtual machine. If you get stuck: Host + H to do a safe shutdown, Host + Q to force the VM to quit. (Host = RightCtrl by default.)\n\n*In the M95 driver software, make your changes and save them.\n\n*Export the config files and transfer them to the host for less headache later.\n\n*Exit the VM in however way you like.\n\n*All done!\n\n\n2: Use Windows\nAlternatively, you could just boot into Windows and make your changes there.\n", "Q: 14.04 - DUC doesn't update correctly the IP with VPN at startup I'm running an Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS server that launches a few things at startup, two of them being OpenVPN for my VPN service and a Dynamic DNS Update Client to update my noip host to my current IP.\nI've tried with the official noip DUC and with ddclient (see here why I changed) and both of them incorrectly update to the IP I have before my VPN connects (the ISP IP).\nThe OpenVPN connection is working when I login via SSH, so it means the DUC reports the IP before OpenVPN is working or something like that. Before asking here, I've tried to modify the init.d script of ddclient with an openvpn requirement :\n# Required-Start:    $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog $openvpn\n\nFor rcX.d files, openvpn has something like S16openvpn and ddclient has S99ddclient, so normally ddclient starts after openvpn right ? I'm not really comfortable with those things.\nThat didn't change anything. I hope someone can help me, it means each time I reboot my server, I have to restart the DUC client service for my noip host to work correctly.\nA plan B if nothing can be found is to ask service ddclient to restart after everything has launched, so that I don't have to do it and I won't forget. But of course making ddclient update to the right IP in the first place would be better.\nP.S. : If you ask why I want the IP to be the VPN IP, it's because some services like Teamspeak 3 server have to be reachable so my ddns.net must point to the VPN IP, because when pointing to my ISP public IP, they are not reachable anymore (linked to how VPN works I guess).\n\nA: So, I've learned that OpenVPN provides a way to start a script after the tunnel is created. For that, in my file /etc/openvpn/toto.conf, I added the line\n# run /etc/openvpn/titi.sh when the connection is set up\nup /etc/openvpn/titi.sh\n\nNote that the parameter script-security in the conf file must be correctly set (at least script-security 2, see man of openvpn).\nHere is the content of my script titi.sh :\n#!/bin/bash\n(sleep 60 && ddclient -daemon=0 -debug -verbose -noquiet -force >> launch_dd.log) &\n\nFirst script didn't have the sleep 60, but strangely when the script was called and ddclient launched, my IP was still my ISP IP and not the VPN IP, even if it was launched with the OpenVPN up parameter. That's maybe why it was not working in the first place.\nSo I simply told the script to wait 60 seconds before launching. Now my IP is set to the VPN IP when I reboot the server.\n", "Q: Do you have available complete guide on installation and administration of FTP Server?

Hope this helps. Do not hesitate to ask if another doubt comes up!\nUPDATE 0: In the .vimrc file, line comments are made by adding a double quote \" to the left of the text, this means that everything to the right of the \" is a comment; multiline comments can't be made in the .vimrc file except adding a \" to the beginning of each line, thus resulting in multiple single-line comment unlike C or PHP where you can use these opening-multiline-comment /* and closing-multiline-comment */ . I don't know if it's still out there but there was a plugin called \"The NERD plugin\" or \"The NERD Commenter\" in vim. Hope this helps!\nUPDATE 1: With regards to the double \"double quotes\" and single \"double quotes\", for example the first lines in your .vimrc file:\n\n\" Better copy & paste\n\" When you want to paste large blocks of code into vim, press F2 before you\n\" paste. At the bottom you should see -- INSERT (paste) --.\n\"\" set pastetoggle=\n\"\" set clipboard=unnamed\n\nPlease note at the start of each line there's a bolded double quote like this \" this means that every single text character in that line starting immediately to the right of it is a comment.\nNow, notice the last two lines where there are double \"double quotes\" at the beginning of those lines. The first character in the line is a bolded double quote like this \" and the second character in the line is an Italic double quote like this \". Again, as explained above, this means that every single text character in that line starting immediately to the right of it is a comment. Now the second \"double quote\" is part of the comment, you could even add 3 or more double quotes, because when a line has the double quote character everything to the right will be interpreted as a comment. This is just for the programmers or users to detect faster where is the working code and where are the plain comments, a visual reference. Hope this helps.

Information about the changes in how Lightning is treated post-Thunderbird-60 is a little thin on the ground.\nBackground\n\n\n*\n\n*it cannot be installed through the add-on system\n\n*it doesn’t magically appear by removing the old add-on and restarting, which people in Mozilla support forums suggest as a solution (possibly because how it’s packaged in Ubuntu hasn’t caught up with the change yet)\n\n*it can be installed through a package (xul-ext-lightning) as described by A.B. but the interface will be in English, not your chosen Thunderbird language\n\n\nHaving done a fresh Irish language install of Ubuntu when 18.04 arrived, I did have both Thunderbird and Lightning (installed through add-on system) in Irish until one day Lightning was somehow auto-updated to version 60 even though Thunderbird was still on 57(?!). It stopped working at that point. I eventually removed the Lightning add-on and found the system package which reinstalled Lightning, but in English.\nSolution\nI’d seen suggestions that the Thunderbird people wanted you to download it as a standalone, so I thought I’d try that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded localised Thunderbird\n\n*Extracted under ~/bin\n\n*Ran it from a file manager — Lightning is bundled and localised!\n\n*Ran system version of Thunderbird — Lightning is localised!\n\n*Deleted downloaded Thunderbird and ran system version — Lightning still localised!\n\n\nI’m guessing this has changed a config file somewhere.\nYou could also remove the system version and use the downloaded version instead, but I’m unsure of how updates are handled (if at all). Once again, on Mozilla support people will say that it is updated automatically, but I’m not sure there’s much experience of Linux there.\n\nA: You can do it the easy way by going to the link below:\nhttps://thingsthemselves.com/localized-lightning-for-thunderbird-60-on-linux/\nAnd downloadning and installing the corresponding .xpi extension for your Thunderbird version. Worked nicely for me.\nEDIT: now including the main parts of the article so people can follow instructions, as requested.\nDownload the Linux (or Linux 64-bit, either one will work) version of Thunderbird for your language from the Thunderbird site. This should be a .tar.bz2 archive.\nNote: Specific versions of Lightning are paired with specific versions of Thunderbird. If you are not using the latest version of Thunderbird (60.2.1 at the time of this writing), you can download the release package for your version at Mozilla’s archive site.\nExpand the .tar.bz2 archive, and in the thunderbird/distribution/extensions directory, you will find the .xpi package for the Lightning extension ({e2fda1a4-762b-4020-b5ad-a41df1933103}.xpi).\nDownload Lightning from (...) Dropbox shared folder\nIn the interest of saving time, (...) select the version of Thunderbird you are using, then download Lightning for your locale: (N.B.: due to URL limits, I put here only the three last ones from the list)\nThunderbird 60.8.0 – Lightning 6.2.8\nThunderbird 60.9.0 – Lightning 6.2.9\nThunderbird 68.0 – Lightning 68.0\nStaying updated\nUnfortunately, installing Lightning this way means automatic updates do not work.

I have tried restarting gnome-terminal and my machine, but the setting is sticking.\nInformation Update:\nThere is a menu bar, but Read-only mode is unselected there and selecting and then unselecting it again makes no difference. The Terminal is still read-only...\n\nOS Information:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.10\nRelease:    15.10\nCodename:   wily\nFlavour: GNOME\nGNOME Version: 3.18\n\nPackage Information:\ngnome-terminal:\n  Installed: 3.16.2-1ubuntu4\n  Candidate: 3.16.2-1ubuntu4\n  Version table:\n *** 3.16.2-1ubuntu4 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ wily/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n\nA: As I could not find the read-only settings in a config file or in gconf/dconf settings, I think the easiest method to undo it is through the menu.\nYou said toggling the state of the Read-only item in the Terminal window menu did not have any effect. I think this is a bug in your version of gnome-terminal, as it works for me in version 3.14.2-0ubuntu3 on 15.04. You may want to file a bug report for that one?\nNow, the other menu where we can change the Read-only setting is the context-menu. You usually open it with a right-click, but you said you're unable to perform that with your broken touchpad (which makes me wonder how you managed to enable it then, but anyway).\nMany keyboards also have a Menu key which should open a context menu in the current window. Yours seems not to have one though.\n\nSo we want to open a context menu with a right-click, but can't click ourselves. This sounds like a job for the famous xdotool!\nOpen another terminal emulator or anything which allows you to run commands. Move the mouse pointer above an open window of gnome-terminal and run the following command from the second terminal:\nxdotool click 3\n\nIt will emulate a right-click on the current mouse pointer position. As this is on the gnome-terminal window, it will open a context menu there. You should now be able to unselect the Read-only option in that open context menu manually.\n", "Q: Understanding The X Driver I'm trying to understand the technical bit about the nomodeset parameter in the GRUB boot loader. I read the statement below off of an Ubuntu forum (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132):\n\"The newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into the kernel. So all the programming of the hardware specific clock rates and registers on the video card happen in the kernel rather than in the X driver when the X server starts\"\nThe way I understood how graphics memory worked is that the BIOS looks after the graphics card and memory. Normally GRUB will pass off this memory to the Kernel because of the $vt_handoff parameter in the bootloader. So what I don't understand from the paragraph above, is what the X driver is (what/who owns it & when it is run)?\n\nA: nomodeset deactivates Kernel Mode Settings (KMS).  \nThis means that the X Server takes care of the graphics - \"X driver\" is misleading in my opinion.\nThe X session is started by your display manager, e.g for GDM:\n/sbin/init (root) --> /usr/sbin/gdm (root) --> gdm-session-worker (root) --> /usr/lib/gdm/gdm-x-session (your user)\nThe X Server or the \"kernel\" determines the necessary information itself, not a BIOS or something similar.\n", "Q: How do i properly install ubuntu on a pc with ubuntu already on it? I have Ubuntu 10.10 installed on my pc currently. I bought a USB flash drive and did the installation instructions from the Ubuntu website. Just to let you know, I did install the Ubuntu OS from a windows 7 PC. So. I plugged the USB flash drive into the PC I wanted it on, started it, then I opened the boot list. Wasn't there so I restarted my computer. I went to the boot list and then it showed up. I selected it and a page shows up after about 30 seconds that showed the Ubuntu install list.

Or can you guys help me out?\nUPDATE: Here is what happens when I press Install Ubuntu\n\nWhen I press Install Ubuntu, it freezes, and shows that weird pixley sliver at the top of the screen.\nI'll update more if it does anything else.\n\nA: Well, I can tell you from my personal experience, Lubuntu is WAY easier to handle, a lot smoother and a lot faster in comparison to Ubuntu. It's also more similar to Windows, so you won't have much problems maneuvering. Also, how about you try making a Live CD/DVD and booting from that?

I'm a longtime Ubuntu user but I would still call myself a Linux beginner.\nI just bought a new laptop with Windows 10 installed, and installed Ubuntu 14.04.3 to dual boot alongside it.  I can boot into both OS's fine, but I notice that when I boot into Ubuntu, my Windows partition automatically mounts under /media/my_user/OS.  Is that a problem?  Specifically, does the fact that Windows is visible from Ubuntu mean that the two OS's are not sufficiently compartmentalized (e.g. is there a risk that I'll unknowingly overwrite Windows data as I use Ubuntu or vice versa)?\n\nA: Yes there is a risk, but it should be small. Just having the partitions mounted will not cause any problems, but if you write data to them or change them then you can cause problems. \nFor example, if you were to delete all the files in the windows partition while running Linux, you would not be able to boot into windows. \nFor the most part, things will go along the lines of common sense. Don't delete or change windows programs or components and everyone remains happy. \nThere are a couple of exceptions. First encrypted files and folders in windows will look like gibberish in Linux. Messing with those will damage them. And if you \"suspend\" windows and boot into Linux, doing almost any write operation on the windows partition has the ability to cause data loss. (This is one reason you should turn off fast boot in the bios).\nOf course \"global\" disk changes like partitioning and  formatting will cause data loss if not done correctly. Some data recovery or file system tools will cause an issue too. \nSo in the end, \nThere are risks, but they are much the same as if you dual booted windows 8 and windows 10 and started monkeying around with \"the other\" install. Your day to day stuff should be 100% safe, just watch your self as you do file system operations and be aware of write operations. Good advise no matter the OS or file system.\n\nA: Well, not really.\nEssentially, Ubuntu sees that drive as an external storage medium - just like a USB or an external hard drive:\n\nSee how my 234 GB volume is mounted with\nSo the risk of writing over data on your Windows partition is essentially the same as writing over on a USB.

I've been developing an app to handle my music collection, and I had in the past set up a backup solution for my code, but I blacklisted the /music folder . And the worst has happened, I've accidentally recursively deleted the folder using unlink and rmdir php's function. There was about 50GB of data, .mp3, .ogg and .m4a .\nI know there is solutions around, like foremost, scalpel , photorec, extundelete to recover deleted data. \nMostly, my problem is that the partition where data stood /dev/sda2 is 897Gb, and the system partition is only 20Gb. I asked my system provider OVH if I can add some more space via another DD or USB drive, but it's impossible. I also asked if I can pay for a copy of the entire disk, but it's also not possible.\n\nI'm thinking about three possible solutions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use one of the program and copy to the available space in /, and do it several times, each time I'll scp the current recovered data to another server I own.\n\n*Other solution would be to make an image of the partition and scp it progressively to the second server ( I really don't know if it's possible )\n\n*Third solution, would be to repartition the /home sda2 main partition, but \nI'm afraid this will corrupt / erase / overwrite the not yet recovered data.\nWhat can I do to recover my data in this special case?\n\nA: \nUse one of the program and copy to the available space in /, and do it several \n  times, each time i 'll scp the current recovered data to another server i owe.\n\nThis might work. Though it is going to take some time. \n\nOther solution would be to make an image of the partition and scp it progressively to the second server ( I really don't know if it's possible )\n\nIt will create a file on the server 1st so you would need the space there 1st...  so no... Example of this\ndd if=/dev/{partition} ibs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror | \n(ssh {IP} dd of=/partition.img obs=4096)\n\n\nThird solution, would be to repartition the /home sda2 main partition, but i'm afraid this will corrupt / erase / overwriting the data \n\nIt will.\n\nAlternative: \nCan you use sshfs?

I have just upgraded to 15.10 from 15.04 and now my Ubuntu will not get past the ubuntu loading screen? It just hangs...\nManaged to get back into the desktop briefly using recovery mode and reinstalled the proprietary drivers, but now I cannot get into anything on any boot option! \n\nA: Ok, I couldn't get it to work and also checked out the link Charles sent me but to no avail.\nI reinstalled the system and installed the proprietary drivers again and I got the same symptoms, the system hung on the plymouth screen so this looks like an AMD graphics compatibility issue.

Any ideas of how to fix this?\nP.S I can get a tty.\n\nA: It seems that switching over to lightdm  worked. sudo dpkg-reconfigure lighdm. No idea why.\n", "Q: What does > mean in the terminal! when I type in a certain command sometimes I'll get output that looks like this.\n>\n>\n>\n>\n\nWhat EXACTLY are the > symbols referring to.\n\nA: Your Case\nThe \">\" symbol in this case means that the terminal wants more input after you've hit the enter key.\nIn your case, you have a string that hasn't been closed. For instance, if I entered the following command echo \"Hello, and then hit enter, it would give me a \">\" until I closed the string. \nExample:\nIf I type in:\neric@Ubuntu: /home/eric$ echo \"Hello\n>what?\n>single quotes won't close it?'\n>but double quotes will! \"\n\nIt would print out the following output:\nHello\nwhat?\nsingle quotes won't close it?'\nbut double quotes will! \"\n\nThis allows you to have one string that spans multiple lines, without having to explicitly type in the \"\\n\" newline character.\nExtra Information\nThe fact that a \">\" is printed out for this prompt, and not something else is set by the $PS2 environment variable. If you set $PS2 to something else, then that is what you will be prompted with.\nAnother way to get this prompt to show is by having a backslash (\"\\\") at the end of the line. It basically concatenates two lines together so for example, the following two lines:\neric@Ubuntu: /home/eric$echo \"Hello \\\n>There my friend\"\n\nwould be processed as eric@Ubuntu: /home/eric$echo \"Hello There my friend\" and just output Hello There my friend.\nBoth of these methods are used to format you're code in a more readable way. It can be frustrating the first few times you see it as you don't really know what is causing it but when trying to make longer code, or the code's output, readable they will both come in handy.\n\nA: A pipe it can also be used to append information to a file for instance if you were to type the following in the terminal\necho \"Test Line\" > test.txt\n\nThat will set the contents of test.txt file to \"Test Line\" with a newline character at the end. If the file doesn't already exist it will be created.\necho \"Test Line\" >> test.txt\n\nThis will add \"Test Line\" and a newline character to the end of the test.txt file if it exists. If it doesn't exist then file will be created empty, and then this line would be added to it.\n\nA: > means redirecting stream to\n>> means redirecting to but at the end\nit only applies to stdout\nwhereas 2> applies to stderr, obviously using 1> is the same as >\nstdout is the normal program output, stderr is the error output for programs.\nSo there are two outputs. You can redirect the two outputs using &>\nmore info here http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/io-redirection.html\n", "Q: Installing CUDA purges previous NVIDIA driver installation I just finished installing CUDA on my system following these instructions and found out that the installation changed the NVIDIA driver being used on my machine from version 352.55 to version 352.39, as you can see below:\n\nI probably wouldn't have even noticed it if I hadn't installed the driver version 352.55 to avoid the following two errors:\n\n\n*\n\n*ACPI PCC Probe Failed \n\n*[snd_hda_intel 0000:00:03.0: failed to add i915 component master (-19)]\n\n\nthat pop-up on any other driver I installed.\nI have 2 questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*During CUDA installation, is there a way to specify NOT to change the currently installed NVIDIA drivers?\n\n*If I purge driver 352.39 and reinstall 352.55 is this going to mess up my system / CUDA installation?\n\n\nMy system: Linux vega 3.19.0-25-generic #26~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 24 21:16:20 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nA: This is for standalone desktop with nvidia graphics. If you wish to retain your existing driver, download the 7.5 CUDA deb from nvidia, during install, deselect driver option otherwise your existing driver would get over written. Make sure to do the bash entries as described in the nvidia manual. if you have the driver installed, make sure to install nvidia-modprobe and reboot or else CUDA will not see your driver install.\n\nA: It's clear in the instructions that you linked to  that in order for CUDA to work there are tight restrictions on supported environments (see table 1 Native Linux Distribution Support in CUDA 6.5 on page 2). Your kernel version is  3.19.0-25-generic while the requirements listed indicate 3.13 on Ubuntu 14.04.\nI can only suggest that perhaps if you follow the strict requirements exactly you might get the results you desire. I cannot guarantee this however.

The 12.1.0 version of VMWare does not require this fix.\n\nVMWare and VMPlayer are in fact looking for a specific library string.

What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Your if..fi construct has wrong keyword.\nThere is no keyword like else if in bash, it should be elif. So the problem is you have two else if keywords in your code, meke them as:\nif ....; then\n  ## something\n\nelif ....; then\n  ## something\n\nelif ....; then\n  ## something\n\nelse\n  ## something\nfi\n\n\nA: The error has nothing to do with the \"done\" statement; this is a common type of error indicating that the interpreter got to the end, but was not expecting to get there yet.  That is, it was expecting a terminator for a previous statement, but got to the end without ever getting what it expected.\nI really don't think I should tell you the exact error, as finding errors is an important part of learning to program.  Really, you should now have enough information to find it, but I'll give one more hint, and advise you to check all your if statements to make sure they terminate correctly\n", "Q: Key board problems?

I even made a fresh installation of Ubuntu 15.10, but that didn't solve the issue, either.\nI have noticed that sometimes the problem is solved by forcing Compiz to restart (and Nautilus for the desktop icons), executing these commands:\nkillall compiz\nkillall nautilus\nnautilus -n &\n\nI didn't find it easy to describe the problem, so maybe these screenshots that could clarify the explanation:\nHow my desktop looks now\nHow it is supposed to look\n\nA: This problem was solved for me when I downgraded kernel.

When I downgraded to the stock kernel the theme worked properly.\n\nA: I have faced the same problem in Ubuntu 15.10 when replaced the HDD with SSD. Fonts started looking just like in your pictures and I couldn't apply Numix theme! I solved this by disabling the Ubuntu user auto-login in a system.

To load themes correctly, I had to restart unity by\n$ unity\n\nI searched and thought it could be a graphic driver problem.

Why can I execute programs without reading them?\n$ echo 'echo \"foo\"' > test && chmod 100 test && ./test\nfoo\n\n\nA: I think your stated test command and case will only work under root (superuser), based on my tests with the exact same command on my Ubuntu Trusty box.\nThis is an unprivileged account:\n[teward /home/teward/tmp/]% echo 'echo \"foo\"' > test && chmod 100 test && ./test\nzsh: permission denied: ./test\n\nThis is as root:\n[god /home/teward/tmp/]# echo 'echo \"foo\"' > test && chmod 100 test && ./test\nfoo\n\n(Regarding god on my root prompt:  I have root and my user using zsh as the login shell.  My PS1 for ZSH replaces 'root' with 'god' for the root user on my system, but it's still 'root'.  Privilege level is indicated by the character to the right of the closing square brace - the # indicates root, and % indicates standard user, which is how you know the privilege level)\nI think this is because 'root' is considered god, and can do almost anything.  Double-check the user you're using.\n\nA: Because your shell has to read the file to know what to execute. If you remove read access, it can't read it so doesn't know what you want executed.\n", "Q: mysql workbench broken after upgrade to Ubuntu 15.10 mysql-workbench crashes soon after launch with the

One reason why I appreciate Linux is that it has the amazing ability to give solutions for any kind of IT-related problem. \nI have an Samsung phone running Android GingerBread. I've spend my entire last week editing - while being in offline mode - one very long and important email. But today, I have accidentally discarded the message. As a result, the draft just disappeared! It's not even in trash. \nNaturally, I've searched on web for a solution, looked on the Android-centred forums and sites. Apparently, there is no solution. At least, not on the Android side.\nBut I know from my own personal experience, that, when my Android devices had technical problems, not, Android, not Windows, but Linux was the one that helped me to see, to repair and recover the information from those devices. \nSo, now, I want to know if anyone of you knows any tool that could help me access informations stored deep inside Android. Frankly, I find hard to believe that once you hit the \"discard\" button you loose all your written words. All that information must be still stored somewhere for a while. Must be some temp files somewhere (I used this trick a lot on Windows in order to recover Word texts).\nAnyway, I think you got the idea. Do you know any Linux tool that can help recover discarded Gmail mails from an Android device? (I need something that works on 12.04 and in a Gnome environment.) Thanks!\n\nA: testdisk / photorec are good options for recovering deleted files, but I have no idea if the Gmail app even stores drafts as individual files on your device, or in one big \"drafts\" file. testdisk can recover simply deleted files that have not been overwritten yet, so that's an idea.\nI don't have a perfect answer, but a few tactics that might work out.\nYou might want to consider searching through your entire device's storage with a hex editor (Bless is one I like, graphic & works in Gnome) on the off chance that your draft was stored in plain text. And searching the entire device will look through every sector, in every file, deleted or not. \nSearching a removable memory/SD card would easy, if the drafts were stored on it somewhere. Just remove it and put it in your computer, search away. But I don't know how easy or possible it is to search every sector of your Android's internal storage, or if it's even possible to do \"remotely\" from your computer. Maybe running an app or terminal on the device itself might work, running as \"root\" to search everywhere, so I suspect a rooted device would be required. \nAnd the drafts could be stored in a compressed format too, so that's certianly an onion in the ointment.\n\nIf it was synced to Gmail's servers, then I'll bet they have a copy of it somewhere, but I haven't read anything useful about how to get a real person at Gmail to recover it.\n\nJust a thought, I've used a program on Windows a long time ago that could search through all the RAM to look for text that was lost from a crashed notepad-type program. But a reboot normally resets/erases the RAM, and it could be overwritten at any time too.\n", "Q: Can't mount Nokia Lumia 735 on Ubuntu 15.04 Description:\nI connect  my Nokia Lumia 735 (WP8.1) via USB to Ubuntu (last updates all in) - it \"mounts\" \"LUMIA 735\" but suddenly with the popup error\n\"Impossibile montare \"Lumia 735 (RM1038)\"\nErrore nell'inizializzare la fotocamera: -53: Could not claim the USB device\"\nIn english: \n\"Can't mount LUMIA 735 \"(RM1038)\"\nError in the photocamera initialisation -53 : Could not claim the USB Device\" \nand stop....

I might as well upgrade my distribution to the bleeding-edge.\" without a valid explanation; which is not provided.\nI must say that this post was the most helpful so far: I am trying to install Steam on ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit\nIt touched on something, rather unwittingly, that I didn't pick up on before hand. These packages are already installed and yet Steam complains that they are not there. When I ran sudo apt-get install {dependent packages here}, Ubuntu complained that they were already installed! Aptitude became useless at this point since I realized I can't resolve resolved dependencies redundantly (i could, but i don't really see the point).\nThat's when I bumped into the next thread: http://www.askubuntu.com/questions/588024/steam-install-error-on-14-04-ubuntu-64bit\nThis one piqued my interest because it meant that I should remove my current libraries and install the new ones, although I'm not sure if I should be using trusty instead of utopic, something to research. But it was labeled as a workaround (something I've yet to try my self).\nsudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri-lts-utopic:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic:i386\n\nThe last thread I found: http://www.askubuntu.com/questions/256271/how-do-i-install-steam-64-bit-when-package-dependencies-cannot-be-resolved\nThis one was interesting because it suggests to turn on support for i386 packages.\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\n\nI'm pretty sure this doesn't work seeing as I did give it whirl, but I would assume the i386 is supported unless the packages have been deprecated (which they were deprecated).\nSteps I took: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fresh Install of Ubuntu LTS 14.04.3 \n\n*Ran updates during and after install \n\n*Downloaded Debian Package from Steam directly \n\n*Ran dpkg and then ran Steam \n\n*Steam prompts for additional packages \n\n*Typed in admin password (this step always fails!)\n\n*press return for continue\n\n*Then Steam ran an update and started right up\n\n\nEvery time I launch Steam, it prompts me for packages that come with Ubuntu by default (depending on how Ubuntu configures itself for your device(s)).\nI noted that the steam-launcher differed from steam and would never actually execute the app. So when steam finally did run, I locked the icon to the launcher.\nI have not come across a valid solution and none of the threads above seem to supply one either. If I happen to find a valid solution I will post, but until then, if anyone has any suggestions, please by all means... POST!\nUpdate on Oct 3, 2016:\nI never found a solution to this issue, but this post helps consolidate several similar or related issues. I did find out later on that 15.10 implemented official repositories from steam and that 15.04 <= used to have older repositories which are now deprecated. (You can always download the deb file, there's a link provided below in the comments thanks to @Organic Marble). I eventually decided to move from 14.04.1 to 15.10 and stayed there until 16.04.1 was released. Steam works fine and can be installed easily using the apt tool with 15.10 >= and up.\n\nA: Just open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install steam -y\n\nThat seems to fix all unmet dependencies. This worked for me.\n\nA: To install steam, if you have issues, the best approach is to use the terminal with dpkg + apt. Those utilities will give you the most fine grained control. If you get problems you'll be able to copy/paste the errors to get more help.\nThis steps also work for Debian.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the steam DEB package\n\n*Enable the 32 bit repository: \nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\n*Update the package list: sudo apt-get update\n\n*Try to install the package with dpkg, it will fail because of the missing dependencies: sudo dpkg -i steam.deb\n\n*Now, correct the missing dependencies: sudo apt-get install -f\n\n*Verify that steam is properly installed: sudo dpkg -i steam.deb\nAt this moment steam should be installed.\nThere have been cases where the libraries in steam created issues, like: https://askubuntu.com/a/706796/430526\nIn other cases Steam will complain because the packages with the 32 bit 3D libraries are not installed, you may need to install those packages. For example if you use nvidia drivers: install libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386\nAn useful link regarding missing 32bit 3D drivers: https://www.codeweavers.com/support/wiki/Diag/MissingLibGL\nIf it doesn't work, paste the contents of your terminal, it is usually easy to see what the problem is from them.\n", "Q: How to hide filesystems from the launcher in unity Sorry if this is a silly question - I'm not really experienced in Ubuntu.\nI have recently enabled my Chromebook to dual-boot with Ubuntu using crouton.

Today my sound stopped working inside of the guest. Inside the sound settings there is only a Dummy Output. I went through several steps, including alternating between all three of my possible Audio Controllers and restarting both VB and the Host several times. I tried repairing the AC97 Driver as outlined here.\nThere is no ALSA host Audio driver available on the audio settings. After looking into that, I believe that it is the culprit. I have tried to run the alsamixer, but the terminal reported that no file existed. whereas found it, and I tried to execute it with a double click in the GUI, but nothing happened. So I Uninstalled and reinstalled the alsa-utils, and the alsamixer several times and the problem still persists.\nAny Ideas?\n\nA: In a default setup your guest Ubuntu should have all drivers installed needed to use the host sound system for output on a (virtualized) sound device.\nWhen no sound card is detected this usually is an issue with host sound drivers that are not correctly passed through to the Virtual Box sound driver. Re-installing the guest audio system will likely not solve these issues.\nTo debug this let me suggest the following approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a guest session on your virtual Ubuntu to make sure is it not a per-user setting that conflicts with the audio system.\n\n*Boot your VM with identical VM setting from an Ubuntu installation ISO with \"Try Ubuntu\" to exclude a bad install of the audio system on the already installed Ubuntu.\n\n*Make sure you have the following settings for your virtual machine running on a Windows host:\n\n\n*\n\n*choose DirectSound as host audio driver.\n\n*choose IHC AC97 as a guest controller.\n\n*audio should not be muted in the host.\n\n\n*Update host Virtual Box to the latest release (Windows 10 sound issues were only fixed from release >= 5.0.2).\n\n*Update you guest Ubuntu distribution with latest kernels:  \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  \n\n\n*Check that the guest audio is not muted by running alsamixer in a terminal.\n\n*If there still is no audio it may help to reinstall the host audio drivers.

The script reads all common image formats, non- image files are ignored (raising in IOError)\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport shutil\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport sys\n\ndr = sys.argv[1]; target = sys.argv[2]\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(dr):\n    for f in files:\n        try:\n            file = root+\"/\"+f\n            img = Image.open(file); size = img.size; ratio = size[0]/size[1]\n            if ratio == 4/3:\n                shutil.copyfile(file, target+\"/\"+f)\n        except (IOError, ValueError):\n            pass\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as search_ratio.py\n\n*Run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/search_ratio.py /source/directory /target/directory\n\nIf one or more directories include spaces, use quotes. \nAn example command I used for testing:\npython3 '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/pscript_4.py' '/home/jacob/Bureaublad' '/home/jacob/Afbeeldingen/test'\n\nIn case you are extracting images from a \"flat\" (single) directory\nThen the script can be a little simpler:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport shutil\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport sys\n\ndr = sys.argv[1]; target = sys.argv[2]\n\nfor f in os.listdir(dr):\n    try:\n        file = dr+\"/\"+f\n        img = Image.open(file); size = img.size; ratio = size[0]/size[1]\n        if ratio == 4/3:\n            shutil.copyfile(file, target+\"/\"+f)\n    except (IOError, ValueError):\n        pass\n\nUse it exactly like the first one.\nNote that with the first script, you will get name clashes in case of duplicated names in different source folders.\n", "Q: How can I get emacs24 fonts to smooth like in the terminal? I've seen the question asked many times, but I can't find an answer which works.  I've tried editing .Xresources.\nBut in the end, I cannot get emacs fonts to look as nice as they do in the terminal.\n\nHas anyone worked this out?\n\nA: Well, I worked this out.  Maybe it will save someone else.  \nFull hinting is evil.  In other words, I needed:\nXft.hintstyle:  hintslight\n\nInstead of \nXft.hintstyle:  hintfull\n\nAlong with\nXft.dpi:        96\nXft.antialias:  true\nXft.rgba:       rgb\nXft.hinting:    true\nXft.hintstyle:  hintslight\n\nIn ~/.Xdefaults.  Then xrdb -merge .Xdefaults and finally emacs looks beautiful again.\n", "Q: Diodon not launching at startup I'm currently using Xubuntu 14.04 and I have Diodon set to start automatically (under Session and Startup, I go to the 'Application Autostart' tab and I've made sure that the box for \"Diodon (GTK+ clipboard manager)\" is ticked. Nevertheless, the application does not launch automatically at system startup. \nI can launch the application manually (via whisker menu or terminal) and it works fine. Any ideas why the app won't start automatically?\n\nA: Your session cache might be stale. Try clearing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Select Session and Startup\n\n*Select the Session tab\n\n*Click the `Clear saved sessions' button\n\n\nNow logout and log back in, and see if Diodon starts.\n\nA: I found a simple workaround. I gave up on Diodon's attempt to make enable autostart by default so I unticked the box and instead added I new autostart application using \"diodon\" as the command to launch it. Now diodon starts up after booting the system.\n\nA: In Linux Mint, what works for me is to open the System Monitor.  Right click on Diodon.  Change the priority to Very High.  Reboot.  Then this extremely convenient program runs on startup.  WFM.\n", "Q: Why I can't change my ubuntu root password? I've been using Ubuntu 15.04 for a while with my password, so far so good (I'm the only user and root). But I wanted to change my password and tried to do that throuth terminal withsudo passwd. It asks me for my new password and than tell me the pw was successfully updated. The point is, my password doesn't change, it is the same old one. The new one doesn't work, it looks as if I've done nothing. What is that and how do I fix?\nGrateful.\n\nA: Run these commands:\nsudo passwd root\n\n[enter your user's password]\n[enter the password you want]\n[enter the same password]\nAnd you're done.\n", "Q: Nvidia module null pointer dereference in boot up I was trying to get KinectFusion via PCL running on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine working with a Microsoft Kinect v1 sensor and also an Asus Xtion Pro sensor.

\"tainting\" the kernel. I'm not sure if this is from my unplugging one of the sensors and restarting the computer while it was frozen, or if it's due to another issue that coincidentally arose while I was trying to install PCL's KinectFusion implementation.\nI've tried restarting the computer many times but I always get the same result (including the same logs as above). What's the easiest way to get my computing back to a normal state?\n\nA: Following this forum post and this blog post and other results from Googling, I did the following and was able to load Ubuntu and get into the desktop. I did this through ssh from another computer:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\nsudo vi /etc/default/grub\n# change two lines to:\n# GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n# GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"rcutree.rcu_idle_gp_delay=1\" \nsudo update-grub\n\nSpecifically, I added \"nomodeset\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and \"rcutree.rcu_idle_gp_delay=1\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX. I'm not sure which of these 3 things solved it, but now it's working.\nThere are still some strange things in the /var/log/kern.log file about the nvidia module. Does anyone know if this these logs are typical/normal or should I be trying to fix it as well? There's no more null pointer dereferencing though.

But I ran into some trubles and wanted to redo the installation to ensure that every step along the way worked as expected. \nThus I 'apt-get purge cuda...'\nBut now I still have nvcc which confuses me as I expected it to belong to the cuda package.\nHow do I figure out which package nvcc belongs to?\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is dpkg -S.\nSo, to find out which package zgrep is in, try:\n$ dpkg -S `which zgrep`\ngzip: /bin/zgrep\n\nThis shows it's in the package gzip.\nOf course you can just use the path to the file, e.g.:\n$ dpkg -S /usr/share/dict/words\ndiversion by dictionaries-common from: /usr/share/dict/words\ndiversion by dictionaries-common to: /usr/share/dict/words.pre-dictionaries-common\ndictionaries-common, wamerican: /usr/share/dict/words\n\nThis incidentally shows a more complex example.\n\nA: Check with apt-file because in your case nvcc is part of a package (nvidia-cuda-toolkit).\nFirst you have to install apt-file\nsudo apt-get install apt-file\nsudo apt-file update\n\nNow start\napt-file search nvcc\n\nor\napt-file search --regex /nvcc$\n\nor\napt-file search $(which nvcc)\n\n\nTo check why the package nvidia-cuda-toolkit was installed use aptitude.\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\naptitude why nvidia-cuda-toolkit\n\n\nA: apt uses dpkg as back-end to install many apps, and for dpkg there is a /var/lib/dpkg/info directory , where there's many *.info files; these contain information on each and every file that came with a package. \nThus you can do grep -i --color 'nvcc' /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list . That may generate a pretty large list, however, so to narrow it down we can use which utility.\nwhich locates a particular binary/executable file. For instance, \nxieerqi:$ grep $(which gnome-terminal) /var/lib/dpkg/info>\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/gnome-terminal.list:/usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/gnome-terminal.list:/usr/bin/gnome-terminal\n\nThis tells grep to take full path to gnome-terminal executable, and find which package has installed it.  In this case the package was gnome-terminal. \nA not so obvious case would be nm-tool \nxieerqi:$ grep $(which nm-tool) /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list \n/var/lib/dpkg/info/network-manager.list:/usr/bin/nm-tool\n\nWe thus know, it belongs to network-manager package\n\nA: sudo apt-cache search nvcc\nreturns: \nlibnvvm2 - NVIDIA CUDA Compiler NVVM runtime library\nnvidia-cuda-toolkit - NVIDIA CUDA toolkit\napt-cache should already be installed on your system.\n", "Q: GenX on ubuntu software I wants to download the GenX reflectivity software on my ubuntu 14.04 os, ubuntu software centre is not showing this program. can any body help me.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install some dependencies\nsudo apt-get install python-appdirs \nsudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 \nsudo apt-get install python-h5py\n\n\n*Download the Linux source package here\n\n*Extract the archive\nsudo unzip ~/Downloads/GenX-2.4.2-source.zip -d /opt\n\n\n*Test the installation\npython /opt/genx/genx.py\n\n\n\n*Set the executable bit\nsudo chmod +x /opt/genx/genx.py\n\n\n*Create a desktop file\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/genx.desktop &\n\nand add the content below.\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=GenX\nComment=GenX\nType=Application\nExec=/opt/genx/genx.py\nIcon=/opt/genx/debian_build/genx_128x128.png \nCategories=\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\n\n*Save the file and close your editor\n\n*Start GenX from Dash/GNOME Shell\nMaybe it is also possible to create a DEB papckage because we have a debian_build folder,\nbut for me ... this method did not work.\n", "Q: Remove Ubuntu and restore DOS, not Windows I would like to uninstall Ubuntu and bring my laptop back to DOS. I don’t have Windows on it. All the examples I have seen use Windows to uninstall. How do I do this?\n\nA: If you want to use a live Ubuntu disk/usb, you could \n\n\n*\n\n*\"clear\" the Ubuntu partitions. You would run gparted, choose your hard drive and format to \"cleared\" any partitions you want to effectively erase. I believe it is equivalent to running wipefs on the partition, though it does not really erase or overwrite the data.\n[Excerpt from man page]\n\nwipefs - wipe a filesystem signature from a device\nDESCRIPTION\n         wipefs can erase filesystem or raid signatures (magic strings) from the specified\n         device to make the filesystem invisible for libblkid.  wipefs does not erase  the\n         filesystem  itself nor any other data from the device.\n\n\n*Or you could just create a new Partition Table (in GParted, under the Device menu), that would erase (hide) all the partitions on the drive.\nThen you would need a DOS install disk to install just DOS, though I don't think they're easy to find, according to Wikipedia the final MS-DOS release was in 2000. All the DOS install disks I've seen have been actual floppy disks, not many laptops have a floppy disk drive. You might want to try a web search for \"reinstall windows\", I found this site that sounds promising http://www.windowsreinstall.com/\nOR just installing Windows (or DOS) will often overwrite any Ubuntu stuff, Windows is traditionally excellent at ignoring anything on your hard drive and just installing itself over top (whether you want to erase the other things or not). So first I'd try not removing Ubuntu, and just install something else.\n\nA: Xen2050's answer pretty much sums it up. However there is another option:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install FreeDOS\nFreeDos is IMHO the best option you have today if you want \"DOS\". Unlike the microsoft counterpart, the guys of FreeDOS did continue the development. So you have a decent, up-to-date \"DOS experience\".\nInstallation instructions are here (general overview) and here (specific for VirtualBox but should apply to all PC's).\n\nA: As Ubuntu has no license, there is no specific advantage in first removing it (before installing something else). Therefore, there is NOT even any formal definition what an 'uninstall' might do.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup any data or settings you still need, on to external media.\n\n*Choose what OS you want on your Laptop, and proceed with install.\n", "Q: How to get the location of config file used by mailutils I installed mailutils with following command in my ubuntu system.\nsudo apt-get install mailutils\n\nBut I am unable to send message with this \npstree | mail -s \"PSTREE RESULT\" xxxx.gmail.com\n\nWhen I was installing mailutils I set gmail.com as mail provider. \nNow I want to find the mailutils config file.

I want to use OpenDNS and I want to set things up using the command line, I thought that I should edit the /etc/resolv.conf file but the file starts with a comment stating: \n\nDO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\n\nSo how do I set up OpenDSN in Ubuntu 15.10?\n\nA: NetworkManager is the program which (via the resolvconf utility) inserts address 127.0.1.1 into resolv.conf. NM inserts that address if and only if it is configured to start an instance of the dnsmasq program to serve as a local forwarding nameserver. That dnsmasq instance listens for queries at address 127.0.1.1.\nIf you do not want to use a local forwarding nameserver, then configure NetworkManager so it doesn't start a dnsmasq instance nor inserts that address. In /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf comment out the line dns=dnsmasq\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\n#dns=dnsmasq\n\nand restart the NetworkManager service.\nsudo restart network-manager\n\nIn this mode, NetworkManager updates /etc/resolv.conf (still via resolvconf) to include the nameserver addresses NetworkManager has for active connections.\nIf you want to disable the resolvconf mechanism for updating resolv.conf and just use a static resolv.conf file, do the following.\nsudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf  # Delete the symbolic link\nsudo nano /etc/resolv.conf   # Create static file\n\n# Content of static resolv.conf\nnameserver 208.67.220.220\nnameserver 208.67.220.222\n\n\nA: The previous answer is perfect but to restart the network-manager you have to type this:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n", "Q: How to enable natural scrolling in xfce4? Is there any setting to enable natural scrolling for my touchpad?\nI can find the setting under XFCE settings for the mouse, but it doesn't work for the touchpad.

The numbers on the left means the order in which it will be executed in comparison with the other files.)\nsudo nano /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80synaptics\n\nAdd just the synclient commands in that file:\nsynclient VertScrollDelta=-58\n\n(should be owned by root, with permissions 644)\nchmod 644 /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80synaptics\n\n\nThere is still something odd: the horizontal scrolling is still wrong, This can be fixed with:\necho 'pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 7 6 8 9 10 11 12' >> .Xmodmap\nxmodmap .Xmodmap\n\n\nA: With Xfce 4.12 or above, you can go to Mouse settings and select Reverse scroll direction. The setting is under Mouse but it also reverses the scrolling direction for the touchpad.\n\nA: To get natural scrolling, you can add\nOption \"VertScrollDelta\" \"-71\"\nOption \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"-71\" \n\nto the xorg.conf for the input device, which could be the default /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf, or it could be your own /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-magic-touchpad.conf like\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Apple Magic Trackpad\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    MatchUSBID \"05ac:0265\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    Option \"FingerLow\" \"2\"\n    Option \"FingerHigh\" \"2\"\n    Option \"VertScrollDelta\" \"-71\" \n    Option \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"-71\"\nEndSection\n\nIncreasing the number -71 to eg. -111 will slow down the scrolling speed.\n", "Q: Changing Xfce window layout Is it possible to change the window manager to a layout like this?: \n\nThe present one takes up too much screen estate, in my opinion. The attached image one is very simple and looks very neat.\nIf it can be coded/modified, I would like to know that too.\n - It's the default design. But it feels a little too much.\n\nA: It looks like you are using a Window Manager with a tall top bar. I use Defcon-IV for example, and it has a small top area. You can install more Window Manager styles by running: \nsudo apt-get install xfwm4-themes\n\nTo toggle viewing the top menu items, just hit ctrl+m in Thunar. \nHere is Thunar on my computer.\nYou can change the icon size by going to View > Normal Size or zooming in or out. \n\nA: In Xubuntu 14.04 and newer, it is possible to optimize the style without installing anything. Use the Greybird-compact style. Compared to the default style, significant amount of screen estate is saved for Thunar.\n\nComparing GNOME Files to Thunar Greybird-compact, which is almost comparable to the desired bar height.\n\nTo minimize Thunar style, go to Settings Manager > Window Manager - Style, then change Theme to Greybird-compact. Click Close to finish. Finally, hide the menu bar by using Ctrl+M shortcut keys.\nUser can bring the menu bar again permanently by using the same shortcut keys. While the menu bar is hidden, you can still open the menu bar by pressing F10 key twice to temporarily show the File menu. Press Esc to close the menu and hide menu bar again.\nDisclaimer: This is not the real answer. This answer suggests an alternative approach to use a minimal theme, which gives similar result of saving some screen estate. But this doesn't comply the requirement of original poster to modify source codes of the bar.\n", "Q: After update 15.04 to 15.10 just black screen on boot On my Laptop (Acer 3820) I updated from 15.04 to 15.10\nAfter the restart I just get only a black screen.

How can I resolve this issue ?\nFor example:\nAfter installing chrome-stable, when I launch it from terminal I experience this error. \n\nA: What does it mean?\nSee AU: What is a segmentation fault? post and also this post which have some examples how reproduce it, SO: What is segmentation fault?.\nThe simplest description I can come with (may be not the perfect):\n\nThe program tried to access a memory area out side its own section. Operating system blocks it.\n\nSome cases: Reading value with uninitialized pointer, Going out of range in an array, Function call (when backward compatibility not maintained), ...\nHowever, it is not always easy find the cause with large programs or those which relay on other project lib's. And most of the cases end up with a bug report, either for target program or one of its dependencies (either upstream project or downstream distribution package).\nHow can I resolve this issue?\n\n\n*\n\n*Fire a bug report\nIf you didn't make any custom configuration/setup and you all updates installed. fire a bug report, see How do I report a bug?\nIf open source supported by Ubuntu use ubuntu-bug (apport-bug). For 3rd party closed source, check their help pages how to report bugs and collect related data.\n\n*Take initiative to debug\nIf you you have even a little programming background, it is recommended that you try your best to resolve it yourself. There many bug reports out there inactive for years. At least, you may be able to collect enough debug data that help resolve the issue when reporting it.\nThat's means that you are breaking the user abstraction level and opening the black box! (FLOSS actually has transparent box).\nSome Useful Tools for Debugging\nSome ... I mean there are many other useful tools out there that you gonna find when you dig in more. \n\n\n*\n\n*apport-bug logs / core dump / backtrace\nIf you don't have an error message before segmentation fault. Run it with --save option and look for back-trace log:\napport-bug program-cmd --save bug-report_output.txt\n\n\n*gdb backtrace / debuging source code\nIf it didn't work, use gdb:\n$ gdb program-cmd\n(gdb) run\n(gdb) backtrace\n\nIf you get any error message, check the web, launchpad and in upstream project bug tracker if there any similar cases.\nFor some advanced users or who are following a c/c++ learning path, they could download the corresponding -dbg symbols packages. Then you can use gdb to trace program flow through the source and get the exact function/instruction that raise the runtime error.\nFor Ubuntu(Debian) based distributions, source code of a package can be downloaded using:\napt-get source <package-name>\n\n\n*strace system call tracing\nAnother tool that may help is strace, I like it. It's really a powerful tool. \nIt presents itself:\n\nIn the simplest case strace runs the specified command until it exits.  It intercepts and records the system calls which are  called  by  a\n             process  and  the signals which are received by a process.  The name of each system call, its arguments and its return value are printed on\n             standard error or to the file specified with the -o option.\nstrace is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.  System administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find  it\n             invaluable  for  solving  problems  with  programs for which the source is not readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in\n             order to trace them.  Students, hackers and the overly-curious will find that a great deal can be learned about a  system  and  its  system\n             calls  by  tracing  even  ordinary  programs.   And programmers will find that since system calls and signals are events that happen at the\n             user/kernel interface, a close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug isolation, sanity checking  and  attempting  to capture\n             race conditions.\n\nSource: man strace\n\n*ltrace dynamic library call tracing\n\nltrace is a program that simply runs the  specified  command  until \n  it\n         exits.   It  intercepts and records the dynamic library calls which are\n         called by the executed process and the signals which  are  received  by\n         that  process.   It  can also intercept and print the system calls exe‐\n         cuted by the program.\nIts use is very similar to strace(1).\n\nSource: man ltrace\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu replace dpkg with snappy?

Also it failed with Mint linux. \nAll works fine with Windows so I guess its not hardware issue.\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: (Re) install the NVIDIA drivers, but first uninstall all NVIDIA software you had installed before.\nOpen a terminal and execute:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*  \nsudo reboot  \n\nWhen the GRUB boot menu appears : Highlight the Ubuntu menu entry and  press the \"e\" key.\nAdd the nouveau.modeset=0 parameter to the end of the linux line ... Then press F10 to boot.\nInstall the stable NVIDIA drivers from the Ubuntu repositories : \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-340\nsudo reboot  \n\nIn case you are using a notebook with hybrid graphics solution install Optimus support as well.  \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-prime  \n\n\nA: So basically what @cl-netbox said is correct, thus the answer is accepted. But in many cases there may be more things to consider. \nFirst at all is the fact that I was unable to start installation at all. After running from the LiveCD - no matter if I chose to start installation or to try the Ubuntu - I got the black screen after a while so I was unable to install Ubuntu this way. \nThe solution to this was to get to the pre-launch menu. To do so you need to press any key when the Ubuntu starts booting, while on the purple screen with a keyboard icon. \nWhen the menu appeared I had to highlight the \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" option and press F6 and the \"ESC\". This way the boot options line showed on the bottom of the screen - now I needed to delete the ending three \"---\" and append the \"noveau.modeset=0\" text to it, and press enter in order to start the Ubuntu form LiveCD. This allowed me to install Ubuntu later by clicking the \"install Ubuntu\" icon on the desktop. \nAfter the installation was done I had to reboot and do the steps described by @cl-netbox but a little different. I've needed to start the now installed Ubuntu system with the \"nouveau.modeset=0\" still intact, because otherwise the system would hang while trying to uninstall existing drivers. So I've highlihted the Ubuntu entry and pressed \"e\" and appended the \"nouveau.modeset=0\" to the end of the line starting with \"linux\" word, pressed F10 and the system has boot. \nThen I've issued the:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*  \nsudo reboot  \n\n..commands in the terminal. At this point the console told me that no drivers were installed (this may probably vary between Ubuntu versions) so I've immediately issued commands to install the new drivers:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-340\nsudo reboot  \n\nAfter reboot the system was all fine and working well. \n\nAs a side note I would like to say that I think the problem with nouveau drivers is that they probably overheat the GPU. Before I've fixed the problem the situation looked like following: \nEvery time , after the screen went black, during the reboot - I could hear the GPU fan working at maximum speed for a few seconds. \nThis could be verified by taking actuall measurements, but if this really the case - the issue is not only a problem on itself but also a threat for the underlying hardware. \n", "Q: How do you get Yate to launch on startup? How do you make Yate (VoIP telephony) start automatically at startup?\nI've read this excellent post about adding Startup Applications on login, what I'd like to know is the startup command for Yate specifically.\nAdd Startup Program (Ubuntu 14.04):\n\nBonus point if you can offer a link to a list of common startup application commands!\n\nA: OK, so I'm trying to teach you how to fish instead of giving you just a fish, so bear with me for a moment here.\nSo you have installed yate, probably with sudo apt-get install yate but then you don't know the command for it ( which is actually is . . .yate . . .very anticlimactic . . . ). Well, there's a method to it.\nWhat you install with sudo apt-get install yate is a package named yate, but then there is actual executable file called yate. In this case it's easy - they're named the same. It's a bit more tricky when package and command are different, e.g. nm-tool is a command,but it belongs to network-manager package.\nWhy is this important ? Every package installed with apt-get uses dpkg as  back-end , and in the /var/lib/dpkg/info folder we have *.list files per each package. yate also has one: /var/lib/dpkg/info/yate.list There you have list of all the files that yate package installs onto your computer, including the actual command/executable. Knowing that typically  executables go into /usr/bin folder , we conclude that /usr/bin/yate is the actual command. You can double check that by calling it form terminal.  So that's the command you want to put as autostart entry. \nAs for typical autostart entries . . .there is no typical ones, but Ubuntu does have some default autostart entries  (which are hidden by default), in /etc/xdg/autostart folder\n\nA: I doubt if you are able to give the bonus point with one point rep :), but the command for yate is:\nyate-qt4\n\nThe commands for globally installed (GUI) applications are found in their corresponding .desktop files in /usr/share/applications.

When being an executable, there is no such offset. A shared object executable, so to say, is a positional independent executable (PIE) using address space layout randomization (ASLR).\nThus, when looking at its /proc/pid/maps file, you will notice that the location of the loaded segments vary in each execution in contrast to standard executables.\nThe idea behind this feature is to add security to executables by hindering attackers from performing return-oriented programmings attacks.\nMany maintainers decided to build packages with PIE enabled as the default, e.g., since Fedora 23 or with Ubuntu 17.10.\n\nA: Tl;dr\nThere's no difference, aside from the fact that a compiled executable might be linked against a shared object but not against an executable.\n\nIn general, there are two ways to compile1 an executable:\n\n*\n\n*Using static linking: external libraries included in the source code are compiled and the compiled library (or object in the linker's perspective) is added to the executable itself;\n\n*Using dynamic linking: external libraries included in the source code are compiled but a link to the compiled library (or object in the linker's perspective) is added to the executable (and the compiled libraries / objects are loaded by the linker at run-time if needed);\n\nThere are advantages / disadvantages in using each of these methods, but that's not the point of the question;\n\n*\n\n*/bin/ntfsck and /usr/bin/gawk are shared objects: this means that an executable might be compiled and then linked against them to use their functionalities;\n\n*/bin/echo is an executable: this means that an executable might not be compiled and then linked against it to use its functionalities;\n\nSo /bin/ntfsck and /usr/bin/gawk are  technically compiled libraries (or objects in the linker's perspective), but, as one may have forsaw, nothing prevents a shared object from being run as an executable.\nOn a side note, notice also that file reports (for each of them):\n\ndynamically linked (uses shared libs)\n\nThis means that each of them is dynamically linked to (and likely uses) other shared objects as well.\n\n1. \"Compile\" intended in its broader acceptation, which includes preprocessing, compilation and linking.\n", "Q: how to create a hotspot when my laptop is already connected to a network I know a lot of people had asked this question but what I want to know is a bit different.\nMy laptop can access Internet by connecting to a wifi network say \"qwerty\".\nnow I want to create a hotspot (say \"apple\") in my ubuntu 15.10 so that I stay connected to my wifi network \"qwerty\" and still host a hotspot \"apple\" for my other devices so that both my laptop and the other device connected to my laptop could use internet.\nThe techniques I have discovered in this forum just allows us to create a hotspot but at the same time it disconnects the user from the existing wifi network he was originally connected to.\nI want to be connected to my original wifi network and host a hotspot at the same time....

I want it to be look like this:\n\nI have an HDD and an SSD in my PC, I want to install Ubuntu to SSD, I have windows on HDD. I want to be able to boot ubuntu from the windows 10 uefi boot manager. How do I do it?\n\nA: I can't answer the question directly, since I'm not very familiar with configuring Windows boot tools. I'd like to point out some basic issues, though....\nThere are two types of programs, with some overlap between them, that are relevant:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot managers -- These programs present a menu or other user interface to enable you to select which OS to boot.\n\n*Boot loaders -- These programs load an OS kernel into memory and transfer control to it. Most boot loaders can load just one type of OS kernel (such as a Linux kernel or a Windows kernel) into memory.\n\n\nThus, the boot path goes from the firmware to a boot manager to a boot loader to the OS. One boot manager can hand off control to another, and there can be more complex boot paths if one stage or another returns to an earlier step.\nSome programs, such as rEFIt, rEFInd, and gummiboot (now systemd-boot), are boot managers but not boot loaders. Others, such as the Linux EFI stub loader, are boot loaders but not boot managers. Still others, such as GRUB, are both boot managers and boot loaders. Some programs are boot loaders with limited boot management capabilities; for instance, ELILO and (under EFI) SYSLINUX can present menus that let you select which kernel to run, but they can't launch the boot loaders for other OSes.\nMy understanding of the Windows boot manager/loader is that it can chainload to another OS's boot loader or load a Windows kernel. It cannot load a Linux kernel directly, though (except perhaps via the EFI stub loader, but I don't know of anybody who's tried it that way). Thus, even if you succeed in configuring the Windows boot manager the way you want, you'll need a Linux boot loader in the mix.\nOne twist in all this is the Linux EFI stub loader, which is built into the kernel. The EFI stub loader turns the kernel into an EFI application that serves as a boot loader for the kernel itself. Thus, an EFI boot manager can fill a role very much like a boot loader, but technically, it's the kernel itself that's the boot loader. The nature of Linux kernel booting also means that you need to be able to pass options to the kernel, which few non-Linux boot managers make easy. Also, if you wanted to use this feature to have the Windows boot manager launch a Linux kernel, you'd need a way for the Windows boot manager to read the Linux kernel. Since the kernel is normally stored on a Linux-native filesystem, this would require changes to either move the kernel to a FAT partition or add an EFI driver for your Linux filesystem into the mix. Both are possible, but they add complications to the setup.\nNote also that EFIs include their own boot managers, but not boot loaders. Unfortunately, most EFIs' boot manager user interfaces are quite poor, so most people prefer having something else available to fill that role.\nMost experienced Linux users are familiar with GRUB and perhaps one or two other boot loaders or boot managers. Thus, you should have no problems getting advice on this site on how to configure GRUB, ELILO, SYSLINUX, gummiboot, or rEFInd to do what you want. (Note: I forked rEFInd from rEFIt, so if you care to use rEFInd, I'm the one to ask about it.) Expertise in configuring the Windows boot manager/loader is rarer here, though. If you really want to use the Windows tool, you should probably ask on a Windows forum.\nThere are about a bazillion questions and answers about boot manager and boot loader setup on this site, so please search if you care to use a more traditional Linux-friendly boot manager. If you can't find the answer to your question, feel free to ask another. (I recommend asking a new question rather than posting follow-ups, since your follow-up questions are likely to be very different from your original question and will require extensive new answers.)\n", "Q: Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition Are there any hardware differences between the Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition and a regular Dell XPS 13?

hardisk space HI I had recently installed Ubuntu 14.4. I would like to know what email app I could used ? I do not have much space on my hard disck and not want to use network drive. I am looking for an app which can connect to multiple email accounts and type and any updates done on the server directly (no file on hard disk).\n\nA: In the graphical environment, Mozilla Thunderbird is a good choice.\nIf you like or want to get into console (text based) apps, then mutt is for you.\nMost important:  In either case, to accomplish your low disk space requirement, you will configure your email application's email server connections to use the IMAP protocol.  This protocol is common and easy to configure.  Most email providers and email client developers have instructions on their websites.  Don't use POP protocol which usually results in a higher disk usage on the client system.\n", "Q: How to retrieve my Desktop folder and its contents While moving a text file from desktop to /var/www/html directory using the command: \n$ mv /home/xyz/Desktop /var/www/html\n\nI missed writing the file name after Desktop(I.e. The command should have been $ mv home/xyz/Desktop/test.html /var/www/html), now that I had moved an entire directory to /var/www/html I deleted it using the command: \n$ rm -r Desktop \n\n(while I was in the html directory). Now, although I can see the files and folders on my desktop I'm unable to access or open them, it says \n\"This location cannot be displayed, perhaps it has been deleted\". \n\nPlease tell me how I can retrieve my files on the Desktop :( \n\nA: The files were unlinked by the rm command. The data is still sitting there on your disk, but the link to them has been removed.  \nTherefore stop using the machine immediately as the more you use it, the more the unlinked files get destroyed...\nPlease use photorec: you can find more information about it here and here, and this video shows you how to use it.\nFor more info : Where do files go when the rm command is issued ?\n\nA: I'm sorry, the only way to retrieve them now is from backup.\nAfter you mv (move) files, you still have only one copy of the file.\nAfter you moved your Desktop to the wrong location, you should have just moved it back:\nmv /var/www/html/Desktop /home/xyz\n\nBut you can't do that now because instead you removed (rm) them.  Once a file is removed 99.9% of the time, there's no way to get it back.\nLessons learned.\n", "Q: Slow WiFi on my Toshiba Installed Ubuntu 14.04 on Toshiba satellite-L305D.

I've been trying to install Linux (yesterday Arch, today Ubuntu) for quite some time now. I had graphics issues every single time. Mostly bsod a few seconds after logging in, rarely directly on boot.\nNow I finally got it to work on 15.10, but only when I manually add \"nomodeset\" to kernel parameters. If I set it in /etc/default/grub and run \"sudo update-grub\", the resolution is set to 1024x768. Also, I am using the open-source radeon driver, because the release notes say so.\nWhat is going wrong here?\nReally getting frustrated, especially because Ubuntu has mostly worked flawless for me. How do I fix this?\nAlso, I haven't yet found out how to set my refresh rate to 144hz.\n\nA: Using nomodeset is a tool to get your graphics working properly, not the solution. As such, I wouldn't be worrying about the resolution you're getting.\nYou need to boot with nomodeset and figure out how to fix your drivers, most likely by either: updating the open-source one (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade) or by installing the proprietary driver (you should be able to do this from the 'Additional Drivers' application that comes with Ubuntu by default).\nGood luck! \n", "Q: Change sound output from command line I have written a script that changes my display output from DVI (my monitor) to HDMI (my TV) by using xrandr. In this script, I would also like to change my audio output from analog line out to HDMI.\nI have tried the following:\npacmd set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_01_00.1.hdmi-stereo-extra1\n\nThis seems to change some sounds (like the sound you hear when you adjust volume on the desktop) to hdmi, but still the default sound output for applications (like Steam big picture mode and various  games) is set to analog. To change it to HDMI, I need to click the sound settings panel on the desktop and change it manually to HDMI.\nHow do I change the sound output from the command line reliably? Or alternatively, what exactly does Ubuntu sound settings do under the hood when I change the sound output?\nI'm running Ubuntu 15.10.\n\nA: Changing the default output device can indeed be done using pulseaudio's CLI interface:\npacmd set-default-sink <sink_name|index>\n\nThis default device may however be changed by the module-stream-restore which is loaded by default. This module will also restore a device unless we call it with the following parameter:\nload-module module-stream-restore restore_device=false\n\nThis should be put in our default.pa to replace the corresponding line there.\nTo make this change valid for all users we therefore need to edit the /etc/pulse/default.pa as root. A better approach is however to work on a copy of this file in our user directory where we can put it to ~/.config/pulse/\ncp /etc/pulse/default.pa ~/.config/pulse/\n\nSetting we made there will override those in /etc/pulse, so it is safe to experiment here. If anything goes wrong we simply delete this file to let pulseaudio use the system-wide defaults again.\nAll changes in default.pa ne a reset of the pulseaudio server to take effect. This can be done with:\npulseaudio -k\n\nAlso see:\nHow to change pulseaudio sink with  \"pacmd set-default-sink\" during playback?\n", "Q: Upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 to 15.04 I was viewing this(How to Upgrade from 14.10 to 15.04) answer on how to upgrade. what I wanted to know is there are some commands which are depreciated in the version 15.04, so if i upgrade will they work?\n\nA: You can not upgrade from 14.04 to 15.04.\nOne only can upgrade from a LTS release to next regular release during the time of it's support or to next LTS.

So I built a server for all my media streaming and storage needs. It's got three 3TB WD Reds in it configured in a RAID 5. I'm running Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS. I had a friend set up the raid for me (I'm not too Linux savvy) about a year ago. Well, I'm running low on space. So I bought 3 more WD reds, same size to add to this machine. The motherboard supports up to 6 drives so that should be good (Ubuntu is running off a thumb drive). I have backed up everything critical (pictures and home movies). If I lose the rest of the data I'll be sad and have lost a LOT of work but it won't be the end of the world. Still, if there's a way to add these new drives to the array without losing everything that'd be great. Can anyone point me to an idiot's guide? Thanks! Any questions about the setup just let me know!\n\nA: Straight from the mdadm man page.\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/8/mdadm\n\nGrow (or shrink) an array, or otherwise reshape it in some way. Currently\nsupported growth options including changing the active size of component\ndevices and changing the number of active devices in Linear and RAID\nlevels 0/1/4/5/6, changing the RAID level between 0, 1, 5, and 6, and\nbetween 0 and 10, changing the chunk size and layout for RAID 0,4,5,6, as\nwell as adding or removing a write-intent bitmap.\n\nAlso, https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Growing\nBack to your config. Three drives, so two data + one parity (distributed). The more drives you add, the higher the probability that more than one can fail at a time.\nIf it were me, I would start over with a RAID 6 and get an additional disk to function as a hot spare. Even if that meant purchasing a storage controller. RAID 6 uses two disks worth of distributed parity so your available space would be 4 drives worth.\nA compromise would be RAID 5 with a hot spare, which would fit in your current storage controller footprint. The exposure here is that you can take another fault while the array is rebuilding with the spare at which point you've lost everything.\nAll this is great, but even RAID with spares doesn't mean much without monitoring. We just had a HW RAID go at work, RAID 6 with no spares and no alerts setup. It lost both parity drives and then hit a single unrecoverable read error and that was it, the whole array was lost.\nWhen you take on a software RAID you also take on all the responsibility of running it smoothly. If that isn't for you then I would suggest looking at Drobo storage arrays.\nhttp://www.techrepublic.com/blog/the-enterprise-cloud/how-drobos-beyondraid-compares-to-traditional-raid-technologies/\nhttp://www.drobo.com/drobo-capacity-calculator/\nI hope this helps.

Okay so I have Samba running on my server and I have noticed that it can't display folder contents unless the folder is set with chmod 700 to give rwx attributes to everything instead of just rw with chmod 600. I'm curious as to why that is. I have several folders that have media in them and I would like to set those using \"chmod -R 644\" which from what I understand will give the owner read/write access and everyone else read only access. If I use those settings though, when I log in with samba (both my Linux username and Samba username are the same) it says the folder is empty.\nHere is my smb.conf\n[3TB]\n    writeable = yes\n    force directory mode = 744\n    valid users = jack,kodi,technovore\n    case sensitive = yes\n    user = jack,kodi,technovore\n    force create mode = 744\n    create mode = 744\n    comment = Root 3TB on IACON\n    delete readonly = yes\n    path = /media/3TB\n\nIf I use the attributes for the Movies folder, then everything is fine, I could even use 700 instead of 777.\nHowever if I use the set for TV it will show the folder but not the contents. 777 vs 644.\nCan someone explain why this is happening?\nFolder Attributes\n\nA: The execute bit on a directory is used to allow the user to descend into the directory (traversal).  If you do not set the execute bit you will not be able to read or manipulate the contents of the directory.  By default a directory permissions is 0775.  This means everyone can see and manipulate the files therein.  The files created have the default permissions of 0664.  This means that the user and group have read and write while all others have read permissions.  \nThe exception to this is the root users creation permission settings.  These are 0755 for directories and 0644 for files.  This still allows all users to view the files in the directory while only allowing the root user read and write permissions.\nYou need to allow the user to access the directory with the directory permissions and the ability to manipulate the files with the file permissions.\nThis needs to be set initially on the shared directory.  Then you can provide for the share file and directory creation permissions with this\n\n[share]\n...\n       create mask = 0664\n       directory mask = 0775\n\nThe create mask is for the file permissions and the directory mask is for directory permissions.  Since all permissions are defined by the most recent umask setting you can consider the mask configurations as Samba's umask settings for the share.\n", "Q: ap-hotspot not working A day earlier I messed up with some network-manager configuration files in order to increase wifi range of my ap-hotspot hotspot on Ubuntu 14.04\nEarlier it was working fine, but now I have got some error in it.\non running sudo ap-hotspot start I get Another process running error.

OpenVPN connects fine, but there is a warning saying that route up could not run, and it exits with a status of 1. I can't seem to find what an error status of 1 even is, to start troubleshooting it. The vpn connects, but it tells me:\nWARNING: Failed running command (--route-up): external program exited with error status: 1\n\nThe line right above it says:\ninitctl: Event Failed\n\nbut it is the exact same file that everyone else is using which seems to run fine.

Even if you're not running a VPN server, this change shouldn't matter. The firewall scripts have been written to use tap1, so if you would rather use another device then remember to change those scripts where appropriate.\n\nI'd missed this bit in the instructions, so I hadn't replaced the occurrences of tap1 in each location. Also, I needed to switch from tap to tun, as I was getting warnings about config differences between the local and the remote (PIA). If you have any other issues, you should be able to get more detailed info in the logs for upstart (/var/log/upstart/).\n", "Q: Can't ping my IP address I cant ping my own IP address for my machine running Ubuntu. I have tried to ping the machine with an external VPS but I still have had no luck. I have opened port 80 (TCP) even though I don't think this is necessary. I believe its something to do with my firewall settings but I can't figure it out.\nMany thanks!  \n\nA: ping uses something called ICMP packets, what are completely unrelated to TCP packets, such as the ones carrying an HTTP payload.\nIf you want ping (and other IP protocols that may depend on ICMP) to work, you have to configure the firewall to pass ICMP packets (perhaps filtering only those that are of interest to you, see below) and also the replies that are generated from these packets. (With the right firewall you may also be able to keep state, even though ICMP is essentially stateless. But this is not essential for ping to work.)\nI was going to add the ICMP packet types you want to pass, but they are already discussed on security.se: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/22711/is-it-a-bad-idea-for-a-firewall-to-block-icmp\nIn general, you want something like this (this is super hand-waving, with only the relevant details):\n[Host A] <--(internet or untrusted network)--> [Firewall] <--[Host B]-->\nThe traffic between Host A and Host B is filtered depending on the nature of the traffic, and the state of that traffic. Sometimes Host B and the Firewall are the same. It doesn't really make much difference, as the Firewall itself is sort of a virtual host in some regards.\nFor different types of ICMP payloads can be sent from Host A to a network that it knows is on or behind the Firewall (it doesn't know which, generally). This traffic has to be passed by the Firewall, sent to Host B, and the reply from Host B has to be received as part of that conversation, NATted, and sent back out to Host A.\nSo, this traffic has to be passed going both ways, which sometimes matters to firewalls.\nThe first thing to check is if ICMP packets of the type we are interested in (your references here and in the comments says which ones we care about) are actually being passed by the Firewall and sent on to Host B. There will be some logging or interface of some sort that allows us to inspect and query the Firewall, I'm sure.\nOnce we know this traffic is passing, we need to make sure it is making it to Host B (or passed through to the IP stack on the localhost) and that the reply is also being passed.\nThe details of \"how to make iptables work\" is sort of beyond the scope of this question, but others might have more hints for you. Or perhaps those details may be found in another SO answer.\nOne trick is to save your firewall rules in a file, and create a new ruleset that is basically \"pass everything in and log, NAT everything out and log\" which you enable for testing. Then see if the pings are getting through at all. i.e., prove it is the firewall that is the problem.\n", "Q: Software to record audio for a long time (days) in Ubuntu We have an experiment wherein we need to record audio for a couple of days. Audacity seems to freeze after a few hours. Any other alternative?\n\nA: A graphical frontend may survive for days on a stable machine but there are many reasons why it may stop working. To avoid such side effects let me suggest to use a more low level utility for recording.\nIf there was no need of audio compression we can record using the simple command line tool parec that comes with pulseaudio. We can adjust sample rate or channels, record RAW PCM data or choose from a variety of output containers. Recording is done to a file if specified.\nparec --device=<source> <filename>\n\nThis will record from the specified source device using default settings which can be adapted (see manpage pacat) until it was stopped by keyboard interrupt, TERM or KILL signal, or by closing of the terminal.\nUnfortunately instabilities of Pulseaudio, ALSA, or even the hardware may still occur if we are talking about days. But these will then have adverse effects on all other sound recording tools too.\n\nA: You should use ROTTER for that (it is on the repos).\nIt will record forever and you could ask it to delete the olders.\nIt is configurable by parameters on the command line.\n\nA: Try Audio Recorder it's a small utility for recording audio, you can install it by typing :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:osmoma/audio-recorder\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install audio-recorder\n\nThere is also Ardour it's a powerful digital audio workstation that gives you everything you need to record, edit, mix, and arrange professional audio, you can install it by typing :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:dobey/audiotools\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ardour\n\nOr download it from the download page.\n", "Q: Corrupt external hard disk I was just making a backup with grsync when I accidentally unplugged my external hard drive. \nThe result is that it won't mount again.

I want the list to have two columns: 1) script filename and 2) description text [from the third row's comment, within the script file itself].\nI can make a single-column for a filename-only interface, without a problem.

They're just like any other character.

I installed Ubuntu 14.04 and Apache.\nIt seems I should place my web site files in the \"/var/www/html\" directory.\nBut then where should I place my backend PHP files?\nFor example, if I have web site forms that will on submit make a request to a backend PHP file, should I put the PHP file in \"/var/www/php\" and have, for example, the \"/var/www/html/index.html\" file form action refer to \"../test.php\"?\nI don't want people in general to have access in the browser to my PHP files, which is why I feel they should be above \"/var/www/html\", but if that is the web root, how can \"../test.php\" work?\n\nA: Generally PHP files are meant to be accessed by the general public.  For example, index.php resides in /var/www/html and handles all requests for \"/\".  If your app file is test.php, then try placing it in /var/www/html/test.php and you can browse to it directly.\nAs long as you have mod-php5 loaded and enabled, apache will execute that script instead of returning the source code.\n\nA: I put my PHP files in /usr/share/PROJECT-1.0.1 and symlink /usr/share/PROJECT -> PROJECT-1.0.1.

The hardware is a heavily modified ASUS G75VW 3D. Windows and 32 bit Ubuntu work fine for Wake on LAN. The motherboard has a minor role here, only having some power save settings which I disabled in bios to allow WOL. Then, the NIC has to be configured. On Windows this is a one time setting and it works great. On Ubuntu 32 bit, I used an rc.local trigger for ethtool and it worked great.\nOn 32 bit Ubuntu the network card shows up as eth0 as one might expect. On 64 bit, it get's renamed to enp4s0. I know it's renamed because I checked dmesg, which also says why my rc.local script doesn't change the wol from d to g in ethtool:\n[    1.624275] atl1c 0000:04:00.0 enp4s0: renamed from eth0\n[    3.821446] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): enp4s0: link is not ready\n[    3.822431] atl1c 0000:04:00.0: atl1c: enp4s0 NIC Link is Up<1000 Mbps Full Duplex>\n\nok, whatever. I can deal with the link being not ready, put it on a timer or something for later. But if I set it manually, ethtool says it's showing wol g for the card\nSupports Wake-on: pg\nWake-on: g\n\nFor some reason, this gets reset when I shutdown the computer, because the wol magic packet does not wake the computer even after this.\nTesting\nI've tested a lot of things. First, the wol trigger does not work if the laptop has been unplugged, even briefly. It does work if the ethernet cable has been unplugged and plugged back in. The wol trigger is clearly being set as the OS shuts down because if I shutdown 32 bit ubuntu and swap the hard drives without unplugging, I can WOL into 64 bit ubuntu.\nI suspect it has something to do with the drivers, but I don't know where to get them if that's the case. Then again, can I just run the 32 bit driver on 64 bit and be done with it? I have 32 bit libs on the machine for other purposes.\nI can't solve this by running 32 bit ubuntu, because I run JVMs on the machine that require a large amount of RAM (beyond the 32 bit limit).\nPer the ubuntu help docs I removed network-manager and attempted to configure the connection with ifup (from here). Unfortunately, ifup didn't recognize the interface. Here were the contents of my /etc/network/interfaces file in 64 bit.\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nI don't know why my wireless and ethernet card were not listed there. Here is ifconfig -a.\nenp4s0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 10:bf:48:19:08:b4\n          inet addr:192.168.1.91  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::12bf:48ff:fe19:8b4/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:505 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:289 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:1\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000\n          RX bytes:48646 (48.6 KB)  TX bytes:38816 (38.8 KB)\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback\n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:57 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:57 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\n          RX bytes:8091 (8.0 KB)  TX bytes:8091 (8.0 KB)\n\nwlp3s0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr c4:85:08:70:7d:7b\n          BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000\n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\nSo per a forum post I added enp4s0 manually to the network interfaces file. It now looks like:\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto enp4s0\niface enp4s0 inet dhcp\n\nThen ifup worked. I don't know if I did it right, but all I did was type:\nifup enp4s0\n\nEverything still worked and I could still SSH in after a restart, so I guess I haven't yet broken my ethernet card. I really don't know what I'm doing here guys and I'm grasping at straws.\nI read a little further down the help page and realized I overlooked the link to a bug.\nFollowing the workaround, I added a script to rc6.d and rc0.d and set them to executable but I'm not sure how to check if the actually executed (I guess I could echo something and check dmesg...would that work?). I rebooted the machine once for good measure and powered it down, but it still did not come up with WOL attempts.\nFollowing the rabbit hole I found a comment on a blog post which suggested a more specific static IP address would help. I didn't see why (since magic packet sends to the entire network with a mac address), but I tried it anyway. If my configuration for network interfaces looks like his, there is no change.\nFurther details about the machine. Both 32 bit and 64 bit are on the latest Ubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf.\n\nUpdate\nI have more research.\nI can confirm that WoL works on a fresh install of Wily Werewolf 64 bit.  Following that, I ran:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAnd then WoL stopped working.  That appears to be the only steps necessary to reproduce my issue.\n\nSo again, here's my question:\nHow can I get wake on lan to work in 64 bit Ubuntu?\n\nA: I think I finally found an answer to this problem. In the version 15.10 the TLP utilities has been introduced as default. So on dist upgrade you get a default configuration in TLP saying WOL_DISABLE=Y \nEven https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wake-on-LAN says if the computer does not wake after suspend/hibernate when using TLP, set the WOL_DISABLE value to N in /etc/default/tlp. \nI have tested this on Ubuntu-MATE 16.04 LTS (64bit) where WOL didn't work after installation. Changing the configuration of TLP makes it work again.\nI hope this helps in your problem too. \n\nA: After messing around with the options of the ethernet card, I found a setting in the advanced tab that's called \"Shutdown wake up\" that was disabled for me. I enabled it and now it works! Hope that helps someone else with the same problem. \n", "Q: Convert all audio files to low quality in Ubuntu I just want to convert all the 320kbps in my WALKMAN to 128kbps since they are heavy. Of course, converting all 8GB would be so long, as a .5GB 320kbps album would take half an hour in here. I can wait for 6 hours to convert 3GB, but I can't wait for all 8GB to convert from 128kbps to 128kbps, since the 5GB in it is in 128kbps already. So the question here is how to I force Ubuntu to convert ONLY 320kbps files in my WALKMAN?\n\nA: Here's a way to find all of your mp3 files which are over your specified bitrate and convert them to a lower bitrate.  Be sure to read all the way to the end before starting, because there are two options for the actual transcoding: Clementine or script.\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need to install some packages:\nsudo aptitude install mp3info clementine lame gawk findutils\n\n\n*To make a list of all your music files and their bitrates, execute the following after you replace /path/to/your/music appropriately:\nfind /path/to/your/music -iname '*.mp3' -print0 | xargs -0 mp3info -rm -p '%r:%F\\n' > transcode.kbps\n\nLook at the file transcode.kbps and make sure it looks something like this (bitrate:filename):\n128:/path/to/your/music/dir1/file.mp3\n256:/path/to/your/music/dirX/fileX.mp3\n320:/path/to/your/music/dirY/fileA.mp3\n\n\n*When that looks good execute this awk command, to create a playlist containing only the files higher than a specified bitrate (here all files with bitrate > 160 will be put into the m3u playlist):\nawk -F: '$1 > 160 { print $2; }' transcode.kbps > transcode.m3u\n\nCheck the file transcode.m3u and make sure it looks OK.  When it's good, your ready to transcode!\nClementine Transcode Solution\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Playlist menu, select \"Load Playlist\" and open transcode.m3u.\n\n*Click in the list of your files and type CTRL-A to select all files in the playlist.\n\n*Right-click on the playlist and select the context-menu item \"Add file(s) to transcoder.\"\n\n*Set your desired parameters in the Transcoder window, remember to set the options. Probably you want something like \"Optimize for bitrate 128kbps, constant bitrate, standard quality\".\n\n*Click \"Start Transcoding\"\n\n\nWait for your transcoding to finish.\nThe main problem with using Clementine at least on Ubuntu 10.04 Trusty with Clementine 1.2, the only option is to create a new file alongside the old file.  I think if you have a music player connected, Clementine would let you transcode directly to the music player.\nSince the files you want to convert are already on the music player, that presents a problem, because the new files may fill up your player.\nScript Transcode Solution\nIt's a fairly trivial script to process the transcode.m3u with lame to transcode the files and remove the old files as it goes.  Save this into a file named transcode.sh:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n# transcode.sh -- read filenames from standard input and transcode files\nwhile read file\ndo\n    if lame -h \"$file\" \"$file.new\"\n    then\n            mv \"$file.new\" \"$file\"\n    else\n            rm -f \"$file.new\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nNow you can execute:\nsh transcode.sh < transcode.m3u\n\nand the script will transcode all the files, deleting the old file each time after the new one is successfully created by lame.\nYou can edit the lame command parameters in the transcode.sh script to do any other transcoding parameters you like.\n", "Q: Why is my upgrade fetching speed so slow? This makes me curious...so I'm in the process of upgrading to ubuntu 15.10 [from 15.04], and while it's \"getting new packages\" it's fetching the files at no more than 58 kb/s....no, im not using dial-up, im using a satellite internet connection, which can be pretty bad but this speed is rediculously slow. It's not taking any time to speak of at all to download youtube videos.\nIs there something wrong with the servers im downloading from?\nThanks\n\nA: I'm currently downloading the same update, and it's downloading slightly over 100kb/s while my actual down speed is about six times that right now.\nI'm assuming that as the update just started popping up on everyone's desktop today that lots of people are downloading it right now and so the servers are a little overtaxed. \nThere's nothing \"wrong\" with the servers, it's just that they only have so much capacity.\n\nA: 15.10 was just released recently, as you know. There's quite a bit of data to be downloaded by quite a few different people. Ubuntu actually has a rather large install base across its many official flavors and all the various derivatives that also rely on the same servers.\nPeople have  been seeding since release, if you have the desire to download the .ISO format and to also alleviate the pressure on the servers then you could consider seeding as well.\nA number of people have mentioned seeding in the chat. A not-so-accurate measurement would be my statistics which indicate that Ubuntu is the most sought download, followed by Kubuntu. If you do decide to seed, which is surely appreciated, then those are the two most downloaded files from what I'm able to see. Again, this is hardly a great metric but may help you to decide if you want to help unload some of the traffic from the official servers as I'm sure others are using the bandwidth to download .ISOs instead of just using the upgrade path.\n", "Q: Bumblebee fail safe x after reboot [GTX 755M][Ubuntu 15.10] When I installed bumblebee and the nvidia-340 drivers Ubuntu booted into a normal session.

Big issues. \nLong story long: I got a windows7 computer two-three years ago, and when trying to dual-boot it with ubuntu I accidentally erased windows. Now I really need it, so I tried to reinstall windows, but it wouldn't start on my usb flash drive, and I probably accidentally turned the boot secure on again when I was messing with the boot order. It was kind of ok with ubuntu (it asked for a weird numbers password on startup but it worked), but I thought I'd install debian instead, and so I overwrote ubuntu (having saved my data beforehand). \nNow I have Debian and HDD0, which might be an empty partition. If I try to start it normally it tells me it doesn't have the permissions to start (because of secureboot), the F2 and F10 keys I used before to access the windows boot menu don't work anymore, and if I try to boot it on my multisystem usb drive, the ubuntu liveCD doesn't have the permissions either, the debian install one work for installing, but not for actually using it, the windows one tells me \"can't find command 'drivemap' \" and \"invalid EFI filepath\" (which it seems you need a working os to fix, according to that: http://www.simplehelp.net/2013/07/10/how-to-fix-the-cant-find-command-drivemap-error-after-installing-ubuntu/ ) and all the rest complain about permissions.\n\n\nIt might solve it if I completely overwrite all partitions, including the EFI one (which I probably haven't changed yet), but I'd rather not do it if either you know it'll end up in a disaster, or there is another way. After all, \"it can't get any worse now, I can try whatever I want\" has already been proven wrong a few times in the past day.\nThanks!\n(I know this isn't an Ubuntu-specific question, but it's not really a Debian-specific question either, and I only very rarely, if ever, saw a thread about Debian and dual-boot, while there are lots with Ubuntu. And let's get real, the Windows people won't know anything about it)\n\nA: Secure boot is implemented in the BIOS. Reformatting won't remove it.

My Déjà Dup backups have become quiet large and I noticed they contain a huge number of unnecessary files (e.g. *.pyc files, **__pycache__ folders and other build related temporary stuff). \nI know that I can ignore specific folders, but is there a way to exclude files and or folders by patterns?\nI thought there might be more options usable trough a configuration file, but Déjà Dup doesn't use one. So I looked at duplicity (the CLI it is based on), but the man page doesn't mention a configuration file either. I know that duplicity can ignore files and folders based on patterns (--exclude, --exclude-filelist), but I have no idea how to combine this with Déjà Dup.\nDo I have to ditch Déjà Dup and use duplicity manually? Or is there a way to set the needed options, so that they are used automatically, when duplicity is used by Déjà Dup?\n\nA: You can edit the exclude list like:\ngsettings get org.gnome.DejaDup exclude-list\n# remove comment to execute\n# gsettings set org.gnome.DejaDup exclude-list ['path1', 'path2']\n\nSource: https://answers.launchpad.net/deja-dup/+question/280954\nI tried to add patterns like '**/.git' and '**/build' into that list, like this:\ngsettings get org.gnome.DejaDup exclude-list > exclude-list\ngedit exclude-list\ngsettings set org.gnome.DejaDup exclude-list \"`cat exclude-list`\"\n\nBut to me it seems like the **'s were not passed to duplicity.\nSo instead I ended up doing seaches like\nlocate \"/home/*/.svn\"\nlocate \"/home/*/build\"\n\nand added them to the exclude-list manually\n\nA: There is no way currently with Deja Dup to do advanced filtering like that.

I run Screenshot which automatically update the value. I don't know why, maybe someone else can explain.  \n\n\n\nScreenshots:   \nReplace leo with your user name\n\n \n\nA: I came up with a working workaround for this. The problem seems to be that duplicity does not itself expand wildcards (except for ** apparently) but relies on the shell to do that, and when it is run from deja-dup there is no shell involvement, which is why that now blocks configuring wildcard excludes. Sure, you can use dconf-editor to force them into the saved excludes list, but they don't work (from the monitoring in the script below I actually found that deja-dup would drop excludes containing a '*' and not pass them to duplicity at all).\nTo make it work we need shell expansion of the wildcards. You can do that manually and insert the results via dconf-editor, as suggested here, but this solution does it automatically at backup run time.\nFirst find where duplicity is on your path (\"which duplicity\") then find a path location ahead of it in the path (\"echo $PATH\"). In my case it is /usr/bin/duplicity and /usr/local/bin comes ahead of that, which is perfect. Create a text file named duplicity in that latter path location (e.g. /usr/local/bin/duplicity), make it executable (chmod +x ...) and put this content in there:\n#! /bin/bash\n\n# Shim script run from deja-dup in place of duplicity, to add in file/pattern\n# exclude arguments for duplicity.\n#\n# The excludes are read from ~/.config/deja-dup-excludes (one-per-line).\n\nARGS=\"$*\"\n\nEXCLUDES=$(cat $HOME/.config/deja-dup-excludes | sed -e 's/#.*$//' -e 's/^[ \\t]*//' -e '/^$/d')\n\nif ( echo \"$ARGS\" | grep -q '\\--exclude'); then\n    for EXCL in $EXCLUDES\n    do\n        EXCL_ARG=$(find $EXCL -printf '--exclude %p ')\n\n        ARGS=\"$EXCL_ARG$ARGS\"\n    done\nfi  \n\n#echo \"$ARGS\" >>/tmp/dup.out\n\n/usr/bin/duplicity $ARGS\n\nMake sure that the last line has the correct path for the real duplicity on your machine, and you can un-comment the echo statement if you want to check your work.\nThen create a file .config/deja-dup-excludes under your home directory, with the excludes listed one-per-line, e.g.:\n# Exclude files/patterns for deja-dup\n# (used by the /usr/local/bin/duplicity script).\n\n/home/Ian/core.*\n/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd*\n\nAny lines beginning with a '#' will be taken as comment lines and ignored.\ndeja-dup will now execute that script instead of the real duplicity, and it will add in the necessary --exclude arguments before calling the latter.\nA hack, admittedly, but it works a charm.\n\nA: I am using a variation of Ian Puleston answer, much simplified as the proposed script was not working for me. Refer to his answer, but use this content instead for the duplicity shim script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Shim script run from deja-dup in place of duplicity \n# which forces the exclusions read from ~/.config/deja-dup-excludes \n# using the standard filelist exclusion mechanism\n\n/usr/bin/duplicity --include=$HOME/.cache/deja-dup/metadata --exclude-filelist=$HOME/.config/deja-dup-excludes \"$@\"\n\nThis is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04, and it uses duplicity's standard --exclude-filelist command, which supports some extended shell globbing patterns (for older duplicity versions you can swap it with --exclude-globbing-filelist). It's important that the exclusion appears first in order for everything to work. Be careful with what you exclude, no liabilities accepted, use at your own risk.\nNotes about --include=$HOME/.cache/deja-dup/metadata\n--include=$HOME/.cache/deja-dup/metadata is hardcoded in deja-dups invocation of duplicity. The file is created during backup and used for basic sanity checking, thus required to be included in the backup. If it's not, deja-dup fails with the following error at the end of the backup creation:\n'metadata' file not found when creating backup (\"Could not restore ‘/home/user/.cache/deja-dup/metadata’: File not found in backup\"\n\nThus the --include=$HOME/.cache/deja-dup/metadata argument is required (an must come first) in the above shim script in case your exclusion rules in ~/.config/deja-dup-excludes happen to exclude $HOME/.cache (e.g. via /**/.cache). See the FILE SELECTION section in duplicity's manpage for details.\n\nA: I tried Jacob Nordfalk's method, but it did not work for me (maybe the syntax changed).\nHowever, I was able to change the setting using dconf-editor. You can modify the list at path /org/gnome/deja-dup/exclude-list\n\nA: So I've write a small script to deal with the issue with a .dejadupignore file. But before one dives into this I have to say it is at least as worthwhile to dive into duplicity docs using include_list.txt as Justin Solms' answer suggests and further explained in this post.. \nThe script first fetches the already existing ignores, then uses the locate command on every regex line specified in .dejadupignore and adds all found locations to a single array. It finally calls the gsettings command as proposed by Paul Smith to add all found files to ignore to the DejaDup exclude list. \nA major setback however is the ulimit which defaults to 8192 on Linux. And even after I expanded it, it couldn't deal with the amount of __pycache__ locations as an argument to the gsettings command. \nAnyway, hope it is of use to anyone. \nimport subprocess, os\nfrom ast import literal_eval\nfrom subprocess import PIPE\n\n\nraw_lines = subprocess.run('gsettings get org.gnome.DejaDup exclude-list'.split(' '), stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE).stdout.decode('utf-8')\nignore_lines = literal_eval(raw_lines)\n\nwith open('.dejadupignore', 'r') as f:\n    contents = f.readlines()\n\nlines = [l.rstrip('\\n') for l in contents]\nfor line in lines:\n    line = os.path.expanduser(line)\n    p = subprocess.run([\"locate\", line], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, shell=True)\n    pstring = p.stdout.decode('utf-8')\n    to_ignore = pstring.split('\\n')\n    to_ignore = [i for i in to_ignore if i != '']\n    ignore_lines.extend(to_ignore)\n\ncommand = 'gsettings set org.gnome.DejaDup exclude-list'.split(' ') \ncommand.extend([str(ignore_lines)])\n\nfor line in ignore_lines:\n    print(line)\n\ndef smallfunk():\n    i = input(\"Do you want to add these lines to the DejaDup exclude list? \\n Press 'y' for yes and 'n' for no \\n\")\n    if i == 'y':\n        subprocess.run(command)\n    elif i == 'n':\n        pass\n    else:\n        print('Not an option')\n        smallfunk()\n\n\nsmallfunk()\n\nWith the .dejadupignore file being:\n~/*/venv\n~/*/.pyc\n~/*/git\n~/*/.git\n\n\nA: I successfully achieve exclusion using my include_list.txt file containing:\n- /home/justin/**/.insync-trash\n- /home/justin/**/__pycache__\n- /home/justin/**/*.pyc\n- /home/justin/**/node_modules\n- /home/justin/**/Google Photos\n+ /home/justin/Documents\n- /home/justin/*\n\nThe /**/ is important to match through to any directory depth.\nRule 1: The order is important. First be specific first and general later. \nRule 2: What has already been matched in a line (include or exclude) cannot be changed by subsequent matches in later lines. The documentation mentions this; but in terribly confusing English. Hope mine is better ;) The lines above achieve:\n\n\n*\n\n*Line 1: exclude any __pycache__ at any depth.\n\n*Line 2: exlude any file with extension .pyc.\n\n*Line 6: include my specific and only Documents folder.\n\n*Line 7: exclude all my other home folder such as Pictures, Videos, Downloads, etc. Note that this cannot stop Documents from being included as it was already matched in Line 6! Order matters!\n\n\nA: Get the current exclude list with: \n$ gsettings get org.gnome.DejaDup exclude-list\n\nwhich produces something like: \n['', '/home/me/delete_me', '/home/me/eclipse', '/home/me/Music', '/home/me/R', '/home/me/Videos']\n\nThen set your new list by wrapping the old output in quotes and adding your changes:\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.DejaDup exclude-list \"[ '', '/home/me/delete_me', '/home/me/eclipse', '/home/me/Music', '/home/me/R', '/home/me/Videos', '/home/me/**/.git']\"\n\nand run the get again to verify your changes.\n\nA: This answer is a variation of Daan Koetsenruijter's response who built upon half the thread here and upon LeoZ's response. So this is a remix of most of this thread. I remixed it because I wanted more control over what's going on and don't like a probably little tested (python) script that I can only read somewhat to mess with my settings. That's not critisizing Daan, it's my problem - thanks a lot Daan (and LeoZ, too), you basically solved it for me!\nSo, what I did is write a little command line that dumps the files I want to exclude and copy that to the respective value into the dconf editor (see LeoZ's response!).\nAnd this is an example of such a command line:\nfind /home/myUserName -name node_modules -printf \"'%P',\\n\" | grep -v 'node_modules/.*/node_modules' | sed -e ':a' -e 'N' -e '$!ba' -e 's/\\n/ /g'\n\nThis does three things. The first command, \"find\" finds all directories I want to exclude (node_modules in this case) and formats it into the required format using \"-printf\". Don't do \"find . [...]\" because then the output will also be relative paths but you want absolute (and replace my username, obviously). Note that -printf adds a newline. This is in order to simplify the next command, the newline will be removed with the last command. Depending on your use case, you may simplify this.\nThe second command \"grep\" removes nested node_modules directories, in my case reducing the number of exclude entries from 15,000 to 250 or so.\nFinally \"sed\" removes the newlines again. This can be simplified by not adding the newlines in the first place and using a smarter regExp in grep, but I couldn't be bothered :-)\nI recommend removing the \"sed\" command and reviewing the exclude list first.\nCaveats: If you have ' characters in the file-/dir-names you want to exclude, you need to solve another problem, but dconf editor probably saves you from breaking your settings (it  checks the syntax). I guess there's more that can go wrong, so take care.\nThanks everybody in this thread for your help!\n\nA: Sadly neither Duplicity nor Déjà Dup uses a configuration file :( But there might be a possible workaround, the user @mterry mentioned the following in the bug report linked above:\n\nif you gconf-edit the exclude-list and add patterns like \"**/parts\", the pattern is passed to duplicity and everything works as expected...\"\n\nNow, where are those gconf settings stored these days? \n", "Q: Why my Ubuntu 14.04 does not detect home Wifi?

I'm using sssd to authenticate against an active directory. The passwords for the user may expire after a given time.\nIn sssd.conf you can set [pam] pam_pwd_expiration_warning = X to change the days a message appears prior password expiration. This works e.g. when using sudo or when logging in remotely via ssh.\nIs there a way to display such a message (maybe as notification) after login?\nI'm using Xubuntu 14.04. And it would really help me to see this warning at a prominent position. And the best way IMO would be directly after graphical login.\n\nA: I managed to create a script that works for exactly my problem. Thanks to @kos for the answer - it helped me to show the dialog itself.\nI wrote the script based on this solution but since dscl is not available for me I searched for another way to query the AD. This blog entry helped me to get started and find a solution to get exactly what I was looking for..\nSo here is my script which I then just trigger on session startup:\n#!/bin/bash\npwPolicy=90\nwarnDays=10\nuser=`whoami`\nuserRecord=`ldapsearch -h mydomain.de -b 'dc=mydomain,dc=de' \"(sAMAccountName=${user})\" 2>/dev/null`\nlastpwdMS=`grep -i pwdLastSet <<< \"$userRecord\" | sed 's/pwdLastSet: //'`\ntodayUnix=`date \"+%s\"`\nlastpwdUnix=`expr $lastpwdMS / 10000000 - 11644473600`\ndiffUnix=`expr $todayUnix - $lastpwdUnix`\ndiffdays=`expr $diffUnix / 86400`\ndaysremaining=`expr $pwPolicy - $diffdays`\n\nif [ \"$daysremaining\" -le ${warnDays} ]\nthen\n  zenity --info --title=\"Password expiration\" --text=\"The password for ${user} will expire in ${daysremaining} days.\"\nfi\n\nI'm not familiar with the AD but just try ldapsearch -h mydomain.de -b 'dc=mydomain,dc=de' \"(sAMAccountName=${user})\" 2>/dev/null if it works for you.\nIMO this solution is neither pretty nor usable for other scenarios but it fixes this single problem. I'm still interested if anyone knows how to just show a dialog with the messages that would appear when logging in via ssh.\n\nA: I worked out a simple desktop app for my users in order to solve this issue.

If yes, configure it in your juju environment. Add these lines accordingly:\nhttp-proxy: http://ip:port\nhttps-proxy: http://ip:port\nno-proxy: localhost,127.0.0.1,somethingelse\n\n\nA: I am having the same issue. I found out that juju's lxd subnet can't access the internet, so apt-get update and upgradewere \"completing\" however I wasn't able to see the commands themselves. They will say completed even if apt-get update fails all links. apt-get upgrade will just say everything's ok and nothing more to install, then it'll hang on installing cURL and stuff because while you might have internet access, your subnet doesn't.\nThis Lauchpad answer really helped me and I think I might've solved that issue for myself. I'm 95% sure that it's your subnet not having access to the internet (because remember that lxd creates a subnet for you. 10.x.x.x) but I wasn't able to get to the GUI or ssh into any of those subnet machines which is what tipped me off. Check it out. Run the bootstrap command with --debug and see what happens. For me it just tells me it can't connect to any API adresses, which obviously means no internet on the slave machines.\n", "Q: How to execute a file like \"~/.bashrc\" for bash for ash? I have a board with the default shell being sh. At the end of \"/etc/profile\" there is:\nexec /bin/ash\n\nThis changes the shell to ash.\nWhat should I do if want to execute a file where I defined some aliases in ash?\nI tried using:\nexec /bin/ash -f /root/aliases.sh\n\nBut when I login to the board using ssh it exits saying connection closed.\nAny other way?\n\nA: When you run exec /bin/ash -f /root/aliases.sh ash runs non-interactively, and it exits as soon as \"/root/aliases.sh\" has been executed; that's why the SSH session ends.\nSo the solution is to run the shell interactively; from man 1 ash:\n\nIf the environment variable ENV is set on entry to a shell, or is set in the .profile of a login shell, the shell next reads commands from the file named in ENV. Therefore, a user should place commands that are to be executed only at login time in the .profile file, and commands that are executed for every shell inside the ENV file.\n\nSo just set ENV in \"~/.profile\":\nexport ENV=/root/aliases.sh\n\nand run the shell interactively:\nexec /bin/ash\n\nHowever notice that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running exec /bin/ash at the end of \"~/.profile\" will replace any shell sourcing \"~/.profile\" (i.e. any login shell) with an ash instance;\n\n*This makes no sense. The correct way to get ash as a login shell for an user is to change the login shell for the user, which can be done using chsh.\n\n\nSo I really suggest you to remove exec /bin/ash from \"~/.profile\" and to change the login shell for the user using chsh instead.\n", "Q: How Do I Install Canon MF8000C Printer in Ubuntu 15.10?

Is there anything I need to do in Ubuntu to get it to work?\n\nA: There is a bug in the latest kernels ( https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-utopic/+bug/1507863) that prevents Canon printers from working over a LAN.

So for example the #include <stdio.h> includes the header file from there.\nIf your file is not there, you can use relative paths to specify the location, e.g.\n#include \"main-header.h\"\n\nincludes the main-header.h file from the current working directory.\n\nBy the way, if you install the libnux-4.0-dev package, it should install the headers into /usr/include, and it will also add the binaries, which will be necessary for linking.\n", "Q: How do I get my Wireless connection to work again? {UPDATE: I re-activated the native device driver for my Broadcom Wireless adapter and changed my router settings to broadcast on Channel 5.

I just need to figure out how to get shared directories working between my host machine and a container so I can ditch Virtualbox once and for all.\nI have seen this page: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LXD\nWhich provides instructions, but I just keep getting errors. \nDoes anyone know of any simple, clear instructions to get this working? Any help much appreciated.\n\nA: Here is an updated answer to this question.\nMount the host folder /var/www as /var/test in the container.\nlxc config device add mycontainer vartest disk source=/var/www path=/var/test\n\n\nA: You can assign additional devices to the container, and these can be host-accessible folders.\n$ lxc config ## display help\n...\nlxc config device add [<remote>:]<container> <device> <type> [key=value...]\n    Add a device to a container.\n...\n\nNote that <device> is just an arbitrary name that you assign, which will be used as an ID for subsequent device management.\nFor example, to mount the host folder \"./host\" as \"/mnt/host\" in the container...\nlxc config device add mycontainer vartest disk source=$(pwd)/host path=/mnt/host\n\nThere remains one problem -- if you want this folder to be writable by both the host and the container, the ownership and permissions need to be configured accordingly.  This is complicated by the default mode of LXD which virtualizes the numeric ranges for user and group id values.  There is an easy solution, however: bypass this virtualization by configuring the container to run with host-equivalent privileges...\nlxc config set <container> security.privileged true\n\nThe full host-security implications of this approach are unclear to me at this time, but would seem to be somewhat \"contained\" by the virtualization.  The practical risk depends on how and why you will be using the container.  See technical notes at https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/06/15/custom-user-mappings-in-lxd-containers\nFurther note that this approach probably works best if you normally operate in the container as a non-root user, such as if you attach with...\nlxc exec zesty -- su --login ubuntu\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Additional notes on configuration: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/lxd.html\n\nA: Based on the excellent answer of ph0t0nix, I propose the following step-by-step approach for my Ubuntu 18.04 server:\n\n\n*\n\n*In host determine UID of owner of rootfs:\nsudo ls -l /var/lib/lxd/storage-pools/lxd/containers/webserver/rootfs  \nid -u root   → 100000\n\n*In container determine UID of ubuntu (i.e. user in container):\nid -u ubuntu   → 1000\n\n*Create shared folder in host and add it to container:\nlxc config device add webserver mydevicename disk path=/home/share_on_guest source=/home/share_on_host\n\n\n*Adjust in host UID of shared folder (UID = UID host + UID guest):\nsudo chown 101000:101000 /home/share_on_host\n\n\n*Guest (user ubuntu) has now access to shared folder and can adjust within container access to shared folder using chmod.\n\nA: The instructions on https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LXD that you mention are correct but may need a bit more explanation. \nOn the host you first check the ownership of the directory in which the container data is stored. Run\nsudo ls -l /var/lib/lxd/containers\n\nand check the owner of the container you would like to share the directory with. In my case the uid and gid both were 100000. \nNext, use these to change the ownership of the directory you want to share:\nsudo chown 100000:100000 /tmp/share_on_host\n\nShare the directory with the container in the way you indicated in your comment:\nlxc config device add mycontainer sharedtmp disk \\\n                  path=/tmp/share_on_guest source=/tmp/share_on_host\n\nNow, in the container, you will see that the directory /tmp/share_on_guest (I wouldn't advise to mount your directory as /tmp because that is used by the system for other stuff and has special permissions) is owned by root. From here on you can use chown in the container to change the ownership to the appropriate uid and gid for your user in the container. \nAs a side note, after changing the ownership in the container to e.g. a user with uid 33 you will see on the host that the uid there is now 100033, which makes total sense.\n\nA: I now have a working, safe solution to this issue, using LXD profiles to handle the mapping between UID and GID in the container and on the host.\nA very useful gist may be found here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/bloodearnest/ebf044476e70c4baee59c5000a10f4c8\n", "Q: Did the upgrade leave dependency problems?

I've had the problem before but I reinstalled Ubuntu but now its back again, the last few times it happened I could unfreeze the icon by pressing the power button on my laptop, it would begin moving again but would my laptop would shutdown, this no longer happens so I have to kill my laptop to turn it off. I've just booted in like usual from grub and held down shift to see what happens when it freezes and it stops at this point:\n[OK] Started User Manager for UID 1000.\nIts been at this point for several minutes now. I've tried searching for people with the same problem but their fixes didn't work for me.\n\nA: I've recently had this problem with Ubuntu 15.10. I installed gnome-shell from the Software Centre and after rebooting it froze on bootup. Looking in syslog I saw the exact same message:\n[OK] Started User Manager for UID 1000.\n\nAfter searching around, I found this:\ngdm not working with Ubuntu 15.10\nInstalling ubuntu-gnome-desktop, then running dpkg-reconfigure gdm fixed the problem for me.\n\nA: Using sudo apt-get remove gnome-shell should fix the problem. Worked for me.\n", "Q: \"Package operation failed\" in Ubuntu Software Center This problem occured while installing virtualbox-5.0_5.0.8-103449~Ubuntu~trusty_i386.deb, what should I do?\n\n\nA: When upgrading Virtual Box to a newer major release version (e.g. from 4.x to 5.x) we need to remove the older version first to be able to proceed.\nRemoval of a package depends on how you had installed it. In most cases you can use the Software Center to remove installed packages. In case you had installed Virtual Box from the repositories it is the package virtualbox you will have to remove.\nIf a package is not listed there, or if we had installed it from another source we may also issue the following command in a terminal (for removal of virtualbox 4.0):\nsudo apt-get remove virtualbox-4.0\n\nNote that your settings and your existing virtual machines will stay untouched, they will not be removed.\nAfter that we can safely re-install Virtual Box from a DEB file we had downloaded, or by adding the Oracle repository to our sources, which will always install the most recent version (at present 5.0.8). After upgrading Virtual Box we should also upgrade the Guest Additions in our virtual machines.\n", "Q: Play intro from large collection of songs I'm hoping to find a way to go through a large music collection to find a particular song.\nHowever I do not know the title of the song, artist or album. I was hoping to find an audio player that has a 'play intro' feature, but I've looked at Clementine, Gnome, GMMP, VLC and Audacious but can't find such a feature.\nIs it possible to write a script if no music player does this? I'm using Lubuntu 14.04 - the default music player is Audacious\n\nA: This is pretty easy with a simple shell script. By \"intro\" I've decided 15 seconds is a good time - you can change this of course.\nIt also assumes all the songs are MP3 files, if they're not remove the .mp3 sections.\nFinally, change ~/Music to wherever the songs are saved - e.g. on an external hard drive would be /media/username/hddname/foldername\nintro=15 # Change this to change the played time.\n\nfor filename in ~/Music/*.mp3 ~/Music/**/*.mp3; do  # Remove .mp3 to change type.\n    audacious -H \"$filename\" &\n    echo \"$filename\"\n    sleep $intro\n    audacious -s\ndone\n\nSimply paste this into Leafpad (or your chosen editor) and save it in your home area with a .sh extension.\nThen run these commands, changing filename.sh for what you named it.\nchmod +x filename.sh\n./filename.sh\n\nThe first sets it to be allowed to run, the second will run it. Note that it won't open the window because of the -H option. This is because you are on Lubuntu, and are unlikely to have much memory.\nThis script will print our the name of the file when it starts to play it, so you know what you are listening to.\n", "Q: It says on the desktop that I'm using DreamStudio but I'm not I've just started to notice this.

In Windows, you can use AutoHotKey to make Capslock a standalone key (say, binding it to 'escape') as well as a modifier (so that you can bind, say 'CapsLock + k', to launch a browser).\nI've tried everything under sun to make CapsLock have its own special binding PLUS make it a modifier key in Ubuntu and Xubuntu, and tried various Autokey python scripts, but it seems this is not possible on Ubuntu/Xubuntu?\nAm I wrong? Does anyone know a way this could be possible?\n\nA: Try this in a console:\nsetxkbmap -option caps:none\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 66 = Multi_key';\n\nThan your Caps-Lock work as a Compose key.\nIe: If you hit successively:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compose, o, then e will render \"œ\",\n\n*Compose, o, then r will render \"®\",\n\n*Compose, 3, then 4 will render \"¾\",\n\n*Compose, o, then / will render \"ø\",\n\n*Compose, +, then - will render \"±\",\n\n*Compose, s, then s will render \"ß\",\n\n*...\n\n\nAnd so on.\n\nA: I finally found my solution with the Xcape which allows you to send key events when modifier keys are released on his own.\n\nA: If you install gnome tweak-tool, you can redefine Caps-Lock from the Typing tab.\nYou can make it for instance an Escape or Ctrl. I've turned it into a BackSpace.\nYou can install it using:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04.\n", "Q: \"insufficient free space\" error when trying to create new logical volume?

The containers do not seem to be able to access the network until I restart the docker service.\nAfter booting the host the docker0 interface does not have any IP address.\n$ ifconfig docker0\ndocker0   Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr ea:03:cc:9c:7a:cd\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:2 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:108 (108.0 B)\n\nIf I then start a container the docker0 interface only gets an ipv6 address and no network connection is possible from the container as far as I can tell.

I'm using the ubuntu:trusty image and running bash as the container's main process.\n$ ifconfig docker0 \ndocker0   Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:00:00:00:00\n          inet6 addr: fe80::7801:6eff:fe86:6dd8/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:14 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:25 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:704 (704.0 B)  TX bytes:3917 (3.9 KB)\n\nIf I restart docker then docker0 gets an ipv4 address (in addition to the ipv6 address) and everything works as expected.\n$ sudo service docker restart \n$ ifconfig docker0\ndocker0   Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:00:00:00:00\n          inet addr:172.17.42.1  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.0.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::7801:6eff:fe86:6dd8/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:14 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:25 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:704 (704.0 B)  TX bytes:3917 (3.9 KB)\n\nOf course I can restart the docker service every time I restart my machine, or probably hack a startup script to do it for me (I have not tried). Does anyone know of a clean way to fix this?\n\nA: TL;DR: I had installed Docker using \"apt-get install docker.io\". Installing the latest version following https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/ fixes the issue.\nAfter investigating the problem it appears that the version of Docker in 15.10 cannot both create and initialize the docker0 interface correctly. On the first run (service docker start) it will create the interface but fail to initialize it, and on the subsequent run (service docker restart) it will initialize it. This can be reproduced consistently adding and deleting the interface manually with brctl. This bug has been fixed in the latest Docker.\n\nA: To me it's NetworkManager that messes up. Docker service creates bridge as it should then exposes it on dbus. NetworkManager kicks in seeing new interface on dbus and try to configure it (since it's stupid enough to know that bridge docker0 is already configured fine). NetworkManager sometimes succeeds configuring (re-configuring) docker0 but sometimes it will fail. So sometimes you reboot box and docker0 will have IP assigned, other times it will not.\nTo stop NetworkManager messing up add \niface docker0 inet manual\n\nto /etc/network/interfaces assuming NetworkManager.conf has \n[ifupdown] managed=false\n\nwhich is default on 15.10\n(bug should probably be raised to stop NetworkManager from messing up docker specific interfaces)\n", "Q: Line 6 POD X3 Functionality is there any way to install Line 6 POD X3 drivers on latest Ubuntu version so that I can start recording my band tracks?\nIf so, what's the current best recording-app choice for doing so?\nThanks, first time in the AskUbuntu community!\n\nA: I have not tried this, but I found these instructions here. The link is a couple of years old but the software is still there.\nFirst, some build tools are installed, such as Subversion (svn) for version control. Subversion then pulls the latest stable version of the driver from the Internet and places it in a separate directory line6usb. The next step is to build the driver and install it. If everything works, feel free to remove Subversion and the other build tools.\nsudo apt-get install gcc make subversion alsamixergui linux-headers-generic\nsudo svn co https://line6linux.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/line6linux/driver/trunk line6usb`\ncd line6usb\nsudo make install\n\nThen you have to find your soundcard with:\ncat /proc/asound/cards\n\nThis tells you how your Line 6 device viewed by the computer ('hw:' number). Replace 'hw:1' with whatever shows up for your sound card when you type:\nalsamixergui -D hw:1\n\nYou HAVE to turn the 'monitor' slider all the way down or things will crash (unless the 'svn' site has a newer version that fixes this).\n\nA: In case someone needed an up-to-date link, here's a link to the repo:\nsvn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/line6linux/code/ line6linux-code\n\nsvn can be installed by \nsudo apt install subversion\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04, Docker(left sidebar) does not show in auto hide mode on Virtual Box I have never used Linux before and I want to switch to Linux Ubuntu.

It takes me to shell aks or something like that.\nI even tried to upgrade it to same OS. While in the process of upgrading it showed that no operating systems were detected, and I rolled back. Then I made a USB bootable stick and tried the \"try Ubuntu\" but it said partition cannot be mounted. I even took out my laptop's hard disk and connected it to another Ubuntu machine (as a external hard drive ) but it only showed me the grub files not my hard disk files.\n\nA: There are two possibilities of encryption within Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Full disk encryption\n\n\nIt means that the whole disk is encrypted. Immediately after starting (right after booting the kernel) you are prompted for a password. It looks like this: http://imacify.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Ubuntu-FDD-lock-Screen.jpeg\nThis does not seem your case, because your problem happens later in the booting sequence.\nAnyway, this guide shows you how to access an encrypted volume using a Ubuntu Live CD or USB stick. You should be able to recover some data and copy them over to another disk. Good luck :)\nhttps://alvinabad.wordpress.com/2012/09/22/how-to-recover-a-luks-encrypted-disk/\n\n\n*Home folder encryption\n\n\nIn this case, home partitions are encrypted on a per-user basis.\nHere are a few resources for you:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/116297/how-to-recover-an-encrypted-home-directory-on-ubuntu/\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory\nYou should try to recover your data first.

theoretically possible to adapt the code to that kernel, but IMHO it is not worth the effort.\nYour device is fully supported by kernel 4.2.

Currently each machine has it's own username, but the same UID. For arguments sake, machine 1 has a user mac1, with a UID of 1000, and machine 2 has a user mac2, with a UID of 1000. People advise me that in order to lock down permissions on my file shares, it's good practise to create the same user account on both machines along with the same UID. So I was thinking that on machine 1 I need to keep user mac1, UID 1000, but create user mac2, UID 1001. Then on machine 2 I need to create user mac1, UID 1000, and change user mac2 to UID 1001. However, as it stands both user mac1 (on machine1) & mac2 (on machine 2) are using UID 1000,. So I will need to change the UID of mac2 on machine 2 to be 1001 instead. I've never changed my UID, so I'm worried that other stuff might stop working. Can anyone see some obvious pitfalls I'm going to run into by doing this?\n\nA: Don't change the user ID on these hosts! This is a brittle operation that will require all kinds of maintenance, and introduce many subtle problems.\nLet the NFS server hosting the exports do the UID mapping for you.\ne.g.: https://serverfault.com/questions/520276/nfs-user-mapping\nThe tricky part is what version of nfsd is being used, and the specific implementation. I'd start with the man page for Ubuntu nfsd and see if it talks about it, or if it needs another daemon running  that maps IDs.\nIt looks like the best reference for this is here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo\nBut, the take-away is that you should let the daemon(s) handle this for you, and not try to maintain the same UIDs across all hosts, which is difficult and error-prone (and may not actually work as you need it to, anyway.)\n", "Q: BOTH Broadcom controllers disabled I have Trusty Tahr (Ubuntu 14.04) and the usual advice on proprietary drivers is not working. In 'Additional Drivers' it says about the Broadcom drivers \"This device is not working\". So I do some lspci -nn and find I have Wireless 14e4:4311 (rev 01) and Ethernet 14e4:170c (rev 02). I have googled what to do about reinstalling either of these, but all the answers require 'apt-get update', but I can not run any of these lines if both drivers are not operational. \nThanks for any pointers,\narray\n\nA: Please open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nReboot. Your ethernet should now be working. Next, do:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nDetach the ethernet, reboot once again and all should be working.\n", "Q: Can I make Ubuntu's windows frame edges rectangular and not rounded? I want to ask can I make Ubuntu's Windows edges rectangular like the Windows OS windows and not rounder like they are on default. I am running Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: You could use another theme, like Numix (available in the shimmer-themes package I think).\nThen you use unity-tweak-tool to select that theme, which you can install from the Software Center.\nThe Numix theme is an example.\nYou can find a lot of GTK themes on the internet. After downloading a theme, create a folder named .themes in your home folder if it doesn't exist already (it will be a hidden folder) and extract the theme to there.\n", "Q: Old Ubuntu Desktop Failing to Update (Failed to fetch) My colleagues and I are attempting to run some updates on a computer with Ubuntu 12.10, which has been unused for some time.

At the moment, we have about 500 to install :(\nHow would we go about fixing this problem? Thanks for the assistance.\n\nA: Quantal has passed end-of-life and is no longer distributed on the main Ubuntu mirrors.  (If you try loading those URLs in your web browser, you'll find they really are 404 - nothing to do with Ubuntu being able to handle \"large amounts of updates\".)\nEdit your /etc/apt/sources.list to replace us.archive.ubuntu.com with old-releases.ubuntu.com, which is a site that still hosts this old software.  For repositories that contain software that is not part of core Ubuntu (security.ubuntu.com, ppa.launchpad.net, dl.google.com, etc), you may want to simply comment them out from /etc/apt/sources.list or the corresponding files in sources.list.d, and then re-enable them once you have upgraded to a currently supported version.\nSince such old versions are not supported and likely have security bugs that are not being patched, you will probably want to upgrade to a current version ASAP.  Note that you will have to do several upgrades in succession: to 13.04, then 13.10, 14.04.  You can stay there if you want as 14.04 is a long-term-support release which is still supported.

See the answer here: (Ubuntu 16.04 Skylake overheating)\nInstead of kernel 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4.2 in the other answers here you should upgrade to kernel 4.8.10 which has good reviews / improvments:\ncd /tmp\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.8.10/linux-headers-4.8.10-040810_4.8.10-040810.201611210531_all.deb\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.8.10/linux-headers-4.8.10-040810-generic_4.8.10-040810.201611210531_amd64.deb\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.8.10/linux-image-4.8.10-040810-generic_4.8.10-040810.201611210531_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\nsudo reboot\n\nAfter installing the new kernel you can try to roll out grub command line changes for nomodeset, i915.preliminary_hw_support=1, etc. you fudged to make earlier kernels and drivers work.\nPlease note kernel version 4.9 LTS will be out soon. We all hope Intel fixes the pstate / cstate / thermald issues plaguing many of us in the LTS kernel release.\n\nA: I had the same issue, that I wasn't able to install Ubuntu 15.10 on my new Thinkpad. Therefore I add here my solution to the problem, because it could help someone.

But to enable the touch and digitizer I need to add i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 .\n\nA: I have written a manual for the black screen boot issues and enabling working wi-fi for Ubuntu 15.10:\nhttp://www.ambience.sk/dell-xps13-touch-9350-ubuntu-black-screen-boot-wifi/\nIf you have the latest Dell XPS13 Touch (9350) with Skylake and Intel Graphics i915 running Ubuntu 15.10 (or any other version such as 15.04 or 16.04), you will need to make some changes to make it boot safely without running into the black screen issues. Also, you will enable wifi this way.\nTo install Ubuntu (Kubuntu or any other distro or flavor), you will need an UEFI-enabled Linux distro.\nTo enable wifi you need the latest (4.4+) kernel. To ensure smooth and working booting via GRUB, you will need to enable some modules and update GRUB2 parameters.\nLinux UEFI Installation on Dell XPS13 (9350)\n\n\n*\n\n*Press F2 on booting (while the Dell logo is displayed) and enter the UEFI BIOS.\n\n*Go to General -> Advanced Boot Options and set to disable all.\n\n*Go to System Configuration -> SATA Operation and change to AHCI.\n\n*Go to Secure Boot -> Secure Boot Enable and switch to Disabled.\n\n*Go to POST Behavior -> Fastboot and set to Thorough.\n\n*Additionally (after the install), you can change General -> Boot Sequence to whatever order you prefer and add GRUB2 – choosing EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi.\n\n*After the installation of Ubuntu (or any other Linux is done), update it to the latest kernel to make wifi work on Dell XPS13 (9350), e.g. 2015 and 2016 models.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest stable kernel (e.g. 4.4.2)  \nFirst, you will need to upgrade your kernel to 4.4.2 to support both wifi and Intel i915 graphics:\nwget in4serv.com.br/backup/kernel-4.4.2\nsudo chmod +x kernel-4.4.2\n./kernel-4.4.2\n\n\n*Add modules to initramfs\nYou will need to edit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules file by running sudo nano /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and add these two modules to booting process:\ni195\nnvme\n\n\n*Changing GRUB2 options\nChange the grub2 booting options by running sudo nano /etc/default/grub and editing these lines:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash i915.preliminary_hw_support=1\"\nGRUB_GFXMODE=\"1024x768\"\n\nThe last line is your preferred resolution, otherwise GRUB will use the maximum UHD resolution that is hard to read. Also, don’t use any 16:9 resolution as GRUB seems to have issues with those. Just use any 4:3 ratio screen resolution.\nNow you will be able to boot into Ubuntu without an issue.\n\nA: Problem\nI was experiencing the same issue on a ThinkCentre m900 SFF with a i7-6700 CPU. The system would freeze randomly and a hard reset was required, which rendered working with that system a pain if not impossible. The log only showed a lockup state of the CPU, but did not provide extensive information as the logging was frozen as well.\nResearch\nThis issue is probably related to the power states the Skylake processor, which are not compatible with Kernels from the 4x series yet.\nSolution Attempts\nI tried setting the boot parameter intel_idle.max_cstate=1, as suggested here and here and here. This did not have a positive effect and the system continued to freeze every few hours.\nI also installed newer kernels in Ubuntu 16.10, including Kernel 4.8 which should support the Skylake CPUs, but still the problem remained and the system freezed. I also tried Mint 18.0, Mint 18.1, Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 16.10. All systems showed the same behavior, which - in retrospective - was not surprising as they are all Xenial based, but I tried to exclude the Window Manager from being a cause. I disabled the on-board GPU and only used the Nvidia card and vice versa to exclude the GPU as a cause. I disabled UEFI and reinstalled with a legacy BIOS, same effect.\nWorkaround Solution\nLenovo certified the system for Ubuntu 14.04 officially, see here. As a last try, I reinstalled the older version of Ubuntu, which appeared before the CPU was released. I did not expect the 3.x Kernel to work, but as a surprise I am now running Mint 17.3 Rosa, based on Trusty (14.04.05 LTS) and have security updates until early 2019. I hope the problem is resolved until then, so far I had no more freezes.\n", "Q: Ubuntu thinks I'm on Kali So I installed Kali repos on Ubuntu.

It seems to me that the card has some limitation when in master mode. \nAny clue?\nWifi adapter intel 7260, Ubuntu 14.04, driver iwlwifi\n\nA: When your wireless card is in master mode it acts as an access point and it actively transmits a signal. When your wireless card is in client mode or managed mode then it listens to signals and tries to match a suitable one. Usually wireless cards built-in into devices like laptops are limited in signal strength either in the hardware or in the software and they are tiny and lack an antenna of a reasonable size. Regular consumer routers usually are not limited in signal strength or are limited in a wrong way because they're built in a different country and they do have a big antenna. All this allows consumer routers to produce a stronger signal and their range is larger. So your observation is pretty normal. Also there are certain problems regarding the wireless frequency and the type and number of other wireless networks in the area.\n", "Q: Can't Boot from Disk or Thumb device I have an old Gateway PC running Windows 10.

BIOS Settings? I would like to do a clean installation of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on an HP Pavilion G6 - 2399sa laptop. The laptop has Windows 10 installed. I want to format the HDD after running a live Ubuntu DVD and completely replace Windows 10 with Ubuntu. Should I change the BIOS settings from secure boot to legacy? I understand the boot order also needs to be changed to boot from the DVD first. When should these changes to the BIOS settings be made? I am very new to Linux and I don't have any technical experience. I did manage to install Linux Mint on another similar laptop that had Windows wiped, so there was no OS at all. The difference here is that Windows 10 is still installed on this laptop. If I allow the Ubuntu installation disk to format the HDD, would I have trouble booting up Ubuntu if I don't change the BIOS settings in advance?\n\nA: First you're conflating two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot mode (BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFI/UEFI) -- The vast majority of modern computers ship with EFI firmware, which boots natively in EFI mode. That firmware usually (but not always) provides a Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables the computer to boot BIOS-mode boot loaders. Using CSM is sometimes referred to as \"legacy mode.\" (I assume that's what you meant by \"legend.\")\n\n*Secure Boot -- This feature is one optional part of UEFI. Thus, it cannot be used with a BIOS-mode boot; but as it's optional, it does not need to be used in an EFI-mode boot, either. At least, not always -- a manufacturer could theoretically link the two so that EFI-mode booting requires use of Secure Boot. I've seen reports of machines that do this, but I'm skeptical -- firmware user interfaces are so complex, and often so poorly designed, that it's easy to get confused and misunderstand what feature are and are not linked together. In any event, even if some machines link them, most don't -- you can boot in EFI mode with or without Secure Boot enabled.\n\n\nFor a single-OS installation, it doesn't make much difference whether you boot in BIOS mode or in EFI mode. BIOS mode is likely to be more familiar to you if you've installed OSes in the past; but because the CSM is an add-on to modern firmware, performing a BIOS-mode installation actually complicates the boot path. An EFI-mode installation is likely to boot slightly more quickly than a BIOS-mode installation, but this difference will not be huge. There are more boot loader options for EFI-mode than for BIOS-mode, but Ubuntu uses GRUB by default for both boot modes.\nIf you go with an EFI-mode installation, you have the choice of using Secure Boot vs. not using it. In theory, there are advantages to Secure Boot, since it can block pre-boot malware from getting a grip on your computer. In practice, I have yet to hear of any widespread attacks that might be stopped by Secure Boot -- but such an attack might become common tomorrow. OTOH, Ubuntu's Secure Boot support adds complexity to the boot process and doesn't work on all computers -- a few just don't work with Ubuntu's tool (called \"Shim\"). Overall, if you go with an EFI-mode boot, I recommend you leave Secure Boot disabled unless you can't get your boot process to begin, in which case you might disable this feature. Note that if you get as far as an Ubuntu logo, you've passed the Secure Boot hurdle.\nIf you were to dual-boot, the first rule is to ensure that both OSes boot in the same mode. Since almost all computers that ship with Windows 8 and later boot Windows in EFI mode, that normally means installing Ubuntu in EFI mode. If you think you might re-install Windows in the future, you might be constrained to an EFI-mode boot, depending on how you install Windows. (Media provided by your computer's manufacturer might support only EFI-mode installations, but Microsoft's standard media support both boot modes.)\n\nA: During the Linux installation options, there is quite a bit of flexibility/control over how the disk is prepared.\nCertainly one of the easiest is to overwrite the entire disk which would obliterate HP's recovery information as well as any existing installed operating systems.\nOther options are to install Linux into a separate partition which automatically activates boot loader (GRUB I think for Ubuntu) options to selectively boot an operating system.  However, the partition holding Windows probably occupies basically the whole disk.  There are disk tools (like from Paragon) which resize a Windows partition and doing the right thing inside the NTFS volume to make it work right—if there is free space inside the volume.\n\nA: Additionally when you want to boot back into Windows, if you keep that OS, you have to re-enable secure boot in BIOS to get back to that OS\n", "Q: Why I can not scroll by my thinkpad usb keyboard's trackpoint after I upgrade Ubuntu from 15.04 to 15.10 Just after I upgrade the ubuntu from 15.04 to 15.10.

Technical\nDual Boot\nInstalling both Ubuntu and another Operating system (or version of Ubuntu) on the same computer. This can be achieved by installing on separate hard drives, or by partitioning one hard drive.\nWhen installing Ubuntu, the current operating systems should be detected, and it will offer to install Ubuntu alongside it:\n\nImage to installation types\nFlavour / Distribution / Distro\nUbuntu is open source, which means anyone can take the code and change it or modify it and give it to other people. Some distributions include Ubuntu GNOME, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu Touch for mobile. The whole list can be found here.\nArchitecture\nThe processor type - 32 or 64 bit. This determines the download - either i386 or amd64.\n64 bit processors can run 32 bit operating systems and programs, but not the other way round. Most modern computers are 64 bit, hence this is the recommended type to download.\nTerminal / Command Line / TTY** and **Commands\nThe terminal is the graphical interface to the command line, with which you can execute commands.\n\nThis could be launching an application like firefox, removing a file with the rm command or searching through a file with cat and grep or sed.\nTTY is also a command line - just a non graphical one. Note that you have to login to use this one. In fact, you do with the Terminal - you did it when you signed into your account.\n\nBash and Shell\nBash is the default shell in many Linux distributions. It stands for Bourne-Again SHell, and is Bourne shell with many additions. Shell is a command interpreter that executes commands.\nBIOS\nThis is Ubuntu independent - the BIOS is built into every computer for setting up the basics - like choosing which hard drive to use and power management.\nRepository\nA repository is a software archive with programs that support Ubuntu in them. These are split into Main, Restricted, Universe and Multiverse. These simply contain different classes of programs - for example Multiverse is paid software, and Main is supported by Canonical.\nSee the Ubuntu Wiki for more information\n3. General Jargon\nRelease(s)\nReleases, or versions are each new iteration of Ubuntu. Currently, a new version is released every 6 months, in April and October. The version number (for example 14.04) tells you when it was released:\n\nThey also have a codename - for example 14.04 is Trusty Tahr. 14.10 was Utopic Unicorn - they go down the alphabet.\nLTS - Long Term Support** also **LTS Release\nLTS stands for Long Term Support. ¼ of Ubuntu releases are LTS releases - once every 2 years. The cycle is a follows:\n16.04 - April 2016, LTS\n16.10 - October 2016\n17.04 - April 2017\n17.10 - October 2017\n18.04 - April 2018, LTS\n18.10 - October 2018\n19.04 - April 2019\n19.10 - October 2019\n20.04 - April 2020, LTS\n\nThe version numbers are simply examples. LTS releases are supported for 5 years from the release date (meaning you can upgrade to the next LTS release, or even the one after that). A non LTS release is supported for 9 months, so you have time to get the next release before it is EoL (see below).\nSupported means it gets security and other updates from canonical. It is highly recommended that you use a supported release.\nEoL - End of Life\nWhen a release is no longer supported, it becomes End of Life. See above for what changes.\nOpen source\nUbuntu is open source. This means the source code of it is available for modification or enhancement by anyone.\nPackage Manager\nThe package manager (DPKG in Ubuntu) is a built-in utility designed to streamline app management. You can browse, install, and remove software with this.\nThe software centre uses this - it's a graphical interface for dpkg.\nRoot and sudo\nRoot is the equivalent of Administrator in Windows. It has the power to do anything - like erase the hard drive, change config files and adjust the time.\nIn Ubuntu, there is no \"root\" user. Instead, sudo is used. Any command with \"sudo\" before it (for example sudo nano) will be executed as root.\nUsers in the \"sudoers\" list can execute sudo commands.\nThe root home directory is simply /root - it is not found in /home/root.\n\nAny images not attributed are created by a contributor to this post.\n\nA: Much of the jargon that you hear related to Ubuntu may as well be shared with other Linux distros, such as launcher, shell, terminal, release - all these can be found in other distros as well.\nWhat I would suggest you do is pick up a book related to Ubuntu, such as Ubuntu Unleashed, The Official Ubuntu book, or Ubuntu Linux Toolbox, and read through them; as you read you will pick up all the necessary vocabulary.\nComing back to general distro information, I would suggest learning what makes Ubuntu different from other distros - such as package-managers ( Ubuntu uses apt and dpkg, while Fedora and RHEL used to have rpm and yum , Arch uses pacman), default init system ( prior to 15.04 release Ubuntu used upstart, but now is switching to systemd ), desktop environment and desktop manager ( one is the actual desktop, such as Unity for Ubuntu, but the other is login screen such as lightdm), client vs server. \nA big portion of using any Linux system is terminal , which is similar to Windows' command line ( cmd.exe ), but much more powerful and flexible. Use UNIX Shells by Example by Ellie Quigley - this book helped me a great deal in learning command line. You will pick up vocabulary such as variables, shell , terminal emulator, regex , and will learn about many useful tools such as find, xargs , for and while loops, awk, sed,. \n", "Q: Backporting a package from an unreleased release? If I attempt to backport a package using a command similar to the following:\nbackportpackage -s xenial -d vivid ...\n\nI end up with an error:\nbackportpackage: Error: Unknown release codename xenial\n\nUbuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) has been announced but not released yet. How can I backport packages from it?\n\nA: The list of valid releases accepted by backportpackage is stored in /usr/share/distro-info/ubuntu.csv (from the package distro-info-data ).\nTo add a release, open the file and add a line to the bottom like this:\n...\n15.10,Wily Werewolf,wily,2015-04-23,2015-10-29,2016-07-29\n16.04 LTS,Xenial Xerus,xenial,2015-10-22,2016-04-21,2021-04-21\nbackportpackage should now accept the release.\n", "Q: Multi-Core Encoding with VP9 FFmpeg I want to start using the WebM format and the VP9 codec for my YouTube videos. I know that with good compression comes slow speed, but FFmpeg only uses 1 of my 8 cores. I've tried using -threads 8 in my command, but FFmpeg seems to ignore it. From what I've read, the VP9 encoder should support multiple threads. What can I do to get this to work?\nFFmpeg version 2.7.2-1build1\nlibvpx1 version 1.3.0-3ubuntu1\nlibvpx2 version 1.4.0-4\n\nCommand used:\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 10 -b:v 5000k -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n\nWhile we're at it, do I need both libvpx packages installed? libvpx2 has the Ubuntu icon next to it in Synaptic, so I'm guessing the other one is a leftover from upgrading to 15.10?\n\nA: Thanks for the info about order of options @bodhi.zazen and @LordNeckbeard. Apparently the libvpx encoder is a little more picky about that. When I added -threads option after -c:v libvpx, it visibly uses more cores according to top.\n-threads 0 only uses 1 core, -threads 8 uses 2 cores, and -threads 16 uses 4 cores. I've tried using a higher number, but the encoder says more than 16 threads is not recommended, and doesn't use any more CPU. Encoding speed itself is about twice as fast now. Thanks again for the help!\n\nA: For a server with 16 CPUs, you can try this options:\n-threads 16 -slices 16 -cpu-used -4\n", "Q: I dual booted ubuntu 14.04 alongside side win7, both 64bit, theres no boot menu So last night I decided to take the plunge and try Linux for the first time, so I found a tutorial to dual boot ubuntu 14.04, alongside win7, I created a live usb, shrank my computers (its a homebuilt)  HDD to free up space, then ran the ubuntu installer, selected the unallocated space partition for the install, didn't worry about a swap partition because I have 6gb of RAM, everything seemed to install correctly, computer restarted, and booted straight to ubuntu, restarted, same thing, no boot menu or anything, just straight to ubuntu, I even changed the boot priority in BIOS around, still only goes straight to ubuntu. how can I get the boot menu on startup? or even get windows to boot some other way? \nsorry for the long winded n00b question. \n\nA: You could always give the tried-and-true program boot-repair a try.

First of all, I would suggest that you check if root has enough space (a complete installation with all the components need about 11GB, IIRC) since the mount point is created inside the root folder and therefore, the root folder should have the requisite space.  Also, I would suggest that you first install it in a simple folder, for example /home/user/MATLAB.

I've set up vsftpd so that access is given to regular chrooted users on the system.

Assuming it's a base build that you pick from a list, this should go quickly. It may be a pain to re-configure, but recovery from a security breach is even more troublesome. Passwords do not change themselves. Thelinux distros I've used do not change passwords autonomously. It takes interaction with the passwd program, or a scripted process to alter a password. Ubuntu has no out of the box functionality that would change a users password.\nThe more complicated answer lies down two possible approaches. \n1. Your hosting provider almost always has a user with sudo, or access to root. It is possible to run a routine that checks hashes against a rainbow table (defined dictionary of insecure password hashes) and if a weak one is found, set it to a randomly generated password. I don't currently recall, but I think this functionality is present in cpanel, as an option.\n\n\n*An agent, either a user or a third party is resetting it and not communicating that with you. Passwords generally can't be changed using a file transfer protocol, unless they can write to the password file and that's not default behavior.\n\n\nIf you re-initialize the instance/droplet - find out if you can install some intrusion detection. https://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/what_is_hips.php This will tell you if there is some malfeasance going on.\nGenerally, FTP is not secure, even though it is SFTP you're running. scp/ssh is a better solution, but more complicated to setup. A huge swath of the results I've examined from various HIDS show FTP (21) as a probed target.\nBest Regards,\nVincent\n", "Q: cannot install fglrx I have a problem on 14.04. after switching back and forth between the open and closed source video drivers, when I try switch back to AMD/ATI proprietary driver I get an error saying:\nThe package system is broken use apt-get install -f (The following packages have unmet dependencies:\nfglrx-amdcccle-updates: Depends: fglrx-updates but it is not installed).\n\napt-get install -f results in the further error:\n(Reading database ... 295376 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack .../fglrx-updates_2%3a15.200-0ubuntu0.5_amd64.deb ...\nMoving ati dir to /etc for the fglrx-core transition\ndpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/fglrx-updates_2%3a15.200-0ubuntu0.5_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n subprocess new pre-installation script returned error exit status 1\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI am a new to ubuntu and loving it but this is really frustrating, any help would be really appreciated (will need guidance for terminal commands). \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Sometimes, graphics/video drivers can run into problems unless you stop all display manager services and/or kill Xorg before installing the new drivers. If you also switch between versions of drivers, sometimes configuration files are not completely removed and can conflict with different versions that you try to install later. (\"completely removed\" = \"purged\")\nStop your display manager\nThis step may not always be necessary, but it's sometimes cleaner or safer to stop all display managers before installing graphics card drivers.\nFirst, close all your work that's open in windowed programs because stopping the display manager will kill them all without saving any open work. Then, switch to a TTY by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 (or any of F1 through  F6). The display server uses F7 by default for its GUI interface. Log in on the TTY, and type this to see which display managers are running:\npgrep dm -l\n\nYou should see one or more of the following: lightdm, gdm, kdm, xdm. If pgrep doesn't work, try:\nps -eo pid,comm | grep dm\n\nOr search for those names with the htop or top commands.  To stop the active display managers, type:\nsudo service <name_of_display_manager> stop\n\nFor example: sudo service lightdm stop\nOlder versions of Ubuntu may not have the service command and instead use init.d scripts:\nsudo /etc/init.d/<name_of_display_manager> stop\n\nOr require you to kill each of the processes by typing:\nsudo kill <PID_of_display_manager>\n\nThe PID is the \"process identification\" number. It is returned in the output from pgrep or is listed in a column in htop or top. If kill fails, try forcing it with the -9 flag: sudo kill -9 <PID>\nStop or kill each of the display managers until none are running. Older versions of Ubuntu may also require you to kill all Xorg processes:\nxkill -a\n\nCompletely remove your graphics driver packages\nBasically, purge the driver packages rather than simply remove them. I had an error like yours that was resolved by purging the old driver packages. In the TTY, type the following:\nsudo apt-get purge <name_of_package> [name_of_package]...\n\nFor example:\nsudo apt-get purge fglrx fglrx-core fglrx-amdcccle fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates\n\nI, personally, have only the first three of those installed as I suspect most people would because those are officially listed on AMD's Drivers and Support site.\nPurging will remove all of the packages' configuration files outside of /home along with the packages, themselves.  (Typing remove instead of purge will only remove the packages and not their configuration files. See also: What is the Difference Between `apt-get purge` and `apt-get remove`? \nOlder versions of apt-get do not have the purge command and instead use a --purge flag with remove like so:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge <name_of_package> [name_of_package]...\n\nAfter purging, install the replacement versions of the packages that were just purged:\nsudo apt-get install <name_of_package> [name_of_package]...\n\nOr if you have DEB files, install those:\nsudo dpkg -i <deb_filename> [deb_filename]...\n\nRestart your display manager\nIf there are no errors, either restart your display manager or reboot:\nsudo service <name_of_display_manager> start\n\nOn older versions of Ubuntu:\nsudo /etc/init.d/<name_of_display_manager> start\n\nOr to start Xorg:\nsudo xinit start\n\nOr reboot:\nsudo shutdown -r 0\n\nAny of those ways should take you to the GUI interface again running on the drivers you just installed.\n", "Q: How to update dual boot screen?

The 2 links you found are from the official repository, and can be downloaded manually.\nSince you are on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and the packages are only available for 15.04 and newer, they are not included in your repository because they are incompatible.

It is telling you that you failed to finish your pattern with another caret (^).  The truth is, if you merely add a caret to the end of your pattern it will damage the intended logic of your pattern.  You see, the code that you are writing is expecting your pattern to be wrapped in delimiting characters - forward slashes are the most commonly used delimiters.  To correct the syntax, just add a slash at the start and a slash at the end of your pattern.\nThird, your pattern logic needs to be corrected.  You don't want to use the beginning of string (^) and end of string ($) metacharacters for your needs.  The solution is quite simple and straightforward with the use of \"word boundary\" meta characters (\\b). An online demonstration\n/\\b\\w{3}\\b/\n\nNo capture groups or lookarounds are necessary.  \\w is a \"word\" metacharacter that matches [a-zA-Z0-9_] which means any character in the following list: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and underscore.  The {3} is a \"quantifier\" which demands that exactly 3 characters in the \\w range are matched.  The \\b on either side of the \\w{3} ensures that the there is no character that could be matched by \\w immediately before or after the 3 matched characters.\nYour sample input string doesn't look very realistic, so it is hard to confidently offer a pattern which executes tighter validation.\nIf you are new to regular expressions, this is a nice resource to read over: https://www.rexegg.com/regex-php.html\n", "Q: terminal with keybindings I had been using Fedora 12 ( :-) ) until recently and moved to ubuntu. \nI used a lot of keybindings in \"konsole\" terminal for keyboard shortcuts. \nI am not able to get any such terminal application on ubuntu.

I hope there's a way to get it to do what I'd like, which is for the file manager to show me an accurate progress bar of the remaining write time (with an option to cancel the copy!)\nWhat I'm unclear about is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Ubuntu detect some drives as removable and apply optimal write cache settings?\n\n*If yes, how can I force it for my drive?\n\n\nAnd, in general, ie, teach a man to fish:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I tune the write cache for a drive? The ideal write cache would be a small write-back cache that is written to disk as quickly as possible. Actually, the cache itself need not be small, it just has to permit a small number of dirty pages.\n\n*How can I have this setting apply each time I use a USB drive?\n\n\nFull disclosure: I'm on Mint 17.2 Xfce\n\nA: The settings that control how many dirty pages are allowed to accumulate before being written to disk are controlled by the virtual memory subsystem.\nFor systems with a lot of RAM, they usually need to be tweaked. Unfortunately, these settings are system-wide. (Ugh, Linus.)\nSee the current settings with:\nsudo sysctl -a | grep vm.dirty\n\nOn my machine:\nvm.dirty_background_bytes = 0\nvm.dirty_background_ratio = 5\nvm.dirty_bytes = 0\nvm.dirty_expire_centisecs = 3000\nvm.dirty_ratio = 10\nvm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 500\n\nTake a look at the documentation for these settings. On my machine, vm.dirty_ratio is set to 10 (ie, 10% of RAM). This means that the disk cache will swallow up to 10% x 64GB = 6.4GB of data before writing it to disk.\nI am going to try tweaking these settings by writing the following into my /etc/sysctl.conf:\nvm.dirty_bytes = 67108864 \nvm.dirty_background_bytes = 1048576\nvm.dirty_expire_centisecs = 30\nvm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 30\n\nI'll update this answer as I learn more, but I think these aggressive settings are fine for my SSD, which has its own large on-drive write cache.\n\nA: I'm not sure if I can answer you what you want to hear.\nThere is the \"oldschool\" option to disable that buffer - you may use the fstab sync attribute for this. \nThis will bring you away from the modern way of your device lying to you \"your quick computer has already finished\" when it hasn't. The reality still is \"it's done when it's done\" and sync will let your computer show you when it is really done.\nIf you in fact are annoyed by the \"progress bar\" (or waiting times in the shell) and want to tweak the buffer size and behaviour you may do that by editing the sysfs/block options.\nCompare https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/30286/can-i-configure-my-linux-system-for-more-aggressive-file-system-caching\nfor this.\nThe list of availible options may vary depending on the ioscheduler you(r kernel) use(s).\nNow the question is: How to apply this for USB sticks.\nAFIAK on Linux Mint udisks handles USB Stick automounting and AFAIK there is no elegant way to  teach udisks sensible defaults. You may try udisks-glue to help you.\nIf there is only a limited number of USB sticks you want to tweak in detail, you may write an udev rule to do set the mount or sysfs options you want.\nI always look at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Udev#Writing_udev_rules whenever I'm tinkering with udev.\nHope that helps\n\nA: User Nachtexpress' advice regarding sync is correct. As to how to implement this dynamically, use/configure Autofs as per the instructions at the Debian Wiki for this service (link: https://wiki.debian.org/AutoFs).\nYou will note that you can set sync option for USB drives in a config file as per the following syntax and line:\n /var/autofs/removable   /etc/auto.removable --timeout=2,sync,nodev,nosuid\n\nThe above is just an example you can configure to your specific needs; go to wiki link for full instructions on how to do this.\nI think the debian wiki is appropriate for ubumtu users as this distro derives from it.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Calibre cannot load ImageMagick since upgrade to Vivid Vervet I just upgraded to Ubuntu 15.04 and now Calibre won't work. \nFile \"/usr/lib/calibre/calibre/utils/magick/__init__.py\", line 15, in\n<module>   raise RuntimeError('Failed to load ImageMagick: '+_merr)*\nRuntimeError: Failed to load ImageMagick: libIlmImf.so.6: cannot open\nshared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI have tried uninstalling/reinstalling Calibre and ImageMagick.\nHere is the ImageMagick I have:\ndpkg -l 'imagemagick*'\n\nDesired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold\n| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend\n|/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)\n||/ Name           Version      Architecture Description\n+++-==============-============-============-=================================\nii  imagemagick    6.9.2-5      amd64        Use ImageMagick to convert, edit,\nun  imagemagick-6. <none>       <none>       (no description available)\nii  imagemagick-6. 8:6.8.9.9-5u amd64        image manipulation programs -- qu\nii  imagemagick-co 8:6.8.9.9-5u all          image manipulation programs -- in\nun  imagemagick-do <none>       <none>       (no description available)\n\nHere is the Calibre I have:\ndpkg -l 'calibre*'\n\nDesired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold\n| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend\n|/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)\n||/ Name           Version      Architecture Description\n+++-==============-============-============-=================================\nii  calibre        2.33.0+dfsg- all          e-book converter and library mana\nii  calibre-bin    2.33.0+dfsg- amd64        e-book converter and library mana\n\nI have some of my own Python code that invokes ImageMagick, and since the upgrade I get the same error:\nerror while loading shared libraries: libIlmImf.so.6: cannot open\nshared object file: No such file or directory\n\nHow do I resolve that?\n\nA: Forget about the Calibre package in the Ubuntu repositories, it is outdated and not very well maintained.\nsudo apt-get remove calibre\n\nInstall Calibre with the command below, the author of Calibre provides a great installation script.\nsudo -v && wget -nv -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/master/setup/linux-installer.py | sudo python -c \"import sys; main=lambda:sys.stderr.write('Download failed\\n'); exec(sys.stdin.read()); main()\"\n\nThis script lets you get version 2.41.0 without the problem of missing libraries. \n\nMore information here.\n", "Q: From 12.04 to 14.04 on headless server I got\n\nWelcome to Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/\n10 packages can be updated. 6 updates are security updates.\nNew release '14.04.1 LTS' available.

OTA7))\nAnyone any Idea to use GPS successfully?\n\nHere are some screenshots. I wonder, cause there are less possibilities than in costales links.\n\n\nI even tried it near the window over hours with WIFI powered of.\nI flashed now the rc-proposed/BQchannel. My settings menu looks now different, but GPS is still not working. \n \n\nFinally I found this Bug-Report, maybe it is an already known bug.\n\nA: You can use GPS in two ways on Nexus 4.\n\n\n*\n\n*With Normal GPS.\n\n*With A-GPS (Assisted GPS with anonymized Wi-Fi and cellular network info; it can be named as Nokia HERE service as well).\n\n\n1. Usage with GPS\nGo to location settings and select \"Using GPS only\".\n\nThe problem this is option, that it can take a long time to get position the first time. So put your phone near the window, open uNav app (Ubuntu navigation application), tap on a button to find your position, and leave it for an hour with uNav app open untill it finds your position. If it does not find the position, review the GPS settings (check at the bottom of battery settings too), try enable/disable. If everything is OK, try reboot a device. Then go to uNav application and try again untill it finds your position.\nThen it finds your position, then navigation works very well. But if you experience any issues using navigation (navigation stops, is choppy or does not the direction), close other apps that might be using navigation as well at the same time (if it does not help, remove GPS permissions from other apps) (this is a known bug, bug report here)\n2. Usage with A-GPS\nBenefit of this way is that it immediately finds your position and you don't have to wait. \nMain Ubuntu channel does not use third-party services, so this option is only available if you flash bq-aquaris.en channel to your device. This channel is adapted for use of several devices, including mako (Nexus 4).\nInstruction how to change channel:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install developer tools on your computer (more info here)\n\n*Enable developer mode on your phone (Settings > About > Developer mode > Enable)\n\n*Connect the phone to the computer.\n\n*In terminal write \"adb reboot recovery\"\n\n*Phone restarts automatically and enters screen with android picture.\n\n*In terminal write \"ubuntu-device-flash touch --channel=ubuntu-touch/stable/bq-aquaris.en\"\n\n*Wait untill ubuntu flash the image and boots up. Finish.\n\n\nNow you will find A-GPS setting on your device, select it.\n\nIf it does not find your position immediately, restart your phone and try again.\nIf after finding the position navigation does not work well, then again, close other apps that might be using navigation as well at the same time for it to work well (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/location-service/+bug/1468020)\nOther notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*A-GPS works independent of radio version, it can be old or new, does not matter.\n\n*Compass is not yet implement on Ubuntu Touch, but it calculates your correct direction then you are driving, so its fine.\n\n\nA: Just FINALLY got something to work after months of it being broken.

I booted off a USB stick and had it install alongside Windows rather than over top of it. It installed perfectly, bootloader was great, etc. I decided I didn't like the version of Linux I had chosen, so without looking up a tutorial I went to remove Linux. On the windows side I deleted the Linux partitions, but didn't do anything about restoring the windows boot loader.\nUnsurprisingly (in hindsight), I couldn't boot into Windows, and got grub command line every time I attempted. Using a Windows recovery disk I attempted to fix it with the recovery console commands bootrec /fixmbr and bootrec /fixboot neither of which worked. I got to a bootable Windows by reinstalling the OS overtop of everything. Never saw grub command line again. However, there are still traces of Ubuntu in certain places.\nIn UEFI, the Hard Disk is specified as using Windows Boot Manager which I found peculiar. So I opened the Hard Disk BBS Priorities and sure enough there are two ubuntu options. I also noticed that if I go to Advanced Startup in Windows, choose Use a Device, ubuntu appears twice as an option.\nSo far the steps I've taken to try and fix this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using recovery console, rebuildbcd which failed\n\n*Using command prompt, bcdedit which returned no entry about ubuntu\n\n*Mounting the EFS partition of C: and deleting the ubuntu directory (failed)\n\n*Going into msconfig to delete Ubuntu. Ubuntu wasn't present.\nAfter a few days of googling I am completely out of ideas for what I can search for to find tutorials for this specific problem, because I'm not familiar with the places I'm finding ubuntu traces. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to remove the last of Ubuntu on this machine?\n\nA: What you're seeing are NVRAM entries. You can delete them in Windows using EasyUEFI, or using an Ubuntu live CD with the efibootmgr command-line program. (You'll type sudo efibootmgr to see the entries, then delete them with sudo efibootmgr -b {####} -B, where {####} is the four-digit hexadecimal number for an entry found with the first efibootmgr command.)\nThat said, these entries are basically harmless, so long as they aren't set as the default. You can safely ignore them.\nFor future reference, re-installing Windows was drastic overkill. Most computers provide an EFI boot manager that you can access by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key (usually something in the F8-F12 range). Using that, you could have booted Windows, then used bcdedit or EasyUEFI to reset the Windows boot loader as the default.\n\nA: You need to mount the UEFI partition in Windows.\nDo that from an administrative command prompt.\ndiskpart\nlist partition\nselect partition x:\nassign letter=b (or whatever available disk letter you want)\nexit (that only exits diskpart)\n\nin same admin prompt:\ntaskkill /im explorer.exe /f\nexplorer.exe (launches explorer with admin rights)\n\nafter that, I recommend unmounting the UEFI partition when you are done.\n", "Q: how can i increase the screen resolution ubuntu 15.10? i installed ubuntu 15.10 and i have NVIDIA geforce 920m 4g\nbut my masximum screen resolution is 1366 * 768\n, how can i increase the resolution to the maximum that can the NVIDIA handle ?\n\n\nA: The display can only display so much.  Otherwise you're wasting time and energy rendering pixels the display can't show.  Your card is running at the maximum resolution of this display already.\nIf you were to increase the resolution, you would likely get a distorted display.\nIn other words, if you CAN do this you don't want to.  99.9% of the time, the resolution options given in the settings are the ones you monitor can handle.  If it's a second display that you're trying to use, then you may be set to clone displays.\n", "Q: PlayOnLinux: change install location from virtual drive I am using PLayOnLinux for a couple of my games but it only installs games in one specific spot that I am unable to change, I'm guessing it's a virtual drive ((according to someone on here)) and I'd like to know how to change it to one of my actual harddrives, seeing as said virtual drive runs out of space. \n\nA: PlayOnLinux creates a \"virtual drive\" for every program you install through it. By default they're in your home folder in a folder called .PlayOnLinux\nYou can move the location of all the current virtual drives and any more drives you're going to install.\nlet's say you want to put them here: /mnt/NewPlayOnLinuxFolder/\nso firstly copy the folder .PlayOnLinux to the new directory:\ncp -av ~/.PlayOnLinux /mnt/NewPlayOnLinuxFolder/\n\nafter that's done, remove the old folder:\nrm -rf ~/.PlayOnLinux\n\nthen make what's called a \"symbolic link\" (as I understand, this would make anything \"referring to\" the old directory go to the new directory instead.)\nln -s /mnt/NewPlayOnLinuxFolder/.PlayOnLinux ~/.PlayOnLinux\n\nThat's it\nsource\n", "Q: Is there any way to remove space to the `/home` partition and assign to `/` partition?

For example this or this.\nHowever there are 2 important things you should be aware of. \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data before resizing partitions.\n\n*It might be more complicated to resize partitions if you have them encrypted (using cryptsetup).

Will i lose all my data and applications after upgrading to 15.04 from 14.04 LTS ? My system shows a new update is available - 15.04.\n\nA: Okay, first things first, this update is 100% optional. 14.04 is supported untill 2019 so you have another 3.5 years before you need to update.\nSecondly 15.04 is only supported untill January 2016, so you will need to update to 15.10 pretty soon. You can't update to 15.10 directly, so you will have to upgrade three times - once to 14.10, then to 15.04 then 15.10.\nIn April 2016 (6 months) Ubuntu 16.04 will be released. This will also be supported for 5 years - and will have all the features of Ubuntu 15.04 and 15.10. It might be sensible for you to wait for then before updating.\n\nIf you do decide to update then make sure you have backed everything up - I'd recommended everything you can, even if you don't think you need it. If it's still on your hard drive, you should back it up.\nWhile the upgrade should preserve everything (applications, preferences and permissions), it's not guaranteed. If something goes wrong (e.g. power cut) you want to have your data.\nI personally recommend Crash Plan for this - it's very reliable and it's free.\n\nA: Just two days ago i updated my kubuntu 14.04 to 15.04 then to 15.10, so this is possible. I did not lost my data in the home folder.\nThis is not available by default on LTS distribution, to allow the update you must perform the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open file /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\n\n*Change value \"Prompt=lts\" to \"Prompt=normal\"\n\n*Launch command \"do-release-upgrade\" \n\n\nA: Upgrading in place will not be a guaranteed loss of data - usually, it will not remove your data unless something horribly wrong happens.  That being said, however, you should always back up critical data that you don't wish to lose before upgrading.\nNote that this upgrade is optional and you do not need to upgrade to 15.04 if you do not want to.  14.04 is still supported for a while.\n\nAbout 14.04 -> 15.04 direct upgrade path:\nI checked with the Release Team - specifically bdmurray in the #ubuntu-release channel on Freenode IRC. There is indeed a supported upgrade path from 14.04 to 15.04 directly, skipping over the EOL 14.10 release.  This is documented on this bug, Bug #1497024 on Launchpad. It is also only available under the following condition.\n\nif \"Prompt=normal\" in /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\n\nHowever, this path is potentially broken right now as a result of a bug.  You may wish to consider NOT using this upgrade path.\n", "Q: Install without boot disc I would like to install Ubuntu (or Lubuntu, more precisely) on a machine where BIOS does not allow be to boot from an USB (and there is no CD/DVD). I have browsed the alternatives in here, but they are all quite advanced, or at least far beyond my understanding of Ubuntu.

The computer currently has Ubuntu 14.10 installed, but I'd like to all completely fresh install, wiping everything out.\n\nA: Absolutely you can run from a hard drive!  A hard drive is just an internal version of a USB drive (for your purposes) so you can do this no problem.

Checking for updates comes up with \"Unable to locate package ubuntu-zfs\" checking the PPA here it seems that the PPA for 15.10 is missing ubuntu-zfs.\nDoes anyone have a work around for getting my zpool to work again. I've tried using ZFS-Fuse but it's running an older version than when I was using ubuntu-zfs. \nAny help in getting my ZFS system working again would be appreciated.\n\nA: For those who encounter the following errors,\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\nzfsutils-linux : ***Depends: zfs-doc (= 0.6.4.2-0ubuntu1) but 0.6.5.3-1~wily is to be installed***\n                  Depends: libnvpair1linux but it is not going to be installed\n                  Depends: libuutil1linux but it is not going to be installed\n                  Depends: libzfs2linux but it is not going to be installed\n                  Depends: libzpool2linux but it is not going to be installed\n                  Recommends: zfs-dkms but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nThis is most probably due to having ppa:zfs-native/stable in your apt source repository.  Remove the ppa:zfs-native/stable from your apt repository, and re-run apt-get update.  Then proceed to install via apt-get install zfsutils-linux\nThat should fix it for you.\n\nA: Ubuntu 15.10 has ZFS support out of the box. Try to install zfsutils-linux which builds the native kernel modules for Linux (zfs-dkms).\n$ apt-get install zfsutils-linux\n\n\nA: I had this problem as well after an upgrade from Ubuntu 15.04 to 15.10. I also got the unmet dependencies issue that TL-Aiyor and others listed. Removing the PPA did not work for me though. I had to purge all (probably could have just purged zfs-doc but just purged everything) zfs from the system and re-install. \napt-add-repository --remove ppa:zfs-native/stable\nzpool export tank\napt-get purge zfs*\napt-get autoremove\napt-get install zfsutils-linux\nzpool import tank\n\nEverything after that went just dandy. \n", "Q: There's no status bar in Gnome 3.18 I have Ubuntu 15.10 and I've installed gnome 3.18 using this guide and I don't see the status bar or a tray bar like gnome 3.16 and below. \nIs this something made in purpose? or something I haven't installed yet? If so, what should I install?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The gnome3-staging PPA has a nifty description in launchpad:\nThe packages here have been deemed not ready for general use, they have known bugs and/or regressions, sometimes of a critical nature. Mostly things should run smoothly but be prepared to use ppa-purge, when you encounter issues!\nYou should probably run ppa-purge against the gnome-staging PPA unless you are prepared to deal with some difficulties.\n", "Q: Using the sources from Ubuntu 14 into ubuntu 12 We made a very silly mistake in a server, using the sources in the sources.list file from ubuntu 14 into ubuntu 12.\nThe system still works but needless to say there are a lot of errors on upgrade. \nNow the system seems to think it's a release 14, but it's not! \nI was going to go and fetch the sources from 12 and try to start over so I could have a clean upgrade without having to reinstall but I just wanted to ask if it's the safe thing to do.\nAny ideas? \nI got the sources from here:\nhttp://repogen.simplylinux.ch/generate.php\n\nA: if you ran upgrade command and no one package upgraded and you directly get error then no problem you can replace your  /etc/apt/sources.list entries with Ubuntu 12.04. generate from  here and copy and paste to your /etc/apt/sources.list file and then update \nsudo apt-get update  \n\nor \nif some packages upgraded then you can downgrade them but it is not sure you will get result equivalent to previous system.

Ubuntu restart did not help. I tried command:\nsudo apt-get install open-vm-tools\n\nBut got report I have newest version. Guest Isolation settings are enabled. What could be the scenario of fixing this problem?\n\nA: I had the same problem and found that this can be fixed by executing the following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove open-vm-tools\n\n*Install VMware Tools by following the usual method (Virtual Machine\n--> Reinstall VMWare Tools)\n\n*Reboot the VM\n\n*sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop\n\n*Reboot the VM, after the reboot copy/paste and drag/drop will work!\n\n\nA: I tried the approach suggested by solution101 above, but it didn't work for me. This is how I solved the problem:\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*sudo apt install open-vm-tools-desktop\n\n*restart the guest operating system\n\nThis seems to have fixed the copy-and-paste issue for me.\n\nA: In my case, somehow the guest start-up job running the VMware User Agent was removed from my xfce session autostart. \nYou need to run /usr/bin/vmware-user-suid-wrapper at login\n\nA: You can't uncheck the checkboxes while the VM is running; they are disabled. If you do this when the VM is not running, there is no effect (VMWare Workstation 12 Pro).\n\nA: I can see how old this post is, but I noticed something relevant; it wasn't even Ubuntu. Apparently \"Shared folders\" must be enabled prior to installing open-vm-tools - also had open-vm-tools-desktop already installed and nothing worked. Reinstalling both packages does the job, seemingly when shared folder were enabled; this works instantly. With apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop --reinstall\n\nOr with dnf:\nsudo dnf reinstall open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop\n\nI'd assume that when enabling \"shared folder\" before the OS install, it should work out of the box.\n\nA: This is copied verbatim from a vmware community forum:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into VM / Settings / Options / Guest Isolation \n\n*UNCHECK bothcheckboxes (Enable drag and drop, Enable copy and paste) and click OK. \n\n*Shut down the guest, and shut down VMware Workstation \n\n*Reboot the host computer \n\n*Run VMware Workstation but do not launch the guest yet. \n\n*Go into VM / Settings / Options / Guest Isolation for the guest, and \n\n*CHECK both checkboxes \n\n*Power On the guest.\n\n\nA: The best and working solution is restarting your VMWare application (Workstation, Fusion, etc.), not the VM itself. (provided, of course, that you have installed the VMWare tools already.)\n\nA: In my case in addition to bidirectional button activation, I had to do following steps:\nOn the terminal of guest virtual machine run:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y make gcc perl\n\nNow on virtual machine's main menu go: \"Devices\" -> \"Insert Guest Additions CD image\" -> wait popup to appear -> follow up installation steps -> once it's done go reboot\nIn my case it has resolved copy&paste issue\n\nA: If you are using the VMware Remote Console or Vsphere Client, then it wont work by just installing VMware tools.\nYou need to follow the steps described here.\n\nTo resolve this issue, first install or upgrade the VMware tools for\nthe Windows/Linux virtual machine(VM).

I have a laptop with SIS 771/671 graphics. I migrated to Ubuntu from Arch Linux recently.

For instance in my github.\nBut it will work only on Ubuntu 12.04 with Xorg version 1.11.\nThe last Xorg version supported is 1.12.\nYou will need to install the original 12.04, or install 12.04.5 and downgrade the Xorg.\n\nA: this solved me:  \nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nuncomment the line  \n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nto p.ex.\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768\n\nsave and\nsudo update-grub\n\nOn next boot you'll have the desired screen resolution.\n", "Q: Want to run OpenStack in a VM I am interested in openstack-autopilot. I think I understand that to be useful OpenStack would require more underlying hardware, but if my goal was understanding OpenStack could one run OpenStack in a VM on a single system? If so what would be the minimum requirements for the single system?\nIf this is not the correct path for learning OpenStack, what would be a low cost and open source alternative?\n\nA: As mentioned by Adam, Landscape 15.11 is now released. It gives users an option to download the OpenStack Autopilot test drive which allows you to install and run the Ubuntu OpenStack Autopilot entirely in VMware so you will not need hardware. Grab details about the Ubuntu OpenStack Autopilot here\n\nA: The Ubuntu OpenStack Autopilot requires 5 machines, but keep your eye out for an upcoming VMWare solution. If you want to explore OpenStack, and Ubuntu OpenStack in particular but don't have the hardware for a real cloud, then you should look at the Ubuntu OpenStack Installer single install guide.

Actually,I want to know what to do now as I am unable to understand what's going on.\n\nA: wget is already installed.\nwget is a command-line tool.

This is using a script to update itself with debmirror. What are the relative pros and cons of debmirror over apt-mirror? My previous Linux experience is limited: we are a mainly Windows site and I got assigned this because I've looked after one or two Solaris boxes in the past!\nAlso, I'm wanting to add 14.04 LTS to the mirror. Is there any way to work out what volume of storage I'll need for the two releases?\nThanks.\n\nA: I don't think there is much difference. But instead take a look at apt-cacher-ng for an alternative way of doing mostly the same thing, with less work for you and less bandwidth waste.\ndeb/apt-mirror blindly copies all files (even if some are never used) from the distro/architecture/version you specify, periodically according to cron, etc.\nBut apt-cacher-ng is passive. When some user pulls a package, that package remains in your server for the next person. Similar to squid, unless there is a newer version online which then gets pulled and also kept.\nAnd it happens to work with all apt distros just fine without you doing any extra work or adding anything else, third party repositories and ppas they all get stored (cached) in your server.\nFor your users to use apt-cacher-ng they only need to add a proxy to their apt configuration, instead of using a local mirror.\n", "Q: installing itunes shows error \"itunes requires that your computer requires windows 7 or newer\" \nPlease help me to install itunes.\n\nA: You'll have to download iTunes from Apple first, then run PlayOnLinux.\nPicture guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the PlayOnLinux window, select \"Install a Program.\"\n\n\n*Then, select \"Install a non-listed program\" in the bottom left.\n\n\n*Click through the agreements and such and then select the \"Install a program in a new virtual drive\" option and click Next.\n\n\n*Name the drive iTunes and continue.\n\n*Next, check the options, \"Use another version of Wine\" and \"Configure Wine\" and continue.\n\n\n*Choose System for the Wine version and click Next.\n\n*Choose the 64-bit system option on the next screen and continue.\n\n*Let Wine do its thing until a window pops up.

What can I do to fix this?\n\nA: The problem is actually with the power management of the \"Suyin Corp. 1.3M WebCam (notebook emachines E730, Acer sub-brand)\" device. This device is an internal multi-protocol USB device which is not only the webcam but also the keyboard. The solution is to disable autosuspend for that device. You can do so with the following steps:\nStep 1A: Identify your device on the USB bus.\nRun\n$ lsusb\n\nand look for the WebCam.\nIn my case the output looks like this:\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 064e:a219 Suyin Corp. 1.3M WebCam (notebook emachines E730, Acer sub-brand)\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0020 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 004: ID 1c7a:0801 LighTuning Technology Inc. Fingerprint Reader\nBus 001 Device 011: ID 0cf3:3005 Atheros Communications, Inc. AR3011 Bluetooth\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0020 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\n\nwhich means that in my case the device is Bus 002 Device 004. We need that information in Step 2 as 2-1.4. The 2 is the Bus number from the lsusb command, the 1 is the Bus (0 would be the Hub itself), The 4 is the device on the bus from the lsusb command.\nStep 1B: Identify your device on the USB bus.\nAlternatively, you can identify your device using the following commands:\n$ cd /sys/bus/usb/devices\n$ echo */input\n\nThis will print all devices which are a keyboard. In my case, it prints 2-1.4:1.0/input which means the device is 2-1.4.\nIf you have multiple keyboards attached, you need to figure out which keyboard is the right one. In that case, either detach all other keyboards before running the echo command, or inspect the corresponding product file, in this case 2-1.4/product, i.e. using cat 2-1.4/product. The product file should contain a string like 1.3M WebCam.\nStep 2: Disable autosuspend for the device.\nAssuming that Step 1 resulted in the device 2-1.4, run the following command to disable autosuspend for that device:\n$ sudo sh -c 'echo \"0\" >/sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/autosuspend'\n\nNow the keyboard should be working perfectly well.\nStep 3: Make the change permanent\nTo make this change permanent, you need to run that echo command during startup. For how to run a script during startup, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8339555/how-to-run-a-script-at-the-start-up-of-ubuntu\n", "Q: How to pick a launcher to install software New to Ubuntu 14.04. Want to install adobe flash plug-in which I picked from the Ubuntu Software Center. After clicking on Install I have a choice of what application I want to use. When I choose the appropriate software i.e. (APT for Ubuntu 10.4+) the System is asking what launcher I will use to install. I have no clue what to answer/pick. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I guess you are referring to this thing here:\n\nYou are right in that you pick the APT deb package. What you can do with is download it, and open it in Software Center - other methods are available for installing deb packages via the command line, see here.\nUbuntu (and most Linux systems), usually does not require you to download random software off the internet. Verified packages are available from the Ubuntu repositories, which can be downloaded and installed from Software Center, apt-get, aptitude etc (other packages are also available via PPAs). They also receive updates with the rest of the system, so overall this is the best method to use. For Flash just install the flashplugin-installer package.\nBy the way the NPAPI version of flash for Linux (and other non-Windowz/Mac systems) is only available as the old 11 release (excuse from Adobe is they are apparently getting rid of flash player). It works and is supposed to have security backports - if you want the new version you can use Google Chrome (or Chromium and pepperflashplugin-nonfree package) to get PPAPI flash which still receives updates. This can be used with Firefox as well via the use of a plugin adapter - see here\n", "Q: No bluetooth on 15.10 (NUC w/ 7265 wifi+bt adapter) I'm wondering if someone could point me in the right direction to troubleshoot bluetooth on 15.10 (I actually moved to 15.10 to see if it would help the bluetooth situation).

I've managed to recover what seems to be all of the information from the encrypted portion of my hard drive. I was able to use information from this page and this page to do so. I will describe the process below.\nFirst, I booted my machine, with the problem hard drive in place, using Sytem Rescue CD. I was able to use # cat /proc/partitions to find the encrypted portion was sda5, which I confirmed with # cryptsetup -v luksDump /dev/sda5.\nI then opened the encrypted disk using # cryptsetup -v luksOpen /dev/sda5 sda5_crypt and entered my password to unlock the volume. # lvdisplay now revealed /dev/ubuntu-vg/root and /dev/ubuntu-vg/swap1. I change the volume groups for these with # vgchange -a y ubuntu-vg, and then made a mount point with # mkdir /tmp/disk and # mount /dev/ubuntu-vg/root /tmp/disk.\nThis allowed me to get into the drive, but not my private information in my profile. In /tmp/disk/home/USERNAME/ I can see a /.Private, which is where all of my information is hiding. # ecryptfs-recover-private prompted me for my password, then created a new /tmp/ directory.\nAt this point, I mounted an external hard drive:\n# mkdir /tmp/disk2\n# mount /dev/sdc2 /tmp/disk2\n# cd /tmp/disk2\n# mkdir restore \nIt was then a simple case of using # cp -r /tmp/ecrypt.N1something /tmp/disk2/restore. I believe I might have been able to just remove the encryption from the disk using my specific variations of this, but I just wanted a backup of everything (which I know I should have done before, anyway) and I was able to use my profiles and files in a fresh intall.\n", "Q: Running AndroidStudio on Ubuntu 15.10 crash Right now I am facing the issue that I cannot develop in AndroidStudio using Ubuntu 15.10, because both openjdk-7 and openjdk-8 cause problems.\nopenjdk-7 issue\nRunning AndroidStudio using env STUDIO_JDK=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64 /opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh\ncauses the VIRT column of top of Xorg to jump to 25.1G while my memory usage seems okay (3.5 of 8 GB used).\nHowever, this causes git-cola to break:\n$ git-cola\nQNativeImage: Unable to attach to shared memory segment. \n\n(python:13321): Gdk-WARNING **: shmget failed: error 28 (No space left on device)\nX Error: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 9\n  Major opcode: 62 (X_CopyArea)\n  Resource id:  0x0\nX Error: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 9\n  Major opcode: 62 (X_CopyArea)\n  Resource id:  0x0\nX Error: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 9\n  Major opcode: 62 (X_CopyArea)\n  Resource id:  0x0\n\n[...]\n\ncausing this visual experience:\n\nGuys at Arch say that this is an openjdk-7 related memory leak: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=201488\nopenjdk-8 issue\nWhen starting AndroidStudio with openjdk-8 (env STUDIO_JDK=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64 /opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh) no program's VIRT column exceeds 5GB.\nBut AndroidStudio crashes after some time (often when showing an auto-complete list in XML or Java).\nThe last crash reason is\n(java:14046): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: /build/glib2.0-ajuDY6/glib2.0-2.46.1/./gobject/gsignal.c:3484: signal name 'bounds_changed' is invalid for instance '0x7fd32c1f01c0' of type 'JawImpl_0'\n\n(java:14046): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: /build/glib2.0-ajuDY6/glib2.0-2.46.1/./gobject/gsignal.c:3484: signal name 'bounds_changed' is invalid for instance '0x7fd32c1f01c0' of type 'JawImpl_0'\n\n(java:14046): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: /build/glib2.0-ajuDY6/glib2.0-2.46.1/./gobject/gsignal.c:3484: signal name 'bounds_changed' is invalid for instance '0x7fd32c1f01c0' of type 'JawImpl_0'\nOkt 29, 2015 9:29:20 PM com.android.tools.idea.monitor.network.NetworkSampler checkStatsFile\nWARNUNG: IOException null in ls /proc/net/xt_qtaguid/stats\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*AndroidStudio version: 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 (Beta)\n\n*OpenJDK8 version: 1.8.0_66-internal\n\n*OpenJDK7 version: 1.7.0_85\n\n\nI was running AndroidStudio using openjdk-8 without problems using Ubutnu 15.04.\nIdeas?\n\nA: I had to use Oracle Java 8 (as @wilf suggested as well), which works fine for now.\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded from oracle.com and installed to /opt/java8-oracle\n\n*Starting Android Studio via env STUDIO_JDK=/opt/java8-oracle /opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh\n", "Q: Install apache2 and tomcat7 without apt-get (Ubuntu Server) How can I install apache2 and tomcat7 without using apt-get?

Does ecryptfs-recover-private not work to decrypt your old home files? It should, if you remember the old login passphrase, or you have the mount passphrase.\nI don't think renaming the olduser home to something else is needed, the next step should just use the existing folder as the home for the \"new olduser\".\nThen create a new user with your desired name, probably \"olduser\"? Use the same login passphrase from before, then it will hopefully decrypt the home successfully when you login. Using the gui tools might have an option or checkbox to encrypt the user's home, I think it just runs ecryptfs-migrate-home on the new user, so I don't think you want that. Or just use adduser in a terminal. This should use the existing home files in olduser.\nThen if the olduser files aren't still in the olduser home, copy them back from the backup.\nThen try logging in as \"olduser\". Hopefully it will decrypt the home (using the same login passphrase from before the reinstall) and work ok. \nIf it doesn't work, then renaming your old home, creating a new user \"olduser\" with the encrypted home checkbox, or using ecryptfs-migrate-home and then logging in as newuser and copy back the old home files from your backup should work.\n", "Q: Can you change the directory/mount point to another location I am looking to change the directory to which the Ubuntu app store and terminal installs programs.\nThe main reasons are for the factor that I use a lot of programs and when I add a program to Ubuntu, I tend to add it's repository, so I can get that program's updates.

And I am looking to also have an automatic backup make back ups for programs.\nIs there a way to change the install directory to another location, or possibly /home?   \n\nA: It looks like the best way to do this would be to mount /usr on another hard drive. To do this, you need to\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an ext4 partition on your hard drive\n\n*Copy the entire contents of /usr onto that partition\n\n*Edit your /etc/fstab file to mount that hard drive at /usr during boot\n\n*Boot from a LiveUSB and delete /usr from the original hard drive\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nThis method was discussed here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1617196\nAnother method would be to copy the contents of /usr to another hard drive, and use symlinks, but you would have to automatically mount the hard drive anyway, so it's not much different: How do I change Software Center's default installation path?\nAs for moving your /home partition, that's pretty well-documented on the Ubuntu wiki, and the steps are pretty much the same as moving /usr to another hard drive: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\nRegarding your concerns on SSD lifespan, they seem to last longer than most people think.

I've tried to install a new system with the help of a mini.iso and ran into wireless configuration issues. \nI found it pretty weird that the mini.iso mostly seems to be working fine although despite pretty basic commands like the following:\nlshw\nlspci\nlsusb\nifconfig\n\nwere missing when I tried them from the command line.\nThis is the extended version of my question: \n\n\n*\n\n*Which commands are available on the mini.iso? \n\n*Where can I find documentation about the available console commands? \n\n*Where can I find what software packages are present on the mini.iso? \n\n\n\nUpdate: (clarification about the question)\nTo be clear about the question: with \"command line\" I mean the console that becomes available when you \n\n\n*\n\n*perform \"manual\" configuration steps during setup (like wireless, disk, serial device setup) or \n\n*when you access the menu point \"Execute a shell\"\nThe question is specific about the mini.iso or netinstall.iso as these are provided seemingly without further documentation. This is not a question about what is generally available under busybox (or any other mini Linux distro). If the shell on the mini.iso is based on busybox, I'd like to see where this fact is documented.\nThe question is not just about the above four commands. It's about where to get documentation about what is available as commands.\nSome years ago, there used to be documentation about this. And documentation about how to configure devices during install. These seem to be gone without replacement. \n\nA: I assume that \"the command line\" in this question means the command-line interface one can obtain by pressing left Alt + F2 or by choosing \"Execute a shell\" in the installer menu (which can be accessed by pressing Esc). This interface is based on Busybox, which \"combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable\". As usual, two kinds of commands are available.\n\n\n*\n\n*Commands built into the shell. You can get a list of them by typing help, and they are documented here.\n\n*Binaries located in directories listed in the PATH environment variable. You can see the contents of PATH as usual with echo $PATH, and list their contents with ls.\n\n\nHowever here there is a slight complication, because there are also two kinds of binaries.\n\n\n*\n\n*The binaries for many basic utilities, such as for example ping or od are just symlinks to /bin/busybox. Here too those commands are built into Busybox and they are documented in the link above. They are usually much more minimalist than the versions of those commands you are used to, in order to save space.\n\n*Other binaries (i.e., those which are not symlinked to /bin/busybox) such as for example nano are the same as in a normal Ubuntu system. The manual pages are not available in Busybox, but you can consult them on http://manpages.ubuntu.com.\n\n\nA: There is no documentation because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Developers hate writing documentation\n\n*It's kind of self-documenting: \nThe mini.iso can be mounted with:\nmkdir /media/DVD-ISO\nsudo mount -o loop /tmp/mini.iso /media/DVD-ISO\n\nNow you can inspect the data of the iso itself:\nll /media/DVD-ISO\n\nand it contains a number of files, of which one is of particular interest:\n-r--r--r-- 2 root root  21M Apr 15  2014 initrd.gz\n\nwhich is a gzip compressed file which we extract like this:\ncd /media/DVD-ISO/\nmkdir initrd\ncd initrd\ngunzip ../initrd.gz\n\nWhich finally give us the boot image initrd which we extract using:\nmkdir temp\ncd temp\nsudo cpio -id < ../initrd\n\nAnd now you have all the updated documentation you need!  (answering your questions one by one)\n\n\n*\n\n*This gives the full list of commands included in the iso: ll bin&ll sbin&ll usr/local/bin\n\n*Just type man szCommand where szCommand is the command whose documentation you want.\n\n*See step 1 as there are no additional packages present...\n\n", "Q: vmware player on ubuntu 15.10 I just uploaded to Ubuntu 15.10 and my vmware player is not working anymore.\nI tried to follow the solution proposed here and here but it doesn't seem to be enough for me.\nWhen I run vmplayer I get a lot of error messages like\nGtk-Message: Failed to load module \"unity-gtk-module\": libunity-gtk-module.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\n(vmware-modconfig:9701): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: \"murrine\",\n\nAt this point it asks me to compile and load several module into the kernel.

You just install the \"missing\" packages.\nIn general, the only difference is that on the Server edition you don't have a desktop and related packages (X, word processor, graphical browser, etc.) and on the Desktop edition you don't have server related packages.\nYou can start from the Server edition and then install the desktop packages (this is the hard way) or you can start from the Desktop edition and then install server packages (e.g. apache2, ssh, php, MySQL, etc.).\nSince Ubuntu 12.04 both editions also use the same kernel.\nFor more details, see Ubuntu Server FAQ\n\nA: I think virtualization could be a good answer for your usecase.

I use Ubuntu 14.04's built-in Backup utility (backed by deja dup) and use daily backups. Every so often (every couple of months) Backup insists that it create a \"fresh backup\" in case of \"backup corruption\". I imagine that the motivation for doing this is that if the backup files themselves are on some media which may suffer bit rot from cosmic rays, current spikes, etc or aren't redundant (almost all media is like this for the average computer user), having new fresh backups from time to time would be nice.\nHowever, there are users, such as myself, who use backup media which are much less likely to suffer from backup corruption, and don't need regular fresh backups. In my case, my backup media is a ZFS RAIDZ filesystem whose redundancy and bit-level checksumming prevents random data corruption. Additionally, creating fresh backups takes up large amounts of space (close to 1TB) and so in my case I'd rather just use the incremental backups ad-infinitum as Time Machine for the Mac does.\nIs there a way, in Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty, to turn off the \"fresh backup\" functionality entirely? Another askubuntu.com answer hints at a \"secret config key\" but doesn't disclose where it is.\n\nA: It doesn't seem like there is a way to turn off fresh backups entirely, based on a comment on Launchpad:\n\nIs there a way to completely disable the fresh backup feature?\nNo. The fresh backups are used for other purposes, like deleting old backups when space gets tight. If only incremental backups were used, Deja Dup couldn't do that.\n\nHowever, I can approximate \"never\" by setting the time between fresh backups to be very long. I need to modify the Dconf setting at path /org/gnome/deja-dup/, schema org.gnome.DejaDup, key name full-backup-period. It controls the number of days before a fresh backup is made. I simply set it to 10 years (36500 days) to approximate \"never\".\nFor example, to set it to 36500 days from the command line, run:\ngsettings set org.gnome.DejaDup full-backup-period 36500\n\nI can also do this from dconf-editor (screenshot)\n\nA: You can control the full backup interval by using dconf-editor.  If you open this tool and browse to org.gnome.deja-dup you will see an entry for full-backup-period which you may change. \nA comment to an answer in this question suggests that the program may overwrite the values, though. Let us know how it works out for you.\n\nA: I've never used automatic back-ups. I know in the older versions, you can for sure. Try using this back-up manager. I haven't used it in a while, however.\n\nA: why not use copy and paste to backup your file? it's easy.\n\n\n*\n\n*go into the directory you want to copy\n\n*right click on the file\n\n*select copy\n\n*go into your back-up file \n\n*then paste it.\n\n", "Q: Can't get my Linksys USB wifi adapter to work I have installed Ubuntu 14.04, but I can't get an Internet Connection.

Sometime BIOS upgrade can fix some issues in Linux.\nFor example, on Dell XPS 13 9343, user may experience some key repeat bug, and this one can be fix by upgrading the BIOS (AFAIK, this issue do exist across several Dell laptops).\nSo please check the vendor's website for the BIOS release note to determine if you need it.\n\nA: No, you do not need to update the BIOS at all before installing Ubuntu. It doesn't matter at all.\n\nA: Is it necessary, no. I recommend it though as later BIOS are normally more stable than previous.

Profiling tools are a way to look at the work within that process (and, indeed, a \"process\" makes no sense to a profiler. It is looking at a number of threads and classloaders within a single JVM instance.)\nSince you want to collect information that you can use to report back to the OpenJDK project (or, probably, the authors of the game) you might want to experiment with the \"Sample\" capabilities. The idea is that we want a snapshot of activity over time, probably a number of snapshots, so we can see what parts of the JVM were hottest during the identified problem we see from the point-of-view of the system.\nThis way we can see if it is methods related to the game code, or the native or non-native code within the JVM itself.\n(I will add that profiling running apps is a bit of a black art. My advice is to make sure you are really looking at the JVM instance you think you are, and spending some time with the interface to figure out what you are collecting. Performance investigations are often more about understanding what you are trying to do more than what information you actually get; it's about making sure you are asking the right questions.)\n", "Q: No more grub menu I can't access the grub menu anymore, my computer directly boots into Windows 10.\nI tried a boot-repair but it didn't fix the problem.\nHere is the pastebin link:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/13006892/\nAny idea how to make the grub menu reappear?\n\nEDIT\nI just installed easyuefi as suggested by 金潇泽. \nHere it a screenshot:\n\nHow can I use it? \n\nA: Have you turn off your 'Fast Startup' in your Windows?

Then right click, New, use FAT32 as the file system.\nNow you can make Linux Mint LiveUSB on it.\nOr you can use \"SD Formatter\" in Windows.\n", "Q: Cinnamon Desktop - Clicking menu->shutdown presents no real button options?

I think it would be similar for LXC container.\nAttach to containter console, you will be root; and you don't need to worry ssh service since you are using console:\n$ lxc exec <container name> -- bash\n\nFirst upgrade your software packages, especially for apt:\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get dist-upgrade\n# reboot (maybe not needed)\n\nif you don't have \"do-release-upgrade\":\n# apt-get install ubuntu-release-upgrader-core\n\nThen you can start upgrade:\n# do-release-upgrade -m server\n\nIn case “do-release-upgrade” complains \"Must be connected to a terminal.\", I have no idea why this happens, I think this container bases on Ubuntu cloud image. So have to use a ssh connection and \"sudo\"s.\n\nA: If I don't want/need to pass the upgrader code paths I do like the post that mentioned just replacing the release name in /etc/apt/sources.list.\nBut If I want/need do-release-upgrade to really run I just enable ssh.\nThere might be easier ways to get convinced to have a proper console, but it is easy and works.\nTo do so do\n# go into the container\nlxc exec <container> bash\n# set PasswordAuthentication yes here\nvim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n# restart containers ssh\nservice ssh restart\n# set a pw of the default ubuntu user\npasswd ubuntu\n# exit container and get the container IP\nlxc info <container>\n# connect to it via ssh\nssh ubuntu@<ip>\n# run do-release-upgrade as you want\ndo-release-upgrade\n\n\nA: Cannot comment on @alfred answer so sorry for new one.\n\"Must be connected to a terminal.\" complain can be solved with command:\nexec >/dev/tty 2>/dev/tty </dev/tty\n\nThan just run do-release-upgrade.\n\nA: Here's what seems to have worked for me:\n$ sudo lxc-attach --name <container>\n\nThen edit /etc/apt/sources.list and replace all occurences of vivid to wily.\nNext do:\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get upgrade\n# apt-get dist-upgrade\n# apt-get autoclean\n# apt-get autoremove\n# reboot\n\nRepeat this a couple of times until all packages are updated.\n", "Q: Skype not displaying content properly I am using Skype 4.3 on my Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.

During installation for the first time I was not ask for a root password is there a default password? Or is there some way to establish that password?\n\nA: At time of installation it asked to create one user and that user is in sudo group. so whenever you run any command with sudo it will ask that user password not root. so no need of root password , but if you want to set password then you can \nset password using command:\n sudo passwd \n\nor \nsudo passwd root\n\n\nA: Standard Ubuntu since at least 14.04 has not used the root account in favor of doing everything with sudo.  Unless you've used older versions or other distros where root account is the standard way of doing privileged tasks, it's probably better to continue the Ubuntu way: if you find a command that needs root privilege, use sudo with your user password (assuming you have a user account that's in the sudoers list).\n", "Q: Gitk --all not working on Ubuntu 15.10 Yesterday I upgraded my machine from Ubuntu 15.04 to Ubuntu 15.10.

It contains the\n# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.\n# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for detailed information about\n# the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian about Debian specific\n# hints.\n#\n#\n# Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian:\n# The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to\n# upstream's suggested way to configure the web server. This is because Debian's\n# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,\n# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in\n# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as\n# possible.\n\n# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined\n# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:\n#\n#   /etc/apache2/\n#   |-- apache2.conf\n#   |   `--  ports.conf\n#   |-- mods-enabled\n#   |   |-- *.load\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   |-- conf-enabled\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   `-- sites-enabled\n#       `-- *.conf\n#\n#\n# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces\n#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the\n#   web server.\n#\n# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is\n#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be\n#   customized anytime.\n#\n# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/\n#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,\n#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,\n#   respectively.\n#\n#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their\n#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our\n#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See\n#   their respective man pages for detailed information.\n#\n# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in\n#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with\n#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not\n#   work with the default configuration.\n\n\n# Global configuration\n#\n\n#\n# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's\n# configuration, error, and log files are kept.\n#\n# NOTE!

I have noticed that my NFTS disk which contained my webservice files wasn't mounted at bootup. When I mounted the disks by clicking on the mount button in the file manager the disks where mounted in /media/user. (user=current logged in user). So I thought the problem could also be that the filepath was user specific. To tackle both possible problems I edited /etc/fstab and added my NFTS disk to make it mount at bootup in the dir /media instead of /media/user. This worked.

In a terminal, in the directory of the problematic file, run ls -i that'll give you something similar to the following:\n$ ls -i\n7995865 a  7995866 b  7995867 c\n\nThen to remove it you can use find, and rm\n$ find . -inum 7995866 -exec rm -f {} \\;\n$ ls -i\n7995865 a  7995867 c\n\n", "Q: How to get konsole work on gns3 i am interested in making my devices display in tabs when working on GN3. i made some research and found out that konsole can do that. i installed it. \ni have gone to preferences => edit => set KDE konsole\namazingly when i open the console of a device it \n\ni need it to display the router or device i intend working with normally. how do i fix this\n\nA: it is simple, just to preferences => edit => general, on the tab for console change the command there to \nconsole application commands:\nkonsole --new-tab -p tabtitle=%d -e telnet %h %p\nthen {the second console application commands:\nLocal serial connections (remember to install socat)\nkonsole --new-tab -p tabtitle=%d -e socat UNIX-CONNECT:\"%s\" stdio,raw,echo=0\n\n", "Q: Network manager: shared connection and manual settings of the interface I use Ubuntu 14. I have two interfaces (eth0 and usb0) and two connections with manual settings. I want to use network manager. Eth0 is WAN. How can I create shared connection to other computers? If I create new connection (third one) and use eth0 as interface then it doesn't work. If I open existing connection (eth0) and change method from Manual to Shared to other computers then all my settings disappear. \n\nA: To do it through network manager using gui\ndnsmasq-base has to be installed:\nsudo apt-get install dnsmasq-base\nRemove dnsmasq because it conflicts with NetworkManager:\nsudo apt-get remove dnsmasq\nNetworkManager version 0.7, shipped with Ubuntu 8.10 and later, contains a redesigned user interface for managing network connections.\nAmong the new features and UI is an option to make a connection “Shared to other computers”. This is basically a dead-simple NAT (Network Address Translation), or Internet connection sharing, built right in to NetworkManager.\nTo enable this, you must follow three steps:\nInstall dnsmasq on your computer. (On Ubuntu, you will want to install the dnsmasq-base package. (apt-get install dnsmasq-base is the easiest way)\nMake sure your WAN connection (i.e. Internet-connected connection) is all configured (e.g. with DHCP or a static address) and working. Basically, make sure you can pull up web pages.\nFor your LAN interface (which might be a second network card or a wireless \ncard), select “Shared to other computers” in the IPv4 Settings tab.\n\nIf everything works right, NetworkManager should have auto-configured a subnet and DHCP server on your LAN interface, and is ready for sharing your Internet connection.\nTo do it through terminal\nIt's very simple to masquerade (internet connection sharing in Windows language ) on Linux with a few lines of iptables and ip_forward commands.\nFirst of all you have to flush and delete existing firewall rules.\nSo flush rules by typing in terminal:\niptables -F\niptables -t nat -F\niptables -t mangle -F\n\nNow delete these chains:\niptables -X\niptables -t nat -X\niptables -t mangle -X\n\nNow it's time to save the iptables rules so type:\nservice iptables save\nservice iptables restart\n\nNow all rules and chains have been cleared!\nCheck it in /etc/sysconfig/iptables which has all default rules set to accept.\nNow open /etc/rc.d/rc.local and insert the line:\necho \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nAnd then save and close the file.\nNow asuming that your internet interface is eth0, type:\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\nservice iptables save\nservice iptables restart\n\nNote: check if iptables is set to start during boot up.\nOr check the status of your iptables service:\nchkconfig –list iptables\n\nIf level 5 is on then it's ok othewise start the service at level 5 or level 2345.\nCitation:\nhttps://jeremy.visser.name/2009/03/simple-internet-connection-sharing-with-networkmanager/\nhttps://www.howtoforge.com/internet-connection-sharing-masquerading-on-linux\n", "Q: How do I burn a bootable install disk that my MacBook Pro can read? I have an old MacBook Pro 2,2 which doesn't run recent OS X versons and I'd like to wipe it and install Ubuntu Studio (ie. not a dual boot situation). \n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded the ISO and burned a DVD with Disk Utility but it was\nnot recognizable in Mac OS, nor bootable. \n\n*I then used \"the Unarchiver\" to get at the files in the ISO (which Disk Utility doesn't recognize as a valid ISO) and burned all the contents of the folder to a DVD by selecting them all, right clicking on them, and choosing \"\"Burn 13 items to disk\"\". This version is readable but not bootable.    \n\n*Next I tried to use a USB stick, following these directions for Mac OS X. The resulting stick is not recognized from within Mac OS X and also is not bootable.\n\n*I've also tried creating a USB stick using UNetbootin but the USB stick is readable on Mac OS X, but when I reboot while holding Option/Alt it doesn't come up as a boot option (just the Harddrive shows, same as #2).\n\n*I installed rEFInd to help with booting and the DVDs made above still don't work. (See below for further detail on the rEFInd attempts)\n\n\nUsing rEFInd:\n\n\n*The disk burned in #1 above gives the following screen but nothing is selectable and no keypresses are registered: \n\n*The disk burned in #2 above still doesn't load.\n\n*The USB stick in #4 begins to boot and then crashes as follows: \nI have yet to try @dsefvonz's suggestion (hopefully tonight) but am also open to any other ideas!\n\nA: Which ISO did you try? \nI think only the x86_64 is efi bootable.\nInstalled 15.10 from usb on a MacBookPro5.3 recently - everything except wifi and the nvidia 9400M, 9600M GT combo worked. Had to boot with nomodeset to get unaccelerated graphics to work (accelerated works with nvidia drivers). \n\nA: The problem lies in the fact that your mac has a 32 bit efi boot loader and is unable to address 64 bit boot schemes.  This means that any 64 bit os will have a 64bit boot loader and so your mac won't be able to see it.\nThere are two options that I have discovered for my mac pro 1.1.  The first is to use unetbootin to put ubuntu on to a usb stick and then head over to plopboot and grab the bootloader iso and burn that to a cd.  Place the cd in the drive and then reboot your mac.  You will then be given the choice to boot from usb.  Select this and then leave the live system to boot, and then install.  Note that as of writing Ubuntu 15.10 has a bug, so unetbootin,usb-creator and similar do not successfully work to create the pendrive install.  To overcome this, try using gnome-disk-utility and choose to restore an image to the pendrive.  I haven't tried this myself (I'm about to now) but there are reports of it working.\nThe second option is to edit the cd image to change the boot loader files, which I have done with a windows 7 image but haven't yet tried with a ubuntu image.  Instructions are here - http://www.jowie.com/select-cd-rom-boot-type.\nA third idea springs to mind, which you may have described above - to install from the harddrive, via grub.  You might need to install grub first using super grub cd or similar.  There is a good article here\nInstall Ubuntu from ISO image directly from hard disk of a system running Linux?\nOne thing that you will need to watch when ubuntu is installed, is system temperature.  Install macfanctld and then edit the config file (/etc/macfanctl.conf) and increase the minimum fan speed to 1200.  This consumes more energy but is a safe operating speed for all conditions.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: So since my computer seemed to have problems both creating a bootable DVD and booting from the USB although the UNetBootin stick seemed to be valid), I think I've found a solution as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition Mac Harddrive with an additional small partition for the installer (FAT), a new partition for Ubuntu (FAT), and leaving Mac OS X on one partition (this wasn't part of the initial plan, but maybe good for future firmware updates)\n\n*Unmount USB stick, then copy the UNetBootin USB stick over to the installer partition using dd\n\n*Reboot and now I have a penguin showing up in the rEFInd menu and can boot to the Ubuntu Live CD. \n\n\nFor more in depth on how to do this, check this answer.\nI haven't installed yet or tested whether wifi or anything else works but those are other questions now that I can at least boot to Ubuntu! (And if things are working well after installing on the partition, perhaps in the future I can burn a bootable DVD from within Ubuntu and install over the whole harddrive rather than a smaller partition)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10: CIFS not mounting on bootup I'm trying to mount an IOmega NAS drive through fstab, but it doesn't mount on boot.

So i rebooted the Computer and it was working perfectly well, but from time to time my computer wont wake up from sleep, or sometimes just freeze.\nSo how do i check the whole OS for errors and repair these?\nIs there some way to reinstall kubuntu without overwriting Data that has nothing to do with the OS, or just adding anything that is missing?\n\nA: The best way to do a check is, before installing the Ubuntu 15.10, you should check the SHA1 hash :\nYou can do it by typing :\nsha1sum {file}\n\nIf you want to send the file together with its sha1sum output redirect the output to a file:\nsha1sum {file} > {file}.sha1\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu start up issue Very new to Linux.\nDid a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, formatted all my drives.\nEverything is working fine, except on start-up I'm getting an internal error saying:\n/usr/lib/unity-settings-daemon/unity-settings-daemon\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Looks like this was a bug that was fixed: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-settings-daemon/+bug/1326636\nOpen the dash, search for \"Software Updater,\" and let it install updates for you.

It should boot after a while, but if it doesn't, then try installing the full OS onto your hard disk, and then install the correct GPU drivers for your card.\nAlso, see this question.\nYou can also try adding the nomodeset option during bootup if nothing else works.\n", "Q: Wifi adapter not functioning after Ubuntu 15.10 upgrade from 15.04 Edit:\nStill nothing I have gone through every link I can find.

I remember my first Ubuntu install - boot from a 3 1/2\" floppy, tell it network install / dhcp / ftp, and come back in an hour and it was done.\nI just upgraded from 15.04 to 15.10. It asked \"Do you want to upgrade?\" I replied \"Yes\" and went to bed, because I knew it had over 1,000 files and over 1 GB to download.\nI got up this morning and checked the upgrade. It was stuck at a \"Downloads complete. Do you want to upgrade?\" prompt. I muttered, answered \"Yes\", and went to work.\nTonight I got home, again expecting the upgrade to be complete. Again it was hung at a prompt \"Do you want to restart the services as they are upgraded?\" When I answered Yes, the system chugged merrily along for a while longer.\nI'm screaming at the computer now. It's been as frustrating as a Windows install. I answer \"Yes, Yes Yes, Do it\", get a reply like \"This may take a while\", leave and let it run (instead of being frustrated) only to come back and find that at some point before completion, the upgrade process has halted for yet another \"Are you sure?\" prompt.\nAnd of course I know there will be a \"you must reboot to complete the installation\" phase soon.\nI'm a big boy. When I say \"yes I understand and I have backups\" I mean \"go ahead and do it, and I'll pick up the pieces if I have to.\"\nIt's very annoying to have \"Are you sure?\" followed (not immediately) by \"Are you sure?\" only to have another \"Are you sure?\" ad nauseum, and endless delays because it's waiting for the answer to a question that already has been answered.\nUbuntu is a great OS, but please stop trying to coddle us like Microsoft does, and treat us like grown-ups.\n\nA: Um, no? Ubuntu is giving you information about the upgrade. You only have 3 prompts to answer.

I have Debian 8.1 in my system now and the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as ISO image. \nI know these pieces of advices for OSX here about making bootable usb in OSX. \nPseudo unsuccessful solution\nI did not manage to install unetbootin in Debian 8.1. \nAlso, copying byte-wisely did not work. \nI made Windows 10 disk and opened the .iso image there. \nThis way, I managed to install Ubuntu 14.04 but it required also ruining the Windows 10 installation; meaning two times work, since using other system to start the system. \nHowever, it is frustrating that I could not create easily Ubuntu USB where the system would boot.\nI get now this after an unsuccessful try\n\nThere has to really be better options installing Ubuntu 14.04. \nSolution which works\nReject USB and burn the image to DVD. \nHowever, this is not an answer to the question.\n\nHow can you make a bootable USB of Ubuntu 14.04 in Debian 8.1?\n\nA: For absolute newbies:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert USB drive in your laptop running any linux distro.\n\n*Its recommended to unmount the drive before writing, in case your file-manager has auto-mounted it. \n\n*run fdisk -l as superuser and know the alias of your usb drive (sdb, sdc, etc.)\n\n*run the command: dd if=/path/to/downloaded/iso of=/dev/sdx as superuser (replace sdx with your own device alias).\n\n*Boot with the new usb drive.\n\n\nBe careful with the dd command! Many people have lost their data with that one.\n\nA: Pretty sure the step is mentioned in that link:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1m\nWhere /dev/sdX/ is the /dev/ path to the disk you are writing to.\n\nA: To create a live usb of any linux distro download unetbootin form here:\nhttp://unetbootin.github.io/\nDownload the distro with unetbootin or download an iso from the homepage of the distro. You already downloaded ubuntu 14.04 so you can use that.\nFollow the instructions in the link and create the live usb.  \n\nA: Based on Prahlad Yeri's answer and \nthe Debian GNU/Linux Installation Guide\ninstructions on how to copy the iso image to a usb key.\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert a USB key in your computer.\n\n*Find the device name \nsudo fdisk -l\n# An example of device name might be `/dev/sdb1`.\n\n\n*Unmount the USB key. \nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\n\n\n*Transfer the iso image to the key\nsudo cp debian-live-9.5.0-amd64-gnome.iso /dev/sdb\n# The iso should be copied to `sdb` and not to `sdb1` !\n\n\n*Restart the computer\nTo boot in your USB key, you might have to change the BIOS setup, and change some options such as enabling legacy boot, and disabling secure boot.\n", "Q: Package versions in Ubuntu I use Ubuntu through a virtual machine (VM Workstation Player) and sometimes download packages through the terminal. Some of the packages I download are not the latest version. For example, I downloaded Eclipse IDE and Wireshark and some versions were downloaded. Even when I try to update those packages, it tells me that the packages are up to date.\nWhy can't I download the latest versions and how can I fix this?\n\nA: Some Linux distributions (distros) are more \"conservative\" or \"prudent\" than others and prefer to use more stable versions of packages, meaning you won't be able to download the latest versions through the standard repositories.\nIf you want the latest version of some softwares, you'll have to use alternative repositories by installing a Personal Package Archive (PPA) on your Ubuntu distro.\nFor instance, If you want to use the latest version of LibreOffice, you'll have to install this PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nBe careful to install only trusted PPA, coming from reliable sources (see Are \"PPA's\" safe to add to my system, and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?).\nTo install a PPA, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*add a line to the sources.list file in /etc/apt.

In this specific case we are dealing with the following structure:\n${parameter:?word}\n              Display  Error  if  Null or Unset.  If\n              parameter is null or unset, the expan‐\n              sion  of  word  (or  a message to that\n              effect if  word  is  not  present)  is\n              written  to the standard error and the\n              shell,  if  it  is  not   interactive,\n              exits.  Otherwise, the value of param‐\n              eter is substituted.\n\n( taken from man bash )\nIn short, if a variable is unset or doesn't exist, throw an error, like so:\nxieerqi:$ echo ${NOTSET?this param not set}          \nmksh: NOTSET: this param not set\n\nIf variable is set, do nothing \nxieerqi:$ echo ${PWD?this param not set}             \n/home/xieerqi\n\nIn your specific case , debug parameter is to be passed to node , and if it's not set, show the user what values should it be set to, namely --nocrankshaft --nolazy --nodead_code_elimination --debug-brk=15454\n", "Q: Need help installing windows on linux I have Linux installed right now and i download windows 10 ISO.

Repeat rm N for each partition number that you saw in the parted -l output.\n\n*Make the new partition:\nsudo parted --align optimal /dev/sdX mkpart primary fat32 4 7900\n\nMakes the new partition, starting at 4, and ending at 1 less than the size shown from parted -l.

Other than \"failed to create empty partition\".  I tried all available types including ext options.

I mainly needed to use parted to make it a GPT partition.  It seems simply ridiculous to me that neither Disks nor any other gui utility I tried had that option, much less defaulted to it after recognizing that it was a 4TB aray.    Not to mention the unfixed \"show in user interface\" bug in Disks that cost me many more hours trying to mount the disks.   Honestly, if XP supported >2TB partitions, I would have gone back to it days ago.  This process was pretty painful and the help docs are all over the place leading to many dead ends.

I took that to mean my attempt to manually resize the partition with Windows 10 on it and install Ubuntu there back-fired and tanked my install of Windows 10.\nHowever I came to appreciate what the 'Boot Loader' in parenthesis meant, when on a whim I went to check if selecting what I thought would load Windows 8 correctly and shutting down from there would enable me to access Windows 10. I didn't anticipate it'd launch Windows Boot Loader with options for Windows 10 and 8 there. Successfully booted 10 and disabled the Quick Boot option as I read I should to make GRUB work better, alas it had the same options when I rebooted and my PC came up with GRUB first.\n\nThis is certainly serviceable as it is, I can run all my OSes with only an extra selection involved, but I'm inexperienced with Linux and GRUB, so I thought I'd ask if I could get the options of booting directly into Ubuntu, Windows 10, and Windows 8 to show in GRUB and bypass the Windows Boot Loader entirely by doing some extra configuration?

The MBR(512 bytes) is completely replaced by the grub. The grub creates its own partition table and uses it. At boot time after BIOS is initialized, GRUB is loaded which further goes to stage 1, 1.5 and 2.\n\n2. Only the boot code of MBR(around 446 bytes) is replaced with GRUB and GRUB uses the partition table of the DEFAULT MBR. \nKindly help me clarifying things. \n\nA: Here is the corresponding section from the documentation: 10 GRUB image files\n\nboot.img\nOn PC BIOS systems, this image is the first part of GRUB to start. It is written to a master boot record (MBR) or to the boot sector of a partition. Because a PC boot sector is 512 bytes, the size of this image is exactly 512 bytes.\nThe sole function of boot.img is to read the first sector of the core image from a local disk and jump to it. Because of the size restriction, boot.img cannot understand any file system structure, so grub-setup hardcodes the location of the first sector of the core image into boot.img when installing GRUB.\n\nYou should read the rest of the chapter and also 3.4 BIOS installation. \nBoth of your assumptions or given options are inaccurate:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nWhen we dual boot a computer with windows and linux…\n\nThat is the first wrong assumption. Bare hard drives don't ship with any operating system.\n\n*\nThe grub creates its own partition table and uses it.\n\nThat would imply loosing information about all previously created partitions, but GRUB is not a partition manager in the first place. The format of the partition table and partitions themselves have already been configured and created on a blank drive at the time GRUB or any other kind of bootloader is invoked in an operating system installation process. The role of a bootloader package during installation is to detect if it is compatible with the environment and use appropriate mechanisms to deploy itself. \n\n*\nGRUB is loaded which further goes to stage 1, 1.5 and 2.\n\nThere are no stages in GRUB 2's design, read the For GRUB Legacy users section from the first link above.\n\n*\nOnly the boot code of MBR(around 446 bytes) is replaced with GRUB and GRUB uses the partition table of the DEFAULT MBR. \n\nThere is no \"DEFAULT MBR\", only the partition table you chose to use in previous steps of the installation process and it doesn't have to be a partition table in the legacy MBR format at all. If there is no other mechanism than to read and parse 512 bytes, replace whatever bytes and write 512 bytes back then this will be done and it shouldn't even matter to you since nothing else but what you chose should be performed on the disk and its layout. You may even find that your hard drive writes whole 4K sectors.\nN.B.: It's hard to find actual BIOS systems in stores these days. Hardware certification for Windows 8 required manufacturers to ship UEFI systems. Intel and motherboard manufacturers were shipping UEFI systems for a few years at that time, but they had to rely on compatibility to legacy boot mechanisms until Microsoft decided to switch.\n", "Q: Resize /boot in LVM I'm trying to resize my /boot partition because Ubuntu is complaining every time when it wants to install a new kernel that there isn't enough space.\nSo I made a live stick with the current GNOME Ubuntu and tried to resize my /dev/sda2 with gparted.

The command show lists \"all package records\" of the given package. There you find immediately after the package name a line beginning with \"Priority\" (or \"Essential\", then \"Priority\" is on line 3), so to find out if a given package is installed by default or not you use\napt-cache show <package>|head -n2\n\ne.g.\napt-cache show plymouth|head -n2\nPackage: plymouth\nPriority: standard\n\napt-cache show htop|head -n2\nPackage: htop\nPriority: optional\n\napt-cache show bash|head -n3\nPackage: bash\nEssential: yes\nPriority: required\n\nSo the value of Priority (required, standard, optional) will tell you if the package will be installed by default or not.\n", "Q: APT method bzip2 doesn't exist I tried to update my system on Xubuntu  : sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade.\nI got this error message :\nE: Le pilote pour la méthode /usr/lib/apt/methods/bzip2 n'a pu être trouvé.\n\nIn english the driver for the method /usr/lib/apt/methods/bzip2 can't be found.\nI checked the folder : \n$ ls /usr/lib/apt/methods/\ncdrom  copy  file  ftp  gpgv  gzip  http  https  mirror  rred  rsh  ssh  xz\n\nActually for the moment, APT can't install anything cause it can't unzip with bzip2 : the method doesn't exist inside the proper folder.\n\nA: apt does not depend on bzip2 - bzip2 is only a symbolic link to gzip.\nCreate the link\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/apt/methods/gzip /usr/lib/apt/methods/bzip2\n\n\nInstall bzip2\nsudo apt-get install bzip2\n\nAlternative\napt-get download bzip2\nsudo dpkg -i bzip2*.deb\n\n", "Q: ls vs. ls -C difference commands ls and ls -C seem to produce the same results - display by columns.\nIs there any difference?\n\nA: Referring to info coreutils 'ls invocation':\n\n-C' --format=vertical'\nList files in columns, sorted vertically.

If it doesn't, you have to configure it to show up, but that is another topic.\n\n*Access the boot options during startup (there should be something like \"Press F11 to access boot menu\") and choose whatever you want.\n\n\nOh, and\n\n\n*Don't use Windows XP. At all. Ever.\n\n\nFor further information on installing Ubuntu on a Windows PC, have a look at this.\n\nA: Assuming you have an older desktop computer with legacy BIOS ...  \nFirst disable hibernation in your Windows XP installation.  \nOpen command prompt as administrator and execute :  \npowercfg /h off  \n\nShut down the machine completely - do NOT reboot !\nThen reinstall the GRUB boot loader.  \nBoot from the Ubuntu installation media - open a terminal and execute: \nsudo mount /dev/sd** /mnt  \nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sd*\n\nNote : sd* = disk | sd** = system partition  \nTo identify the partition numbers use GParted - it is included in the Ubuntu install media.  \nYou now can select which operating system you want to boot from the GRUB boot menu.  \n", "Q: Is it likely that a fix for the RT3290 Bluetooth driver problem will be available for 14.04 and 15.10 in the near future?

I downloaded the repository using a local link (mirror ini Indonesia), but some of the repository is in error. What would be a link or similar for the download?\n\nA: You can rsync a mirror out. The benefit of this is you can update by just running the command again. The downside is that you're downloading everything... We're talking hundreds of gigabytes.\nIf you just want to cache updates between lan clients, a caching proxy is probably a better idea.\nBut assuming you want everything, let's start by creating a directory for our mirror.\nmkdir -p ubuntu-mirror/dists\n\nThen we can rsync into that. My version below just gets you the bits you need, rather than syncing every release. If you need -backports or -proposed, add them.\nrsync -avz rsync://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise{,-security,-updates} ubuntu-mirror/dists/\n\nThere is a mirror at the University of Indonesia. They may have a better network and they're almost certainly going to have better latency than a London server for you. Substitute kambing.ui.ac.id in for archive.ubuntu.com. Everything is signed so as long as you aren't spuriously adding keys, you can trust mirrors.\nNow that will take about a hundred years to run the first time. I've no idea, it really depends on the server, your connection and how big the repo actually is at that moment in time. It will almost certainly take so long that you'll be out of date immediately. Thankfully updating is faster.\nIf you find kambing.ui.ac.id has broken packages, use the central server.\nBut after that, you can just share it however you like and add it to your apt sources. Again, it's all using the standard keys, so you shouldn't need to add anything else except its location to your /etc/apt/sources.list.\n", "Q: Seemingly duplicate trusted GPG keys in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d I was recently dealing with this bug in apt and was trying to figure out which .gpg files I could remove to /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d to stop the W: GPG error: NO_PUBKEY error I was getting with apt-get update.\nSo, I went and ran ls in the /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d directory, to see if there were any old keys for repositories I had removed.

But your partition table shows an EFI system partition (/dev/sda2), which never gets created unless an OS was booted via UEFI and tried/succeeded in installing itself.\nFurther, Windows needs to be coaxed via special methods to install&boot on a GPT disk in a BIOS system, it could not have happened on its own.\nThus its extremely likely that your system has UEFI firmware.

My question is related to a problem that occurs with SSD drives: it's commonly known that these drives wear out quickly; they have a limited amount of write cycles. So writing a few Gigabytes large file to it every time the system is hibernating is not what I want. \nA question that arises is - is it possible to force the system to write that file to a different drive?\nFor those in doubt I would like to know how to achieve this without moving the swap data to a different partition. I want the swap data to stay on SSD to benefit from the higher performance during runtime and move/set the hibernation data/file only to HDD to avoid writing to SSD when hibernating.\n\nA: What you're asking for is impossible using your current setup:\nYou have a swap partition and that's where the hibernation goes.  Ubuntu is not Windows with a separate Hibernation file that takes up additional space on your hard disk.\nHowever, if you change your set-up and start using 2 swap files instead of just one swap partition, you can fool the system to swap to HDD instead of SSD just prior to hibernation by activating the HDD swap and deactivating the SSD swap file.\nIs this a good idea? No, because using the swap file on your SSD will wear out the SSD much more then the simple fact of hibernation...\nBut anyway, that's what you asked for and that's what you'll get:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create 2 new swap files. Have a look here for the size if you've got more then 1GB of RAM. In the below example sda is the SSD and sdb the HDD.\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda/szMountPoint/SSDSwapFile bs=1024 count=iSizeInKBytes\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb/szMountPoint/HDDSwapFile bs=1024 count=iSizeInKBytes\n\nwhere szMountPoint is the string denominating the mount point you want the file to be and iSizeInKBytes is the size. \n\n*Now activate both swaps:\nmkswap --check --label SSDSwap /dev/sda/szMountPoint/SSDSwapFile\nmkswap --check --label HDDSwap /dev/sdb/szMountPoint/HDDSwapFile\n\n\n*Remove your existing swap partition from fstab\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nNow you have 2 swap files that you can activate/deactivate with the commands swapon and swapoff and you can control everything you want including hibernating to the HDD!\nFreebie\nHave a look here on how to optimise your SSD to have it wear out less (example is for a USB stick, but the parameters are good for an SSD as well)\n", "Q: computer won't boot from DVD, how do I upgrade?

You can connect your phone to your WiFi and usb tether the connection to your laptop.\nNext open the Additional drivers program from the Dash app launcher and look for the Broadcom wireless adapter (I am currently not on my ubuntu machine so I cannot check the exact text that will be shown, if anybody has the same card, free to comment and I'll edit the answer). Check the use proprietary driver checkbox and hit apply. It will take a few minutes and your driver will be installed.

The famous so-called virus-and-hacker-free Mac is a thing of the past: As it gets more popular it gets more vulnerabilities. Will Linux be the same at some point in time? Is it getting less of more secure?\nI know: \n\n\"No computer or network system is 100 percent secure. There is always a vulnerability in every system.\"\n\n\nA: A system is never 100% secure and there are always vulnerabilities, in every OS. Some are known and some still want to get discovered though. It's a fact though that the UNIX/Linux security architecture (from which also Apple's OSX is derived) is much stronger than the one Windows had in the past and I believe it's even still slightly stronger than what they have nowadays, although the difference got minimized. \nThe advantage of a system with a very low user count is that hackers (only speaking of black hats that want to attack you) have a pretty small interest in spending their time on Linux, because even if they find an open backdoor, they can't make much profit with it as there are too few potential targets.\nSo the more users an OS has, the more interesting is it for people with criminal powers to find and exploit vulnerabilities. This however means also, that more white hat researchers will check it out and fix some of those problems. So there will always be a balance between white and black, though experience shows us that the dark side usually has a slightly higher growth rate.\nHowever, the OS itself is not getting more insecure or vulnerable once there is a high user base. The weak points remain the same, they just were not known earlier. But as knowing a problem is required to be able to fix it...\nHowever, it's not really correct to say that Linux in general has a small user base today. Desktop computers mainly run Windows and no Linux distributions, but that's not the only type of computer we have. A majority of the web servers operate on Linux as well as e.g. the Android OS for smartphones is actually Linux-based. These systems all have major differences, so a hack on one would probably not work on the other,  especially as installed Software is much more vulnerable than the system/kernel itself, so an attacker would rather try to break into that or trick the user.\nAdditionally (thanks @Rinzwind) it's also important to say that Linux systems in general can be seen as systems for advanced users (total computer noobs probably haven't even heard anything about it yet), whereas Windows is just what everybody uses, no matter what skills he/she has, as it comes preinstalled on almost every machine nowadays. This is important because many attacks depend on vulnerabilities of the interface between keyboard and chair, also known as \"The User\". Of course, many also just think they're experts and pay even less attention when downloading .deb packages from websites or compiling foreign code from source, because they believe the myth of \"bulletproof Linux\". So just copy-pasting sudo commands or installing Software as root is and stays dangerous, because Linux systems are not designed to protect the user from themselves!\n\nTo conclude we can say that higher user numbers make the OS more secure in theory, as more vulnerabilities are detected and fixed, especially as it is Open Source. But practically this also increases the number of attacks, as it becomes a more interesting target. \nThe system itself is however usually the strongest part of the security chain, the weak parts are vulnerabilities in additional software (browsers, flashplayer...) or the users themselves, as it's easy to trick non-experts and let them install malicious programs or run evil copy-pasted sudo commands.\n\nA: Systems with a Linux kernel have been in widespread use for a long time, and unlike the typical desktop computer, they are always online and actively accepting connections.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Servers.2C_mainframes_and_supercomputers\nWhat's more, compromising a single web server is a much higher-value target than compromising a single desktop.\nSo, I reject your assumption that the number of desktop users would necessarily lead to increased targeting.\nThat being said, people hack what they know. Linux-based systems have long been a popular system among such people, however.\n", "Q: Update ubuntu 15.04 to 15.10 I am currently using ubuntu 15.04, but I want to update this version to the latest ubuntu version i.e 15.10.I have changed the settings as required, but I am not able to find update manager in the search box.\n\nA: You will have to run Software Updater, allow it to update the system.

If you're just going to use it to listen to music, watch movies, etc. then the X.Org X server(open source) drivers are just fine. Ubuntu identifies the Intel HD graphics as your graphics source because Ubuntu uses it for graphics(everything you see on your screen). \nIn my opinion, the open source graphics drivers are just fine.

What did I do? So I was playing around with a live disk experiment (using an external HHD as a live disk) and I made a script that made 9,023 directories on my desktop before I could stop it. Being the noob I am I ran this command to clean up my mess:\nrm -rf Desktop \n\nAnd then made a new folder called Desktop in my home directory. My computer worked fine for a few seconds then everything but my mouse froze. Thankfully it was all on a live disk so nothing was lost but I would like to know what I actually did. \nI tried to google \"ubuntu deleted desktop directory\" and other variations, but all I got was people trying to get rid of it, not bring it back. \nEDIT: there was some interest in the fork bomb that I ran. Don't laugh: \nwhile true; do\nfor i in a; do\ndeclare b=b+1\nmkdir \"$b\" \ndone\ndone\n\nI kind of guessed what it would do but I was used to working with Python where I could kill it quickly before it got too far out of control. \nTo anyone else who reads this at some point in the future: don't run that fork bomb, it makes a mess. \nP.S. Before you say how dumb it was for me to do that in the first place please note that I was in a live disk that was set aside just for the purpose of doing stuff like that so I can learn.  \n\nA: It's good that you did this with a Live USB or you'd have lost some data, almost certainly. Cleaning up after that would have been a huge waste of time.\nFirst, you ran what's known as a fork bomb. A fork bomb is a simple, often obfuscated, command that will keep spawning new processes, folders, or files until it fills up disk space, eats CPU cycles, or consumes all the RAM. This results in the computer freezing because it has no more resources to give.\nSecond, you deleted your DE (desktop environment) which is what you see, it's the graphics that you interact with, the windows that you have open (sort of - there's a window manager but we'll skip that for now). Basically, you killed everything that you could click on.\nIt's good to learn. Use your favorite search engine before typing in commands into the terminal. Always, always know what the command does before pressing ENTER. I can not emphasize that enough. There are people who will intentionally mislead you. The terminal is a potentially powerful tool. It's your greatest tool in your toolbox but, like all tools, it must be wielding carefully.\nIf you'll tell us what the command was, for the fork bomb, we might be able to digest that and tell you exactly what it did and why. You seem like a curious sort so maybe you'd also like to learn that? \n\nEdit:\nYou've now included the code for your fork bomb. I'll include this for the next person to come along. If you look at it and parse the logic, you can see that it's saying that so long as a condition exits (is true) then do something (make an enumerated directory) and, because there's nothing telling it to stop (a loop), it will keep on going until the resources are consumed, RAM is eaten up, or until there's just some sort of collision that makes things freeze up. (This could be all sorts of things like a memory leak but that's probably not a factor here.)\nFrom the sounds of things, or from what I'm reading, it appears like you did a pretty good job. This is a clear warning for others, to not run your code (you should add that to your post with the edit function or someone else can if you want). It was creative. I don't think I've ever seen it done quite that way but the theory is pretty much the same with all of them. Again, for others, this can be hidden in obfuscated code or code you simply may not understand if you don't know how to parse Perl (as an example). This is a fine example of what not to do.\nI dare say, you should finish installing it and have some more fun. Just keep good backups. \n\nA: Rebooting, re-creating the desktop directory from a virtual console, and then logging into the desktop again should fix it. Your computer crashed either because you ran a fork bomb or because your desktop directory disappeared while your desktop environment was trying to use it, but in either case my suggested fix will repair it (although you've lost whatever was on your desktop).\n\nA: No, that is not a forkbomb, as a forkbomb runs a program repeatedly, until your cpu is gone, you might be interested in zip bombs though, which is a zip file that is compressed to look like it contains almost no data, like 42.zip with its 42 kbs of compressed data, and it extracts the zip file, OH NO, you have Teribytes of data, the computer cant process this stuff, your computer will now crash repeatdly, basically a bomb is a program that exists to harm your cpu. but you deleted core system files, its like deleting your C: drive in windows and creating a new one, your C: drive contains the important files on windows so if you delete that your os is like, WHERE IS THE C:/Windows/AUTOEXEC.bat, youre computer will now no longer boot up again. \n", "Q: How to limit network bandwidth apt-mirror I am setting up a local repository server and downloading the repository takes up to lots of internet bandwidth. How do I limit the apt-mirror to download with 2MB/s?\nInternet connection has become 300ms slow.\n\nA: According to another question over on ServerFault, apt-mirror has this ability built-in. Just add the following line of code to your mirror.list file:\nset limit_rate 50k\n\nThe answer also states that the limit is per thread, so if you have 10 threads, the limit would be 50k * 10 = 500k. It also appears that the setting is in KiloBytes/s instead of KiloBits.\nSource: https://serverfault.com/questions/88780/how-can-i-limit-the-bandwidth-of-apt-mirror\n", "Q: Reinstall browser? Is it possible to reinstall the default browser on ubuntu-touch?\nAlthough I did not uninstall the browser, it seems it somehow disappeared. When trying to start the browser, it seems the app will start, but shortly after the newly opened window just closes. I also cannot find the browser any more in the installed programs.\nI don't use the browser very often and found an alternative in the Ubuntu-Store, but trying to open links in web apps would start the default browser, which does not work any more.\nAny help is welcome.\nNote: I don't think this is important, but I am using ubuntu-touch on a bq aquaris 4.5 phone.\nPS: Result of troubleshooting as per Velkans suggestions (promts are omitted as I write this by hand).\ndpkg --verify webbrowser-app\n??5??????   /usr/share/lintian/overrides/webbrowser-app\n\nI deleted the contents of /home/phablet/.local/share/webbrowser-app/ to no avail.\nwebbrowser-app --desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/applications/webbrowser-app.desktop\n\nrebooted my device, the first time, returned nothing the second (it just gave me the promt as if the command had exited successfully) and rebooted the device the third time (after a short lag). No error messages are shown, I don't know where to search for log files.\n\nA: The original problem could have been a corrupt QML cache, which presents the symptom described where the app doesn't start but the window may appear briefly. To remedy that remove the cache, for example:\nrm -r .cache/QML/Apps/webbrowser-app/\n\nthen start the app. \nThe same applies for any app that doesn't start, just delete the cache folder for that app.\nNote that an update for the app will also trigger recreating the cache.\n\nA: It's not installed as a click package. It's a *.deb package, so it's inside the 'OS image' and not updated separately.\nTo check the integrity of this package run dpkg --verify webbrowser-app in the terminal (it should only complain about /usr/share/lintian/overrides/webbrowser-app). The OS image is read only after the install, so it's very unlikely that the problem is there. \nOther location to check is /home/phablet/.local/share/webbrowser-app/ - the directory with settings and cache. Move it to some other place and launch the browser, that will reset something.\nIf it doesn't help, try to launch the webbrowser-app from terminal:\nwebbrowser-app --desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/applications/webbrowser-app.desktop\n\nAnd read the error logs.\n", "Q: Create folder loop function doesn't work I have created a function in a .sh file that creates directories in a loop with 3 parameters int: start, end and folder name name\nBut I am getting the following error:\nSyntax error: \"(\" unexpected\n\nHere's function code:\n#!/bin/bash\nfunction createDirs () {\n  start =  \"$1\";\n  end =  \"$2\";\n  name =  \"$3\";\n  for i in {start..end}; do\n    mkdir name\"$i\"\n  done\n}\n\ncreateDirs \"@\"\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nThank you for your time appreciate your kind help.\n\nA: Just simply use\nmkdir name{1..2}\n\ninstead of your script/function.\nThe command above will create two folders\nname1\nname2\n\n\nAlternatively - a corrected version of your script:\n#!/bin/bash\nfunction createDirs () {\n  start=\"$1\";\n  end=\"$2\";\n  name=\"$3\";\n  for ((i=start; i<end; i++)); do\n    mkdir \"$name$i\"\n  done\n}\n\ncreateDirs \"$@\"\n\n", "Q: My own variable for long paths I'm writing some backup script and target path is pretty long.

Because this is what I get:\ncp: cannot create regular file ‘$TARGET/some folder with spaces/file.txt’: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: The variable assignment is correct, but you have a syntax mistake in your command that uses the variable:\nWhat you need to type instead is:\n\ncp file.txt \"${TARGET}/some folder with spaces/file.txt\"\n\n\ncp file.txt \"$TARGET/some folder with spaces/file.txt\"\n\nNote the two changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double quotes \"...\" instead of single quotes '...', because double quotes allow bash variable expansion, while single quotes prohibit that and keep the string as it is.\n\n*As the variable is directly embedded into the path string and no spaces are before and after its name, we need ${variable} instead of just $variable here. The curled braces tell bash where exactly the variable name ends, otherwise this would not be clear.\nThe curly braces are not wrong, but also not necessary here in this case, as the next character after the variable name is a /, which is not allowed in the name itself and therefore separates the name from the rest of the string.\nThanks to @heemayl's answer for correcting this!\n\nA: There are certain rules of setting the name of a variable in bash:\n\n\n*\n\n*Vaiables's name can only contain characters from [[:alnum:]_] i.e. A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and _.\n\n*Variable's name can not start with a digit\nSo while getting the value of the variable, unless you have any of these characters following the variable you don't need {} to wrap the variable's name:\n$ 1foo=bar\n1foo=bar: command not found\n\n$ foo1=bar\n\n$ echo \"$foo1\"\nbar\n\n$ echo \"$foo12\"\n\n$ echo \"${foo1}2\"\nbar2\n\n$ echo \"$foo1_\"\n\n$ echo \"${foo1}_\"\nbar_\n\nIn your case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the single quotes and put double quotes while using cp, everything inside a single quote is taken literally so the variable will not be expanded\n\n*Double quote is necessary because you have spaces in file path, so if you don't use quotes it will suffer from word splitting while using cp\n\n*While getting the value, $TARGET is followed by / which is not a valid variable name constituent character so {} is not neccessary\n$ TARGET='/media/user/externaldrive/folder with spaces/blahblah'\n\n$ echo '$TARGET' \n$TARGET\n\n$ echo '$TARGET/some folder with spaces/file.txt'\n$TARGET/some folder with spaces/file.txt\n\n$ echo \"$TARGET/some folder with spaces/file.txt\"\n/media/user/externaldrive/folder with spaces/blahblah/some folder with spaces/file.txt\n\n\nA: Short answer: YES!

So I've learned that with touch -a and touch -m one can change access and modification times to a file respectively.\nBut why?\nWikipedia says:\n\n\" An updated access or modification date can be important for a\n  variety of other programs such as backup utilities or the make\n  command-line interface programming utility.\"\n\nBut I still don't get it.\nAnyone has 1 or 2 real-life scenarios?\nAlso, can this command be misused?\n\nA: Well one of the wikipedia examples states that it's useful with the make command. Make is a program used to execute Makefiles which contain a build script for any source code and if you run the command, it stored the current Makefile's modification time inside the directory.\nNow say that you want to rebuild the source for whatever reason. if you were to run make again it would tell you that there's nothing to do, since it has been run already. So you can run touch -m \"source.file\" to simulate a file modification. Running make a third time would then recognize the change and rebuild the source code.\nAnother example would be to force a backup. If you're running a backup utility that for example backs up files based on when they have been modified. You could force the program to back up (or exclude from the backup) a file by changing it's modification time.\n\ncreate the false impression about the age of a file\nfor example for use in backup schemes. You might want to not update a backup with a newer one since they're identical, or since the changes are irrelevant compared to the expense of updating a backup on, say, a slow line to a remote host. To achieve this, you have the simple option of marking the backup file with a newer timestamp, not faking but declaring that the validity timestamp of that file is now a different one.\nThe impression about the age of the file is now indeed false, but its meaning is real and legitimate.\n\n\n*\n\n*Answer from this question where you can find even more examples\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 | Unity Freezes After Escaping Full-Screen Video Since clean installing Ubuntu 15.10, Ubuntu occasionally freezes when I press ESC while watching full-screen videos and has frozen once when I was editing a video in Openshot recently.

I just installed Ubuntu 14.04.3, chosen because right now is the Ubuntu version that will be supported for longest time, and I'd like to install the latest version of Gmsh (version 2.10.1, July 30 2015). I could download a tgz file (from here) but I've read that that kind of installation is not for Linux novice like me. Other ways, like PPA and deb installation files are for older versions of Gmsh or for newer version of Ubuntu (tried that but the installation unsurprisingly fails). Should I upgrade to last non-LTS version of Ubuntu or there is a (feasible for novices) way to install Gmsh 2.10.1 in Ubuntu 14.04.3?\nThis question is specific about Gmsh/Ubuntu 14.04.3, but my curiosity is more general; is it possible (and how much hard is) to install latest version of a software outside of Ubuntu Software Center and without PPA and deb installation files? (I don't pretend to install a new software on a 10 years old Ubuntu, but at least on the latest LTS version)\n\nA: The link which you have attached of Gmsh 2.10.1 is a pre-compiled version. It is very simple to use it. Below are the steps.

I did not have the issue in the past (or at least very rare), but since a few weeks, the issue become very annoying.\nI'm using Ubuntu 15.10 over sony vaio laptop.\n\nA: I may not be a expert, BUT I did have this issue once upon a time and quickly solved it with these solutions. Problem could be hardware or software related, which cause then lags- unresponsiveness.\n\n\n*\n\n*Look at your touch pad, is it greasy, dirty? It could be merely a dirty touchpad, which in turn the pad doesn't register movement from your fingers\nSolution: Give it a good old scrub! (This applies to mouses, clean your mouse and surface underneath). \n\n*Could it be too much strain on your laptop? \nSolution: Try closing down application, windows, EVERYTHING in your desktop environment. Free sum spaceeee, give your cpu, memory, gpu some room to breath.\n\n*Could be a overworked and tired laptop? \nStep 1: COMPLETELY shutdown that machine of yours, dont charge it, leave it AlONE.\nStep 2: Put your laptop in a cool environment (not your fridge).\nStep 3: Leave it for more than 4-6 hours.\nStep 4: Go outside and kick a ball or somthing\nStep 5: Wait for it to cool down\n\n*Could it be that your laptop has a completely full hard drive? Spring clean that hard drive. Clean it up, make room, your pc will thank you for that.\nSolution: Your laptop has room to write more imformation into that hard drive, whichh in turn happy laptop :).\n\n*This is last resort, But I see you posted your using Ubuntu version 15.10, since this isn't LTS (Long Term Support) could be buggy? I suggest that you perform a fresh install of Linux Ubuntu 15.10 OR roll back over to Ubuntu 14.04 (More Stable Version). Oh also doing a fresh install is the ultimate solution for software wise.\n\n*Could be a virus? Viruses can have a huge performance slowdown\nSolution: Identify virus and eliminate problem OR performing a full system wipe and fresh install of operating system- ONLY FOR DIRE SITUATIONS!!!!!!\nSo these are some of my methods of solving these problems im sure there are hundreds more solutions out on the interwebs my main recommendation is rolling back to Ubuntu 14.04 which means a full reinstall of the operating system, this method solved my problem with the trackpad.\nHow do you like them apples?

I have some music collection and I want to sort/filter them easily according to their cut-off frequency (real bitrate, usually in kHz. I used to use Spek for showing me this information, but Spek doesn't provide any possibility to use it in terminal or for multiple files operations. I've already found some ways, but all of them just list bit-rate in which audio file is saved in kbps, not the actual cut-off frequency in kHz, which I need. I want to find a simple solution to filter the whole collection using e.g bash, python, existing simple tool, etc. Do you know any solution?\nClarification: I'm not looking for bitrate or sampling rate, I'm looking for frequency cut-off!\n\nA: I've been looking for something similar, since I'm trying to de-dupe a large music archive, would like to keep the highest quality files, but don't trust the bitrates used.\nI've found fakeflac which seems like a good start. Don't let the name fool you, it's not FLAC-specific since it converts the given file to wav and operates on that using a Python script. It scans down the frequency spectrum until it finds the cutoff, based on a couple of heuristics (125% increase in magnitude across a 220 Hz range, with the lower magnitude no higher than 110% of that at 44100Hz).\nIt writes out a \"score\", which is how far up the frequency spectrum the cutoff appears (i.e. if the claimed frequency is 44100Hz but it cuts off at 22050Hz, the score will be 50).\nI had to fiddle with it a little to make it work, e.g. I replaced sndfile-convert foo bar with ffmpeg -i foo bar, but it's very straightforward and seems to be just what I'm after.\nYou can use fakeflac in a loop to get the scores for a collection of files, then sort them using standard shell tools (sort, cut, etc.).\n\nA: Not the most elegant of the solutions, has a few drawbacks, but here's what I got:\nfind . -type f -name \"*.wav\"  -printf \"***%p\\n\"  -exec file {} \\; | awk '/\\*\\*\\*/{printf $0\"|\"};{gsub(/\\,/,\"\");for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) if($i~/Hz/) printf \" \"$(i-1)\"|\"$i\"\\n\" }' | sort --field-separator=\"|\" --numeric -k 2\n\nBasically, we use find command to search for files with \".wav\" extension, inside /my/audio/folder. We print path to each file, padding it with three wildcard signs, and execute file command on each one of them. The stdout output goes through pipe to the lengthy awk code, which reads each line; if the line has three asterisks - that's filename, print it; if a filed in a line contains Hz in it, we print number before that field, and the field itself. Everything is printed in such manner so as to have output in format ***/path/to/file | number | (k)Hz. Finally, the output is piped to sort command, which sorts numerically based on column 2 (the number).\nThe big limitation is that it works OK with same type of files, but if you mix mp3 and wav, then you notice that mp3 files list their frequency as 44.1 kHz and that breaks the sort.\nSample output that I have , for example:\n***./test.wav| 8000|Hz\n***./odeath.wav| 44100|Hz\n***./Front_Center.wav| 48000|Hz\n\n", "Q: Counter-Strike: Source not launching I am running 64-bit Lubuntu 15.10.

I've been trying to install linux on my system for a while now, and I'm at a loss for what to do.\nTrying to dual boot windows 10.   Have a raid controller with mirrored hard drives.\n\nWhen currently installing 14.04.3 from a usb drive.  the installer sucessfully lets me set up partitions(automatically and manually).  However when I get to the screen to select which area I live in I get a message box with \"???  ???\"(with space inbetween) for it's title and \"???  ???\"(with space inbetween), with the continue button greyed out, after a while the installer fails back to the screen that chooses partitions.\nPrevious problems that I've had was it not recognizing drives as there.  There was a point where I got to the desk top by using Parted to format the drive to ext2 and installing ubuntu on it(However after reseting couldn't find a way to actually get onto linux with menu/boot loader).\nI then decided to try the 15.10 version\n\nwith the 15.10 installer.  It successfully uses the nvidea card, second monitor(until I get to selection menus), and sound.  But the installer fails to install Grub2(successfully getting through all menus till the copy/installation bar starts to tick down).\nTried booting from both a USB, and a CD(random thing that worked for others).  \nTried booting from the live USB to use disk repair have have the logs(after going through installation, and grup2 installation failing):  Before disk repair changes: http://paste.ubuntu.com/13054208/   boot repair logs after following instructions:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/13054825/  (could post terminal output from Disk Repair that I have saved but don't have the reputation for more than 2 links).\nSo from what I can tell from the logs is that I have an usual raid setup(with the motherboard's raid controller on a GA-z9zx-gaming7).  I have the bio options for anything that could be set to UEFI set to legacy only, for fast boot it's a non-selectable option + disabled, and on windows 10 I also have it's software fast boot disabled.\n\nAlso tried to install Debian, but it would only see my USB flash drive as a disk.  Not recognizing the others.\n\nJust now I tried easy BCD.   Successfully get to the grub2 command prompt.\nWhen looking around with find I find 3 Hard drives(HD0,0), (HD1,0), (HD0,1).  With LS the first one doesn't have a kernel, the next two have \"inconsistent file systems\", and just LS it looks like I'm somewhere inside windows.\n\nRight now I've fried windows a few times(having to reinstall), have tossed embarrassing amounts of time at it, don't have enough experience to tell if what I'm finding on-line is relevant, and I'm pretty much just poking around blindly + bashing things up to see what works. \n\nA: Installing both Windows and Linux on one RAID set is probably the hardest installation method you can try with many pitfalls, negligible performance improvement on HDDs compared to SSDs and questionable reliability in some cases.\nThere are at least 3 kinds of RAID:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software RAID, the previously preferred way to RAID on Linux. You can find a simple RAID setup that doesn't consider UEFI or dual booting here.\n\n\n*\n\n*RAID capabilities provided by the filesystem like in btrfs and zfs.\n\n\n*\"Fake RAID\" on motherboards, the option you chose.\n\n*Actual RAID cards with cache batteries.\n\n\nWrite performance with RAID1/mirrored on 2 drives is limited to the slowest individual drive. Read performance depends on the implementation of the RAID level, but typically won't outperform current performance SSDs in actual work loads. Reliability also depends on the implementation (Can an individual drive be read from a different \"RAID\" controller, SATA port or USB enclosure?), but since you are using two very similar drives that you probably bought at the same time from one supplier, you already have a risk that both drives may fail at the same time. Administering RAID including evaluation of risk and performance is sadly a bit more difficult.\nIn addition to that, you use 3 TB drives and want to dual boot Windows 10 on modern hardware. The best advice is to avoid legacy booting, which is traditionally limited to 2.2 TB drives. EasyBCD is not recommended on UEFI installations here and Boot-Repair also has some problems on simple UEFI setups.\nIf Windows is kind of happy with this RAID setup and you don't mind the risks, complexity and performance outcome than do it, but for your Linux installation you should consider less complexity and good backup strategies and disaster recovery, one RAID1 set is only one copy of an important file, but you should have at least 3.\nN.B.: You're lucky if the latest graphics card is already detected in the latest release.\n\nA: Windows boots from /dev/mapper/isw_dchccafcdj_WINDOWS, and you created a separate sub-array, /dev/mapper/isw_dchccafcdj_linux to install linux to.  Presumably your bios is set to boot the windows array, so grub needs installed to the WINDOWS device.\nWhatever you do, never touch /dev/sda or /dev/sdb directly.  They must only be accessed through the fake raid device.\n", "Q: JDBC Driver Not in CLASSPATH eroor I have try to running apirior alogorithm in IdeaJ IDE.

The easiest way to solve this would be through GParted, a disk partitioning program.\nYou'll have to install it first and you do that by opening a terminal (you can find that in the app launcher, top left corner) and executing the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nWhen you run the first command it will ask you for your password, just type your login password (It will not show any feedback while you're typing, not even * characters).\nAfter it has finished installing make sure that your USB stick is plugged in and run GParted from the terminal by running this command\nsudo gparted\n\nYou will see something like this (Your partitions will wary, dont worry about that):\n\nPick your USB from the top righ dropdown menu, if you have only one HDD it will most likely be the second option, just look for a disk at around 8GB in size, now it should look like this (again, ignore the variations in sizes and names):\n\nselect a partition from the list and right click>delete (or just press the delete key on the keyboard). Repeat this with every partition until you have only Unallocated space listed. Select it and right click>New. A windows similar to this will pop up:\n\nOn the right side under File system select fat32, the default should be ext4, so be sure to change that, otherwise any windows system wont be able to read the usb. Leave everything else as is and hit Add. At last but not least hit the apply button on the tool bar on the top (It's the button on the right), hit accept and wait for it to finish (DO NOT REMOVE THE USB UNTIL IT'S DONE, you could damage it).\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: Ubuntu network indicator problem I am using ubuntu 14.04. at first I use a dsl connection created from network indicator-> edit Connection.

But VLC ain't playing any of them. It's not showing any error or any other message, it simply stops as soon as I play them.\nI have installed Ubuntu restricted extras package and I can play those files in Rhythmbox and Videos, so I know it's neither files nor codecs to do anything with it.\nSimilarly, I have a webm video which is not playing with VLC. It shows error stating VP90 format not supported. Though same file runs absolutely fine through Videos application. However, I may play various other webm videos in VLC. \nI always read that VLC plays all formats, even if one does not have suitable codecs installed. So, what's going on and how can I fix it? \n\nA: You should specify which version of Ubuntu you are using (Desktop [LXDE, XFCE, KDE, Mate, Unity], which processor type [32-bit, ia64, 64-bit and so on] and which edition you are using [12.04, 14.04, 16.04 or other]) to enable the answers you are presented to be more accurately directed at your needs.\nIf you have ubuntu restricted extras installed you should also have ffmpeg [and here is where the edition of Ubuntu is important because gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg does not exist for 16.04] installed as well as libavcodec54 libav-tools, ffmpeg, gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg, libavcodec-extra-53, libavcodec-extra-54 and/or others to ensure you have full coverage for (nearly) all audio and video file types you should follow and install the list of codecs and apps presented by Arch Linux (I am only linking to Arch Linux because I have not been able to discover a Ubuntu page which covers as much and Arch Linux covers things exceptionally well on the following page) - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/codecs\nBut, if you are only concerned with AAC and have already installed Ubuntu-Restricted-Extras (as you stated you had) then I strongly suggest installing Clementine which does play AAC so long as the codec is installed (and for you it is because you made clear that you have already installed Ubuntu restricted extras).  So, sudo apt-get install clementine and you will be able to play AAC files using that application.\nApart from installing clementine if you must use VLC then you need to install a few more packages. sudo apt-get install libavcodec-extra libavcodec-ffmpeg-extra56 libavcodec-ffmpeg56 libavutil-ffmpeg54\nOnce installed, open VLC and in the settings make the following changes:\nOpen VLC.  Click \"Tools\" then click \"Preferences\"  In preferences select \"All\" in Show Settings at the bottom of the window. Find \"Input / Codecs\" then \"Video Codecs\".  Now click \"FFmpeg\" and scroll down (on the right) until you see \"Strict Standard Compliance\" and change it to -2, then \"Specify AAC Audio Profile\" to use hev2 (just type it in after removing what was there).  Save it and your VLC will play AAC files.\nAs for webm files I do not have as much nor am able to find one so I cannot provide a useful answer (except to say that VideoLaAN, the company which makes VLC states that webm files are covered after VLC version 1.1.0, but that was released years ago). I will continue to look for a webm file and try to provide you a manner to enable as much in your VLC.\n\nA: I had a similar problem where I installed VLC using the Ubuntu Software app. I had previously used it on Ubuntu 18 and played .webm videos without any problem but this happened when I installed Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo just today. I just uninstalled it through the Ubuntu Software and reinstalled it through the command line, fortunately,\nit solved the problem. Now I can play .webm video files without any problem:\n$ sudo apt-get install vlc\n\n", "Q: how to active my wifi?

I have set the default terminal emulator to terminator using update-alternatives and I can open terminator now with ctrl-alt-t, but when I use the right click menu on the desktop or in a folder it will open gnome-terminal. \nIs there another setting to change to fix this? \nI've edited compiz to try the 3d cube effect and from then had to reset compiz to default settings to revert which reset my terminal default. To get ctrl-alt-t working after this I also had to do gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec 'terminator'. I found this suggestion in \nHow can I set default terminal used in Unity?, but this did not make it so the right click option open terminator.\nI am using Ubuntu 15.10\n\nA: A solution that might work is to add a custom right-click option to the Ubuntu context menu entry instead of changing the pre-existing one.\nFor that purpose you can use the Nautilus-Actions Configuration Tool that you can get from the repository using sudo apt-get install nautilus-actions.\nA quite well detailed tutorial can be found here.\n\nA: Add this to your ~/.bashrc file\nif ps -o cmd= -p $(ps -o ppid= -p $$) | grep -q gnome; then\n  nohup terminator &> /dev/null &\n  sleep 0.1s\n  exit\nfi\n\n\nA: If you don't want to use gnome-terminal on a regular basis, and you don't mind the possibility of having your hack disturbed by package upgrades, and other occasional problems, you could try removing /usr/bin/gnome-terminal (or renaming it) and replacing it with a symlink to terminator.\nA slightly less intrusive approach, that would work if the context menu respects PATH, would be to leave /usr/bin/gnome-terminal alone, but add a symlink from /usr/local/bin/gnome-terminal to /usr/bin/terminator, so that anything running gnome-terminal without a fully-qualified path actually gets terminator.\n\nA: The settings in gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec doesn't affect the behavior of the context menu entry. The used terminal is gnome-terminal and that's hard coded in libterminal-nautilus.so in the package gnome-terminal. And this library is used by Nautilus.\nPerhaps this will be changed in future versions, but currently it is a fact.\n", "Q: How to copy an entire command line to my clipboard, without the mouse? Imagine that I have this line in my terminal:\nyoutube-dl --get-thumbnail --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\n\nAfter testing it, I would like to copy this line above to my clipboard and paste it in some script file. Not the output of the command. \nBut, doing this without using the mouse. I like to keep my hands at the keyboard only. I think is faster that way, to do some coding :)\n\nA: You can use xclip:\nsome_command | xclip -selection c\n\nSo in you case:\nyoutube-dl .... | xclip -selection c\n\nc stands for clipboard.\nYou might need to install xclip first:\nsudo apt-get install xclip\n\nEDIT:\nIf you just want the command you have typed (not the output) to be copied to the clipboard, you can use Here strings:\n xclip -selection c <<<\"$(echo foobar)\"\n\nOr a pipe:\necho foobar | xclip -selection c\n\n\nA: I just made a little script for zsh that uses xclip to do this:\n#!/bin/zsh\nexport HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history\nfc -R\nfc -l | tail -n 2 | sed -n '1p' | sed 's/[0-9]*  //' | xclip -selection c\n\nThis script copies the last command that was entered in the shell/terminal to the system's clipboard.  It wouldn't work on a typical remote server.\nI thought it would take me just a couple minutes to write this script, but it took surprisingly long to get it working as I stumbled over the way zsh handles history.\nThe tail -n 2 and first sed in this are dealing with the fact that the command for this script itself is being recorded in the history and so it gets two lines of history and removes the last one.\nThis script works, and it was sort of a fun puzzle, but I'm really curious if there's a simpler or more elegant way of doing this with zsh.\n\nA: My answer offers a simple command in three different syntaxes, which all work equally, but one is a bit shorter and easier to type than the second. The third variation is a so-called alias, that means you can assign the command a custom name and call it by executing that without having to remember the complex stuff.\nPreparation:\nFirst, install the package xsel which allows you to access the X clipboard from the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install xsel\n\n\nCommand variation 1 (short):\nAfter that, you can type the following line to copy the previous command to the clipboard:\nxsel -ib <<<!!:q\n\nIf you want to copy the second latest command, replace !! with !-2, for the third latest use !-3 and so on.\nTo explain what you're running, here a short break down of the command:\n\n\n*\n\n*xsel is a command-line tool to access the X clipboards.\nFor more info, read it's manpage online  or by running man xsel.\n\n\n*\n\n*The -i parameter tells xsel to read from the stdin (usually this means keyboard input, but we're going to redirect something here)\n\n*The -b parameter specifies to use the clipboard instead of X's \"primary\" or \"secondary\" selections.\n\n\n*<<< is a special Bash syntax called \"Here String\".\nIt basically expands (not evaluates!) the argument (only one!) after it and redirects it as string to the stdin (standard input) of the command before/after which it stands.\n\n*!!:q is called a \"bang command\" for history expansion in bash. It replaces itself with any previously typed command line.\nFor more info, read it's local manpage by running man history (online manpage is not helpful).\n\n\n*\n\n*The !! stands for the previous command line and is a synonym for !-1.\nObviously !-2 means then the second last command line. Don't forget the minus sign -, otherwise it will return the 2nd (3rd/...) command you have ever typed.\n\n*The :q modifies the bang command and tells bash to enclose the substitution in single quotes (') to prevent further expansion by the shell. \n\n\n\n\nCommand variation 2 (slightly longer):\necho !!:q | xsel -ib\n\n\n\n*\n\n*echo has the simple job of printing all its arguments to the terminal's stdout.\n\n*!!:q is called a \"bang command\" for history expansion in bash. It replaces itself with any previously typed command line. \n\n\n*\n\n*The !! stands for the previous command line and is a synonym for !-1. Obviously !-2 means then the second last command line. Don't forget the minus sign -, otherwise it will return the 2nd (3rd/...) command you have ever typed.\n\n*The :q modifies the bang command and tells bash to enclose the substitution in single quotes (') to prevent further expansion by the shell. \n\n\n*| is a pipe. It redirects the terminal output (\"stdout\") of the command before it to the terminal input (\"stdin\") of the command after it.\n\n*xsel is a command-line tool to access the X clipboards.\nFor more info, read it's manpage online  or by running man xsel.\n\n\n*\n\n*The -i parameter tells xsel to read from the stdin (usually this means keyboard input, but we're going to redirect something here)\n\n*The -b parameter specifies to use the clipboard instead of X's \"primary\" or \"secondary\" selections.\n\n\n\n\nCommand variation 3 (alias):\nA bash alias is a cool thing if you don't want to remember long or complicated commands you often use. You can assign this command to a simple alias name, which you can run instead of the long command to achieve the same.\nUnfortunately, as bang commands are a special Bash feature and get expanded before aliases are resolved, you can't simply alias one of the variations above because the !! part will not work. There's a workaround though.\nTo set the alias, run the following line in your terminal. Note that you may chose any valid Bash variable name instead of copylastcommand:\nalias copylastcommand='history -p \\!\\! | xsel -ib'\n\nThis is however only persistent for your current Bash session, which means the alias will vanish after you close the terminal window. You can make it persistent in every of your Bash sessions by adding this line above to the end of your ~/.bashrc file, or to your ~/.bash_aliases file if you have one.\nAgain, a short break down of the line:\n\n\n*\n\n*alias name='command' is the syntax to set an alias in Bash. The command will be run whenever you execute name from now on.\n\n*history -p \\!\\! outputs the previously executed command line to stdout (standard output). Without the -p switch, it would not only print but also run the command again.\nNote that we need to escape the bangs (!) with backslashes (\\), because otherwise bash would expand them when we try to set the alias, which makes no sense as they need to be in the alias as they are.\nAgain, you can also specify the [n]-th recent command by replacing the second bang with -n, e.g. \\!-2.\n\n*| is a pipe. It redirects the standard output (\"stdout\") of the command before it to the terminal standard (\"stdin\") of the command after it.\n\n*xsel is a command-line tool to access the X clipboards.\nFor more info, read it's manpage online  or by running man xsel.\n\n\n*\n\n*The -i parameter tells xsel to read from the stdin (usually this means keyboard input, but we're going to redirect something here)\n\n*The -b parameter specifies to use the clipboard instead of X's \"primary\" or \"secondary\" selections.\n\n\n\nA: I am using as a clipboard manager, so. \nalias pbpaste='xclip -i -selection clipboard -o'\nalias pbcopy='xclip -selection clipboard'\nvimscratch='vim -c 'setlocal buftype=nofile bufhidden=wipe nobuflisted noswapfile' \n\nLast command to clipboard\nalias last2cb='fc -ln -1 | pbcopy'\n\nClipboard to vim scratch\nalias vcb='pbpaste | vimscratch -'\n\nZSH specific\n# Copy the most recent command to the clipboard\nfunction _pbcopy_last_command(){\n    fc -ln -1 | pbcopy\n}\nzle -N pbcopy-last-command _pbcopy_last_command\nbindkey '^x^y' pbcopy-last-command\n# Ctrl-x Ctrl-y  to copy last command to the clipboard\n\n\n# Edit content of clipboard on vim (scratch buffer)\nfunction _edit_clipboard(){\n    pbpaste | vim -c 'setlocal buftype=nofile bufhidden=wipe nobuflisted noswapfile' -\n}\nzle -N edit-clipboard _edit_clipboard\nbindkey '^x^v' edit-clipboard\n# Ctrl-x Ctrl-v to edit clipboard on vim\n\n\n# define function that retrieves and runs last command\nfunction run-again {\n    # get previous history item\n    zle up-history\n    # confirm command\n    zle accept-line\n}\n# define run-again widget from function of the same name\nzle -N run-again\nbindkey '\\er' run-again\n# alt-r to run last command again\n\nI think these ideas can help you to create your own solution\n", "Q: I can't see the Update program on Lubuntu 15.10 I've recently installed Lubuntu 15.10 on my laptop and I dont see the Update program and I don't know how can I find it.\nMy PC is Toshiba NB300 with 1gb RAM and Lubuntu 15.10 x32 in the Spanish version.\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nA: It's normally in the menu under System Tools.

Is it so that ecryptfs is expected to behave?\nI thought that the two passfrases were a double protection in case someone crack my login password, to protect my most private data.\nSo, what the mount passphrase is useful for and when someone (who) is required to use it?\n\nA: I got exactly the same problem as you did, I was very confused by the whole process, and the signification of all those passphrases.\nAfter digging, I found the website that @A.B. referred and it helped.\nI would add a few things though :\nThe login passphrase is also called the wrapping passphrase. This last name makes more sense to me because it's the passphrase that wraps and unwraps the mount passphrase. It is called sometimes the login passphrase because by default, ecryptfs wants to use your user login password as wrapping passphrase.\nIMHO, I find really unpractical and dangerous to have the wrapping passphrase be your login password, because if an intruder finds your login password, then there is no point in having an encrypted directory, because he can decrypt it with the same password.\nSeeing what you said, I can only imagine that you have the same opinion :\n\nI thought that the two passfrases were a double protection in case someone crack my login password, to protect my most private data.\n\nAll of that brings us to my final point: There is a simple way( yet not so obvious to someone new to the problem) to choose a wrapping passphrase different from your user login password. When creating your private directory, use the option -w, --wrapping (see man page for more info):\necryptfs-setup-private -w\nIt probably also works on an already existing folder, but I think you also have to use -f to force the update.\n\nA: These are not my words but I can not explain it better …\n\nlogin passphrase\nThis is the password you will have to enter each time you want to mount the encrypted directory. If you want auto-mounting on login to\n  work, it has to be the same password you use to login to your user\n  account. \nmount passphrase\nThis is used to derive the actual file encryption master key. Thus, you should not enter a custom one unless you know what you are\n  doing - instead press Enter to let it auto-generate a secure random\n  one. It will be encrypted using the login passphrase and stored in\n  this encrypted form in ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase. Later it will\n  automatically be decrypted (\"unwrapped\") again in RAM when needed, so\n  you never have to enter it manually. Make sure this file does not get\n  lost, otherwise you can never access your encrypted folder again! You\n  may want to run ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase to see the mount passphrase\n  in unencrypted form, write it down on a piece of paper, and keep it in\n  a safe (or similar), so you can use it to recover your encrypted data\n  in case the wrapped-passphrase file is accidentally lost/corrupted or\n  in case you forget the login passphrase.\n\nSource\n", "Q: unable to open hard drive i install ubuntu few hour before, but i am unable to access hard drive. the message shown is given below-\nError mounting /dev/sda6 at /media/jeetu/24386BED386BBD04: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda6\" \"/media/jeetu/24386BED386BBD04\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda6': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.

Since Mozilla decided for coercing people to hand-in their Firefox-Browser extensions for signing by Mozilla, else they would not run in newer (41+) versions of the browser, it seems to me the firefox to be found in the standard Ubuntu repository would make most of my own, not signed, extensions useless when updating to a newer version of firefox (via the apt-get update && apt-get upgrade).\nOf course the thinkers of Mozilla decided a plain setting in about:config would not do, to get rid of this limitation (to develop and use those extensions). Instead they tell to get a developer, or unbranded, or nighly version of the browser.\nMy question regarding to this is:\nIs there such a version of the Mozilla Firefox Browser in the Ubuntu repos?. That is, is there one alternative version of Firefox in the Ubuntue repo that is the very same as stable, but simply has still the ability to run unsigned browser extensions?\nPS: To avoid any comments on the line: \"Just go ahead and hand them your extensions for signing, its not so bad\". I do expressively not like their freedom limiting policy, and consequently rather go all the way to build each new release of theirs from the sources and patch out that stuff, then ever cooperating with Mozilla.\nPSS: Since I must have missed that in that. The way to having a Firefox without the extension signing, I would not like to switch to be foreced into having two version. In effect that is what the \"go fu*** yourself and install a Developer Edition\" approach of Mozilla ends up being. \nThere has been the try iceweasel approach. Is iceweasel not having this \"you cannot have free extensions\" limitation that Mozilla put in the Firefox?\n\nA: Firefox Developer Edition still has the override switch in about:config. You can install it manually, or from a PPA: How do I install the Firefox Developer Edition?\n", "Q: Unable to safely remove usb external hard drive I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and connecting USB Flash Drives and External USB Hard Drives regular basis, I'm able to Eject my USB Flash Drive but I can't Eject or Safely Remove the External USB Hard Disks, It's seems Ubuntu provide only Unmount feature for External USB Hard Disks. external hard drives are spinning devices so Unmount won't sufficient to physically remove it. \nUbuntu provide Eject feature for USB Flash Drives\n\nBut Ubuntu does not provide Eject or Safely Remove feature for External USB Hard Drive\n\nIs it a Bug in Ubuntu 14.04 or i'm missing something?\n\nA: You just have to Unmount the disk.\n\nA: Use umount with Force option. if your device is /dev/sdb1, use:\nsudo umount -f /dev/sdb1\n\n\nA: This probably means you still have something accessing the disk.

I am trying to install 15.10 from a usb drive to the windows 7 partition on the laptop so I can do away with the hard drive. I made the boot usb with the 15.10 iso and booted it, but when I go to erase and encrypt the disk it aborts and restarts. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Boot into the windows 7 partition and start setup from within windows then choose the \"alongside windows\" option \n\nA: Well, it's difficult to say what you are doing wrong if you don't show any of your actual commands and none of the results (i.e. error messages). I assume that you don't want to keep the Windows 7 partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB method\nTo boot from USB used to be a challenge to say the least. More recent PC's are generally capable of USB boot. But if the Laptop is slightly older, that might be an issue. I'd try to avoid it if possible. Second problem: encryption. If it boots ok and the problems start with the encryption, then don't select encryption. It is easier to reinstall with encryption later if you have already \"excercised\" the \"normal\" install. It is also simpler to add an encrypted home partition later if you need one. \n\n*Why don't you try a simple format and copy method, since you seem to have a working Ubuntu 14.04 (although an external drive)? This is a bit a \"risky\" operation, but if you already have some experience with ubuntu/linux it may be a good alternative. (I've done it this way a couple of times) If you anyway don't want to keep the Windows partition, then your not risking anything (except some spare time).\nYou need to do most of these commands as root. If you don't understand the commands well enough, I'd suggest that you read up on them first.\n\n\n*\n\n*start the Laptop from the external drive\n\n*partition the internal drive. (replace sda with your actual drive. I'm assuming sda0 here)\n    fdisk /dev/sda\n\nIf you prefer this with a graphical interface you can use gparted. If it's not installed you can install it with sudo apt-get install gparted. I suggest you create one \"normal\" partition as ext4 and a swap partition. Mark the \"normal\" partition as \"bootable\".\n\n*create a filesystem on your \"normal\" partition\n    mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda0\n\n\n*mount the newly created partition (here to /mnt/new)\n    mkdir /mnt/new\n    mount -t ext4 -o rw /dev/sda0 /mnt/new\n\n\n*copy the complete externa harddrive (here assumed to be /) to the internal drive recursively (so all files and subdirectories are copied)\n    cp -R / /mnt/new\n\nDepending on the size of the external harddrive, this may take some time. The directories dev proc and sys are not required, and can be deleted afterwards.\n\n*install grub on the internal drive\n    grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/new/boot /dev/sda\n\n\n*edit the file /mnt/new/etc/fstab\nThis file needs to contain the correct configuration of your actual drives. Since you copied it from the external drive, it still contains the paths to the external drive.

Has the syntax changed, or are there new requirements? Previously, it had been enough for me to set the command as ~/myscript.sh, but this no longer works. \nMy script has executable permissions, and running it from the command line is no problem.

None of these have any response, and all of them work fine when pasted directly into the terminal.

Thank you!\n\nA: After loads of experimentation with steps suggested in the comments, among other things, I figured out that I can run shell scripts fine, and I can even run the desired script fine, it is just one particular line of the script that was failing.\nThe most important part of my shell script is actually the invocation of a python script. The python script needs access to modules outside of my normal PATH. For this reason, in my .bashrc I add the appropriate paths to my PYTHONPATH. However, it seems like commands that are run from keyboard shortcuts in this way ignore the contents of my .bashrc. I am curious where/how these commands are executed under the hood, but I will post another question for this.\nThe solution was to add necessary paths to my PYTHONPATH in the shell script itself with the following line, so they are accessible to the python script:\n export PYTHONPATH=\"/path/to/crucial/python/library\"\n\n", "Q: What does wq_busy=1 indicate in a failure to suspend?

(elapsed 0.001 seconds) done.\n[…] Freezing remaining freezable tasks ... \n[…] Freezing of tasks failed after 20.008 seconds (0 tasks refusing to freeze, wq_busy=1):\n\nThat seems to blame wq_busy for being true, but I'm not having luck finding out why that might be the case or how I might fix it.  (Internet searches seems to always pull up the more popular case where a task refuses to freeze.)  What does wq_busy=1 indicate?\n\nA: wq_busy is apparently the kernel's variable name for the busy\nflag on a workqueue.  Why it was stuck at true for some workqueue\non my machine is unclear, because the problem went away while I\nwas trying to diagnose it.  In case it's useful for someone in\nthe future, I had done the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repeatedly until all applications were closed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close an application.\n\n*Attempt, unsuccessfully, to suspend.\n\n\n*Disable networking.\n\n*Attempt, unsuccessfully, to suspend.\n\n*Reboot (intending to get a clean process list; I was going to progressively disable things in hopes that a non-critical process was the culprit).\n\n*Attempt, unexpectedly successfully, to suspend.\n\n*Re-enable networking.\n\n*Attempt, again successfully, to suspend.\n\n\nSo, strictly based on observations, and not with any understanding of\nthe problem, I would guess that the following is a workaround or fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable networking.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Re-enable networking.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue. wq_busy was 1. I suspected that it had started to happen after 18.10 upgrade.\nI did some research and found a post about looking for hardware-specific solutions especially for laptops, and another post about cdemu.\nhttps://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-952364-start-0.html\nIn my case, removing gcdemu, cdemu-client, cdemu-daemon, and then autoremove vhba-dkms and libmirage11 made my hibernation working again.\n\nA: I enabled hibernation some month ago in my Ubuntu system, now 20.04, but now as in the past I had some issue.\nSo in this last event I found this in \"dmsg\" during hibernation procedure:\n\n Freezing of tasks failed after 20.005 seconds (0 tasks refusing to freeze, wq_busy=1)...\n\nI solved with increasing the freezing timeout from 20 sec to 30 sec:\n\necho 30000 > /sys/power/pm_freeze_timeout\n\nand made I it permanent with sysfsutils and after writing\n\npower/pm_freeze_timeout = 30000\n\nin a file in the /etc/sysfs.d directory\n", "Q: allowing user to run systemctl/systemd services without password I want the default user, ubuntu to be able to run a specific service without being prompted for a password.\nSpecifically systemctl restart unicorn_my_app.service.\nHave followed the instructions here to add user ubuntu to a newly created group, LimitedAdmins, which is confirmed with:\n$ getent group LimitedAdmins\nLimitedAdmins:x:1001:ubuntu\n\nCreated a new file, limitedadmins (using sudo vim) in the /etc/sudoers.d directory containing the following text:\n%LimitedAdmins ALL=NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/unicorn_ofn_america restart, /etc/init.d/unicorn_ofn_america start\nI have also tried:\n%LimitedAdmins ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl/unicorn_ofn_america restart, /bin/systemctl/unicorn_ofn_america start\n(And /bin/systemd)\nContent of /etc/sudoers/ is the default as confirmed with sudo visudo (or sudo cat /etc/sudoers):\n#\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\nDefaults    env_reset\nDefaults    mail_badpass\nDefaults    secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\n(The hash sign in #includedir is not a comment, but part of the #include directive syntax).\nHowever there's still a password prompt following running systemctl restart unicorn_my_app.service\nService is there in the init.d directory:\n$ ls -l /etc/init.d | grep unicorn\n-rwxr--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1874 Oct 29 06:47 unicorn_my_app\n\nTried chmodding 755 on the app, but don't think that should make a difference, since ubuntu owns it anyway.\nEven tried rebooting the system with no difference. Am I missing a step, like a restart/reload)? Configuring something wrong?\nI should also mention that I used vim to create the new file within /etc/sudoers.d, as it seems that the visudo command is only for editing /etc/sudoers.\nUPDATE\nLooks like you can edit additional sudo config files with visudo. See below.\n\nA: The sudoers file is fairly flexible, and with that comes complexity. What you want here is to permit access to the command /bin/systemctl, with specific parameters:\n%LimitedAdmins ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart unicorn_my_app.service\nBasically you just take the exact command line that you would type, hard-code the path name for safety's sake, and put that into your sudoers file (or /etc/sudoers.d). And note that 'start' and 'restart' are completely different as far as sudo is concerned; permitting one won't grant access to the other.\n\nA: I too thought visudo only worked on /etc/sudoers but happily, I was mistaken.\nvisudo can be used to modify existing files in /etc/sudoers.d or create new ones.  The -f parameter allows this.  If the command is invoked like this:\nvisudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/permissions_for_subset_of_users\nyou can use visudo's validation capabilities to allow safe editing of sudoers.\nAlso, if you are using some kind of CI/CD or configuration management, you can use visudo -cf <name_of_file> to run a validation of the configuration.  (our lead sysadmin provided that second piece of knowledge).\nReference: https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.13/visudo.man.html\n", "Q: Turn off email capabilities on server I have a web server running Ubuntu and I know that I have Postfix installed and configured on it, but I want to uninstall it and I also want to make sure sendmail is not going to be installed by itself. \nWhen I try to use apt-get remove postfix, it tells me that postfix is going to be removed but it also tells me that it will install sendmail.\nMy problem is that most of the websites running on this server are using Wordpress and I never have time to update them and they always get infected with small php scripts that are trying to send spam.\nSo I just want to TURN OFF/DISABLE all mailing capabilities of the server, because none of the websites contains contact forms or any other things that would use mailing system.\nAny toughts?

Although I don't remember checking the box when I did the install, it appears that LVM is activated. I think this is preventing me adding a drive in the normal way. \nAlthough several years ago I understood enough about LVM to use it properly, I don't want to use it now, because I'm concerned about the diffence in performance of the SSD vs the HDD - I don't really want to merge them into one storage pool. I shall just have to reinstall the system, and get it right this time !:(. \n\nA: Is it possible that mount looks at /etc/fstab and sees 2 mount points for the same device? Are you using the UUID for the HDD when entering the parameters with the Disk utility? Looking at the data put out by your \"cat /etc/fstab\" there is a mount with a UUID that mounts to /boot (also seems to show ext2 filesystem). If, with the disk utility, you are using the device callout (ex: /dev/sda1) to define mount parameters but there is already a mount definition for this drive in the file using UUID and mounting to /boot then you have 2 mount points for the same drive. Your options are to 1) change the mount point in the UUID callout or 2) comment out the UUID callout BEFORE running the disk utility to set up the drive.

I'm asking this because my HDD (Hard Disk) has 5 years, and ultimately (this year) it gave me many headaches. Many moths ago I has Windows 7 (and 10 T.P. since april) and all was good. But after a moment, instantly, all gets reversed: veeery slow, and actions which will take a tiny time, at these moment the time seems frozen (for example, instead a 1 minute boot, it turned to 5-8 minutes boot). I formatted and installed Windows every 2 months because it was the time which runs good before it gets slooww. Seeing the abuse of privacity in W10, I changed to Ubuntu 15.04 and the things lasted more in time... But again, HDD error.\nClick, trying to read, click, trying to read... And the upper bar (title of window/buttons of volume, language, wifi, etc.) disappeared.

I had to press CTRL+D to boot-up Ubuntu, but after hours... the same error (can't do anything except moving the mouse/cursor).\nWelcome to the routine: copy files with live-cd to a pendrive, wipe HDD and install all again.\nAnd the things was calmed again... and the errors comes again.\nAnd after 2 weeks, I had to do the same. Now my PC works fine, but yesterday I heard a few \"clicks\" from the HDD.\nNow, I remembered this  and I came to Disks and the HDD shows a new value; normally, the problematic number was \"pending sectors\", always changing, but now, in \"irrecoverable sectors\", the number is different of zero.\nI never had \"reallocated sectors\".

Your HDD is dying. As sectors on the drive start to fail, the drive automatically starts to remap sectors to minimize data loss. These are the reallocated sectors.\nPending sectors are waiting to be remapped. If the sector has a successful read or write attempt while pending, it will not be remapped, and removed from pending. It will only be remapped on a write failure.\nUncorrectable sectors are sectors in the hard drive that cannot be read or written to, indicating a failing hard drive.\nThe clicks you hear can be caused by many things, but it all comes down to the internals being worn out.\n", "Q: Use native Unity menus in Audacity When using Audacity in Ubuntu, you'll find that the menu bar is placed inside the window, and not in the usual location.

The reason we need to run both, is because the Alt menu (menubar search) doesn't seem to work unless Audacity is launched without arguments.\n\n\nNote: If you don't use the Alt menu, you can replace the last 5 lines with: audacity_orig \"$file\"\nNote: You can alternatively leave out the export UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=1 line from the above script, and change the Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 audacity %F line in /usr/share/applications/audacity.desktop instead (change 0 to 1, or remove the env UBUNTU_MENU_PROXY=0 part).\n\n*Finally, link the bash script to Audacity's original location and make it executable:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo ln /usr/bin/audacity_mod /usr/bin/audacity\n\n*sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/audacity\nDone!\nYou can now enjoy Audacity with the native Unity menus:\n\nThe Alt menu works too:\n\nNote: You may need to log out and back in for the Alt menu to work again after changing the OS theme through Unity Tweak Tool.\n\nIf you wish to revert:\n\n\n*\n\n*A: Link the original program:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the link: sudo rm /usr/bin/audacity\n\n*Link the original file: sudo ln /usr/bin/audacity_orig /usr/bin/audacity\n\n*Make the link executable again: sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/audacity\n\n*Optionally, remove the script: sudo rm /usr/bin/audacity_mod, or\n\n\n*B: Put the original program back where it was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the link: sudo rm /usr/bin/audacity\n\n*Move (rename) the original file: sudo ln /usr/bin/audacity_orig /usr/bin/audacity\n\n*Optionally, remove the script: sudo rm /usr/bin/audacity_mod\n\nA: It looks like the shell script may not be necessary. According to this thread, that environment var was changed to work around some kind of bug on some systems, so they changed the .desktop entry for Audacity.\nIt works on my 16.04 system to make Audacity use global menus by just changing UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 to UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=1 in /usr/share/applications/audacity.desktop.\n", "Q: fsck from util-linux 2.26.2 how to fix it I have upgraded from 15.04 to 15.10.

I want to do the following:\nscp root@server.ip.adress:/root/file.txt ~/homecomputer/directory\n\nInstead of taking a file from the server though, I would like to send a file. How do I do this?\n\nA: The syntax is:\nscp source destination\n\nSo this time the source is your local (client) computer and the destination is the remote (server) computer.\nIf the file you want to send is ~/homecomputer/directory/foobar.txt, then from your local computer you can do:\nscp ~/homecomputer/directory/foobar.txt root@server.ip.adress:/where/to/put\n\nCheck man scp to get more idea on this.\n\nA: If you want to send a file FROM a server TO your local computer, then exactly what you suggested works, IF you run this from your LOCAL computer, NOT your REMOTE server:\nscp root@server.ip.adress:/root/file.txt ~/homecomputer/directory\nHere, root@server.ip.adress:/root/file.txt is your source and ~/homecomputer/directory your destination.\nNOTE: This answer assumes that you don't need some private key to SSH into your server.\n", "Q: swap partition limits my drive Why is the swap disk not just a file inside the main partition? Setting as a separate partition limits my ability to extend 1 partition for another OS.\n\nA: I find that I never use my swap partition.  If you have sufficient RAM on your machine, you might be able to do without it.  Go to a command window and type in\nfree -m\n\nYou should see on the last line a reference to 'Swap'.  If the used on this is zero, and stays that way consistently, shrink your swap partition down with gparted or remove it entirely.\nYou could, potentially, use a swap file, but I am uncertain how reliable the technique is for doing this given Linux's emphasis on using a partition for this instead of a file.  If it turns out that you need a swap file, google 'swap file linux' and instructions on how to set it up should be readily available for you.\n\nA: You can make swap file and replace swap partiton with them.\nCreate swap file with this command\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1048576\nsudo mkswap /swapfile\n\nThis will create swap of 1 GB. If you want bigger swap change count value.

Command:\nnohup ./_rel/web_server_example/bin/web_server_example console &\n\nthen you can exit your ssh session. The output of your process will be redirected to file nohup.out\n2) Use GNU screen. You will likely need to install it first: apt-get install screen. Then:\nscreen bash\n./_rel/web_server_example/bin/web_server_example console\n<Ctrl-A> D\n\nAt this stage you will have a screen session running in the background.

I could then move from the left screen to the right screen, by simply moving the cursor to the left.\n\nA: Script to connect screens \"circular\"\nThe script below will do as you describe; if the mouse touches the right edge of the right (-most) screen, the mouse re- appears on the left (-most) screen.

After installation I'm trying SSD optimization as given in link. I have added relatime to fstab on / but I can still see modified and access time getting update and this is not working per documentation. Please help me explaining or is this a bug ?\nSample\n\nA: First please check whether or not atime has actually been used as mount option.\nIn a terminal type:\nmount\n\nThis should show you all mounts, including all mount options, such as relatime\nThis could look something like this:\n/dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime)\n\nSo the mount options in this example root dir were 'rw' and 'relatime'\nIf this does not show relatime for your root dir then relatime was not used.\nCheck that relatime is set in your fstab\ncat /etc/fstab\n\nDid you reboot after you changed the setting.\nIf not, please reboot now.\nIf that does not help please try\nsudo mount -o remount,relatime /\n\nThis should manually set relatime.\nCheck again with:\nmount\n\nIf this helped, then probably your rootdir used the fstab from initrd to mount your rootdir, in stead of the fstab in your normal filesystem.\nLook on the internet or askubuntu to find out how to change fstab in initrd. (Warning, making mistakes in initrd can make your computer not boot)\nPlease also make sure you understand relatime.\nThe first time a file or directory is read after it has been written to, the time accessed time (atime) will be updated.\nOnly the second and later times it is read (after a write), the atime is not updated anymore.\nSo the way to test is:\nCreate a file or directory.\nRead the file or directory once.\nLook at the directory contents\natime should be upodated now\nWait some time\nRead the file or directoy again.\nLook at the directory contents again.\natime should not be updated now.\n\n", "Q: How to install a stand-alone program If I create the following program in C:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(){\n    printf(\"Hello World\");\n}\n\nAnd then compile it like so:\ngcc helloworld.c -o helloworld\nIs there any easy way to install helloworld on to my computer?\n\nA: \nIs there any easy way to install helloworld on to my computer?\n\nThe next actions you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*make the file executable with chmod 775 helloworld from the directory where the file is.\n\n*copy it over to a directory in your PATH. I would suggest sudo cp helloworld /usr/local/bin/ (local since it is your local system and bin since it is a binairy). \n\n\nAnd then you can do\nhelloworld\n\nfrom any location on the system to have it print \"Hello world\".\n\nA: sudo install helloworld /usr/local/bin installs it to /usr/local/bin (read man install).Btw, your helloworld.c should really be:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void){\n    printf(\"Hello World\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nA: Without root permission the best thing for you to do is create a bin directory within your home directory and then add it to your PATH environment variable. So after creating a directory called bin in /home/$USER open ~/.bashrc in your favourite editor, for example gedit ~/.bashrc. You then need to add:\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/bin\n\nWhat this is doing is appending ~/bin to the $PATH variable. Which is a list of directories to search for executables. \nIf you've got a terminal currently open, you need to reload the configuration what you can do by using the source command: source ~/.bashrc.\nFinally you just need to copy the executable into that directory then you'll be able to run it as you would a normal command. \nAs pointed out by @Serg in the comments the ~/bin directory is included in the PATH set in ~/.profile. So alternatively you can simply edit ~/.profile and remove the comment from the PATH variable. Simply find the line:\n# PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n\nThen change it to the following and reload the terminal:\nPATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu update failing on my brand new BQ aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition Phone My phone came preinstalled with 14.10 and I'm trying to update it to the latest version and it's downloading up to 99%. \nThen, after a while, I'm getting installation failed.

I have the problematic Broadcom BCM4352 card, I already installed the newest drivers, disabled the ideapad and done some other stuff I found on the internet, but still after some time of being connected to the network pings return Unreachable and I need to reconnect to network. I also heard that it may cause problem with freezes on Ubuntu, is it true?\n\nA: I know this post is a few months old. I'm sure somebody will find it of use.\nGo to: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2262459&page=5\nAs long as you have at least Ubuntu kernel 3.19 then proceed to step 2 of post #44. I did it and it worked like a champ.\nThere is a bug (that I have noticed hasn't manifested itself lately... maybe it's fixed by now?) where Ubuntu will sometimes freeze when you hover your mouse over the wifi icon near your clock. \n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to open Ubuntu file manager? Is there a keyboard shortcut to open the Ubuntu file manager?\nIf there isn't one by default, how can I set such a shortcut?\n\nA: It is under System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Launchers, and by default on  my system it is set to Explorer key (whatever that means), but personally i've set it to Super + E , since this is the same as Window's shortcut, which is what I used to use a lot year and half ago when I still was a Windows user. Just click on the area where the description for key is, it will say new accelerator and press keys you want to set\n\nAnd if you want to create a shortcut to open some directory other than home, go to Custom shortcuts, and set a new shortcut for nautilus /path/to/dir command. For instance, nautilus /usr/share/applications\n\nA: Naming it as Explorer/explorer didn't work for me.\nOn Xubuntu (which used the thunar file manager):\nUnder Settings -> Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts\nClick Add -> set Command: thunar -> set shortcut to whatever you'd like (coming from Windows, I used Super+E)\nAlternatively you can check which command opens the file manager in Terminal, and put it as the Command value while making/editing a keybinding from the Settings.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is not shortcut, you can however create a custom one using the following procedure:\nopen settings, then navigate to devices then keyboard, here, you will see a lot of shortcuts,now scroll to the bottom until you find the '+' sign, click it,under name, type the name of your shortcut e.g 'Open navigator', under command, type 'nautilus' and then click set shortcut, a pop up appears, now set the combination that you deem fit e.g Super + E and add it and you will be good to go.\nI am using Ubuntu 18.04 but I hope that this solution will work for most versions of Ubuntu/Linux\n", "Q: How to recover files from a given directory using photorec I want to recover some files using PhotoRec. Although I've used it before, I am not familiar with making it look only in one given directory.\nAny idea how to do it?\n\nA: It is not possible to scan directories for lost files using PhotoRec unless you had mounted a whole hard drive partition as this directory.\nFor Unix a directory entry is not much more than a file used for mapping inodes. This also is why PhotoRec can not recover the directory structure. It really is only to scan whole drives or partitions to then recover the content of files of a given type (as defined by known headers). Filenames and directory structures can not be recovered.\nYou may however use TestDisk from the same suite to search for directory entries, and then to recover files within these (see my answer there on how to do that). To use TestDisk we need remnants of the filesystem to be accessible still.\n", "Q: i installed ubuntu 15.04 in legacy boot mode. want to dual boot laptop in uefi mode I installed Ubuntu 15.04 (32 bit OS) on my 64 bit compatible laptop in legacy boot mode and I cannot find my graphics drivers.\nmy question are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I use dual boot (windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04) my laptop in UEFI boot mode. after removing my current OS in legacy mode\n\n*I cannot find the reason behind my drivers problem i. e. whether it is due to legacy mode or it is due to installation of 32 bit OS on a 64 bit compatible machine.\n\n\nA: Booting a 32-bit OS in EFI mode on a system with a 64-bit EFI is difficult, but not impossible. Since it's a fresh installation, though, and since it's a hassle to do the cross-bit-depth booting, I recommend you re-install using a 64-bit Ubuntu.\nTo reduce the odds of making the same mistake, go into your firmware and disable the BIOS/CSM/legacy support. This support is normally disabled by default, but a lot of sites provide the misguided advice to enable it as a matter of course when installing Linux. The result is problems like yours. If your boot medium is prepared correctly, it should boot fine in EFI mode and you should be able to re-install with few or no problems. (Note that some tools omit EFI boot loaders when preparing USB flash drives. Rufus tends to do a decent job, provided you pick the option to prepare an EFI-bootable disk.)\nAs to your video problem, that's probably (but not certainly) unrelated to your EFI-boot problem. I recommend you try a 64-bit EFI-mode installation and, if you continue to have problems, search for questions on this topic. Video problems are not uncommon, and chances are your problem has been encountered before and overcome. Knowing the video chipset may be critical for finding a solution, so if you need to post another question, be sure to include that detail.\nOne final point: non-LTS releases are supported for just nine months. The 15.04 release you're trying, in particular, will reach end-of-life (EOL) in January of 2016. Thus, I recommend you try either the latest 15.10, which will reach EOL in July of 2016; or 14.04 LTS, which will reach EOL in 2019. If your video hardware is brand-new, 15.10 may be a better bet, since it's got a more up-to-date kernel and X server; but of course the extended support period for 14.04 is generally desirable.\n", "Q: how solve update error 15.04 am trying to update my stem and am getting this error problem\nroot@jay:/home/jay# apt-get update\n\nE: Type 'eb' is not known on line 1 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list\n\nE: The list of sources could not be read.\n\nany idea on how i can solve this?????\n\nA: My guess would be that your file has been manually edited, or wrongly copy-pasted, and the keyword deb which should be at the beginning of the line is missing its first letter.\nTry editing the file and replacing eb with deb, on the first word of the first line.\n\nA: Only a wrong entry in your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list.

Now, cd into one of them, source the file, and the alias becomes available:\n$ cd dir1 && source .alias\n$ eg\nThis is dir1\n$ cd ../dir2 && source .alias\n$ eg\nThis is dir2\n\nIf you want this done automatically, add this line to your ~/.bashrc:\n## Check if an '.alias' file exists and, if it does, source it. \nPROMPT_COMMAND='[ -e .alias ] && source .alias'\n\nThe PROMPT_COMMAND variable defines a command that is executed before each prompt is shown, so after any command you run. This means that as soon as you more into a directory that contains an .alias file, this file will be sourced. \nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*This is insecure. Any code within the .alias file will be executed. Use at your own risk. The manual approach is much safer. \n\n*Any aliases defined in the .alias file will still be available after you leave the directory, until they are overwritten by another alias definition with the same name. If that is a problem, you can clear all aliases and then re-load your global ones with:\nunalias -a && . /etc/bash.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bash_aliases\n\nTo simplify it, make it a function by adding these lines to your ~/.bashrc:\nclear_aliases(){ \n    unalias -a && . /etc/bash.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bash_aliases; \n}\n\nYou will then be able to run clear_aliases to reset your defaults. \n", "Q: How to reach the page setup dialog box on post 5.0.2 releases? LibreOffice does not allow page setup, ie the paper size and orientation cannot be set. This problem occurs in all of the LibreOffice programs: Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math and Base.\nI've tried this both with the 5.0.2 release available in the software archives, and the 5.0.3-rc2 candidate from the launchpad/libreoffice ppa.\nDoes anyone have a work-around or patch for this?\n\nA: In LibreOffice Writer, you can format the page using \"Format\" menu, select \"Page...\" and the options are in there.\nI am using Ubutntu Studio 15.10 with L.O. 5.0.2.2.\n\nA: Open the menu entry Format > Page in Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math or Base.  \nSelect the tab Page.  \nHere you will find everything that makes you happy for the rest of the day ... ! ;)\n", "Q: Can I convert hex to decimal using the calculator app? How can we convert a hexadecimal value into  decimal by using  calculator (I know by using general formula we can do ,but is there any short key or button to do this)?\n(I tried but didn't found any option )\n\nA: When I need to convert to hex from command line, I do this:\nprintf  \"%x\\n\" 255\n\nand when I need to convert from hex, it get simpler:\necho $((0xff))\n\n\nA: Well, I don't do it often but, when I do, I just use Galculator. Why do I use Galculator? It is fast, light, and feature rich. It does everything I need it to do, these days.\nIf you're looking to convert then simply enter the information and then click on the appropriate button (DEC HEX OCT BIN) and it converts it for you all nice and easy like. Most of all, it's pretty small and easy to work with - I like small and simple and I also like a GUI for some things. \nIf you want to install it then sudo apt-get install galculator and follow the prompts.\n\nA: You can use Ubuntu's default calculator in programming mode. \nOpen the dash and search for Calculator, then select : Mode > Programming Mode.\n\nEnter the value to convert, then press equal =.\nThe entered value will get bolded. Then you may select the target Base from the drop-box to have the value converted. \n\nA: And if you want something you can do from the command line, you can use trusty old bc\necho \"obase=16; 255\" | bc\n\nproduces FF\n\nA: \ndc(1)\n\nDesktop Calculator, absolutely:\n> dc <<< '16i FF p'\n255\n\n\n\n*\n\n*16i is for input base16\n\n*p for print\nPS Other useful conversions:\n> dc <<< '16o 255 p'   # decimal2hex\nFF\n> dc <<< '2o 16i EF p' # hex2binary\n11101111\n> dc <<< '2o 7 p'      # decimal2binary\n111\n\n@see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/howto/calculate-dc\n", "Q: Why is my DHCP Server not running I set up my /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server and set eth0 in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf\nWhy is the isc-dhcp Server not running?

Let's blacklist the module:\nsudo -i\necho \"blacklist acer-wmi\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nexit\n\nYou should be all set.\n", "Q: Can ecryptfs login and mount passphrases be changed? Consulting the Internet documentation and the UNIX manpages of ecryptfs, I found a bit confusing the random use of login and mount passphrases, wrapping and wrapped passphrases.\nFor instance, from man ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase:\n   ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase is a utility to  unwrap  an  eCryptfs  mount\n   passphrase  from  file,  using  a  specified  wrapping  passphrase, and\n   display the decrypted result on standard out.\n\nRunning the command from terminal, the user is prompted with 'passphrase', that I discovered is supposed to be the login passphrase, in order to recover the mount passphrase.\nSo I guess that login and wrapping passphrases should refer to the same passphrase as well as mount and wrapped passphrases.\nMy question is: how, if possible, can I change login and mount passphrases?\necryptfs-setup-private ran with no options (as I did) is supposed to create a new Private encrypted folder with following passphrases:\n\n\n*\n\n*the login passphrase must match the Ubuntu user login password, so that by default when the user log in Ubuntu automatically the private folder is mounted\n\n*the mount passphrase is randomly created, unless the user type a custom passphrase\n\n\nI decided to Log in Ubuntu with the folder remaining encrypted so I deleted file ~/.ecryptfs/auto-mount.\nNow I would like to know if ecryptfs login passphrase can be changed and set different from my Ubuntu user login password.\nIs ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase what I need?\nI also would like to know if I can change ecryptfs mount passphrase, because I chose a custom passphrase when it should be safer a random 16 bytes passphrase. I could not find any help on this.\nIs running again ecryptfs-setup-private with options -f and -w a solution? \n\nA: I don't think there's a way to change the mount passphrase, without erasing and starting over. The ecryptfs-setup-private\n   -f, --force\n          Force overwriting of an existing setup\n\nMight work, but it should leave any currently encrypted files in the ~/.Private folder left with the old mount passphrase. \nI'd suggest decrypting/mounting the ~/Private fodler, backing up all the files, for example with tar & gpg to keep them encrypted\ntar -z -cv datadir | gpg -v -z 0 --output data.tar.gz.gpg -c\n\nAnd then start over with ecryptfs-setup-private using  your chosen (or random) mount & wrapping passphrases.\n\nThe wrapping passphrase should be the same as your user login passphrase, so you can login and decrypt your files at the same time. Changing the login passphrase normally (while you're logged in is good) will normally change the wrapping passphrase also (through PAM I believe).\nHowever, if root changes your login passphrase, it should not change the wrapping passphrase - this is by design to prevent any root user or anyone else from reading your encrypted files without the proper passphrase. In that case, the new login passphrase won't match the wrapping passphrase, and you would have to run ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase as you mentioned, which requires your old login passphrase. Or run ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase if you know the mount passphrase.\nTherefore, if you forget your login passphrase, and have no backup copy of the mount passphrase, your encrypted files are effectively locked forever.\n", "Q: Issues adding Ubuntu 14.04 to Windows Server 2012 AD domain I am trying to join an Ubuntu 14.04 host to a windows active directory (Windows Server 2012) - using native tools \nI've used this as a guide. I've tried a few variations in configs, e.g. toggling dns_lookup_realm and dns_lookup_kdc on and off. I initially had some issues with resolveconf but I uninstalled it and after updating network setting I could resolve srv settings for _ldap and _krb records as expected. I am able to kinit and get a ticket issued, and had a successful net ads join. wbinfo run with -u, -g and returns gids for -r someuser, but -i someuser returns:\nfailed to call wbcGetpwnam: WBC_ERR_DOMAIN_NOT_FOUND\nCould not get info for user someuser\n\nI am unable to authenticate as users either, e.g. if ssh'ing or via console login - user not found in passwd. This is my nsswitch.conf:\npasswd:         compat winbind\ngroup:          compat winbind\nshadow:         compat winbind\n\ngetent group only returns local groups after a long delay (as if it's contacting the PDC, but not getting any response). getent group \"domain admins\" and domain_admins don't return anything.\nSo I think I am pretty close to getting a domain logon on the host, but not sure what is wrong. Anything obvious wrong in my setup?

What you need is the  Dell Recovery application from Ubuntu Software Center. This, once installed, will associate the houston-15_A10.fish.tar.gz with itself and not archive manager. \nNot sure how this association is made as it reverts back to archive manager unexpectedly which can cause confusion. \nIf the above fails you can always install the .deb files manually via: \nHow do I install a .deb file via the command line?\n", "Q: How to perform a \"Select all\" via keyboard, in recent versions of Gnome Terminal? In (X)Ubuntu 14.04, I was able to perform a Select All operation via keyboard, in Gnome Terminal, invoking the menu (Alt-E -> A).\nWith more recent versions of (X)Ubuntu, I've noticed that the shortcuts for the menu bar are not available anymore.\nFor some operations, it's possible to set a direct shortcut (eg. Reset and clear terminal), but not for Select All.\nIs there a way I can perform this operation via keyboard?\nNote: I refer strictly to Gnome Terminal, not other terminal applications.\n\nA: It seems like that option has been voluntarily removed.\nThe closest I can get to get something similar is enabling \"Enable mnemonics (such as Alt+F to open the File menu)\" in Edit > Preferences:\n\nAnd use ALT+E,↓,↓,ENTER to select all.\n\nA: Enable e.g. Shift + Ctrl + A as the shortcut key for Select All in Preferences → Shortcuts.\n", "Q: Changing boot order ubuntu I am facing problems in dual-boot ubuntu and windows 10.

Rather than showing Grub, it skips straight into Windows. However, there was an easy solution for me: use Boot-Repair to fix Grub. The easiest way to use Boot-Repair is to boot into a live session of Ubuntu from a bootable CD or USB, and then install Boot-Repair and then run it. Reference here for how to do that. Changing the boot order probably won't work because Grub is not even being launched, which is the issue.\n", "Q: Virtualbox failed to install after upgrade to 15.10 samip@samip510:~$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox\n[sudo] password for samip: \nReading package lists...

After that we should be able to re-install the newer version from the repositories:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nThe latest releases with bugfixes can also be installed by adding the official Oracle repository to our sources. I recommend to do so.\n\nA: I had faced the similar issue. In my case I was trying to install i386(32 bit) version of virtual box in Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit system. Then i downloaded AMD64 (64 bit) version and it worked fine. So make sure you are using appropriate version of virtual box.\n", "Q: I am unable to read while loop in shell script So i wrote this program to reverse the arguments..but the problem was while and expr command was not read by shell script..

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Ubuntu Touch is currently not available for the Moto G using the ubntu-device-flash method, as it isn't officially supported by Ubuntu yet. I recommend taking a look at the currently supported devices to see what might be available.\nIf you really want to install Ubuntu Touch, there is an experimental version here, but I recommend against using it, as the installation procedure is complicated and it might not even work once installed. Most of the features will probably be buggy, ruining the experience. If the installation goes wrong, which is highly likely, you could end up with a bricked device.\nIf you really want Ubuntu Touch, do it. Otherwise, stay away.\n\nA: --device=mako. mako is the Nexus 4. You are trying to flash an N4 image to a Moto G. That isn't going to work. There is no official Ubuntu Touch support for the Moto G, but a developer did create an unofficial port on XDA developers.

They are marked enabled but still no response.\nAfter restarting the device, everything is fine as long as I don't transform it to a tablet.\nI am working with Gnome Shell 3.16.4.\nAny idea what the issue could be?\n\nA: I have a brand new R13 and am having the same problem. I'm not sure what is turning the touchpad and keyboard off. I suspect it is the laptop itself, and linux doesn't know it is happening.\nI have a partial fix that may help you. I wish I had a full solution.\nThe following script will restore your keyboard and possibly your touchpad. If the touchpad is not restored, then Fn+t will turn it back on:\n#!/bin/sh\n[ \"root\" != \"$USER\" ] && exec sudo $0 \"$@\"\nlsmod |grep hid|cut -f1 -d\" \"|xargs -n1 rmmod\nudevadm trigger\nsleep 1\nxinput|grep SYN1B|cut -f2 -d\"=\"|cut -f1|xargs -n1 xinput --enable\n\nThere is a wrinkle though. It may need to ask for your password to run as root. In my case, I have a onscreen keyboard (like onboard, or cellwriter) so that I can enter the my password. An external keyboard works too.\nStrangely, I have found that after running the above script once, my laptop is no longer disabling the screen and touchpad. I don't have time to see if it's a one-off thing, or happens every time.\nI have limited time to play, though, so this partial answer is what I have for now. Here's hoping it helps someone come up with a complete solution.\nLater edit as requested: The script removes all kernel device drivers that had HID (Human Interface Device) in the name, which includes the touchpad drivers, digitizer pen, keyboard, etc., and then tells udev to trigger the installation of any missing device drivers, which reinstalls them. This hopefully resets the drivers for those devices (and gets the keyboard back). Then we wait a second, get a list of X input devices and specifically enable the one that corresponds to the touchpad. This gets the touchpad back unless it's disabled by the laptop itself, in which case Fn+t on the (now working) keyboard gets it back.\nLine by line:\n1: Use /bin/sh shell to run script\n2: If we aren't root, sudo and rerun the script\n3: List all modules, remove modules with \"hid\" in the name\n4: Insert modules for any devices for which drivers are not present\n5: Wait 1 second\n6: List X input devices, find one with SYN1B in the name, enable it.\n\nIt's a brute force solution, but it's a start. I'll do a better job narrowing down the problem later, when I'm not moving to another continent. :)\n", "Q: google search engine problem When I search something on google, the tab freezes there are no result.

There's already a copy of Windows 8.1 on it.\nThe problem: After installing, I can't boot into Ubuntu at all, from nowhere. Here are the details which went down:\nWin8.1 is on a 400GB partition of a 1TB HDD, the other ~600GB is free space. I made a bootable USB out of the Ubuntu MATE .iso, fat32. In Legacy mode, NOT UEFI I've booted it up, went right into the installation of Ubuntu. There I've made partitions according to this: How to use manual partitioning during installation?\nIn the end I've ended up with 11 partitions or so, at least the last /dev/sda was /sda11. The Ubuntu MATE installation went on sda7.\nI've done everything as it is written in the article, but when rebooting after installation the computer booted up in Win8.1. Alright, I had this problem once with Kali Linux, there I've downloaded rEFInd, made a live USB from it and it seamlessly worked fine from there (I could only use it with the pendrive at my hand - but that makes Kali even more interesting doesn't it? :P) So I thought at first this would be the solution here as well. So when it booted into rEFInd it couldn't detect Ubuntu MATE, only Win8.1. So I've googled this problem.\nFirst I went into the Live USB to select \"Try Ubuntu MATE\" and download boot-repair there successfully. However, before boot-repair could just fix the problem it exited with the error \"boot-repair needs an EFI environment so it can't do shit right now\". Then I tried to install grub2 again on sda7, it said it was successfull at the end but the result didn't show this.\nSecond I changed Legacy bootmode to UEFI. It still got me straight into windows after boot, so I tried the Ubuntu Live USB I've used at the installation. It couldn't boot because of Security concerns. Headed to the next helping article, it suggested me to turn off secure boot. Well this wasn't easy on an Acer laptop (it is different than on a regular PC or laptop...) but ultimately I could turn it off. So now I've tried again the Live USB.\nNot a huge success. Now the error is \"System doesn't have any Bootable USB device\". Then I tried this from going to \"Update and recovery\" in win8.1 and selecting the Bootable USB option but it was the same error.\nAnyways, I've found at most places that the problem is that Windows is installed in uefi mode while linux is installed in legacy bios mode. But the solutions I've found online I couldn't apply because they both rely on either successfully booting up the Live USB or changing the boot mode to CSM which is also not an option for me.\nSo here I am 4 hours after putting all the necessary Ubuntu MATE files on my hdd and I can't use it as of yet. I hope someone could help me, I'd be really grateful. My Google search statistics are like 9000 searches/hour so you can imagine I did try out every method, every solution there was available. Being desperate here so please don't judge me. I've never posted anything on help forums because I could solve anything by googleing it until today...\nSORRY FOR THE LONG READ\n\nA: \nI made a bootable USB out of the Ubuntu MATE .iso, fat32. In Legacy mode, NOT UEFI\n\nThis was your first (and only really major) mistake. Rule Number One in modern dual-booting is to install all your OSes in the same boot mode (BIOS/CSM/legacy or EFI/UEFI). Mixing boot modes is possible, but requires extra hoop-jumping and knowledge of how the pieces all fit together.\nA lot of guides recommend enabling the BIOS/CSM/legacy support as a routine part of installing Linux. This is a Bad Idea. For details on why, see my Web page on the subject. Enabling this support can indeed clear certain initial hurdles, but at the cost of creating bigger ones down the road. It's better to figure out what's causing the initial hurdle. These days, it's usually an improperly-prepared USB disk image, or sometimes Secure Boot problems.\n\nSo when it booted into rEFInd it couldn't detect Ubuntu MATE, only Win8.1.\n\nrEFInd should have detected an installed Ubuntu. The fact that it didn't makes me think that something may be more seriously wrong with your installation, but I can't be sure of that. I recommend you boot to an Ubuntu live disk and run Boot Info Script. This will create a file called RESULTS.txt with details on your configuration. Post it to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here so that others can analyze it.\nActually, another thought occurs to me: What filesystem(s) did you use for Ubuntu? rEFInd supports ext2/3/4fs, ReiserFS, and Btrfs; but if you used JFS, XFS, or something more exotic rEFInd won't be able to find your kernel. You might be able to work around this problem by adding an EFI driver for your filesystem from the efifs drivers project. Also, if you used Btrfs, there are special additions to rEFInd's scanning options required in some cases. These are mentioned briefly on the rEFInd drivers page.\n\nI tried the Ubuntu Live USB I've used at the installation. It couldn't boot because of Security concerns.\n\nCould you please post the EXACT error message? (A digital photo may be helpful.) If you booted a stock rEFInd image, Secure Boot should not be an issue, since the standard rEFInd CD-R and USB flash drive images don't support it. OTOH, if you modified these with Shim or PreLoader, you could have gotten in. ALT Linux, and perhaps one or two others, also use rEFInd with Shim or PreLoader, so if you used one of them, you might have gotten into rEFInd with Secure Boot active.\nAlso, if you get into rEFInd, it might be able to launch the Ubuntu installer on another USB drive. (You might need to hit Esc in rEFInd to re-scan devices to get the USB devices to show up.)\n\nNow the error is \"System doesn't have any Bootable USB device\"\n\nThe exact context of this message could be important. Is this a message from the firmware, from GRUB, or something else? Again, a screen shot showing context may help.\nOne more point: Some utilities for creating bootable USB devices don't write EFI boot loaders. Unetbootin and Rufus generally do a good job at this. If yours lacks the EFI boot loader, you might see a message like this. (This problem is one of those that's easier to overcome than the problems of a mixed-mode installation.)\n\nA: Well, installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 8(and over) is very easy. You shouldn't have gone for the \"Something Else\" option as \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows\" was available and Ubuntu Mate 15.10 has many resolved issues. If you can, delete all those partitions you created, and restore the 600GB of space to Windows. When Windows has the 1TB back and there is no extra space for anything else but Windows, restart and boot the USB with Ubuntu installed. Choose \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8\". \nOn the next screen, select how much space you want to allocate Ubuntu then follow the prompts. \nMore info here.\n", "Q: hcitool scan output inconsistencies When running hcitool scan, I get inconsistent output.\nSometimes it finds all nearby, discoverable devices, sometimes it doesn't.

The problem was the cable between my computer and the Comcast modem, which is downstairs about 100' away, and next to my wife's computer.  My wife's Lenovo and my Acer download at 150 Mbps +/- when on a short cable connected directly from the modem (i.e., no intermediate plugs/sockets).  However, when my Acer is in the upstairs office, it is connected to the modem via cat5e that runs thru the walls, so there are 2 intermediate sets of wall sockets/plugs.  As a test, I got about 110' of new cat5e, installed the RJ45s at each end and strung the 110' down the halls and up the stairs.  With this cable between the modem and my Acer in the upstairs office, I now get 1Gbps speed.  Will now have to debug/upgrade the cabling in the walls.  Thanks for your input.\n", "Q: Windows doesn't see gparted partition done i have a pc with has dual boot of win10 and 14.04 at different ssds, recently i have seen that i spend much more time on ubuntu and made it my primary os, windows had 250gb ssd while ubuntu had 60gb, so i wanted to make a partition somewhere like 60gb for media storage and stuff and format it as ntsf, done it with gparted, however while ubuntu recognising one 180gb one 60gb storage windows sees it as 250gb storage as C://. I haven't touched bootflags and stuff but not 60gb has 14mb of smt inside there and i dunno what those are? can you help me out?? BTW windows still bootable.\n\nA: I have done it by tweaking a bit, forgot the disable the fastboot of windows 10 lastly, for those who wanna know it keeps the drives mounted in order to boot faster, and bamm, it's done. Tried both diskmgmt and gparted and works well. Finally i can experience true open source after quitting gaming :D\n", "Q: Convert animated gifs to sprite sheets I have a shell scripting request. I haven’t spent much time figuring it out myself yet, but I want to try and convert animated gifs into sprite sheets for use in SDL game development. I know how to break an animated gif into a series of images: convert animation.gif target.png, but not how to string them together end to end, in a single image file. \nIs there a shell command that can help me create a single sprite sheet out of multiple images? \n\nA: It seems you have ImageMagick binaries installed already, so you can use the following command:\n$ montage your_gif.gif -tile x1 -geometry +0+0 -alpha On -background \"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0)\" -quality 100 sprites.png\n\nThat should create a file named sprites.png, with the gif's frames.\n\nA: Here is a start on a solution I made:\nits has some bugs. I want to add a function to create whole directories into sprite sheets. \n#!/bin/bash\n#Convert animated gif to sprite sheet\n#pass in animated gif get out png sprite sheet\nconvert $1 $1.png\nconvert `ls *.png` +append $1.png.result\nrm *.png\nmv $1.png.result $1.png\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 won't install fro USB I'm a newbie to Linux and I'm trying to install Ubuntu 14.03.3 LTE on an old XP laptop that would otherwise be discarded. I thought I would erase the old hard drive and do a clean install, but first I wanted to see how it works. The laptop has 1.2 Gb RAM and a Hitachi driver. So far I've had no success.\nIt took hours to download the >1 Gb Ubuntu 32-bit fi;e with my slow ISP service and I wasn't sure if I had the whole thing as the clock showed it at ~50% and then suddenly was done. How big is that download file?\nSince my disk drive in the laptop no longer functions, I used a 32 Gb 3.0 thumb drive that I formatted on my Windows 8.1 Pro desktop with FAT32 and 8192 allocation size, then applied the UUI installer. This magically found my desktop.iso file and a recheck of the thumb drive showed 10 file folders and 7 other files:\nFiles showing on USB thumb drive\nBefore the changeover, I deleted a bunch of extraneous programs on the XP and ran Chkdsk on both the C and D drives. (That made it noticeably faster and smoother!) Then I shut down, inserted the thumb drive and started again. F-10 was the key to touch to access my boot options which were:  CD/DVD, FDD, IDE HDD. I select FDD and hit return, which progresses to a blank screen with a cursor at the upper right corner and proceeds no further. Task manager shows it's running, but there is no activity. When booted normally, the old laptop reads the 3.0 USB even though it's 2.0 and shows all the same files, and I get a Ubuntu Menu option screen if I click the wubi.exe file from here.\nWhat's happening here? Did I get a corrupt download? Is my thumb drive improperly formatted or loaded? Is there an incompatibility between the systems? Or something else.\n\nA: I believe you have a broken iso file due to your saying\nTry to download iso via torrent (trust me it's faster) and follow this guide\nreboot\ngo to your bios (usually f2 button) and set the order of boot while usb it pluged in, you should see the name of the usb\nubuntu grub2 will comeout and say install ubuntu and follow standart installation process\nalso i suggest you to install something like lubuntu instead of full unity  ui bc it might be slow with you kinda specs #nooffense\nan ssd might speed up things as well, those things are not expensive nowadays like they first comeout\n\nA: I again downloaded, both the Torrent and the desk versions this time. That really puzzles me because the Torrent is 25 kb and downloads in seconds while the desk file is ~750 mb and took over 2 hours. Are these the same thing or am I not understanding Torrent?\nAnyway, using the desk version of Lbuntu, I ran the MD5SUM check and it verified, so I created a USB file using  UUI. After double checking the BIOS in my old laptop for USB boot (FDD), I inserted the thumb drive and started the machine and got the same result. After half an hour I still have a blank screen, even though I saw the thumb drive blinking rapidly and steadily.\nI'd really like to try my hand with Linux, but this has become very frustrating.

[8086:24f3] (rev 3a),   Subsystem: Intel Corporation Device [8086:1130] is not yet covered by the driver iwlwifi. Several variations are covered, but not the exact pci.id and subsystem combination that you have. Let's try to add it.\nPlease download this file to your desktop: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/2015/09/23/backports-20150923.tar.gz Right-click it and select 'Extract Here.'  Drill down to drivers > net > wireless > iwlwifi > pcie. Open the file drv.c with any text editor, like gedit, nano or kate. Scroll down to line 428. Please notice that your pci.id ending in 24F3 hasn't a corresponding subsystem of 1130. 24F4 has an 1130, but not your 24F3. Let's just change it. Change line 428 from:\n{IWL_PCI_DEVICE(0x24F4, 0x1130, iwl8260_2ac_cfg)},\n\nTo read instead:\n{IWL_PCI_DEVICE(0x24F3, 0x1130, iwl8260_2ac_cfg)},\n\nSpacing, punctuation, brackets, etc. are crucial and must be perfect.

Any improvement?\nYou have compiled the driver for your currently installed kernel version only. When Update Manager installs a later linux-image, after the required reboot, please recompile:\ncd ~/Desktop/backports-20150923\nmake clean\nmake defconfig-iwlwifi\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nPlease retain the files and these instructions for that time.\n\nA: chili555's answer was certainly correct, but I haven't tested that. I'd just like to add that support is included in updated kernels for Ubuntu 15.10. When you're installing Ubuntu, wifi won't work to get you connected, but simply use a cable to get updates. Your wifi will work after a reboot. After updates, this worked out of the box on a Thinkpad P50.\nSo there's no need to download, edit and compile anything any more.\n\nA: To get this wireless adapter work in Ubuntu 15.10 you need to install firmware by running\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-firmware/linux-firmware_1.156_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-firmware_1.156_all.deb\n\nFor Ubuntu 14.04 you need also to upgrade the kernel by\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-wily\n\n\nA: Sometimes, depending on your laptop (mine yoga 900).\nThe module is compiled but network manager show it as disabled by hardware.\nThis is because the ideapad_laptop module thinks the laptop has a physical button to disable the wifi. \nIn that case, you can blacklist the module o recompile the kernel adding the equivalent section as described here. \n\nA: Make sure you have the file iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode under /lib/firmware\nYou can find it here.\ndownload and run:\nsudo cp <path-to-*.ucode file>/iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode /lib/firmware\n\nAnd now again:\ncd ~/Desktop/backports-20150923\nmake clean\nmake defconfig-iwlwifi\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nReboot:\nsudo reboot\nintelnuc skull\n\nA: I faced similar problem of unclaimed Intel wireless interface.\nI installed Ubuntu 16.04 on Lenovo ideapad 520S (which I recently bought). But the Wifi didn't work. The lshw -c network command displayed that the Intel wireless interface is unclaimed.\nIt seems Ubuntu 16.04 comes with v4.4 Kernel (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Support#A16.04.x_Ubuntu_Kernel_Support).\nAfter installing v4.13 Kernel, the problem has been solved.\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-4.13.0 linux-headers-4.13.0 linux-image-extra-4.13.0\n\n", "Q: Information on input-wacom-0.30.0 for Intuos Art compilaton I have Ubuntu 12.04 and an Intuos Art from Wacom.

Remember to reboot after the installation of the kernel driver (not strictly necessary every time, but safer).\nI do not know if your tablet is  supported; you can check here and in the mailing list (for example,  the message about the 0.30.0 release). \nWhat you are seeing can be a bug that is lurking around --- if this is the problem, a workaround that works most of the time is executing sudo modprobe wacom before connecting the tablet. \n", "Q: Atho 10 WiFi not working properly This January I bought a new MSI Stealth laptop and immediately installed Ubuntu on it only to realize that my Wifi card was at the time unsupported.\nI have the Atheros KillerWirless 1525 chip. I occasionaly would check every couple of weeks to see if it would work yet. Finally I found a way to install Ath10 and after many different setup attempts I got the Wifi to work as it normally should. Sadly I just upgraded to Ubuntu Wiley 15.10 and my Wifi runs incredibly slow. It still connects but takes several minutes to get to a Webpage. Sometimes I will even get the system error message and it says ath10 stopped working. Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? Thanks.\n\nA: Ubuntu Wily probably doesn't need that fix, so remove it.  If you haven't deleted the file, double click on it and choose remove to uninstall the dkms file in Ubuntu Software Center.\nOr sudo dpkg -r ath10k-dkms in terminal\nThen in terminal\nsudo apt-get install git\ngit clone https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware.git\ncd ath10k-firmware\nsudo cp -r ath10k /lib/firmware/\nReboot\n", "Q: Glitches in smplayer playing fullscreen When I play a video fullscreen in smplayer, I get graphical glitches in a horizontal line about a quarter of the screen from the top, particularly visible if I skip a few seconds, but also when there's a significant change.\nI have a fairly recent Nvidia gpu and an LCD monitor.

I experience a tearing while doing pretty much anything: it ranges from barely noticeable when watching a film with VLC to annoying when browsing or watching a video with Firefox, and it's god awful when using Chrome (which is currently the only way I have of using Netflix). Oddly enough, when I play this game it suffers from little tearing.\nThanks in advance for your help. I tried fixing this issue once and I only managed to mess up my former installation of Ubuntu.\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that this happens both with with the recommended nVidia driver and with the default open-source one; the latter seem to do a teeny tiny bit better, but I might be mistaken.\n\nA: So, I found a workaround... well, sort of: I opened nvidia-settings and enabled my integrated Intel card, and according to this test the tearing seems to be gone.

If someone has any better suggestion please let me know.\nEDIT: even with the integrated gpu chrome has some serious tearing. Everything else works alright.\n\nA: Could it be that you are using the XFCE (Xubuntu) or LXDE (Lubuntu) desktop environments?\nTheir compositors have common tearing problems with newer Nvidia video cards. If this is the case, try disabling the native compositor and install \"Compton\" or \"Compiz\" instead. This should solve the tearing.\nIf this is not the solution, try setting the \"PowerMizer\" option to Maximum Performance in the Nvidia settings and see if this changes anything, also make sure that VSync is enabled there.\n\nA: Duplicate\nTwo steps that solved the problem for me on my gtx 960 on Kubuntu 14.04\n1st try adding this to your xorg.conf file @ /etc/X11/\nSection \"Screen\"\nOption         \"metamodes\" \"nvidia-auto-select +0+0 {ForceFullComposition = On}\"\nIf that works only sometimes or distorts clarity on internet or game video then add this and it should make a big difference and hopefully permanent fix. \nSection \"Screen\"\nOption         \"TripleBuffer\" \"1\"\n\nYou can check out my research here-askubuntu.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 No Lenses I upgraded from Ubuntu 15.04 to 15.10 and Unity Application Lenses do not work. \n\nI have tried:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall unity-scope-home\nsudo unity --reset(no more supported).\nsudo unity --replace\nI have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling Unity, tried this and this.\nAny suggestions?\nIs it me, or is this a bug in Ubuntu 15.10?\n\nA: Well, this has something to do with the user.

The toolkit interfaces from the nvidia driver which is all the Nvidia stack and code base.  That is why people use CUDA because it gets them closer to the hardware to get performance increases. \n\nA: This is a shady idea overall.  You will be able to make your own .cu cuda files, compile them, and run them.  But if you try to link against libcudart to do basic CUDA api calls, it will fail.  (In other words, cpp files that include cuda libraries won't work). You have two difference driver sets in play, different versions.  One is libcudart and other cuda libs from apt-get.  Another version is from the run file.  \nOverall it should either be apt-get for all CUDA files, or build all cuda by hand.  Not mix the two.\nBut the instructions on running the .run file were very helpful.

So any UI bells and whistles are just taking up the screen real estate and I want to minimize them. I have already set the UI font size to 9. But I wonder if it's possible to minimize button borders and such. I'm also open to other flavors of Ubuntu if necessary.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You can scale back menus in Settings -> Display.  There is a slider that is set to 1.00 by default.  This slider controls the relative size of menus and UI elements.  This may greatly help your problem.\nAlso, you might want to consider replacing the LCD with a higher-res screen.  I'm pretty sure that is an upgradable option.\n\nA: Lubuntu allows you to choose more compact LXDE window decoration for smaller screens, or screens with lower resolution.\n\nA: XFCE, Gnome 2, MATE and others have settings to change the style of the window borders & buttons. If the settings aren't easily found, may need a 3rd party program to do some tweaks, maybe Ubuntu Tweak (but I've read it can make some potentially unsafe \"tweaks\", so caution is required.

I'm trying to install Ubunt 15.10 to boot via UEFI alongside Window 10. At https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI, I see:\n\nNote that in a UEFI-mode installation, Ubuntu will not ask you where to install the boot loader. If it does, or if it complains about the lack of a BIOS Boot Partition, you've probably accidentally booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\nNow, I'm pretty sure I've booted the installer image with UEFI (e.g. /sys/firmware/ef exists, and \"parted /dev/sda print\" shows \"Partition Table: gpt\"). But the graphical installer, when I choose \"Something Else\" and set up my partitions as desired, the installer shows me an option to select where to install a bootloader (and fails, later on trying to install grub there).\nIs there a known issue here?\n\nA: Because the developers didn't bother to hide the box in the ui if using UEFI.  Grub ignores the setting and always installs to the ESP anyhow.  Probably should file a papercut bug report, assuming there isn't one already... maybe someone will fix it.\n\nA: If you use the \"Something Else\" option, you must identify your ESP as such. If you don't, Ubiquity won't know where to install GRUB. The installer should correctly identify your ESP if one already exists, but if not, you'll have to create one yourself. Make it a FAT32 partition of 550MB and tell the installer it's an ESP.

I'm a newbie to the Linux world and I have gotten my Ubuntu  15.04 all set up last night.

Is it possible to replicate this? \n\nThanks! \nRemoved Newbie like me.\n\nA: Converting from rainmeter config to conky config, maybe if you went through it by hand yourself, but I am not aware of any automatic tool.\nConky can do free drive space, disk read/write speeds, cpu usage, free/total/used ram, sensor temps & fanspeeds, processses, network UL/DL speed & totals... just type them into your config file & test it out.\nIt's basically just take the default config file, and add/change stuff under the TEXT line. And the reload trick killall -SIGUSR1 conky is excellent. After you get the right settings above the TEXT line to use conky on your desktop, easy web search to find those.\nSee these pages for more info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Conky Documentation Pages\n\n\n*\n\n*Pretty table of Conky variables\n\n\n*Ubuntu help page on Conky\n\n*A web search for best conky configs - just copy some cool ones & edit away.

I tried using boot-repair but still does not work My laptop is a toshiba satellite C55.\nHere is the url for the boot-repair\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/13089017/\n\nA: If you want to keep only Ubuntu (and no Windows), then the best option is to do a clean install and during the install wipe (format) the entire hard disk..\nThat way you have a clean system and rest of the things will work fine\n\nA: This problem is quite tricky to solve from what I've seen. If you changed your display driver(from X.Org Nouveau) to NVIDIA you will need to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the X.Org Nouveau display driver (by purging the Nvidia binary drivers as described in other answers). The drawback is that it will impact the graphics performance which is better with an official Nvidia driver.\n\n*Install the Nvidia driver and boot with the 'nomodeset' flag. To do this, configure Grub as described in the answer to this question. \n\n\nSource\nOtherwise, it could be a BIOS setting, as suggested here.\nThen again, a clean install of Ubuntu is supposed to work.\n", "Q: can't find my windows partition files in ubuntu i have recently started using ubuntu and i dont know where to find the files from my earlier installed windows in ubuntu i had huge datas in previous partitons in D and E drive\n\nA: If they are on a partition? Sometimes you have to specifically mount it before you can access the files.\nIf that's the case, go to disks, select the partition you have your data on and then hit the little play button to mount it. from there you should be able to access things on the partition from the normal file system.\n", "Q: How to I get GCC compiler to work? So I am new to programming C. I am using Vim as my editor and GCC as my compiler, but its not working quite right. Lets say I am making a basic program to determine if a number is odd or even.

I am running Linux, which I dual boot with Windows. \nNow I press CTRL-D to stop the process, and only then does it print me back my number, and tell if it is odd or even. It isn't just this one, a lot of other programs with similar formats seem to do this to.\n~ $ ./test\nEnter a number: 45\n45                         //I press enter, nothing happends. Ctrl-d \nYour number is even.       //ctrl-d again\n~ $ \n\n\nA: Ah, what the heck. I'll take a stab at answering it anyhow.\nShort answer: remove the \\n from the argument to scanf. When I do this, your code behaves as expected (well, to be persnickety, I also had to change argv[] into *argv[].)\nLonger answer: you shouldn't really ever use scanf; it usually gets you into trouble.\nHmm... my longer answer was shorter than my short answer. Ah well.\n\nA: \nI'm not sure if I am programming this wrong, or gcc is just not a good compiler, or whatever.\n\nThe first one: scanf(\"%d\\n\", &i); should be scanf(\"%d\", &i);.\nAlso other errors:\n\n\n*\n\n*The second argument of main() should be casted either to a pointer to an array of characters or to a pointer to a pointer to a character: char *argv[] or char **argv;\n\n*If i is not a number, it will still be casted to an integer both in if(i % 2 == 0) and else if(i % 2 != 0) in order for the expression to be evaluated (in fact you'll never get to the else block using that code, as either if(i % 2 == 0) or else if(i % 2 != 0), being i implicitly casted to an integer, will evaluate to true).

I need to access tomcat manager also. \n\nA: You can also simply edit the server.xml file of Tomcat, and add a new Connector node with this configuration:\n<Connector port=\"80\" protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\" connectionTimeout=\"20000\" redirectPort=\"8443\" />\n\nThis will allow you access the application as http://www.domain_name.com/AppName. If you would like to drop the AppName part, you can publish the application as a ROOT application.\n\nFor a website though, it is a good idea to use an Apache or an nginx server as a reverse proxy to Tomcat, and also use them for serving static content.\nIn this case, you do not need to use the software as a ROOT application, as you can proxy that part of the URL too.\n\nA: Please rename your .war file to ROOT.war and restart the server \n\nA: You could use an Apache proxy configuration, so Apache proxies everything on www.domainname.com to your Tomcat App.\nSomething like this in Apache:\n<VirtualHost :80>\nServername www.domainname.com\nProxyPass/ http://ip-address:8080/AppName\nProxyPassReverse / http://ip-address:8080/AppName\n</VirtualHost>\n\nOf course you may need to enable proxy in Apache first and do basic configuration for Apache\n", "Q: Skype become ugly Something wrong happened to my skype:\n\nFew days ago popup messages became appearing without text, just the grey box and smileys window also was wrong ( I didn't see any smile but the firsyt :).

I can change between the layouts with setxkbmap, but setting the toggle option with setxkbmap -option grp:super_space_toggle \"us,fr\" has no effect.\nWhen I start fiddling with fcitx-configure I can't get the hotkey combo I want (super+space) to toggle between my two layouts (fr-fr and en-us). (Did the keyboard configuration utility change with the upgrade?) Here's the screenshot of the dialogue window:\n\nWhich parameters here do I have to alter? (note \"scroll between input method\" options are limited to ALT_SUPER, CTRL_SUPER, ALT_SHIFT, CTRL_SHIFT).\nAdditionally, when I open a new window or terminal tab, my keyboard toggles layouts (it's not toggled by CRTL_SHIFT btw). How do I prevent this?\n\nA: OK; I finally figured out what the (more user-friendly?) input widget from v14 was called: ibus. IBUS accepts super+space as language toggle, as well as seems to generally just ... well, work. You define control key combinations and it listens and actually acts upon them (which is more than I can say for fcitx). It's available for v15. See https://code.google.com/p/ibus/wiki/Ubuntu for various installation tactics.\n\nA: I think what you're trying to find there is \"trigger input method\", i.e. the very first item in the list. You have to activate fcitx first to use any keyboard layouts you selected in fcitx, and scroll through different input methods. Otherwise you'll always be using the default physical keyboard without any layer added on top of it. Pressing that hotkey again deactivates fcitx and returns you to the default keyboard.\n", "Q: Printer via USB I am trying to add my HP printer to my Ubuntu.

Uninstall livemedia-utils if you already have it installed (which you probably do)\nsudo apt-get remove livemedia-utils\n\nOtherwise you'll have two copies and might sometimes use the wrong one. This happened to me when I put my openRTSP scripts into crontab to run on reboot, or into rc.local. In both cases I also needed to specify the full path of openRTSP (after doing the below, it will be in /usr/local/bin)\nFrom the terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run as root:\nsudo -i\n\n\n*Go to /usr/src:\ncd /usr/src\n\n\n*Get the live555 liveMedia source code:\nwget http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/live555-latest.tar.gz\n\n\n*Unpack it: \ntar -xzf live555-latest.tar.gz\n\n\n*Go into the directory that's just been unpacked:\ncd live\n\n\n*Generate the make files: \n./genMakefiles linux\n\n\n*Build the code:\nmake\n\n\n*Install the new version:\nmake install\n\n\n*Stop being root:\nexit\n\n\n*Enjoy streaming with your camera.\n\nA: I had a similar problem (2mins stream limit)!

How can I add an icon to Panel for e.g. like Dropbox which when on clicked provides a dropdown menu with several options, each option on clicking runs a shell script or a program with some arguments (nice to have - report success or failure) .\n\nA: You can create a custom launcher icon to execute your scripts. Open your favourite text editor and copy the snippet below:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=My Scripts\nName[de]=Meine Skripte\nExec=myscript_0.sh\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nIcon=terminal\nStartupNotify=true\nActions=ContextMenu1;ContextMenu2\n\n[Desktop Action ContextMenu1]\nName=Run script 1\nName[de]=Skript 1 starten\nExec=myscript_1.sh\n\n[Desktop Action ContextMenu2]\nName=Run script 2\nName[de]=Skript 2 starten\nExec=myscript_2.sh\n\nNow it's time to modify this stub above, as it will not be useful as it is for you!\n[Desktop Entry] section:\n\n\n*\n\n*Encoding=UTF-8 Better not modify this line, because otherwise you will get problems if you use any non-ASCII characters in this file.\n\n*Name=... Enter any string here, it will be the default English name of the launcher item.\n\n*Name[de]=... Same as Name=, but for the German (de) translation.\nIt's just an example, you may remove all these lines with [de] or replace them with another locale code.\n\n*Exec=... Enter the command you want to execute if the launcher icon is clicked here.\n If the script is located in a folder listed in the $PATH environment variable, the executable's name only is enough, otherwise you have to specify the full path.\n Make sure that there's no typo and that the script is executable (chmod +x and it starts with a valid \"shebang\" line)!\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal=true If you set it to false instead, no terminal window will be opened and the script will run in background.\n\n*Type=Application Do not change this line.\n\n*Icon=terminal Specifies the icon of the launcher item. You may use generic names like terminal or enter the full path to an image file.\n\n*StartupNotify=true Causes the mouse pointer to perform the \"waiting\" animation (spinning circle/hourglass) in the time between clicking the icon and when the window opens. You may set it to false if you want.\n\n*Actions=... Lists the internal identifier names for the context menu entries. They have to match those used in the context menu section headlines ([Desktop Action ...]) and need to be a semicolon-separated list without spaces.\n\n\n\n[Desktop Action ...] sections:\nYou only need the keys Name (and translations like Name[de], if you want) and Exec here. The same criteria as above apply here as well.\nAlso make sure again that the identifier (here ContextMenu1 and ContextMenu2) in the section headline appear in the Actions= list above!\nThe number of such context menu blocks is unlimited.\n\nAfter you modified the example stub above, save it in the directory ~/.local/share/applications/ with a custom file name, but the extension .desktop. \nThen it should appear in your Unity Dash's Application Lens (Super+A). If it does not, log out and back in to update it. Then drag it from the Dash onto the launcher bar with your mouse.

Any help would be appreciated!\nRegards\n\nA: So, I finally got this sorted out and it turns out it can also help for other devices like customer displays and generally for any other \"serial to usb\" devices which do not get automatically mapped to ttyUSBX.\nThe main problem appears to be that the ftdi_sio driver (Serial to USB driver) does not recognize a specific device automatically although the USB subsystem does (lsusb). Additionally, depending on the distribution, this kernel module might or might be not loaded. So basically our goal is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load the ftdi_sio driver if necessary\n\n*Register our product into the ftdi_sio driver\n\n\nLoad the ftdi_sio driver\nIf it is loaded, the lsmod | grep \"ftdi_sio\" command should output something like this in a Terminal prompt:\nftdi_sio               53248  0\nusbserial              53248  1 ftdi_sio\n\nOtherwise, we have to load it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Temporary, by issuing the command sudo modprobe ftdi_sio\n\n*Permantently, by adding the line ftdi_sio at the end of the /etc/modules (might be different in non-debian distributions!) file and restarting.\n\n\nRegister our product into the ftdi_sio driver\nOk, so the module should be loaded by now. Now, we need to register the product into the driver. Here comes the silly part because some vendors tell you to issue the following command:\nmodprobe ftdi_sio vendor=05e0 product=1900\n\nWhere vendor and product are the values you get from the USB-Subsystem by issuing, for instance, the usb-devices command and preceded by \"0x\";\nBut according to this commit this does absolutely nothing from Kernel 3.12 onwards:\n\nRemove the vendor and product module parameters which were added a\n  long time ago when we did not have the dynamic sysfs interface to add\n  new device ids (and which isn't limited to a single new vid/pid pair).\nA vid/pid pair can be added dynamically using sysfs, for example:\necho 0403 1234 >/sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio/new_id\nAlso fix up the in-code comment that got the sysfs path wrong.\nSigned-off-by: Johan Hovold  Signed-off-by: Greg\n  Kroah-Hartman \n\nSo, following this information, what you have to do is issue the following command:\necho 05e0 1900 >/sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio/new_id\n\nCan't recall right now if a restart is needed after that, but keep that in mind if the device does not work after it inmediately.\nSummary\nLuckily, I love my job more than my wife.

Check it with \"initctl status mysql\".\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty, MySQL is started with an Upstart unit, but SLURM is still started by a SysV-init script, which are all started by the \"rc\" Upstart unit. Initially, there is no dependencies between these two, so they can be started in parallel.\nIt seems to work reliably in my setup after I modified the MySQL unit to start before the rc unit, and not just on a run-level, i.e. replace the line \"start on runlevel [2345]\" in /etc/init/mysql.conf with \"start on starting rc RUNLEVEL=[2345]\".\nUse these two lines if you want it automated, for instance in a preseed script:\nsudo dpkg-divert --local -add /etc/init/mysql.conf\nsudo sed -i \"s/^\\(start on\\) runlevel \\[2345\\]/\\1 starting rc RUNLEVEL=[2345]/\" /etc/init/mysql.conf\n\n", "Q: Ansible /SSH questions?

Had to start up the installation disk with nomodeset as it wouldn't get past the loading screen. After installing the OS everything seemed to be running pretty decently until I tried installing the proprietary Nvidia drivers for my GTX 960M GPU. \nI've reinstalled the OS 3 times after hosing the graphic settings to the point where X refuses to even load trying to fix the issue. Once I've installed the stable version of the proprietary driver in Settings -> Software & Updates -> Additional Drivers my laptop refuses to get past the login screen. It will appear as if it's loading, flash an fsck message on the screen for a fraction of a second, and then go right back to the login screen ad infinitum....\nTo cap things off, when the laptop 'is' working and isn't using the proprietary drivers the screen won't wake up from sleeping if I close and open the lid, though I'm thinking this issue also stems from the lack of a proper graphics driver.\nHow would I begin to resolve this issue?\n\nA: I had similar issue with my laptop which was having Nvidia GTX 950M(almost close to what you have).\nMy advice even if the proprietary Nvidia drivers might perform better - it's better to stick to the opensource versions as they seems to be more compatible(at least in my case for 2 machines during the last 6 months)\nHere are the steps\nGenerally you should use the drivers from the official Ubuntu repositories.\nBecause you are having problems, using the latest drivers might be better.\nInstall the latest official stable NVIDIA drivers for the GEFORCE GTX 960M.\nBased on this link you should install nvidia-361(which support GTX 960M). M is the mobile varient - on desktops you will find no M at the end of the model.\nFirst uninstall the currently installed NVIDIA drivers.Boot the computer, when the GRUB menu appears ...\nHighlight the Ubuntu menu entry and press the E key.Add nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line. Press F10 to boot the Ubuntu operating system.\nWhen the login screen appears press Ctrl+Alt+F1.Enter your user name and the password, then execute :\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*  \nsudo reboot  \n\nNow install the latest official stable NVIDIA drivers.Boot the computer, when the GRUB menu appears ...\nHighlight the Ubuntu menu entry and press the E key.Add nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line.

In case any package installed later will need them they will be re-installed as a dependency. I recommend however that you re-install dkms again, as we need it for keeping kernel modules installed through any future kernel updates.\nAfter that you will be able to install a newer release of Virtual Box, either from a downloaded Debian package, or by adding the Oracle repository to your sources as was further elaborated here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install the VirtualBox version from Oracle to install an Extension Pack?\n\nA: Hi you can safely remove Virtualbox 4.3 and it's packages with the following\nsudo apt-get remove virtualbox-4.3*\nsudo apt-get purge virtualbox-4.3\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthen download the new version 5 and install it\n\nA: I did the following...\nMy system is Debian-7.9.0 64-bit.

Please stay tuned - I will give you all advice necessary to get everything running!\nSo let's start …\nFirst boot into your Windows installation and disable hibernation and Fast Boot.\nDisable hibernation by opening command prompt as administrator and execute:  \npowercfg /h off  \n\nTo disable Fast Boot open Control Panel (the old version - not the modern design),\nselect the Energy Settings, enable show hidden settings and uncheck Fast Boot.  \nShut down the machine completely – do NOT reboot!  \nBoot from Ubuntu installation media and highlight Try Ubuntu without installing.\nPress 'e' and add nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line, then press F10.  \nOn the live desktop press the Windows key and type GParted into the search field.\nOpen GParted and reduce the Windows partition if there is no unallocated space.\nCreate two new partitions and format one with ext4 - the other with linux-swap.\nNow start the Ubuntu installer from the desktop and choose Something else.\nSelect the ext4 partition you have created before and choose / as mount point.\nSelect the same disk on which Windows is installed to install the bootloader to.\nStart the Ubuntu installation process and when everything is completed, restart the computer.\nBoot into BIOS and select Ubuntu in UEFI settings to be the default operating system to boot.\nNow you are able to select the operating system you want to boot from the GRUB boot menu.  \nBoot Ubuntu installation and first of all install the most recent stable NVIDIA graphics drivers.  \nWhen the login screen appears press keys Ctrl+Alt+F1.  \nEnter your user name and the password and then execute:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-355 nvidia-prime\nsudo reboot  \n\nNow you can boot into the desktop of the Ubuntu installation and start to customizing …\n\nNote: \nIf you want to install Ubuntu to another disk, you can do so even if it is not recommended.\nImportant – boot loader has to be installed to the same disk where Windows is installed.\n", "Q: How to create and transfer files from desktop to remote server?

In its simplest form that would be:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Some Name\nExec=gksu python3 /path/to/script \nType=Application\n\nIf the script is executable, you could simply use:\nExec=gksu /path/to/script \n\nIn the Exec= -line\nimportant notes\n\n*\n\n*You need to make the .desktop file executable to make it work on double- click.\n\n*You can \"dress up\" the .desktop file with more options, such as an icon etc., as shown here.\n\nAlternatively\nMore complicated and kind of a detour, but it should be mentioned nevertheless:\nYou could set nautilus to run (executable) scripts on double- click, as described here.\nThen (doing it \"your way\"), a separate bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\ngksu python3 /path/to/script\n\nmade executable, would also run the python script, similarly to the .desktop file.\n\nA: Sorry not enough rep to commet. \nDid your try giving the file the correct permissions.\nTry giving rwx to everyone to see if that works, you can change it to your desired setting later. \nsudo chmod 777 'script.py'.\n\nTry this to fix the path problem \ngksudo ./script \n\n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows 8 - Ubuntu 14.04 with msdos partition table I have a self-installed Windows 8 on a disk with a msdos partition table.

(change my disk to GPT would wipe everything)\nDetailed boot info : http://paste.ubuntu.com/13075035/\n\nSolution: use GPT.\n\nA: This is the first I've heard of Windows successfully booting in EFI mode from an MBR disk. Normally Windows will refuse to install in this way, so it's a mystery to me how you got it set up. (From a backup of a GPT disk, perhaps?)\nIn any event, your configuration is so unusual that if you can't fix it yourself, you're likely to be on your own. (Note that I'm the maintainer of the rEFInd boot manager and the author of the GPT fdisk partitioning tools. I point this out to emphasize just how far off the map you've gone.)\nYou can use gdisk to convert from MBR to GPT, but I don't know how the Windows boot loader will react to that change. Personally, I think that's what I'd do, given that the system has stopped booting with the Ubuntu installation, so there's very little damage left to be done, and you might as well fix the boot problem after converting to the more conventional GPT setup. If you do this, be sure to convert /dev/sdb2 to a (gdisk) type code of EF00, which identifies the ESP. (It's currently an MBR type code of 0x0b, which is not the proper ESP type code on MBR.)\n", "Q: DLink DWA 131 wireless adapter not working on ubuntu 15.10 I recently purchased  DWA 131 adapter.

I tried to install ubuntu willy werewolf on my desktop but it didn't work. The graphic look horrible. words aren't showing correctly. some letters are missing. I tried  one  month ago ubuntu 15.04  This version worked correctly. and it's 14.04 work correctly too.Please help.\nYour sincerely Agnieszka\n\nA: I have the same hardware (xps 8700 with nvidia 745 gtx) and I confirm the problems: graphic looks horrible, words aren't showing correctly, some letters are missing. Moreover, login window (never seen in ubuntu live!) goes blank and then returns to the login screen again in a never ending loop when you try to access. \nI can also confirm, with 15.04 all is fine (nouveau).  I'm still investigating the problem. If you create a USB live with persistent capability (see How to create UEFI-only bootable USB live media?) passing 'nomodeset' argument to the kernel when booting (press 'e' on grub and insert 'nomodeset' before 'quiet' argument), you will able to run 15.10 in a low resolution and login window will disappear! \nWith this configuration, you can try to update ubuntu (apt-get update; apt-get upgrade) or to install nvidia driver since live session uses noveau as default. These systems have failed on my Dell so I think it is a bug related to the new kernel 4.2 (see also this post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2300068). \nSince live usb with persistency can't update the kernel, in the next week I will try to install Ubuntu on a removable device to try to find out the actual problem. Another way is to update 15.10 iso with a new kernel. Wait and see.\nUpdate: a fresh install with 4.2.0-19-generic works fine using nvidia driver 352.63. As stated above, pass nomodeset argument to the kernel, update and upgrade ubuntu, and then enable the proprietary nvidia driver. \n", "Q: Make Espeak read the words from picture on ubuntu I m working on a project that helps visually impaired people to listen to the writings on the printed paper.

I am a newbie in C programming language.

To do this, you'll need a C compiler, like gcc. You can install this with:\nsudo apt-get install gcc\n\nThen, to compile your program, creating an executable called file:\ngcc -Wall -o file file.c\n\nWhich you should then be able to run:\n./file\n\n\nA: Fabrice Bellard's TCC seems to be still in the repositories. It can run in a kind of interpreter-mode which makes the following possible:\nYou can make a simple C-file executable like the OP tried to do by adding the line\n#!/usr/bin/tcc -run\nto the very top of the file.\nIt also accepts input from STDIN by adding an empty option (just the minus sign -) at the end.\n$ /usr/bin/tcc -run - <<EOF\n> #include <stdio.h>\n> int main()\n> {\n>    printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n>    return 0;\n> }\n> EOF\nHello World\n\nor with echo\necho  '#include <stdio.h> int main(){printf(\"Hello World\\n\");return 0;}' | /usr/bin/tcc -run -\nor just run /usr/bin/tcc -run - type your code and start the run with CTRL + D\nSeems useless and silly but the last method is the fastest (for me, YMMV etc.) to check for a function in a large library, look up the exact value of a constant etc. And it is small (180k) which makes it a good fit for e.g. the Raspberry-Pi.\nMain disadvantage: development stopped (last version is from 2013).\n\nA: AFAIK, you have to compile C code before executing it like so:\ngcc file.c\n\n\nA: C language unlike python is not an interpreting language. The C source code or simply the code written need to be compiled first to make it executable i.e, machine readable form.\nYou have to first compile it by using command\n\ncc -Wall filename.c \n\ncc - GCC compiler\n-Wall - Checks for error\nfilename.c - your file in which C code is saved with .C extension.\nYou will get an executable file named \"a.out\" in the working directory of your source code. \n\nA: \nI have a small problem which is run the file\n\nTo answer your question:\n\nWhere is the problem ??\n\nit is enough to say that you cannot run the executable file yet because you have not yet produced it. Your file, file.c, is the \"source code\" written in the language of \"C\". This source code is not something that is executable because the C language was designed to be writeable in an easy to understand way (at least 'easy' by human standards... even then, it's not easy at first - but it get's easier). The (source) code you write is then converted into a form that a computer can read easily. This process is called 'compiling'. Compiling creates a file which is executable by a computer. It is this step that you have not done. If you type \nwhich gcc\n\nand you get back something like /usr/bin/gcc then you have gcc already installed on your system. If you get back nothing - then you dont. If you don't have gcc then you can get gcc (provided you have the correct privileges) by doing:\nsudo apt install gcc\n\n(NB: apt might not work if you're on some older release of the linux distribution - you can replace it with apt-get)\nIf you do have gcc then go right ahead and type:\ngcc file.c\n\nand you will find an executable file called a.out has magically appeared in your directory. This is the file you've been looking for. Run it with\n./a.out\n\nThe other answers have other things like -o and -Wall which you can learn about through the manual for gcc which you can access by typing:\nman gcc\n\nThat should keep you going for a couple of years... welcome to coding - Enjoy!\n", "Q: resolvconf Error when running dhclient in recovery mode when I go to recovery mode and I want to activate networking, I usually type:\ndhclient eth0\n\nAfter this, I can for example ping to www.google.com.\nHowever, I get the following error:\nRTNETLINK answers: File exists\nresolvconf: Error: /run/resolvconf/interface either does not exist or is not a directory\n\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: Open your terminal and type as \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nAnd try again. \n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.04 autologin problems I'm having a login problem.

The script calls notify-send to do this, and notify-send requires a D-Bus environment variable to work: DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS.\nWhen I run my script from the terminal, it produces notifications just fine. But I use systemd to run my script whenever I log in, and when systemd runs the script, it no longer produces notifications.

However, Ubuntu runs noticeably slower than before and takes much longer to boot (17 seconds) Any ideas? cause I don't have any. Re-post with any tests/outputs I should preform please :D \n\nA: Of course Ubuntu takes longer to boot. By definition, an HDD is slower than an SSD. And even if you didn't have Ubuntu on an SSD before, newer versions of Ubuntu take slightly longer to boot compared to older versions. Just compare the boot times from MSDOS to Windows 10: the newer version is slower. \nAt 17 seconds for a boot time, you really don't have a problem, and certainly nothing to complain about. \n", "Q: What's the best way to have a charm control Juju? Is it possible to a charm to ask juju to start another machine, add instances of a service or destroy instances? For instance, by doing something simular to the juju gui: how juju gui performs the creation of machines, for instance? I´d to have a service that monitors other services and add instances to scale out, for instance.\n\nA: There are a few ways this is possible.\nInstalling and calling Juju binaries\nThe charms.reactive layer at https://github.com/galgalesh/juju-client does this. The basic process is to first bootstrap the environment, then deploy a charm passing in all the configuration, state and secrets files necessary to control the environment. The charm installs the juju client, rebuilds ~/.juju, and can now control the environment from the inside.\nThis layer is still experimental. If you encounter any issues, file a bug report in the github repo.\nUsing the Python Juju client\nThere is a Python client to manage Juju environments. This client calls the Juju api. You could put this in a Charm.\nUsing the Go API\nYou can find the go api here: https://godoc.org/github.com/juju/juju/api\nUsing Perl bindings\nIf you're into that sort of stuff: https://metacpan.org/release/Juju\nCalling the api directly\nFor more information on that, see this question: Is there a Juju REST API?\n", "Q: How to fix the error warning failed to connect to lvmetad falling back to internal scanning My computer recently started giving me an error right after I installed gnome.

Reboot and select to boot to that device. Go ahead and let it boot to the normal live session. Click on the desktop icon to install Ubuntu.\nSomewhere, around the 7th step as I recall, you're given an option.

The question is simple and straight forward:\nHow to boot from an USB drive in VirtualBox?\nEDIT:\nI have attached usb to VirtualBox as shown in the screenshot.\n\nBut it is not possible to boot from an USB drive even when attached  (reference).\nSo I would like to know if there is any other possiblity to boot from an USB drive?\n\nA: If your USB drive is an EFI bootable drive then Plop Boot Manager will not work as it does not support EFI boot. What worked for me in such case was using rEFInd boot manager (http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/).\n\n\n*\n\n*Download rEFInd bootable iso from http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.11.4/refind-cd-0.11.4.zip/download and unzip it.\n\n*Open virtual machine settings in VirtualBox and attach the rEFInd CD ISO file.\n\n*Make sure that \"Enable EFI (special OSes only)\" option in virtual machine settings in \"System\" tab is enabled.\n\n*Boot the virtual machine and you should see rEFInd boot menu:\n\n\n\n*Attach your USB drive in VirtualBox.\n\n*Press backspace to refresh the menu or just wait few seconds and drive should appear in the menu.\n\n*Select your USB drive and hit enter and your USB drive should start booting.\n\nA: EDIT: 7 Mar 2018\nSomething to note here.  Leaving the USB drive in the computer when you reboot can change the /dev/sd drive letter designation causing the raw usb.vmdk file to point to the incorrect drive so it does not boot in VirtualBox.  As a test I left one in my system.  It was /dev/sdi before I rebooted, after reboot it was /dev/sdc.  When you reboot your computer for any changes please remove the USB drive prior to rebooting.  I am looking into if the raw disk can be created from the UUID of the drive instead as that will not change.\n\nSince VirtualBox does not boot to USB drives, you can create a .vmdk file that points to your USB drive for booting to it. \nNOTE:  You MUST add your user account to the vboxusers group for VirtualBox to see your USB.  You MUST also add your account to the disk group as well, or you cannot add the .vmdk file to your Virtual Machine.  Added instructions below in EDIT.  This also does not copy the USB drive to the hard drive and uses the USB directly.  This can be helpful if there is persistence on the USB that you want to keep.  Not every situation is the same so this may not work for every case.\nFirst, you need to have your USB you created in your system, and determine what the physical drive is.  We are going to assume that your drive is mounted as /dev/sdb1.  So, the physical drive would be /dev/sdb.\nNext, type in the following from a terminal window to create the .vmdk file that points to the USB drive:\nsudo vboxmanage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename  ~/usb.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb\n\nOr\nsudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename  ~/usb.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb\n\nThen you should see something similar to this:\nRAW host disk access VMDK file /home/ravan/usb.vmdk created successfully.\n\nNote: Some people have had issues of ownership of the newly created file.  Take ownership of the new file:\nsudo chown $USER:$USER ~/usb.vmdk\n\nThen all you should have to do is to add the .vmdk file to your VirtualBox Virtual Machine and make sure that you can boot to it.\n\nEDIT: \nTo add your user to the vboxusers group, run the following command:\nsudo usermod -a -G vboxusers username\n\nTo add your user to the disk group, run the following command:\nNote:  Adding your user to the disk group can be dangerous and a security risk.  It is as dangerous as having sudo access to write to a raw disk.\nsudo usermod -a -G disk username\n\nThen you MUST REBOOT your system in order for the changes to take effect.\nBefore reboot:\n\nAfter reboot:\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I would suggest the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disks.   \n\n*Look for the USB.  \n\n*Click there and at the top right corner you will see a settings icon that has 3 parallel lines.  \n\n*Click there and choose Create Disk Image...\n\n*Select the location and click Create. It will create an .img file which you can use in VirtualBox.\n\n\nA: I came to this post just few days ago. I don't want to use Plop Boot Manager, because my USB stick is already bootable.\nSo I tried to point the USB stick to a VMDK disk (as in Terrance answer) by creating vboxmanage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename  ~/usb.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb\nUnfortunately, this refused to work... I chmod and chown the usb.vmdk disk, and so I was able to attach it to a VM but it simply didn't work.\nFinally, I tried another solution and this one has worked flawlessly. Here it is (thanks to Gean Santos for the research):\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert USB stick and identify it (mine is /dev/sdb , running Sabayon Linux);\n\n*Create a .vmdk disk by converting the raw device (i.e. the USB stick) to a VirtualBox disk\nsudo VBoxManage convertfromraw /dev/sdb ./usb.vmdk --format vmdk\n\n\n*Now you have a usb.vmdk disk created from your bootable USB stick. I tried also dd the USB stick to an image file and create the .vmdk disk from the image file. It works, as well as .vdi disks created the former way (or from the image file)\n\n*Now, give permissions to the created disk in order VirtualBox can access the file. It just means change the file owner to an user that are in vboxusers group. If your VirtualBox install is running OK, than this owner would be, probably, you:\nsudo chown `whoami`:`whoami` ./usb.vmdk\n\n\n*Now, you just have to attach the usb.vmdk disk to a Virtual Machine. But it must be attached to an IDE controller. I tried SATA with no success.\n\nAt this point, you're OK.\nJust boot the new VM, press F12 and choose the bootable drive.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: I did not want to run Virtualbox as root.\nI did not want my user to be of the disk group, having full permissions to all disks.\nSo here is what I got to work:\nFind out what sd the memory stick is. In the following instructions it's sdc.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount memory Stick\nsu -\nchmod 666 /dev/sdc1\nchmod 666 /dev/sdc\nexit # Run the following command as regular user:\nVBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename usb.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdc\nsu - # Back as root again:\nchmod 777 usb.vmdk\nchmod 666 /dev/sdc\n\n\n*Attach usb.vmdk virtualbox machine\nchmod 666 /dev/sdc\n\n\n*Start virtualbox machine\n\n*After done, reset sdc1 permission for security:\nchmod 660 /dev/sdc1\n\nIn the above you can see that I had to reset the permissions for the memory stick a few times, because it would get set back to root each time.\nI'm using Mandriva Linux, but it should be about the same in Ubuntu\n\nA: The easiest solution is to copy the contents of the USB key into an iso file (well, next time I'll just download the iso on the right machine, no USB key needed in the first place)\ndd if=/dev/sdc of=myusbkey.iso\n\nAnd then add this .iso as an optical drive in the VirtualBox settings, under Storage, Controller: IDE (or SATA, I guess).\nNo need to make a .vmdk file, VirtualBox supports .iso files.\n\nA: VirtualBox itself does not support booting from a USB device. In order to boot from a USB device, another bootloader is required. The steps below provide one possible way to accomplish this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Plop Boot Manager (currently v5.0.15)\n\n*Extract the file plpbt.iso from the ZIP archive and save it somewhere.\n\n*Open the settings for the virtual machine and attach the ISO file:\n\n\n*Add a filter for the USB device:\n\n\n*Boot the VM and select the \"USB\" option in the menu:\n\nIf all went well, the machine should now boot from the USB device.\n\nA: For those attempting to do this using VirtualBox on a Windows host, a fully working solution for this is presented here:\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/187721/how-to-boot-from-a-usb-drive-in-virtualbox/\n", "Q: External Hard Drive Restore Installing Ubuntu into my PC, apparently, it got installed into my external hard drive too.

Since I installed ubuntu recently I do not know much about anything, but I like it very much.\nMy question is does the syntax in MonoDevelop differ much from the one in VisualStudio, because VisualStudio uses .NET framework, but ubuntu probably uses something else, and can I/should I use ubuntu for writing programs in it, or should I just use VisualStudio on windows (haven't dual booted my laptop yet, but have win10 on PC).\n\nA: Mono on Ubuntu is almost the same as .NET in MS Windows. The differences are when you want Windows API functions which are not existing in Ubuntu. Otherwise it should work. Microsoft supports Mono development. I guess you can always encounter some functionalities that will not work in mono but in general there should be no problem. Be careful not to use Win API and you should be fine.\nI was developing some programs with MonoDevelop using C# and mono and when I created an exe file it worked unchanged in Windows and vice versa.

This at least worked for the most important code-writing keys: { [ ] } \\.\n\n*Add autokey to Startup Applications (search for “start” to find it) and then add a program with “autokey” as the command.\n\n\nThis solution will work for anything running in the current X-session (I think) but will not work if you start a new terminal session using Ctrl+Alt+[F2-F6].\n", "Q: What happens when a program gets removed from the Software-Center? If Canonical removes a program from the repositories of the Ubuntu Software-Center, what exactly happens to my installation?\nI like using the Software-Center to easily find and install programs on Ubuntu and to manage updates so that the software is always on the latest version. As an example, I'm using the program MediaInfo (for no particular reason). MediaInfo changed their licensing from LGPL to FreeBSD recently: While it is still FOSS, it may be possible that the program (or any other program out of the Software-Center) gets bought by a company that applies a proprietary license or adds other functionality that does not agree with the terms of the Ubuntu software repositories made available to the users in the Software-Center.\nIn this case, it will likely be removed from the Software-Center, if I understand it correctly. What will happen to the program on my computer, if I already have installed it at that point?\nWill it automatically be removed from my system?\nWill it just not be updated to the next version?\nWill the last appropriate version still remain available in the Software-Center?\nAnd will I receive some kind of notification about any of this?\n\nA: \nWhile it is still FOSS, it may be possible that the program (or any other program out of the Software-Center) gets bought by a company that applies a proprietary license or adds other functionality that does not agree with the terms of the Ubuntu software repositories made available to the users in the Software-Center.\n\nNot being FOSS or having a proprietary license has never been an issue for Canonical (see the restricted and multiverse repositories).\nIf something can't stay in the repositories anymore for other reasons:\n\nWhat will happen to the program on my computer, if I already have installed it at that point?\n\nNothing. It will sit there peacefully.\n\nWill it automatically be removed from my system?\n\nNo.\n\nWill it just not be updated to the next version? \n\nYes.\n\nWill the last appropriate version still remain available in the Software-Center?\n\nIt depends on the reasons behind the removal. E.g. if a package is harmful, indeed it will be removed.\n\nAnd will I receive some kind of notification about any of this?\n\nNo.\nYou can however check if a package is not in the repositories at any time by running apt-cache policy <package>;\nA package that has no available version in the repositories won't show a version available from the repositories as a candidate for the installation.\n\nA: No installed package will be removed, if Canonical removes a package from the repositories. The same for a PPA or any other repositories. The only thing that has happened, you will no longer receive updates.\nIf the package should be included in the repositories again, then you will again receive updates. But you will not be explicit informed about the returning.\n\nA: Changes in any repository do not affect your local installation!\nNobody will (be able to) uninstall anything on your personal system.\nHowever, as there will not be any newer versions than your current one available to download from the repository any more then, you can't receive updates for that package.\nIf canonical decides to remove the package from their repositories, they will entirely remove it. What sense would it make for them to keep one version that soon gets outdated if they want to get rid of it? No, they would remove all versions.\nIf the program becomes proprietary though, I could also imagine that instead of removing, they could also just move it to e.g. the universe/multiverse/partner repository, not sure which one would be suitable for which cases...\nAnd you'll probably be able to find a PPA (Personal Package Archive) of someone who continues to distribute this package. If you install the PPA, you receive new packages and updates from there in the same way you did from the repositories. Just beware that PPAs are not as extensively checked against malware and security issues than the repositories, so you have to know the risk.

How can I lock files and programs with custom-set passwords?\nThat is, without changing the permissions of the file so that the sudo password has to be used...\n\nA: Possible method that is not exactly what you are asking\nsudo su\ncd ~\nmkdir tmp\ncd tmp\ntouch file.txt\nchattr -i file.txt\nexit\n\nBack on the normal prompt nobody can do anything with the file. \nYou need to revert the \"chattr\" command with \nchattr +i file.txt\nto have normal access. \"chattr\" can also be used for other permissions. The +a option will make it possible to append to a file but nothing else. \nFrom the make page the options: \n\nSelect the new attributes for the files: append only (a), compressed (c), no dump (d), extent format (e), immutable (i), data journalling (j), secure deletion (s), no tail-merging (t), undeletable (u), no atime updates (A), synchronous directory updates (D), synchronous updates (S), and top of directory hierarchy (T). \n\n\nA: For a custom-set password encryption, I would recommend the gpg symmetric cypher.\nEncoding:\nuser@computer$ gpg --output doc.gpg --symmetric doc\n\nThis will ask for a passphrase and create an encrypted version of doc.\nDecoding:\nuser@computer$ gpg --output doc --decrypt doc.gpg\n\nThis will ask for a passphrase and decrypt doc.gpg as doc.\nThe question is not quite clear with the sudo password. When you run commands with sudo, you are asked your user password on ubuntu. The password of root user is another password, which you can set with the following command:\n user@computer$ sudo passwd root\n\nLinux file systems provide protection by permissions. However, in case somebody boots e.g. a live Ubuntu on your computer, or take your HDD, they can read all your files. Partition encryption is a good tool to prevent this type of data theft.\n\nA: There are several tools you can use to obtain a finer grain of control over files.\nFirst, and most important, each user must have her or her own account.\nFrom there, your first line of defense is standard linux permissions. Make your home directory or a sub directory private.\nchmod 700 /home/your_user\n\nIf you need finer grain of control, use acl . acl allow you to set permissions per user.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissionsACLs\nOne of those two options is going to be sufficient for most user cases.\nThe limitation of permissions are that anyone with root or physical access will be able to access the files.\nIf you need more then that, or if you need to restrict root access, your next option is to use encryption.\nYou can encrypt your home directory either at the time or installation or later. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome\nYou can make a separate encrypted directory (see above link) and Is there a tool to encrypt a file or directory?\nTake care with encryption, as long as the file is decrypted, and your user can read the file, so can root.\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu freezing I'm running Ubuntu 14.04.2 on a dual booted PC which also has Windows installed.\nIf I'm on Windows I have no problems whatsoever but when on Ubuntu it keeps freezing from time to time, forcing me to close and open the laptop lid almost constantly.\nI believe this problem is not from the lack of memory since i have mroe than enough hard drive space in the Ubuntu partition, and I also have 8GB of RAM.\nIf anyone has any idea of what the problem might be and how to solve it I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: I don't have this problem now, but did in the past.

I have Ubuntu 15.10, running Gnome Retro/Flashback/Fallback... whatever it's being called right now. I also have Compiz.\nWhen I play videos in either VLC or Gnome Media player, the screen frequently flashes green. Put another way, every now and again, the whole screen turns completely green, but just for one frame or so. Sometimes this happens multiple times within one second, other times it just happens once. The frequency of when this occurs is random, but I'd say on average as often as once every minute or so.\nThis seems to have started roughly when I upgraded to 15.10, though I can't say with absolute certainty that the upgrade was the dividing factor. Before around that time, video playback worked perfectly.\nThis only affects local video files I play. YouTube and other online videos seem to work fine.\nI found some suggestions on the web for how to fix this. One was to open Compizconfig and check the box for \"Force full screen redraws (buffer swap) on repaint\". The other solution I tried was specific to VLC, and in preferences I unchecked the \"Accelerated video output (Overlay)\" box. Unfortunately, neither suggestion worked.\nHow can I eradicate green flickering from my videos?\n\nA: From settings video output to OpenGL or something other than you are currently using.\n\nA: Hi it sounds like you are experiencing some codec issues I resolved the same problem by installing the restricted pack from ubuntu you can install it buy typing the following in the terminal\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nTake note that it might be illegal in some country's\n\nA: I found that I needed to lower my post-processing setting in VLC.\nDisable it to see if you no longer get any green screen issues and then increase it incrementally to find the sweet spot.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the Tools menu and select Preferences.\n\n*Click on the Video tab and change the setting  in Video - Deinterlacing to Off.\n\n\nA: 1)  The \"green flashing screens\" is a very old \"de-interlacing\" bug\n    which has persisted in VLC player for years.\n2)  It is common to all hardware, drivers and operating systems,\n    including windows.\n3)  Depending on whether the player starts by rendering odd or even frames,\n    the flashing may (or may not) occur every time you play, start, rewind\n    or fast forward a film.\n4)  The flashing is therefore intermittent, neither consistent nor repeatable.\n5)  It occurs in different movie segments at different times in the same file.\n6)  It happens only in certain movie files, most often in ripped DVD's,\n    which contain multiple 1 GB files inside a VIDEO_TS folder.\n7)  It could also (therefore) be the result of incorrect HDCP decoding during\n    the unauthorized DVD rips, using tools like \"SlyFox anyDVD\", such that the\n    resulting (malformed) files confuse the de-interlacing algorithms in VLC player.\n8)  In all cases I have experienced, disabling video de-interlacing in VLC player\n    seems to fix the problem, at the cost of jittery, poor video playback, with a\n    low line count.\n9)  The problem does not seem to effect HD movies in single \"Matroska\" vid containers.\n===\nBTW:\nI wish people in forums stopped trying to sound smart,\nby flooding the forums with dumb \"Generic\" answers like:\n\"Do you have the latest driver update?\" ... or\n\"Is your mouse plugged in?\" ...

My machine has two ethernet ports.  I want to make VMWare exclusively use Eth1.  \nI have a fresh install of Xubuntu Core 15.10 (amd64). I installed VMWare Workstation 12.  It would not run, until I did this.\nThe VMWare virutal network editor will not run from the Workstation menu.  When I go to terminal and run vmware-netcfg as root, it dies without error.\nCan I manually do this in the Xubuntu Network Connections application?  Any other ideas?\n\nA: \nThis answer addresses the new question by the OP, in comments:\n\nAfter reading Thomas W's answer, I realized my question is worded wrong. I don't want to prohibit Eth1 being used by anything else. I want my virtual machines to use only eth1. Don't I need to set up vmnet2 to do that?\n    I would prefer my router to do DNS, NAT, etc. instead of my PC.\n\n\nYou would need the VMware Virtual Network editor tool, run with sudo, to make changes, and then restart the VMware service.\nBut essentially, you have to edit vmnet0 in the editor, and instruct it which network interface to be 'bridged' to.  That will allow the VM to 'work' over the ethernet interface as if it were connected to the network directly.  Note that this does not always work with all network interfaces and setups, and if this does not work correctly then you will need to use NAT or use an external ethernet adapter.\n\nUPDATE - November 11, 2015.\nIn VMware Workstation 12, the networking configuration which addresses the bridged network is in /etc/vmware/networking.\nLook for add_bridge_mapping lines.  For all your physical interfaces, you may have multiple of these lines, like seen here:\nadd_bridge_mapping eth1 -1\nadd_bridge_mapping wlan0 -1\nadd_bridge_mapping eth0 0\n\nChange these so that the one you want to have the bridged connection to has the 0, and the others have -1.  I would emulate this format, with -1 being ahead of the 0 lines.\nUntested, but this is really the changes that the Virtual Network Editor does.\n", "Q: Ubuntu phone - clock on welcome screen showing wrong time I have Ubuntu phone Aquaris BQ 4.5 UE (with latest available updates) and I think the phone uses two dfferent times - different times for different applications.\n1) UTC (which is not my local time) is used:\n1a) by the clock on the welcome screen\n1b) by the clock in the notification bar (top of the screen)\n1c) probably by the alarm clock funtion which is set via application \"Clock\". But the \"Clock\" itself is showing the correct local time. Alarm won't ring when it is supposed to ring but accoridng to some strange rules.

Now I have just one time zone and the alarm clock works.\nSmall note about the hardware. I can agree with the author of the guide.

I accidentaly  did a command to delete Plymouth from my ubuntu 15.04:\nsudo apt-get remove plymouth\n\nand after this my login screen didn't appear any more. After GRUB menu the screen became black and nothing seems to happen. I installed Ubuntu again but the question remains on my mind: What is Plymouth and why it crashed my system?\n\nA: From Wikipedia:\n\nPlymouth is a bootsplash (a graphical representation of the boot process of the operating system) for Linux.

I just purchased a new Dell Inspiron 5558 laptop with built-in installed Ubuntu 14.04, that has a single partition and I have only one problem: I  want to shrink my 1TB drive partition; this Partition has installed Ubuntu and all of my user data installed in it.  I want to make a second 500GB partition.\nHow do I create a second partition from this single one without losing any data?\n\n\nA: You have to boot to a LiveUSB in order to safely resize the partition.  Using gparted on the LiveUSB, you can shrink the existing ext4 partition down to make room for another partition.  You can then add a new partition for storing data there (if Windows needs to read it, then that new partition needs to be NTFS).\nBack up your OS before messing with the partitioning though, sometimes you can lose data, although you should be OK if all you're doing is shrinking the partition (and the process doesn't get interrupted).\n", "Q: I cannot view file permissions after 14.04 upgrade I upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 and have the login loop problem.  I have tried to implement the posted askubuntu solutions regarding this problem, but it seems that I have a core problem that prevents me from accomplishing these tasks.\nWhen I login after  Ctrl-Alt-F1, I try to view the file permissions of .ICEauthority and .Xauthority with ls -1d ~/.*authority, but only the names of the two files are displayed with no permission information.  I'm an entry level Linux user/student and new to this site, so please consider this when you answer.  Thanks for any help.\n\nA: You simply mistyped the command. Correct is:\nls -ld ~/.*authority\n\nWith the lowercase letter \"L\" and not the number 1.\nAn example output on my machine (user \"bytecommander\") would be:\n$ ls -ld ~/.*authority\n-rw------- 1 bytecommander bytecommander 6286 Nov  4 17:27 /home/alphawolf/.ICEauthority\n-rw------- 1 bytecommander bytecommander   54 Nov  4 17:26 /home/alphawolf/.Xauthority\n\nYou can see the permission strings of the form -rw-------.\nWhat the symbols mean from left to right:\n- it's a file. Directories would have a d.\nr the owner user has read access. (no access would be -)\nw the owner user has write access. (no access would be -)\n- the owner user has no execute permission. (permission would be x)\n- the owner group has no read access. (access would be r)\n- the owner group has no write access. (access would be w)\n- the owner group has no execute permission. (permission would be x)\n- all others have no read access. (access would be r)\n- all others have no write access. (access would be w)\n- all others have no execute permission. (permission would be x)\nThere are some more complicated permissions like SUID, SGID or Sticky Bit, but you will very probably not encounter them there.\nHow ~/.Xauthority has to be configured:\nIt needs to be owned by your user and its primary group (same name). In the ls -ld output, the owner is displayed in the 3rd column (in my example \"bytecommander\") and the owning group in the 4th column (\"bytecommander\" as well in my example).\nIf you find e.g. root in both of these columns, you need to change that by running:\nsudo chown $USER: ~/.Xauthority\n\nThe permissions should be set up so that only the owning user has read and write access, everything else is denied.

For that i resized my c drive and that resulted in a new unallocated volume. How should i partition this and how do i install ubuntu in it. I am stuck at the disk selection stage.\n\n\nA: In your unallocated space, you need an ext4 partition to install, and a swap partition that's at least the same size as your RAM. \nI'd recommend partitioning 8GB as swap, and using the rest as the main partition. When you create partitions on the selection screen, set your main partition to mount as /, and your swap to mount as swap. \nEdit: that last part is probably left over from when I used old computers with 1 GB of ram.

Apache starts the first process as the root user to bind to port 80 (or 443) then spawns the remaining processes as www-data.  Is there a way to configure apache and Ubuntu (14.04) to start the first process as www-data also?\n\nA: The Short Answer:\nYou cannot make the first master Apache process start as non-root for the master process in a sane way.  This is because the master process is required to run as superuser in order to bind to port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS), and to access configuration files (in /etc/apache2/ by default) so the workers know what they're supposed to do.\nDetails on this are below, and many web servers in the repositories have similar types of setups (NGINX operates on the same basic principles as well).\n\n\nThe Details\n\nThe Apache Master Process - This Accesses Configuration Files and Binds Workers to Ports <= 1024:\nApache's master process needs to run as root.\nThis is because all the configuration files inside of /etc/apache2/... are typically owned, as root, and in order to access (some) SSL private certificate data (/etc/ssl/private/... usually), it will need superuser power.\nAdministrative access is also needed in order to bind to ports less than 1024, which include port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS), for a web server working with typical HTTP / HTTPS ports to work properly on those ports.\nThe Master process doesn't do much more than this, really, and doesn't handle actual requests from clients, nor does it actually interact with web docroots, etc.\n\nThe Apache Worker Processes - They Handle Requests from and Responses To Web Browsers:\nApache's workers actually handle requests coming in to the web server, and handle accessing data on the system and sending the response to clients.  This is, I believe, where your IT policy really is talking about running as non-root.\nThis runs as www-data which is not an administrator-level account, and does not have elevated privileges.  This is where standard access controls on the system are usable, and is really what the \"Cannot run as root\" restriction really covers - in so much that you do not want the worker processes to be running as root/superuser.\n\nWhy I think there is miscommunication between policy and you, or why I think your IT policies need revisited and you should be talking to the IT people in your environment:\nIf your company / workplace is stating \"We cannot let Apache run as root at all\", then check with the company's IT staff.\nThe reason that this is a 'bad' or 'misinterpreted' policy is because you cannot use http://somewebaddress.tld or https://somewebaddress.tld on your domain if Apache cannot bind to port 80 or 443 respectively.  If they do not want the master process to run as root, then you will have to manually change the ownership of /etc/apache2/* or provide a separate data directory for configurations, and then have all Apache-served sites listen on ports higher than 1024.\n\nA: I disagree with the existing answer (and a hundred answers around the Internet).\nIt is possible to run Apache2 as something other than root.\nThat's not how it is by default though and it's that default behaviour that ships with Ubuntu that is making things really difficult for you. All its scripts and configuration expect to use the root-then-drop-privileges model.\nI'll just address the things commonly cited as \"definitely needing root\" (above and elsewhere):\n\n\n*\n\n*Port 80. Forget for a minute that you might want to run on an unprivileged port (some people do, I used to run Apache like this behind Nginx)... You can still bind low ports as non-root using the Linux capabilities framework (since 2.6.24); giving Apache the rights to bind to whatever ports it likes, regardless of user:\nsudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/sbin/apache2\n\nOr you can use iptables to redirect port 80 to an unprivileged port.\n\n*Reading config files and certificates. By default, the config can be read by any user. If you block www-data (or whatever user is running Apache) from reading config or certificates —which you can— you'll break the server.\nSome people talk about the initial root process as if it can be used to get privileges after startup. That's not the case. That would be horribly insecure. It just marshals unprivileged child processes.\nTruth is you can break things to make this work. Don't do this. At least not until you've read the whole post.\nsudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/sbin/apache2\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop\nsudo chown -R www-data: /var/{log,run}/apache2/\nsudo -u www-data apache2ctl start\n\nAnd there you are. Running Apache like a badass as www-data.\n\nBut I wouldn't do this in production. My code above doesn't have an init script for it so you would need to replace or \"fix\" /etc/init.d/apache2 to stop a root-run version being run, and start your www-data version. That's not a small undertaking; look at the script.\nMore than anything, the privilege-de-escalation model Apache has been using is battle tested. For years. Other servers do it that way too. It's not evil.\nIf your admins are going to get in a hyper-tiffy about what you're running, you have a couple of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do it in a VM (like I did for testing this answer). lxc, docker, etc, etc, etc. Minimal setup, lovely light and clean and can run as a \"normal\" user on the outside while looking like bare metal on the inside.\n\n*Use a httpd that doesn't need root. Apache has a whole ecosystem around it that expects certain things so it's not a good choice. But whichever you pick, you'll likely have to fight their init scripts.\n\n*If you only need super-basic stuff on a non-priv port, you could run:\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\n\n\nA: Using sudo with access configured only to the apache control scripts is generally considered best practice.  Doesn't completely eliminate the transient \"root\" state at the beginning but any security auditor that doesn't understand this is not worth the money they are getting paid.\nIt's also fairly straightforward to install a custom version of Apache in user space to setup all file ownership to a less-privileged user who only has this controlled elevated-privilege through sudo.\n", "Q: PowerShell \"get-command *services*\" equivalent with Terminal?

Before I lost access, my laptop lost power suddenly, so I'm not sure whether there's any corruption going on here.\nWhen it says LOGIN passphrase, I assume it means my most recent passphrase, is this incorrect?\n\nA: No, it's not incorrect (too many negatives...). To unwrap your wrapped-passphrase file you need the last user login passphrase that was used to encrypt/\"wrap\" it. \nIf your user passphrase was changed without you being logged in, through a live or root user, or if something went wrong then you might need a previous login passphrase.\nOr, if you used the ecryptfs-migrate-home script yourself or saw the warning somewhere, you really should have a backup copy of the mount passphrase.

However, I need to achieve something like this with wireless USB adapters.\nI have a wireless USB adapter from EDIMAX that's a Realtek chipset.  I have it in my system for a Kali VM running inside of VMware Workstation, but I want to make it available only to the VM.  Having said that, it is on my computer all the time, and I want Ubuntu to not be able to 'use' it as a network card, and only want it used by the VM.\nThe tricky part: I need to isolate this wifi adapter specifically from being used, while all others are fair game to the system / Network Manager.  This one is dedicated for use in a VM, NOT by the host OS, Ubuntu 14.04.\nI'm thinking a udev rule to prevent it from being used as a network adapter by Ubuntu is the way to go, but I am not sure how to do this or if this is the method to go.  Thoughts on how I can achieve this?\nThe system I am trying to achieve this on is Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nRequested Information\nRelevant lsusb line:\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 7392:7811 Edimax Technology Co., Ltd EW-7811Un 802.11n Wireless Adapter [Realtek RTL8188CUS]\n\n\nA: \nHow ironic the easiest solution to solve the issue happens to be one of the solutions I already knew how to implement.  I now feel silly for asking in the first place...\n\n\nI took an old-school power user approach to the issue.  It's already well known that any interface defined in /etc/network/interfaces will be considered \"Not Managed\" by NetworkManager - thus is the case of my Ethernet card on my laptop and my external USB ethernet adapter when it's connected.\nBasically, I put a udev rule which assigns a specific name to the adapter, vm_wlan0, in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules:\n# USB device 0x:0x (rtl8192cu) \n# EDIMAX EDIMAX EW-7811Un N150 USB 2.0 Wireless nano Adapter\n# Typically used for Kali VM\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"wlan*\", NAME=\"vm_wlan0\"\n\nNow that the interface name is 'static' on the system, in comes the /etc/network/interfaces file changes.  I basically borrowed these from the Debian wiki on Network Configuration which utilizes the /etc/network/interfaces file to bring a device 'up' without giving any real IP, then I tweaked it:\nallow-hotplug vm_wlan0\niface vm_wlan0 inet manual\n    pre-up ifconfig vm_wlan0 up\n    post-up ifconfig vm_wlan0 down\n\nThis permits the computer to boot without failing to configure the network interfaces; at the same time, it brings the wireless adapter 'up' then takes it back 'down' so the device is still present on the host computer, but it is not 'on' from a networking standpoint, nor is it managed by NetworkManager.\n\nA: SYSFS drive/unbind is your way.

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with The Cinnamon desktop environment, and I want to be able to kill the X-Window without it restarting. I already enabled control + alt + backspace in the keyboard settings, but that only restarts the X window, and doesn't terminate it. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: I think that this combo does in fact kill the X server, but the init process restarts it. Remember you are running at 'runlevel 5' which typically means a graphical environment. If you just want to work from a terminal you can CTL-ALT-F1 (up to F6). But your X will still be running on the system, albeit maybe swapped out. \nIf you want to kill the graphical environment altogether then I think you need to tell Linux to go to \"runlevel 3\" (multi user with networking traditionally).\nThe 'telinit 3' command used to be able to do this; not sure if it still does.\nYou need to be root of course, or use sudo. So you could CTL-ALT-F1 then sudo telinit 3.\nWith the advent of systemd way of doing things there are no more runlevels, there are now targets.

When I was making a bootable usb drive by Startup Disk Creator utility, it said that the OS version of ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso is Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS \"Trusty Tahr\" - Beta amd64 (20150805). Why does it say such thing? By the way I am running Startup Disk Creator on 14.04.3 LTS.\n\nA: 14.04.03 was released August 6, 2015. Your iso has the date August 5, so you downloaded it while it was still a beta. \nBut it doesn't matter. You can use it and it will update to the release version. Or you can re-download it if you feel better about it. But there's no need to use 14.04.02, since .03 is the current release.\n\nThat said, there may be a minor bug with the 14.04.3 iso. I also just downloaded the ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso file and in the README.diskdefines it says:\n#define DISKNAME  Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS \"Trusty Tahr\" - Beta amd64\n\nAnd the /.disk/info includes the date info that you are seeing:\nUbuntu 14.04.3 LTS \"Trusty Tahr\" - Beta amd64 (20150805)\n\nSo Startup Disk Creator says the version is a beta because the iso file says it is a beta.\nI haven't been able to find any documentation to say whether this is a bug or is by design. But using dd to burn the disk creates a usb with the label:\nUbuntu 14.04.3 LTS amd64\n\nNote the absence of 'beta' and the date. If it were truly a beta or development branch this would show up in the name.\nSo Startup Disk Creator is just displaying the info that it sees. Whether the bug is with the iso (and the creators neglected to remove 'beta' from those to spots) or the bug is with how SDC pulls the info to display, I can't say. \nYou are better off just using sudo dd if=/path/to/iso of=/dev/usually-sdb, although you need to be very careful that you have the output file (device) named correctly before pressing Enter.\nIn the end, the iso is fine to use and I seriously doubt there is any reason to think you would have ever noticed any issue at all if you had originally used dd to create the installation media.\n", "Q: how can we track user activity?

It looks as though I'm still being limited to the 2TB thing but I'm not sure if that's my problem or not. Would be grateful some pointers please.\nThanks.\n\nA: Don't use MBR on a disk with over 2^32 sectors (2TiB, assuming 512-byte logical sectors)!\nMBR uses 32-bit sector pointers, so anything with more than 2^32 sectors is simply incompatible with MBR -- or at least, MBR tops out at 2^32 sectors, so you won't be able to use the full capacity of the disk, as you've discovered. There are hackish workarounds that can be used to get up to about twice that capacity, but they're unreliable, especially if the disk is to be used across multiple OSes. (As a side note, you seem to be confusing TB and TiB; they aren't the same. See this page for details.)\nInstead, use the GUID Partition Table to partition the disk. You can do this with GPT fdisk (gdisk, sgdisk, or cgdisk), or with most libparted-based tools (parted, GParted, and others). Recent versions of fdisk also support GPT, but Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't yet provide that version. (I think one of the later non-LTS releases does, but I don't recall when it was introduced, in Ubuntu version terms.) GPT fdisk is a GPT-specific tool modeled after fdisk, and so uses GPT by default. The others require explicit commands to use GPT rather than MBR.\nIf you plan to boot from the disk, you should either switch from BIOS-mode to EFI-mode booting (if your computer supports it) or add a BIOS Boot Partition to the disk. The former approach will also require an EFI System Partition (ESP). Switching to EFI-mode booting is preferable, if your computer supports that option.

I disabled this feature, but was wondering if I could configure Gnome to open a terminal in the mount directory instead.\nEDIT: I am using Ubuntu 15.10.\n\nA: An edited version of this script does the job.\nWhen a (any) usb device is being connected, a gnome-terminal is opened in its (root) directory. \nIn the example, when a 14.04 usb startup flash drive is connected:\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ndef get_mountedlist():\n    return [(item.split()[0].replace(\"├─\", \"\").replace(\"└─\", \"\"),\n             item[item.find(\"/\"):]) for item in subprocess.check_output(\n            [\"lsblk\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split(\"\\n\") if \"/\" in item]\n\ndef identify(disk):\n    command = \"find /dev/disk -ls | grep /\"+disk\n    output = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    if \"usb\" in output:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndone = []\nwhile True:\n    mounted = get_mountedlist()\n    new_paths = [dev for dev in mounted if not dev in done and not dev[1] == \"/\"]\n    valid = [dev for dev in new_paths if identify(dev[0]) == True]\n    for item in valid:\n        os.chdir(item[1])\n        subprocess.Popen([\"gnome-terminal\"])\n    done = mounted\n    time.sleep(4)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as open_usb.py\n\n*Test- run the script. with the command:\npython3 /path/to/open_usb.py\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add the command:\npython3 /path/to/open_usb.py\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*I tested it on Unity (14.04), but it is unlikely it would break on any Ubuntu version, as long as it has the default configuration (including python3)\n\n*The script only runs a very simple and lightweight check, every four seconds. In my tests, I could not determine any additional processor load. \n\n\n\n\nEDIT\nAs mentioned in a comment, although the script works as it should, one issue occurs when you safely remove the usb device: a warning is given that the volume is \"occupied\" by the script. \nThe cause is that the script cd -s into the directory of the volume, before opening the terminal in the root directory of the volume.\nThe solution\nThe solution is quite simple; make the script leave the directory again after having opened the terminal in the usb device's root directory.

Allow another user to access partitioned drives on Ubuntu 15 I'm relatively new to this Linux OS. I am not familiar with the command code or what it stands for. What I wanted to ask is I have a 750GB SSD partitioned into 4 ext4 drives. One for entertainment, one for my wife's storage, one for my storage, and one for gaming stuff. They are respectively named as 'Entertainment', Bethy's Drive, Ed's Drive, and Games/Extra. What I would like to accomplish is to allow my wife's account (username bethy) access to do everything to her drive, and also be able to save stuff to Entertainment as well. I would have sole permission to Games/Extra and Ed's Drive. I have given myself owner permission by formatting the drives directly from the desktop since formatting in GPARTED only gave permission to root and made it so I couldn't access them. After I fixed that, I attempted to try and give permissions to user bethy for the two drives named above and I get one of two restrictions. \n\n\n*\n\n*If the drive is unmounted it asks for my password as authentication as a superuser. \n\n*If the drive is mounted, it doesn't even open at all and gives absolutely no response. \nCan someone please assist me in understanding what I would need to do to restrict user bethy to the two specific drives? Preferably I would like to restrict access to the main Computer drive as well to only myself, but I have no way of editing those permissions for even myself let alone another user. \n\nA: First you will need to make the drives mount at boot by editing /etc/fstab. See:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab\nOnce you have modified fstab and restarted and all the drives are mounted in the correct place you can set up permissions.\nYou will need to change the owner of Bethy's drive to her. Assuming it is mounted in /media/Bethy you can do this by running the following in the terminal.\nsudo chown bethy:bethy /media/Bethy -R\n\nThis will change the user and group to be bethy. (If you need to be able to access her files then you should add yourself to her group.. see below.)\nSo your own partitions are owned by you, and the group should also be you. Lets assume all your drives are mounted in /media you could run:\nls -al /media/\n\nThis should list the drives in the form\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 julian agroup  4096 Jun  1 22:44 SomeName\n\nThis tells us that the directory \"SomeName\" (which could be a mounted drive, as they just mount as directories) is owned by julian and has the group \"agroup\". The first block tells us some permission info, the first letter tells us it is a directory; the next 3 are the owner read, write, execute permissions; the next 3 are the group, read, write, execute permissions; final 3 are the read, write, execute permissions for any other user.\nFor each drive you will want to make sure the other permissions are off. For example for the bethy drive you would run this command\n    chmod -R o-rwx /media/bethy\nthis recursively removes the read, write, and execute permissions for all users that are not bethy or in the bethy group, on all files in bethy.\nFor the drives you want access for just you, you should make sure that your account is user and group. And also use chmod as above to remove the other permissions.\nFor entertainment you want to make an entertainment group that you and bethy are in. To do this run these 3 commands (I assume your username is ed)\nsudo groupadd entertain\nsudo usermod -a -G entertain ed\nsudo usermod -a -G entertain bethy\n\nSo assuming the entertainment partition is mounted in /media/Entertainment you can run:\nsudo chown ed:entertain /media/Entertainment -R\n\nAlso it is best to again use chmod to remove the other permissions.\nNow we want any file added to this directory to inherit the group so we setgid with\nsudo chmod g+s /media/Entertainment\n\nFinally we need to edit how new files get file permissions so the \"other\" permissions are off. To do this edit the file /etc/login.defs by finding the line starting with umask and replacing the number afterwards (probably 022) with 027.\nI think you need to log in and out again for your permissions to update.\nThat, I think, should have you ready to rock.\n", "Q: Linux commands to use Windows bootloader instead of Grub So, I can't boot into windows at the moment, and in order to fix this problem I need to access Advanced Options which I can do by pressing F8 in the windows boot loader.

Then restart Qt Creator as normal.\nqtcreator\n\nSee: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/appmenu-qt5/+bug/1307619\n\nA: The version of qtcreator package in all ubuntu flavors of 15.10 is built agianst qt 5.4  and you just installed qt 5.5 and I am not sure of the breakage. you might be able to see for yourself if you go to the help menu and select about Qt. I am pretty sure different version of Qt with the second version number is not really supported well so this may cause your problem as it is trying to display qt 5.5 when the qtcreator you have installed is qt 5.4. If you want to use qtcreator with qt5.5 you may have to  build it from source against qt 5.5 or find someone that has built it with qt5.5. Qt is a widget toolkit and as such it draws the program on the screen and you have tried to basically take qt 5.4 out of the hood and put qt 5.5 and expected it to just work. \nIf using qtcreator is more important to you than say new stuff in qt 5.5 you could reinstall the Qt 5.4 that is in the repos. However to properly do that more info on how you installed Qt 5.5 would be helpful. \n\nA: It's a desktop setting in Ubuntu. Go into settings/appearance/behavior and check the options for show the menu in the window's title bar and for always show menus. This fixed it for me - all my apps - QtCreator included - now behave correctly.\n\nA: Recently had similar problem on KDE Plasma. Turned out I had widget \"Global Menu\" in one of my panels.

The problem is that I don't know how to back up my Thunderbird account, I might lost all the contacts and my folders created. I am using POP3. What should I do to back up my email account. Thank you in advance\n\nA: Backup or copy the profile's directory to where you want to save it to (for backup) or where you want to copy it to for new usage.\nYou can find the exact profile folder by looking at your profiles.ini file.  It'll be the \"Path=\" parameter in the profiles.ini file.  Copy that folder to a new Thunderbird installation and edith the \"profiles.ini\" to point to it and you're all set with the same settings and content from your previous install.\nOn Windows 7 or Windows 10 you can find the profiles.ini file in %appdata%/Thunderbird.  Just type that in the Microsoft file browser.\nOn Ubuntu you will find the profiles.ini file in ~/.thunderbird.  You can type that path into the Ubuntu file browser to get there.\nThunderbird has a special argument to assist in changing and editing the profile to use.  Run this at the command prompt to see the facility:\n$ thunderbird -profilemanager\n\n", "Q: Can boot to Ubuntu, or Windows, but not both So I have a new computer and a new Ubuntu install on a partition (Inspiron 13 7000, intel i3, Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.10)\nIt works great..... Except for this really annoying little bug involving the boot-loader. I can't get Windows to show up in GRUB, I've tried about 20 different variations of a custom entry in 40_custom and all of them throw the error that the partition could not be found.\nEDIT: I've also tried running the boot repair tool to no avail.\nFor a while I was completely locked out of windows because of this. I eventually managed to get back onto the windows side by entering setup and disabling legacy boot and enabling \"safe boot\" (whatever that is?). Of course now, GRUB doesn't show up and I can only access windows. \nI can get back to Ubuntu by reversing those changes and rebooting, its just a pain to do every time I want to switch OS. On my old computer, Windows showed up in GRUB automatically and I could simply select the right OS at every boot. On that one I was using 14.04 which perhaps is the answer to the problem? I initially went for 14.04 but my wifi card wasn't recognized so someone on here suggested I switch to 15.10 which solved the wifi issue but then mucked up the bootloader situation.\nIs there any way to fix this?\nThank you!\n\nA: It sounds like you accidentally installed Ubuntu in CSM or \"Legacy BIOS\" mode.\nTo fix this, you're going to have to re-install GRUB from within Ubuntu.\nFirst, install boot-repair:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nSecondly, open boot-repair and go to the \"Advanced Options.\" Within that, go to \"GRUB Location.\"\nFrom within this view, check the Separate /boot/efi partition button. Finally, click Apply.\nNext, you must go back into the BIOS and disable Legacy Mode, but keep Secure Boot off.\nWhen you reboot, GRUB should load and Windows should be detected.\n(source)\n\nA: You can install boot-repair in your Ubuntu 15.10. Run in terminal :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nThen, open boot-repair, choose Recommended Repair.

I can't install AMD Catalyst 15.9 either (Install kernel headers using the command apt-get install linux-headers-3.19.0-31-generic.)\n\nA: First, let me point you at the Ubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf Release Notes.  These release notes have a section about AMD cards and fglrx under the section which I've quoted below:\n\nGraphics and Display\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*AMD's fglrx driver does not work with the current kernel (LP bug #1493888).

The open source radeon driver can be used as a temporary replacement until a fix is available.\n  \n\nThere are known issues with the driver.  However, we do not handle bug triage here on Ask Ubuntu, and any type of fix needs to be done by AMD and provided to Ubuntu developers who have access to the packages (which is NOT everyone).\nAll you can do is wait here for a while, until it's fixed.  In the interim, use the radeon driver package instead.\n", "Q: Dovecot won't stop running I installed dovecot and postfix on my laptop a while back for hands-on experience.

None of the input devices (screen, key/mouspad, stylus) appear to work when I load the live USB. I'd be willing to try my hand and creating something to support these devices, but I would need someone to point me towards reference material where I could teach myself about drivers.\n\nA: For me, those things are not running on my SP4 HD installation (with kernel 4.2.0-21 and SP3 drivers):\n\n\n*\n\n*Cover (Keyboard and Touchpad)\n\n*Hardware buttons\n\n*Stylus and any touch input\n\n\nBluetooth and Wifi are running fine. If you look around you find a few patches that bring the SP4 cover to work but you have to build your own kernel currently. In a few weeks all this things are hopefully included in the main kernel. So you better wait for this.\n\nA: Here was my solution, which worked using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Took me 1.5 days to figure out :-/\nI could not do this without a multi USB adapter. I needed at least 2 USB ports. Here's what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the multi USB adapter in.\n\n*Plug the wireless keyboard & mouse dongle.\n\n*Load Windows 10 and shrink the C drive so that you have enough room for a Ubuntu partition and a swap drive (note that Windows will prevent you from doing this, so you need to follow instructions here)\n\n*Create two new partitions: one for Ubuntu and one for swap - swap doesn't have to be huge. I use a couple of Gig, but I don't think you even need that to be honest.\n\n*When you turn on the SP4, hold down the + volume button until the UEFI screen appears.\n\n*Disable Secure Boot and TPM.\n\n*Make sure USB Storage appears at the top of the list in Boot config.\n\n*Boot up Windows, open a command prompt as Administrator and type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu yes and hit enter. This will make sure the Windows Boot menu appears on turning on the SP4 - note this also gives you many more boot options, so can be very useful.\n\n*Now put your Ubuntu Live USB in and reboot and install Ubuntu from the USB stick (your wifi/bluetooth USB and mouse will hopefully work - mine did but only with the multi USB adapter). Note that if \"Install alongside windows\" is missing, then click \"Something else\" instead. You need to assign ext4 root (/) partition, swap partition, and also select the Windows Boot Loader partition as the Ubuntu EFI partition. Do NOT format the EFI partition !!!\n\n\nWhen I rebooted, the Ubuntu GRUB2 loads up and gives you the choice to either load Ubuntu, or open the Windows Boot Loader.\nNote - it may not actually be necessary to enable the Windows Boot Loader menu, but it didn't work when disabled for 15.10.\nIf anything goes wrong you can always download an SP4 Windows 10 Recovery ISO from Microsoft's website, and there's always the recovery partition on the SP4.

Then I found this answer which leads me to This second solution. The second solution solved my problem. \nBut after some time I find my wifi is getting disconnected automatically, and if I disable and then enable internet after some time from the menu bar it works again. Now it has become practically impossible to use internet via wifi in Ubuntu. I found This bug and this Post, but neither of them has an answer.\n\nA: First, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. In some cases, auto B and G may also be helpful. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Change the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\nIf these changes do not help, please try:\nsudo -i\necho \"options rt2800pci nohwcrypt=Y\"  >  /etc/modprobe.d/rt2800pci.conf\nmodprobe -r rt2800pci && modprobe rt2800pci\nexit\n\nIf these changes are still not helpful, let's compile the newest version of the driver. Download this package to your desktop: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/2015/11/15/backports-20151115.tar.gz Right-click it and select 'Extract Here.' Now, back to the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential\ncd ~/Desktop/backports-20151115\nmake defconfig-wifi\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nReboot, unload ndiswrapper and tell us if there is any improvement.\nsudo modprobe -r ndiswrapper\nsudo modprobe rt2800pci\n\nIf these changes are helpful, remove ndiswrapper:\nsudo apt-get purge ndiswrapper-utils-1.9\nsudo apt-get purge ndiswrapper\n\nThe native driver rt2800pci may be blacklisted. Please check:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nIf it is, remove the line blacklist rt2800pci, save and close the text editor.\nAlso, you have compiled the driver for your currently running kernel only. When Update Manager installs a newer linux-image, after the requested reboot, recompile:\ncd ~/Desktop/backports-20151115\nmake clean\nmake defconfig-wifi\nmake\nsudo make install \n\nPlease retain the file and these instructions for that time.\n\nA: I had similar experiences with another Ralink network interface. The problem is Linux's wireless driver support, which is not very good. You can try a different kernel and you might be lucky, but there is no guarantee that it will fix the problem. I had best experience with Intel wifi cards, they seem to be more stable.\n", "Q: Move back files Tried to find out what was wrong with Unity, then I did this:\nmv backup_local/ .local/share/applications/ instead of mv backup_local/*.desktop .local/share/applications/.

Upgrade backages are mostly *.deb files stored in /var/cache/apt/archives/ ( but manually installed packages go there also )\n\n", "Q: Different between dual booting alongside window 10 and something else I want to dual boot ubuntu on preinstalled windows 10 but when i watch few videos on youtube I saw some are dual booting alongside windows and some are doing by manually partition(something else).\nwhat is different between alongside installation and by doing something else\n\nA: When you choose dual boot along-side of the windows linux is installed on the largest unallocated space \n whereas, choosing manually partition you can manage the partition size and then install on the partation of your choice. \nSee furhter desription\nhere\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu, you are asked to chose install along side, which is basically automatic way of installing ; you let the installer allocate swap ( the hard drive space used for extra working memory ) and how much hard drive space to use for Ubuntu. \nWith something else option you are in control of how you want to organize hard drive space. For example, I don't need swap for solid state drive, so I used something else option to create only main ( aka root ) partition where my OS resides, and no swap. Some users use it to create separate partitions for /home directory, which is same as Users folder on windows .\nIn short , if you don't plan doing anything fancy with your hard drive, you probably don't need something else option. \n", "Q: Unable to Install Netbeans 8.1 I am running the 64bit version of Ubuntu 14.04 desktop and when I run the netbeans installer (PHP version) I get the following error message:\nConfiguring the installer...\nSearching for JVM on the system...\nPreparing bundled JVM ...\nnetbeans-8.1-php-linux-x64.sh: 1: eval: /tmp/.nbi-4114443.tmp/jre-8u60-linux-x64.bin: Permission denied\nCannot prepare bundled JVM to run the installer.\nMost probably the bundled JVM is not compatible with the current platform.\nSee FAQ at http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqUnableToPrepareBundledJdk for more information.\n\nWhen I checked the wiki, it tells me:\nOn Debian-based 64bit distributions (such as Ubuntu) it is usually enough to install the ia32-libs package to successfully start the bundled 32bit installer. \n\nWhen I try running\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nI get the error:\nPackage ia32-libs is not available, but is referred to by another package.\nThis may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or\nis only available from another source\nHowever the following packages replace it:\n  lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0\n\nE: Package 'ia32-libs' has no installation candidate\n\nSo then I run \nsudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0\n\n... and then I execute the installer and get the same darn error message:\nConfiguring the installer...\nSearching for JVM on the system...\nPreparing bundled JVM ...\nnetbeans-8.1-php-linux-x64.sh: 1: eval: /tmp/.nbi-4114845.tmp/jre-8u60-linux-x64.bin: Permission denied\nCannot prepare bundled JVM to run the installer.\nMost probably the bundled JVM is not compatible with the current platform.\nSee FAQ at http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqUnableToPrepareBundledJdk for more information.\n\nWhat do I need to do in order to install netbeans 8.1 on Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit)?\nSystem State\nOutput of uname -a:\nLinux stuart-home 3.19.0-31-generic #36~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 8 10:21:08 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nOutput of java -version\nPicked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on\njava version \"1.8.0_66\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_66-b17)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.66-b17, mixed mode)\n\n\nUpdate 07-11-2015\nIve since tried installing Java 9 but that didn't work either.\n\nUpdate 08-11-2015\nAs a workaround, it appears that the full netbeans download works.

But as libssl0.9.8 is no longer available in the package repository of Ubuntu 15.10 and onwards, that explains why apt barfed that dependency error when you tried to install from spotify official repo as outlined on its Linux download page\nThe latest 32-bit and also 64-bit spotify-client however do use libssl1.00 now. As temporary solution for installing spotify until this repo issue is fixed, you'll have to download the deb binary manually. Go to this link on spotify repo. Then to install the downloaded deb, use dpkg -i <debfile>, followed by apt-get install -f to install need dependency if necessary\n\nEdit..\nIt seems that Spotify repo has silently moved to testing channel for a while now and all the active developement on Linux build is first pushed into testing repo, according to some post on Spotify forum. I think you can say stable channel now is more or less abandoned which explains the whole issue with outdated Packages index files though the debs are not. So now instead of using stable channel as outlined in the Linux installation instruction on Spotify official site, you should be using testing.

I am trying to implement a network system. That students can connect to it by the ssh command or Putty.\nIn the main computer I have ubuntu os. I want an admin to add a new students each time and give them exact amount of space.\nThe students can connect to the main computer through the wifi.\nmy purpose is:\nStudents can work with the Terminal of ubuntu even if they don't have this os on their own systems.\nand I want one of these users to be the admin so that it can delet the old users and add new ones.\nI have no idea where to begin so if you guys could just give me a hits that means a lot.  \n\nA: Linux is a multi-user OS, so there is no problem with allowing others to access.\nTo be able to use putty or connect from MacOS terminal students will need ssh client (included in all linux distributions as a standard and MacOS iirc as a ssh binary, or Windows ssh client, like Putty).\nNow, on your server you will need ssh server, install it by:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nIf you use ufw - unblosk ssh traffic to your machine:\nsudo ufw allow ssh\n\nNow just add users, for example by running:\nsudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/[username] -m [username]\n\nCreate Password for user:\nsudo passwd [username]\n\nNow, that is pretty basic setup, but your students are able to log in to their own accounts and work in shell.\nTo limit amount of space users can use, use quota application, but it's configuration might be slightly complicated at first glance (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-enable-user-and-group-quotas).\nRead also about ssh server configuration, as there are some options like allowing root user to log in that you might want to change (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring).\nFor user to have administrator privileges, use sudo (see, for example: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sudoers)\nRemember, that your students machines need to be on the same network for them to be able to connect to your computer (in this, simplest example).\n", "Q: How to select text for copy and paste in Chrome by keyboard not using the mouse? I have some online tutorial open in my Google chrome. It tells me to run some commands in a terminal.\nMy current workflow is to select the necessary parts via mouse, and insert the copied text via middle mouse click in a terminal.\nI want to to avoid using the mouse at most instances, so I want to highlight text on a web page by only using the keyboard instead. I want for the text to be automatically saved into the buffer similar to mouse selection, yet even then being able to ctr+c without selecting text with the mouse would be fine.\nIs there a mode in Chrome for that purpose?\n\nA: Use the arrow keys to navigate the page.\nTo highlight text on a page with a keyboard use Shift and a direction, up is up a line down is down a line. Left is left one character and right is right one character.\nCopy is Ctrl + C and paste is Ctrl + V.\nThe only way I could find to move the selection cursor is using find to highlight the first word of the text you want to copy, press Ctrl + F, type your word, to highlight it in the page and press ESC to leave find then use the Shift plus arrows to highlight the rest.\nFinally to swap from Chrome to a Terminal use Alt + Tab\n\nA: As I am a user of vimium, it turns out I had the capabilities already shipped with it even though I wasn't aware that it existed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Search the starting point by: /yourSeach\n\n*Press enter.\n\n*Enable visual mode via: v, and visual mode on a line basis via Shift + V\n\n*Select text by vim navigation keys, aka: h, j, k, l, b, e, w, $ (I especially like shift + w, as it goes to the end of the next word)\n\n*Yank via y\nYou now can switch the context and paste the text via Ctrl+V\nThere also seems to be a caret mode, yet as of yet I somtimes don't see the current place of the cursor, which is why I prefer the search-first approach as of now.\n\nA: There's an Google supported extension called Caret Browsing among other extensions to improve accessability.\nIt toggles via F7 like in Firefox.

What's the reason for Canonical officially supporting versions such as Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, etc. instead of supplying the environments as Ubuntu 'flavour' downloads?\nWhy doesn't Canonical simply offer downloads of Ubuntu with different desktop environments?\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Default (Unity)  \n\n*KDE  \n\n*LXDE\n\n*XFCE\n\n\nWhy not?\n\nA: I see three reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Community ownership of the projects - with a distinct vision\n\n*Having a unified \"look\" of desktop Ubuntu (that matches phone and tablet and TV Ubuntu) for marketing purposes\n\n*Canonical can focus its efforts on QA for one desktop environment versus multiple\nThe flavours are not simply Ubuntu with a different desktop environment. For instance, if you take an Ubuntu desktop installation and apt-get install lxde, you will have a very different computing environment than installing Lubuntu itself.\nFrom Lubuntu.me:\n\nLubuntu is designed to be fast and easy to use. It has lots of applications for every daily need, while keeping your system light and responsive, being it ideal not only for old computers and netbooks, but for newer computers too making them lightening [sic] fast.\n\nTo that end, Lubuntu includes a set of packages and applications to perform typical PC tasks (office applications, media players, photo viewing and editing, etc) that are typically lighter-weight in terms of RAM and CPU usage than comparable applications in Ubuntu. (Abiword vs LibreOffice Writer, for example.) The focus is on low overhead.\nIn that way, the vision of a flavour like Lubuntu is fundamentally different from the vision of the Ubuntu Desktop project. For instance, two of their marketing points are, as stated on Ubuntu.com's desktop page:\n\nComplete\nUbuntu comes with everything you need to run your organisation, school, home or enterprise. \n[...snip...]\nLooks great on the latest devices\nUbuntu is designed to work beautifully on the latest laptops, desktops and touch screen devices, it looks incredible on high resolution screens — and with touch screen enhancements and interface refinements including individual menu bars in each application window, it’s now even easier to use.\n\nIf Canonical wished, I suppose it would be possible to offer an LXDE spin, but if it contained the same packages and same amount of software, it would be far less usable on older hardware than Lubuntu is (which is part of the Lubuntu team's vision), and arguably take away from the unified, beautiful, modern experience that is important to Canonical's desktop marketing efforts.\nI don't work for Canonical, but I have been involved with the Lubuntu community, and that to me is the fundamental difference I see between the projects.\nFinally, as to quality: when I triage bug reports against LXDE packages, there are a number of unique and interesting bugs that happen when running LXDE on Ubuntu (apt-get install lxde on Ubuntu) vs. running Lubuntu. A lot of bugs that occur on Ubuntu with LXDE do not occur on Lubuntu. I'm not a developer, so I can't really help explain why, but for some reason the Lubuntu desktop is packaged and arranged in a way that makes LXDE work much better with Ubuntu than just installing the LXDE package.\n\nA: The main reason is due to the contributions the derivatives make back to Ubuntu (as a whole). \n\n...use Ubuntu as their foundation and contribute significantly towards the project\n\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/flavours\nThose contributions are a mixture of community support, bug fixing and development.\nDon't forget all the development, bug fixes, configuration for each flavour are all reusable (modular libs and components in particular) and installable in/from Ubuntu and all official derivatives as they share the same infrastructure.\n\nA: The most important reason is to offer freedom of choice for users. Tastes differ and so do needs.Everyone should have the ability to choose what he needs or what he likes in good quality. Supporting various flavours will provide Ubuntu's widely spreading among as many people as possible. \nHere you can see what kind of support a flavour gets after being recognized: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecognizedFlavors\nWithout these resources and services flavours would have difficulty in being provided in good quality to end users. \n", "Q: Shortcuts stop working on cyrillic layout after some amount of time When I boot my system - all shortcuts work well - no matter what layout is chosen.

It was from not having permission to read or list files in the directory (directories need x execute permission to list files), and I think it could've happened with a decrypt error too.\nI had some issues with permissions in mounted/decrypted files before. They seemed to reflect only the permissions of the encrypted file (EncFS man page calls it the \"rootdir\"), and changing the mounted/decrypted files didn't seem to work. Maybe the owner & permissions for the \"rootdir\" / encrypted files aren't correct? Try changing the \"rootdir\"/encrypted permissions so your user can access them (rwx?).\nI thought root should be able to read anything no matter what... but encfs doesn't need sudo to run, and I tried a test with a single encrypted folder secret and it's decrypted mountpoint open and the same thing happened: \n$ ls -go\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 80 Nov 11 00:14 open\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 80 Nov 11 00:14 secret\n\n$ sudo ls -go\nls: cannot access open: Permission denied\ntotal 0\nd????????? ?  ?            ? open\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 80 Nov 11 00:14 secret\n\nOr maybe it's not decrypting the files correctly. If you have a good backup of the data that would be great.\n\nI'm thinking the upgrade from 14.10 to 15.10 might be responsible. Sometimes using a newer version with old data doesn't always work well. \nThe encfs package versions I can find on http://packages.ubuntu.com/ are currently:\nin wily (15.10) is version 1.8.1-3\nin vivid (15.04) is version 1.7.4-5\nin 14.10 it's not on the webpage anymore, was probably 1.7.4...\nin trusty (14.04LTS) is version 1.7.4-2.4ubuntu2\nOr, the .encfs6.xml \"config file\" may have been corrupted somehow.

This in turn points to ftp.osuosl.org from the DNS lookups I just ran.  It also is 'working' from what I can tell.\nIt's possible your system is not able to reach those servers, either because there's network filtering somewhere along the lines that're blocking the access, or there's intermittent network issues, or your ISP is blocking access.  If all other repositories are working, then you'll have to debug connectivity between you and that repository server.\nIt looks to me though like that's the only repository giving you issues.

Now completely wiped my old Ubuntu installation and directly installed Ubuntu 15.10 from disc. After installing all updates I tried \nsudo apt-get install texmacs\n\nThe terminal said it was no longer available. Then I tried manually installing it with instructions on the official website, but after I was done, I still couldn't start it. I also tried uncommenting all repos in sources.list.\n\nA: Texmacs is no longer available in Ubuntu repos because it depends on Guile-1.8 which is considered deprecated by Debian (and hence not in the repos anymore). \nHowever TeXmacs is still being developed and current .deb packages for all recent Ubuntu versions are available at opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:slowphil:texmacs-devel which is more or less like a PPA, except it's not Ubuntu-exclusive.\nThese .deb files are far easier to install than the static package available at texmacs.org mentioned in chaskes' answer; they are also much more recent with many bug fixed. For instance input methods based on ibus work with the debs but are broken in the static package.\n\nA: The package is not available anymore, that's right. You can install the Vivid packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-enable the repositories in sources.list\n\n*Download, e.g. for 64-bit\ncd\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/t/texmacs-extra-fonts/texmacs-extra-fonts_0.2_all.deb\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/t/texmacs/texmacs-common_1.0.7.18-1_all.deb\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/t/texmacs/texmacs_1.0.7.18-1_amd64.deb\n\n\n*Install\nsudo dpkg -i texmacs*.deb\n\nPossibly there are some missing dependencies but that is no problem, just execute the command in the next step.\n\n\n*Install the missing dependencies\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n\nA: You can also download the current TeXmacs binary file . \nUnpack the zip file to a directory of your choice. Then follow the installation instructions, which just involve setting the proper paths:\nSet the environment variables.\nLet [installation directory] be the current directory,\nwhich contains this file.

I'm still a beginner at this so be easy and please be very clear. \nBefore I made the switch, I transfered all of my important files (about 8GB in total) to my tablet and every time I tried to just transfer them to my desktop, something went wrong and a few files don't get transfered. So I decided to transfer them wirelessly using Airdroid. I downloaded the files in a .zip format and extracted them to my desktop. No errors there until I tried to open the subfolders and it says I can't access them because either I don't have permission or access is denied. There's also a little lock icon on the folders, but I've noticed that even on the folders that don't have the the lock icon sometimes I can't access them. \nI've changed the Permissions on properties for some of the files but there are so many and I can't spend so much time.

I'm making progress with the basic interactions with images and containers - it looks promising.\nCurrently I am stuck on a problem connecting from the host to a service running in a local container.  This is my first time trying this.  I get a \"connection refused\" error.  More details below:\nuser@sparky1:~$ curl 10.0.3.49\ncurl: (7) Failed to connect to 10.0.3.49 port 80: Connection refused\nuser@sparky1:~$ \n\nThe host is Ubuntu Server 14.04 on my laptop - it's a new install and is pretty plain-vanila.  I let the system do all of the configuration (including the lxcbr0 bridge) and haven't changed any of the out-of-the-box defaults.\nI'm running a container based on a CentOSv6 image.  The container is started and inside I am running a web server.  From within the container I can connect to its local web server on port 80 just fine (by running \"curl hostname\").  It connects on the loopback IP 127.0.0.1  I get a valid response from the local web server from within the container.  Yay.\nA successful response (even though it's a 403 reponse):\n[root@wc1 ~]# curl wc1\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\n<html><head>\n<title>403 Forbidden</title>\n</head><body>\n<h1>Forbidden</h1>\n<p>You don't have permission to access /\non this server.</p>\n<hr>\n<address>IBM_HTTP_Server at wc1 Port 80</address>\n</body></html>\n[root@wc1 ~]#\n\nIf I try connecting via the IP on the bridge, either from within the container or from the host then I get the mentioned \"connection refused\" error.\nSo, I'm trying to figure out what it will take to allow connections from the host to the the web server running in the container.  I have spent a few hours googling and have not found the answer (or been too dense to recognize it).\nThe firewall is disabled (\"ufw status\" says so).  What am I missing?  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I solved my own problem. I initially recalled (assumed.  sigh) that I had specified the IP when issuing the 'curl' command from within the container, but in fact I had specified the hostname.  Once I noticed that I had in fact specified the hostname, and that the hostanme resolved to the loopback, i figured out my problem.\nIn my apache httpd.conf, the Listen di, which I hadn't notice resolved to the loopback device and not the IP on the lxcbr0 bridge. rective specified the hostname.  The httpd.conf file was auto-generated by a vendor tool so I didn't think about it at first.  Once I changed the Listen directive to listen on the correct IP (10.0.3.49) everything worked.\n", "Q: I think I've been hacked, what can I do? I have recently installed Ubuntu 15.xx and I belive my machine has been hacked.\nMy computer's name has been changed to imatransvestite, and although I can still change passwords, I cannot use sudo without this error: sudo: unable to resolve host imatransvestite\nWhat can I do to fix tis, and what should I do?\n\nA: If you have been hacked, or even think you have been hacked, then there is no easy way to determine what all has been done to your system.\nIn your case, we know that, at the very least, your system's hostname has been changed.  However, a backdoor for the hacker could have been installed.  Malware could have been installed.  Your system could be configured to use poisoned DNS.  You could have malware that's downloading very very NSFW illegal things to your computer.  There is literally an unending list of things your computer could be doing as a result of being hacked..\nYour best solution is to \"Nuke It From Orbit\"TM, or in laymans terms, \"Completely reinstall from scratch\".\nIn addition to reinstalling your system from scratch, take the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change all your passwords on websites you use.  It's possible your passwords are now in the hands of the hacker, so time to use different ones.\n\n*Set up a firewall.  After you have a cleanly installed system, run the following commands, to make sure that a firewall is installed and enabled.  This will help secure your system:\n\nsudo apt-get install ufw\nsudo ufw enable\n\n*Only use networks and websites which you trust to not be malicious.  Unsecured wireless networks are a hacker's paradise, and untrusted sites can have malware or other privacy-violating things on them that can lead to you being hacked.\n\n*Use different passwords for every login, and use a password manager to manage/remember them.  Make sure a password manager's password doesn't match another password you use, and make sure all your passwords are different.  This applies for your user account too going forward.  This is one of the most effective methods, but it's a little more difficult.\n\n\nA: If you've been hacked, then your number one priority should be to determine the attack vector -- otherwise it will just end up happening again.  Before wiping the system and reinstalling everything, back up any relevant logs and review them.  If your attacker did not wipe the logs, then you should have a pretty fair idea of how they got in and what your first steps should be when you do reinstall your system.\n", "Q: Curious how a server works I am currently a high school student who has developed a few iPhone apps that have connected to Parse.com, so I have a little idea of how a... \"server\" (pre-made) works. But, I do know that's not how a server is built from the ground up and there is more to that.\nMy question is, how does a server actually work? Is it basically an operating system? What's the difference between running a server with Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server?\nAnd my biggest, biggest question that I can't seem to find the answer to is: where do you put the code you write? How would I replicate Parse.com on a real server with a database and iPhone API's?\nTalking high-level conceptual, if I wanted to write an extremely basic app that communicated with a server, how would I do so? For example, let's say I have an iPhone or web app that asked for the users name. When it get's the users name, I want to send it to the server, and respond back \"Hello, [user's name]!\" (I know I could do this very easily within Swift or Javascript on the actual app, but for demo purposes.) How would I go about doing that with server set up, connecting to the server, getting a response back in the app, and where to put that code on the server that would respond back to the app?\nI apologize if this is the wrong place or a basic question, but I cannot seem to find the key answers that I have been itching to have answered anywhere online. I'm dying to know the concepts. I'm a very curious and independent learned, but just don't know conceptually where to start.\nThank you so much in advance for your help. Again, I am so curious to know and find out about this.\nAlex, a curious high school student.\n\nA: \nhow does a server actually work? \n\nWorkflow for a webserver as an example: \n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop (Ubuntu desktop installation)\n\n\n*\n\n*Browser\n\n\n*\n\n*URL contains a domain and parameters\n\n*Waits till results arrives and shows them\n\n\n\n*Computer that has this domain (Ubuntu server installation)\n\n\n*\n\n*Webserver (Apache)\n\n\n*\n\n*Program that gets parameters and executes it.

Could be in combination with a database (MySQL), a coding language (Python, Perl, Javascript).\n\n*Send results to desktop\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it basically an operating system? \n\nEhm. No. Ubuntu is the operating system. What makes it a server is the fact you install server software onto it and set it up. Like hosting a website you do with Apache (= webserver). In combination you can also add or have a database (MySQL; databaseserver) or a mailsystem (=mailserver).\n\nWhat's the difference between running a server with Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server?\n\nNone whatsoever. You can remove the \"desktop\" component and have a \"server\". You can use a \"desktop\" to install server software like a webserver, printserver, databaseserver, mailserver, template server and so on and call it a server. \n\nHow would I go about doing that with server set up\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu has a setup that installs it all and creates a basic setup for you using your desktop machine. sudo apt-get install lampserver^ will install the Linux version for Apache, Mysql, Perl and set it up for you such that you can point your browser to http://localhost and it will show a website with \"ItWorks!\" on it.  \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want this to work remotely you need to purchase a domain, receive an IP adress (and a name for that IP) and then you can use that IP or that name instead of localhost. \n\n\nA: \nWhat's the difference between running a server with Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server? \n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq\n\nSince 12.04, there is no difference in kernel between Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server since Linux-image-server is merged into Linux-image-generic.\n\nHowever, Ubuntu Server wouldn't have the unnecessary desktop elements making it more efficient to serve a website or database.\n\nIs it basically an operating system?\n\nIt is not an operating system. Though, it is built on the top of an operating system. An operating system is the pre-requisite of making a server(obviously). And there is no compulsion on the OS. It can be Windows or Ubuntu. Whatever you want to use.\n\nMy question is, how does a server actually work?\n\nYou will get a better understanding of how a server works if you make your own desktop machine a server. For Ubuntu, the following command will work like a charm and you will end up with a server. \nsudo apt-get install lamp-server^\n\nYou can host a website(HTTP), serve a database(MYSQL) or even files(FTP).

You can add another data partition in either NTFS or e.g. FAT32 that are visible to Windows and place files there that should be accessible from both systems.\nHowever if you don't want that Windows is able to affect any Ubuntu data, just leave its default configuration with all file systems as ext4. Windows will see that there are partitions, but not detect any valid file systems in them and therefore can't access any data.\nThis does not prevent it from accessing the raw partitions though. You or a clever malware can still format the Ubuntu partitions from Windows or delete and/or repartition them, which all destroys the Ubuntu installation. \nWindows also can (and automatically does e.g. on system upgrades) overwrite the disk's boot record. That means your computer will not boot into GRUB any more, but into the default Windows loader or anything else.

I'm fairly new to Ubuntu, and I was getting the \"packages held back\" message on an apt-get upgrade. I came across several answers that mentioned using dist-upgrade instead, but some of them warned that this could be dangerous, or at least perform more of an upgrade than you might want.\nI read the man page and found the \"--with-new-pkgs\" flag for apt-get upgrade, and in my case it did the trick: it installed some new packages, with a prompt informing me what packages would be installed and asking me if I wanted to continue.\nIt seems to me like this is may be a safer option than doing dist-upgrade -- am I correct? Using dist-upgrade could remove packages, whereas when I ran upgrade --with-new-pkgs, it simply informed of a package that could be removed and told me to run 'apt-get autoremove' to remove it.\n\nA: Yes, it is safer to some extent.\nThe core purpose of upgrade --with-new-pkgs and dist-upgrade is to upgrade a package to the latest version and satisfy dependencies in the process.\ndist-upgrade takes the ambitious route of installing new packages and/or removing installed packages to satisfy dependencies. This could in turn remove some package(s) that is needed by another application, that's why it is not recommended always.\nOn the other hand, upgrade will just try to upgrade the package without installing/removing anything from the system. upgrade --with-new-pkgs adds the installing new package capability to upgrade i.e. to satisfy dependency it can install new package(s) but will not remove anything.\nSo we can put it in a simple expression (the initial apt-get is omitted):\nupgrade --with-new-pkgs == dist-upgrade - removal_capability\n\nNote that while upgrading kernel you will still need dist-upgrade.\nAlso autoremove removes the packages that were installed as dependencies (marked as auto) and no longer needed.\n", "Q: How do I get my distro update dialog back?

As expected.\nIf I scroll upwards, hoping to restore opacity, the view zooms in. If I zoom in to maximum magnification, the opacity-control resumes, and I can restore opacity to my windows.\nI would ideally like to be able to do both, but I don't want to zoom in to restore opacity to my windows. Is that possible? If so, how?\nSOLVED: Turns out it is the horizontal scroll on window decorator that causes the transparency change. I had foolishly turned that on and scrolled with a touchpad, inevitably scolling hotizontally on accident.\n\nA: Change the key used to grab the windows to something else.\nIn Xubuntu 14.04, open Settings Manager from application menu, or run xfce4-settings-manager in terminal. Then, follow the instructions below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Window Manager Tweak > Accessibility\n\n*In the first line, look for this option^ Key used to grab and move windows: with a drop-down box, then click and change from the default Alt to other key of choice in the list.\n\n*Finally, click Close to finish.\n\nI would suggest to use Shift key, because this key is rarely used for two-key combination shortcuts. This will avoid any conflicting shortcuts.\nAnother choice is Super key, which is what I'm using now after feeling uncomfortable with the Shift key.\nConsider this: If Control key is used for the option^ (step 2), this will cause Ctrl+Mouse click to be disabled. The shortcut is useful to open a link in background tab in Firefox and other web browsers.\nFinal result: Changing the key to Shift will trigger the zoom function by pressing Shift+Mouse scroll keys and Alt+Mouse scroll on Xfwm title bar will trigger transparency as usual. This was tested in Xubuntu 14.04; however, these functions are inseparable and seem to rely on the same key in newer releases.\n", "Q: Run script on start-up before specific network card is initialized I have a system with multiple network cards.

If you're looking for something you'll most likely find answers you can literally copy and paste. I, for one, did not have to really code my own stuff to make Ubuntu a great experience.\n2) Yes! Only thing to note is (and I learned this the hard way):\nMake sure to FIRST install Windows and Ubuntu AFTERWARDS. Otherwise your Ubuntu-Bootloader will get overwritten and it's a little more work to get it back.\nBut when first installing Windows and Ubuntu afterwards, you're good to go :)\n3) On your Windows partition you'll absolutely be able to.\nOn your Ubuntu partition there's a free alternative to Office, called LibreOffice. It has something similar to Word, Excel and Powerpoint.\nOther than that there's a program called Wine that'll allow you to run certain Windows executables as if you were running a Windows machine.\n4) Depends. I study Informatics and it's been a great experience all over the place.\nBeing a designer you'll probably lack of the really good programs though. So it comes down to your studies I guess.\n5) I can't really answer this, but I didn't encounter any Viruses like I did with Windows yet (3 years of Ubuntu until now).\n6) Gotta pass here, I really don't know out of the box. I assume there are some though.\n7) Nope. You can choose to keep your stuff. Remember point 2) though (!).\n8) You can download it, but you won't be able to run it. You'll need something to boot off, that is an SD-Card (painfully slow if you have USB 3.0 for example), an USB drive or, as you said, a DVD drive.\n9) That depends on your connection. The 64-bit .iso file is 1GB of a file, so really not that much. Should be done within a few minutes :)\n10) I don't think it is.

The second line is meant to export the new LS_COLORS. Pretty straightforward, but after the command is executed, echo $LS_COLORS shows that LS_COLORS has not actually been changed. Does dircolors need some extra permissions or something to modify LS_COLORS? I can modify it myself using export LS_COLORS=$LS_COLORS:<stuff to add>, but escaping the semicolons in the format flags is a pain, and dircolors is supposed to do this automatically. What am I missing?\nEDIT: As @Alexandre Beaulieu's answer points out, dircolors does not execute anything, it just outputs strings that can be executed as commands using eval, or placed in a script. Another problem I encountered was with the default .bashrc file in Ubuntu 14.04. It was looking for a file in my home directory called .dircolors, instead of .dir_colors, as I've seen in every documentation, to pass to dircolors. Editing that to look for .dir_colors, or renaming .dir_colors to .dircolors will make the settings be applied automatically at login.\n\nA: dircolors doesn't execute the commands itself, it just outputs the commands to be executed. Passing them to eval will work.\nTry this:\neval $(dircolors ~/.dir_colors)\n\n", "Q: Where to save files and install software in a full install usb I have a full install Ubuntu 14.04 on my pen drive. As far as I know,it's supposed to be a full install because I did it using a live dvd and moreover,there is no option to install from the usb pen drive,which was not the case for live or persistent pen drive,from which one is allowed to install Ubuntu. Now,when I boot from my usb drive,and get to the unity desktop,I wonder if there is anything similar to the 'My Computer' as in windows,from where I can view the available space,and save files,documents,images,songs etc. And how can I install softwares in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Sorry, I am not sure of your actual questions either.\nThis might help you to understand what you have done.\nWhen you install an OS, files are added to a disk.\nIn Microsoft, this would be the C: drive.\nLinux does not have drive letters to define the hardware.\nLinux connects hardware to a directory.\nMicrosoft has created something called 'My Computer' which all disk drives appear to be connected to in Windows manager.\nLinux has a file system that is made up of one or more disks connected together in one file system tree. The top of the file system is known as the root of the file system and is denoted as '/'.\nI do not remember if Ubuntu 14 is a single install ISO or if there is a live desktop and live server version ISO. Ubuntu 15.x has 2 downloads, a desktop and a server version.\nAssuming you copied the install ISO using the 'dd' command, what you did was essentially duplicate all the files that represent the installation (on the C: drive of a windows host, all the partitions on a Linux host) onto a single device (USB) drive, equivalent to the D: drive in a windows world.\nYou normally have to force the motherboard to boot off a USB device or it will default to using the local hard drive, the C: drive in windows.\nIf you were to boot this device by rebooting your host, it would bring up a Ubuntu console (server version) or a graphical desktop (desktop version).\nIf you try to view this USB stick on windows, you will get nothing. Windows does not have a driver that will view the format of this USB stick (ext4 is my guess). Hence you cannot see it from Windows.\nIf you boot this USB device on your host, you will bring up a console or desktop view.\nOn the desktop view, there should be a file manager icon or option in the menu that you can start. This will give you access to a memory resident file system. \nHere is where it gets weird. The USB device is mounted as the underlying file system and memory is used for the disk space you save files to.\nPut another USB device in, windows format or linux, and then copy your files to these devices.\nLinux hosts can usually mount and use Windows formatted devices but not the other way around.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 crashes with kernel 4.3 I'm buying a new Skylake CPU and motherboard and I read that to get proper support for Skylake, I need Linux kernel 4.3. I tried installing it from the .deb packages in http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.3-wily/ . Installation worked and I got to the login screen with the new kernel without problems. However, when I tried to login, Ubuntu immediately crashed, showing briefly some colourful mess on the screen and then threw me back to the login screen. I tried several times and always the same result.\nSadly I didn't keep the dmesg log from that session and I don't want to try installing the new kernel again because it took me some time to recover from it (somehow the crash completely messed my Unity configuration and I had to delete my ~/.config/dconf folder to get into working state again even with the old kernel).

My answer is only about the SMART screenshot, which shows no problems. Your second screenshot, however, does show some problems.\nThere are no failures or warnings in that screenshot.  According to SMART, your drive is fine and healthy.\nThis doesn't mean the drive won't fail, it just means SMART didn't detect any problems and is reporting your drive is perfectly healthy.\nThat read-out is very hard to read and understandably confusing.  It contains words such as \"pre-fail\" and \"old age\" which sound scary, and at least one other person here has misinterpreted it.  I'd be willing to bet that a lot of perfectly healthy drives have been discarded by people who saw a perfectly healthy SMART report and misinterpreted it.\nThe important part is there is nothing in the FAILED column for any of these tests (on your screenshot, the FAILED column is wrapping to the next line, making it hard to read), and none of the values in the VALUE column have dropped down to the THRES value or below where you would need to be warned.\nA little on how to interpret these results\nSMART records a number of statistics about the drive.  Some statistics keep track of warnings signs that the drive might be failing, while others just keep track of normal operation, such as the number of times the drive has turned on.\nFor each statistic there is a VALUE and WORST column, which indicate the current and worse value of that statistic.  It's important to note that bigger is better here.  Even if the statistic is something like \"read failure rate\", a value of 200 is GOOD, whereas lower values are BAD.  That is, the value you see there is not the raw error rate but a number representing how GOOD your value is.\nAnother thing to note is that the scale doesn't matter.  Some statistics might have a maximum of 1, some a maximum of 100, some 200, or some other values.  So, if some statistic has a current value of 1 you cannot infer that it's almost a fail, because 1 might be the maximum possible value for that statistic.\nAll that matters is that the current and worst value is still greater than the value in the THRES column.  The THRES indicates how far the value of that statistic would need to drop to represent a warning.\nEven if one of the statistics drops down to the THRES level or below, it still doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.  Some statistics might be entirely informative, rather than indicating a problem.  In this read-out, the TYPE column indicates what hitting the threshold in that statistic would mean.  If the type is \"Old_age\", then hitting the threshold in that statistic would indicate that the drive is old, not necessarily that there is any problem with it.  An old drive may be more likely to fail than a new one, so this may be of some importance, but it doesn't indicate an actual problem other than age.  If the type is \"Pre-fail\", on the other hand, hitting the threshold in this statistic would indicate that there is a problem with the drive - that something has started to fail and it should be replaced.\nLuckily you have not reached the threshold in any of the statistics you have shown.  Your drive appears perfectly healthy.\nIn this question I only addressed your questions about the SMART status. Your second screenshot shows errors that are unrelated to SMART.  That screenshot shows read errors, which may indicate problems with the drive that SMART has not flagged.  Please follow Terrence's suggestion in the comments to check bad blocks.\n\nA: Looking at the errors that you are getting from your hard drive there, it appears as though your hard drive may be failing.  The second image that you posted is showing I/O sectors that are not readable.\nRunning sudo badblocks -s /dev/sda will check the entire surface of your hard drive to see if every thing is OK.  Sectors that cannot be read will appear as failures.  If you notice that more and more are appearing then your hard drive is failing.  \nYou can perform a low-level format or Zero Fill on your drive to try to reclaim those sectors.  The format is written to the hard drive sector by sector.  Any bad sectors that cannot be written to should be marked as bad and it will move on.  Once the sector is marked bad the OS will no longer write to those sectors thus no longer causing data corruption to happen.  \nA low-level format or Zero Fill will erase all data on the drive.  It is recommended to back up all your data from the drive before performing this step.\nTo perform a the format, boot to Live media, like a LiveCD or LiveUSB, and from a terminal type in the following:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda\n\nThis is assuming that your hard drive was detected as /dev/sda.  To determine what your hard drive is, type in the following from a terminal window:\nfdisk -l\n\nIt will show some data like this\nDisk /dev/sda: 256.1 GB, 256060514304 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 31130 cylinders, total 500118192 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x000a0278\n\nAfter the format and if you are still experiencing those same failures or new ones, the drive is dying and should be replaced.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Upgrading from 14.04.2 to 14.04.3 LTS This is strange, when i try to upgrade to 14.04.3 LTS from 14.04.2, it doesn't seem to upgrade with sudo apt-get upgrade or dist-upgrade or do-release-upgrade.\nHow else could/should I do it?\nI've tried:\nalvas@ubi:~$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\nalvas@ubi:~$ do-release-upgrade\nChecking for a new Ubuntu release\nNo new release found\n\nalvas@ubi:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade\nReading package lists...

I could find the package in Muon but after installing it I can't find it in the application menu. Also I can't start it by running \"kcron\" in the console.\nI read KCron is included in kdeadmin package but I can not find that package using apt-get or Muon.\nSo how can I use KCron? Is there an alternative?\n\nA: Ok, using Kubuntu 15.04 KCron must be started using the command line:\nkdesudo kcmshell4 kcm_cron\n\nThe corresponding package is kde-config-cron.\nUsing 15.10 it seems there is an entry in the system settings but I couldn't test this yet.\n", "Q: How do I use a Microsoft Designer Mouse with Ubuntu 15.10 This mouse is a \"low-power bluetooth\" device. Supposedly this uses HOGP instead of HID.\nI have found responses that say you need bluez 5.x. Well Ubuntu 15.10 has bluez 5.35 but it doesn't work. When you try to make a connection, it identifies the mouse as \"any device\" and won't connect. I have a Surface Pro3 running either the distributed kernel for Ubuntu 15.10 or a more useful kernel that I have built myself based on a patched linux 4.3--the mouse behavior is the same for either. THe hardware is by Marvell. The mouse works perfectly when used in the Windows 8.1 partition.\n\nA: The solution was described here in comment #9: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/1510570\nIn few words:\n\n\n*\n\n*Comment out the only non-commented line in file /lib/udev/rules.d/50-bluetooth-hci-auto-poweron.rules\n\n*Uncomment lines [Policy] and AutoEnable=true (originaly there is =false, change it) in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Search and pair your mouse. If cursor is not moving, try pairing again.\n\n\nA: Just wanted to add to the Andrey's Answer. If you disable the rule, the bluetooth is not active on the login screen. \nEven though in launchapd they say 5.35 removes the problem, I still experienced it. Anyway if you are like me using BT keyboard to log in, you might want to do as Andrey say and then reboot and remove the comment in the /lib/udev/rules.d/50-bluetooth-hci-auto-poweron.rules then reboot and the mouse is still connected.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 15.10 (on Lenovo yoga 13) I was able to get Microsoft Design mouse working directly around the first couple weeks since the 15.10 release..  I think I was issuing some commands directly into the bluetoothctl utility to discover/pair the mouse instead of usual desktop GUI (I was having issue with my bluetooth driver that had a bug).  The steps were these as I recall:\nscan on\n(now put mouse in pairing mode, wait for it to show up in console)\npair (the mouse's mac address)\nconnect (the same mac address)\n\nI've used Design mouse for many weeks now - it works fine, but have a different issue - if I don't use the mouse for like 10 minutes then it become 'turned off'.  I can turn it back on from the desktop bluetooth menu and it'd work fine as long as I keep it active.  Alternatively, you can turn it on from bluetoothctl command utility once it goes to sleep, e.g.\nconnect (the mac address for your mouse)\n\nYou can write a bash script and run it from a keyboard shortcut, but still I wish it'd get fixed soon.\np.s. This works without hacking the udev rules and bluez conf file.\n\nA: I've tried everything written before without success; but I was able to get the Microsoft Designer mouse working using blueman. After installed I needed to play with it a little bit, but it works!. Remember after restarting you have to initiate blueman and just click on the Desiner Mouse option to connect it properly.\nBTW, using blueman the mouse doesn't stop every 10 minutes; but now I have some problems on WIFI speed :(\n\nA: I similar thread on a MacOS forum solved this for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove all other BT devices\n\n*pair the designer mouse: it should now work\n\n*re-add the other BT devices\n\n\nBasically the designer mouse will only work if it's the first BT device.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/6987906?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: Just want to add another success story.  NOTHING worked until I removed all Bluetooth devices, rebooted, used Setup new device utility in Blueman.  Works perfect now.  No issues.\nWorks on 16.04LTS using same meathod as well\n\nA: As others have said, workarounds can be found here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/1510570\nThere seems to be several ways and several combinations to work around the problem in the page described.\nAdding to Andrey's answer, comment #27 on the page describes the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Comment out the only non-commented line in /lib/udev/rules.d/50-bluetooth-hci-auto-poweron.rules. You may also replace it completely with the line below.\n\n*Add ACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"bluetooth\", KERNEL==\"hci[0-9]*\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"host\", RUN+=\"/bin/hciconfig %k up\".\nMany thanks to all involved. Helped me a bunch !\n\nA: Okay. I have searched every where and finally did the same thing as what was described in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/1510570\nafter you follow those steps, be sure to open the bluetooth manager, select the mouse and the keyboard, and delete those connections. take the batteries out of both and put them back in to hard reset the devices, then turn them both on in pairing mode (intermittent flashing, 1 sec on, 1 sec off), and search for new devices on the bluetooth manager. While the device is still in pairing mode with the flashing light, select it and press the setup button. If you wait too long the devices won't be in pairing mode anymore and you might have to start over to get it to work.\n", "Q: How to tweak/customize GTK theme? I installed Ubuntu with Unity desktop environment and then I installed GTK Theme, which is called Numix Dark. I really like the theme, but I would love to change some colors of the theme. I want to change the accent color from red to blue and change folders color from yellow to blue.\nIf someone could tell me how to do that would be really grateful. Do I have to only just change some text in a file in order to do that ?\nAfter some Googling I found a thread that explains how to change the accent color from red to blue, but it didn't change all the colors from red to blue. And I still don't know how to make the folders blue.\nAfter following  the steps on I changed the accent color from red to blue,like so:\n\nBut I couldn't change the controls that minimize, resize and close a window from red to blue. See this image to see what I'm talking about.\n \nIf would be really happy if you could tell me how to change window control colors from red to blue when hovered. Thank you.\n\nA: Remember when you were installing the GTK+ themes how you were hit with a .tar file. If you extract that file, you will get a magical folder of files. If you read the comments in each of the file, and if you know a little bit of the language, then you can easily start tweaking the themes...\nFor your purpose of just changing colors, it shouldn't be that hard to change the color, but again, I don't know which theme package you are dealing with, so just burn through the code and learn!\nIf on the other hand, you were looking for a GUI tool which you could use, there is none.\n\nA: There is not standard method for this and it is a lengthy process\nYou have to make changes in CSS files of theme which can be found it /usr/share/themes/<theme name>/.\nNow here look for the colour you want to change, most probably it will be defined at the beginning of CSS file. You might wanna use a colour picker for this Agave is good.\nAfter you found the colour to replace, run the following command\ncd /usr/share/themes/<theme name>/\nfind . -type f | xargs sed -i 's/abc/xyz/g'\n\nin above command replace abc with the colour name you dont want to see, and replce xyz with the colour you would like to see.  \nIt would replace all occurrence of old colour in all files\n", "Q: Is there a way to backup my hotkeys (on Xubuntu)?

See below.\nNote that you are using nc with erroneous arguments, but it still seems to work. From man nc:\n\n-l        Used to specify that nc should listen for an incoming connection rather than initiate a connection to a remote host.  It is\n  an error to use\n               this option in conjunction with the -p, -s, or -z options.\n\n\nWhat causes the http_write_request: write error: Invalid argument?\nInvalid argument is a stringified version of POSIX error code EINVAL.\nThe error code was returned from the write libc function/kernel syscall which was indirectly called by the http_write_request function of httptunnel client. EINVAL means:\n\nfd is attached to an object which is unsuitable for writing; or the\n  file was opened with the O_DIRECT flag, and either the address\n  specified in buf, the value specified in count, or the current file\n  offset is not suitably aligned.\n\nBefore write() is called, the socket is configured with various options using the setsockopt libc function / kernel syscall. One of these options is SO_SNDLOWAT. You can read about what that is supposed to do here. Note that:\n\nSO_SNDLOWAT is not changeable on Linux (setsockopt(2) fails with the\n  error ENOPROTOOPT)\n\nso it's a useless call to make on linux in the first place, at least as of 2015.\n\nAfter running htc with strace, I noticed an inconsistency between the code and the syscall arguments reported by strace. The code in the tunnel_out_setsockopts function is trying to set the SO_SNDLOWAT option, but strace reports setsockopt(5, SOL_TCP, TCP_REPAIR, [1], 4) = 0. Take a closer look at the socket man page where SO_SNDLOWAT is listed as an option, and note the following:\n\nThe socket options listed below can be set by using setsockopt(2) and\n  read with getsockopt(2) with the socket level set to SOL_SOCKET for\n  all sockets.\n\ntunnel_out_setsockopts does not use SOL_SOCKET for the SO_SNDLOWAT option; it uses the result of another function (get_proto_number) instead. This is a bug. This may be due to an inconsistency with prior versions of the kernel or libc API, but I suspect that is unlikely.\nUnfortunately, fixing this bug by replacing the socket level argument with SOL_SOCKET does not result in a usable tunnel. The write call which was previously failing now succeeds, but the program fails about a second later with ETIMEDOUT on a read call.\nThere is another function tunnel_in_setsockopts which attempts to set SO_RCVLOWAT with the output of get_proto_numer instead of SOL_SOCKET. This is another bug.\nFixing these two causes the tunnel to work properly.\nServer\nnc -l 10000\nsudo hts -F localhost:10000 81\nClient\nhtc -F 7777 localhost:81\ntelnet localhost 7777\nThis bug was already reported against Ubuntu 14.04 here. I suggest you mark it as affecting you.

Really need easy to install/uninstall way to get any distro of Linux on my computer, dual boot uninstalling seems like a hassle.\n~Ciao!\n~I NEED A WAY TO INSTALL AND EASILY UNINSTALL, WITHIN 5-10 MINUTES, MAKING A RECOVERY DISK WOULD BE OKAY BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES AND/OR DATA WIPES, ETC~\n\nA: Wubi is no longer supported unfortunately. The key take away from that Wikipedia article is this:\nWubi (Windows-based Ubuntu Installer) was an official Windows-based free software installer for Ubuntu, from 2008 until 2015,[2] which allowed the installation of Ubuntu to a single file within an existing Windows partition.\nDual-booting is actually really fairly simple these days. Dual booting is, indeed, your only realistic option. Because each situation may be a little different, I won't expand on it at this time - unless you've a specific question. Instead, I'll refer you to this link where you can get more information. \nI don't normally like to link to sites and not include any additional information, but that's the official Ubuntu site and is unlikely to change and is likely to be updated as new information is available. \nInstead, let me just make sure to do the following - don't skip anything:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data.\n\n*Read the instructions carefully before doing anything.\n\n*Read the instructions a second time and ask specific questions if you need help.\n\n*Follow the instructions carefully and know what you're doing before you do it.\n\n*The reason you want to try Linux is because you want something different. This means learning something new. Do not expect it to be the same and do not expect it to be easy (though it really is, just be patient with yourself).\n\n*Be patient with yourself - go slow.\n\n*If you make mistakes then don't worry, you backed up your data in Step 1.\n\n*Before you even try to restore data, if you do make a mistake, it's probably a small and easy to fix problem. \n\n*There's an excellent community online who will help you if you help us to help you and you're willing to put some work into it.\n\n\nSo, my suggestion, burn an ISO to DVD or use unetbootin to make a USB thumbdrive to boot to. If you make a USB drive then make sure you format the disk with FAT32 to ensure that it boots. Give Linux a try in a Live OS situation, be patient, and see if you actually want to make the switch or go through with the dual boot process. There are a lot of choices and one of them might be the right choice for you. This will also be a good indicator of the compatibility of your hardware. While you're booted to the Live USB/DVD disk, you needn't worry about it doing anything to your Windows install. You can learn, use, and even install software. (By default, it will sit in RAM unless you've specifically set aside space with unetbootin to retain persistent data.)\nHere is a link to unetbootin and it's self-evident with its use. There's a version for Windows, OS X, and Linux. You'll be wanting the Linux version. You can have it download ISOs for you or you can download the ISO yourself and then have it use the downloaded file to make the disk.\n", "Q: how can I disable ubuntu system startup code display? how can I disable ubuntu system startup code display?

I have Intel/Amd hybrid graphics. The AMD GPU that I have is the radeon HD 6490m. My laptop is a HP probook 4530s(if you need further specifications you can google them). Up until now I have used the proprietarym driver fglrx-updates together with the fglrx-pxpress package. After the upgrade to 15.10, my install has just hanged on the boot sequence. Also my  hard drive is encrypted with LLVM. I made sure I used the right password. All the kernels do boot from recovery. Also the old kernel from 15.04 does boot normally with functioning drivers. I have run apt-get update and apt-get upgrade which installed a new kernel which also hangs on boot. I have run fsck as well. \nSo I have heard that the AMD drivers do not support the latest kernels, however on the Q&A on chat one of the Canonical engineers told me it is fixed. Well after the issues today I have investigated the bug and there is a fix, however it is still in willy proposed.\nSo my questions are:\n1)How do I activate the 'proposed' repositories, update only the fglrx drivers, maybe fglrx-pxpress as well, and then disable the 'proposed' repositories?\n2)What are the potential problems if I just continue using the old kernel?\nHow do I modify Grub to use the old kernel as the default(until a new one comes and potentially fixes the issue)?\nPlease try to answer until night which is in approximately 7 hours from now on for me. Because at night I will consider 'nuking' my install and doing a fresh install. I would prefer not to do this however, because I have many valuable configs and applications installed at the moment. Like a nice working i3wm config. Many virtual machines as well. oh yeah and many steam games, it would be a big hassle to redownload those games again, because my internet connection is currently very weak and it barely goes above 200Kbps.\nI am currently busy and away from home so I won't be able to post any logs at least for 2-4 hours.\nAnyways thank you.\n\nA: I have activated the wily proposed repositories, upgraded fglrx-updates-core, fglrx-amdccle-updates, fglrx-updates and linux-firmware-nonfree.\nAfter that I did:\nsudo amdconfig --adapter=all --initial\nAnd now it works, thank you guys anyways!\n", "Q: How to view bootups extending 1 month I am trying to view a log of previous bootups.

As you are using an NVidia GPU, the CPU's built-in Intel iGPU is probably disabled or at the very least has no displays connected to it.\nThe Intel chipset has a link between the audio chip and the iGPU in order to allow the iGPU's HDMI/DisplayPort display connectors to output the audio produced by the audio chip. The system firmware metadata tells the HD Audio driver to expect this link. But since the iGPU is not being used, the driver's attempt to activate this link will fail and the error message failed to add i915 component master will result. \nThe rest of the audio chip will work just fine, you just won't be getting audio over HDMI/DisplayPort connectors that are connected to the iGPU (which you probably aren't using anyway). The message would be of any significance only if you're trying to use the iGPU in addition to the NVidia GPU in a multi-display set-up, and want to output audio over HDMI or DisplayPort to the speakers of a display that is connected to the iGPU.\nYour NVidia GPU probably has a second HD-Audio sound chip integrated with it, which will output audio on HDMI/DisplayPort connectors attached to the NVidia GPU. If you're using Pulseaudio on top of the usual ALSA audio drivers, it can handle this pretty much transparently so you can mix and match audio outputs as you like. If you are using plain ALSA audio drivers and want to output audio over HDMI or DisplayPort, you will need to tell the audio-producing software to use the second HD-Audio chip instead of the default one.\nIf you're interested, the function that outputs this message is snd_hdac_i915_init() in file .../sound/hda/hdac_i9i5.c within the Linux kernel source code package.\n\nA: Setting IGPU Multi-Monitor to Enabled in the Graphics section of my BIOS settings fixed it for me.\nThe cause of this is the NVidia custom driver. It conflicts somehow with the video card integrated on my Motherboard.\n\nA: Although this is an old question, I recently encountered and solved a similar issue while trying to get HDMI audio to work with the built-in video ports on an Intel Z370-based system (AsRock Z370M-ITX/ac motherboard with i3-8100). This system has built-in video only and no GPU card.\nThe error I saw on bootup was:\nsnd_hda_intel 0000:00:1f.3: failed to add i915 component master (-19)\n\nFurther down I saw the following error twice:\nsnd_hda_codec_hdmi hdaudioC0D2: No i915 binding for Intel HDMI/DP codec\n\nThe embedded i915 video appeared to work fine but no sound was being routed to the HDMI ports regardless of what ALSA or PulseAudio settings I used.\n-19 is the kernel error code ENODEV (\"no such device\"), which appears several times in the snd_hda_intel driver code.\nIn order to support sound output over HDMI, video drivers for Linux register an \"audio component\" for the sound card driver (in my case Intel HD Audio a.k.a. snd_hda_intel) to connect to. Once this connection is made, the sound hardware can produce an audio stream for the GPU to multiplex onto the HDMI cable.\nIn my case, the i915 graphics driver was not registering this audio component with the kernel. This failure can happen at various stages of loading and initializing the i915 graphics driver. For me, it was due to the lack of availability of Kernel Mode Setting (KMS). The i915 driver requires KMS to operate properly and will not initialize and register the required audio components if it is not enabled.\nI fixed this by adding the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/modesetting.conf:\noptions i915 modeset=1\n", "Q: trouble compiling qpdf 5.1.3 I'm trying to install qpdf 5.1.3.

I have tried different repos but I am always getting 404 not found.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is to compile it yourself. Here's how I managed to get it working on Ubuntu 15.10 Wily. \n~/$ sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools git \n~/$ sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libjack-dev libbluetooth-dev pyqt4-dev-tools\n~/$ cd Downloads\n~/Downloads/$ git clone https://github.com/falkTX/qtsixa.git\n~/Downloads/$ cd qtsixa\n~/Downloads/qtsixa/$ make\n~/Downloads/qtsixa/$ sudo make install\n\nAfter that it should be installed, and you can use the qtsixa program to connect to your device via bluetooth. TO do so, first connect your six axis controller to your computer via usb, and then enter the command below\n~/$ sudo sixpair\n\nAfter that unplug the usb from the controller and run the next command to connect to your six axis controller via bluetooth.\n~/$ sixad --start\n\nYou will be prompted to press the Playstation button on your controller, which you actually need to hold down for a few seconds. Finally if everything worked, your controller should rumble for a second and you should be good to go.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 15.10/16.04 and Linux Mint 18, you can still use the QtSixA PPA, but specifying \"vivid\" as the Ubuntu version (15.04), since that was the last officially supported version. To do so, execute the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/falk-t-j/qtsixa/ubuntu vivid main\"\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 736E4F0B\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install sixad\n\nNote: as far as I can tell, the GUI based application is no longer useful, at least to detect and connect controllers through Bluetooth. Because of that, you need to use the command line-based applications, i.e. sixad and sixpair\nEdit: Apparently and according to my tests, sixad starts automatically at boot, but doesn't work at all when that happens, having to stop it an re-start it to make it to work. To prevent sixad from being started at boot, you have to execute:\nsudo sistemctl disable sixad\n\nand, when you're going to use it, execute:\nsudo sixad -s\n\nof course, all the above is because QTSixA is no longer supported. The PS3 and PS4 controllers are supposed to work natively in Linux, but I still prefer to use it instead of the native support. I haven't be able to connect my PS3 controllers natively, and when I use QTSixA, I can do other things like specify the Bluetooth MAC address to be paired.\nI think I will mail the developer to know if it's possible for him to resume the support. I believe that applying only small modifications, the project could work properly out-of-the-box. And, even without doing anything, the PPA could still work.\n\nA: Run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:falk-t-j/qtsixa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qtsixa\n\nConnect with your USB : sixpair\nDisconnect sixaxis from USB\n    sixad -s\nPress the PS button to connect via bluetooth.\nSource \n\nA: Recent add on when compiling from source:\n\n\n*\n\n*The only repo that allowed me to connect two controllers at the same time was the fork of RetroPie: https://github.com/RetroPie/sixad\n\n*I experienced the problem that even when pairing went smooth, I got no data at /dev/input/js0. I could only solve that by using another Bluetooth dongle.\n\n\nOne more thing: Some tutorials write \"Press PS key on the controller to connect\". But I had to press and hold the key for 1-2 seconds.\nHope that helps if you experience issues.\n\nA: Okay, I just got QtSixA working in Wily. You can download the .deb files from the links at http://qtsixa.sourceforge.net/ . Specifically http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtsixa/ . \nOpen the zip file and you'll find sixad_1.2.1-0ubuntu0+karmic1_.deb and qtsixa_1.2.1-0ubuntu0+karmic1_all.deb . According to the Readme, install the sixad .deb file for your architecture (my desktop uses the amd64 one, yours probably does too).  Just double-click that file from the Archive Manager and it'll open up in the Ubuntu Software Center where you can install it.\nNext do the same with qtsixa_1.2.1-0ubuntu0+karmic1_all.deb.\nI've got my PS3 controller plugged in over USB and when I start QtSixA it has options for configuring the controller. When I hit the round PS button in the middle it starts Steam.

I'll need my windows because gaming is a big hobby of mine. Linux will be used for simulations since I'm a physicist going in the astrophysics direction. Obviously I want to choose my partitions right but I'm missing some information and can use some advice.\nI have an SSD of 225 GB, of which 101 GB is currently in use. This is were windows is installed and this is were my more CPU intensive games are installed since an SSD would make them go faster right?\nNow I also have a HDD of 931 GB of which only 227 GB is used. This is were I store files, less CPU intensive programs etc.\nFirst question: If I would install linux on my SSD, will I be able to access my HDD?\nSecond question: Were do you recommend that I install linux? Simulations can run for a long time on full CPU (on one or more cores) and therefore, should I install linux on my SSD? Or can I install linux on my HDD, and let the programs run on my SSD (by installing C++ on my SSD or something)? I think the main problem is not storage but that both my games (windows) and simulations (linux) are CPU intensive.\n\nA: \nIf I would install linux on my SSD, will I be able to access my HDD?\n\nYes, it would. It would be mounted and you may interact normally with the harddrive like you would with an USB drive :). You may need to install the filesystem (like NTFS) that the harddrive uses. (but I think it comes with ubuntu)\nNormal hard drives, If I am correct, are quite good at writing large blocks of data. Starting up applications & OS'ses can be quite intensive also in having to read large amounts of different files. That is an area where a SSD shines. booting linux fast is awesome. \nBy the way, programs do not run on a hard drive, they may load from the harddrive onto the RAM, from where the data is utilized to perform a task. The bottle neck of the harddrive is only the loading. Afterwards, when data is generated in theory you could have a bottleneck at the writing to the HD.\nOn the installtion onto a different drive, read this:\nHow to install applications to a separate hdd?\n\nA: You can access all partitions from Ubuntu, no matter where you install it.\nNote that you should place /boot and /usr (included in / if not specified separately) on the SSD because that speeds up boot time and program loading time.\nYou usually want to place your personal data onto the HDD, because it's written more often (writing cycles wear SSDs out) and that space is cheaper. Make sure swap is on the HDD (many write cycles - bad for SSDs) and you have optimized the mount parameters of the SSD partitions to reduce disk writing (e.g. set noatime and some others).\nOther than that, if your program runs on 100% CPU, that has nothing to do with slow disks - the opposite is true: 100% CPU means that the machine is busy with calculating anything and therefore not waiting for any IO like disk read. Get e.g. indicator-multiload and set it up to show you at least CPU and disk access graphs in the Unity panel. That way you can see when any disk is the bottleneck.\n", "Q: limit eclipse from taking over the RAM I'm using Eclipse in Ubuntu 14.04 for scientific stuff and my code consumes a lot of RAM. When I run my code in Eclipse, I see in System Monitor that the RAM usage goes up to almost 100% and at the same moments the OS gets very unresponsive (for example, to open a terminal will take more than a minute). Is there a way to limit the amount of RAM used by eclipse so the OS will remain always responsive?\nThanks!\n\nA: When you run an application in eclipse, it creates a separate thread in the OS. The RAM usage of that thread cannot be controlled by eclipse.\nOne way to avoid your system from crashing is to increase the swap partition size. Even in this case the system gets very sluggish but does not crash.\nThere are other ways to control the ram usage of an application, say kill the program when the usage goes beyond a certain value. If you set such hard limits on memory usage, then you might run into some unpredictable behaviour/crashes. See the links below that talk about limiting RAM usage.\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/44985/limit-memory-usage-for-a-single-linux-process\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/26860822/how-limit-memory-usage-for-a-single-linux-process-and-not-kill-the-process\nI would recommend trying to optimize your code to make it use less ram or think of some way to dump the data to hard disk and read it when required instead of retaining it in RAM. Even better is to increase the RAM!\n\nA: Here is a Perl script for exactly this problem. \n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe timeout script is a resource monitoring program for limiting time and memory consumption of black-boxed processes under Linux. It runs a command you specify in the command line and watches for its memory and time consumption, interrupting the process if it goes out of the limits, and notifying the user with the preset message.\nThe killer feature of this script (and, actually, the reason why it appeared) is that it not only watches the process spawned directly, but also keeps track of its subsequently forked children. You may choose if the scope of the watched processes is constrained by process group or by the process tree.\n\nSource\n", "Q: Unable to reduce Grub boot delay I have a Dell Laptop running single OS Ubuntu Mate 15.10 & GRUB on single 320GB HDD, partitioned as / & /home.

Grub ignores timeouts of zero and resets the value to 10 instead. To \"trick\" Grub pass the value 0.0 which when tested by Grub is not equal to 0.\nSetting timeout to zero\nIn my /etc/default/grub I have these relevant lines setup:\n#GRUB_DEFAULT=0 # Rather than option #1, we'll always default to last boot choice.\nGRUB_DEFAULT=saved\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0.0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0.0\n\nI've used the values 0.0 without double quotes to reflect how numeric values are used.\nNotice the first line is commented out. This means grub no longer defaults to the first menu option (in my case Kernel 4.9.21) but rather the last option booted with (in my case Kernel 4.4.0-72-generic from the Advanced Options Menu)\nThe second and third lines ensure you always boot to the same option last chosen.\nChanging the boot option when no menu appears\nA better method is to reduce timeout and provide option to force your menu to appear. This method is described here: How can I get my GRUB menu to be hidden, AND have the shift or esc keys show the hidden GRUB menu at boot time\n\nA: Search in /boot/grub/grub.conf for the string:\nset timeout=10\n\nIf you find it, surrounding lines might help you figure out what is the problem.\nNote from editor : Preferably don't edit the /boot/grub/grub.conf manually as it will be automatically overwritten every now and then.\n", "Q: Command cd stoped to work in Ubuntu 13.04 On a regular basis I change to Desktop using the command cd in a Terminal.

How would you count every occurrence of a term in all files in the current directory? - and subdirectories(?)\nI've read that to do this you would use grep; what is the exact command?\nAlso, is it possible to the above with some other command?\n\nA: grep -Rc [term] * will do that. The -R flag means you want to recursively search the current directory and all of its subdirectories. The * is a file selector meaning: all files. The -c flag makes grep output only the number of occurrences. However, if the word occurs multiple times on a single line, it is counted only once.\nFrom man grep:\n  -r, --recursive\n          Read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on the command line.\n          This is equivalent to the -d recurse option.\n\n   -R, --dereference-recursive\n          Read all files under each directory, recursively.

The script needs sudo privileges so it should be called by the root crontab.\nsudo crontab -e\nwill do that. If that doesn't work, there is something wrong with the default editor, or with the file /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root.

The clicking area (where I put my thumb) and the navigation area (where my index finger is) is all the same, there's no separate button for clicking. When I use my index to navigate it is all working fine but when I use my thumb to click, the cursor gets stuck and doesn't move. That is, I cannot move the cursor when my thumb is on the touchpad. It's quite annoying to use index finger to both click and navigate, I wonder how I could fix this.\n\nA: The trackpad drivers support multi touch actions--two finger scrolling, pinch actions, etc.  As soon as your thumb touches the pad, the system is looking for one of those motions, instead of the normal pointer movement.\nCheck out your trackpad settings and see what you can change to try and find setting you like.  Most trackpads will accept a tap or doubletap on the pad as the matching mouse click where ever the pointer is; you don't actually have to use the buttons at the bottom of the pad.

I am running a mid 2010 mac pro (8 core Xeon E5620, 16gb RAM, ATI Radeon HD5870), Triple booting through rEFInd boot manager to OS X/Win 10/Ubuntu 15.10. All was working perfect with 15.04 until i upgraded to 15.10. Let me start with what normally happens and then I'll get into the problem.\nWhat NORMALLY Happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*I press the power button and I hear that awful apple chime.\n\n*Screen goes to light gray for a second (apple's version of a bios I guess)\n\n*Skips the Apple Splash and goes strait into the rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*From here, I can select which OS to boot up and I select Ubuntu (the non-grub option because I disabled grub to have a smoother boot)\n\n*OS loads fine.\n\n\nBefore a few days ago, everything worked out perfect whenever I would boot Ubuntu 15.04, even if I booted from Grub. I went ahead and did the upgrade to 15.10 when the option became available to me. Once it finished the upgrade process and had to reboot, that's where the problem started.\nWhat Happens Now:\n\n\n*\n\n*I press the Power button and I hear that awful apple chime.\n\n*Screen goes to light gray for a second.\n\n*Screen goes black for a little bit as it skips the rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*The Ubuntu purple color quickly fills the screen and the splash logo appears.\n\n*The little dots below  the logo slowly all turn orange.\n\n*Then nothing happens (I even let it sit there for 8 hours once).\n\n\nI have tried so many things but it seems like keyboard commands don't want to work. It's a good thing that I installed Ubuntu to it's own drive because in order to get to the boot manager, I have to pull the drive completely. Anybody have any input other than formatting? I would prefer to NOT lose all of my files and settings on the drive.\n\nA: No help needed now that I figured out my own answer but this may be a good answer for anyone else looking.\nIt's as simple as rebooting to the target disk utility (holding alt) at startup, and once in OS X, rebless the startup disk to target rEFInd.\nOnce you have blessed the EFI location and booted to rEFInd boot manager, find the proper startup option that works for you. It may take a few tries, but that's about all it takes to work.\n", "Q: How To Start VNC Session With Gnome Desktop?

I run df -h and get this as output:\nhttp://imgur.com/0IohTyy \nI open up the Gparted partitioner to see this:  \nhttp://imgur.com/luWBLdb\nThe question is, how can I allocate those 30GB to sda1 such that I can work and generate files in my root directory without running out of space? \nThanks in advance\n\nA: That's a fairly normal problem to run into. What I would do is temporarily delete the swap partition and \"extended partition\". Then gparted can use the un-allocated space to add to the first partition.\nFirst, close whatever it is you have running that needs 20gb swap space. (I'm curious as to what that is)\nThen, you have to turn swap off:\nsudo swapoff -a\n\n(Yes, gparted has a \"swapoff\" feature, but I've never trusted it, could just be me)\nOnce swap is off, start gparted and delete the swap partition and \"extended partition\". When those are deleted, you can right click on /dev/sda1 and select \"resize/move\". Take up all but the space you need for swap, then create a new partition for swap, and once created right click and select \"Format to\" and select linux-swap. No need for the \"extended partition\" part of the process.\nOnce there, you need to turn swap back on. On my test system, \"swapon -a\" didn't work, so:\nsudo swapon /dev/sda2\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Why did Ubuntu source repository key signature fail with security warning?

I am thinking about changing my Ubuntu to Mint, as I have heard that it is faster and a little more stable than Ubuntu(Running 14.04, and some issues happen with loading and closing apps). I'm finding guides here and there, but since tings change from version to version, I don't want to screw this up. I would prefer to have it go as painlessly as possible, but also to load/run as many of my current apps as possible.\nAs I understand it, Mint is basically a distribution of Ubuntu, so I was wondering if the directions I found for migrating a laptop form one Ubuntu install to another would work.\nThey basically tell me to use Synaptic Package Manager to save the \"markings\", and then to copy these folders (except using my user name, of course):\n/home/aaron/.config  \n/home/aaron/.gconf  \n/home/aaron/.gnome2  \n/home/aaron/.gnome2_private  \n/home/aaron/.local  \n/home/aaron/.mozilla  \n\nThere are a few things I want to save, such as music, downloads and pictures, but besides that, can I pretty much follow the same instructions and have a full, clean install of Mint, since(As I understand it) they are almost the same OS?\nOne of the guides wanted me to copy everything in /home, which is like 100 GB... \nThanks for any suggestions, I just don't want to hose anything by using outdated tips, or I would have just used the closed post from a few years back as my guide.\n\nA: Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. \nMain Desktop Environments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu -> Unity\n\n*Linux Mint -> Cinnamon\nThat means that some of your configuration files may not work correctly, and do not overwrite any system/user file that will affect how the system work. Unless you are sure its ok to modify.\nThe best thing you can do is to copy your files using this system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file manager\n\n*Browse to the /home/user directory \n\n*Copy (don't move!) all the files from Downloads to /home/user2/Downloads \n\n*Check you did a good job.  \n\n*Now delete /home/user/Downloads\n\n*Go back to step 3 and repeat for Documents, Videos, ...\n\n\nAnd write somewhere a list with the programs that you have installed. And if you installed them manually take a note where you find it.\nIf you have modified any files, like .bashrc, then remember to copy the changes you made.\nLinux Mint has already installed configuration files and it is not the same as Ubuntu's.\n\nA: Please do not follow old guides. \n\nas I have heard that it is faster and a little more stable than Ubuntu\n\nSays who? I doubt it. Ok, Mint might use different default software but if that is the case and there is a bug in the software we use you can install those versions in Ubuntu too. Libreoffice, Firefox will be the same versions, with the same amount of stability.\nYou might like the official Ubuntu MATE. That is the official version based on the old Gnome2. \n\nAs I understand it, Mint is basically a distribution of Ubuntu,\n\nNo. It is an unofficial copy of Ubuntu where someone changed some of the code to make it their own. We do not support unofficial releases by the way. \n\nThey basically tell me to use Synaptic Package Manager\n\nThat piece of software has been obsolete for about 3 years or so. That link (did not click it ;) is probably from before 2012. Please do not use old guides. Focus on guides that are at least about the latest LTS (ie. in this case 14.04). Those tend to be correct for at least up to the next LTS.\n\nOne of the guides wanted me to copy everything in /Home, which is like 100 GB...\n\nThe best advice anyone can give: make a backup when messing with partitions, operating system installing or re-installing. Or in general: make sure files that are irreplaceable are on a restorable backup.\nFor this purpose my files are on a different partition (/discworld) I mount (and do not format) during a fresh install and I edit \n$ more .config/user-dirs.dirs \n# This file is written by xdg-user-dirs-update\n# If you want to change or add directories, just edit the line you're\n# interested in. All local changes will be retained on the next run\n# Format is XDG_xxx_DIR=\"$HOME/yyy\", where yyy is a shell-escaped\n# homedir-relative path, or XDG_xxx_DIR=\"/yyy\", where /yyy is an\n# absolute path. No other format is supported.\n# \nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"/discworld/Desktop\"\nXDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Downloads\"\nXDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=\"$HOME/\"\nXDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR=\"$HOME/\"\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\nXDG_MUSIC_DIR=\"$HOME/\"\nXDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$HOME/Pictures\"\nXDG_VIDEOS_DIR=\"$HOME/\"\n\nSo my Desktop points to that directory (it holds all my video's I tend to watch).\n\nCurrently the method for OFFICIAL releases when you need to re-install another OS is to NOT format /home/ if on a different partition or to choose the \"preserve my /home\" when installing another OS. That will work but you might need to clean up your /home afterwards due to config settings not used in the new OS.\nThe 1st and 2nd option in the image below have a comment stating that the current personal documents will be kept and not removed. Where the 2nd option will end up with a dual boot of 2 operating systems. This would be my choice: install the 2nd OS next to the 1st one, move files over to the new one and when happy delete the 1st OS. That is always possible with any 2 operating systems:\n\nMore info on the wiki.\nBut your assumption is most likely wrong: Ubuntu will not be slower or less stable. If you want a stable Ubuntu stick with the LTS and skip the in-between releases. 14.04 was rock solid for me. \n", "Q: How can i fix my Terminal login issue?

I'm wanting to use an Ubuntu Server to host a backup service of some kind to back up customer files that are located on Windows computers at an off-site location. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated on how this could be done.\n\nA: You can use rsync for that. There is a Windows version of rsync called cwRsync. It is based on cygwin.\nYou can install cwRsync on your Windows boxes and then rsync the data to your Ubuntu machine. I've used rsync for that when I migrated a server from Linux to Windows and had to copy a few GB of data from one machine to the other. \nHere is an example how to do it.\nIf you create a batch file for the backup, you can then run it automatically using Event Scheduler in Windows.\n\nA: You could use a simple rsync (cwRsync as mentioned by NZB) to sync the client data to your server. \nOn top of that I would let the server make daily snapshots of the synced data. If your client messes up the data, your live rsync copy is probably also screwed up.

After trying all suggestions from @Chil and @Dav see comments below (the @ sign signals them I've responded in some way to the question right? I still have the same problem.  \nI can \"see\" wireless networks but I can't connect.  I have fresh results to the all in one wireless script at >http://paste.ubuntu.com/13206822>, perhaps someone can make sense of this for me and free me from the tripping hazard clinging to my laptop and dragging across the living room floor, down the hall and into the common room.  Thanks, Desi\nThank you David Foerster for your review of my post and recommendation to review, \"How do I get my Lenovo T61 to connect to a wireless network?\" The solution for that issue is possibly restricted to Ubuntu 11.04 & 11.10 depending, I suppose, on the accuracy of the wording in that post, please correct me if otherwise. I did, in any event, try the recommendation but it did solve my problem. \nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04, I installed with the Internal Network Adapter Boot disabled in the BIOS.  USB's didn't work until I enabled the Internal Network Adapter.  Wireless has never worked but did identify available wireless networks.  Wired Connection works just fine.  \nI have tried for several hours over several days to load the drivers for the \"Intel Pro/Wireless 4965 AG or AGN Kedron\" wireless controller.  (I'm new) Additionally when I installed Ubuntu I accidentally didn't select \"allowing for proprietary drivers\"  \nThe additional drivers tab,(System Settings/Software & Updates/) is empty, the search comes up negative.  I have since installed Ubuntu-extras thinking that would help.  I discovered the iwlagn Driver on the Intel site and thought that my solution.  I tried to remove the existing iwl4965 Driver and was only partially successful.  \nI was not confident I found the correct info on how to install the Driver recommended by Intel-they suggested adding the drivers directly to (libraries?)  I need help cleaning up the mess I've made and installing the proper driver so I can finally have freedom from my Ethernet tether.  \nI would also like to undo the installation \"error/choice\" when I selected \"no proprietary\" drivers - if necessary. Here is some info based on what others have been advised to provide.  \nScratch that I followed the recommendation the popped up as I tried to submit my question to run the Wired/Wireless all in One script.  I'll will remove most of what I had intended as it is all replaced and more at:http://paste.ubuntu.com/13141481/\nI hope you can help.\ndesi@desi-HP-Compaq-8510p:~$ cat /etc/lsb-release; uname -a\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\"\nLinux desi-HP-Compaq-8510p 3.19.0-32-generic #37~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 22 09:41:40 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\ndesi@desi-HP-Compaq-8510p:~$ lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 net\n00:19.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Intel Corporation 82566MM Gigabit Network Connection [8086:1049] (rev 03)\nSubsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device [103c:30c5]\nKernel driver in use: e1000e\n\n10:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 4965 AG or AGN [Kedron] Network Connection [8086:4229] (rev 61)\nSubsystem: Intel Corporation Device [8086:1000]\n\nThe following is why I believe I only partially uninstalled the wireless driver....\ndesi@desi-HP-Compaq-8510p:~$ cat /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n# /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n# iwlwifi will dyamically load either iwldvm or iwlmvm depending on the\n# microcode file installed on the system.

Can it be undone?\n\nA: First of all, the installation of firmware-b43-installer is inconsequential. It will do no harm and needn't be undone.\nSecond, the correct driver, iwl4965 is blacklisted, preventing it from loading on boot. Please open a terminal and do:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nUse nano, kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Remove the very last line which now reads: blacklist iwl4965. Proofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, the contents of the file you quoted, /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf, appear correct and are, in any case, not relevant to your troubles.\nWe see several attempts and failures to connect to your access point. Please carefully check the password. For example, ChiliPepper is not the same as chilipepper. Second,  check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 \ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.  Of course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Change the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\nIf these changes do not help, please try:\nsudo -i\necho \"options iwl4965 11n_disable=1\"  >  /etc/modprobe.d/iwl4965.conf\nexit\n\nReboot and tell us if there is any improvement.\nEDIT: Network Manager will default to the usually faster and more secure ethernet if it is available. I notice that, when you ran the wireless_script, ethernet was connected. As we attempt to troubleshoot wireless, please be certain that the ethernet is detached.\nWe don't know much about why the wireless will not connect. Please look for clues here:\ncat /var/log/syslog | grep -i network | tail -n25\n\nPost the result here and give us the link: http://paste.ubuntu.com\nLet's try to compile the very latest driver.

I am trying to rename a lot of music files. The files contain spaces and capitals and whatnot and I want to replace the spaces with underscores and remove all capital letters. Is there a way to do that? I have seen changing extensions and multiple file names that are almost identical save for a few letters or numbers changed but nothing like what I need.\n\nA: A small python script will do the renaming recursively:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\ndirectory = sys.argv[1]\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n    for f in files:\n        new_f = root+\"/\"+f.replace(\" \", \"_\").lower()\n        f = root+\"/\"+f\n        if f != new_f:\n            shutil.move(f, new_f)\n\nwhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*lower() will lower all possible capitals .\n\n*replace(\" \", \"_\") will replace spaces by underscores.\n\n*if f != new_f will only rename the files if it is actually needed.\n\n*shutil.move(f, new_f) will actually rename the file.\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file\n\n*Save it as rename.py\n\n*Run it with the targeted directory as argument:\npython3 /path/to/rename.py <directory>\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*Use quotes if the targeted directory includes spaces.\n\n*Mind that you will run into name clashes if the renamed file name already exists.\n\n\nIn case of possible name clashes\n(If you already started renaming manually for example) Use the version below. \n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\ndirectory = sys.argv[1]\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n    for f in files:\n        renamed = f.replace(\" \", \"_\").lower() ;new_f = root+\"/\"+renamed\n        old_f = root+\"/\"+f\n        if old_f != new_f:\n            n = 1\n            while os.path.exists(new_f):\n                new_f = root+\"/dupe_\"+str(n)+\"_\"+renamed\n                n = n+1\n            shutil.move(old_f, new_f)\n\nIt will renane:\n\ninto:\n\n\n\n\nEDIT\nThe script above will rename files. From a comment, I understand you'd like to rename the folders likewise. With just a few lines, that can be done:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\ndirectory = sys.argv[1]\n\ndef name_edit(item, root):\n    renamed = item.replace(\" \", \"_\").lower() ;new_item = root+\"/\"+renamed\n    old_item = root+\"/\"+item\n    if old_item != new_item:\n        n = 1\n        while os.path.exists(new_item):\n            new_item = root+\"/dupe_\"+str(n)+\"_\"+renamed\n            n = n+1\n        shutil.move(old_item, new_item)\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n    for item in files:\n        name_edit(item, root)\n    for item in dirs:\n        name_edit(item, root)\n\nExplanation\nIn the second script, the way files were renamed is converted to a function, to prevent writing the same code twice (running it on both files/folders). Subsequently, the script first renames the files, then the folders recursively:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\ndirectory = sys.argv[1]\n\ndef name_edit(item, root):\n    # in one command, both replace spaces and lower {possible} capitals\n    renamed = item.replace(\" \", \"_\").lower()\n    # combine directory and (new) file- or folder name\n    new_item = root+\"/\"+renamed\n    # combine directory and (old) file- or folder name\n    old_item = root+\"/\"+item\n    # if the name was changed, check for possible existing dupes\n    # and rename until the name is unique\n    if old_item != new_item:\n        n = 1\n        while os.path.exists(new_item):\n            new_item = root+\"/dupe_\"+str(n)+\"_\"+renamed\n            n = n+1\n        # if the file or folder name was changed, apply the change\n        shutil.move(old_item, new_item)\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n    # use os.walk() to find files and folders recursively\n    for item in files:\n        name_edit(item, root)\n    for item in dirs:\n        name_edit(item, root)\n\n", "Q: What did change in RDP access between 14.04 and 15.10?

The reason is that appmenu made use of dbusmenu which has been deprecated by Canonical. Gnome now uses a new standard, qmenumodel.\nThus appmenu will need to be rewritten using qmenumodel to comply with the GNOME standard. You can see the relevant KDE bug report here and KDE forum discussion here.\nMaybe you should have researched a bit more: the above are the first pages that Google shows when searching \"appmenu qt plasma5\".\n\nA: While it was true in the past this wasn't ported.  It is now working in the staging version of KDE, version 5.9.  You can read more about it here.\nhttp://fasterland.net/activate-global-menu-kde-plasma-5-9.html\n\nIf you have KDE backports ppa or KDE Neon you should eventually get this version.\nYou can add those ppa's easily like this.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIf you want to add the source yourself check out the launchpad.\nhttps://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/backports\n", "Q: Why does my xdotool key command not work? I'm trying to run this command:\nxdotool key ctrl+super+d\n\nIt is supposed to toggle-show desktop, but it won't work. When I press the keys myself it works though.\n\nA: The correct command is:\nxdotool key Control_L+Super_L+d\n\nTo find the correct key- mentions, use xev: In a terminal window, run the command xev + Return, then type the key you'd like to use in the xdotool command. The output will be like: \nKeyPress event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x260, subw 0x0, time 64862215, (-177,259), root:(1325,592),\n    state 0x10, keycode 133 (keysym 0xffeb, Super_L), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nwhere the information you are looking for is in the section:\n(keysym 0xffeb, Super_L)\n\nAlternatively, you can use the keysym -value:\nxdotool key Control_L+0xffeb+d\n\nor the key code:\nxdotool key Control_L+133+d\n\nAdditional information\nAs mentioned by @DKBose:\non 14.04, the command, used by OP should work, as mentioned in man xdotool on 14.04.3:\nGenerally, any valid X Keysym string will work. Multiple keys are separated by '+'. Aliases exist for \"alt\", \"ctrl\", \"shift\", \"super\", and \"meta\" which all map to Foo_L, such as Alt_L and Control_L .\nHowever, OP mentions the tag 15.04, and on 15.04, the passage is missing in man xdotool, and the aliasses do not work any more. The values, found in the output of xev should be used.\n\nA: This is going to sound silly, but verify you're on X11 and not Wayland:\necho $XDG_SESSION_TYPE\n\nIf it outputs wayland it won't work (xdotool)\n", "Q: One-word command to search for a file I know there's a command to search for a file anywhere. It's a quite simple, 1 word command. Sadly, I forgot what it is. \nSo, let's say I want to search for a file name testingthis. The file could be anywhere in the system. How would I do it?\n\nA: You can use locate\nlocate testingthis\n\nor find\nfind / -name testingthis\n\nFor locate the system has to build a database of files. If the database is not built it will not find anything. Also if you add new files they will not be found until the database is updated again. You can updated the database with updatedb.\n", "Q: When i open ubuntu software center , it automatically closes within seconds. why?

I don't know what a Citadel account is as I never had one!\nI tried keying in my password but nothing happened (I tried different keyboards as well but still nothing is inputted). I also tried re-installing my OS but after a number of errors, an the 5 - 6 attempt I managed to get the install screen that stated that there was no OS detected. Obviously, formatting my computer is the last thing I want to do.\nHow can I restore my OS back to the way it was before installation?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot with a USB - DVD in rescue mode.\n\n*Mount the file system.\n\n*Make a copy of your data. Backup it.\n\n*Create new user, reboot again and try to login with this new user.\n\n*If nothing work. Reinstall.\n\n\nA: You could try the recovery mode of Ubuntu and drop to a root shell.\nFollow the steps at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode or look at the question How do I boot into a root shell? which is more detailed and with screenshots.\nThis root terminal you could use to access the system and back up all your important data. \nYou can also e.g. examine /var/log/apt/history.log which logs packages installed/updated/removed through apt and maybe revert recent installations. \nTo get a list of all installed packages, run dpkg -l | less, but it will be a very long list. Therefore we use the less viewer to get a scrollable list. You can narrow it down to only show lines containing a specific pattern like \"citadel\", use dpkg -l | grep -i \"citadel\" | less (-i for case-insensitive matching).\nRemove strange packages with apt-get purge PACKAGENAME.\nPlease respond if you could follow any of these methods and what results you achieved. We can probably continue with further steps then.\n\nA: Mark, I suspect that you have encountered a ransomware virus. Try booting from a DVD.  Have a look at your hard drive.  Are all the folders OK or do they have strange names? I suspect that they will be encrypted files containing all your data. Certainly, trying to reinstall the OS will fail as this action is blocked by the virus.\nThis vulnerability is very new on Linux. However, I understand that it is not a good one and that it is possible to enter an unencrypt key yourself and free up the machine.  Unfortunately I have lost the article.\nMy advice is contact Ubuntu and ask advice as they must have encountered this by now.  Alternately, search Google for Linux ransomware virus solution.\nI really hope I am wrong but I suspect that I am right in interpreting your OS's symptoms. \n", "Q: problems with dependency and apt-get I am trying to fix some dependencies (python) via\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic\n\nand it asks me to try the command\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nand I got te following which I don't know what to do with them:\nReading package lists...

Since the latest kernel upgrade from 4.2.0-16 to 4.2.0-17 my Aspire V5 Notebook with Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 does not recognize the external monitor nor my lan port anymore. When I boot with 4.2.0-16 there's no problem...\nBoth lan and vga are connected via the Acer LAN/VGA Combo Port which seems to be a proprietary version of a Mini DisplayPort. But to be fair, also wifi and bluetooth seem to be unavailable while those have nothing to do with that port.\nAnyone have similar issues with 4.2.0-17? Or did something weird happen when the kernel was installed? If so, what can I do about that?\nThanks for any suggestions.\n\nA: I'm having similar problems with Ubuntu 15.10 and kernel 4.2.0-17 on my Samsung Ativ 9. None of my USB ports work, Wifi is down, and compiz is using 150% CPU. There is some sort of regression in the 4.2.0-17 kernel, because it's no longer detecting my Haswell CPU; instead, it's rolling back to the llvmpipe software graphics driver (which explains why compiz is going crazy).\nFor now, you can reboot your machine and choose Advanced Options in the grub boot menu to go back to the 4.2.0-16 kernel. My guess is that this problem will be noticed, patched, and a new kernel update will roll out soon.\n\nA: I have the feeling there where some packages (kernel headers and extra's) missing from the first upgrade. Maybe it was just too soon that I executed the upgrade while these missing packages where not released yet? In any case, gonna answer my own question here to share the steps it took to resolve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*reboot and select the advanced boot options at the Grub boot prompt, then choose the previous 16 kernel and boot with that.\n\n*log in and open Software Center, search for \"kernel 17\" (without the quotes)\n\n\nNow check if \"linux-headers-4.2.0-17\" and \"linux-image-extras-4.2.0-17\" are not installed. If they are in the list but not installed, you may try to install them direcctly (don't know if that will fix it) but because I was not sure I proceeded with removing the 17 kernel first:\n\n\n*select \"linux-image-4.2.0-17-generic\" in the short list (you may need to click the \"Show technical items\" link at the bottom) and hit the Remove button\n\n*confirm the question to remove \"linux-signed-image-4.2.0-17-generic\" and \"linux-image-generic\" too\n\n*open the Update Manager and let it run. \n\n\nUpdate Manager should tell you there are new kernel upgrades. If it doesn't, then go back to the Software Center and search for \"linux-image-generic\" and install that. \nLet it upgrade/install all packages (more than the first time!) and reboot.\n\nA: I also had problems with my mini-DisplayPort adapter after switching to Ubuntu 15.10. Problems: the external monitor doesn't get recognized at all, or it gets recognized but only as 1024x768 (and it's a 1980x1024 monitor). \nIt's because of the 4.2.0-18 kernel; if I boot with the old kernel (3.19.0-33-generic) everything works again.\nLet's hope they fix this in the kernel.\n\nA: I was having this problem too. I found that updating to a 4.3.xx version kernel seems to have fixed things.\n", "Q: XBox Controller blinking I've connected a XBox Wireless Controller for PC with my ubuntu machine.

I read the guide but I don't understand. \n\nA: In the first case you're looking for any process with the word thunderbird in. There are two thunderbird and the grep command itself.\nIn the second you're also looking for t character followed by hunderbird, as the [t] means match any listed characters in the square bracket of which there's just the one, the letter t, but this time your two processes are\nuser  17410     1  0 10:09 ?        00:00:20 /usr/lib/thunderbird/thunderbird\nuser  18990 15896  0 12:25 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto [t]hunderbird\n\nThe second process does not match because the rexep [t]hunderbird does not match the literal string [t]hunderbird as the ] prevents the match.\n\nA: Firstly, whether grep --color=auto thunderbird will appear on the process table and hence on the output of ps depends on the time i.e. how busy is your system & how much time it takes for ps to show something on it's output (by parsing the process table)  that has started concurrently, grep in this case. Although this is a highly unlikely case and we can assume that that grep will appear on the output of ps.\nNow, [] is a grep syntax which means (if not followed by other tokens) match any of the characters inside []. So when you use grep '[t]hunderbird', grep treats the [t] to match only t, as a result it would not appear in the output.\nWhile using grep thunderbird, if it makes it way in the process table, we would find the grep process in the output as we are grep-ping for the same thing i.e. grep thunderbird.\nAlso note that grep is an alias to grep --color=auto causing it to appear in the output too.\n\nA: There are two issues here. First, when you run ps | grep ..., the grep process is also shown in the output of ps. The default ps output includes the arguments a process was launched with, not only the process's name. This means that if you run grep foo, and there is a running process called foo, there will be two ps results matching foo: the foo process and the grep itself since it is searching for foo. This is why you get two lines when running ps -f | grep thunderbird.\nNow, the [ ] is a regular expression construct which defines a list of characters, a character class. For example, [abc] will match a or b or c. When you run ps -f | grep [t]hunderbird, that class only contains a single character so is equivalent to thunderbird without the brackets. However, the grep process was launched with [t]hunderbird as an argument this time, and not thunderbird. Therefore, its line in the output of ps will contain [t]hunderbird. It will look like this:\nterdon   23101 10991  0 16:53 pts/3    00:00:00 grep --color [t]hunderbird\n\nThis means that it is not matched when you run ps -f | grep thunderbird since it contains [t]hunderbird and not thunderbird. \nThis is a common trick to avoid matching the grep process itself when running ps | grep. Another alternative is to run ps -f | grep foo | grep -v grep to exclude the grep. The best approach, however, is to use a program specifically designed for this, pgrep:\n$ pgrep -l thunderbird\n11330 thunderbird\n\n\nA: The [] in grep is used for character matching. If we take \n    grep [tb]all my_file.txt\nIt is equivalent to\ngrep tall my_file.txt\ngrep ball my_file.txt\n\nIt will execute grep with taking t+all and then it will execute grep by taking b+all.\nFor example: If we want to look for a word ABC or BBC in a file we can use the following grep command:\ngrep [AB]BC file_name \n\nHere the [] will make grep to expand the the word by taking A, then it will expand the word by using B, thus creating ABC and BBC.\n", "Q: Is Logitech MK220 Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo compatible with ubuntu 14.04 Is MK220 compatible with ubuntu 14.04. Am just was searching for a low cost wireless keyboard and mouse for my ubuntu 14.04.\nPlease comment\n\nA: Yes it does, however it is not quite plug and play. \nYou have to essentially reboot the devices, the easiest way being to cut the power by removing a battery and replacing it. Doing this on both the keyboard and mouse in the K220 gets it working for me everytime.\n\nA: According to Logitech, it's not.

To convert an image into another format, you essentially rename your image with the desired file extension.\nconvert image1.png image1.jpg\n\nTo resize images, use the -resize option.\nconvert image1.png -resize 200×100 image1.png\n\nNote that when using -resize, ImageMagick will preserve the image's aspect ratio and fit it into an image with the specified dimensions. To force an image to a particular size, append an ! to the dimensions.\nconvert image1.png -resize 200×100! image1.png\n\nRotate images with the -rotate option, using degrees. The following command would rotate an image 90 degrees.\nconvert image1.jpg -rotate 90 image1-rotated.jpg\n\nSince this is a command-line tool, you can take advantage of Bash and perform bulk operations. The following command would take all PNG files in the current directory, rotate them, and save a new copy of each with “-rotated” added to the beginning of each file name.\nfor file in *.png; do convert $file -rotate 90 rotated-$file; done\n\nDuring any given operation, if the name of your output image is the same as the input image, the operation will overwrite the original image.

Doing so is covered here, among other places. Note that this feature is not the same as a feature with a similar name in many EFIs' setup utilities.\nSecond, Secure Boot is not likely to be a problem. Disabling it won't make things any harder, but doing so will probably not make them any easier, either. There are exceptions, but this isn't the universally-necessary step that so many people think it is.\nThird, the \"install alongside\" option is often missing on modern EFI-based computers. I'm not sure of the technical cause. (Maybe just the Windows Fast Startup feature, maybe something else.) You may need to use the \"something else\" option instead, as described here (again, among many other places).\nFinally, many HPs have broken EFIs that will give you problems. I can't say for certain that all HPs are broken, but if the computer is new and you end up booting straight into Windows when you're done, save yourself further headaches and return it to the store for a refund. If the computer is old enough that this is impossible, there are workarounds; see here (once again, or many other places) for the ugly details.\n", "Q: \"Open folder\" action, doesn't work in Nautilus A time ago, I tried to set dolphin by default file manager in my Ubuntu 15.04\nI'm not a expert user, I just follow the tutorials in the web, and I changed a lot of keys in folders like: user, bit, etc...\nThe final result, it doesn't work...and finally my Nautilus file manager now doesn't work properly. \nFor example, using software like Transmission-torrent, I click in \"open folder\" (right rick option) and ..nothing\nI don't want to reinstall all my system for this little detail...so I will very appreciate your help.

Everything works fine except for the built-in microphone.\nI found a partial solution here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1885240. When I set one channel to 0 and the other to 100% as suggested in that post, the mic test here: https://www.onlinemictest.com/ shows that the mic is working correctly.\nHowever, as soon as I start a Skype or Hangouts call, the level of the 'active' channel seems to be dynamically adjusted downwards. I can see this happening if I keep Pulse Audio open.\nSo, if I make a Skype test call for instance, I hear the first word at the correct level and then the voice goes very quiet.\nAny suggestions please?\n\nA: After some investigations I found the following:\nEven if you do not allow Skype to adjust the sound level automatically, Skype adjusts the level of microphone down to zero, no matter if it is internal or external microphone.\nTake a sound mixer, such as as veromix. Split the sound coming from microphone into right and left channel by unlocking the sound level adjustment. Then adjust right channel to zero and left channel to maximum. After that you can lock the level adjustment again, the position of level adjustment is then about 50%.\nAfter that microphone in Skype will work normally.\nDo not modify sound level for input e.g. in pulseaudio, it will give you the old situation without microphone sound. This adjustment will remain also after Restart.\n\nA: Based on the previous answer I installed veromix and at the microphone I unlocked the channels, set the left to 50% and the right to 0%.\nHere came the problem, that every time I adjusted the volume by volume keys, my microphone settings were set back to their initial state, nothing worked.\nThe solution was to uninstall libcanberra-gtk0, libcanberra-gtk-module, and wingpanel-indicator-sound (this last is only for elementary os). I still have libcanberra-gtk3-0, libcanberra-gtk3-module, so I can adjust sound with the volume keys, and it does not influence the mic settings.\n", "Q: How to upgrade/install newest version of nodejs on Ubuntu 14.04 I have been working an hour for this.\nTaken from their official documentation :\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nHowever, its never working for me.

But you will be probably looking for something like VNC.\n", "Q: Pulseaudio does not detect analog speakers, only HDMI output possible Asus Z87-Pro (onboard Sound ALC1150), Ubuntu 15.10, Gnome3.\n$ cat /proc/asound/cards\n 0 [HDMI           ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel HDMI\n                      HDA Intel HDMI at 0xefd34000 irq 34\n 1 [PCH            ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel PCH\n                      HDA Intel PCH at 0xefd30000 irq 33\n\nGnome sound settings and pulseaudio (e.g. pavucontrol) only offer to use HDMI output (sound card 0). pavucontrol > configuration shows two internal devices, first offering some HDMI output options, second card listing some analog output options (2.0, 5.1,... + many other options) but all those lines end with \"(unplugged)\".\nManually selecting the card works, and the following command is working as it should; I hear the voice from the connected speakers.\naplay -c1 whatever.wav\n\nSo I assume the speakers are connected as they should and pulseaudio's jack detection is broken somehow.\nStrange detail: there is one single situation presenting perfect sound: it's the sound when logging off...\nIs there any way to override jack detection? All threads found so far handle missing device drivers (i.e. card not recognized at all), renaming devices...\n\nA: I resolved my quite similar problems in this post: Only have HDMI / Display Port for sound except Analog. You could try my way by reinstalling analog package:\nsudo apt-get remove analog\nsudo apt-get install analog\n\nReboot it and your computer may work properly.\n\nA: Try installing jackd:\nsudo aptitude install jackd\n\nJACK Audio Connection Kit (default server package) is a low-latency sound server, allowing multiple applications to connect to one audio device, and to share audio between themselves.\n\nSee if that's what you want.\nNormally jack detection/unplugged does not affect operation of the device. Remember it's not perfect even in Windows with official drivers.\nPavucontrol:\nManual selection between analog or hdmi is not related to jack detection. That is the correct method because both analog and hdmi are normally connected at the same time, but output is only sent to one depending on your need. If you never use either of those, then you can just select 'Off' for that, and the other will always be used.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on HP ProBook 430?

Which node version will it use?\nWhat should i do to solve this?\nThanks a lot for your help\n\nA: The error:\nln: failed to create symbolic link ‘/usr/bin/node’: File exists\nis normally caused when you really have two versions of the Nodejs, a with the alias of the node and the other with the nodejs alias, as we can see on the result of the commands node --version and nodejs --version:\n$ node --version\nv5.0.0\n$ nodejs --version\nv0.10.25\n\nso you can't create a symbolic link for a file that already exists.\nTo solve this you need to completely remove the two packages using:\nsudo apt-get purge node\nsudo apt-get purge nodejs\nsudo rm -rf bin/node bin/node-waf include/node lib/node lib/pkgconfig/nodejs.pc share/man/man1/node\n\nand reinstall only the nodejs package using the command:\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n\nand create a symbolic link using:\nln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node\n\nor install the nodejs-legacy that will resolve this problem with the command:\nsudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy \n\n\nA: Steps that solved the same problem for me:\nsudo apt-get remove nodejs\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/node /usr/bin/nodejs\n\nExplanation\nYou have installed two versions of nodejs on your computer, so you need to remove one of them. Your situation:\nnode v5.0.0 - you will keep this one\nnodejs v0.10.25 - this you can remove\n\nYou can remove nodejs package via apt-get remove command. This will also remove the file /usr/bin/nodejs and you will not get your error message again.\nNow you can create a symbolic link called \"/usr/bin/nodejs\", that points on source \"/usr/local/bin/node\". In your example you have wrong order of paths \"from\" and \"to\"\nsudo ln -s source_file myfile\n\nMore info about links creation: How symbolic links works\n\nA: For me the node command is the NodeJS installed by nvm and nodejs command is the NodeJS installed using apt-get\n", "Q: Ubuntu + Kubuntu on one USB?

I have read the various threads on the topic and still can't work it out.  \nI have recently purchased a Lenovo Thinkpad x250 and I want to set my battery management to have charging thresholds and whatever other settings are ideal for prolonging the battery life. \nI have looked into tlp and tp-smapi. I also found tpacti-bat. Unfortunately, I don't understand what it says on this website at all. \nI installed tlp, which apparently has to be managed entirely from the terminal. I haven't found any descriptions I understand on how to do this and I have no idea how I can see the settings and change them. \nSo I deleted it again. \nFor tp_smapi I found these instructions: \n\nInstallation on Ubuntu: Ubuntu ships tp_smapi in their\n  linux-ubuntu-modules-* package for Hardy, so you don't have to build\n  it yourself. Please note that they have renamed tp_smapi's modified\n  hdaps module to hdaps_ec so that the two can coexist. You should load\n  hdaps_ec, not hdaps.\n\nWhat on earth does this mean? \nIs there any program which is user-friendly to people whose computer knowledge is very basic and which can be run as a program on Ubuntu where I can easily see and alter the settings? \nOr is there an easy-to-follow guide to use for the tlp program?\nThis was too long for a comment: \nNow I have tried it out for a few days and there are three options: 1. It isn't working, 2. The information I see in the power statistics (when I click the battery icon in the upper right corner of my screen) is all wrong, 3. I am unable to read mentioned information. \nHere is what is shown in the power statistics: the percentage of the battery power stays the same all day, as do the \"minutes to charge\". It changes slightly in between suspend modes. Two days ago, it was on 46% the whole time, then after I'd had the system suspended for some time, it was on 44 %. Also the minutes changed. Today it has shown 52 % and 17 minutes, then after some time in suspend mode it now shows 51 % and 25 minutes, not changing. What is shown changes if I unplug the pc and plug it back in.\nWhen I click the power statistics details, the main battery (BATT0) tells me 0 seconds time to full and 0 seconds time to empty, the BATT1 says the minutes shown in the corner as its time to full. This information changes in between I suspend / shut down / unplug the computer. For both of the batteries it always says \"charging\" when plugged in. In short, it seems all wrong. \nPlease help? Thank you. \n\nA: Please stop messing around with kernel modules by hand and stay away from way outdated instructions for Hardy. All things needed are available as packages from either the Ubuntu repos (15.10) or the TLP PPA.\nInstall TLP as described here. You may omit the tp-smapi-dkms package as tp-smapi is incompatible with the X250.\nModify TLP's configuration to include your desired charge thresholds, Example here. Don't forget to remove the leading #'s from these lines.\nTo activate the thresholds use\nsudo tlp start\n\nShow the output of\nsudo tlp-stat -s -c -b \n\n", "Q: Is there an iteractive firewall extension available for Ubuntu?

The first one is Samsung SyncMaster(S22B150) and the second is an LG FLATRON W1934S.\nThe difference between them is that the Samsung monitor is plugged to my graphics card via an DVI to VGA adapter, while the Flatron is directly attached to the integrated graphics port.\nNow the Flatron gets the correct resolution and is recognised by Ubuntu. On the Samsung, I get an unknown display - with 3 super small resolutions.\nAlso, on this new version of Ubuntu it does not show the additional drivers. The list is just empty. I've also experienced some screen flickering and mouse bugs, like the arrow getting under icons, please help me solve this \"mystery.\"\n\nA: Unfortunately the correct answer doesn't solve your problem.\nCurrently X.org is not able to split graphics to two different video cards. A long time ago there used to be a way to do this using Xinerama, however only the proprietary drivers still support Xinerama. IOW, you can't do this if one of the GPUs is Intel Graphics.\nNow, you can get this to work if you use two NVIDIA cards using -nvidia and Xinerama (or perhaps TwinView). And maybe two AMD cards using -fglrx.\nHowever, my recommendation would be to buy a new NVIDIA card that has two outputs on it, and connect your two monitors to that. Then you can run either -nvidia or -nouveau and it should give good performance and be stable.\nOf course, it would be nice if the configuration you're attempting worked. There are some efforts upstream to rearchitect X to allow it, but this is still in the development stages and may be a year or two. But if you are looking for something to spend some time on as a hobby and aren't afraid of breaking your system, you could experiment with the upstream codebases and supply them with feedback\nAs told in the question earlier\n", "Q: LuckyBackup scheduled backup does not work I am using luckyBackup 0.4.8 on Kubuntu 15.04.

It does not receive any more updates and has certain broken parts.\nHere's a list of additional software you could use to accomplish the task at hand -->\n1) Guacamole\n2) appear.in\n3) Chrome Remote Desktop\nThe other option is to use remote desktop over VNC. Its simple and does not require the installation of other third-party applications. Guide to setup VNC.\nThe most recommended option would be Jitsu video bridge. It is a video chat client that will also provide you with the option to share the desktop beside some other features. It could be the alternative for skype that you are looking and it works directly from within the browser.\nEdit: Google Hangouts also support screen sharing.\n\nA: Skype for Linux is not as good as the ones for Windows or OSX. For Linux, it seems like a stripped down version and even after that, some features do not work. Looks like Microsoft is not making real efforts to solve the problems faced by Linux users let alone adding new features.\nI too would advise you to find another program. Teamviewer's presentation mode seems good for personal use and it works well for Windows as well as Linux based systems. \nYou can also try and find some open source programs for the same.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I deleted the skype folder from :~/.config/\n\nA: Remove /home/username/.skype start skype, log in and screen sharing should work normally\n\nA: Skype for Linux is practically unsupported and unmantained. The best alternative in my opinion is Google's Hangouts. You can even invite people sending them a link and you will not need to install anything (Although chrome is a good suggestion).\nIf you insist, you may find some tutorials on how to run Skype for Windows though Wine and PlayOnLinux.

The installation went fine, with the exception of two blaring faults:\nWhen booting, I'm shown Grub with four selections:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu (boots into Lubuntu just fine)\n\n*Advanced options for Ubuntu (whatever)\n\n*Windows Boot Manager (on /dev/sda1) (all this does is send me back to Grub)\n\n*System Setup\n\n\nI followed the guidelines on the Lubuntu site (with some reference to normal Ubuntu setup) to make sure I did the dual-boot properly; sda3 contains my Windows 10 operating system along with the bulk of my files (which are all backed up in hard copies) while sda6 contains my Lubuntu environment.\nsda3 (where Windows, my default, was located) is listed as NTFS while sda6 (Lubuntu) is listed as Ext4.\nAll my previous files are intact exactly where I downloaded them, and I assumed Windows is still there, completely healthy; but I can't access it!\nThe second complication; I cannot connect to wifi on Lubuntu, rendering me helpless on the computer and unable to even attempt many troubleshoots.\nI have very limited experience with Linux, though I've read up on the command line a lot, and opted for Lubuntu because it can boot with UEFI enabled alongside Win10. However, I am sick of this; I followed all of the steps listed from credible sources and I am now unable to access my chief operating system, which I had no intention of scrapping (hence dual-booting).\nI list a lot of minor details because I am not sure what is helpful and what is not; suffice it to say that any solution that can bring Windows 10 into the boot list will be tremendously helpful. I would be fully satisfied completely resetting the computer as it was, with only Windows 10 running and all of my files gone, if that's necessary and if someone can instruct me how (last time I tried it just reinstalled Windows on the partition I can't access and booted into Ubuntu).\nI am currently trying \"boot-repair\" to see if that magically resolves this. If Windows was somehow compromised, I'm also setting up a disc to install the operating system again.\nIf Windows is somehow no longer functional through all of this, I'd like to know that as well, and will supply whatever information I can glean without an internet connection from the laptop if it is needed for an informed answer.\nAgain, I just want to access Windows again, even at the expense of this dysfunctional Ubuntu partition.\nThank you.\nUPDATE\nI managed to reinstall windowa through the boot loader and accessed it for the first time in a while. I was so scared out of my mind that I deleted my Ubuntu partition and rebooted with the windows recovery disc to remove grub.  Now there's another problem...\nI can't seem to advanced boot with f2,  and get sentto a stripped-down Grub loader: \"Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported.\" I want to trash Grub entirely, but to do that I need access to the Windows loader. \nIf I can replace Grub with the default Windows boot loader, I can stop my hair out and swear to never do anything potentially dangerous to a computer without professional supervision. \nAgain, I need to delete Grub loader so I can use Windows loader like the machine initially intended,  but I keep getting sent to this minimal BASH-like Grub screen.  \n\nA: I've had the same problem. To boot Windows 10 a different way, hit F12 while it is displaying the company's name, then choose Windows Boot Manager.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 installation error: The master control interrupt lied (SDE)!” I'm attempting a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.10 on a new Lattitude E7250 laptop off of a USB stick.\nThe process goes well and copies all the files to the hard drive and then asks me to restart to continue the process.

Let me detail what I try to ask.\nWhen I use\nsudo apk-get install blablabla\n\nI get the output\nAfter this operation, 39.6 MB of additional disk space will be used.\n\nbut when I execute \nsudo apk-get purge blablabla\n\nthe output states I'll have 23.4 MB of additional disk space. What creates the difference? \nStill new to Linux\n\nA: The packages have something known as dependencies. For example , package cowsay depends on perl ( and you can verify that with apt-cache show pkgname). When you install a package, apt-get installs additional dependencies as well, but when removing a package - apt-get leaves dependencies alone, and you have to use autoremove option\nOn the other hand, it also doesn't account for the cache packages, i.e. the actual .deb package which apt downloads, then extracts stuff from it and compiles.\nCheck this:\n$ apt-cache show cowsay | grep -i size\nInstalled-Size: 88\nSize: 18532\n\nAlldeb packages have this Installed-Size information field which by definition is \n\nestimated installed size in bytes, divided by 1024 and rounded up\n\n( Notice, it's estimated, it's may vary with the actual amount of installed files, and depend on how meticulous the package maintainer is about the details )\nSo the estimated installation will be 88*1024 = 90112 or 90.1 kB in size. And it coincides with what purge says:\nAfter this operation, 90.1 kB disk space will be freed.\n\nAfter I have purged the package, the archive however is still there:\n$ ls /var/cache/apt/archives/cowsay_3.03+dfsg1-6_all.deb               \n/var/cache/apt/archives/cowsay_3.03+dfsg1-6_all.deb\n\nYou can use apt-get flags clean and autoclean as well as remove those manually\n\nA: Part of it is because there are configs (now I see you are doing purge), but there's also the cache space used up by the DEB archive when it's downloaded.\n", "Q: I installed android studio using umake, but I can't find the AVD Manager I installed android studio using umake, but I can't find the AVD Manager. \n\nHow do I get avd manager installed and working on ubuntu?\n\nA: There are two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Directly from toolbar\n\n\nClick on the second icon \n\n\n\n*You can also (I'm using Android Studio 1.5.1) choose Tools -> Android -> AVD Manager\nIf it doesn't work\n\n\n*\n\n*choose File -> Settings, than find Android SDK menu item\n\n*click on `Launch Standalone SDK Manager\n\n*choose Tools -> Manage AVDs\n\nIt seems to you downloaded broken package, or Android Studio doesn't have or recognize Android SDK path.\n\nYou can also do these steps:\numake android --remove\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:paolorotolo/android-studio \nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install android-studio\n\nHope it help\n", "Q: Unable to mount hard drive for file copy I was recently given a hard drive from a family member to backup.

And yes I used the right username and password. It simply is stuck in loop back to the login screen. I tried all I have patience for. Now I have an unusable machine. \nHow can I uninstall Ubuntu and totally start over? \n\nA: If you want to uninstall Ubuntu and install another OS or reinstall Ubuntu, you can just put in the installation material of the OS (USB, CD etc.) Then before the booting of Ubuntu begins you use the pre-defined button(s) to go into BIOS. (They differ between computers so I can't tell what buttons they are, but in most cases it prints it on screen when you start your computer up. Or you can Google it.) Set the boot options so the computer boots your installation material before booting OS. From there, you can install the OS of your choosing.\nHowever if you didn't mean to go back to Windows by saying \"totally starting over\" then I think instead of performing a reinstall you can simply use recovery mode following the instructions from here and get rid of your problem.\nHow you want to approach the situation is up to you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Read Only File System On Almost Every Boot Even After FSCK I'm a newbie web developer using 14.04.

Is there a way to prevent this?  Transcriber does not seem to work with the depreciated audio driver anyhow.\n\nA: You can use apt-mark to mark a package as manually installed so that it will not be automatically removed while removing some other package (because it is a dependency of this package hence is marked as auto installed).\nFor example, in my computer i am mark-ing zenity as manually installed:\n% apt-mark showauto zenity    \nzenity\n\n% sudo apt-mark manual zenity\nzenity set to manually installed.\n\n% apt-mark showmanual zenity \nzenity\n\nIn you case, you need:\nsudo apt-mark manual transcriber\n\n\nA: sudo apt-mark hold <package>\nFor example:\nsudo apt-mark hold transcriber\nThe opposite is:\nsudo apt-mark unhold <package>\nTo show what packages are held:\nsudo apt-mark showhold\n", "Q: How to set up charging threshold in ubuntu 14.04 I'm Trying to set up a charging treshold in my laptop Toshiba Satellite. \nI have tried with TLP but the batery is still at 100% and charging.\nWhat I want is that when the AC power supply is connected, the battery charges until some level (80% for example) and then stop charging it; so my laptop con use the AC power instead of the battery.\nSome people told me to just take out the battery but I want this so if the AC power is disconected, my computer doesn't shut down abruptly and use the battery as a safety. \n\nA: TLP docs state unequivocally that charge thresholds are possible for ThinkPads only. I'm not aware of any other laptop brand where you may apply thresholds within Linux.\nDid you look into BIOS/UEFI setup?\n\nA: I also want to do this and have spent quite a while looking online for a solution. There is actually a BIOS option that lets you set the threshold to 90%. There is also a utility for windows made by fujitsu which I think lets you set it to 80% but that may no longer be an option.

I have since installed other desktops with a good result. I am therefore considering removing and reinstalling Ubuntu's default desktop but have not done so as yet. Given the fact installing another desktops solved the problem for me it is likely reinstalling the Ubuntu desktop will bring about a good result as well.   \n\nA: I ran into the same problem.

That should do.\n", "Q: lowercase \"a\" not working in gnome-terminal but works in xterm? I'm hesitant to even post this question as I'm sure it must be something simple but looking around I can't see how gnome-terminal would remap keys where xterm and a \"real\" terminal (ctrl+atl+F1) would not (they all load bashrc etc.) I also checked to see if the symptoms were present with other shells (ksh) and that doesn't change anything. \n\"a\" works fine in other applications and also I ran showkey --scancodes and 'a' actually returns \"0x1e 0x9e\" which I think is \"a down\" \"a up\" so all seems well with the keyboard itself. \nAt this point I don't know what's causing gnome terminal to interpret \"a\" any differently than other applications. Does it have a key map of its own?\nUpdate: \nRaphael - font: Checked on the font used, it's not customized so I'm using whatever the terminal defaults to\nTerdon: Hanging my head in shame... It was indeed a shortcut! Considering I hadn't customized anything, is there a way for this to be done w/o actually going through preferences? However curious the source of the problem, it does fix things. Thanks for taking the time to reply!\n\nA: Per comments above by @terdon it's worth checking the terminal's preferences, somehow had 'a' mapped to something else. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 Launcher Icons Not Locking Just installed Ubuntu 15.10 x64 a couple of days back; great by the way.\nApps locked to the launcher are lost after every restart; regardless of whether they are pinned by selecting Lock to Launcher or dragged from Dash.\nHow do I make them stick?\nAlso, Dash seems to have some hiccups as well, freezing from time to time.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install glib using the command:\n\n\n\nsudo apt-get install libglib2.0-0\n\nEDIT: Also, it seems that you might need to install python gst:\n\nsudo apt-get install python-gst*\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out of your system.\n\n*Then press \n\n\n\nCtrl + Alt + F1\n\n\n\n*Login with your Username & Password.\n\n*Then, run this commands\n\nunity --reset-icons\nunity --reset\nsudo reboot now\n\nEDIT: If even still you are unable to lock items onto the launcher then, open Home then, press \"Ctrl + h\" to show hidden folders.

There is only one more step that you need to take if you want to install the application for all users under /opt:\nYou need to switch to the advanced mode and change the bundle pool folder to something like /opt/eclipse/.p2/pool.
