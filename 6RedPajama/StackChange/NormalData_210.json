["Q: Disk partition for ubuntu 14.04.2 \n*\n\n*I have installed Windows 7 with two partitions (C & D drives both have 60GB each)on my 160 GB HDD.  Now I want to install Ubuntu 14.4.2 on the unallocated remaining disk space.  Please tell me what should be the disk partition for installing Ubuntu on this Intel-i5 system having 4 GB RAM if I opt to install Ubuntu by selecting \"something else\" option.  Also let me know is there any mandatory % of disk space required/specification for allocation of swap,/,/user, /home, etc.\n\n*Sometimes, it happens that after installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 as dual OS, the boot option menu did not show and can not log in to Windows OS. Tell me please how can I solve this issue\n\nA: \nPlease tell me what should be the disk partition for installing Ubuntu\n\nWhatever you want since we have hardly any restrictions. If you want you can have 1 massive partition named \"/\" or have 2 partitions 1 named \"/\" and 1 named \"/home\" for your personal data. \nThe only restrictions we have: you must have a partition named \"/\". All partitions that have system related files (ie. \"/\" and \"/home\" except for the user dirs in \"/home\") need to be formatted in a file system that is POSIX compliant. \"ext4\" is the current default. \nSize can be calculated on how you use your system but 10Gb/15Gb can be enough if you use a \"/home\" for your personal data. If you want to use mysql for instance your \"/\" might need a bit more. I hardly reach 10Gb on \"/\" and use my system with some test databases using mysql. \n\nSometimes, it happens that after installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 as dual OS, the boot option menu did not show and can not log in to Windows OS. Tell me please how can I solve this issue\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-install grub. Example: How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\n\n*You might also want to install \"boot customizer\". It is a tool to edit and view your boot settings. \n\n\nA: If you have only 60 GB total space for Ubuntu, I suggest this split:\n4 GB for swap\nThe rest for /\nIt does not make any sense to have separate / and /home when there is very little space.\nThis is not related to Windows at all. Just a general recommendation.\n", "Q: how are software sources controled?

How do I go about keeping my passwords and data safe?\nI'm new when it comes to networking, so any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The same applies for any network you do not trust completely:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only use TLS (that is to say, only use URLs that begin with https://)\n\n*Don't accept any certificates that aren't globally trusted.\n\n*Remove certificate exceptions from your browser\n\n*If in doubt, use another encrypted network layer like socks over SSH, or use a VPN to a safe network.\n\n\nYou could argue that we should all be doing these all the time anyway.\nHowever, even with these in place, if somebody has had physical access to your computer though, all bets are off.

It takes between 8 to 18 hours to manage to start it up depending on how much work it had done previously.\nSo I figured it would be a solution never letting it be switched off or suspended, but completely active. The problem is this is a waste of energy. So I thought maybe it was possible to make a script that turns on and off the computer periodically. I guess it's impossible to turn it off completely because how is it going to execute the script if the computer is not switched on? So at least let it be suspended.\nSo what do you think? Is this achievable? I was thinking of using crontab and shutdown (or some similar command to suspend or hibernate) but I am not sure how to do this.\nAny suggestion?\n\nA: rtcwake should be able to help you out here.\nsudo rtcwake -m mem -s 15\n\nThat should enter a S3 (memory) suspend for a few seconds, all your fans will shut off... And then and then boot right back up again without any state loss. Even network connections remain intact here.\nThere is also a -m off mode. I'm going to assume you lose state completely here and AFAIK, only some BIOSes are equipped to power on from an off-state from RTC. Might be worth a shot if S3 doesn't work.\n\nYou can automate that with cron. Run sudo crontab -e and add something like:\n0 */4 * * * rtcwake -m mem -s 15\n\nThat will run every four hours. It'll annoy the hell out of anybody using it when it goes to sleep, but that's apparently what you want.\n\nBut in all seriousness, this doesn't sound like a healthy underlying issue.\nYou might do well to fix or replace the broken parts, or at least diagnose it properly. You might be able to fix the problem completely or at least get it to the point that so when it does finally die, you know what needs replacing.\nThese things have a habit of kicking the bucket when you most need them.\n", "Q: Storage property of deployed MAAS node report 0 disks My controlnode is a hyper-v vm image running Trusty LTS with the maas maas-region-controller maas-cluster-control and juju that control 4 physical HP ProLiant DL360G5 nodes in a ready state. I successfully commissioned each of them with the debian installer. My default deployment iso is Trusty 14.10. When I go to the machine summary of each node, all information is correct except for the storage details on all 4 nodes, which always shows 0.0GB over 0 disks.\nWhen I ssh'ed into one of these nodes and executed a lshw -class disk command, lshw did not find any disks on the system. However lshw -class storage did find my HP P400i scsi raid controller.\nWhen I cd to /dev/disk/by-path I do see them and the deployed node shows it is installed on disk 0 where I see that it created 3 partitions.\npci-0000:06:00.0-cciss-disk0\npci-0000:06:00.0-cciss-disk0-part1\npci-0000:06:00.0-cciss-disk0-part2\npci-0000:06:00.0-cciss-disk0-part5\npci-0000:06:00.0-cciss-disk1\npci-0000:06:00.0-cciss-disk2\npci-0000:06:00.0-cciss-disk3\npci-0000:06:00.0-cciss-disk4\npci-0000:06:00.0-cciss-disk5\n\nThat made me also realize that the disks are not called /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc, but instead /dev/cciss/c0d0, /dev/cciss/c0d1 etc. It seems to me that lshw is the problem in this matter. \nI am also curious if it would be possible, in case I find a fixed version of lshw, to manually update the deployment images with another version of lshw and if that can be done with the juju deployment image as well?\nUpdate:\nIn the mean time, I went to the authors website of lshw and it seems that they have problems, so I could not enter a ticket.

It will have exactly same directory structure and you may just browse folders, files and search in them. Also your next backup may just be a difference, rsync allows you to rewrite just changed files so you will save enormous amount of computer resources and time.\n$ sudo rsync -aAXHvP --exclude='/dev/*' --exclude='/proc/*' --exclude ='/sys/*' --exclude='/media/*' --exclude='run/' --exclude='/mnt/*' /* /media/external-hard-drive\n\nFor more information on individual rsync options see man rsync.\n\nWhy these excludes, I will borrow these lines from Ubuntu Community Wiki:\n... you will need to add several more --exclude= arguments to avoid filesystems you do not want. These would be /proc, /sys, /mnt, /media, /run and /dev directories in root. /proc and /sys are virtual filesystems that provide windows into variables of the running kernel, so you do not want to try and backup or restore them. /dev is a tmpfs whose contents are created and deleted dynamically by udev, so you also do not want to backup or restore it. Likewise, /run is a tmpfs that holds variables about the running system that do not need backed up.\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/TAR\n\nA: Clonezilla is great, but if you ever need to restore to a smaller partition it becomes a pain. I prefer to use fsarchiver, which quickly creates very compressed backups that can be deployed anywhere you need them. There's a neat PDF with a recommended backup model found here: https://github.com/issmirnov/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/fsarchiver/backup-ver2.pdf\nThe usage is very simple. To backup, you do sudo fsarchiver savefs -vj4z5 /media/BACKUP_DRIVE/backup.fsa /dev/sdXy.

And to connect the new machine to the network, one of the other machines needs to be disconnected as there just aren't enough ports in the router to plug the cables into.\nSo I was wondering if there is any way to do some sort of internet sharing so that I connect the machine to my machine and it shares some of my internet?

It seems to be worth a shot if doable; if so how do I do that ?\n\nA: You could configure sudo to not need a password for a particular\ncommand and go back to using a non-root cron. \nFor this, assuming a user id of \"user\" wants to run the command FreeFileSync as root, create a file /etc/sudoers.d/user with\nuser ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/FreeFileSync\n\nThe command must be given with a full pathname. If you don't explicitly list the args to the command, then any args will be allowed by sudo.\nReplace ALL by your hostname (not localhost) to be more secure.\nThis assumes file /etc/sudoers has the line: (note # is not a comment)\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nIf not, then just add the user entry to /etc/sudoers. Be careful editing this file: use visudo, or ensure you have root logged in or a shell running root to be able to do any repairs.\nYour user crontab entry can then just have the command:\nDISPLAY=:0.0 sudo /usr/bin/FreeFileSync /home/user/bu-1.ffs_batch 2>/home/user/bu-1.ffs_log\n\nubuntu sudo will preserve some environment variables for the command including DISPLAY and HOME (see output of sudo sudo -V) so the program will be able to read the ~/.Xauthority file (continue reading for details).\n\nAlternatively, to keep using a root crontab:\nif when you do ps alxww|grep X you find your X11 server running with an -auth option, something like this:\n/usr/bin/X :0 ... -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 ...\n\nit means clients must connect using the secret in the file /var/run/lightdm/root/:0. This file holds a copy of the secret in the user's ~/.Xauthority file.\nThis \"secret\" is just an arbitrary random number.\nIf you are root you can read both files, so your client can simply provide in the environment:\nXAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0\n\nAlternatively, you can set the HOME to that of the user of the display,\nHOME=/home/user so that the right .Xauthority file is found there.\nAlternatively, you can export the secret from this to root's home:\nxauth -f /home/user/.Xauthority nextract - localhost/unix:0 | sudo xauth -f /root/.Xauthority nmerge -\n\nand then XAUTHORITY=/root/.Xauthority or just HOME=/root.\n", "Q: sudo dpkg i chntpw* is not working I am trying to run sudo dpkg -i chntpw* while running Ubuntu from a USB drive on my PC.

If i have a syntax error in some conf file : nginx warn me and wont restart, which is normal too.\nBut every changes i make doesnt seem to apply, like I can change the listen port to 1234 (or whatever), reload/restart nginx, the website still online. I can remove the domain in sites-enabled, reload/restart nginx, the website still online.\nI use nginx for more than 5 years and its the first time I see that. Is there any cache or something new in the nginx configuration that i could have missed ?\n\nA: I know I am late to the party, but for those who find this through google: \nTry launching the url from a different browser ;)\nExplanation: If you set a bogus redirect rule in a config with a permanent switch, most browsers will remember this rule and cache it. For example chrome caches it in some internal file that can not be cleared by removing cookies and site data - you have to actually clear full browser history and all browsing data for the last x hours.\n\nA: You can check your configuration with \nsudo nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\nUsually that file includes \ninclude /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;\ninclude /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\n\nAnd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/* are symlinks to /etc/nginx/sites-available/*, so edit the actual files, and check the config before reloading.\n", "Q: CTRL and ALT works as SHIFT?

I have some files that Ubuntu can't read it ( ANSI encoding ) but Windows can read it well.\nWhen I open it in gedit or notepad++ it seems like this :\n\nÊã ÇáÊÍæíá áÜÜ\n\nHow can I make Ubuntu read ANSI encoded files well? \n\nA: ANSI means more or less nothing --- the most probable candidate for your encoding is Windows-1252. You can convert the file with \niconv -f WINDOWS-1252 -t utf8 < filein.txt > fileout.txt\n\nbut remember, most encodings (read the linked article if you are not sure about what that mean)  can't be reliably guessed, so you need to know the exact encoding to give sense to your data. \nFrom the comments it seems that you are most probably looking for some Arabic encoding --- in that case check WINDOWS-1256. \nThe list of available encodings for iconv is on github, or you can find it with the command \niconv --list \n\nNotice that just at the start of the list there are a bunch of \"ANSI\"-like encodings.\n\nA: If you don't want to convert it as mentioned in Rmano's answer, you may use Geany or Kate to read/edit them ar they are, default Arabic encoding in Windows is CP-1256 (WINDOWS-1256). Just keep in mind that switching to UTF-8 is recommended over all. It is supported by Notepad++ and Windows default note editor.\nGeany\nsudo apt-get install geany\n\n\nKate\nsudo apt-get install kate\n\n\n\nA: The gedit can work with files encoded with e.g. Windows-1250.

I need help. I really want to try minecraft pi. I would like step by step instructions or a walkthrough please.\n\nA: As pointed out in some of the comments, the reason it wont run on Ubuntu, or Lubuntu, is that Minecraft Pi is specifically compiled to run on the Raspberry Pi hardware.\nIt's not a a slightly customized version of the regular, Java based Minecraft, which will run on most platforms where java is available. Rather, it is an an executable program that has been hard-wired for the Raspberry Pi' which has, generally speaking, fewer resources than a regular desktop PC, and also a somewhat different internal operating system structure.\nThere is really no simple workaround for this. Minecraft-Pi was developed to meet a particular need, which it does awesomely, IMHO. It's just not a general purpose Minecraft client or server.\nIf you want to achieve the same outcome, namely using Python to create and interact with your Minecraft world, you certainly can, it's just a little bit more work than running mcpi on the Raspberry Pi.  A great place to start is this Instructable.\n\nA: You can't install an archive directly.

Even though Ubuntu is based on Debian, Raspbian is a tweaked version of Debian so it cannot execute, however you can experience Minecraft in classic.minecraft.net. classic.minecraft.net is not a full version of Minecraft. It is the classic Minecraft.\n\nA: Pi Edition is built for ARM based architecture, if you would like to run this on any x86 system you will probably need to virtualize.\n", "Q: Howto install onto a software RAID? I am trying to install onto an ASUS system with an LSI (fake) raid controller.  Unlike debian, ubuntu 14 detected it and installed drivers and utilities.  Then it creates a RAID 1 as directed.  All is well.\nBut it fails to install a boot loader, grub or lilo.  No error details, just \"failed to install\".  So sad.  I tried to create a partition for /boot and not have it be part of the RAID but it fails.\nHow do I install a boot loader onto a RAID?\n\nA: The installer should default to the correct location, but if not, make sure it is set to install grub to the whole array ( /dev/mapper/something on older editions of Ubuntu, /dev/mdXX on recent releases if you have an Intel fakeraid ) rather than an individual drive ( /dev/sda ).\n\nA: This should be done automatically at the end of the Ubuntu server/desktop install. See this guide - Official Ubuntu Guides\nOn my server, the boot loader got installed on both the HDD's directly (Raid1).

I used GnuPG to generate a key. But looking at the GUI, I cannot tell where my public key is stored. I would like to share it with friends.\nI clicked on export, this exported a name.asc file, but when I open the file in gedit it is labeled as a private key so I am assuming this is not the public key for sharing.\n\nA: \nI clicked on export, this exported a name.asc file, but when I open the file in gedit it is labeled as a private key so I am assuming this is not the public key for sharing.\n\nThis would indeed be a bad idea, as the private key should remain - private.\nYour public key is stored in the GnuPG keyring (~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg by default). To distribute it, you have two options. Both should also be available in most graphical user interfaces, but might have different names for the commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*Exporting the key and shipping it manually\nTo export your key, use the --export option, which exports a given public key together with all user IDs, subkeys and certifications received. -a/--ascii enables ASCII-armoring, which is mostly a Base64-like encoding making transmission safer, while slightly increasing the file size (which is still rather small).\ngpg --ascii --export [key-id] > your-key.asc\n\nYou can now mail or upload this file somewhere, or pass it around on another medium of your choice.\n\n*Upload the key to the key server network\nUsually, keys are distributed using the key server network. Uploading your public key is very easy using the --send-key command.\ngpg --send-key [key-id]\n\nNow others can search and receive your key by executing\ngpg --search [mail address]\ngpg --recv-key [key-id]\n\nAlso, most OpenPGP implementations will support querying key servers for mail addresses to use in some kind, manually or automatically.\nBe aware you can never delete OpenPGP keys from the key server network (no matter who uploaded it)!\n\nA: From the command line:\nRun gpg --list-keys 'your name' to list the keys you currently have  (replacing your name with the name you have while setting up):\n$ gpg --list-keys muru      \n/home/muru/.gnupg/pubring.gpg\n--------------------------------\npub   2048R/AD0CC9B4 2015-07-15\nuid                  muru\nsub   2048R/450DAD90 2015-07-15\n\nNote the fingerprint of the key you want to export.

If the desktop hit the market about a year ago, what is the chance that I will be successful?  I realize that it's high, but is it very high, so that I can risk my $250?\nI installed Ubuntu, no problems, on an old Dell last weekend.  Out of the PCs I'm thinking of buying for the next one, let me give a concrete example:\nDell i3847-4461BK Desktop PC with Intel Core i3-4150 Processor\nOn the Ubuntu site they said that Dell did have an U image for this exact one, but being a bit of a novice, I don't know how it will go with a generic install.  Might there be missing drivers or something?  Please note that this question is about probabilities.  If you can give me a 0.99 for that example, great...\nThanks!  Mike\n\nA: Inexpensive Dell laptops that come with Ubuntu preinstalled are widely available, including offline at stores, and you also save money by not buying a laptop that comes with Windows preinstalled. Dell laptops that come with Ubuntu preinstalled have customized hardware that is selected to be compatible with Linux. \nDell laptops that come with Windows preinstalled often require running some additional commands in the terminal to get all the hardware devices to work properly, but the probability of a successful installation is high, although I don't know how to provide an exact numerical value for the probability of a successful installation short of asking Dell. In general, Dell uses the Ubuntu community for supporting the Ubuntu operating system including providing drivers in the repositories, etc.\n\nA: My experience with Dell is that if it does not possess \"weird\" graphic cards or the latest Nvidias, it just works.\nUsusally the support for the Nvidias is added pretty quickly (one month or so after the release) via the latest proprietary drivers.\nThe only problem might be the wireless card.\nDoes it have it? Will you use it? If so, what is its chipset?\nPlease ensure that it is supported by the open source driver or at least its producer supports Linux, otherwise there will be a lot of problems.\nYou can simply Google the name of chipset + Linux and see when the latest problems appear.\n", "Q: xdotool's type command eating characters I'm trying to get xmonad to type a common sequence of characters whenever I hit a simple key combo.

Any thoughts?\nusing xmonad 0.11 & xdotool version 3.20140217.1\n\nA: The --sync option was exactly what I was looking for!\nHowever, the --sync option only exists on a particular set of get or search commands.\nThe solution turned out to be: xdotool getwindowfocus windowfocus --sync type thisismyemail@example.com\nWhat's happening here is that we first get the window that is focused, via getwindowfocus (getactivewindow is an alternative if the other doesn't work).\nAll we're doing differently is getting the active window and setting it to the same thing. The key difference is the presence of the --sync option which forces xdotool to wait until the previous command has been applied.\nSo we guarantee that we're focused to a particular window and will be able to type commands.\n\nA: You may need to increase the delay between keystrokes using --delay (default is 12ms):\nxdotool type --delay 100 thisismyemail@example.com\n\n", "Q: Can installing Ubuntu on my PC/mac destroy it or harm it in any way? And will I still have my previous data (files, images, etc...)? If I install Ubuntu on my mac or PC will it harm it or delete any files?\nAfter installing Ubuntu will I still have my old files and pictures and stuff?\n\nA: To install Ubuntu (vs. trying it from a Live USB/CD) you will need to create space on your Hard drive for a set of Ubuntu only partition(s). This is where Ubuntu system files, and potentially user data will be housed.\nOption 1:\nYou can chose to use your entire drive for Ubuntu, you will have to format it and hence by extension will be voluntarily deleting all your data from it.\nOption 2:\nKeep your original OS (OS X or Windows) as is, and instead create a new partition of at the very least 20GB in the free space of your hard drive (assuming you only have one drive). Then install Ubuntu in that newly created partition. In this approach your original data will remain untouched.\n\nA: It all depends on how you do it. If you do it the right way it won't destroy any data, and all files will remain.\nFirst of all you need some free/unallocated space on your HDD where you can put the Linux partition. If your disk has an MBR partition table you can only have 4 primary partitions. You can have more than 4 partition if you create an extended partition then you will be able to create a few more logical partitions inside this extended partition.\nI suggest having more than 16Gb of free space for your Ubuntu, depending on how you are going to use it.\nTo get this unallocated space you have to shrink one of the partition/s from your HDD. If you are a Windows user here you can read about how to do it: Easily Shrink a Volume on a Windows 7 Disk\nThe steps from the link:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Disk Management console by typing diskmgmt.msc at an elevated command prompt.\n\n\n*In Disk Management, right-click the volume that you want to shrink, and then click Shrink Volume.\n\n\n*In the field provided in the Shrink dialog box, enter the amount of space by which to shrink the disk.\n\n\n*Click Shrink.\n\nIn some cases windows wont let you shrink the partition enough, you can look about here How to shrink Windows 7 boot partition with unmovable files\nWhen you have your free space you can then start with the Ubuntu installation. Read carefully the steps related to partitioning. You should be able to see the unallocated space on your HDD. This unallocated space is where the Ubuntu partitions should go.\nAt the end of the installation you should have a dual boot.\n", "Q: Is TRIM Supported for RAID0 in Intel Matrix RAID in Ubuntu 14.04?

My problem is I'm trying to mod Minecraft I'm using a Ubuntu 14.04 and I don’t know what to do, please give me some instructions on what to do. Thank you!\n\nA: It's not Ubuntu specific question.\nYou can read mod Minecraft on the page where you downloaded that mod. Usually you just open minecraft.jar as zip archive and put downloaded .class files there.\n\nI recommend that you try out MagicLauncher.  This allows you to install and enable/disable Minecraft mods really easily.\nOnce you run it click on Setup. You will be presented with this dialog:\n\nThen to add a mod click Add and select the zip of the mod you want to install.

And then format and re-install your system. All you loose is settings and software you installed afterwards. If that includes Apache or MySQL it might be worth it saving the settings and configs from those too. \nIt is of course also possible to create a dd copy of the disk though you would need another 3Tb+ disk to store it... might be a bit too difficult. \n\nuntil one suggested I fix my errors by changing to ext2 file system. \n\nDo not do this since it will format your disk.\n\nUsing tools from LiveCd, PartedMagic and SysRescueCd\n\nI have one more suggestion: testdisk. Besides restoring lost files it can also repair partitions.  You can install and use it from a live session.\n\nI would focus on getting a backup made from your files and then start with a clean new install.\n", "Q: Open a port on Ubuntu 14.04 I have seen similar threads, but they didn't help me.\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 2.6.32-042stab108.5 x86_64) on my VPS.\nI ran a node.js application on port 9000, but this port is closed, so I can't see my web page using a web browser via the Internet.\nMy opened ports:\nsudo netstat -ntlp\nActive Internet connections (only servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      752/apache2\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:21              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      366/vsftpd\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      454/sshd\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:25              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      611/master\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:27017         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      485/mongod\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:3306          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      599/mysqld\ntcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      454/sshd\ntcp6       0      0 :::25                   :::*                    LISTEN      611/master\n\nI was trying to execute the following commands:\nsudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9000 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9000 -j ACCEPT\n\nBut it didn't help me. \nMoreover, the /etc/iptables.rules file is missing, so I couldn't save changes using the following command:\niptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\nCould you help me please?\nThanks.\n\nA: Give this a try\nsudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 --dport 9000 -j ACCEPT\n\nTo make the change permanent\niptables-save > /etc/iptables.conf # Save this changes to file\ntouch /etc/network/if-up.d/iptables # Create file to call conf from\necho \"iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.conf\" >> /etc/network/if-up.d/iptables # Add this line to this file\nchmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/iptables  # Make the script executable\n\nOriginal Source\n\nA: If you don't see port 9000 with command netstat in listening you app not running or maybe is better to say, your server do not expect connection on that port.\n", "Q: How can I disable screensaver in Ubuntu 14.04 with icewm How can I disable screensaver?\nI tried xset s off, but it's not working.\n\nA: Launch terminal using Ctrl + Alt + T and run these command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver idle-activation-enabled false\n\n", "Q: Local website reachable in chrome, not in firefox I created a virtual host in Apache called rwlocaties.dev listening on any address.\nIn /etc/hosts I added:\n127.0.0.1 rwlocaties.dev\n\nIn Chrome I can browse to rwlocaties.dev and use the website as intended but on Firefox, I cannot use it somehow?

So I attempted to dual boot ubuntu 14.04 and windows 8.1 on my new laptop (aorus x3 plus v3) and it REALLY ruined it. Essentialy broke my new £2000 laptop. I followed this guide (because for some reason ubuntu wouldn't detect windows 8.1, I now realise this may be because I didn't disable secure boot) http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2014/05/install-ubuntu-1404-alongside-windows.html?m=1\nSo partitioning my hard drive reduced my storage capacity greatly. In the first partitioning step in the tutorial I roughly gave half my storage capacity to each OS (I have dual 256Gb ssds). Then in that last step where you partition the free space in the 'other options' I gave the same as in the tutorial, and my RAM was 16Gb so I doubled it and took it away for the switch space. So on and so forth, but when I finally clicked install ubuntu it came up with a weird error. It was just a message box labelled ???? with the contents as ???? ????. I clicked close and it took me back to the list of installation options. I tried other options again but I couldn't find those partitions I had created or the free space I had created it with.\nSo I got sick of it and just went for deleting the other OS, but when I select my timezone that same crazy error comes up and won't let me continue. Sadly, this is AFTER windows was deleted, so now my laptop now has no OS, and a REALLY screwed up hard drive. \nBy the way, I am an ubuntu user, but this is the first time I have tried to dual boot.\nIf someone can actually help me unscrew this then I will be really surprised but any advice is appreciated. (P.s: unlike in the tutorial above, I created an Ubuntu USB on my other computer that runs ubuntu with the disk creator in 14.04)\n\nA: There is some missing information in your question that makes it ambiguous.\n1) IF the version of windows is OEM (as in the windows disk is made by dell or hp or whatever) than Install Windows first (one the whole disk)- then use windows dskmgr to shrink the filesystem / partition down -  create empty/unused space and make the ufi/uefi partition just a little bit larger - not sure what the max is, it is easy to look up tho - Then install Ubuntu in the unused space and put the ubuntu ufi/uefi file in the same partition as the windows one. The installer will automatically setup your mount points and swap space in the empty space you designated.\n2) IF the version of windows is NOT an OEM (as in you have a genuine micr0$0ft disk) than you can and should use ubuntu/gparted to setup your partitions - (windows system partition / ubuntu system partition / UFI/UEFI boot partition / shared free space partition / win space part / ubuntu space part) as an idea - really however you want it. - necessary partitions tho is win part - ubuntu part - ufi/uefi part. - the installers will make their own mount points and swap spaces within the space you designated for each system.\nI understand that you have gone through with the install already - however if you want to start over the above should give you a better jumping off point.\nOnce both systems are installed GRUB2 needs to be able to manage the UFI/UEFI primarily (NOT Windows) - Anytime micr0$0ft updates my laptop (dual booted with Ubuntu studio 14.04 and win 8.1) and corrupts my grub I use this tool - \nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/boot-repair/home/Home/\nI just created a bootable USB with the image and keep it in my collection - Honestly, I just run the \"recommended repair\" and follow the steps - sometimes a couple times - and it does the trick \nhope this helps!!\n\nA: Bleach it clean\nSimplest way to start again... boot your USB stick, open a terminal, and\n\n\n*\n\n*Work out which drive is the main drive\n\n*Wipe it with zeroes (you only need to do a few seconds worth to wipe the partition table)\nsudo fdisk -l <-- Look at the output of this to find the disk that matches the HD\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=<the disk> bs=32M\nWhat this does\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo elevates the privileges to root because you need that to write to raw disk devices\n\n*dd was originally \"dupe disk\" but it's just a very powerful raw copy utility\n\n*/dev/zero is a special file on Linux that is just an infinite pool of zeroes - here we're using as the if or input file\n\n*Replace <the disk> with the right device identifier, e.g. /dev/sda\nBeware - the dd command is powerful and can write to raw disk devices when running as root.

Everything works...but the performance of rendering on the external (right) monitor is terrible. So bad I can hardly use my external monitor without getting very frustrated all the time. The experience on the builtin laptop monitor is however perfect as before, strangely when using the virtual configuration; If the window is put the first screen interaction is very snappy - if it gets placed on the second interaction is very sluggish. Same problem even in mirrored mode. Then the rendering happens about 100 ms after the builtin all the time. I'm sensing some software rendering (buffering) problem. Same problem occurs in XFCE. Is the current XServer not up for the job? If so I would really like to try to configure my system to use a separate XScreen on my external monitor. \nBut...I've tried searching through the dialogs of NVIDIA X Server Settings (sudo nvidia-settings) but nowhere can I find any information about how to change the screen configuration. Previously this could be changed by clicking on \"Advanced...\" in the \"X Server Dispaly Configuration\".

I have a similar setup (ASUS NX500 running Ubuntu 15.10 with NVIDIA 352.41, and my external monitor is an ASUS PB287Q (same as yours)). The only difference is that I'm running the external monitor from the display port, and I get excellent performance out of the external display. When I first bought the ASUS PB287Q and connected it using HDMI I had major lag issues (30 fps external) but that was under Windows 8.1... I switched to display port and it fixed it in windows. When I upgraded to Ubuntu 15.10 from Windows I never had any issues with performance of the external display.\n", "Q: How do I make a window transparent in KDE?

The first HDD is /dev/sda, the second HDD is /dev/sdb and so on, while partitions are numbered starting with 1, so HDD1, partition 1 is called /dev/sda1. You understand the system?\nThat way you should be able to determine which name your E: partition from Windows has in Ubuntu.\nIf you don't know how your drives are partitioned, use the GUI program gparted (requires admin password) or the terminal output of lsblk or sudo parted -l (requires admin password) to display that information.

Please give some step by step guideline to install php5.3.29.  \n\nA: You are asking for a typical LAMP stack installation.\nThere is a good guide offered by Digital Ocean here.\nIf you want an older version of PHP, check this answer.\n\nA: Essentially, you're asking how to set up a LEMP stack - nginx, php5-fpm, and mysql-server.\nHere's a good guide on how to install everything.  Essentially, just run this command:\nsudo apt-get install nginx nginx-full php5-fpm php5-mysql mysql-server\n\nThis installs all the relevant servers and software.  With one exception from your initial question.\n\nI mentinoed an exception.  This will install PHP version 5.5.9+dfsg-1ubuntu4.11.  This is PHP 5.5.9, not PHP 5.3.x.  There is a good reason for this:  PHP 5.3 is an old, obsolete, and security-holed software.  There are no more security updates, and there are unpatched exploits in the older software of 5.3 at times.  To that end, though, even though the security team tries to provide patches, you should be using the more updated, more often patched 5.5.x and newer versions.\nUnless you have a VERY specific reason to have PHP 5.3.x, you should not install it, and use 5.5.x or newer (basically, what's in the repositories for your version of Ubuntu).\n\nThe answer suggested by animo is a good one to get the older PHP version, but with the second answer there.  The only problem is, you lose the benefit of security updates put in place by the Ubuntu Security Team on a regular basis for PHP5 by deviating from the repositories and manually installing the older version, so for security reasons you should not do that.\n", "Q: Error wiping newly created partition /dev/sdb1 I know this may possibly a duplicate but i tried a lot of things to solve this error.

How to solve it?\n\nA: The most likely reason for the error message is that there is a directory called /dev/sdb1 preventing the creation of the device node for accessing that partition.\nI'm guessing that in the past you accidently created this directory as a mount point under /dev.  You can check if you have with:\nls -ld /dev/sdb1\n\nIf the first character is d, you did, and you need to delete or move this directory elsewhere.\nsudo mv /dev/sdb1 /tmp\n\nIf you get the error message:\nmv: cannot move ‘/dev/sdb1’ to ‘/tmp/sdb1’: Device or resource busy\n\nthen something is still mounted there.  In which case mount | grep sdb1 to find out what it is, then try again with:\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\nsudo mv /dev/sdb1 /tmp\n\nIt will now be able to create the device file when you next reconnect your flash drive, and should be able to create and format the first partition on that drive.\n\nA: This is how i solved my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format my pendrive\n\n*Restart the system (I really don't know what is the basic fundamental behind restarting the system but it helped me.)\n\n*It shows Mounted pendrive. so format it again and create a new partition with FAT filesystem - but with this i am not able to create folder. \n\n*So format it again and create partition with NTFS filesystem and it worked.\n\n", "Q: I cannot get in my drives I have Windows 8.1 running on my laptop and installed ubuntu on it 3 days before - now when i shut down windows and switch to ubuntu cannot open my drives .\nit says windows still using my drives so it cannot mount it .\nCheck the image i attached . . .\nAttached photo\n\nA: First you should disable fast startup option in Windows 8.1 , which is a feature that speed up windows booting .\nAs the Picture : \n\nUncheck Turn on fast startup and try again .\nSource : Link\n", "Q: pip install virtualenv, error on ubuntu 15.04 How to fix this issue? and how to install pip and virtualenv on ubuntu 15.04\n pip install virtualenv\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"/usr/bin/pip\", line 9, in <module>\n        load_entry_point('pip==1.5.6', 'console_scripts', 'pip')()\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 521, in load_entry_point\n        return get_distribution(dist).load_entry_point(group, name)\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 2632, in load_entry_point\n        return ep.load()\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 2312, in load\n        return self.resolve()\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 2318, in resolve\n        module = __import__(self.module_name, fromlist=['__name__'], level=0)\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/__init__.py\", line 74, in <module>\n        from pip.vcs import git, mercurial, subversion, bazaar  # noqa\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/vcs/mercurial.py\", line 9, in <module>\n        from pip.download import path_to_url\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/download.py\", line 25, in <module>\n        from requests.compat import IncompleteRead\n    ImportError: cannot import name IncompleteRead\n\n\nA: Did you recently install the latest version of the python-package requests?\nThat one is incompatible with the old pip version shipped with Ubuntu!\nYou need to reinstall the current version of pip and everything will be fine:\nsudo easy_install pip\n\nOr if you have those issues with Python3:\nsudo easy_install3 pip\n\nYou should always keep your python packages up to date with the current versions from PyPI (using pip or its ancestor easy_install while pip is broken) instead of using apt-get, as the Ubuntu repositories are pretty much behind the state of art. \nUse sudo pip install --upgrade INSERTNAMEOFPYTHONPACKAGEHERE for every package you use to get an up-to-date environment.\n", "Q: Unable to compile Broadcom wireless driver on kernel 4.x update I can not manage to get the wifi works when updating my kernel to 4.x.\nDuring the installation, the Broadcom wireless driver failed to compile.\nI am getting this error :\n\nError!

I'm building my software into a deb package using the standard devscripts, and I would like to use dch to automatically increment the release number for non-source code changes (i.e. packaging changes and patches), as it is common in Linux distributions.\nFor example: the source release is 1.0.0 and I'm packaging the software as 1.0.0-1 (the first packaged release of version 1.0.0). Now I discovered a bug in the packaging (for example, a configuration file was not marked as such), so I want to release package version 1.0.0-2.\nInitially I though that dch -i is ideal for this, but apparently it increments from 1.0.0-1 to 1.0.0-1ubuntu1 :-( . I've looked hard into what other command line options I can use, but all I could find was options to use a different suffix (e.g. --rebuild will add buildX).\nMush I edit the release number manually every time?\n\nA: To release 1.0.0-2 you need to use the -U option, see dch man page:\n   --upstream, -U\n          Don't append distro-name1 to the version on a derived          \n          distribution.

Whether I set PrintMotd to \"no\" or \"yes\" in the  etc/ssh/ directory under sshd_config as long as I have a \"motd\" file under in etc/ it gets printed twice.\nIs there a different file that I need to edit that got messed up somewhere?\n\nA: For me it was two places causing motd to be displayed twice:\n1) pam.d & 2) sshd itself\nTo start fixing it:\n~> cd /etc/pam.d/\n~> grep -i motd *\nand then editing /etc/pam.d/sshd (may differ from version to version so confirm with grep output) and hash out these two lines:\nsession    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic\n session    optional     pam_motd.so noupdate\nMy /etc/ssh/sshd_config also had #PrintMotd=yes (default is yes so it was active even if it was #'d out)\n\nIn the end I set /etc/ssh/sshd_config MOTD option to PrintMotd=no (not removed the # and set to no to replace the default) and enabled the /etc/pam.d/sshd motd lines so the /etc/ssh/sshd_config option printlastlog=yes will print the last login information after the pam.d motd is displayed.\nPam will also use the options in /etc/update-motd.d/ to customise the /etc/motd as well which sshd will not do as it will simply display what is already there.\n\nA: As a fix I commented out session    optional     pam_motd.so in the sshd file which is found under etc/pam.d.\nIf there is a more proper solution to replace mine please post it as well.\n\nA: As @Leb pointed out, there's also a pam_motd.so entry to print the /etc/motd file, so you should pick one of either telling sshd to print it via the PrintMotd yes option, or using pam_motd.\nSince pam_motd is used by default for both dynamic and static chunks of the message on Ubuntu, you're probably better off disabling the additional sshd printing of the message by setting PrintMotd no in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n", "Q: Build Essentials Good morning everyone, the long and short of it is I'm setting up an interdomain IRC server for my company.

I'm using ubuntu touch on MX4. 15.04 r2. I use the calendar app, this one is up to date. I can't seem to turn off calendar notifications for events on my calendar. I've looked in system settings and in app settings, but can't find any related settings. Each event has reminder settings, these are turned off. Still I get reminders (So at full volume, also in the middle of the night). Since reminders don't linger in the notification area, I can't even see which events they are for, and I haven't figured out how long in advance they notify.

My main question is: is there any reason to keep my AMD HD 7850 running on this computer?\nMy motherboard has VGA/HDMI connectors.\nWill any application, OS, Ubuntu, or the system use the GPU to process any data?\n\nA: Yes if the server generates or, for instance, re-sizes images. Software that uses, or could use, the existing graphic card for such tasks, is not unheard of. \nSurely, this depends a lot on what kind of software, what kind of GPU, is the suitable driver available and things the like.\n\nA: Graphics cards help with:\n\n\n*\n\n*CUDA/OpenCL style workloads (eg bitcoin mining)\n\n*3D rendering. You might be rendering stuff on demand.\n\n*Most cards can help with video decoding but this applies to many IGPs too.\n\n*Some cards have hardware to help with video encoding. The quality is usually a lot poorer and this is still under development. ffmpeg can use nvenc (obviously on a Nvidia card). I'm not sure if this applies to you.\n\n\nAlmost everything else will only go through the CPU. If you're not doing any of the above (in a way that uses the GPU) you might as well pull the card.\nBut hang on a second, you can also play games on Ubuntu. The AMD drivers are occasionally infuriating, but that's potentially an option. If you're planning on running a media centre, your onboard graphics might be enough but we use a low-end Nvidia card to help in ours.\n", "Q: Terminal to boot from USB?

Lenovo and G500.\nhow it can be done through Terminal.\n\nA: What you need to do is as following:\nOpen a terminal (hotkey is Ctrl + Alt + T).\nNext, use any editor you favor to edit the following files (I use vi because I like it, but you can use anything else, such as gedit):\nsudo vi /etc/hostname\n\nThere you will see your current hostname, just change it to whatever you like the new machine name to be, save the file and quit.\nNext, you will also need to edit /etc/hosts file, as following:\nsudo vi /etc/hosts\n\nLocate the entry in the file that contains your current hostname and change it to the new hostname. The IP address should remain unchanged!\nDon't forget to save your changes.\nNote that in some cases, especially when you're using a static IP address, you might have more than one entry containing your machine hostname. In such case make sure to change all relevant entries.\nAnd last but not least, you must immediately change your hostname itself since your machine is loading the hostname only during boot time from the /etc/hostname file. You can do this by typing:\nsudo hostname <New Hostname>\n\nHit Enter and you're done!\n\nLenov is your username. To change this, you should follow this answer.\nHope this helps :-)\n\nA: Use the command\nhostnamectl -P set-hostname new.hostname.here\n\nto write to the /etc/hostname file and update the stored in-memory hostname at the same time.\n(Note: If you put sudo in front of that command, you can omit the -P flag. The -P option tells hostnamectl to use PolicyKit to elevate privileges, which can automatically choose between prompting your password in the terminal or using a GUI.)\nThen, you need to add it to /etc/hosts, with:\nsudoedit /etc/hosts\n\nadding (or editing) an entry from the new hostname to 127.0.0.1:\n127.0.0.1     localhost\n127.0.0.1     new.hostname.here\n\n\nA: Try sudo gedit /etc/hostname and you can edit it from there, if you don't want to leave the terminal window you can change it with sudo nano /etc/hostname You will also need to modify sudo gedit /etc/hosts to get rid of \"@G500\"\n", "Q: Vim in shell allows [a-z] to circumvent having to press  to get out of INSERT mode.

Let's breakdown the code:\n\n\n*\n\n*perl \nThe Perl language interpreter\n\n*-MMIME::Base64\nEncoding and decoding of base64 strings\n\n*-0777ne\n-0777 - Changes the line separator to undef, letting us to slurp the file, feeding all the lines to Perl in one go.\n-e - (execute) flag is what allows us to specify the Perl code we want to run right on the command line.\n-n - Feed the input to Perl line by line.\n\n*'print decode_base64($_)' - Decodes a string, the string is saved in $_.\n\n*\"ZWNobyAnQk9PSCEnCg==\" - And this? What is this?\nLet's start a test.\nWe know, it's something like base64 and it looks encoded. Therefore decode the string with:\nbase64 --decode <<< \"ZWNobyAnQk9PSCEnCg==\"\n\nAnd the output is … ok, not really dangerous:\necho 'BOOH!'\n\nNow, we can do the same with perl\nperl -MMIME::Base64 -0777ne 'print decode_base64($_)' <<< \"ZWNobyAnQk9PSCEnCg==\"\n\nAnd the output is, what a surprise:\necho 'BOOH!'\n\nBut was it dangerous?

And yes, it's hard for beginners to tell the difference.\nNumber one, make sure the instructions are for your version of ubuntu.  Non lts releases only last for 9 months or so.  Blog posts last a lot longer.  And what worked for older releases often don't on newer ones.\nAlso, don't do it if they don't explain how to undo the changes if it doesn't work and you don't know how.\nMany blogs tell you to install from a 3rd party ppa, even when the app is in the ubuntu repos.  None of that stuff is beta tested for your kernel release.  I don't have any ppa's in my software sources and won't unless it's really necessary.\n\nA: Try looking at multiple blogs which address a certain issue. There may be details that one blog addresses but another does not. I would also suggest you keep a log of the changes you make in case you need to revert them in the future. And if something comes to worse, you can always reset Ubuntu to its default configuration.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on a Non-Ubuntu Linux without USB/CD?

The installer does not create a desktop icon (...) and further more, when I try deploying my files to my xampp (lampp) installation, I get an error. I guess this is due to permission denied.\nSo I read on a intellij installation site, to start intellij as root user. This is a bit confusing, is this acutally a really good idea?

If your IDE can't write to where you need it to, the way to go is probably to fix permissions on that folder or subtree. \nE. g. if the target folder is writable for a certain group, the easiest way would be to add your everyday user to that group. Maybe you would have to first set group write permissions. But that might be unsafe for other reasons. Which permission settings to use depends strongly on your environment, so it's difficult to give you any advice with the information we have. \nAlso, if you want someone to give you a hand with the desktop icon, please explain a little bit about your system (Gnome, KDE, XFCE...?). \n\nA: Creating desktop entey for intellij is quite simple just go to just go to the intellij directory via the terminal then type: sh idea.sh. After it has loaded go to the Tools menu and select Create Desktop Entry. For permissions just go to the web directory via terminal and issue the command: sudo chmod -R 777, provide your root password and you will be good to go.\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 8.1 Is it possible to dual boot both Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8.1 without conflict? I have Windows 8.1 installed on a 120 GB SSD with a 2TB HDD for mass storage. I also have a 1TB HDD with Ubuntu 14.04 installed. When I want to boot into Ubuntu I disconnect both my Windows drives and connect my Ubuntu drive. I would like to have all of them connected all the time so I can switch boot drives in BIOS without having to physically connect/reconnect my drives. Will doing so cause any issues? \nThanks :)\n\nA: Yes, it is possible. Since you've Windows 8.1 already installed, just start the installer of Ubuntu and proceed. It should detect Windows 8.1 and offer an option to install Ubuntu too.\n\nA: One of the function keys F8, F10, F11, or F12 should give you the boot menu options when the machine is booting up. Just pick the right disk and it should boot the OS on that disk. You might have to set the bios to allow for on-the-fly boot disk selection, it can be disabled sometimes.\nSince you have the OSs installed on two separate disks, then the BIOS boot menu is probably your best bet. You might have to memorize some identification information for the hard drives in order to pick the right one on boot.\nIf you pick the wrong disk (the one with no OS) it will just error something like 'no bootable disk selected', and you just reboot and pick another.\nI'm pretty sure that the grub (either windows or linux grubs) will not be functional because of the separate disks. However, I cannot confirm this.\n", "Q: How will this terminal command affect my partitions? I recently posted a question asking about how to fix a complicated problem with my laptop after partitioning my hard drive.\nThe problem is here -How do I undo those partitions I made for dual booting?\n-but long story short I'm considering just wiping everything and starting again. Someone offered me this advice:\nSimplest way to start again... boot your USB stick, open a terminal, and\nWork out which drive is the main drive\nWipe it with zeroes (you only need to do a few seconds worth to wipe the partition table)\nsudo fdisk -l <-- Look at the output of this to find the disk that matches the HD\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of= bs=32M\nWhat this does\nsudo elevates the privileges to root because you need that to write to raw disk devicesdd was originally \"dupe disk\" but it's just a very powerful raw copy utility/dev/zero is a special file on Linux that is just an infinite pool of zeroes - here we're using as the ifor input fileReplace  with the right device identifier, e.g. /dev/sda\nBeware - the dd command is powerful and can write to raw disk devices when running as root. This means you can wipe any drive connected to the machine - including the USB thumb you're using as a boot disk. Check the output of fdisk very carefully to make sure which disk you want to wipe.\nI would just put on a comment but I need an answer somewhat urgently so if I followed this advice, would this erase partitions that I foolishly created, giving me the storage back? Because in short, I halved my hard drive space between windows and left the rest for ubuntu but I messed up and spread around (lost) the free space and so forth. Will this command (or any command or program I can run from live usb, I have NO OS) reset my hard drive so it was like it was when I bought the laptop (sans windows)? Please is there any solution that won't damage my hard drive or reduce space/performance? Nothing like DBAN please.\nThis is a pretty tall order I know but any help is appreciated.\n\nA: I would recommend using GParted since you will have a visual cue of what is going on. In GParted, you will have list of partitions on a particular disk. You can make your preferred changes to a disk or partition and apply those changes when done.\nI read your other question and it seems there might be a problem with the bootable USB you created.

Currently I have to be physically present at the machine to enter in the passphrase to mount the volume. \nI imagine there might be a way to set up some kind of autorunning script that runs during boot that can enter in the password for me, and then deletes this script.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Perhaps this will help?

How do I recover? In the process of upgrading from Utopic Unicorn to Vivid Vervet, do-release-upgrade asked me which version of a configuration file to keep. I chose the option to run a (root) shell, noticed there were only a few small changes, and ran vim to merge the two versions. I'm used to using Ctrl+C to finish inserts, but it seems that in this case that actually killed something, as I was returned to one of my own shells.\nAfter a bit of investigation, I noticed that the vim instance was somehow still running. I killed it and was returned to the root shell I'd started it from. I then exited the root shell, expecting to be returned to the upgrade script, but instead, the tmux instance I ran it in exited.\nAt this point, I can see that the script is still running and presumably doing something (it seems to consistently have 11% CPU usage). Unlike some cases similar to mine, there is no screen or byobu instance to reattach to—in fact, according to ps, it's lost its controlling terminal.\nWhat happened here, and what should I do return my system to a sane state and complete the upgrade?\n\nA: Copy-paste from server fault:\n\nAFAICT, there was no way to reattach to the upgrade process. However,\n  it wasn't a disaster at all. I killed the hanging dpkg process, and\n  then ran dpkg --configure -a. This walks you through reconfiguring all\n  packages already installed on the system, tidying up any problems\n  whilst it does so. After that, I used aptitude to upgrade the\n  remaining packages, which had already been downloaded, but hadn't been\n  installed or configured.\n\nCourtesy: https://serverfault.com/q/387547/109361\nUpdate:\nIf aptitude is not installed in your system, then the same can be done using apt-get, as I understand.\nThis is what worked for the OP:\n\nThe upgrade script had already changed the sources in\n  /etc/apt/sources.list from Utopic to Vivid and disabled all the\n  third-party sources. After dpkg --configure --pending and apt-get install --fix-broken, did apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgrade,\n  and then rebooted, everything seems like it's working now.\n\nMore Info:\nFrom the related bug report, doing apt-get dist-upgrade seems to be the key to get things working properly.\n", "Q: Ubuntu froze, then after poweroff it will not start⠀⠀⠀⠀ Yesterday I was playing a game on my laptop, and by mistake I opened a webpage and my laptop froze.

Is there a way to disable them under directory structures in Nautilus? My Django-project is getting quite confusing with them.\n\nA: For Django, the quickest way might be to stop generating them in the first place.\nNow, that might sound like a terrible idea... Bytecode precompilation is what makes Python as fast as it is so it's definitely something you want in production, but we can disable bytecode generation just for things run through manage.py.\nOpen it up and add a sys.dont_write_bytecode = True line. It should look something like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nsys.dont_write_bytecode = True\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"ap.settings\")\n\n    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\n\n    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n\nWarning: ap.settings is specific to my project, not yours, and the layout of the file may be different in your version of Django... Be careful if you copy the whole thing!\nProduction uses (like through a wsgi server) should skip over manage.py and still generate the bytecode files, but in development —where you're more likely to use ./manage.py runserver— should stay clean.\nThis will slow things down a little though.\n\nOh and to clean up:\n# Python 2\nfind /path/to/project -name '*.pyc' -type f -delete\n\n# Python 3\nfind /path/to/project -name '__pycache__' -exec rm -rf {} +\n\nBe aware that both these statements delete files, so you might want to check them (remove the -delete or -exec ... statements) before running this hot. They'll just show you what files match.\n", "Q: Setting Compose Key in MATE How do I set up the Compose Key on Ubuntu Mate 15.04?\nI tried System -> Preferences -> Other -> Keyboard Shortcut, but I can't find anything there.\n\nA: On my machine (a Dell laptop) runing Ubuntu 20.4 with a Mate 1.24 desktop, the following works:  go to\nSystem -> Control Centre -> Keyboard ->\nLayout -> Options\nScroll down to Position of Compose Key; click on the black on-its-side triangle at the left.  Choose the compose key.  \"Left Win\" seems to me to be sensible since this key will almost surely not be used for other purposes.\nMany of the other options (e.g. \"3rd level of Caps Lock\") are incomprehensible to me or\n(e.g. \"Menu\") do not appear on my keyboard.\n", "Q: Nothing comes up when I try to change the SSH port I'm trying to change the port number, and I've found a few answers on here from the past, most saying that you should use the following code.\nnano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nor\nmodify /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nThe modify one (for me) comes back with a \"Does not exist\"/\"Nothing found\", and nano brings me back a blank page when people are saying it should have port numbers. Am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: If the file comes up as blank when trying to edit using nano then the file is being created, as it doesn't already exist. This can also happen if you mis-type the filename.\nTo check whether the file is there:\ncd /etc/ssh\n\nFollowed by:\nls -lh\n\nThis will output a list of files in the /etc/ssh directory.\nIf the file doesn't exist, then you may need to reinstall, try:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n\nA: Here's how you set up ssh.\nYou already have a ssh client with which you can connect to other machines. But if you want other systems to connect to you, you must install a ssh server like this:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nOnce you did that, edit your ssh congiuration file to change the port:\nsudoedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nHere nano is a command line based text editor. You should change Port 22 to the port which you want. To exit the editor, press Ctrl + X\nFinally you need to restart the ssh daemon for the changes to reflect, so on 14.10 or older:\nsudo service ssh restart\n\nOr if you're running Ubuntu 15.04 or later,\nsudo systemctl restart sshd.service\n\nThat's it!\n", "Q: Ubuntu.iso - how to use it?

Telephone support\ngives you access to engineers with first-hand experience of your\nissues, while the online portal lets you track the progress of cases\nin real time.\n\nBest source I have found:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/legal/ubuntu-advantage/service-description, actually describes some scope of support and helps a little, but still is not explanatory enough to answer my questions.\nThose of you who actually are customers of Canonical and have Ubuntu Advantage 24/7 support first hand experience, can you please explain how their support works?\n\n*\n\n*What exactly is the scope of the 24/7 support, what am I paying for?\n\n*Is the support team going to help me with my server related problem over the phone real time or how long is the usual response time?\n\n*Does it include support for applications like LAMP Stack, Bind9, Postfix, and other commonly used server applications?\n\n*Does it include support for stuff like hardware issues, RAID troubleshooting, performance and configuration issues?\n\n*Yes or No answer, so it is not very opinion based: Were you satisfied with support, did the support team help you solve your\nproblems?\n\n*Do you get a phone number in Europe for European customers or Skype, so my phone bill is less than the support fee?\n\n*Any other observations and factual information and fist hand experience is welcome.\n\n\nThis question is broad, I know, but I do not want to ask every piece of this question separately, because these questions and possible answers belong together. I checked for duplicate questions already asked on this topic, similar questions do not ask the same thing I am asking here.\n\nA: The best information I have been able to find about the program is this. It seems to spell out in detail the level of service as well as the response times you can expect for varying levels of severity. Certified hardware is of course better supported.\nHopefully someone with personal experience can provide you with a better answer.\n", "Q: Cannot open local files using Gedit over SSH I tried to start gedit on one of my servers by running: `ssh test@test-server gedit and it runs, but it displays the filesystem of my server and not my local system. \nHow can I get gedit to show my local filesystem?\n\nA: What you want to do there is not possible.\nYou are probably using an X11 forward and here you need to understand, that the process of Gedit itself starts on the server, and its only a projection of the application that you see (like a video on youtube, with the only difference that this one responds to your actions). For this particular reason it no wonder that you aren't able to see your local files.\nThere is a workaround, but it also doesn't do exactly what you want to achieve.\nYou could make a reverse tunnel to your local machine, and then use sshfs to bind one of your local folders (or the entire filesystem) on the remote server.\nOn your local host:\nssh -R 2222:localhost:22 user@remotehost\n\nOn the remote host:\nsshfs -o port=2222 localhost:/path/on/your/pc /path/to/bind/folder/on/server \n\nThis might be confusing, but what it does is as follows:\nYou make a reverse ssh tunnel from your local pc to the remote server. After that you connect to your pc from the remote server through that tunnel, to get to your data you want to edit with gedit.\nSo now we know this works, but I beg you not to use it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu is using a proxy although it's disabled in the settings I have a problem with the proxy settings in Xubuntu 14.04 32-bit.

I am writing a script which requires to store the value of a variable. This value will be used the next time the script is run. First I thought of storing it in a file. Then this crazy idea came into my mind. Can I make a variable in such a way that if I store a value in it, close the terminal and open another one, the value is still there?\nCan I make a shell variable fully global, as in accessible everywhere? \n\nA: There is no \"global environment variable space\". If you want to make your data persistent, then you need to store it in some file. Example:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Path to the persistent storage file\nfile=~/name.txt\n\n# If the persistent file exists, use its contents as name\nif [ -e \"$file\" ]; then\n    name=$(cat \"$file\")\nelse\n    # Use a default value otherwise\n    name=\"Bob\"\nfi\n\necho \"Your name was: $name\"\necho \"What is your name?\"\nread new_name\n\n# If a new (non-empty) name is given, save it to the file\nif [ -n \"$new_name\" ]; then\n    echo \"$new_name\" > \"$file\"\nfi\n\nIf you want to make a variable available to every new process, then you can put it in /etc/environment (requires root privileges) or ~/.profile. Once you put it in these variables, you typically have to re-login. Unless it is absolutely necessary, I recommend against this approach. It puts the contents in the memory of every (new) process, so it is not suitable for storing passwords or large values.\n\nCan I make a variable in such a way that if I store a value in it,\n  close the terminal and open another one, the value is still there?\n\nWell, if you only want to expose the values to interactive shell sessions, then you can put it in your ~/.bashrc. Try it, append echo \"Hello $USER\" to the file. It will be executed every time you open a new shell. It will not be executed for graphical logins and such due to a line such as:\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\n[ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return\n\n", "Q: When exiting Byobu, close all non-exited vim sessions I have configured Byobu to open a dozen text files at startup:\nnew-session -n memo /home/nico/bin/vim-my-memo.sh;\nnew-window -n client1 /home/nico/bin/vim-client1.sh;\n[...]\n\nIt works well, but closing all vim sessions whenever I need to shut down my computer would take too much time, so I close the whole Byobu by clicking on the red X button at the upper left.\nPROBLEM: When I reopen Byobu, all vim sessions are showing:\nE325: ATTENTION\nFound a swap file by the name \"~/.memo.txt.swp\"\n          owned by: nico   dated: Fri Jul 17 21:18:38 2015\n         file name: ~nico/memo.txt\n          modified: no\n         user name: nico   host name: nico\n        process ID: 21813 (still running)\nWhile opening file \"/home/nico/memo.txt\"\n             dated: Fri Jul 17 21:08:32 2015\n\n(1) Another program may be editing the same file.

For ipv4 it can done by adding option routers <gateway-addr> inside subnet. But what needs to be added for ipv6 configuration?\n\nA: tl;dr\nDHCPv6 does not support options to set routers/gateways.\nDetails\nIPv6 works in many ways differently from IPv4. It is not simply an enlarged address space.\nIPv6 is designed to heavily utilize stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC). In turn, this relies on router- and dhcp advertisement.\nWith IPv6 each interface is potentially assigned two addresses.\n\n*\n\n*A link-local address with prefix fe80::/64 is generated from the interfaces identifier (MAC address). Those addresses are never routed and thus valid only on the local LAN segment. In the absence of a router and/or DHCP server, they enable communication of machines on a LAN, very similiar to IPv4 autoconf addresses 169.254.0.0/16. But their primary use is autoconfiguration.\n\n\n*A global unicast address, which can be obtained in two ways (router or dhcp). Having configured a link-local address, the client sends out a Router Solicitation to the multicast address ff02::2 (all routers on the segment). In a SLAAC setting, any router on the network answers with a Router Advertisement (RA) containing available prefixes. In a home setting, there is usually one router advertising the prefix assigned by the ISP. A client receiving a RA, configures its global address using an available prefix and sets its gateway accordingly. All other options like DNS server, domain suffix, etc. should be configured via DHCPv6. This makes DHCP very simple, since it need not maintain a lease database, but simply hand out further options. Note however, that the default gateway is not one of them.\nBecause for some settings, address assignment by SLAAC is too loose, one may also hand out global addresses via DHCPv6. This is called stateful address configuration. In that case, the router does not advertise a prefix, but sends a \"managed\" flag, signaling the client to ask a DHCP server for an address. This approach is closer to how DHCPv4 works.\nStill, the DHCPv6 server does not hand out routers! Gateways are still obtained from RAs.\nThere was a IETF draft \"DHCPv6 Route Options\" specifying exactly the options you are looking for, but is expired and never made to an RFC.\nConcerning dedicated DHCP for DNS config:\nA conventional IPv6 setting requires either DHCPv6 to hand out DNS information, or configuring DNS manually. The proposed RFC6106 presents an alternative, by specifying further RA options. Specifically:\n\n*\n\n*DNS Search List (DNSSL) - the domain search list and\n\n*Recursive DNS server (RDNSS) - a list of DNS servers to query\n\nThe popular IPv6 Router Advertising daemon radvd already supports these options. If the clients are able to handle RDNSS (which is the case on e.g most Linux distros, OS X, Windows>=Vista), radvd can substitute for a DHCPv6 server. At least if the dhcp is used only to distribute DNS options. This could commonly be the case in a small scale home network, though may not be sufficient for business environments.\n", "Q: Renaming (.filename) file to original names I'm trying to revert a change I made via rename.\nI was renaming files in a subfolder, then without thinking, tried to clear the .. from names using:\nrename \"s/.././\" *\n\nNow I have a folder of 600 files with the 2 first letters of each filename changed to .zzyGir*\nIs there any way to change the \".\" back to the first letters of each filename without losing the whole file?\nI've tried different things with no luck, such as:\nrename \"s/./Di/; *\n\nI'm open to one-file-at-a-time solutions, too, I'm primarily trying to avoid losing the files.\n\nA: The first two letters are history.

Well, it isn't. The errormessage you present clearly shows that Wine was running in thus particular case. The problem here is that Wine can't find the executable to run.

In a couple of days, I'm going to buy a new notebook (Asus N551, should it matter), tending to replace the HDD with a Samsung EVO 500GB SSD.\nNow, I've often read that one should make sure that Ubuntu uses swap as little as possible, especially avoiding hibernation, to extend SSD life. Is this still relevant these days? I project I won't use this notebook for longer than ~5 years.\n\nA: Depending on how much RAM your system has, you can get away with using very little swap, and even then, your computer will only use swap when it runs out of space in RAM. Obviously, writing to the SSD will shorten its lifespan, but as long as you avoid using utilities that make many small writes (like defragmentation) you should be fine. \nHibernate works by moving all of the data off of the RAM into swap so that the system can quickly resume when you power back on (you need at least as much swap as RAM). In principle, this will degrade SSD lifespan, but definitely not as much as defragging.\nQuantifying how much shorter the lifespan of a SSD is when relying on swap is non-trivial, but I recall reading an article about SSD failure that attempted to see how long a SSD could last under worst case scenarios--the result was that the SSDs lasted longer than expected and failed only after giving good notice.\nI'm relatively confident that having a swap partition size slightly larger than your RAM size is not going to significantly shorten your drive's lifespan unless you are actively trying to cause it to fail--I haven't had a drive fail from usage yet. The stigma against SSD lifespan grew largely in their earlier years, and SSDs have improved significantly since then. Make sure that you do some research on the brand, and compare the different NAND technologies to find the one that will best fit your needs; there is a definite difference between the technologies in terms of lifespan and speed that is weighed against cost.\nTL;DR If you research your SSD and pick a good one, under reasonable use, having a swap partition should not noticeably shorten your SSDs lifespan.\n\nA: Concerns about swap on SSDs are unfounded.  They can handle a good 10,000 writes, so to wear out a 500 GB SSD you would have to write 100 MB / second to it every second for for 578 days.  There is no way you are going to manage to keep it constantly swapping that much for that long, and certainly writing 1-2 gb for hibernation once or twice a day is not going to come close.\n", "Q: Skype not showing in Unity panel I have installed the Ubuntu 12.04 (multiarch) version of Skype from the official Skype website, and yet when I launch it, I cannot see the little Skype icon in the Unity Panel as I have seen it on other machines.

I have only just installed Ubuntu on a Wintel PC. I want to install some downloaded software package, namely Google Chrome, but I have not been successful gaining root privilege. I have seen several questions being answered with the advice to use sudo in Ubuntu, but this doesn't seem to work for me. I always get unable to change to root gid, Operation not permitted.\nWhat steps must I take to allow sudo to work for admin tasks?\n\nA: Firstly, I am assuming that the motivation of your question is to install packages, so correct me if I'm wrong. \nTo run commands a root, you can either execute the commands as the root user, or you can append sudo to the beginning of the command. For most applications, using sudo is safer that being root because, among other things, it will force you to make sure that you know what you're doing. \nTo become root, you can use sudo -i as Michael has commented below, but that shouldn't be necessary to install Google Chrome. To do this, you can simply enter\nsudo apt-get install google-chrome\n\ninto the command line, but if I understand correctly, you either don't have the password or something is messed up that prevents you from using sudo.  \nSince you just got Ubuntu, and presumably haven't made any significant changes, you could try reinstalling from the live CD/USB. During the process, there is a prompt to set a password for the account, which you should definitely do -- this will be the password that you will use when using sudo. No doubt, this will be the easiest way to set up an admin account.\nIf that doesn't work for some reason, or if you are don't want to reinstall, you will probably have to provide more information to get decent answers. You should be able to see what type of account you have (admin or not), and that will tell you if you have sudo permission in the first place. \n", "Q: Ubuntu login screen, ctrl+alt+f1 incorrect password So hi! \nFirst question, which seems to be a big and common problem.

On my laptop, I had Windows 7 Home Premium preinstalled. A year or so ago, I dual-booted it with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. \nI now want to upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10 (it's free, so why not?) when it's released.\nHowever, I'm unsure whether this will affect GRUB and stop me from accessing my Ubuntu partition. I need both operating systems and can't afford to lose either.\nIf this will affect GRUB, how can I restore GRUB so I can access both operating systems?\nThanks in advance.\nEDIT: Just to be clear, I already have a dual-boot set up, where Ubuntu was installed alongside a pre-existing Windows installation. I now want to upgrade Windows (from 7 to 10) but am worried it will affect GRUB and my ability to boot into Ubuntu.\nUPDATE:\nI installed Windows 10 and it ended up leaving GRUB alone. Selecting the Windows 7 option booted me into Windows 10.\n\nA: Short answer: Yes.\nShort solution: After you upgrade, boot into Ubuntu (this will still work) and run this in Terminal:\nsudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nThat's assuming your GRUB installation is on you Ubuntu drive.  If that doesn't work, then it's on your Windows drive, and you'll instead need to run this:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n(replace '/dev/sda' with whatever drive Windows is on; you can see this in the output of the first command)\n", "Q: TRIMming shared partition in dual-boot on SSD In a couple of days, I'm going to buy a new notebook (Asus N551, should it matter), tending to replace the HDD with a Samsung EVO 500GB SSD. I'll set it up in a dual-boot configuration of Windows 8/Ubuntu Trusty. In my workflow, I need to access some data from both OS, so I'm going to create an additional shared partition (NTFS of course), as I did on my current box. Could this situation bear a risk concerning TRIM, i.e. both systems trying to TRIM the partition, causing corruption? And if so, which system should be handling that particular partition? I read that until recently, Ubuntu just couldn't TRIM NTFS partitions, but apparently, that functionality was added some time ago...\nThanks in advance, haemi\n\nA: Currently all Samsung SSDs are blacklisted in the Linux kernel as TRIM used to corrupt the sectors on those SSDs. they are working on this issue with Samsung, though.\nRight now Linuxers should maybe consider buying Intel SSDs instead, as they work flawlessly (atleast they aren't blacklisted).

But in my case I don't pretend to install gnu/linux alongside with win 8. In fact Windows 8 was banished from the hard drive a couple of weeks ago.\nBut I have yet two problems that still remains:\nThe first is a thing called Windows to go that is installed and prevented me from booting from any other media and there was no way or option in the BIOS to disable it.\nThe second one is a warning that appear each time I try to install linux and it's related with EFI, the warning says:\n\nGo back to the menu and correct this problem? (as superuser)\nThe partition table format in use on your disks normally requires you\n  to create a separate partition for boot loader code. This partition\n  should be marked for use as “EFI boot partition” and should be at\n  least 35 MB in size. Note that this is not the same as a partition\n  mounted on /boot.\nIf you do not go back to the partitioning menu and correct this error,\n  boot loader installation may fail later, although it may still be\n  possible to install the boot loader to a partition.\n\nDisclaimer\nI use to install creating manually the partitions within the advanced options menu. I worked doing dual installations since 2008, including some cases with Windows 8 without much problem.\nTherefore I created a new partition with 104 MB formatted in FAT32 for that EFI partition needed besides the common partitions I use to create: /, /home and swap. But the problem remains. \nI can install normally in any case (I tried with Linux Mint 17, 17.2, debian 8 and Ubuntu Studio 14.04 twice). But in the end, when I reboot, always appears this message:\n\nNo bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\n\nI don't know what's wrong. I set up the BIOS for make able the legacy mode and avoid the secure boot from UEFI.\nShould I install automatically instead of create manually the partitions?\n\nA: \nThe partition table format in use on your disks normally requires you to create a separate partition for boot loader code. This partition should be marked for use as “EFI boot partition” and should be at least 35 MB in size. Note that this is not the same as a partition mounted on /boot.\n\nThis is a reference to an EFI System Partition (ESP). As described on the Wikipedia page to which I've linked, this is a FAT partition that has an EFI type code of C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B. Because EFI type codes are so long and ugly, they're normally referred to in other ways in software. GParted and parted both identify them with a \"boot flag\" (which is unrelated to a \"boot flag\" under MBR), and gdisk and its relatives identify them as having a type of EF00. The lack of a type code is probably what's causing your problems.\nNote also that 104MB is rather small for an ESP. I know the text you quoted specifies 35MB as the minimum size, but that's downright tiny. The problem is that some EFIs have bugs that cause such small ESPs to exhibit strange behaviors like files becoming inaccessible. I recommend making your ESP 550MiB in size. This is huge compared to the probable storage needs of the partition, so there's no need to go bigger than this; but it's big enough to avoid EFI bugs, which is the main point of it.\n\nI don't know what's wrong. I set up the BIOS for make able the legacy mode and avoid the secure boot from UEFI.\n\nThe error message you're seeing indicates you're booting in EFI mode, not in BIOS mode. This isn't really surprising; the boot-mode options in most EFIs are vague, and they often function more as suggestions than as commands. That is, enabling the BIOS/CSM/legacy support merely makes it possible for the computer to boot in that mode. Whether it will actually boot in BIOS mode or in EFI mode depends on quite a few factors that you probably don't even know -- things like algorithms in the firmware and details of how your boot medium is laid out. In other words, it's effectively random. It is possible to force a BIOS-mode boot (assuming the computer supports it), but doing this requires a fair amount of expertise. One way is to carefully select the boot option in the computer's built-in boot manager: Pick the option for your installation medium that lacks the string \"UEFI\". This approach doesn't work on all computers, though. Another way is to create a boot medium that lacks the EFI boot loaders (stored in the EFI/BOOT directory on a FAT partition on a USB drive, for instance).\nForcing an EFI-mode boot is usually easier: Disabling the BIOS/CSM/legacy support in the firmware normally does the job. Sometimes it's necessary to create a boot medium without a BIOS boot loader, or tweak the format of the boot medium to satisfy the peculiarities of your EFI.\nIncidentally, Secure Boot is just one optional feature of UEFI. Any x86/x86-64 computer that ships with Windows 8.x is required, by contract with Microsoft, to enable you to disable Secure Boot. It's usually possible to disable Secure Boot and still boot in EFI mode. That's not to say that you should do this, though; Ubuntu works well with Secure Boot on most computers, and the feature can (at least theoretically) improve system security. IMHO, it's worth at least trying to boot with it active.\n", "Q: Trouble increasing Java max heap size I'm very new to Linux (and haven't done much with cmd line in Windows either), and I'm needing to increase my Java heap size to 3GB from 850MB (total of 4GB of RAM on the box).\nI've looked at a couple sites for guidance on increasing my heap size, but none of the commands I've taken from them seem to be working.\nFor reference I've looked at:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change Java Runtime Parameters?\n\n*How to increase JAVA Heap Size?\n\n*Find out your Java heap memory size \n\n*JAVA_OPTS for increasing heap size\nBased on the information in those questions, I've tried the following commands:\njava -Xmx3072m\njava -Xmx3g\njava JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xmx3g\"\nJAVA_OPTS=\"-Xmx3g\"\n\nAfter each I get no errors (except the third command, that one errors), but when I run `\n\nA: Via\njava -Xmx3072m <your_class_name>\n\nor\njava -Xmx3072m -jar <your_jar_file>\n\nor \nJAVA_OPTS=\"-Xmx3G\"\njava \"$JAVA_OPTS\" -jar <your_jar_file>\n\n\nExample\n% java -Xmx80m -XshowSettings:all -jar HelloWorld.jar\n…                  \nVM settings:\n    Max.

Wifi power management seems to mess with my connectivity.  I can turn it off with:\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 power off\n\nBut every time I connect to a network, power management turns back on.  I've searched for solutions, but I've only found ways to make sure power management stays off when you login, reboot, etc.  I think I might be able to sort this out with systemd hooks, but I don't know how that all works.\nHere's what I've got:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 15.04  \n\n*Lenovo thinkpad yoga  \n\n*Intel Wireless 7260  \n\n*driver: iwlwifi  \n\n*kernel version 3.19.0-22-generic\nAny ideas?\nThis is not a duplicate of Why doesn't Ubuntu automatically disable wireless networking when a wired connection is active? , but information from that post was relevant to this.\n\nA: From the comment by @waltinator here's what I did.

In Windows 7, I limited the processor state to 72% to avoid overheating, but it never got this bad, even with it at 100%. I'm using an HPG62-340US, with an ATI Mobility Radeon 4200 graphics card. This isn't the first time I've tried installing Ubuntu on this laptop, and I've had the same problem every time, but no answer I find works for me; it's always \"clean your fan\" or \"apply new thermal paste\" but seeing as how Windows doesn't give me third degree burns then I think that there is a solution that will work for Ubuntu that doesn't require me ripping my computer apart.\n\nA: Wow!!That must be really 'hot'! Sometimes, it could be a process that is using quite a lot of CPU. But, because the fan needs to cool the computer, you could probably hear your fan right?

I have a person who will need access to my SSH server, but I want them to have limited access to programs. All they should be using is ssh, to login to another server. My server is an access point to another server. I don't want this user to run programs other than the ssh program they need to get on the other network. \nIdeally, when they login, they would be redirected to another SSH login, and not have any other immediate option to do anything else.\nNo SSH users have root permissions. \nHow might I be able to set this up?\nI am thinking I can do it with their bashrc files. I'll write a secondary login script that executes when they login. Is there a way for a user to login to an SSH server, and ignore their bashrc file on login?\nIs there a better way I should consider?\n\nA: You thought to edit the bashrc file.  I would take a look at limiting their access to all bash commands other than ssh this way they can .  This link has good information.  \nAnother thought is to setup a ssh pass through tunnel without access to a  login.  This link might be useful as well.  This might be easier to configure.  \n\nA: Simply set the user's login shell to a shell script instead of bash or sh containing the ssh syntax to second endpoint. All logins, unless they explicitly define a shell with -s in ssh syntax, would redirect as you requested.\nI can get out of BASHRC limitations by various methods. If you expect them to be malicious make sure they cannot specify alternate shell on login.\nTrap user sigint so they cant Ctrl + C out and check on exit of ssh for exit code 0, otherwise exit completely or retry indefinitely. Your choice.\n\nA: Consider using a ForceCommand directive in sshd_config. For example, I use these to force groups of users to a set of servers:\nMatch Group group1\n       ForceCommand ssh -t group1.fqdn\n\nMatch Group=\"*,!local,!group2,!root\"\n       ForceCommand ssh -t group3.fqdn\n\nYou could use:\nMatch User foo\n    ForceCommand ssh -t target-host\n\n\nA: You can do this somewhat transparently by forcing the user to use a ProxyCommand locally, treating your own server as an SSH bastion host.\nOn your server (the bastion), restrict the user to nc as follows in sshd_config:\nMatch User restricted_usr\n  ForceCommand nc -w 600 restricted_usr_vm 22\n\nOn the client (assuming OpenSSH) in ~/.ssh/config:\nHost myserver\n  ProxyCommand ssh bastion nc -w 600 restricted_usr_vm 22\n\n(Windows users can use ssh proxies via PuTTY by using PuTTY's plink).\nThough, thanks to your ForceCommand, I'm pretty sure the ssh command is ignored; ProxyCommand ssh bastion I am a bannana should have the same effect.  A direct connection (lacking ProxyCommand) from the user will result in a raw SSH dump to restricted_usr_vm.\nAs noted in a comment to another answer here, ForceCommand will make it very hard to manage SSH key access to the bastion host.  I can think of two easy solutions: (1) Install a passwordless SSH key for that user on the bastion that grants access to the target host and have that user's crontab on bastion run scp restricted_usr_vm:.ssh/authorized_keys ~/.ssh/ or (2) Create a web form (like GitHub's) to allow uploading that file.  (3) NFS can also work, but I'm not so fond of it because the .ssh directory could become compromised by somebody with root (or the same UID) on any system that mounts it.\nI posted a very similar answer (with more detail on ProxyCommand) to the very similar ServerFault question Username based SSH proxy.\n\nI like this a lot better than ForceCommand ssh -t restricted_usr_vm because it deals with timeouts better and ssh -t is kind of clunky (and, perhaps by now in the past, sometimes unreliable).  I'm also guessing that things like scp won't work through this method while they'll work perfectly via ProxyCommand.\n", "Q: How to change FileSystem from, msdos to ext3/ext4 on a specific drive I am relatively new to Ubuntu and I have recently added a new 480Gb+ SSD drive.

If yes , then how to install autocad civil 3d in ubuntu 14.04 through wine ?\n\nA: Yes, you can definitely TRY to install it. Sometimes it may even install completely. But it never works. Most times it won't even start at all. For more details on actual trails, please visit winehq.org . I have tried to install many Autodesk products in Ubuntu over the years. Especially Autocad (many versions). Sadly, Autocad will never work in linux, because it heavily relies on Windows Registry for keeping values of its' sysvars (system variables).\nThere is some hope though: Autocad runs on MacOS, which is a BSD-based OS. BSD and linux are like cousins in the OS world. Autocad 360 runs on Android. And Android is linux!! Maybe in the next decade, hopefully, will see Autocad running natively on linux desktop. Somehow.

I have 2 * 500-GB HDDs.\nWhat is the path for each of the disks?\nOn OSX I can just do:  \n$ cd /Volumes/DiskName/FooDirectory\n\nHow can I do that on Ubuntu? How can I navigate to files in a HDD using a terminal? /dev and /dev/disk are not making sense to me.\n\nA: On OS X those would be the mount points.  Under Ubuntu you would want to look at /media/USERNAME/ for those.  Though if the volume has not been mounted you could look at /dev/disk/by-label.\nIf the drives are paritioned and formatted, then you can navigate to them by doing something like cd /media/USERNAME/LABEL where USERNAME is your user name and LABEL is the label for the partition.\nIf your drives haven't been formatted, then you wouldn't see them in either location and you would instead want to look for /dev/sd[a-z].  That is, you'd have an entry like /dev/sda and /dev/sdb.  If they are partitioned, then you should also see /dev/sda[0-9] and /dev/sdb[0-9] (for example, /dev/sda1.)  But you'd have to at least format them before you can mount them and navigate to them...\nIf you haven't mounted the volumes, you can do it through nautilus by just clicking on the volume name.  Or from the terminal you can use udisksctl.  For example, I have a drive that is partitioned with just one file system.  The label of the drive is \"d_extra\".  I can view it in /dev/disk/by-label:\n$ ls -l /dev/disk/by-label\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Jul 17 15:34 d_extra -> ../../sdb1\n\nThen, once I know the name, I can mount it via udisksctl like so:\n$ udisksctl mount -o noatime -b /dev/disk/by-label/d_extra\n\nThen I can cd to it and view files:\n$ cd /media/stephen/d_extra\n$ ls\n\n\nA: On Linux you might have to login via terminal and use sudo. To go backwards you can use something like\ncd down\ncd Volumes/.../ \n\n//or\n\ncd up\ncd /.../Volumes\ncd .../Volumes\n\n//spaces in file name\ncd /Volumes/My\\Documents\n\nFYI dev is your firmware and device files. On other Unix OSs' like Mac OS X they have created permission blocks on viewing those. Installing firmware from terminal is possible on Linux. Try not to tamper as your GUID may be stored there along with shadow hash files elsewhere in the file system and you don't want to create any open doors. Mac won't even allow output to text file. To help you understand the GUID hash being MD5 would take about three years to crack with 4 GBs of RAM. Its kind of serious.\nAlso try..\n./Volumes/etc\n\n", "Q: How to complete installation of flash plugin?

But by default, Seahorse only shows your own keys (i.e. those, for which you have the private key). Click \"View\" and \"Show any\" to see the public key.\n\n*Using the command line\nsudo gpg --import <file will import into root's GnuPG keyring, which is probably not want to you want to achieve. Import to your user's keyring instead by omitting sudo:\ngpg --import key.txt\n\nAfterwards, it should be visible running\ngpg --list-keys\nVery likely you already imported it successfully, anyway.\nPrivate and Public Keys\nAnother issue you have seems to be the understanding of public/private key cryptography. With the key listed above, you will not be able to decrypt mail, you need the private key to decrypt a message. Public keys can only be used to encrypt messages to others (and verify the other's signatures), but not decrypting messages encrypted using that public key.\nIf you want to exchange messages with a friend using OpenPGP (or public/private key cryptography in general, eg. using S/MIME), each of you should generate his own key pair. Now exchange the public keys. If you want to send a message to your friend, use his public key to encrypt the message, now he will be able to decrypt it using his private key. The same applies the other way round.\n\nA: You have to use sudo try this in the terminal:\n  wget -o- (path and key.txt | sudo apt-add key (gpg)\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Vertical lines appear in my screen on 12.04 Vertical lines started appearing in my screen on 12.04 all of a sudden. \nDell Inspiron 6GB machine.

How can I get ubuntu on my laptop to start generating some heat with minimal effort? Basically I want the CPU and the GPU to start working hard so it heats up my laptop, but not to the point where I can no longer use my laptop. I still need to work on it.\nHow can I accomplish this without having to install Minecraft or something like that.\n\nA: You can overload your CPU, and hence generate heat, by using cpuburn: CPU stress tester for Ubuntu Linux - http://www.hecticgeek.com/2012/03/cpuburn-cpu-stress-test-ubuntu-linux/\nHowever if you are wary of running external programs then you can try CPU hammer shell script which uses awk to generate load by doing mathematical calculations http://linux.cloudibee.com/2008/11/linux-cpu-hammer-script/\nHope that helps!\nUPDATE: To partially overload the CPU and generate some heat, remove the & at the end of awk script in the second solution:\nfor i in `seq 0 $((NUM_PROC-1))`; do\n        awk 'BEGIN {for(i=0;i<10000;i++)for(j=0;j<10000;j++);}' \ndone\n\nThis alternatively loads two of the cores in an old Core2Duo.\nTo heat your laptop you need to stress at least one core and that may affect performance of certain multi-core applications. If that bothers you then you can make your computer more responsive by adding nice in front of the script as suggested in comment by Charles Boling.\nAlternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stressing the hard-disk is not a good idea for obvious reason - reduced life.\n\n*Stopping the CPU fan is dangerous and can permanently damage your cpu\n\n*Increasing frequency will increase heat but not all motherboard's allow changing clock frequency and it can be potentially dangerous operation\n\nA: By asking this question I assume you do not care about battery backup much. Having said that, CPU Frequency scaling is what you are looking for. Dynamic Frequency Scaling  is a technique by which the frequency of a microprocessor can be automatically adjusted \"on the fly,\" either to conserve power or to reduce the amount of heat generated by the chip. More on this here.\nYou can set your CPU scaling governor to 'performance' mode so that it won't dynamically scale down the clock speed:\ncpufreq-selector --governor=\"performance\"\n\nMore on this here.\nIn this way you can generate some heat with minimal effort.\n", "Q: How to change the Ubuntu background?

I have Ubuntu preinstalled in my PC and I have installed Windows 8 afterwards. Now I want to use Ubuntu but don't know how to open it. Please help!\n\nA: You might have to give more details on how exactly are you unable to access your ubuntu. One of the problems might be with your grub loader. A grub menu basically lists all the available operating systems installed in your computer. You might have to install a custom grub so that you can get the access to grub menu. \n\"When you install Windows, Windows assumes it is the only operating system (OS) on the machine, or at least it does not account for Linux. So it replaces GRUB with its own boot loader. What you have to do is replace the Windows boot loader with GRUB. I've seen various instructions for replacing GRUB by mucking around with GRUB commands or some such, but to me the easiest way is to simply chroot into your install and run update-grub. chroot is great because it allows you to work on your actual install, instead of trying to redirect things here and there. It is really clean.\nHere's how:\nBoot from the live CD or live USB, in \"Try Ubuntu\" mode.\nDetermine the partition number of your main partition. GParted (which should already be installed, by default, on the live session) can help you here. I'm going to assume in this answer that it's /dev/sda2, but make sure you use the correct partition number for your system!\n\nMount your partition:\n\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt  #Replace sda2 with your partition number\n\nBind mount some other necessary stuff:\n\nfor i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt$i\"; done\n\nchroot into your Ubuntu install:\n\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nAt this point, you're in your install, not the live session, and running as root. Update grub:\n\nupdate-grub\n\nIf you get errors, go to step 7. (Otherwise, it is optional.)\n\nDepending on your situation, you might have to reinstall grub:\n\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nupdate-grub # I'm not sure if this is necessary, but it doesn't hurt.\n\nIf everything worked without errors, then you're all set:\n\nexit\nsudo reboot\n\nAt this point, you should be able to boot normally.\n\nIf you cannot boot normally, and didn't do step 7 because there were no error messages, try again with step 7.\nSometimes giving GRUB2 the correct configuration for your partitions is not enough, and you must actually install it (or reinstall it) to the Master Boot Record, which step 7 does. Experience helping users in chat has shown that step 7 is sometimes necessary even when no error messages are shown.\"\n\n-This ain't my answer.\n", "Q: how to remove password authentication in ubuntu software center? I am new to ubuntu.Frequent password authentication while downloading any software in ubuntu is frustrating.Is there any way to remove it ?\nthanks in advance.\n\nA: I will have to agree with the others on here. Having password authentication for installing software is a 'security feature'. What this does is ensure that you are explicitly intending to install the software. Rather than with Windows, for example, that will auto-install things for you, some of which could contain adware and other malicious add-ons. Linux ensures that you aren't installing something without having that explicit consent (aka: password authentication). I highly recommend not trying to bypass this feature.\n", "Q: How do I restrict a specified SSH user to connect only from one IP or hostname? I have a monitoring server that requires the SSH connection details of a non-sudo user account of each box it monitors. Is there a way that I can configure a specific user account such that it can only be logged into from a specific IP (or better yet hostname)? I do not want to restrict the ability of other users on the server to be able to connect from other addresses (otherwise I'd just use a firewall), or use password authentication for the monitoring service only.\n\nA: You can use wildcards for the AllowUsers line on the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. So it would be feasible to add the line:\nAllowUsers *@192.168.1.100\n\nOr:\nAllowUsers *@hostname\n\nTo allow everyone from that IP address or hostname access. \nRemember to:\nservice ssh restart\n\nOnce you've made the changes, so long as you're on a version before 15.04. 15.04 uses systemd now, so has a different mechanism for controlling services. \n\nA: According to man pages, this should work:\nDenyUsers user@\"!host,*\"\n\nI tested this on Debian and it seemed to work correctly.\n\nA: Since this is the top search result in google, I think people should also be aware of setting permissions in the /etc/hosts.allow file (curtesy of Cameron Oltmann's blog post on the matter):\n\nTo limit ssh access to a linux box based on originating IP address,\n  edit /etc/hosts.allow:\nsshd : localhost : allow\nsshd : 192.168.0. : allow\nsshd : 99.151.250.7 : allow\nsshd : mydomain.net : allow\nsshd : ALL : deny\n\nThe above entry will allow ssh access from localhost, the 192.168.0.x\n  subnet, the single IP address 99.151.250.7, and mydomain.net (assuming\n  mydomain.net has a ptr record in place to facilitate reverse lookup).\n  All other IP addresses will be denied access to sshd.\nNotes: You can allow or deny based on ip address, subnet, or hostname.\n  List rules in order of most to least specific. The file only gets read\n  until a matching line is found, so if you start with ssdh : ALL :\n  deny, no ssh connections will be allowed.\n\nAnd you should be able to use user@address in this file, per this lifewire.com link:\n\nThe more complex forms daemon@host and user@host are explained in the\n  sections on server endpoint patterns and on client username lookups,\n  respectively.\n\n\nA: See man sshd_config. There is possibility to add AllowUsers block where you can specify both user and host like this:\nAllowUsers user@host # or IP\n\nOf course you need to specify also other users you want to allow login from, if you have some.\nAnother solution (depends on bug fixes!)\nAs I think about it once more, there is possibility to modify your sshd_config like this:\nMatch Host !hostname\n    DenyUsers user\nMatch Host hostname\n    AllowUsers user\n\nThis would easily block all users except from user from hostname and from everywhere else it would block user.\nBUT it doesn't work, because of few bugs reported upstream [1] [2].

I am running Ubuntu Gnome 15.04 on a Lenovo Yoga 13 laptop. My fan is constantly running. If have tried to solve the problem with TLP , but to no avail.

heavy software the cpu's should not be running so heavily.\n\nThis is a wrong assumption, one process running wild on only one core may very well utilize all the available thermal budget the CPU has to offer and keep the core busy doing nothing.\n\nHere is my cpufreq-info output. It shows that I scaled down the processors to maximum 1 Ghz, and also turn on powersave. However it says the processors keep running in 1.80 GHz.\n\nWhy that? You seem to have a problem with cores being busy for some reason you need to investigate. What problem is this workaround going to solve? You make your situation worse! The programs that really have work to do should get it finished as quick as possible and go back to sleep before heating up the rest of the system which just means more work for the fan to do to get all the heat back out of this narrow tiny system and you degrade the performance of the device for no good reason. Powersave governors and under clocking are not your friends!\nInvestigate what keeps your cores busy, you may not see all the details in some resource monitoring programs, check their settings or if a reboot  after the device has significantly cooled down helps.\nThere are some useful answers in fancontrol, but again you are likely to make you problem worse, revert every change you made in attempt to troubleshoot, wait for the device to have completely cooled down and focus on reproducible results.\n\n\nWith xsensors I see that my cpu's are fairly hot: about 60 deg.\n\nI assume you mean Celsius not Fahrenheit. Depending on the room temperature and the specification of the CPU 60 °C may not be as hot as you think it is or considered \"overheating\".\nHere is example from output from sensors on my desktop machine:\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nPhysical id 0:  +54.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 0:         +51.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 1:         +53.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 2:         +54.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 3:         +52.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\n[…]\n\nfan1:                     0 RPM  (min =    0 RPM)\nfan2:                   798 RPM  (min =    0 RPM)\nfan3:                     0 RPM  (min =    0 RPM)\nfan4:                   835 RPM  (min =    0 RPM)\nfan5:                     0 RPM  (min =    0 RPM)\n\nIt considers 80 °C as high and 100 °C as critical. Your Yoga may be different, the thing here is my fans run at low speed at about 28 °C room temperature currently and I can see there is almost nothing going on in indicator-multiload (though a Virtualbox VM is running and several applications, webbrowsers and halted videos are open), load or wild processes look different in resource usage.\n", "Q: Any nice, animated mouse cursor themes?

What is the best way of doing that?\n\nA: Grub menu entries are auto-generated by sudo update-grub. Have you tried to run it ? Doesn't it suite your needs ?\nOtherwise, you can use /etc/grub.d/40_custom to add your custom entries. And then run sudo update-grub to update /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\nYou can however edit manually /boot/grub/grub.cfg to delete an entry. But your change will be lost the next time update-grub will be run by you or automatically by ubuntu when there is a kernel upgrade.\n\nA: GRUB should autodetect every OS installed on a partition. You have to update the menu by using the following command:\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Filter lines based on length using sed and grep How to locate lines longer than 100 and smaller than 150 characters using sed and grep\n\nA: Using sed command\nsed -nr '/^.{101,149}$/p' infile\n\nBreaking down:\n\n\n*\n\n*-n: no printing\n\n\nThe -n option will prevent to print anything unless an explicit request to print is found (^.{101,149}$ \"Lines longer than 100(>=101) and smaller than 150 characters(<=149)\"). The /p flag used as one way to turn printing back on.\n\n\n*\n\n*-r: -r (--regexp-extended)\n\n\nThe -r enables the Extended regular expressions. replace -r with -E if your sed doesn't recognize it or you will need to escape the curly braces if none of them supported in your version of sed. Then the command would be sed -n '/^.\\{101,149\\}$/p' infile.\n\n\n*\n\n*The ^ is just the anchor for beginning of line and the $ for end of line.\n\n*A single . matches any single character\nSo, you got it, with sed -nr '/^.{101,149}$/p' infile, we are looking for a line from start to end of it which has or contains our defined rule.\nThis is a way to duplicate the function of grep with sed e.g: sed -n '/.../p' :)\nUsing grep command\ngrep -E '^.{101,149}$' infile\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-E this is the same as sed's -r option but for grep command. So if you don't want to use is just escape the curly braces.\n\n\nUsing awk command\nawk 'length($0)>100 && length($0)<150' infile\n\n\n\n*\n\n*length return the length of the line. In awk, the $0 specifies the whole line. So if the length of line was between 100 and 150, will be print out.\n\n\nA: Another way of doing this using bash:\nwhile read l; do nc=$(<<< \"$l\" wc -c); [ $nc -ge 101 ] && [ $nc -le 149 ] && echo \"$l\"; done < file\n\nExpanded into a script:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile read l; do\n    nc=$(<<< \"$l\" wc -c)\n    if [ $nc -ge 101 ]; then\n        if [ $nc -le 149 ]; then\n            echo \"$l\"\n        fi\n    fi\ndone < file\n\n", "Q: ubuntu PC is not accessible in VNC viewer in android I have a PC, laptop and an android mobile.

Eg: I am able to access my web applications on 80 and 8080 ports. I can do FTP to my PC from my mobile.\n\nA: The reason, as @CharlesBolin explained, is likely that the VINO connection is encrypted in a way it is not understood by your android app.\nIf that is the case, it is enough to type in the Ubuntu client:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false\n(without sudo!) and restart the VNC server in order to disable the encryption on the Ubuntu server for the default VNC server shipped with Ubuntu.\n\nA: Recent versions of Vino (the VNC server you are likely using in Ubuntu) require encryption by default, that unfortunately, virtually nothing else provides!\nThis page is one place that will tell you about it and how to fix it.

I am new to ubuntu.I tried to use inkspace vector graphics editor for graphic designing but could not find any eraser tool.Please help\n\nA: There is an eraser tool in Inkscape, but due to the nature of vector graphics (which is very different from raster/bitmap graphics), it behaves not at all like the eraser tool in bitmap/raster editors like Gimp. Once you'll get more familiar with vector drawing, you will see that \"classic\" erasing doesn't make that much sense in vector graphics.\n\nA: I've used Inkscape for a while and I've never come across an eraser tool.

I had installed Ubuntu14.04 version alongside my Windows 7 OS in my laptop. After working for a certain period and saving some bookmarks, when I logged in next time, say after one day, I do not find the saved bookmarks in the firefox browser. Why does it happen? What is live session? I had installed Ubuntu using an USB drive(Pendrive). \n\nA: Persistence is the capability of an OS to keep files over boots. It may store your files on your RAM, which is always cleared every boot (that's the design of RAM). To make your OS persistent, it needs to be installed on some kind of writable (non-read-only) drive.\nLosing your bookmarks is a perfect example of an OS that isn't setup to be persistent.\nLive-session is a non-persistent version of an OS (particularly a Linux derivative). Either from USB or CD, your files created from a live-session won't save after reboots/logins. It's used to test the operating system, not use it fully (it's very similar to a kiosk).\nYou need to make sure that Ubuntu is actually installed, not just running off the USB the  entire time. \nCan you start Ubuntu without the USB in the computer?\nDid you ever run something called \"Install Ubuntu\" from the USB drive? \nDid you ever set a username, password, location, etc when installing ubuntu?\nLook for something like \"Install Ubuntu\" on the live-session if any of those questions answer to \"no\". \nIf you did really install Ubuntu, it might be a permission issue that you are losing your bookmarks.

I can do\napt-get source python\n\nBut the actual question remains unanswered: where is the source (as in what directory is it put)?\n\nA: From the apt-get man page:\n   source\n       source causes apt-get to fetch source packages. APT will examine the available packages to decide which source package to fetch. It will then find and download into the current directory the\n       newest available version of that source package while respecting the default release, set with the option APT::Default-Release, the -t option or per package with the pkg/release syntax, if\n       possible.\n\n       Source packages are tracked separately from binary packages via deb-src lines in the sources.list(5) file. This means that you will need to add such a line for each repository you want to get\n       sources from; otherwise you will probably get either the wrong (too old/too new) source versions or none at all.\n\n       If the --compile option is specified then the package will be compiled to a binary .deb using dpkg-buildpackage for the architecture as defined by the --host-architecture option. If\n       --download-only is specified then the source package will not be unpacked.\n\n       A specific source version can be retrieved by postfixing the source name with an equals and then the version to fetch, similar to the mechanism used for the package files. This enables exact\n       matching of the source package name and version, implicitly enabling the APT::Get::Only-Source option.\n\n       Note that source packages are not installed and tracked in the dpkg database like binary packages; they are simply downloaded to the current directory, like source tarballs.\n\nAs the last line says, they are downloaded to the current working directory.  Therefore, if you open a terminal and it's looking at your home directory, it'll be downloaded there.\nYou may wish to make a subdirectory first for your source package downloads first, then change into that directory, and then run the command and download the source package.\n", "Q: How can I move a window from an invisible viewport to the current one, without switching viewports I use 15.04 with Unity and 4 virtual desktops.\nWhen I have opened a window on desktop 1 and am viewing desktop 2 (for example), is there a way to easily get that window from desktop 1 to show up on desktop 2 without switching the view to desktop 1?\nSo I want to get a window from a currently invisible desktop to my active desktop without seeing the invisible desktop (and eventually other opened windows on that one).\nIs there an easy way to achieve this?\n\nA: List windows, choose one to move to the current workspace\nWhen the script below is called, it will list all windows on all workspaces. Pick one and press OK to move the window to the current workspace and raise it. By default, it moves the window to position 100 (x), 100 (y)\nThe script is relatively simple as a result of the use of both wmctrl and xdotool. While wmctrl is used to list all windows, xdotool simply moves them to a predefined position on the current workspace \"without asking questions\" on the window's size (unlike wmctrl) and relative positions of both workspaces to each other. \nA more precise positioning of the window, according to the position on its original workspace, would very well be possible, but would also multiply the needed code (like e.g. here). I assume in most situations, this will do.\nAn example:\nI am on workspace 8, while I have a gedit window on workspace 1. Calling the script lists the windows:\n\npicking the gedit window will move it to the current workspace:\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport socket\nimport time\n\ndef get(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef check_window(w_id):\n    w_type = get(\"xprop -id \"+w_id)\n    if \" _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\" in w_type:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# split wmctrl output by machine name\nwlist = [l.split(socket.gethostname()) for l in get(\"wmctrl -l\").splitlines()]\n# extract window -id from first section\nwlist = [[wlist[i][0].split()[0], wlist[i][-1].strip()] for i, l in enumerate(wlist)]\n# filter only \"real, normal\" windows\nwlist = [w for w in wlist if check_window(w[0]) == True]\n# create columns for zenity list\ncols = (\" \").join(['\"'+w[1]+'\" '+'\"'+w[0]+'\"' for w in wlist])\n# calculate height and width for the zenity window, according to window names and list length\nh = str(140+(len(wlist)*23))\nw = str((max([len(w[-1]) for w in wlist])*8))\n# define the zenity window\ncmd = \"zenity --list --hide-column=2 --print-column=2 \"+\\\n      \"--title='Window list' --column='Current windowlist' \"+\\\n      \"--column='wid' --height=\"+h+\" --width=\"+w+\" \"+cols\n\ntry:\n    # call the window\n    w_id = get(cmd).split(\"|\")[-1].strip()\n    # move the selected window to the current workspace\n    subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"windowmove\", \"--sync\", w_id, \"100\", \"100\"])\n    # raise it (the command below alone should do the job, but sometimes fails\n    # on firefox windows without first moving the window).\n    subprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-iR\", w_id])\nexcept subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n    pass\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs both wmctrl and xdotool\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool\n\n\n*copy the script into an empty file, svae it as move_windows.py\n\n*Test-run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/move_windows.py\n\n\n*a window should appear, listing currently opened windows:\n\npick one to see if it is moved to the current workspace and raised correctly.\n\n*If all works fine, ad it to a shortcut key: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/move_windows.py\n\nNote\nThe size of the zenity window, listing current windows, is set automatically. The script looks for the longest window name and the number of rows (windows) and sets the size accordingly.\n\nEDIT\nAs requested in a comment, below a version in which the zenity list- window includes more information: de current workspace of the targeted window(s) and the application it belongs to.\n\nAs mentioned above, the information on the relative/absolute workspace positions leads to a more \"substantial\" amount of code, but luckily I could use this earlier answer as a base.\nHow to use\nThe use is pretty much the same as the first version of the script (above), but the command needs to include the preferred sorting option.

But, if I loose my bios config or reset settings to default, I loose ubuntu's boot. And when it's happens, I just can boot windows. I think there is one win-uefi when applying defaults.\nSo, I have to take a pendrive, write a boot repair, reboot for repair, ... Can I have, some how, I way to solve it? I can change bios to boot uefi and legacy.\n\nA: If both your OSes are booting in EFI mode, then there's no point in playing with the BIOS/CSM/legacy options in your firmware. Leave them disabled; enabling any such option is most likely to cause problems.\nYou shouldn't need to adjust your firmware settings on a regular basis, so this sort of problem should be something that crops up pretty rarely. If you are adjusting your firmware settings on a regular basis, that most likely indicates a problem of some type. If this is the case, I recommend you start a new question describing why you're making these regular adjustments and ask for a fix or workaround.\nIf you do change your firmware settings in such a way that the computer boots straight to Windows, there are at least two in-Windows solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open an Administrator Command Prompt window and type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi in that window. (In some cases, grubx64.efi may be required, rather than shimx64.efi; but normally shimx64.efi is more likely to work.)\n\n*Use the third-party EasyUEFI tool to reset the boot order or add an entry for EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi (or possibly EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi).\n\n\nAnother option is to create a USB flash drive with my rEFInd boot manager on it. You should then be able to boot from the USB drive, and from there boot either Windows or Ubuntu. If you boot Ubuntu, you can restore GRUB by using efibootmgr, as described here or here. Note, however, that the prepared rEFInd USB image from the download site works only if Secure Boot is disabled. If your system has Secure Boot active, you'll need to either disable it or prepare your own USB image of rEFInd with Shim or PreLoader.

For the few seconds between grub and the time X11 takes over, plymouth displays a splash screen.  You can customize it by taking the files in /lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo/ and copying them to another directory, modifying ubuntu-logo.plymouth to specify another ImageDir and putting your own .png image there, then use update-alternatives to redirect plymouth.default from /lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo/ubuntu-logo.plymouth to your version.\n", "Q: Window Transparency with Java I'm using a java application that relies heavily on window transparency it to work properly (windows apparently fade on top of each other to make them cross over each other).

Windows boot in UEFI.\nMy problem is that after booting from the CD and choosing any of the options (Install, Command-line install, Expert install, ...), I always get the same screen: it is completely illegible, like squeezed vertically, I can see some orange color - probably the highlighted line in a list, I can move it, I can press Enter and get further - god knows where). Strange that I get this also when I choose Command-line mode...\nI tried pressing E, that didn't do anything.\nInstallation in Legacy mode seemed to work, but I need UEFI since I already have there Win8 in UEFI mode.\n\nA: If you've done an EFI-mode installation, then 99.9% of the software you need is installed; the only thing left is a boot loader. Ordinarily, using Boot Repair might help; but with an existing Windows installation, you really need to run Boot Repair in EFI mode, which isn't working for you (from the installation medium, anyhow). Therefore, I suggest you try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you haven't done so already, disable Secure Boot in your firmware.\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Create a USB flash drive or CD-R that holds rEFInd.\n\n*Boot to the rEFInd medium. It should show you entries for both Windows and Ubuntu. Test both of them. If they both work, proceed. If the Ubuntu entry doesn't work, you may want to put off the rest of this procedure until you can fix the problem.\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu.\n\n*Install an EFI boot loader. Two options are likely to be relatively easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the rEFInd Debian package or PPA. Since rEFInd works from the USB drive, it's almost certain to work when installed to your hard disk.\n\n*Install the grub-efi package, which will replace the grub-pc package. You'll then need to run sudo grub-install and probably sudo update-grub to get a working configuration. Note that this is a bit of a gamble, though; because you didn't boot with GRUB, you can't really be sure it will work. You might run into the same video problems you experienced with the installation medium, or something else. OTOH, it might be fine.\n\n\n*If desired, re-enable Secure Boot in the firmware. (Depending on how you installed, you might need to install Shim before re-enabling Secure Boot. If you re-enable Secure Boot and the system stops booting, disable it and install Shim.)\n\n*You may need to adjust your firmware options to disable the BIOS/CSM/legacy boot support.\n\n\nIf you run into the same video problems with rEFInd that you have with the Ubuntu installation disc, you can try playing with kernel options. If you see a clear GRUB menu in the installer, you can hit e to edit the entry and change kernel options. In rEFInd, highlight the kernel you want to boot and hit F2 or Insert twice. The result will be a text editor with which you can edit the kernel options. In either case, try nomodeset as an added option. There are probably other options you can try, but they're mostly chipset-specific. Your laptop has an Intel video chipset, according to Lenovo's Web site, but I don't know offhand what options you might try with it. (Video problems such as the one you're having seem to be more common with Nvidia and AMD/ATI chipsets.)\n", "Q: Putting Qt icon on Ubuntu Desktop How can I put a working Qt5 icon on my Desktop in Ubuntu 14.04?

Actually v-sync can make it worse for some games! see below\nThis For my 560Ti I had installed the 346.47 binaries from Nvidia's site. When v-sync did not work, I upgraded my driver to 352.21.

Hopefully that fixes it, but I had to do it at every reboot because for some reason, xorg.conf (with the underscanning settings) was being deleted at every boot.  Never found an answer to that one.\nThis weekend, after getting sick of driver bugs and constantly resetting underscanning, I moved up to an amd card which works just fine in 14.04 using the vesa driver.  Just food for thought.\n\nA: I finally found a bug report here: that describes the problem and a fix.\nOpen a terminal and type:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-xserver-command.conf\n\nThen add the -bs option to your lightdm config\n[SeatDefaults]\n# Dump core\nxserver-command=X -bs -core\n\nHowever, as I found out on the Nvidia forms from Axfelix's post this does not always remove the screen tearing. The bug report is here. You'll have to disable 'unredirect fullscreen windows' option in Compiz as well.

I have an MSI GS70, which put the Windows OS on a pair of 128 GB SSDs which are arranged in RAID0. I have followed nearly every comprehensive guide I can find, but I can never seem to find the right partition to install Ubuntu on. I have no option to just \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows,\" and in the \"Something Else\" section I can't find the partition I created for Ubuntu.

I connected to it with my Mac, and I could read directories, open files, and delete them. It was working :-) Then I restarted my Mac, for unrelated reasons, and now I can't open the share again. This is only a couple of hours after I could access it, and I didn't restart the SMB server in that time. The network between the two is fine, because I am logged into the server from the Mac as I type.\nThis is my Ubuntu machine, something I've just put together for files and backup, and a few common unix services:\nLinux case 3.16.0-30-generic #40~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 15 17:43:14 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI set up samba, and the relevant results from testparm look like this:\n[global]\n    server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)\n    server role = standalone server\n    map to guest = Bad User\n    obey pam restrictions = Yes\n    pam password change = Yes\n    passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u\n    passwd chat = *Enter\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *Retype\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *password\\supdated\\ssuccessfully* .\n    unix password sync = Yes\n    syslog = 0\n    log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m\n    max log size = 1000\n    dns proxy = No\n    usershare allow guests = Yes\n    panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d\n    idmap config * : backend = tdb\n\n[open-share]\n    path = /mnt/raid/smb-shared\n    valid users = james\n    read only = No\n    guest ok = Yes\n\nMy Mac is running Yosemite (OS X 10.10.4).\nI've restarted the Mac, and I've restarted smbd after setting my smb password again.\nIf I open Finder on the Mac, under shared I can see \"case\", the name of the server.

Then I put in my password, and the dialogue box just shakes, as though I had it wrong.\nRunning sudo smbstatus gives me this:\n    james@case:~$ smbstatus\nSamba version 4.1.6-Ubuntu\nPID     Username      Group         Machine                        \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nService      pid     machine       Connected at\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo locked files\n\nI guess that's fine?\nWhat should I try next? I don't know why it stopped working!\n\nA: This is from: https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#SECURITY\nsecurity (G)\nThis option affects how clients respond to Samba and is one of the most important settings in the smb.conf file.\nThe default is security = user, as this is the most common setting, used for a standalone file server or a DC.\nThe alternatives are security = ads or security = domain , which support joining Samba to a Windows domain\nYou should use security = user and map to guest if you want to mainly setup shares without a password (guest shares). This is commonly used for a shared printer server.\nThe different settings will now be explained.\nSECURITY = AUTO\nThis is the default security setting in Samba, and causes Samba to consult the server role parameter (if set) to determine the security mode.\nSECURITY = USER\nIf server role is not specified, this is the default security setting in Samba. With user-level security a client must first \"log-on\" with a valid username and password (which can be mapped using the username map parameter). Encrypted passwords (see the encrypted passwords parameter) can also be used in this security mode. Parameters such as user and guest only if set  are then applied and may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after the user has been successfully authenticated.\nNote that the name of the resource being requested is not sent to the server until after the server has successfully authenticated the client. This is why guest shares don't work in user level security without allowing the server to automatically map unknown users into the guest account. See the map to guest parameter for details on doing this.\nSECURITY = DOMAIN\nThis mode will only work correctly if net(8) has been used to add this machine into a Windows NT Domain. It expects the encrypted passwords parameter to be set to yes. In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly the same way that a Windows NT Server would do.\nNote that a valid UNIX user must still exist as well as the account on the Domain Controller to allow Samba to have a valid UNIX account to map file access to.\nNote that from the client's point of view security = domain is the same as security = user. It only affects how the server deals with the authentication, it does not in any way affect what the client sees.\nNote that the name of the resource being requested is not sent to the server until after the server has successfully authenticated the client. This is why guest shares don't work in user level security without allowing the server to automatically map unknown users into the guest account. See the map to guest parameter for details on doing this.\nSee also the password server parameter and the encrypted passwords parameter.\nNote that the name of the resource being requested is not sent to the server until after the server has successfully authenticated the client. This is why guest shares don't work in user level security without allowing the server to automatically map unknown users into the guest account. See the map to guest parameter for details on doing this.\nSee also the password server parameter and the encrypted passwords parameter.\nSECURITY = ADS\nIn this mode, Samba will act as a domain member in an ADS realm. To operate in this mode, the machine running Samba will need to have Kerberos installed and configured and Samba will need to be joined to the ADS realm using the net utility.\nNote that this mode does NOT make Samba operate as a Active Directory Domain Controller.\nRead the chapter about Domain Membership in the HOWTO for details.\nDefault: security = USER\nExample: security = DOMAIN\n", "Q: Please, find a Decent Audio Driver for Lenovo Y50-70 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (has JBL Speakers, but Linux unable to use max potential) I'm used to the sound my laptop produces when it's running on Windows.

I used to run both OS on the same machine and both used to work just fine, but now when I try to launch Windows, it takes forever at the purple screen pause and it doesn't proceed further.\nWhat caused this problem? What is the solution? \nI used to run Windows 7 Ultimate and 14.01 Ubuntu side by side.\n\nA: Did you remove windows, or did you recently install updates?  If so, you might just need to update the bootloader.  Run this at the command line (assuming your GRUB install is in /boot/grub/):\nsudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nIf your grub install is somewhere else, try reinstalling GRUB:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n(assuming your computer boots to /dev/sda first)\nThat should solve the issue.  If not, then your Windows install may be corrupt.  If this doesn't fix it, use your computer's BIOS menu to boot manually on the Windows partition.  If it doesn't boot, then your Windows install died.\n", "Q: Headphones are playing a local radio station Before you even think about saying \"fake\" or something like that, I swear on my life this is real. \nI am sitting in a hotel room in New Orleans right now, with my headphones on. Instead of hearing audio from my computer, I am hearing local radio stations, such as the Spanish station I am hearing right now. There are no open programs, so this audio can't be coming from an app. \nThis does not play through the speakers. It only plays through the headphones when the computer is on (including GRUB).\nIs my integrated wireless card somehow receiving radio waves? What is happening? This is the first time I've ever experienced this, and I have no idea how or why.\nIf it helps, the volume and clarity of the radio streams changes as I move my head and/or my laptop.\n\nA: OK, I'm an amateur RF engineer, so I know roughly what's happening.\nEither your sound card or the headphones themselves are picking up the RF energy from a local AM or shortwave radio station. The wave is being rectified in the headphones and the audio is reproduced. \nThis can be solved by using shielded cables, and by buying RFI eliminating snap on chokes from your local RadioShack or other hobby electronics stores.  Amazon also has RFI chokes available.\n\nA: Having the same issue today and no shielded cable, I managed to minimize the effect by putting computer volume at max and speakers at low.\nOf course, works with speakers, not for headphones.\n", "Q: Can't put process into background using \"&\" When I type    xlogo &    into the shell prompt, it doesn't return me to the terminal. It keeps me on the xlogo window.\nHow do I fix this problem so that typing in \"&\" will return me to the terminal window immediately?\n\nA: I don't think what you're trying to do is possible (without extensive and very hard work).\nThe & has no relation to the X server. It's simply a meaningful character to bash that says the following:\n\nRun command A and command B at the same time. If there's no command B, return the user to the shell.\n\nIt has nothing to do with switching the active window in X, running other commands, etc. It has one use only: Running two commands at the same time.\n\nWith that in mind, it might be possible to write a script that would run a specified command, switch the active window back to the terminal, and then wait for your next command. However, that's out of the scope of this question as we're now getting into scripting.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.4 Firefox crashes Last week as usual I updated using software updater, ever since then Firefox has been crashing every few minutes.

I'm not sure of all of the keys I tried, but I'm convinced it hangs when it boots, to the point that nothing from the keyboard is being registered.\nFortunately, I'm set up with a small Windows installation that I can choose from Grub, and just like with the Nvidia card I pulled out, it works with absolutely no problems at all - the new card is detected and the drivers downloaded and installed flawlessly and it is working perfectly.\nSo what gives with Linux?  I've got ten years of dicking around with all of the Nvidia issues from multiple systems to get it working, so I'm pretty good at that - but based on all of the issues and general hatred for Nvidia from the linux community at large, I honestly expected a radeon card would at least get me to a desktop.  But as this is my first experience with radeon/linux, I really have no clue how to go about getting it to work at all.  \nAnd I honestly don't think I can return a $250 video card because \"it works fine in Windows but not in Linux.\"\nAny assistance at all would be very helpful and greatly appreciated.\nedit2\nGave up and tried reinstalling from the 15.04 iso  (fortunately I learned to keep windows! )\nIt installed, but complained about \"held packages\"\nRebooted to a desktop just fine, but now no mouse or keyboard lol!\nRecovery mode from grub also had no mouse or keyboard, but the keyboard works in grub! \nNow I'm just doing a complete wipe and install from scratch.

Some commands can cripple or even destroy your system. If you do not know what a command or its arguments do, look it up in the man pages first, and only run it once you understand what the command will do.

Running # lsblk may help you identify it, especially if you know its size. From here, I'll assume your root partition is on /dev/sda1.\nNow mount your root partition with # mount /dev/sda1 /mnt. Technically, you don't have to mount it to /mnt, so if you prefer, mount it somewhere else that is empty. If you're not sure that you mounted the right device, do # ls /mnt. If it's the right device, you should see folders like home, etc, usr, var, etc.\nIf it's the wrong device, make sure you're not in /mnt, then run # umount /mnt.\nOnce you have your root partition mounted to /mnt, chroot into it with # chroot /mnt. You should now be working with your installed system. \nFix your user account\nAssuming your admin group is called wheel, you can add yourself back to it with # usermod -aG wheel your-user-name-here. At this point, you may also want to double-check your sudo config, provided you know how to use visudo.\nWhen you're done fixing up your system, run # exit to leave the chroot environment, and unmount the partition with # umount /mnt.

I managed to dual boot Ubuntu 15.04 successfully. Then, I replaced the Windows Boot Loader with the grub loader as default by entering this command in the Windows command prompt:\nbcdedit /set \"{bootmgr}\" path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\nHowever, I decided to uninstall Ubuntu and unwisely began by deleting the Ubuntu partition from the Windows Disk Manager. Predictably, this led to a corruption in my EFI partition, I could not boot into Windows, and I had to get my HDD replaced. \nThis time, I want to install Ubuntu and not install the grub loader, instead just booting Ubuntu manually from the boot options during startup. My question is, if I choose to uninstall Ubuntu by deleting partitions again, will I get the same problems with my new scheme i.e. without meddling with the Windows boot process? \n\nA: First, the default GRUB 2 configuration for Ubuntu sends GRUB 2 to the Ubuntu partition for some critical configuration and support files. This makes GRUB 2 reliant on files on both the EFI System Partition (ESP) and the Ubuntu root (/) or /boot partition. Thus, deleting the Ubuntu partition almost certainly did not damage the EFI System Partition (ESP). Instead, you deprived GRUB 2 of its configuration and support files, leading to an inability to boot through GRUB 2. This problem is actually easily overcome by using the computer's built-in boot manager -- typically accessed by pressing Esc, Enter, or a function key when you power on the system. (Unfortunately, there's no standardization in user interfaces, so I can't be more specific.) If you'd known this, you could probably have saved yourself a lot of hassle.\nSecond, installing Ubuntu without a boot loader is pretty pointless, since a boot loader is required to boot an OS. That said, the boot loader need not be GRUB 2. This question and answers briefly describe several alternatives. My Web page on the subject goes into a lot more detail. If you want to use something other than GRUB 2, you can boot the installer using the \"try before installing\" option, launch a Terminal, and type:\nubiquity -b\n\nThis command launches the installer and tells it to not install GRUB. When the installation finishes, you'll have to install the boot loader of your choice in some way. Options include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install it from Windows\n\n*Install it from the Ubuntu live disk\n\n*Use an emergency boot manager like rEFInd on USB drive to boot Ubuntu, then install from there\n\n\nIf you want a boot process that's safe from problems caused by deleting Ubuntu, you'll need to either use something other than GRUB 2 or create a heavily-customized GRUB 2 configuration, as described here.

I don't get the logic behind it.\n\nA: By default, sed uses basic regular expressions.  That means that GNU lets \\< match the beginning of a word and \\> match the end of a word.  Observe:\n$ echo '<B> BBB B' | sed 's/\\<B\\>/STRONG/g'\n<STRONG> BBB STRONG\n\n\\<B\\> matches the word B which appears twice in the above string.  Because it matches the word B and not the angle brackets, the angle brackets are left unchanged.\nIf you want to match angle brackets, <>, leave the backslash off:\n$ echo '<B> BBB B' | sed 's/<B>/<STRONG>/g'\n<STRONG> BBB B\n\n<B> matches open angle bracket followed by B followed by closing angle bracket.  Thus, <B> is replaced with <STRONG> but B is left alone.\nCatching both the open and closing tags\n$ echo '<B> BBB B </B>' | sed -r 's|<(/)?B>|<\\1STRONG>|g'\n<STRONG> BBB B </STRONG>\n\n-r is for extended regex but recent versions of GNU sed also support -E as a synonym for -r.  BSD sed uses -E for this and, reportedly, future POSIX standards have adopted -E.  Thus, for compatibility, one may want to use (hat tip @Kos):\n$ echo '<B> BBB B </B>' | sed -E 's|<(/)?B>|<\\1STRONG>|g'\n<STRONG> BBB B </STRONG>\n\n\nA: < and > aren't special characters in Basic Regular Expressions, so they shouldn't be escaped. When you escaped them, sed will try to treat them as special characters, and then the behaviour is undefined:\n\nThe interpretation of an ordinary character preceded by a \n  ( '\\' ) is undefined, except for:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The characters ')', '(', '{', and '}'\n  \n*The digits 1 to 9 inclusive (see BREs Matching Multiple Characters)\n  \n*A character inside a bracket expression\n  \n\nSo, just use < and > without escaping:\n$ echo 'b<b>' | sed 's/<b>/strong/'  \nbstrong\n\n\nA: Solution with awk. Here I have a sample file with two lines that contain  and  tags and use gsub function to replace them. Then we output that to temp file and back into original file. Remove temp file when done. Adapt as necessary.\n$ cat tags.txt                                                                                                                                      \n<B> and </B>\n<B> or </B>\n\n$ awk '{gsub(\"<B>\",\"<STRONG>\"); gsub(\"</B>\",\"</STRONG>\");print}' tags.txt                                                                           \n<STRONG> and </STRONG>\n<STRONG> or </STRONG>\n\n$ awk '{gsub(\"<B>\",\"<STRONG>\"); gsub(\"</B>\",\"</STRONG>\");print}' tags.txt > tmpfile.txt && cat tmpfile > tags.txt\n\n", "Q: I cannot login to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS after upgrade from 12.X I have just upgraded my Ubuntu to 14.04 LTS.

If you can find that specific number, then that suggests that for some reason, GRUB can't find your SSD, although Ubuntu can.

In such a case, moving the disk to another SATA port on the motherboard may help. Consult your manual for information about which physical ports are controlled by which disk controller chipsets. If one of your other disks has no bootable OS, you might be able to simply swap cables.\nIf you don't see the UUID from the message in your blkid output, then that suggests that your GRUB configuration is corrupt. This might happen if you're launching an old GRUB from a previous installation. It could also happen if the GRUB setup scripts have a bug.

This tool can fix many GRUB problems, but it's not guaranteed to succeed, particularly if the problem is a GRUB bug.\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager, prepare a medium with it, and boot it. (You may need to disable Secure Boot, if you haven't done so already.) This should give you options to boot Ubuntu and whatever other OS(es) are on your disk. If you can boot all your OSes, boot into Ubuntu and install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package.

I used resizeStack in Terminal to shrink the OS X partition (guide here). Now the SSD is partitioned as:\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1: EFI partition\n\n*/dev/sda2: OS X Yosemite\n\n*/dev/sda3: OS X Recovery HD\n\n*/dev/sda4: Boot Camp Windows 8\n\n*/dev/sda5: Ubuntu Disk mounted to /\n\n*/dev/sda6: Ubuntu Swap\nThe Ubuntu boot loader is selected to install to /dev/sda1, but the installer notified that the Windows Boot Loader also exists in sda1. After installation, Ubuntu and Mac OS successfully booted from GRUB2, but the Windows cannot be booted either from GRUB2 or from the native Apple boot manager (pressing option when booting). I used Parallels Desktop to load the Boot Camp partition as a Virtual Machine and the Windows works.\nSolution #1\nI installed Boot Repair on Ubuntu and used the Recommended Repair, no luck; more entries are added to the Grub2 menu after repair. GRUB worked and Mac OS could be booted. Here is the Boot Info page created: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11897269/\nSolution #2\nI plugged in the Windows Installation flash drive and tried the automatic Startup Repair, which did not work. Then I attempted to repair the Master Boot Record by Command Prompt:\nbootrec /fixmbr\nAfter the repair Mac OS was set to be the first system to boot, so Grub menu did not appear while starting the computer. I used efibootmgr on the Ubuntu Installation flash drive to set back Ubuntu to be the first boot drive and Mac OS to be the second. Windows still cannot be booted.\nThe weird thing is that this time the Apple boot manager did not attempt to boot Windows after the \"Windows\" disk icon is clicked; both the \"Macintosh HD\" and \"Windows\" icon will lead to Mac OS being booted. So the repair must have changed the Apple boot manager.\nSeveral Questions\n\n*\n\n*Seems that the Windows Boot Loader in /dev/sda1 is overwritten by Grub. So is there a way to make the Windows Boot Loader and Linux boot loader (it is Grub now, right?) coexist?\n\n\n*A thing to notice is that the Boot Camp Windows 8 boots in EFI mode on MacBook Pro, as the setupact.log shows Callback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected boot environment: EFI. guide I also checked Grub that it works in EFI mode. Therefore does Windows also use GUID Partition Table (GPT) similar as Mac OS, instead of MBR? If so repairing MBR may not be useful.\n\n\n*I am not sure where does the Apple boot switch reside, and how it can be changed by the Windows Installation drive? Is it also in /dev/sda1?\nI am a beginner on the subject. Thanks a lot for your answers!\n\nUpdates:\nI tried the following commands in Windows Installation Command Prompt:\n\n*\n\n*bootrec /fixmbr: Successful\n\n*bootrec /fixboot: Successful\n\n*bootrec /scanos: Identified 1 Windows Installation on D:\\Windows\n\n*bootrec /rebuildbcd: Identified 1 Windows Installation on D:\\Windows; The requested system device cannot be found.\n\n*bcdedit: The requested system device cannot be found.\n\nWindows cannot be booted, with error code 0xc000000e.\nUpdates #2\nI followed Rod Smith's answer to convert my EFI partition from MBR: MBR only to MBR: protective and GPT: present, but then the 'Windows' option disappears from Apple boot manager and Grub cannot be booted.\nAlso I followed Terrance's answer to rebuildbcd but did not succeed. See comments on their answers.\n\nA: Your problem is that your Windows installation is in EFI mode, but your disk is configured with a hybrid MBR, which forces Windows to treat the disk as an MBR disk. The Mac boot loader might also be taking this as a signal to attempt a BIOS-mode boot of Windows, but there's no BIOS-mode boot loader on the disk. Since Windows will boot in EFI mode only from a GPT disk, this configuration results in a failed boot. There may be other problems, too, but this one is the first issue I see, and it will definitely cause a failure to boot, so you should fix this problem.\nFortunately, the solution is fairly straightforward, albeit non-intuitive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu. (You can also do this from OS X, but you'd need to install gdisk and use a different disk device filename.)\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Type sudo gdisk /dev/sda. After you're prompted for your password, gdisk should launch and tell you, among other things, MBR: hybrid.\n\n*Type p to view the partition table. Assuming you know enough about your partitions, you should be able to verify that you're looking at the right disk. If not, type q to quit and try another disk device.\n\n*Type x to enter the experts' menu.\n\n*Type n to create a fresh protective MBR to replace your existing hybrid MBR.\n\n*Type p again to verify that your partitions are all still in place. This is just a precaution to ensure you didn't accidentally hit the wrong key.\n\n*Type w to save your partition table. You'll be asked to verify this action. Do so.\n\n\nWith any luck, this should fix your problem.\n\nA: If Bootrec shows the “The requested system device cannot be found” error, the following steps will help build a new BCD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type this command:\nbcdedit /export D:\\BCDBackup\n\n\n*Type \nd:\n\nwhere d: is where your Windows is installed\n\n*Type \ncd boot\n\n\n*Type this command:\nattrib bcd -s -h -r\n\n\n*Type this command:\nren d:\\boot\\bcd bcd.old\n\n\n*Type this command:\nbootrec /RebuildBcd\n\nHope this helps.\nCredit\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS .run file issues Having some Issues with the .run type files.

That didn't feel all to strange as the HTPC had been running when the PSU gave up so I fired up a shell with:\nsudo fsck -y /dev/sde\n\nIt ran for a while and I could mount the drive when it was finished.

This works fine so long as the disk is accessed only from the external enclosure. Disks must not be swapped back and forth between such enclosures and direct access via motherboards. Doing so is likely to result in the appearance of partition table damage and can cause filesystem damage.\n\n*They \"roll over\" access at 2TiB. This results in a disk that appears to be either 2TiB or the remainder of the true size divided by 2TiB -- normally about 700GiB for a 3TiB disk. (Note that TB != TiB; see here for details.) This behavior is a serious problem that effectively prevents use of large disks in enclosures that do this. Putting a disk that had been used internally into such an enclosure usually results in the appearance of a damaged partition table and can result in filesystem corruption if you attempt to use it.\n\n\nI see no evidence of either of these problems in your gdisk output, but it's not clear if that output comes from the disk connected via the USB drive or in some other way. Also, it's conceivable that the \"roll-over\" problem might still be occurring, but the enclosure is reporting the disk's true size.\nOne more point: You say you did sudo fsck -y /dev/sde. That's performing the filesystem check on the whole disk. Most disks are partitioned, though, and the gdisk output indicates your disk is partitioned. Thus, you should have performed the fsck on /dev/sde1, not on /dev/sde. If you reported this accurately, it's conceivable you've actually damaged the filesystem by checking the whole disk rather than the partition. Ordinarily, I'd expect fsck to report an error when you do something like this, but maybe you got unlucky in this.\nThe bottom line is that you should stop using the disk in an external enclosure, at least unless and until you can verify that your enclosure is not doing any sort of \"translation\" or \"rollover.\" Instead, access it by plugging it directly into a computer's motherboard. You may still have to repair problems, but at least you won't be creating new ones whenever you write to the disk.\n", "Q: With 128GB of physical RAM in my repurposed server, do I need swap space at all? I have seen people asking question about the necessity of swap space with various amounts of RAM installed, but my question is one to two orders of magnitude larger in the respect of installed RAM.\nThe machine in question was used as a virtual machine host server. For that purpose I had 128GB of RAM installed, and that was just about enough (peak memory usage was around 119GB)\nNow this machine is decommissioned as virtual machine host and I am giving it Ubuntu Desktop to repurpose it as my power workstation that can crunch through big compiling tasks (e.g. Linux kernel) or multimedia rendering tasks (e.g. for uploading to YouTube) since it is such a powerhouse with dual Xeon E5-2620v2 processors (12 cores total, 24 threads)\nNow with 128GB of RAM installed and since there is nowhere else those ECC RAM modules can go to, this Ubuntu installation is receiving full 128GB ECC RAM.\nWith that RAM space which is double the SSD space in my (another) daily driver workstation (as this behemoth of a workstation is a major power hog running it as my daily driver wouldn't be ecnomical,) do I need any swap space on this powerhouse in perceivable future?\n\nA: No you don't need swap, would be my short answer. Unless you are going to do some heavy video editing or similar RAM heavy task, you won't have any speed up benefits of enabling any ram. As you will still have plenty of free ram for file caching.\nDo note that you won't be able to hibernate without enabling something like twice the amount of RAM for your swap space, however as you state that you only have 64GB of disk storage, that wouldn't have been possible anyway.\n", "Q: Cannot start Qt Creator after updating to 15.04 My Qt Creator (from ubuntu-sdk) won't start after updating to 15.04.

This only happens in Ubuntu, Windows 8.1 is not affected. I cannot find a pattern under which situations the hibernation is interrupted.

How do I compile MSDOS 1.1 on Lubuntu 15.04?\n\nA: You can not compile it because it is assembler code, i.e. code that is to be executed directly by the CPU. MS DOS 1.1 was just a re-brand of QDOS, an operating system developed for the Intel 8086 architecture.

When you hear the system comes with an online manual, it usually causes a sigh of relief. What you don't know is that manual pages are technical references. While that may sound really bad -- its not! Once you learn the basics of man pages, you will come to appreciate how they are written. If you need information, and don't have time to waste, the man command is who you turn to.\nThis document attempts to teach you how to read the unix manual -- commonly refered to as the man pages.\nCommon Quotes\nBefore we jump into our first man page, lets take a look at some common symbols used in them. These symbols are sometimes refered to as quotes.\nThe primary use of a man page is to lookup parameters for a program. Since most parameters are optional, they will be enclosed in square brackets.\n[optional]\n[-abcgln]\n\nSome options will have a limited list of choices. A list of choices will be comma seperated and put between braces.\n{choice1,choice2}\n{yes,no}\n\nMany sources of help documentation enclose manditory parameters between less-than/greater-than symbols.\n<manditory>\n<program_name>\n\nWhile the above manditory quotes aren't usually used in man pages, its a good thing to know. \n\nA: From man man page :\n\n\nThe following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.\n  \nExact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, \n  man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal, \n  and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.\nThe  command  or  function  illustration is a pattern that should match all \n  possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several \n  exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.\n\n", "Q: Why shouldn't we use self-signed SSL certificates in production? It says not to do that here:\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-postfix-e-mail-server-with-dovecot\nMy question is: why not?\nAlso, another question, how does one ensure that a certificate is only readable by the root user?\n\nA: Certificates are a means of establishing trust.  There are a number of certificate signing authorities which are trusted by browsers and other tools which use SSL/TLS certificates.  When the make an encrypted connection they verify that the provide certificate was signed by a trusted certificate. \nA self-signed certificate is not signed by a trusted signer and will be untrusted.  Many tools will ask if you want to accept the certificate anyway.  Teaching people to accept such certificates, leaves them open to man in the middle attacks.  \nIf you don't want to get a certificate from a trusted certificate authority, you can create your own certificate authority (CA).  However, you will need to distribute you public CA certificate to your clients and get them to install it in the appropriate trust store(s).\nThere are cases, such as VPNs, where you may want to have your own CA.

Freshclam actually has a daemon that can run as many times a day as you want.  During the configuration process of freshclam it asks how many times a day to check for updates.

I found a great tutorial that does exactly what I want it to do, but it of course becomes a little tiresome to type in all these verbose commands every time I have to restart the machine. My commands are as follows:\npactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=GAME sink_properties=device.description=\"GAME\"\npactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=MUSIC sink_properties=device.description=\"MUSIC\"\npactl load-module module-combine-sink sink_name=GAME_and_out sink_properties=device.description=\"GAME_and_out\", slaves=0,1\npactl load-module module-combine-sink sink_name=MUSIC_and_out sink_properties=device.description=\"MUSIC_and_out\", slaves=0,2\n\nI want to move the required commands into my .profile file, but this duplicates the procedure every time I log in, leading to the creation of many extra sinks that I don't need nor want.\nIs there a way to either remove the old null sinks created with pactl load-module module-null-sink, or write an if block to wrap it in that will not fire if those sinks already exist?\n\nA: Rater than putting these commands into our .profile it is recommended to add all modules needed into our /etc/pulse/default.pa or in a copy of this file in our home in ~/.pulse/default.pa resp. ~/.config/pulse/default.pa for a per user setting (which will override all settings defined in /etc/pulse/default.pa).\nAdding these lines to this file:\nload-module module-null-sink sink_name=GAME sink_properties=device.description=\"GAME\"\nload-module module-null-sink sink_name=MUSIC sink_properties=device.description=\"MUSIC\"\nload-module module-combine-sink sink_name=GAME_and_out sink_properties=device.description=\"GAME_and_out\", slaves=0,1\nload-module module-combine-sink sink_name=MUSIC_and_out sink_properties=device.description=\"MUSIC_and_out\", slaves=0,2\n\nwill always load the desired NULL sinks on starting the pulseaudio sound server.\nRemoving sinks that had been loaded by pactl or pacmd, i.e. without settings in our default.pa can most quickly done by\npulseaudio -k\n\nThis command will kill the running pulseaudio instance, to instantaneaously respawn it (in a default set up) using values defined in the default.pa.\n", "Q: How to edit /boot/efi I have installed rEFInd, and it works well enough, but I am trying to add a theme.

It works flawlessly on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Intel graphics card, and it's basically a breeze to set up. I produced a full guide for it on my blog linked below, but here's the gist of it:\nWhy RetroArch?\nIt's geared towards a \"just works\" philosophy, where you do not need to worry about loading or configuring additional plugins. You can tweak things, but the defaults generally work just fine.\nInstall RetroArch via PPA\nmkdir ~/emu\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libretro/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install retroarch libretro*\n\nGet and configure the BIOSes\nYou need the files:\nscph5500.bin\nscph5501.bin\nscph5502.bin\n\nIf you cannot find all of them, you can also use scph1001.bin and rename it to scph5501.bin, scph1000.bin to scph5500.bin, and scph1002.bin to scph5502.bin.\nDrop these bin files in ~/emu, the dir you created earlier. \nLaunch retroarch from terminal, then press ESC to quit. You have to tweak the .cfg before finally using it.\ngedit ~/.config/retroarch/retroarch.cfg\n\nModify the following lines like so, to point to your ~/emu dir.\nsystem_directory = \"~/emu/\"\ncontent_directory = \"~/emu/\"\n\nSave and close the file. Now move ALL BIOS bins, roms, and CUE/ISO files to your ~/emu directory.\nISO vs CUE files\nUnfortunately RetroArch/Mednafen cannot open ISO files directly, only CUE file. If you just have the ISO or BIN for the Playstation game, you have to create a CUE sheet for each disc using a simple text editor (Gedit is fine).\nLet’s say I have FF7_DISC1.ISO file inside ~/emu, which is Disc 1 of Final Fantasy VII. Navigate to ~/emu, and create a plain text file called FF7_DISC1.CUE. Copy/Paste this to it:\nFILE \"FF7_DISC1.ISO\" BINARY\n  TRACK 01 MODE2/2352\n    INDEX 01 00:00:00\n\nThe filename in between the “quotes” should match exactly your ISO filename, and it should all be in the same directory. What this file does is basically determine where the CD audio tracks begin and end; in the case of Final Fantasy VII there is no CD audio so it’s just 00:00:00. You should be able to do this for most games the same way. But if a game does have CD audio and you want that to work, you will have to find the CUE sheet for the game.\nPlay\nYou're ready to play! Launch retroarch --verbose again from the terminal (the --verbose option will output more messages to the console in case there is something you need to fix).\nNavigate the menus with arrow keys, X confirms and Z goes back.\nFull Guide: http://butlerpc.net/blog/2015/07/guide-to-running-retroarch-playstation-emulator-on-ubuntu-14-04/\n", "Q: Caught in loop and need to save files using command line to external harddrive Last night I decided to update my Ubuntu 14.04.

You need the path to your USB device.\nSyntax\ncp source destination\ncp dir1 dir2\ncp -option  source destination\ncp -option1 -option2  source destination\n\nFrom your question, you want \ncp -r /home/username/Documents /usb_backup_destination\ncp -r /home/username/Downloads /usb_backup_destination\n\nand, so on for each directory you wish to copy.\nIf you need to find the path to your USB backup device, run\nsudo blkid\n\nThe output for your device will be listed after all the HDD's an usually starts with sdb \n/dev/sdb1: UUID=\"36C9-BC77\" TYPE=\"vfat\" PARTUUID=\"e10284e8-01\"\n\nwith one line for each partition. The UUID, without quotes, will be needed to identify the target destination for your copy command. Your destination usually mounts as:\n/media/<your_username/<your_sbd>\n\nSo, your copy command should look like this.\ncp -r ~/Downloads /media/<your_username>/device_UUID\n\n\nA: cp item directory is how you copy files into a directory.

For troubleshooting, I have provided both route and ifconfig results from before and after the vpn connection and also added the /var/log/syslog output.\nAny help is greatly appreciated!\nNon-vpn connected route command\n:~$ route\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway     Genmask         Flags   Metric  Ref Use Iface\ndefault         10.0.1.1    0.0.0.0         UG      0       0   0   eth0\n10.0.1.0        *           255.255.255.0   U       1       0   0   eth0\n\nWith VPN \"connection successfully established\"\n:~$ route\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway     Genmask         Flags   Metric  Ref Use Iface\ndefault         10.0.1.1    0.0.0.0         UG      0       0   0   eth0\n10.0.0.90       *           255.255.255.255 UH      0       0   0   ppp0\n10.0.1.0        *           255.255.255.0   U       1       0   0   eth0\nxx-xx-xx-xx-st  10.0.1.1    255.255.255.255 UGH     0       0   0   eth0\nxx-xx-xx-xx-st  10.0.1.1    255.255.255.255 UGH     0       0   0   eth0\n\nifconfig results without vpn\n:~$ ifconfig\neth0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 40:16:7e:63:62:10  \n        inet addr:10.0.1.30  Bcast:10.0.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n        inet6 addr: <xx>:acff/64 Scope:Global\n        inet6 addr: <xx>:6210/64 Scope:Global\n        inet6 addr: <xx>::ca4e/128 Scope:Global\n        inet6 addr: <xx>:6210/64 Scope:Link\n        UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n        RX packets:608006 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n        TX packets:401539 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n        collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n        RX bytes:586253471 (586.2 MB)  TX bytes:39736340 (39.7 MB)\n\nlo      Link encap:Local Loopback  \n        inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n        inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n        UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n        RX packets:44231 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n        TX packets:44231 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n        collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n        RX bytes:3993104 (3.9 MB)  TX bytes:3993104 (3.9 MB)\n\nWith VPN connected\n:~$ ifconfig\neth0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 40:16:7f:01:62:10  \n        inet addr:10.0.1.30  Bcast:10.0.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n        inet6 addr: <xx>acff/64 Scope:Global\n        inet6 addr: <xx>:6210/64 Scope:Global\n        inet6 addr: <xx>::ca4e/128 Scope:Global\n        inet6 addr: <xx>:6210/64 Scope:Link\n        UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n        RX packets:607270 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n        TX packets:400937 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n        collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n        RX bytes:586134269 (586.1 MB)  TX bytes:39688705 (39.6 MB)\n\nlo      Link encap:Local Loopback  \n        inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n        inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n        UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n        RX packets:44145 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n        TX packets:44145 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n        collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n        RX bytes:3985819 (3.9 MB)  TX bytes:3985819 (3.9 MB)\n\nppp0    Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol  \n        inet addr:10.0.0.95  P-t-P:10.0.0.90  Mask:255.255.255.255\n        UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1400  Metric:1\n        RX packets:19 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n        TX packets:9 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n        collisions:0 txqueuelen:3 \n        RX bytes:1045 (1.0 KB)  TX bytes:126 (126.0 B)\n\nMy var/log/syslog file yields the following output after I initiate the vpn connection.\nJul 19 16:26:15 silentone NetworkManager[704]: <info> Starting VPN service 'pptp'...\nJul 19 16:26:15 silentone NetworkManager[704]: <info> VPN service 'pptp' started (org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.pptp), PID 16132\nJul 19 16:26:15 silentone NetworkManager[704]: <info> VPN service 'pptp' appeared;

I have Power -> Suspend when inactive for 2 hours. This works fine if I am logged in and then walk away. But if I am not logged in, it never suspends. Moreover, I understand that \"inactive\" means that I have not touched my mouse of keyboard; is does NOT mean that no background jobs are running.\nMy situation is that I have set rtcwake to de-suspend the machine in the middle of the night to do various routine tasks (e.g. as scheduled by cron or anacron). Some of these tasks might take a long time (e.g. if I a doing a backup). What I want is for the system to suspend when it detects that the CPU has at last gone idle. Note that, being logged off, the Xserver will not be running (or it will be running in a special \"awaiting login\" mode).\nHow do I set this up? In particular, I would  prefer NOT to have to set this up within the cron jobs, because there might be two or more cron jobs running, and no way to know which will finish first (yes, I know there are messy and complicated ways of detecting this, but K.I.S.S. and all that).\n\nA: I was having the same issue using deja-dup to backup from ubuntu 12.04 to a dedicated backup pc on ubuntu 14.04.\nI made use of the second solution by dhiya from this question but just modified the interface string to eth0.\ni.e. changed: iface='wlan0' to: iface='eth0'\nUPDATE 17/09/2015: I modified dhiya's code from the link underneath to keep a system awake based on network traffic or user activity and to force graceful suspension if the desktop session ends up in the lock/login screen with no network traffic.  The program logs everything to a log file.  Config has also been provided to manage the logfile.

NetBeans should be able to be pinned.\n\nAs a side-note, the logo is going to be rather low-resolution.\nTo fix this, run the below commands:\nsudo apt-get install icnsutils\ncd /usr/local/netbeans-8.0.2/nb\nsudo icns2png -x -s 128x128 -d 32 netbeans.icns\nsudo mv netbeans.png netbeans.png.bak\nsudo mv netbeans_128x128x32.png netbeans.png\n\nThis will install the icnsutil package which contains the utility icns2png (which converts ICNS files to PNG). Then, we invoke this to generate a 128x icon for Netbeans, which we then move to the netbeans.png file.\n", "Q: How to install NVIDIA Driver proprietary, tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS know anyone how can I install NVIDIA Driver proprietary, tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

I am not sure what to do from here, I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to help.\n\nA: I have looked up your Lenovo b575. Please make sure the PHYSICAL wifi switch on the front of the laptop is enabled.  Two thirds of the time when I am asked to help with wifi issues, it is that the user inadvertently turned off their laptop's physical wifi switch.\n\nA: I ended up fixing this problem by opening up my laptop disconnecting the wifi card. Then I started up the laptop with out the wifi card. After this I turned the laptop off and reconnected the wifi card. Now the command \"rfkill list all\" lists everything no and I am able to connect to my wifi again.  \n", "Q: Encrypted Drives I have just made a huge mistake. I encrypted my boot drive and now cannot boot. is there a way to unencrypt my drive in the setup or bios?\n\nA: You may want to try the following:Boot from a live CD/DVD/USB and then select the option to manually install Ubuntu. Now choose the correct options to mount the root partition to / and the home partition to /home. Make sure you DO NOT select the option to format those partitions, Now choose the option to mount the boot partition to /boot and now you DO select the option to format this partition. The installer will now install a fresh unencrypted boot partition while keeping the other two partitions untouched so you don't loose important data. When this finishes you are able to boot normally and you should be able to decrypt the other partitions using your passphrase. This will only work when you have your boot files on a separate partition.\n", "Q: Ubuntu install from external hard drive I just downloaded the ISO and i don't have any blank cd's to put it on, can i install from an external hard drive?\n\nA: You can if your BIOS supports booting from usb and if your willing to format that drive.\nYou can use a program like unetbootin to create the bootable USB. This program lets you select from a whole range of linux distributions to install or just use an iso that youve already downloaded. \nThen with the usb plugged into your computer, restart and enter your BIOS setup by holding delete or F10 (it will say on the screen).\nIf your BIOS supports USB booting the drive will show up in your boot order.\n", "Q: Cannot boot Windows 7 after installing ubuntu I installed ubuntu on a seperate partition I made in windows disk management.

After that I can only load ubuntu and loading windows 7 is no longer an option.\nThis is the link to my Boot info script\n\nA: Run this at the command line:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nThat should install GRUB with fresh config files, and it should make all well.\n\nA: You need to update your grub loader information.  It is missing the Windows entry in the grub menu.\nGo to a terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T all at the same time.  Then type in the following to update the grub menu:\nsudo update-grub\n\nwhen the update is completed, you should be able to reboot your system, and your grub menu should appear with Windows as the last option to boot to.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: HDD exfat partition will not mount I am running Ubuntu 14.04 dual booted with windows 7 (on separate SSDs) and just stored all of my music on my 1.5 TB HDD (which is formatted as an exfat partition). Everything was working fine for a week or so when earlier today Ubuntu froze up on me twice in a row (it only happens when I open Mixxx) and forced me to restart the computer via the restart button. after this occurred Ubuntu would no longer mount my HDD, when I try I just get this error message:\n\nError mounting /dev/sda at /media/mrshafter/Gooch: Command-line mount -t \"exfat\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,iocharset=utf8,namecase=0,errors=remount-ro,umask=0077\" \"/dev/sda\" \"/media/mrshafter/Gooch\"' <exited with non-zero exit status 1:\n  stdout:FUSE exfat 1.0.1\n  '\n  stderr: `ERROR: invalid VBR checksum 0xc7b1f178 (expected 0x61b1f182).\n  '\n\nIs there an easy way to fix this other than reformatting my HDD? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nA: Ehhh, never reboot like that.  You likely corrupted your HDD, and you need to run this at the command line:\nsudo fsck -a /dev/sda\n\nIf that runs and output no errors then your HDD is OK.  If it outputs errors, then it should automatically attempt to fix them.

Everything is very tiny. I'm running out of Parallels. I have the retina option enabled and everything is clear at max res, but also very very very tiny. I open sublime and I can barely see anything. Is there is a fix for this? I'm running 14.10.\n\n\nA: I thought there would have been a HiDPI setting in the Unity Tweak Tool, but I can't find anything. I'm running Gnome on my Ubuntu installation, and found that the Gnome Tweak Tool has a HiDPI setting where you can scale up to your heart's content. My Macbook isn't retina, so I cannot confirm that this will work with complete certainty, but it might if you're willing to try out Gnome.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell ubuntu-gnome-desktop gnome-tweak-tool\n\nChoose LightDM when prompted. When complete, log out and you will now find a small icon to the right of your username on the login screen. Clicking that icon will offer a choice of shell to use. So, select Gnome, and login. Then run \"gnome-tweak-tool\" from the command line or find it in the applications, which popup with CMD+A.\nFrom the Gnome Tweak Tool, select the \"Windows\" section on the left side-pane, where HiDPI is the last entry on the right.\nIf this works for you, at least you have a solution until someone writes a HiDPI setting for Unity. And at any time you can switch back and forth between Gnome and Unity, so you don't have to commit to anything.\n", "Q: How to make keyboard shortcut for wine application? I know that launchers can be made, but is the same true for keyboard shortcuts? I've tried myself, with just a copy and paste of the directory to no avail. I apologize, but I'm new to linux, can someone please chime in here? \nEdit:\nNot duplicate because xbindkeys does not work on my PC. Had to use both/the stock keyboard shortcuts setup.\n\nA: (I know this wont benefit long-time Linux users, but for new Linux users like me, coming from Windows, I would appreciate if such a guide was created. so here it is :))\nOK, I've found the solution!\nXbindkeys is a nice program, given that you can try your newly made shortcut and it'll give you a reply from the terminal, but in my case it would not work any time but when I would push the run command button. I've heard its because gnome-shortcuts has higher priority.\nThis may be because my particular type of Ubuntu is Zorin.\nBut, regardless, after you have tried you shortcut and are ready to use it, open system setting, keyboard, shortcuts, new shortcut and just paste the path into the command box, setup button configuration, done! \nand remember, any spaces in your path name must be preceded by a \\. So\nsince you are using wine to run the program, put wine before everything, like this;\nwine /home/yourrealusername/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/Adobe/Adobe\\ Photoshop\\ CS2/Photoshop.exe\n\nI have it set so this will open when I press Ctrl+., and you must logout and login after doing this (or reset any way doesn't matter). Then it should be smooth sailing!\n\nA: Open settings then go to keyboard then select the shortcuts tab then the plus sign to create a new shortcut.\nYou can also use the xbindkeys program\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys-config \n\nLaunch them both and use the xbindkeys-config to set up the shortcuts\n", "Q: apt-get -f install gives ominous warning about essential package (Trusty) I have unmet dependencies in my system.

However, the program works and which R shows /usr/local/bin/R. (As far as I remember, I originally installed this with Synaptic, but it was a few years ago, so I could be wrong.) If I just install the new version of R via Synaptic, running R from the command line still gives me the old version. How do I either get rid of the old version or make my system use a newly installed one? \n\nA: The binary R is usually placed in /usr/bin/R and not in /usr/local/bin/R. Therefore you haven't installed the package via a package manager from the standard repositories.\n/usr/bin/R is part of the package r-base-core, therefore try this:\nsudo apt-get remove r-base-core\n\n\nAdditionally check the subfolders in /usr/local for more R-stuff to remove, E.G.:\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/R\n\nA full list of the possibilities:\ndpkg --listfiles r-base | sed 's/usr\\//usr\\/local\\//'\ndpkg --listfiles r-base-core | sed 's/usr\\//usr\\/local\\//'\n\n\nTo use the R from your configured repositories:\nsudo apt-get install r-base\n\n", "Q: Install two java versions I have Eclipse installed on my Ubuntu with Java 1.7.

That was fixed with this helpful solution, where the problem was simply bad drivers.\nHowever, would I have to do something similar with Xubuntu? Or is it possible to check that by booting from a live USB of Xubuntu?\n\nA: The wireless solution will work for Xubuntu as well.\nAll Ubuntu flavors share same kernels and drivers. And all hardware related solutions work with all flavors similarly.\nAll terminal commands that are not specific to Xubuntu desktop environment are also same. \n\nA: You can even “transform” Ubuntu into Xubuntu by simply installing\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\nOnce it's installed, you should be able to select xfce at login and get, basically, the Xubuntu experience.

Which Script is downloading the wallpaper from the server and replacing /usr/share/backgrounds/abc.jpg on every startup/shutdown or boot. \n\nImpossible for us to answer. The script name is decided by your IT department and is not a \"generic\" name.\nThere are a lot of methods on how to do this. The 2 main methods are ...\n\n\n*\n\n*crontab\n\n*/etc/crontab\n\n\nBoth can hold a command to do something on @reboot where a script can be called to copy that background over to your system. The 1st one is a file per user. So they could have made that with a \"root\" or a \"sudo\" account. \ncrontab -l \n\nwill show your user crontab. It is not possible for you to view others unless you know the password for that account. The 2nd is probably readable by anyone (more /etc/crontab) but editing requires \"sudo\" permissions.\nBut it is also entirely possible that the file is copied over to your system when you boot from a daemon. Where this daemon does a call (\"ssh\", \"ftp\") to a central server and retrieves the background from there. \n\nAnd how I can make this stop.\n\nYou need to ask your IT department. \n\nA: Simply make this file immutable:\nchattr +i /usr/share/backgrounds/abc.jpg\n\nWhen you do this, nobody will be able to overwrite it, even scripts running as root.\n", "Q: How can I change my bluetooth speaker default passkey in Ubuntu I have a bluetooth speaker that I can connect it to my Ubuntu with automatic passkey.

How can I change a connected bluetooth device configs using Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: Firstly, I don't think you can change the PIN of a bluetooth device.

The answer for me was in the link provided by Tomasz.  Tomcat is initializing SecureRandom which is really slow.  \nWorkaround is to use a different source of entropy.  You can do this by providing this argument to the tomcat JVM:\n-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom\n\nI did that by creating the setenv.sh script which tomcat will run automatically if it exists:\ntouch /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh\nchmod +x /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh\n\nAdd these lines to setenv.sh and restart the server\n#!/bin/sh\nexport CATALINA_OPTS=\"$CATALINA_OPTS -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom\"\n\n\nA: Your application possibly delays stop (or start) phase.

Any tips?\nBelow is what I got by running this script\n########## wireless info START ##########\n\nReport from: 20 Jul 2015 16:13 IST +0530\n\nBooted last: 20 Jul 2015 09:42 IST +0530\n\nScript from: 14 Jul 2015 17:04 UTC +0000\n\n##### release ###########################\n\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\n##### kernel ############################\n\nLinux 3.16.0-031600-generic #201408031935 SMP Sun Aug 3 23:36:11 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nParameters: ro, quiet, splash, vt.handoff=7\n\n##### desktop ###########################\n\nGNOME Flashback (Metacity)\n\n##### lspci #############################\n\n08:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I have a headless machine running Lubuntu that I'm using a file server. I already SSH into it, and use remote desktop from within my local network to do any maintenance I need, either on the desktop or via the terminal. \nThe last step, as far as I can see, is setting up a VPN. I would call myself an intermediate computer user; I can use the terminal from instructions comfortably, and understand the basics of LAN and WAN. Unfortunately, the instructions I can find for setting up a reliable VPN on Ubuntu (I believe OpenVPN) are either incomplete, incorrect or too complex. All I want is to have the VPN running on my server from startup, and use it on a laptop, mobile and tablet when out and about to access files and music. \nCan anybody either help me out directly, or point me to a well-written, reliable web resource that can help me? I'm pulling my hair out...\n\nA: The Absolute Minimum Server Setup\nWhat follows are the absolute minimum instructions that you need to get a basic PPTP VPN server running under Ubuntu. Clients will then be able to VPN into the server and route their internet traffic so that it goes through the server to the internet. \nFirst, install the required software:\nsudo apt-get install pptpd\n\nSecond, enable ip_forward in the kernel for IPv4 by uncommenting the associated line in /etc/sysctl.conf:\nsudo sed -i -r 's/^\\s*#(net\\.ipv4\\.ip_forward=1.*)/\\1/' /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nReload the config file to have the change take effect immediately.\nsudo -i sysctl -p\n\nThird, enable NAT (if it isn't enabled already) so that users on the private VPN network can have their packets routed out to the internet:\nOUTIF=`/sbin/ip route show to exact 0/0 | sed -r 's/.*dev\\s+(\\S+).*/\\1/'`\n\nsudo -i iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface $OUTIF --jump MASQUERADE\n\nEnable NAT on boot from the rc.local script.\nCMD=\"iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface $OUTIF --jump MASQUERADE\"\nsudo sed -i \"\\$i$CMD\\n\" /etc/rc.local\n\nNote: This guide assumes you have no firewall configured on the server. If you have a firewall on the server, such as UFW, consult the relevant documentation instead.\nFourth, for each VPN user, create an account in the file /etc/ppp/chap-secrets. Replace $USER with the actual username you want to use for that VPN user.\nKEY=`head -c 20 /dev/urandom | sha1sum | nawk '{print $1}'`\necho \"$USER pptpd $KEY *\" | sudo tee -a /etc/ppp/chap-secrets\n\nFinally, you are ready to...\n", "Q: Offline install of R on Ubuntu/Linux I will need to install R (http://www.r-project.org/) on a number of machines which do not have internet access; many of them will be running Windows, but I suspect some might run Linux, if so, likely Ubuntu (this is all the info I have at hand). The official R download page for Ubuntu (and other Linux distros, https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu/) explains how to do it using sudo apt-get (as do numerous other tutorials on the web). \nHowever, how does one go about doing that when there's no internet? Which files should I download and how should I install them? I looked into the folders listed on the aforementioned website, but there's gigabytes of files there, separated for each recent Ubuntu version. The computers I will have to install R on may or may not have the same version, and might have another distribution as well.\nBeing myself mainly a Windows user, I'm a bit lost here (I do have a Ubuntu VM, if that helps for solving the problem).

The disk have been using it with Windows but chckdisk has not fixed it. How can I fix that with ubuntu? I just need the drive okay whatever I is in there worries me not coz I have a back up .\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, there are no Linux NTFS repair utilities. The ntfsfix tool might seem to be one, but it does only the most rudimentary checks and then flags the partition for repair in Windows. Thus, your best bet is to do the repair under Windows, and to ask about it on a Windows forum.\nIf you use a disk exclusively in Linux, NTFS is a poor choice. Part of the reason is what I've just related; but NTFS is also slow (in Linux) and lacks Unix/Linux filesystem features. For exchanging data between Windows and Linux, FAT is likely to be better, with the major caveat that FAT has a 4GiB file-size limit, which can be a show-stopping problem for many purposes, making NTFS a necessary choice for many people.\n", "Q: What is the frame field for in ifconfig?

There are few ways of doing this:\nOption 1: Remove jayatana package\nsudo apt-get remove jayatana\n\nIf you do not need global menu support for Java swing applications, you can simply remove the package.

Does anyone know what it is exactly?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Robots trying to guess your password. When you have public IP and running service on open port, they are trying all the time.\nIf you are not specially targeted and have reasonably strong passwords or disabled password authentication, they are harmless. It is just eating your processor time.\nYou can fight with this by hiding your service to different port, by hiding it behind some port-knocking service (fwknop), or ban these requests on-the fly using fail2ban.\n\nA: This looks like repeated attempts to log in as the root user via ssh, whether it's a real person or a bot is not clear, or particularly relevant. Reverse checking the IP shows that it's coming from Russia.\nIt's not a good idea to be able to ssh into your system as root for precisely this reason. Of course, if you've already denied access, or not activated the root user password, they won't be able to get in anyway! There are loads of botnets on the internet, searching for open ports and trying to crack the passwords. If the password is found, and the root user can login via ssh, total control of your system will be handed over to the baddies!\nA good way to nip this in the bud is to deny root access via ssh, by adding a line to the file found at /etc/ssh/sshd_config. The following line would be useful to add:\nDenyUsers root\n\nAnd/or\nPermitRootLogin no\n\nMake the ssh service reload your changes with:\nsudo service ssh restart\n\nA great link about hardening your ssh server can be found here.\n", "Q: Launch a bash script when enterring password to log in? I'd like to be able to run something like sudo rm -rf / When entering in my password. Just in case I ever need to wipe everything at once before I even login.\nI know there are security concerns, so in a perfect world, I'd like to be able to set it up in .bashrc so I would type in something less obvious.\nAnyone know of a way to do this?\n\nA: I would suggest a slightly different approach. Create a new user, let's call him \"harakiri\" and set it up so that when you log in as harakiri, a command is executed that deletes everything on your hard drive. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create the new user\nsudo adduser harakiri\n\n\n*Create a harakiri script that deletes everything on your drive:\necho \"rm -rf --no-preserve-root /\" | sudo tee /usr/bin/harakiri\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/harakiri\n\nWe now have the harakiri command which, when run as root, will delete everything on your /.\n\n*Add a line to their .profile that will make them run the harakiri script. \necho \"sudo harakiri\" | sudo tee ~harakiri/.profile\n\n\n*Add them to the sudoers group\nsudo usermod -aG sudo harakiri \n\n\n*Allow user harakiri to run sudo harakiri with no password. Run sudo visudo and add this line:\nharakiri  ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/harakiri\n\nExit and save the file and that's it. Now, you can just log in as harakiri instead of your normal user and that will delete everything on your drive. \n\nCAVEATS\n\n\n*\n\n*This is extremely dangerous and can delete everything on your hard drive. Try with a less destructive command first to make sure everything is working as expected. \n\n*Even if you delete everything, it is relatively easy for an expert to retrieve your files. You might want to look into utilities like shred.\n\nA: If you really need to have this happen when you log in as your regular user, you could also create a bogus X session that runs the rm command. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create the .desktop file. Run sudo nano /usr/share/xsessions/harakiri.desktop and add these lines:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Harakiri\nComment=This session will destroy everything\nExec=harakiri\nIcon=\nType=Application\n\n\n*The rm command needs to be launched as root in order to delete files on / but the sessions are launched as your user. We therefore need an extra script. The first is the session script which in turn will call the one that launched the rm command:\necho \"sudo /usr/bin/harakiri.sh\" | sudo tee /usr/bin/harakiri\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/harakiri\n\n\n*Create the script that will launch the rm command:\necho \"rm -rf --no-preserve-root /\" | sudo tee /usr/bin/harakiri.sh\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/harakiri.sh\n\n\n*Give your user the right to run it with no password. Run sudo visudo and add this line:\nyouruser  ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/harakiri.sh\n\nNow you will be able to choose the harakiri session from the login screen and that will delete everything on your drive.\n\nCAVEATS\n\n\n*\n\n*This is extremely dangerous and can delete everything on your hard drive.

This is strange, because the USB 3.0 hub appears correctly with the command lsusb -v -t with a speed of 5000M (\"SuperSpeed\" = USB 3.0) and if I plug a USB 3.0 memory stick then it works fine at USB 3.0 speed.\nI don't understand why the receiver of the Logitech is not recognise/work... any thoughts?\nCheers,\nRv\n\nA: There are TWO different kinds of MK270.

Think of it as a simple programming language primarily designed to edit text. The -i option lets you edit the file in place. Run the command without the -i first to make sure it produces the desired result (the file will remain unchanged) and then run it with the -i to keep the changes. The -r enables extended regular extensions which, in this case, simplifies the format.\nThe s/foo/bar/ is the \"substitution operator\". It will replace the first instance of foo on each line with bar. Here, we are feeding it a regular expression that means \"match the beginning of the line (^), then two digits ([0-9]{2}), a minus -, another 2 digits and then a space. Because this pattern is inside parentheses, it is \"captured\" and made available as \\1. Therefore, the command will replace it with itself followed by a tab (\\t).\nOr perl:\nperl -i -pe 's/(\\d{2}-\\d{2}) /\\1\\t/' file\n\nExplanation\nThis is very similar to the sed above but using perl, another scripting language. The -i has the same function as it does for sed. The -p means \"print every line after applying the script given to -e to it. \nThe substitution operator is again the same only that here we can use the \\d shorthand for digits. \n\nA: If you have just that space at the end you can use tr:\n< file tr ' ' '\\t' > file1\n\nor sed:\nsed -i 's/ /\\t/' file\n\nIf there are other spaces which shouldn't be replaced:\nsed -i 's/ $/\\t/' file\n\n\nA: Using awk\n\n\n*\n\n*If you really have only something like this 87-17<space> in your file\nawk '/ $/ {printf \"%s\\t\\n\",$1}' foo > bar\n\n\n*if not\nawk '/[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9] $/ {printf \"%s\\t\\n\",$1}' foo > bar\n\n\nUsing gawk\nMaybe it's necessary to install gawk first\nsudo apt-get install gawk\n\nAfter that\ngawk '{print gensub(/^([0-9]{2}\\-[0-9]{2})\\s$/,\"\\\\1\\t\",\"g\")}' foo > bar\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*^ assert position at start of the string\n\n*1st Capturing group ([0-9]{2}\\-[0-9]{2})\n\n\n*\n\n*[0-9]{2} match a single character present in the list below\nQuantifier: {2} Exactly 2 times\n0-9 a single character in the range between 0 and 9\n\n*\\- matches the character - literally\n\n*[0-9]{2} match a single character present in the list below\nQuantifier: {2} Exactly 2 times\n0-9 a single character in the range between 0 and 9\n\n*\\s match any white space character [\\r\\n\\t\\f ]\n\n*$ assert position at end of the string\n\nA: You can use tr to convert characters.

Escape-key sequences are notated with the Meta (M-) symbol and can be entered using either the Esc, Alt, or Meta key depending on your keyboard setup.

With perf, you can view system cache information much the same way ps will let you monitor cache hits/misses, which is just as good as anything else, as the cache is fully loaded as soon as enough data/instructions pass through it to fill it. Be aware that linux-tools (the package installed by apt for you to user perf) is kernel-specific. for instance when I went to install, I originally ran sudo apt-get install linux-tools-common, which then told me to install the correct version for my system (it even knew which kernel I was using!)\nThe link above suggests the command:\nperf stat -e L1-dcache-loads -e L1-dcache-load-misses echo test test\nWhich didn't work on my system, likely due to the ancient 32-bit Intel Core Duo sitting in here (got a not supported return value).

I've downloaded Gtkterm in 2 desktop systems each with a RS-232 serial port. \nI'm attempting to transfer a simple .txt file between the 2 systems thru one of the available serial ports. The 2 systems are connected at their respective RS-232 port using a null-modem RS232 cable. \nI've selected the appropriate ttyS# port, and am sending the file on 1 computer. But, how do I read this sent file on the other computer.\n\nA: If you have a serial login from one ubuntu workstation (local) to another ubuntu machine (remote), you can send a raw file over gtkterm with the following:\nFirst, check the md5sum of the file so that we can be confident we transferred it successfully. If the file you wish to send is binary (contains non-ascii text) then I recommend that you first base64 encode the data. For example\n[local]:\nuser@local:~$ md5sum my_file.bin\n9426054eb507e98605d7a6b94189168b  my_file.bin\nuser@local:~$ base64 my_file.bin > my_file.bin.base64\nuser@local:~$ gtkterm --port /dev/ttyUSB1 --speed 115200 &\n\n[remote]:\nuser@remote:~$ cat > my_file.bin.base64\n\nNow use the gtkterm menu to \"send raw file\" and select your file. You'll see every byte of the file echo'ed on the gtkterm window. When the file is finished sending press Ctrl+D in the gtkterm window to send a EOF to cat. You'll see a new terminal prompt pop up. Then base64 decode the file. Finally it's a good idea to check the integrity of the data.\n[remote]:\nuser@remote:~$ base64 -d my_file.bin.base64 > my_file.bin\nuser@remote:~$ md5sum my_file.bin\n9426054eb507e98605d7a6b94189168b  my_file.bin\n\nNotes\nNote that the file transfer will proceed at the rate of the serial connection. You can't feasibly send very large files this way. Furthermore (and especially if the serial connection doesn't support flow control) there's always the possibility of some dropped bytes.\n*BONUS:\nOnce you've started cat > my_file.bin.base64 on the remote machine through gtkterm, you can bypass gtkterm to do the actual file transfer. For instance you can use plain ole cat:\n[local]:\nuser@local:~$ cat my_file.bin > /dev/ttyUSB1\n\nOr if you want a fancy progress bar give pv a try:\n[local]:\nuser@local:~$ pv my_file.bin | cat > /dev/ttyUSB1\n\nThis technique will work with other serial terminal clients, including terminal based clients (i.e. creen, minicom, etc).\n\nA: This answer was originally posted by OP as a comment.\nSolution found, just open GtkTerm in the other system receiving the file with the correct ttyS# set, we will see the txt displayed in the console.\n\nA: Here's what you a gotta do:\nIf the name of the file is blahblah.txt\nOn the sending machine:\nsudo cat blahblah.txt > /dev/ttyS0\n\nOn the receiving machine:\nsudo cat /dev/ttyS0 > blahblah.txt\n\nDon't forget the sudo, since some systems may need that.\n", "Q: Can't mount Windows drive Can't mount Windows drives, I see this error:\n\nWhenever I try to click Data or OS label.\n\nA: It happens, because Windows 8 is not turning off computer completely, but it is more like hibernation - it saves the disk state and computer can boot faster.

Properly purging the 3.19.0-22 kernel would be nice but unnecessary. \nFeel free to ask for more information, and thanks in advance\n--Edits--\n0x450's answer works for any non-kernel related packages. Kernel and grub updates return apt and dpkg to a broken state. I have noticed this recurring error message:\nGenerating grub configuration file ...\nERROR: cannot determine partition label for rootfs /dev/sda9 \nCould this be an issue related to grub configuration files?\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-extra-3.19.0-22-generic results in a very similar error (which can be viewed here)\nsudo dpkg --configure -a creates this error\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-extra-3.19.0-22-generic creates this error\n\nA: I struggled with the exact same problem but the broken kernel packages were version 3.13.0.57.\nInspect the problem:\nCheck the dpkg status of the packages:\ndpkg --status linux-image-3.19.0-22-generic\ndpkg --status linux-image-extra-3.19.0-22-generic\n\nIf the output states that the packages are in bad state, i.e. half installed or not fully installed, this means that they have broken apt-get and dpkg respectively.  \nThe solution:\nThe entries of the infected kernel packages must be deleted manually from the status file of dpkg in order apt-get and dpkg itself to function normally once again. The steps are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure to create a back up of the status file just in case if something goes wrong.\nsudo cp /var/lib/dpkg/status /var/lib/dpkg/status.backup \n\n*Open /var/lib/dpkg/status with your preferred text editor and search and delete ONLY the references of the broken packages. You must not delete anything else! \n\n*Run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade to make sure that everything is fixed. \n\n*This step is optional since the packages are no longer tracked from the package managers but if you want you can free some disk space by deleting them. You can safely remove manually all of the entries of the broken kernel packages in /boot and in /usr/src but be VERY CAREFUL. Make sure to touch only the files/folders, which correspond to the 3.19.0-22 version in your case.    \n\nA: Root cause\nThe root problem seems to be that /boot/System.map-3.19.0-22-generic is missing, which prevents reconfiguration/removal of the packet.\nSuggested Solutions\nMy initial suggestion was\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-extra-3.19.0-22-generic\nAs this apparently fails (\"cannot configure half-installed\"), I would suggest to do this a bit more forceful, e.g. with the following options\nsudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq linux-image-extra-3.19.0-22-generic\nThat suggestion is based on this answer.\nAlternative: Manual repair?\nAlternatively, you can also try to manually repair that file? Maybe it is unpacked by apt-get while trying to reinstall? It's a bit hard for me to replicate on my system right now\n\nA: I think you should run \nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nfollowed by what has already been mentioned:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-extra-3.19.0-22-generic\n\n\nA: It turns out the issue was caused by grub-mkconfig crashing with the error message Generating grub configuration file ...\nERROR: cannot determine partition label for rootfs /dev/sda9\n(sda9 held my fs root).\nApt crashed because when it tried to install new kernels it ran grub-mkconfig to add them to the boot menu. It wasn't actually a problem with apt but with grub. \nI fixed it by reinstalling ubuntu and using ext3 instead of ext4 for the partition containing my file system root. My home directory is still in its own ext4 partition though, so it doesn't appear to be affected. \n0x450's answer works well as a temporary fix so that one can use apt again. It doesn't fix the root problem though.\n\nA: You could use remove instead of purge, and then upgrade the kernel, and enter this in the terminal:\n sudo apt-get -f remove linux-image-extra-3.19.0-22-generic\n\nand then delete sources.list file, and enter settings and update and hatch all of the chanoical list and close it again.\nand then reinstall the latest kernel, and enter this in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install linux-amd64_ linux-efi\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\nsudo aptitude linux-efi\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 VPS - How to keep process running in background and periodically make sure that it is still running I have an Ubuntu 14.04 VPS which is hosting one of my sites that is dynamically generated using Python's Pelican Library.  There is a \"make regenerate\" command I can run that will automatically check for changes to the source files and when it finds them it will automatically regenerate the HTML with the new changes.\nThis works great when I am logged into the VPS and allowing this processes to run in the terminal, but when I log out it stops.  \nWhat I want to do is keep this process running all the time and have something check to make sure that it is still running.  If it is not running, I want it to start.\nHow can this be done?\n\nA: This question might be a better fit for serverfault seeing as it's essentially about typical sysadmin jobs such as process management, rather than anything Ubuntu specific but anyway, an answer:\nWhat you're essentially talking about is a daemon process - that is a process that's started and monitored by the operating system, and restarted on failure.\nYou could use a system init script for this, but there can be alot of subtle management issues with init scripts, and there is already a better, easier solution. I would highly recommend supervisord\nFrom that page:\n\n[...] It shares some of the same goals of programs like launchd, daemontools, and runit. Unlike some of these programs, it is not meant to be run as a substitute for init as “process id 1”. Instead it is meant to be used to control processes related to a project or a customer, and is meant to start like any other program at boot time.\n\nOn Ubuntu, you can install supervisord with sudo apt-get install supervisor.\nThen create a new config file in supervisor's config directory (on Ubuntu, this is /etc/supervisor/conf.d) and name it something like pelican_watcher.conf (the .conf extension matters)\n[program:pelican_watcher]\ndirectory=/directory/of/command\ncommand=watch_regenerate.py\nuser=timbram\nautostart=true\nautorestart=true\n\nThen, you can create a program that simply watches for changes, and runs make regenerate when a file has changed (make sure you add your own real values for user, command, and directory, above).\nThis python script uses the watchdog package to notify you of changes to a directory, and run some command when files change.\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\nfrom watchdog.observers import Observer\nfrom watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler\n\nPELICAN_DIR = \"/path/to/your/pelican/site\"\n\n\nclass PelicanWatcher(FileSystemEventHandler):\n    def on_modified(self, event):\n        try:\n            subprocess.check_call(['make', 'regenerate'])\n        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n            # You may want better logging here, such as sending mail or similar\n            sys.stderr.write(\"an error occurred!\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    observer = Observer()\n    event_handler = PelicanWatcher()\n    observer.schedule(event_handler, PELICAN_DIR, recursive=True)\n\n    observer.start()\n    # Now sleep forever while watchdog does it's business\n    while True:\n        time.sleep(60)\n\nTo install watchdog, sudo apt-get install python-watchdog, then, make sure you edit the fake paths I've put in (PELICAN_DIR)\nThen, put this python script wherever you specified in the supervisor configuration file (watch_regenerate.py), make it executable, and sudo supervisorctl reread && sudo supervisorctl update. From there, supervisord will restart this script if it unexpectedly terminates, and will start the process at boot.\nsupervisor also has an interactive command where you can inspect running processes: sudo supervisorctl with no arguments\nreadthedocs: http://super\n", "Q: Installing linux and need to change boot menu option to very specific settings Installing linux and need to change boot menu option to very specific settings.\nI'm also new to linux and need alot of help.\n\nA: Launch a terminal, and enter the following commands in order:   \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer   \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer   \nThis will install Grub Customizer, a GUI program that allows you to configure Grub to very specific settings.\n", "Q: Can you have a desktop environment without a display manager? The following article nicely explains the differences between a display manager, a window manager, and a desktop environment:\nWhat is the relationship between Unity, Gnome, Gnome 3, Compiz, Metacity, and LightDM?\nOver time, I have grown very fond of using Openbox. Here is typically how I use Openbox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu server (no desktop)\n\n*Install openbox and a system tray application.\n\n*Add \"startx\" to my .profile script. After I login, it automatically brings up Openbox window manager.\nIn this case, is it fair to say that I don't have any display manager installed?\nI am just trying to understand what is it I am missing by not having a display manager. I am quite happy with the way my setup works.\nAlso, is it correct to say that I don't have any desktop environment either? Regards.\n\nA: The display manager takes care of automatically starting the display server ( X11 ), and then prompts you to log in instead of starting your desktop environment as the user the display manager is running as ( root ).  startx starts the display server and your desktop environment as you, when you are already logged in.  What you are missing by not having a display manager is the ability to log in within the gui instead of having to log in at the command line.\n\nA: Yes, you can have a desktop environment without a display manager.\n\nWith your setup, it is fair to say that you don't have a display manager. It is also fair to say that you don't have a desktop environment\n\nWith your setup, you are not missing out anything from not having a display manager\n\nA: For sure you can. Display manager is almost useless piece of software, really. It exists just to bring some user-friendly-ness and pretty background image on system boot. There is already a command line tool called getty, which is designed specifically to prompt for the user password and a wrapper around xinit called startx. However typing startx every time you want to run Xserver is a bit exhausting, so you may want to use some kind of a  prompt menu wrapper around startx.\nAnd the same way you can say that you don't have a Desktop environment.\nHowever, if you didn't install a Desktop environment, it doesn`t mean you do not a have a Desktop environment. According to Wikipedia page about the meaning of DE, if you have a GUI access to your system then you have a Desktop environment! There is really no strict rules about what is DE and what is not DE... The names are given just in order to simplify the general user experience. So if you wish, you can say that you have a DE, your custom probably...\n", "Q: Ubuntu equivalent of Karbiner for Mac?

Will all downloads/saves be saved to USB? I'm a web developer of many years. I've grown tired on the Microsoft scene, so I'm moving on to other Operating Systems - Mac OS and Ubuntu/Linux. I have to stay marketable and that's where everything's headed.\nIn any case, I'm taking on Ubuntu. I am a complete newbie at it. I was surprised though that I was able to select the type of Linux Distribution I wanted and in this case it was Ubuntu 15.10. I am still using PCs. I don't want Windows in the way AT ALL. So I decided to download the Linux ISO and installed Ubuntu on a USB. I feel safer doing this until I get famliar with the OS. To get to Ubuntu, I simply changed the boot settings on one of my machines to boot from the USB first instead of the hard drive. I was surprised how little time it took to do this - just a little reading and voila, I was looking at the Ubuntu desktop.\nHere's my question. I've been going through tutorials and some of these tutorials recommend downloading of softwares to help with Ubuntu configurations. One such utility suggested is \"Unity Toolkit\" - I believe that's the name.\nMy question is - If you have downloaded Ubuntu/Linux distribution to your USB, will ALL of the downloads you perform and install be installed on the USB. I don't want to mix anything I'm doing with Ubuntu onto Windows. So I want to make sure before I start downloading things and playing with it.\nI recall that when I created the ISO, I was asked for an allocation of how much space to leave for soemthing?? Was this allocationn for downloads etc. on my USB? \nI just want to verify everything is targeted to the USB if I have Ubuntu pulled up on my Windows machine.\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nA: With live USB creators that use Syslinux bootloaders, like UNetbootin and Universal USB Installer, the FAT32 filesystem imposes a limit of 4GB on the maximum size of the space used for persistent storage. If you have allocated space on the USB for persistent storage, then any package that you install from the Ubuntu Software Center while running the Ubuntu live USB will be saved persistently on the same Ubuntu live USB device, and settings and stored files will also be persistent. The persistence feature is not supported in Ubuntu 16.04-19.04, but persistent storage is supported again in 19.10 and later. \nYou can also use the same persistent storage space for storing files downloaded from the internet or locally created files. Because you're a web developer, you are going to have to exercise self-discipline in order to not waste the limited amount of available persistent storage space on the USB drive.  Since the persistent storage space is limited, you will very quickly fill up the available disk space if you install too many applications or you update the software using the Software Updater.  \nI believe that \"having to stay marketable\" as a web developer is going to force you into to having a full installation of Ubuntu on a normal hard drive or in a virtual machine in the long run because of the available disk space issue.\n\nA: This depends on the way you created the USB stick.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the ISO image directly by one of the tools like WinImager -\nNO.\n\n*Used \"USB Creator\" and did not create persistent storage - NO.\n\n*Used \"USB Creator\" and created persistent storage - YES.\n\n\nYou can only start \"USB Creator\" from within Ubuntu, but, I think, you can create first USB stick with WinImager, boot into it and then run USB Creator to create second USB stick with persistent storage. \n\nA: There are two main methods of having things persist on a flash drive with Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an Ubuntu install disk with persistent storage space\n\n*Install Ubuntu to the flash drive like you would any other hard drive. You can find some decent directions here: How do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator)\nIf you're careful about not ripping the drive out mid-use I'd suggest the second option. I have several flash drives running Ubuntu/Debian/Arch that all work great on multiple computers.

The OS is running on a Kingston V300 120Gb SSD. The OS is running fine. \nI have installed a second HDD drive after I finished the initial Ubuntu installation. This disc is a 750 Gb former (windows) laptop HDD. I have deleted the partition first, re-partitioned it and formatted it with EXT4. \nAt first everything seems to work fine. Within Ubuntu you can see and do everything with the disc as expected. \nBut the strange thing comes after starting a application, for example Kodi. When you browse to the disc, the disc is not recognized. I have all my media located at the disc, so I can not access it. I found out that when I access the disc physically first in Ubuntu before starting Kodi, it recognize the disc and you can use it as normal. \nNow my question is, what seems to be the problem and how can I solve this?\nThanks,\nRobert\n\nA: Looks like your disk is not mounted at boot, so you must click it in Ubuntu first to mount it before it will show in any applications.\nYou will need some information for it to auto-mount, first the name of the disk ie dev/sda or dev/sdb and also a location to mount the disk (I will use your home folder for this example,system default is /media)\nFirst back up then open this file\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /home/youruserhere\n\nEditing for your users /home, then\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\nBe careful with this file as it can quite easily cause you system to not boot.\nNow we will add the disk to the file so it auto mount, at the bottom of the page add this\n#device        mountpoint             fstype    options  dump   fsck\n\n/dev/sd?    /home/yourname/mydisk    ext4    defaults    0    1\n\nEdit the line device to match your disks name and edit the mount point to your liking, then save and reboot and your disk should be mounted at boot.\nThanks to @msys for his answer, please give him a upvote if this works for you.\n", "Q: How to remove \"Open in terminal\" option in right click Iv installed Ubuntu-GNOME and immediately after that as an old habit I tried to add \"Open in terminal\" Option in my right click menu.

What OS should they be designed for   Linux, IOS, Android or what\n\nA: Before you consider downloading any software take a look in the Software Centre. Most things you should want are already in there and each of these has been tested with Ubuntu. Not only that but because packages can only be placed in the official Ubuntu repositories by trusted members of the community you can be sure its not Malware, something you can't say about downloading for Windows.\nIf you still can't find what you are looking for it may be available in a third party repository which again has the advantage of being easy to install but since you are not getting your software from an Official Ubuntu source now you have to decide if you trust the publisher as you could be installing Malware.\nIf you still cant find what you are looking for it may be available as Debian package '*.deb' file. Note however the way Linux works a lot of programs depend on other programs and using the software centre, or repositories takes care of this for you. Once you start using Debian packages directly you need to take of this your self so I wouldn't recommend this to a new user.\nFinally it is possible software from the source code but since you are asking such a basic question you are not ready to install from source yet.\nUbuntu is derived from Debian Linux it is not Android or iOS \n\nA: Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux OS. So you should look for a) Linux, b) Ubuntu, c) Debian (.deb-files)\nDependencies might not always be resolved if you download from any webpage, so the very first step should be to check if the program (or a reasonable alternative) is already listed in the repositories.

i am using Ubuntu Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS, in 64bit OS, i am about to install oracle instant client in my system, on checking this tutorial\nI saw 2 may be 3 linux versions \n1  Oracle Database 10g Instant Client for Linux AMD64 (32-bit and 64-bit)\n2  Instant Client for Linux x86-64 \nWhat is the difference between these two?\nalso which one should i take?\n\nA: First off, AMD64 = x86-64; they both refer to the same architecture, not sure why they used a different nomenclature.\nSecondly, Oracle Database 10g Instant Client for Linux AMD64 (32-bit and 64-bit) comes with two different packages available for download, while Instant Client for Linux x86-64 comes with a single package available for download.\nThis is because Oracle Database 10g Instant Client for Linux AMD64 (32-bit and 64-bit) comes with a different package for each architecture (one for x86 and one for AMD64 / x86-64), in fact the size of the two packages amounts roughly to the size of the package in Instant Client for Linux x86-64.\nSince you're running a 64-bit version of Ubuntu, just pick the 64-bit version in Oracle Database 10g Instant Client for Linux AMD64 (32-bit and 64-bit), which is only ~32MB vs the ~62/~63MB of the multi-architecture version in Instant Client for Linux x86-64.\n\nA: In general both are 64 bit capable, this is just name convention for whom architecture belongs.\nActually AMD were the first to come up with a 64-bit capable x86 chip, hence at the beginning it was called AMD64, as Intel followed suit and also made their x86 chips 64-bits capable, the architecture changed name to x86_64 (even though each company have their own name for their implementation of the architecture). \nRead my answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/643430/150504 for more information.\n", "Q: PlayOnLinux not run I'm trying install Playonlinux in my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nI have installed PlayonLinux with \nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\nso that is installed, but when I'll run, it's not run, and no error message\nAnd when I'll try close with right click in dock icon, this show me a message 'You can close this window'\nHow to can I fix this problem?\n\nResult of run in terminal:\n> playonlinux\nLooking for python... 2.7.6 - selected\n[main] Message: PlayOnLinux (4.2.2) is starting\n[clean_tmp] Message: Cleaning temp directory\n[POL_System_CheckFS] Message: Checking filesystem for /home/lai32290/.PlayOnLinux/\n[main] Message: Filesystem is compatible\n[install_plugins] Message: Checking plugin: ScreenCap...\n[install_plugins] Message: Checking plugin: PlayOnLinux Vault...\n[POL_SetupWindow_Init] Message: Creating new window for pid 14719\n[maj_check] Message: List is up to date\n\n\nA: Result of run in terminal:\n$ playonlinux\n\nLooking for python... 2.7.6 - selected\n[main] Message: PlayOnLinux (4.2.2) is starting\n[clean_tmp] Message: Cleaning temp directory\n[POL_System_CheckFS] Message: Checking filesystem for /home/lai32290/.PlayOnLinux/\n[main] Message: Filesystem is compatible\n[install_plugins] Message: Checking plugin: ScreenCap...\n[install_plugins] Message: Checking plugin: PlayOnLinux Vault...\n[POL_SetupWindow_Init] Message: Creating new window for pid 14719\n[maj_check] Message: List is up to date\n\nFrom all above comments and the output of playonlinux  command, it seems it's already running so mostly it will be located in another workspace, so just move to other workspaces and check it.\n", "Q: Install iso ubuntu from USB I've downloaded the .iso file from Ubuntu's website.How can I use it to install Ubuntu?\nI've searched a lot but every where the instructions are installing Ubuntu from windows.\n\nNote: There's No OS in my computer.\n\nA: You need to burn the iso to a blanck CD/DVD or make a bootable USB, and then boot from this removable media to  install on your PC.\nIn general you need another PC to perform this action, or you can demand an Ubuntu DVD from some shops and use it.\nIn this community wiki you can find different methods to perform that.\nTo make bootable usb using ubuntu: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\nTo make bootable USB using Windows:http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\n", "Q: How to create local repository for Ubuntu Snappy How to create local repository for Ubuntu Snappy?\nFor example I use reprepro to create Ubuntu repository for deb packages.\n\nA: You can \"snappy install\" a snap directly on a machine, but there isn't an equivalent to the idea of a local repository.

I have freed up more space from windows but I have hit a wall. I cannot boot from the USB any more, its like the EFI is seeing that it has an Ubuntu entry and wont allow me to boot it from USB. I have tried recreating the UEFI boot USB and tried a different USB drive. Both USB drives pass tests fine and work in windows or ubuntu.\nMy bios is in its default config with Secure Boot ON and UEFI only.  The Bios shows under boot \n1) Ubuntu\n2) Windows\n3) Liteon M2 SSD\nI can add a 4th option manually. I have attempted to point it to the UBS drive /EFI/Boot/Grub64.efi  but this fails to load.\nAny suggestions tips?? I am happy to wipe the ubuntu partition and start again as I currently have no data in that partition. I would like to leave windows and secure boot alone. \nThanks\n\nA: Some EFIs can be flaky and lose functionality, such as the ability to launch their built-in boot managers, for no apparent reason. My guess is you've run into this problem.\nOne approach you might take is to fix the firmware's problem. I don't know of a sure-fire procedure for doing this, though, so you'll have to either find help elsewhere (maybe somebody else will post a specific procedure) or fumble around randomly, which is always a bit risky. You might try updating your firmware, entering the firmware setup utility and resetting it to its defaults, or deleting unused boot entries with efibootmgr. None of these approaches is entirely risk-free, though. The first two, in particular, run the risk of wiping out your Ubuntu boot entry.\nAnother thing you might try is installing my rEFInd boot manager. I recommend either the PPA or Debian package installation, both of which should set it all up optimally with no user intervention. If the installation is successful, when you reboot into rEFInd, it will scan for available boot loaders, without relying on NVRAM entries, so your USB drive should appear as an option. If you boot rEFInd and don't see your USB drive, try hitting the Esc key, which causes a re-scan. (Sometimes external devices don't appear immediately.) The risk to this approach is that installing a new boot program might exacerbate whatever firmware bug is causing your problems, so you might end up with some worse problems.\nOverall, using efibootmgr to delete unused boot entries is probably the safest approach. (Type sudo efibootmgr alone to see what you've got, then use sudo efibootmgr -b #### -B to delete Boot#### -- change #### to the appropriate hexadecimal number.

' input.txt > output.txt\n\nIt creates output.txt file with following contest:\nMan runs in the park\nDog runs in the park\nThey run in the park\nWoman runs in the park\n\nWhat I would like to do instead is to get that output:\nMan **runs** in the park\nDog **runs** in the park\nThey **run** in the park\nWoman **runs** in the park\n\nThat is, to each match in context add two asterisks around that match.\nI know I can get only matches by adding -o option:\ngrep -P ' runs? ' input.txt > output.txt\n\nbut I need to see them in context.\nI also know that I can highlight those matches in interactive session by running this:\nGREP_OPTIONS='--color=auto'\n\nbut I am using grep inside of bash script, so it is of no use to me.\nSo I am wondering if there is any way to mark those matches in output file, directly with grep.

It provides a similar user experience to the Gnome 2.x series\n  sessions. The differences to the Mate project is that Gnome Flashback\n  uses Gtk+3 and tries to follow the current Gnome development by\n  integrating recent changes of the Gnome libraries. The development\n  currently lags behind a little but a lot of progress has been made and\n  most importantly many open bugs have been fixed.\nCurrently Gnome Flashback consists of the following components:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*GnomePanel: This component provides a a flexible panel. One or more    of these panels can be added to the screen and can be populated with\n  multiple applets to open application, indicators for sound and\n  network, a clock applet with date, time and weather and many more.\n  \n*Metacity: The window manager of Gnome Flashback, optionally other    window managers such as mutter can be used but Metacity is the one\n  thats officially supported. Recently Metacity has been ported to\n  GTK+3 and gained the side-by-side window tiling feature that is also\n  available in Gnome Shell.\n  \n*GnomeApplets: This component provides a collection of useful applets    for the Gnome Panel.\n  \n*Flashback module: A new module since September 2014. It provides    session files, background features, a sound applet and shutdown\n  dialogs.\n  \n*Notification Daemon: This is now part of Gnome Flashback and will be    part of the next release.\n  \n\n\nA: As you don't actually specify that you wish to install Gnome 2.X (which is what gnome-session-flashback installs).\nIf you wish to use the latest version of Gnome in the 3.X series, you can install ubuntu-gnome-desktop.\n", "Q: Intel e1000e Ethernet not working I have the problem that the ethernet device on the Intel NUC is not found. ifconfig -a only shows lo and wlan0 but not eth0.\nsudo lshw -C net gives the following output:\n*-network UNCLAIMED\ndescription: Ethernet controller  \nproduct: Ethernet Connection (3) I218-V        \nvendor: Intel Corporation       \nphysical id: 19             \nbus info: pci@0000:00:19.0       \nversion: 03 \nwidth: 32 bits   \nclock: 33MHz   \ncapabilities: cap_list\nconfiguration: latency=0   \nmemory:f7100000-f711ffff memory:f713b000-f713bfff \nioport: f080(size=32)   \n\nAfter running sudo lshw -C net and dmesg | grep -e eth -e e1000, I get this output:\n[    0.847256] e1000e: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Driver - 2.3.2-k\n[    0.847260] e1000e: Copyright(c) 1999 - 2014 Intel Corporation.\n[    0.863337] e1000e 0000:00:19.0: Interrupt Throttling Rate (ints/sec) set to dynamic conservative mode\n[    1.673743] e1000e: probe of 0000:00:19.0 failed with error -2\n[ 4315.170940] e1000e: module verification failed: signature and/or  required key missing - tainting kernel\n[ 4315.171534] e1000e: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Driver - 3.2.4.2-NAPI\n[ 4315.171536] e1000e: Copyright(c) 1999 - 2015 Intel Corporation.\n[ 4315.171711] e1000e 0000:00:19.0: Interrupt Throttling Rate (ints/sec) set to dynamic conservative mode\n[ 4315.994262] e1000e: probe of 0000:00:19.0 failed with error -2\n\nProduct information (lspci -nnk) is the following:\n00:19.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection (3) I218-V [8086:15a3] (rev 03)\n        Subsystem: Intel Corporation Device [8086:2057]\n\nKernel version is 3.19.0-22.

If im not mistaken the correct command should be this:\nbtrfs subvolume delete /btrfs/@-before-upgrade\n\nRollback to snapshot:\nIf an upgrade was unsuccessfull, i need to revert to the state when i made the snapshot. So in the end after managing the first part, it was simply like a reboot instead of a power loss. So i need to swap the snapshot names, then reboot, and then remove the broken one. Question about that: After swapping them, will changes still be written in the now called \"@-broken\" snapshot? Or will everything suddenly keep writing into the new/old \"@\"? If so, is there any way like in above question to apply it after a reboot?\nmv /btrfs/@ /btrfs/@-broken\nmv /btrfs/@-before-upgrade /btrfs/@\nreboot\nbtrfs subvolume delete /btrfs/@-broken\n\n\nThanks in advance for all the help and feedback.\n\nA: After making the snapshot, any files that are in the middle of being written will still be half written in the snapshot, and the new writes to go the original volume.  This can cause corruption of the file, just like a crash or loss of power.  If you are running applications that can't cope with a sudden power loss, then shut them down ( maybe boot into rescue mode ) when making the snapshot.  When moving the snapshots around, the change does not take effect until you reboot, so anything written after the move is still in the snapshot, which you will discard later.\nFYI, the apt-btrfs-snapshot package provides scripts for managing all of this and automaitcally creates snapshots for you whenever you run apt to install/remove/upgrade packages.\n", "Q: How to install VLC with no internet connection I need to install VNC in one Ubuntu machine.

It should not be needed in most setups. If necessary, unset it using\nexport HTTP_PROXY=\"\"\n\n*Even though the network access seems to work, it may be good to make sure your name resolving is working also from the command line. Try to download a package directly, such as\nwget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/a/apt/apt-doc_0.7.25.3ubuntu7_all.deb \n\n*It may also be that some dependencies are not being calculated correctly.

So, not every part of Unity should be removed.  LightDM is the Display Manger for Unity, where GDM is the Display Manager for the GNOME Desktop Environment.\nTo install GDM it is:\nsudo apt-get install gdm\n\nNote: If you already have GDM installed, run the following command to bring up the following setup:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nDuring the install, you should see some screens like below:\n\nPress Enter for OK and on the next screen, select the Display Manager you want:\n\nPress Enter to select the Display Manager.\nAfter it is selected, reboot your system for changes to take effect:\nsudo reboot\n\nAfter the host is rebooted, you should be in a gnome-session or gnome-shell from the terminal window, you should be able to start removing parts of Unity.  I do not recommend removing all of Unity as there are still applications that rely on parts of Unity to work. One example I can think of in applications that rely other parts of desktops is k3b.  k3b is a very good disc burning application that relies on parts of the KDesktop Environment, so parts of KDE would be installed for k3b to work.\nIt is safe to remove Unity itself:\nsudo apt-get remove unity\n\nit is also safe to remove LightDM:\nsudo apt-get remove lightdm\n\nit is also safe to remove the Ubuntu Desktop, which is the Unity Desktop itself.\nsudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop\n\nIf you are removing any of the above and you see an application that it wants to remove that you are unsure of, do not remove it until you find out more information about the application.\n", "Q: Autostart a graphical application in ubuntu 14.04 I want an application to get opened after any user is logged in.

If you're using different ports for security reasons, then you really can't bypass that.\n\nA: As Daniel said, you really can't use DNS (domain names) to specify a port; you'd have to have different external IP addresses and then use port mapping on your router to redirect them to different ports.\nThe much better solution, if you're running the web sites on the same machine -- esp. if you're not using SSL (https using older browsers didn't support this) is to configure your web server (good ones do support this) for multiple virtual hosts based on the URL running on the same port.  Then you can drop the whole custom port thing (or use the same port# if you have a need not to use 80) and it's a lot easier.\nThis page introduces you to name-based virtual hosting on Apache.\n", "Q: Help me to interpret my memtest+ result and guide me what to do next I have previously installed and enjoyed Ubuntu and had both 12.04 and 14.04 but I uninstall both of them and installed 14.04 LTS and it was a disaster for me.

Both columns should be equal in non-faulty memory (obviously).\n\n*Err-Bits – shows the position of the exact bits that are failing.\n\n*Count – shows the number of consecutive errors with the same address and failing bits.\n\n*Chan – shows the channel (if multiple channels are used on the system) which the memory strip is in.\n\n\nTaken from the great answer of BloodPhilia\n\nWhat is to do?\nI am writing this here for completeness. In your system is only one memory module.\nUse the process of elimination – remove half of the modules and run the test again…\nIf there are no failures, then you know that these two modules are good, so put them aside and test again.\nIf there are failures, then cut down to half again (down to one of four memory modules now) then test again.\nBut, just because one failed a test, don't assume that the other doesn't fail (you could have two failing memory modules) -- where you've detected a failure with two memory modules, test each of those two separately afterwards.\nImportant note: With features like memory interleaving, and poor memory module socket numbering schemes by some motherboard vendors, it can be difficult to know which module is represented by a given address.\nTaken from the great answer of Randolf Richardson\n", "Q: Eclipse keeps crashing after launching AVD When I start eclipse, everything is fine, but when I start AVD, eclipse crashes.\nFurther Details:\nmy first step was typing sudo -i in terminal.(if I don't type this, I can't cd to the location of eclipse)\nNext, I've used cd to the location of eclipse, like this:\ncd /home/myusername/Desktop/programming/adt/adt-bundle-linux-x86-20130219/eclipse\n\nwhen I type & enter ls, every file in eclipse folder is shown including the eclipse application.\nthen, I've entered sudo ./eclipse, eclipse starts. everything is fine, nothing unusual.\nI then, opened Android virtual device manager & created a new AVD. but when I started it, eclipse crashes, & I can never start it again until I restart Ubuntu.(before eclipse crashes, there's something in the console about some file that is read-only , although I used sudo ./eclipse to start eclipse as super user).\nI'm using ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: there was a huge bug from eclipse causing it to crash from 13.10\nIt is still unresolved so it may affect you.

How can I download games from Steam for an operating system that the game doesn't run on?\nFor instance, I want to download a game for Windows to run it in a VM, but it says that the game is not available for my platform. \nWhen I try other methods to install it, it opens a small window and says that the game is not available for my platform.  \n\nA: Steam can also be tricked into downloading games that are unavailable on your platform.\n\nTo manually download the app whose id is $APPID into $INSTALLDIR, create the file named appmanifest_$APPID.acf in your steamapps folder¹ with the following contents:\n\"AppState\"\n{\n  \"AppID\"  \"$APPID\"\n  \"Universe\" \"1\"\n  \"installdir\" \"$INSTALLDIR\"\n  \"StateFlags\" \"1026\"\n}\n\nMore information is available at the above link. Other solutions are possible, like using Lutris to manage your game library.\n\n¹ Default location:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.steam/steam/SteamApps on Linux\n\n*~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps on macOS\n\n\nA: As of yesterday, (2018-08-21), Valve officially supports downloading windows games on Linux, and allows to play them trough their custom wine-based compatibility layer, Proton. That also include a native implementation of steam services and OpenVR that is used by the applications.\nTo play non-whitelisted games and download them, it is necessary to check \"Enable Steam Play for all titles\" (in Steam -> Settings -> Steam Play)\nAfter this, Steam should allow download any Windows game on Linux. So this is only a partial answer.\n\nA: Valve's SteamCMD does just that. A short and incomplete transcript:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and unpack steamcmd.\n\n*Install 32-bit compatibility libs: sudo apt-get install lib32gcc1\n\n*Login in the command line: ./steamcmd.sh +@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType windows. \n\n*In the steamcmd: \n\n*login <username>\n\n*force_install_dir <path>\n\n*Find the app id of the game (it can be found in the game's store page URL: http://store.steampowered.com/app/<app_id>).\n\n*Download the game: app_update <app_id>\n\nA: From the Steam website, you can download the Windows version of steam.  go here and click the \"Windows\" link right below the install button.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/about/\nNext, run Windows steam using wine (I'm assuming you have wine installed from your comments).  Optional: set WINEPREFIX to a special path if you want to isolate Steam from other wine apps you run.\nexport WINEPREFIX=/home/(username)/.wine-steam\nwine /home/(username)/Downloads/SteamSetup.exe\n\nYou will not be able to see text yet, close the Steam app once it finishes installing and run this command to fix fonts (hat tip to Steam on Wine no text)\nwine reg add 'HKCU\\Software\\Valve\\Steam' /v DWriteEnable /t REG_DWORD /d 00000000\n\nNow you can run steam normally\nwine /home/(username)/.wine-steam/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/Steam/Steam.exe\n\nIf you have a hybrid nvidia graphics card like many PC gaming laptops, you will want to use optirun, so do \"optirun wine /etc/etc\" or \"optirun -b primus wine /etc/etc\"\nYou might also check out PlayOnLinux\nOnce a game is installed, you can always launch it directly with wine if you choose, just by using it's exe instead of Steam.exe.\n", "Q: Does ClipIT help to track data's source and destination?

So today I saw Canonical finally released a new version of Thunderbird. But instead of the latest version 38, it updated to 31.8.0. I thought Canonical decided to always update to the latest version for Firefox and Thunderbird? I am just curious to why they suddenly decided not to.\nI am asking this because the new 38 version has some cool new features that I acutally waited for quiet some time now.\n\nA: This answer focusses on the conceptual question: Why has Canonical made this decision?\nIt doesn’t suggest workarounds for the decisions Canonical has made. Those have already been given in another answer.\n\nThere are generally two ways for a downstream distributor (like Canonical) to deal with upstream releases.\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply pass the new release on to the consumer.\n\n*Pass on only security fixes to the consumer.\n\n\nFor most packages, the second option is preferred. That keeps things stable. If Ubuntu passed on the latest PHP to me, my PHP scripts might suddenly stop working, because the syntax is slightly different in the latest version. On the other hand, if they passed on nothing at all, I might be vulnerable to attacks. So they pass on the security fixes only. That’s why my PHP version is PHP 5.6.4-4ubuntu6.2: it has the syntax of PHP 5.6.4, but also has some Ubuntu-specific tweaks when they’ve taken security fixes from later versions of PHP and put them into this version. This is known as backporting, and is the usual method. I’ll get a new version of PHP only when I update to a new version of Ubuntu.\nThat makes sense for a scripting language like PHP. You can see why I’d want stability. The latest version has slightly different syntax which might break existing scripts. For a desktop program like Thunderbird, however, there’s more debate about which method is preferable.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some people prefer stability. The new version of Thunderbird might have a different user interface, which they don’t want to have to learn.\n\n*On the other hand, some people want those new features, and don’t see why they should have to wait for a new version of Ubuntu before they get a new version of Thunderbird.\n\n\nIt’s a balancing act. Consider also this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backporting security fixes is a lot of work for the Ubuntu team: it’s probably easier for them just to pass on the entire update.\n\n\nFor Firefox, Ubuntu does pass on the latest releases. The decision on whether to do this or to backport security fixes only is made on a case-by-case basis.\nAnother thing to consider is this: Different people want different things. Some people want stability and security fixes only, no changes in behaviour. Others want the latest and greatest new features. If Ubuntu’s repos work for the former crowd, the latter can always go directly to the source and get the latest stuff from there. However, if Ubuntu’s repos cater to the latter crowd, the former have nowhere to go, and are likely to end up just running old software with no updates, not even security updates. As such, it makes sense for Ubuntu to provide stability and backported security fixes for most packages.\n\nA: The main repo won't likely be updated unless it needs to be for security fixes.\nThe only reason it's seemed that Canonical always updates to the latest, is that Mozilla has released security fixes in newer versions and it was deemed worth any potential trouble they might have with a brand new version to get those fixes.  If there are major changes made in later versions but security fixes can be applied to the existing version, that's what you're going to get.\n", "Q: 12.04 HWES OEM won't upgrade, new HP455 laptop Can some one please help, I have a new laptop a HP455 from ebuyer and its throwing up the following complains when trying to install the security and hardware support package in update manager: \ninstallArchives() failed: \nExtract templates from packages: 48%%\nExtract templates from packages: 96%%\nExtract templates from packages: 100%%\n\nExtract templates from packages: 48%%\nExtract templates from packages: 96%%\nExtract templates from packages: 100%%\n\nExtract templates from packages: 48%%\nExtract templates from packages: 96%%\nExtract templates from packages: 100%%\n\nExtract templates from packages: 48%%\nExtract templates from packages: 96%%\nExtract templates from packages: 100%%\n(Reading database ... \n(Reading database ... 5%%\n(Reading database ... 10%%\n(Reading database ... 15%%\n(Reading database ... 20%%\n(Reading database ... 25%%\n(Reading database ... 30%%\n(Reading database ... 35%%\n(Reading database ... 40%%\n(Reading database ... 45%%\n(Reading database ... 50%%\n(Reading database ... 55%%\n(Reading database ... 60%%\n(Reading database ... 65%%\n(Reading database ... 70%%\n(Reading database ... 75%%\n(Reading database ... 80%%\n(Reading database ... 85%%\n(Reading database ... 90%%\n(Reading database ... 95%%\n(Reading database ... 100%%\n(Reading database ... 185836 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking fglrx-core (from .../fglrx-core_1%%3a14.201-0ubuntu2wataugafour2_amd64.deb) ...\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/fglrx-core_1%%3a14.201-0ubuntu2wataugafour2_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n trying to overwrite '/etc/acpi/fglrx-powermode.sh', which is also in package fglrx 2:14.201-0ubuntu1\nNo apport report written because MaxReports is reached already\ndpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/fglrx-core_1%%3a14.201-0ubuntu2wataugafour2_amd64.deb\nError in function: \nSystemError: E:Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI am at a bit of a loss with this and wondering if someone could point me in the right direction.\n\nA: I have since solved this problem. \nIf you look in the proprietary drivers list, you will see a driver that is enabled that prevents loading of invalid fglrx drivers.\nIf you deactivate this, then reboot, the Security and Hardware support package will install.\n", "Q: KLatexFormula fails to show any formula I have freshly installed KLatexFormula under a 14.04 LTS ubuntu.

(Required by a game) I've recently bough GTA5 for the computer, but through Game-stop. They gave me a code, and I got the install EXE file. I thought I could simply run it through steam, and I'd be done. However, when I try to install, it says: Unable to detect the Windows Media Feature Pack on your system. Please install the Windows Media feature Pack, then retry the installation. I can't find any way to install it! I think I've got the MSU file, but that can't be run with PlayOnLinux (Which is what I'm also using to run Steam, so It can run windows games) Please help! If necessary I can steal the pack from my old Windows XP computer, but that would be awful. Is there any way to install it?\n\n\nA: The minimum requirements on the games website are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Minimum OS: Windows 8.1 64 Bit, Windows 8 64 Bit, Windows 7 64 Bit Service Pack 1, Windows Vista 64 Bit Service Pack 2. \n\n*DirectX 10\n\n\nI remember that there was such a package for Windows Media Player 10 (the last version for XP) which basically added playback functionality for newer formats, but I'm not sure if that will solve your problem. You are probably just misguided by the installers requirement for this platform and how the target OS or Wine interprets it to satisfy this dependency (play video similar H.264 with Windows Media, I assume).\nSince you trick the installer with Wine, make sure that your Wine configuration is set to correctly mimic at least Windows Vista and try to install Windows Media Player 11. WMP10 is the latest version PlayOnLinux and Winetricks seem to support and WMP12 is available since Windows 7, but might be even trickier to install than WMP11.\nThis is the mess you get, when you don't use the actual target platform but another implementation that tries to mimic it with best effort. A solution to this problem would be implement the functionality that results in this dependency by using another software component like gstreamer (and probably replace the DirectX 10 dependency), that would make it more interoperable or even a good Linux port. However that was not the intention of the game designers or staff responsible for the \"PC port\". The intention obviously was to provide the best experience and performance on Windows without researching what the best cross-platform solution to video playback is, and I can't blame them.\n\nA: Wine cannot install Windows Media Feature Pack currently, as it does not support installing .msu files yet. This is the workaround that I was able to find:\nGet the mfplat.dll, msmpeg2adec.dll, msmpeg2vdec.dll packages from C:~/Windows/system32 and put them into wine's Windows/system32 (get 32 or 64 bit dlls according to your wine settings).

I heard Xfce is much faster and less memory-consuming than Unity.

I decided to delete Windows partition because things weren't working right on Windows, but now I want to install them again. I now have 230 gigabytes of unallocated space reserved for windows, next to my Linux partitions. When I tried to custom install Windows 8.1. on my 230 gb of unallocated space the message showed: Windows cannot be installed on this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only installed on GPT disks. \nMy question is if there is a way to convert my unallocated space (from MBR to GPT) I want to install Win 8.1 on, without losing Linux, and normally boot both OS as I used to. \nI was also wondering if converting during installation of Win 8.1 using Diskpart will delete my Linux OS ? \nI don't know why I have this problem now, when I first did dual boot with Linux and Win i had no problems at all. \n\nA: The whole disk uses either the GUID Partition Table (GPT) or the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system; you can't convert just one partition from GPT to MBR or vice-versa. That said, there is something called a hybrid MBR, in which an MBR is laid atop a GPT; but this is an ugly and dangerous hack that would be useless for your specific situation anyhow, so don't even think about it. (I only mention it so you won't try to use it if you read about it elsewhere.)\nIt's not clear from your post what you understand of BIOS-mode vs. EFI-mode booting. BIOS-mode is the old style of booting that's been used since the 1980s. EFI-mode booting is relatively new; it's only become common since about 2011, or a bit earlier on Macs. To boot in EFI mode, your firmware must be an EFI (or its newer variant, UEFI). Most EFIs also support BIOS-mode booting via a Compatibility Support Module (CSM), aka legacy-mode booting.\nWindows ties its boot mode to the partition table type; you can only install or boot Windows in BIOS mode on an MBR disk; and in EFI mode on a GPT disk. Linux is much more flexible about this, although most distributions enforce an EFI/GPT marriage in their installers. The mode of any given boot depends on a complex interaction of factors, including firmware settings, disk layout, and user choices. On most UEFI-based PCs, EFI-mode booting is the default; BIOS-mode booting is possible only if it's enabled in the firmware setup utility. Enabling this feature greatly complicates the boot process. Given your symptoms, it's virtually certain that this feature is active on your computer.\nIn any event, the error message you're seeing indicates that you've booted the Windows installer in EFI mode, but your disk uses MBR. With an EFI/MBR setup, the Windows installer will refuse to proceed. If you've got a PC (not a Mac), you have two main choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Getting the Windows installer to boot in BIOS mode makes sense. You may be able to do this by using your computer's boot manager to force a BIOS-mode boot. The boot manager is usually accessed by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key as you power on the system. When you enter the boot manager, with any luck you'll see two entries for booting the Windows installer, one of which includes the string \"UEFI\" and the other of which doesn't. Select the entry without the \"UEFI\" string. This procedure isn't 100% reliable, but it usually works.\n\n*You can convert the disk to GPT using gdisk, as oldfred suggested in his comment; however, you'll need to re-install your Ubuntu boot loader. If you install Windows in EFI mode (which would be the point of this conversion), you'll do well to install an EFI boot loader for Linux, too. (Booting Windows in EFI mode and Ubuntu in BIOS mode is possible but is highly inadvisable.) Several are available, as described on my Web page on this subject. Probably installing the EFI version of GRUB via Boot Repair or my rEFInd will be easiest to manage.\n\n\nIt's hard to say which approach is better. If Windows was pre-installed, it probably booted in EFI mode and used GPT to begin with, which means you've changed things considerably since you got the computer. The extent and reason for these changes is unclear, which makes it hard to give concrete advice. If you installed Windows yourself, there's no telling how it was initially set up. Without your complete partition table information, it's impossible to say if you might run into partitioning issues with either approach.\nOne further possible complication is that Windows sees a hybrid MBR as an MBR, but Linux sees such a disk as using GPT. Macs often use hybrid MBR setups to enable OS X and Windows to coexist. If this is what you've got, then neither of my preceding suggestions is 100% in order; removing the hybrid MBR in favor of a regular GPT is likely to be best. Post the output of sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda if you've got a Mac and you want to know if this might be what's going on.\nOh, and using DiskPart in Windows to convert from GPT to MBR will trash your Ubuntu installation. In fact, I trust the Windows partitioning tools about as far as I can throw my house, so I wouldn't use them except as a last resort, and perhaps to shrink existing Windows partitions.\n\nA: I have a thought, which I have never tried. in windows disk management, you can create a virtual hard disk, then convert it to GPT disk. This GPT disk will shows in disk management as another hard drive. My idea is to install windows to the VHD, but I am not sure it will work.\n", "Q: Networking is disabled and I can't re-enable it For some reason I seem to get disconnected from my wifi as noted by the nm-applet going to the disconnected icon.

I'd like to scroll through previous commands or scroll through a text editor with the scroll wheel. I don't know how to do this without starting a full-blown X Window System.\n\nA: This is not straightforward.\nIt is however possible using a bit of programming to make a command line filter to prove the concept. For instance in Python (see below).\nThis filter would take the standard input (i.e. your keyboard) and pass it on to standard output. It must also capture mouse data and when it sees scroll wheel data add arrow up or down to standard out.\nYou can capture mouse output on /dev/input/mouse (or mouse0 or mouse1)\nYou then start it as:\nsudo ./filter.py | bash\n\nA crude, working concept is here:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport fcntl\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# make stream a non-blocking file\nf = open('/dev/input/mouse0')\nfd = f.fileno()\nfl = fcntl.fcntl(fd, fcntl.F_GETFL)\nfcntl.fcntl(fd, fcntl.F_SETFL, fl | os.O_NONBLOCK)\n\nwhile (True):\n    key = sys.stdin.read(1)\n    sys.stdout.write(key)\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    try:\n        mouse = f.read(1)\n        sys.stdout.write('date\\n')\n        sys.stdout.flush()\n    except:\n        continue\n\nIt will execute all commands you enter (no prompt though) and when you move the mouse, and then hit enter it will execute the 'date' command.\n", "Q: can I change uname? I want to install Discovery Studio Visualizer but the precompiled binary checks the system for OS version. When it finds that I am not running RHEL, the installer exits.\nIs there a way to change or trick programs that call uname into displaying different info? \n\nA: You cannot customize uname's output, but you can spoof the installer by making the system run a custom script instead of the \"real\" /bin/uname.\nFirst you'll need to check the exact command the installer is running to check your system's information; in this example for the sake of easiness I'll pretend that an executable ~/tmp/check is running uname -n and that the output of uname -n should be ubuntu in order for ~/tmp/check to print \"Passed!\".\n~/tmp/check's source (this of course is not relevant, and is just to showcase what the test executable does):\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define MAX_STRING_LENGTH 32\n\nint main(void) {\n    FILE* output = popen(\"/bin/uname -n\", \"r\");\n    char expected[] = \"ubuntu\";\n    char hostname[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];\n    fgets(hostname, MAX_STRING_LENGTH, output);\n    pclose(output);\n    if(hostname[strlen(hostname) - 1] == '\\n')\n        hostname[strlen(hostname) - 1] = '\\0';\n    if(strcmp(expected, hostname) == 0) {\n        printf(\"Passed!\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ uname -n\ndebian\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ ./check\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ \n\nIt's easy to track the exact command run by the executable using strace:\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ strace -f ./check 2>&1 > /dev/null | grep execve\nexecve(\"./check\", [\"./check\"], [/* 34 vars */]) = 0\n[pid 13122] execve(\"/bin/sh\", [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"/bin/uname -n\"], [/* 34 vars */] <unfinished ...>\n[pid 13122] <... execve resumed> )      = 0\n[pid 13123] execve(\"/bin/uname\", [\"/bin/uname\", \"-n\"], [/* 34 vars */]) = 0\n\nSo to get around this one should make uname -n output ubuntu: the easiest solution would be to just move /bin/uname and to create a symbolic link /bin/uname linking to a custom script (which will ignore any argument and just output ubuntu):\ncat ~/tmp/spoofer.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\necho ubuntu\nexit 0\n\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ sudo mv /bin/uname /bin/uname1\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ sudo ln -s ~/tmp/spoofer.sh /bin/uname\n\nLet's see if that worked:\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ uname -n\nubuntu\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ ./check\nPassed!\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ \n\nBingo!

I ran aptitude from the terminal, and it said that I have 69,000 uninstalled packages. Can they safely be deleted without affecting system stability or functionality?\n\nA: If they're 'uninstalled', they're not present on your system, so don't need to be deleted.\nThis number is just the count of packages available in the repositories, but not present on your system.\n\nA: No doubt those packages wasn't installed in your system to be uninstalled and deleted!!!\nThis number in deed is number of packages available in your added repositories.\nBut you should know a concept when installing a package first it will download its .deb to /var/cache/apt/archives and then install this package. So indeed when you install a package its .deb binary is still available in the above directory. This directory could be cleaned using commands:\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nor\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nAlso another important concept sometimes you install some package which needs some other dependencies. So to install this package you need to install that dependencies. Now suppose you remove this package, then its dependencies is not used anymore and you can delete them using command:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\nA: I am using Ubuntu 14.04. From time to time when I run \napt-get update\n\nI see a message about unused packages and a suggestion to use\napt-get autoremove\n\nWhich then cleans up the packages that are not needed. If there is really something that needs to be removed, the OS will probably let you know when you apply patches.\n", "Q: Best alternative for WinMerge I need to compare/diff/merge files in an easy way.

My goal is to create a test lab in which I can test the configuration of my physical router for my home network, before moving it into production.  Of course the configuration on the physical network will differ a bit, but much of it can be tested in the lab environment first.\nI watched a series of videos on creating a bridge in Debian for your KVM VMs.  From these I was able to obtain an internet connection for my OpenWRT Barrier Breaker VM via it's WAN card.  \nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet manual\n\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\n   address 192.168.1.85\n   network 192.168.1.0\n   netmask 255.255.255.0\n   broadcast 192.168.0.255\n   gateway 192.168.1.1\n   bridge_ports eth1\n   bridge_stp off\n   bridge_fd 0\n   bridge_maxwait 0\n   dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1\n\niface br0 inet6 static\naddress fe80:21f:5bff:fe3b:73b1\nnetmask64\n    pre-up echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/br0/autoconf\n    post-down echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/br0/autoconf\n\n/etc/network - Host Interface Configuration\nFrom this I ended up with the following configuration in Virtual Machine Manager:\n\nHost Interface configuration in Virtual Machine Manager\nI also configured the OpenWRT VM wan interface with the following configuration:\nconfig `switch` `eth0`\n  option `enable` `1`\n\nconfig `switch_vlan` `eth1`\n   option `vlan` `0`\n   option `device` `eth1`\n   option `ports` `4 5` #wan\n\nconfig `switch_vlan` `eth0_1`\n   option `vlan` `1`\n   option `device` `eth0`\n   option `ports` `0` #lan 1\n\nconfig `interface` `lan`\n   option `ifname` `eth0.1`\n   option `proto` `static`\n   option `ipaddr` `192.168.100.1`\n   option `netmask` `255.255.255.0`\n   option `defaultroute` `0`\n   option `peerdns` `0`\n   option `nat` `1`\n\nconfig `interface` `loopback`\n   option ifname `log`\n   option proto `static`\n   option ipaddr `127.0.0.1`\n   option netmask `255.0.0.0`\n\nconfig interface `wan`\n   option ifname `eth1`\n   option type `bridge`\n   option proto `static`\n   option ipaddr `192.168.1.85`\n   option gateway `192.168.1.1`\n   option netmask `255.255.255.0`\n   option dns `192.168.1.1`\n\n/etc/config/network - OpenWRT VM network configuration\nThanks to this, I am now able to use opkg to download any packages I might need for the OpenWRT VM.  \n\nHowever, I'm only half way there; I'd like to place some client VMs on series of private networks behind the OpenWRT VM.  I did my best to setup the LAN ports, but I don't know how to connect the virtual interfaces of the OpenWRT VM and the client machines.  \n\nI also setup a virtual network using Virtual Machine Manager:\n\nThe Isolated Virtual Network, intnet,  configuration in Virtual Machine Manager\nI thought that on the OpenWRT VM if I connected an interface other than the WAN interface on to the inet network:\n\nOpenWRT VM LAN interface configured to connect to the inet virtual network\n....and that if I also connected the client's single network interface to the inet network, (and of course configured them both inside the VM) that would be able to simulate the conditions of my physical network.\n\nClient machine interface configured to connect to the inet virtual network\nI'm not really certain on how to proceed, the libvirt documentation confuses me because I don't quite understand the virtual switch;  It seems to me that if the virtual switch on the isolated inet network has both the gateway and the client machine plugged into it, it should at the very least allow the OpenWRT VM and the client machine to ping each other, but this is not the case.  \nI'd like to verify that I have the libvert plumbing correct first, and the move on to fine tuning the configuration of the lan interfaces on the inet isolated virtual network on both vms.\n\nA: You need two host bridges. \n\n\n*\n\n*br0 connects to the internet, and \n\n*br1 is a dummy bridge where all of the openwrt clients connect.\nThe complete instructions for a dhcp wan interface are here: http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/qemu/qemu\nI've not yet figured out how to use one static address where the host connects to the br1 bridge and gives openwrt full control of br0...that's another question.\n\nA: Just made the same setup myself and have been trying to solve the problem for four days. Finally I found a solution that worked. I have also posted the same here on \nTurned out I overthinked the whole solution. Only one interface is needed. I assigned the physical interface of the host to the VM's as well. So instead of creating one bridge for the internal network of the VM's i just used the same interface for everything. All Virtual and physical machines now share the same LAN connected to the OpenWRT assigning IP's and serving as a DNS-forwarder.\n", "Q: How can I stop another working webserver?

I got Ubuntu 14.04 installed, but I need to use apt-get to install some packages, and apt-get will not work.\nThe problem is that apt-get cannot connect to ubuntu.com.  I see the error\n Could not resolve 'us.archive.ubuntu.com'\n\nI tried to ping google.com and 8.8.8.8, and they cannot be reached either.  I edited my /etc/resolv.conf file to include nameserver 8.8.8.8 and I still couldn't get out.\nI figured it must be the wifi connection, which is weird because I configured the wifi during installation and it was working fine.  I have been spending the past several hours trying to get\nwpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -Dwext -c<(wpa_passphrase <my SSID> <my password>)\n\n(which I am most definitely running as a superuser) to work.  It doesn't.  It immediately spits out the following\nSuccessfully initialized wpa_supplicant\nioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Invalid argument\nioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Invalid argument\nioctl[SIOCSIWSCAN]: Device or resource busy\n\nafter which it enters an infinite loop of trying to connect and failing.\nIt is possible that the device is busy because I had earlier put in a wpa_supplicant command with the -B option, which put it in the background, and I can't figure out how to kill the background process.  But before that, I was having a similar problem: I just can't connect to the internet.\nSince I can't connect to the internet, I have no access to apt-get so if it isn't in the standard Ubuntu 14.04 server distro, then I don't have it.\nI was able, once, the first time, to get a ping google.com to return something, but it quickly went away and I haven't been able to duplicate anything.\nWhat do I do here?  Am I missing something really simple\n(I did check that wlan0 is turned on, and I did scan for my SSID and it does show up in a scan.  I just can't connect to it.  I have double checked the password I'm using: it is the one written on the box, and it works on every other machine in the house)\nEDIT: I removed D wext from the wpa_supplicant request.  That is, I entered\nwpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c<(wpa_passphrase  ) \nThis doesn't let to connect to the internet still, but it removes the complaints about invalid arguments.\nEDIT:  I got it to work.  My routine is (from root)\n>ifconfig wlan0 up\n>iwlist scan|less\n>wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c<(wpa_passphrase <SSID> <password>)\n\nIf that connects, then I type it again but with -B to run it in background, then\n>dhclient -r\n>dhclient wlan0\n>ping google.com\n\nIt should start returning data from google.  If not, I kill the background process with\n>kill `pidof wpa_supplicant`\n\nThis works for me.\n\nA: It should not be necessary to invoke wpa_supplicant directly OR to edit /etc/resolv.conf manually. For example, for a minimal DHCP setup you can use a /etc/network/interfaces file stanza like\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\n    wpa-ssid MyNetwork\n    wpa-psk \"Long p@ssphrase, with spaces\\!\"\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8  8.8.4.4\n\nNotice that this stanza includes the DNS server specification: if you have messed with /etc/resolv.conf you may need to reconfigure the resolvconf package to get things back to normal\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nIt will present you with a question about preparing /etc/resolv.conf for dynamic updates - answer \"Yes\". It may also present you with another question about temporarily appending your existing config to the dynamic one - if so you should probably answer \"No\" to that one.

I would be thankful to any body who can give me clarity.\nJust some info before my question\n\n\n*\n\n*I know ubuntu comes with server as well as with desktop versions \n\n*I installed the ubuntu desktop version 15.04 version \n\n*While, I was going through few youtube videos on ubuntu, I came across people referring other desktops on ubuntu like cinnamon , lxde , unity , etc  \n\n\nMy questions\n\n\n*\n\n*So my confusion started from here, Are they referring to an interface as a desktop ?\n\n*Ubuntu /linux though they are operating system by themself.Do they still have the ability to have different desktops on top of them?\n\n*Is it something like a skin, i can choose different versions?\n\n*what command should i use to find what desktop i have on top of my ubuntu? \n\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes\n\n*Yes\n\n*Not like a skin, but yes you can choose different versions\n\n*Not sure, but by default Ubuntu 15.04 comes with Unity, I believe.\n\n\nA: Couple of things I wanted to address:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu desktop and server versions are pretty much the same. The difference is that server comes with additional software for \"serious\" tasks and no graphic interface - only command line. \n\n*All *nix systems in general started out as command-line. There was no GUI back when Unix was created by Ken Thompson in 1969. Any graphic interface on *nix systems relies on a graphical server. Think of it as a software layer - you can have that software or not, the system still works without it and can perform necessary tasks. Now, back when *nix systems started getting graphics, computers weren't that powerful, so you would have to login in console, and then type startx to get that graphical layer started (namely, you would start the X server. There's other graphical servers nowadays). That in turn would start your window manager - the program that controls how your windows will look and feel. Now, if on one computer (even on the same computer but for different users) we have unity and on another openbox as default manager - we're gonna get different look and different behavior of the GUI programs. But they still are started with X graphical server, and still running on Ubuntu. In a sense they are like a skin, but a skin that comes with varying features and ability to customize. For instance, motif window manager cannot be tweaked that much (at least I have not heard of it ), but cinnamon can be - there's tons of skins, you can place the panel on any four sides of the window, etc.\n\n*Nowadays there's another way things work - you have instance of X server running to show you the login screen (aka the greeter or desktop manager ). Desktop manager does the same job as startx. Only instead of two steps (login and run startx ) you just do one step in this case. \n\n*I've looked through this  and IMHO the only method that works across the board with wmctrl -m. It worked in both openbox and gnome sessions, which I have open right now on tty1 and tty7. You can also try to trace the output of pstree to find out what session you have running, but that will be a bit confusing if you have multiple sessions open like I do. I have openbox started with startx so it's the parent process of that, but for gnome parent process is lightdm greeter.\n", "Q: Customize ISO - SQFS -- Add Custom BashRC - Alias to Ubuntu Live DVD iso I would like to customize my Ubuntu Live iso and add an command alias that I use each time I load disk. This way I don't have to open my logs for the command(s) I use each time, mainly to start a vnc server.\nalias vnc='chmod a+x /root/.xinitrc && vncserver :60'\n\n\nA: Basically, it would be like following through https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization to customize that ISO file.  Mainly, you would be extracting the filesystem.squashfs and modifying it.  The home folder within the filesystem.squashfs is /etc/skel/, that is where you would put your .bashrc, etc. files.  The filesystem.squashfs would then have to be resquashed and then added to the custom ISO.\nThe /etc/skel/ folder is the default home folder for the Ubuntu Live CD/DVD/USB in the filesystem.squashfs.  I am not sure what OS the Parted Magic is using.  It could be different.\nHope this helps and points you in the right direction.\n\nA: To remaster an ISO do the following:\n*Also all commands are performed as root\nCopy the ISO to the tmp directory:\nmkdir /tmp/cdrom\nmkdir /tmp/iso\nmount -o loop Linux.iso /tmp/cdrom\ncp -a /tmp/cdrom /tmp/iso\numount /tmp/cdrom\n\ncd into /tmp/iso and copy .*sqfs or *.squashfs to /tmp \nunsquashfs /tmp/*.sqfs \ncd /tmp/squashfs-root/\n\nMake Changes now Then...\nmksquashfs /tmp/squashfs-root *.SQFS\n\nSo far the Only way I have managed to remaster the ISO is either if the ISO has a makeiso.script or by using ISOMaster to open the original ISO remove the old sqfs and then insert new one and remaster ISO. \n\nA: You can mount the iso, edit it, and then save it.  Then remount it to make sure your edits were retained, and if so, burn and test!  If all goes well, you've done it!\nAnd just put the .bashrc in the home directory where the original was.\n", "Q: How do you get FakeVim in the Ubuntu SDK to use ~/.vim/plugin/colemak.vim? I have a custom layout for vim, that remaps the keys to fit my colemak keyboard layout.\nIn the ubuntu SDK, fakevim does not use the custom layout defined in ~/.vim/colemak.vim.\nHow can get fakevim to use the layout defined in colemak.vim?\n\nA: Fakevim will not detect plugins that you define for vim, rather you have to place the configuration directly into .vimrc\n", "Q: Single Click Expose Is it possible to have single click on the dock icons activate expose by default?\nIf you have a single window open in ubuntu it doesn't activate expose but if you have multiple windows open it does.  This cause issues when I tried to use expose on several different windows in ubuntu.\n\n\nA: Contents:\n\n*\n\n*Overview\n\n*Script source\n\n*Additional notes\n\n1. Overview\nAs mentioned in the comments, this functionality apparently got removed since 12.04 and now click on the launcher icon minimizes the window (which apparently was a highly-requested feature, from what I can see in my online searches). However, there exists a keyboard to turn on expo for a single window, which is Super+Ctrl+W. Knowing that, if we can detect click on the launcher or position of the cursor when window is raised , then we can simulate that single window expo via that keyboard shortcut. The script below does exactly that.\nThis is meant to be saved as /usr/bin/single_click_expo.py file and added to Startup Applications\n\n2.

Additional notes\n\n*\n\n*It might be advisable to remap the shortcut to something other Super+Ctrl+W , because in expo Ctrl+W in Expo corresponds to \"close window\" command. Potential issue here is that frequent switching may cause window closing. The script would have to be adjusted as well accordingly.\n\nNOTE:\nThe script relies on xdotool utility. You must have it installed. Without xdotool it won't work, since xdotool is used to simulate keypresses. Install it via sudo apt-get install xdotool\n", "Q: Installing megatools Package on 14.04 https://github.com/megous/megatools\nBuild instructions state:\nOn Debian, Ubuntu:\n\n  apt-get -y install build-essential libglib2.0-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgirepository1.0-dev\n\nHowever when attempting to install on 14.04 lts I get the error:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libglib2.0-dev : Depends: libglib2.0-0 (= 2.40.2-0ubuntu1) but 2.44.1-1.1 is to be installed\n                  Depends: libglib2.0-bin (= 2.40.2-0ubuntu1)\n                  Depends: libpcre3-dev (>= 1:8.31) but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nWhen trying to build it without, I receive an error that the glib version is to low:\nconfigure: error: Glib 2.32.0 or later is required to build megatools\nIs there any way to fix it?\nThanks\nAs requested:\nlibglib2.0-dev:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 2.40.2-0ubuntu1\n  Version table:\n     2.40.2-0ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://mirrors.digitalocean.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates/main amd64 Packages\n     2.40.0-2 0\n        500 http://mirrors.digitalocean.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: The package libglib2.0-dev (2.40.0-2) in the standard Ubuntu repositories depends on libglib2.0-0 (= 2.40.0-2).

My system has Ubuntu Server 12.04 installed in text-mode (no X-Window) and a command prompt that is defined in my ~/.bashrc file by following line:\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w \\[\\033[01;35m\\] \\[$(date \"+%a %F %T %Z\")\\] \\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '  \n\nIt looks like:\nusername@hostname:~  Wed Jul 2015-07-22 18:00:12 JST $ \n\nIf I press  ↑  previous command in my history is displayed in front of above promp, e.g.:\nusername@hostname:~  Wed Jul 2015-07-22 18:00:12 JST $ vim /home/username/~/.bshrc\n\nIf I press  ↑  second time, the previous command in the the history is displayed, but it is over written on some part of my prompt, i.e.:\nusername@hostname:~  Wedsudo su\n\nNote that Jul 2015-07-22 18:00:12 JST $ is over written!\n\n\n*\n\n*Also, it is not always over written by second command in the history. Some time first, second, third previous commands are displayed properly in front of complete prompt, one after another, and suddenly forth previous command is over written on last part of command prompt!\n\n*Always, the last part of command prompt is over written after day of week, i.e. Wed and this position is fixed if I press ↑ or ↓.\n\n*If I run the command or press Ctrl+C, the command prompt is displayed completely again.\nAny one can help to solve this problem?\n\nA: That fails because you enclosed $(date ...) within \\[ and \\]. Remove those and it should work as expected.\n\\[ ... \\], in the prompt, is used to tell bash that the characters within will not add to the length of the prompt. You need this around terminal escapes like \\033[01;32m because this only makes the following text a different colour, but those 8 bytes will not add to the length of the prompt; they are instead eaten by the terminal.\nOn a side note; bash can already put the date in the prompt for you, without having to run the date command.\nPS1='... \\D{%a %F %T %Z} ...'\n\nSee http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Controlling-the-Prompt\n", "Q: no reply from server  wget http://10.254.5.225:8080/debs/amd64/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\n--2015-07-22 12:59:56--  http://10.254.5.225:8080/debs/amd64/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\nConnecting to 10.254.5.225:8080... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response...\n\nOn 10.254.5.225 IPtables are off and apache2 service is running\nand the debs folder is exported.

If you want to have that file available, you would put your debs/amd64 folders in there.  \nIt would look like this on the hard drive:\n/var/www/html/debs/amd64/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\n\nor, you could put a link there as well, by typing in\nln -s /var/www/html/debs /path/to/debs/\n\nalso, make sure that the file(s) have at least Read attributes on the files so that they can be read and downloaded\nsudo chmod -R +r /path/to/debs/\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on Windows 7 tablet I'm trying to install Ubuntu on a Windows 7 tablet (HP Slate 500). I wanted to install Ubuntu touch, but can't seem to find an .iso anywhere. The guide here: https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/start/ubuntu-for-devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices/ does not help as it is not an Android tablet. \nI was going to use Unetbootin and put it on a USB and install it from there. However, I'm afraid if I download the desktop version, I won't be able to type anything in the tablet.\nI'm doing this for educational purposes. The tablet is really old and doesn't have anything important in it. Any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: There is no Ubuntu touch for this device (that I could find).\nYou should look at xubuntu as your CPU is weak, it comes with an on-screen keyboard, find it in Applications > Universal Access > Onboard Settings, so no worries there, on the log in screen you will see the accessibility icon ( a little man symbol) and can start the keyboard from there.\nAlso any usb keyboard will work too.\nIf your tablet is old and not important, whats wrong with just trying some distros ? If something won't work, try a different one.\nUPDATE: This may be of interest to any x86 tablet users.\nThere is actually a early daily build of Ubuntu Touch 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) on ubuntu.com, can't say how well it works, it is a daily.\nLooking at the tablet in this question, it should meet the requierments for running Touch. \n", "Q: Problem with software-center in 14.04 I installed Ubuntu trusty 14.04 on my laptop along side windows dual boot.\ni have a problem with software center. i am unable to install any tool using this and also no updates were taking place. So i removed this software center and tried to re install it. \ni used these codes\nsudo apt-get remove software-center\nthen it removed. while i am trying to reinstall it using\nsudo apt-get install software-center\nit is showing \nE: Package 'software-center' has no installation candidate\nplease help me.I need to install meep on this.\n\nA: First use sudo apt-get update command before using sudo apt-get install software-center. If it still shows the same error, try to enable the main component of Ubuntu official repository. Get help from this similar question How do I enable the \"Universe\" repository? \nThough the main part should always be enabled. \n", "Q: register DNS for connecting to my computer I am using a PC at university and I need to set up a DNS name for it under the network of university such as:\nmy-pc.dm.myuniversity.edu\n\nfor accessing this computer via my laptop from home (through remote connection).\nThough, there are a lot of questions about setting up DNS with specific IPs, I can't find any method for setting a DNS for connecting to the current computer.\nUpdate\nMy question is just about setting a DNS for the network to connect this computer via name rather than IP. Windows has such option in a very convenient way. And IT technicians as usual never assist with Linux users.\nUpdate\nMy laptop at home has windows on it and my pc at university has Ubuntu Linux. At home i connect to university VPN and then I use team-viewer. Instead of using team-viewer ID, I want to use DNS name.\n\nA: You PC should already have a name. You can find out which one that is by executing command:\nhostname\n\nThe ip address tied to that name is found via:\nnslookup `hostname`\n\nor alternatively:\nifconfig\n\nBut now back to your original question ;-) \nYou will only be able to access your computer at university remotely, if the university has set up remote access for their local network. You will have to talk to the IT department to find out how to access your computer remotely and what VNC or RDP software you have to install.\nThis can be set up in different ways, so there is no standard answer.\n\nA: well for this you need to do is port forwarding. If you want to access all files of computer than you need to forward port 22 which is for ssh connection and you also need to install ssh-server to that computer using\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nafter installing you need to access router of your university where Internet connection is coming and than you need to port forward 22 with static ip address of your University local pc.\nafter that you can access your University pc from anywhere. But know this that it will be open to access to anyone so take necessary steps for security of your university system.\nto get remote access you can take ssh connection like this\nssh pc-username@domailname\n\n", "Q: drive mounting problem I am new in ubuntu, I installed ubuntu with windows 7.

Our small organization receives a lot of fake emails with .doc attachments containing VBA viral macros. Is there a risk to run these macros on LibreOffice / Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes. However, the probability is lower. It's quite likely an exploit for MS Office won't affect LibreOffice and most .doc viruses will be for Office, but if an attacker knew what you're using, it's quite possible.\nAs an example, see this link.\nIf you want complete security, run a VM on your machine and open files there.

The instructions for updating Pepper Flash Player to the latest version are in this answer.\nUpdate\nThese instructions will install Pepper flash player for Chromium and it will also be updated automatically. In addition to installing flash player for Chromium, it will also install/reinstall Adobe flash player for Firefox, and it will also be updated automatically. Because Google ended support for Chrome on 32-bit Linux in March, 2016, Pepper flash player can only be installed for 64-bit versions of Chromium.\nTo install flash player in Chromium web browser search the Dash for Software & Updates and open the Software & Updates window.

Burning it to a CD worked and booted correctly, but now I want to use a USB stick instead (because I don't trust my CD drive), how to create this USB stick using Ubuntu?\nThere are many tutorials explaining how to create bootable USB sticks from Linux-based ISOs (using UNetbootin and similar, they create Linux-related files at the root of the USB stick) and from Windows-based utilities (with FreeDOS and similar). I believe neither are solutions here as the BIOS update ISO file is not Linux-based nor DOS-based (mounting the ISO does not show any known filesystem)\n\nA: I found what may be a solution to the issue at http://positon.org/lenovo-thinkpad-bios-update-with-linux-and-usb.\nFirst convert the iso image to an img file:\nsudo apt-get install genisoimage\ngeteltorito -o bios.img gruj09us.iso\n\nThen copy to the USB key:\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb  # double check that the device is right\nsudo dd if=bios.img of=/dev/sdb #Will Erase the drive!! \n\nThat said I think you should just try first whether it boots okay if you just write the .iso with a generic tool as you normally would. (Provided it needs some input and does not automatically start mucking about in your BIOS as you boot up.)\n Last two times I installed a Linux I didn't use the recommended tool. (I made a bootable USB for 15.04 with SUSE Studio Image Writer since Unetbootin messed it straight up multiple times.It worked fine.) \n\nA: As Arch user said in the comments, the most straightforward way to write a bootable ISO to an USB drive is to dd the image to the drive.\nFirst triple-check to which block device your USB drive is currently mapped to:\nlsblk\n\nThan dd the image to the USB drive. For example if your USB drive happens to be mapped to /dev/sdb:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/image of=/dev/sdb bs=8M && sync\n\nDifferent block sizes usually peform differently, however usually a bigger block size performs better than a smaller block size; a block size of 8M should be enough to let the process run at full speed.\nIf you want to monitor the progress of the process, install pv:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pv\n\nAnd run this command instead:\npv /path/to/image | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb bs=8M && sync\n\n\nA: Just in case someone is still looking for the answer.\nThe solution above alone was not enough for my Lenovo E470 which is UEFI-capable. The BIOS update utility just does not start from USB stick.\nOne has to read the README file corresponding to BIOS update file.\nOn reboot press Enter to interrupt normal startup and after entering the BIOS Setup:\n\n...\n-> 7. In \"UEFI/Legacy Boot\", make sure \"UEFI only\" is chosen.\n   8. Choose \"Boot\" from the menu. Note the current boot priority order for\n      restoration later if you need to modify your boot list.\n   9. In \"Boot Priority Order\", make sure the following device is on top of\n      \"ATA HDD0\".\n      - \"ATAPI CD0\" (when using a ThinkPad internal optical drive)\n      - \"USB CD\"    (when using a USB optical drive)\n->    - \"USB HDD\"   (for my USB stick)\n\nAfter restart you should be able to boot from you \"USB HDD\".\n", "Q: how many ethernet cards ?

I already read countless of posts. In the posts they recommend to disable secure boot and also fastboot, I already did.\nI created a recovery bootable usb for windows (just in case) and the bootable usb to install ubuntu. When I'm booting the computer I select to boot from the USB  and when I try with the ubuntu bootable usb it doesn't work, nonetheless, if I'm using the recovery usb for windows it works. I'm creating the bootable with Unetbootin, it always works with my other computers, but not with this one apparently. Do you have any idea? Thanks!\n\nA: I've installed UbuntuGNOME 15.04 just recently and v608 of Unetbootin for windows consistently failed to write a bootable image.I solved the problem by using imageusb to burn the iso on to the drive. You should also see the checksum of the .iso that could tell you if it's a corrupted download. \nTo do that in windows if you have 8 or 8.1 is to open powershell cd to the directory and type\nGet-FileHash -Algorithm sha256/md5/etc .\\thefileyouwanttocheck.iso\n\nIt's slow for bigger files it may well take up to a minute or more, so don't close it.Otherwise you'll need to download a tool for checksums.    \n\nA: Fast boot option will be there in BIOS. You have to turn off that feature. Then select USB as boot device. \nTry any of these steps to get in to the BIOS. Either of these might work.\n\n\n*\n\n*To reach the BIOS when fast-boot is turned on, you should hold down the F2 key and then power-on the computer. \n\n\nOR\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on and press escape key for 3 seconds, A BIOS key will be prompt at bottom of your screen. Sometimes it will be F2 key or DEL key.\n\n\nOR\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on and press escape key for 3 seconds. F12 will lead to boot menu. Then select USB as boot device.\n\n\nA: Upgrade to the latest BIOS from Toshiba. Version 5 was released July 2015, disable secure boot, disable fast boot in Windows 10.\nI have the same Toshiba Satellite series, and had the exact same issue, I had to reinstall grub every time I had a hard lockup/freeze. Some reason it doesn't want to save the EFI boot loader properly or it was being corrupted in the hard freeze. Upgrading the BIOS fixed the issue for me.\nAnd these devices have two USB ports, the USB-2.0 port is on the right side of the system when looking directly at the screen. and the USB-3.0 port is on the left side of the device.\nThe easiest way to tell in most cases where a USB port is 2.0 or 3.0 is the color of the plastic inside the port. USB-3.0 is blue (this won't be true in 100% of instances, because some manufacturers ignore standards, but in the instance of this laptop, the left USB port is 3.0).\nA problem I have been having since day one is hard freezes on these devices almost seemingly at random. I narrowed it down to Toshiba improperly reporting its acpi information properly to the Linux kernel, but seems to provide a Microsoft OS with everything it needs. This issue is caused by Linux unable to address/locate the internal cooling fan, and the only work around I have found that seems to reduce the freezes/hard locks, is to use tlp, tlp-stat, lm-sensors, sensor, psensor and thermald to set temperature triggers to throttle CPU clock frequency to keep it from going above 60 deg C. (just a heads up after you solve your boot loader issue)\n", "Q: ZFS root filesystem I've been trying to install ubuntu with a zfs as root filesystem. But it seems that GRUB 2.xx which has ZFS support doesen't support compression, so i disabled it. However i keep running in to the same problem.\nInstalling ubuntu is pretty easy, but booting it seems to be a pain in the neck.\nAfter booting the 15.04 live CD i issued the following in the terminal:\nGet the zfs support packages installed\n# apt-add-repository --yes ppa:zfs-native/stable\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get install debootstrap spl-dkms zfs-dkms ubuntu-zfs\n\nCreate the zfs pools/datasets\n# zpool create -o ashift=12 -m none -R /mnt ospool mirror sdb sdc\n# zpool create -o ashift=12 -m none -R /mnt storage raidz1 sdd sde sdf sdg sdh\n\n# zfs create -o mountpoint=/ ospool/root\n# zfs create -o mountpoint=/boot ospool/boot\n# zfs create -V 8G -b 4k ospool/swap\n# zfs create -o mountpoint=/var storage/var\n# zfs create -o mountpoint=/home storage/home\n\nBootstrap the base system, and chrooting in\n# debootstrap vivid /mnt\n# chroot /mnt /bin/bash --login\n\nI have a boot device (SDA) which has an ext2 and a bios boot partition on Mounted on /mnt/boot/grub\nAt this point i installed the same zfs packages which works just fine.\nBut GRUB fails to install complaining about not being able to find the device og canonical path, so grub2-common and grup-pc never finishes.\nSo my question is how, do i get grub installed with zfs support?\nif i manually install grub with grub-install and reboot into the grub shell, i can see that zfs is supported. But can't reference the kernel with the linux path/to/kernel command.\n\nA: I suggest you try with Ubuntu 16.04. I followed this tutorial and it worked:\nhttps://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Ubuntu-16.04-Root-on-ZFS\nDidn't have to disable any ZFS feature, like compression. In fact, it was enabled (lz4), and I even used raidz1 with 3 disks as /.\nOne caveat is that I had to export this shell var for grub to recognize the disk/by-id devices:\nexport ZPOOL_VDEV_NAME_PATH=YES\n\nThis is because of bug #11527727, which is about to be fixed, so you may not need that anymore in the near future.\n\nA: The ZoL PPA for Vivid does not have the software required to make a ZFS root work like you want.  This configuration is unsupported for all releases after Precise, which is grandfathered.\nAdvanced users can sometimes get the desired result using the basic ZFS support that is already in distro.  In the HOWTO that you are using here, there should be links to alternative tutorials created by the ZoL community.\nA fully integrated Ubuntu solution is probably years away because the upstream GRUB project only recently began giving attention to ZoL issues.  Using a separate boot and root is recommended.\n\nA: You should definitely check out this wiki page on the ZFS on Linux GitHub organization: https://github.com/zfsonlinux/pkg-zfs/wiki/HOWTO-install-Ubuntu-14.04-or-Later-to-a-Native-ZFS-Root-Filesystem\nI have used this in a VM to try this for my next reinstall. It works great!\n\nA: I also tried to setup Ubuntu with ZFS using this tutorial:\nhttps://github.com/zfsonlinux/pkg-zfs/wiki/HOWTO-install-Ubuntu-to-a-Native-ZFS-Root-Filesystem\nI'm done so far and installed Ubuntu 14 using debootstrap and so on. Also Grub has been installed.\nBut booting the system results in the error \"Grub can't find label\" and stucks.\nOn the Grub-Console/BusyBox I've checked if ZFS has mounted and it is!\n$> zpool status\n(fine result!)\n$> mount\n...\nrpool/ROOT/Ubuntu14 on /root type zfs (...)\n(seems fine)...\n$> ls /root/rpool\n(!!! EMPTY !!!\n$> df -P\nrpool/ROOT/Ubuntu14 ..... 0% /root  ??! What's wrong??!\n\nBooting again using DVD/Recovery-Mode and importing ZFS-Rpool everything still is fine and in place!\nMay the LZ4 Compression (enabled on Rpool containing the Ubuntu-OS) be the Problem?!\nBest regards\nGabriel\n", "Q: Is there a better (permanent) per-app volume management than volume indicator/Pulse audio volume control? Because they both work but kind of cumbersome to access and it seems that if the application stops playing audio the volume would reset itself. That's very annoying when you want to lower the volume when you want to listen to an album on SoundCloud (its web player doesn't have a volume control widget), and the next track is unbearably loud again.\n\nA: When you are playing audio via different applications, go to Sound option  from system settings and select tab Applications. Then you will be able to see volume settings for each applications that currently play sound. eg: vlc player, Alsa audio plugin etc. You can then set volume for each applications. \nHope this might help you.\n", "Q: scp, where did my files go?

This seems to have been resolved in 15.04 with systemd now setting the brightness for display and keyboard backlight, with one caveat -- it won't set either to zero.\nThis is fine, even desired, for the display -- if I set the display to zero brightness and reboot, it's then set to 1/15 on boot. However, if I set the keyboard backlight to zero brightness, it's set to 255/255 (i.e. 100%) on reboot. Note that all this is completely fine for non-zero values; they're remembered and restored perfectly.\nAlso, even though the values aren't \"remembered\" on reboot, systemd is still storing the correct value of 0 in the two files in /var/lib/systemd/backlight/, which are pci-0000:00:02.0:backlight:acpi_video0 and platform-applesmc.768:leds:smc::kbd_backlight for the display and keyboard backlight, respectively.\nSo is there any way to change this behaviour? If I set the keyboard backlight off and reboot, it should remain off after all, not blind me on reboot...\n\nA: EDIT: This answer will not work, because the --no-clamp option wasn't merged in into systemd.\nThe systemd-backlight service is responsible for saving the backlight value at shutdown and restoring the backlight at startup. The service has a restriction that, upon restoration, the minimum backlight is at least of the value 1 or 5% of the maximum brightness, whichever is greater. However, there is a way to disable this restriction.\nTo do this, run sudo systemctl edit systemd-backlight@.service, and insert the following and save:\n[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStop=\nExecStart=/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight -no-clamp load %i\nExecStop=/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight -no-clamp save %i\n\nThis basically runs the service, but with the -no-clamp argument added in.\nSource: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=197089\n", "Q: Launcher creation errors I had created a launcher for my application an the launcher file is :-\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nName[en_IN]=stt\nExec=/home/sijoy/Documents/stt_new/STT/STT\nComment[en_IN]=System Tool Trace\nName=stt\nComment=System Tool Trace\nIcon=/home/sijoy/splash.bmp\nCategories=Utility;Application;\n\nbut it is showing the error of not able to get the required dependent libraries,as Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Can't load library: /home/sijoy/./liblog4cxx.so\nActually I am trying to create a launcher for my application which is not installed on my system but kept at a certain location with all its dependent files and runs fine if I directly click the executable going to that folder is it possible to create a launcher for it, if so how?\n\nA: It is looking for the file ./liblog4cxx.so in the default current directory, which is your home directory /home/sijoy.

For instance if I have a file called video.mp4 I can run avconv -i video.mp4 video.ogg and it will convert this video.mp4 to video.ogg. \nSo my problem(question):\nWhenever it converts any file the output file's quality is super bad compared to the original video (the input video). How can I get around with that? I mean how can I convert the file and still get the same quality?  \nIf this is not possible using this app. Can anybody suggest anything else for converting video files using the command line?\n\nA: You can adjust the video quality using the -qscale flag for that command. Using -qscale 1 should provide the best quality and if you do not use this flag, the result is usually terrible quality. Try using this instead:\navconv -i video.mp4 -threads auto -qscale 1 -aq 1 video.ogg\n\nI've also included a flag to optimize use of multiple threads and another to maximize audio quality.\n\nA: \navconv -i video.mp4 -threads auto -qscale 10 -aq 10 video.ogg\n\n10 is the highest quality.\nRef: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/TheoraVorbisEncodingGuide \nYes reference is for ffmpeg but I guess avconv and ffmpeg have a compatible interface.\n", "Q: Want to test Ubuntu Hard Drive from a Windows 7 I'm just an intern trying to do my best job here, and the company I work with asked me to do the following: Send data from a Windows 7 PC to one using Ubuntu via an ethernet cable.

But when it dwindles towards 0... Thats when I have problems.

This is what it looks like when things go haywire. I can account for 25%~ of the memory... but the other 75% is just gone for some reason. Can someone please tell me how to find what is using it? \n\n\nA: OK, so what you need to do at an absolute minimum is to add more RAM.  Games work best when they have someplace to live while they're running, and the swop space on the hard drive is a few magnitudes too slow.\nI'd go out and buy 16GB of RAM, and throw it in there.  That would solve that problem.\nIf you don't want to just upgrade RAM, you could disable other memory intensive processes, like the GUI if you have it.

In large text documents, either using Geany or GEdit, when I'm some ways down the document, if I grab the scroll bar with the mouse too close to the top of the window and drag up, it only lets me scroll up the extent of the distance to the top of the window, at which point it stops. In order to scroll to the top of the document, I have to drag from near the bottom of the window.\n\nThis is odd, because the drag bar appears where ever I hover the cursor; in other OSes this isn't a problem, IIRC, because you can only drag from where ever the always-visible drag bar is.\nI've lived with this for several years now, but it strikes me that there might be a better option behaviour-wise - either continuing to scroll even after the bar reaches the top of the window, or reverting to ordinary scrollbars so at least I am directed to drag from the correct place.

When I view properties of a file, the file owner appears as ‘user # 1004’.  Why doesn’t it show the user name?  I tried asking at #ubuntu but nobody answered.\n\nA: The file system itself only stores the numeric user and group ID for a file, it does not store the names.  The name comes from the running system's /etc/passwd and /etc/group.\nIf you mount the same filesystem on another system, that numeric ID might not correspond to the same user or group name.  Or, it may not correspond to any user or group, in which case it will appear only by its number, no matter where you view it.\nAnother situation in which this may occur is if you have deleted the user or group since the file's ownership information was set.\n\nA: The user with the ID 1004 doesn't exists (anymore) in your system.\nYou can check this with\ngrep ':1004' /etc/passwd\n\nIf there is no output, the user with the ID 1004 doesn't exist.\n\nYou can take the ownership with this command\nsudo chown $USER:$USER file\n\n\nA: The reasons this happens is because the owner member of that group was deleted by you or was deleted. This user previously had permissions to the said folder. However, since the user doesn't exist anymore, the permissions for owner show the id but not the name as a remnant metadata.\nYou can just type id into your terminal and it will give you all the groups available with their owners. \n", "Q: need help with numbering in libreoffice I am making a document in Libre Office 4.4 ,please consider following situation:\n1. this is the first item in main list\n2. this is second but something is wrong\nthis is self made list (i dont want to number this list)\nthis is second item in self made list\n1. i wanted 3. here but libre office gives me 1. :(\n\nYou might notice that the last list item should start as 3. but instead it starts as 1.\nhow to resolve this?\nscreenshot:\n\n\nA: Right clicking and in the menu select \"Continue previous numbering\"\n\n\nA: I'm on my Windows machine(LO 4.4.1.2) right now, so this may not be the same, but when I indent (with the Tab button) my list, it does separate the second list and number them properly.\nI do have to backspace the second list's numbers, but this looks like what you were asking for:\n1. this is the first item in main list\n2. this is second but something is wrong\n      this is self made list (i dont want to number this list)\n      this is second item in self made list\n3. i wanted 3. here but libre office gives me 1. \n\n\nA: Odd - I just opened a new document, selected numbering on (F12), typed something, hit return, typed something, hit return, typed something hit return and got a 1), 2), 3) numbered list.\nMaybe try a Reset for your numbering options - click down arrow next to the numbering icon, click more numbering in the drop down and you should see a numbering control panel with a reset button.\n\nA: Select outline numbering:\n\nmaking your inner (custom) list at level 2 (right click -> \"Down one level\"); and then set the numbering for the second level to \"None\":\n\nRemember to also set the \"After\" character to empty, else there will be a stray period at the start of each custom list item.\n\nA: This is another solution beside using right click > continue numbering:\n\n\n*\n\n*this is the first item in main list\n\n*this is second but something is wrong\nthis is self made list (i dont want to number this list) (use backspace to remove number)\nthis is second item in self made list\n\n*here but libre office gives 1, turnOff numbering, then turnON numbering after this, Place your cursor on this line.\n\n", "Q: Google Chrome 44.0.2403.89-1 crashes Ubuntu This morning appeared update message so I upgraded version 43.0.2357.134-1 to 44.0.2403.89-1 and happens to any of the following:\nBy opening and loading chrome ubuntu crashes.\nBy right-clicking the menu appears in black and Ubuntu crashes.\nOpening any menu, submenus may appear in black and then Ubuntu crashes.\nUninstall the program and installed it again but the problem persists.\n\nA: SOLVED: During the upgrade apparently the X Server configuration (X.Org) was changed to the nouveau driver.

I'm on day two of this now, having wiped the hard drive numerous times and reinstalled from the disk around 8 times now.  I'm still fairly new to the Linux world.\nI have been following the instructions here to get things going, and after much struggling, I got all the way to running grub-install and htfs-bless.  This is supposed to enable the boot-up process on my mac to recognize Ubuntu during startup (so that I don't have to manually boot from GRUB, which is what I have to do now).\nI run the following command (as root)\ngrub-install --target x86_64-efi --boot-directory=/boot --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=\"$(lsb_release -ds)\"\n\nIt returns the following:\nInstalling for x86_64-efi platform.\nFatal: Couldn't open either sysfs or procfs directories for accessing EFI variables.\nTry: 'modprobe efivars' as root.\nFatal: Couldn't open either sysfs or procfs directories for accessing EFI variables.\nTry: 'modprobe efivars' as root.\nInstallation finished.  No error reported.\n\nSo it reports a fatal error (twice), but then finishes the installation with no errors.  No idea.\nIt suggests that I try modprobe efivars from root, which I of course do.  It returns nothing (which it isn't supposed to), but then running again produces the exact same error.\nI go ahead and run\nhfs-bless \"/boot/efi/EFI/$(lsb_release -ds)/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\"\n\nwhich completes without comment.  The fact that it completes suggests that the grub-install created the proper file system under my distro's folder.  So this is a good sign.\nThe next step in my instructions tell me to reboot, to make sure I boot straight to Ubuntu.  This doesn't happen.  It also says that I should see Ubuntu show up under the mac bootloader screen, and I do not.\nAfter re-booting manually from GRUB, I get back in and try to continue with the instructions, and here I hit the wall.  I type\nefibootmgr\n\nand am met with the same error \nFatal: Couldn't open either sysfs or procfs directories for accessing EFI variables.\nTry 'modprobe efivars' as root.\n\nSo I try modprobe efivars as root, and when I run again, I get the same error again.\nSome searching suggests the problem is that I am booting in BIOS and not in EFI.  The obviously solution is to boot in EFI instead, but I have no idea how to do that.  There is no BIOS partition on my machine; there is only an EFIBoot partition.  There is no longer a Mac OSX system on my machine; there is only Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS.\nSometimes I'm able to get Ubuntu to boot up, other times I have to do it manually.  I can't get an Ubuntu disk image to show up in the Mac bootloader, and I can't access EFI variables.\nIf there is some file I could manually edit from the command line that would get me to boot in EFI, that could help me solve this issue.\nAny help on this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I'm not 100% positive, but a Mac that old probably has a 32-bit EFI, even if it's got a 64-bit CPU. (The first Intel-based Macs had 32-bit CPUs with 32-bit EFIs. When Apple updated to 64-bit CPUs, the EFIs lagged behind for a generation or so before the EFI was updated to 64-bit.) For a native EFI-mode boot, installing in EFI mode is most easily done with an OS that matches the EFI's bit depth -- in other words, a 32-bit OS on a 32-bit EFI, or a 64-bit OS on a 64-bit EFI. Unfortunately, Ubuntu provides no 32-bit EFI boot capability with its 32-bit version, so doing this with Ubuntu requires jumping through some significant hoops to add a 32-bit EFI boot loader to a bootable image. It can be done (I've done it), but I don't have a reference to a precise procedure. (I started to write such a document once, but covering all the possibilities proved to be a real challenge, so I set it aside and never returned to it.)\nThe EFI version of GRUB does have the ability to cross-boot a kernel of a mis-matched architecture -- that is, a 64-bit kernel on a system with a 32-bit EFI or vice-versa (provided your CPU is a 64-bit model, of course). Using this approach would require installing in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and then installing the 32-bit GRUB after the installation is complete; or hacking the 64-bit installer to include a 32-bit GRUB. I don't know of any site that describes how to do this for a Mac, but this one covers the process for an ASUS tablet with a 64-bit CPU and 32-bit EFI. (That site's down as I type this; I hope that's temporary.)\nAll that said, particularly if this is a 64-bit computer, using EFI mode for a single-boot with Ubuntu is the hard way to do it. It will be MUCH easier to treat the computer as one with a traditional BIOS. Create MBR partitions and boot the installer in BIOS mode. You'll be able to install either 32-bit or 64-bit Ubuntu, as you see fit, with no significant deviations to the installation procedure. When the Mac's firmware sees an MBR partition table, it will activate its CSM, and when it fails to find any bootable EFI boot loader, it will launch the BIOS version of GRUB in the MBR. This should all work smoothly, as if the computer with a BIOS-based model. The main pitfalls are controlling the installer's boot mode (BIOS vs. EFI) and using MBR (if you use GPT, the Mac's firmware won't enable BIOS-mode booting).\nThe main drawback is that it will be harder to update your firmware, since the firmware-update process requires an EFI-mode boot. On such an old computer, though, how likely is it you'll be updating your firmware? Also, if you later decide to dual-boot with OS X, you'll have to convert from MBR to GPT and re-install a Linux boot loader in one way or another.\n", "Q: Can't connect to MS SQL with pyodbc I just spent hours trying to acomplish a simple task.

Infact i did the same almost 6 months back on my HP Desktop but i did so much hit and trial that i have forgotten what to do this time?\nDo i need to do any or all of them or what specifically?\nDisable Secure Boot in BIOS?\nDisable quick start within Windows 8.1?\nDisable UEFI Boot and enable legacy boot?\nWhat all i need to do?\nOn top of it, i have no idea what needs to be done exactly? There are so many blogs and stuff on internet forums with a very confusing answers.\n\nA: Here is a detailed guide.Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI \nDownload the iso(you can only use the 64bit one with UEFI.), make sure that the download is not corrupted by getting it's checksum and comparing it with the one provided on the download site. You can do this on Windows8.1 by opening Powershell cd-ing to the directory of the iso and running\nGet-FileHash -Algorithm sha256/md5/etc .\\filenamegoeshere.iso(It's slow)\nthen burn it to a clean USB. (I used imageusb just 2 days ago, since Unetbootin didn't work for me). \nOnce you did this follow the guide above.\n", "Q: How to detect & configure a upnp USB to serial adaptor for RXTX development in Java I ordered a TRENDnet TU-S9 and and plugged it into my system. I heard this is plug and play and that it works on Ubuntu. I'm wondering how to determine which port identifier this USB to serial adapter will register on when its plugged in. \nWhen I go to /dev and do ls -a | grep ttyS I get:\nttyS0\nttyS1\n...\nall 32 tty entries...\n...\nttyS31\n\nSo I'm guessing these are all placeholders and maybe my serial port is mapped to /dev/ttyS0? How would I go about figuring this out if this is a upnp device?\nUPDATE\nI've been trying setserial -g to try identifying my upnp USB serial port but nothing is returned. Also tried installing and using minicom which defaults to /dev/ttyS8 but not sure if that is because it detected something or that is the default port it tries to read on.\nWhen I do dmesg | grep tty I get this:\n[50429.859191] pl2303 ttyUSB0: pl2303 converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0\n[50447.038572] usb 3-1: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0\n\nI'm basically trying to connect to the serial port using a java application and the rxtx library. I'm wondering if I can just connect with serial port id of: /dev/ttyUSB0 or would I need to connect to on of the /dev/ttyS* ports and identify the port? If that is the case I have 32 of those so would be nice to find out which one to use.\n\nA: I think a simple answer is:\ndmesg | grep tty\n\nto identify the device.\nAt this point I was able to use minicom to communicate with my external devices on /dev/ttyUSB0.\n", "Q: I want to check if Ubuntu is using my NVIDIA graphics card After giving \"nvidia-smi -a\" command I got below output, Does this means Nvidia graphic not working?

Ubuntu server from internal HDD I am using an old laptop from a business.

Ethernet and wifi are fine. \nI want to set this laptop up as an Ubuntu server for testing purposes since its a 64bit 1.9GHz processor with 4GB ram. \nCan i install Ubuntu server or even Ubuntu desktop directly from a partitioned hdd within the laptop?\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu from a live cd/dvd/usb to an empty hard drive or even one that contains another OS. But this apparently isn't an option in your computer. So you need to find an external cd or dvd reader. There are other more unusual options:If you have a hard drive with a fully installed and working copy of Ubuntu on it you can insert that hard drive in your computer and it should work.You can also clone the contents of a hard drive to another hard drive and then both hard drives will contain a working copy of Ubuntu. I would not recommend this last option because it has no benefit over installing Ubuntu from scratch.\n\nA: Windows 7 include a built-in functionality in Disk Management to shrink and expand partitions.\nTo get to this utility, open up Control Panel, and type in partition into the search box.. you’ll immediately see the link Administrative Tools\nIn the Disk Management screen, just right-click on the partition that you want to shrink, and select Shrink Volume from the menu.\nIn the Shrink dialog, you will want to enter the amount you want to shrink by, not the new size. \nIf you want to shrink your 60gb partition by roughly 20gb so that it will now be roughly 40gb, enter 20000 into the box.\nDownload ubuntu server image.iso:\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.2/ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso\nMove your ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso to the root file of your hard drive (for instance C:)\nDownload EasyBCD from here:\nhttps://neosmart.net/forums/threads/easybcd-2-3-beta-builds.642/\nMake sure you get the latest build, (you will need to register on the forum first)\nInstall Easy BCD and then run it.\nClick External Devices, then ISOboot\nBrowse to the path of the ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso you wish to add.\nGive it a name, ubuntu server then click Create Entry.\nNext time you boot you will have the option of booting to ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso.\nInstall Ubuntu alongside Windows as this guide, with manual partitioning.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n", "Q: \"Warnings\" while creating user with adduser While creating a system user using adduser, it responded with a lot of entries like the following:\nmyser@machine:~$ sudo adduser --system backup_user\nAdding system user `backup_user' (UID 108) ...\nsent invalidate(passwd) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(group) request, exiting\nAdding new user `backup_user' (UID 108) with group `nogroup' ...\nsent invalidate(passwd) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(group) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(passwd) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(group) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(passwd) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(group) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(passwd) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(group) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(passwd) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(group) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(passwd) request, exiting\nsent invalidate(group) request, exiting\nCreating home directory `/home/backup_user' ...\n\nWhat those sent invalidate lines mean?

If I type \necho home\n\nI will only see the word \"home\" as output and not the \"home/user\"\nI am the only user on this machine and have a password. \nWhy do I get the wrong output and what do I have to change to display my user's home directory?\n\nA: TL;DR Variables in Linux start with the $.\n\nThe command is\necho $HOME\n\nIf you type in\nprintenv\n\nit will show you all the variables and what they equal.\nOr\nprintenv | grep '^HOME='\n\nor a few more you can try:\nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ echo ~\n/home/terrance\nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ printf \"%b \\n\" ~\n/home/terrance \nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ printf \"%b \\n\" $HOME\n/home/terrance \n\n\nA: To print an environment variable you should use the $ sign before. So what you are doing in \necho home\n\nthis will just print the word home since the shell will not expand the variable home since it's not started with $ sign, and it should be capitalized.\nSo to have the output you should run:\necho $HOME\n\nTo list all environment variables you can use the command env.\nAlso you can get the same result of echo $HOME by running the command:\nenv | grep '^HOME'\n\nNow there is some cases when you create a new user without home directory, this may happen if you use the command useradd without the -d option or without declaring the variables HOME_DIR and BASE_DIR. So if you create this user using the useradd command this would be the case.\nSome useful links:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to add users in Ubuntu\n\n*What are environment vaiables\n\nA: Unless you explicitly created your user account with no home, all users should get a home directory. In terminal there's a variety you could access it. cd is one, cd ~ is one. Just to see the path to it, do cd; pwd, or echo ~, or echo $HOME, or \nawk -F ':' -v myusername=$(whoami) ' $0~myusername  { print $6 }' /etc/passwd\n\nThis last one uses output of whoami command to search for appropriate line in /etc/passwd file, and prints the 6th item in that line with : as field separator)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 can't login : read only file system I tried to login to Ubuntu 12.04 but each time I get back to the login screen, I've tried (Ctrl+Alt+F1) to try console mode but after giving my login/password the message incorrect login appears, so I tried recovery mode \nthe FS is mount with read only i changed it to rw :\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nreturn to the login screen and nothing happened.\nI changed /etc/fstab options from errors=remount-ro to rw, reboot the system and the problem persist\nAny help please, I need an explanation to this issue if possible.\nMany thanks\n\nA: When file system or hard disk have errors it will show as read only file system. Reboot the system and go to recovery mode. Get the root command prompt and run fsck on all partitions. After successful file system check reboot the system and try login.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: on grub pick recovery options.  Log as root, and do fsck /.  Then reboot.  If you hasn't root account, first on grub with option \"c\" use passwd command to set root password \n", "Q: Boot stuck at IRQ 22 I'm running Ubuntu 14 on a Macbook any my system froze so I performed a hard reboot. However when it came back up, it shows me the grub menu but no matter which kernel I pick the boot freezes with the line:\nirq 22, io mem 0xd3489200\n\nWhat does this mean? Is this indicating a hardware fault? \nGoogle finds me several similar posts but no solutions.\n\nA: You can try two things:\n1 easy solution\nJust unplug (from electricity) your computer for 10 seconds,\nplug again and it might work! (yes it does)\n2 if it doesn't work (edit grub)\nThe solution was in Grub\ngo to: Advanced Options\nThere I went to the 'Recovery mode option'\nprees 'e' to go to the editor.\nedit the line\nlinux /vmlinuz-3.0.2..... nomodeset acpi=off\n\npress F10 to boot.\nThat way it did boot, but it didn't recognize the keyboard.\nThis confirmed with an 'acpi' issue.\nThe next thing I did is a restarted the computer\nand went testing the different acpi options\nin this guide.\nThe one that did it for me was\nnolapic\n\nF10 once again and then my keyboard responded\nfrom there I ran 'fsck'.\nand start again.\n\nA: I'm still not sure what the original issue was, but when I rebooted using a \"recovery kernel\", that seemed to get around the issue, and now my machine boots normally.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on an Asus K501LX I'm having an incredible amount of trouble installing Ubuntu on an Asus K501LX.\nI'm booting from a USB drive, created by usb-creator-gtk. I've attempted Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.04, as well as Kubuntu 15.04 (all 64-bit).\nWhen I select \"Try Ubuntu\", 15.x hangs on the Ubuntu splash screen, while 14.x seems to work. However, when I select \"Install Ubuntu\", both 14.x and 15.x versions just throw a bunch of SCHED_ERR messages and crash. Kubuntu goes past the load screen, but then goes to a black screen and hangs.\nI've been through all of the troubleshooting documentation with no luck. My md5 hash is fine, running \"Check disk for defects\" yields an all-clear, fast bootup and secure bootup have been disabled. Does anyone have any ideas what could be causing this problem or how it could be remedied?\n\nA: I had the same issue with my k501lx. I finally got ubuntu working by enabling CSM in BIOS (you will have to disable SecureBoot first).\n\nA: You can leave disabled CSM and instead edit grub configuration file at boot. \nThe problem is about nouveau open source driver for Nvidia graphic card.\nSo, when you boot your usb and get grub screen press e when selecting try ubuntu and add after quiet splash the following string:\nnouveau.modeset=0\n\nThis will disable nouveau driver. The edited line should now seems to this:\nlinux    /casper/vmlinuz.efi  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper only-ubuquity quite splash nouveau.modeset=0 --\n\nIf this works, once you have installed Ubuntu, to keep things working, you have to add nouveau.modeset=0 to grub configuration file or blacklist nouveau driver.\nA - Grub configuration file (my solution)\nChange grub configuration file opening it as administrator:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nadd nouveau.modeset=0 to the following line as showed:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nouveau.modeset=0\"\n\nthen save with ctrl+o and exit with ctrl-x. Now you have to update grub with the following command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nB - Blacklist nouveau module\nYou can find a good example here to blacklist a kernel module (in this case nouveau)\nI hope that one of 2 solution works also for you.\n", "Q: Strange extremely nonspecific error message, malware? I use Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 with gnome 3.16, and I got the following error message in a small popup.\n\n\"Warning! System error detected. Would you like to report it?\"\n\nWhile everything was fine and dandy, no problem whatsoever. It's a relatively fresh install with nothing out of the ordinary installed.(essentially gparted, mscorefonts, atom and a few gnome extensions) I reflexively clicked it away so I'm not absolutely sure the wording is 100% exact, but I'm fairly certain. Nautilus, atom and Terminal (with no commands entered yet) were open again, and all functioned correctly.\n\nA: I wouldn't call it malware, it's just apport. \nIf you just want to get rid of the message and you feel comfortable leaving apport enabled, you can run the following command (remember, apport can sometimes send sensitive info so leaving it enabled is an issue of privacy but it does help the developers take care of bugs and performance issues):\nsudo rm /var/crash/* \n\nAlternatively, you can disable apport by running the following command:\nsudo sed -i 's/=1/=0/g' /etc/default/apport; cat /etc/default/apport\n\nThe readout should display:\nenabled=0\n\non the last line.\nNext, you  should probably also disable the apport.service from starting automatically by running the following command:\nsudo systemctl disable apport.service\n\nYou can safely ignore the subsequent warnings.\nFinally, to stop the apport service:\nsystemctl stop apport.service\n\n\nA: That is a normal message. I recommend clicking \"OK\".  \nWhile the message is open, you could xlsclients -al to list the clients of your X server (man xlsclients, of course). See also man xwininfo,man xprop and (shudder) man 7 X to track down which process has that popup open.  \nSeriously, relax. Just the apport crash reporting system. man -k apport and dpkg -L apport should lead to some interesting reading.\n", "Q: How to prevent apt-get install from removing package holds?

So I spent the $3 and bought a bluetooth USB connector.  I plugged it in to my Ubuntu 14.04 machine and I was able to share the internet connection with my phone.\nHowever, I was not able to share files between my phone and computer even after configuring the Personal File Sharing.  \nI figured it might be a driver problem so, installed  \nsudo apt-get install bluez bluez-alsa bluez-audio bluez-btsco bluez-compat bluez-cups bluez-dbg bluez-gstreamer bluez-hcidump bluez-pcmcia-support bluez-tools bluez-utils python-bluez bluewho indicator-bluetooth libbluetooth-dev  libgnome-bluetooth11 libbluetooth3\n\nThis installed blueman.

If i don't start chrome after booting and only start it later it will launch fine then crash after its been running for the same few minutes.\nMany thanks\n\nA: I have been having the same problem with ubuntu 14.04 and Chrome. I have nvidia geforce gtx 650 graphics card. The problem seems indeed to be Ubuntu's nouveau graphics card driver. The fix for me was to go to System settings -> Software & Updates -> Additional Drivers and choose a proprietary nvidia driver (or which ever card you have) instead of nouveau. This change also seems to have fixed a problem I have had with youtube's media player (may or may not apply to other media players). Fast moving video image in particular used to seem to update in sections with horizontal \"fault lines\" appearing. It seems to be gone too. \n\nA: I uninstall Chrome and then deleted all my configuration files, and nothing, got the same problem.\nThis works for me in Ubuntu 14.04 64 bits\ngoogle-chrome --disable-gpu\n\n\nA: The problem is with Google Chrome v44. You can keep working by starting chrome without gpu acceleration:\ngoogle-chrome --disable-gpu\n\nOr by removing chrome and installing the version just before that one:\nsudo apt-get remove google-chrome-stable\nwget http://mirror.pcbeta.com/google/chrome/deb/pool/main/g/google-chrome-stable/google-chrome-stable_43.0.2357.81-1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_43.0.2357.81-1_amd64.deb\n\nThis will let you use Chrome until a fix is out.\nNote: you cannot disable gpu acceleration from the settings URL, as it will freeze your system immediately:\n# DON'T go to (this might crash the system):\nchrome://gpu\n# or (this will definitely crash the system)\nchrome://flags\n\n\nA: Make sure that you have good status with Graphics Feature Status in browser. Follow this link to verify: \nchrome://gpu/\n\nYou should see all green options Hardware accelerated. If not, go to \nchrome://flags/\n\n1st line is your flag to enable Override software rendering list #ignore-gpu-blacklist.\nRestart your browser and check again your Hardware accelerated status.\nAlso, make sure that you have enough free memory during running browser\n$ free\n\n\nA: I posted a patch to LKML to work around this bug and was told that the issue had been identified as a libdrm (not Chrome) bug.\nhttps://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89842#c19\nThis issue is related to libdrm 2.40.6 only and from the link above there are other applications not, just Chrome that can encounter this same error with nouveau.\nIt is possible to downgrade to the previous version of libdrm.\nsudo apt-get install libdrm2=2.4.56-1~ubuntu2\n\nIf you want to 'lock' i.e. stop your system from automatically upgrade to 2.6.40 again do\nsudo echo \"package libdrm2\" | sudo dpkg –set-selections\n\nI've successfully downgraded to 2.4.56 and I can verify that Chrome functions as expected, with gpu acceleration switched on. \n\nA: I solved it by replacing the nouveau video driver with the nvidia drivers as described here.\nNo google-chrome --disable-gpu required.\n\nA: I saw this a while back on my entirely-non-Ubuntu bleeding-edge-everything autobuilt LFS system (I am a weirdo with no life, I admit it). Cue lots of screaming in the dmesg log about corrupted bos etc.\nFor me, another solution that let me retain hardware-accelerated rendering in most situations was to export LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE=1 in the environment before starting Chromium. Looks like DRI3 is not quite ready for prime time yet...\n\nA: I faced with the same issue on my Ubuntu 14.10, the solution is simply kill Chrome every time it eat the CPU, here is my script to do that, it worked on my case.\n#!/bin/sh\n\n#ps aux  | awk 'BEGIN { sum = 0 }  { sum += $3 }; END { print sum }'\n\n# DON VI PHAN TRAM\nMAX_ALLOWED_CPULOAD=50\nMAX_ALLOWED_MEMLOAD=50\ncore_num=$(nproc)\nMAX_ALLOWED_CPULOAD=$(expr $MAX_ALLOWED_CPULOAD \\* $core_num)\n\ncounter=0\ncontinue_high_cpuload_count=0\nmax_continue_alowed=10\n\nprint_cpu_load_with_pid(){\n    cpuload=$(ps aux  | awk 'BEGIN { sum = 0 }  { sum += $3 }; END { print sum }')\n    cpuloadpercent=$(echo \"100 * $cpuload / $MAX_ALLOWED_CPULOAD\" | bc)\n    echo \"checked at $counter times, cpuload = $cpuloadpercent %\"\n    counter=$((counter+1))\n    #$(echo 12.45 10.35 | awk '{if ($1 < $2) print $1; else print $2}')\n    decide=$(echo $cpuload $MAX_ALLOWED_CPULOAD | awk '{if ($1 > $2) print \"true\"; else print \"false\"}')\n    if [ \"true\" = \"$decide\" ] ; then\n        continue_high_cpuload_count=$((continue_high_cpuload_count+1))  \n        echo \"High cpuload detected, continue_counter = $continue_high_cpuload_count\"\n    elif [$continue_high_cpuload_count -gt 0 ]; then\n        continue_high_cpuload_count=0\n        echo \"No longer detect hight cpu, reseting continue_counter...\"\n    fi\n\n    if [ \"$continue_high_cpuload_count\" = \"$max_continue_alowed\"  ] ; then\n        echo \"Killing chrome...\"\n        kill -9 `ps -aux|grep chrome|awk '{print$2}'`\n    fi\n}\n\nwhile [ : ];do\n    print_cpu_load_with_pid\n    sleep 2\ndone\n\n\nA: Remove and install previous version helped using the following commands. I replaced i386 instead of amd64 and the installation went fine. thanks for the help.\nsudo apt-get remove google-chrome-stable\nwget http://mirror.pcbeta.com/google/chrome/deb/pool/main/g/google-chrome-stable/google-chrome-stable_43.0.2357.81-1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_43.0.2357.81-1_amd64.deb\n\n\nA: For me the problem was solved by cleaning from chrome password manager all passwords that were duplicates, expired, exaggerated long, unused and so on. It seems that choosing very complex passwords tend to crash or freeze the whole operating system and that happens in windows os too. Another thing that i did i set my swappiness down to 0.\n\nA: I generally like using chrome, but it is the only software on my Ubuntu that is guaranteed to freeze the entire OS if given enough time running.\nAnd on some occasions, I literally cannot do anything about it other than a cold reboot. If I already had another TTY opened (Alt+Ctrl+Fn)then I may or may not be able to switch into it to issue killall chrome, which will fix the OS instantly. Same, if I  already had an SSH connection pending. Sometimes the mouse cursor will move around the screen but absolutely nothing else will be responsive. Sometimes not even the mouse cursor.  \nAnyways, I found out experimentally that RAM runs out with chrome just being in use; Some awful memory leaks. So what I have done to avoid having my OS completely frozen to the point of no rescue, is somewhat a DIY. I have created a simple bash script and installed in under my user's crontab. I run it every minute. It checks for free RAM amount, and if it goes under my defined limit (I use 200 MB) it then issues killall chrome, 3 consecutive times (just in case). After that you end up with chrome gone from your screen but a dialog appears telling you what happened, how much memory you had left, and how much you have now after recovering it from chrome.\nThe script is as follows:\n#!/bin/sh\n#SETTINGS:\nMIN_RAM_BEFORE_KILLING_CHROME_MB=200\n#DATA COLLECTION:\nFREE_RAM=$(free -mo | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 4 | awk '$0 == \"free\" {i=1;next};i && i++ <= 1')\necho \"Free RAM: $FREE_RAM\"\n#ACTION:\nif [ $FREE_RAM -lt $MIN_RAM_BEFORE_KILLING_CHROME_MB ]; then\n    echo \"time to kill chrome...\";\n    killall chrome &\n    sleep 1\n    killall chrome &\n    sleep 1\n    killall chrome &\n    FREE_RAM2=$(free -mo | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 4 | awk '$0 == \"free\" {i=1;next};i && i++ <= 1')\n    DISPLAY=:0 nohup zenity --info --text=\"Chrome was killed, because your RAM had only $FREE_RAM MB free.\\nNow you have $FREE_RAM2 MB free.\"  2>/dev/null &\nelse\n    echo \"Not yet.

As a matter of fact key presses in dmesg are reported as unknown keys, suggesting there is something funny with the way kernel interprets these key presses:\natkbd serio0: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xab on isa0060/serio0).\natkbd serio0: Use 'setkeycodes e02b ' to make it known.\natkbd serio0: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0xab on isa0060/serio0).\natkbd serio0: Use 'setkeycodes e02b ' to make it known.\nBoth f2 and f3 report the same e02b keycode.\nThis feature worked just fine in 12.04 LTS. Boot flags make no difference, some make it worse (as in brightness stops responding even to software hacks, e.g. custom mappings to changing brigthness via /proc).

Why are the PID numbers not continuous? \n\nA: The process IDs missing in between are already dead and their PIDs will be reused by kernel in the later processes.\nThe dead processes won't be shown in the process table (except for zombies), hence ps -ef will not show them.\n\nA: Normally PID is continuous but some process will be dead just by the time you run the command ps -ef.\nAlso some processes may be just a subprocess of another process which is not shown in the ps -ef command. To see some expanded result and you can check the continuous PID use the pstree\npstree -p\n\nSample output:\n   ├─teamviewerd(3468)─┬─{teamviewerd}(3474)\n│                   ├─{teamviewerd}(3475)\n│                   ├─{teamviewerd}(3476)\n│                   ├─{teamviewerd}(3477)\n│                   ├─{teamviewerd}(3478)\n\nwhile if you run ps -ef you just see the parent process.\n$ ps -ef | grep teamviewerd\nroot      3468     1  0 Jul15 ?        00:07:38 /opt/teamviewer9/tv_bin/teamviewerd -f\n\n\nA: They are continuous. The PID are assigned in sequential order until maximum limit is reached. After this limit it will start over again from zero.\nSo it is just that the missing PIDs in ps -ef are of dead processes. Note that ps -ef lists only running processes.   \n\nA: On Ubuntu they are continuous. On other operating systems it might differ.\nThe kernel allocates PIDs in the range of (RESERVED_PIDS, PID_MAX_DEFAULT). It does so sequentially in each namespace (tasks in different namespaces can have the same IDs). In case the range is exhausted, pid assignment wraps around.\n( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3446727/how-does-linux-determine-the-next-pid )\nMind though ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel scheduling can fork a process so it might appear to skip numbers.\n\n*A PID will disappear when that task ends. \n\n*PIDs are not re-used until PID_MAX_DEFAULT is reached. \n\n*A reserverd PID is skipped.\n\n\nSome topics on stackoverflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/822797/about-the-pid-of-the-process\nIn the comments is a command to test the assigment of PIDs: \nfor i in {1..20}; do sh -c 'echo $$'; done\n\n", "Q: qemu not working after installation in ubuntu I intstalled qemu in ubuntu to execute a kernel .bin file using it.

Leading on from this question, I'm trying to write a bash script which will recurse two directories from the directory containing my subversion repositories, checking whether directories are repositories.

I could use this snippet, in an if statement to run svnadmin verify if 0 is returned.\nI've tried:\nfind /dir/containing/repos -maxdepth 2 -type d -exec bash -c 'if [ \"svnlook info {} >/dev/null\" = 0 ] ;then ;echo \"{}\" >>output.txt ;svnadmin verify \"{}\" >>output.txt ;fi' \\;\n\nThough I get the following warning for each directory found:\nbash: -c: -line 0: syntax error near unexpected token ';'\n\nI think I'm trying to unnecessarily cram it all into one find command, which I'm getting wrong anyway.

OpenSSH 6.9 fixes this vulnerability, but none of the supported versions of Ubuntu (12.04, 14.04, 15.04 and 15.10) have been patched.\nWhat is the best way to address this vulnerability?\n\nA: I am experiencing the same issue. While I await a fix from ubuntu I have also decided this is an issue I would address with my CSA; for the following reason.\nIf I understand the issue presented, the issue only arises if a root user on the affected computer is allowed to forward X11 connections. In my environment, the same root users on the affected computers have access to root on any system reachable from that computer, hence, if they were to conduct malicious activity, this potential vulnerability would neither help nor hinder that user.\nSecondly, if the problem depends upon the ability to forward X11 connections, then shouldn't disabling this feature with \"ForwardX11Trusted no\" and \"ForwardX11Timeout 0\" be a proper configuration fix? This is my current configuration and as I have no X11 installs, seems to fit.\n\nA: This is really poor research on the part of whoever added this issue to the PCI compliance scanners. On my scans the problem is described as the following:\n\nSynopsis\nThe SSH server running on the remote host is affected by multiple\n  vulnerabilities.\nDescription\nAccording to its banner, the version of OpenSSH running on the remote\n  host is prior to 6.9. It is, therefore, affected by the following\n  vulnerabilities :\nA flaw exists within the x11_open_helper() function in the\n  'channels.c' file that allows connections to be permitted after\n  'ForwardX11Timeout' has expired. A remote attacker can exploit this to\n  bypass timeout checks and XSECURITY restrictions. (CVE-2015-5352)\nVarious issues were addressed by fixing the weakness in agent locking\n  by increasing the failure delay, storing the salted hash of the\n  password, and using a timing-safe comparison function.\nAn out-of-bounds read error exists when handling incorrect pattern\n  lengths. A remote attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of\n  service or disclose sensitive information in the memory.\nAn out-of-bounds read error exists when parsing the 'EscapeChar'\n  configuration option.\nRecommendation\nUpgrade to OpenSSH 6.9 or later.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nA flaw exists within the x11_open_helper() function (CVE-2015-5352)\n\nThis vulnerability is one that affects SSH clients, not SSH servers (desc). An SSH client with an X environment is made vulnerable when connecting to a malicious SSH server using X11 forwarding. The scanner is inherently scanning servers not clients... In most cases, X will not even be installed on the remote server and connections will only be made to trusted servers so the scenario that this vulnerability requires is impossible to replicate.\n\nVarious issues were addressed by fixing the weakness in agent locking\n\nAgain, ssh-agent is a client program so this bug does not affect the security of the server being scanned and upgrading to OpenSSH 6.9 would do nothing to prevent this from being exploited unless the server was already compromised and being used to login to other machines using ssh-agent.\n\nAn out-of-bounds read error exists when handling incorrect pattern lengths\n\nLooking at the source code reveals that the code which contains the bug is not even present in OpenSSH 6.6 and the OpenSSH 6.8 bug is therefore not applicable.  The patch changes how the match_pattern_list() method is used but this method does not exist in OpenSSH 6.6.\n\nAn out-of-bounds read error exists when parsing the 'EscapeChar' configuration option\n\nThis bug is related only to the 'ssh' client program command line or config file parsing, not the sshd server and therefore has nothing to do with a private system which is running sshd. Additionally, this is listed in the Release Notes as a Bug, and not a Security issue so I doubt that it can do anything more than simply cause a segfault on the client machine if incorrect parameters are used.\n\nUpgrade to OpenSSH 6.9 or later.\n\nSo in summary because of all of these client issues you should upgrade your server to OpenSSH 6.9. Considering that most distributions are not yet supporting 6.9 this is absolutely idiotic advice. My advice is to keep running the latest OpenSSH that is supported by your distro using the standard and security repositories with backported fixes that are actually applicable rather than maintaining your own OpenSSH builds just because the PCI scanner said so.\n\nA: I found this blog article that listed the steps for manually installing OpenSSH 6.7. I followed the instructions, using OpenSSH 6.9 instead.\n", "Q: Lubuntu not booting without USB used to install it My Lubuntu v12.04 (I'm not using the newest one because my Laptop doesn't support PAE) doesn't boot when the USB I used to install it isn't plugged in.

When installing a new display manager on the command line you usually get a dialog asking which one you want by defualt. To run this again you can try running sudo dpkg-reconfigure lxdm and should get a dialog and select lxdm instead of lightdm as the display manager.

I have a Java app - although the answer here should be the same regardless of whether it is Java, Ruby, Python, etc. - that I would like to distribute in such a way that when devops folk go to install it, it automagically runs as a daemon, with zero config on their side. My inspiration for this comes from the Docker daemon, which is written in Go but that automagically configures itself as a daemon on Ubuntu machines. I want to do the same, but have no clue where to even begin.\nI would imagine that either:\n\n\n*\n\n*I need to somehow package my app inside a deb; or\n\n*Ship my app executable with necessary init/systemd/upstart/etc. scripts that somehow get installed\nlocally without the end user having to run them. However, in this\ncase, I’m not sure how to select which scripts to install as the user\nmay have any one of several init-like tools setup.\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: On Ubuntu (and Debian), creating a deb package would be the best way to go, as everything can be automated, so that no end-user intervention is needed. The only cases where package installation or upgrades are not automated are if the package has some configuration options that need input from the user (mainly during installation only) or if a configuration file was modified by the user and is also modified by a newer version of the package (during upgrading). In addition, after installing/upgrading a package, any startup scripts it installs are automatically started.\nYou can have multiple init scripts be installed, and have everything still work. In the case of systemd being installed and used on the user's computer, if there is both an init script and a systemd script for the same service, then the init script is ignored and the systemd script is used.\nIn terms of the packaging itself, Debian provides helper scripts that (among other things) automatically install any startup scripts you provide (I don't think upstart is supported by their helper scripts, since this is only used on Ubuntu) and start the service. For an example of the packaging, see this debian folder for the dump1090-mutability package. (Disclaimer: this is my Github account) Note that the dump1090-mutability.init file contains the init script while the dump1090-mutability.service file contains the systemd script. Note that the names of these files should be package-name.init and package-name.service, where package-name is the name of the binary package being created. (See man dh_systemd_enable and man dh_systemd_start for the systemd case.)\nOn packaging, both of these files are placed in the appropriate directories on the user's system, and the service is then started. For the rules file, I recommend that you have something like the following, so that you benefit from the automation (see this for the --with systemd part):\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n%:\n        dh $@ --with systemd\n\noverride_dh_auto_build:\n        # Specify how to build the Java files here, if there is no Makefile provided\n\noverride_dh_auto_install:\n        # Specify how to install the Java files here, if there is no `install` target in the Makefile. Don't worry about anything in the `debian` directory unless you need to install some icons.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If your app doesn't have a Makefile and is just a collection of Java source files, fill out override_dh_auto_build (where the source files are compiled and packaged into a JAR) and override_dh_auto_install (where the JAR is installed).\n\n*If your app has a Makefile, but doesn't have an install target, remove the override_dh_auto_build target and fill out override_dh_auto_install.\n\n*If your app has a Makefile and it has an install target (that can be used), remove both targets.\n\n*If your app is just a JAR file, remove override_dh_auto_build, and fill out override_dh_auto_install.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.02 downloads lts utopic kernel So an update just came up for me asking to install kernel stuff, and I looked into it.

I run exclusively Linux for my host OS on all of my computers. I am required to run windows for certain testing situations. I have used VirtualMachines with Windows XP, Windows 7 (home-pro) and Windows 8 (Have not tried 10 yet). Ultimately how well An OS will perform in a VM will depend on how much machine you can allocate to it (within reason).\nI am running an 8 core AMD 3.5ghz with 32 gigs of ram. I'm running 3 to 5 virtual machines at any given time. All of them run quite smooth whether Windows or the various flavers of Linux. I also run both VMWare Workstation 10, and VirtualBox. My server runs ESXI which has pushed me toward VMWare in the past. That said, I'm slowly moving back to VirtualBox.\nBoth VMWare and VirtualBox have their individual querks, so regardless of which you chose virtualization comes with costs. The expense of VMware Workstation is what is pushing me toward VirtualBox again. As I type this I'm in a VirtualBox VM, which is my main development machine. In the background I have running two different test VMs which happen to still be using Workstation.\nNow, between the two I find performance issues to vary. When running Windows there is very little difference between the two virtual environments. One of the biggest improvements I've come across is running multiple virtual machines on seperate hard drives, and having all those drives seperate from your host drive. Typically my VM's run exactly what you're suggesting you'd like to run: 4G of ram, and 2 cores. Though in virtualbox I tend to cap my cpu at 99%. It seems to make the host machine more comfortable to use when the virtual machine is being worked.\nKVM, I think falls down when it comes to dealing with GUIs. It's fantastic if you're doing headless machines, but when you slap a desktop on a majority of your vm usage, you're better off going another direction.\nWine is a waste of time for most things in my experiance. I'm not a fan, and it's simply not a viable option for me in any sense.\nIn terms of reliability I find both VirtualBox and VMware Workstation to be pretty rock solid. But if you're comparing VMWare Player, and VirtualBox I'd go VirtualBox hands down simply for the fact that you can utilize snapshots, which in my work are invaluable.\n", "Q: What is the app that does the SHOW DESKTOP action There is an icon on an Xfce panel to show the desktop.

I followed instructions here. I have a problem that happens intermittently where, upon attempting to suspend, the OS locks up instead. The screen will be off, the keyboard light still on, and the machine will continue to do something (as evidenced by the very warm temperature of the laptop). However, it has become completely unrecoverable by the normal means: I'm unable to move to virtual console, turn on the screen, or perform any operation. I have to perform a hard reboot when this happens.\nI've not been able to recover any information as to why it's doing this. I'm not sure what error, if any, is failing and causing this behavior. What can I do to debug this issue and figure out what is causing this failure to allow the laptop to suspend?\nAs a note, most of the time this does not happen, but it happens frequently enough for it to be a real hassle (at least once or twice a week, depending on how often I'm moving around with my laptop).\nUPDATE 11/2/2015: At some point (even before my upgrade to 15.10) I noticed the behavior occurring much more frequently. It's to the point where I rarely chance letting my laptop suspend lest it lock itself up and force me to reboot it (after some period of time when I come back to find it locked up and toasty). Instead I just shut it down completely, which is pretty annoying. My ASUS doesn't have the same issue running the same OS and mostly the same software configuration so I'm guessing it's a hardware issue (something is not suspending properly and making it impossible to recover after a suspend as well).\nUpdate 12/5/2015: As of today it's been at least a few weeks without the issue, even as I try to reproduce it. I believe it may have been fixed in some update of something. I'll leave the question open for a few more weeks to see if it happens again.\n\nA: I have not experienced the issue since the last update to this question. It must have been fixed in some update along the line.\n", "Q: Set a local repo in order apt-get to handle .deb dependecies I am trying to do something, which I have already done on .rpm distributions, on Fedora more exactly.

This question is related to my finding that Ubuntu and its derivative uses both SYSLINUX and GRUB bootloaders on ISO images for Desktop releases.\nWhen booting from 32-bit ISO image, it is said that SYSLINUX handles the boot process (the boot which shows beautiful splash screen, with progress dot animation).\nBut when booting from 64-bit ISO image, GRUB is used instead (the black and white screen, clearly showing GNU GRUB  version... on top of screen).\nHence, to rephrase my question, what are the differences which made Ubuntu to use GRUB and SYSLINUX on its ISO images? Why not just use either one instead?\nFor clarification\nThis question has been somehow confusing due to my lack of clarification and hardware availability. I have added this answer (or scroll down) to explain better on 64-bit ISO image.\nWhat answer is not\nThe comment thread below already gave some idea, but I ought to make clear here. The answer is not because either one supports EFI properly. This question aimed to find out more toward fundamental reasons, rather than just EFI support.\nSay, if this were to be asked in other way i.e. \"Why both GRUB and SYSLINUX are used in the ISO images?\" then this might give answer like, \"GRUB is included to support EFI-capable systems and SYSLINUX has been always included and works on BIOS-only systems\" -- which is not my intention.\nI must admit that the EFI support is likely part of the answer.\nHowever, I feel that it should not be the only thing in the answer. There must be more than just EFI support, which made Ubuntu to include two bootloaders in their ISO images, yes? Or, is it really the EFI support be the only difference? Help me answer this, if any.\n\nA: This is my preliminary answer, that makes some part of my question be understood better but still doesn't answer the question itself.\nSome clarifications below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unlike 32-bit ISO image, the 64-bit ISO image actually includes both GRUB and SYSLINUX (this is confirmed by /boot/grub and /isolinux directories are both found in the ISO image)\n\n*GRUB is shown when the ISO image is booted on EFI-capable machine.\n\n*SYSLINUX is shown when the ISO image is booted on BIOS-only machine.\n\n*Plymouth handles the progress dot animation, regardless of GRUB or SYSLINUX is shown (this was correctly hinted by @muru in the first comment)\n\n\nBoot experience: I wrote \"EFI-capable\" because even my machine has implemented EFI, I had turned off \"Secure Boot\" feature (1,2) in order to boot Ubuntu (Xubuntu 14.04 in my case) from Live USB.\n\n\n*\n\n*Xubuntu 14.04 64-bit release is able to boot while Secure Boot is turned on, after it has been installed to the local disk (not Live USB).\n\n*Xubuntu 16.04 64-bit release is able to boot while Secure Boot is turned on.\nTried method: Instead of trying with physical DVD media and boot from an external optical drive, I had used virtualization software (VirtualBox 4.3 in my case) instead to prove above cases.\n\n\n*\n\n*VirtualBox 4.3 already has an option to switch between EFI and BIOS system, can be found under Machine > Settings > System > Motherboard - Extended features: Enable EFI (special OSes only). By default, the option is unchecked (3).\n\n*A virtual machine must be created using 64-bit version of VirtualBox, running on 64-bit host system. An Xubuntu 14.04 64-bit ISO image is used in my following attempts.\n\n*First attempt: I ran the ISO image with default settings (this assumes a BIOS system). The virtual machine will show purple background with icons at bottom. This is SYSLINUX.\n\n*Second attempt: I closed the machine and went to the settings, checked the option (3) to enable EFI. Using the same ISO image, I started the virtual machine again. This time, it took some time until it shows GNU GRUB  version... with monochrome text. This is GRUB.\n\n*In both attempts, proceeding boot process will show progress dot animation while booting.\n\n*This section of page on Ubuntu Wiki has included screenshots to describe the two cases above.\nDisclaimer: This answer intends to clarify the boot experience and tried method. However, this is not the final answer to my question. The final answer will be posted separately, if I managed to self-answer the question.\n\nA: This is my final answer, which is based on information found by matching keyword within 2000+ pages in this listing on Ubuntu Wiki. What I found were dated notes of Ubuntu development and specifications (read: words, words, words), so that took me some time to reach this answer.\nOps, wrong naming\nTo begin with, the naming of boot loaders shall be clarified:\n\n*\n\n*Name with all letters capitalized refers to the boot loader (e.g. GRUB, SYSLINUX)\n\n\n*Name with initial letter capitalized refers to the project name or, several or all variants of the boot loader family (e.g. Syslinux)\n\n\n*In particular, 'Syslinux' is a collection of boot loaders that includes 'SYSLINUX', 'ISOLINUX', 'EXTLINUX' and 'PXELINUX'\nFollowing the naming convention, the question is actually referring to \"ISOLINUX\" for \"El Torito no-emulation\" bootloader, not \"SYSLINUX\". Perhaps the latter is used interchangeably with the former in old days. Nevermind, then.\nBrief history\n2005: ISOLINUX is choosen for Ubuntu CD boot loader, instead of GRUB.\n\nGRUB has been suggested before as a possible replacement boot loader, but this approach was tried in the Warty live CD where we observed significant regressions in bootability versus the ISOLINUX-using install CD. We feel that sticking with solutions based on ISOLINUX is the most appropriate approach for a long-term-supported release.\n-- from CdBootloader - Ubuntu Wiki\n\n2006: gfxboot has been added; This supports information quoted in 2010.\n\nIn Dapper, we added gfxboot to our amd64 and i386 CD images, providing a friendly graphical boot menu as the first thing users see when booting Ubuntu CD images on those architectures [...]\n-- from PortableGfxboot - Ubuntu Wiki\n\n2009: ISOLINUX (noted as SYSLINUX) is still used for booting Ubuntu CD.\n\nUbuntu live CDs still boot using SYSLINUX, which does not include support for starting the kernel in graphics mode. This means that live CDs display a graphical boot menu, then switch back to text mode to start the kernel, and will then normally switch back to graphics mode later. As a result, live CDs will currently flicker more than normal installed systems at boot time.\n-- from BootGraphicsArchitecture - Ubuntu Wiki\n\n2010: ISOLINUX has been used, but GRUB 2 is needed for UEFI support.\n\nCurrent Ubuntu CDs use ISOLINUX, with the gfxboot extensions from SuSE implementing graphical menus.\nThis has proven to be rather difficult to maintain, with only one person in Ubuntu who understands the theming code involved [...]\n[Since] GRUB 2 recently had graphical menu support added to it upstream, moving to that has the potential to reduce our maintenance load. It seems likely that we will need to use GRUB 2 anyway in order to support EFI, and having to configure two different boot loaders on our CDs would be undesirable.\n-- from FoundationsTeam/Specs/MaverickCDBoot - Ubuntu Wiki\nPursuant to foundations-m-grub2-boot-framebuffer, we will need to look into our ability to support graphical boot menus in EFI. GRUB has some level of support for UGA and GOP graphics.\nThis requires using GRUB for CD booting, or at least having the bare minimum of configuration to support it [...]\n-- from FoundationsTeam/Specs/MaverickUefiSupport - Ubuntu Wiki\n\nDifferences found or not\nFollowing brief history, we now understand that:\n\n*\n\n*ISOLINUX was preferred due to GRUB had regressions back then (2005)\n\n\n*ISOLINUX was still preferred despite lack of support for starting the kernel in graphics mode that cause flickering during boot transition (2009)\n\n\n*ISOLINUX has been used with gfxboot to provide graphical menu, which was not implemented or not possible with GRUB back then (2010)\n\n\n*GRUB has been added later to boot with UEFI support since Maverick (post-2010)\nThen, I realized that it is not the difference between GRUB and SYSLINUX that made Ubuntu live CD include two boot loaders.\nFundamental reasons\nFrom my reading, these supporting facts actually hinted that:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu live CD has been using particular boot loader that had better support for providing graphical menu and theme, and smooth transition to show boot splash. In this case, SYSLINUX (precisely ISOLINUX).\n\n\n*When UEFI systems became increasingly common, then only Ubuntu had included GRUB (precisely GRUB 2) in Ubuntu live CD to boot with UEFI support.\nAbove all, I believe this answers the question that I had for more than a year and this answer has finally put my curiosity to rest.\nTL;DR GRUB and ISOLINUX are both used in Ubuntu live CD for exclusive reasons; Both were included in live CD for better boot experience and hardware support.\n", "Q: How do I read the messages printed on startup?

I used the live cd to install and was pretty sure I changed the boot loader installation to the usb stick, but apparently I didn't. Atleast thats the only way I could see this happening. I restart my computer and it gives me a list of options to boot from, windows, ubuntu, etc. \nThats not what I wanted, I wanted to only boot ubuntu when I selected the usb stick.

I'm not really sure if I'm using uefi or not.\nHere's another log with both harddrives plugged in\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/11927598/\n\nA: You have a UEFI capable machine, and is sounds like you did a full install to the USB stick.  You select whether you are running in UEFI mode in the UEFI Settings/BIOS (not the legacy or compatiblity setting).  You did not have the USB present when you ran boot report, so we can't tell how it was created, but for UEFI, at a minimum it should have an EFI partition, a swap partition, and the root partition.  \nThe Ubuntu bootloaders should have been installed to the USB's EFI partition, but a common problem is that they instead get copied to the internal disk's EFI partition, which looks like what happened (The files under /EFI/ubuntu/...  These bootloaders are just files, so you can copy them to the same directory on the USB's EFI partition.  Also, put them into the USB's /EFI/Boot directory:  Copy shimx64.efi into /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi and also copy grubx64.efi to /EFI/Boot/grubx64.efi.  This will work whether or not secure boot is enabled.  This should run grub off the grub config file in /EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg.\nThe MBR bootloader on SDA is useless on a GPT disk without a grub-bios partition, and for UEFI, should be ignored.  \nSomewhere along the line, the Windows nvram entry to boot Windows got deleted (see the efibootmgr listing in boot-repair's report).  You can add it back yourself with efibootmgr   (use bootmgfw.efi, see below).  The efibootmgr may be run in a terminal off the live media.  Of course, the Ubuntu entry is wrong, there is no Ubuntu on the disk, so maybe you can just change it (name and bootloader) to a Windows entry.  The Ubuntu entries on the hard disk's EFI may be ignored, delete them if you need the room, but usually, there's plenty of room in the EFI partition.  Below is an example with Windows being the 004 entry, yours will be different.\nBoot0004* Windows Boot Manager  HD(2,e1800,82000,04b9edc2-fc48-11e1-8ec1-e7137b3aaf29)\nFile(\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi)WINDOWS....\nIn the UEFI settings, for boot order, put the USB (and DVD) before the hard disk, and you should boot into grub when the USB is present, and boot Windows without the USB.\nSounds like a reinstall fixed things up for you.  \n", "Q: If I have disable recovery option and someone still get's to root using the ro recovery nomodeset how do I password protect root?

Once you have entered this mode you can use the arrow keys to select the text you wish to copy and paste.

Upon booting I am presented with the following kernel panic:\n\nAfter forcefully shutting down the machine I can get back into the bootloader and either try again (which reproduces the same kernel panic) or go into Advanced options for Ubuntu and select a different kernel version: \n\nSelecting any of the non-safe mode kernels in the list except the newest one, 3.13.0-58, will allow me to boot the machine and use it (typing this question from the laptop in question).  I checked my log for apt (/var/log/apt/history.log) and found that during an upgrade I did yesterday the system installed kernel 3.13.0-58 and the problem showed up after this event.\nMy main concern here is that the kernel panic appears to be from when the system tries to set the target cpu frequency and either it fails to set it or some integrity check fails but I don't know nearly enough to actually figure it out.  I do not think it is a hardware problem because using any of the older kernels boots (and appears stable, has been running for over 2 hours on 3.13.0-38).  Could it be a hardware issue which I should get an RMA for or is it a conflict between my existing system and the new kernel?  If it is indeed a software issue how do I resolve it?  Thanks in advanced!\n\nA: The issue I was experiencing seemed to be a temporary one.  A few days since posting a new kernel version has been made available for my system (3.13.0-58.97).  After updating to this latest version the kernel panic has stopped and the system behaves as expected.  Somewhat silly but for anyone else with this issue you can simply revert to an older kernel until a newer patch is made available.\n\nA: Boot from whichever kernel that works. Open terminal and enter sudo apt-get autoremove. This should remove any old kernel image files. I had the same problm with the same laptop (:P) and this fixed it.\n\nA: I've also this problem. Tested on two Acer TM (TravelMate) B115. One manufactured on 2014/07/15 (TMB115-M-C1MW) and the other on 2015/06/25 (TMB115-M-C2ZM).\nThe problem disappears if the computers are booted without the power charger. Very curious!\nFor \"generic\" kernels:\n3.13.0-46 works fine.\n3.13.0-62 and 3.13.0-63 have the problem.\n3.19.0-26 works fine but Synaptic ClickPad (TouchPad) is not well supported. It's seen only like a mouse. xinput command shows SYN1B7D:01 06CB:2991 unknown\nTo migrate to 3.19 kernel you need to follow https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-core-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-video-all-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-input-all-lts-vivid libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-vivid libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-vivid libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-vivid:i386 libglapi-mesa-lts-vivid:i386\n\nFortunately I found that the BIOS has an option to configure the TouchpPad mode (Basic or Advanced). It says:\nPlease make sure I2C driver is installed before Advanced feature enabled. Otherwise, touchpad will be no function.\nI changed this option from Advanced to Basic and now the TouchPad for the latest TMB115 works fine. xinput command recognizes it.

Version 8.31 of libpcre3 and pcregrep are available from the 14.04 repository.\n\nYour mistake is the use of sudo in the command\nsudo ./configure && make && make install\n\nThis runs the configure script as root (resulting in root-owned output files) and then attempts to run make and make install as your normal user. The make step is failing because of the root-owned .deps/ files.\nThere's no good reason to use sudo when configuring and building software from source in your own home directory: instead, run\n./configure\nmake\n\nand then, once you have confirmed that the software has built successfully, use sudo for the final make install - which does require root privileges, at least for the default installation location\nsudo make install\n\nTo fix the ownership now, you will either need to run\nsudo chown ashley:ashley /home/ashley/Downloads/pcre-8.37\n\nor remove the whole directory and start over with a freshly unpacked tarball.\n", "Q: How to install package from 12.04 on 14.04?

I want to make some app working, while virtualbox is in \"save state\" mode.\nIs it possible ? And if yes, please describe a little how can I do that ?\nAny help will be appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: If I remember my VBox correctly, the \"save state\" mode (called \"suspend\" in VMware) is equivalent to a bare-bones computer's Hibernate mode if I remember right.\nOn a bare-bones system installation, WoL (Wake on LAN) and a few special BIOS-level things can still operate in Standby or Hibernate mode.\nThe difference about VMs from a bare-bones system, though, is that they don't have those types of capabilities.  During a \"save state\" mode, or a VM put into \"standby\" on VMware, nothing running in the virtual guest works, because the system is 'frozen' like Hibernate does.  There's no way for such states to permit programs/applications to operate in a guest operating system in a 'frozen' state.  Just like a computer in \"hibernate\" mode, on which none of its services will operate.\n\nA: No, it is not possible to run any app when the VM is in save state.\nSave state is equivalent of sleep option in OS. This is what the official manual says,\nVirtualBox \"freezes\" the virtual machine by completely saving its state to your local disk.\nWhen you start the VM again later, you will find that the VM continues exactly where it was left off. All your programs will still be open, and your computer resumes operation. Saving the state of a virtual machine is thus in some ways similar to suspending a laptop computer (e.g. by closing its lid).\nIf you consider running an app and want less overhead then look at the option of headless mode. I am not sure headless mode available for Windows. I used run ubuntu and other linux/unix OS on headless mode, which saves considerable amount of RAM usage.

I've been stuck on this for days.\n\nA: Those errors are saying:\n\n\n*\n\n*there is already a web server running on port 80, so you can't start another one\n\n*Apache can't find its PID or lock files, because it's missing some configuration and doesn't know where to look\n\n\nWhat I think is happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*The other web server already running on port 80 is Apache itself.  The reason it can't recognise itself is that it can't find its PID file, so it can't tell that Apache is already running.\n\n\nFor a service to be able to restart or stop itself with scripts, it needs to keep a record somewhere of which process it is running as.  This is stored in a PID file.  The PID file tells the restart/stop script which process the service is already running under, allowing it to be stopped.  Without it, the restart/stop script doesn't even know that the service is already running, let alone which process it's running as.\nYou need to check your Apache configuration directory, as something may be missing or corrupt.  If you do not find the cause and are desperate, keep a record of any customisations you've made to Apache configuration, then purge and reinstall Apache, then restore your customisations by hand.\nIs it possible that this was caused by gitlab?  It's possible though it's not certain.  Some software likes to add files to Apache's configuration under, for example, /etc/apache2/conf.d/.  Check that directory for anything that looks like it might have been added by gitlab or other third party software.\n\nA: All those variables are defined in /etc/apache2/envvars in my server.  Check for the existence of that file and that it is set up properly. I had to make some minor changes to it, I think, but pretty much use it as-downloaded.\n", "Q: Write to a non-existant device using dd Hello I wanted to write an iso image to an USB stick (which is in /dev/sdd)\nbut I've made a slight typo, instead of typing:\ndd if=/path/to/downloaded.iso of=/dev/sdd\n\nI typed:\ndd if=/path/to/downloaded.iso of=/dev/sdd}\n\nAfter that dd told me it wrote arround 1.5 MB, so I checked, and the file \"/dev/sdd}\" was created. Is this harmful?\nPD: I deleted the /dev/sdd} file.\n\nA: No; it is just a regular file on disk.  Had you let it finish, you would simply have had a copy of the iso file named /dev/sdd}.  In other words, there is nothing special about the /dev directory so you can create new regular files there all you like.

It appears there is some discussion on this issue. Octave only allows 8-bit pixels in using imread(). I have downloaded, rebuilt and installed GraphicsMagick with configure set to use 16 bit. I have reset the path and then tried downloading the tarballs for Octave 4.0, Octave 3.8 and Octave 3.6.2. All three fail to configure imread() into the build. According to the documentation, you must rebuild GraphicsMagick from source to configure 16-bit images and from there you must rebuild Octave from source to link in the re-configured GraphicsMagicK. Latest error is: \"configure: WARNING: GraphicsMagick++ library fails tests.

I need openssh 6.9 or better, is that also possible?\n\nA: Yes, run the following commands to upgrade those packages to the newest versions available for 15.04:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthat command updates the list of packages available from the ubuntu server\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server apache2\n\nthat command will upgrade those packages to the newest versions\nYou may want to upgrade all packages to get all the newest security u updates:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nFinally, you may want to run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to get the newest kernel updates which also include security updates for the kernel to be most secure but choose wisely when you run this command as it may make changes to the system that can have an effect on the way things function so do not run the dist-upgrade command unless you have some extra down time to spare in case you need to fix some stuff. Also, you may need to reboot after a dist-upgrade for the changes to take effect.\nWhat is \"dist-upgrade\" and why does it upgrade more than \"upgrade\"?\n\nA: For this versions you need a PPA or you need to compile the desired version.

I've noticed while setting up my laptop with Ubuntu for the first time that virtually every guide on how to install X program asks me to\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIs it just good practice or is it really that important to keep updating everything?\n\nA: If you add a new repository, the command\nsudo apt-get update\n\nis necessary for the system to know, there is a new repository.\nAnd the command is suggested before you install a new software, to update the repository database, to get the latest version of this package\nFurthermore, it is necessary to publicize the system that new packages have been added to the repositories.\n\nA: The previous steps in the tutorials all add repositories or such, and an update needs to be run for this to be recognised by stuff. (Bad wording I know)\n\nA: As others explained, apt-get update updates only the list of available packages.\nThis is indeed important and necessary, because not every old version of packages is still available on the mirror servers.\nSo if you do a apt-get install foo right after installing, it might be that you just get an error about foo-1.2.3-ubuntu4 not found, because the current version is foo-1.2.4-ubuntu1 and the old versions package is not available from the server anymore. This can happen without any modification of the repositories, because when you install a new system, the package lists are usually quite old.\nSo not only you won't get the most recent version without the update, but it is possible that you can't install the package at all.\nIndependently from that problem, always do apt-get update and apt-get upgrade!!! on a regular basis, because else your system will contain publicly known security holes!\n\nA: In simple words apt-get update fetches the package lists from all repositories founded in the /etc/apt/sources.list file or /etc/apt/sources.list.d dir and updates them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies.\nfor that whenever you want to add a repository you should do apt-get update to retrieve the needed information about packages founded in that repository.\nAlso, it's a good habit to just do apt-get update always before any installation to check whether a change occur to any package in your added repositories.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 detects Vodafone 3g dongle, but fails to connect Earlier I used Ubuntu 12.04 where my Vodafone 3G Dongle (HUWAEI modem) used to connect seamlessly via network manager Mobile Broadband.

It only works on disks using the older MBR (DOS style) partitions .\nHowever, as the warning says, parted (an alternative to fdisk) does work for disks using GPT partition types.\nThe warning is not related to the 1MB free space.

I want to sell my old SSD on EBay. How do I prepare the hard drive to protect my personal data and get the hard drive in a good shape using an Ubuntu live cd?\n\nA: Use lsblk to list all the drives and find yours /dev/sdx.\nRun the following:\n# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdx bs=8M && sync\n\nReplace x with the drive you want to wipe. Run it multiple times if you're paranoid (eject and reinsert the drive each time to ensure that the data gets flushed).\nThis will erase everything, so be careful. I mean it. It's not possible to recover data by any means after this.\nEDIT: based on further reading, it's quite likely that with the above method the drive will be securely erased, but some pieces may be recoverable (very little chance). With this warning in mind, I am not deleting this answer as this offers a very simple method to wipe data, and the recovery technique requires physically bypassing the ssd controller, which in most cases will damage the drive itself.\n\nA: The accepted answer here did not work for me, and I might save others from wasting their time with a different answer:\nDrop Ubuntu live for this purpose. Get DBAN (http://dban.org).\n\nDBAN is a linux bootable that launches a program with a single purpose--to erase hard disks. It boots, you choose a disk, specify a method of erasure.   It has a choice of several algorithms. The simple/fast method will write disk over with 0's. Intermediate will rewrite several times and most secure method will take a week or more to completely obliterate any chance that even the NSA can recover any of your data.  \nUsing the hdparm-based approach described above, I never succeeded. I could not get past the \"frozen disk\" problem.  As the accepted answer here warns, when hdparm -I output says frozen, the password assignment and erasure methods do not work. Among the many things I tried to unfreeze this, none helped.  When booting from the Ubuntu live drive, suspending and then resuming caused the keyboard and mouse to become disabled, so the first suggested fix failed.  \nI usually think \"I'll keep banging on this till it works\" and I kept trowling for suggestions to unfreeze these from the Ubuntu live disk. I probably spent 5 hours trying various things to unfreeze these disks.  If you Google, you'll see a laundry list of things to do for this, some of which seem ridiculous. For example, it is suggested to disconnect the drive from the SATA and power cables, start the machine, then reach in and plug in the drive after the system starts.  Electrocution, anyone? \nOTOH, DBAN was a success first time. It takes about 3 minutes to boot up.  We chose the DOD wipe, which is in the middle of the security spectrum. It writes over the disk 31 times with random noise.  The only shortcoming is that it took 8 hours for a 1TB disk drive. To erase a dozen machines, I made 6 bootable USB and got it done over 2 nights. I was trying to wipe Dell workstations that were 3-5 years old with 1TB SATA drives. Maybe this would be faster with better computers. Or smaller drives. It really does take 8 hours.\nIn my opinion, writing over the disk 31 times was overkill.   I would sleep well if I overwrote each drive a just a few times. I already had destroyed the partition tables and repartitioned the drives.  My experience is that an attacker generally can't recover anything useful after just doing that part. In my opinion, if the attacker does not have quite a bit of information about the file table that was erased, there is virtually no chance they can recover much useful information.  Here you need to make a personal assessment about how hard your enemy will try to recover your data and what data you have to protect from them.  \nIf you are insistent that you want to use Ubuntu live, you are stuck on Ubuntu Island and are not allowed to use any other tools, you can still use the terminal to destroy the partitions, make new partitions, new file systems, and use dd or similar to write on the disk over a few times.  I'd be shocked if anybody could recover anything useful.\nI'm not teasing when I say this. If you are worried about the NSA or Russian gangsters getting your drive and recovering something after you destroy the partitions, make new partitions, create new file systems, and write 0's and 1's over every sector, then you have a worse problem than software erasure can solve. The only rational thing to do is to take the drive and shoot it with your rifle a few times. Or get a sledge hammer. \n\nA: The best way to wipe a SSD is to issue an ATA SECURE_ERASE command rather than using low-level utilities such as dd, because it's faster and more reliable, due to a number of reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run lsblk and determine to which block device the drive is currently mapped (if you have only that drive attached it will likely be mapped to /dev/sda)\n\n*Run sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda and determine whether the drive is currently frozen or not:\nSecurity: \n    Master password revision code = 65534\n        supported\n    not enabled\n    not locked\n        **frozen**\n    not expired: security count\n        supported: enhanced erase\n    2min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 8min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT.\n\nIf it is, suspend the system and resume:\nSecurity: \n    Master password revision code = 65534\n        supported\n    not enabled\n    not locked\n    not frozen\n    not expired: security count\n        supported: enhanced erase\n    2min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 8min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT.\n\n\n*Run sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass password /dev/sda to set a security password (this is mandatory in order to securely erase the drive)\n\n*Run sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-erase password /dev/sda to securely erase the drive\n\n\nAs pointed out by Takkat, mind that this won't catch reallocated bad sectors.\nTo catch those as well, if you have any and if supported by the drive, you can issue an enhanced ATA SECURE_ERASE command, that writes manufacturer-predefined patterns multiple times and catches reallocated bad sectors as well:\n\n\n*Run sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-erase-enhanced password /dev/sda to securely erase the drive\n\n", "Q: Playlists in mediaplayers not able to trace song files after restarting ubuntu 14.04 LTS Rhythmbox, VLC player, Audacious, I tried all. Similar problem arises. After creating playlists, it is working fine for the first time. After restarting and playing the playlists, error message appears telling that 'cannot find file.' The songs were saved in the system by windows7. Machine is double boot with Ubuntu and Windows7. Is it something connected with partitions?\n\nA: As per your question. I understand that the songs are in partition meant for Windows. Please check whether the Windows partition is listed in mounted partitions using the command:\ndf -h\n\nIn the case of ubuntu 14.04, by default user needs to enter sudo password to mount windows partition.\nOr else you can add an entry in /etc/fstab at the end of the file.\n\nSee my above image of Disk Utility for example. Here songs are in partition dev/sda5 (See the Device type in image) and the partion is NTFS (see Type in image). I have created a directory mp3 in /opt to mount the partition. \nEnter the command:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nAdd the below entry as last line and save the file.\n/dev/sda5   /opt/mp3       ntfs    defaults        0       0\nYou have to change /dev/sda5 to your requirement.

You can create a httpd.conf in the apache2 directory, and load any further configuration from it by including the following line in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.\nInclude /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nYou don't need that file to configure apache, but you can create it if other software relies on it being there.\n", "Q: how to swich from different VGA on Ubuntu 14 lts What I checked out:\nsudo lshw -c video\n*-display               \n   description: VGA compatible controller\n   product: Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller\n   vendor: Intel Corporation\n   physical id: 2\n   bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n   version: 09\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n   configuration: driver=i915 latency=0\n\nsudo lspci -nnk | grep -i vga -A3 | grep 'in use'\nKernel driver in use: i915\nKernel driver in use: radeon\n\nsudo lspci -nnk | grep -i vga -A2\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0a16] (rev 09)\nSubsystem: Dell Device [1028:0609]\nKernel driver in use: i915\n03:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

To do so, reboot the computer and, as soon as it turns on again but before the OS starts loading, hit del or F2 or whichever key your machine uses. \nUnfortunately, different motherboard manufacturers have different keys to enter the BIOS setup. There is usually a message telling you something along the lines of \"Press X to enter SETUP\" where X is the key you need to hit. For example:\n\nOnce there, you need to find something that looks like this:\n\nThen, a screen like this where you can set your CD to be the 1st boot device:\n\nUnfortunately, the details will vary depending on your machine. You'll have to play with it a bit to figure it out. The basic idea is that you need to tell your machine to try to boot from the CD instead of the hard drive. It won't always do so by default. \n", "Q: How to stop firefox from downloading files in public computer to its Home/Download folder? I work in IT-department and we have a situation. We have public computers installed in city library and they are using Ubuntu 12 kind off kiosk operating system. People are opening and downloading personal files via firefox and the files are saved to home/dowloads. I can't figure out how to make so that you can only open files from firefox without them being downloaded to computer or make some kind off scheluded empty folder task that the next user can't read someone others files from the downloaded files.\n\nA: I focused on this:\n\nwithout them being downloaded to computer\n\nThere is a Mozilla tool for this called mkiosk:  \n\nFirefox Kiosk Mode with optional Tabs Guides for Public Access Point. Complete solution. Block downloads/addon, bookmarks, reset kiosk inactivity, retry on errors, restricted interface, show favorites as buttons and more! \n\nThis will fully block downloads from Firefox (and also prevent any changes to settings (like importing profiles and things like that)). \n\nA: The Solution for your problem will be a shell script which will delete those downloaded files in regular time intervals.\nPut this in your shell script and save it as deldownloads.sh\nfind /home/<username>/Downloads/* -mtime +1 -exec rm -f {} \\;\n\nMore options\n\n\n*\n\n*You can change the path to point to any folder.

A “+5″ value means more than 5 days/minutes while a “-5″ value means 5 days/minutes or less. You can also use a combination like “+5 -10″ to denote an interval that is more than 5 days/minutes and less than 10 days/minutes.\n\n*The “exec” command will work for command like “cp”, “mv”, “rm”, “rmdir” etc. Other than deleting old files, you can get it to perform other tasks as well, such as moving a file out of Dropbox folder.\nNow run this command\n\nsudo chmod 777 deldownload.sh\n\nMethod 1\nOpen the File Manager app and browse to the Home folder.

I bet there must be :P\nEdit: I am using ubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: Give a try to this command:\nps ax | grep \"java\" | egrep -v \"eclipse\" | cut -b1-06 | xargs -t kill\n\nthis will search for all processes containing java and execluding eclipse then kill them\n\nA: Using awk\nps ax | awk '/java/ && !/eclipse/ {system(\"kill \"$1)}'\n\nThe command kills all java processes, but not the process eclipse.\n\nA: How about :\npgrep -af 'java' | grep -Po '^[^ ]+(?!.*eclipse)' | xargs kill\n\n\n\n*\n\n*pgrep -af 'java' searches for java in the full command line of the processes and list them\n\n*grep -Po '^[^ ]+(?!.*eclipse)' looks among the searched processes and get the process IDs of the processes that do not have eclipse in their full command lines\n\n*xargs kill will kill the processes.\n\nA: jps -m | grep -v eclipse | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -t kill\nUse jps to make sure that you are looking for just the java commands and not all the commands which have java in their path.\n\nA: ps ax | grep \"java\" | egrep -v \"eclipse\" | cut -b1-06 | xargs -t kill\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 locks and asks for unknown password (pc w/ UEFI firmware) I got a new computer at work. It is a pc with UEFI firmware and no grub is accessible (as far as I am aware of). It came with Ubuntu 15.04. When I turned the computer on it logged directly to Ubuntu (without asking any password). Then after sometime it locked and asked for the Password to login with the user User. As I do not have administrative permissions I do not know the password so I just restarted the computer the first time and searched from some clarifications on how to deal with this but with no success (maybe I am not searching with the correct keywords). \nFor this reason I ask you: is there a way to find out this password?\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nA: You can't find out a password on Ubuntu. Maybe with the use of some hacking tools and brute-force algorithms, but this is not useful in such cases, and it's not necessary.\nHowever you have a few options:\nOption 1: The \"morally correct\" and easiest way\nJust call the IT guy of your company that set up your computer and ask him for the password he has set.\nIf he tells you that no password is set (you can also try this before/instead of calling him/her), you're probably suffering from a bug (?) in the lock screen that always asks for a password, even if there is none. So click on the gear symbol in the panel (bar on top of the screen, symbol in the right corner usually) and select \"Switch user...\" or something similar. That way, you leave the lock screen and get to the greeter which recognizes whether somebody has a password or not and does accept logging in without a password, if there is none set.\nOption 2: The \"hacky\" way\nWhen you have physical access to the machine, you can log into a root terminal in recovery mode without password and set a new password without knowing the old one for your account.\nTherefore, you do as detailedly advised in this answer, or summarized below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and enter the GRUB menu. If you're not dual-booting with another OS, it's probably hidden. Holding Shift during boot (it has to appear after the BIOS/UEFI prompt and before Ubuntu starts to load, so press and hold it better too early than too late) should display it though.\n\n*From the given options, select the one with the highest kernel version number (if there are many) and the additional phrase (recovery mode).\n\n*You'll see another menu, where you please select the option \nroot - Drop to root shell prompt\n\n\n*You should be located in a \"full-screen terminal\" now and logged in as root (super user) now. This should look like:\nroot@YOURHOSTNAME:~# \n\n\n*First, we need to remount the hard disk now, as we only have read access at the moment, but we need to write. Do this with:\nmount -rw -o remount /\n\n\n*Now you can set the password for the user YOURUSERNAME with the command:\npasswd YOURUSERNAME\n\nIt asks you type in a password twice (without displaying any character on the screen, you type blindly!) and then tells you it was successful, if you typed it correctly twice.\n\n*You successfully have overwritten your user's unknown password with a new one. Restart the machine normally with:\nreboot\n\n\n*On the normal greeter screen, log in with your new password (except if automatic login is still enabled, then you don't have to enter it).\nCongratulations! You successfully hacked your password! ;-D\n", "Q: Opengl Mesa : use opengl 4.0 I'm an opengl programmer, and I would like to use opengl 4.0; problem is that I cannot install any proprietary drivers, and when I type : glxinfo | grep \"OpenGL version\" in the terminal, it outputs me :\nOpenGL version string: 3.0 Mesa 10.5.2\nOpenGL shading language version string: 1.30\nOpenGL context flags: (none)\n\nCan anyone tell me how I could update mesa to 4.x+ ? \nEDit : \nlspci -k | grep -EA2 'VGA|3D'\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n    Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device 1972\n    Kernel driver in use: i915\n\n\nA: OpenGL 4.0 is not supported in Linux for Intel graphics adapters yet.\n4.1 should be supported by Mesa 11.0, that planned to be released in September 2015.\n", "Q: E:The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/gpgv could not be found Anytime I go to update and/or upgrade, apt-get returns the error below:\nFailed to download repository information\nE:The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/gpgv could not be found.\n\nRunning: 12.04 (precise) 32bit, kernel 3.5.0-18-generic, gnome 3.4.2\non an amd athlon 7850 dual core with 4GB RAM.\n\nOutput for ls -l:\nroot@nerve:/# ls -l /usr/lib/apt/methods/\ntotal 368\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 18112 Oct 30  2014 bzip2\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 30452 Oct 30  2014 cdrom\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 18044 Oct 30  2014 copy\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 55316 Oct 30  2014 ftp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 18052 Oct 30  2014 gzip\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 67632 Oct 30  2014 http\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 34604 Oct 30  2014 https\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     5 Oct 30  2014 lzma -> bzip2\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 88256 Oct 30  2014 mirror\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 26376 Oct 30  2014 rsh\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     3 Oct 30  2014 ssh -> rsh\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     5 Oct 30  2014 xz -> bzip2\n\nOutput for locate gpgv:\nroot@nerve:/# locate gpgv\n/usr/bin/gpgv\n/usr/lib/apt/methods/gpgv\n/usr/share/doc/gpgv\n/usr/share/doc/gpgv/changelog.Debian.gz\n/usr/share/doc/gpgv/copyright\n/usr/share/man/man1/gpgv.1.gz\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/gpgv.list\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/gpgv.md5sums\n\nPlease help.

I need some tools to encrypt my directory with passphrase and easily open it with passphrase again\n\nA: If your really just want to encrypt a directory, use encfs.  You need a 2nd folder which is where you will work out of.  In the 2nd folder, everything appears unencrypted while it is mounted.\nFrom the encfs manpage:\nencfs ~/.crypt ~/crypt\n\nThe first time you will setup the password.  Thereafter, you use the same command to unlock it.\nFiles stored in ~/crypt appear normal, but will actually be stored encrypted in ~/.crypt, which is hidden because of the file name starting with a dot.  You can use whatever folder names you want, of course.\nAlternatively, when installing Ubuntu you do have the option to encrypt the entire disk or to encrypt your home folder.  It is also possible to format external drives fully encrypted.  encfs is best if you really just want to encrypt a folder, or if you want to encrypt files on an NTFS drive or network drive.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 fn keys starts to work after resume from sleep I have a problem with Ubuntu 14.04.

Just right click on the background beside the tabs, or just above the URL bar, then select the checkbox by 'Menu Bar'.\nMenus are a great way to layout features simply, I have no idea why so many programs are getting rid of them. At least firefox hasn't taken the awful step to one of those atrocious ribbon toolbars.\n\nA: It might be just a setting, but I use Firefox 39.0 and it has the default menu inside the title bar (or Unity panel), as most windows in Unity do.\nMaybe you are in full-screen mode? Press F11 to toggle full-screen/windowed mode.\nYou can also try if it helps to disable Unity-style menus and use the default menu line. For that, enter about:config as URL, confirm the security warning and search for the key ui.use_unity_menubar. If you set it to false, Firefox uses an extra menu line instead of embedding the menu bar into the title bar or the panel, depending on your Unity setting.\n", "Q: Dual Boot Ubuntu 14.04 very slow Wifi I have HP pavillion-g6 laptop and I've installed Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS with Windows 7 dual boot.

Thanks \n\nA: The Linux kernel supports software RAID (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID) or even Logical Volume Management (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm) without any cards or extra hardware.\nIt depends what sort of RAID you want to implement, but basically the steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the new drive, and create a new, degraded array (that is only the second disk without the first one)\n\n*copy all contents needed from the first disk to the new array,\n\n*make all necessary changes to boot from the new array,\n\n*reboot,\n\n*verify if everything goes smoothly,\n\n*add the old disk to the array (which destroys the original system, hence the importance of the verification in step 5.)\n\n\nIf you want to implement RAID-0 take care that you need a separate boot partition (/boot) which must be RAID-1 (or no RAID at all).\n", "Q: How to open a window in background without letting it get the focus?

If I disable xdebug in php.ini my local server runs with nginx as expected, so the basic setup is correct.\nIf I activate xdebug in php.ini and request a local page the request hangs as if I had enabled xdebug and set a breakpoint somewhere in my code, but I didn't. Executing php from command line does work interestingly.\nMy current /etc/php5/mods-available/xdebug.ini look like\nzend_extension=xdebug.so\nxdebug.max_nesting_level=1000\nxdebug.remote_enable=1\nxdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1\nxdebug.remote_port=9001\nxdebug.profiler_enable=0\nxdebug.profiler_output_dir = /var/log/xdebug\n\nand is included via symlink both into /etc/php5/cli/conf.d and into /etc/php5/fpm/conf.d. Also checking php -m on command line says that xdebug is included as Zend-Module.\nShifting the port to 9001 is on purpose, since fastcgi is running on port 9000.\nnginx log are fine, xdebug logs don't exist (directory is empty) and fpm logs only saying\nNOTICE: configuration file /etc/php5/fpm/php-fpm.conf test is successful\n\nAny idea what to do or where to have a look?\n\nA: I removed zend_extension=xdebug.so from /etc/php5/mods-available/xdebug.ini and now I am able to access pages again while still useing xdebug?!\nI didn't find any other file where xdebug would be included in any php.ini, so I am a little bit confused.

So, my question is how to install mongodb-dev?\n\nA: You should upgrade to 15.04 as soon as possible as 14.10 has reached its End of Life (EOL) yesterday (23rd July, 2015). \nNote that mongodb-dev is not available in 14.10, your best bet would be to download the .deb file from launchpad and the install it with :\nsudo dpkg -i package_name.deb\n\nThen you need to satisfy the dependency (libboost-dev) with :\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nOtherwise you can use gdebi to do the whole work for you (install gdebi first) :\nsudo gdebi package_name.deb\n\nOr open the .deb file with Ubuntu Software Center which will take care of everything for you.\n\nA: I'll give you the answer just because you asked again after the installation of Ubuntu 15.04\nThe package mongodb-dev is not longer in the Ubuntu Standard Repositories.

And what should I do about them?\nAnd just as an additional note, Steam was running (and I was logged in) during the time that I got these errors. Logging out and fully exiting Steam didn't seam to help though.\n\nOS Information:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\nCodename:   vivid\n\nPackage Information:\n\n\nA: From time to time I can watch that too, but for other repositories. The problem usually resolves itself.\nThe files are easily broken. Maybe they are just re-created on the server and you got an unfavorable situation or any programmer or administrator made a mistake. All people make mistakes.\nIn this case, no reason to be paranoid panda … ;)\n", "Q: Packet redirection based upon traffic type Overview : Is there anything like ufw or iptables that will accept a packet on a port, but then redirect that packet locally depending on the type of packet it is?\nMore info : I have a web server that resides on Ubuntu 14.04 and through NAT on the corporate firewall, accepts public traffic on port 443, the firewall passes the traffic through to my Apache web server (configured to listen on 443) in order to process HTTPS traffic. \nWhat I'm after, however, is also having an SFTP service, on the same server, being able to accept SFTP traffic without having to open up another port on the corporate firewall.\nI envisage reconfiguring Apache to listen locally on port 44433 (for example) and having the SFTP listening on its' standard port 22.  However, what I don't know is what I should have listening on port 443 to accept the traffic through the corporate firewall and then working out if that traffic should be passed to SFTP (if the packet header dictates it as SFTP) or passed to Apache on port 44433 if the packet header dictates it as HTTPS.\nI can only imagine that it would be something like ufw or iptables or some other packet filtering/forwarding/shaping package that I can install under Ubuntu, but I'm not sure what/which one to use. Is this even possible on a single server? \nI understand that there are solutions out there which can redirect traffic based upon the IP port, but all my incoming traffic will be to a single port, and I need to go down a layer and inspect packet itself to ascertain where it needs to be directed.\nUnless of course, there's a better solution?\n\nA: An application called sslh and described as an \"Applicative protocol multiplexer\" was designed to do exactly what you want.\nThe application functionality is described at \nssl/ssh multiplexer\nand it is available through links at that site.\n", "Q: Messy partitions: How do I fix my HDD and SSD partitions from a USB? So after finding out I gave my external HDD 250 MB instead of 250 GB I tried to fix it by changing the partitions around with some popular software. \nTold me to restart my PC.\nNow every time I try to get onto any of my drives I get that famous Kernel panic error.\nI've tried \"Try Ubuntu without install\" and \"Boot-Repair\".\nFirst one still gives me the error and Boot-Repair said it succeeded.\nI'm pretty sure this is because the partition with the boot-flag got the wrong file system. \nI didn't know at the time so I tried to set all partitions on ext2 except the swap.\nI can get to grub rescue and I have boot able USB's at hand.\nMy question is. How do I fix my HDD and SSD partitions from a USB?     \n\nA: By reading my own question I got a new search term were I found my answer. I'm still posting this so people in my situation don't give up on their drives. You can download GParted iso file from Sourceforge (230MB) and use Rufus to \"burn\" it to you're USB. Follow directions here. Boot from the USB and resize the partitions with right file system.\n", "Q: Xorg.conf isn't saving? So I installed the proper Nvidia drivers for my graphics card and modified the screen to a personalized resolution and size because my \"monitor\" isn't actually a monitor and therefore isn't made to fit typical computer resolutions for some reason. \nAnyway, I clicked the \"create xorg.conf\" button or whatever it is and put the file in /etc/X11. However this hasn't seemed to work.\nEverytime I boot my computer in Ubuntu the resolution remains the default one which is off. The only way to fix this if for me to open the Nvidia control panel and manually change the resolution back to what it should be. Why does this keep happening? I suspect that it might have to do with the fact that xorg.conf file's name changes ever so often. It will change to something like xorg.conf.8125408 or some other random number and i'm not sure why. Does anyone know of a fix?\nI have tried search for answers but all I find are questions as to where the xorg.conf file is and not my exact problem.\n\nA: It's maybe related to the GPU manager. It should be mentionned in the log file /var/log/gpu-manager.log.\nIf so, try commenting out the first 4 lines of the file /etc/init/gpu-manager.conf.\n#start on (starting lightdm\n#          or starting kdm\n#          or starting xdm\n#          or starting lxdm)\ntask\nexec gpu-manager --log /var/log/gpu-manager.log\n\n\nA: What about saving it in /usr/share/X11/ ? I know I have to save config files there instead of /etc/X11 on my system for certain configs.\n", "Q: How to change Date & Time format with Lubuntu I'm working with Lubuntu.\nThe system information says: \nRelease: Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid)\nGNOME: 3.14.1\nKernel: 3.19.0-23-generic\nMy problem is about I've been reading all the questions about this issue and I tried all the \"solutions\", BUT...

Could someone please elaborate for a total noob, please. Thanks!\n\nA: \nA virtual package is a generic name that applies to any one of a group\nof packages, all of which provide similar basic functionality. For\nexample, both the tin and trn programs are news readers, and should\ntherefore satisfy any dependency of a program that required a news\nreader on a system, in order to work or to be useful. They are\ntherefore both said to provide the \"virtual package\" called\nnews-reader.\nSimilarly, smail and sendmail both provide the functionality of a mail\ntransport agent. They are therefore said to provide the virtual\npackage, \"mail transport agent\". If either one is installed, then any\nprogram depending on the installation of a mail-transport-agent will\nbe satisfied by the existence of this virtual package.\nDebian provides a mechanism so that, if more than one package which\nprovide the same virtual package is installed on a system, then system\nadministrators can set one as the preferred package.Debian Manuals\n\n", "Q: Putting Ubuntu on an SSD and Files on an HDD I am installing Ubuntu on a home theater PC.

See Installing Broadcom Wireless Drivers.\n", "Q: Access wired network camera(s) through a switch without disconnecting from wireless internet Here is an image of the network I'm setting up:\n\nThis network sort of works when \"Computer\" is running OS X; I can access \"Network camera\" (an Axis M1011) at its default address 192.168.0.90 and set a new IP address (e.g. 10.0.0.12) through the camera's browser interface only when Wi-Fi is turned off. I can also view the camera's video feed, etc. When Wi-Fi is turned on, I cannot reach \"Network camera\" at the address I set. (This at least confirms that everything on the switch is working, and that I can configure \"Network camera\" if need be.)\n\nRelevant documentation:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.axis.com/files/manuals/ig_assign_ip_51375_en_1304.pdf\n\n*http://www.axis.com/ae/en/products/axis-m1011/support-and-documentation\nI'm setting up this system for a robotics application, and I need \"Computer\" to run Ubuntu 14.04. However, when I plug \"Switch\" into \"Computer\" Ubuntu tries to connect to \"Wired connection 2\" (or \"Wired connection 1\" if I plug the Ethernet cable into the other motherboard Ethernet port), eventually disconnecting.\nHere is the output of ifconfig after setting everything up as pictured:\n\nAn here is the output of route and route -n:\n\nI've tried the following link:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://aleksz-programming.blogspot.in/2013/01/using-wifi-and-network-cable-at-same.html\n\n*(Referenced from: https://askubuntu.com/a/639425/432882)\n\n\nHowever, it seems that I have to solve the problem of getting Ubuntu to actually connect through \"Switch\" first, since it isn't even showing up in route and Ubuntu disconnects from \"Wired connection 2\" after a short time (and periodically tries to reconnect).\nAt the very least, I would like to reproduce with Ubuntu the situation on OS X, where I can access \"Network camera\" if I disconnect from WiFi. Ideally, I would like to be able to access the internet wirelessly and the network cameras on the switch without having to disable one of the connections.\n\nA: I arrived at a solution after watching the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqJ9PXhqOAQ\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Network Connections, e.g. by clicking on the network icon at the upper right and choosing \"Edit Connections...\"\n\n*Select the \"Wired connection #\" corresponding to the Ethernet port that will be connected to the switch. Choose \"Edit...\"\n\n*Under the IPv4 Settings tab, change the Method drop-down from \"Automatic (DHCP)\" to \"Disabled\"\n\n*Choose \"Save...\" A duplicate connection may appear in the list; choose \"Close\" and re-open Network Connections, and the duplicate will be gone (the duplicate item is a bug)\n\n*Choose \"Add\", select \"Ethernet\", and choose \"Create...\"\n\n*Type any name, e.g. \"Cameras switch\"\n\n*Under the IPv4 Settings tab, change the Method drop-down to \"Manual\"\n\n*Choose \"Add\" next to Addresses, and set Address to some value (e.g. 10.0.0.9) and Netmask to 255.255.255.0; leave Gateway blank. The address is for the Ubuntu computer, so it should be different from the camera addresses.\n\n*Fill the DNS servers field with some address, e.g. 10.0.0.10\n\n*Choose \"Save...\" and \"Close\"\n\n\nPlug the switch into the Ethernet port. The \"Cameras switch\" connection should connect automatically. Now the network camera browser interface can be accessed at its IP address. Using ping followed by the camera's IP address in Terminal should also be successful. Additionally, connecting to the wireless network allows access to the internet (e.g. www.wikipedia.org) in addition to the network camera at its IP address.\n(Everything works acceptably now, but if anyone could explain in the comments the Default router field in the Axis camera TCP/IP browser settings (see the second image in the question text) or the DNS servers field under the IPv4 Settings tab when creating a manual Ethernet connection I'd be grateful. I'm not sure what role those addresses play.)\nNote that everything can be undone relatively easily by deleting the \"Cameras switch\" connection and setting \"Wired connection #\" from \"Disabled\" back to \"Automatic (DHCP)\"\n", "Q: Why are swap partitions discouraged on SSD drives, are they harmful? I often read that one should not place swap partitions on a SSD drive, as this may harm the device. Is this true? Can you please explain the reason to me?\nBecause I otherwise would have thought that placing swap on an SSD is the best choice, as it's much faster than HDDs and therefore swapping RAM contents to the SSD is not as slow as it would be with the HDD...\n\nA: HDD technology uses a magnetic process for data manipulation and storage. This process is noninvasive, meaning you can pretty much manipulate data on a disk drive infinitely. That is until the mechanics start to fail. In contrast SSD technology does not run the risk of mechanical failure. But what is a concern is how it stores its data. For data storage SSDs use controlled bursts of electrical energy. The semiconductors that are hit with this electric current slowly wear out from the process as they are used over time. \nThis process has been improved upon through software and hardware updates. Early adapters found that OS's were not programmed to properly store data the way an SSD does. This adversely put the SSD through large amounts of read/write cycles. Also most older BIOSs do not properly recognize an SSD and this caused issues as well. \nThe introduction of UEFI and OS's updates corrected most of the issues that early SSD owners had. Also, as with any production process, SSDs themselves have gotten better at managing and maintaining the degradation of NAND flash drives. \nHowever, it is still a concern that your SSD has a limited amount of read/write cycles before it can no longer store data. Although, that concern is just as marginal as your HDD failing. \nThere's a very in-depth podcast about the subject here if you'd like to read up on the topic further.\n\nA: Life Vs Performance Balance.\nYou bought an SSD for its performance advantages and not simply for increasing battery life right?  So use your SSD for that very purpose, to make your system quicker.\nIf you can afford to add more RAM to reduce *swap I/O then this will clearly increase the life span of your SSD as another performance drain is obviously I/O cycles to swap space on a filesystem. \nAgain like so many aspects of your system configuration it’s often not down to one single rule adoption that fits all.  User needs differ and as such system requirements and thus configuration must differ in order to meet these needs, put simply it boils down to how you configure your system.\nIf you have the space to hold an SSD in addition to your  none SSD drive, then write files that will rarely change to your none SSD drive and keep often accessed files on your SSD drive.\nThis will ensure that …\n[1] - The *trim features will have the resources to perform the necessary steps to evenly use all of the drive. [Benefit = Life]\n[2] -  Your I/O latency will be reduced with the high speed SSD device being used to access an often accessed filesystem. [Benefit = Performance]\nConfigure your temp filesystem to utilise space when required for your particular system needs, if you have enough RAM then consider setting your swappiness level to be less aggressive, this will ensure that…\n[1] - SSD I/O is reduced yet your system will still meet the demands of its user(s). [Benefit = Life]\nDo you really need all off those logs?  Consider what your system is logging and where.\n[1] – SSD I/O is reduced as log file access is reduced. [Benefit = Life & Performance]\nThere are a heap of other aspects to your system configuration that can make a none SSD system perform faster, default system builds have a tough metric to fulfil, pure performance or keeping data safe and secure or a balanced mixture of them all.\nIf you apply the same mentality to what you write and to which device, you can drastically increase both performance and at the same time increase the life span of your SSD.\n*swap - Remember this isn't just used when resources are low, the swappiness configurable for many Linux distro's out of the box by default will park long running processes of low priority further down the performance ladder into swap space)\n*Trim – worth verifying you have it enabled, a good article on what trim is and how it works: http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/TRIM\n\nA: Jan 2021. I use a small, dedicated enterprise grade SSD as a swap drive. These enterprise drives can be bought for as little as $80 for 240GB right now, and are 3D nand with load leveling and other valuable improvements for swap.\nBy using the drive only for swap, you pretty much guarantee it won’t affect your expensive terabyte level data drive should it fail, and you still get the performance of SSD. Estimates for very heavy use are about 2 1/2 years.\n\nA: The accepted answer explains the theory; I'd figure I might add a little real-life data from two of my systems.\nDesktop system\n\n*\n\n*Has a 400GB Intel 750 SSD.\n\n*Has 32iGB of RAM; swap isn't needed often.\n\n*However, it hibernates regularly (say, once a day), requiring a large swap write.\n\n*Has been in use for just over 4 years.\n\n*Runs Debian on ext4, and a swap partition.\n\n*Used to contain a Windows 10 installation for a couple of years, but no longer.\n\n*Has no configuration to spare the SSD (no swappiness tweaking, etc).\n\nAccording to SMART, it has seen 28TiB lifetime writes (19GiB/day). The ext4 filesystem has seen 18TiB lifetime writes (12GiB/day). The remainder is due to swap and the Windows installation.\nAccording to Intels SSD Toolbox, the drive is in excellent health and has about 95% of its lifetime remaining:\n\nNetbook\n\n*\n\n*An Acer Aspire ES1-132, in use for 3 years.\n\n*Has some 60GB MMC SSD.\n\n*Has 4GiB memory, so probably more swap pressure; although system usage tends to be fairly light.\n\n*Rarely hibernates.\n\n*Runs Debian 10 on ext4, with a separate swap partition.\n\n*Has no configuration to spare the SSD (no swappiness tweaking, etc).\n\nI can't seem to obtain the total device writes, but the ext4 filesystem has seen almost exactly 1TiB writes (1GiB/day). According to mmc-utils:\n# mmc extcsd read /dev/mmcblk0 | egrep -i 'life|eol'\neMMC Life Time Estimation A [EXT_CSD_DEVICE_LIFE_TIME_EST_TYP_A]: 0x01\neMMC Life Time Estimation B [EXT_CSD_DEVICE_LIFE_TIME_EST_TYP_B]: 0x01\neMMC Pre EOL information [EXT_CSD_PRE_EOL_INFO]: 0x01\n\nWhich means 0-10% of the SSD's spare blocks have been used, and the drive has \"Normal pre-EOL status\". The way I interpret that, the drive has >90% of its life remaining.\nConclusion\nTwo very different systems, both used for years with swap on an SSD, and both systems are totally fine. Based on the diagnostics, both SSDs have more than 90% of their life left.\nTo be fair, both systems are probably light on swap usage. Systems with a lot more memory pressure will see more swap writes, and therefore also more SSD wear. But for normal desktop use with some occasional light swap usage, I don't see a problem with putting swap on an SSD.\n\nA: Early SSDs had a reputation for failing after fewer writes than HDDs. If the swap was used often, then the SSD may fail sooner. This might be why you heard it could be bad to use an SSD for swap.\nModern SSDs don't have this issue, and they should not fail any faster than a comparable HDD. Placing swap on an SSD will result in better performance than placing it on an HDD due to its faster speeds.\nAdditionally, if your system has enough RAM (likely, if the system is high-end enough to have an SSD), the swap may be used only rarely anyway.\n\nA: Even if you have enough RAM, you might still want to prevent any file copy or search to swap out the applications from RAM. This might be the case on file servers (NAS, SAMBA, FTP) which might be involved in large file operations.\nIn order to do that it's best to set in /etc/sysctl.conf:\nvm.swappiness=1\nvm.vfs_cache_pressure=50\n\nThe first setting prevents disk cache (e.g. doing cp) from swapping out existing apps from RAM. The normal default setting on that is 60. Note that using 0, although more aggressive, has been sometimes reported to generate out-of-memory errors.\nThe second setting prevents file searches (e.g. doing find) from swapping out existing apps from RAM. The normal default setting for that is 100.\nAlthough the author mentioned in reference does not refer explicitly to SSD's, this approach also reduces wear on SSD due to reduced swapping and he also provides example how to test it.\nReference: https://rudd-o.com/linux-and-free-software/tales-from-responsivenessland-why-linux-feels-slow-and-how-to-fix-that\n\nA: Flash RAM cells in SSDs have a limited lifespan. Every write (but not read) cycle (or more accurately every erasure) wears a memory cell, and at some point it will stop working.\nThe amount of erase cycles a cell can survive is highly variable, and flash from modern SSDs will survive many more than flash from SSDs made several years ago. Additionally, the SSD intelligent firmware will ensure evenly distributed erasures between all the cells. In most drives, unused areas will also be available to backup damaged cells and to delay aging.\nTo have a value we can use to compare the endurance of a SSD, we can use lifespan measures such as the JEDEC published standards. A widely available value for endurance is TBW (TeraBytes Written, or alternatively total bytes written) which is the amount of bytes writeable before the drive fails. Modern SSDs can score as low as 20 TB for a consumer product but can score over 20,000 TB in an enterprise-level SSD.\nHaving said that, both the lifespan and the use of a SSD for swapping depends on several factors...\nSystems with plenty of RAM\nOn a system with plenty of RAM and few memory consuming applications we will almost never swap. It is merely a safety measure to prevent data loss in case an application ate up all our RAM. In this case, the wearing of a SSD from swapping will not be an issue. However, having this mostly-unused swap partition on a conventional hard drive will not lead to any performance drop, so we can safely put our swap partition (or file) on that significantly cheaper hard drive and use the space on our SSD for something more useful.\nSystems with little RAM\nThings are different on a system where RAM is sparse and cannot be upgraded. In this case, swapping may indeed occur more often, especially when we run memory-intensive applications. In these systems, a swap partition or file on a SSD may lead to a dramatic performance improvement at the cost of a somewhat shorter SSD lifespan. This decreased lifespan may, however, still not be short enough to warrant concern. In all likelihood, the SSD may be replaced long before it would've died because several times the storage may be available at a fraction of today's prices.\nHibernating our system\nWaking from hibernation is indeed very fast from a SSD. If we're lucky and our system survives a hibernation without issues, we can consider using an SSD for that. It will wear the SSD more than just booting from it would, but we may feel it's worth it.\nBut booting from an SSD may not take much longer than waking from hibernation from an SSD, and it will wear the SSD far less. Personally, I don't hibernate my system at all - I suspend to RAM or quickly boot from my SSD.\nThe SSD is the only drive we have\nWe don't really have a choice in this case. We don't want to run without a swap, so we have to put it on the SSD. We may, however, want to have a smaller swap file or partition if we don't plan to hibernate our system at any point.\nNote on speed\nSSDs are best at quickly accessing and reading many small files and are superior to conventional hard drives for transferring data from sequentially-read small or medium-sized files. A fast conventional hard drive may still perform better than an SSD at writing (and to a lesser extent reading) large audio or video streams or other long unfragmented files. Older SSDs may have their performance decline over time or after they are fairly full.\n", "Q: How to insert data from text to mysql? I get this text from router via ssh.

This may not be a \"solution\" but it is a pretty good work-around.\n\nA: Install Boot-repair and repair your grub\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n", "Q: Error building a VM My system:\n#uname -a\nLinux hostname 3.13.0-57-generic #95-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jun 19 09:28:15 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI am trying build a VM ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/CreateGuests ) with this command:\n#ubuntu-vm-builder kvm trusty --libvirt qemu:///system\n\nBut in the end it fails with this error:\nUnpacking linux-image-virtual (3.13.0.58.65) ...\n, stderr: grep: /proc/cpuinfo: No such file or directory\n**This kernel does not support a non-PAE CPU.**\ndpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-image-3.13.0-58-generic_3.13.0-58.97_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n subprocess new pre-installation script returned error exit status 1\nExamining /etc/kernel/postrm.d .\nrun-parts: executing /etc/kernel/postrm.d/initramfs-tools 3.13.0-58-generic /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-58-generic\nrun-parts: executing /etc/kernel/postrm.d/zz-update-grub 3.13.0-58-generic /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-58-generic\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-image-3.13.0-58-generic_3.13.0-58.97_amd64.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nLooks like I do have a PAE CPU...\n #grep -i PAE /proc/cpuinfo\n flags      : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36\n\nI want to build and host KVM VMs on this server.

What I would recommend is booting into Recovery mode using GRUB, and reverting to the last version, and setting display settings to original, also make sure your display manager is up to date.

How can I have them be saved \nin .txt format? (I need to parse part of the numerical contents of these pages, so I don't care about losing the banners/images)\n\nA: If you want to parse your downloaded HTML files, you can filter them through something like html2text (you have to install the package 'html2text'). \nThis might be helpful if you want to get rid of the formatting in the .html documents, however, parsing the original .html or the new .txt files is pretty much the same thing.\n\nA: .html files are text files. The file extension makes absolutely no difference.\nAll files contain some form of binary in the end, and many files contain text in the end. HTML files are simply composed of the HTML markup as text, which is then parsed by the browser to show what the HTML describes.\nIf you want to view it as text, use a dedicated text editor and open the HTML files. Or, from your file browser, select \"Open as\", \"Open with\", or similar.\n", "Q: Run html2text on all files in a directory that do not have an extention I have a directory filled with many files with no extensions that were put there by a call to wget. \nI want to use html2text to convert all these files to plain text files.\nIn other words, how to run this command\nhtml2text listbaba=A > listbaba=A.txt\n\nbut not just on listbaba=A but all files in the current directory with no extensions. On the internet, one finds this example:\n for file in *.html; do html2text \"$file\" > \"$file.txt\"; done \n\nbut the question is by what must I replace \"*.html\" to do it for all files with no extentions~\n\nA: You can negate the globbing pattern:\nfor f in !(*.*); do html2text \"$f\" > \"$f.txt\"; done\n\nThis, differently from using find in for f in \"$(find [...])\"; do [...]; done (or by running find in a subshell using backticks), won't break on filenames containing newlines (and, FWIW, avoids forking a subshell and running another process).\nFor this to work you'll need the extglob option of bash to be turned on in your current bash instance; however extglob should be on by default:\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ shopt extglob\nextglob         on\n\nIf extglob is off, you can turn it on by running:\nshopt -s extglob\n\nand turn it off again by running:\nshopt -u extglob\n\nAn example using echo:\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ tree\n.\n├── file1\n├── file1.html\n├── file2\n├── file2.html\n├── file3\n└── file3.html\n\n0 directories, 6 files\nuser@debian:~/tmp$ for f in !(*.*); do echo \"$f\"; done\nfile1\nfile2\nfile3\n\n\nA: You can use a not flag in a find command and iterate over that output.\nFind files that do not have an extension, or more specific, files that do not have a dot in their name:\nfind . -type f -not -name \"*.*\"\n\nIterate over these files and call html2text:\nfor file in `find . -type f -not -name \"*.*\"`; do html2text \"$file\" > \"$file.txt\"; done\n\n", "Q: Copying RAID 5 hard drives In 2008 or 2009, I put together a server that had four 200GB disks in RAID 5. The server doesn't work any more, but I still have the disks.\nI can't easily put all of the disks into my current system at the same time, but I could put them in one at a time.\nIs it possible to copy their contents to another drive, as a file or as a partition, and then reassemble the array from the four copied drives?\nAlso, I am not sure what file system I used on the array. It was probably ext3 or ext4. Can I non-destructively probe for the file system once the array is assembled?\nI assume the order that the drives / files are listed in the mdadm command wouldn't matter?\n\nA: You can copy the disks with the dd command into files (or partitions which might even be better): take care to copy each disk as a whole (and not only some partitions of them).\nYou can assemble with mdadm the new files or partitions as you suggest. I think you are right: their order should not count.\nTrying to mount partitions with another file system does not ruin them (it simply won't work).\n", "Q: How to add dropbox to file selection dialog box I use dropbox very often and I have it installed in both windows and ubuntu.In windows,a shortcut to the dropbox folder is added automatically to the left panel of file/folder selection dialog box.\nNow,how do I add this to ubuntu?I am running 15.04 btw.\n\nA: Thanks for asking the question; it made me realize I didn't have dropbox bookmarked on this system.  \nOpen dropbax (the folder in Ubuntu).  In the top right corner you will see what I call the I/O gear.  Below that is another gear.  Hover over it and it will announce itself as \"Location options.\"  \nLeft-clicking on that gear will open a menu.  One of the items will be \"Bookmark this location\" about 2/3 of the way down.

(Arch linux, at least.)\nRun HDA Analyzer:\npython run.py\nInside HDA Analyzer, look under card 1.\nChanges to node 0x17:\nUntick Val[0]: Mute\nTick Out under Widget Control.\nChanges to node 0x1a\nSet VREF under Widget control to 100 instead of hiz.\nQuit hda_analyzer.\nRun these two hda-verb commands, again as root:\nhda-verb /dev/snd/hwC1D0 0x17 SET_POWER 0x0\nhda-verb /dev/snd/hwC1D0 0x1a SET_POWER 0x0\n\nStart hda_analyzer again.\nIncrease the output volume of node 0x3 (AUD_OUT) on card 1:\nIn HDA Analyzer under Output amplifier push the Val[0] and Val[1] sliders towards the right. They may need to be almost all the way over to the right before you can hear the difference.\nHere's a low frequency audio file you can use for testing.\nYou can test it by plugging something into the headphone plug, as the subwoofer is unaffected by that being plugged in unlike the normal speakers, at least after the above is changed. That problem is unfortunately not solved by the shell script either.\n\nA: Try setting lfe-crossover-freq = 0 in /etc/pulse/daemon.conf\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server minimal package What is the best why to install an Ubuntu Server image with the minimum possible of package ( no default, no extrat ) that can only allow ssh connection to it and nothing else.\n\nA: Perhaps the Ubuntu \"Minimal CD\", aka the \"minimal ISO image\", is close enough to what you are looking for.\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Installation/MinimalCD\": http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\nAfter doing a minimal install, I think there's only one more thing you need to do to allow ssh connection:\nThe Ubuntu Server Guide says (in the OpenSSH Server section) that\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nallows people to ssh to your server.\nYou'll probably also want to to the other things suggested at How do I configure a new Ubuntu installation to accept ssh connections? .\nEDIT:\nIf on one machine one installs the \"Minimal CD\", and then runs\nsudo tasksel install server\n\nand on another machine one installs the \"Ubuntu Server CD\",\nmy understanding is that the two machines are practically the same.\nIf you know what the difference is between them, please post that difference to\nIs using Ubuntu Minimal any different from Server?\n.\nSee What does the \"Basic Ubuntu Server\" package contain in software selection during installation?\nfor more details.\n", "Q: Windows Media Player 11 + 12, with Wine I am running Ubuntu 15.04. Recently I bought GTA5, and want to play it. I got the .exe and tried to install it using PlayOnLinux but it said I needed the Windows Media Pack. \nThe answer I received said to change my Wine Config to Windows Vista+, Then I could install WMP (Windows Media Player) 11 + 12, which is what I'd need. The only problem is, wine, even after changing the config to Windows 8, cannot find WMP 11 or 12, only 10. 10 Not being good enough, I've hit a dead end. How should I proceed?\n\nA: To install WMP11, you'll need 'cabextract' and the WMP11 installer. Also make sure your wine version is set to XP.\nsudo apt-get install cabextract\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type:\ncabextract \"/location/to/WMP11/installer.exe\" -d $HOME/WMP11\n\n(Obviously, you'll have to write the real path/location to WMP11 file)  \n\n*Change to the new created dir:\ncd $HOME/WMP11\n\n\n*Install WMP11 codecs:\nwine wmfdist11  \n\n(You'll have to press Ctrl+C (on terminal) after it finishes installing)\nwine wmp11\n\n(Also press Ctrl+C after it finishes)\n\n*Set Wine version to 2003 and run WMP11 \nIt will pass the genuine check but it will crash. You'll have to kill the process (open the 'System Monitor' and kill setup_wm.exe)\n\n*Run WMP11 again and click continue.\nNow WMP11 starts, although you can barely see it. To fix it click on 'File', press right and select 'Mask Mode'.\nThere you go. WMP11 is installed and running.\nreference here\nBut according to Wine HQ windows media player is rated as garbage\nFor further reference here\n\nA: I might be missing something, but you should be able to install those through winetricks\nI can never keep track of exactly which windows components are most common, so I've bookmarked this page.

I just want to run a simple script after the user has logged in.\nHere are my attempts:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have tried putting the script in /etc/init.d/ and making a symlink in /etc/rc0.d.\n\n*I tried scheduling it using the @reboot in crontab (crontab -e). Annoyingly, @reboot does not seem to work in Ubuntu(?). I tried this simple line@reboot echo \"hi there\" to no avail.\n\n*I tried putting it into the root's crontab(sudo crontab -e) but still nothing happened. Also a simple echo in this crontab does not work too.\n\n*I also tried to use the @reboot syntax suggested here (@reboot root /home/me/Desktop/script.sh)\n\n*Followed this and placed the path of the script in /etc/rc.local\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using Ubuntu 14.04\n\n*home is mounted, but I also tried my attempts in a VM where home is not mounted\n\n*I only want to run the script after the user has logged in\n\n*Nothing fancy about the script it just echoes \"hello world\"\n\n\nA: The standard location for a script that must run at login is /etc/profile. It will then run for every user (once) when they log in. The user never gets to see the output of the script, it is logged \nIf it is only for a specific user, it should be added to .profile in their home directory.\nWith login I mean when you enter your username and password.\nAny errors normally show up in ~/.xsession-errors\nIf it has to run every time you open a terminal window, it should be added to /etc/bash.bashrc or to .bashrc in the user's home directory.\nAt work, I mount a number of network shares when I log in. This is done in .profile in my home directory (it needs only to be done once).\nEvery time I open a terminal window I get a fortune cookie. This happens because the last line in .bashrc in my home directory contains fortune. \n", "Q: Ubuntu/14.04 / Apache2 configuration issues?

It is sometimes, on some distros, even set up to be available via network request and is usually pretty unprotected permission wise unless you have encrypted your home folder if you want my personal advice, I would either create a new folder in / (root) or a new partition with gparted or another partition editor for that kind of use.\n\nA: On several systems around here, it's become a tradition for each user to create a folder named \"public\" in their own home folder.\nI.e., my home directory is \"/home/dc/\", and I have a public folder at \"/home/dc/public\".\nThat public folder and all the files in it is world-readable.\nAlso, the world execute bit is set on the \"/home/dc/\" and \"/home/dc/public/\" folders to allow everyone to get a listing of all the files in the public folder and read all those files (but not change any of them).\nIn particular, when people on the local network use their favorite browser to view\nhttp://pooh.local/~dc/\nthey get a listing of all the files in my \"~/public\" folder,\nand they can click on any of them to view or download it.\nI hear rumors that people in distant lands use the names \"public_html/\" or \"www/\" for their public folder,\nor make a single \"/home/public/\" folder per machine that all users on that machine share.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*What purpose does the Public folder serve\n\n*Why can other users see the files in my home folder?\n\n*Where's the best place to share files from?\n\n*\"The Unofficial Ubuntu Starter Guide\"\n\n*\"How can I make a public HTML folder in Ubuntu?\"\n\n*Apache Per-user web directories\n", "Q: antivirus update through terminal Trying again in 5 secs...\nClamAV update process started at Sat Jul 25 08:21:14 2015\nWARNING: Can't query current.cvd.clamav.net\nWARNING: Invalid DNS reply.

I love Ubuntu, and I love the Unity desktop environment. But sometimes I just need to do something fast and I don't need the extra flash of Unity, or I just want a different look and feel for awhile. So in the past on Ubuntu I have tried installing LXDE or XFCE for any number of reasons through the commands:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nand...\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nrespectively. Afterward I would come to find that odd changes had been made to Ubuntu that I had not wanted: such as Plymouth changing from the standard Ubuntu logo to the Xubuntu/Lubuntu logo. I am aware that you can manually change this back; but my concern is that other things/settings might also be getting changed or added in the process.\nSo my main question is if there is some method of installing LXDE or XFCE, with only the absolute most necessary changes or additions to Ubuntu. \n\nA: Both LXDE and XFCE (LXDE, XFCE) are in the universe repository.\nSo you can just install either of the two in place of the correspondent full environment:\nsudo apt-get install lxde\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\n", "Q: history erase shell script not working I am creating shelll script that is erase history of commands in the terminal.

I changed file to be executable\nchmod +x foo.sh\n\n3. I run the script\n./foo.sh\n\nbut the script is not working & not erasing my history of commands. Why?\nUpdate:\nI alternatively write a script to clear the history. still same problem occurs.\nMy alternative script is,\n#!/bin/bash\n# Bash Shell store history in the file ~/.bashrc\nrm -r ~/.bash_history\n\nThis is also not clear history of commands.\n\nA: *\n\n*rm -f ~/.bash_history (don't use -r!) will remove the history log, which in the default configuration of most distros is read when you start a new shell. Doing this will therefore only affect shells that you start after running this command. You can replace your current shell with another one by running exec \"$SHELL\" to avoid creating a new terminal window.\n\n*history -c clears the history for the current shell, and does not delete ~/.bash_history. But when you run a script the current shell creates a new shell to run the script in and exits that shell when the script is done. Instead, to execute a script in the current shell you have to source the script. In your case, try running . foo.sh.\n\n\nA: I you want to \"clear our traces\" after you exit the shell you might want to run these commands from your logout script, that is the ~/.bash_logout file. \nMaybe you do not want at all your history of commands to be saved, in this case you can set HISTFILESIZE=0 (in your ~/.profile file or in the shell you are using).\nSee also: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=920530\n", "Q: error while downloading softwares i am using the Ubuntu version 15.04.

Typing clear into a shell creates a bunch of new lines until the output history above is all but hidden. Is there a command or method that does the opposite of clear? That essentially moves your current line you are editting to the middle or bottom of the screen, displaying the latest history of your shell above it?\nThe backstory to this, is that I am trying to map a key in bash/zsh's vi-mode to display previous history or previous output, but without losing the current command I am editting. \n\nA: Navigating the output history is not the job of the shell (Bash/ZSH); they don't keep a record of the output the commands within them have produced. Output history is handled by the terminal, which today is typically either GNOME Terminal or xterm. Both of these support at least these shortcuts, as mentioned by @kos:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shift-Page Up to move at most one $LINES up\n\n*Shift-Page Down to move at most one $LINES down\n\n\nA: In bash you can bind a key to a command and so, for example, list the\ncommand history whilst in the middle of typing a new command.\nAfter the command runs your input line is restored at the point you\nwere originally at.\nEg, give the command\nbind -x '\"\\C-a\": history'\n\nThen controla will dump the history.\nFor permanence add to your ~/.inputc file\n\"\\C-a\": history\n\nYou can replace history by any command. \n\nIn zsh you have a built-in mechanism which pushes the current input buffer\nonto a stack and allows you to give a new command. When it finishes, the\nprevious input buffer is restored.  So you type: escapeq\nhistory return.\nIf you prefer you can setup a zsh widget binding to show the history below the current input buffer you are typing. Eg, for controla again (in your ~/.zshrc):\nzle -N myhistory  \nmyhistory(){zle -M \"$(history)\";}\nbindkey '^a' myhistory\n\n\nTo keep output history you might like to use screen -L which keeps a log\nof all the output in a file, which you can tail with a binding as above. You might want to filter through cat -e or something, as the file includes\nall terminal escape sequences.\n", "Q: How to make rsync show system time after each file transfer? Verbose option allows me to see each file that is transferred, I use options like --stats and --info=progress2 to show me some more information on transfer process. \nI want to figure out how to show system time after each file transfer, because sometimes when rsync fails because of tunnel failure, it freezes without notice and it looks like it is still transferring - process is not killed, but if system time would be shown on the screen, not only I could try debugging the problem easily, but also I would notice that something is wrong just by seeing timestamps on the shell screen. \n\nA: The manual page of rsync tells that you can customize the log format. The %t tag means the current system date-time. For instance you can add the following switch to rsync:\n\n--log-file-format=\"%t [%p] %o %h [%a] %m (%u) %f %l\" \n\nMore information in the manual pages\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/rsync.1.html (log-file-format) and\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man5/rsyncd.conf.5.html (log formatting tags).\n\nA: From man pages: --out-format=FORMAT     output updates using the specified FORMAT\nTo show output on the screen, not in the log, I found --out-format=\"%t %f\" to be working to my satisfaction.\n\nlemonslice's first suggestion --log-file also outputted everything in the desired format, it looks like undocumented alias of --out-format, however --log-file-format does not show on the screen, it is an option for --log-file.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 : \"serious errors were found while checking the disk for / \" and after that Linux hangs very often I have been using dual boot alongside Windows 8.1 from 1 year.

And that's why most directory names from /usr are duplicated here.  \nHere is my question -  I decided to install g++ compiler. So it is a program which will be installed by me (local admin).

Even if it's you, the admin, that installs the package.\n\"installed by the admin\" means installed by hand i.e. without the package manager. This means either by copying files in /usr/local directly or via make install command.\nBut this is just a recommendation and the admin can do whatever she wants and install manually in /usr if she wishes too.

Haven't tried it yet.\n\nA: You can dd only from a device or a file not from a directory.\nAlso this will likely fail because you use MTP. MTP is a layer above the filesystem that expose only files. It's a protocol not a true filesystem.\nBut even with a filesystem this will not work. You need to do that on the device.

I did all the steps as shown Running Docker behind the ufw firewall BUT I could NOT get docker plus UFW to work on 16.04. In other words no matter what I did all docker ports became globally exposed to the internet. Until I found this: How to set Docker 1.12+ to NOT interfere with IPTABLES/FirewallD\nI had to create the file /etc/docker/daemon.json and put the following in: \n{\n    \"iptables\": false\n}\n\nI then issued sudo service docker stop then sudo service docker start FINALLY docker is simply following the appropriate rules in UFW. \nAdditional data: Docker overrules UFW!\n\nA: If you're using the init system of systemd (Ubuntu 15.10 and later) edit the /etc/docker/daemon.json (might need to create it if it does not exist), make sure it has iptables key configured:\n{   \"iptables\" : false }\n\n\nEDIT: this might cause you to lose connection to the internet from inside containers\nIf you have UFW enabled, verify that you can access the internet from inside containers. if not - you must define DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY as ACCEPT on /etc/default/ufw and apply the trick described here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/17498195/507564\n\nA: In my case I've ended up modifying iptables to allow access to Docker only from specific IPs.\nAs per ESala's answer:\n\nIf you use -p flag on containers Docker makes changes directly to iptables, ignoring the ufw.\n\nExample of records added to iptables by Docker\nRouting to 'DOCKER' chain:\n-A PREROUTING -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -j DOCKER\n-A OUTPUT ! -d 127.0.0.0/8 -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -j DOCKER\n\nForwarding packets from 'DOCKER' chain to container:\n-A DOCKER -i docker0 -j RETURN\n-A DOCKER ! -i docker0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 6379 -j DNAT --to-destination 172.17.0.3:6379\n\nYou can modify iptables to allow access to DOCKER chain only from specified source IP (e.g. 1.1.1.1):\n-A PREROUTING -s 1.1.1.1 -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -j DOCKER\n-A OUTPUT -s 1.1.1.1 ! -d 127.0.0.0/8 -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -j DOCKER\n\nYou may want to use iptables-save > /tmp/iptables.conf and iptables-restore < /tmp/iptables.conf to dump, edit, and restore iptables rules.\n\nA: A fast workaround is when running Docker and doing the port mapping. You can always do \ndocker run ...-p 127.0.0.1:<ext pot>:<internal port> ...\n\nto prevent your Docker from being accessed from outside.\n\nA: UPDATE 10.2021\nWhen we use only one port-number then docker will use an ephemeral port\nsee docker-compose ports\n\nSpecify just the container port (an ephemeral host port is chosen for the host port).\n\nI thought that my original answer worked, because I could not connect to the expected port 1234.\nSo please don't do this - follow the advice in the other answers.\nI will not delete this answer, because it might still be useful to someone to understand why not to do this.\noriginal answer\nI used docker-compose to start several containers and also had the problem that one port was exposed to the world ignoring ufw rules.\nThe fix to only make the port available to my docker containers was this change in my docker-compose.yml file:\nports:\n- \"1234:1234\"\n\nto this:\nports:\n- \"1234\"\n\nNow the other docker-containers still can use the port, but I cannot access it from outside.\n\nA: Use of /etc/docker/daemon.json with content\n{\n  \"iptables\": false\n}\n\nmight sound like a solution but it only works until the next reboot. After that you may notice that none of your containers has access to Internet so you can't for example ping any website. It may be undesired behavior.\nSame applies to binding a container to specific IP. You may not want to do that. The ultimate option is to create a container and have it behind UFW not matter what happens and how you create this container, so there's a solution:\nAfter you create /etc/docker/daemon.json file, invoke:\nsed -i -e 's/DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=\"DROP\"/DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=\"ACCEPT\"/g' /etc/default/ufw\nufw reload\n\nso you set up default forward policy in UFW for accept, and use:\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING ! -o docker0 -s 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE\n\nIf you're about to use docker-compose, then the IP from command above should be replaced with IP of network docker-compose creates when running it with docker-compose up.\nI described the problem and solution more comprehensively in this article\nHope it helps!\n\nA: The problem was using the -p flag on containers.\nIt turns out that Docker makes changes directly on your iptables, which are not shown with ufw status.\nPossible solutions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop using the -p flag. Use docker linking or docker networks instead.\n\n*Bind containers locally so they are not exposed outside your machine:\ndocker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 ...\n\n*If you insist on using the -p flag, tell docker not to touch your iptables by disabling them in /etc/docker/daemon.json and restarting:\n{ \"iptables\" : false }\nI recommend option 1 or 2. Beware that option 3 has side-effects, like containers becoming unable to connect to the internet.\n\nA: Use --network=host when you start container so docker will map port to isolated host-only network instead of default bridge network. I see no legal ways to block bridged network. Alternatively you can use custom user-defined network with isolation. \n\nA: *\n\n*Login to your docker console:\n\nsudo docker exec -i -t docker_image_name /bin/bash\n\n\n*And then inside your docker console:\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ufw\nsudo ufw allow 22\n\n\n\n*Add your ufw rules and enable the ufw\n\nsudo ufw enable\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Docker image need to be started with --cap-add=NET_ADMIN\n\n\n\nTo enable \"NET_ADMIN\" Docker option:\n1.Stop Container:\ndocker stop yourcontainer;\n2.Get container id:\ndocker inspect yourcontainer;\n3.Modify hostconfig.json(default docker path:/var/lib/docker, you can change yours)\nvim /var/lib/docker/containers/containerid/hostconfig.json\n\n4.Search \"CapAdd\", and modify null to [\"NET_ADMIN\"];\n....,\"VolumesFrom\":null,\"CapAdd\":[\"NET_ADMIN\"],\"CapDrop\":null,....\n5.Restart docker in host machine;\nservice docker restart;\n6.Start yourconatiner;\ndocker start yourcontainer;\n\nA: An addition to the accepted answer\nIf you map a port like 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 to keep it closed from the Internet, but still want to be able to access it from your working environment (e.g for monitoring/administration/debugging purposes, with IP whitelist or ssh tunnel) there is a \"well-known\" solution for that:\nhttps://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker\n", "Q: Encrypting SD card I have a small capacity SSD drive on my laptop, to compensate I got a 32GB SD card in my laptop which goes in /media/usr/... and I want to store files and stuff on it.

Just install it on your client and server (e.g. apt install mosh) and you are good to go mosh your.server.com.\nAlternatively, or in addition, I'd suggest to look at tmux which allows you to open a session that is kept open with all output and all running processes on connection loss (and on explicit disconnect of course). This allows you to reconnect and continue from where you have been or where the running processes has taken you while being disconnected.\nJust install it on your server (e.g. apt install tmux) and open a new session with tmux.

You should look for something named \"Power Management\" or \"Battery Optimizer\" or \"Battery Saver\" or something similar as the exact location and name changes from BIOS to BIOS and I'm unable to find a manual for your BIOS.\nThere should be a setting that controls the maximum allowed battery charge as a percentage - maybe it somehow got set to a horrible default 0% when you updated.\nI wanted to post this as a comment, but ran out of space. :/\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu be able to replace windows 7 on my pc?

CurrentIy I'm running Windows 7.I heard that Ubuntu is way faster than windows 7. I just do the basics in computer like watching videos, listening songs and surfing web. So should I use Ubuntu instead of windows 7 or stick to windows only. And if Ubuntu is better for me than which version should I use. Thanks.\nPlease reply!!!!\n\nA: While as @solsTiCe's comment that installing Linux or specifically Ubuntu won't give your PC more resources is true, it will however make more efficient use of those resources.\nIf you wish to continue using your PC without upgrading hardware - then that is entirely possible with Ubuntu. It will even arguably work faster than with Windows as your hardware configuration is barely the minimum Win7 supports, while it is roughly twice of Ubuntu's minimum requirement.\nIf you do decide to switch to Ubuntu then here are a few pointers that might help you out further:\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all test Ubuntu as a Live system, see whether you like it.\n\n*If you like it then I'd recommend using a window manager that's easy on resources.While they might not look as \"good\" as other more heavier window managers they do make a fine job out of conserving memory (both on your graphics card and RAM).

This also lets us focus the window without clicking, which could have side effects we don't want.\nNote that in my case, my displays are stacked vertically, so I move the mouse up (theta = 0) or down (theta = 180). I also choose 1080px as the dividing line.\n\nA: this repository may help you\nhttps://github.com/Eitol/screen_focus_changer\nYou place the focus_changer.py left script in a fixed place (/ opt for example) And then add the keybinding / shortcut / hotkey in your settings\npython3 /opt/focus_changer.py left # Focus to left\npython3 /opt/focus_changer.py right # Focus to right\n", "Q: mysql-client-5.5 update error I just run apt-get upgrade and many packets should be updated.

Boot Repair should be able to fix your problem; but some situations tend to confuse it, so it does sometimes fail. I have some more information and suggestions....\nFirst, your /dev/sda5 is set up as a BIOS Boot Partition, which is used for BIOS-mode booting, not EFI-mode booting. Such partitions are normally 1MiB in size, although they can be somewhat bigger or smaller than that -- but a 100MiB BIOS Boot Partition is ridiculously oversized. You can safely delete that partition; but of course that will leave you with 100MiB of wasted space.\nI don't recall offhand exactly what terminology the Ubuntu installer uses for the BIOS Boot Partition. If it uses \"reserved boot space\" as a synonym for the BIOS Boot Partition, then that indicates the installer was running in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, not in EFI mode. That's a recipe for creating problems, given your pre-existing EFI-mode installation of Windows. Such problems can be fixed, but if that's what happened, it's likely to be easiest to delete all your Ubuntu partitions and start again. This time, though, you should go into your firmware and disable any option that enables BIOS-mode booting (aka legacy-mode booting or the Compatibility Support Module [CSM]), or that disables EFI/UEFI-mode booting. As I describe on my Web page on the subject, enabling the CSM creates a more complicated boot process in which more things can go wrong. If you're dual-booting with an existing EFI-mode installation, there's seldom any benefit to be gained from the extra complication, so the usual result is either no effect or negative. (On occasion there is a benefit to enabling the CSM in a dual-boot with an EFI-mode OS, but those situations are becoming increasingly rare.)\nThe Microsoft Reserved partition is used by some Windows partitioning tools as \"scratch space.\" It's ordinarily empty except for temporary storage when those tools are working. For some reason, it's being detected as an ext4fs partition on your system -- chances are you used to have an ext4fs partition that started at this exact spot. This is complicating your installation, although if you used the \"Something Else\" installation option, you could simply ignore it. Instead of deleting the partition, as RobinHood suggests, I recommend you overwrite it with:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2\n\nBe very careful with that command, though, and particularly with the of=/dev/sda2 option. If you mistype the destination partition, you'll overwrite the wrong partition, which could trash your Windows installation. Wiping the partition in this way will enable Windows to use it if/when it wants to, while also preventing it from confusing the Ubuntu installer.\nIf you don't want to re-install Ubuntu, another option you might consider is installing another boot loader. The easiest of these to do is likely to be my own rEFInd:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you haven't already done so, disable Secure Boot in your firmware.\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of rEFInd from its downloads page.\n\n*Prepare a rEFInd boot medium.\n\n*Boot to rEFInd.\n\n*Test that rEFInd can boot Windows. If not, you might reconsider this approach or work to fix it.\n\n*Reboot again into rEFInd, but this time try booting Ubuntu. (rEFInd should show at least one Ubuntu option.)\n\n*If rEFInd boots Ubuntu, install the Debian package or PPA of rEFInd. This should set up rEFInd as the default boot program on your computer.\n\n*If desired, re-enable Secure Boot. If this causes rEFInd to not boot, disable Secure Boot and install a Shim package, as described in the rEFInd documentation. (rEFInd will set itself up to use Shim if it finds a Shim binary, but your system might not have this already.)\n\n\nrEFInd tends to get confused less often than GRUB, although rEFInd isn't well-integrated into Ubuntu and so requires more setup effort, particularly if you want to use Secure Boot. This extra setup effort is likely to be less than the effort required to fix GRUB if GRUB is misbehaving badly, as yours is, hence the suggestion. In your case, though, since you haven't yet done anything with Ubuntu, and since deleting the BIOS Boot Partition will leave 100MiB of wasted disk space, re-installing Ubuntu may be a superior solution than either fixing GRUB or installing rEFInd.\nBeyond this, you'll need to post details from your Boot Repair run if you need more help. (Boot Repair should spit out a URL where it stores details about your system.)\n", "Q: hp laserjet pro mfp m127fw bug?

New to Linux and Ubuntu and prior to making the permanent switch Ive installed the latest version of VirtualBox onto my windows 7 laptop to explore the OS and come accustom to it.\nIve downloaded ubuntu 15.04 from Linux directly and via a torrent linked through their website, and Im experiencing the same issue either way.\nI basically get an error message; \"System prgramme problem detected\" prior to the log in screen loading. The log in screen then appears as if normal but when I log in with the correct details I receive a black screen, then an error message at the top saying; \"System programme prblem detected, do you want to report the problem now?\".\nAll the forums have seemed to get me no-where, when running a check using the command screen it does tell me that there are xsession errors (using command ls -lah) is this a significant possibilty to the problem or is there a better way of diagnosing the problem? Im not computer programming literate but definately capable of getting my head around it and learning all of the required knowledge.\nHope someone can help!\nKind regards\nSkin Back\n\nA: Apparently your Ubuntu installation experiences a crash early at boot, and before you were able to login. This most likely is related to a bug or an incompatibility somewhere. To further find out what causes your virtual machine to crash you may try read the log files from a TTY which I believe you are able to access (press Host + F1).\nMost bugs will get fixed over time. So the steps to take are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade your Virtual Box appliance to the latest version (5.0 at the time of writing this)\n\n*Perform an upgrade of your Ubuntu installation to receive all security updates and bugfixes. From a TTY (or if that fails from a root shell) issue the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo reboot\n\nIf these measures did not help you may try to install the virtual box guest additions, wich can also be done from a TTY or a root shell:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Guest Additions in a VirtualBox VM?\nIn all cases we need the virtualbox to reboot for changes to take effect.\n", "Q: To ignore some files in backup of 16.04? I have some data files of several GBs which I would not like to be included in backups. \nI am using at the moment Deja Dup but later Systemback. \nSystemback is making exact mirror images of the system. \nI can prevent files from desktop search by the suffix .noindex in OSX. \nSomething similar to prevent backups like .nobackup would be great. \nIt would be great to have some sort of blacklist/ignoreList for some specific filenames. \nHow can you ignore files from backup by the two backup systems?\n\nA: I do not recommend to use Deja-dup because it will fail if multiple file-systems and also in many dynamic situations. Just use tar czf for making the backup as described here with an attempt for quality assurance. In tar, use --exclude=$HOME/Music/ etc. Make cron if you need regular backup. \n", "Q: Fan constantly runs on Dell on Ubuntu My laptop configuration are\nDell 3521\nCore i3  3227U @ 1.9Ghz\n4GB RAM\nIntel HD4000 graphic + radeon HD7670m 1GB DDR3 dedicated graphics.\nWhen I boot Ubuntu 14.04.02LTS on my laptop, CPU cooling fan starts to run continuously at max speed making a loud sound while the laptop is in idle state :( and also the air blown out side is not hot, just normal air.

Is it the same special file that is working whenever cat > filename is done?\n\nA: The short answer is No. \nThese are two different techniques of Clearing a text file using cat /dev/null > file and cat > file followed by Ctrl + C.\nRedirection > is used to redirect output to some file. For example date will show the current time and date on std out\n$ date\nSat Jul 25 20:56:09 IST 2015\n\nIf you use,\n$ date>/path/to/file\n\nThen it will redirect stdout to file.\n$ cat /path/to/file\nSat Jul 25 20:56:23 IST 2015\n\nHow cat /dev/null>file clears the content of file \nIt just redirect the content of null device /dev/null to the file. So the contents are overwritten and it becomes empty.\nHow cat > file clears the content of file \ncat Concatenate file(s), or standard input, to standard output. Take the following example,\n$ cat\nsome text          # by user on stdin\nsome text          # stdin to stdout concatenated by cat\nsome other text    # by user on stdin\nsome other text    # stdin to stdout concatenated by cat\n^C                 # Ctrl+C to terminate.\n\nThe command cat > file will wait for stdin and will redirect and overwrite the file. It need to be stopped using Ctrl + C.\nIf you do not enter anything into the stdin and terminate the process with \nSIGINT (Ctrl+C) it will overwrite the file with a blank.\nThe following example is there for more clarification:\n$ cat > file\nsome text\nsome other text\n^C\n$ cat file\nsome text\nsome other text\n\n\nA: No special file has any useful purpose in either case.\ncat /dev/null is exactly a no-op, this command does absolutely nothing of interest and it can be replaced by any command that doesn't output anything.\nYou can for example clear a file's content with any of these commands:\nprintf > filename\ntrue > filename\n: > filename\n\nor even, with many shells, by using no command at all but the redirection:\n> filename\n\nOn the other hand:\ncat > filename\n\nis redirecting stdin, i.e. everything you type on your keyboard, to filename. If you interrupt the cat command before typing anything, the result would also be an empty file but that is a quite inefficient method to do it.\n\nA: No, what is clearing the file is not /dev/null, but the > redirection, which intrinsically truncates the output file itself before redirecting the output of cat.\n\n\n*\n\n*cat /dev/null > filename: you're opening /dev/null and printing its \"content\" (nothing) to stdout; at the same time a file descriptor for filename is opened, the file is truncated and the stdout of cat is redirected to it (hence nothing is actually redirected to the file)\n\n*cat > filename: you're printing nothing to stdout, because you're not specifying a file and you're not even passing stdin (which has the effect of making cat waiting undefinetly); at the same time a file descriptor for filename is opened, the file is truncated and the stdout of cat is redirected to it (hence nothing is actually redirected to the file)\n\n\nThey do exactly the same thing (in terms of clearing the file) but the first opens an extra file descriptor compared to the second and the second will wait undefinetly for something to come into cat's stdin.\nMethods equivalent to the first one (and to the second one result-wise, but without the hassle of the undefinetly waiting cat) would be:\n$ echo -n | cat > file # empty pipe\n$ <emptyfile cat > file # empty file\n$ <<<'' cat > file # empty herestring\n$ <<EOF cat > file\n>EOF # empty heredoc\n\n", "Q: Why doesn't my machine tell me it's memory type?

You are on a really old version of ubuntu, which is why nmcli probably won't work, but i will include it here nevertheless.\n\n\n*\n\n*With nmcli the command would be nmcli networking off.\n\n*With ifdown the command would be ifdown INTERFACE.\n\n\nFor the ifdown command you will have to find out which interface you want to shut down by looking at the output of sudo ifconfig. For your Ethernet Interface it will be something like eth0.\n\nA: There's a variety of ways to do this. More preferred and automated way is to use cron. \nMy choice would be a neat scheduling program called at (not installed by default, you have to get it with sudo apt-get install at ). It allows scheduling commands to be executed at specific time. In your particular case, it would be used as such:\necho \" nmcli  networking off \" | at 6:00\nThe good thing here is that nmcli doesn't require sudo. Downside is that you'd have to run it manually. To automate it, you can add that command as an autostart entry so that it schedules the command each time you log in. There's a variety of ways to do that as well - .desktop files, /etc/rc.local script,etc.\nAnd there's a variety of commands that you can schedule - sudo service network-manager stop, sudo ifconfig wlan0 down , nmcli nm wifi off, etc.\nAlternatively, you can schedule a computer shutdown at specific time with sudo shutdown -P 6:00.  \nNote: in my examples I am using wlan0 option, but if you substitute eth0 , that will operate on wired connection. Make sure to check man pages for nmcli and ifconfig and adapt everything to your networking needs accordingly. \n", "Q: Recover encrypted home directory: login passwd changed, mount passphrase lost I have made an extensive research through the site before submitting a new question, but on one side I'm a huge noob and on the other side non of the previous queries seems to fit my case.\nI'll try to be as precise and concise as possible, hoping someone has a solution for my problem.\nI tried to restore my old Ubuntu partition a few days back. I had an old laptop working with double boot HDD between WinXP and Ubuntu 14.04 in it, but about one year ago I couldn't resist to try Win8 and installed it over the WinXP partition. It obviously screwed up the boot loader but I didn't find the time to do the boot-repair untill now. Problem was that the LOGIN password didn't seem to work anymore. I say 'didn't work' instead of 'was forgotten' because I usually use the same Login password for all my users in all my OSs but the machine didn't accept it anymore.\nAfter trying a list of about 20 variables (I usually use my stickers for inspiration when choosing the login password, i.e. my password should have been intelRceleronRinsideTM or SUSElinuxenterprisedesktop or HPsixhundredthirty or some variarion of those) I thought that the login passwd must had been deleted during the Win8 install [but then again, I'm a huge noob]. So... I changed it from terminal using the passwd command.\nNow, as you might imagine, I can't log in anymore. When I type the right password at the login prompt, the GUI simply refreshes with no further explaination.\nI understand that it might be a quite common problem, but all the other people had the decency to backup the mount passphrase somewhere safe but I, being the HUGE noob that I am, simply put it in a txt file INSIDE the encrypted partition... like locking the key of a safe inside the safe itself.\nI know better now, but I still need to recover the INVALUABLE content of the encrypted folder now and I'm starting to get desperate.\nI tried all the usual steps which are suggested in cases like these, but not knowing the oringinal login password and having the mount passphrase lost, everything was uneffective.\n\nTL;DR:\n  My Home folder is encrypted and I need to recover the content. The original login password has been changed throug 'passwd' command, and the mount passphrase backup is lost.\n\nPLEASE HELP.\nPRETTY PLEASE.\nPS: I can list all the failing methods I tried if necessary.\nPPS: Sorry for bad english.\n\nA: The whole point of encryption is to make it impossible to access data without the passphrase.\nSo there is no way to restore your data if you lost it.\n", "Q: Unable to install QT5 .run file on ubuntu I know that to install .run files, I need to do \nchmod +x qt.run\n./qt.run\n\nBut it seems the ubuntu is not trying or able to run the executable.

The user by default is an administrator but I would like them to only be a standard user. Is there a way to achieve this?\n\nA: I believe oem-config just resets the debconf values for a couple of modules, the interesting one here being d-i passwd, which creates a user account during installation. Since this might be the only account which can login (the root account might be disabled), d-i passwd automatically adds the account to the sudo group, and there isn't an option to override this.\nIt does look like oem-config provides a late-command key which gets ran at the very end of the process, so I believe you could use that to remove any/all users from the sudo group. I haven't tried this myself (I use preseed/kickseed for all my setup), but assuming it works the same as the preseed late_command, you can add a single (logical) line of shell code to be executed. Something like this ran from the terminal before reboot should do the trick:\necho \"set oem-config/late-command sed -i '/^(sudo:x:[0-9]+:).*$/\\1/' /etc/group\" | debconf-communicate\n\n", "Q: Smart lock like on Android?

I was trying to move free space from my ubuntu partiton to my windows partiton, but i got an error message.\nI was trying to follow these instrucitons with a bit of variaton due to a different setup (I had no sda4): Is it possible to move free space from Ubuntu partition to Windows, when Windows is located before Ubuntu?\nIt moved /dev/sda6 (Ubuntu Partition) to the right and shrank it from 135.36 GiB to 48.83 GiB.\nIt moved /dev/sda5 (Linux Swap) to the right\nIt moved /dev/sda3 (extended linux partition?) to the right and shrank it from 150.26 GiB to 63.73 GiB\nHowever, it failed to grow /Dev/sda2 (Windows 7 partition) from 781.15 GiB to 867.68 GiB. It also told me to make sure to send my GParted details, so here you go.\nUpon closer inspection, the details section says that checking the filesystem on /dev/sda2 for errors failed. Is that because Gparted reported that it was unable to read the contents of the Windows 7 file system? Because Gparted did say that it might need ntfsprogs / ntfs-3g, but when I tried to install them from my live cd it said that they were already installed.\n\nA: Chances are you need to repair the Windows 7 disk from within Windows. There are no tools in Ubuntu that can do this job. (The ntfsfix program does only the most basic checks and then flags the partition as needing repair in Windows.) Also, be sure you shut down the computer in Windows; do not perform a suspend-to-disk operation. The latter leaves the filesystem in an inconsistent state, which will prevent GParted from resizing it.\nFinally, you might consider resizing the NTFS partition from Windows; that's likely to be safer than using GParted. NTFS is proprietary, and Linux tools to manipulate NTFS are all reverse-engineered. That doesn't guarantee that Microsoft's tools will be superior, but if I had to place money on it, I'd bet that the Windows NTFS-resizing tools are safer than GParted. Also, GParted is known to be unable to adjust pointers used by Windows boot loaders. If the resize operation happens to change the start point, using GParted will render Windows unbootable. Doing the same with the Windows tools should cause no such problems. Note that the start point might change even if you don't tell the program to make that change. This can happen if your alignment policies don't match those in use when the partition was created.\nOh, and back up. Resizing and moving partitions are inherently dangerous procedures. They work fine most of the time, but a power failure at an inopportune time, a bug, filesystem corruption, or other problems can all result in catastrophic data loss. (\"Catastrophic,\" in this case means \"many hours wasted trying to recover your data, with Murphy's Law guaranteeing that your most important files will end up lost forever.\")\nOne more point: Instead of expanding your existing Windows partition, you might consider creating a new one for data files. This will be safer than creating a new partition, and will have the advantage that you can use it as a shared-data partition, thus eliminating the need to access the main Windows partition from Ubuntu. Such non-Windows access is inherently dangerous and so should be avoided if possible.\n", "Q: Lubuntu / Ubuntu - Unable to connect to wifi network I've been recently looking for information to fix the wifi connection on my Lubuntu machine.\nI got a fresh install of Lubuntu 15.04 on my PC with a TP-LINK 8200ND connected to it.

This is important as the bios will on boot UEFI compatible OSs unless it's in CSM mode.\n\n\n*Change the boot priority to try booting from USB before it tries to boot from HDD or SSD. Otherwise your bios will see the Windows and boot straight to it before checking if there is a USB option.\nCheck this Toshiba Guide for a little more info on how to make these changes if you need.\n\n\n*Ensure that you are actually turning your computer off.

I will try to find a similar thing for Win10.\n\nA: For a dual-boot to work, you need to install ubuntu alongside windows. That means that you should install grub (boot loader) in front of windows.\nYou should first boot from a live cd/usb. After installing ubuntu you should try: \n1. Boot Repair (GUI) - See this post for more info. \n2. From the live cd/usb: \nOpen a terminal and run these commands:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/boot\nsudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/boot  # Example: sudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/boot\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt  # Example: sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX # Example: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\nIf Ubuntu was installed successfully, you will be able to chroot into your real system. \nImportant: All instances of sdX and sdXY must be replaced with the correct drive/partition for your system. (sda, sdb, sda1, sda5, sdb5, etc). X is the drive letter. Y is the partition number. The first drive is \"a\" and the first partition is \"1\". Example: sda1 \nOnly If You Have a Separate /boot partition.\nIf you have a separate /boot partition run these commands. Most users do not have a separate /boot partition and should go to the normal partition section. sdXY is the main partition. sdXZ is the boot partition.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/temp /mnt/temp/boot  \nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/temp  # Mount the main Ubuntu partition. Example: sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/temp\nsudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/temp/boot  # Mount the /boot partition. Example: sudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/temp/boot\n\nOnly If You Are Running WUBI (Ubuntu inside Windows)\nIt is possible to chroot into a Wubi install by first mounting your Windows partition, and then mounting the Windows Wubi file, root.disk. The user must determine the value of the Window partition (sda1, sda2, etc). This section only applies to users booting an Ubuntu OS installed within Windows.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/windows /mnt/temp  # Make the mount points\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/windows  # Mount the Windows partition.

No separate /boot partition, not a Windows/Wubi installation.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/temp \nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/temp  # Example: sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/temp\n\n\nAnd then do (in the chroot environment): \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get purge grub grub-pc grub-common\nsudo apt-get install grub-common grub-pc\nsudo update-grub\nexit\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem on my Acer desktop and Dell laptop.  When I shut-down Windows, I could not boot on Linux or a USB drive.  The problem is that Windows does not actually shut down, but goes into a hibernate mode.  In order to boot to another system, I had to tell Windows to \"reboot\" and press the boot menu key to choose a boot device.

I've read about solutions that replace that file with the grub2 boot loader and chain the Windows boot loader.\n\nA: A workaround would be to make a USB/SD drive that contains grub that boots your Ubuntu install bypassing the windows boot manager. A utility that will help is super Grub2 disk http://www.supergrubdisk.org/super-grub2-disk/\nAlso if your HDD is formatted with GPT it might have an option to select the Ubuntu boot loader when you go into your boot device menu.\n\nA: UPDATE:\nTo resolve this known BOOT issue for intel undi pxe-2.1 (build 083) try the solution by ELECTROMAN1 \notherwise ensure that your network connection / WIFI is disabled before booting \nthen download an Ubuntu iso and create a bootable USB using PenDriveLinux for Windows, refer instructions from the link provided\n", "Q: why is “saned” disabled on boot Ubuntu 14.04?

I figured out that if I changed the Graphics from 'Switchable' to 'Internal' in the BIOS, then the problem went away. Upon further inspection the 'internal card' was an Intel.

When trying to access live broadcast of a football match Adobe Flashplayer crashes and it appears to be caused by the fact that Ubuntu does not support the latest version of Adobe Flashplayer plugin. Is there a way in which I can do this? Or what is the alternative?\n\nA: I will neither talk about the security issues related to using proprietary plugins (that recently proved being faulty in many ways), nor about the ethical implications in it.\nI will just talk about the story, which is not as simple as you write it, and Ubuntu is completely unrelated to it.\nThere are 3 players in the game. Mozilla, Google and Adobe.\nAdobe at some points decides that it will not update the Flash NPAPI plugin for Linux, for reasons that no one else knows, nor has to know.\nThey are a private company, they choose what to develop and what not. Fine.\nGoogle at some point starts developing a new way to integrate plugins in a browser, called PPAPI and abandon after some time the old technology NPAPI, developed by Netscape.\nTogether with what above, this implies also that on Android you could not play Flash contents anymore.\nThis is a bit less fine than before and it piss off a lot of users, coders and companies.\nAt some point in history Adobe and Google start talking and they find a way to develop and mantain a PPAPI version of the latest Flash plugin, that will be packaged directly by Google and embedded into Chrome.\nNow, Mozilla can't/won't use PPAPI technology in Firefox. This, with what is above, implies that the latest Flash plugin from Adobe/Google won't work in Firefox. Fine, there is alwasy the 5-years-old NPAPI plugin from Adobe that we can use.\nUnfortunately this does not include the latest features and it is block by more and more websites everyday (note that Adobe claims that it is secure, as they still provide security updates).\nSo the question now. Is there another browser, apart from Google Chrome, that works on Linux and can take advantage of the latest PPAPI proprietary Flash plugin?\nYes, any browser that supports PPAPI techonology.\nLike? For example the (non completely free) Chromium-browser, on which Google Chrome is based.\nNow, how to take advantage of this latest PPAPI plugin in Chromium?\nFollowing the wiki.\n", "Q: \"ALERT! /dev/mapper/server--vg-root does not exist.

Thinking of replacing Windows and also help regarding AMD Radeon graphics card I recently bought a new Lenovo Y40-80 laptop and it comes with an AMD Radeon R9 M275 graphics card. I know this is not a high-end graphics card. I am not a hardcore gamer, and play only a few games like TF2 and DOTA2.\nNow the query: In Windows, I can easily enable it for a game (DOTA2, etc.) through AMD Catalyst Control Center. What I wanted to know was how can I use my graphics card for an installed game while on Ubuntu? Or is it not possible at all? Because if I decide to go ahead with the scenario that I completely remove Windows, it would be a waste as I won't be able to use the graphics card.\nLooking forward to hearing from the community. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Ubuntu should work OK with this laptop. You can test it first by booting from LiveCD.\nYou can install  Catalyst Control Center and switch adapters in Ubuntu.\nIt is done by running in terminal\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-updates\n\nOr it can be done in GUI\nSystem Settings -> Software & Updates -> Additional Drivers\nBut you will have to switch adapters manually.\nWindows games will not run well on Ubuntu. Some of them will run using wine. But do not expect good performance.\n\nA: You should be able to install AMD Catalyst Control Centre on Ubuntu as well.\nIf you need to download it and update it manually you can use the sudo dpkg --install package_file command in the terminal. \"package_file\" here being the name of the file you are trying to install.\n", "Q: MySql did not install properly and now I can not use the software center or remove MySql When I open the software center I got an error saying\n\"New software cannot be installed, because there is a problem with the software currently installed.

I have just installed Ubuntu on my mom's Chromebook. I've installed Firefox using xterm, why xterm? Because when I search, look on the app thing where bash home is, and press ctrl+alt+t, terminal is not here. I have no clue why but there's no terminal.\n\nA: Open the Dash by clicking on the Ubuntu icon on the upper-left corner of your screen. Then type in \"terminal\". Select the terminal application from the results.\n", "Q: Why does asterisk produce unexpected results in find? I'm new to Bash. From the Finding Files documentation:\n\nYou want to find every file in ~/mydir and all its subdirectories, recursively, with a file extension of .htm (or .HTM or .Htm...) and delete it. I've seen a lot of attempts like rm -rf ~/mydir/*.htm which really don't come close. The correct solution is\nfind ~/mydir -iname '*.htm' -exec rm {} \\;\n\n-iname says that you want to do a case-insensitive search on the filename. '*.htm' is in single quotes to prevent bash from expanding the *, which will produce unexpected results. \n\n\nQuestion: What does asterisk produce with and without the quotes? Why would you decide to use quotes versus not?\n\nA: Without quotes, the shell expands *.htm to a list of files and passes this list to find.  With quotes, the shell provides the five character string *.htm as an argument to find.\nFor example, with quotes:\n$ ls\na.htm  b.htm\n$ echo find . -iname '*.htm'\nfind . -iname *.htm\n$ find . -iname '*.htm'\n./b.htm\n./a.htm\n\nThe above works as desired.  Without quotes, find is given arguments that it does not know how to process:\n$ echo find . -iname *.htm\nfind . -iname a.htm b.htm\n$ find . -iname *.htm\nfind: paths must precede expression: b.htm\nUsage: find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-Olevel] [-D help|tree|search|stat|rates|opt|exec] [path...] [expression]\n\n\nA: How about an example first, here we are looking for all files with .htm extension (case insensitive) recursively :\n$ tree \n.\n├── spam\n│   ├── egg.htm\n│   └── egg.Htm\n├── spam.htm\n└── spam.Htm\n\n\n$ find . -type f -iname *.htm\n./spam.htm\n./spam.Htm\n\n$ find . -type f -iname '*.htm'\n./spam.htm\n./spam/egg.htm\n./spam/egg.Htm\n./spam.Htm\n\nAs you can see in the first case where i have not used any quoting -iname *.htm, the filename has been subjected to glob (*) expansion first (done by shell, before find starts) as i have not used any quote and result in :\nfind . -type f -iname spam.htm spam.Htm\n\ni.e. all files in the current directory having an extension .htm (case insensitive). As a result although ./spam subdirectory has two files with .htm extension but they won't be found as we are now looking for files spam.htm or spam.Htm.\nOn the other hand in the second case find . -type f -iname '*.htm', we have used quoting so the filenames won't be subjected to glob expansion hence we will get the desired result.\n\nA: I believe what you are seeking to understand is a process called Quoting. Quoting works with double quotes and single quotes. \nIf you place text inside double quotes, all special characters used by the shell lose their meaning, except $ (dollar sign), \\ (backslash), and ` (back tick).\nSingle quotes suppress all expansions.\nEscaping Characters are also something to be given attention in such situations. You can precede a character with a \\ (backslash) to turn it into an Escaping Character. This is often done inside double quotes to selectively prevent an expansion.\necho \"This bowl costs \\$10.00\"\nThis bowl costs $10.00\n\nHere $ would be said to be the Escape Character.\n", "Q: connect to encoder via eth0 I have ubuntu 14.04 and\nI am trying to connect to other device(encoder) via eth0.\nEncoder has ip address 239.168.168.55.\nI set my static ip address via network connections.\nIn IPv4 settings I put Method manual:\nAddress 239.168.168.67\nNetmask 255.255.255.0\nGateway 239.168.168.1\n\nI am able to establish connection and paste into console:\nsudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet\n\nThis gave me results as follows:\nInterface: eth0, datalink type: EN10MB (Ethernet)\nStarting arp-scan 1.8.1 with 256 hosts (http://www.nta-                                                                                                                  monitor.com/tools/arp-scan/)\n239.168.168.55  00:0b:78:00:60:01   TAIFATECH INC.\n\nIn next step I tried to put 239.168.168.55 into web browser(chromium) but I get:\nThis webpage is not available\n\nERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT\n\nI try to ping this address:\nping 239.168.168.55\n\nbut I got:\n    connect: Invalid argument\nI tried also nslookup but it gave me timeout.\nI am looking for any tip/ clue how can I manage this connection.\nThanks\n\nA: Try with this data:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 239.168.168.67\ngateway 239.168.168.55\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 239.168.168.0\nbroadcast 239.168.168.255\n\n", "Q: Run script on mount I have an encrypted HDD for which I would like to run a backup script when it is mounted.

that? \nThanks.\n\nA: The problem is in some of your sysctl settings:\nnet.ipv6.conf.wlan1.accept_ra = 1\n\nThis one is fine: accept Router Advertisements\nnet.ipv6.conf.wlan1.accept_ra_defrtr = 0\n\nBut this one tells your system not to accept the default route from the RA. The RA does advertise the router as a default gateway. If you want your system to learn this then you have to set this to 1.\nnet.ipv6.conf.wlan1.accept_ra_pinfo = 0\n\nThis one tells your system not to accept any prefix information from the RA. It won't be able to learn which prefixes are on the link and it won't be able to auto configure its addresses because of that.\nnet.ipv6.conf.wlan1.accept_ra_rt_info_max_plen = 0\n\nYour RA also contains a more specific route for 2601:xxxx:xxxx:47fc::/64. This setting tells the kernel not to accept any routes longer than a /0. If you want to accept that /64 then you need to set this value to at least 64.\nnet.ipv6.conf.wlan1.autoconf = 1\n\nThis is good. However, you didn't include all the details about your RA message. This will only work if the prefix information option in the RA has the Autoconf (A) flag set, and that flag is not visible in your question.\n", "Q: Running Canon 120 LiDE scanner on Ubuntu 14.04 I am running Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7 virtually.

It is run by cron.daily at midnight along with other jobs. I would like to change the time that unattended updates runs but not the other cron.daily jobs. I have tried moving /etc/cron.daily/apt somewhere else and running it as a separate cron job but it does not seem to run. It works fine when I move it back under cron.daily. How can I schedule the unattended updates script to run at a different time (1900 daily)?\n\nA: You should be able to move the script to a different location and then set up a cron entry (crontab -e) to run your script at your preferred days and time. \nNote that the format for root and normal users differs slightly. When executing crontab -e as root, each crontab line has one additional parameter to specify as which user to run the entry.\nCron logs to /var/log/syslog. Check that file for errors: grep -i cron syslog.\nThe most encountered problem with cron is that it executes its entries in a very limited environment, causing a lot of commands to fail because they can't be found. It is possible to extend the PATH variable with the most common paths.\nFor details about cron see CronHowto and Cron Community Wiki\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 NVIDIA Drivers I am trying to install NVIDIA drivers (NVIDIA GForce 210) to my Ubuntu Linux 15.04 [32bit].

So I was wondering if there was a way to overcome this disadvantage and make it so that doing allinfo software-ce[TAB] will work just the same as it does when you use it with the actual command, and not just make a large tab space?\nI am using gnome-terminal.\n\nOS Information:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\nCodename:   vivid\n\nPackage Information:\ngnome-terminal:\n  Installed: 3.14.2-0ubuntu3\n  Candidate: 3.14.2-0ubuntu3\n  Version table:\n *** 3.14.2-0ubuntu3 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n\nA: Great question! If your allinfo command was the same as just apt-cache, (ie, without the show) then we could look at the completion for apt-cache, and apply that to your allinfo alias.\nHowever, you want a subset of the apt-cache completion, so we have a little more work to do.\nIf we look in the completion definition for apt-cache - in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/apt-cache, we see the following is used for the show subcommand:\n        COMPREPLY=( $( apt-cache --no-generate pkgnames \"$cur\" 2> /dev/null ) )\n\n- this is just setting the COMPREPLY variable to the list of matching packages.\nSo, we can borrow this and write our own function, and bind it to your allinfo alias:\n# define a function to print the possible completions for\n# an allinfo invocation\n_allinfo()\n{\n    _init_completion || return\n    COMPREPLY=($(apt-cache --no-generate pkgnames \"$cur\" 2>/dev/null))\n    return 0\n}\n\n# bind the above completion function to the 'allinfo' alias\ncomplete -F _allinfo allinfo\n\nIf you add that fragement to your .bashrc file, you should get the completions working as you expect.\n\nA: I have no idea for bash, but it works with zsh and some plugins\nInstall the z-shell with\nsudo apt-get install zsh\n\nand set the z-shell as your standard shell\nsudo chsh \"$USER\" -s $(which zsh)\n\nand start a new terminal to use the z-shell\nAdd Antigenv1\ncd\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen.git\n\nAnd configure\n# path to antigen clone\nsource ~/antigen/antigen.zsh\n\n# Load the oh-my-zsh's library.\nantigen use oh-my-zsh\n\n# Bundles from the default repo (robbyrussell's oh-my-zsh).\nantigen bundle git\nantigen bundle heroku\nantigen bundle pip\nantigen bundle lein\nantigen bundle command-not-found\nantigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-completions src\n\n# Syntax highlighting bundle.\nantigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting\n\n# Load the theme.\nantigen theme robbyrussell\n# antigen bundle nojhan/liquidprompt\n\n# Tell antigen that you're done.\nantigen apply\n\n\nSome images (prompt is nojhan/liquidprompt)\n\n\n\n", "Q: Google sites are not opening I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and I'm having a strange issue, I have no idea what else to do...\n1) Some Google sites/functionalities are not opening.

Sometimes the desktop image will show, and sometimes it won't.\nOn my original install of 14.04 LTS I had a similar issue, which I eventually found was a improper video driver. After repairing, my issue was resolved. However, since the updates this repair is not working. I was thinking it might be an issue with unity, Ubuntu-desktop, or compiz, but have removed and reinstalled all, along with my NVidia driver and no improvement. I also am starting to believe it may be an issue with the most recent kernel update. \nIf any one has ideas or know of any recent kernel issues, I am open to anything. Just what ever you suggest please be descriptive as possible, as I stated I am still learning Linux and Ubuntu.\nAny help would be great, at this point I am lost. \n\nA: Try upgrading to the latest kernel then.To do that you need to install the linux-generic-lts-vivid package.To do so type this in the terminal\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\n\nA: Okay I'm adding another answer seeing as the comments won't allow spaces :>)\nThe linux-kernel-lts-vivid should show up in your repositories.If you can then maybe install Synaptic and in it search for the package using the Search bar.\nTo install Synaptic\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nTo install the latest nvidia propeitary drivers.You need to add the PPA for it.To do so type this into the terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mamarley/nvidia\n\nAfter that to install it do\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-352\n\n", "Q: Elementary OS website spontaneously opens up in Chrome throughout the day. I have no idea why or how to stop it. Any solutions? I am using Ubuntu 14.04 on my chromebook. However I'm 100% sure the chromebook has nothing to do with it as the problem just started up a couple days ago some time after visiting elementary.io .\nI have not installed Elementary on this laptop ever. However I did try to install their Pantheon DE to no avail earlier this week. I thought I properly removed the DE using:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge elementary-desktop\n\nThen did:\nsudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:elementary-os/testing\n\nsudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:elementary-os/daily\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nHowever the website launches in google chrome when I first login into the desktop. Then it will spontaneously launch periodically as I'm using my laptop throughout the day. I have Firefox installed on the laptop as well and this never happens with Firefox. Google is also set to my homepage in chrome. So I know Elementary website didn't get mistakenly set as my homepage\nDoes anyone have any solutions as to what to do about this?\n\nA: Cause of the problem\nWhen you have installed the elementary Pantheon desktop environment you have installed the elementary captive portal assistant too, which helps you to connect to different public WiFi networks. Its job is to open the portal website so that you can log in to the network. Actually it opens the https://elementary.io website. (It is the network's job to redirect you to their sign in portal.)\nThis logic is contained in this script /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/90captive_portal_test,\nwhich is being executed by the network assistant.\n\nSolution\nsudo chmod -x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/90captive_portal_test\nThis will prevent the network assistant to execute the script. \n\nBehind the scenes\nThis is the piece of the code, which causes the annoying popups:\n#launch the browser, but on boot we need to wait that nm-applet starts\nstart_browser() {\n    local user=\"$1\"\n    wait_for_process nm-applet\n    $logger \"Running browser as '$user' to login in captive portal\"\n    su \"$user\" -s /bin/sh -c \"captive-login 2>/dev/null || sensible-browser start.elementaryos.org 2>/dev/null\"\n}\n\nReferences: \n\n\n*\n\n*elementary OS Launchpad bug report \n\n*Answer on elementary OS's stack exchange \n\n*Disabling captive portal detection on elementary OS Freya\n", "Q: bash: /home/rathin/.profile:: No such file or directory while trying to reload it via \"source ~/.profile\" after editing it through \"vi ~/.profile\" After I edited my ~/.profile via vi command, couldn't get out of it successfully.\nSo I closed the terminal and when I tried it again after reopening terminal, it showed duplicate file named ~/.profile.swp.

Can someone please explain how to make the blank newlines be \"counted\" in the for loop?\n\nA: You can't do this using the shell's field splitting.\nAdjacent whitespace characters from IFS are parsed together, so you cannot use field splitting to distinguish between adjacent whitespace IFS characters. From the standard (Shell and Utilities, section 2.6.5):\n\nEach occurrence in the input of an IFS character that is not IFS white space, along with any adjacent IFS white space, shall delimit a field, as described previously.\n\nThat's just how it is.\nSince this is a hypothetical question, and you haven't said what it is exactly that you're doing, I won't suggest another way.\n\nA: I think you will need to use while read line instead: \nx=0\nwhile read line ; do\n    x=$(($x+1))\ndone\n\n\nA: You can do this using read in a while loop instead of a for loop:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile read line; do\n    ((x++))\ndone < file\necho $x\nexit 0\n\n~$ cat file\nword\n\n\n\nword\n~$ bash script.sh\n5\n\n", "Q: Errors were encountered while processing: android-studio Whenever I install a new software or I use update command on the terminal i always get this error message and update is also interrupted. what do i do? \nI encounter the following error message-\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n android-studio\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\nA: Just because the package manager continues following an interrupt doesn't mean that the package itself will not contain errors.\nTry removing the package and starting the process over again.\nFirst purge the package:\nsudo apt-get purge android-studio\n\nThen fix any remaining issues:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a   or\nsudo apt-get update\n\nRun the installation again:\nsudo apt-get install android-studio\n\n", "Q: Blockify won't run Blockify mutes Spotify during ad's.\nI installed it through the fixed version (ctrl-f the link) on to Xubuntu.

I'm trying to write a very basic program in python, here's the issue: I ask the question raw_input(\"question\" ), then assign an if statement like so:\nThis is the error:\nThe debugged program raised the exception unhandled NameError\n\"name 'tx_rate' is not defined\"\nFile: /home/Budget.py, Line: 47.\n\nThis is the code:\nans1 = raw_input(\"Do you know your tax rate?\" )\nif 'ans1' == 'yes':\n     tx_rate = raw_input(\"What is it?\")\n     float(tx_rate)\n     tx_rate = float(tx_rate)\n     print \"Thank you! Will use tax rate %s, instead of 0.15!\" % (tx_rate)\nelif \"ans1\" == \"no\":\n    print \"Okay, that's alright, we'll use 0.15 as the average tax rate!\"\n    tx_rate = 0.15\nelse:\n    print \"Sorry, incorrect value, please answer yes or no.\"\ngross_pay = (hrs * rate) * 4.0\nnet_pay = gross_pay - (gross_pay * tx_rate) * 4.0 [That last line is line 47]\n\nThe error comes from the variable for tx_rate never being assigned because weather I asnwer yes or no it runs the ELSE option\nso what happens is that when I run the code, I get through a lot of questions, were I ask about earnings, and then when it loads that question up there, I answer yes or no and it prints the else option and then tells me error \"name 'variable' is not defined] seemingly because, since it won't allow me to answer with yes or no it just tries to run code with a non existent variable. Could anyone help me fix this? Sorry if this isn't where I should ask! \n\nA: You should probably try defining tx_rate=0.15 before your if...else conditions. Because when your user inputs nothing for the first question where you ask for yes or no it directly goes to the else part where there's no tx_rate so giving you error \"variable not defined\"\n\nA: @jaysheel utekar is right. The problem is that, if your code ends up in the else case of your if statement, variable tx_rate is not defined. This causes the calculation in line 47 to throw an exception.\nBut there are a few more problems with your code: if  'ans1' == 'yes': will always result in False, because you are comparing two different strings and not a variable and a string. The correct code is: if  ans1 == 'yes':\nThe same problem with: elif \"ans1\" == \"no\":. The correct code is: elif ans1 == \"no\":\nYou can rewrite your if statement in a much shorter form as follows:\nif ans1 == 'yes':\n    tx_rate = raw_input(\"What is it?\")\n    float(tx_rate)\n    tx_rate = float(tx_rate)\n    print \"Thank you! Will use tax rate %s, instead of 0.15!\" % (tx_rate)\nelse:\n    print \"Okay, that's allright, we'll use 0.15 as the average tax rate!\"\n    tx_rate = 0.15\n\nThat ensures that tx_rate is always defined.\nAnother solution that keeps repeating the question until the user enters yes or no (and thus also ensures that variable tx_data is defined) is:\ntx_rate = None\nwhile (not tx_rate):\n    ans1 = raw_input(\"Do you know your tax rate?\" )\n    if ans1 == 'yes':\n        tx_rate = raw_input(\"What is it?\")\n        float(tx_rate)\n        tx_rate = float(tx_rate)\n        print \"Thank you! Will use tax rate %s, instead of 0.15!\" % (tx_rate)\n    elif ans1 == \"no\":\n        print \"Okay, that's alright, we'll use 0.15 as the average tax rate!\"\n        tx_rate = 0.15\n    else:\n        print \"Sorry, incorrect value, please answer yes or no.\"\n\nIf you really want to be strict, you can add some range and type checking on the input for tx_rate. People could enter zero or a vlue larger than 1 or even text instead of a number.\n", "Q: Updating OpenGL I am using OpenGL to develop applications on Ubuntu, and I wanted to use \"modern OpenGL\" instead of using deprecated things like glBegin.

If the laptop is crashing under both Linux and FreeBSD, then the problem is almost certainly not a software bug, since the code shared between the two kernels is negligible. Crashes under two OSes suggests that you've got bad hardware.\nThis hypothesis is further strengthened by a Web search on \"machine check exception,\" which turns up many references, such as this Wikipedia article, which states:\n\nA Machine Check Exception (MCE) is a type of computer hardware error that occurs when a computer's central processing unit detects a hardware problem.\n\nIf this is a new computer, I suggest you return it to the store for a refund and describe the problem.

This downloaded Android Studio at /root/tools/android/android-studio,\nand platform-tools and all other tools at /root/Android/Sdk/.\nAndroid Studio on my PC is working just fine, and I am able to create an application and also run it on my mobile phone using it.

At my low level of expertise, the only way I can share a mounted external drive from Ubuntu 14.04 to Windows computers in my house is to use the Samba GUI to share it, then edit smb.conf to add \"force user = (my username)\", and access settings as \"Allow access to anyone\". \nAny attempt to restrict users, or define users, results in failure and seems to increase the difficulty level of doing this from \"something I can do\" to \"something I will have to dedicate three or four full days to researching and understanding and experimenting with.\" \nThe end result is that any Windows computer connected to my WiFi can find the shared drive on the network, and connect to it without a password. \nThe shared drive only contains media files (music and movies), but I've enabled reading and writing, because the end goal is to let myself add music to the server without having to use the Ubuntu box, which is intended to just sit quietly without a monitor, etc. and act as a server. \nThis feels unsafe, but I don't know if it is unsafe. My wifi uses WPA2-Personal with TKIP+AES for security. \nIf this is a terrible and wholly unsafe idea, pointers on where I can find an explicit step-by-step guide to setting users for Samba to work with Windows 7 and 8 would be appreciated. \n\nA: As long as you only use this on your private home network and you don't share the network with other people that you don't know/trust (such as in an apartment complex), then you should be fine. WPA2 can be breached through brute-force attacks but someone would have to be in range of your wifi connection in order to attempt to gain access, and if you're very concerned about it then you could always maintain good backups on an external offline drive. \nIf you're not convinced, here is a complete guide on setting up samba to work with Windows computers from the Ubuntu forums. \n\nA: Yes, it is safe as long as you have a complex wifi password.The only way for people to get in is by gaining access to your wifi or router (wan). I recommend that you use a password though. If you want to ensure that nobody is on your network, run the arp -na command (you can also use nmap to scan the whole netmask).\n", "Q: Dpkg error exit status 2 Tried to install jenkins.deb and I got the shown below.

(There is another drive with same properties that does.)\nAny ideas why?\n\n\nA: GUI tools to make partitions automount\nFrom your comment, I understand the GUI tool did not add anything to your fstab file. In general, I am not very fond of GUI tools to edit fstab; many times unnecessary options are added or errors occur.\nMaking an ntfs partition automount, using the uuid\nSince making an ntfs partition automount is relatively simple, I would prefer to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory to mount the partition into, e.g.:\nsudo mkdir /media/mountpoint_name\n\n\n*Run sudo blkid. It will output lines like:\n/dev/sda5: LABEL=\"intern_2\" UUID=\"2899FAA548C61099\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n\nThe uuid you are looking for is 2899FAA548C61099 in the example above (If that would be the partition you'd like to automount)\n\n*Open your fstab file:\nsudo -i gedit /etc/fstab\n\n\n*Add a line to the file, looking like (an entry from my fstab file as an example):\nUUID=0A444ED409660B91 /media/intern_1 ntfs auto\n\n(Replace /media/intern_1 by the mount point you created in [1])\nTest the mount by running sudo mount -a. The drive should mount, and will automount & show up in \"devices\" from then on:\n\nNote\nIn most cases, instead of using the uuid, you can simply use the partition's mention (which is also in the output of `sudo blkid), e.g.\n/dev/sda5 /media/intern_1 ntfs auto\n\n", "Q: cli command to run keyboard shortcuts, e.g. Alt-F2? I want to use hot corner for run dialog window. What is the name and command of that tiny box (program) which is called when I press Alt-F2? This is cinnamon related question. \nFor example, under lxde, keybinding for that dialog box is Alt+F2 and it executes >lxpanelctl run< command..\n\nA: That is almost certainly not a dedicated program but just a part of Unity. I know this is the case for Cinnamon for example. \nAs an alternative, you can set the hot corner to launch a terminal. That's basically the same thing except that you'll have to close the terminal manually. \n\nIn the specific case of cinnamon, what is run is a javascript script. Cinnamon runs a lot of javascript under the hood. That is not something you can run yourself, however, it is being interpreted by cinnamon itself and is not an external program. Specifically, Alt+F2 will run /usr/share/cinnamon/js/ui/runDialog.js but I don't think it will be possible to run that manually.\n\nA: Run xdotool commands to simulate key strokes instead\nNot literally what you asked for, but nevertheless a solution would be to use xdotool to simulate keystrokes / key combinations, and achieve the same result.\nIf you add these commands to hot corners, you will achieve exactly what you describe.\nHow to do that\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Simulate the keystrokes you'd like to use. From your example: the command\nxdotool key Alt+F2 \n\ndoes the same as actually pressing those keys. That way you won't need to know the actual commands \"under the hood\". As terdon mentions, those actions will most likely not be available as separate commands.\nSee also man xdotool or this link\n", "Q: Windows 7 reinstall now boot is broken I had a virus on the Windows 7 part of my pc.

Would I be able to put the locale in here and have it be recognized when choosing a locale? What would I name the file for this locale? Where could I find information on file format and valid values for the various settings?\n\nA: We've got documentation on the wiki pages that describe how to add a new language to Ubuntu. In a nutshell:\n\n*\n\n*Choose the name of the locale. The format is language_REGION@modifier, where language is an ISO 639-2 two-letter code (or the three-letter one if the former is not available), REGION is an ISO 3166 code representing the region where this language is spoken, and modifier has no set syntax and can be used to specify advanced uses for the locale (e.g. a different script). Most locales will not need a modifier.\n\n*\n\n*Examples: bn_IN is the locale for Bengali in India, it_CH is the locale for Italian in Switzerland.\n\n\n\n*Create a file with that name. Once the name has been chosen, you'll have to create a file with that name, which will contain the definition of your locale. Note that if your language is spoken in different regions, you might have to create different files, one for each region.\n\n*\n\n*Example: ca_AD, ca_ES, ca_FR, ca_IT are locale definitions for the Catalan language as spoken in the regions of Andorra, Spain, France and Italy.\n\n\n\n*Define the locale. At this point you'll have to populate the file with the definition of your language. Locale definition files have got a specific syntax. Consult the additional resources below to learn about this syntax and how to define the new locale. Looking through the available locale files in the glibc sources can be helpful to get an idea of the format. Also remember to reuse: use the copy statement to include sections from locales with identical content.\n\n\n*Test the locale definition. Once your locale file or files are ready, you should test them locally to ensure they are correct. The basic steps are:\n\n*\n\n*copying the file to /usr/local/share/i18n/locales/,\n\n\n*running the following command to generate a binary file to be used by applications, and doing the actual test.\nlocaledef -i inputfile -c -f <charset> <locale>\n\nExample (testing the Asturian locale with the date command):\ncp ast_ES /usr/local/share/i18n/locales/ast_ES\nlocaledef -i ast_ES -c -f ISO-8859-15 ast_ES\nLANG=ast_ES date\n\nAdditional resources on creating a glibc locale:\n\n*\n\n*IBM Locale Definition document\n\n*Available locale files in the glibc sources (click on the blob link to see the contents of the file)\n\n*Locale Helper\n\n*Tips on writing a glibc locale file\n\n*Glibc Documentation on localedef\n\n*Translate Toolkit project documentation\n\n*Examples:\n\n*\n\n*Submission of the Pashto locale\n\n*Submission of the Chuvash locale\n\nA: compile your locale using :\nsudo localedef -i custom -f UTF-8 custom.UTF-8 -c -v \n\nwhere custom is name of your locale file and copy locale file under /usr/share/i18n/locales/ than  sudo locale-gen and modify /etc/environment or ~/.profile . done !!!\n\nWhat would I name the file for this locale?\n\nyou can give any name of your local\n\nWould I be able to put the locale in here and have it be recognized when choosing a locale?\n\nyou need to mention custom locale in /etc/environment or ~/.profile\n\nWhere could I find information on file format and valid values for the various settings?\n\nyou can refer this link for more info: How can I customize a system locale? and http://lh.2xlibre.net/locales/\n", "Q: Accidentally changed shell in gnome-terminal, no longer opens I wanted to make screenfetch start at terminal startup.\nBut I realized that I changed the shell from bash to screenfetch and of course gnome terminal doesn't startup.\nI have installed MATE terminal just so I can use a terminal.

Am I doing something wrong while adding it to path variable?\nEdit:\nThis question is not a duplicate of Environment variables when run with 'sudo', because in that question zetah asked how to pass arbitrary variables to a python command. They are able to execute python using sudo, but I can't execute php using sudo.\nFollowing this answer, I added the PATH to sudo using the following command:\nsudo PATH=$PATH:/opt/lampp/bin php -v\n\nbut I am getting the output as before:\nsudo: php: command not found\n\nFollowing this answer, I added -E to sudo, but I get the same result:\n$ sudo -E php -v\nsudo: php: command not found\n\n\nA: Why sudo doesn't use your PATH\nThe reason sudo ignores your PATH variable is that it has its own secure_path, and it's fairly determined to use it.\nIf you sudo cat /etc/sudoers or just sudo grep secure /etc/sudoers, you'll see what this path is on your system. I have this line:\nDefaults    secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin\"\n\nThe purpose of sudo's secure_path is to try to make it less likely that a user with sudo privilege will (accidentally) run dangerous code as root after their path has been modified, perhaps to include local directories.\nIt's possible to avoid sudo using the secure_path altogether by modifying /etc/sudoers to comment out that line, but that would be a bad idea because it removes a security measure, and it's also unnecessary because you can easily work around it in various preferable ways.\nGetting sudo to use your PATH\nTo override the secure_path and make sudo use your PATH as currently defined, as muru commented, you can use:\nsudo env PATH=\"$PATH\" command\nNote that the -E flag or merely assigning the variable do not work (on Ubuntu at least).\n$ mkdir junk                            # create a test directory to add to PATH\n$ echo \"echo foo\" > junk/useless        # create a harmless program\n$ chmod u+x junk/useless                # make it executable\n$ PATH=\"$PATH\":~/junk                   # add directory to PATH\n\nWhen adding to PATH, use the absolute path (the shell will expand ~ before assigning the variable). I don't need to export (and doing so does not help), because PATH is already exported, and changing its value will cause child processes to inherit the change too.\n$ useless\nfoo\n$ sudo useless\nsudo: useless: command not found\n$ sudo -E useless\nsudo: useless: command not found\n\nIt's often expected that this will work... man sudo says:\n-E, --preserve-env\n            Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to\n            preserve their existing environment variables.\n\nBut that doesn't work. The -E flag has no effect on secure_path, which is possibly a bug.\n$ sudo PATH=\"$PATH\" useless\nsudo: useless: command not found\n\nThis does not affect sudo's own environment, which has been set according to the security policy, configured by /etc/sudoers. This includes env_reset and secure_path as defaults on Ubuntu, causing a minimal environment to be loaded and the PATH to be set to whatever is in secure_path.\nIf sudo were able to find a command called useless in one of its own path directories and run it, it would pass PATH=$PATH into its environment as demonstrated here. But it will not itself use the given value of PATH. The solution is to run:\n$ sudo env PATH=\"$PATH\" useless\nfoo\n\nThis workaround uses the env command to set PATH. Unlike sudo, env uses the given variables to set the environment, then looks for the command argument and runs the command with the modified environment. As info (coreutils) env invocation says:\n\nModifications to PATH take effect prior to searching for command.\n\nSetting the PATH\nWhen you changed your PATH variable to include the directory /opt/lampp/bin, you used this command:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/lampp/bin\n\nThis would be effective for the current shell and all the current shell's child processes, such as shells called from this shell. When you've exited this shell and all its children have exited, that modified PATH variable has been thoroughly forgotten, and when you open a new shell you will find the old PATH variable that does not include /opt/lampp/bin. For that reason, the full command suggested by muru,\nsudo env PATH=\"$PATH:/opt/lampp/bin\" php -v\n\nwould have been necessary if you were not still using a shell where you had already added /opt/lampp/bin. \nTo change the path permanently, you would need to edit some configuration file that modifies your user environment or is read by shells when they start up. You can add a line to assign environment variables in your ~/.profile, for example:\nPATH=\"$PATH:/opt/lampp/bin\"\n\nThen, after logging out and back in (or running source ~/.profile to see the effect immediately), you would always be able to run\nphp -v\n\nor\nsudo env PATH=\"$PATH\" php -v\n\nwithout adjusting your PATH first. \nLess cumbersome alternatives\nA more convenient workaround could be to make a symlink to the executable in a location that is in the secure_path and the default PATH, for example:\nsudo ln -s /opt/lampp/bin/php /usr/local/bin/php\n\nYou will then not need to do anything special when calling the command with sudo, nor will you ever need to take any steps to adjust your PATH, permanently or temporarily.\nIf the program you are installing has a name that is the same as the name of another program that system processes may attempt to call, then give the symlink a different name, to avoid confusing those processes. You can check that the name you want to use is not already the name of some other command using the type command:\n$ type php\nbash: type: php: not found\n\nSo on this system I can create a command php without fear of anything going wrong, at the moment. If I install other programs that provide a php command in future, I might have to re-think my configuration.\nYou could also make an alias for the command and add it to your ~/.bashrc, for example:\nalias sudo-php='sudo env PATH=\"$PATH:/opt/lampp/bin/php\"'\n\nYou could then (after running source .bashrc or opening a new shell) run\nsudo-php\n\ninstead of sudo php to run this program as root, and sudo will not claim to be ignorant of its location.\nThis alias would only be available in interactive shells, so it wouldn't confuse other programs.\nOf course, it's possible to make an alias for just sudo to make it always use your PATH, with alias sudo='sudo env PATH=\"$PATH\"', but that's a bad idea as it would make the system less secure.\n", "Q: Add executable to Path I know this question has been asked a hundred times but for some reason all the answers aren't working on my system.\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04\nI'm trying to add the file activator to my PATH so that I can launch it from any directory.\nactivator sits in /opt/activator-dist-1.3.5/\nHowever, I've tried adding all sorts of lines to .profile, but none of them seem to work - when I try and call activator elsewhere, I just get an error.\nWhat exactly should I be adding?\n\nNeither of these work:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/activator-dist-1.3.5\n\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/activator-dist-1.3.5/activator/\n\n\nA: Try this\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/opt/activator-dist-1.3.5\"\n\nOpen a terminal and type source .profile\nThen type activator \n", "Q: 14.04 - GPG error, public key not available apt-get update returns:\nW: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net trusty Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY D46F45428842CE5E\n\ni've tried:\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys D46F45428842CE5E\n\nalso tried the fix for bug 1263540, all without success. \nfairly new to ubuntu too.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Found this server for this key but unfortunately seems down.\napt-key adv --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys D46F45428842CE5E\n\nAt least try this:\nTry to import all missing GPG keys\n", "Q: Alternative to Thunar that can access Android fs (Samsung Galaxy Tab S SM-T700) via USB I've spent one frustrating hour trying in vain to get Thunar to access the files ystem of a Samsung Galaxy Tab S SM-T700 via USB.

I have an UFW enabled, allowed ssh/tcp, logging is on, all that stuff, just following the basic UFW guide on ubuntu wiki.\nAnyways, I found the slightly less basic guide for Firewall on ubuntu wiki (https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/firewall.html) and I attempted to set up IP masquerading for my firewall. So, I tried to open LibreOffice and attempted to edit the document /etc/default/ufw and tried editing the text so that the default forward policy would be set to ACCEPT, so that packets could be forwarded.\nEvery time I try to save the document after editing it, it first asks if i want to save it in .odt or .txt. No matter which option I choose, i always get the following error message\nError saving the document ufw: /etc/default/ufw.txt does not exist.\nOr .odt depending on which format i tried saving it in. So, what gives here? Shouldn't that file exist? Is it a problem if it says it doesnt exist when I attempt to save it. Do i need to do something else first? I'm just full of questions and Ive no idea here, so nay help would be appreciated :) I'm sorry if it's a dumb question, I just figured asking an honest community for help when I need it would be the best choice. Thanks and cheers.\n\nA: The document is just called /etc/default/ufw, there is no .txt or .odtextension on the file name. \nIn fact, if you save it with one of these extensions, it will not work as desired since the ufw program looks for a file called simply ufw.\nTo see if it already exists, you can list it by typing cat /etc/default/ufw in a terminal window (it is not a very big file)\nTry editing it with gedit which is a simple text editor.\nThe file is also owned by root, so you will not be able to save your changes unless you do so as root, by typing gksudo gedit /etc/default/ufw in a terminal.\nA window will pop up and ask you to enter your password, then you will be able to edit the file and save your changes.\n", "Q: Node modules installed but not available I am new to Linux environment and right now learning node.js\nFollowing the tutorial i installed node module express globally as shown in below screenshot\n\nBut when i am trying to use express in terminal it says express is not installed. \n\nPlease note that i have installed from nvm\nThanks\n\nA: Installing express globally generally isn't a good idea, the way most node modules work is by being installed on a per-repo basis so anyone can recreate the environment by running npm install.\nThus the recommended way to install express is to run npm install express --save, which will not only download the module but also create an entry in the project's package.json.\nExpress is then never run directly from the command line but instead added using require() in either app.js or a file run by it.

I have noticed on other Ubuntu machines when you don't have Maven and you try mvn it tells you to install maven or maven2. This does not happen on my xfce, how do I enable it?\n\nA: The package, appropriately, is called command-not-found.

It basically provides a python script /usr/lib/command-not-found that actually does the main job.\nBut the messages that you get in Ubuntu is actually defined by a function that actually exploits command-not-found's properties. Its called command_not_found_handle and resides in /etc/bash.bashrc.\n$ type -a command_not_found_handle \ncommand_not_found_handle is a function\ncommand_not_found_handle () \n{ \n    if [ -x /usr/lib/command-not-found ]; then\n        /usr/lib/command-not-found -- \"$1\";\n        return $?;\n    else\n        if [ -x /usr/share/command-not-found/command-not-found ]; then\n            /usr/share/command-not-found/command-not-found -- \"$1\";\n            return $?;\n        else\n            printf \"%s: command not found\\n\" \"$1\" 1>&2;\n            return 127;\n        fi;\n    fi\n}\n\nBecause of the above function we get different error messages in different cases :\n$ svn\nThe program 'svn' is currently not installed.

You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install subversion\n\n$ /usr/lib/command-not-found foobar\nfoobar: command not found\n\nAs you does not have the command-not-found package enabled, you are basically satisfying the following snippet of command_not_found_handle function every time :\nprintf \"%s: command not found\\n\" \"$1\" 1>&2;\nreturn 127;\n\nHence you are getting the following every time :\n$ svn\nsvn: command not found\n\n$ foobar\nfoobar: command not found\n\nIn a nutshell, you can install the command-not-found package and then add the function (if not there already) mentioned above to the file /etc/bash.bashrc (for all users) or ~/.bashrc (for only you).\n", "Q: How to keep alive a wifi connection on a laptop I have a Dell Mini 9 running Ubuntu 14. The wifi seems to work well, but only as long as I use it.

I tried to run the boot-repair GUI on a live session of Ubuntu but after the restart of the PC GRUB displays ONLY Ubuntu. \nBefore the installation I had on the first HD Ubuntu installed alongside with Windows 7 and the grub displayed both of them without problem.\nAfter I installed Windows 8.1 on the second HD the boot loader(?) was replaced with the Windows one and I could select only between Windows 7 and 8 to boot, but not Ubuntu.\nHow can I fix GRUB now? I wish GRUB could displays all the three OSs (even if different HDs). If not possible I wish I could just choose which HD to boot and then the grub to displays correctly the OS of that HD.\nThis is the output of boot-repair (broken link).\n\nA: I'm glad you fixed the problem. For future reference, you can use GRUB (or any other EFI boot manager) to switch between two versions of Windows. The way I know to do this requires planning before installing your second Windows, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the first Windows normally.\n\n*Boot to a Linux emergency disk (the Ubuntu installer in \"try before installing\" mode should work fine).\n\n*Change the type code of the EFI System Partition (ESP) to something that Windows will ignore. gdisk is most flexible about this, since you can set the type code to anything you like, such as 8300 (the code used by Linux). You might optionally change the type code of the Windows partition, too, to keep it out of the second installation's boot loader. If you use gdisk, be sure to save your changes with w.\n\n*Install your second Windows. The installation should create a second ESP on the disk, and your computer should boot to this version of Windows. (If you did not hide the first Windows by changing its type code, it will probably show up as an option in the Windows boot loader.)\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu installer in \"try before installing\" mode again.\n\n*Change the type code on the first ESP back to the right thing (EF00 in gdisk). If you changed the type code of the first Windows partition, change it back (to 0700 in gdisk) at the same time.\n\n*Run the Ubuntu installer and install Ubuntu.\n\n\nWhen the process completes, you should have GRUB controlling the boot and giving you an option of two Windows installations or Ubuntu. I'm not sure if it will tell you the names/versions of the two Windows installations, though; it might just say \"Windows\" for each of them.\nMany variants of this procedure should work, too, such as installing the second Windows after you install Ubuntu (which will require resetting GRUB as the default boot program). It might be possible to do something similar after installing both copies of Windows by juggling the type codes of the ESPs and Windows partitions and using each Windows version's installation/repair disk to get it to re-install the Windows boot loader on the target ESP.\nThe key in any of these cases is that you'll have (at least) two ESPs, one for each version of Windows. (Ubuntu doesn't care which ESP it uses.) The dual-ESP setup can cause confusion in the future, though. The Windows 7 installer, for instance, gets confused if it sees two ESPs, so a re-installation will fail. (I don't know if Windows 8 or 10 has the same problem.) Of course, you changed ESP type codes once, so you can do it again if you need to re-install Windows.\n\nA: I did sudo update-grub and it solved the problem.\n", "Q: How do I set up a second monitor (extended display) in Xfce?

I am a new Linux user and initially concluded that I could not install p7-Zip (or other software) in a live session. I later discovered that the Install button in the Software Manger GUI is hidden until you press More Info... . I was very happy, but I later wondered where the OS and programs do their writes. It seems clear that RAM is employed; I am hoping to get some details on Ubuntu's implementation (if a RAMDisk is used) and how much space is allocated. (Note that this is a different idea from persistent storage on a USB drive or RW optical media). Thank you kindly for reading and in advance for discussion!\n\nA: It is true that you can install software in a live session of Ubuntu, when booting from a USB stick (called a Live CD). Where it stores it depends on which kind of USB stick you have made (persistent or non-persistent, as you mention yourself). To provide a complete answer, I will mention both options below.\nIf the standard, non-persistent session is used, it makes a file system in the RAM, which can be used until RAM space runs out. All changes will be deleted when rebooting the system.\nWhat can also be done though is to use a persistent USB drive, where a certain amount of space is allocated on the USB drive itself. This space can be used for saving configurations and installed software and save it, making it available again when booting from the USB next time.\n", "Q: Error When I upload any file to web server I use ubuntu 14.04, & installed everything relate web server correctly like Apache, php, MySQL, phpmyadmin/ , I am installed wordpress on Ubuntu server...\nWhen I add image on wp post getting error message \"Unable to create directory wp-content/uploads/2015/07.

Let's assume I have a foreign text document I open with a text editing tool that recognizes fonts (e.g. LibreOffice Writer). In this document, there might be some fonts used that are not available on my Ubuntu installation (e.g. Garamond).\nThe question is: How does Ubuntu decide which one of the installed fonts to use as replacement for the unknown font? Does it read any of the font's characteristics and look for a similar one? Is a default substitution font always used? Does it search for similar font names?\nAdditional to that, I would like to know if I can somehow change this behavior or set manual font aliases to automatically use e.g. the free font EB-Garamont instead of the non-free Garamont?\n\nA: I think it is decided not by Ubuntu but by the program (LibreOffice, OpenOffice etc.). I could not see anything related to LibreOffice per se but OpenOffice has a nice wiki with some details on how this \"Font Fallback\" works. It might be applicable to LibreOffice also, in general.\nI am reproducing some sections from the wiki below for clarify. It is hard to explain better than what is in the wiki, so better to read it from there:\nWhat is Font Fallback in OpenOffice.org 2?\nFont-Fallback kicks in whenever a font is requested that is not installed on the system. (Not installed means: not available to OOo).\nOOo then tries to use a different font from the ones that OOo knows about that matches the requested one as close as possible.\nHow does Font Fallback work?\nFor font-fallback to produce satisfying results, OOo somehow has to know about similarities of fonts. OOo must know that it can for example substitute Helvetica in place of Arial, but not Comic Sans.

The problem for me was related to the AllowOverride setting as well.

It's a remote server so if the bootloader breaks that's a real problem. \n\n*why did apt-get install unzip update so many unrelated packages?\n\n\nA: The \"not enough space on boot\" thing is an independent issue, which seems to be a constant problem for people who have disc encryption on. It seems to have been reported as a bug report for a year now but is still not fixed for some reason. You can fix it with\ndpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d' | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\nin the console -- this looks for which kernel packages you've got installed and then purges them all apart from the one you're currently running.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can possibily delete every kernel but the one you are using (cf., uname -r). You can maybe leave another one to be sure, but you certainly do not\nneed 10.\n\n*I guess you have had some unconfigured packages the last time you ran apt-get/dpkg.\n\n", "Q: Use Caps Lock as arbitrary shortcut key in KDE5 I'd like to run a bash script when I press caps lock in KDE5. I had this working just fine in KDE4. I can easily assign Caps Lock as the trigger to a command in system settings -> shortcuts -> custom shortcuts, but it simply doesn't work.\nThere are some options in system settings -> input devices -> keyboard -> advanced under \"Caps lock key behaviour\", but they're all pretty specific such as using caps as an additional modifier key. Disabling also actually disables it completely, rather than just disabling the caps functionality, which is a problem with this approach.\nIs there a workaround to properly remap caps?\n\nA: Not the most optimal solution, but mapping caps lock to another key, such as 'F22', with xmodmap allows KDE's custom shortcuts to capture caps lock. Then disable the caps functionality:\nAdd to ~/.Xmodmap:\n! May need the following line. On ubuntu this seems to cause an error.\n! remove Lock = Caps_Lock\nkeycode 66 = F22\nclear Lock\n\n(Run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap to parse immediately, rather than relog)\nNot sure if both lock lines are needed, but I've spent long enough on this already.\n\nUsing setxkbmap works too, but doesn't have the convenience of .Xmodmap. I've tried throwing it in ~/.bash_profile, although this doesn't seem to work there.

Never. No chance.\nAs you can see in the output of file, it says ELF 32-bit LSB executable, [...] for GNU/Linux 2.6.24. ELF is the format for compiled binary executables Linux uses, and it even tells you that this program is written for a Linux kernel 2.6.24 (which seems pretty old, as well as the CPU architecture it tells... - but that's not important).\nWindows in contrast uses the PE format for compiled binary executables (known as *.exe files). And as well as you may not natively run Windows .exe files on Ubuntu/Linux, you may also not run any Ubuntu executable binaries on Windows.\nThere is wine to run Windows applications on Linux (which does not work with all software anyway, but only some programs), but I have not heard of an emulator to execute Linux programs on Windows yet. You will have to stay with that program inside your Ubuntu VM or search the internet for a Windows-compatible download.\n", "Q: mouse and keyboard unresponsive OR black screen I'm very new to Kubuntu.

I use UBUNTU GNOME OS.\nI feel like taking much time to copy large files to my usb. It takes few minutes after copied-size matches the file size.

Can I fix this..? \nPlease help to fix.. if possibe.... :-)\n\nA: Ubuntu enables Write Caching for USB media by default, Windows does not (at least in XP and 7). \nWhen using Write Chaching, your files are written to a buffer, which is then gradually written to the USB drive. If the whole file has been written to the buffer, the dialog will tell you that it has finished copying, while the OS is still busy moving the files from the buffer to the flash drive. \nThis is why you should always use the \"safely eject\" method in Ubuntu, since there might still be files in the buffer that are lost if you just unplug the flash drive.\nI do not recommend disabling this feature (although you can) because it will greatly increase the wear of your flash drives (See this discussion  for the reason why this is a bad idea).\n\nA: This happens because the data is initially copied to the buffer (which is a fast process as it involves writing to the memory) and subsequently, the buffer is written to the external device (which is a slower process owing to the fact that the write speeds are much slower).\nA good way to ensure that the disk has been written to properly before ejecting is to run the sync command in a terminal. The command exits once the buffer has been flushed, making it is safe to eject the device.\n", "Q: Does 'xinput list' 'Virtual core pointer's id is always '2'?

So if the root directory is full, won't use the home directories because they're different partitions.\nSo, I recommend to clean up, for example, old installed packages. apt always stores the downloaded packages (.deb), and maybe you could free a bit of space. And also the old kernels. I use Ubuntu Tweak to do both.\nAnother idea I have is to change the size of the root partition.\n\nA: According to \"Mounted on\" you keep \"everything interesting\" but /home and /var/log in your root partition.

Then if it's not up, default to eth0.\nBut if you've already got a cable run. why use wifi at all?

Clean install, everything fresh.  I haven't had to insert a disk until just now and I've come across a problem.  Specifically, inserting a cd or dvd into the drive does not cause Ubuntu to mount the disk automatically and display an icon in the launcher (this was the normal behaviour I experienced in 13.10).\nI've done numerous searching around trying to find similar issues and I've identified that the computer does indeed see the disk drive as I can manually mount the disk to a folder and access its contents.  What I want is to have the automatic functionality return to save me having to type the commands each time.\nInitially, my fstab was lacking any lines for the disk drive, but I've added one (which doesn't seem to work) as follows:\n/dev/scd0   /media/cdrom    udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8   0   0\n\nI got that from another thread (which.. I can no longer find >.> ) and it doesn't seem to re-enable any kind of automounting behavior.  (I've also tried it with /dev/cdrom instead of /dev/scd0 .)\nI then wondered if it was a problem from when I messed with the fstab trying to fix another problem involving automounting an encrypted swap partition (which was fixed by making the swap partition NOT encrypted) so I went to another install of 14.04 LTS that I had access to that hadn't had any changes made to the fstab yet.  I found that that install ALSO lacked any lines referencing cd / dvd rom explicitly (but it had a couple of ID lines; I figured they were the boot and drive mounts).  So it seems to be that automounting is a problem for 14.04 LTS?  I'm not sure.\nAnyways, I'd like to know if anyone has any idea how to get the original functionality back?  All I want is to be able to insert a disk and have it automatically mount to a directory (and, if possible, pin the cd file access to the launcher like it does for other external media: usb, SD card; they work properly, btw).  I think the default location for the mount is to show up in the /media/<user>/ dependent on who is logged in at the moment.  Any idea on a fix?  Thanks in advance.\nEDIT: I should not that /dev/scd0 does not exist on my system.  /dev/cdrom points to /dev/sr0 .\n\nA: Welp... I solved my own problem.\nsudo mkdir /media/cdrom0\n\nAnd, add the following line to fstab:\n/dev/sr0    /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8   0   0\n\nEverything returns to normal.  For some reason it was mounted and broken somehow.. Not sure.  Anyways, running a umount on the drive first and reinserting after several system restarts fixed the problem.  I guess that means it's solved. :P\n", "Q: Running lubuntu 14.04, easiest, fool proof way, to create a desktop shortcut and to execute sh file from desktop?

Thanks.\nEDIT: \nand in gnome-terminal\n\nEDIT2: only happens on a 4k display.\n\nA: It's quite possible that one in the 'package' is a little funky and may not be the font you actually want, which was the case with me. So, I solved this by manually installing the font in my user space.  Note that I prefer Inconsolata-dz to pure Inconsolata, if only because of straight format single and double quotes.\n\nFirst, let's set up the directory we need.  mkdir -p /home/$USER/.local/share/fonts/.  We'll put the font here for use.\nSecondly, download the font.  Here and here (Google Fonts) are such download locations.\nFinally, get the font file out of the downloaded files (probably it's inside a ZIP file), and put it into /home/$USER/.local/share/fonts/.  That will make it available to your user for use.\n", "Q: Can't install gksu. Says it can't find it Can't install gksu every time I put in the command to install I get the same thing\nunable to locate package gksu\nany ideas\n\nA: When you go to the developer site it states: gksu is being replaced by PolicyKit, please take a look at http://live.gnome.org/gksu (link dead; see https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/gksu ). It says there ...\n\ngksu\ngksu is a library and application used to ask the user for passwords\n  to run programs as root. It is not a good option now that we have\n  PolicyKit. Still, we still have applications which are not written to\n  take advantage of the PolicyKit framework, and since making\n  applications use it usually involves structural changes, a new version\n  of gksu will provide functionality similar to the one provided by the\n  current gksu to cover applications which still haven't been patched to\n  use PolicyKit. The new gksu will use PolicyKit as backend, instead of\n  su and sudo. This page intends to work as a notebook for\n  planning/designing that new version.\nShow me the code\nCode is being written, and you can fetch it by using git:\n$ git clone git://git.debian.org/~kov/gksu-polkit.git/\n\nGeneral Architecture\nThe new gksu will be composed of three parts:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*an activable dbus system service able to run programs as root or other users, using PolicyKit to enforce policy\n  \n*a library providing a simple API that talks to this service an application that is client of the above library, and allows people to\n  \n*run programs in a way similar to the one they are able to do with current gksu\n  \n\nSo if you want the newest version use the above.\nOtherwise check Ubuntu software center, open up Universe, update the sources and you can install it from either USC...\n\n... or from command line with\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\n\nA: Maybe pkexec is what you searching for:\npkexec --user root program\n\n", "Q: SSH connection refused/error message I have a setup of systems, where each system has multiple users but only one user is allowed to login to a system at a time through SSH. \nI am using \"passwd  -l/-u\" command to lock and unlock users, and allow only one user at a time.\nWhat I need is to tell the other users trying to SSH to a system why they cannot SSH.

I was recently reminded of one of the things I didn't like about nVidia cards & Linux.  I've installed 3-4 of them over the years in different machines (different cards, driver versions), and every one of them did the same thing to me:\nAfter installing the proprietary driver (the open-source is fine), the virtual consoles (1-6) no longer work.  (The problem was mentioned in this question, but a permanent solution was not the asker's priority.)\nUpon switching to a text console, the monitor(s) no longer receive a signal from the video card.*  Pressing Ctrl-F7 brings back the X console.\n*In my current configuration, 2 of the monitors shut down but the 3rd displays a text screen with \n\nUbuntu 15.04\n .  .  .  .\n\nEDIT:\nsometimes the above message is replaced with an additional console message, like\n\n[    0.490534] ACPI PCC probe failed.\nstarting version 219\n_\n\nAlso interesting in the current setup is that when I switch back to #7, I usually get a dialog box \"Authentication is required to update SMART data from...(/dev/sda)  I'm only 90% sure this happened at the same time as the card & driver install.\nI verified that /sbin/agetty processes are running for tty1-5.\nBased on my own luck, I'd assume that it was a universal problem, but I sure haven't heard it discussed as if it were.\nAny thoughts on how to get text consoles back without getting rid of nVidia's driver?\n\nA: Apparently, the current version of the driver on this card does not clone the console screen on all monitors, but instead displays it only on one, powering down the other two.\nAdding nomodeset to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT parameters (so the line reads, for example, GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\") in /etc/default/grub (and then running sudo update-grub) fixed the main problem; I now have normal virtual console operation.  (I also got rid of the quiet & splash options, since there was no usable splash screen anyway, only a blank screen during most of the boot process.)\n(Note that this solution does not do anything to help the problem of the \"Authentication is required to update SMART data...\" dialog appearing most of the time after switching back to X from text.)\n", "Q: What's the command to type a phrase? I'm trying to bind a certain key combination that types my E-Mail. I want it so that when I press a certain key combination, it types a certain phrase (my E-Mail). \nBasically- I need a command that types a certain phrase when ran.\n\nA: 1. The command to type a phrase\nYou can do that by using xdotool, which is not on your system by default. Install it first:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nThen the command to (literally) type a text phrase is:\nxdotool type 'This is a test to see if all works fine. If it works this text is typed.'\n\nThe text will be typed in the frontmost window.\nAdding it to a shortcut key\nChoose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command (e.g.):\nxdotool type 'This is a test to see if all works fine. If it works this text is typed.'\n\n2. Alternatively\nMore complicated is to use both xdotool and xclip, which both need to be installed:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool xclip\n\nThen the command to paste a text into the front most window would be:\nprintf 'This is a test to see if all works fine. If it works this text is typed.' | xclip -sel clip && xdotool key Control_L+v\n\nNotes on the second option\n\n\n*\n\n*Mind that this (second) option works if the front most application uses Ctrl+V to paste text, which is not the case with e.g. gnome-terminal, which uses Shift+Ctrl+V\nTherefore, the command to paste text into a terminalwindow would be:\nprintf 'This is a test to see if all works fine. If it works this text is typed.' | xclip -sel clip && xdotool key Shift_L+Control_L+v\n\n\n*If you would like to include a newline after your phrase is pasted, replace printf by echo\n", "Q: Synaptic requiring too many additional removals? I installed LLVM out of curiousity some time ago, not using it for anything specific. Today I tried removing it with Synaptic, the same way I installed it.

How to uncompress directly from terminal if I have the URL of the file?\nFor example :\nunzip www.test.com/test.zip destination-folder-on-my-pc\n\n\nA: You need more than one step:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into your destination folder\ncd destination\n\n\n*Download the file\nwget www.test.com/test.zip\n\n\n*Extract the file\nunzip test.zip\n\n\nTo use only one command use a script:\n#!/bin/bash\nwget -P \"/tmp\" \"$1\"\nfilename=$(awk -F'/' {print $NF})\nunzip \"$filename\" -d \"$2\"\nrm \"/tmp/$filename\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open an editor to create a new file called unzip_by_url and put it either in ~/bin or /usr/bin/local\nnano unzip_by_url\n\n\n*And paste the code above.\n\n*Save and close and\n\n*Make the file executable\nchmod +x /path/to/file/unzip_by_url\n\n\n*Now start the script with:\nunzip_by_url www.test.com/test.zip destination-folder-on-my-pc\n\n\nA: If unzip would have adhered to the pipes and filters architectural style characteristic of Unix, then one would expect to be able to do this by piping the output of wget into the input of unzip:\nwget -O - http://www.test.com/test.zip | (cd destination-folder && unzip -)\n\nWhere the the dash after -O means standard output, the dash after unzip means standard input and the parenthesised right hand side starts a subshell in the correct directory.\nHowever the ZIP format stores its contents index at the end of the file, and unzip needs to read this before it can start decompressing. So, contrary to gzip et al, it cannot decompress a stream in one pass.\nAs a workaround you need a temporary file:\nwget -O /tmp/z.$$ http://www.test.com/test.zip && \n   (cd destination-folder && unzip /tmp/z.$$)\n\nWhere the $$ are just used to generate a non-colliding number.\nInstead of running the subshell, you could use the -d option of unzip. And for added hygiene, clean up your temporary file:\nwget -O /tmp/z.$$ http://www.test.com/test.zip && \n   unzip -d destination-folder /tmp/z.$$ &&\n   rm /tmp/z.$$\n\n", "Q: Software center is not working with proxy I edited the /etc/apt/apt.conf with\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://071.12106en068:password@10.1.1.19:80/\";    \nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://071.12106en068:password@10.1.1.19:80/\";\n\nsame with ftp\nwhere 071.12106en068 is my id.

When I attempt to install ubuntu on my desktop tower, or any linux os, It attempts maybe the first 2 seconds of the install then freezes.\nThere is a huge error message screen that just spits out stuff much, much faster than I can read any of it.\nWhat I have tried so far\n\n\n*\n\n*Using two different USB install drives\n\n*Pretty much any and ever ubuntu version, as well as the latest: Arch, Debian, Linux mint and manjaro.\n\n*Changing the ISO a multitude of times.\n\n*All the recommendations when a black screen normally appears (noacpi off and all that stuff, in a multitude of different combinations).\n\n*Using both USB 2.0 and 3.0, for every single port on my computer.\n\n\nAt this point, I simply do not know what to do. I normally never ask questions on stackexchange or the like seeing as 999/1000 someone has run into the issue before. A few installations ago, I was attempting to install Ubuntu and I believe after about eight attempts I managed to spot the error message \"Softlock up on CPU#N for X seconds\". Random cpu, random amount of seconds. Haven't seen that in a while.\nWhat is infuriating is I don't want to dual boot, I just want to be completely rid of windows. My computer currently has windows 8.1 installed on the ssd boot disk. It actually used to have ubuntu originally when I first built the computer but I installed windows over it so that I could play games, however the compelling work environment that linux offers for development has brought me back over to wanting it as my primary OS again.\nAdditionally, the only thing that has changed in the computer has been the fact that I added a GTX 780 to the build. Nothing else. It worked prior with that installed too. \nIf you guys want any other information, I'd be more than willing to provide it as I am absolutely at my wit's end at this point.\nFurther info\nPretty much the only button at the boot-install screen that doesn't result in a black screen with a tiny purple bar on the far left is the memory test screen. This did not happen before, it's actually letting me run a memory test this time so I'm letting that run. So far so good.\n\nA: I fixed the same problem by doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*at the grub menu choose install Ubuntu and press e to edit.\n\n*look for line that start with linux add acpi=off between quiet and splash.\n\n*then press F10 to execute the grub command.\n\n*now you are able to install Ubuntu but if you use a touchpad it will be disabled and you need to use a mouse instead.\n\n*after the install you need to restart and you need to repeat everything above when you are starting Ubuntu in grub.\n\n\nthen finally when Ubuntu is started do this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-364\n\nAfter this reboot the system.\nGood luck, hope it helps for you as well. \n", "Q: postgresql installation damaged I installed postgresql using following command on 25th following instruction on (help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL)\nsudo apt-get install postgres postgresql-contrib\n\nIt was working fine.

After I did an update to 3.19.0-22 I could no longer boot and the only way to boot was to hit Esc, get the list of kernels and choose 3.19.0-20 or lower.\nThis morning I installed 3.19.0-23 and again it won't boot. The list of bad kernels has 3 bad kernels and is still growing. This is scary to say the least and I need a solution.\nOne solution might be to format my disk and start over. This is clearly painful as all programs which I have will be lost. There is also the problem that perhaps there really is something wrong with these kernels for my given laptop. (On this computer they obviously work fine or I couldn't write this message.)\nPlease look at the bug for more details, but I really would appreciate some serious help to get my laptop back on line like a \"normal\" computer.\nThanks,\nIlan\n\nA: I too had the same problem and it had to do with BIOS settings.\nThe good news is that you do not need to worry about data loss.  You can take a disk image with clonezilla:\nhttp://clonezilla.org/\ngo into your BIOS and delete any unused boot managers, check your disk for errors and then see if the bug happens again.  If it does, clone your disk and sanitize it, then re-install.\nThat is what worked for me.  Of course you will want to ensure that your disk is working correctly and that your BIOS is correctly configured before you do anything...\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on MacBook (8,2 early 2015) - No keyboard or touchpad I received a brand new MacBook this afternoon that my company purchased for me against my will. I have no intention to use OSX, though I'm dual-booting it with Ubuntu rather than single booting it so my boss won't have a fit.\nAnyway, it was incredibly infuriating to try to install this; I'm used to a simple BIOS and just inserting a bootable flash drive, done. After a while I did manage to get rEFInd to work, and it now loads on boot and allows me to select a USB device to load. I select the Linux option and am sent to GRUB, so far so good!\nUnfortunately, whether I select \"Try Ubuntu\" or \"Install Ubuntu\", the installer starts up or the LiveCD system initializes just fine...but I have no mouse or touchpad.\nSadly, thanks to the stupidest design I've ever seen, the single USB-C port is taken up with the stupid adapter thing for my bootable USB stick....I can't just attach another input device like I would for a more sane system.\nI'm at a loss and finally calling it a night. Really hoping you guys have some ideas about how to get by this roadblock. Thanks!\n\nA: Do you get to the point where you can interact with a desktop environment (e.g., Gnome or KDE)? If so, open the dash (not sure what default keyboard shortcut is, either alt/option or command key), type in terminal, and select the terminal icon with arrows.  In the terminal, check if touchpad is turned on with synclient -l | grep TouchpadOff.  If this option is set to 1, then change it to 0 or 2 with synclient TouchpadOff=0.  Check here for more details/options on synclient, and this post to make change permanent.\n\nA: I have the new MacBook 8,1. I also have rEFInd installed perfectly with a nice theme too. Disabled SIP, made some proper partition space with gdisk, and I ended up with the same exact thing. I have a Belkin USB-C hub (without charging capabilities) and it has two USB-c ports and two USB-A ports. I'll be trying to add a USB keyboard and then a mouse later and see if anything changes. Honestly though, I think this is a driver issue and will be still effected with any keyboard unless already detected by Ubuntu some how. I'll also try browsing the grub terminal to see what's up and maybe try to install grub2 while I'm at it. \nI'm just here to give you a heads up on the situation like a lab rat. Sorry that I wasn't able to immediately help, but I will be replying with any feedback I've obtained whilst experimenting. PS: Make a BIOS Boot Partition with gdisk and try staying out of a messy hybrid MBR kind of situation.\nMy BIOS enabled keyboard was recognizable after the installation and try Ubuntu. The Belkin 2 USB-a ports both work for this installation. I did not completely follow through with the keyboard only installation, but I think it is doable. From there I would try enabling the keyboard/trackpad or hunting down some drivers. P.S. - if you aren't extremely familiar with the Ubuntu shortcuts then I would print some off while in OS X before continuing.\n", "Q: not able to uninstall postsql-xc Postgressql installation was broken once I installed postgres-xc and postgres-xc-client.

I have bought the Fluendo DVD player software a while ago because it always was the only software capable of playing all the DVDs I had on my computer. But this program seems to have been quietly abandoned: Software center tells me \"not available for your current Ubuntu version. Please contact your vendor for an update.\" However the info page for that software does not even show a vendor!\nI find this very frustrating especially since some DVDs which have worked fine with Fluendo cannot be played with alternatives like SMPlayer or Xine any more. \nFor me, another small detail that made Ubuntu worse. :(\nIs there any other proper DVD player program which can properly handle all the various copy-protected DVDs out there, which all play fine on consumer DVD players or Windows computers with purchased player programs? \n\nA: Install the Ubuntu Restricted Extras package.\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras \n\nIf you are running Kubuntu or Xubuntu then install kubuntu-restricted-extras or xubuntu-restricted-extras instead. \nAnd then run this script. \nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\nSource: Ubuntu Restricted Formats\n", "Q: Change default permission 664 for downloaded files I have noticed that all downloaded files, either via Firefox or wget get permission of 664 (rw-rw-r--). This makes me run additional step via chmod when I want to use these files via another tool, like Gimp.\nIs there a way that I change this permission to 774?\n\nA: You should not change that. No file that you load from the Internet should be executable by default. This is a too high security risk.\nIf you really want this … Permanently set file and folder permission for a user\n\nIf you want to execute the file, you should always change the rights manually. No editing application needs rights to execute a file. Especially no image editing program. In the case of plugins, read the part above again. ;)\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on Toshiba Satellite c850-19z My computer is using UEFI and is running Windows 8.\nI've tried install Ubuntu before but I only got as far as putting it on a USB\n(using universal USB installer). But when I go to the boot manager on UEFI and put the USB port first before my hard-drive nothing happens and it just boots back into Windows 8.\n\nA: This sounds like a case of Secure Boot, which is a security mechanism added by hardware vendors in collaboration with Microsoft to only allowed the system to boot from approved ISO images.\nThis mechanism can be a challenge when a user wants to install Ubuntu. Solutions depend on the UEFI in use, but it might entail disabling Secure Boot inside UEFI and then try again.\nBe aware though that making changes in the BIOS is not without risk. If you decide to do it, it is a very good idea to write every changed setting down to be able to set it back afterwards.\n\nA: As Zilvador says, this could be a Secure Boot issue; however, Ubuntu should support Secure Boot, so I suspect that one of two other things is happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*Improperly-created USB drive -- Assuming no changes to a stock computer, you'll need a USB drive with an EFI boot loader installed on it (including Ubuntu's Secure Boot tool, which is called Shim). Some tools for creating bootable USB drives won't copy these files, though, or will copy them only when certain options are set. Thus, you might need to try another tool, or change the options in the tool you're using.\n\n*Wrong option selected in boot manager -- Most EFI boot managers (the displays you see when you hit a function key to choose what medium to boot) show two options for removable disks. One option includes the string \"UEFI\" and the other doesn't. These boot in EFI mode and in BIOS mode, respectively. Depending on firmware settings and how you prepared the disk, you might need to select one boot mode or the other -- EFI mode, if you want to install alongside Windows that's also in EFI mode. If you select the wrong mode, the disk might fail to boot, especially if it lacks the boot loader for the mode you chose (see the preceding point).\n\n\nA: I recommend you to use this tool to create a bootable USB. Make sure to select GPT partition scheme for UEFI comuters on second field. \n", "Q: QT version update I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 and I've noticed that the system Qt libraries in /usr/lib/... have the version 4.8.1. Now this version of Qt is quite old and many important updates and bugfixes have been released meanwhile.\nI'd like to ask whether there is a possibility to update these system libraries and if there is a tutorial how to do it - I'd need at least the version 4.8.4.\n\nA: In general the bugfixes are backported to your Qt release running on 12.04. So if you are running an up to date version, all fixes should be in -- even version number might not have changed. You can see details inside ChangeLog from package information site. This might be confusing, but caused by packagaging and it's dependencies.\n", "Q: How do I remap the caps lock key to the backspace key? I have grown very comfortable to my Colemak keyboard layout (my typing speed has doubled since I started using it). My only problem with it is that there is no caps lock key because under this layout because the caps lock key is a second backspace key. I really miss caps lock so I would like to change the backspace key on the top right corner of my keyboard  (not the one right next to the \"a\") into a caps lock key. Is there a way to do this using xmodmap or some other tool? I am using Xfce.\n\nA: I figured it out. This link was very helpful: https://butterflyofdream.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/how-to-assign-capslock-on-backspace-key-in-colemak/ \nChanging the backspace key to a caps lock key is as simple as typing this on the console:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 22 = Caps_Lock\"\n\n\nA: The answer should be\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 66 = BackSpace\"\n\nAnd to revert the action\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 66 = Caps_Lock\"\n\n\nA: Edit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/de (where /de is your language) and add this section in the first block, that you use in your language:\n        # replace Caps with Backspace\n        key <CAPS> { [ BackSpace            ] };\n\nBut I would recommend better to replace it with AltGr and them map AltGr+f to backspace:\n        # replace Caps with AltGr\n        key <CAPS> { [ ISO_Level3_Shift            ] };\n        # Add Backspace to AltGr+f\n        key <AC04> { [ f, F, BackSpace, BackSpace  ] };\n\nSo you can add more useful shortcuts like here: Configure Caps Lock as AltGr and Arrows like in vim\n\nA: In Gnome, KDE, Mate etc keyboard advanced settings there should be an option for that.

I had the exact same problem with a Nvidia Quadro K2200 card. \nIs there a way to install either of these two cards using some PPT or whatever works because the official nvidia drivers as of today won't do the job.\n\nA: If you did a kernel upgrade then @Zilvador answer may be good for you.\nIf not the issue is the driver from Nvidia's site as there linux support is rubbish (but getting better thanks to steam).\nBoot the system and press ctrl+alt+f1 to get a terminal, log in and remove the driver like this\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nThen use the one from the Ubuntu repos that is tested\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-common-updates\n\nThis one should work great with your card.\n\nA: Install the drivers this way\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352\nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\n\nA: Did you by any chance have a kernel upgrade since you installed the driver? I have a similar graphic card and I have the same issues when upgrading the kernel, meaning that I need to install the driver again every time.\nYou probably know the installation procedure, but I will write it here below. Unfortunately NVIDIA requires that the graphic user interface is not running while installing it, so it will be necessary to log out of the computer first. Steps described below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out of your Ubuntu session (or boot the computer)\n\n*When at the login screen, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. It will switch to a command line interface.\n\n*Write your Ubuntu user name followed by password to log in \n\n*Write sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm stop\n\n*Now you can install the driver. Write cd /path/to/installer followed by sudo chmod +x NVIDIA*\n\n*Install the driver by typing sudo sh NVIDIA*. It will take you to an installation wizard, where you have to click your way through.\n\n*When you're done, go back to the login screen by pressing sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm start\nAs said, unfortunately this has to be done after every kernel upgrade as it is now. That is how far Linux support from NVIDIA goes right now.\n", "Q: Can I create a bootable Windows 7 installation USB from within Ubuntu to boot a 2010 model iMac? I have a 2010 model iMac on which I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 as the sole OS.\nI would like to install Windows 7 as a dual boot. I have freed up some space on the HDD.\nNo matter what I try, I am unable to boot the iMac from either a Windows 7 USB or a Windows 7 DVD.\nIs this possible at all? What do I need to do to create a bootable Windows 7 installation USB for the iMac?\nSo far I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Brasero to burn the ISO image to a DVD - could not boot from this DVD\n\n*Using UNetbootin to create a bootable USB from an ISO image (as well as modifying the boot folder on the USB to add a bootx64.efi file) - could not boot from this USB.\n\n\nUnique issues for this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows 7 and not Windows 8\n\n*Install Windows 7 on an iMac\n\n*Install Windows 7 in UEFI mode\n\n*Tried the USB method mentioned in another question - iMac cannot boot from the USB\n\n\nA: Booting Windows 7 in EFI mode on a Mac is tricky at best. (Note UEFI is EFI 2.x, but Macs' EFIs are all 1.x versions, so Macs technically don't have UEFIs.) There's a very long thread on MacRumors about this subject:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/threads/win7-x64-booting-natively-via-efi-no-bios-emulation.696523/\nTo boil this thread down, some people have successfully installed and booted Windows 7 on some Macs in EFI mode. The procedures for doing so are often convoluted, and most people who attempt it fail. At least, that's my impression from the last time I reviewed it, which was over a year ago. Perhaps somebody's made a breakthrough since then.\nWindows 8 is much easier to get working on Macs in EFI mode, but even it doesn't always works. I haven't been keeping track of details of which models work best in EFI mode.\nDual- or triple-booting Windows 7 on a Mac is most easily done in BIOS mode. In fact, given a Windows/Linux dual-boot on a Mac (with no OS X), by far the easiest solution is to boot both OSes in BIOS mode. If you were starting from scratch, I'd say to create an MBR partition table, boot Windows 7 in BIOS mode, install it, and then boot and install Ubuntu in BIOS mode. Maintaining an EFI-mode boot on a Mac without OS X poses some challenges because Apple has deviated from the usual EFI boot procedures, so tools like Ubuntu's efibootmgr may not work quite right; you really need OS X's bless utility to properly manage the EFI boot process. Going with a strictly BIOS-mode setup bypasses these problems.\n", "Q: I want to fully switch to Ubuntu Right now I have windows and Ubuntu on my laptop. I don't use Windows anymore. But it still has the majority of my hard drive space. How do I fully switch to Ubuntu. Also. It is apparently badly corrupted, someone told me. \nHere is my screen shot of gparted\n\n\nA: Best option to remove windows and expand Ubuntu is, boot to a live Ubuntu DVD/USB, and run \nsudo gparted\n\nNow right click your windows partition and delete it so it is empty space (back up anything you need first as it is now gone) and click the green tick to apply.\nNow you can right click on the Ubuntu partition and choose resize/move here you can expand Ubuntu in to the rest of the blank space.\nNow just click the green tick to apply the partition and wait for it to finish, (could take a while) and Ubuntu will be the only OS with all the space.\nYou may also need to reinstall grub depending on where you had it installed, from a live DVD/USB open a terminal and run\nsudo grub install /dev/sda\n\nAssuming your Ubuntu drive is sda.\nIn the event you still can't boot, use boot-repair, to fix grub\n\nA: The easiest approach would be: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your important data from Ubuntu and Windows\n\n*Do a complete new installation including Windows disc spaces\n\n", "Q: Do I \"need\" DKMS? My Ubuntu based distro came with some VirtualBox stuff preinstalled, so I uninstalled it and it autoremoved DKMS package.\nFrom what I saw, it looks like useful package, but do I need it? Stuff like VirtualBox and CDemu installs it on its own, and Ubuntu doesn't ship with it installed by default, so I guess It's \"needed\" only by some programs which installs modules or something.\nI am not a long GNU/Linux user, so I have no experience much, I don't even have an experience with compiling.\nNow I have a Linux kernel update pending, but I don't know if I should update it without DKMS installed.\n\nA: Short answer: If you want to use Vitualbox also after kernel update, you will need DKMS as well as kernel headers fitting your kernel.\nLong answer: This system helps you to compile drivers (aka kernel modules) so they can run with your current kernel. \nIf you don't recompile a modul, it will happen that the modul canot be loaded and therefor the function provided by it will not be avaialble anymore. \nIn your case: If you don't recompile virtual box modules, Virtualbox willnot be available after update. It will start, but cannot start any VM. \n\nA: Ubuntu will boot fine without DKMS.\nIf anything you use depended on DKMS but didn't have it as a Depends: in its packaging, you'll notice and you can reinstall DKMS and file a bug.\nDKMS is for packages that provide a kernel module in source form (or binary with a source wrapper), so they don't have to update the module for every kernel rebuild.  The standard kernel itself always works, regardless of DKMS or not.\n\nA: If you do not have dkms modules installed, you do not need the dkms package.\nIt is not installed by default in Ubuntu.\nWhen you install some proprietary drivers, like Nvidia, AMD or Broadcom, dkms package is automatically installed too.\nTo check if you have any dkms modules you can run\ndkms status\n\nIf the dkms is not installed, this command will not work, but you can look into /var/lib/dkms/ directory.\nSources of dkms packages are stored in /usr/src/\n\nA: I guess you've looked into DKMS a little already, it's used for updating kernel modules which are outside of the normal kernel source. Often it's drivers and packages like VirtualBox that need DKMS. You may not necessarily 'need' DKMS, but it's handy to have installed, especially if you have installed extra packages, although not having it installed won't ruin your kernel upgrade.\nThere's more info about DKMS here, and a useful answer on ask ubuntu here.\n", "Q: Canonical landscape custom graph script needs interpeter Okay so i am completely new to Landscape but i am starting to love it!\nI want to create a graph that runs the following command:\nnetstat -an | grep -c 8105\n\nWhich will return a number of how many is connected to my servers socket!\nSo i pressed new graph:\n\nSadly as you can see from the picture i get the script needs interpeter\nI am not sure what that means or how i get it to execute my command.\nSo i was hoping someone here could help me out and have tried it before?\n\nA: I believe it's asking you for a #!/bin/bash to tell it to run a bash script. \nIn the terminal, you are already running bash. When you run a command in a terminal it runs a bash command. To run bash commands as a script, you usually include a header that specifies the interpreter.\nUse this instead:\n#!/bin/bash\nnetstat -an | grep -c 8105\n\nIf that doesn't work, use this instead:\n/bin/bash -c netstat -an | grep -c 8105\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang\n", "Q: watch cuts off ps aux output when piped While working on a (Python) script which is of no consequence here, I have come across a very strange behavior involving watch and ps aux, when the latter is piped to something else.\nI have managed to reduce the issue down to a single line. When running\nwatch \"ps aux | grep 'ps aux'\"\n\nin a terminal, you usually get several lines of output, as is expected. \n\nNote that the top three lines are cut off, and just barely fit ps aux at the end. When you reduce the size of your terminal to where it does not fit any more, it is cut from the results completely.\n\nThis means that grep only receives the cut off output. What I find most baffling about this is the extremely limited scope for which this happens. It does not happen for either of \nps aux | grep \"ps aux\"\nwatch \"ps u -C ps\"\nwatch \"ssh localhost 'ps aux | grep \\\"ps aux\\\"'\"\n\nIn all of these cases, the list wraps around as expected. \nThis seems to be the case for both bash and sh, on Ubuntu 15.04.\nWhile I managed to work around this issue in my script, does anyone have an explanation for this behavior? \n\nA: Nasal demons.1\nman ps says (emphasis mine):\ncomm       COMMAND   command name (only the executable name).\n                     Modifications to the command name will not be\n                     shown.

I have LAMP server installed on my system and it is working perfectly. However, I am very curious to know why we need not start Apache server in LAMP. When we have WAMP on Windows, by contrast, we have to start it and activate Apache and MySQL. Does Apache start as we start Ubuntu (i.e., it always runs in the background) or does it start when we open localhost?\nThe answers to the question \"Manually Start LAMP Server\" describe how to start LAMP manually, but not how it works internally to start LAMP automatically.\n\nA: Linux in general, so Ubuntu too, has directories where you can put scripts that start/stop/restart/reload a service (or whatever action this service can provide): /etc/init.d/ (=old but still used very often).\n\n/etc/init.d is where all the traditional sysvinit scripts and the backward compatible scripts for upstart live. The backward compatible scripts basically run service myservice start instead of doing anything themselves. Some just show a notice to use the service command. \n\n/etc/init.d$ ls\napache2             glibc.sh               mysql          screen-cleanup\napparmor            halt                   mysql-ndb      sendsigs\n...\n\nAs an example, the start of the apache2 script (all the others will be similar in style):\n$ more apache2\n#!/bin/sh -e\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides:          apache2\n# Required-Start:    $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog\n# Required-Stop:     $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog\n# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5\n# Default-Stop:      0 1 6\n# Short-Description: Start/stop apache2 web server\n### END INIT INFO\n#\n# apache2               This init.d script is used to start apache2.\n#                       It basically just calls apache2ctl.\n\nENV=\"env -i LANG=C PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin\"\n\n...\n\nThere is also /etc/init (=upstart): \n\n/etc/init is where the upstart init configs live. While they are not scripts themselves, they essentially execute whatever is required to replace sysvinit scripts. \n\ncups - CUPS Printing spooler and server\n\ndescription     \"CUPS printing spooler/server\"\nauthor          \"Michael Sweet <msweet@apple.com>\"\n\nstart on (filesystem\n          and (started dbus or runlevel [2345]))\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 3 12\n\n\nSo basically inside these scripts/configuration it is stated what other service needs to be started before this service can be started and what service needs to have stopped before this service can be stopped. \n\nDoes Apache start as we start Ubuntu (i.e., it always runs in the background) or does it start when we open localhost?\n\nWhen you install a service like apache (or mysql (databaseserver) or cups (print server)) it generally also includes a startup script AND this is also activated (since the assumption is: if installed you want it running). \nSo the answer is: it is always running and not started when you access an URL (ie. http://localhost). \nIt is by the way also possible to stop a service, remove the auto-start from /etc/init.d/ and manually start that service. \nThere are 2 session managers that take care of this: old Ubuntu (ie. <15.10) uses upstart. New Ubuntu (>15.10) uses systemd.\n\n\n*\n\n*Upstart would be service start apache2 or service stop apache2.\n\n*Systemd would be systemctl start apache2 or systemctl start apache2 but also supports the method Upstart uses on Debian/Ubuntu systems.\n\n", "Q: PHP file doens't reload I'm running a lamp server to develop php. Everything was just working fine until I tried my script.

Connect from Ubuntu to Windows\nTo connect the other way, you need to have the telnet client installed on Ubuntu.

I know there are tons of documents online talking about hardware enablement stack, I also know the theory for LTS to get more closer kernel and X library, so does it means I CAN NOT install kernel beyond 3.13.x on 14.04 LTS platform unless I install HWE stack? I am trying to understand in detail of the steps before execute upgrade on production servers. Also, does HWE stack cause conflict on packages or kernel module? \nI also tested install kernel using \"apt-get install linux-image-3.19.0-18-generic\", it render unbootable system and have to rescue by boot into 3.13.x older kernel and remove it, this cause confusion, if I could see on apt-get, should I be able to install new kernel without making my system unbootable? \n\nA: You can install kernel 3.16 by running\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-utopic\n\nor kernel 3.19\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\nThis will install meta packages and the selected kernel major version will get updates using normal sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade routine.\nWhy did you install an old 3.19.0-18?

Due to conflicts between the plugins I decided to install both of these versions separately, which works perfectly fine except one little issue. I am working with Ubuntu-Gnome (14.04 LTS) and I edited the .desktop file of one version like this: \n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Custom Eclipse \nIcon=custom-icon\nPath=/opt/custom-eclipse/\nExec=/opt/custom-eclipse/custom-eclipse\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=custom-eclipse\n\nNow, what bugs me is the following:\nThe application starts up with the custom name, WM_Class and icon as expected, yet, when the application has finished starting up these attributes change for some reason and it is grouped with the other eclipse installation by the gnome-shell.\nIf I enter xprop WM_CLASS in terminal and click on the window it returns WM_CLASS(STRING) = \"Eclipse\", \"Eclipse\". \nedit:\nI just recently switched from a Unity desktop to a GNOME shell and using Unity the windows were not grouped together.\nanother edit:\nI updated my ubuntu version to 15.04 and my gnome-shell to 3.14.4 but unfortunately the problem remains. I am starting to think that this could only be fixed by editing the Eclipse source code...\n\nA: StartupWMClass does not change the actual application window class, but only tells the desktop manager what window class should use to identify the application window(s).\nThe problem is that Eclipse uses Eclipse as window class despite its version.\nIf you want to use more than one Eclipse version at once and have windows grouped correctly, with the ability to pin the application icon as favorite, you should edit the plugin.xml of package you are using.\nFor Eclipse Java EE IDE I succesfully edited the plugin.xml in\n<eclipse-root>/plugins/org.eclipse.epp.package.jee_<current-version>\nchanging the properties\nplugin/extension/product/@name\nplugin/extension/product/property[@name=appName]/@value\n\n(not sure wich one is enough) to whatever value you prefer. The same value you should put in .desktop file as StartupWMClass.\n\nA: I assume, it's not an answer but you could test my desktop files. Both files start Eclipse Mars in an Ubuntu 15.04 with a GNOME 3.16 environment.\nWith tis desktop files, I have two running instances which are not grouped.\ncat ~/.local/share/applications/opt_eclipse_cpp.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Eclipse C++\nComment=Eclipse Integrated Development Environment\nIcon=eclipse\nExec=/opt/eclipse-cpp/eclipse/eclipse\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=Eclipse-CPP\n\ncat ~/.local/share/applications/opt_eclipse.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Eclipse JEE\nComment=Eclipse Integrated Development Environment\nIcon=eclipse\nExec=/opt/eclipse-jee/eclipse/eclipse\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=Eclipse-Java\n\n\nBut\nxprop WM_CLASS\n\ngives\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"Eclipse\", \"Eclipse\"\n\nthat's true\n\nA: StartupWMClass is only used to group windows with the same class name. You need to look at changing the class with the exec command if the program supports gtk options.\nI've just been trying this with browsers running in app mode, currently class option is not working in chrome or chromium so I used Epiphany.

I don't have detailed documentation on how to do it, but I provide an outline in my answer to this question:\n32-Bit UEFI Boot Support\nEither way you do it will involve significant hoop-jumping. My own preference is to stick with the bit depth of the EFI, unless you have a compelling reason to do otherwise.\n\nA: Install a 64 bit system.  This gives you the option of upgrading your RAM at any point in the future.\nIt also allows you to install 64 bit software which would otherwise not work on a 32 bit system.\n\nA: You can get it done but it takes a bit of work.\nFirst you need to make a live USB of your wanted Ubuntu 64bit version (Xubuntu would be best) but it must have persistence.\nThe easiest way to make this is to use the startup disk creator on an Ubuntu 14.04 Live USB.\nOnce you have your USB with persistence you need to add this file to the /EFI/BOOT directory of the flash drive.\nThen you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your USB drive into the device\n\n*Start up the device\n\n*Go into the BIOS of the device and disable secure boot, save and exit\n\n*Boot off the USB drive\n\n\nIt should boot into the expected Live USB environment.\nOnce done, plug in a internet connection (I use my android phone with USB tethering).\nThen install the distro onto the device making sure to select the options to install third party software and download updates.\nAs you have an internet connection while installing it will automatically install 32bit EFI grub for you.\nAfter it is all installed you should be able to boot directly onto the device but you may need to do additional work to get wifi, bluetooth, and sound working.\n", "Q: Why does Lubuntu 14.04 Kernel Panic on boot when Notebook is connected to AC Power, but not when on battery since Ubuntu kernel 3.13.0-59 (or possibly even -58) Lubuntu kernel panics on Acer Travelmate B115-M when the device is connected to AC, but not when it's starts with battery only. \nOlder kernels still work fine. \nit seems to panic while setting cpu governor policy - I see there might be a connection, but I have no BIOS-options to change anything about the behaviour.

I would like to be able to go anywhere (google chrome, sublime text editor, etc), then highlight + right click on some text, then click a custom right-click-menu button which will run a python script with the highlighted text as input. Is there any tool to do this in Ubuntu 14.04+?\nI am aware of Nautilus, however Nautilus right-click commands don't seem to show up on google chrome or sublime text editor, and also I am not aware of any way Nautilus can pass highlighted text as input to a python script.\nIt would be quite useful to have this capacity, as it would let me automate some tedious aspects of my work-flow, so I wonder if there is a right tool for the job?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Another usage of xclip\nThe solution below uses xclip. xclip is not on your system by default, you will have to install it:\nsudo apt-get install xclip\n\nIn its simplest form, you could do it in a very short script with the help of xclip. When we use the xclip -o command, the currently selected text is used to output, or as man xclip mentions:\n   -o, -out\n          print the selection to standard out (generally for piping to a\n          file or program)\n\nUsing this, we can easily use the selected text to do anything, e.g.\n#!/bin/bash\n# get the currently selected text\ntext=$(xclip -o)\n# print the selection into a file in your home directory\necho $text > ~/xclip_output.txt\n# opening a file with the selected text as a title, in the current working directory\ngedit \"$text\"\n\nor, in your case:\n<script> \"$text\"\n\nIf this exactly matches what you need depends on what you are actually doing with the input text.

When plugging the USB cable, the device does not shows up on the desktop (there must be a camera icon with the name of the phone), it not seems to be detected correctly.\nI have also access to Ubuntu 12.04 (on my Desktop PC). The phone works fine with that. Double clicking it's icon displays the folder structure inside the phone and I can access my files on the phone.\nAny advice how to get the phone working with Lubuntu 14.10. Where to start troubleshooting?\n\nA: Great, so you’re a Linuxer and got a Windows Phone. Congratulations. :)\nAnyway … before we get to the point, here’s some background on USB: When you create a USB connection, the hardware will first “negotiate” the relationship between the device (your phone) and the host (your laptop).\nUSB defines various classes for devices. The Linux kernel ships modules to support many of them. Android devices for example usually have the ability to announce themselves as mass storage devices and can be mounted in the same way as a USB drive.\nHowever, the module supporting the USB class has to be loaded (which is done automatically in *Ubuntu), and the device is expect to behave according to the specification – which many devices don’t.\nNow, to answer your question: You would start debugging by looking what happens after you attach the device to the host machine. To do so, open a console and enter\nsudo tail -f /var/log/kern.log\n\nThen plug in your phone. You should see something like the following output:\nJul 28 22:45:17 tp kernel: [810865.949958] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 22 using xhci_hcd\nJul 28 22:45:17 tp kernel: [810866.079025] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=04e8, idProduct=6860\nJul 28 22:45:17 tp kernel: [810866.079028] usb 1-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=2, Product=3, SerialNumber=4\nJul 28 22:45:17 tp kernel: [810866.079030] usb 1-1: Product: Android\nJul 28 22:45:17 tp kernel: [810866.079031] usb 1-1: Manufacturer: Samsung\nJul 28 22:45:17 tp kernel: [810866.079032] usb 1-1: SerialNumber: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nNow check the details of the USB device with lsusb.\nlsusb -vd vendor:product | grep -i class\n\nThe vendor and product placeholders must be filled with the four-digit hex codes from the above /var/log/kern.log output.\nThis command will give your a list of USB “subinterfaces” that your phone exposes to your laptop, for example:\n# sudo lsusb -vd 04e8:6860 | grep -i class\n  bDeviceClass            0 (Defined at Interface level)\n  bDeviceSubClass         0 \n      bInterfaceClass         6 Imaging\n      bInterfaceSubClass      1 Still Image Capture\n      bInterfaceClass         6 Imaging\n      bInterfaceSubClass      1 Still Image Capture\n      bFunctionClass          2 Communications\n      bFunctionSubClass       2 Abstract (modem)\n      bInterfaceClass         2 Communications\n      bInterfaceSubClass      2 Abstract (modem)\n      bInterfaceClass        10 CDC Data\n      bInterfaceSubClass      0 Unused\n  bDeviceClass            0 (Defined at Interface level)\n  bDeviceSubClass         0 \n\nThis is a lot of gibberish (and even more if you read the entire output instead of greping for the USB classes), but it shows that the device implements class 06 – which usually means that the phone will be able to transfer images through the PTP/MTP protocol. *\nOther devices will show a 08 class, in which case you should see a device node like /dev/sdxX which you can mount. (Check the node’s details with file -s /dev/sdxX before mounting.)\nLong story short, while you will most likely not get mass storage support with a Windows device, you have a good chance that your phone will support MTP, especially as MTP is a brain child of Microsoft.\nThere are a couple of applications for Ubuntu that understand MTP so might want to install one of them and try accessing your phone’s storage. I personally like the Konqueror file manager very much and have made a flawless experience with its MTP integration.\n\n* To be honest, I’m not 100% sure that this is factually correct, so feel free to correct me, anyone.\n", "Q: How can I disable keybindings CTRL+Grave (CTRL+Tilde, CTRL+`) on Ubuntu 15.04 I am using Ubuntu 15.04 and they changed a hotkey. \nIs there a way to turn off the system's CTRL+~?

I'm thinking about making a port of the animations on pantheon-greeter.\nThanks\n\nA: The fade animation is done inside Unity - no greeter is actually used for screen locking. There is not an easy method of doing cross-fades when using a greeter - the switch between session and the greeter is done by switching VTs so neither is aware of each other.\n", "Q: New Ubuntu Upgrade to 14.0.4.2 made some programs not running about 2 days ago my automatic ubuntu update started to alert that there is problem with updates not being installed. So i changed my server and did it manually but it got failing to download at some point for many times, i finally realized some third party software is not being updated, i unchecked it and did it again, seemed ok, then i realized wine that was working prior to this error, is not working at all, i reinstalled it, did not work, did whatever i found in forums about wine not working, came at no solution, i did the upgrading to 14.0.4.2 with command line, it seems the upgrade was already in place. During this i needed Tor and Vidalia, after installing, vidalia happened to behave exactly as wine. before this update that came with error i had no problem as such. So any clue what is happening?\n\nA: There are some new patches available today.  Try running Software Updater again.  After I installed the latest kernel and patches, wine started working again for me.  Perhaps it will help with your other issues too.\n", "Q: Two hard drives, Two Operating systems on single computer I have two hard drives on my computer; one with windows 7 which I want to keep, and one empty formatted with ntfs which I want to install Ubuntu. What file system do I put on the empty ntfs system and how do I set the partitioning/boot menu on Ubuntu to install and use both systems?\n\nA: You do not need to format a disk previous to install Ubuntu. The install process will format if for you.\nThe easiest way for a newbie is to disconnect your Windows drive, then boot from Ubuntu Live USB and install it on the only disk using default options.\nAfter Ubuntu is installed, connect the Windows disk, make sure that first boot device is the disk, where Ubuntu is located. Boot to Ubuntu and run there in terminal\nsudo update-grub\n\nWindows will be found and you will have grub menu on boot asking which OS to load.\nThere are lots of ways doing it otherwise, but IMHO this the safest and easiest way for a newbie.\n", "Q: How to add swap area? This is the status of my system:\n$ grep 'Swap' /proc/meminfo\nSwapCached: 0 kB\nSwapTotal: 0 kB\nSwapFree: 0 kB\n\nPlease let me know how can I increase the swap area without re-installing.\n\nA: To add 1GB of swap to your computer follow these steps:\nOpen a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nAnd run:\nTo create the file myfile.swap in /mnt, to be used for swap:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/myfile.swap bs=1024 count=1048576\n\nTo format the file for swap:\nsudo mkswap /mnt/myfile.swap\n\nTo add the file to the system as a swap file:\nsudo swapon /mnt/myfile.swap\n\nYou must edit  file /etc/fstab to make the change permanent:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nAdd this line to the end of file:\n/mnt/myfile.swap  none  swap  sw 0  0\n\nCtrl + O, save file. Ctrl + X, close nano.\nReboot your computer to ensure that the changes go into effect.\n\nA: First off:\n    sudo apt-get install gparted && sudo gparted\n\nThen make yourself your swap partition (using these steps), save, exit, and be relieved that you have easy access to as partition editor.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the choice tab in the top right, and choose the drive you want the swap on.\n\n*If the device isn't already partitioned, go to Device -> Create Partition table -> Make FileSystem Type \"EXT4\" and make the memory Close to all of it (I'd say 93%.) Now save this and proceed.\n\n*Now create another partition from that, make the FileSystem type \"Swap\" Make it use the rest of the memory, and save. DO NOT DO THIS IF THIS IS THE BOOT DRIVE. IF THIS IS THE BOOT DRIVE, TELL ME.\n\n*If the device is already partitioned and you need to re partition it, just remove all partitions, and start from scratch. (Follow step 3)\n\n*Now do\nsudo apt-get install gedit && sudo gedit /etc/fstab\nYou will see a line all the way at the bottom that looks like this:\n    /dev/sda1 /home                                   ext4    defaults        0       0\n\nNow make new lines copying this format for the partitions you just made. The only thing you will have to change is the FileSystem, the mount point, and the options. For example my swap line looks like this:\n    /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-swap_1 none                swap    sw              0       0\n\nAfter that, save and exit.\n\n\n*The next step is crucially important to use root.\nsudo -i\n\n*Now\nwhoami\nIf       whoami doesn't return root you've done something wrong, and you need to do \n  sudo -i\n\n\n\n*Now type \nmount -a\nInto the terminal. THIS SHOULD NOT RETURN ANYTHING, IF IT DOES, STOP, AND LEAVE A COMMENT\n\n\n*If it didn't return any lines, do\nreboot now\n\n*When your computer boots back on, do free -m.\n\n*You should see something like\nSwap:         8043          0       8043\n\n*If you see that, you're done! If not, go back and do everything again. \n", "Q: Refusing to create an empty archive I have a problem with this command:\nsu -c 'tar zcvf yourname.tar.gz/etc/var/'\n\nHere is the website for my class assignment.\nSome of these command do not work correctly.\nHelp!\n\nA: The correct command is\nsudo su -c 'tar zcvf yourname.tar.gz /etc /var'\n\nor simply\nsudo tar zcvf yourname.tar.gz /etc /var\n\n\nAnd you forgot the space characters in your command:\nsu -c 'tar zcvf yourname.tar.gz/etc/var/'\n                               ^   ^-- Missing SPACE\n                                -- Missing SPACE\n\n\nYour PDF has a very bad quality, it seems like an OCR output.

I have looked at the FTP Server page and noticed that the FTP that Ubuntu uses does not support a secure connection. I was hoping someone could tell me if Ubuntu relay does not support FTP Security that is in IETF's RFC 2228 and RFC 4217, or did I miss-understand Ubuntu's documentation.\n\nA: I don't know which FTP server you've looked at but there are several available.\nFor example proftpd is available for Ubuntu and offers SSL.\nApart from don't confuse the various protocols:\n\n\n*\n\n*FTP: the old file transfer protocol which has different TCP connections for commands and data and which is a pain to use when different networks or firewalls are involved. But, it has easy support for anonymous connections and often also supports users which have nothing to do with the system users.\n\n*FTPS: the FTP protocol secured with SSL/TLS. More secure but even more painful to make it work if multiple networks or firewalls are involved.\n\n*SFTP: file transfer over the SSH protocol. This is something completely different to FTP and FTPS. It uses only a single TCP connection and is usually easy to tunnel. But, anonymous connections or using user accounts which are not also system accounts are usually not supported by the implementations.\n\n", "Q: update-grub failing ubuntu 14.04 (wubi) When I try to run sudo update-grub, I get the following error:  \n    Generating grub configuration file ...  \n    /etc/grub.d/10_lupin: 26: /etc/grub.d/10_lupin: data: not found  \n\nAny ideas what this could mean or how to fix it?\nHere is the contents of my 10_lupin file: http://pastebin.com/nDZ9v5sJ\n\nA: Your /etc/grub.d/10_lupin contains an error in line 26:\ndata otdir=\"${prefix}/share\"\n\nshould be\ndatarootdir=\"${prefix}/share\"\n\nTo restore that file just reinstall package lupin-support\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall lupin-support\n\n", "Q: Problems running Ubuntu When I try to boot in Ubuntu I get an error, to run it I try the Advanced options and I run it on a previous version.

I am new to Linux and Ubuntu. I would like to install Ubuntu on a computer that runs Windows XP. My question is to know whether dual boot is better than VMware. Also I just found out that there is VMware and VMBoot? Can anybody explain the difference to me and which one is better?\nThank you,\nSimon\n\nA: A VM is easer to play around with and can be quicker to set up because you do not need to find all divers and if you make any mistakes, and everyone does, it is a lot  easer to clean-up after. There are benefits to Dual Booting however, with the big one, for me at least, is that you have access to all the RAM of your computer. As Pilot6 has said it does run slower and does not have all the capabilities in any VM. Look at your options and chose based on your needs and general computer knowledge.\nI personally have not VMboot so I can not tell you the difference. \nAs for witch one is \"better\"  I can not say because that is an opinion. \n\nA: The problem to answer is that who knows the criterion of \"being better\"?\nIf you install Ubuntu in as a virtual machine, it will not use all capabilities of your computer and will work sufficiently slower.\nBut the installation may be easier and you wont't need to worry about drivers in some cases.\nI vote to close as opinion based.\n", "Q: How to disable autostart of SSHD in Ubuntu 15.04 In older versions of Ubuntu I commented out the \"start on ...\" line in  /etc/init/ssh.conf. This worked well, but not in Ubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: This is documented in man systemctl:\nsystemctl disable ssh\n\nprevents ssh service from automatic starting. But this is the way systemd does it, but ubuntu does not accept it and they have to do it their own way:\nOfficial documentation: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemdForUpstartUsers#Automatic_starting\nAccording to this you should create unit override without directive WantedBy=multi-user.target in /etc/systemd/system/ssh.service (instead of the current symlink):\nrm /etc/systemd/system/ssh.service\ncp /lib/systemd/system/ssh.service /etc/systemd/system/ssh.service\nsed -e \"/WantedBy=multi-user.target/d\" -i /etc/systemd/system/ssh.service\nsystemctl daemon-reload\n\n\nA: The command\nsystemctl disable ssh\n\ndid it for me.\n@Jakuje: Thanks for giving me the idea.\n\nA: It does a bit more than requested, but the foolproof approach is to remove the package:\nsudo apt-get remove openssh-server\n\nThis works in all versions of Ubuntu.\nAssuming you have internet access, or have cached the package, reinstalling (and automatically restarting) is not a problem:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n\nA: I want to disable a service and systemctl disable myservice doesn't work, but run a systemctl daemon-reload after disabling makes it disable.\n", "Q: cryptsetup luksAddKey throwing 'Maximum keyfile size exceeded' error - fix? 14.04 I am attempting to add a homekey entry to my /etc/crypttab in order to prevent entering a 3rd pass upon login on a 14.04 install w/ LUKS (root/swap/home). When I attempt to add the key using cryptsetup luksAddKey I get the maximum keyfile size exceeded error. \nI have attempted to use the --keyfile-size 512 argument to see if it would override it, but it did not fix it.\nAlso, is there a way to do this same process for the swap, so that I only have to enter one password at boot? Or would doing that sacrifice security?\n\nA: It sounds like the key file that you are trying to use is at least 8 KiB, which exceeds cryptsetup's default maximum size. You can use the --new-keyfile-size <size_in_bytes> option to force cryptsetup to use the key, but I recommend using a random key with a smaller size, because a key that is larger than the master key of the LUKS volume offers no additional security over a key that is the same size as the master key (as long as the key material is truly random).\nThe maximum master key size for LUKS is 512 bits, but it can also be 256 bits. You can check the size of your master key by finding the size of \"MK bits\" in sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/<device>.\nI suggest generating keys from /dev/random. For example, to generate a random 512-bit (64-byte) key:\nhead -c 64 /dev/random > luks_key\n\n", "Q: why the swap partition is not working i have setup fully encrypted lvm on my laptop,it have created a swap partition also.But why system does not recognize the swap partition?\nhere is the screenshot link\n\n\nA: How do you know it does not recognize swap? According to the right part of your screenshot the system does know there's swap. According to the memory stats in the left part of your screenshot you use about 57% of your memory so about 43% is still free. This is apparently enough so the system has no need to use swap right now.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu for phones support the AMR-WB codec, aka HD Voice?

I have installed a Landscape-server 15.01 for personal use on a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server, i have connected 4 clients so far but everything is going extremely slow.  \nit can take upto 5-10 minutes to reboot one of the clients, if i am doing it manually it will take about 30-40 sec. \nand update packages can take up to 30 min ?  \nCan this really be true? or is tehre a solution for this? \n\nA: Reboot and shutdown activities are delayed by 5 minutes on the client side on purpose. If there is someone logged in at the console, he/she will have 5min to save his/her work, or cancel the reboot/shutdown.\nAbout package updates taking 30min, that could depend on a lot of factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*your bandwidth from the client to the ubuntu archive\n\n*if this happened right after a client registered with the server. There is an initial delay while package data is synchronized between server and client. It's usually a few minutes, but can be up to 3h if it's an ubuntu release that the server has seen for the first time and for which there are no hash-id files (check /var/lib/landscape/ or something like that for a hash-id directory, I don't remember the exact name from memory).\n\n*also for the above case, if the package activity happened while that sync was going on, the client will log something about unknown hash-ids in /var/log/landscape/package-reporter.log or package-changer.log. That has a timeout of 2h IIRC, to give time for the client to run apt-get update on its own (package reporter interval configuration sets that).\n\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: dpkg broken by oracle-java8-installer I want to remove the oracle-java8-installer but it gives the below errors.

I'm a bit worried about this as I have never had good luck with GRUB.\nTo add a bit more weirdness, after this has happened, the nuc will not boot to the USB pen drive. It instead goes to the network boot and the uefi doesn't show it as a boot option. If I remove and plug back in, it works.\nI really don't want to get an MSATA drive as they are expensive. The NUC was cheap, is small, and low energy.\nAny help would be awesome, I'm very new to linux, only played with a few VM's and a raspberry pi as a file server (samba).\n\nA: I dont really have a lot of knowledge with NUC. But maybe this will work. Take the usb hard drive and unplug it. Leave the usb stick in. Turn on the NAC and then wait like 1 second then plug back in the hard drive. It sounds crazy but it might work. If you can plug it in the second it boots it could work. If your NAC displays something like the Intel logo before it boots try to plug it in right after that.\n\nA: I read something about drives not being detected. They said you need to switch your sata cable on your motherboard to a different spot. I know that you don't have a sata cable.So maybe try to move your hard drive in a different spot. Like if  you plugged the hard drive in the front move it to the back. Switch it around.Try to have the hardrive in the back and the usb pen drive in the front. Or vise - versa\n", "Q: Install Inkscape v0.48 and v0.91 in the same computer Is it possible to install two versions of Inkscape (0.48 and 0.91) in ubuntu 14.04? I always use two versions to do my work in windows and I'd love to have both versions in ubuntu. Every time I tried to install the package, 0.91 always replace the 0.48 installations. Also is it possible to make a custom command like inkscape for version 0.48 and inkscape91 for version 0.91?\n\nA: There are basically three solutions:\n1) Compile one the Inkscapes yourself. This may cause problems with dependencies if the two versions of Inkscapes have different dependencies. Also, the compiled version will not appear in the graphical launcher.\n2) Install a Virtual Machine with a second Ubuntu 14.04 inside it, and there you can install and run another version of Inkscape. This works fine, but involves running the VM (Virtual Machine), which can be somewhat resource-intensive, just for Inkscape.\n3) More lightweight than VM and a good solution, but maybe less obvious to install and run: install a chroot environment, and run another version of Inkscape in there (follow the steps at the end of this page, under the TLDR heading, for a simple and fast guide). Once you're in your chroot environment, the following would install inkscape-trunk (as an example):\nHOME=/root\n\nadd-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/trunk\napt-get update\napt-get install inkscape-trunk\n\nand (again from inside the chroot environment) this would run your chrooted inkscape\nHOME=/root\ninkscape &\n\nSo once everything is setup, running the second Inkscape version would be done by:\na) entering the chroot environment using the following command\nsudo uck-remaster-chroot-rootfs /path/to/chroot/directory/\n\nb) then running Inkscape doing\nHOME=/root\ninkscape &\n\nPrograms you run from the chroot appear next to your \"normal\" programs (on your desktop etc.), as if you would have started them like any other program. The main difference is that they cannot write outside of the chroot directory you set up.\nSee also this thread on the Inkscapeforum.\n", "Q: How do I make taskbar icons appear in GNOME? In Unity, I see running programs such as Dropbox or Pidgin in the taskbar (the icons also change when dropbox is updating or I have received a new message in Pidgin).\nHowever, when I switched to GNOME these icons disappeared, even though the program is still running. A similar question was asked here:\nRunning programs are not displayed in the panel\nBut this question is for Ubuntu 10.x, and I don't see the \"bottom panel\" this question is referring to.\nI have the same problem on my work and home PCs, so I suspect this is not an artefact of my particular installation.\nHow can I get these icons back?\n\nA: If you're using GNOME 3, you should be able to see programs' app indicators by \"pushing\" the mouse cursor against the bottom edge of the screen.

This is what I currently have in my 000-default.conf file:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nServerName www.domain.com\nRedirect / https://www.domain.com/\n</VirtualHost >\n\nThat means all www. would redirect to https ://www.\nNow I'm missing the code to redirect all/any other forms of URL to https://www. using the same concept (not RewriteEngine because Apache suggests not to use RewriteEngine on simple redirects).\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*http ://domain.com\n\n*http ://www.domain.com\n\n*https ://domain.com\n\n\nthey would all go to => https://www.domain.com\nIf someone can point me in the right direction, that would be great!\n\nA: You need three redirects to do what you want:\nhttp://example.com to https://www.example.com\nhttp://www.example.com to https://www.example.com\nhttps://example.com to https://www.example.com\nThe first two are from port 80 plain HTTP so you have a VirtualHost for them.  You can make a VirtualHost section apply to more than one hostname (www.example.com and example.com) by having a ServerAlias section:\n# Redirect http://example.com and http://www.example.com to main site\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  ServerName www.example.com\n  ServerAlias example.com\n\n  Redirect / https://www.example.com/\n</VirtualHost >\n\nThen, you need a VirtualHost for your https://example.com only.  HTTPS uses port 443:\n# Redirect https://example.com to main site\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n  ServerName example.com\n\n  Redirect / https://www.example.com/\n</VirtualHost >\n\nNote: you'll need to set up your SSL settings there too, with a certificate that supports BOTH the domain with and without the \"www.\".  Setting up your SSL settings is outside the scope of this question.  (Added info: these can be two separate certificates if you like; it's becoming more common to have lots of separate certs now we have things like Let's Encrypt and SNI)\nIf you don't have an SSL certificate that supports your domain without the \"www.\" then you won't be able to do the redirect from https://example.com.  The redirect will only happen after the browser checks the certificate.  The user would be presented with a mismatched certificate error.\nThen, finally, you need your VirtualHost section for the \"valid\" site: HTTPS (port 443) on www.example.com:\n# Main site\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n  ServerName www.example.com\n\n  # Put all your configuration for this site here\n\n</VirtualHost >\n\nOnce you have tested your redirects and you're happy they are working, you can make them permanent by specifying the 301 status in the redirect (change Redirect / https://www.example.com/ to Redirect 301 / https://www.example.com/ everywhere), and by enabling HSTS which forces users' browsers to remember the preference for HTTPS.\n\nA: This worked for me, you can test it on my domain if you like.\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName freesoftwareservers.com\n    ServerAlias *.freesoftwareservers.com\n    Redirect / https://www.freesoftwareservers.com/\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n    ServerName freesoftwareservers.com\n    ServerAlias *.freesoftwareservers.com\n\nhttp://domain.com\nhttp://www.domain.com\nhttps://domain.com\nI had issues re-implementing this, and found that if I deleted 000-default.conf symlink from /sites-enabled it worked. Not sure whats the deal, but I have 0 other DNS records on the DNS side and my Apache does all the redirecting and it works.\n\nA: To add to thomasrutter's answer, I still had a problem when I was doing what he suggested. Sometimes you may need to add in the SSL info to the https://example.com virtual host. For instance when you're using SNI to allow multiple ssl certificates per ipaddress. \nWith out it you may get the ssl_error_rx_record_too_long error, since the server will be returning plain text to the https request.\n# Redirect https://example.com to main site\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n  ServerName example.com\n  Redirect / https://www.example.com/\n\n  #for Apache Old Style (Valid on Apache <= 2.4.8) - just add in whats needed for your version\n  SSLEngine on\n  SSLCertificateFile        \"your certificate file.crt\"\n  SSLCertificateKeyFile     \"your key file.key\"\n  SSLCertificateChainFile   \"your chain file.crt\"\n</VirtualHost >\n\n", "Q: Samba keeps asking username and password whatever I do I have an Ubuntu 14.04 desktop that I want to use like a fileserver to share data on my office.\nI have three desktops using KUbuntu 15.04 that must access the files.\nI install samba using the instructions give on Ubuntu official docs.\nBut whatever I do in my smb config file users cannot access the share and are asked for username and password.\nYou can find here the output for my testparm -s command:\nLoad smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf\nrlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)\nProcessing section \"[SHARES]\"\nLoaded services file OK.\nServer role: ROLE_STANDALONE\n[global]\n    workgroup = MYGROUP\n    server string = Samba Server\n    map to guest = Bad User\n    username map = /etc/samba/smbusers\n    log file = /usr/local/samba/var/log.%m\n    max log size = 50\n    dns proxy = No\n    idmap config * : backend = tdb\n    read only = No\n    create mask = 0755\n    guest ok = Yes\n\n[SHARES]\n    path = /srv/samba/share\n    valid users = cyber03\n\nYou can also check my smb.conf file here :\nLoad smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf\nrlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)\nProcessing section \"[SHARES]\"\nLoaded services file OK.\nServer role: ROLE_STANDALONE\n[global]\n    workgroup = MYGROUP\n    server string = Samba Server\n    map to guest = Bad User\n    username map = /etc/samba/smbusers\n    log file = /usr/local/samba/var/log.%m\n    max log size = 50\n    dns proxy = No\n    idmap config * : backend = tdb\n    read only = No\n    create mask = 0755\n    guest ok = Yes\n\n[SHARES]\n    path = /srv/samba/share\n    valid users = cyber03\nLoad smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf\nrlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)\nProcessing section \"[SHARES]\"\nLoaded services file OK.\nServer role: ROLE_STANDALONE\n[global]\n    workgroup = MYGROUP\n    server string = Samba Server\n    map to guest = Bad User\n    username map = /etc/samba/smbusers\n    log file = /usr/local/samba/var/log.%m\n    max log size = 50\n    dns proxy = No\n    idmap config * : backend = tdb\n    read only = No\n    create mask = 0755\n    guest ok = Yes\n\n[SHARES]\n    path = /srv/samba/share\n    valid users = cyber03\nLoad smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf\nrlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)\nProcessing section \"[SHARES]\"\nLoaded services file OK.\nServer role: ROLE_STANDALONE\n[global]\n    workgroup = MYGROUP\n    server string = Samba Server\n    map to guest = Bad User\n    username map = /etc/samba/smbusers\n    log file = /usr/local/samba/var/log.%m\n    max log size = 50\n    dns proxy = No\n    idmap config * : backend = tdb\n    read only = No\n    create mask = 0755\n    guest ok = Yes\n\n[SHARES]\n    path = /srv/samba/share\n    valid users = cyber03\n# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command testparm\n# to check that you have not many any basic syntactic errors.\n#\n#======================= Global Settings =====================================\n[global]\n\n# workgroup = NT-Domain-Name or Workgroup-Name, eg: REDHAT4\n   workgroup = MYGROUP\n\n# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field\n   server string = Samba Server\n\n# This option is important for security.

Also I have found issues trying to share samba directories high up the file tree, so I usually make a samba directory and and symlink the folders inside it. But it looks like you already do that, or at least that your samba share folder is low on the file tree.\nSince you only have 3 desktops to share to, this should be relatively easy to implement, and if you wanted to share more folders, I would do something like\n[Desktop 1]\npath = /srv/samba/desktop1/\n\nand symlink directories inside of that folder, that way you can add or delete shares without touching sambas configs!\n\nA: I use a linux machine to move files to several windows machines. After a ubuntu update when I tried to connect to windows machines I am prompted for a password. \nThe prompt says: Computer Name____________ and under it Password_______. When I put the computer name and password in they don't work.\nSolution: The computer name [Robyn] that you find on windows 7 by right clicking \"My Computer\" or right clicking \"This PC\" in windows 10 is not it! Instead you need to go to command prompt [start ---->cmd], the prompt will come up saying C:\\Users\\GeorgiaSalpa>\nSo in this case when samba asks for \"computer name\" you put in GeorgiaSalpa and then for \"password\" you put in the windows computer password, not the password for a particular user.\nIn my case there was no need to mess with smb.conf and other complicated solutions found in many forums.\n\nA: Personally I think it would be wise to install Linux Server and use Samba and Webmin.\nThis is what I do to share files stored in one place. There are loads of tutorials out there that will help, trust me I started with minimal knowledge of Linux, but if not there should be many others who will give a more detailed and less-expansive answer.\n", "Q: 14.04 wifi ndisgtk drivers and getting card working i am completely new to ubuntu.  I think i was successful in installing ndisgtk and using the gui to install drivers for my wireless network card. i get a rt2860 hardware present and tried to configure my network.  I am at a loss at this point as i am unable to connect with wireless.\nany help or walk through in command prompts to see what I did wrong would be wonderful.  \n\nA: First, I suggest you remove the incorrect ndiswrapper driver:\nsudo ndiswrapper -e rt2860\n\nNext, with a temporary internet connection, by ethernet or whatever neans possible, do:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic git\ncd ~\ngit clone https://github.com/mareksuscak/asus-pce-n53-linux.git\ncd asus-pce-n53-linux\nsudo make\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe rt5592sta  \n\nLet us know your result as we will probably have one additional step.\nIf you run into trouble, backtrack and run these exact steps in order:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nReboot and then:\ncd ~/asus-pce-n53-linux\nsudo make clean\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\nPlease be certain that you don't see any errors. If you do, stop and ask. sudo make install should include, at the very end:\n\ninstall -m 644 -c rt5592sta.ko\n  /lib/modules/4.0.1-040001-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/\n  /sbin/depmod -a 4.0.1-040001-generic make[1]: Leaving directory\n  '/home/chili/asus-pce-n53-linux/os/linux'\n\nIf so, load the driver:\nsudo modprobe rt5592sta\n\nIt is not ndiswrapper that needs to be added to /etc/modules but rt5592sta. Please do:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modules\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Remove the line ndiswrapper; add a new line rt5592sta. Proofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nReboot. Is your wireless working as expected?\nYou have compiled the driver for your currently running kernel version only. When Update Manager installs a later kernel, also known as linux-image, you must recompile after the requested reboot:\ncd ~/asus-pce-n53-linux\nsudo make clean\nsudo make\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe rt5592sta\n\nPlease retain the file and these instructions for that time.\n", "Q: Umount when umount -lf doesn't work I'm trying to troubleshoot our NAS, and frankly, I'm getting sick of it, every time I try and unmount the connection on our server (Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS fully updated) it simply refuses to unmount the NFS share.\n/proc/mounts:\n10.43.1.134:/c/Servers /mnt/backups rw,noatime,vers=3,rsize=131072,wsize=131072,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,mountaddr=10.43.1.134,mountvers=3,mountport=3072,mountproto=udp,local_lock=none,addr=10.43.1.134 0 0\n\nEvery time I issue sudo umount -lf /mnt/backups it simply hangs, and destroys another SSH session. So I've taken to running that with &. \nWhich according to the docs is really not supposed to happen.\nCertain processes (backupPC) which were writing to that share are still running, and kill -9 won't stop them... not sure why, that seems illogical. \nIt's locking my IO basically.. \nHow do I stop them and umount it without resorting to a reboot?\n\nA: To fix it, I just had to issue\nsudo mount -o remount,soft 10.43.1.134:/c/Servers /mnt/backups\n\nAll fixed. Everything umounted, all the errant processes received the notification that they were unwanted, load average immediately dropped back to sane levels...

The game is working fine graphically, however the audio is severely distorted with a varying stutter depending on how many different sounds are being played at once. Specs: Ubuntu 14.04, nVidia GTX 760 (331.113, nvidia-331), ASUS M5A97 R2.0, AMD FX-6300\nHere's a recording of the game menu: https://youtu.be/92VgTXrhgS0\nThat's the top quality. The more audio at once, the more distortion appears.\nI've spent the whole day searching for solutions, including suspending PulseAudio, changing sample rates on Wine, using alsadrv, windows7 mode, windows2k mode, windows xp mode... Basically all the first pages on Google for any combination of keywords \"skyrim ubuntu audio stutter\", and any combination of solutions. What I could gather is that its probably a \"buffer underrun\", but the solutions above did not change the results.\nI don't know which info is necessary, so please tell me and I'll edit with the relevant data.\n\nA: Here is another method. That might work. Go into terminal and type in this command\nwinecfg\nThis should open a menu that will have some features on it. Go to sound and hit test sound to see if it is working. You can maybe mess around a little bit here to select your default system input and output sounds. I have mine all set to system default. Although I don't use many programs on win that need sound. Also another thing to try is on your game go to sound and select your speakers or speaker drivers. If you can. Sometimes the game might not be running the correct sound driver.\n\nA: Maybe it is because your audio cord is not plugged in fully. Also make sure your audio drivers are up to date and are the right audio drivers for your speakers. Maybe your audio cord is broken. Or just try reinstalling wine.\n", "Q: How can an IP address be statically assigned in Ubuntu 15.04 server? I installed Ubuntu 15.04 mini in a Virtualbox VM with the network bridged.  The install automatically enables DHCP which works fine.  In order to statically assign an IP address, I edited /etc/network/interfaces to look like the following:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n  address 10.168.1.218\n  gateway 10.168.1.1\n  netmask 255.255.254.0\n  dns-nameservers 10.168.1.210\n\nIf the networking service is restarted, the static address works fine.  On reboot, eth0 is up and an ifconfig shows the correct IP, but I can’t ping other devices, i.e. the gateway, and other devices can’t ping this machine.  A simple ifdown/ifup cycle will kick it back in gear as will the networking service restart, but I’m hoping to find a way to make the static ip assignment work upon reboot.\nI’ve looked at the syslog and didn’t see anything unusual regarding eth0.\n\nA: Before we start, find your Ubuntu Server's internal MAC Address (All servers have them) and write it down\n1- Open a web browser\n2- Go to your router using your IP Address\n3- Login to your router\nWARNING: SETTINGS MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT, JUST USE YOUR INNER CHRIS COLUMBUS AND FIND THE SETTING PAGE\n4- IP And MAC Binding\n5- Add a new one\n6- For MAC Address put your server's address\n7- For IP, put the static IP you want to give it (REMEMBER THIS IP)\n8- Restart your router\n9- Go to the settings of your Ubuntu Server and set the IP to the Static One (The one that you set as the bound IP in your router)\n10- Restart the computer\n11- BAM!

Now, when I create Ubuntu 14.04 installation in my usb by Linux Pen Drive, it's UEFI certainly which I can't change.

UEFI boot is the problem, I'm pretty sure changing that may corrupt the win bootloader. Can't really help you there - re-install? \nDuring the install I believe fast boot and secure boot is what you want to disable in the BIOS. I'm pretty sure I put both UEFI files in the same partition (I could be wrong) - once installed, grub will become your default boot manager. \nFrom there you can go to Windows or Linux - sometimes you have to \"fix\" the grub - after major Windows updates -  I use (http://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/) and do the recommended repair option.\n", "Q: wifi and ethernet keep disconnecting I don't know if this has been asked before, but the internet (ethernet and wifi) is constantly disconnected.

No key strokes are effective and the mouse pointer is frozen in place or disappears.

Are Click packages obsoleted by Snappy packages?\nShould I focus on learning how to make snappy packages, and ignore the click documentation?\n\nA: Click is still in use for the Ubuntu Phone, but that will migrate to snappy pretty soon.\nSnaps in 15.04 are the new click, but even they are still in development.\nThe target form of snaps will be in 16.04 LTS, where they become compressed filesystems, so totally self-contained and totally, provably, immutable. That's where we finally get the perfect transactionality and also space efficiency we want.\nMy recommendation would be to start playing with snapcraft now, it's a neat way to make snaps, and it will handle the transition to the new format naturally for you. Anything you build with snapcraft today will become a new-style snap when that's ready.\n\nA: According to the web page linked below Snappy is just the new name for Click packages \nsee http://news.softpedia.com/news/ubuntu-desktop-built-with-snappy-packages-486556.shtml\n\"The Snappy packages, formerly known as Click packages, are a new approach to package management that allows for transactional updates, and they also provide better security.\"\n", "Q: What are dynamic and static linking? I hear the terms \"Dynamically linked\" and \"Statically linked\" tossed around in regards to packaging, and I have never been clear on what these terms actually mean. \nWhat are dynamic and static linking?\n\nA: This question should really be broken in two: \"What are dynamic and static linking?\", and \"How does Click solve dependency issues?\". The two aren't related. Here I will give attempt to answer the first question.\nWhat are dynamic and static linking?\nThe source code of any software program makes use of external functions. External functions reside in libraries. When compiling the program into machine code*, the external references must somehow be linked to their definitions, i.e. to their implementation in machine code. There are two approaches to doing this. Either (a) the implementing code is \"pulled in\" from the libraries and added to the resulting binary, or (b) the references are left dangling and will be \"pointed to\" their implementation at runtime. We call (a) static linking and (b) dynamic linking.\nAs with any engineering decision, neither alternative is better than the other. Static linking has the advantage of not creating a dependency on the runtime environment and therefore produces more predictable binaries. This comes at the cost of duplication of code, and therefore disk, network and memory consumption. Dynamic linking enables sharing library code at runtime. It also enables upgrading libraries, for instance when a bug is found, without the need to recompile the binaries that use them. All dependants get fixed automatically. Obviously they also get broken automatically, by the bugs and incompatibilities that the new version introduces.\nLeaving the pros and cons aside, dynamic linking inherently produces a more complex system. There are more moving parts and, especially, there are dependencies between the moving parts**. The question then is how to manage this complexity. For instance, how to have two versions of an application on the system, each requiring their own dependencies, among which there could be two different minor versions of one library. Because the file names of these libraries collide, this is not currently possible on Ubuntu.\nOne could say that every packaging system, apart from simplifying software installation, is an attempt to resolve dependency and versioning issues, while reaping the benefits of having dynamic dependencies. The Debian packaging system at the time it came about was much better at doing this than the existing ones. Since then many other solutions have come up. A notably thorough approach is taken by GNU Guix and its Guix package manager. Click is another.\n\n*) We assume a program compiled to machine code, not one that will be interpreted or compiled into an intermediate language (e.g. Python, Java). On an abstract level these languages suffer from the very same dynamic resolution issues (ClassNotFoundException in Java), but including them here would just muddle the explanation.\n**) Note that if you stick to statically linked binaries, then there would be no runtime interdependencies. That is, no library dependencies, there are other kinds.\n", "Q: RE question : transfer exe transfer file from Ubuntu oracle virtual box to host machine (windows 7 ) i want to transfer executable file from Ubuntu to windows , i try via shared folder its ok but when i open executable file in windows the file is not defined ( not exe file )\n\n*\n\n*More information :\nthe exe file (sphinx3_align ) is part of package sphinx3 tool , after run sphinx3 tool in ubuntu  copy sphinx3_align from usr/local/bin to shared folder ( i need it to put in another virtual box )  , but when i open in windows the file not defind\n\n\n*Detaile : safia@safia-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ file sphinx3_align sphinx3_align: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=d4584be6f1adc0b0a8471cd8e774a79c53b1f7f3, not stripped\nAnyone have any idea about this problem , help me ,Thank You\n\nA: You can't run Linux programs in Windows (unless you use some kind of emulator) nor Windows programs in Linux (again except if you are using Wine or similar software).\n", "Q: Switching to Ubuntu from Windows I've been using Ubuntu for a while now. I still have windows installed and it's taking up the majority of my hard drive space. I want to fully switch to Ubuntu though. I've backed up everything I need from Windows and I'm ready to get rid of it. I just don't know how to do it. Here is a Screenshot from gParted. \n\n\nA: Using gparted you should be able to select the ntfs partitions you want to delete and delete them - Once deleted you have to format the unpartitioned space into ext4 or fat32 (again using gparted) - If you dont want to completely remove windows you can shrink the windows partition down using diskmgmt.msc from windows\nIf you decide to completely remove Windows via gparted as described you will have to either 1) flag your sda5 partition as boot or 2) create a new partition for /boot and and move the files from its current location to the new /boot partition. Also you will want to remove windows from the grub menu -  \nA tool that I use to 'fix' my grub boot loader is (http://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/files/) - I have this installed on a usb that i keep in my toolbox\nIf you want to manually do this: \nMake a bootable disk for Gparted - (http://gparted.org/livecd.php)\nI use this to make bootable usb's - (http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/) - however you want will be good bud.\nGparted can be used to make a boot partition (mine is formatted ext2 but i dont think theres any issue with making it all ext4) - minimum size of this partition is 200 mb (you dont want it to be too big at all) and you will want to flag it as /boot. \nSome examples for you: (Things are named aptly so you can logically see the process)\n/dev/sda2 - 200 MB new boot partition\n/dev/sda1 - 50 GB existing linux partition \n\nMake mount points.\nmkdir /mnt/newboot /mnt/existing\n\nMount the partitions: \nmount /dev/sda2 /mnt/newboot\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt/existing\n\nCopy /boot files:\ncp -a /mnt/existing/boot/* /mnt/newboot/\n\nUnmount the boot partition from /mnt and remount to /boot: \numount /dev/sda2\nmount /dev/sda2 /newboot\n\nTo remove windows from Grub:\nsudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nYou can (put a #) in front of each line to \"comment out\" the entries pertaining to Microsoft Windows - or if you are comfy with just deleting them - so be it.  I usually make a copy of any conf file i mess with and save it in my home dir just in case i screw something up.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 and SSH: Automatically shutting down another computer when powering off I want to shut down another computer in my network when shutting down my own.\nFor that I have created a script that logs into that machine through ssh and powers it off.

The thing I didn't take into account is that the script is exectuted as root and not with my user.

I never experienced this, and I'm sure it's not supposed to do that (as you probably also suspect). \nI fiddled around to reproduce.

(like gmail has an account in system settings - accounts) \nI opened a webapp on my pc for Telegram, and in settings - active sessions I terminated all other sessions. I thought this might be the cause of your problems. When I started Telegram on my phone, it ran and was sort of logged in, but couldn't access my chats. I could see my personal info in settings. After a reboot, I do get the exact message you show in the question. If I click OK, the dialog doesn't disappear, and I need to restart Telegram to login again. Then it works again.\nCould this be causing your problem? Do you use telegram on other devices? Do you ever terminate other sessions from there? If not, this is a bug, but I wouldn't know if it's the telegram app in Ubuntu or rather telegram itself.\n\nA: I ran into an issue with Telegram after having changed the password to my Ubuntu One account the other day. \nPerhaps removing your ubuntu one account and then setting it up again on your phone will resolve this for you. Its more a guess than an answer though. Somebody pointed to another solution involving the manual deletion of certain files. You can find it linked in the question above. \n", "Q: add path directories for boost installation I have installed boost_1.58_0 on my loptop's home directory.

A simple workaround however is doing it as root, as then no password is needed. I.e.: become root (using sudo su), then su into the user1 (using su user1). I do not understand why you want to su to ubunut when you already are that user (as indicated in your screenprint) but that is the way to go.\nMake sure that the user is acutally a user account and not a system (service) account like mail\n\nFollowing the comments below: sudo su user1 is quicker and will also allow you to go back to user2 with one, instead of two exit commands, as you only will create one instead of two login shells.\n\nA: First it should be noted that by using su ubuntu one would end up using the current user's environment, while what one usually wants to do is to use the target user's environment; so sudo - ubuntu would be the way to go.\nHowever, su is not documented enough, but the fact that to login as an user which has no password is not allowed is probably just su's policy.\nTo get the equivalent of su - ubuntu, which would be an interactive login shell as the user ubuntu, one might be tempted to run sudo su - ubuntu, which wouldn't prompt for a password; however this would be just redundant, since sudo itself provide this functionality on its own; using sudo su - ubuntu to get an interactive login shell as the user ubuntu would be exactly the same as running a script A which runs a script B in order to just run the script B.\nSo, to run an interactive login shell as the user ubuntu, just use sudo:\nsudo -i -u ubuntu \n\nFrom the sudo manpage for Trusty:\n\n[...]\n     -i, --login\n                 Run the shell specified by the target user's password\n                 database entry as a login shell.  This means that login-\n                 specific resource files such as .profile or .login will be\n                 read by the shell.  If a command is specified, it is passed\n                 to the shell for execution via the shell's -c option.  If no\n                 command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.  sudo\n                 attempts to change to that user's home directory before\n                 running the shell.  The command is run with an environment\n                 similar to the one a user would receive at log in.  The\n                 Command Environment section in the sudoers(5) manual\n                 documents how the -i option affects the environment in which\n                 a command is run when the sudoers policy is in use.\n[...]\n     -u user, --user=user\n                 Run the command as a user other than the default target user\n                 (usually root ). The user may be either a user name or a\n                 numeric user ID (UID) prefixed with the ‘#’ character (e.g.\n                 #0 for UID 0).  When running commands as a UID, many shells\n                 require that the ‘#’ be escaped with a backslash (‘\\’).  Some\n                 security policies may restrict UIDs to those listed in the\n                 password database.  The sudoers policy allows UIDs that are\n                 not in the password database as long as the targetpw option\n                 is not set.  Other security policies may not support this.\n[...]\n\n", "Q: Is it possible that Google Drive is in bundled in Google Chrome? Is it possible that Google Drive for ubuntu is included in Google Chrome?\nI tried several times to install Google Drive unsuccessfully. \nWhen I ran Google Chrome, the icons inherited from Windows still included the one for Google Drive, and I clicked on it without thinking. It ran, and has continued to run, normally ever since. \nThis leads me to wonder whether Drive is bundled in Chrome.\n\nA: Google Drive is a web application. Web applications are websites or webpages that can be accessed online and run as applications by themselves. Google Drive is not bundled with Google Chrome, and it is not necessary to install software locally in order to use Google Drive in a web browser.\nGoogle Drive can also be accessed locally in Ubuntu. For instructions about how to access Google Drive locally in Ubuntu see: Is there a Google Drive client available?. Some of the answers to \"Is there a Google Drive client available?\" are obsolete, but at least one of the answers has been updated recently, and it works in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu.\n\nA: Google Drive is built into the google.com web page - there shouldn't be anything to install. Google drive is an application just like gmail - no need to install anything.  You can access google drive from any web browser by going to google.com provided you are signed into your google account.\n", "Q: Printing from a different tray in cups I'm trying to print from tray 2 but I can only print from tray 1 and there is no way to enable more paper sources in cups is there a way to enable this option?\nMy printer is a Epson xp950.\n\nA: You need to install full feature drivers and the printer utility.\nGo to Epson drivers site\nSearch for you printer and download Printer driver 1.0.0 and Printer utility: epson-inkjet-printer-201305w_1.0.0-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb, epson-printer-utility_1.0.0-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb.\nCopy these files to your home folder and run in terminal\nsudo dpkg -i epson*.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nThe setting is here\n\n\nA: Even with installed official utility for printer (in my case Lexmark) I was not able to print from tray 2, even if I would select \"proper\" option.

I have a problem with a program crashing, and I suspect that only the latest version of the package has this problem, so I wish to block this particular version from ever being installed – but I still want to be able to upgrade to future versions.\nI think I've read (somewhere, at some point) that the apt system allows for this, but now that I look for it I seem unable to find it.\nHow would I go about doing this?\nP.S. I'm intentionally vague about which package I'm having problems with, as I want to understand this feature of Apt (if indeed it exists), and do not want suggestions specific to the program I'm having problems with.\n\nA: Edit the /etc/apt/preferences file and add:\nPackage: unzip\nPin: version 2.7\nPin-Priority: 100\n\nPackage: unzip\nPin: version 3*\nPin-Priority: 1000\n\nThis will keep the package on 2.7, skip 2.8, 2.9 and upgrade to 3* when available.\nNote that this is an unnatural way of not upgrading to an unstable package version. A better (and the recommended way) is to hold the package till the issues are resolved:\ndpkg:\n$ echo \"package hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nAptitude\n$ sudo aptitude hold package_name \n\n\nA: aptitude allows this with the forbid-version option.\nSelect the version of the package in the UI and press 'F'\nAlternatively you could do it via the command line interface, see manpage:\nforbid-version\n           Forbid a package from being upgraded to a particular version, while allowing automatic upgrades to future versions. This is useful for example to avoid a known broken version of a package,\n           without having to set and clear manual holds.\n\n           By default, aptitude will select the forbidden version to be the one which the package would normally be upgraded (the candidate version). This may be overridden by appending „=<version>“ to the\n           package name: for instance, „aptitude forbid-version vim=1.2.3.broken-4“.\n\n           To revert the action, „aptitude install <package>“ will remove the ban. To remove the forbidden version without installing the candidate version, the current version should be appended: „install\n           <package>=<version>“.\n\nPlease note: This forbidden version is only honoured by aptitude. apt-get or other package managers will upgrade the package if run.\n\nA: You can use 'apt-get install package-version' to install a specific version of this package.\nYou can prevent to update this version with a specific configuration of /etc/apt/preferences.

I managed to have an extended workspace, but I had to replicate the panels and this seems to create a few problems, particularly with the clock and the notification area and I have a few other reasons to prefer separate workspaces instead of the extended workspace.\nA few informations about the setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS: Ubuntu MATE 15.04\n\n*Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GT 540M\n\n*Graphics card driver: nvidia-304 (NVIDIA Legacy Binary Driver)\nChanged to nvidia-346 (NVIDIA Binary Driver) - no improvement.\n\n*Laptop: Acer Aspire TimelineX 4830T\n\n\nSeeing previous questions, I have to add that I installed Bumblebee to reduce battery consumption and heat production and a change in this direction is acceptable only if it achieves the same results, i.e. switching off the graphics card for most of the time. There is a list of different drivers, in particular nvidia-346 is recommended, but I must admit I never dared to change it, because until now the current driver worked perfectly.\nI couldn't find this question answered for my particular case (MATE+Bumblebee), only a few old questions (~2011) that say it's not possible. Did it became achievable? And if yes, how?\nThanks for the answer and for your time.\nEdit: I also tried to upgrade the driver to nvidia-346, but nothing changed. I noticed nvidia-settings is almost completely empty.\n\nA: Easy. All you have to do is to run Displays in the MATE menu. Then choose expand desktop.\nThen, according to this link, all you have to do is:\n\nRight-click the panel you wish to move and select “Properties”.\nUncheck the “Expand” option under the “General” tab.\nGrab one of the edges of the panel by clicking on the left or right end (top or bottom end for vertical panels)\nDrag the bar to the desired screen and position\nCheck the “Expand” option in the “Panel Properties” window and click “Close”.\n\n", "Q: matlab unable to find proper locale I have installed matlab R2015a on Ubuntu 14.04.2.\nUpon starting matlab and whenever I am trying to load a .m file I get the following error:\nCaught \"std::exception\" Exception message is:\nlocale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid\n\nI have followed the suggestion found on the Internet to rebuilt the locales.\nI have also modified the contents of the following files to be:\ncat /etc/default/locale\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\ncat /etc/environment\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n\ncat $HOME/.pam_environment\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\n\nFinally the output of the locale command is:\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_US\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n\nIs there anything more I can try?\n\nA: Following the suggestion of @gunnar-hjalmarsson, I removed LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 from the files: /etc/default/locale and /etc/environment.

There is no Linux version driver for Doxie go scanner by Manufacturer. Whether driver is available by other developers for Ubuntu 12.04? Simple scan didn't recognize the scanner.

I ditched Windows in favour of Linux. My laptop comes with the NVIDIA Geforce 840m. I install Ubuntu 14.04, and go to the Additional Drivers tab, and my GPU is not detected. So I go to the Nvidia website, and was glad to see that they support the Geforce 840m. I followed a Youtube tutorial on how to install the Nvidia driver https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ-r3gS38RU. All went well until the Nvidia installer said it did not detect a supported GPU. I then proceeded to install the PPA to see if that would activate my GPU. It does, and I am able to select different versions of the driver in the Additional Drivers tab. However, the moment I do anything that uses the GPU, the driver crashes. No matter what driver version I use, I get the same result. Please help, I do a lot of 3D modelling, and I don't want to go back to using Windows!!! \n\nA: In order to get your nvidia GPU to work, you need to install \"bumblebee\", just like it is mentioned on the wiki:\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia primus linux-headers-generic\n\nHowever, your card is not supported by the default drivers, since it is too recent, and thus, you will need to take additional steps.\nFirst of all, you must install the latest drivers sudo apt-get install nvidia 346 (at the time of writing).\nAfterwards, you must edit the file /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf and replace all instances of \"nvidia-current\" with \"nvidia-346\" (It has to be replaced on 4 places in that file).\nThis, however, will still make the machine boot into a black screen. The problem is that the nvidia module is being loaded before the intel one. Bumblebee creates a file /etc/modules/modprobe.d/bumblebee.conf that blacklists nvidia-modules. This file, however, hasn't been updated in a while. Therefore, you must add the following to the end of this file:\n# 346\nblacklist nvidia-346\nblacklist nvidia-346-updates\nblacklist nvidia-experimental-346\n\nAfter a reboot, you should be good to go. Of course, don't forget to change \"346\" to the number on the driver version you have installed.\n", "Q: When do I need to re-install instead of upgrading? Actually i need to know if i'm using 14.04 or 15.04 then do i'll need to a fresh installation of os after several time 5 yrs or 9 months?\n\nA: As long as the release you are using is an active one (so did not go end of life) you have the option to upgrade or to re-install. A re-install can be done without removing your personal documents. \nA list of dates when Ubuntu versions go end of life is available on our wiki.\nIn October 15.10 arrives. If using 15.04 you have until January 2016 to upgrade to 15.10. Or you can always opt to re-install at that time.\nIf using 14.04 (LTS) you have until 2019 to upgrade to another release but  3 years before it goes EOL 16.04 will arrive so that would be the next upgrade version when you want to move across LTS releases.\nAs always and it should be common sense anyways: backups will save you time and hassle when upgrading, re-installing or when doing anything drastic to your system. \n", "Q: Are there APIs to achieve centralized patching? I am trying to make a centralized patch management tool, which can be used to perform the controlled update of all the Ubuntu machines in my network.\nI did some research, and collected the following information :-\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a paid tool called Landscape, which can be used to achieve the same purpose. But, it is way to expensive.\n\n*There are other tools like Puppet/Chef/Ansible, which are mainly config tools.\n\n*Pulp which is basically a repository cloning tool.\n\n\nThe thing is I would like to achieve a combination of these. And, am wiling to put the effort in order to achieve it.\n\nMy requirements are :-\n\n\n*\n\n*To get the list of packages which need to updated [available at Ubuntu Security Notices], along with its dependencies\n\n*Download those packages from a Windows machine, and keep it there.\n\n*Later, Distribute these to all Ubuntu machines, as needed.\n\n\nEdit : I want to avoid the each Ubuntu machine from going online, due to bandwidth constraints\n\nIs there any API available to get the above mentioned package list (with dependencies)? If yes, for free or paid?\n\nA: Assuming you're not actually trying to air-gap the machines for security purposes or something:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect one ubuntu machine to the internet. Install updates as normal with apt-get.\n\n*The .deb's you just upgraded that box with are now stored in /var/cache/apt/archives.\n\n*scp the .deb's to each of the other ubuntu machines.\n\n*At a cost of a little bandwidth, on each other machine, place the .debs in /var/cache/apt/archives and run apt-get update && apt-get upgrade (or aptitude, or something). The machine will hit the network to get the new package list, but when it comes to download the packages for upgrade, it'll find it already has them in its cache, and just install them.\n\n*For maximum bandwidth conservation, just install the new .deb's with dpkg -i <files.\nObviously, it's slightly more complicated if you have a mix of 32 and 64-bit boxes, diff't architectures, etc. But you'd still have to download all the updated packages anyway.\n", "Q: Bash \"unexpected end of file\" on line 11, there is no line 11 I'm trying a new conky theme on my Lubuntu system, and for running it I need to start a bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\n#sleep 18&&\nconky -c /home/mathijs/conky/conky1&&\nsleep 1&&\nconky -c /home/mathijs/conky/conky2&&\nsleep 1&&\nconky -c /home/mathijs/conky/conky3&&\nsleep 1&&\nconky -c /home/mathijs/conky/conkyxx&&\nsleep 1&&\n\nWhen I run the script, the terminal gives me this error:\n./start.sh: line 11: syntaxerror: unexpected end of file\n\nYet in the script there are only 10 lines. I rewrote it by hand, and checked again, but got the same error. What am I missing?\n\nA: The shell metacharacter && expects a command afterwards, that would be run if the first command succeeds.\nThats why you are getting the error message.\nFor example you have sleep 1&& at the 10th line, now the shell will run sleep 1 and then if it succeeds (exit code 0) then (&&) will run the next command, which is not provided by you. So you would get a unexpected end of file error message.\nAlso i think you meant to use & instead of &&.\n& will take a foreground process to the background so you can do some other stuffs on the foreground. Also that might no be a good idea with sleep command (depends on use case though) as sleep intends to pause the execution of command in the script or the terminal for the amount of time mentioned, if you take it to the background by adding & e.g. sleep 1& the next command will be run instantly as the order of execution will not be synchronized in this case. \n\nA: The last command sleep 1&& expects to have something else.\nIf you remove last &&, there will be no error.\n", "Q: what does /var/lib/update-rc.d/xxx for?
