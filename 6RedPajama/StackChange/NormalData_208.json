["Q: Custom keyboard shortcuts in gedit 3.10 on ubuntu 14.04 I just upgraded my Ubuntu from version 12.04 to 14.04, now with gedit 3.10. Previously I had managed to customize some shortkeys, e.g. block commenting to Ctrl+r and block uncomment to Ctrl+t (instead of the defaults Ctrl+m and Ctrl+Shift+m respectively). These settings did not survive the upgrade and I'm desperately trying to get them working again.\nI've googled a lot on the issue, and the best I can find is listed below. I have run gconf-editor and checked the box \"gnome->desktop->interface can_change_accels\".\n1) Close all running instances of gedit.\n2) Open ~/.config/gedit/accels as root (with other editor than gedit, e.g. emacs).\n3) Edit the relevant lines in the file, in my case (block commenting): \n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/GeditCodeCommentPluginActions/CodeComment\" \"<Primary>r\")\n\nand\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/GeditCodeCommentPluginActions/CodeUncomment\" \"<Primary>t\")\n\n4) Save changes and close file.\nIf I look at the accels file (via e.g. the cat command), the changes are there. As soon as I open gedit however, the changes I made to accels are overwritten back to the defaults again. I found other posts with similar issues (the changes to accels are overwritten). Does anyone know of how to fix this to be able to customize the keyboard shortcuts?\nThanks!\n\nA: A couple of things - \n\n\n*\n\n*you wouldn't edit ~/.config/gedit/accels as root, it's a user file. Typically any edit to an accels file would require removing the ; from line for it to hold. In the case of gedit doesn't matter, you can't successfully edit that file.\n\n*To actually change just edit the plugin itself, open /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gedit/plugins/codecomment.py in a root text editor for 64 bit install & change there. 32 bit is in i386-linux-gnu\n(- at or about lines- 89 - 95, just change the letter(s), leave as <control>\n", "Q: Can't install systemctl - E: Package 'systemd' has no installation candidate I want to install 'systemd' in ubuntu/trusty64 but getting E: Package 'systemd' has no installation candidate error, have done sudo apt-get update and upgrade before and after installation commands.\nFollowing are the commands i have tried for installing systemctl but error persisted\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pitti/systemd\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install systemd libpam-systemd systemd-gui\nln -fs /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab\n\nalso\napt-get update && apt-get install sysvinit\n\n\nA: Should have thought the header on the PPA might have given you pause for thought:\n\nWARNING!

I am now finding it hard to share images + everything else. I have been very busy in personal/work life this last few months and haven't taken the time to explore this phone right, at the minute I am just using it a a phone not a smart phone, all I do is call and text. I find it hard to do the most mundane tasks that I could do in seconds on a Android. \nWhen I look at an image in gallery, if I hit share I have the options of Facebook, messaging, twitter or telegram. I want to have the image on my own e-mail or desktop, I don't want it on social media. Is there any app I can download. Google drive would be easiest I think. \nI also have't a clue how to transfer my images/video/etc onto my SD card, any help here?\nThanks\n\nA: Try Dekko for email or uDropCabin for Dropbox.\n\nA: use Dekko for sending it via email\n\nuse Wifi Transfer App from ubuntu store from transfering data to your laptop.\n\nhowever for ubuntu you can use by plugging usb to your computer.\n\nA: You can easily copy pictures and videos from your phone to your desktop by plugging it via USB cable.\n", "Q: Why does my Wireless connection block my internet traffic?

Don't do that.  Don't expect init=/bin/{bash,sh} to give a functional system that you can just use as normal.  It doesn't.  You have the burden of doing everything by hand that normally a proper system manager program would be doing for you.\nDon't expect shutdown, and indeed quite a few other system utilities, to work in the case where you are running a shell as process #1.  A shell doesn't do the necessary basic system management tasks required of process #1, and it doesn't speak the necessary protocols expected by commands such as shutdown.  In this particular case, the upstart shutdown program (which is what it is) is trying to open a Desktop Bus connection to upstart, in order to tell upstart to shut down the system; but since you never ran upstart in the first place there's no system manager for shutdown to talk to.\nYou have the burden of doing everything by hand that a system manager would normally do for you in order to shut down the system, including flushing the filesystem cache, unmounting filesystems cleanly, and then enacting the raw final poweroff/halt/reboot action.\nFor the same reason, don't expect complex \"desktop environments\" — that depend from things like session inits; running Desktop Bus and \"kit\" servers; and basic system initialization steps like having all of the filesystems (including the \"API\" ones) properly mounted, all of the necessary loadable kernel modules loaded, and all of the sysctl/whatever settings set — to work in the case where you just ran a shell and didn't do any of the stuff that a system manager program and system initialization have to do.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/197472/5132\n", "Q: How can I run Windows phone in Ubuntu virtually?

The normal way is to avoid this and just pass the array values as arguments. In order to have both options, you would have to use eval:\n#!/bin/bash\nfunction populate_array () {\n    if [ \"$#\" -gt 0 ] ; then\n        # Enter array w/ elements as argument of executable \n        # Note the quotes, they are needed\n        array=(\"$@\");\n        n=$#\n    else\n        # Invoke executable with no arg, enter array element later\n        # Read a string instead of an array and use eval to make it\n        # into an array. That way, you can use tricks like escaping\n        # spaces. You also need the -r option to protect the backslashes\n        # so that eval will see them. \n        read -r  -p \"Enter array elements separated by spaces: \" string\n        eval array=\"( $(printf '%s\\n' \"$string\") )\"\n        n=${#array[@]} \n    fi\n    printf \"%d array elements \\n\" \"$n\"\n} \n\npopulate_array \"$@\"\n\nwhile ((\"$n\" > 0))   # while [ \"$n\" -gt 0 ] ALSO WORKS\ndo\n    printf \"%s \\n\" \"${array[$n-1]}\"\n    n=$n-1\ndone\nexit 0\n\nYou still need to escape the parentheses if you pass the array values as an argument since ( ) are reserved characters for bash. With that caveat, the script above should work as you expect:\n$ foo.sh lkl1239 343.4l 3,344 \\(34\\) \"lklk  lkl\" lkaa\\ lkc\n6 array elements \nlkaa lkc \nlklk  lkl \n(34) \n3,344 \n343.4l \nlkl1239 \n\nAnd\n$ foo.sh\nEnter array elements separated by spaces:  lkl1239 343.4l 3,344 \\(34\\) \"lklk  lkl\" lkaa\\ lkc \n6 array elements \nlkaa lkc \nlklk  lkl \n(34) \n3,344 \n343.4l \nlkl1239 \n\n\nA: Just quote the $@ as you already correctly do in the function invocation:\narray=(\"$@\")\n\nAs man bash puts it:\n\n\"$@\" is equivalent to \"$1\" \"$2\" ...\n\n\nA: Special characters typically have to be escaped with backslash, like so:\n $ array-script.sh   lkl1239 343.4l 3,344 \\(34\\) \"lklk  lkl\" lkaa\\ lkc                                                                  \n6 array elements \nlkaa lkc \nlklk  lkl \n(34) \n3,344 \n343.4l \nlkl1239 \n\nThe brackets are treated by the shell as metacharacters, hence need to be escaped. The backslash in lkaa\\ lkc already escapes the space between lkaa and lkc, so those two strings are treated as one. Same as with cd /home/user/bin/NAME\\ WITH\\ SPACE\nAnd from man bash:\n   metacharacter\n                  A character that, when unquoted, separates words.  One of the following:\n                  |  & ; ( ) < > space tab\n\n\nA: can you try by placing below at top of script\nSAVEIFS=$IFS\nIFS=$(echo -en \"\\n\\b\")\n\nand \nIFS=$SAVEIFS \n\nin bottom of script\n", "Q: Can you \"set a persistent size for saving changes\" after creating the Bootable USB?

The only games that I have that work are \"Double Action: Boogaloo\" and \"Counter-Strike: Source\". \nNote: I have all the Counter-Strike games (sans Nexus), GMod and Portal 2.\nCS:GO's Error\n~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive$ optirun ./csgo_linux \n./csgo_linux: error while loading shared libraries: libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nGMod's Error\n~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod$ optirun ./hl2_linux\nAppFramework : Unable to load module /home/USERNAME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/bin/filesystem_stdio.so!\n\nPortal 2 throws the same error as CS:GO.\nI have bumblebee and nvidia-349 installed (and all the dependencies). I've installed NVidia drivers via this method, and have installed the 32-bit libraries via this method. Please help!\nEDIT: This also happens without optirun (with Intel integrated graphics).\nUPDATE: I ran steam in the console (not the games themselves) and then ran the games. I saw in most of the logs this:\nERROR: ld.so: object '/home/pistol/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/gameoverlayrenderer.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32): ignored.\nERROR: ld.so: object '/home/pistol/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_64/gameoverlayrenderer.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64): ignored.\n\n\nA: EDIT: \nThe Actual Fix\nAll credit goes to Henrik Johansson who made a great guide here. I'll tell you what to do in short.\nFor Valve games, go to the executable in your favorite editor and search for\n ${DEBUGGER} \"${GAMEROOT}\"/${GAMEEXE} \"$@\"\n\nand replace it with\nprimusrun ${DEBUGGER} \"${GAMEROOT}\"/${GAMEEXE} \"$@\"\n\n(or optirun, your choice)\nThis seems to affect all games that utilize a .sh executable. Other games may be fixed in a similar fashion.\nMy Explanation\nThe problem lies within how Steam runs commands. This is a problem I have just recently connected the dots with and now know the answer. It seems as if the ld.so problem deals with Intel drivers (or so I think). Steam fails to run optirun/primusrun correctly (or maybe at all) and thus uses the Intel drivers, which doesn't work.\nThat which is below is not applicable anymore, as xorg-edgers is now graphics-drivers.\nDon't listen to what's below this, please.\n\nAfter multiple search attempts on the internet and after LOTS of trial and error, I can safely conclude that the main problem is the PPA xorg-edgers. If you have similar problems, you should remove whatever drivers you have from xorg-edgers and then ppa-purge it.\nIf you don't know how to do it, then here's how.\nInstall ppa-purge by...\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nRemove the xorg-edgers with...\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nAnd finally... \nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: In the first case, the game complains about the absence of libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4 library. Probably, Steam or the game have their version of this lib inside the directory. Anyway, you can try install it from the Ubuntu repository. I don't now if it uses the 32 bits or 64 bits version, but you can try:\nFor the 64 bits version\nsudo apt-get install libtcmalloc-minimal\n\nor the 32 bits version   \nsudo apt-get install libtcmalloc-minimal4:i386 \n\nIn the second case, it complains that, for any reason, it can't load the file filesystem_stdio.so inside the steam instalation. You can try reinstall steam.\n", "Q: No option to boot to windows 3 days after installing ubuntu I installed Ubuntu 15.04 3 days ago and was able to boot to windows and Ubuntu comfortably but suddenly today there is no option in the boot menu to boot to windows.\n\nA: The excellent boot-repair tool usually sorts out these problems.\nIf that doesn't fix it the tool can provide more information as to what's going wrong.

I've read in another post (How do I increase the hard disk size of the virtual machine?) that to change the size of a Virtual Disk Image(.vdi) one can use the following command:\nVBoxManage modifyhd YOUR_HARD_DISK.vdi --resize SIZE_IN_MB\n\nHowever, is this enough? Don't you have to resize the partition?\n\nA: The linked question addresses increasing the size of a virtual disk.  Big picture, to do this, you give the VBoxManage command to increase the image size, then start the virtual machine, and use gparted or equivalent to increase the partition size.\nIf you want to decrease the size, you would have to reverse the steps - first shrink the partition inside the VM, then use VBoxManage to decrease the image size (assuming this is possible - I have not tried).  I also do not know what would happen if you gave the VBoxManage parameters that would decrease the size of the file smaller than the partition(s) inside.\nThere are ways of shrinking the virtualbox file size that are not so dramatic, if that is what your end goal really is. This is called 'compacting' the drive and shrinks the virtualbox file size to only the space that is actually used.\nIf you plan to do any of this stuff, I strongly advise backing up any important data first.\n", "Q: Copying speed to external hard drive get slower and slower When I copy files (lots of them) to an external hard drive it's start on a pretty good speed and get slower and slower until I just give up.\n\nA: Of cause it depends on your connection like USB2/USB3 and the internal and external disk speed.

My VAIO can detect and pair with my iPhone 5S (I just did this to test the bluetooth).\nAre there any additional drivers I need to install? Any other programs that might help?\n\nA: Well I feel really stupid now. To put the Bluebuds into proper pairing mode, you have to have them off, then hold the power button until it turns on, AND starts pairing. Then it connects no problem. You might also have to go into the system sound settings and change the mode from Telephony Duplex to High Fidelity Playback.

If you wish to switch me to gnome terminal in your answer and want to know it's current background colour for me it's white. \nI am currently running zsh as my shell, but am willing to change to bash or any shell environment required to enable syntax highlighting in terminator. \n\nA: Syntax highlighting is not done by the terminal, is done by the shell; hence you'll need to setup syntax highlighting for the shell.\nFor Zsh there's zsh-syntax-highlighting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install git:\nsudo apt-get install git\n\n\n*Install zsh-syntax-highlighting:\ngit clone git://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git\necho \"source ${(q-)PWD}/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh\" >> ~/.zshrc\nsource ~/.zshrc\n\n\n", "Q: Cant authenticate via GUI I can not authenticate anything that requires GUI authentication...like approve software updates. After each try it says something like authentication was unsuccessful, and closes the dialog after 3 tries.\nI am on Xubuntu 14.04\nI am able to do sudo commands and authentications via the terminal, but nothing via the GUI.\nI have tried changing the password via passwd and not using any special characters etc. But this seems above my head as I am fairly new to Xubuntu/Ubuntu. I am unable to update my system so if someone can remind me also of how to do it via terminal, but my main thing is to fix GUI authentication.\nAny help appreciated.\nStuff I have tried:\nThis is not a match to any other question, as alluded, as this is: 1. a different version 2. Their solution of holding SHIFT did not work for me. 3. My issue started with GUI authentication issues first then sudo just disappeared later. \nMy user is a member of groups sudo and adm\nSudo commands work fine\nMost gksudo commands like gksudo software-center fail to authenticate except gksudo xclock which works :-)\nUPDATE\nTo my surprise now when I sudo it says I am not in sudo. when I run GROUPS im not in sudo or adm anymore? Not sure why? \nI tried to do the recovery thing...but when I reboot hitting or holding the shift does nothing. I have an SSD so my system boots in like 6 seconds. I have tried the shift key many times after when I see the blue Xubuntu screen, and before but nothing.\nSo now I need help accessing a root prompt on system so I can add myself to sudo..Ubuntu is a challenge is't it? :-)\n\nA: It seems as though I had somehow lost sudo on my account, but it degraded over time. It just was not there anymore. So I figured out how to do recovery mode in Ubuntu 14.04. 95% of what is out there says click or hold the shift key to access the grub menu, but this is not the case with me. It took me a whiiiile to discover that hitting the ESC\" button, once, after BIOS is what does it for me. This appears to be a bug or a very bad idea in UBUNTU to allow different ways to access a certain functionality.\nI was able to access grub, run recovery linux-image, then drop to root. I then ran mount -o rw,remount, then adduser myusername sudo. \nOnce I rebooted, GUI authentication worked fine again.\nAgain, I have no idea how I lost sudo....seems to me if the system will allow actions that would remove sudo from the last account with admin access, there would be some SEVERE warnings and multiple notifications. But there was not. I had no idea. \n", "Q: Want to reinstall Ubuntu 14.04 after backing up Home folder to different partition. Is it too risky? My machine is set to dual boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.10,but I barely ever use windows. The Ubuntu installation has been running for ages now, and I've kind of wrecked it by trying to tweak everything. I have tonnes of music/movies in my Home folder, and don't have an external hard disk, so I was wondering whether performing the following actions would be too risky:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize Ubuntu partition using GParted, to create just enough space to accommodate my home folder.\n\n*Copy home folder to newly created partition.\n\n*Format all other partitions, then install Windows 8, followed by Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n*Restore contents of home folder, and add the space used for backing up to the Ubuntu partition, using GParted\n\n\nThis is, of course, the easy way out; I really don't want to look up how to reset everything without reinstalling. Is this possible, and if it is, is it too risky?\nThanks for reading through, all help is appreciated!\n\nA: If you have a good backup everything is safe.\nThere is one thing you should know. Your home folder has all your \"user configured\" stuff in it. \nWhen you restore your home folder, if you want a true \"fresh\" install, do not copy over the entire folder. Only copy over what you need. For example don't copy back ~/.config instead copy only what you actually see using like ~/Documents,\n\nA: It probably really depends on your setup. I have done similar backups before and it worked out fairly well (save the home folder, reinstall Ubuntu, move home folder back). I'm no expert on Linux/Ubuntu, but I would imagine that some program dependencies might become an issue (you might have to reinstall/configure some things).\nOverall, I would say it is safe...\n", "Q: I cant install vlc in ubuntu 14.04 first I typed this: sudo apt-get update\nat the end of the progress, this is shown: \nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/pcf/miro-releases/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

Y\n\n% ls -la ~/test\nls: cannot access /home/aboettger/test: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: Because unlinking a file needs write access on the containing directory.  One can indeed get this indirectly by dint of owning the directory, since if one is the owner one can always grant onesself write access.  But in this case you'll find that your home directory is, already, writable by you.  Ownership of the directory is not the necessity.  Write access is.  That includes write access via \"other\", via group membership, or via an ACL entry, where they apply.\n\nA: If you have sufficient permission (rwx) in the directory, you can remove any file inside that directory.\nBasically the directory entry contains a table having the file names it has and their inodes. So when a rm command is given the file entry is simply removed from that directory table, it does not depend on the owner of the files themselves. Just sufficient permission on the parent directory is enough.\nAlthough the file remains valid in the filesystem until all the processes using the file completes.\nThe associated system call is unlinkat(). For example while removing the file.txt:\nunlinkat(AT_FDCWD, \"file.txt\", 0)       = 0\n\n", "Q: How do I change the language of the console permanently?

Can Ubuntu Server be installed onto a former Windows Server and control Windows 7 and up clients?  Mainly to keep people from installing software on the Windows workstations, control Windows/Microsoft Updates, block access to certain websites, control logins, disk quota, end-point security, etc.?  Mainly I want the workstations to not be able to be configured or changed by the users.\nI have been looking for links with tutorials on doing something like this but have not had any luck.\n\nA: I don't think you can achieve your goals with Ubuntu, however don't outright accept this answer so that others can respond with additional suggestions/insights.\n\nHere's what I know from your comments and from stuff at my workplace which can't be replaced with Ubuntu and such due to the requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wanted: Create users and manage what users exist\n\n*\n\n*Can be done with Active Directory like services, and they do exist for Ubuntu but I don't know what they are off the top of my head.\n\n\n*Wanted: Set up their home directories and user space files on an Ubuntu server\n\n*\n\n*There's probably a way to do this, but the Windows and Linux permission structures are wildly different.  To truly achieve this you'd need Linux to work with all Windows' permissions, and they don't match up, so control of filespace permissions is probably not possible.  (Storage is, permissions isn't)\n\n*To truly make this section work you need a Windows server with Group Policy Objects for all systems and a Windows file share server that handles Windows permissions.\n\n\n*Wanted: Control Windows/Microsoft Updates\n\n*\n\n*Impossible with Ubuntu.

You are working with Windows workstation computers.  You are looking for Windows Active Directory.  You are looking for Windows Group Policy management servers tied in with Active Directory.

I have a question, when I was working on windows, I write Client to Server Chat program by tutorial, but the I add many functions that was very usable. I am going to write user friendly app for Linux and use client to server chat program which will work, from linux to linux, linux to windows.\nWhen I make an app I upload a video on youtube. Click here to view it.\nI know programming in Visual Basic, and my question is: Can anybody show me the right way to make the program(Just tutorial or something like that)?\n\nA: There are several languages available to write programs in under Linux. Mono may be a good start for you as you are more familiar with the windows world. \nGTK (using c++ or python) seem to be very popular these days. There is always java. QT is pretty good and it works in most anything, C++ being what I see the most. \nAll in all you need to start by picking a language, and there are many to choose from. There is no \"best\" language, but, if you don't use Java or Mono, then your going to want to choose a widget set that works cross platform. QT and GTK work on most everything. \nSo pick a widget set by looking at QT and GTK and seeing which style looks better to you to code in (again tons of differences here, QT is more of a stack and GTK is more \"just widgets\" for example).\nNext pick a language that integrates well with the widgets you chose. Make sure to keep in mind cross platform compatibility.\nFinally, I would suggest you start re-writing your windows version first. So your only learning a new language and stack and not having to relearn core OS stuff.  Then you can port that code over to Linux. If you kept an eye on cross platfom compatibility, it should not be too much of a big deal. \nWhen finished you will have a code base, that can be compiled or whatever to give you an application that will run on Linux, Mac, Windows, mobile phones, toaster ovens, and car speedometers. \nAlso don't be afraid to look at current open source projects, and leverage them. Could your chat program exist as a plugin in pidgen? (for example) If it could your project just got easier and your product better. \n", "Q: ./waf configure returns 'checking for alsa: not found.'

In order to drop privileges you could write a shell script wrapper where you change the process user and group and start the interpreter without privileges.\nSolution 1: shell script wrapper\n\n\n*\n\n*You need an unprivileged user which you can switch to (create one with sudo adduser --system --no-create-home [username] if necessary, but your login account should be fine)\n\n*start python with sudo su -c ipython [username] and check that it's unprivileged with \nimport os\nos.getuid() # should be [username]'s UID\nos.geteuid() # should be [username]'s UID\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.check_call([\"sudo\", \"-i\"]) # should raise CalledProcessError\n\nThis solution provides only sufficient flexibility for starting the interpreter. If you want to write code and deal with privileged and unprivileged parts, consider solution 2.\nSolution 2: drop privileges in python\nIn case you want to manage privileges in the python interpreter:\nThe decision where to drop privileges in your code isn't trivial and needs to take into consideration the tradeoff between comfort (you don't want to enter your password all the time), security (as few code as possible should run with privileges) and maintainability (as much code as possible shouldn't be concerned with privileges).\nApproaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo offers a way to acquire privileges for a command in an unprivileged interpreter, but requires user interaction and makes it difficult to run your code without privileges (because you have the sudo statement in all you commands).\n\n*If you start the interpreter with privileges you can drop privileges with os.set[/e/r/s]uid and os.set[/e/r/s]gid.

Later, if I want to add some more tuples to that text file, it should not only add new tuples but also remove duplicates in-place, if any.\nCommand I wrote was- \ntshark -nr new.pcap.pcapng -T fields -e http.authbasic -Y \"http.proxy_authorization\" | sort | uniq >> pass.txt | sort | uniq\n\nBut it just appends the sorted distinct output of the pcap file in the pass.txt file, and then doesnt sort the file again as required. What changes should I make in the above code to accomplish this ?\n\nA: Append the data to the file and the command, then sort and unique the file in a separate operation:\ntshark -nr new.pcap.pcapng -T fields -e http.authbasic -Y \"http.proxy_authorization\" >> pass.txt\nsort -o pass.txt -u pass.txt\n\nsort can do the job of uniq (using the -u option). By specifying the output file (-o) with the same name as the input file, sort will replace the file's contents with the sorted, unique output.\n", "Q: ADB on ARM7 with Ubuntu 14.04 Im needing to get ADB version 1.0.32 installed on my Beaglebone black Rev b loaded with Ubuntu 14.04.

I selected my 3TB hard drive and chose the option not to partition it, but do a complete full erase (i.e. not the quick-erase option). It reckons that it will take 14 hours to complete. Can someone explain why it takes this long? In Windows it use to take about 5 seconds, but I have a feeling that it must not have truly formatted it or something.\n\nA: A quick format establishes the format of your filesystem which involves writing small structures to certain specific locations on the drive, but it does not write to the rest of the drive at all.  This usually only takes a matter of seconds or about a minute, depending on the filesystem type.\nA full format does this but also wipes the rest of the drive.  The speed of this can depend on the drive, and may take hours because it needs to, at least, write the full drive's capacity to the drive.  In worst case, say it's a 3TB drive over USB 2.0, a full format would take around 20 hours.  A fast internal 3TB drive may take less than 10 hours.\nNew hard drives come with their entire surface ready-to-use and there is no longer any way to alter it this at a low level or to initialize it in any way. A full format is of doubtful benefit at any time: you may do one if you suspect problems with the drive surface (in which case a full format may detect some kinds of error) but even then there are better testing tools. A full format will wipe any deleted but recoverable data remaining on the drive but again if secure erase is your goal there are better tools for this.\nIf you want your format to take only a matter of seconds, choose a quick format.\nNote: it's safe to interrupt a regular full format before it's finished and switch to a quick format.\n\nA: I think that in windows you only rewrite some blocks, which are crucial to read the files and in ubuntu when you \"fully rewrite\" it could actually mean rewrite all the 3TB with zeros. You can check your disk's write speed and divide 3TB by it and you should get cca that much if my thoughts are right (or a bit less). But I'm no pro, so any answers covering this have a high risk of getting +1 from me :D\nHope I helped at least a bit :)\n\nA: Sometimes disk creator or gparted messes up my USB  stick so I quick format it with:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=1\n\nIt is very quick writing 512 bytes to remove the MBR (Master Boot Record).\nIn simple terms you changed count size from 1 to 6 billion. This is normally only done when you dispose of an old drive with financial secrets.\nYou can safely abort the long format and restart with creating partitions only.\n", "Q: How to make Bootable USB of Windows 8.1 from Ubuntu 14.10 I want to make a bootable USB of Windows 8.1 from Ubuntu 14.10 so that I can install it on my laptop. \nI tried using winusb and UNetbootin, but both of them failed. \nWhat else can I try?\nI have Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit iso, and I am using Ubuntu 14.10 64-bit.\n\nA: So for a UEFI computer we'll need to install the gdisk-noicu package to format the usb drive.

Moreover 14.04 ships both versions (See the release manifest) so in theory you didn't need to install a newer version to get 1.0.\nFirst of all I would ensure that the system packages are installed properly, open a terminal and type the following command:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-0 libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-0 libgstreamer-plugins-good1.0-0 libgstreamer1.0-0\n\nThis will reinstall a bunch of gstreamer 1.0 packages that should allow to use the base plugin elements (such as playbin and autoaudiosink).\nBut since you installed gstreamer from source, you may have to remove the libraries that you installed in /usr/local/lib.\n\nA: In the end I reinstalled Ubuntu Studio all over.\n\nA: Although I'm kind of late in answering this question, still I'll leave a solution here in case someone else also has this error. A few days I also self-compiled and installed gstreamer1.0 in Ubuntu distribution and now totem does not work. Tried re-installing all codecs and plugins but somehow the base plugins (playbin, camerabin etc.) won't work (and probably never will). What I can suggest is a workaround to this problem that will not use gstreamer in the first place. Instead of using totem to view videos you can use VLC Media Player.

I think that at simply doesn't accept the pipe. Any ideas?\n\nA: Piping to at works just fine. For example, the following works fine:\necho 'date > /tmp/foo' | at now + 1 minute\n\nHowever, you can simplify the quoting if you use heredocs:\nat -m $hour:$minute <<EOF\n/home/user/sipcmd -P sip -u 10shi -c swordfish -w 127.0.0.1 -f \"msyb.wav\" -x \"c$extension;vmsyb.wav;ws1;\nEOF\n\nThose quotes will go as-is to the command, so decide whether you actually want them.\nLastly, you have tagged your question bash, but your script as shown doesn't have a shebang.

I do have a good camera though so I've taken a few photos of the documents I want to scan... However they look like photos of paper, not scanned documents:\n\n\n*\n\n*Images aren't flat\n\n*Lighting isn't even (shadows as the page warps, etc)\n\n*Text obviously isn't processed into copy-pasteable PDF text.\n\n\nThey simply aren't suitable for professional use, but they're close.\nI'm looking for some thing (or method) that can do any or all of the above so I can go from a number of JPG files to a single [optionally] annotated PDF of the whole thing, that's in the right format (A4 typically).\nAny suggestions (short of going out and buying a new scanner)?\n\nA: There are several ways to do that. Though all my suggeed ways have one problem they won't really flatten your picture. A more or less good picture would be still required. \nOne easy way is that you try the software ScanTailor (scantailor.org)\nsudo apt-get install scantailor \n\nIt takes you through 6 steps to optimize your photos. At the last step you can select the option \"Equalize illumination\" this will give you a nice clean look!\n\nPersonally I usually just use GIMP. But you need some basic skills to reach your aim. \nsudo apt-get install gimp \n\n\n\n*\n\n*crop the picture in the wanted way\n\n*use the Colors -> Curves option to manipulate the color output in a way you want it... \n\n\n\n\nAnother nice little program is gscan2pdf, where you can also load photos and export them as PDF. There is is even a link to GIMP so you can improve the photo with the above described steps.\nsudo apt-get install gscan2pdf \n\n\nA: To generate a printable copy or a PDF from a camera photo of a document we have to manually convert quite a lot achieve an image similar to he output from a scanner. Most of these conversions can be done with Gimp.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to make the best you can original source image:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a bright light to reduce pixel noise, but to avoid reflexions, bleeding, or uneven light dispersion don't use a flash unless you have a studio flash equipment.\n\n*If possible choose to light the source from at least two sides (top-bottom or right-left)\n\n*Take the photo from a larger distance using a telephoto rather than a wide-angle lens.\n\n*Use a tripod to avoid shaking artifacts.\n\n*Point the camera orthogonal to the surface of the source.\n\n*Include some space bordering the original source.\n\n\n*Consider desaturation to greyscale for better contrast and removal of coloured pixel artifacts.\n\n\n*Adjust brightness and contrast to make the presumably grey background white, and the black letters pitch black.\n\n\n*\n\n*This can quickly be done with the Gimp Colors > Levels tool where we can drag the black point (left) and the white point (right) or pick the black/white points  with the color picker.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Shadows on bent corners may no be removed without also removing parts of the text (see 6.)\n\n\n*Remove cushion distortion?\nDepending on our photo lens quality and the zoom level we had used we may have some cushion artifacts leading to bending of the document's outer borders. There are plugins to also remove these artifacts but we may find it quicker to choose a zoom level of our camera where they are minimal only. After cropping (5.) we may not even notice them any more. So removing cushion artifacts may only be needed in case our source image has a lot of straight lines in the outer parts.\n\n*Rotate and crop or perspective transform the image if needed.\nUnlike a scanner our camera may not get the source in parallel to the image borders. The Gimp Rotate or Perspective tool will give us a visual feedback to be able to rotate or adjust the perspective of an image until the text lines are in parallel to the page. \n\nPerspective Tool on the right side\nNow we can select the document source with the rectangle select tool to crop the image inside of the document.\n\n\n*Remove unwanted shadows from bending, folds, or vignetting artifacts from the camera lens.\n\n\n*\n\n*These shadows are hard to remove and there is not a plugin or automatic filter to help us.\n\n*We could in theory overlay a gradient fill to these regions but it may not lead to the expected results, hence may not be worth the time we would need.\n\n*The quickest method therefore is to simply use the eraser tool to remove all those ugly shadows outside of the text (which we should spare).\n  erased -> \n\n\n*Scale image?\nDepending on the camera resolution scaling up the image to a scanner image size will only increase the file size but will have no benefit on the image quality. Scaling down will remove details. Thererfore we should not scale the image but adjust the print size from the printer dialog (or below in 8.).\n\n*Generate PDF\nWe can import our now nicely manually restored image to LibreOffice (Insert > Media) to \n\n\n*\n\n*Define its dimensions\n\n*Export as PDF\n\n*Print (for me printing from LibreOffice leads to a desired result much more often than anything else).\n\n\n\nA: If you already have the image of the document, just download CamScanner app to your phone/tablet. It will allow you import the image, then will do a suggested crop and allow you to flatten as well as adjust colours/contrast etc. Only takes a minute. \n", "Q: Why does my app not load the translation files of the lib I have an click app that depend on some lib,\nand i have package that lib in the click package.\nthe lib loaded well. but the translations file (.mo) are not founded.\nmy click file free look like this:  \n/\n/share\n/share/locale/<LANG>/LC_MESSAGES/somlib.mo\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/somelib.so\n\nOf course, there is more files, but that what i think that relevant for the question.\ni also try to put it on /usr/share/locale/<LANG>/LC_MESSAGES/somlib.mo\nbut what i have found, that the lib try to find the translations files on real /usr/share/locale/... what i do not have access to it, with click package to put files there...\n(i copy the files to this path with mv, and it is work)\nI tried to use strace to know where that lib look for his files, but i don't know how to do it on the phone (using emulator). \ntrying strace qmlscene gave me error that i have to connect to mir server, or something like that.  \nThank you.\n\nA: The directory where gettext will search for translations for a particular translation domain is controlled by the bindtextdomain function.

So where the library might run:\nbindtextdomain (PACKAGE, PACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR);\n\nYou might change it to something like:\nconst char *app_dir = getenv(\"APP_DIR\");\nif (app_dir) {\n    char *localedir = NULL;\n    asprintf(&localedir, \"%s/share/locale\", app_dir);\n    bindtextdomain(PACKAGE, localedir);\n    free(localedir);\n} else {\n    /* Not running as a click package: use compiled in default */\n    bindtextdomain(PACKAGE, PACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR);\n}\n\n\n*Make a second call to bindtextdomain that will run after the library's initialisation that sets the correct directory for the library's translation domain (possibly using code similar to the above).\nIt is hard to offer any more advice without knowing more about the specifics.\n", "Q: logout current user from script I would like to create a script that:\n\n\n*\n\n*run some commands\n\n*execute sudo su - [some other username]\n\n*after I exit from [some other username] -> logout\n\n\nExample: test.sh\necho \"test script\"\nsudo su\nlogout\n\nIf I run a script like this:\necho \"test\"\nsudo su\nwhomai\n\nI get the wanted result:\n[wolfy@ubuntusrv ~ ]# ./test.sh\ntest\n[root@ubuntusrv wolfy]# date\nFri 19 Jun 10:56:52 CEST 2015\n[root@ubuntusrv wolfy]# echo bla\nbla\n[root@ubuntusrv wolfy]# exit\nwolfy\n[wolfy@ubuntusrv ~ ]#\n\nAs you can see, the script runs my echo command and then I sudo su to root, where I can do what I need to do and after I quit root session the script execute the last (whoami) command.\nMy problem is that I can't logout myself at the end of this script. \nI need a way to do this without root privileges.\nCan someone help me?\nAdditional explanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*when I run sudo su - username (userA) I need to provide my password (wolfy) to login as the other user (userA). Then I work for the whole session with that user (userA) and when I logout from that user (userA) I would like to automatic logout from my (wofly) user.\n\n*using sudo command is not an option\n\n\nA: Perhaps all you want to do is:\nexec ./test.sh\n\nThis replaces your current shell process by the script, so that when it finishes there is nothing left to run.\n\nA: Typically, to run a command as root, sudo is sufficient.\n#!/bin/bash\necho test\nsudo whoami\n\nIf you insist on using su,for whatever reason, you can use -c flag :\n#!/bin/bash\necho test\nsudo su -c whoami\n\nAnd here's the result, same in both cases:\n$ ./test.sh                                                                                                                           \ntest\n[sudo] password for xieerqi: \nroot\n\nIf you want to enter root shell, use sudo -i\nserg@ubuntu[/home/xieerqi] \n$ sudo -i\n# date\nFri Jun 19 13:16:15 EEST 2015\n# whoami\nroot\n# exit\nserg@ubuntu[/home/xieerqi] \n$ \n\nWith su :\nserg@ubuntu[/home/xieerqi] \n$ sudo su -c /bin/bash\nbash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device\nbash: no job control in this shell\nroot@anaconda:/home/xieerqi# date\nFri Jun 19 12:41:06 EEST 2015\nroot@anaconda:/home/xieerqi# echo blah\nblah\nroot@anaconda:/home/xieerqi# exit\nexit\nserg@ubuntu[/home/xieerqi] \n$ whoami\nxieerqi\n\nIf you want to run commands as another user, not only root, you can use sudo -u username command\n$ sudo -u testuser whoami\ntestuser\n\nSame idea with su:\nserg@ubuntu[/home/xieerqi] \n$ sudo su -c bash testuser\nbash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device\nbash: no job control in this shell\ntestuser@anaconda:/home/xieerqi$ whoami\ntestuser\ntestuser@anaconda:/home/xieerqi$ exit\nexit\nserg@ubuntu[/home/xieerqi] \n$ whoami\nxieerqi\n\n\nA: A logout in a script doesn't affect anything, since logout only works for login shells, and scripts aren't typically run as login shells.\nIt seems to me that you're logging on via SSH (or something), running as another user and immediately logging out. In that case, just source the script, so that the commands are run in your current shell. Then, logout will work.\nOr, you can use exec, but in that case, it isn't logout that's taking effect - logout will fail, and the end of the script simply causes it to exit. Distinction without a difference, I suppose.\nOr, if you find it cumbersome to use . ./script, define a function with braces:\nswitchuser () {\n  echo \"test script\"\n  sudo su -\n  exit\n}\n\nCommands in braces run in the current shell, and commands in parentheses are run in a sub-shell. Add this to your .bashrc, then you can simply do:\nswitchuser\n\n", "Q: How to make ambiance title bar corners squared?

Also, you do not explicitly tell if your setup ever worked before you set up your website.\nGuessing: If your iptables are complete the way that you put them, then this indeed explain the symptoms you describe. You just allow input from that particular IP number and not from any other. What you are likely to achieve is to allow contacts to your site from remote sites that you have contacted from your machine before, so they can deliver the data you requested. You achieve that with\niptables -m comment --comment \"Allow related packages from the InterNet\" -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n\nTo constrain the access to your website to the internal network, you may also want to specify the network device that your web server listens on.

Most of the discussions provide an answer in which they replace the Unity desktop with the GNOME desktop.\nI want to do this upgrade without adding any other desktop environment.\nKindly provide step by step method if possible.\nP.S.: this upgrade is required for installing ARC GTK Theme.\n\nA: You'll probably need install a version of a Ubuntu that supports 3.14 then (i.e. 15.04).\nAlternately, you could work your way through redoing versions of the relevant packages from source so they don't break 14.04 (probably very difficult), or redo the theme to work better with older versions\nAlso, installing Gnome/gtk 3.14 in 14.10 (and probably 3.12 in 14.04) with the available GNOME PPAs [1] [2] breaks Unity, so probably would make a bigger mess trying to install the available 3.14 packages in 14.04.\n", "Q: Creating windows bootable DVD I tried creating a windows 8.1 bootable DVD using Brasero (iso), the process completed successfully but it failed to boot from the DVD, it just goes straight to my windows desktop.

I was watching a movie on the TV (by HDMI connection) so back then I configured the audio to be played by HDMI output. I powered off the laptop without reverting the configuration.\nBut now I was not connected to HDMI and in sound configuration only internal speakers were showing.\nIn the end, the configuration option to blame was to be found in VLC itself. While playing, Audio > Audio device > (select your internal speakers). I seems it did not revert itself to internal speakers, because HDMI output was still selected. Now even Totem is working.\nI hope this experience helps someone!\n\nA: According to help.ubuntu::\n\nNo sound\n  If you don't hear any sound, try: (a) click System -> Preferences -> Sounds. Then click a sound in the bottom list, and make sure that it's not already selected. You should hear the sound you selected. If not, make sure your speakers are working and that your volume is up. Try clicking another sound in the list, after ajusting your volume. Also make sure your speakers are working. Once you're done, select the sound it was on before and click OK. (b) downloading VLC Media Player by clicking Applications -> Ubuntu Software Centre or Applications -> Add/Remove Appications. Search for \"VLC Media Player\" and download the program with the orange cone icon. If you don't see an orange cone, the icon might be a cardboard box with all kinds of stuff sticking out of it. In that case, look at the discriptions. Install VLC and then use it to play your movie or DVD.\n\nIf this doesn't work, just try to install media codes.\n\nA: If you changed manually once the output in your sound settings (for me that was an HDMI audio controller to have the sound of my home cinema), disconnecting the HDMI cable and trying to hear back your built in audio card does not work. I had to connect back to the HDMI cable, change manually the output to my built in audio and then it worked.\n\nA: Open nautillus. Open your home folder. Press Ctrl+H. Open the .config folder. Delete the vlc folder. Audio goes back to normal.\n\nA: Sound Settings -> Applications -> See If 'Videos' Is Muted\n\nA: First open any video\nThen Go to Settings --> Sound ---> Applications and increase the sound of your application (if lowered)\n\nA: All my MP4s were \"muted\" for no apparent reason.\nI found that I had previously configured the sound to go to the HDMI port, but this time HDMI was not attached.  So I just used the \"Settings\" control panel, \"Sound\" section to re-select \"built-in speakers\".\n\nA: u just need to connect the HDMI to an external input and go to settings>sound>output and choose the HDMI output \nthen remove the HDMI cable and back again to the built in source \nit's just a bug \n\nA: I'm running Debian jessie and had the exact same problem as original poster, Audacious & web browsers played audio, but VLC and GNOME Mplayer were muted. I had previously made a change to VLC preferences to capture stills from video. As far as I know, the only changes were the path and frame rate for the scene filter, plus enabled the scene video filter. When I tried to watch a movie with GNOME Mplayer, audio was muted. Audacious played the audio of the exact same mp4 no problem. I disabled the scene video filter and checked all the audio settings (default) in VLC. Still VLC and GNOME Mplayer did not have audio.\nSince I usually run just the defaults in VLC, I clicked reset preferences, and I now have audio.\n\nA: Go to video that you downloaded and then open one video with VLC. Then click audio, in the audio section there is muted, click it.\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: If you changed your pulseaudio settings for a high resolution sound card you need to make sure the default rate is a multiple of 44.1kHz but also lower than 192kHz.\nThese settings work:\n# From /etc/pulse/daemon.conf\ndefault-sample-format = s32le\ndefault-sample-rate = 176400\nalternate-sample-rate = 192000\n\n", "Q: Udev rule is executed twice because Android Smartphone is mounted 2 times I need your help. :-)\nFirst I want to excuse for my Englisch, I´m from Germany.\nI have a Bash script which should be executed every time an Android Phone is connected through USB. This is done by my udev rule. It works but there is a major problem.\nA little more Background. \nMy Bash script should install Apps on all connected Android Phones separately. To achieve this I use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and the USB-Debugging mode on the Android device. Every time you connect a phone to the USB port you first need to allow USB-Debugging connection on the phone to access it via the ADB.\nAs I said it works, but when connecting the device is mounted and ask to allow USB-Debugging. Then the script starts and immediately stops and waits because the device unmounts itself. Then the device mounts itself again, asks again to allow USB-Debugging and a second instance of the bash script is called and both instances of the script are now executed. \nThis is worse and inefficient.\nI hope someone could help me.\nHere is some code.\nUDEV Rule\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"0bb4\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"12d1\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"24e3\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"17ef\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"1004\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"22b8\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"10a9\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"1d4d\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"05c6\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"054c\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"0fce\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"091e\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"04e8\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/tmp.sh $attr{serial}\"\n\ntmp.sh called through UDEV Rule\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho /usr/local/bin/installApps.sh $1 | at now\n\ninstallApps.sh called through tmp.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd /home/android/Schreibtisch/Apps\nadb -s $1 wait-for-device\n\nfor APK in $(ls *.apk);\ndo\n    adb -s $1 install $APK\ndone\n\nEdit 1:\nHere is my output of udevadm monitor\nKERNEL[384.540419] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2 (usb)\nKERNEL[384.659326] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.0 (usb)\nKERNEL[384.660123] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.1 (usb)\nKERNEL[384.660969] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.1/tty/ttyACM0 (tty)\nKERNEL[384.663343] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.2 (usb)\nUDEV  [384.663375] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2 (usb)\nKERNEL[384.663386] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.3 (usb)\nUDEV  [384.669236] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.0 (usb)\nUDEV  [384.670955] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.3 (usb)\nUDEV  [384.672776] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.1 (usb)\nUDEV  [384.674355] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.2 (usb)\nUDEV  [384.690927] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.1/tty/ttyACM0 (tty)\n\nThe Output of it does not differ in any way at my second USB-Port.\nEdit 2:\nI somehow managed it to reduce the errors. \nBut now there is a slightly different problem and I don´t know if a lock file will help.\nNow on nearly every 10th device not all apps are installed.

It uses same debug idProduct. I though it's possibly changing USB interfaces (add USB debug one) after confirming the message, but it is NOT. It does not reconnect as your case, may be not all devices have same behavior.\nOne solution that may work in whatever case you have, is to use a lock file.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif !

It has dhcp functionalities and it gives ip addresses to my other two computers. There is an implicit deny in the network. However the implicit deny only works when I try to access the ip of the ubuntu server/router. When I try to contact from this pc to the other it works. Shouldn't the firewall rules apply for the whole network?\n\nA: No.\nWhen you make your Ubuntu server into a firewall/router, it does become a complete firewall protecting your entire LAN (Local Area Network) from the WAN (Wide Area Network), or internet in general. The quaility of that protection depends on how good and complete your iptables rules set is.\nNow, and if I understand correctly, you are asking if your Ubuntu server firewall/router can be used to prevent, in some ways, two computers on your LAN from communicating with each other. No. At least in a typical LAN, those two computers do not need to involve the server at all when they communicate with each other.\n", "Q: Displays setup incorrectly after waking I have a slightly irritating issue that I haven't found an answer for on the Internet. \nI have a laptop running Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 with an integrated Intel graphics card, a discrete Nvidia graphics card, and I've connected a Samsung monitor to use as a second display using the HDMI port. \nThe setup works fine and does exactly what I want it to, for the most part. The laptop serves as the primary display, the Samsung monitor serves as the secondary display.\nBut when I resume my computer after it has been suspended, the Samsung monitor comes to life first as the primary display and the laptop display is turned off. \nThe fix is easy. If I open gnome-control-center display, make any change, and then click Revert Settings, my original setup is applied. \nI'd like to find the problem and fix it or, failing that, write a script to more or less automate the Revert Settings process after resume so that I don't have to do this manually every time I open my laptop. \nAny advice?\nedit: Another bit of information\nxrandr results when displays are working properly\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 3840 x 1080, maximum 16384 x 16384\nHDMI-0 connected 1920x1080+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 477mm x 268mm\nDP-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\neDP1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 382mm x 215mm\n\nxrandr results when displays are not working properly\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 16384 x 16384\nHDMI-0 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 477mm x 268mm\nDP-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\neDP1 connected primary (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\n\nA: Do you use the nvidia proprietary drivers or the nouveau open drivers? (If you don't know run lsmod | grep nouveau if it gives you any results, it's nouveau; if lsmod | grep nvidia gives you any results, it's the proprietary nvidia drivers). If you have the nvidia drivers you should be able to configure the monitors from the nvidia-settings utility that comes with the drivers. \nOr you could try xrandr --output DVI-I-0 --auto --primary --left-of DVI-I-1\n as superuser, where DVI-I-0 is the name of the monitor (should work regardless of drivers)\n\nA: I've had a similar problem.

I'm running an Ubuntu LTSP setup at a school with about 60 unique users.  Occasionally, we need to share a document, create a directory or place a config file in every user's account. Obviously, it's not efficient to do this one at a time.\nI know I can place a file in every user's home directory with:\nls /home/ | xargs -n 1 sudo cp -i <file>\n\nBut what if I need to put it somewhere specific, such as  ~/.config/autostart?\nOr what if I need to create the directory ~/Desktop/foo/ for every user?\nThanks for your help, and if anyone can suggest resources for me to learn more that would be awesome.\n\nA: cp has an option to specify the target directory separately: -t. So you can do:\nfor u in /home/*\ndo\n    sudo cp -t \"$u/.config/autostart\" -i <file>\n    sudo mkdir \"$u/Desktop/foo\"\ndone\n\nIn general, there's no simple way to manage user's home directories. You can specify what gets created in it when the home directory is first created, but after that, it's each user for itself.\nThen, you'd have to use some form of scripting. In this case, I have used shell scripting. Check out the TLDP guides on Bash and scripting in Bash.

The\nvirtual memory on hard-disk is called swap space. Virtual memory\nmeans the perm storage is used as temp space for RAM. So, when your\nRAM is full, the OS can off-load parts of it currently not used data\nto disk, therefore free up memory for application that needs it.\n\n*Also, Linux uses RAM as cache for file data (from hard-disk).\n(Because RAM's IO speed is a thousand times faster than hard disk,\nso OS will load disk data to RAM as cache)\n\nexample: output of free -m (“-m” means mega bytes).\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          5798       2145       3653          0        160       1121\n-/+ buffers/cache:        862       4935\nSwap:         5885          0       5885\n\nin the first row Mem, the total 5798 is the total RAM.\nused + free = total. Check: 2145 + 3653 = 5798.\n“used” includes used for disk cache purposes.\n“cached” is amount of disk data sitting in RAM for fast access.\nSo, real free should be “free + buffers + cached”, and in this example it is 3653 + 160 + 1121 = 4934.\nand actually used should be “used - buffers - cached” (2145 - 160 - 1121 = 864).\nAnd if we add 4934 and 864 we get the “total”.\nExplanation of free is quoted from http://xahlee.info/linux/linux_free_memory.html\n", "Q: Gedit PHP syntax highlighting Does anyone know how to fix this issue?

I think it probably happened with the update to 15.04, but I can't swear to that. \nI can still use  alt-> or  ctrln to cycle through windows but I don't see a way to hop right to the window I want anymore. So ... how do I get that functionality back? Or is there a new way I can hop straight to a specific window in irssi? \n\nA: Finally worked this out. The alt+number conflicts with gnome-terminal's keyboard shortcuts to switch between tabs. That was always the case, but in older versions of gnome-terminal the combo would switch tabs if there were tabs to switch to and switch IRSSI windows if there weren't.\nIf you disable or re-map the \"Switch to Tab ...\" shortcuts (at Terminal > Preferences >  Shortcuts) you can use alt2 in IRSSI again. \nDouble-click on the shortcut key and you'll see \"New accelerator...\" -- from there Backspace will disable the shortcut, or you can create a new shortcut. I used ctrlalt2. \n\nA: You can also use the commands /1, /2, ... /N, which is what I like to do.\n\nA: Click on Terminal icon > Preferences > Shortcuts\nThen, uncheck Enable Shortcuts\nAlt + 1 for example will work now. The problem for the terminal window is that the alt keys are mapped to switching to the terminal tabs (if you use those). \n", "Q: how to remove best-deals-products.com from firefox When i try to load any web oage (askubuntu.com for example), noscript addon blocks some scripts from a domain called best-deals-products.com\nI've searched about this topic on duckduckgo and google and result goes to lenovo and windows related products while i'm using kubuntu on my desktop computer which is not made by lenovo.\n\nA: The problem is a plugin in Firefox somewhere is doing this.  We have to identify and remove that plugin.  There's two ways to go about that.\n\nThe destructive method:\nThis is essentially trying to kill a fly with a huge weapon instead of a fly swatter.\nBurn (aka delete and reset) your Firefox profile, and remove all addons. Then install NoScript, and try again and see this happens. If not, then something in your profile (addons, etc.) was involved.  (WARNING NOTE: Burning your firefox profile will remove all your configurations, cookies, favorites, addons, etc.)\n\nThe not-so-destructive method:\nThis is systematic identification and removal of the plugin causing issues.\nAlternatively, a less destructive option is to disable your addons one at a time until you find the addon that is doing this, then disable/remove that addon.  This will save your favorites and such.\n\nA: The culprit is \"1-Click YouTube Video Downloader\" Firefox Addon.

It would be of great help if someone could suggest and explain the commands in installing Hope software.The manual provides the following steps:\nI.  To install hope, follow the procedures described below.\n1. To install hope, make a bin directory under your home\n   directory. Suppose that the home directory is ~cad and\n   the source code of hope is under the directory\n   ~cad/etg/hope.\n\n2. Go to the directory hope.\n   \"cd ~cad/etg/hope\".\n\n3. To compile hope, type \"make\".\n   An execution file \"hope\" will be created.\n\n4. Copy or symbolically link hope to the directory ~cad/bin using\n   \"cp hope ~cad/bin\" or\n   \"ln -s hope ~cad/bin/hope\".\n\nII. Before using hope, each user should set the following\n    two environment variables as described below.\n1. Set  your path (or PATH) environment variable to include\n   ~cad/bin in your search path. This variable, in general,\n   can be found in your \".cshrc\" file. For example, the line\n\n   set path = ( .... ~cad/bin)\n\n   includes ~cad/bin to your search path.\n\n2. Set the HOPE_MAN environment variable to indicate the\n   directory hope, where the on-line manual of hope is\n   located, using the setenv command as shown below.\n\n   \"setenv HOPE_MAN ~cad/etg/hope\"\n\n   If you use hope frequently, add the above command to your\n   \".cshrc\" file.\n\n\nA: The manual should also tell what to put in the ~cad/etg/hope directory.  \nAll the listed commands should be typed at the Terminal prompt. Hold CTRL and ALT keys, then press T - that will open a Terminal.\nEach command needs a press on ENTER at the end, this to get it executed.\nNote that ~cad in the description above may be directly replaced by $USER - and the instructions will work directly (with that change).\nSo \"cd ~cad/etg/hope\"  becomes cd $USER/etg/hope\nCreate the hope directory, if it doesn't exist:\nmkdir -p $USER/etg/hope\nCreate the bin directory, if it doesn't exist:\nmkdir -p $USER/bin\nThis more complex command will tell which file that contains \"PATH\" (the portion before ':' is the name).\ncd; grep PATH .* 2>&1 | grep -vE 'dir|denied'\nYou need to edit that file and append :$USER/bin to the end of the line that contains PATH= \nTo edit the file, type\nnano name_of_the_file\nWith nano running; the bottom of the screen will contain keys to press to access functions in nano - i.e. saving the file, and exiting nano.\nNote that ^ denotes holding down CTRL and pressing the listed key.\nIf the 'complex command' above doesn't print anything, then there is NO file that contains PATH; then type:\necho >>.bashrc 'set PATH=$PATH:$USER/bin'\nnote the use of '-quotes, this is an important difference here. \nThen:\nsetenv HOPE_MAN $USER/etg/hope\n... add it to the end of the same file (on a new line) as where you put PATH e.g. with\nnano .bashrc\n... if that is where PATH ended up.\n", "Q: My USB port not working after booting ubuntu I just install Ubuntu and some of my ports aren't working.

I bought a Dell laptop used, and it had Ubuntu 14.04 on it, but I prefer Windows. I noticed that there was a sticker on the corner of my laptop that said \"Windows Vista Basic\" and another one that says, \"Intel Core 2 Duo inside\". I would like to switch back to Windows, but I don't know how. Also, I am not able to use a disc to switch because the disc drive doesn't work.\n\nA: First, try to determine if you have Windows still on that laptop. Open a terminal with CtrlAltT and run blkid. If you see an entry there that has TYPE=\"ntfs\", then you've still got windows on that laptop. If you don't--the only option is to install windows after having purchased a license and appropriate method of installation--usb or cd. \nIf you have an ntfs entry, then reboot the laptop, when the system starts up, hold SHIFT key and you should enter the OS selection screen (commonly known as grub). There you will find an entry for Windows.\nChances are you're gonna need to reset windows password. If that's the case, use one of the recovery tools. My personal favorite is Trinity Rescue. I keep it on a cd (for those lovely moments when i forget my windows password), but you can use usb as well.\nGood luck !\n", "Q: Installing Window 8.1 in VirtualBox How do I install Windows 8.1 in VirtualBox?

I am running Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop, and whenever I run \ncat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"MHz\"\n\nI get varying speeds. I thought that clockspeed is a fixed property, which can be under clocked or overclocked. But is this behaviour normal?\n\n\nA: This is what the CPU governor does - observe the usage and adjust frequency accordingly. CPU frequency scaling is a pretty standard technique for power saving. There are tools to manage frequency scaling, cpupower from linux-tools-common is one such.\nTo look at current governor settings, you can inspect the folders in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq. For example, the available maximum frequency of my CPUs:\n$ tail /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq \n==> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq <==\n3301000\n\n==> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq <==\n3301000\n\n==> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq <==\n3301000\n\n==> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq <==\n3301000\n\nThe governor parameters might have a different (lower) maximum value, stored in the corresponding scaling_max_freq files.\n", "Q: How can I force a command to execute before an application starts running I want to perform certain actions via a bash script before opening any application eg. firefox/ deluge/ VLC via GUI or CLI.

Suggestions on locations?\nThanks\n\nA: They are python based.  /usr/bin/landscape-sysinfo opens up a python library:\nfrom landscape.sysinfo.deployment import run\n\nWhich is located under:\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/landscape/sysinfo\n\nBut, you will probably have a difficult time \"just adding color\" here as the package will be updated from time to time wiping out your changes.  But feel free to mess around with it. :)\nNote this package is completely open source and housed in the landscape-client source code.

For that the SSD must have a hardware controller that is TRIM-ready. It is not always the case. \nIn a first phase of use is, i.e. when the brand new SSD has just been installed and is still relatively new, all the SSD blocks have not yet been written over at least once. During that phase TRIM does not kick in systematically and brings limited benefit to the overall r/w speed. \nAfter that early phase, which depends on a number of factors, among them how much you write・access the SSD, Wop's will slown down to reach a speed plateau. \nAt that stage, a rule of thumb is that TRIM more than halves write-times on TRIM-ready SSDs with respect to the same hardware without TRIM enabled. Some maintain that the regular use of fstrim, the garbage-collection utility that actually carries out the zero-rewrite on already once written but now discarded blocks, will boost your write-speed by a factor of 4  (yes, 400%!) or more. I (and most people) have no way of controlling that, short of isolating and looking at blocks being written with and without fstrim 's garbage collection at work.\nHTH, at least conceptually. To know more you will have to delve in a number of rather technical white papers. They get seriously abstruse to the non-expert.\nOn the matter of disabling TRIM, first check that your SSD IS TRIM ready and TRIM is enabled:\n$ sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep \"TRIM supported\"\n\nCAUTION: read your man page on hdparm before using it. You can thoroughly corrupt your system in case of misuse. The command above is completely harmless though.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you get a blank then TRIM is not enabled ->   case closed\n\n*If you get * Data Set Management TRIM supported (limit 8 blocks) then check that TRIM is actually active on your machine.\nOn Ubuntu, there are two possibilities (known to me):\n\n\n*\n\n*you may have a discard as mount option in your /etc/fstab file, for any SSD device typically formatted as either ext3 or ext4. In case your mounted volume has the ext3 format, the discard mount option is known to actually constrain the volume to be read-only. That would get anybody's attention rather rapidly I think. So chances are any volume with the discard mount option will be ext4.\n\n*you can program fstrim to run automatically on a regular basis (hourly, daily, weekly or otherwise). To check that you have fstrim so programmed, enter the following in terminal:\n$ find   /etc/   trim   |   egrep   fstrim\nAt least on Ubuntu 14.04.x, which is what I run these days, fstrim is scheduled to kick in once a week, which is about right for any normal desktop user. You might want to go up to a daily frequency if you run a data write-intensive services, i.e. a performance oriented database management system. WADR, somehow, if you had to ask, I doubt it is the case. \nFinally, yes, suppressing fstrim or removing it from its /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} directory will stop the trimming process on your machine. \nMy opinion (provided at your request and not as a recommendation you should necessarily follow): \nYou are probably safe leaving that fstrim file where it is. If you prefer disabling it, go and buy an equivalent conventional disc based (HDD) drive to replace it. You might be better off than with an SSD with no TRIM activated, having paid a premium for it. But frankly using your extracted SSD as a paper-press would be a pity. That would be taking the discard option for TRIM garbage collection quite literally. \n\nA: after Samsung investigation the problem was due to a bug on Linux Kernel on raid. It looks like there is a misunderstanding between raid driver and scsi/ata driver.  \nYou can find the detail in the following link raid0: data corruption when using trim .\n", "Q: Can't open file to disable splash screen I'm on Xubuntu 15.04 32 bit if that means anything.

It also makes configuration management a bit easier as I'm considering a cluster of these. \n\nA: The location of vsftpd can be specified as a command-line parameter.

I have Ubuntu installed on my USB (FAT32). Now how do I run it from the USB without deleting C: drive?\n\nA: From Wikipedia\n\nA live USB is a USB flash drive or a USB external hard disk drive containing a full operating system that can be booted. Live USBs are closely related to live CDs, but sometimes have the ability to persistently save settings and permanently install software packages back onto the USB device. Like live CDs, live USBs can be used in embedded systems for system administration, data recovery, or the testing of operating system distributions without committing to a permanent installation on the local hard disk drive.\n\nTypes of live USB devices\n\n*\n\n*USB 2.0 flash drive\n\n*USB 3.0 flash drive\n\n*portable (small enough to fit in your pocket) external SSD\n\n*✔️ external hard drive (SSD is much faster than HDD)\n\nThere are two types of Ubuntu installations on a USB flash drive, a full installation of Ubuntu on a USB flash drive and an Ubuntu live USB which is not a full installation of Ubuntu on a USB flash drive, also known as an Ubuntu live USB. Neither type of Ubuntu installation on a USB device is the equal of a dual boot-ed Ubuntu operating system due to performance and wear limitations inherent in USB flash drive media.\n\nFull Installation of Ubuntu on a USB flash drive\nThe process of doing a full installation of Ubuntu to a USB flash drive is identical to installing Ubuntu on a hard drive except for the installing the GRUB bootloader. All of the steps to follow in the Ubuntu installer are identical except for installing the GRUB bootloader. Installing the GRUB bootloader on the USB flash drive will replace the existing GRUB bootloader on the hard drive which you don't want to do, unless you disconnect the cables to your hard drive(s) first before you start the Ubuntu installer to do a full installation of Ubuntu on a USB flash drive. So disconnect the hard drives first, then you can install Ubuntu on a USB flash drive.\nYou can alternatively do a full installation of Ubuntu on a USB flash drive without disconnecting the internal hard drive cables first by selecting the Something else option in the Installation type screen of the Ubuntu installer. You need to create only a single / partition (root partition), no swap partition, and change the installation of the grub bootloader to the USB flash drive. Double-check your partitioning choices that everything that will be changed is only changed on the USB flash drive, then click the Install Now button in the lower right corner.\nAdditional information about a full installation of Ubuntu on a USB flash drive.\n\n*\n\n*I recommend that the USB flash drive be at least 32GB. This is consistent with the recommended >=25GB disk space for Ubuntu.\n\n*A USB 3.0 flash drive is a lot faster than a USB 2.0 flash drive.\n\n*The advantage of using a USB flash drive lies in its portability, not in its performance. The performance of a full install of Ubuntu on a 32GB USB flash drive is nothing like what you would get from running Ubuntu in a virtual machine application such as VirtualBox.\n\n\nUbuntu live USB\nIs a full installation of Ubuntu on the USB flash drive what you wanted? Some people have suggested that what you wanted to do was to make an Ubuntu live USB which can also contain additional space for persistent file storage if necessary. An Ubuntu live USB session can be run after booting the USB flash drive without effecting any files on the C: drive. To make an Ubuntu live USB follow the instructions in How do I make a bootable Ubuntu USB?. To boot the Ubuntu live USB without automatically booting to Windows instead, follow the instructions in How to change boot priority?.\n\nA: Get Unetbootin (http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net), plug in a USB, open UNBI, and select Ubuntu from the first dropdown. Select what version in the next dropdown (most likely, you'll want 14.04 since it's LTS) and make sure you choose the right architecture. Then click OK and it will automatically make a live USB for you. You can click the Reboot Now button to try it now, or if you want to use it on a different computer/try it later then just press exit.\n", "Q: Minecraft doesn't connect to Mojang servers/the internet (15.04) I've been trying to run Minecraft on Ubuntu 15.04 for a while.

I logged in to Debian 7 via SSH, not as root. When writing sudo all the time became too much overhead, I did sudo su. Since the Debian default shell (dash ?) does not support the Tab key to complete filenames, I ran /bin/bash. I added a few aliases to .bash_aliases and to activate them, I ran /bin/bash again (potentially a few more times) until I got all aliases right.\nAfter doing some more system setup, I could not remember any more how many times I have to type exit to get back to the beginning but not logging out from SSH.\nActually this is not a big deal, since I could log in via SSH again, so this is more an academic question.

I'm here to ask about today's kernel update.\nFew days ago (June 15) I updated Ubuntu's kernel to 3.13.0-55.\nBut strangely, today when I searched for updates, Ubuntu told me to install the same update again. Not just that, but it also didn't asked for the password (something that always happens when installing kernel updates).\nIs this something normal?\nthank you guys for helping me.\n\nA: When you run sudo apt-get update for the first time in a day, it will ask for your password.  The sudo command by default will store your password in memory for up to 15 minutes.  That is why if you run sudo apt-get upgrade shortly after, it will not ask you for a password, until you go and run the commands again later.\nFrom the Ubuntu Security Team FAQ:\n\nUpdate Manager doesn't prompt for security updates\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Why does update-manager no longer prompt for the user's password?\nAs of Ubuntu 11.10, update-manager no longer prompts for the user's\n  password to apply updates. This was decided to improve usability and\n  to make it easier for users to apply security updates and therefore\n  increase system security. The rationale is as follows:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Like in previous releases, by default only people in the admin\n  group are allowed access to perform security updates.\n  \n*Only updates for already installed software can be applied without a password. Installing additional software still requires\n  people to enter their password.\n  \n*The password prompt had become an irritant for some people such that they would just press 'Cancel' instead of installing the\n  updates. The password prompt decreased system security for those\n  users. \n  \n*People that did dutifully apply updates became conditioned to enter\n  their privileged password perhaps daily. When the user is prompted for\n  the password, it should mean something and the frequency of\n  update-manager updates meant that some people no longer thought about\n  why they were entering their password. For these users, the password\n  prompt had the potential to reduce security. \n  \n  \n  For environments where this change is deemed not appropriate, this\n  functionality can be disabled by the administrator via PolicyKit or by\n  creating users that are not in the admin group (a recommended practice\n  to begin with).\n\n", "Q: I installed Ubuntu but then on the restart it still gives me the option to install it Is this normal or is there some thing wrong?

I want to boot Ubuntu from that drive. How would I go about installing it? I used UnetBootin to create a boot able USB from the iso, but how should I proceed? \n\nA: Update 2:\nYou stated you want to install Windows on the second internal disk. You did not include this in your original question. I will now add the following points. \n\n\n*\n\n*A far as I know, you can not create a USB installer for any version of windows that will boot on your Mac. You must either use a DVD or Virtualization software. A DVD would be easiest. Do you know if you can boot from a Windows installation DVD using your external optical drive? If not, then you will need to download and install Virtualization software. I only have experience with VirtualBox. The download is free.\n\n*Installing Windows to your second internal drive requires either temporarily removing your first internal drive or creating a 100 MB partition on the first drive to hold a System Reserved partition.\n\n*You should first get Windows installed before we worry about installing Ubuntu. I have never owned a Mac with two internal drives, so I can advise you but I can not verify every step of the procedure.\nBTW, are you sure your Macbook Pro is a late 2009 model? I ask because your model does not appear on the web page System requirements to install Windows on your Mac using Boot Camp.\n\nUpdate 1:\nI transferred the ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso file to a USB flash drive using the current version of UNetbootin. For the \"Space used to preserve files across reboots (Ubuntu only):\", I used the default of 0 MB. Upon completion a window appeared as follows.\n\nI ignored the message \"The created USB device will not boot off a Mac\". I assume you can also. I rebooted my computer and held down the Option key. The following menu appeared.\n \nI chose the orange icon on the right labeled \"EFI Boot\". In the next menu, I selected \"Check disk for defects\". This took some time to complete. Upon completion, a window appeared with the message \"Check finished: no errors found\".\nIf you get this far, you can try booting to the Live version of Ubuntu. In other words, select \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" from the menu.\n\nI did a similar install a few weeks ago. Before I post a detailed answer, I would like to know how what you want differs from what I did. I already know your second disk is internal. Mine happened to be an USB external hard drive. My computer is a iMac 20-inch Mid 2007 running OS X 10.10.3 and Windows 8.1 on the internal disk. I have rEFInd installed  as an optional boot manager. It resides in its own hfs+ formatted partition on the internal disk. I assume you would want a similar partition on your second disk.\nI agree you should use UnetBootin to create the bootable USB flash drive installer. The recommended method for OS X does not verify, where as,  using UnetBootin does. I used the file ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso which leads to an EFI/GPT install. If you are using a different iso file, let me know. \nI did not install using a LVM. If you want to use a LVM or are uncertain, let me know. Also, my OS X install does not use Core Storage.\nWhen installing Ubuntu, files were added to the EFI partition on my first disk. I moved these files to a small 100 MB hfs+ partition on the second disk. Basically, these files are GRUB. I added some files from rEFInd to make this partition appear when holding down the Option key at startup and on the Startup Disk window in the OS X System Preferences. This means all the partitions used for Ubuntu will reside only on the second disk. The second disk will contain 5 partitions. An unused 210 MB FAT formatted ESP, a 100 MB hfs+ formatted ESP, a 100 MB hfs+ formatted rEFInd partition, ext4 formatted Ubuntu partition and a Linux Swap partition.  \n", "Q: pcsx2 installation Im a noob in over my head, can someone with experience help me (in a sort of step-by-step way would be nice) install pcsx2 in 64 bit ubuntu 15?

I am trying to put a face cam in my videos but can't figure out how. I use Openshot, but if there's another editor that works please tell me.\n\nA: I'm also using Openshot and just happened to stumble across a method that seems to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the file in the track to be the facecam; select Properties:\n\n\n*Navigate to the \"Layout\" tab.\n\n*Leave the Key Frame as \"Start of Clip\" and adjust the Height and Width to your desired size (25% seems pretty standard for facecams):\n\n\n*Now adjust your \"X\" and \"Y\" to position your facecam where you want it on screen. This may take some finagling, and you may want to pop over to the video tab to adjust the Align \"Horizontal:\" and \"Vertical:\" to represent the corner you want the facecam in; i.e. if you want your facecam in the bottom left corner, your \"Horizontal:\" should be \"left\" and your \"Vertical:\" should be \"bottom\":\n\n\n*Hit \"Apply\" and make sure that your facecam looks the way you want it. Once you've got it the way you know you want it to be:\n\n*Go back to your Properties and into the Layout tab. Change your Key Frame to \"End of Clip\" and make sure that all of the parameters match what you put in for the \"Start of Clip\" Key Frame. If you skip this step, the facecam clip will grow/shrink/move/etc. while playing to match the \"End of Clip\" parameters by the time the clip is over:\n\n\n*Watch your new video all the way through to make sure it all looks the way you want it to, which you should really be doing anyway.\nThat's it! I hope that helps you out.

If I log out,then log back i,the cursor reappears. Is there a permanent fix for this. \n\nA: I've had this issue too when running:\n  gterm (locally) -> ssh -> screen (remotely) -> bash\n\nIn some of the screen windows, the cursor worked fine in others it was blank.  I could use SCREEN_COMMAND+ESC+7 to get the cursor to blink but then it would stop when I typed in the window.  I ended up exiting that bash session and restarting it.  Most likely a screen issue.\n", "Q: Using wget with Streamcloud and pages where you have to wait I'm new to bash scripting and as I heard of \"wget\" I decided to write a script to download just the .mp4 file from a streamcloud (or whatever) link.\nI use it normally like:\nwget -q -O - http://somelink.com | grep keyword\n\nBut the problem that I'm having is that I'm getting the source from the site where I have to wait a few seconds until I \"go to the video\", and that's obviously not where I can find the mp4 file link. So I'd like to know how could I get the source of the page you get to after the waiting, where you can actually watch the video and whose source contains the mp4 link (then I'd be able to grep it).\nI can actually get the mp4 link manually, but I would just like to automate it through a shell script.\nThanks a lot! Any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: You need to save the wget output into a file and look at the html to see how they are implementing the timeout and redirect. There are several techniques that might be being used. For example, the simplest is a line like this in the head of the html:\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"2;url=http://newurl/\"> \n\nThis makes a browser go to the new url after 2 seconds. You need to use a tool like sed to extract the url and then run wget again on the new url.\nMore complicated solutions involve javascript.\n", "Q: Is there a way to get \"Bettter\" Skype? I am new to linux and I am a previous windows user. I dont like the Skype 4.x layout/look. Is there a way I can use a newer version of Skype without using a VM?  \nI have already tried using VM's. They work flawlessly, but are too resource intensive just to run skype.\n\nA: If it helps, Try installing Skype Windows application on your system using Wine\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nAfter Wine is installed, you can install  Skype on it. \n\nA: Doing this from my phone but you could try hangouts.  It works as a chrome app on your desktop and works exactly like Skype.  I also heard Skype is coming in the form of a web app soon.  I'll post the links when I get back to my desktop.\n", "Q: apt-get exits bash script after installing packages I have read the answers in this post but it doesn't seem to work for my problem.\nI am executing a bash script via stdin from wget:\nwget -O - http://serverip/subfolder/script | sudo bash\n\nI've tried using apt-get -y --force-yes install <packages..> || true, but it still exits the script if the one of the listed is installed by apt-get.\nIt doesn't exit the script if all the listed packages are already installed.\nThe same thing happens if I have a apt-get upgrade and it installs package(s).  It will exit the script.\nI have another set of scripts, that seems to work.  In that scenario, the install script is just a stub, that downloads, runs the script via bash <scriptname> then deletes the script.  The script itself will elevate its privilege by sudoing itself.  apt-get works as expected here.\nAny insight as to how to prevent apt-get from terminating the script would be appreciated.\n\nA: I wish people would stop doing: wget | bash. It's just silly, and has unintended effects like the one here. You have bash, so make use of its features. In particular, process substitution:\nbash <(wget -O - http://serverip/subfolder/script)\n\n\nA: You probably just need to stop apt-get from greedily reading the standard input. Do this by redirecting stdin to /dev/null, a file that returns eof to reads. Eg:\napt-get -y --force-yes install ... </dev/null\n\n", "Q: How to add app links to the right click menu I am running Ubuntu 14.04.\nWhen I right click the desktop and select \"New Document\" the only option is \"Empty Document\".

See the file $HOME/.config/user-dirs.dirs, there should be a line like\nXDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=\"$HOME/Vorlagen\"\n\ntelling you the folder name.

What do I have to add in the command to change its position on the list.\nmy command: sudo iptables -s 10.1.10.201 -j DROP\n\nA: To place a rule at a specific spot in the rule set for a specific chain, give it a rule number. Meaning, instead of:\nsudo iptables -s 10.1.10.201 -j DROP\n\nwhich is missing both a chain (or table) designation and a rule number, do this:\nsudo iptables I INPUT 1 -s 10.1.10.201 -j DROP\n\nI just used INPUT as an example, you do whatever it is you are trying to do. However, I specified to insert the rule as the first rule.\nPlease read the man pages for iptables. For example this is an extract:\n -I, --insert chain [rulenum] rule-specification\n              Insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule number.  So, if the rule number is 1, the rule or rules are inserted at the head of the chain.

Ubuntu time in other locations is not working.\nIt used to work in Ubuntu 14.10 but am unable to add time for other locations in 15.04.\nPlease help.\n\nA: You can use tzselect command, it will prompt you about zones to choose to show the time in it. \n   tzselect  is  called  without any parameters from the shell. It shows a\n   list of about one dozen geographic areas one can roughly  recognize  as\n   continents.

If you want to use a graphical interface, why don't you use a desktop image instead. There even is one that features the GNOME Shell as its default desktop: Ubuntu GNOME.\nA full list of official flavors can be found here, but virtually any desktop out there, from minimalist tiling window managers like i3wm to full-featured and hardware-demanding desktops like GNOME Shell or Unity, can be installed on Ubuntu.\nThe major (and after installation only) difference between the server and desktop is in fact the default lack of a graphical desktop in a server installation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq.\nOne difference during installation is that the desktop image brings a graphical installation utility called Ubiquity, and I think language/localisation installation is much easier.\nSo make your life easier and use a desktop image, if possible. You can still run software servers on the machine, independently whether you chose a server or desktop image for installation.\n\nA: Thanks for your answer. I'm a Windows user. Some months ago I installed in a costumer company, owncloud. But now, there is no more support for windows environment.

Could it be a DNS or server problem? Im hosting it in ubuntu 12.04. I really need help!! Thanks in advance!\n\nA: A \"connection reset\" error is a problem between the client and the webserver - it's the webserver sending the \"connection reset\", which means all of the DNS lookups have already occurred (successfully) before you even get to this stage.\nIf it was a DNS problem, you would be getting a \"Server not found error\", not connection reset. So whatever it is, it's on the server.\nIf there is nothing in the webserver config regarding these IPs, could there be some kind of iptables rule for the IPs the affected ISP is using?

And this since your domain only contains Ubuntu, if some Windows you need samba.\n\nThe Print Server is the Ubuntu computer that is directly connected to the printers.\nOn the server machine (the one the printer is attached to), open System -> Administration -> Printing (If the menu item does not exist you need to add system-config-printer to the menu). . This will open the Printer Configuration window.\n\nSelect Server in the menu bar, and then Settings. This will open the Basic Server Settings window.\nCheck the second box:\nPublish shared printers connected to this server If this computer acts as both a Print Server and a client (it does need access to a printer connected to another computer), select also the first box, \"Show printers shared by other systems\".\n\nOK\nRight click the printer and check the Shared option, if not checked yet\nCheck that users that you want to be able to use the printer are not excluded or allow printing for all others. See Properties>Access Control.

Yesterday I was trying to recover some lost files from an external drive using r-linux. I think this filled my laptop's hard drive and my computer suddenly crashed and went into low graphics mode which doesn't let me log in at all.\nI searched on here about low graphics mode and confirmed that full disk is one of the reasons.\nFollowing the advice I managed to get to a VT and run the commands\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nsudo reboot\n\nBut they didn't help. Then I managed to do the command\ndf -h\n\nand this showed me a table, which shows I have no space.\nThat's where I am stuck, I can't out figure how to delete things. I tried the command\nsudo du -kxa / | sort -nr | head\n\nbut it doesn't work.\nHow can I find the contents I want to delete and then how to actually select the big/not important ones and delete them through the commands?\ndf -h returns:\nfilesystem  size  used  avail  use%  Mounted on\ndev/sda1    455gb 449g  0      100%  /\nudev        2,0G  4,0K  2,0G   1%    /dev\ntmpfs       806M   820K 805M   1%   /run\nnone        5,0M     0  5,0M   0%   /run/lock\nnone        2,0G     0  2,0G   0%   /run/shm\nnone        100M  8,0K  100M   1%   /run/user\noverflow    1,0M  4,0K  1020K  1%   /tmp\n\n\nA: You need to delete some files. The best place to search is in your home directory. Most likely in your ~/Videos folder. So, from the command line (Ctrl Alt F1) first run this:\ncd ~/Videos\n\nThen, look at what you have there. This command will show you the files ordered by size:\nls -lSr\n\nNow, remove some of the bigger files:\nrm \"video file name.avi\"\n\nOnce you have removed enough files, restart your computer and you can continue the cleanup using the GUI. \n", "Q: Remastersys and Hostname An unsuccessful installation attempt of Remastersys installation changed my ubuntu 12.04 precise desktop hostname.\nAm unable to revert to my original hostname of my desktop.

I have a RAID drive mounted on /mnt/raiddrives, and I want to share it on my network giving everyone full access to it. The Ubuntu guide says to do something like below in the smb.conf file:\n[share]\n    comment = Ubuntu File Server Share\n    path = /srv/samba/share\n    browsable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n    read only = no\n    create mask = 0755\n\nHowever, assuming the permissions are being set with the create mask value, the 0755 means nothing to me. Searching on the web just brings up hundreds of people using different numbers with no clear explanation of what the numbers mean. So can someone tell me what the numbers mean and how I can figure out what number I want to use please?\n\nA: This has nothing to do with Samba. This is related to file permissions.\nThere are three types of access restrictions:\nPermission    Action      chmod option\n======================================\nread          (view)      r or 4\nwrite         (edit)      w or 2\nexecute       (execute)   x or 1\n\nThere are also three types of user restrictions:\nUser    ls output\n==================\nowner   -rwx------\ngroup   ----rwx---\nother   -------rwx\n\nFolder/Directory Permissions\nPermission    Action                               chmod option\n===============================================================\nread          (view contents: i.e., ls command)      r or 4\nwrite         (create or remove files from dir)      w or 2\nexecute       (cd into directory)                    x or 1\n\nNumeric notation\nAnother method for representing Linux permissions is an octal notation as shown by stat -c %a. This notation consists of at least three digits. Each of the three rightmost digits represents a different component of the permissions: owner, group, and others.\nEach of these digits is the sum of its component bits in the binary numeral system:\nSymbolic Notation    Octal Notation    English\n============================================================\n----------            0000               no permissions\n---x--x--x            0111               execute\n--w--w--w-            0222               write\n--wx-wx-wx            0333               write & execute\n-r--r--r--            0444               read\n-r-xr-xr-x            0555               read & execute\n-rw-rw-rw-            0666               read & write\n-rwxrwxrwx            0777               read. write & execute\n\nNow, what does 755 mean?\n7=rwx 5=r-x 5=r-x\nThis means that the directory has the default permissions -rwxr-xr-x (represented in octal notation as 0755).\nPlease read more about file permissions: \n\n\n*\n\n*File Permissions\n\n*Unix/Linux Permissions\n\n*The file mask in Linux\n\nA: Please, forget about Samba and look at some simple thing here...I assume you don't need any technical language. Right?...well.\nThere are categories of users in your computer\n\n\n*\n\n*owner\n\n*group\n\n*other users\n\n\nNow here is the \"mathematics\" about giving rights to your directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*The common order is normally XXXX where the first\"x\" is ignored.\nThe second \"x\" is the owner, the third \"x\" is the group and\nthe fourth is the others.\n\n\nHere is the algorithm of giving permissions (ignoring the 0 on the left.)\n\n000 no permissions\n111 execute\n222 write\n333 write & execute\n444 read\n555 read & execute\n666 read & write\n777 read write & execute\n\nNow here we go\n\n7 is category \"owner\"\n5 is category \"group\"\n5 (last one) is category \"others\"\n\nNow, with  755 it means the owner which is root will read, write and execute in the directory. The group and others will only read and execute in the directory.\nPlay around with the algorithm.\nYou can also read this\nhttp://cs.brown.edu/cgc/net.secbook/se01/handouts/Ch03-FilesystemSecurity.pdf.\n", "Q: How to allow lamp and apache2 service run parallel? I have a php project in var/www/html. It runs when I start apache2 service is started. But I cannot access phpmyadmin where I have a database that is being used in my php project. (I had to stop lampp for starting apache2 service.) I get this error while accessing phpmyadmin when apache2 service is on. (Php project runs fine without any error.)\n\nOn the other hand, when I need to edit something in database, I use phpmyadmin for which I start lampp(sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start). For doing this I need to stop apache2 service. And during this time, I cannot run php project. It gives this error.\n\nCan I do something like letting them work parallel? Or is there any other way?\n\nA: you do not have to run the apache2 service manually. LAMP is all you need as we all know LAMP = Linux, Apache, Mysql and Php\n\nA: You could be running two different instances of Apache.  One serving files from var/www/html and the XAMPP/LAMPP instance serving from opt/lampp/htdocs/  (That's the default LAMPP directory)\nIf you have that directory you could copy your project to it.

Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nPackage systemd is not available, but is referred to by another package.\nThis may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or\nis only available from another source\nHowever the following packages replace it:\n  systemd-services systemd-services:i386\n\nE: Package 'systemd' has no installation candidate\n\nSo i installed systemd-services. Now the systemctl start razerd command results in:\nwico@wico-System-Product-Name ~/razer/build $ systemctl start razerd\nsystemctl: command not found\n\nThe readme mentions that i can enter the following commands without using systemd and possibly get it done that way:\ncp ./razerd.initscript /etc/init.d/razerd\nln -s /etc/init.d/razerd /etc/rc2.d/S99razerd\nln -s /etc/init.d/razerd /etc/rc5.d/S99razerd\nln -s /etc/init.d/razerd /etc/rc0.d/K01razerd\nln -s /etc/init.d/razerd /etc/rc6.d/K01razerd\n\nBut doing this just ends up with another error message:\nwico@wico-System-Product-Name ~/razer/build $ cp ./razerd.initscript /etc/init.d/razerd\ncp: cannot stat ‘./razerd.initscript’: No such file or directory\n\nThen there's what could possibly be a third solution in the README file. But it might just be some info instead. It says:\nIf you use udev:\n\nThe `make install` step installed the udev script to\n  $(pkg-config --variable=udevdir udev)/rules.d/80-razer.rules\nThis should work on most distributions.\n\nI'm guessing I could just skip this step but i'll include this for clarity.\nThis all probably has something to do with me trying it in the wrong folder but the razercfg README file just isn't clear about that and I'm a beginner when it comes to linux.\nPrevious question regarding the same program installation:\ncheckinstall / make does not work for the program razercfg that I wish to install\nWhen i tried the proposed solution instead of the init-scripts, it seems to have gone right even though there's messages saying things don't match or exist:\nwico@wico-System-Product-Name ~/razer $ sudo cp ./razerd.initscript /etc/init.d/razerd\nwico@wico-System-Product-Name ~/razer $ sudo update-rc.d razerd enable\nupdate-rc.d: warning:  start runlevel arguments (none) do not match razerd Default-Start values (2 3 4 5)\nupdate-rc.d: warning:  stop runlevel arguments (none) do not match razerd Default-Stop values (0 1 6)\n System start/stop links for /etc/init.d/razerd do not exist.\nwico@wico-System-Product-Name ~/razer $ sudo service razerd start\n * Starting Razer device state daemon: razerd                            [ OK ]\nwico@wico-System-Product-Name ~/razer $ sudo update-rc.d razerd defaults\nAdding system startup for /etc/init.d/razerd ...\n   /etc/rc0.d/K20razerd -> ../init.d/razerd\n   /etc/rc1.d/K20razerd -> ../init.d/razerd\n   /etc/rc6.d/K20razerd -> ../init.d/razerd\n   /etc/rc2.d/S20razerd -> ../init.d/razerd\n   /etc/rc3.d/S20razerd -> ../init.d/razerd\n   /etc/rc4.d/S20razerd -> ../init.d/razerd\n   /etc/rc5.d/S20razerd -> ../init.d/razerd\n\nAfter that I browsed to the razer/ui folder and double-clicked the python file called 'qrazercfg' and I'm now able to alter my Razer mouse settings in the graphical user interface mode.\n\nA: On Ubuntu, systemd is used on Ubuntu 15.04 and newer. Since you're using Ubuntu 14.04, you need to use init-scripts and the service command (for example, sudo service razerd start). You also didn't need to install the systemd-services package.\nThe commands copying the init file to /etc/init and linking the file (the instructions should really be using sudo update-rc.d razerd defaults), followed by sudo service razerd start, should work for you. Note that this is mainly so that the program gets started automatically at startup.\nThe udev rules is likely for access to some hardware on your system.\n", "Q: How to detect current gnome-terminal character encoding? I am trying to detect the current gnome-terminal character encoding from the command line. I have tried using gconftool :\n$ gconftool-2 --get /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/encoding\ncurrent\n$ gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/encoding\nen_US.UTF-8\n$ gconftool-2 --get /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/encoding\nen_US.UTF-8\n\nBut if I now go to the gnome-terminal menu and choose Terminal->Set Character Encoding->ISO-8859-10 and then run again\n$ gconftool-2 --get /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/encoding\nen_US.UTF-8\n\nso the encoding in /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/encoding has not changed to ISO-8859-10 even though the terminal is using that encoding. So it seems gconftool cannot be used to determine the current encoding.\n\nA: I recommend checking locale charmap's output (which reports the values set by $LANG, $LC_CTYPE, $LC_ALL). This one does not directly query the terminal, but it's essential for most of the applications that the locale is set up correctly, consistently with the terminal. If it reports anything else than the actual behavior, not only your app but pretty much every other app will misbehave in the terminal, and it's not your fault. Of course the user can change the encoding from the menu, but if they decide to shoot themselves in the foot, there's not much you can/should do against. It's not your task to detect a faulty system-wide setting. Also there's no way for you to notice if the user switches encoding while your app is running, so I don't think there's much point in verifying it at startup.\nIf you really really need to check the runtime behavior, you can emit escape sequences that query the cursor position (and report it back in a certain format as if it's been typed from the keyboard), then emit some bytes that e.g. form a single character in UTF-8 while multiple characters in any other encoding (disabling local echo in the mean time, so keypresses by the user don't advance the cursor), and query the cursor position again. It's perhaps too much trouble and really not worth the effort.\n\nA: Here is a half-solution, addressing the problem of determining the encoding when  /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/encoding is equal to the string current. Assuming that the string current means that gnome-terminal should use the current locale. \nIt is tempting to check the LANG variable to determine the encoding, but according to this question, that is not reliable.

Now I have \"NVIDIA binary driver - version 331.113\" and nvidia-settings installed. But when I try to configure the displays (either with the display settings in Ubuntu or with the installed \"NVIDIA X Server Settings\") the desktop will be distorted and moves around when the cursor gets to one edge.\nDoes anybody have a solution to solve the problem?

Windows is for gaming and Ubuntu for working. I'll install 8.1 first and leave 10GB on the SSD for /. On the HDD I'll leave 120GB for /home and the equivalent of my RAM for swap. The rest of the space on the HDD is gonna be NTFS and shared by Windows and Ubuntu.\nI'll turn off fast boot in Windows.\nWhat else do I need to take care of when in the \"something else\" menu during install? Can I leave the bootloader with its default setting? Can I leave secure boot enabled?\n\nA: If you install in EFI mode, you must ensure that you have an EFI System Partition (ESP). Windows should create this IF you install it in EFI mode before you install Ubuntu. That's not guaranteed, though; depending on your firmware settings, getting the right boot mode can be a gamble. I recommend leaving BIOS/CSM/legacy support turned off in the firmware to help simplify the boot path and ensure both your installers boot in EFI/UEFI mode. The details of how to do this, and even precisely what similar-sounding options do, vary greatly from one system to another, though. For more on this subject, see my Web page on CSMs.\nAlso, I personally would create an ESP, and perhaps other partitions, ahead of time before installing Windows. Windows creates a smallish (100MiB, IIRC) ESP by default. This is usually fine, but the ESP should be FAT32, and a few EFIs have problems with such small FAT32 partitions -- files can become mysteriously \"invisible,\" which makes boot loaders malfunction. I recommend an ESP of 550MiB, which is big enough to avoid these problems. Note that the ESP doesn't really need to be on the SSD; the files it holds are small, and they're accessed just at boot time or when upgrading them, so the performance gain from putting the ESP on an SSD will be tiny.\nAside from the ESP and the fact that EFI-based computers generally boot from GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks, Linux partitioning needs don't vary from BIOS-mode to EFI-mode installations. You plan sounds basically reasonable, although I'd give a little more than 10GiB to root (/). Although a bare-bones Ubuntu installation takes only about 6GiB, IIRC, there are any number of reasons why it might grow above that. I'd say 20-30GiB is reasonable, assuming you can spare the disk space. (I know it's an SSD, so space may be a bit tight there.)\n", "Q: Webalizer shows only 2 months on summary page (Ubuntu 14.04) Webalizer used to show 12 Months on start page's summary, in a graphical overview as well in a link list to each of this month and the 11 months before. This worked out of the box at least in Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04, I only had to configure incremental mode to deal with my daily (not monthly) log files.\nAfter moving two websites to 14.04, I found webalizer messing with the summary, in a way that it showed only two months in the grapical overview, 10 slots for the other months were empty. The link list shows the same two months only (this month and last month). If I omit log data of May and June, I get March and April - again two months only.\nI tried to omit incremental mode (using default config file) and handed webalizer a single log file containing 30 months of logs. This resulted in webalizer creating a summary graphic and link list of 11 times May and 1 time June.\nImportant to notice: monthly statistics look correct, even those of three or more months ago, I just have to type the URL by hand of any statistics entry more than 2 months ago.\nI searched the web with any combinations of \"webalizer\", \"two months\", \"only\", etc. and found only one question like this - but without any answer.\nAny ideas folks, what's wrong or what I might be doing wrong?\nOk, of course you want to see more exactly what I've tried, so I'll include command line examples of what I tried:\n$ logdir=/path-to-logdir\n$ ls $logdir\n...\n2015.0617-access.log.gz\n2015.0618-access.log.gz\n2015.0619-access.log.gz\n$ outputdir=/path-to-webroot/statistics\n$ rm $outputdir/*\n$ for logfile in $logdir/*-access.log.gz;  do webalizer -r http://$hostname -n $hostname -o $outputdir $logfile;  done\n... lots of verbose output about webalizer's activity\n... last of it being:\nWebalizer V2.23-08 (Linux 3.13.0-55-generic x86_64) locale: htm*\nUsing logfile /path-to-logdir/2015.0619-access.log.gz (gzip-clf)\nCreating output in /path-to-webroot/statistics\nHostname for reports is 'myhostname'\nReading history file... webalizer.hist\nReading previous run data.. webalizer.current\nSaving current run data...

Well, this is what I've done:\n\n\n*\n\n*I copied the log files to a notebook with fresh install of 14.04 - same results\n\n*I dropped log files created by 14.04's apache - same result\n\n*I grabbed webalizer's source and compiled it on two different 14.04 machines - this one workes, finally.\n\n\nDoes that mean Ubuntu-14.04's webalizer package is broken? For longer than one year now? Hard to believe.\nIf nobody can explain what's gone wrong, at least for those of you looking for webalizer summary problems - you've found it's not yours alone.\nI'll be happy to hear about others who have similar webalizer problems - and even more happy of course, if someone can point me to a solution which doesn't require compiling webalizer sources.\nThank you!\nTomTomTom\n\nA: Well, I've got the same problem, Fedora box though.

In a Debian system, any package can be built from source by issuing the  dpkg-buildpackage command.\nIn snappy Ubuntu, there does not seem to be anything comparable to either dpkg-buildpackage or apt-get source.

All of them are published for Ubuntu Core in the cloud repository. If you want to try them on Ubuntu Core without building them yourself, you can use snappy search and install them directly.\nLet's walk through a build from source of \"hello-world\":\n cd snappy-examples/hello-world\n\nTake a moment to inspect the contents of this directory. The key is the snappy packaging meta information that you will find in the meta/ directory and the package.yaml file. This information is all it takes to package your snappy application and share it with snappy users. The contents of meta/package.yaml are documented in the packaging guide.\nNow that you are familiar with the internals of how a snappy package source tree looks like, let's create the hello-world .snap package. For that simply run:\n snappy build .\n\nThis will produce a snappy package in your current working directory, which you can install on your snappy system using the snappy-remote command:\n snappy-remote --url=ssh://localhost:8022 install ./hello-world_1.0.5_all.snap\n\nOf course, you need to provide the address of the running snappy virtual machine, the example above is correct if you are using KVM locally, if you are on the cloud then it will be a different hostname and is unlikely to require a custom port. Log in to your snappy and run the hello-world.hello command to see it yourself:\nhello-world.echo\nHello World\n\nAll this is from the official documentation.\n", "Q: Why is bash the default shell in most OS? Why is bash the default shell in most OSes (Ubuntu, Fedora, OSX, etc.)? Why is it that a lot of advanced users mostly use zsh? If it is that good, why is it not the default?\nI use both I don't see a difference for all my tasks are simple :)\n\nA: I did some reading on this and the conclusion seems to be that it is the default shell of GNU (used by most Linux based OS), and therefore simply comes packaged as part of GNU, while also having 20 years of development behind it making it stable and well rounded, it is simply the best all rounder, meeting the needs of all but the most advanced users.\nFor more, read Why is bash standard on Linux? (the same question on Unix & Linux).\nJust to add a bit more to this, there are many other shells to try, if you are interested, here's a few from this answer:    \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Zsh has more advanced\n  interactive facilities, but a few quirks when it comes to scripting\n  (less so now than back in the days). In the early to mid-1990s when\n  Linux was in its infancy, zsh was virtually unknown.\n  \n*Ksh was the de facto\n  standard on commercial unices since the mid-1980s, but it was\n  proprietary software until 2000, so not an option on Linux. Also, ksh\n  had subpar command line editing capabilities, compared with bash.\n  \n*Pdksh, a free clone of ksh,\n  would have been an option, but it was not well-known and had poor\n  command line edition capabilities. (Pdksh is no longer a very active\n  project, even though it's still used in some BSDs, now that ATT ksh is\n  free.)\n  \n*Some distributions install an\n  ash variant as\n  /bin/sh. Ash (by which I mean any of the loose family of shells\n  called ash) is designed to be small and fast, with no interactive\n  features (it's only for editing scripts). The ash revival is\n  relatively recent; in the 1990s the existing variants lacked a lot of\n  features.\n  \n*Tcsh was the most advanced\n  interactive shell until zsh came along, but it's incompatible with sh\n  and not so good with\n  scripting.\n\n\nA: The Bourne Shell (sh back in the day) of the AT&T branch of Unix was improved upon and superceded by the Korn Shell, ksh. ksh also came out of AT&T Bell Labs and was not GPL (current version is Eclipse Public License).  The C-shell, csh came out of the Berkeley version of Unix and was also not GPL (BSD license) and also used different syntax than sh. The Z-shell, zsh is an improvement on sh but not GPL (MIT-like license). Bash was an improvement on sh, used the GPL and from GNU. Just on license alone Bash would have probably been the choice for a GPL operating system.  Particularly with a shell being a core part of a distro.\nBut Bash was also a GNU project, giving it, I think, more active development and making contributions easier than a legacy product out of Berkeley Unix or AT&T Unix. A very good case could be made that zsh is and has been a better shell than Bash, but not enough so to overcome it's different license and non-GNU project status.\nBack when Linux distros were first appearing and choosing their default shell (early to mid-90s), there was no github (2008) or even a SourceForge (1999). At that point, I think GNU projects had a real advantage over non-GNU projects in getting noticed and drawing and including new developers. So distros could look at Z-shell as better, but also expect that Bash would be getting good support and maintenance going forward, and also have more features added to it, allowing it to catch up to zsh.\nNow that Bash has had years of default status, it's become a defacto standard, with books written about it. There is one book that covers both Bash and Z-shell, but no book that covers zsh exclusively, while there are multiple that do so for Bash.\nAnd at this point, if distros were to change the default for upgrades of an existing system, it would break setups as some of  initialization files have different names (e.g. .bashrc versus .zshrc) and the content of the files may have incompatible syntax. So they would be very reluctant to do that, leaving new downloads to have zsh as the default and upgrades to have bash. Two different defaults for the same distro is something they probably don't want to have to support and users/companies also don't want to deal with as well.\n\nA: The Unix shell languages are all ugly. Some particularly (csh), some maybe a bit less (ksh? I don't know actually), but really when it comes to aspects like readability and rigidness for big projects, none of them can get close to well-designed general purpose languages such as Python, C# or Haskell. So, when you want something solid, you will never choose any of the shell flavours at all.\nYou do choose them when you want to quickly get simple stuff done. For this, you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Concise syntax, and enough consistency so you can actually memorise it (it's hard to look up shorthand operators). It matters a lot if your shell is installed everywhere, because you really rather wouldn't memorise more than one of these kludge monsters.\n\n*Good interactive features, so you can hack right into the terminal and get stuff working without having to switch between multiple script files. \n\n*The ability to grab any script snippet from anywhere and have it just work. sh compatibility is a big plus here, and once again the more popular the better.\n\n\nSo you see, popularity is rather a bigger point in these shell languages than it is for general-purpose languages. Hence even if ksh is a bit “better” as a language in itself, there is not really so much advatage in using it  if bash is just a bit more popular (which it was, in the relevant sector, since it was first chosen as the default for GNU).\nThe people who do make the switch are deliberate about it and experienced enough to easily handle switching to their favourite shell. OTOH, a rookie who's forced to work with a less popular shell will be quickly confused if they ask the internet for something and it doesn't work. Hence, any distro that's not only aimed at Unix veterans takes quite some risk if it makes anything but bash the standard, a step from which relatively few people would benefit (and only a little).\n\nA: *\n\n*It was there when it was needed\n\n*It has enough eye candy that beginning users can spend a week customizing their prompt.\n\n*The common use cases it is good enough (the most common being start a single command)\n\n*Where it is not good enough perl, python and lua can take up the slack.\n\n*perl makes a terrible interactive shell\n\n*although fish, ksh or zsh may theoretically be a better shell there is not enough of an improvement for me to bother when perl works so well or portability is an issue so I'm targeting dash anyway.\n\n\nA: \"Critical Mass\" is the main answer, IMO. Bash is not just for command line work, it's for scripting and there's a huge, huge number of Bash scripts out there. No matter how much better an alternative is now for interaction, the need to be able to just \"plug and play\" those scripts outweighs such advantages. As such, the only shell that can realistically unseat Bash now is one that is completely backwards compatible and the most likely candidate for that is...the next version of Bash.\n", "Q: I moved my home folder I was trying to move my home folder to another account so hopefully my programs would have run faster on a new user.

I recently did a clear on my terminal and found that the following characters were printed on a the line above:\n[unknown character]3;J\n\nI did a clear | hexdump to look into this and found that the following characters were printed:\nESC [ 3 ; J ESC [ H ESC [ 2 J\n\nI tried typing these keys into my terminal, and I noticed that while the screen didn't clear, only the first J showed up. Is this a bug in the terminal?\n\nA: They are what is known as an \"ESCape sequence\", and are the character sequence used to tell the glass keypunch that your terminal session is emulating (according to your $TERM environment variable) to \"clear screen\". \nESC [ 3 ; J ESC [ H ESC [ 2 J is picked depending on the value of your TERM environment variable. (echo $TERM). If $TERM doesn't match the kind of terminal you're using, clear will pick the wrong string.  \nWhat is your $TERM?

I want to do some advanced key mapping on my Sony VAIO. It involves the Fn key. This is what I want to do:\nI want to do a Fn key inversion, ie to remap: [Fn+ F2toF7] on my keyboard to [F2 to F7] soft keys respectively. After the remap, I want other key combinations involving the function keys to work as usual (like Alt+F4), if possible.\nThis will come in handy because I never use function keys other than in a key combination. Also I use the volume and brightness controls a lot (Fn+ F2toF7).\nI've googled around and found this on another ask-ubuntu question:\n\nThe Fn key usually doesn't send a key code; it's handled by the BIOS,\n  not by the OS. You can sometimes get at it as an ACPI event.\n\nAt this point I have checked the BIOS, and I can't change it from there. \nI found that when I press these combinations, it triggers ACPI events. Here is the output when I sequentially press  Fn+ F2toF7:\nFn + F1 (Toggle TouchPad, not working) press down:\nbutton/fnf1 FNF1 00000080 00000000 K\nsony/hotkey SNY5001:00 00000001 0000000c\n\nFn + F1 release:\nsony/hotkey SNY5001:00 00000001 0000003b\n\nFn + F2 press down:\nbutton/mute MUTE 00000080 00000000 K\n\nFn + F3 press down:\nbutton/volumedown VOLDN 00000080 00000000 K\n\nFn + F4 press down:\nbutton/volumeup VOLUP 00000080 00000000 K\n\nFn + F5 press down:\nvideo/brightnessdown BRTDN 00000087 00000000\n\nFn + F6 press down:\nvideo/brightnessup BRTUP 00000086 00000000\n\nFn + F7 release:\nvideo/switchmode VMOD 00000080 00000000 K\nsony/hotkey SNY5001:00 00000001 00000012\n\nFn + F7 release:\nsony/hotkey SNY5001:00 00000001 0000003b\n\nI've observed that ACPI events are triggered only when the special key combinations are pressed, ie no event is generated if I press Fn+A. So I can't assign short cuts like Fn+A, but can't I somehow manipulate the key combinations for which ACPI events are triggered?  \nEdit: I found keyboard mapping of scan codes to key codes in /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb. It's relevant sections are posted here. But the udev configuration is overridden by something else, because I swapped the vol up and mute keys, and the change was not reflected even after a reboot.\nEdit 2: Output of X event of each key [Fn+ F2toF7] using xev -event keyboard.\n\nA: Your question is a little confusing. I am assuming that you want to change Fn + F# to register as F# for all function keys F1 through F12.\nYour information on this is correct. This cannot be done through the OS. It has to be done through BIOS. Go through all the options in BIOS once again, I am pretty sure you will be able to find it. If not, then google how to do this from BIOS and add your BIOS version to the search.\n", "Q: How to control cursor in xfce4 LXTerminal?

They use directx in windows.\nNow you can check and see if you currently support OpenGL 3.2 with this command:\nglxinfo | grep \"OpenGL core\" \n\nIf you are supporting a lower value than OpenGL 3.2, you'll bomb out with the above error message.

When I have first set up Ubuntu 15.04 (which is first to switch to systemd AFAIK) I was puzzled by why does it only boot some times and then become unbootable (failing to the systemd shell instead of proceeding to start X). I have chosen upstart boot from the grub menu and then came to the conclusion it fails to mount my Windows C: drive (which I have assigned a static mount point) and this is the reason. But the question is not why does it fail to mount it but why does it fail to boot then (given there are no files needed during the boot process on that drive) and how to overcome this.\nI have also configured it to mount my USB hard drive to a static mount point as I want it to be found in a particular place and I hate it to appear on the Unity panel, needless to say this makes my system unbootable (unless I use upstart again) when I take my laptop somewhere without taking the USB drive with me.\nHow can this be fixed?\n\nA: As muru mentioned, add nofail. But also add a low timeout with something like x-systemd.device-timeout=2, because the default timeout seems to be 90 seconds.\nExample from my fstab:\nLABEL=\"test\"  /mnt/test  ext4  defaults,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=4  0  2\n\n", "Q: how to add space to ubuntu from an empty partition \nI want to add the space to Ubuntu from the unallocated partitions.\ncould you please guide me in this process.\nthanks.\n\nA: Try this:\nBoot with a live DVD/USB.\nOpen a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nRun it:\n$ sudo -i\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get install --reinstall gparted\n# umount /dev/sda7\n# umount /dev/sda6\n# umount /dev/sda5\n# umount /dev/sda3\n# gparted\n\nNow from gparted, you can add the unallocated space to the extended partition /dev/sda3.\nLater, you can increase the size of /dev/sda5 with free space below according to your needs.\nYou can increase /dev/sda6 eliminating /dev/sda7 and recreating the rear end of the free space and increase /dev/sda6 in the amount you need.\nIn all cases, you must then find the UUID partition and change them in the /etc/fstab file of /dev/sda5:\n# blkid\n# mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\n# nano /mnt/etc/fstab\n\nFile example:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

I've been to many Help pages and tried various things, including: trying to install Chrome and failing (\"Failed to satisfy all dependencies [broken cache]); updating Wine; installing and updating Pipelight through Terminal.\nI am currently operating on Ubuntu 12.4 LTS. Should I just update to the newest version of Ubuntu?\nThank you!\n\nA: First off, I recommend updating to at least 14.04 LTS, as there's no reason to install an old LTS while there's a better one.\nNetflix on Linux is only supported in Chrome, not Chromium, not any other browser claiming to be Chrome either.\nYou should download the Ubuntu version of Chrome directly from it's website: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html. Once installed, everything should work out of the box.\nIf you get any missing dependency problems while installing Chrome, attempt to install each package by sudo apt-get install <package>, if it can't locate the package, it may be that a required library is only available on a newer version of Ubuntu.\nIn such a case, I know for a fact that Netflix works on 14.04 LTS, 14.10, and 15.04 using Chrome 43.\nIf you get the [broken chache] issue when installing the package, you should issue a few commands to clean up your install environment:  \nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -f\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThat should purge all caches, install missing dependencies, then upgrade old packages in that order.\n\nA: Yes upgrade to 14.04 LTS first then install the official Chrome browser for Ubuntu from here:\nhttps://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html\nAfter that Netflix should work like a charm\n(Netflix access, without hacking, has been available to ubuntu users since late last year.)\nhttps://insights.ubuntu.com/2014/10/10/watch-netflix-in-ubuntu-today/\n", "Q: How to schedule backups more frequently Is there any way to schedule backups more than once a day?  Like, once an hour?\n-edit: using the compression method/program used by the automated backups in System Setting - Backups\n\nA: Every Hour? Little paranoid much? :P But yes.\nThis provides a good resource if you want to backup files to external locations via the network or to external drives. If you meant backups of the entire disk I think hourly is probably a little much but you could probably do something similar with cron.\nTo improve the answer for posterity in case the link goes down:\n\"Cron can be used on Linux to automate the execution of commands, such as rsync. Using Cron, we can have our Linux system run nightly backups, or however often you would like them to run.\nTo edit the cron table file for the user you are logged in as, run:\n$ crontab -e\n\nYou will need to be familiar with vi in order to edit this file. Type “I” for insert, and then begin editing the cron table file.\nCron uses the following syntax: minute of the hour, hour of the day, day of the month, month of the year, day of the week, command.\nIt can be a little confusing at first, so let me give you an example. The following command will run the rsync command every night at 10 PM:\n0 22 * * * rsync -av --delete /Directory1/ /Directory2/\n\nThe first “0” specifies the minute of the hour, and “22” specifies 10 PM. Since we want this command to run daily, we will leave the rest of the fields with asterisks and then paste the rsync command.\nAfter you are done configuring Cron, press escape, and then type “:wq” (without the quotes) and press enter. This will save your changes in vi.\n\"\n", "Q: I ran \"dd if=file1\" on accident and gibberish started flowing - Bad?

The file was an OS I was trying to copy to a usb. I didn't type anything after \"if=filename\".\n\nA: Nope. All you did was floating your screen with raw content from that image. of=FILE operand will tell dd to NOT write to stdout. So as you missed that one, all content ended up in your terminal.\nIt could be, that your current terminal is messed up because the shell interpreted some of that gibberish text as format instructions.

Example: my app doomseeker has a folder in home that it says it has created (.doomseeker) and it won't display in the file explorer. Thank you very much.\n\nA: In Unix like operating systems, if a file or folder starts with a period, it is declared as a hidden file. To show the hidden files do the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the nautilus file manager which is called Files\n\n\n\n*Now go to the directory where the hidden files are\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now go to View>Show hidden files from the titlebar menu.

I've installed pdf-xchange using wine and found it buggy.\nThen I try to uninstall it, however it is not shown in wine-uninstall.\nSo I went to ~/.wine/folder and delete it. But when I right click a pdf file, there is an option \"open with pdf-xchange\", so how do I remove that?\n\nA: Wine works by storing a 'wineprefix' on the filesystem, by default ~/.wine. This contains a virtual window drive for the program being run under Wine - but when you install a program under wine it also adds files to other locations so it works properly with the linux system (so just deleting the wineprefix is not always enough):\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.local/share/appllictions - this contains .desktop files, which act as launchers in the dash/menu etc.\n\n*~/.local/share/icons - icons for the program\n\n*~/.local/share/mime - mimetypes for files - a mimetype is probably in here saying that PDFxchange can opens PDFs etc. \n\n*Some additional stuff -  e.g. ~/.config/menus/applications-merged, ~/.cache/fontconfig, /.local/share/desktop-directories etc. This will probably vary with the program that is installed.\n\n\nSo to remove it, removing the relevant 'pdf-xchange' and wine* files/folders in ~/.local/share/applications should be enough (note other programs use the above file and folders, so don't randomly delete everything) - then run update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/ and restart the desktop/file manager to make the changes.\n", "Q: how do I diagnose why a process is starting? I'm running an ubuntu box, mainly as a learning exercise, so I should probably begin by stating that I'm still very much at the \"copying commands until something works\" stage of unix knowledge. I recently upgraded from 14.10 to 15.04, and since that upgrade I've been having an issue with the daemon for the deluge torrent client.\nWhen I upgraded to 15.04, I followed the 'official' instructions for moving the deluged daemon over to systemd. As part of this process, I believe I deleted the old upstart configurations associated with this service. In both my previous and my new configuration, I'm launching the daemon under my own user account (launching it under a 'deluge' user caused problems for me when I first installed) - and this works, except for one issue.\nDespite my .service file being correct for the configuration I want, and despite this service starting normally and working fine when i do systemctl start deluged, I'm not able to start the service unless I kill an instance of deluged that is running at boot under the root user account. I don't want it to run as root, and as far as I'm aware, I've never configured it to do so - and this instance of the daemon obviously prevents my desired instance from starting up. I obviously don't want it running as root, partly because I know it's a bad idea, but also because it prevents the thin client from actually being able to connect.\nTl;dr: How can I work out what is causing this service to launch on startup as root, and how do I prevent it from doing so, so that I'm able to start the daemon properly without first having to manually kill the unwanted instance after each reboot? I have deleted all existing configs before following instructions, and as far as I know upstart and init.d are no longer active on my system anyway. There is a possibility that I did something dumb when I first installed that I don't remember, as deluge was one of the first things I configured on my first ever unix installation.\n(For anyone kind enough to provide an answer, my current unix competence is at the level of knowing whether a process/daemon is running, understanding and manually editing config files, a beginner understanding of how to interpret logs, and basically no understanding at all of the deeper concepts at work behind the scenes.)\n\nA: Because this doesn't seem to be that common a problem, and to resolve this after all this time, I'm answering my own question – turns out that the process was being started in /etc/rc.local, which was really stupid of me (and it's also fairly stupid that I didn't think to check there).\nSo, if there's any lesson to be learned here, it's to enumerate every possible way a fault can occur and then check the possibilities one by one, no matter how stupid, and no matter whether or not you think you already checked there.\n", "Q: 4 primary partition problem I am trying to install Ubuntu 15.04 on my Windows 7 HP pavilion g6.

Instead it is a better idea to add all users that should have administrative privilieges to the group sudo by executing\nadduser username sudo\n\nas root. That allows them to execute commands as root by typing\nsudo command\n\nand get a root shell by\nsudo -i\n\nOn top op that, you don't have to enable root login for ssh that way.\nThe home directory probably wasn't created because you added a user with an id (0) that already existed. Avoid setting the userid and groupid manually.\n\nStep-by-Step how-to create an admin user:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo adduser username\n\n*sudo adduser username sudo\n\nA: The first error is because you created a user whose home directory doesn't exist. This is one of the reasons why you should always use adduser instead of useradd. As explained in man useradd:\n   useradd is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian,\n   administrators should usually use adduser(8) instead.\n\nOne of the features of adduser is that it automatically creates the home directory for you. So, what you wanted to run was:\n    sudo adduser --gid 0 --uid 0 username\n\nThe next issue is that you have to allow root login. Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and change\nPermitRootLogin no\n\nto\nPermitRootLogin yes\n\nThen, restart the ssh server:\nsudo service ssh restart\n\n\nA: After hours it's finally done!\nI just create new user like this :\nuseradd -ou 0 myuser -p [#hash-password]\n\nand then I changed PermitRootLogin yes in this path : /etc/ssh/sshd_config\neasy as pie :)\n", "Q: MAAS node keeps re-installing Ubuntu 14.04 through PXE I'm trying to set up MAAS with about 8 nodes and I've been doing the automatic install through PXE which works great.  Problem is, every time I restart the machines through the MAAS web ui, the node re-installs the OS through PXE.  Should I be disabling PXE after the node is up and running so that it doesn't re-install every time? \nReason I ask is, I don't see this listed in the documentation anywhere, so I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to disable PXE on that machine.  Am I doing something wrong?  \nEdit #1 - BTW if I change the boot priority to set the PXE as the second boot, it drops me into the busybox mini shell and fails to start up. \nEdit #2 Solution - Ended up having to set the rootdelay=90 on the kernel line of the boot loader and then setting the PXE boot to a lower priority fixes my issues.\nThanks!\n\nA: Instead of disabling PXE boot altogether, just move the PXE boot a notch lower in the boot priority and then the systems will boot normally and will only start re-install when needed.\n", "Q: Click every link on multiple webpages In our project we have pages like http://123.4.5.6/3/4; inside there are a few pages.

From the output of fdisk it seems like you have three filesystems on that device, a small FAT, a 4Gb linux and a 28Gb linux filesystem.\nIn case I understand correctly what you want to do:\nIf you previously had 28GB of unallocated space you should not have created that new 28GB partition, instead you should use a utility such as gparted to extend the 4GB partition to maximum size. Now that you have, (assuming that it is empty of course) delete that empty 28Gb partition and extend the small 4Gb partition to use the whole device. Unmount any involved filesystems before you start to be safe. gparted is graphical and user-friendly. Just make sure you select the correct device.\n\nWell, you should delete the extra 28GB partition first. Then I guess you could use parted (the command line tool) to resize the first partition. But this is dangerous if you dont know exactly what you are doing, so I personally only use gparted. If you dont have parted you could change the size of the partition with fdisk but only if you are an expert, because you will have to mark the layout of all partitions, delete them and recreate them with exactly the same parameters for the partition start (down to sector position) and modify the end so that it fills the device. And if you lose power during the process or reboot without having fixed the partition table the system will become unusable. Also I dont know if you will be able to run resize2fs on your 4GB partition if that is the partition that is mounted on /\nI think the safest way for you to fix this is to shutdown your embedded system take the SD card from it and put it in a card reader on an ubuntu PC that has gparted, or boot an ubuntu installation CD/DVD on a PC without ubuntu and use gparted from there to modify the partition of the SD card (make sure you select the SD and not the PC's hard drive)\n\nA: For me it looks like the space is occupied form the partition 3 (/dev/mmcblk0p3). \nIf I understood correctly what you want to do, you have to delete the 3rd partition and then you can extent the 2nd (/dev/mmcblk0p2).\n", "Q: How to solve laptop overheating problem on ubuntu 14.04 I just installed ubuntu 14.04 alongside windows 7 laptop(Dell Vostro 1014) of mine.

On my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS laptop, I have a LAN connection with a static IP address as well as a WiFi connection to the internet using DHCP.

At present, I have to switch off the LAN to connect to the WiFi and vice versa.\n\nA: Step by Step Procedure:\nUbuntu allows multiple connections by default, but sometimes, we need to specify which one to use. In your comments, you have mentioned that you use LAN for the Intranet and WiFi for the Internet. \nSo, firstly search for Network Connections in the unity dash. Then, under the Ethernet section, click 'Add' button.\n\nThen,  we need to create a new Ethernet connection which we are going to enable manually. Uncheck the option of connecting automatically since this is your Intranet connection.\n\nThen go to the IPv4/IPv6 settings (depending on your network) and then click on the Routes button. Check the 'Use this connection only for resources on its network' option. Click Save.\n\nNow you can use both the LAN and WiFi simultaneously.\nSource\n\nA: I ran up against a similar problem in my question here: Access wired network camera(s) through a switch without disconnecting from wireless internet\nI ended up finding a solution, detailed here: https://askubuntu.com/a/652426/432882\nMy question was about setting up network cameras on a local \"intranet\" through a switch, so I think the solution might work for you as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Network Connections, e.g. by clicking on the network icon at the upper right and choosing \"Edit Connections...\"\n\n*Select the \"Wired connection #\" corresponding to the Ethernet port that will be connected to the switch. Choose \"Edit...\"\n\n*Under the IPv4 Settings tab, change the Method drop-down from \"Automatic (DHCP)\" to \"Disabled\"\n\n*Choose \"Save...\" A duplicate connection may appear in the list; choose \"Close\" and re-open Network Connections, and the duplicate will be gone (the duplicate item is a bug)\n\n*Choose \"Add\", select \"Ethernet\", and choose \"Create...\"\n\n*Type any name, e.g. \"Intranet switch\"\n\n*Under the IPv4 Settings tab, change the Method drop-down to \"Manual\"\n\n*Choose \"Add\" next to Addresses, and set Address to some value, either 10.m.n.p (e.g. 10.0.0.9), 172.q.r.s, or 192.168.y.z depending on how your intranet is set up. The address is for the Ubuntu computer, so it should be different from the other addresses on the intranet. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_address_spaces for details.\n\n*Set Netmask to 255.255.255.0 and leave Gateway blank. \n\n*Fill the DNS servers field* with some address, e.g. 10.0.0.10\n\n*Choose \"Save...\" and \"Close\"\n\n\nPlug the switch into the Ethernet port. The \"Intranet switch\" connection might connect automatically, or you may have to select it. You should now be connected to the intranet through the switch. Additionally, connecting to the wireless network allows access to the internet via typical URLs. I have not tested this with an intranet that uses URLs for navigation, so you may need to navigate by numerical addresses.\nI came upon this solution after watching the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqJ9PXhqOAQ\nTheoretically, everything can be undone relatively easily by deleting the \"Intranet switch\" connection and setting \"Wired connection #\" from \"Disabled\" back to \"Automatic (DHCP)\"\n*Please feel free to improve this answer by elaborating on the address in the DNS servers field.\n", "Q: Bluetooth not working on ubuntu14.04 dmesg | grep -i bluetooth\nis giving this output\n[   31.384146] Bluetooth: Core ver 2.17\n[   31.384170] Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager   initialized\n[   31.384180] Bluetooth: HCI socket layer initialized\n[   31.384184] Bluetooth: L2CAP socket layer initialized\n[   31.384196] Bluetooth: SCO socket layer initialized\n[   31.500587] Bluetooth: can't load firmware, may not work correctly\n[   33.506073] Bluetooth: hci0 command 0x1003 tx timeout\n\nand in the last\n[ 5703.089302] Workqueue: hci0 hci_power_on [bluetooth]\n[ 5703.089347]  [<ffffffffa0534bd5>] hci_dev_do_open+0x275/0x760      [bluetooth]\n[ 5703.089356]  [<ffffffffa05356b0>] hci_power_on+0x40/0x180 [bluetooth]\n[ 5703.089388] Bluetooth: can't load firmware, may not work correctly\n[ 5705.093470] Bluetooth: hci0 command 0x1003 tx timeout\n\nrfkill list output :-\n10: hci0: Bluetooth\nSoft blocked: yes\nHard blocked: no\n\nlsusb output:-\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:8000 Intel Corp. \nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 003: ID 064e:930b Suyin Corp. \nBus 002 Device 002: ID 0a5c:216d Broadcom Corp. \nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\n\nwhat can i do to get bluetooth working?\nit cannot be discovered by other devices and it cannot discover other devices.\n\nA: I suggest to install 3.19 kernel by\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\nAnd then follow the GUIDE to obtain, convert and install firmware.\nIt is not legal to distribute the firmware.\nBut I found a newer driver HERE.\nNew devices have been added and firmware files are newer.\n", "Q: How to view large comments in spreadsheet properly in Libreoffice?

Terminal commands that I would imagine are related exclusively to Ubuntu (it's version) are not referenced by a clear and logical ubuntu -v that is consistent with command flags for other queries I run through the terminal.\nThis question is not a feature request but rather that I genuinely believe there must be a good reason for this.

I can do this by deleting .config/monitors.xml and setting resolution to 1024*768 instead of auto and refresh to 60Hz instead of auto. And then saving the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file without merging the file. Then reboot and dual screen on third monitor appears - I login: then blank screen again. Input can't be handled.

Just select \"something else\" when you get to the part of the installation that asks if you want to install ubuntu \"along side\" windows.\nThen, right-click on the ubuntu partition, set it as \"type\" ext-4 and set the \"mount point\" to \"/\" and continue with the installation.\n\nIf you want to use gparted. You should use the USB you used to install ubuntu in a live session because you will not be able to edit your ubuntu partition while it is currently mounted, you must do that from a live session, from windows, or from another partition which does not exist right now. \nGparted is installed and available from the live session.

I currently use NX to connect to the remote machine and work on it in a GUI environment. On my host computer, I have 2 monitors of different sizes (22\" and 24\"). When I choose \"Fullscreen on all screens\" in NX it simply assumes there is one large screen and the top of the 22\" screen is cut off.\nWhat I want is a client that can spread over both of my screens and that the Linux machine will know that I have two monitors and behave accordingly. Is that possible with NX, or some other client?\n\nA: NX is difficult with multiple monitors. Furthermore, it is only supported until Ubuntu 12.04, but not in newer versions.

I recently installed Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.2 on to a bootable USB so that I can keep it handy anytime I want the Terminal Shell to work on scripting including Sed and AWK. Upon burning the ISO over the USB and booting from it the very first time, I was surprised seeing the option \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" and yet another option \"Install Ubuntu\". Didn't it install on my USB from the ISO image that I burnt? I chose to try Ubuntu without installing and a GUI appeared showing keyboard shortcuts to launch some apps but no Terminal. Is my USB stick holding a cut-down version of this beauty? Thanks.\n\nA: The ISO image you burnt on the USB drive is probably an installation package, which intended to install Ubuntu in your system from an external medium (in your case a USB drive, but it could have been a CD/DVD also). The installation package allows you to try Ubuntu before installing, or use Ubuntu occasionally without a permanent installation. See Installation/FromUSBStick\nAnyway, how did you attempt to open a terminal? Usual shortcuts are CTRL + ALT + F[1-6], for terminal 1 to 6, and CTRL + ALT + F7 to get back to the GUI. Or you can open a terminal window inside the GUI with CTRL + ALT + T.

The <xxxxx>.default folder is under ~/.molliza/ folder, i.e. where firefox stores its profiles.  <xxxxxx> is some weried strings different for each computer.\n\n*Use a plain text editor like vim to create a (new) userChrome.css file in the chrome folder (file name is case sensitive)\n\n*Paste the code in the userChrome.css file in the editor window\nMake sure that the userChrome.css file starts with the default @namespace line\n\n\nThe problem is solved.\n\nA: As of Firefox 68, Firefox does not (by default) check for a custom userChrome.css file. Thus, the was I solved this problem on my computer was in two steps.\n1. Create userChrome.css\nIn ~/.mozilla/<profile code>.<profile name>/ create a directory named chrome. In the chrome directory, create a file named userChrome.css with the following contents:\n/*\n   Override hiding of Bookmarks Toolbar in F11 full screen\n   when you roll down the tabs/main toolbar \n    src: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1212156?fpa=1\n    and https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html\n*/\n#navigator-toolbox[inFullscreen=\"true\"] #PersonalToolbar {\n  visibility: unset !important;\n}\n2. Configure Firefox to look for userChrome.css at startup.\nCopied from userchrome.org.\n\nTo make startup faster for most users, Firefox 69 will no longer look for this file automatically. You need to tell it to look. Here's how:\n\n*\n\n*In a new tab, type or paste about:config in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button accepting the risk.\n\n*In the search box above the list, type or paste userprof and pause while the list is filtered. If you do not see anything on the list, please ignore the rest of these instructions. You can close this tab now.\n\n*If the toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets preference is not already set to true, double-click it to switch the value from false to true.\n\nThat change should take effect on your next startup.\n\n", "Q: Boot from USB, but run on auxiliary hard drive I have a Dell Vostro 1700 that a friend gave me because it died.\nOn investigation I found that it no longer recognized the internal hard drives, but booted fine from an Ubuntu CD or from Ubuntu on a USB flash drive. It currently runs from the USB, but painfully slowly. I have a caddie that replaces the optical drive with a hard drive, but it is not recognized as a bootable drive so I can install Ubuntu on the hard drive and the laptop runs great until I shut down.  So what I would like to do is get it to boot from the USB flash drive, but then run from the hard drive in the CD caddie. Is this possible and how would you do it?\nI am doing this as a project to learn and just because.\n\nA: I could solve the same issue with the following method.\nI'll consider that for the rest of the article (change it as per your own configuration):\n\n*\n\n*the hard drive is sda and the boot partition is sda1 (which maps to (hd1,gpt1) in GRUB, (hd0) being the GRUB USB)\n\n*/dev/sda1 contains a /boot/vmlinuz kernel and /boot/initrd.img disk\n\n*the Ubuntu bootable USB is sdb under Ubuntu Live\n\n*the to-be GRUB USB is sdc under Ubuntu Live\n\nBoot on the Ubuntu Live USB:\n\n*\n\n*Insert the new USB and create on it an ext4 partition with grub_bios flag (that will be /dev/sdc1) and a second ext4 partition with \"boot\" flag (that will be /dev/sdc2 on which GRUB will boot)\n\n*Mount the second partition so grub-install can create the /boot/grub files: mount /dev/sdc2 /mnt\n\n*Install GRUB on it: grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt /dev/sdc\n\n*Edit file /mnt/grub/grub.cfg with the following content:\n\nset root=(hd1,gpt1)\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img\nboot\n\nReboot on the GRUB USB and it should be booting your hard drive.\nEDIT: As per @kenn's comment: it's better to use partitions UUIDs or labels instead of direct links to hard drive. The UUIDS (and labels) are available in your Ubuntu Live under /dev/disk/by-partuuid or /dev/disk/by-partlabel. Then use in your grub.cfg:\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz root=PARTUUID=<partition UUID>\n\nor:\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz root=PARTLABEL=<partition label>\n\n\nA: In general it is possible to boot from USB and run from a hard disk.  Install to the caddy disk, install again to another USB, and edit the USB's grub boot commands in /boot/grub/grub.cfg to point to the caddy disk.  The trick will be to figure out what letter the caddy will get when there is only one USB present. See http://www.linlap.com/dell_vostro_1700 for some specific video and wireless issues.\n  Your situation may have special problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is the internal hard disk not seen?  This could be an incipient motherboard failure.  USB booting may still work (for awhile longer), but no hard disk, even in the caddy may be referenced.\n\n*The caddy may cause grub problems.  Any reference to a caddy on an old HP caused grub to hang for a minute.  No reference within grub to the caddy worked, although the caddy worked fine as extra storage when running from another root.\n\n", "Q: XModMap Key Remapping Not Totally Working I have a Mac Keyboard I am using with new version of Ubuntu. Whenever in a web browser, I try and hit the F5 key to naturally refresh the page but in Ubuntu this key seems to be mapped to Keyboard Brightness Down.\nI verified this by running xev and hitting my F5 key and the keycode was mapped to XF86KeyboardBrightnessDown. I then went into another terminal and attempted to map it to a regular F5 with the command `xmodmap -e \"keycode 237 = F5\". The new problem is, when I hit F5 just once or multiple times, the default keyboard brightness behavior is still there, and F5 now only refreshes the page in a browser if I hold F5 down for a bit.\nI assume holding it down expires the event triggering of F5 to the OS, however in a browser like chrome, when the key is held down the events are still firing, and it eventually refreshed the page. So I assume right when the OS stops listening for the key, the browser is still listening at a higher level and default browser functionality of F5 kicks in.\nHow can I totally eliminate the default behavior of the F5 key to the OS?? Is what I want to do possible?\nEdit:\nAlso if I map F5 functionality to another key that has no default behavior like my F13 Key (which is mapped to XF86Tools but doesn't do anything) it instantly refreshed the page in a browser, I just have this issue with this key that right on a press, tries to modify the keyboard brightness which doesn't exist.\n\nA: Take a look at xbindkeys.\nCreate at $HOME/.xbindkeysrc and make sure to launch xbindkeys on startup.\n\"COMMAND IN HERE\"\n  F5\n\nIf you need to emulate another key press with the F5 key, look into xdotool.  I unfortunately don't have much experience with that one.\n\nA: This can be related to \"FN\" key being activated by default. If this is your case, try to press \"FN\" key and F5 or whatever key you need. If you don't care about advanced settings, you can check bios settings for settings related to \"FN\" key. reboot (or restart) your pc and press apropriate key, maybe \"del(ete)\" or \"F2\" by default. And try.

I prefer a software with GUI.\nI have tried MKVtoolNix but it does not work: it creates a file as big as the sum of the 4 files I have (so 8.4 GB), but it is actually the first file so the other 3 files have not been merged to the first.\nThanks\n\nA: What you need seems to be a Non Linear Editing System (NLES), which will allow you to place your portions of video (scenes) in a timeline in order to arrange them in the position they should be so that you can \"view\" a one single video scene playing.\nIn addition, you can manipulate your video by adding improvements like color correction, gamma, brightness and contrast adjustment and other useful things.\nIf you wish you can also slice your scenes and remove portions of each video clip and finally do a render of your video production into a single file.\nUbuntu is plenty of useful tools for even real time video processing but if you are used to Windows/Mac Software you will feel comfortable with KDENlive (https://kdenlive.org/) and Openshot (http://openshot.org/).\nMy favorite is kdenlive so I am going to place this screenshots over here in order to illustrate the timeline video placement:\n\nIn this timeline I am using 2 Video sources and 1 picture. 1 of the videos is having the \"Curves\" plugin and I am adjusting brightness level with that plugin. As you can see, kdenlive provides several tools for audio/video levels monitoring so that you can achieve professional results from your production.\nI used to work for TV/Radio Stations the last 20 years so let's say I worked with many digital audio/video file formats as from 1999. The Sony MTS is, if I don't mistake, a MP4 container unless you changed that from the options of your camcorder (if the camcorder features such function, of course) so you can mux/transcode the video files into a different file format without losing quality.\nWhen it is about muxing/remuxing/transcoding the very best GUI Tool for ffmpeg/avconv/mencoder seems to be the Mobile Media Converter by Miksoft (https://www.miksoft.net/mobileMediaConverter.php) of which I am going to illustrate as follows:\n\nMMC will also allow you to rip from DVD and Download from YouTube.\nSo. If you're involved in professional video editing you may agree that manipulating huge video files it a hard work. Unfortunately there's no \"automatic\" procedures if you wish to get stunning results.\nBut you're on your way.\nGood luck!\n\nA: What you need is this: http://www.videohelp.com/software/tsMuxeR It's a free program to merge/stitch your files. Just click 'add' and subsequent files you add with the 'join' button (so NOT the add button, you only use that for the first file). I used the default settings which will output a .ts file, which Openshot can load just fine.\nAs for the gentleman's answer above me:\n\nWhat you need seems to be a Non Linear Editing System (NLES), which will allow you to place your portions of video (scenes) in a timeline in order to arrange them in the position they should be so that you can \"view\" a one single video scene playing.\n\nI don't know how you do it but I sure like to know because when I drop MTS files in a non-linear video editor like Openshot the files don't get properly merged/stitched. There is always a second or two where the transition between one and the next MTS file isn't properly done; the video stutters and the audio drops. So right now those files have to be merged each time before editing the recording (i.e. the totality of all files).\n", "Q: DOWNLOADING UBUNTU- please any help on how to download Everytime i tried to download Ubuntu server on my windows laptop it always download as a zip file. please any help on how to download.\n\nA: *\n\n*Visit the official Ubuntu Server webpage and click the button that says Download Ubuntu Server.\n\n*Select the version of Ubuntu Server and click the Download button. \n\n*The Ubuntu Server iso file can be installed via a CD, DVD or USB flash drive after it has been downloaded.\n", "Q: tmux not reading my .tmux.conf I have the following entries within my .tmux.conf in home directory\nset-window-option -g xterm-keys on\nset -g default-terminal screen-256color\nset -g history-limit 10000\n\nHowever an echo $TERM within a new tmux window  reports tmux and not screen-256color.\nEven explicitly specifying the configuration file to be used via tmux -f has no effect.

It is kind of an annoyance for first time users, but it is truly a stand-alone package, it will drop the SDK in your /home and you need the android-studio and jdk1.8.0_45 folders at a fixed location.\nFirst, you need to set the JAVA_HOME path in your /etc/environment or ~/.bashrc configuration to the jdk1.8.0_45 folder before it will run.\nAfter setting your JAVA_HOME, run studio.sh again and it will boot the IDE.

You are in bin folder, now run this command: ./studio.sh\nIn Ubuntu \nSystem-Product-Name:~/Downloads/android-studio/bin$ ./studio.sh\n\n\n*Android Studio will be launched using the above command, next close the project using File -> Close Project from Android Studio,\nthen you'll find this screen:\n\nAt the Android Studio start screen below, click on Configure then create a desktop entry.\n\n*Finally you have to lock Android Studio to Launcher icon\nwhen you press right-click on Android Studio (on the left of the screen) click Lock to Launcher or Add to Favorites.\n\nA: After you start Android Studio for first time from the terminal with the command /path/to/android-studio/studio.sh there will be shown an icon on your launcher. Just right click it and choose \"lock to launcher\" and that's it - now you can start it from there\n", "Q: Find files belonging to a user with size in MB on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) I am using this command which is working fine:\nsudo find / -user web132 -ls\n\nBut when I am trying like\nsudo find / -user web132 -ls -lh\n\nI am getting a wrong syntax error. How can I get the file sizes belonging to a user in MB?\n\nA: You need to use exec predicate of find:\nsudo find / -user web132 -exec ls -lh {} +\n\nThis will execute ls -lh under the -exec predicate of find and will give you output in the human readable format. If you want to output always in megabytes you need some additional operations, the -h option in your ls -lh suggesting that you only want the output in human readable format.\n\nA: find / -size +100k -size -500M -user web132\n\nThis means to find a file larger than 100kb and smaller than 500mb.  The -ls option is about how the output is formatted, and has little to do with the ls command.\n\nA: Here's find + awk + numfmt version. Because -ls is a flag to find command, not an instance of ls, you cannot use -lh flags as well. However, if you insist on using the -ls flag with find, we can also try format the file size into human readable form. File size in output of find with -ls flag is field #7, thus using awk's two-way io, we just convert that field to a human readable form, and substitute it back.\nfind / -user web132 -ls | \n awk '{ command=\"numfmt --to=iec \"; command $7 | getline result; $7=result;print; close(command) }'\n\nHere's example with my home folder:\n$ find . -maxdepth 1 -user xieerqi -ls | awk '{ command=\"numfmt --to=iec \"; command $7 |& getline result; $7=result;print; close(command) }'   \n3018363 4 drwxr-xr-x 43 xieerqi xieerqi 4.0K Jun 22 00:33 .\n3409153 4 drwx------ 3 xieerqi xieerqi 4.0K Jun 22 00:33 ./.gconf\n3018459 4 -rw-rw-r-- 1 xieerqi xieerqi 756 Jun 11 00:08 ./record\n3018368 16 -rw------- 1 xieerqi xieerqi 13K Jun 21 23:14 ./.bash_history\n3018364 12 -rw-r--r-- 1 xieerqi xieerqi 8.8K May 28 03:59 ./examples.desktop\n3018535 4 -rw-rw-r-- 1 xieerqi xieerqi 64 Jun 21 16:04 ./testfile.txt\n3018473 4 drwxrwxr-x 2 xieerqi xieerqi 64 Jun 16 23:28 ./netmanager\n\nNote: from the discussion in the comments bellow, it seems that mawk has issues, but gawk(GNU awk) works perfectly fine. I've figured out an approach for mawk, which merely makes use of replacing $7 not as an argument, but as part of the command, that later gets expanded. Here's what I mean:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -user xieerqi -ls | mawk '{command=\"numfmt --to=iec \"$7; command  | getline var; $7=var;print  }'\n\nA: You can print the sizes of files in bytes using the find alone with %s format specifier:\nfind / -user web132 -printf \"%p %s\\n\"\n\nSince you want the size in megabytes, let's divide the last field by 1024*1024 using awk:\nfind / -user web132 -printf \"%p %s\\n\" |  awk '{printf \"%sB %fMB\\n\", $0, $NF/1048576.0}'\n\nThis way you'll always have the output in megabytes, unlike with ls -lh option that will use smaller units for smaller files.\nThere is also %k specifier that will use 1K block, so alternatively you can use:\nfind / -user web132 -printf \"%p %k\\n\" |  awk '{printf \"%sB %fMB\\n\", $0, $NF/1024.0 }'\n\n\nA: TL;DR find … -ls … is not the same as ls. If you need some parameters for ls you need the command ls. And -lh isn't a parameter for find, therefore the error.\n\nfind … -exec … is a good option. You could use also:\nsudo find / -user web132 -print0 | xargs -0 ls -lh {}\n\n", "Q: Download on Mac, run on Windows I have a Compaq Presario cq62 (Windows) laptop with a dead hard drive.

If you want something that is fairly straightforward, you can use TLP, which is a command-line power management tool developed by the folks at linrunner (see docs here).  \nOtherwise, check out the Ubuntu Wiki on the subject, it is fairly comprehensive and has some useful tweaks:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerManagement\n", "Q: Using AMD graphics card with Ubuntu (Sound) I understand this has been asked few times and I've read through few threads as swell but I didn't understand everything:\nI've read AMD graphics drivers and fglrx: No matching Device section for instance... found. how to fix it?.

It would just suspend for no apparent reason. I even sat there moving the mouse through the whole process to try to prevent it, but it still suspended.\nI read somewhere that 15.04 works better with the NUCs and several reports of Xubuntu working, so I gave that a shot (64 bit version). I did at least manage to get it installed and working, but it still randomly suspends. Sometimes it suspends immediately upon booting, other times I can use it for five or ten minutes before it suspends. It does this even though I have set it to never suspend in the power settings. \nOne thing I've noticed is that when I was trying to install Chrome, it always suspended when going to google.com/chrome, even though I was able to navigate to several other sites (this one included) without apparent issue. It does this on Chromium and Firefox. \nBut I don't have to go to that site for it to suspend. It does it eventually no matter what. Even if I'm not logged into the GUI.

I went to \"Display' and unchecked the mirror option and made it appear to the right of my primary monitor.\nNow the problem is that the panels on the second display are not showing while on the primary display they are showing.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: You can either create new panel in the primary display or move the panel from the second display to the first.\nRight click on empty space on the panel and choose Panel > Panel preferences... Once you have that open, you can move the panels around or add new one.\n", "Q: backing up and compressing /home directory using lzma Will this work?\nsudo tar -cvpf backboxhome.tar.gz/home/user --lzma\n\nI am mainly confused on where to place the --lzma argument. \n\nA: Your --lzma argument will work if you put it there but you have problems elsewhere.\nYou need to put space between backboxhome.tar.gz/home/user, also you are creating a lzma compressed archive, not a gzipped one so rename the backboxhome.tar.gz to e.g. backboxhome.tar.lzma (it would be ok if you name it as gz but you would get a hard time remembering what it is really and also while extarcting). \nYour command as a whole could take the form:\nsudo tar -cvpf backboxhome.tar.lzma /home/user --lzma\n\nAlthough a better practice is to use the options one after another:\nsudo tar --lzma -cvpf backboxhome.tar.lzma /home/user\n\nNote that lzma and xz both uses the same compression algorithm, in fact lzma is deprecated in favor of the newer xz. So you would be better off using xz (tar -J):\nsudo tar -cvpJf backboxhome.tar.xz /home/user\n\n", "Q: Why is python-pip kept back in Ubuntu 14.04?

Rather than assume you want them installed, apt 'holds back' the package until you specifically tell it to install it. If you don't mind these new packages being installed (you probably don't), then agree to the installation.\nIf you want to upgrade everything and don't mind installing any new dependencies, the command sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will install all upgrades and pull in any new dependencies required for the updated packages. Be careful because sometimes a new dependency means that an entire software package gets pulled in (e.g. gnome-desktop will require downloading and installing a bunch of dependencies). \n\nA: In your case run\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\ninstead of\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nTo see the differences, read the man-page:\nman apt-get\nupgrade\n\nUsed to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list(5). Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, nor are packages that are not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version. An update must be performed first so that apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.\n\ndist-upgrade\n\nIn addition to performing the function of upgrade, this option also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones, if necessary.\nThe /etc/apt/sources.list(5) file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for over-riding the general settings for individual packages.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1 is consuming 7.8 gigs of 8 gigs ram?

The Linux kernel keeps around huge amounts of file metadata\n  and files that were requested, until something that looks more\n  important pushes that data out. It's why you can run:\nfind /home -type f -name '*.mp3'\nfind /home -type f -name '*.aac'\n\nand have the second find instance run at ridiculous speed.\nLinux only leaves a little bit of memory 'free' to handle spikes in\n  memory usage without too much effort.\n\nNow you have many tools to list the process such the GUI app system monitor or CLI tools such as top , htop etc....\nYou could just fire up top and press M to sort processes by memory usage.\n", "Q: Cleaning old kernels does not work I am a new Ubuntu user, so please have patience.\nIt all started when my /root partition became full.

The one you have installed Ubuntu from is fine.\nFirst, boot to Windows, where in System Settings - Administration there was (in Win 7) a utility to change partition sizes. Shrink Windows partition to make some room. Do not touch the Linux partitions with it!\nSecond, boot with Ubuntu Live medium (Usb stick, or CD or whatever), run the Gparted software (it is preinstalled in Ubuntu Live) and use in to enlarge and move Linux partitions. Gparted is not very good at handling NTFS partitions, hence the Windows action first.\n", "Q: Apply display settings to all user accounts? I spent some time getting my settings correct for multiple monitors, and that is working fine when I am logged in, but is not right at the login screen or for other users.\nHow do I set the display settings globally for all users and the login screen?\n\nA: To set your screen configuration for every user on log in (this will not change the configuration on the log in screen), you can create a .desktop file in /etc/xdg/autostart\nHow to do that\n\n\n*\n\n*find out the name of the screen you'd like to be rotated by running xrandr. It will output a number of lines, among thos a few lines looking like:\nVGA-0 connected\n\nThis gives you information on the names of the connected screens.\n\n*Pick the one you want to have rotated, in my example below VGA-0\n\n*Create a launcher with (e.g.) gedit:\nsudo -i gedit /etc/xdg/autostart/set_screens.desktop\n\nPaste the text below into the file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=set_screens\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10&&xrandr --output VGA-0 --rotate left\"\nType=Application\n\nreplace in the line:\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10&&xrandr --output VGA-0 --rotate left\"\n\nThe string: VGA-0 by your (rotated) screen's name.\nImportant notes\n\n\n*\n\n*In the line\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10&&xrandr --output VGA-0 --rotate left\"\n\nI included a sleep 10. That is because sometimes, xrandr commands break if they run too early, before the desktop is \"finished\" loading. Possibly you need to increase the break, or you could try leaving it out. In the command, as it is, the screen rotates after 10 seconds after log in of any user.\n\n*The command:\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --rotate left\n\nrotates the screen left, no need to say that if you'd like another type of rotation, you can choose either left, right, normal, inverted (see also here).\nExplanation\nYou can run commands on startup (actually log in) by placing a .desktop file (launcher) in ~/.config/autostart. This will only run the launcher for a single user. If you do the same, but place the launcher in /etc/xdg/autostart, the command runs whenever any user logs in, unless a specific user disables the launcher for him or her in Dash > Startup Applications\nAdditionally, you can simply copy your local ~/.config/monitors.xml file to /var/lib/lightdm/monitors.xml to also make the settings work on log in screen. \nImo the combination of this, and the solution above (a launcher in /etc/xdg) is the easiest solution to achieve exactly what you want for both the login screen and (any) user. Also, the solution of a launcher in /etc/xdg is (very) easily reversed or changed in case you'd need to make another setup, without editing many files on (each) user's level, since both the user's settings and the login screen are managed for all users at once in two simple files.\n\nA: Just wanted to add a comment for anyone finding this struggling with a similar issue. I was stuck with resolution of my old monitor (1280x1024) every time I log in, but the login screen and guest user login use the correct default 1680x1050. \nI've read a lot of posts over the last four months looking for an answer, reading up on xorg.conf, monitors.xml, lightdm and xrandr and other suggestions - but some config changes are complicated and carry the risk of breaking the display entirely, so I ended up using the gui to change the monitor setting manually every login. \nToday I did a grep for the old resolution in my .config folder. \ngrep -HrnIF '1280' .config | less\n\nFirst result was ~/.config/autostart/xrandr.desktop file containing this, \nExec=xrandr -s 1280x1024 -r 75\n\nso I just moved the file out of there. And bingo, I log in and get the default 1680x1050 resolution. \nIt took me a few hours of searching and I couldn't find a close enough answer, so posting here in case it's useful to someone.  \n\nA: Depending on the way you've set up your system, it might be as easy as copying the monitors.xml file from the correctly set-up user to all users:\nTo test this for one user:\ncp --preserve=timestamps /home/CorrectUser/.config/monitors.xml /home/TestUser/.config/\n\nthen log off TestUser if already logged in, log back on and see whether everything is correct.\nThe command for all users:\ncp /home/CorrectUser/.config/monitors.xml /tmp/\nfor szUser in /home/* ; do sudo cp --preserve=timestamps /tmp/monitors.xml $szUser/.config/ ; done\n\nThe command for the login screen:\nsudo cp --preserve=timestamps /home/CorrectUser/.config/monitors.xml /var/lib/lightdm/.config/\n\nThe command for all future users¹:\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/skel/.config\nsudo cp --preserve=timestamps /home/CorrectUser/.config/monitors.xml /etc/skel/.config/\n\nNote¹: All users you'll be creating in the future\n\nA: for Ubuntu 21.10 the display manager is gdm3 and the command to change the login screen resolution is\nsudo cp -v ~/.config/monitors.xml /var/lib/gdm3/.config/\n\nthe other existing user can be set with\nfor u in /home/*\ndo\n   if [ \"$u\" != \"$HOME\" ]\n   then\n       sudo cp -v ~/.config/monitors.xml \"$u/.config\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nand future users\n   sudo mkdir -v /etc/skel/.config/\n   sudo cp -v  ~/.config/monitors.xml /etc/skel/.config/\n\nNote: the -v is optional\nNB: don't bother with /root the root user as you should NEVER login as root in the GUI it is very dangerous\n\nA: You may wish to append something to /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf. Here we create a script that uses an xrandr command to setup your display(s). You can use some graphical RandR tool to create a command for you, such as arandr. In my case, the script would look like:\n#!/bin/sh\nxrandr --output DVI-I-1 --mode 1600x1200 --pos 0x0 --rotate left --output DVI-I-0 --off --output DP-3 --off --output DP-2 --off --output DP-1 --mode 1600x900 --pos 1200x700 --rotate normal --output DP-0 --off\n\nYou can put this script in /usr/share or wherever you want. Your script may look far less complex, as this is for a complex dual-monitor setup. Then append something like:\nsession-setup-script=/usr/share/mycustomxrandr.sh\n\nand:\ndisplay-setup-script=/usr/share/mycustomxrandr.sh\n\nMake sure the file is executable, so:\nchmod a+x mycustomxrandr.sh\n\nThe session-setup-script will set the display for after you login through LightDM, and display-setup-script will change the display for the login screen.\n\nA: On my system (Ubuntu 16.04) for login screen simply cp'ing as root (using sudo) didn't work. You may also need to make sure that the owner/group of monitors.xml is lightdm:lightdm.\nsudo chown lightdm:lightdm /var/lib/lightdm/.config/monitors.xml\n\n", "Q: Can I get Directx 10/11 working on Ubuntu 14.04 or higher?

I'm working on developing a python application for Ubuntu that enables a user to have their desired resolution without requiring graphics drivers.\n In order to do this I've been using xrandr, which so far, has been pretty useful\nHowever, I now have a problem; how can I detect the monitor name? I was intending to use a terminal command through os.system, modifying the terminal output to get the required monitor output, and then storing it within the program. Unfortunately, despite much searching, I have been unable to find out how I can do this.\nIs there any way in which I can do this?\nTo sum it up: I'm looking for a terminal command that gives me the monitor name, such VGA1 or DVI-0\n\nA: You can use the bash command with popen:\nimport os\nlist_display = os.popen(\"xrandr --listmonitors | grep '*' | awk {'print $4'}\").read().splitlines()\n# or based on the comment of this answer \nlist_display = os.popen(\"xrandr --listmonitors | grep '+' | awk {'print $4'}\").read().splitlines()\n\nor I wrote a old gist on the subject\nhttps://gist.github.com/antoinebou13/7a212ccd84cc95e040b2dd0e14662445\n\nA: You can use python and just python to get the connected monitor names:\n$ python3 -c 'from gi.repository import Gdk; screen=Gdk.Screen.get_default(); \\\n[print(screen.get_monitor_plug_name(i)) for i in range(screen.get_n_monitors())]'\nDP1\nLVDS1\n\n\nA: I am not sure how you are going to apply it in your application (\"enable a user to have their desired resolution without requiring graphics drivers\" ?), but:\nA terminal command to list connected screens\nxrandr | grep \" connected \" | awk '{ print$1 }'\n\nThis wil give you the connected screens for further processing, like:\nVGA-0\nDVI-I-1\n\nSince you mention python, the snippet below will also list connected screens:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\ndef screens():\n    output = [l for l in subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()]\n    return [l.split()[0] for l in output if \" connected \" in l]\n\nprint(screens())\n\nThis wil also give you the connected screens, like:\n['VGA-0', 'DVI-I-1']\n\nNote\nNote the spaces around \" connected \" in the searched string.

I want to know why I might be able to login? \nI searched in B for authorized_keys, and I found one but it was empty file. So if it is empty I assume nobody should be allowed to login using private key. \nBut I probably do not know something.\nSo if somebody cracks server A and knows the passphrase, then he is able to login to server B currently.\nUpdate:\nOk, after I tried opening the same authorized_keys file with sudo, then I see its not empty.

Here you can set different autologin actions, where to put the keys for accessing to the servers, etc. \nThis file can be found at '$HOME/.ssh/config'. If exists, here you have the key to connect. \n", "Q: Back up symbolic links (not the files they link to) with Dropbox Dropbox follows symbolic links. Apparently this is useful. But I have a folder with very large data files I do not wish to back up online. I have physical backups for it. However, I have various symbolic links referring to files on that folder. I have tried the following, and neither work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put my folders on Dropbox and use symbolic links on my computer.\n\n*Put symbolic links on Dropbox\n\n\nIn both cases, Dropbox backs up the files and in both cases, using selective sync deletes the files the symbolic links refers to, even though they are NOT on my Dropbox folder. So, is there a way to put my folders in Dropbox but prevent Dropbox from backing up symbolic links to large files? I cannot seem to use selective sync without deleting the files in my computer.\nThanks for the help! \n\nA: Dropbox actually does not follow symbolic links.\nWell, it does, but not when the file is edited.  So if you add a symlink, the original file will be backed up to your other computers.  But if you edit that file on another computer, the symlink will be broken.  That came as quite a shock when it happened to me.\nDropbox only works the way you (as a Linux user) expect when the original file is in Dropbox, and the symlink is elsewhere.  So a solution for you would be to copy all your small files into your dropbox folder, then link them from their original locations in your filesystem.  You could do that with a (long) one-line find command.\nSee my answer here : Does dropbox sync hardlinks? \n\nA: I've had the same issue, and the best solution I've found is to use Link-type desktop files.\nFor example, to link to the path\n/media/nathaniel/media/my-media-files/Audiobooks\n\nI use this desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Link to media drive Audiobooks\nType=Link\nURL=file:///media/nathaniel/media/my-media-files/Audiobooks/\nIcon=folder\n\nand call it e.g. media-drive-audiobooks.desktop.\nNow I can copy this wherever I like and jump to the audiobooks folder from there.\nIt works the same as the examples.desktop file,\nand functions for both files and folders.\nNote that the URL field must be a proper file:// URL,\nso only absolute paths are possible.\nSome file managers will help you with generating these files.\nThis also solves the problem of internal links in the Dropbox folder, which can cause syncing conflicts or data loss.\nRelated:\n\n*\n\n*Cross-system file links\n\n\n*Correct way to create a Desktop Entry file of Directory type?\n\n\n*What does examples.desktop do?\n\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/310618/is-it-possible-to-create-a-soft-link-on-my-desktop-which-opens-with-the-target-p\n\n\n*Is it possible to create a folder shortcut in Kubuntu?\n", "Q: Can't access my router 192.169.1.1 or 192.168.1.254 is not working.

I'm running the following commands in Ubuntu 14.04:\nroot@ubuntu:~# service rpki-ca restart \nstop: Unknown job: rpki-ca\nstart: Unknown job: rpki-ca\nroot@ubuntu:~# sudo service rpki-ca restart \nrpki-ca stop/waiting\nrpki-ca start/running\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nWhat's the effect of sudo in the second command? Why does root need sudo?\n\nA: Ok, Googling this, finding this U&L answer, checking its revisions history and following the quoted source in the revision #1, this happens to be an Upstart bug; the problem is that when switching to root running su the $UPSTART_SESSION environment variable is carried from the previous environment instead of being set again.\n\nAfter much banging my head and googling, I've found a post (https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/120050/sudo-service-vsftpd-returns-unknown-job-vsftpd) showing that\nsudo service xxxx start (or stop, or restart)\nworks, while\n`service xxxx start (in a su session)\ndoes not work.\nSo the culprit was clearly the environment: If you go root with \"su\" instead of \"sudo su\" or \"su -\", \"service\" does not to work correctly either, as \"su\" will carry most of your normal user environment to the root session.\nAfter some testings, I found that the culprit is the UPSTART_SESSION environment variable, which comes set when you \"su\", but not set when you \"sudo su\" or \"su -\". Here are some test results:\n-- does not work\njsveiga@dell:~$ su\nPassword:\nroot@dell:/home/jsveiga# service smbd restart\nstop: Unknown job: smbd\nstart: Unknown job: smbd\n\n-- works even from a su session\nroot@dell:/home/jsveiga# sudo service smbd restart\nsmbd stop/waiting\nsmbd start/running, process 3823\n\n-- works\nroot@dell:/home/jsveiga# exit\njsveiga@dell:~$ sudo su\nroot@dell:/home/jsveiga# service smbd restart\nsmbd stop/waiting\nsmbd start/running, process 3862\n\n-- works\nroot@dell:/home/jsveiga# exit\njsveiga@dell:~$ su -\nPassword:\nroot@dell:~# service smbd restart\nsmbd stop/waiting\nsmbd start/running, process 3905\n\n-- going su then unsetting the UPSTART_SESSION works\nroot@dell:/home/jsveiga# exit\njsveiga@dell:~$ su\nPassword:\nroot@dell:/home/jsveiga# service smbd restart\nstop: Unknown job: smbd\nstart: Unknown job: smbd\nroot@dell:/home/jsveiga# unset UPSTART_SESSION\nroot@dell:/home/jsveiga# service smbd restart\nsmbd stop/waiting\nsmbd start/running, process 4244\n\nSo the start/stop scripts are failing somehow simply by the presence of the UPSTART_SESSION environment variable.\nBR,\n  Joao S Veiga\n\nTo fix this, just unset $UPSTART_SESSION:\nunset UPSTART_SESSION\n\nor switch to root by other means, like su -, sudo su or sudo -i.\n\nA: In that context, it means nothing and should be removed.  Without specifying some other user, sudo tries to become root, and so if you are already root, that is a no-op, other than creating an additional process ( for sudo itself ) which occupies some resources until the command it is running finishes.\n", "Q: CRITICAL **: gst_app_src_set_size: assertion 'GST_IS_APP_SRC (appsrc)' failed As reported here before, in some cases, at least, firefox won't play bandcamp tracks.

I've been looking at playing around with MAAS for building cloud networks but is there any reason why this couldn't been used to build a local network as well? \nI was thinking that if you had a MAAS machine and plug in a number of laptops into that MAAS network then MAAS could be used to build all those laptops to a certain spec\nSo in theory this could be a replacement for clonezilla or fog ghosting machines? \n\nA: Yes.  There is no difference between loading an image with some other system and loading it with MaaS.  The only issue I might see is that MaaS is linux server centric, and there don't seem to be any good tools for building custom images for it.  Thus, it doesn't lend itself to loading Desktop or Windows.  \nA work around might be to build \"Fast Installer\" images, which I understand to be the equivalent of actual images, as opposed to installing from scratch.  The downside to that is you would have to find or write scripts that can interact with the non-linux target OS to tell it machine name, security, domain membership, etc.\n[edit]\nHere is a link to a sight that explains how you install windows with MaaS:\nhttp://wiki.cloudbase.it/maas\n\nA: MAAS uses the curtin (or fast path installer) to install images, this copies the image onto the local disk and reboots into it.  So, technically it is possible to install any image and it would install it.\nHowever, MAAS uses cloud-init in any operating system image to customise the server on booting.\nThis is a requirement of any image that MAAS deploys using the fast-installer.  Any operating system is capable of running cloud-init, including Windows, but it must be pre-installed into the image so that it is compatible with MAAS boot process.\nMAAS can therefore deploy any Windows, Linux Desktop or Linux Server image as long as cloud-init package is already installed in the image.\nPreparation of images is already done for Ubuntu, in the standard cloud image.  There is a package for creating CentOS or RH based images available in Launchpad here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/maas-image-builder\nWindows images are created by cloudbase and instructions are provided here:\nhttp://wiki.cloudbase.it/maas\nThe only comment I would have about building portable hardware with MAAS is that MAAS expects to manage servers in data centres or at least hardware that is permanently connected.\nLaptops are not a good fit for MAAS and Cloud-init in general, most things would actually work once timeouts were reached, but this would delay the bootup sequence.\nAlso, MAAS expects to be able to control the hardware power with IPMI or another similar technology, laptops do not come with.\nA home network or classroom network with machines permanently connected on a wired network would work well though.  A good use of MAAS would be to deploy machines in the classroom according to which OS you need to run for an upcoming lesson.\n", "Q: How to get Apple Color Emojis to work on Ubuntu? In order to get Emojis rendered on Ubuntu machines, one can simply install the ttf-ancient-fonts package.\nBut these are not coloured and by far not as nice as the well-known Apple Color Emojis.\nHow can I install these on my Ubuntu machine? Especially, on my Ubuntu Touch device would be nice.\n\nA: The Apple Color Emoji font will not work in Linux and is not licensed for use outside Apple products.\nI'll assume your actual goal is simply displaying color emoji on Linux. You can install EmojiOne Color or Twitter Color Emoji for full color emoji, including skin tone diversity, and country flags.\nNote: The font uses the SVG-in-OpenType format and will currently only show color emoji in Firefox, Thunderbird and other Mozilla Gecko-based applications. This is not a limitation of the font, but of the operating systems and applications. Regular B&W outline emoji are included for backwards/fallback compatibility.\nAvailable for manual installation on the Github release pages or via my Launchpad PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:eosrei/fonts\nsudo apt-get update\n# Choose one!\nsudo apt-get install fonts-emojione-svginot\n# Or\nsudo apt-get install fonts-twemoji-svginot\n\nEmojiOne Color in Firefox:\n\nTwitter Color Emoji in Firefox:\n\nProbably obvious, but full disclosure anyway: I made both fonts.\n\nA: It isn't very easy to do this but if you have KDE it will be a little easier.\nFirst, Open Terminal and type the following command:\nsudo apt install kubuntu-desktop\n\nOnce it is done installing, go to https://www.emojipedia.org/apple in your webbrowser. Screenshot each one of those emojis. Open the screenshots with gimp and transparent the background.\nNow, open system settings and click on the tab that says icons. It will put you in icon settings. In icon settings there will be two tabs. One will say Icons, and one will say Emoticons. Click the one that says Emoticons. A little plus sign will be on the bottom left corner. Click it. It will ask for the name of the theme so put Apple. Then it will ask you to select the theme of emoticons you want to create so click KDE Emoticons Theme.\nNow, click the tab that says Apple. There will be a plus sign on the bottom left corner and one in the middle click the one in the middle. Add all the screenshots you took and type what you want to activate them.\nThen, select Apple as your default emoji theme.\nWhen you toggle emoticon list, the apple emojis will be there instead of the google emojis.\nOnly do this if you really care about having apple emojis on ubuntu because it is pretty hard to screenshot each one of the emojis and transparent the backgrounds.\n\nA: You can install the Apple emoji font following the instructions on this repository.\nAfter installing that font I got the Apple emojis on some pages, like emojipedia, but not in many other websites or Linux apps, such as the terminal.\n\nA: In addition to the Apple Color Emojis being proprietary, I'm pretty sure Ubuntu doesn't support colour bitmap fonts.\nSo, for use in single documents, you can fall back to images (dirty, I know). For quick everyday use though, you'll have to cope with the simple emojis from the Ancient package for now.\n\nA: In my post above I said you have to screenshot each emoji and transparent the backgrounds in gimp. It turns out, you don't have to do that. You can just right click each emoji and click save image. The image is already transparent. This makes it a little bit easier to do.\n", "Q: Repository with cinnamon-desktop-environment for Ubuntu I need a repository with cinnamon-desktop-environment for Ubuntu.

PS:the model of ethernet adapter is Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411. and the version of Ubuntu is ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: You face this problem, because you probably compiled r8168 driver from source and blacklisted r8169 kernel driver that is supposed to manage this device.\nThis a working but a wrong way to install drivers in Ubuntu. You will have to re-install the driver after each kernel upgrade. \nIt is true that some revisions of r8168 chips work not perfectly with default kernel driver, but it is getting improvements.\nIf you build a kernel module from source, after each kernel upgrade it does not work. This is normal.\nI can suggest first of all test if the default kernel driver works OK.\nYou need to look in files located at /etc/modprobe.d/ for line\nblacklist r8169\n\nRemove this line using `sudo gedit -H  and save the file.\nOr remove the whole file if it is the only string there by\nsudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/<file_name>\n\nReboot and test your network.\nIf you still have issues, then you can always install r8168-dkms package from Ubuntu repository by running\nsudo apt-get install r8168-dkms\n\nThis module will rebuild after kernel upgrades.\n\nA: I had to reinstall r8168-dkms time to time after updates, because it was working but \"not so good\" - noticeable delays even in VNC conenction, low iperf results when checked..\nAfter reinstalling compiled dkms and blacklisted r8169, gigabit link mean gigabit iperf result, no delays, no problem at all.\nThat was Asrock Baitrail J1900 onboard realtek, but another in pci-e port, and even dual lan..  all cards I had here were the same realtek 8169 chip.. All in troubles with default driver.\nAnd \"some\" of them (tp-link I guess), seemed to have reversed link detaction - driver think the cable is unplugged when link is on, and vice versa..\nRecently I moved to Asrock Broadwell N3050M board, where (what a surprise) was realtek 8169 onboard as well.. \nBut this time, I had to upgrade kernel (I guess), and went to lts-vivid with 3.19 kernel, where old dkms refused to install.\nBut realtek has newer dkms driver right on their web and it works.

It manages services and starts/stops them at appropriate times, and captures their output into logs stored at appropriate locations. Upstart is also able to run services for each user, and the logs of these user-specific services are stored in ~/.cache/upstart by default.\nHere is it's documentation\nAs to what caused them to grow so big, that's not up to Upstart, but to the applications being run. (In this case, gnome-keyring for one.) Inspect the logs to see what went wrong.\nTo see which programs are being run so, do:\ninitctl list\n\nThe configuration files for these services will be in ~/.config/upstart (if you created some yourself), or in /usr/share/upstart/sessions (for those that come with Ubuntu).\n\nCan I just delete them for a quick fix?\n\nYep.\n\nA: The accepted answer fixes the symptom but not the problem.\nThe problem is an application (or rarely but possibly more than one) that runs amok filling the logs with garbage - probably error messages.\nIt's ok to delete the huge log file, but it will grow again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the largest log file, and check the content of the directory a few times to find which file is growing.\nls ~/.cache/upstart\n\n\n*Open System Monitor, sort by CPU, and check which application with similar name is active. Kill it. This application is likely to have this problem again, so try to use a different program.\n\n\n*\n\n*or run ps -aux | grep -i ..aPartFromTheLogFileName.. to find the offending app, and kill -9 ..itsProcessNumber...\n\n\n*If it didn't solve the issue, Open the growing log file with glogg, and search Google for the error message.\n\n*If it's something you cannot fix, here's how to mute the symptom forever (for me it was gnome-session-Unity.log):\n ln -s /dev/null ~/.cache/upstart/gnome-session-Unity.log\n\nNote that it will not fix the problem with the application, but it will send the log messages to oblivion.\n", "Q: (Lubuntu) Can't open onboard keyboard Ok so i'm in need of a virtual keyboard.

As GDM is GNOME Display Manager but it installs the GNOME desktop also when I replaces it with LightDM So what is the difference between installing GDM or installing Gnome-desktop environment?\n\nA: Installing gnome-desktop gives you the GNOME desktop environment. You can access it through lightdm desktop manager (Ubuntu's default) even if you don't have gdm. On the other hand, gdm is merely login screen. Surprisingly enough, if you do apt-cache show gdm it reports that gnome-shell is one of the dependencies, but apt-cache show gnome-desktop reports that gdm is only a recommended package. Why is it so ? I don't know, and probably only the developers can tell you. \n\nA: lightdm and GDM are both 'display managers'.  They govern how and when your 'desktop environment' loads.\nGnome, KDE and XFCE are all examples of desktop environments, and should be compatible with both lightdm and GDM.\n", "Q: Scanning for BTRFS files systems After upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 to a point release, I get a message \"scanning for btrfs file systems\" at start-up.

You can do more than just transfering files with it.\nAndroid App\n\nA: Xender can be used to transfer files between devices easily. \n\nUse the \"Connect to PC option.\" Then visit http://web.xender.com/ and scan the QR code. \nIn case your phone or the PC does not have internet access, you can manually connect by using your browser by visiting the IP address mentioned in the App.\n\nA: You can use Kdeconnect it's great app no only for sharing but to you can view notifications and other stuff..\n\nA: Depends on how much you want to transfer. I use Dropbox on Ubuntu, and Dropbox with DropSync on Android. I tired Kdeconnect, and it was not plug and play. I would have had to mess with ports, firewalls, etc. I CAN do that, but I prefer NOT to do that. I just set up a non public directory in either Ubuntu or Android and it gets reflected on both devices. I then push on the circling arrow emblem (push a poll request) using dropsync and it bypasses the sync cycle timer and causes instant sync. Drag and drop on ubuntu, and use a filemanager on Android to write them between source/destination directory on Android and the transfer directory in the Dropbox application. (Ubuntu has foreced all access to go through an abstraction that requires apps to create 'connectors', vs straight filesystem access. Basically, they are trying to force you to use Google products for cloud storage.\n\nA: Just install Dukto. It's a good alternative to SHAREit. You need to install this tool on both devices Ubuntu and Android. Once installed, you can use the easily. Dukto makes it easy to transfer a large file in just minutes http://www.bettertechtips.com/ubuntu/transfer-files-ubuntu-android-wifi/\n\nA: You can achieve a file transfer from your PC/Laptop(with a Linux distro) to Phone using following command:\n\n\n*\n\n*In terminal go to the specific folder which contains the file to be sent to your phone.\n\n*Issue command:\npython3 -m http.server\nthis will create a server with port 8000(Default port).\nIf you want to use a different port issue the command:\npython3 -m http.server 9999\nthis will create a server with port no 9999\nIf you have python 2 then use:\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 9999\n\n*In another terminal find your ip using the command ifconfig\n\n*In your phone go to url.\nhttp://<your ip>:8000/\nyou can find all your file listed there.\nNote, for this to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both the phone and your system must be connected to same wifi access point or must be in same network.\n\n*Python 2.x or 3.x should be installed in your system.

Please someone help me to solve this problem so that I can save my applications in live OS mode even after shutdown.\n\nA: When you boot from a Live CD / DVD, the operating system is copied from the CD / DVD into a ramdisk, and every modification done to the currently running system is applied to the ramdisk. A ramdisk (per its scope) is going to lose all the informations contained in it upon shutdown (to be precise upon power cut; it also actually takes a while for the RAM capacitors to discharge, but that's another story). This means that any modification, pretty much like the type of memory in which gets stored, is volatile.\nIf you want to boot from a Live CD / DVD with some applications ready to be used, one solution is to customize a Live CD / DVD, altough this still won't allow you to store the applications' settings or any file.\nIf you want to store those, the only feasible solution is the installation of the operating system on a writable drive (such as on an internal hard disk or on a USB drive of any mean)\n", "Q: log into a machine on same wireless network I have an Ubuntu server on a wireless network, supplied by Verizon, at home. How do I log into this server from my laptop which also has access to the same wireless network?\nThanks,\nAnjan \n\nA: Sure.  From Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nssh <host-username>@<hostname/ip-address>\n\nIf you don't know what the ip address of your server is, you can use nmap to find it (I am not an nmap expert, but something like sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.1-255 will usually do the trick.  Your server should be one of the hosts that nmap returns. \n", "Q: Dell vs Lenovo trackpoint/nipple/trackstick mouse drivers? I have a Dell Latitude 6 series, 3rd gen, with a track-point. In windows, it feels great. In Linux, it feels kind of disappointing. The best way I can describe it is that it is too easy to move it in a straight line; if I just press left, it'll move perfectly left. In windows, the sensitivity is much more precise to subtle movements.\nThis means that it's hard to land the mouse right between letters, for instance.\nWhat's interesting is that I have an external Lenovo \"Thinkpad\" branded keyboard with a trackstick. When I plug that in and use it instead I get exactly the behaviour I want. It's able to detect very subtle pressure sensitivity, allowing me to easily split pixelated hairs.\nWhat's going on? Is there some mouse driver I can download or something that's better suited to the Dell trackstick? This is seriously such a big issue that it put me off of Linux for months.\nI got this same mouse behaviour in manjaro liveboot, btw (the Dell feeling imprecise).\n\nA: You can play with setting different values to different trackpoint properties and maybe compare props of your Lenovo trackpoint with Dell's.\nUse the command xinput list to see all input devices and their IDs. Then use xinput list-props $ID to see what the device is capable of and xinput set-prop $ID $PropID $value. I wrote some examples in another topic, but it's about Thinkpad trackpoint: here. There's also a brief instruction how to make changes permanent.\nI think your issue is related to acceleration or movement smoothing.\n", "Q: Font error in Evince When I open a pdf file in Evince from a terminal:\nI/O Error: Cannot open '/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/tex-gyre/texgyrecursor-regular.otf'\nSyntax Error: failed to load truetype font<0a>\nsome font thing failed\n\nThere are some program code not shown in the pdf file. I wonder what the error means and what I can do? Thanks.\n\nA: The issue is due to the AppArmor profile of Evince, which restricts the file resources available to Evince.\nBecause TexLive fonts are made available to the system, they might get picked up by Evince under certain circumstances (on my system, there is a rule defined in /etc/fonts/conf.avail/30-metric-aliases.conf which binds \"Tex Gyre Heros\" and \"Helvetica\". Because I don't have the Helvetica font installed, Tex Gyre Heros gets picked up by fontconfig instead).  \nThe error message is somewhat misleading, but if you looked at the kernel logs (type dmesg in the console, or tail -f /var/log/syslog), you would see error messages such as:\n[345695.334701] type=1400 audit(1462672575.673:72990): apparmor=\"DENIED\" operation=\"open\" profile=\"/usr/bin/evince\" name=\"/usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/tex-gyre/texgyreheros-regular.otf\" pid=31050 comm=\"EvJobScheduler\" requested_mask=\"r\" denied_mask=\"r\" fsuid=1000 ouid=0\n\nTo give Evince read access permissions to your TexLive fonts, you can add the following rule in the file /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.bin.evince:\n/usr/local/texlive/**/public/** r,\n\nSave the file and reload the rule by issuing (in a terminal):\nsudo service apparmor reload\n\nand quit any open instance of Evince. The next time you open your PDF file in Evince, it should display your PDF correctly, having access to the needed fonts.\n", "Q: .desktop file :line 1: [Desktop: command not found What is wrong with my .desktop file ???\nI wrote a simple c++ program for learning purposes and all is fine with this.

I do about 25-30 max on certain days. \n\n*I'm using Perl 5.18.2 to talk directly to the SMTP server, so I don't need an MTA. \n\n*On my Ubuntu VM, doing nslookup email.abc.com gives me a non-authoritative IP address of the correct IP for the new SMTP server, which is, say 60.1.2.3.\n\n\nThis Ubuntu VM runs on our network and I've been making reports and sending outbound email only via SMTPServer1 for a while now. SMTPServer1 has poor service so I'm changing SMTP servers to an SMTP server internal to our network, something our company runs. When I try to test my connection from Ubuntu to the new SMTP server, I telnet in to the name like this: telnet email.abc.com 2525 because we use a non-standard port for SMTP. \nWhat I get every time is \"Trying email.abc.com...\" and it just hangs there until I get  a timeout error. The same thing happens when I try to telnet directly to the IP address. The other guy running the new (to me) SMTP server claims it's open for my IP of the Ubuntu server and his SMTP server is running.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, what do I need to check? I'm on my own here, IT doesn't know anything about Ubuntu. \n\n*How do I set up my machine, and/or DNS, to access the new SMTP server? I already know how to set up my Perl program to do it, but my test is not working, hence my question. \n\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: I just added our internal DNS servers to /etc/network/interfaces. The first 2 entries for dns-nameservers are 10.19.* and they are our internal DNS servers. The next 2 entries are Google DNS servers, the last is a OpenDNS server. It now looks like this: \n\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them.

A file on my desktop as well as a file in my movies folder is not being deleted.\nI am 100% sure the problem isn't with the name of the file because I always use tab key to auto complete the name.\n\n\n\n\nA: the name of the file must contain a non-printing character i.e. a character that is not printed even if is there.\nyou should try this:\nls -b <your file> | xargs rm\n\nyou should get the full name of that file by typing the first few letters then pressing tab\n\nA: Open a terminal and type:\nrm or sudo rm remember this is for a file not a directory, if it's directory then rm -r, more detailed man rm.\nNow when you typed rm command just drag&drop that file to a terminal, it will also print/show you a complete and correct path to that file, out of it you can notice if you made any mistakes when providing a path to a file before. And then just hit Enter that's it.\nIf you still unable to delete it, follow this duplicated link.\n\nA: As you didn't do a 'ls -l ~/Desktop' it is hard to know what exactly is the problem. Would be nice if you could update your post with that.\nThe absolute simplest solution is to let the terminal find out the exact name itself by autocompletion. Genereally you just start to write the command and then hit the tab key.\nrm F[Tab-key]\n\nIt should then write out the whole name of the file. You might possibly have to press Tab twice for it to do that.\n\nA: I had the same problem as yours, only with a folder, not with a file. None of the methods suggested here worked.\nI managed to solve the problem by creating a folder in the same position and with the same name as the one I couldn't delete. The folder was created correctly and it \"replaced\" the non existing one. Then I simply removed the new folder and the issue was gone.

After changing it back to the physical MAC address of the network card, it works just fine.\nIt worked on Windows, so it can't be a problem with my router.\nPlease do not ask me why I want to spoof it, that won't help anyone.\nRunning Ubuntu MATE 15.04 connecting through WLAN.\n\nA: First, change everything back to default so that everything is in working order.\nNext, run the following commands to install macchanger; macchanger is a command line tool developed for the purpose of changing your mac address:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install macchanger\n\nYou may be asked if you want to run automatically. You can choose yes or no. \nFor testing purposes, I have selected no, however, you may find this option useful. There is no guarantee the real MAC address will not be leaked. This option can be changed or set by editing the file /etc/default/macchanger, setting to ENABLE_ON_POST_UP_DOWN=true or ENABLE_ON_POST_UP_DOWN=false . Again, for testing purposes here, I have this set to ENABLE_ON_POST_UP_DOWN=false.\n\nUsage:\nTo set the MAC address of wlan0 to 00:11:22:33:44:55, run the following commands:\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo macchanger --mac 00:11:22:33:44:55 wlan0\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nThen, to show the current MAC address:\nmacchanger -s wlan0\n\nFor a list of options:\nmacchanger -h\n\nAlso, you may want to look into the \"pretend to be a burned in address\" -bia option.\n\nFinally, I'm not sure how your IPV6 address will be impacted so that may be something you might want to pay attention to.\n\nSee also:\nman macchanger\n\nthe GUI version: macchanger-gtk\nand:\nanonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/macchanger.git\ngithub.com/alobbs/macchanger\nwww.gnu.org/software/macchanger\n", "Q: Files starting with a comment have the wrong mime type In Ubuntu 14.04 I have a directory with a set of LESS files, all with the .less extension. All but three of the files show a mime type of plain text document (text/plain) under Properties > Basic. The other three are reported as C source code (text/x-csrc) which means they have a different icon and more annoyingly, get opened with a different default application.\nI narrowed the problem down to the contents of the files. It seems any files that start with either a CSS comment block (/* Comment */) or a LESS inline comment (// Comment) have a mime type of text/x-csrc.\nI've tried editing the /etc/mime.types file to make the system aware of the extension. First I added less as an extension of text/css:\ntext/css                   css less\nThen I ran sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime on the command line but it didn't work, the files still had the wrong mime type so I tried adding it as an extension of text/plain in the same way but again, nothing. So I tried adding a new mime type:\ntext/less                  less\nI ran the update-mime-database command again but still no luck.\nHow can I get Ubuntu to handle the files based on their extension instead of their contents?\n\nA: Save the following as e.g. less.xml:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>\n  <mime-type type=\"text/x-less\">\n    <comment>LESS file</comment>\n    <glob pattern=\"*.less\"/>\n  </mime-type>\n</mime-info>\n\nThen open a Terminal and run\nxdg-mime install --novendor less.xml\n\nNow all files with the extension .less should have the MIME type text/x-less.\nSee Shared MIME-info Database if you want to learn more about how MIME types are defined.\n", "Q: trying to copy from root to user I mounted a folder inside my C drive to a root path of mnt/myFolder\nnow I am trying to copy the contents of that folder to /home/dev/build/mysource\nI used that command that was taught by my senior inside the folder that I want to copy but it is not working as the error I am getting is \n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\ncan you please help me understand why this is happening ?\nthis is my command:\n tar cvf - * : (cd /home/dev/build/mysource;

(I didn't find any answer to my question after having looked in a lot of posts)\nI'm currently deploying an Openstack private cloud.\n- I would like to run Solaris 11.2 (or OpenIndiana/similar) on my storage server and use ZFS for my block storage needs (= Cinder), maybe even for object storage ( Swift on ZFS)\n- I have an other server with lots of RAM/CPU & lots of NICs inside. I would like to use it as my Openstack controller node & network node.\n- I have 4 nodes in one 2U chassis that I want to use as Compute Nodes\nMy question is : Can I use MAAS & Juju to deploy on everything but the storage server, and then \"connect\" my charms to it even if the storage server is not \"listed\" in Juju (as it can't run Juju being Solaris based) ??\nRegards,\nY\n\nA: This would probably be more of a OpenStack charm question. With that said I do not think the charms (specifically cinder/swift) support connecting to an existing storage cluster.\nI recommend filing bugs for the services you're interested in incorporating existing infrastructure with a Juju deployment.\nCinder: https://bugs.launchpad.net/charms/+source/cinder\nSwift: https://bugs.launchpad.net/charms/+source/swift-proxy\n\nA: You can always do this kind of thing with Juju in the general case by writing a \"proxy charm\".\nThe job of a charm is to provide an implementation of a particular service in terms of defined relations and open ports. So you can always write a charm that implements the service by actually proxying to another service (in this case your manually deployed Solaris-based storage node).\nThe charm would set relation data to point consumers (at the other end of its relations) to the real service instead. Usually the private-address relation setting is configured by default, but your charm can always override it by setting it directly to point it to the real service in this way.\nI don't know whether such a thing would best be incorporated into the existing Swift and Cinder charms, or you would be better writing your own replacement charms. So filing bugs as @gangstaluv suggests for the former case is probably still a good idea.\nBut the point of my answer is that yes, you can always do this by the nature of Juju's architecture.\n", "Q: Root CA certs - exporting from Windows, importing into Ubuntu I'm behind a corporate proxy, and we have Windows PCs with root ca certs pre-installed so SSL works with the proxy. Within my PC, I'm spinning up Linux VMs for testing, and so I have a need to get those certs installed within the VM so I can hit whatever SSL URL I need (github cloning etc). I've tried a few methods to export the certs from Windows and import them into Ubuntu, but as of yet I am unable to access SSL from within the VM.\nThis answer gave me the best idea for what format to export the cert in from Windows (base-64 .cer). After I export the .cer files and copy them into place in the VM, I rename them with .crt extensions.\nThis answer best sums up what I'm trying in the VM.\nAfter I add the certs to the usr/share/ca-certificates directory and run update-ca-certificates the certs do get symlinked into /etc/ssl/certs but still no SSL traffic.\nThis is on a Windows 7 host, Ubuntu 12.04 guest.\n\nA: Necro-posting, but in case someone else encounters this:\nThe answer (seems to be) that Firefox uses a different certificate store mechanism, so you should add it to the user-specific firefox profile. (Can use the firefox GUI)\nSee Add certificate authorities system-wide on Firefox\n\nThe problem here is that Firefox does not have a 'central' location where it looks for certificates. It just looks into the current profile. That's why modifying /usr/share/ca-certificates or other similar directories won't work with Firefox. This is something that has been requested for years; see issues 620373, 449498 and 454036 (and probably there are many others).\n\nSo you are left with just two kind of solutions: either modify each profile, or modify the behaviour of Firefox. I know this is not what you are looking for, but there are no ways because Firefox only looks at users' profiles.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.2 Handbrake 0.10.2 I like to make some copies from my DVD else I'm afraid my kids could destroy them they sometimes play with them and when it comes to scratches....

I have been trying to run it so I can communicate with a robot through USB. However, the system runs slow and lags the signal, even though the VM has 2 GB of memory.\nMy computer has a core i7 4th gen, 8 GB of ram and 1TB HDD. My windows system runs normally, but nothing but Chrome and excel is open on it and the windows side runs fine. \nAny ideas about what might be causing this issue? Thank you for your time.\n\nA: Most BIOS and CPUs now have 'Virtualization Technology' of some sort.  Depending on the manufacturer, this may be called VT-x, or AMD-v.  You should first determine if these can be enabled within your BIOS, and then, if they were available, enable them within the BIOS and then within your Virtual Machine's settings within VirtualBox.\nAnother thing that will improve performance is to install the Guest Partitions for VirtualBox.  This should give you better access to hardware, including USB and Graphics Cards, etc.\nAlso, while 2GB or RAM might be plenty for your VM, you might try increasing it to 4GB, or ensuring proper SWAP is available.  Also, since you're on an i7, you could probably give the VM at least two cores on which to run.\nYou may want to take a look at Oracle's Documentation covering USB issues, as well as checking Enable USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller under USB in the Virtual Machine's settings.\nA side note is that I've never run VirtualBox under Windows to run Linux.  I've always used a Linux host with VirtualBox to run Windows.  Linux seems to be better at handling virtualization than Windows, but these suggestions should help you a bit.\n", "Q: Ubuntu PPTP VPN to Buffalo Router VPN, With my Windows laptop, I would connect via PPTP VPN, it worked fine.

I already ran the script to install the fonts into ~/.fonts but when editing the konsole profile, I see a very limited number of fonts, none of which are the ones I installed patch for powerline.\nHow would I use these fonts in Konsole in KDE5?\n\nA: there is a bug that the ubuntu system think the patched fonts are not mono. So you cannot see that font in any terminal application's setting, even in gnome-terminal. But as for konsole, we can directly edit the ~/.local/share/konsole/*.profile file.

I observed a strange behaviour on my new XUbuntu installation.\n==== Background:\nI had the intention of experimenting two different remote desktop solutions (one at a time); the local computer (display/keyboard/mouse) had to be a Windows machine, the remote computer (apps) had to be XUbuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*VNC\n\n*remote X Server (XMing on Windows + XDMCP on XUbuntu)\nI am an (old) newbie, and I was planning to experiment without SSH tunneling, behind my modem/router, for sake of simplicity in the beginning; to add SSH (and enforce tunneling) later, before opening an access from the general Internet.\nI could not find any simple recipe on the web (many throwing inside SSH from the beginning, none specifically addressed to lightdm)\n=== What I did:\nI defined my fresh XUbuntu installation for one user without the need of logging in; and this was working normally. Via the GUI I added a second user (with the vague idea it could help soon or later). As first experiment I copied the file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf to /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.my, edited the copy, ensured the two files had same owner/group and access right and then \"renamed\" (mv) /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf to /etc/lightdm.conf.orig and /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.my to /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf. \nI did so to avoid to alter the original file. Rebooted the system. System did not reach the graphic run level. It was anyway possible to login in text mode. Tried startx.\nI can't remember exactly what happened then. Anyway I was not happy and I tried to go back: renamed the files in the opposite direction in order to revert to the original setup. Reboot.\n==== What I got:\nThe system was not restored to its original behaviour. It was displaying the graphic login window (this was not the original behaviour). Anyway the user proposed at login was correct. I Typed the password. After some seconds the graphic login reappeared without any error message. With control-alt-F1 I got the textual login again, and there I was able to login (with the same username/password \"failed\" in the graphic login). Tried this again (reboot / graphic login) with same result. Rechecked the mentioned configuration files.\n==== Question:\nWhat could have happened to change the System behavior, even if I restored the previous configuration files?

I have 6 gigs of ram .how do go about installing it and partitioning it properly without using up to much space for partitioning and to make my SSD work nicely cos its been said that'it is faster then your normal hardrive. And I previously had Windows 7\n\nA: The instructions for installing Ubuntu onto an SSD are no different than for a traditional hard drive.  The default partitioning recommended by the installer will be suitable.\nThe speed benefits of an SSD do not require special configuration of the OS.\nIt wasn't a main part of your question, but you are going to run into difficulties getting Photoshop and After Effects running on Ubuntu (with Wine).  After Effects in particular probably won't work at all if you have version 9 or later (CS4 or later) (source).\nAdobe Photoshop CS5 won't run, and Adobe Premiere Pro beyond version CS3 won't run.

I have a Microsoft Surface RT tablet that I want to use as a second monitor for my Ubuntu laptop using Splashtop Remote Desktop as in this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldb0RvmXzsA\nSo far, I can get the tablet to mirror the display on my laptop, but not to extend it.\nI think it could work in theory, if only I could trick the laptop into creating a second \"virtual\" desktop, even though I don't have a second monitor hooked up. There seems to be a feature for this in Windows, but is there a way to do it in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Maybe try going to your 'Displays' from the GNOME launcher, there should maybe a button saying 'Detect Displays' then you should have some options like 'Mirror Display', simply check or uncheck this. The settings may vary from distribution to distribution. I am not 100% sure if this will work as I am not familiar with the software suite you are using.

Run the following commands to install:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install acpi-support acpid acpi acpitool libacpi0\n\nA reboot may also be necessary.\nAs you can see in this loosly related example, typically, when ACPI is disabled, the computer will halt but will not shut down when ACPI support is needed.\n", "Q: How to make a custom snapshot of non-system related stuff and be able to restore without reboot?

Then if it happens I did a mess, I can easily restore to a given snapshot point.\nI'm looking for a solution besides git and alike tools.\nI also wonder if that tool can remember previous state of MySQL database, otherwise I will just have a dump of it at some point.\n\nA: What you need is LVM.  This is a disk abstraction layer unlike the partitions you've been using until now and actually replaces them.\nLVM has built-in snapshots which allows you to freeze an existing Logical Volume in time, at any moment, even while the system is running. You can continue to use the original volume normally, but the snapshot volume appears to be an image of the original, frozen in time at the moment you created it. You can use this to get a consistent filesystem image to back up, without shutting down the system. You can also use it to save the state of the system, so that you can later return to that state if you mess things up. You can even mount the snapshot volume and make changes to it, without affecting the original. \n\nA: Have you tried snapper?\nsudo apt-get snapper\n\nmanpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/snapper.8.html\nI haven't tried it but it looks promising\n", "Q: Make ubuntu server/router part of wifi connections So I have configured my ubuntu server to be router with dhcp functionalities and I want it to appear on other computers or devices as a choice for a network connection. My ubuntu router is currently connected to a wireless router which provides internet but I want it in a such a way that the ubuntu router is among the list of network connections to be chosen from. How do I do this?\n\nA: Plug the output of the Ubuntu box into the input of the wireless router. \nConsider the wireless router's broadcasted network a broadcast of the Ubuntu box as any connections made to that network will be served by the Ubuntu computer. \nAlso, many wireless routers offer the option of either serving DHCP within the network or having DHCP handled outside the router itself so if you have this option, you will have the option to allow the Ubuntu box to serve DHCP as well.\n", "Q: How to figure out what is causing CPU usage to spike to 100 For the last few weeks, CPU usage on my computer will spike to nearly 100%, which makes the computer unusable.

I think that upgrade would make the system more stable, more better and more secure, but actually it made more problems...\nThese behaviours had caused many many bugs so that I had spent lots of time debugging or reinstalling my system. For examples, broken grub, broken wifi driver, broken nvidia driver, broken DNS resolver... etc.\nAnd recently, I have figured it out.\nMy opinion is not never doing upgrade. The reason why I always got lots of bugs is that apt-get upgrade will upgrade a lots of packages you do not know. If one of these packages do something wrong, there would cause some bugs.\nThe more packages you upgrade, the more risk your system would encounter. So my solution would be always upgrade specific packages you want to upgrade by doing so:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get --only-upgrade install <packages name>\nAnd when you want to do sudo apt-get upgrade, it takes risks.\nIf the system go well, lucky.\nIf not, debug or reinstall.\nBut how about security update, is it still safe?\nIn the Software & Updates, Updates section, if you choose security updates as the options \"Download and install automatically\", /usr/bin/unattended-upgrade would handle the security update automatically.\nYou can check by\nless /var/log/apt/history.log\n\nA: apt-get update\n\nRefreshes the repositories and fetches information about packages that are available online.\napt-get upgrade\n\nDownloads and installs updates for all installed packages - as long as it doesn't bother dependencies (install new packages, remove old ones or crosses a repo source (switch a package from one repo to another)).\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nDoes the same as \"upgrade\" but upgrades a package also when dependencies or sources are changed (something you want to avoid on servers without further testing).\nTo conclude - an update can break things but it is necessary!\nSo if you are on a desktop you should normally do a: \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nWithout destroying something.\nOn a server most of the times a: \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nshould be enough AND security updates should be installed automatically (on servers and desktops)\nUpdate to 16.04\nMeanwhile the \"apt\" wrapper is the standard way in Ubuntu, so the commands are now:\nsudo apt update        #to update the repo-information\n\nsudo apt upgrade       #to install all security fixes and changes that doesn't harm the system or change the behaviour\n\nsudo apt full-upgrade  #the new \"dist-upgrade\" that installs newer versions that can break backwards-compatibility\n\nTL;DR!\nYes, you should update PHP in this example because it is a security fix (this can be seen through the versioning scheme of PHP; it also wouldn't have been pushed into the \"upgrade\" channel of Ubuntu.)\n\nA: Maybe. But you should regularly update your system. Updates can have risk, yes. This risk also depends on things I do not know such as what PPAs you may or may not have added or other sources. But again in general it's a good idea to keep you system up to date. When you update, you get stability fixes and security updates. So I will say that it is even more dangerous not to update(upgrade) your system.\n\nA: When you run apt-get upgradeit updates all installed packages on your system.\nIt is perfectly safe (unless you cut it off before it finishes) as all packages are from the repos (you should only install one's you trust) and are (probably) well tested before uploading.\nThe only small risk is a risk of bugs within the packages there self, but this could happen to any thing on any OS that was upgraded as bugs are common in any software and come and go based on version.\nShould you upgrade ? Well thats up to you, I would say yes, if you don't like upgrade use the application-updater app, same thing no output to make you worried.\nHere is some documentation for apt so you can find out more\n\nA: As a supplement to other more complete answers, here is a corner case in which apt-get upgrade can be dangerous (I got caught in this myself):\nWhen running Docker containers, apt-get upgrade will shut down all of them down.\nThis could cause:\n\n*\n\n*service disruption\n\n*loss of data (if you have --rm in your docker run command for example, and have some data you value in the container itself and not mounted somewhere properly).\n\n\nA: sudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This only updates all your Installed Softwares.\n\n*This is Also Necessary when you Installed OS for the first time.. As it firstly needs Update, then only Enables you to use the Installed Softwares..\n\n\nEdit:\nAnd Upgrade is Used to Upgrade the packages which were not installed correctly..\n\nA: Sometimes you may have a broken system, when you add third party PPA on your repository , after updating it sudo apt-get update.\nIt is not dangerous and actually you should do this to keep your system up-to-date. One suggestion from me though, just uncheck proposed and backports repository from software sources.\n", "Q: I can't install Winusb?

Is it advisable also a fresh install from time to time?\n\nA: With every fresh install, you need to figure out how to install all the packages that you use. And how did you fix all the little issues and tuning.\nSo, on every fresh install/fix/tuning, I try to write all the steps down, almost like a bash script, in a textfile that I save on Dropbox. So I can manually replay everything on a new installation\nDisadvantage: tuning everything again for your wishes\nAdvantage: clean system, extra space, backup+lose what you don't use anyway, rearrange your filesystem, ... for some, having fun figuring everything out.\n\nA: In the past, Linux has been used primarily for servers, mainframe computers, and supercomputers, but Ubuntu is designed to be a user-friendly Linux distribution for everyone. Requiring users to do frequent fresh installs would be bothersome to some users, so Long Term Support releases of Ubuntu are released every two years and supported by updates for a period of five years after the launch date (April 2012, April 2014, etc.). Usually there is no point in doing a fresh install as long as you can continue to receive updates from the Software Updater.\n\nA: I have two 20GB partitions which I use for \"/\" ,\none partition for \"swap\" and one for \"/home\"\nWhenever I feel the need to try out a new version I make a fresh install to the other 20GB \"/\" (I choose \"something different\" in the install routine so I can tell the installer that I want to use my old \"/home\" and I certainly don't want to format it!)\nCaveats are: different User and Group Id's and encrypted \"/home\" (you will need the key)\nThis leaves me in on the safe side to try things out, configuration files are still there (personal in \"/home\" system wide on the old \"/\" from where you can retrieve them)\nI began doing this as sometimes the upgrade routine left me stranded with a defunct system.\n", "Q: What have i missed that i need to run Redshift Plasmoid?

Do not call System 5 rc scripts directly, especially on a system where System 5 rc isn't used, such as Ubuntu version 15.\nCalling them indirectly via the service command is wrong in the case of OpenVPN, too.\nOpenVPN is a templatized service under systemd.  The services are named openvpn@config.service.  So you should be starting your /etc/openvpn/myvpn.conf instance with systemctl start openvpn@myvpn.service\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/206490/5132\n\n*http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Openvpn\n", "Q: A new SSD with copied partitions and UEFI dual bootable I got DELL Inspiron 5521 notebook with 1Tb spinning drive /dev/sda which holds several partitions, Win7 among them on /dev/sda5 and Ubuntu root partition on /dev/sda7. It is dual EFI bootable.\nToday I replaced a DVD drive with new 120 Gb SSD.\nSi, I need to move linux from /dev/sda7 (root) and /dev/sda8 (home) to /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb2 respectively.\nShall I create a new EFI partition on /dev/sdb to add Ubuntu booting option?\nCan I copy ubuntu partitions as I don't like the idea to install it and setup again?\n\nA: I would set up the new disk with an EFI partition.  It wont take up much space, and gives you the ability to easily move the disk without having to change existing parition sizes to add an ESP later.  I would use the --removable on the grub-install to put a copy of the grubx64.efi bootloader into /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi. (If you are using secure boot, you theoritically should use --uefi-secure-boot, but last time I tried it, that did nothing, instead of putting shimx64.efi in /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi and a copy of grubx64.efi. So you'll still have to manually copy in the correct files).  \nYour other potential problem is the disk caddy.  Grub may have problems when the caddy is present -- like freezing for a minute, or maybe indefinitely.  This may occur even if the caddy is not used for boot.  A workaround is to have a device like USB you can put earlier in the boot order than the hard disks, but you might still not be able to reference the caddy until you boot, so good luck.  The caddy will still be usable as a storage device.  \nSee the comment about moving the files.  Nothing special for an \nSDD in a caddy.\n", "Q: Cups missing /etc/init.d/cups and cannot be updated cups package wants to be updated, but the /etc/init.d/cups was deleted before. now we cannot install it. \nroot@server:~# touch /etc/init.d/cups\nroot@server:~# env LC_MESSAGES=EN apt-get dist-upgrade\nReading package lists...

(I deleted all the other available network connections in the area, as well as previously saved connections in that text file)\nI've had Ubuntu 14.04 on this laptop for a while, and had previously had some difficulty connecting to the network at school, but had usually blamed that on the school wifi itself, since it was highly location dependent. I'm travelling in Brazil at the moment and have managed to occasionally successfully connect to my host's network. My Android phone has no trouble connecting (I'm writing this by tethering my computer through USB to my phone). Most of the time the computer just attempts to connect, then either asks me to reenter the password, and then stays disconnected. \n\nA: There are a couple of things you can do that help when connecting to unresponsive networks.\nFirst, increase your retry from a conservative 7 up to somewhere between 10 or 14. Run the following command in a terminal. Assuming your wireless device is wlan0:\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 retry 12\n\nor for wlan1:\nsudo iwconfig wlan1 retry 12\n\nThen refresh network-manager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nNext, make sure you have ports 67 and 68 open for DHCP traffic and ports 52 and 53 for DNS. There are many ways to accomplish this. For testing purposes, you can disable the firewall using the following command:\nsudo ufw disable\n\nYou can use ufw to open these ports.

Please be aware that using the wrong regulatory code may result in fines or punishment so only use the proper code that corresponds to the country or nation the computer is currently bieng used in and if you leave the country, you MUST change the code accordingly or use the default world regulatory domain instead which is legal and valid in all nations and countries.\nFor use inside Brazil ONLY!! execute the following command to apply local wireless restrictions:\nsudo iw reg set BR\n\nTo make this setting permanent, you can set the regulatory domain in your /etc/default/crda file by running the following command. Again, this is for Brazil ONLY:\nsudo sed -i 's/REGDOMAIN=/REGDOMAIN=BR/g' /etc/default/crda \n\nFinally, if you ever leave the country and need to change this back to the default world regulatory domain, run the following command and then reboot:\nsudo sed -i 's/REGDOMAIN=BR/REGDOMAIN=/g' /etc/default/crda\n\nClick here for a list of codes used for other countries (US, for example, is used for United States).\n", "Q: Windows 8 boot info lost after ubuntu installation There were some similar questions but I really didn't understand.\nI'm new to Linux and Ubuntu!\nI had 4 drives:\nC: NTFS (For Windows 8)\nD: EXT4 (For Ubuntu)\nE: NTFS (Persoanl Storgae)\nF: NTFS (Persoanl Storage)\n\nI had Windows 8, Then I installed Ubuntu 15, Now my computer only boot Ubuntu, What should I do to restore Windows 8 boot.\nWhen I installed Ubuntu, I deleted the D: drive then it became free space, then I add partition in installation page, then I set it as / and EXT4 and the drive for installation.\n\nA: if you're using grub but it's not detecting windows try:\nsudo update-grub\n\nresult will be like:\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.19.0-21-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.19.0-21-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.19.0-18-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.19.0-18-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.19.0-16-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.19.0-16-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-38-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.16.0-38-generic\nFound memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.elf\nFound memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin\nFound Windows 8 (loader) on /dev/sda1\ndone\n\nif you spot your loader in there then it's working\n", "Q: Kernel upgrade lubuntu 14.04 How often does system upgrades the kernel?

Security fixes are applied and pushed out through Apt.\nMaintaining software rather than just upgrading everything  is a feature of Ubuntu. \nThat said, if you really need a later version, there are options:\n\n\n*\n\n*LTS releases can hop to the non-LTS versions of the kernel by installing the HWE stacks. You're actually already using one of these (they come bundled in the LTS point releases) but you can upgrade to the Vivid version by installing linux-generic-lts-vivid. See more about this.\n\n*\"The Kernel PPA\" isn't a PPA in the sense of Launchpad-hosted, Apt-compatible PPAs. It's just a file-dump of built kernel packages. You can browse it here.\nNote: These do not have Ubuntu patches applied and your system will not automatically upgrade if and when security-patched versions are made available. You will have to upgrade manually.\n\n*Build it yourself. It isn't hard; it just looks hard. As above, you're in charge of keeping on top of security advisories and applying updates.\nBut yeah, if you're happy on 3.16, stay on 3.16.\n", "Q: I am trying to install Steam on ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit Some packages could not be installed.

Synaptic can be searched for specific drivers, and driver packages, some of which will support wifi devices not ordinarily supported by Ubuntu.\nIn your case however I'm going to go out on a limb and GUESS you were using Ubuntu 14.04 which has been \"persnickity\" about wifi support.  \n", "Q: Is my opinion right or wrong ? ( hardware acceleration ) I always thought/think that hardware acceleration is bad because if you for normal/smooth playback of video must in player turn on the hardware acceleration it means that your CPU is weak. So if I in Vlc or any any other player must use hardware acceleration(on Ubuntu VDPAU for Nvidia) that means to me tha my CPU is to weak.So is my opinion right or wrong? the same goes if I in any player must change some other setting for normal playback. Am I wrong? do i need change my opinion?\n\nA: Hardware acceleration is the use of computer hardware to perform some functions faster than is possible in software running on a more general-purpose CPU. Examples of hardware acceleration include blitting acceleration functionality in graphics processing units (GPUs).\nThe main difference between hardware and software is concurrency, allowing hardware to be much faster than software. Hardware accelerators are designed for computationally intensive software code. Depending upon granularity, hardware acceleration can vary from a small functional unit to a large functional block (like motion estimation in MPEG-2).\nSource Wikipedia\n", "Q: AppArmor Error: \"invalid VM definition\" after starting lxc on updated version of libvirt (1.2.12) I am trying to start an LXC on a newer version of libvirtd but it fails to start with the following error:\n$ virsh -c lxc: start textlxc\nerror: Failed to start domain testlxc\nerror: internal error: cannot load AppArmor profile 'libvirt-dfb2c573-05cb-4ca3-9e46-bea6cebf0f9f'\n\nError message in /var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log \n2015-06-23 12:13:12.306+0000: 14141: error : virCommandWait:2532 : internal error: Child process (/usr/lib/libvirt/virt-aa-helper -p 0 -c -u libvirt-dfb2c573-05cb-4ca3-9e46-bea6cebf0f9f) unexpected exit status 1: virt-aa-helper: error: /proc/meminfo\nvirt-aa-helper: error: skipped restricted file\nvirt-aa-helper: error: invalid VM definition\n\n2015-06-23 12:13:12.306+0000: 14141: error : AppArmorGenSecurityLabel:468 : internal error: cannot load AppArmor profile 'libvirt-dfb2c573-05cb-4ca3-9e46-bea6cebf0f9f'\n\nThis is my testlxc.xml file\n<domain type='lxc'>\n  <name>testlxc</name>\n  <uuid>dfb2c573-05cb-4ca3-9e46-bea6cebf0f9f</uuid>\n  <memory unit='KiB'>4048292</memory>\n  <currentMemory unit='KiB'>4048292</currentMemory>\n  <vcpu placement='static'>2</vcpu>\n  <resource>\n    <partition>/machine</partition>\n  </resource>\n  <os>\n    <type arch='x86_64'>exe</type>\n    <init>/sbin/init</init>\n  </os>\n  <clock offset='utc'/>\n  <on_poweroff>destroy</on_poweroff>\n  <on_reboot>restart</on_reboot>\n  <on_crash>destroy</on_crash>\n  <devices>\n    <emulator>/usr/lib/libvirt/libvirt_lxc</emulator>\n    <filesystem type='mount' accessmode='passthrough'>\n      <source dir='/var/lib/libvirt/filesystems/testlxc'/>\n      <target dir='/'/>\n    </filesystem>\n    <filesystem type='mount' accessmode='passthrough'>\n      <source dir='/var/lib/libvirt/filesystems/testlxc-data'/>\n      <target dir='/mnt/data'/>\n    </filesystem>\n    <filesystem type='mount' accessmode='passthrough'>\n      <source dir='/var/run/testlxc/lxc'/>\n      <target dir='/mnt/run'/>\n    </filesystem>\n    <filesystem type='mount' accessmode='passthrough'>\n      <source dir='/proc/meminfo'/>\n      <target dir='/proc/meminfo'/>\n    </filesystem>\n    <console type='pty' tty='/dev/pts/1'>\n      <source path='/dev/pts/1'/>\n      <target type='lxc' port='0'/>\n      <alias name='console0'/>\n    </console>\n  </devices>\n</domain>\n\nLibvirt version running is 1.2.12, I had been running the lxc succesfully on version 1.2.2 before. \n$ libvirtd --version\nlibvirtd (libvirt) 1.2.12\n\n\nA: I have tracked down the problem to domain XML validation in virt-aa-helper utility.

This would be easy to do if I could get a USB serial adapter to work.\nI have an on-the-go USB cable and can plug in a USB memory stick and it will work as expected. So far so good.\nI have tried plugging in a standard Aten USB/Serial adapter and I see a usbdev1.x device appearing in /dev/, but no /dev/serial and /dev/ttyUSB0 as I get when I plug it into a regular Debian machine.\nLikewise, plugging in an Arduino Nano (which uses a Future Devices USB UART) works as far as: The Nano gets power and a /dev/usbdev1.x device appears - but no /dev/serial and no /dev/ttyUSB0.\nNo messages appear in /var/log/syslog other than \"a USB device was connected\".\nWhat am I missing ? Is it \"just\" the USB serial module ? And then - how to install it ?\nThe phone is running Ubuntu Touch 15.04 (r23).\n\nA: Thanks to ubuntu to get that functionality you will have to recompile the kernel. If you are still interested read bellow :)\nAll of usb serial adapters are by default disabled in any UT kernel. (thank you ubuntu for being so un-cool) [sarcasm on] as you are supposed to use this device only for socio* webapps (tweet, fazebook, stare to UT calendar) and do not dare to do anything cool [sarcasm off]. Look to the source of the kernel https://github.com/bq/aquaris-E4.5/tree/aquaris-E4.5/\nchange the configure file to enable your USB UART device and then crosscompile it (I think the best up to date instruction is this how to do that: https://sturmflut.github.io/ubuntu/bq/2015/07/02/hacking-the-bq-part-4-building-and-booting-a-kernel/)\nYou should add the line for supporting your own USB UART device in the step 3 described in the above linked tutorial. To know the exact sting to write it is good to see mainline default kernel (3.4) tree, and add the appropriate line. Or look bellow....\nThe E.5 source tree is such a mess, and I could not find exact defconfigs for this device, however I am familiar with defconfigs of bq M10 (Caveat it is kernel 3.10 instead of 3.4 as on E4.5, some device drivers can be unavaliable in 3.4 tree), I provide the excerpt with it bellow.

This default setup makes impossible to use the tablets/phones with UT for anything other than reading mails, tweeting, stairing to UT calendar and calculating 1+1.

Check:\ncat /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades | grep -i prompt\n\nit should print like:\n# Default prompting behavior, valid options:\nPrompt=lts\n\nThat means it prompted to upgrade to LTS versions but not the Development ones. If you want to upgrade to Development version of Ubuntu:\nsudo nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\n\nThen substitute:\nPrompt=lts\n\nto\nPrompt=normal\n\nThen save and exit. Run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo do-release-upgrade -c -d\n\n\nA: 14.04 is a Long term support (LTS). By default it will just upgrade to the next LTS release (which will be 16.04). To upgrade to a non-LTS release, you have to open the software update properties. On the tab with the notification settings there is a drop down selection at the bottom. Set it to any release, then it should find 14.10. Also since you are using a desktop, I suggest you use the update-manager GUI instead of the do-release-upgrade CLI application.\n\nA: This is caused by a setting that's automatically set if you install an LTS release fresh, instead of upgrading to it.\nTo change this, simply open up the Unity dash (Ubuntu logo in the upper-left-hand corner), and search for Software.\nThat should bring up a list of applications like this (different icons of course, I'm using the Numix Circle icon theme. The text will be the same):\n\nSelect the icon titled Software & Updates.\nThis will open up a window that looks something like this:\n\nThen, you'll want to click the Updates tab:\n\nFinally, change the Notify me of a new Ubuntu version option to be For any new version:\n\nThat's it! Now you can now upgrade via the Software Updater GUI or via do-release-upgrade!\n", "Q: Annoying popup wifi password in 15.04 Always I log into Ubuntu 15.04 and my wifi network (HP-LASERJET) is in range it wants a password from me, despite I always save it.

I realize it is probably already checked, but maybe there is a way to make it apply the saved password automatically.

In Ubuntu 14.04 (and Linux Mint 17, which I uses the 14.04 scripts), /etc/bash.bashrc has the following function:\nif [ -x /usr/lib/command-not-found ]; then\n    function command_not_found_handle {\n        # check because c-n-f could've been removed in the meantime\n        if [ -x /usr/lib/command-not-found ]; then\n            /usr/bin/python /usr/lib/command-not-found -- $1\n            return $?\n        else\n           return 127\n        fi\n    }\nfi\n\nHowever, /usr/lib/command-not-found has been rewritten for Python 3. It handles the /etc/bash.bashrc command with:\nif sys.version < '3':                                                       \n    # We might end up being executed with Python 2 due to an old            \n    # /etc/bash.bashrc.                                                     \n    import os                                                               \n    if \"COMMAND_NOT_FOUND_FORCE_PYTHON2\" not in os.environ:                 \n        os.execvp(\"python3\", [sys.argv[0]] + sys.argv)\n\nThis calls \"python3\" from the path rather than giving the direct path. To correct this, line 22 of /usr/lib/command-not-found should be changed from\nos.execvp(\"python3\", [sys.argv[0]] + sys.argv)\n\nto\nos.execv(\"/usr/bin/python3\", [sys.argv[0]] + sys.argv)\n\nThis appears to be a bug with Ubuntu rather than Anaconda. I will check to see if it appears in later distributions.\n\nA: My problem was a bit different:\nAs one user, I could run python, but as another user, not (I got the same error as OP). Finally, I found out that the permissions and ownership of /usr/lib/python3.5 were screwed. The reason for this was that I had recursively set the permissions and ownership on virtualenv, which ended up in modifying the symlink targets (targetin /usr/lib/python3.5) as well.\nTip: Use strace python to figure out what's going on during Python startup. When I used strace, I could clearly see PERMISSION_DENIED on /usr/lib/python3.5.\n\nA: After having installed python3 in the standard locations and realizing I needed sudo to use it, I installed locally using this in my home directory:\npython3 -m venv env_py3\nsource env_py3/bin/activate\n\nBut had more errors. Simply unsetting PYTHONPATH on AWS's Amazon Linux instance worked just great for me.\n\nA: I would recommend unsetting PYTHONPATH. It is generally not needed, and it causes things to break like this by making one Python load things from another Python (in this case, it looks like the system's Python 3 is trying to load something that was written for Python 2). \n\nA: This worked for me\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/39097003/823282\nrm -rf venv\nvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv/\nsource venv/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nA: Yet another answer: I lazily copied my entire ~/.virtualenvs directory from an  old machine, and that old machine had 3.6 installed, so when my python3 environments were all created with some command like mkvirtualenv --python=$( which python3 ), they got 3.6.

A value of ignoredups causes lines  matching  the  previous  history\n          entry  to not be saved.  A value of ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and ignoredups.

It should work fine.\n\n\n(There is also a more complex method available which involves chrooting into your system, but I personally prefer this one.)\nThis should work. Just ask if you need any more help :)\n\nA: To recover Grub (I'm supposing this is the original bootloader)\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot through Fedora DVD or Red Hat DVD of Mandriva , not Ubuntu\n\n*Select Troubleshooting and then select Rescue installed system option\n\n*To the question \"Do you want to start the networking\" say no.\nOnce you get to the shell enter the following three commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*$chroot /mnt/sysimage \n\n*$cd /boot\n\n*$grub-install /dev/sda\n\n\nAnd you have your bootloader back ;-)\nTaken from http://www.wikihow.com/Restore-Linux-Grub-After-Installing-Windows\n", "Q: Are there still issues with re-logging after desktop lock in Ubuntu 15.04? Following my previous question in the subject and since no solution has been found:\nI was wondering if there are any users of Ubuntu 15.04 which are experiencing this issue?\n\nA: I have encountered this problem in both 12.04 and 14.04 following an update.  Further updates appeared to fix the problem.  I recommend you run update a few times.  In the meantime I discovered a stop-gap measure which appears to work.  When this happens, select \"log in as other user\" (select other user) and then log in as the same user.

I need a command which would provide a file which looks like this:\n3 5 7 9 19 20 \n000010\n100001\n111001\n\n\nA: Try this with bash:\ncat k.txt <(echo) h.txt > new.txt\n\n\nA: Using sed:\nsed '/^/ r h.txt' k.txt\n\nor better (thx @steeldriver)\nsed '$a\\' k.txt h.txt\n\n\nUsing ed:\n(echo \"0a\"; cat k.txt; echo \".\"; echo \"wq\") | ed -s h.txt\n\nand for the missing newline in k.txt:\n(echo \"0a\"; cat k.txt; echo \"\"; echo \".\"; echo \"wq\") | ed -s h.txt\n\nor if you need a separate output file:\n(echo \"0a\"; cat k.txt; echo \"\"; echo \".\"; echo \"w out.txt\"; echo \"q\") | ed -s h.txt\n\n\nA: That's the job for paste:\npaste -sd'\\n' file1 file2\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-s make paste concatenate all of the lines of each file in command line order.\n\n*-d'\\n' make paste used newline as delimiter.\n\n\nA: Realizing that  the file1 might not contain the newline, why not simply add the newline by yourself ? (cat file1.txt; printf \"\\n\"; cat file2.txt ) > out.txt. Alternative way to do this, would be printf \"\\n\" | cat file1.txt - file2.txt\n\nA: If, as steeldriver suggests, your files don't end with a newline, you could try:\nawk '{print}' k.txt h.txt > newfile\n\nor, if you like golfing\nawk 1 k.txt h.txt > newfile\n\nor\nperl -lne 'print' k.txt h.txt \n\nor\n( cat k.txt ; echo \"\"; cat h.txt; echo ) > newfile\n\nor\necho \"$(cat k.txt)\"; echo \"$(cat h.txt)\"\n\n\nA: Nobody has mentioned python yet.

I have Ubuntu on my machine and I am running awesome window manager on top of it. How do I check which terminal I am running? Is there a command for it?\n\nA: TL;DR\n\n\n*\n\n*to find currently running shell use ls -l /proc/$$/exe\n\n*to find currently running terminal, use xprop _NET_WM_PID WM_CLASS. The value of pid later can be passed to ps -p <pid> -o args command.\n\n*Technically, for terminal emulator you don't even need a command, as stated in the comments:\n\nwhat do you mean by which? Click Help --> About is that it? – JoKeR\n\nShell vs Terminal\nFirst thing we need to have clarified is what exactly is being asked - find out the running shell or running terminal. Often these two terms are used interchangeably, but they are different things altogether. Shell is the command-line interpreter, specifically interactive shell is the prompt plus text field where you enter commands. Shells can also be non-interactive, for example a script starts non-interactive shell, or bash -c 'echo hello world' also starts non-interactive shell.\nBy contrast, terminal is the interface to shell ( though it could be another application as well). Originally terminal referred to actual hardware, but nowadays they're mostly software. What you see when you press Ctrl+Alt+t or click on the terminal icon in GUI, that starts a terminal emulator, a window which mimics behavior of hardware, and within that window you can see the shell running. Ctrl+Alt+F2 (or any of the 6 function keys) will open virtual console, aka tty. I recommend reading Why is a virtual terminal “virtual”, and what/why/where is the “real” terminal? for more info on the specifics.\nGetting the shell information\nEach user has a default shell assigned to them in /etc/passwd for their username. Assuming you are using default configuration and haven't called another shell explicitly as a command, it is sufficient to do:\necho $SHELL\n\nBut of course this only shows default value. Suppose we do the following:\nuser@ubuntu:~$ dash\n$\n\nWe were originally in bash, but started interactive session of /bin/dash, Ubuntu's POSIX or system shell. The variable $SHELL won't change,  because that's not its purpose - it shows default not current value. We will need to approach this from another perspective - the perspective of a process, which is something I've covered in Am I using bash or sh?\n$ echo $$\n4824\n$ cat /proc/4824/comm                                                          \nmksh\n$ bash\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ echo $$\n6197\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ cat /proc/6197/comm\nbash\n\nHere we take advantage of /proc/ filesystem. The name of the process and command-line parameters are displayed in /proc/<pid>/comm. All we need is to provide shell's PID, which is what $$ does. In the example above I am adding that separately, but there is nothing stopping us from doing just   \ncat /proc/$$/comm\n\nVariation on the theme could also be\nps -p $$ -o args\n\nAnother way we could approach this is via checking where /proc/<pid>/exe. This file is a symlink that points to the executable file. Thus we can do \nuser@ubuntu:~$ ls -l /proc/$$/exe\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 adminx adminx 0 Apr  4 18:20 /proc/1241/exe -> /bin/bash\nuser@ubuntu:~$ sh\n$ ls -l /proc/$$/exe\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 adminx adminx 0 Apr  4 18:20 /proc/1255/exe -> /bin/dash\n\nEither of the two approaches works in 99% of the cases. Of course, there are ways in which they can be subverted. For instance, symlink won't point anywhere if the executable was deleted shortly after the shell started ( and in that case you probably will encounter system issues, since removing /bin/sh, /bin/dash, or even /bin/bash is not recommended - after all a lot of scripts rely on them, especially system-level ones). Command name for shell is usually set as the very first argument in execve() syscall. This is covered in How does bash know how it is being invoked? , so if you have an application that launches a shell via execve(), it could give it any name. But these are non-standard and non-typical things, that should be avoided for the sake of consistency and security. \n\nGetting Terminal Information\nWe can start with the environment variables. Many terminals seem to mask themselves as xterm-compatible, which is reported by echo $TERM or echo $COLORTERM. But then environment variables are not very reliable tool. They can be set and unset. We can do the same thing with PIDs again, except this time we will look at parent PID. As you may remember, terminal is the interface to the shell and often starts the shell itself. Therefore we can find out what process is the parent process of our shell:\n$ ps -p $$ -o args,ppid\nCOMMAND                      PPID\nbash                         1234\n$ ps -p 1234 -o args\nCOMMAND\n/usr/lib/gnome-terminal/gnome-terminal-server\n\nLet's try with another terminal app, sakura:\n$ ps -p $$ -o args,ppid\nCOMMAND                      PPID\n/bin/bash                   16950\n$ ps -p 16950 -o args\nCOMMAND\nsakura\n\nFrom there we can already see that what started this shell is gnome-terminal. This method of course works assuming you're working with interactive shell. If we're trying to find out the parent of bash -c '...' or the shell started via ssh, for example, PID may very well be from non-terminal application and maybe non-GUI at all.\nSo if we want to specifically deal with GUI terminal, what we can do is run xprop, click on the desired window, grep its pid, and find out what's the name of that process matching pid. Or in other words:\n$ ps aux | grep $(xprop | awk -F'='  '/PID/ {print $2}')                       \nxieerqi   2124  0.6  1.7 208068 34604 ?        Sl   18:47   1:49 gnome-terminal\n\nAdditionally, as per specifications , window managers should set WM_CLASS property. Thus, we can get that from xprop as well:\n$ xprop WM_CLASS \nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"sakura\", \"Sakura\"\n\nOf course, this also has its 1% of disadvantages: setting WM_CLASS properties relies on window manager doing that, and PID is not guaranteed for a window to be accurate ( see What process created this X11 window? ), which may involve complex debugging. And these aren't shortcomings of the methods themselves but of X11 server. However, most stable and well known window managers ( like openbox, Metacity, blackbox ) and most applications are well behaved so we shouldn't expect problems with something like Gnome Terminal or Terminator. \nBut when it comes to GUI terminal emulators, we don't even need to find a command. We can just use the About dialog of the window itself. Exception to that rule is xterm. \n\nA: If you just want the name of the terminal program, you'll most probably find it under Help > About.\n\nA: Use tty - prints the file name of the terminal connected to standard input.\nIn gnome-terminal:\n $ tty\n /dev/pts/2\n\nIn a virtual terminal (ALT+F4):\n $ tty\n /dev/tty4\n\n\nA: If you want to know the terminal program you are using, use this:\nps -o 'cmd=' -p $(ps -o 'ppid=' -p $$)\n\nRun this just after opening the terminal (shell) without forking any further shell instance.\nWhen you open up the terminal program, it basically spawns a child program, a shell. So the parent of the spawned shell is the terminal itself. In other words, the PPID of the shell is the PID of terminal program.\nHere we are finding the parent process ID (PPID) of the shell (bash) by ps -o 'ppid=' -p $$ , which will be the process ID of terminal program.\nThen we are finding the process name from the PID:\n$ ps -o 'cmd=' -p $(ps -o 'ppid=' -p $$)\ngnome-terminal\n\nIt is basically a one liner of:\n$ ps -o 'ppid=' -p $$\n 2268\n\n$ ps -o 'cmd=' -p 2268\ngnome-terminal\n\n\nA: The best way is to install neofectch\nsudo apt install neofetch\n\nJust type the below given command and checkout the terminal\nneofetch\n\n\nA: The short version (thx @Serg)\ncat /etc/alternatives/x-terminal-emulator\n\n\nThe long version\nsudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator\n\nand look for the * in the output\n;)\n\nExample output\nThere are 7 alternatives which provide `x-terminal-emulator’.\n\nSelection Alternative\n———————————————–\n    1 /usr/bin/xterm\n    2 /usr/bin/uxterm\n    3 /usr/bin/koi8rxterm\n    4 /usr/bin/lxterm\n *+ 5 /usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper\n    6 /usr/bin/konsole\n    7 /usr/bin/xfce4-terminal.wrapper\n\nPress enter to keep the default[*], or type selection number:\n\n\nOr, thanks to @muru, here is more detailed output\n$ update-alternatives --display x-terminal-emulator\nx-terminal-emulator - auto mode\n  link currently points to /usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper\n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper - priority 40\n  slave x-terminal-emulator.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/gnome-terminal.1.gz\n/usr/bin/koi8rxterm - priority 20\n  slave x-terminal-emulator.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/koi8rxterm.1.gz\n/usr/bin/lxterm - priority 30\n  slave x-terminal-emulator.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/lxterm.1.gz\n/usr/bin/mate-terminal.wrapper - priority 30\n  slave x-terminal-emulator.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/mate-terminal.1.gz\n/usr/bin/uxterm - priority 20\n  slave x-terminal-emulator.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/uxterm.1.gz\n/usr/bin/xterm - priority 20\n  slave x-terminal-emulator.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/xterm.1.gz\nCurrent 'best' version is '/usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper'.\n\n\nA: cat /etc/alternatives/x-terminal-emulator | grep exec\n\nSample output:\n\nexec('gnome-terminal',@args);\n\nThere's the answer for my system: gnome-terminal.\nSo, typing gnome-terminal into my terminal will now open up another identical terminal window.\nSources:\n\n*\n\n*Sergiy Kolodyazhnyy's comment under A.B.'s answer.\n\n\nA: Run neofetch and it will tell you.\n\nA: Simple answer.

As such, some applications will call to Nautilus instead of Nemo, e.g. opening the Download directory from Chrome.\nYou can change your default file manager to Nemo by following:\nHow to set nemo as default instead of nautilus?\nOnce you change your default file manager, you may have to change your desktop back to what you want and/or reset your computer.\n\nA: Try this hack I had to do in order to change Ubuntu MATE lockscreen.\n\n\n*\n\n*locate the image which is set as your background (somewhere in /usr/share/backgrounds/)\n\n*rename your desired picture, so the name is the same, as of the image located in /usr/share/backgrounds/\n\n*rename original picture in /usr/share/backgrounds/ to \"picturebackup\" or whatever you want\n\n*copy your new image to that location\n\n*restart (might not be necessary)\n\n\nCinnamon shouldn't act the way it does, but this way you might get temporary fix!\n", "Q: After removing a package, more packages are removed After I type in my shell:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove openssl\n\nI got more than just openssl packages removed, why?\nBelow is partial output:\n(Reading database ... 400426 files and directories currently installed.)\nRemoving nautilus-share (0.7.3-1ubuntu5) ...\nRemoving apturl (0.5.2ubuntu4) ...\nRemoving bluez-cups (4.101-0ubuntu13.1) ...\nRemoving google-chrome-stable (43.0.2357.124-1) ...\n\n\nA: Because they depend on something you just said to remove - openssl is the dependency in question. None of those programs can run without it.\nFor example, when I install something, have a look at the output:\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\n  chkrootkit john john-data procmail sendmail sendmail-base sendmail-bin\n  sendmail-cf sensible-mda tripwire\n\nThat is because the package I want to install (tiger) needs these - they are dependencies.\nWell the same has happened here. nautilus-share, apturl, bluez-cups and google-chrome-stable all need openssl to run - so they are uninstalled at the same time.\nNext time you remove something, you will may see something like this:\nThe following packages will be REMOVED\n  akregator amarok amarok-utils anoise anoise-media apport-kde\n  apt-xapian-index apturl-kde ark audiocd-kio bluedevil blueproximity\n\nIf you see something you want, don't remove the main package. In the case above, I was going to remove python - but that would remove a lot (231) of things.\n\nA: Take a look at the dependencies with aptitude why:\n$ aptitude why openssl\ni   ca-certificates Depends openssl (>= 1.0.0)\n$ aptitude why ca-certificates\ni   software-properties-common Depends ca-certificates\n$ aptitude why software-properties-common \ni   software-properties-gtk Depends software-properties-common\n$ aptitude why software-properties-gtk \ni   ubuntu-desktop Depends software-properties-gtk\n\n$ aptitude why apturl\ni   nautilus-share Depends apturl\n$ aptitude why nautilus-share\ni   ubuntu-desktop Recommends nautilus-share\n\nSo, this shows that openssl is installed because it is a dependency of ca-certificates.\nca-certificates is a dependency of software-properties-common which again is a dependency of software-properties-gtk.\nsoftware-properties-gtk finally is a dependency of ubuntu-desktop. So all of these will be removed if you remove openssl. They recursive depend on openssl.\nBecause of ubuntu-desktop gets removed and nautilus-share is recommended by ubuntu-desktop (and most likely has no other reason for being installed) it will be removed, too. same goes with apturl\n", "Q: How can i resolve problem with loading system if i have some of this error?

We have a public web site that is built on Drupal, uses a MySQL DB and we also have some files that are uploaded to our site and stored on our file system.\nSince I have only one web server now, I am trying to find a solution for redundancy.  There are many choices and I am not sure what one is best for me.  \nI have seen rsyncmirrir, apt-mirror, clustering, etc.  Just not sure what one is going to be best for me.\n\nA: Try NGINX as a load-balancer for two web servers:  http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/load_balancing.html\nUse rsync over ssh to keep your doc roots in sync.  Clustering MySQL will be trickier.\n\nA: You've got a couple options.\nHere's my take, and you'll need a total of 4 servers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by moving your database off of the server now, and onto a server dedicated to the DB ('DB Server', #1 in this suggestion).  Migrate it to its own MySQL instance on a separate server, and configure that server's firewall (and MySQL) to listen for connections ONLY from the two web servers.\n\n*On the MySQL server, create a user that has access to the databases/tables it needs.  Try to avoid giving DBA access to this user, but keep the creds identical for each server, or set up two MySQL DB users for it, one for each server.\n\n*Keep your first Apache box ('Apache Server One', #2 in this suggestion) now.  Add in another. ('Apache Server Two', #3 in this suggestion).\n\n*Lock down user access on the web servers to be extremely limited (SSH Key Auth Only, No Root Login, etc.).\n\n*Set up Apache on both of the web servers, and configure the files to be synced (whether you have that as git version controlled or however, make sure those files and configs on Apache are identical, except for DB users if you use different MySQL users with the same access rights for each server).\n\n*Configure NGINX for load balancing on another server, which will be where the 'website' ends up starting at ('Load Balancer', #4 in this suggestion), and from there it load balances to the Apache servers, transparently passing traffic through.\n\n\nThe only thing is, if you really want \"load balancing\" because of heavy load, first look at how dynamic your site content is, and if it's not very dynamic and mostly static content (or CMS'd content that doesn't change frequently), consider using caching on your Apache server instead of load balancing...\n", "Q: Networking failed to start and mouse also not working I have installed ISPCONFIG SERVER ON UBUNTU 12.04 DESKTOP.\nOn update my mouse stopped working.\nThen I run a command\nsudo dpkg --reconfigure -a\nsudo apt-get upgrade.\n\nIt took lot of time to reconfigure, after I restarted the system, now mouse is still not working and I am faced with another problem.

That makes sense when diff is used to see what changed in a file.\nThe options we need are the ones to set the format for \"old\" lines, \"new\" lines, and \"unchanged\" lines.\nThe formats we need are very simple:\nFor the changed lines, new and old, we want to output only the text of the lines. %L is the format symbol for the line text.\nFor the unchanged lines, we want to show nothing.\nWith this, we can write options like --old-line-format='%L', and put it all together, using your example data:\n$ diff --old-line-format='%L' --new-line-format='%L' --unchanged-line-format='' test1.csv test2.csv\n100,4,2,1,7\n100,300,500,700\n21,22,23,24,25\n50,25,700,5\n\n\nNotes on performance\nBecause the files have different size, try to exchange the input files if it does not matter, it could be that the inner workings of diff can handle one way better than the other. Better is either needing less memory, or less computation.\nThere is an optimisation option for using diff with large files: --speed-large-files. It uses assumptions about the file structure, so it's not clear whether it helps in your case, but worth trying it.\nThe format options are described in the man diff under --LTYPE-line-format=LFMT.\n\nA: Since the order doesn't need to be preserved, simply:\nsort test1.csv test2.csv | uniq -u\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sort test1.csv test2.csv: merges and sorts test1.csv and test2.csv\n\n*uniq -u: prints only the lines which have no duplicate\n\n\nA: Sounds like a job for comm:\n$ comm -3 <(sort test1.csv) <(sort test2.csv)\n100,300,500,700\n    100,4,2,1,7\n    21,22,23,24,25\n    50,25,700,5\n\nAs explained in man comm:\n   -1     suppress column 1 (lines unique to FILE1)\n\n   -2     suppress column 2 (lines unique to FILE2)\n\n   -3     suppress column 3 (lines that appear in both files)\n\nSo, the -3 means that only lines that are unique to one of the files will be printed. However, those are indented according to which file they were found in. To remove the tab, use:\n$ comm -3 <(sort test1.csv) <(sort test2.csv) | tr -d '\\t'\n100,300,500,700\n100,4,2,1,7\n21,22,23,24,25\n50,25,700,5\n\nIn this case, you don't really even need to sort the files and you can simplify the above to:\ncomm -3 test1.csv test2.csv | tr -d '\\t' > difference.csv\n\n", "Q: Changing home folder encryption after changing user password When I installed Ubuntu 15.04 I chose to encrypt the home folder.\nNow I have changed the user password and I can still access the home folder. Does this mean that the home folder encryption key has also been changed or could someone access my home folder if they know my old password?\n\nA: It depends ...\nWhen you change your login password with the command line, it updates you login password without updating the ecryptfs password. This is to prevent other users (well root really) from accessing your encrypted data by changing your password. If you change the password with this method, your old password can be used to decrypt the data.\nWhen you change your login password with the graphical tools, it updates both your login password and the ecryptfs password. With this your data will be decrypted automatically when you log in and can not be accessed with the old password.\nSee http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/Ecryptfs#Password for additional information.\n\nA: If you want to use the same password/passphrase for both logging in and decrypting your home directory and want to change your passphase use the utility: 'ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase'.\n1) Change your passpharse:\necryptfs-rewrap-passphrase /home/username/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\nOld wrapping passphrase: \nNew wrapping passphrase: \nNew wrapping passphrase (again):\n\n2) Change the user password/phrase to match for auto login and mounting\npasswd <username>\n\nNote: You will probably need to install 'ecryptfs-utils'\nsudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils\n\n", "Q: Custom port names for netstat Whe I use the netstat -l command I get the port names, and when I add the -n param I will get the port numbers.\nThere is a way to set custom names to other ports?\n\nA: Yes. You can add new ports with new descriptions to the /etc/services file, and in fact, can change the name of existing ports (however, I don't know what kind of grief that may cause, if any).\nJust be sure to use the same line syntax when adding new ports, and I'd recommend keeping them all in numerical order. \n", "Q: How can I determine the OS architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) from a file on a disk? Sadly my mobo went bad and I have to build a new machine from scratch.  I don't recall if I originally loaded the 32 or the 64 bit version of the OS, (K)ubuntu 14.04.  \nIf I mount the existing HDD is there a file I can examine to determine the OS architecture?  Needs to be something more than the presence of a 64bit executable or library as these are not reliable ways to determine the running OS. \nI cannot run uname -a as this is a mounted disk, not a running OS.\n\nA: I agree that in general the mere presence of a certain kind of executable or library isn't useful because it's possible to have objects of more than one architecture installed, but there are some executables that you can only have one of.  file /mnt/usr/bin/dpkg (replacing /mnt with wherever you mounted your filesystem) will tell you whether the core package manager is 32-bit or 64-bit, which is an accurate indicator of the rest of the system unless you're in the middle of an in-place migration from one to the other - you'd certainly know if you were!\n\nA: It is trivial to determine whether the host operating system has a 32-bit or 64-bit kernel by running:\nuname --machine\n\nAn output of i386 means 32-bit and x86_64 means 64-bit.\nIt is less trivial, but still feasible to determine whether an application is compiled for the i386 or amd64 architecture but neither of these will indicate the architecture of the kernel. Even checking /sbin/init is not technically sufficient since the init program can be customized at boot time.\nThe only foolproof way to determine the architecture of the kernel is to actually boot it. Luckily this can easily be done using qemu.\nBegin by opening a terminal and navigating to /boot on the hard drive. You will find one or more compressed kernel images in the form:\nvmlinuz-[version]-[type]\nFor example, I have vmlinuz-3.19.0-21-generic present in /boot on my machine. Now, assuming you have the qemu-system-x86  package installed, run the following command, substituting the filename where appropriate:\nqemu-system-i386 -kernel <path_to_kernel>\n\nIf you see a wall of text scroll by and eventually panic (because the root FS is missing), you have installed a 32-bit kernel. If instead you receive an error similar to the one displayed below, you have a 64-bit kernel (which will not boot on an x86 CPU).\n\n\nA: Look at the directories organization from the root of your old hard disk, this method is analogous to look for the \"Program Files\" and \"Program Files (x86)\" directories if it where a Windows OS.\nIn Linux, if 64 bit, you will see \"lib32\" and \"lib64\" directories, while if 32 bit you will only encounter the lib directory (I don't remember now if there would be a lib32 directory too).\nIf you do not trust in the suggested method, or need more guaranties, the \"file\" command looks promising. Looking at @ColinWatson answer, personally, I think that /sbin/init is a better candidate, but any of those files (dpkg or init) will match the Kernel arch.\nFor example, the execution of file /sbin/init will provide an output like this:\n/sbin/init: ELF 64-bit LSB  shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24\n\nJust replace the path to /sbin/init with the proper mount point of your old root partition, if it is now /media/oldroot, the full path becomes /media/oldroot/sbin/init\n", "Q: DNS routing after PPTP connection I use a PPTP VPN to connect to my work's environment, but don't know how to configure DNS resolution the way it seems appropriate.\nWhen I connect via Network Manager I get two servers in /etc/ppp/resolv.conf and mywork.com.br as a search domain in /etc/resolv.conf.

I am using Ubuntu 15.04.\nI installed gVim using sudo apt-get install vim-gnome. After installing, I played around with opening and editing files and changing the colorscheme to Solarized.\nI then attempted to reset everything to the way it originally was by deleting ~/.vimrc and the entire ~/.vim directory. That successfully removed the Solarized colorscheme I had installed. However, after I did this, the program seemed to retain some strange state that I can't figure out how to change.\nWhen I search for gvim in Dash, the result that comes up is titled foo.txt (~/test/directory/that/...was/playing/with) - GVIM instead of just GVIM. If I run the gVim from that search, lock it to the Launcher, then close the program and hover over the locked icon, similar text is shown (foo.txt (~/test/directory/that/i/was/playing/with) - GVIM), instead of just the program name.\nWhile the program is running (after I start it by Dash search or locked icon), the title shown in the menu bar at the top of the screen is foo.txt (~/test/directory/that/i/was/playing/with) - GVIM, but the title of the window itself is bar.txt (~/test/directory/that/i/was/playing/with) - GVIM (where foo.txt and bar.txt are two different files that I was previously editing in the same directory).\nTo try to solve this problem, I uninstalled gVim using sudo apt-get remove --purge vim-gnome and sudo apt-get autoremove, then reinstalled it the same way I originally installed it. The problem seemed to have disappeared at first, but after logging out of and then back into my account, everything appeared to be exactly the way it was before I reinstalled gVim.\nOne of the tiny details that I found irritating about gVim was that the icon displayed in the Alt-Tab menu is horribly low-resolution. Strangely, immediately after I reinstalled it, the icon shown in the Alt-Tab menu looked nice and high-resolution. After logging out of and back into my account, though, it had returned to its previous low-resolution self.\nUpon running ls -a in my home directory, I noticed a file called .viminfo which contained the text test/directory/that/i/was/playing/with/bar.txt, so I thought that that file might be the source of my problems. I tried deleting the file in multiple different ways and restarting gVim, but every time I did so, it reappeared with the exact same contents.\nI can't find any information about this problem. Does anyone know how to remove those filenames that seem to have baked themselves into the program and restore the Alt-Tab icon to its proper resolution?\nUpdate: As suggested by muru, I tried adding a ~/.gvimrc file with the text set notitle. This didn't affect my main problem, which is that the name of a recently edited file seems to have elevated itself to the status of the gVim program name. I also tried deleting /etc/vim (and then putting it back when that didn't work). I don't understand how this could happen, but I'm guessing that it's not something that can be fixed by just editing some text file contents; I don't see how such an edit could change the displayed name of the program itself. Am I incorrect in that assumption?\n\nA: Deleting the programs files does not remove or reset the program. \nIn order to completely remove the program you must uninstall the program, and then reinstall it.\nTo do this you must:\nUninstall the program. \nTo do this you must first open the terminal. To do this press: \nctrl + alt + T\n\nThe terminal window should now be open. To uninstall it type the following command:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove vim-gnome\n\nThis may ask you to enter your password, then it will completely remove the program.\nReinstall the Program\nTo do this simply type:\nsudo apt-get install vim-gnome\n\nAgain you may need to enter your password.\nOnce this is finished you are finished.\n", "Q: Where is the man page for \"pthread_mutexattr_getrobust\"?

The fixes will usually naturally be included when the next version of Ubuntu comes out, assuming the new version of Ubuntu includes a new version of the software in question.\nFirefox, however, is a special case, in which Ubuntu often will pull in changes from upstream, even when not security fixes, in order to get new versions of Firefox into existing Ubuntu releases.  The schedule this happens on is unrelated to Firefox's own release schedule and can depend on different factors, and the version they pull from upstream may not be the latest Firefox - it may be a special long term release version.\nYour options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put up with the bug until the next release of Ubuntu or the next time Ubuntu pulls in a new version of Firefox.\n\n*Compile and install Firefox manually.\n\n*Obtain Firefox from a PPA from someone who has compiled it manually for you.\n\n", "Q: error: Package requirements (libssh2) were not met I have troubles installing monodevelop.

To do this have a look at the \"Copying and pasting a partition\" section in the Gparted manual. To reproduce the steps given in the link:\nTo copy a partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select an unmounted partition. See the section called “Selecting a Partition”.\n\n*Choose: Partition → Copy.

See the section called “Selecting Unallocated Space”.\n\n*Choose: Partition → Paste. The application displays the Paste /path-to-partition dialog.\n\n*If you want you can adjust the size and location of the partition. See the section called “Specifying Partition Size and Location”.\n\n*If you want you can specify the alignment of partition. See the section called “Specifying Partition Alignment”.\n\n*Click Paste.

I believe (but am not sure) it actually execs, and so the command line, which is what ps shows, remains unchanged and the program is now different. This can be verified by examining the process' /proc directory:\n$ sudo ls -l /proc/30664/exe \nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 24 08:09 /proc/30664/exe -> /usr/bin/Xorg\n\nThis is why pgrep Xorg and killall Xorg work, but pgrep -f Xorg failed. pgrep -f searches the command lines, which still show X, not Xorg. So an action which should usually return better results, actually has worse results.\n\nIndeed, it seems X does exec. Using this SO answer:\n$ nm -D /usr/bin/X  | grep exec\n                 U execv\n\n", "Q: Running Google App Engine on Ubuntu 14.04.2 I recently switched from Windows 8.1 to Ubuntu so please forgive me if this is a stupid question. I'm new to all this.\nSo I have python 2.7.6 installed and I tried to get Google App Engine \nworking, here: Hello, World! - Python - Google Cloud Platform. How do I find the path to the Python SDK ?\n\nA: Simple Tutorial \nHere are the steps I followed to get GAE 1.7.1 working on Ubuntu 12.04.\nopen a terminal Ctr-t and make sure you are in the home directory.\ncreate a project folder. (I used google_projects)\ncd into the project folder\ndownload GAE 1.7.1\nunzip the file\ndelete the zip. (optional)\nHere are the terminal commands for the steps above:\n    cd ~\nmkdir google_projects\ncd google_projects\nwget -O gae.zip https://storage.googleapis.com/appengine-sdks/featured/google_appengine_1.9.6.zip\nunzip gae.zip\nrm gae.zip\n\nNow its time to create the project and start the development server.\n    cp -r google_appengine/new_project_template testapp\n    python google_appengine/dev_appserver.py testapp\n\nThe first line simply copies and renames the new_project_template folder into google_proects as testapp. The last line starts the development server. You can stop it with Ctr-C.\nWith the development server up and running you can view testapp at localhost:8080. You should see \"Hello world!\".\nOr you can do a diff way\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\nsudo pip install appengine\n\nThen install a given VERSION of the SDK:\nappengine.py [--prefix=/path/where/to/install] VERSION\n\nRegards!\n", "Q: How to revert to Unity from Xfce desktop at Ubuntu 14.04 I used Ubuntu 14.04 in my PC.

I tried to install steam from the .deb from the steam website (steam_latest.deb) and this didn't work; I installed later with apt-get install steam (along with the 32 libraries and stuff) and this was successful, but I was left with a huge steam-launcher icon in the unity launcher, that does nothing and says \"Invalid UTF-8\" as a description, presumably from the first attempt, which was done with the deb through software center. I tried apt-get remove steam, but just got rid of the one that actually worked. Great. Tried to reinstall from deb, and uninstall again, now I have 3 giant ugly useless icons, and no working steam. Wonderful. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: You could try doing this sudo apt-get purge steam-launcher and then install steam again. \npurge - Purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and purged. Purge meaning that any configuration files are deleted too.\nLet me know if this works or not.\nAlso try this and see which all directories have steam installed in it dpkg -L steam-launcher\nMake sure you have run all this before sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade.\n\nA: In order to get rid of these thing you need to use autoremove instead of remove so it will be like this\nsudo apt-get autoremove steam-launcher \n\nAfter you remove Steam, you can easily install it back on ur system with the .deb file downloaded from steam official website.\nRegards\n", "Q: How to install latest CouchDB on Ubuntu?

It runs InsydeH2O BIOS. I got rid of the Android stuff and decided I wanted to install Ubuntu on the SD-card and dual boot between Ubuntu and Windows 8.1. The main flash is too small to house both Windows and Ubuntu.\nI manage to boot from a Ubuntu USB key without problem and I have verified that I have booted via EFI since /sys/firmware/efi exists.\nInstallation to the SD card (/dev/mmcblk1) works fine and EFI files are correctly added to /dev/mmcblk0p1/EFI.\nI have also checked the EFI table using efibootmgr -v\n...\nBoot0007* Ubuntu    HD(1,800,32000,89b680e5-c76a-48cf-b16f-eb7733137551)File(\\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi)\n...\n\nThe item shows up in the EFI boot menu but if I select it it just boots Windows. Any way to debug why it is doing this?\n\nA: There's a chance that disabling Secure Boot will fix the problem, but that's a bit of a long shot, since I'd expect that a problem that affected the installed system would also affect the installation media. Unfortunately, no two computers are exactly alike when it comes to Secure Boot settings, so it's impossible to completely describe how to try this; but I show several examples on my page on Secure Boot.\nA more likely possibility is that you've got a defective firmware that ignores its boot settings. The best solution to this problem is to obtain a fixed firmware from your manufacturer. Unfortunately, few manufacturers ever bother to fix this type of problem, but it's worth looking for an updated firmware. (The manufacturer is likely to call it a \"BIOS,\" although it really isn't a BIOS.) If that fails, you could try working around this by using Boot Repair. You'll need to go to the Advanced menu and select the option to back up and rename the boot loader files. If that fails, then be sure to undo the operation with Boot Repair, since the moved and renamed files will just complicate the boot path and make future changes more complex.\n", "Q: What's the advantage of using the Ubuntu web apps browser?

Sadly there is no other way I or a lot of other people can help you. If you are in a work intensive environment, or want a stable OS. You should install the current LTS version of Ubuntu, or its flavors.\n15.04 and any non-lts release will not only be lacking in support from Canonical and the Ubuntu devs, but non-lts versions are susceptible to bugs that may not be \"fixed On a dime.\" Just because you have the latest version of the Ubuntu, does not mean it is the best. Mainly because most non-lts versions are used as a testing ground for features. These features are not yet 100% bug tested, but are planned to be in the next LTS release, or milestone release. \nSo if your looking for a stable OS use the latest LTS. Below I posted Links to the ISO's for the current LTS versions of the Ubuntu flavors for 14.04. At least the most popular.

I have it mounted under Devices as S2DISC1 but when I click it it's empty.\nSo I'm wondering if there is a program already on ubuntu that can copy an image or .iso from the cd to my computer and run it from there? I think I used Daemon Tools for that on windows but I never had the problem of not being able to boot a cd there.\n\nA: When burning an iso file in Ubuntu, you should be able to put the blank disc in, and it will bring up the prompt to select what you want to do. Select cancel and find the iso file. Right click the iso file, and select 'Write to disc'. This will bring up a prompt that lets you write the file to the disc. \nSelect the disc drive you want to burn to, and select your write speed. If writing the Ubuntu iso to a disc, it's recommended to use the lowest write speed possible. Click 'Burn', and wait for it finish. Once finished, verify that there are multiple files on the disc, and not just a copy of the iso.\n\nA: There are no real alternatives to Daemon Tools, but these two are probably the best you'll get:\n\n\nMountiso - command-line tool: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountIso\n Acetonel - if you're looking for a GUI: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/acetoneiso/\n\nA: If you have an ISO file obtained from a CD or DVD, you do not need any extra software to run it on Linux. You can mount it as any other device with this command: \nmount -o loop -t iso9660 fileName.iso /your/destination/folder\n\nYou then will be able to run the files on the CD as it was in a real CD unit.

Shell will find wmctrl by itself. That's for very specific cases that may involve portability.\n\n*Add ampersand at the end of firefox command. The script will proceed only if the previous command exits. Since firefox doesn't exit, the script waits for it.\n\n*As Oli pointed out, better way is to use class name. I've done multiple scripts with wmctrl where i find hex id of the window by referencing class name.\n\n\nPersonally I'd do it this way:\n#!/bin/bash\nfirefox http://www.google.de &\nsleep 3\nWM_ID=$(wmctrl -lx | awk '$3~/Navigator.Firefox/ {print $1}')\nwmctrl -i -r $WM_ID -e 0,0,0,500,800\n\nHere we open firefox , let it run in background, then we extract hex id of the window that matches class Navigator.Firefox. In wmctrl -lx field 3 is wm_class, and field 1 is hex id. awk helps us to extract field 1 here. Finally we reference that numeric id, inside the final wmctrl statement\n\nA: It seems likely that the firefox command would block the script from progressing until it exited. Simply push it into the background and your script can progress:\nfirefox http://www.google.de &\n\nOn a tangential note, you might also want to look at the -no-remote for Firefox. This will stop the command interacting with any existing Firefox instances in your DISPLAY.\nWhile we're talking tangents, the firefox command has a few helper arguments that --along with -no-remote— can help you target the new window.\nFor instance, you can set a specific class name and then have Compiz handle the resizing automagically.

This software will implement it's own protocol - HTTP, SMTP, FTP, or even some own protocol. \nThose servers won't respond to an ICMP packet. ICMP packets need to be sent to the ICMP port. \nHowever, you may just try to open a TCP connection (telnet host 12345) and see if the connection is successfully. \n\nA: Here is an example of how to ping a specific IP-port on your network:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install nMap.\n\n*Run ifconfig -a to identify your network topology; the terminal output should display the host IP-address traced to your command-line, displayed after \"inet\" (e.g. inet: 10.0.0.2). \n\n*Now open the nMap tool to scan your network by running nmap -sP network-ip-address topology/24 (e.g. nmap -sP 10.0.0.1/24); that should display all hosts connected to the network.\n\n*Locate the host IP-address of the port you wish to ping; for example, if your network is hosting a VPN server on a router at IP address 10.0.0.233.  First, try to ping the address by running nmap -sn host-ip-address (eg nmap -sn 10.0.0.233)- the terminal output should return a report that the server is either up or down.\n\n*However, sometimes a host may only be visible or identifiable if you ping a specific port by running nmap -Pn port-number ip-address; for example, the subject router may only be traceable if we ping a specific port on the router- in this case UDP port 1143 for OpenVPN (e.g. nmap -Pn 1143 10.0.0.233).  The aforementioned command should confirm that the port is open within the terminal output, even if the host is ostensibly down according to the initial run of the nmap port-scan.\n\n\nHope that helps- it helped me!\n", "Q: Prevent access to a folder in WINE (running on Lubuntu) I have a windows executable that takes in a project file name and runs it this way, under WINE (on Lubuntu).

It's a access control layer that can add additional conditioons on user and processes.

I have been searching for the answer of this question, but I couldn't find.\nI know I can upgrade the kernel version to the newer one, but it seems that a lot of people had problems after installing it. So, I would prefer to stay with this version, that is working perfectly.\nBut, even if I have an older version of the kernel (3.13), I will receive updates (security or not) for this version? Or I have to upgrade in order to continue receiving updates for it?\nThank you guys for helping me.\n\nA: 3.13 is the kernel version for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and will be supported until April 2019.  Ubuntu 14.04.2 comes with 3.16 which only has an 18 month support from Feb 2015.

That is used for booting up your system. It's how your EFI firmware knows where to hand off the boot process to the kernel.\nAs for /dev/sda3 and ~/sda9, those both look like they've either been partitioned in something that Ubuntu can't see (HIGHLY UNLIKELY), or they haven't been partitioned at all. They should be safe to add to the partitions that you want to create/extend.\nI'm not sure what's in /dev/sda5, so I'm not sure what to tell you there. From it's size, it looks like it should be the Windows recovery console, but /dev/sda1 is already labelled as RE tools. I would look at mounting the partition, viewing what's on it, and maybe do some web searching based on what you find to figure out if it's safe to remove or not. It's probably Windows related, and safe to remove, since Ubuntu generally doesn't use NTFS unless you specify, but I would still proceed with caution.\n", "Q: Manager Nautilus The Nautilus manager is good, but I think he needs supplements, despite many extensions.

For this what would be the best option to create a new file manager for Ubuntu with System Innovation face, or use the Nemo manager? I'm not a developer is only one question I do.\n\nA: I would try Nemo first before trying to create a new file manager for Ubuntu, because Nemo already has the features that you are looking for. Nemo is a complete fork of Nautilus and its goal is to extend the Cinnamon user experience to desktop and file management. Nemo has features like: compact view, all desktop icons, etc. which are not available in the latest nautilus versions, Open in terminal and open as root, File operation progress while copy/move files shows percentage and details, Has nice GTK bookmarks management, up/forward/back and refresh buttons, Nice proper status bar, better search, better widgets and many more.\nTo show how much storage is being used in Nautilus, right-click any folder and select Properties -> Basic tab and look for the Contents: field, the third field from the top. There is probably a similar feature to show how much storage is being used in Nemo.\n", "Q: Error in nvidia-331 causes me unable to install, delete, or do almost anything besides open up a browser I have Ubuntu 14.10 I cannot purge, or reinstall nvidia-331 and this seems to be destroying my computer.

If you create a user without -g option a primarygroup will be created with the same name as the new username and the new user will be added to this group.\nWhen user creates a file/directory it gets the group of user's primary group. You can have only one primary group assigned to a user. But you can have multiple secondary groups per user. Use option -G with useradd / usermod command to add secondary groups. \nSo if you want to create a user and with primary group as sudo , use command: \nuseradd -g sudo <newusername>\n\nuseradd syntax:\nuseradd -g <primary group> -G <secondarygroup1>,<secondarygroup2> <NewUsername> \n\nIn linux the primary group will stored to /etc/passwd file. /etc/groups file will have only list of secondary groups of a user, so getent group sudo ( which looks in /etc/group for group info) won't show the primary group of that user ie. sudo . Use id <username> or groups <Username> to list all the groups, the user is member of. You can also check the 4th field of the /etc/passwd for the primary group gid of a user.\nGoogle and Man pages are your best friend when in doubt.\n", "Q: New version of LibreOffice file reverts back to previous version I worked on a file in LibreOffice. I saved it as a .docx file. Let's call this version 1 of the file. Later today, I opened the file, made very important changes over the course of several hours, and saved the file.

It's just this file. Is this a LO issue? Or an Ubuntu issue? This folder is tracked in Dropbox... are there any bugs with that software that can cause this? And, absolutely most important: are there any ways I can recover version 2 of the file?! \n\nA: Dropbox is a flag for me. At work my team uses a Dropbox share for project files, and if the same file is opened by two users at once, changes will be made to a cloned file not the main instance of the file. Check that you don't have a second similarly named file in Dropbox which contains your changes.\n\nA: Are you sure you saved it where you think you saved it?

Since there's no updates on the enhancement request raised by @DavidJarvie on the KAlarm Project, documented in my previous question over here: https://askubuntu.com/a/257843/9598, I started wondering if is it there a scheduler whose features preferably includes (and perhaps \"only includes\") a text user interface.\nI have tried CRON to schedule my tasks but, as they are too many (hundreds of commands a day), in certain cases CRON isn't running some of them. But, if there is a proficient CRON Text User Inteface which offers at least some of the KAlarm features, it will be welcome.\nHere's a screenshot of what I find in KAlarm's GUI and which I would like to find in a TUI.\n\nThe reason for this need is that SSH support is needed for this task, which can't be solved efficiently via GUI. What I do right now is to Remote Desktop the Server in order to do the scheduling.\nThanks in advance.\n\n@muru has ponted in a comment to the at command. Which seems good but it clearly states in the at's man page:\n\n    3. To have a job reschedule itself, at can be invoked from within  the\n       at-job.

How do they differ from backports ?\n[ This is only to let me pass the minimum length constraint ]\n\nA: Extras include 3rd-party software that is available for this version of Ubuntu. Packages here aren't in the core Ubuntu repo, but are instead in a different repo (located at http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu).\nCurrently, there's only one package for Utopic (something related to PPAs), and no packages for Vivid, which might mean that this is being closed down.\nBackports, on the other hand, is the process of bringing newer versions of programs in a later Ubuntu release back to the current Ubuntu release. This is managed by Ubuntu itself, and people can request a backport of some package by following this process.

I've tried previous answers but none worked.\n\nA: Warning, the following involves formating the drive. Formatting will often erase files and saved contents so BACKUP the files BEFORE YOU START as this process may very well and probably will delete everything on the device!!!\nYou can encrypt the device using the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cryptsetup gnome-disk-utility\n\nSearch for and open disk utility in your applications. Select your device under the Peripherial Devices section.\nClick the Unmount Volume button. Then, click the  Format Volume button and enable \"Encrypt underlying device\".\nAgain, formating will erase the device so check to make sure you’re formatting the correct drive and you’ve backed up its files before continuing!!!\nYou will be asked to create a passphrase for the device and you will also have other options for the system to remember the password or not.\nSource (click here for more info): www.howtogeek.com/115955/how-to-quickly-encrypt-removable-storage-devices-with-ubuntu/\n", "Q: sudo permission doesn't time out durring apt-get upgrade Consider this: \nYou type $sudo apt-get upgrade and get a list of things that need upgrading with a \"Y\\n\" confirmation. \nbefore you can read the list, and type \"Y\" or \"n\", the phone rings, or your boss comes in, or you do some thing else. You come back an hour later, and hit Y to install updates.\nyou are not prompted again for a password. presumably, any more sudo commands in the shell will execute, because the timer has been on hold waiting for the user input. Or a user can kill the update process and do something like sudo -i and simply stay in root indefinitely. \nI am using ubuntu mate 14.04\nis this a noteworthy security exception? Should I try to report it some place?\nIf so, where? \n\nA: sudo's default timestamp_timeout variable is 15 minutes. This means that if you click n on sudo apt-get upgrade within 15 minutes, you can anticipate entering root shell with sudo -i. That's exactly what happened. However, if you set that in /etc/sudoers as Default        timestamp_timeout 0 , you will be prompted for it every time. Personally, I've set it to 3. If your sudo doesn't time out even after 15 minutes, then there's something seriously wrong with your sudo binary.\nThis behavior isn't a security hole, but rather a \"convenience feature\" for the sudo users. However, I can agree that for tighter security the timestamp_timeout has to be set to much shorter time than 15 minutes. \nNote: passwd_timeout option that I've mentioned in my comment actually times out the password prompt when you don't type in password for x minutes. That's one of the nice moments where you realize that you should read man sudoers much more carefully.\n\nA: You aren't prompted for a password because sudo has done it's job and started apt-get as root. While it's in the prompt, the apt-get process is still running, and so since it's still running as root, there's no need to enter your password again.\nIn other words, as long as a sudo'ed process is running, you won't be asked to enter your password again for that process; sudo doesn't interrupt the process every 15 minutes (the default timeout) and ask for your password.\nNow, if you were to open another terminal and try to run another process under sudo, then you will be prompted for your password.\n\nA: I would suggest you to type sudo apt-get upgrade && exit this will exit the terminal after finishing upgrading. When the upgrading is cancelled the terminal won't close but I think that won't be the case.\n", "Q: How to add the source packages on launchpad to my PPA?

I'd like to install Ubunutu, too, giving me an option to boot into either Windows, or Ubunbtu.\nI have resized the Windows partition, leaving 10 GB available for Ubuntu.\nOn booting with the Ubuntu DVD, it doesn't 'see' Windows.

Is there a way or a better order to perform this work with partitions, so as to minimize the risk of reboot? I should move the big partition and the root partition first, and then move the boot? or viceversa? or some other way?\n\nA: First, any partitioning operation is at least a little risky. You should always have backups and a recovery plan in case of data loss or a loss of bootability.\nIn the BIOS arena, moving a partition can render it unbootable because many boot loaders rely on absolute sector values to locate more complex parts of themselves. If that sector is in a partition that moves, the reference is unlikely to be updated, and the boot will fail. Details vary from one boot loader to another, though, which makes predicting the results of moving a partition difficult. In your case, you're not using BIOS, which means that BIOS rules don't apply. Unfortunately, there's an EFI issue that can be almost as pernicious: Under EFI, boot loader information is stored in NVRAM. These entries point to boot loaders by using various types of information, including a filename, a partition GUID, a partition number, and a disk hardware identifying code. Most of these things will not change when you move your partition, but its partition number might change.\nYou could protect yourself against this possibility in various ways. The simplest might be to create a small (say, 1MiB) partition before your current /dev/sda2. That way, if GParted (or some other tool) decides to number your partitions in a rising sequence, your current /dev/sda2 will remain /dev/sda2 (or the EFI's equivalent of that). Another thing you could do would be to use the transpose feature of gdisk (the t option on the experts' menu) to swap partition numbers, should your current /dev/sda2 become /dev/sda1. (Note that you can swap an existing partition number with an empty one, so this can work even if there ends up being no /dev/sda2.) In either case, though, you should be proactive -- some EFIs completely delete boot entries that are invalid, so if your partition numbers change and you try to boot, the entries may be lost and you'll have to re-create them. Check your partition numbers before rebooting, and if your ESP is no longer /dev/sda2, take action immediately.\nPersonally, I think it would be easier (and cleaner) to plan to restore your boot loader(s). You've probably got GRUB installed now, so you could use Boot Repair, which usually does a decent job restoring GRUB setups. If you install another couple of OSes, Boot Repair might or might not do as good a job -- but then, if you install another OS, it will install its own boot loader/manager, which might do what you need. (If it doesn't do what you need, you'll have to take action to fix it, since the new OS will almost certainly set its boot loader as the default one.) Another option and generally useful backup is having my rEFInd installed on a USB flash drive. It can help boot in an emergency situation, since it relies less on configuration files than most boot loaders. If the GRUB setup starts getting confused by having too many OSes, rEFInd might do a better job as your regular boot manager, too -- but that's a matter of both personal preference and what works well in particular situations.\n", "Q: Print \"hello\" if number of files in a directory is bigger than the number in first line of a file Write command line that prints hello if number of files in current directory is bigger than the number specified in first line of file check. \nThis works fine but i want a one command line.

I'm trying to convert an existing debian/rules file of a package to use debhelper.  The current rules file employs rules which specify an installation prefix (via a variable).  \nIs there a way for me to include/specify the prefix (and possibly other variables, like ones denoting the architecture) in the .install file?\nAs an example, if built on a 64-bit machine with the prefix set to /opt, I'd like to be able to install the package files to ${PREFIX}/package/${ARCH}.\n\nA: So it looks like the files in debian/ should be as architecture agnostic and standard as possible.  This means taking care of architecture-specific steps at build time and making 'standard' files (binaries, libraries) available for the extra files in /debian.\n\nA: As mentioned by Kevin, I decided to use a dh_override_install rule:\ndh_override_install:\n    ARCH=`uname -p`; \\\n    if test \"$${ARCH}\" != \"x86_64\"; then \\\n        sed -i -e \"s/x86_64/$${ARCH}/g\" debian/*.install; \\\n    fi\n    dh_install\n\nDon't forget that the debian/rules file is a makefile, which means you are expected to have tabs for indentation.\nThe $$ is to escape the $ so as to reference the variable I define in the shell, not a make variable.\nSince my files are for x86_64 by default, I skip on the sed in that case. Here is an example of my .install files:\nusr/include/uv.h                              usr/include/\nusr/include/uv/*                              usr/include/uv/\nusr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libuv.a              usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/\nusr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/libuv.pc   usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/\n\nAnd the reason I need to include the architecture to pick just some files is because I have a developer version (libuv.a) and a runtime version (libuv.so). I have another package where I can do without such because I can just copy the whole usr/lib folder at once. Here, I had to have support for the architecture. Unfortunate that the Debian packager doesn't yet know about such.

While installing Ubuntu I created a partition of 8 GB. My questions are as below:\n\n\n*\n\n*I understand that my OS is installed in that 8 GB of space and when I will start the guest OS then it will leaded from that space. \n\n\n*\n\n*So, space occupied by OS + space required by OS for persistent storage is 8 GB, or guest OS can take up some space beyond 8GB from my main hard disk?   \n\n*Am I correct in understanding that 8 GB is like a virtual hard disk for my OS.\n\n\n*As I could understand from other posts, that my host OS will occupy some RAM (before start of guest OS) and \n\n\n*\n\n*then guest OS will start then it can get only left over RAM or how it works? \n\n*When I installed OS I didn't get any option about how much RAM you want to allocate. If there is default RAM allocated then how much RAM was allocated.     \n\n*Can hard disk space we used by guest OS as virtual RAM and if so then only from those 8 GB or main hard disk space as well.     \n\n\n*My host OS is 32 bit, but guest OS is 64 bit, now I understand that 32 bit system will have 4 bytes of memory address and 64 bit system will have 8 bytes of memory address. I don't how should I understand it.\n\n*Is my guest OS on same hardware or because it is 64 bit OS, some registers or something in hardware is changed?\n\n*Will a given application will run fast because it is on 64 bit system which means it can have faster CPU cycles etc.?\n\n\nPlease forgive for novice questions.\nP.S.There are many posts there host and guest OS are discussed but in none of them I could find complete information related to resource sharing and other questions I asked.\n\nA: I am unfortunately not sure if I understood all questions the right way, so please feel free to ask again if something is not clear:\nVirtualBox is a usual application as e.g. a Word processor is. That means the application asks the underlying OS (because an OS cares about the resources a computer HW has) for RAM. Of course it is a special application because it uses OS-drivers to get special rights e.g. like exclusive accesses over a USB device.\n\n\n*\n\n*When setting up your virtual hard disk is a file on your host. This file even is NOT 8GB big in the beginning but it is getting larger when you occupy more space. But it will never be bigger than the 8GB you specify. Your guest operating system will notice a \"disk full\" state when you full use the 8GB.\nBecause it is a file you can even raise the size later on via the \"VBoxManage modfiyhd ---resize\" command.\n\n*\n*\n\n*The setting of your virtual machine also has a constraint how many RAM the machine is allowed to use. \n\n*When you have a 4GB RAM host machine and your guest is configured as a 16GB RAM machine, then the host OS will do what it always does when applications need more RAM than physical available: it\nswaps to hard disk (when it is allowed to do so, but this is the usual case on a desktop OS). This means you as a user will recognize that your machine is\nslow when the virtual machine runs applications that need more RAM.\n\n*You can change the maximum RAM size of your guest machine in the Settings Dialog -> System -> Motherboard -> Base Memory\n\n\n*Well I not fully understand this question. Virtual box is a virtual machine, that means it is a program that simulates a PC processor and its periphery. It also simulates the 64bit processor behavior on a 32bit machine. \n\n*Your guest OS is on different hardware, because your hardware is simulated in the virtual machine. That is also the reason why you need to install the \"VirtualBoxAdditions Drivers\" in your guest OS to use the underlying host hardware more effectively. \n\n*Not at all. The underlying host operating system is on 32bit, 64bit in the guest has to be simulated and this costs more processor instructions that a native application. This also means that a virtual machine can never be faster than the underlying hardware.\nI hope I wrote down the answers you were looking for. \n", "Q: Can't exec \"locale\": No such file or directory at /usr/share/perl5/Debconf/Encoding.pm line 16 Please help me this is a problem\nCan't exec \"locale\": No such file or directory at /usr/share/perl5/Debconf/Encoding.pm line 16.\nUse of uninitialized value $Debconf::Encoding::charmap in scalar chomp at /usr/share/perl5/Debconf/Encoding.pm line 17.\ndpkg: warning: 'ldconfig' not found in PATH or not executable\ndpkg: error: 1 expected program not found in PATH or not executable\nNote: root's PATH should usually contain /usr/local/sbin, /usr/sbin and /sbin\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)\n\n\nA: Try this:\napt-get download libc-bin\ndpkg -x libc-bin*.deb libdir/\nand then:\nsudo cp libdir/sbin/ldconfig /sbin/\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libc-bin\nsudo apt-get install -f\nTaken from old Ubuntu forum archives.\n", "Q: How to get rid of Google chrome secret audio recorder?

Also, you could possibly run into dependency issues which can be a headache. If you are adventurous and enjoy a challenge it may be kind of fun, however, you may end up having to reinstall because of a broken package management problem so do so at your own risk!!\nFirst, add the 14.04 repository just in case there are any explicit dependencies needed.\nCopy your existing sources list:\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trusty-sources.list\n\nModify the copied file:\nsudo sed -i 's/utopic/trusty/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trusty-sources.list\n\nNext, backup and then modify your /etc/lsb-release file:\nsudo cp /etc/lsb-release /etc/lsbbackup\nsudo sed -i 's/utopic/trusty/g;s/10/04/g' /etc/lsb-release; cat /etc/lsb-release\n\nThe output should look like this:\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04\"\n\nNext, update apt-get:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nFinally, install, re-install, or try running Parallel Studio and it should say your current version is supported.\n\nThe recommended approach, of course, is to go ahead and install 14.04LTS.

Debian or Ubuntu must have a template or standard for this sort of thing, right?\n\nA: There is no particular standard you must follow with it.\nREADME and INSTALL are intended to be separate things, though. Generally, README is content describing what the package is, and INSTALL is describing how to install it. If you use GNU autotools, it follows the scheme of having a README and INSTALL file. If you have source on GitHub, it expects a README.md in markdown format, which it uses to generate some HTML at the project tree root. You can name the file however you want.\nIf you are using a standard build system in your project, then it is generally obvious how one should build and install the package (assuming the source code isn't broken with hard-coded values that contradict with the build system). In some cases it may be necessary to explain what additional flags one may provide to cmake for example, to configure parts of your package in a different way from the defaults.\n", "Q: How to fix Numix theme on Ubuntu 14.04 I'm using the Numix-bluish-3.16 theme on Ubuntu 14.04. However, the visual experience is not very consistent.

Unless you explicit created a persistent partition on the drive then all of this gets removed when you reboot. \nBased on the nature of your question it sounds like tails would be a good option for you to look into: https://tails.boum.org/\nI think it does some extra stuff like scrubbing RAM. \n\nA: If the host system has no existing swap partition, all temporary files should exist in RAM. However, if the system has an existing swap partition, files may also be written to the physical hard drive on the swap partiton. \nTo test this, you can run the following command to show any active swap partitions currently in use as well as the ammount of memory (if any) currently stored on the swap partition:\nsudo swapon -s\n\nTo prevent this, you can use zram swap instead and turn swap off for the hard drive.\nYou can also use bleachkit to \"clean\" the swap partition but be carefull not to erase the wrong stuff.\nAlternatively, you can turn off swap completely using the following command:\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nand to periodically clear your ram, run the following command before ram gets full (it's probably safe to not have any important applications running when executing this command):\necho \"3\" | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\n\nA: There should not be left a trace of temporary files on the hard drive. The cookies are typically stored in a dot directory for your browser in your home directory on the usb, for instance, /home/user/.mozilla in case of firefox. Unless you explicitly mount the hard drive and symlink that directory somewhere on the hard drive, you're safe. For extra security, you can just remove the hard drive completely, but that's in the realm of overkill\n", "Q: \"mount\" does not recognize my drive I am trying to mount a HDD but I'm having no luck. The disk is a 3000GB Seagate SV35 that is exactly one year old. It is a secondary drive used only for data; the media center has an SSD for the OS partitions (Ubuntu 14.10).\nThe disk has been working very well in my media center until I powered that computer down normally. I powered up the computer a few hours later but it wouldn't start - I'm suspecting a fault in the PSU (also just 1 year old).\nI want to access the disk so I have removed it from the media center and plugged it into a SATA dock that connects via USB to my desktop computer (Ubuntu 15.04). Oddly, Disks won't properly recognize the HDD! To the best of my memory, there is only a single 3TB Linux partition on that disk, so those 802GB are definitely wrong, and apparently it can't figure out the file system type or partitioning. \nGiven that the original host machine can't start at the moment, how can I mount this disk on another computer?\n\nI've tried mounting the disk via the command line, using the -t switch to specify ext2,ext4,ntfs,ntfs-3g,auto but none of those work: mount answers that the format is invalid.\n\n\n*\n\n*dmesg output is here.\n\n*sudo fidsk -l /dev/sdc output:\n\nDisk /dev/sdc: 746,5 GiB, 801569724928 bytes, 1565565869 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDevice     Boot Start        End    Sectors Size Id Type\n/dev/sdc1           1 4294967295 4294967295   2T ee GPT\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo file --special-files /dev/sdc output:\n\n\n\n/dev/sdc: ; partition 1 : ID=0xee, start-CHS (0x0,0,1), end-CHS (0x3ff,254,63), \nstartsector 1, 4294967295 sectors, extended partition table (last)\\011\n\n\nA: Your USB to sata dock doesn't support drives > 2 TiB.  You will need to get another one or connect it via sata instead of usb.\n", "Q: diffrence between two files of different row numbers Yesterday I asked this question, and got awesome answers, it's really a joy to ask questions on this site.\nToday I got a slightly different question\nsay I have csv1\n1,2,3,4\n5,6,7,8 --\n9,10,11,12\n13,14,15 --\n\nand csv2 has \n1,2,3,4,5 --\n20,21,22,23,24\n24,25,26,27,28\n9,10,11,12,30 --\n45,46,47,48,60\n\nHow can I print only those rows whose 1st 4 fields are only present in one of the two files? In other words, discard all lines from each file whose 1st four fields are also present in a line in the other file. \n1,2,3,4\n9,10,11,12\n20,21,22,23,24\n24,25,26,27,28\n45,46,47,48,60\n\nNote that -- doesn't exist in the actual files, i added them to help you notice the difference.\nSo far, I'm loading everything in numpy arrays and comparing each element, \nif a[i] == b[i] and ...\nBut I want to know if there's a better way to do it using Linux tools.\nEdit\nEvery line in csv2 has a corresponding line in csv1 and there are no duplicate lines in the same file. basically i'm trying to remove csv2 from csv1 and output the rest of csv1. \n\nA: Here's one way:\n$ awk -F, 'NR==FNR{a[$1$2$3$4]++; next}!a[$1$2$3$4]' csv2 csv1\n110,12,31,345\n1,12,14,55 \n12,53,22,10\n1,12,32,44 \n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*-F, : set the field separator to ,. Now, the first comma-separated field of each line will be $1, the second $2 and so on.     \n\n*NR==FNR : these are two awk special variables. NR is the current input line and FNR is the line number of the current file. The two will be equal only while the 1st file is being read. \n\n*NR==FNR{a[$1$2$3$4]++; next} : while reading the 1st file, save the 1st 4 fields as a key in the array a and set their value to 1. This basically saves all 1st 4 fields of csv1. The next ensures that we immediately skip to the next line and don't process the rest of the script. \n\n*!a[$1$2$3$4] : the default action of awk is to print the current line. So, if you use something that evaluates to true, awk understands that it should print this line. !a[ $1$2$3$4] is true when a[$1$2$3$4] is not define which will happen for lines in csv1 whose 1st 4 fields were not present in any lines of csv2. Therefore, this directive will cause all lines whose 1st 4 fields have never been seen (so their value in the a array is not 1) to be printed. \n\n", "Q: How to redirect all internet traffic to SSH tunnel? First, I'm not a computer expert, I know a bit about networking and its stuff. I'm just an average computer user. So here's the question, I set up an ssh tunnel on my Linux machine with the following command:\n ssh -o \"ProxyCommand /usr/bin/corkscrew 127.0.0.1 3339 SERVERIP 443\"\n MYUSERNAME@SEVERIP -vND 1080\n\nHow can I redirect all my internet traffic through that ssh tunnel? so that when I'm browsing google / facebook or any other sites my IP will be detected as SEVERIP instead of my real IP address ? It's different from connecting with openvpn where you can just connect to your openvpn account and you're good to go, with ssh tunnel, I have to set all my apps to socks 127.0.0.1:1080 which I'd like to avoid doing that.\n\nA: One way would be to create .desktop files.  You can copy the google-chrome-stable to your desktop by typing in from a terminal window:\ncp /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop /home/username/Desktop\n\nOpen the google-chrome.desktop file with your favorite editor, and change the following line:\nExec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U\n\nto:\nExec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --proxy-server=\"socks://127.0.0.1:1080\"\n\nyou might also want to change this line close to the beginning of the .desktop file from:\nName=Google Chrome\n\nto\nName=Google Chrome (Tunnel)\n\nsave the file and exit.  Then make the file executable so it can be run:\nsudo chmod +x /home/username/Desktop/google-chrome.desktop\n\nany time you want it to connect through your tunnel you just launch that one instead.\n\nA: If you want to traffic from all applications through the SOCKS proxy server tsocks would do the trick.\n\ntsocks is a library to allow transparent SOCKS proxying. It wraps the\n  normal connect() function. When a connection is attempted, it consults\n  the configuration file (which is defined at configure time but\n  defaults to /etc/tsocks.conf) and determines if the IP address\n  specified is local. If it is not, the library redirects the connection\n  to a SOCKS server specified in the configuration file. It then\n  negotiates that connection with the SOCKS server and passes the\n  connection back to the calling program.\nDns Issues\ntsocks will normally not be able to send DNS queries through a SOCKS\n  server since SOCKS V4 works on TCP and DNS normally uses UDP. Version\n  1.5 and up do however provide a method to force DNS lookups to use TCP, which then makes them proxyable. This option can only enabled at\n  compile time, please consult the INSTALL file for more information.\n\nIf you just want to tunnel browser traffic you should be able to configure a SOCKS proxy in the browser settings.\n", "Q: Ubuntu boots to \"Read Only Filesystem\" after Upgrading I recently upgraded to 15.04, but when my computer restarted it wouldn't boot into gui and said it was a \"read only file system\" I came across this\nUbuntu boots in read-only filesystem after upgrade! \nand ran this command mount \n-o remount,rw /\n\nit booted into gui, but its extremely slow and choppy how can i fix this\nI read this post \nhttp://www.randomhacks.co.uk/read-only-file-system-after-upgrade-from-ubuntu-14-10-to-ubuntu-15-04/\nsaying I have to edit an fstab, how do I do that?\n\nA: Start the computer with a live-dvd/usb.\nAfter the load open a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nRun it:\n$ sudo -i\n# fdisk -l\n\nFdisk will inform your partitions as they are called, something like:\nDisk /dev/sda: 74,5 GiB, 80032038912 bytes, 156312576 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0xab6eab6e\n\nDevice     Boot    Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type\n/dev/sda1  *        2048  54750094  54748047 26,1G 83 Linux\n/dev/sda2       54751230 156311551 101560322 48,4G  5 Extended\n/dev/sda5       54751232  56702975   1951744  953M 82 Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda6       56705024 156311551  99606528 47,5G 83 Linux\n\nFor each of the Linux partitions, run the following commands:\n# umount /dev/sda?    \n# fsck -y /dev/sda?\n\nIn the example would:\n# umount /dev/sda1    \n# umount /dev/sda6    \n# fsck -y /dev/sda1\n# fsck -y /dev/sda6\n\nThen continue running, assuming that / is /dev/sda1:\n# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n# mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev \n# mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\n# mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\n# mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n# mount --bind /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf\n# chroot /mnt\n# dpkg --configure -a\n# apt-get -f install\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get dist-upgrade\n# apt-get autoremove\n# apt-get clean\n# umount /mnt\n# exit\n# reboot\n\n", "Q: Cannot access the localhost of the guest OS in VirtualBox I have an Ubuntu 14.04 OS as my host OS and CentOS 6.6 (Minimal) as my guest OS running on VirtualBox.\n\n\nI can SSH the guest OS from my Ubuntu terminal, but I can't access the localhost of CentOS via the browser in Ubuntu.\n    I have installed nginx as my local server.\n    I am using a bridged adapter (using eth0).\n\n\n\nA: You can access the guest by typing in the IP address of the guest in a browser.

I'll post what I've done here in case it's helpful to others. \nI added these options to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf. I'm not sure if they helped. \noptions snd-hda-intel model=dell-headset-multi \n\n# Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT HD Audio Controller \noptions snd-hda-intel index=0 model=auto vid=8086 pid=0a0c \n# # Intel Corporation 8 Series HD Audio Controller \noptions snd-hda-intel index=1 model=auto vid=8086 pid=9c20 \n\n# Prefer PCH card over HDMI card \noptions snd_hda_intel index=1,0\n\nYou may need to confirm that the \"vid\" and \"pid\" values are the same for your motherboard. I've currently lost my reference on how I looked those up.\nFinally, I frequently have to open the terminal and run alsamixer, which is a CLI app for volume adjustments. Use the arrow keys to select the \"Headphone\" column. Press \"M\" to unmute it, if it says \"M\" at the bottom. Press the up arrow to turn the volume all the way up in the headphone column. Then use the arrow keys to move to the \"Speaker\" column. You probably want to turn it all the way down unless you want sound to come out of the speakers and the headphone jack.\nAs an experiment, with alsamixer open, which what happens to the volumes when you use the media keys or the system volume slider to adjust the volume. You might expect or hope that only the \"master\" volume is selected, but I see that the \"speaker\" volume goes up and down as well, while the \"headphone\" volume is not affected. \nMy understanding is that the remaining issue is that PulseAudio does not see the Headphone output as an option. For example, if you open the sound settings, you will see \"Speakers\" an output option, but not \"Headphones\". So the next step for really fixing this to figure out how to get PulseAudio to recognize Headphone output. In the meantime, it's necessary to reset the volumes via alsamixer after every time they are adjusted by PulseAudio (using the media keys or system volume slider). \nUPDATE March 6th, 2017 Now I'm running the 4.8 kernel and I noticed an option in alsamixer that I didn't notice before: \"Auto-Mute Mode\". Setting this to \"Enabled\" causes the OS to automatically mute the laptop speakers when something is plugged into the headphone jack, which is probably what you want. \n", "Q: How to connect Nokia Lumia 730 to Ubuntu 15.04?

Is it RO? if so is there a way to change permissions for this folder only [there is information to change it for the whole phone]?\n\nA: The root filesystem is read-only and you have to remount it in read-write mode with this command\nsudo mount -o remount, rw /\n\nand copy the ringtone afterwards.\nAfter that you can restart the phone and the root filesystem will be read-only again.\n", "Q: How to fully cancel changes due to installation of software that require complex procedures? I have recently install from source a software (Odoo) that require a complex procedure to be installed: creation of new users, connection to servers etc. etc.\nI want to install it again because it doesn't work but I can't start from zero because I am not able to understand how to remove all the changes applied to Ubuntu: new users, change in the setting etc. etc. of course sudo apt-get uninstall remove only packages so it won't work.\nI wonder what is the best thing to do (back-up?) before I start to install software like that to be sure that if it doesn't work I can completely cancel the all changes due to the installation I was thinking to perform a back-up before installing software like that but I am not sure what is the best practice.\n\nA: If you have installed the package from source file you need to manually remove all the files inserted into the system by the package. \nFor future reference i would suggest you to install packages from official repositories. If for some reason you need to install from source always use checkinstall instead of make install.\nmake install simply copies file all over the system without any feasible method of tracking down them later, while using checkinstall the files that would be copied into the system is made as a package first by checkinstall. So dpkg can keep keep track of the files as they are under a package then hence while removing just sudo dpkg -r package will be enough to remove the package (and clean the files).\nIf checkinstall is not installed already, install it by:\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n\nNow the common installation procedure from source file can take the following form:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo checkinstall\n\nNow checkinstall will in turn call make install and will make a package out of the files first.\n", "Q: What code is executed when headphones are disconnected?

In Windows I can use WinSCP. In the question What is a program similar to WinSCP?, it says that you can use Nautilus’s built-in function to do this job. But in Lubuntu there’s only PCManFM. I tried to replace it with Nautilus but failed. Is there any simple way for me to have a SCP client in Lubuntu?\n\nA: PCManFM supports mounting of network file shares.\nIn the main menu, select Go > Connect to Server...\n\nI'm not familiar with WinSCP, but I assume it uses SSH. To mount an SSH share, select SSH and fill in the appropriate information, including at least the host, port (if other than 22), and user.\n\nEnter your password and how long you'd like to remain connected:\n\nAnd you're in! You can browse your files, and open/delete/edit/move them (assuming you have appropriate permissions), all within PCManFM.\n\n\nA: If you need a SCP client with a GUI, than you could try filezilla:\nsudo apt-get install filezilla\n\nUse sftp as protocol (eg: sftp://myhost) in the Host field as Port 22\n\n\nA: Although this has already been checked by the author, I wanted to mention a couple more choices.\nFirst I apologize for items 5. It is command line but interesting. For your question, look at items (1), (4) and (6).\n\n\n*\n\n*pcmanfm is native to LUbuntu (since you asked about Lubuntu which I use). The answer about PCManFM is very relevant since it already incorporates the requested functionality.  From its menu:  \nSelect \"GO | Go to Location\" \n Select ssh\nTo install this filemanager:\nsudo apt-get install pcmanfm\n\n\n\n*Nautilus file manager ships with many distros (and is popular - though not my favorite).  It will  do what you ask natively.  \nIn the left-hand pane select the Connect to Server icon.\nIn the server address blank type ssh://server_name \nIt is actually using sftp (you could have typed sftp://server_name) so setting up ssh keys is recommended over passwords, but not required.  \nNautilus may be installed on your distro already.  If not, you can install it by:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus\n\nadditionally, there are other things nautilus can do like connect to owncloud, dropbox and much more.  For these two:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-owncloud\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-dropbox\n\nIn general look at the list from the command apt-cache dumpavail | grep Package | grep nautilus to see how extensible it is.  I note the nautilus scripting capability.\nI suspect that most file managers have similar functionality.\n\n\n*Filezilla which is extremely well explained in an answer above.\n\n*gftp has gui functionality that is winscp like, as well.  To install:\nsudo apt-get install gftp-gtk\n\n*sftp - although not a gui it is worth mentioning.  You can connect a remote file system over the commandline using sftp.  By default this capability is enabled for all users in ubuntu if sftp is installed.  \n\n*sshfs -- then use any file manager -- my fav.  Sshfs is a user space tool for mounting directories on remote servers over ssh. You do not need to be root, just create a directory in your home directory and mount to it, e.g. mkdir ~/data\nInstalling sshfs:\nsudo apt-get install sshfs\n\nExamples of mounting remote directories:\nsshfs user@server /local/mount/point\nsshfs  me@datarepo.com:subdir/another_sub_dir  ~/data`\n\nBrowse the mounted directory with your file manager.  To remove this mount:\nfusermount -u /local/mount/point\n\nRemember the local mount point (directory) must exist before you can mount on it -- just like nfs.\nFinally, I'm not providing KDE programs since Ubuntu is largely a gnome based file system.\n\nA: Try using sshfs.\nsudo apt-get install sshfs - This command will install sshfs for you.\nThen you just need to mount your ssh directory in your local filesystem, like this:\nsshfs user@server:/path/to/remote/dir /path/to/local/dir\nWhere the local dir is the place you wish to mount your remote files.\nYou can then browse your remote files using PCManFM.\nHope this works for you.\nPS - You can unmount the remote directory like this:\nfusermount -u /path/to/local/dir\n", "Q: Difference between ls -l , ls -ltr and ll?

What I need, is both displays to have a window manager, and to have Compositing to enabled on the primary display. \nPS:\nI have decided on 2 X-screens is because the monitors are driven by two different Nvidia graphics cards, so from what I gather compositing would require separate X-screens. \nI have previously had success with gnome-classic + Xinerama, which allows a single large X-screen covering both monitors but with no compositing. \n\nPS\nMy /etc/X11/xorg.conf has:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 1920 0\n    Screen      1  \"Screen1\" LeftOf \"Screen0\"\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\nAnd\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"Stereo\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DVI-I-1: nvidia-auto-select +1080+0 {rotation=left}\"\n    Option         \"SLI\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"MultiGPU\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"BaseMosaic\" \"off\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen1\"\n    Device         \"Device1\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor1\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"Stereo\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    Option         \"SLI\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"MultiGPU\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"BaseMosaic\" \"off\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nWhere Device0 is a \"Quadro FX 580\" and Device1 is a \"GeForce 8600 GT\".\n\nA: I do not think you can run the same window manager at the same time, on the same user, on two X servers.

Just modify the find command to run it instead:\nfind allen-p ... zufferli-j -maxdepth 1 -type d -execdir python \"$PWD\"/file.py \\;\n\nThe -execdir option runs the command inside each directory. We use $PWD to give the full path to the script, so that a changing working directory doesn't affect where the command looks for the script.\nHowever, since you have copied it anyway, you can skip the $PWD:\nfind allen-p ... zufferli-j -maxdepth 1 -type d -execdir python file.py \\;\n\n\nNote\nYou didn't provide a type check in your find command (like I did with -type d above). Without it, every file in those directories has now been overwritten with file.py. You only want to copy to (and run in) directories, so you should have added a -type d to it.\n\nA: You could also write a loop that moves into each directory and runs the script before moving back:\nfor dir in allen-p fischer-m ... solberg-g; do\n    cd \"$d\" && /path/to/python/script.py && ../\ndone\n\nNote that this will fail if the python script fails in any of the directories. \n", "Q: Scanner problem - Espon Stylus NX420 All-In-One I have an Epsom NX420 all-in-one printer.

So far I haven't found any solution to this, and I think everyone who's experiencing this issue would be really grateful to someone who has a solution for this.\n\nA: Use a smarter shell, like zsh:\n\nNote how it added a % to indicate the lack of a newline and printed the prompt on a different line.\n\nA: Just hit CtrlL. That will redraw your terminal and make everything appear as it should:\n\n\nA: This can be done with bash too. The trick is to use a custom PROMPT_COMMAND that queries the terminal for the position of the cursor (as per this question ).\nThis solution can probably be extended to other shells, but I'm only familiar with bash. (See @muru 's answer for a zsh solution). And perhaps there is already an option in bash to do this automatically.\nPut this in your .bashrc:\nfunction new.line.if.not.on.left {\n    local foo\n    local garbage\n    local column\n    echo -n -e \"\\033[6n\"     # as the terminal for the position\n    read -s -d \\[ garbage    # ignore the first part of the response\n    read -s -d R foo         # store the position in foo\n    column=\"$(echo \"$foo\" | cut -d';' -f2)\"    # skip over the row number\n    test \"$column\" \"!=\" 1 && { tput smso; echo \"%\"; tput rmso; }\n}\n\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\"new.line.if.not.on.left; $PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\nThe last line prepends a call to new.line.if.not.on.left to your PROMPT_COMMAND (as you may already have a PROMPT_COMMAND defined).\nThe bash function new.line.if.not.on.left works as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo -n -e \"\\033[6n\" is a piece of magic that asks the terminal about the row and column of the cursor's current position. The terminal \"responds\" by sending fake keyboard input with the answer.\n\n*read -s -d \\[ garbage. The first part of the response is some gibberish, some sort of escape code. Ignore it by storing it in garbage.\n\n*read -s -d R foo . Store the fake keyboard response in bash variable foo. The -s is needed to stop read from echoing the input to the screen again. And -d R is the delimiter - the fake input is terminated by an R, not by a newline as you might expect.\n\n*column=\"$(echo \"$foo\" | cut -d';' -f2)\" extracts the column number from the response (i.e. skipping over the row number) and stores the result in column\n\n*test \"$column\" \"!=\" 1 && { tput smso; echo \"%\"; tput rmso; } If the current column number is not 1, then print the percent sign (and a newline). The tput commands turn on \"stand out mode\" - which should make the % stand out more - perhaps bold or perhaps by reversing the background and foreground colours.\n\n", "Q: Problem running backup script at shutdown Ubuntu 14.04.2 I want to run a script at shutdown, and a far as I can tell I've followed the proper procedures.

Same old story with driver support issues, etc. The solution I have currently is one traditional extension monitor and another running from a USB converter, which isn't ideal. My question is ... is there a way I can run a host (in this case my ubuntu laptop) and connect to it via VNC and using the VNC connection add as many monitors as I have access to on the \"windows\" VNC client? The problem I see with this from what I have read is that the host needs to know about all the monitors prior to the VNC connection... not after. \nI figured this might be a creative way for me to finally have 2-3 (or more) monitors connected to ubuntu laptop without all fighting with drivers and poor performance when attaching displays to USB adapters. \nI'm not worried about speed with VNC, it would all be local network traffic.\nA bit of research\nhttps://support.realvnc.com/knowledgebase/article/View/379/6/how-do-i-map-multiple-vnc-viewer-monitors-to-multiple-vnc-server-monitors\nhttps://support.realvnc.com/Knowledgebase/Article/View/341/12/can-i-view-only-one-of-the-displays-of-my-multiple-monitor-computer?\n\nA: If a USB video adapter is \"less than ideal\" for performance reasons, unless it's strictly a USB bus bottleneck that's the problem, there probably are no other ways to add the same number of monitors with acceptable performance, at least not if there's a lot of motion.  That said, here's one way to essentially have as many monitors \"attached\" to that laptop as you want, all under the control of a single keyboard & mouse, without requiring specialized hardware:\nSet up VNC on the laptop so that when you log in it's connecting to its own separate X server (vs. the :0 display that's currently driving your monitors).  Now you can set up addition computers.  From each of them, you can open a VNC session (with its own independent X desktop session) and run it full-screen.  (You could also directly use X via LTSP or otherwise or any other remote control method to connect to the X sessions; just get them on the screen.  With VNC, your other computers don't even have to be running Linux.) Okay, great.  Now you have 25 displays next to each other, but you also 25 kbd/mice pairs. Now what?\nFirst, install VNC on each of the other computers.  Verify that you can connect to each of them and see the desktop they're displaying.  So from the laptop you can VNC to another machine, and see the \"private\" desktop that's being generated on your own laptop, but displayed on the other machine's monitor and also in your own VNC client window.  Okay, now we know that's working.  It's still not what you want, so here comes the next step.\nEnter \"x2vnc\".  Basically it's a VNC client that sends kbd/mouse events, but doesn't bother to get video back.  Instead of a traditional client window (which you activate so that it knows to send the mouse/kbd events to the remote machine instead of your local session) you configure it so that it's activated when you move the mouse to the edges of your screen.  You could have it connect either to the machines that are displaying your extra desktops or to the vnc servers running on your own laptop that they're connected to.\nIn any case, the x2vnc magic makes it so that you can have a monitor attached to a remote computer sitting to the right of your main one, and when you move your mouse past the right edge of your screen, it magically keeps going from the left of the righthand monitor as if it were a dual display, when in reality you're controling the other computer (which in this case is in turn controlling a desktop session on your own machine).  It keeps track of where the mouse is so that when you come back left your pointer reappears on your local display at the right time and place so the whole thing feels very natural.\nIt's been a while since I've played w/ x2vnc.  I know it's flexible, but I don't know how.  In this way, though, you could have at least 4 other machines you're connecting to: top, bottom, left, right edges of the screen.  And, of course, if one of your other machines has 2 monitors and lets you span the VNC viewer across the two of them, then that lets you go further away from your local central display.  For that matter, you could probably run x2VNC (win2VNC on Windows machines) on one remote machine so that it would then control another as you kept moving the same direction; this would allow you to have a long chain of monitors in one direction, each one adding another layer to the a-controls-b-which-controls-c-which-controls-d-which-views-a2 chain.   Hundreds of monitors!\nOf course, with multiple independent X servers running, you're still not going to be able to smoothly transfer windows across sessions (though I almost seem to remember an app that would kinda let you do that, acting as a broker between apps and multiple X servers).  If you instead configured the other machines as \"fat clients\" (using LTSP) you could it so that you're at least semi-synchronized app-wise to your notebook (You have to periodically update your fat client image to keep it in sync with what you have installed) while utilizing the CPU/Mem on the other machines to lighten your load that way on the laptop.\nSeems like an awful lot of infrastructure for a laptop, though!\n", "Q: Video editing software So I have finally figured out how to record videos without any frame drops and such.

A minor problem (not really a problem at all), and more of just a curious question. Is there any way to change the description of boot options in Refind? I'm using it to triple boot my Mac, and the OS X and Windows entries have nice descriptions; they just say \"Boot OS X from Macintosh HD,\" or something like that, whereas my Ubuntu option says \"Boot EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi from EFI,\" which doesn't look as nice. I understand the value of knowing exactly what you're booting (it's helped me solve problems in the past), but is there any way, just for the sake of looks in the menu itself, I could change that?\n\nA: Yes, there is. Your description is a little thin on information. I don't think I can give a complete answer based on what I have read. Basically, you add a manual entry in refind.conf and add line to remove the option with the ugly label. I assume you are looking for something like this. (Click on image for a better view.)\n\nTo produce the above menu, I added the following lines to the default refind.conf file.

I have tried executing this file with every possible alternative but still no luck.chmod +x file.sh, ./file.sh and also checked permissions window everything looks fine. \nerror looks like this --> sh: 0: Can't open ./file_name.sh\n\nA: When you execute a .sh file using ./, assuming that the permissions allow it, you are saying to the operating system to execute the file with that name in the present working directory.\nSo to run the file using ./file.sh make sure you use cd to get to the directory containing the script file, before attempting to run the script.\nIf you're not in that directory, you can use the entire file path to run the script. If however the script is in a directory listed in your user's $PATH, then just typing the name of the script file would execute it, just like all the regular commands such as cd, ls etc.\n\nA: If file.sh is a bash script you should set the shebang on the first line of the script.\nIt should look like this: first hash mark then exclamation mark and then path to the interpreter (bash, ksh...)\n    #!/bin/bash\n", "Q: GRUB2 issue after removing windows and reinstalling ubuntu Short version\nCannot restore EFI partition with boot repair. Create a proper partition AND put a /EFI/ folder into it, then used boot repair\nOriginal question\nI originally had a dual boot with win 8 on it. Deleting it also bricked my EFI boot partition. I eventually reinstalled Ubuntu 14.04 via a live USB as my kernel images were ruined by boot-repair, hoping this would also fix the boot, but that didn't work.\nMy current partition status:\n\nwhere sda3 is the former windows partition, and sda6 contains data (backed up). sda2 holds my ubuntu install.\nedit\nI removed sda1 and placed the bios_grub flagged partition at the start of the disk, reinstalled grub and updated, but to no avail\n/edit\nMy current boot status is given here:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/11774252/\nDespite this, if I boot without my live usb in, I only get a black (non grub) screen stating that all boot option have been tried.\nI can manually boot the sda2 ubuntu by running grub from the usb key in UEFI mode, pressing c to get the CLI interface, and using\ngrub> linux (hd1,gpt2)/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2\ngrub> initrd (hd1,gpt2)/initrd.img\ngrub> boot\n\nThen, I tried both using boot-repair and installing grub manually by\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\nboth end up fine with no errors, but I still get the black screen.\nAlso, I am unable to boot the system manually if a run my grub on the usb key in non UEFI mode, since I cannot reach the Command Line Interface in this case (holding shift leads to a crappy grub GUI and I am stuck there).\n\nA: I managed to solve it , it was pretty silly.\nI used boot-repair to restore the EFI partition. \nI created a FAT32 partition of 230mb at the head of the disk and flagged it as boot using gparted. After this, the boot-repair was still complaining about missing the EFI partition (\"Your system boot is in efi mode but no efi partition was found. You might want to try again after creating a efi partition(fat32,~100-200mb,head of disk, boot flag)\"\nApparently, it is not enough to have the partition as required by the error message. So just did this:\nsudo mount /dev/sda4 /media\nsudo mkdir /media/EFI\n\nthen boot repair correctly found sda4 to be the partition to installe the EFI grub and all worked fine.\nI don't know if it is relevant, but I also installed the package grub-efi-amd64-signed at some point.\n", "Q: When creating a launcher item in 15.04, what is the significance of quotes in the file path?

It should be:\nExec=/home/aortiz49/\"Application Data\"/Sublime_Text_2/sublime_text\n\nThe reason is that the Exec= line represents a command, which will interpret what comes after the space as an argument, while the line Icon= represents a path to the icon.\n", "Q: Installation problem of oracle java 8 How to move move the extracted folder of jdk-8u20-linux-x64.tar.gz in to  /usr/lib/jvm while installing oracle java in ubuntu 14.04.?\n\nA: Using a PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\nand then\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default\n\n", "Q: Emacs on phone (e.g. BQ or Meizu) Is Emacs available on Ubuntu phones such as BQ or Meizu?\nI heavily use a personalized orgmode (http://www.orgmode.org) as a kind of calendar with a wide range of applications such as running code snippets and planning tasks and so on.\nI would love to have the calendar on the phone.\n\nIf Emacs is not available for phones is it at least possible to compile it on the phone or to cross-compile it on the computer for the phone?

He attempted to shrink the partition but could not, so he downloaded another program to shrink but I think he messed up and lost the OS.\nSo to rectify I told him to install Ubuntu but he wants to dual boot as he is a gamer.\nI put Windows installation disk back in but it said NTFS files missing message.\nSo downloaded GParted but his drives are locked, I tried to format to NTFS in the disk utility which seemed to work, but now when we put the Windows disk in for booting we are getting a black screen with a flashing cursor.\nWe are really stuck as to what to do now, it may be down to the fact that the partitions are locked. I know the OS has to be locked but can't unlock the other partition.\nWould installing  Linux mint rectify this problem?\n\nA: There may be a couple options you can go with, but first I would be sure to check the partitions again. \nIf you boot your computer up using Ubuntu on a live USB, and open GParted what do you see as partitions? Normally on a Windows machine you will see the following:\n\n/dev/sda -\n\n/dev/sda1 ntfs xGiB\n\n/dev/sda2 ntfs xxxGib\n\n\n\nThese sould be the normal windows partitions. If the partitions were deleted you may see something like:\n\n/dev/sda -\n\n/dev/sda1 unallocated xxxGib\n\n\nIf you see the latter then the partitions were deleted and there is no more trace of the previous OS.\nI have come across the issue before and since I have installation media I just booted up with Windows 8.1 on a USB drive and reinstalled it. Then if you still want to dual boot with Ubuntu you can shrink the ntfs volume then install ubuntu.\nIt sounds like your son may have erased the partitions when he was trying to shrink them. It would be hard to tell without a screen shot of the partitions in GParted.\n\nThe locked partitions means they are mounted. I would ensure you have a LiveUSB or CD to boot from and follow some of the advice in either of these posts:\nCannot Format Delete Locked Partition from Gparted\nHow to Unlock Partition in Gparted\nI would suggest looking at these two posts to see if you can figure out how to unlock the volumes to be able to boot, and fix your system.\n\nA: The message about the missing NTFS files and the blinking cursor after the successful formatting of the partition both point toward the fact that you're not booting from the Ubuntu Live CD / DVD but from the hard drive instead.\nMost recent laptops (or laptops using a recent enough BIOS) usually have a dedicated key to choose the boot device upon startup overriding the BIOS' settings; if this is not present, the other solution is to boot into the BIOS and to set the CD / DVD-ROM drive as the first boot device, saving the settings and booting from the Live CD / DVD to start the installation.\n", "Q: running command on remote host by ssh fails when running inside script The Situation: \nMy Computer runs on Kubuntu 14.04.\nI am Admin of a Students House with some Netgear-APs.\nThe idea is to have a script rebooting them all by one script.\n(ssh-key isn't posible)\nThe Problem in short: \nssh command on host runs fine from shell.

Also I would create a LiveUSB boot drive with either MBR/UEFI or GPT/UEFI with Rufus when building from an Ubuntu ISO.\nWhen that's finished, press the Window Key on the keyboard (or click the window/start button), and type \"recovery opt\" and hit enter. Select Advanced Startup, the system will boot into a console, select 'Use a device' or 'boot to a device' and you should see your UEFI USB boot disk you just created if its plugged in... make sure you are using USB 3.0 port and not the USB 2.0 port and reboot to your UEFI thumb drive, and install Ubuntu. The Ubuntu install script will detect your are booting in UEFI mode and install Ubuntu/Grub boot loader as UEFI compatible. Legacy Bios mode on these Toshiba Satellite series (L15W) do not work very well at all.\nWhen doing this, Windows will still want to be the primary bootloader, so you have to keep going into Win 10, then recovery console, and then booting from device, choosing Ubuntu, every time you want to use Ubuntu until you change the order in which boot loader is attempted to load first by Toshiba.\nYou can use this software to switch GRUB2 to be loaded before the Windows boot manager:\nhttp://www.easyuefi.com/index-us.html\nBut this is the least of your worries. These Toshiba series (L15W) have hard freezes in Linux at seemingly random times (all distro's I have installed have the same issue, either debian based or rpm based, so it most likely is a kernel issue with how it deals with the Toshiba-wmi and Toshiba_ACPI kernel modules in Linux). I posted a temporary work around in a few posts today, hoping others who own these same series of Toshiba laptops will report the bug as well when (not if) they run into it.\n(I have had 3 replacements with the vendor so far because of this issue, and they all have had this issue, I can't seem to find anyone out there that can get this laptop to work in Linux without hard freezes/lockups, without setting up CPU thermal triggers to lower the CPU frequency.. (Linux cannot turn on the chassis fan inside, let alone even find it. Works fine in Windows 10 though).\n\nA: I own a Toshiba Satellite L15W-B1302 currently running Ubuntu 15.04, using Gnome. I had a lot of issues installing Ubuntu on my laptop until I found that I needed to uncheck secure boot in BIOS. Before I did this, the only time it would boot was from the liveUSB I was using to install. At first I tried to dual boot and figured this might be the issue, then I wiped windows 8.1 completely (after saving the recovery disk on another thumb drive). That's when I found a thread (I didn't save it as I as using the live version at the time) that told me to turn off secure boot. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Brother MFC-6490cw driver?

You can just delete the Ubuntu partition(s) in the process.  If you don't have a recovery partition you'll need a Windows install disk. Either you have such a disk, which you don't or you'll have to buy a new one.

Uhh, for me nothing as a normal user:\ncat: /var/spool/mail/root: No such file or directory\n\nAnd the same with sudo. For me, there is no /var/spool/mail/root\n\nIt turns out, Ubuntu is different - by default root's mail goes to /dev/null, or the black hole in your computer.\nTo find our logs, we need to look in\n/var/log/auth.log\n\nAnd lo and behold, a sudo cat gives us this line:\nJun 25 22:45:07 Hairy14 sudo:  nonsudo : user NOT in sudoers ; TTY=pts/21 ; PWD=/home/tim ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/hello\n\nNote that sometimes (e.g. if your account has no password, is disabled) it will simply not let you run the command - but it will still be reported in the same way:\nJun 25 22:44:17 Hairy14 sudo:  nonsudo : user NOT in sudoers ; TTY=pts/21 ; PWD=/home/tim ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/hello\n\nNote that there is a lot of other text along with the \"naughty\" reports.

It's only helpful if the reported incident has happened just recently.\nGNOME Logs\nAnother way to find such incidents is to use the default Logs application, which is installed by default on recent Ubuntu releases.

I have application using QML and C++  and want to start C++ function from javascript . Is it possible ?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible.\nWhat you need to do is create a plugin.  This will allow you to import a C++ object (and only objects!) into your QML namespace.  Since you want a C++ function, you'll have to make a \"dummy\" object with a method that just calls the C++ function you desire.\nTo do this, you'll need to create two classes.  One will be a class for that dummy object mentioned above.  The second will inherit from QQmlExtensionPlugin and must call qmlRegisterType for the first class.\nThis has just been an overview -- for more details, see the Qt documentation.  I've also written up and example of a QML plugin to read a file, which should be fairly close to what you'll need.\n", "Q: Ubuntu USB error I am trying to make a portable Ubuntu USB.

The netbook is from ASUS, though I forget the exact model, and there may have been water damage. Solutions?\nEDIT: I have recently found out that I can type the symbol or capital letter by letting go of the shift key first before letting go of the symbol/letter key. For example, to type a capital R, I have to hold down the shift key, then hold down the R key, then release the shift key.\n\nA: I don't know if your machine has a dual boot, but I had the same issue. Both my Shift keys suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason  while I was using Linux.\nThe way I fixed it was booting in Windows and deactivating the Sticky Keys shortcut (that gets activated by pressing Shift 5 times, or holding Shift for some seconds).

I'm hoping that Ubuntu manages fan speeds automatically  based on heat if not could u please explain to me how to set my fan speeds to high \n\nA: The ACPI spec provides mechanisms for the firmware to describe to the OS how to control the fan speed and measure the temperature, and at what temperature it should change the fan speed, allowing the OS to tweak things as it chooses.  Unfortunately, no vendors that I have seen follow the spec, and instead of leaving control to the OS, they just manage the fan speed with dedicated hardware controllers that lie outside the knowledge of the OS.\n\nA: That's not a matter of managing by the operating system. There's a thermal sensor in the computer that's operating independent of the OS. You'll notice this if there's something wrong with the heatsink of your CPU. Then the CPU starts to get hot very fast. If it gets too hot it might be damaged but it doesn't because the computer will switch off immediately without even starting the OS. The thermal sensor protects the CPU against overheating and it controls the speed of the fan too. Other components like the videocard might have a similar system.\n", "Q: Are there any Linux programs that can easily write and edit interlinear text?

The various lines should line up their respective words, with \"Claudius/Κλαύδιος\" having enough space after them that \"Galenus (Galen)/Γαληνός\" starts at an equal spot. Footnotes or marginal annotations are also necessary. As little time as possible should be spent manually adjusting the formatting, with it still being readable.\nFor a \"formatted\" version of the imagined results, subbing dashes for spaces (word order is nonsense; was pressed for time):  \nGalenus (Galen)--Claudius--Rocks  \nΓαληνός----------Κλαύδιος--πετρω  \nnom. sg.---------nom. sg.--voc. dl.  \n\nIn this instance I had to type in the spaces myself, but I'm looking for a program that will do that for me. Another difficulty is making the different types of content align on new lines; doing this sort of text manually, then adjusting the margins, can give you:  \nGalenus (Galen)--Claudius  \n--Rocks Γαληνός----------  \nΚλαύδιος--πετρω nom. sg.-  \n--------nom. sg.--voc.   \ndl.  \n\nWhich is obviously not acceptable to the user's needs.\n\nA: I've never used it myself, but it looks like mule is designed to handle this.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MULE\n\nMULE is the MULtilingual Enhancement to GNU Emacs.\nMULE provides facilities not only for handling text written in many different languages (at least 42 character sets, 53 coding sets, 128 input methods, and 58 languages[1]), but in fact multilingual texts containing several languages in the same buffer.\n\n\nA: There's a very simple answer to this: Use LibreOffice Calc!

When I type vi into terminal, VIM starts up. But when I type vim into terminal, the terminal says The program 'vim' can be found in the following packages: and lists different varieties of vim, as if I don't have vim installed. Is there a reason for this? Is the vi that comes with ubuntu not the same as VIM?\n\nA: Well, you do have vim installed, but a minimal version of it called vim-tiny. If you run vim.tiny, you'll find it runs. This version has very few features enabled, and therefore doesn't provide the vim command.

I only have Intel and Nvidia. Also, when I install this AMD version on my computer, it works (other than the constant random freezing of the computer when I use Ubuntu). I don't really understand why the amd version works on a computer with an intel processor. \n\nA: You are confusing the name of the processor architecture: \"amd64\" with the brand of processor.\nCurrent Intel processors run the \"amd64\" processor architecture. The architecture is named that because it was initially invented by AMD (or at least, the 64-bit extensions were).\nThe correct architecture for your CPU is \"amd64\".

I dual booted Ubuntu with Windows 7. I dual booted by shrinking my drive to 45 GB. This was for ubuntu. After I dual booted, I noticed that there was a small primary partition. I found out that this small partition is my SWAP partition. So now I have 1 system partition and 2 primary partitions. I was told by someone else that the SWAP partition should be in a extended partition. I was wondering if I dual booted incorrectly and I should go back and put ubuntu in a extended partition?\n\nA: The only reason you would need extended and logical partitions is if you have more than 4 partitions.  If you have 4 or less, they can all be primary partitions.\n\nI was told by someone else that the SWAP partition should be in a extended partition.\n\nThis is false.  I don't know what they were thinking of.\nWhether a partition is primary or not (or for that matter, the partition number) makes no difference to Ubuntu.  The existence of extended partitions merely exists to facilitate having more than 4 partitions on a traditional MBR (DOS) partition structure.\n\nA: The swap partition is a part of the shrinked partition , on installing Ubuntu if swap partition is not created by user , it is automatically created by the Ubuntu installer in the shrinked partition.\n                THAT MEANS YOU HAVE CORRECTLY DUAL BOOTED CORRECTLY\n\n", "Q: Is there a GUI Keyboard Remapper App?

I want to install another linux OS and Mac OS X. \n\nA: First, you can't have 5 primary partitions!!! The max number of primary partitions would be 4 Unless you use GPT, and choosing 4 primary partitions is not that smart idea in general as you'll not be able to add new partitions if needed, instead you should use extended partition that may include many logical partitions.\nNow For having triple or quad boot,a simple answer is yes you can do, but always you have to think in order, windows must be installed before Linux since Windows bootloader will not discover your *NIX, while GRUB could easily discover other OS.\nThose are some links that would help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I triple-boot Ubuntu, Fedora and Windows 7?\n\n*http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2014/06/05/triple-boot-windows-7-and-8-and-ubuntu-14-04-on-a-pc-with-uefi-firmware/\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/155396/how-to-have-triple-boot-linux-mint-17-cinnamon-ubuntu-14-04-windows-8\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook/TripleBoot\n\nA: Yes ... more than a dual boot is OK as far as multiple linux OS\nalthough lately I have not attempted to cut an OSX alongside the others\n... as a side note I have tripple booted my nexus 4 mobile :  \nubuntu 15 / firefox OS / lollipop \n\nanother approach would be to use a vmware like tool to cut various OS partitions from within your ubuntu\n\nA: As others have said, it is possible. Before you go too far down that road, though, you must ascertain whether you're booting in BIOS mode with MBR or in EFI mode with GPT. It looks like you're probably BIOS/MBR, unless the Windows partitioning tool is hiding your ESP. To be 100% sure, check this page of mine, which presents more details on boot modes. Which boot mode you're using determine which boot loader options are available to you -- and as others have said, the partition table type determines what limits you have on number of partitions.\nBeyond that, I must advise against booting more than a couple of OSes directly on a computer. Whether in BIOS or EFI, multi-booting creates complications on the boot process, and those can be difficult to overcome unless you're an expert on the subject. It gets harder the more OSes you add. It's often possible to stumble through it by following a well-written guide or by sheer dumb luck, but a better option is often virtualization. Pick your most important OS (or maybe two) and run it natively, then run everything else in virtual machines. This simplifies each OS's boot setup, and you can even mix-and-match BIOS vs. EFI boots. Personally, I mostly use VirtualBox in Linux, but others like VMware, KVM/QEMU, or other tools.\n", "Q: wifi is not working in my ASUS laptop on ubuntu 12.04 I have installed ubuntu 12.04 with windows 7 on my ASUS laptop, the wireless connection is working in windows but not in ubuntu, only wired connection is working in ubuntu.

By clicking \"System settings -> Time & Date -> Automatically from the Internet\" I can synchronize time from the Internet. \nHowever, I find that I don't have a ntpd daemon (It's not even installed). So how does the synchronization work?\n\nA: This is done by synchronizing with  ntpdate tool.\nman ntpdate\nNAME\n       ntpdate - set the date and time via NTP\n\nntpdate sets the local date and time by polling the Network Time Proto‐\n       col (NTP) server(s) given as the server arguments to determine the cor‐\n       rect time. It must be run as root on the local host (unless the  option\n       -q  is used). A number of samples are obtained from each of the servers\n       specified and a subset of the NTP clock filter and selection algorithms\n       are  applied  to  select  the best of these. Note that the accuracy and\n       reliability of ntpdate depends on the number of servers, the number  of\n       polls each time it is run and the interval between runs.\n\n       ntpdate  can  be run manually as necessary to set the host clock, or it\n       can be run from the host startup script to set the clock at boot  time.\n       This is useful in some cases to set the clock initially before starting\n       the NTP daemon ntpd. It is also possible to run  ntpdate  from  a  cron\n       script.  However,  it  is important to note that ntpdate with contrived\n       cron scripts is no substitute for the NTP daemon, which uses  sophisti‐\n       cated  algorithms to maximize accuracy and reliability while minimizing\n       resource use. Finally, since ntpdate does not discipline the host clock\n       frequency as does ntpd, the accuracy using ntpdate is limited.\n\nYou can do so with \nsudo ntpdate TIME-SERVER\n\nTIME-SERVER lists can be founded here\n\nA: Ubuntu synchronises with the ntpdate utility once each time the network connection comes up (which usually happens when you boot).\nThis utility is installed by default, but only runs when Ubuntu calls it and does not stay running in the background as a daemon.\nInstalling the ntp package installs the NTP daemon.  The ntp daemon allows for the time to be continually synchronised while the system is running.\n\nUpdate: in recent versions of Ubuntu (eg 16.04) ntpdate is replaced by timedatectl, which synchonises once on boot as well as when a network comes up, but does not keep running at other times. See https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html for more.\n\nA: Note also that it is entirely possible for there to be a front-end interface, to a service which is not installed.\nYou can change the settings in that front-end (GUI) interface all you want, but if the service that actually performs the tasks isn't installed, nothing will happen.\nNote however, that I think the \"switch\" is valid because it tells it to do the one-time update at EACH boot. (or to not do so).\nUnless this is a not-network connected system, or there is some other overriding reason to NOT have its time set to match \"standard\" time, I would strongly urge you to install ntpd, and properly configure and run it.\n\nA: Refer to: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime\nUbuntu comes with ntpdate as standard, and will run it once at boot time to set up your time according to Ubuntu's NTP server. However, a system's clock is likely to drift considerably between reboots if the time between reboots is long. In that case it makes sense to correct the time occasionally. The easiest way to do this is to get cron to run it every day. \nntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com\n\n\nA: For those of you with 16.04 LTS time sync appears to be handled by sytemd specifically \"timedatectl\"\ntimedatectl status\nLocal time: Wed 2016-11-30 17:45:18 CST\nUniversal time: Wed 2016-11-30 23:45:18 UTC\nRTC time: Sun 2016-12-04 06:50:39\nTime zone: America/Chicago (CST, -0600)\nNetwork time on: yes\nNTP synchronized: yes\nRTC in local TZ: no\n\nConfig is\n/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf\n\nMore info here: Time Synchronisation with NTP\nAND timedatectl\n\nA: For some reason, on 16.04, Maythux's answer doesn't work straight away.\nBut taking the lead from there, this worked for me.\n$ sudo ntpdate-debian\n\nPlease note that it requires sudo privilege, obviously.  \nUnder the hood, it uses ntpdate tool, differing only the config file.\n\nntpdate-debian  is  identical  to  ntpdate(8)  except  that  it  uses  the  configuration  in /etc/default/ntpdate by default. ntpdate sets the local date and time by polling Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.\n\n\nA: Well the later Ubuntu releases often do it using chrony which is an alternative implementation of ntp with some differences:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Some of the more rarely used ntp features are not implemented\n\n*It attempts to cope well with the situation where you have intermittent network access - When connected, it syncs the local clock and tracks how fast it drifts.

Also make sure that this location of libwx_baseu_xml is in the library search path in /etc/ld.so.conf\nYou can update the libraries by simply executing the following command:\n\nsudo ldconfig\n\nIn most cases this should solve the problem.\n\nA: Besides Ron's answer, you may also use the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to temporarily set additional paths for the dynamic linker to search the shared libraries in non-standard locations:\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH\n          A  list of directories in which to search for ELF libraries at\n          execution-time.

There is also typically an rc.inet1 script to set up networking (in Slackwar), an rc.modules script to load modular device drivers, and an rc.local script that can be edited to run commands desired by the administrator, along the lines of autoexec.bat in DOS.\n/etc/rc.d/init.d -- contains most of the initialization scripts themselves on an rpm-based system.\n/etc/rc.d/rc*.d -- where \"*\" is a number corresponding to the default run level. Contains files for services to be started and stopped at that run level. On rpm-based systems, these files are symbolic links to the initialization scripts themselves, which are in /etc/rc.d/init.d.\n/etc/skel -- directory containing several example or skeleton initialization shells. Often contains subdirectories and files used to populate a new user's home directory.\n/etc/X11 -- configuration files for the X Window system\n/home -- locally stored user files and folders\n/lib -- system libraries (similar to Program Files)\n/lost+found -- lost and found for lost files\n/media -- mounted (or loaded) devices such as cdroms, digital cameras, etc.\n/mnt -- mounted file systems\n/opt -- location for “optionally” installed programs\n/proc -- dynamic directory including information about and listing of processes\n/root -- “home” folder for the root user\n/sbin -- system-only binaries (see /bin)\n/sys -- contains information about the system\n/tmp -- temporary files\n/usr -- applications mainly for regular users\n/var -- mainly logs, databases, etc.\n/usr/local/bin -- the place to put your own programs.

I have a multi-purpose printer (scanner/printer/copier) Canon MG5650. I can now print wirelessly, how can I add it as a scanner to Ubuntu?\n\nA: You need nightly version of sane. You can compile it yourself or install it from this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~rolfbensch/+archive/ubuntu/sane-git\nYou can add this repository and upgrade sane this way (in terminal):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:rolfbensch/sane-git\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nYou might need to do sudo apt-get install -f to fix some dependency problems.\nIf you don’t have sane already installed, you can do this after adding this PPA by:\nsudo apt-get install xsane sane\n\nI have the same printer/scanner, and after installing nightly sane from this repository, I could easily use the scanner. When connected to the same network that the scanner is connected to, just run xsane (you should be able to find in applications menu) and let it discover your device from network.\nYou’ll also be able to use other sane-based tools for scanning, like xscanimage, skanlite etc. (even LibreOffice, you can find list of them here: http://www.sane-project.org/sane-frontends.html).\nYour all-in-one device should be visible in titlebar of those programs as pixma:MG5600_<ip_address>.\nOh, and most of those tools allow you to scan in 1200 dpi resolution. Don’t use it, the scanner is capable of maximum 600 dpi, anything greater will lead you to scrambled image acquired.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 freezes before installation I just installed Windows 8.1 on one partition and wanted to install Ubuntu 15.04 on another one.

For some reason it won't uninstall it until I go through the entire setup process, but I also messed that up as I just made 15 GB of unalocated space on the HDD.\nSo before I keep messing up could anyone help me on how to revert these changes and properly do the partition for Ubuntu?\nThere are so many tutorials that I don't know which one would be the most reliable one.\n\nA: You can follow this: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop\nAt the fourth step, select \"Erase Disk and Install Ubuntu\", assuming you wish to wipe the entire 1TB disk and install Ubuntu to it. Use the drop-down menu to select which drive you wish to install Ubuntu to.

If I boot from another computer, the drive is missing so I get dropped to a recovery console and have to comment out that line on the fstab and reboot.\nI normally work around this by having 2 user accounts, one for \"home\" and one for \"away\", and mount the disk on autologin items for one account and not the other. \nThe command I use to mount for my \"home\" account is:\n\nudisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sda1\n\nHowever this is missing the switches I want.\n(defaults,noatime,commit=300,autodefrag)\nIs there a way to parse these switches into the mount command via the CLI for a btrfs volume?\nKind regards\nPete\n\nA: If you want to use udisksctl, you can use the --options flag to specify what options to mount with. In your case, the command will be udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sda1 --options \"defaults,noatime,commit=300,autodefrag\" (the quotes might not be needed, but they are there just to be safe).\nNote that only safe options will be passed through to the mount command; options such as suid and dev will be rejected. (See also the man page for udisksctl.)\nThat being said, you might want to modify your /etc/fstab file so that the 500GB file isn't considered \"important\" enough to stop booting.

I think I have accidentally messed up my Ubuntu, I wanted to remove TOR so I did\nsudo apt-get remove tor*\nThat selected a lot of files, which I think is unrelated to the anonymity network. So I ended up deleting files that other packages need. How can I make a scan for the missing dependencies I have removed?\n\nA: I believe the command you seek is:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nThat should attempt to correct for any broken dependencies you have.\n\nA: As @steeldriver notes and you experienced, the dependencies won't help. But with a bit of luck you may find out what apt-get remove did by looking at the logs of apt to be found in /var/log/apt/term.log*, as aptly noted\nin this post. \nMore answers in the same thread point to further log files, e.g. /var/log/apt/history.log, which may be even easier to explore.\n", "Q: ltsp-server-standalone uninstallable on 12,04 I did a normal install of Ubuntu 12.04 using the Alt ISO.

I am compressing large PDF files (+10 MB in size) with GS using the following snippet:\ngs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=shrink.pdf large_2.pdf\n\nThe problem is it took around 5 - 10 minutes to compress a 35MB file to 10 MB's.\nIs this normal? I have an average machine, quad core - however I'm worried it'll be slow on the server as well. Is this fixed when I put it on a more powerful server? \nThe pdf I'm running compression on is National Aeronautics and Space Administration FY 2014 PRESIDENT’S BUDGET REQUEST SUMMARY (34 MB)\n\nA: I compressed the same file on my main Ubuntu desktop (15.04) and it took 49.401 seconds to complete. The machine has an Intel i5-4690k Quad-Core clocked at 3.9 GHz and 12GBs of Memory clocked at 1600MHz. During the compression it never maxed out more than one core and only ever used two cores at any given time.\nFor comparison I also ran it on my Mini-ITX machine (Ubuntu Server 15.04) and it took 3 minutes and 16.050 seconds to compress the file. This machine has an Intel J1800 Dual-Core Processor clocked at 2.41GHz and 4GBs of Memory clocked at 1333MHz.\nBelow is the output I got from running the time command in front of the gs command:\nUbuntu Desktop\nreal    0m49.401s\nuser    0m49.084s\nsys     0m0.208s\n\nMini-ITX Machine\nreal    3m16.050s\nuser    3m14.684s\nsys     0m0.924s\n\nAll of this suggests that a more powerful processor definitely makes a difference to the compression time but given that only two cores were used on my desktop machine I'd say clock speed is much more important to the compression time than number of cores but without knowing the exactly model of processor it is hard verity this against your setup.\n\nA: I used below commands but it didnt compress my pdf file substantially. Some times some of the portion was blackened after compression. \n\n\n*\n\n*gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf $INPUTFILE\n\n*\"ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook %s %s\" % (input_file_path, out_file_path) \nAfter too much wandering over the web I just couldn't find the right compression library.

It could be that the devices are returning static information back to\nthe driver and/or the fan speed is automatically being controlled by firmware\nusing System Management Mode in which case the kernel interfaces being examined\nmay not work anyway.\n\nI then ran lsmod | grep samsung and got this output:\nsamsung_laptop         14673  0   \nvideo                  20128  3 i915,samsung_laptop,nouveau\n\nSo it would seem I already have the module for Samsung loaded.  \nBy the way, output of ls /proc/acpi/ is:\nbutton  \nwakeup\n\n\nA: First of all Ubuntu is not Windows. Furthermore the speed of the fan is determined by a hardware sensor that detects the temperature and protects against overheating. I've written more detailed in this answer. So if the fan is running faster on Ubuntu then it is apprently necessary. You can't really influence the speed of the fan and you probably shouldn't do it either. According to a few claims there seems to be a relation with alleged faulty drivers but this remains largely unclear.\n\nA: You have nouveau open source video driver. It does not manage power well.\nAlso you probably have hybrid graphics and both your adapters work at the same time. That cause big power consumption and overheat.\nYou need to install a proprietary Nvidia driver and setup adapter switching by nvidia-prime or bumblebee.\nSo this is not a \"problem with fan\", but not good power management of the system. \n", "Q: Adding customized window size on the terminal I would like to add/modify custom size on the terminal\nRight now I have these:\n\nI would like to add my own personal window sizes, how can I do iT?\n\nA: You can define a new profile, and switch to the defined profile to change the window size.

How is that possible if the status of ufw is active and I close port 80? Does that mean that I am not enabling the new rules correctly?\n\nA: Running something like sudo ufw deny 80 means to block incoming connections to port 80 on your machine. It does not block outgoing connections on port 80. If you want to block HTTP, you'll need to block outgoing connections on port 80. Additionally, rules in UFW take effect immediately assuming UFW is enabled (check sudo ufw status for the current status and rules).\nUFW doesn't block access to ports from localhost; if it did so, there would be no reason to have that service installed, as nothing would be able to access it.\nNote that UFW has a fallback policy for each category of connections (incoming, outgoing, and routed) if there is no policy to handle that connection. see the \"Default\" line when running sudo ufw status verbose. By default, (I believe) all incoming and routed connections are blocked, and outgoing connections are allowed.\n", "Q: Diagnosing Slow Boot - 15.04 I've recently thrown Ubuntu onto my main rig as a dual boot.

I have also applied these steps to my own machine and verified that it works on my machine.  I do not endorse this as a generally accepted solution for all variants of this scenario.  This is a \"works for me\" solution I present and I realize that it may also work for others.  I would definitely familiarize yourself with grub before proceeding.\nThe Problem\nThe problem as noted is implicated in the following dmesg lines:\n\n[ 11.278410] hid-generic 0003:1B1C:1B11.0002: usb_submit_urb(ctrl) failed: -1\n...\n[ 21.334396] hid-generic 0003:1B1C:1B11.0003: timeout initializing reports\n\n\nThis is adding about 30 seconds to your boot-up time.  The device it is complaining about isn't the actual keyboard controller, rather, it's the keyboard LED back-light controller (which technically isn't a keyboard) and doesn't know what to do with it.  If your keyboard is like mine (I have the K70) then it has two USB cables, one for the back-light and the other for the keyboard.\nSolution - Add USB HID Probing Quirks for the Kernel\nRun the following command from terminal:\nlsusb | grep -i '1B1C:1B11'\n\nTo verify that the device that dmesg complains about is in-fact your Corsair K95 Keyboard.  Alternatively you can run lsusb -v | less and visually confirm that the report descriptors are unavailable for this device.\nAdd the following flag to your grub2 configuration:\nusbhid.quirks=0x1b1c:0x1b11:0x20000000\n\nNOTE: The 0x1b1c:0x1b11 corresponds to your back-light controller verified using lsusb and reported in dmesg.\nNOTE: The 0x prefix is important, without this prefix the parser will fail.\nThe simplest way to do this is to edit your /etc/default/grub file and add it to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT variable.  This is what mine looks like for my Corsair K70 Keyboard (do not simply copy/paste this as yours is likely different!):\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash usbhid.quirks=0x1b1c:0x1b13:0x20000000\"\n\nSave your changes and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow reboot your machine and you will experience a faster boot to login time.\n", "Q: update-initramfs runs scripts in init-premount?

I got myself a restart_usb shell script, put it in /etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-premount, and ran update-initramfs -u. \nNow comes the funny part: the script is executed while generating the new initramfs, thus resetting usb and by that, leaving a running linux with no access to any of its partitions.

This will show you which partitions are in use:\n$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 17.5 GB, 17515986944 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 2129 cylinders, total 34210912 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0004634f\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048    31082495    15540224   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2        31084542    34209791     1562625    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5        31084544    34209791     1562624   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nYou need to find that line which is has Linux in the last column. In this case /dev/sda1 is your root partition. If you've more than one line with System Linux you'll have to try out\n$ sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt #where sdaX is your root partition\n$ ls /mnt\nbin     dev      home      media     proc      sbin     tmp     var\nboot    etc      lib       opt       root      sys      usr\n\nThe output of ls /mnt should look like this or you've choose the wrong partition. If so unmount it with sudo umount /mnt and try again. If you found the correct root partition proceed with:\n$ sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\n$ sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\n$ sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n$ sudo chroot /mnt\n$ passwd YOUR_USER_NAME\n\nAfter setting a new password type:\n$ exit\n$ sudo umount /mnt/dev\n$ sudo umount /mnt/proc\n$ sudo umount /mnt/sys\n$ sudo umount /mnt\n$ sudo reboot\n\n\nA: If you press the Insert, F2, or + key, rEFInd will show a menu that may hold additional options, depending on the OS type.\nFrom the options submenu, you can press the Insert, F2, or + key again to edit your boot loader options.\nA simple text-mode line editor opens, enabling you to move a cursor back and forth in the line with your arrow keys, delete text, and type in new text.

The default cluster (\"Cluster master\") was then able to succesfully sync.\nOn the MAAS VM I also generated ssh keys with ssh-keygen and saved them in the default location (~/.ssh/). Then in the user preferences section of the GUI, I added the SSH public key.\nIn the \"Clusters\" section of the GUI, I added an interface (eth2) to \"Cluster Master\" and configured it to manage dhcp and dns. Interface eth2 is connected to the other VM (through VirtualBox internal network).\nIn the GUI, I added a node to \"default cluster\" and left the \"Power type\" blank since Wake On Lan doesn't work with VirtualBox.\nQuestions\nAfter manually starting up the client VM, it acquires an ip address and successfully begins the boot up process. However at some point it hangs for a full 120s with the following message repeated several times:\n\nurl_helper.py[WARNING]: Calling 'http://169.254.169.254/2009-04-04/meta-data/instance-id' failed [70/120s]: request error [HTTPConnectionPool(host='169.254.269.254', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /2009-04-04/meta-data/instance-id (Caused by : [Errno 101] Network is unreachable)]\n\nAfter reading about this online I found out that since this is a cloud image of Ubuntu it is trying to retrieve instance metadata.\n1) How would I go about disabling this behavior?\n2) How would I go about running a metadata (cloud-init?) service (and where? on the MAAS VM?) to supply the instance metadata?\nI'm not sure if this is related to the first issue. After the 120s, the boot up process resumes and I'm presented with a login prompt. After reading online I found out that I cannot login locally. Instead I must connect via ssh with publickey authentication. As mentioned above I have generated ssh keys and added them to MAAS, yet my ssh connection is refused. \ntest@ubuntuServer1404:~$ ssh ubuntu@192.168.7.101 -v\nOpenSSH_6.6.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config\ndebug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 19: Applying options for *\ndebug1: Connecting to 192.168.7.101 [192.168.7.101] port 22.\ndebug1: Connection established.\ndebug1: identity file /home/test/.ssh/id_rsa type 1\ndebug1: identity file /home/test/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1\ndebug1: identity file /home/test/.ssh/id_dsa type -1\ndebug1: identity file /home/test/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1\ndebug1: identity file /home/test/.ssh/id_ecdsa type -1\ndebug1: identity file /home/test/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert type -1\ndebug1: identity file /home/test/.ssh/id_ed25519 type -1\ndebug1: identity file /home/test/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert type -1\ndebug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0\ndebug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2\ndebug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2\ndebug1: match: OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2 pat OpenSSH_6.6.1* compat 0x04000000\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received\ndebug1: kex: server->client aes128-ctr hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com none\ndebug1: kex: client->server aes128-ctr hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com none\ndebug1: sending SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT\ndebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY\ndebug1: Server host key: ECDSA 06:16:8e:d2:22:3a:0b:67:64:3d:7b:17:69:fb:ee:29\ndebug1: Host '192.168.7.101' is known and matches the ECDSA host key.\ndebug1: Found key in /home/test/.ssh/known_hosts:2\ndebug1: ssh_ecdsa_verify: signature correct\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent\ndebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received\ndebug1: Roaming not allowed by server\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey\ndebug1: Next authentication method: publickey\ndebug1: Offering RSA public key: /home/test/.ssh/id_rsa\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/test/.ssh/id_dsa\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/test/.ssh/id_ecdsa\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/test/.ssh/id_ed25519\ndebug1: No more authentication methods to try.\nPermission denied (publickey).\n\nAny help is appreciated.

These packages are called metapackages. The community wiki has this to say:\n\nOne of the handy features of apt (the packaging system used by Ubuntu)\n  is the use of metapackages. These packages do not contain actual\n  software, they simply depend on other packages to be installed. This\n  setup allows entire sets of software to be installed by selecting only\n  the appropriate metapackage. For example, an Ubuntu user can install\n  the Kubuntu environment (KDE and all its associated programs) by\n  selecting \"kubuntu-desktop.\"\n...\nUbuntu System Metapackages\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*edubuntu-desktop: This package depends on all of the packages in the edubuntu desktop system\n  \n*edubuntu-server: This package depends on all of the packages in the edubuntu server system\n  \n*kubuntu-desktop: Similar to ubuntu-desktop, but with KDE and related software instead of Gnome\n  \n*ubuntu-desktop: In addition to ubuntu-minimal and ubuntu-standard, this package depends on all of the packages in the\n  Ubuntu desktop system. It installs a desktop environment (GNOME) and\n  lots of software for home and office use.\n  \n*ubuntu-minimal: This package depends on all of the packages in the Ubuntu minimal system, that is a functional command-line system\n  with the following capabilities: Boot, Detect hardware, Connect to a\n  network, Install packages, and Perform basic diagnostics. It is also\n  used to help ensure proper upgrades, so it is recommended that it not\n  be removed.\n  \n*ubuntu-restricted-extras: Introduced in Feisty, this package depends on some commonly used packages in the Ubuntu multiverse\n  repository. It installs support for java, flash, microsoft truetype\n  fonts, and many multimedia codecs.\n  \n*ubuntu-standard: In addition to ubuntu-minimal, this package depends on all of the packages in the Ubuntu standard system.

It will not let me partition, it says the same amount for max and minimum amount of free-space, and the option to partition is grayed out, is there a way I can partition the HDD without using a LiveCD/USB?\n\nA: Technically, the answer is \"yes.\" You can use fdisk to partition in-use MBR disks and gdisk to partition in-use GPT disks. GParted will also let you alter any partition that's not mounted, or create new partitions in unused space, but GParted won't let you alter any partition that's currently mounted (or otherwise in use).\nThe big caveat to fdisk and gdisk is that neither supports resizing the filesystems that partitions contain, so if you use them to resize your partitions, you run a very high risk of creating problems that will lead to data loss (maybe immediately, or maybe down the road a ways). It is possible to resize an in-use partition, as described in this question and its answers, but this is definitely something to be attempted only by experts. In the vast majority of cases, using a live CD to resize the Ubuntu root (/) partition is the way to go. Sometimes you can get away with simply unmounting a partition (such as a Windows partition) to resize it from your main installation.\nAs a side note, if you often need to modify in-use partitions, using the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is the way to go. LVM adds a new layer atop partitions, and therefore adds complexity, which is a big minus; but it creates a great deal of added flexibility when it comes to adjusting filesystem sizes. Depending on filesystem support, you can usually increase the size of a logical volume while it's in use with LVM, with much less risk than would be the case if you were using regular partitions. Ubuntu's LVM support isn't as advanced as it might be, though, and the added layer of complexity means that LVM isn't for everybody. It can also complicate data recovery if things go badly wrong.\n\nA: You can alter only partitions that are not mounted. Since /, /usr, /home, ... are needed to run the system, you will not be able to change the partitions they are on from the running system. All other partitions (e.g. from an OS installed in parallel) can be altered after unmounting them, by\nsudo umount /mountpoint\n\nI think you can unmount directly from gparted, too. \n(The command mount lists all mounted partitions.)\n", "Q: Where is whatsapp-purple?

I have an ethernet connection on an old laptop. I'm using Xubuntu 15.04. This ethernet connection will work at first. After awhile, it stops working. When I say stops working, specifically DHCP requests time out. The wireless adapter on this device works fine at all times. If I plug in a live boot USB the ethernet connection works fine in the live boot of Xubuntu 15.04 (or even 14 - don't remember what subversion that is now). If I reinstall Xubuntu from the live boot, then the ethernet connection will work fine for a time. Then it will start the same problem - DHCP requests time out.

Now I think my course of action is to remove the current hard drive and put in the empty one.  When I do that, can I simply boot using the Ubuntu disc and then install Ubuntu? \n\nA: You can install Ubuntu onto the empty hard drive without any initial preparation.\nJust make sure you know the name of the empty hard drive so that you know which to install Ubuntu onto when going through the installation process. \nHowever the simplest thing would be to remove the failed hard drive from the PC before you install Ubuntu. If you do so, there'll be no preparation to do on the empty disk - just put the Ubuntu disk in the DVD drive and it'll do the formatting and partitioning for you. \n\nA: No.  Installing Ubuntu is very simple.  Just boot to the DVD and follow the simple default steps.\nThere are some protective options that someone can take if they are trying to preserve data or a different OS install.\nBut for an empty disk, or a disk that you don't have anything you're trying to preserve, just use the recommended default installation.

Corruption of data is possible - if it is paused or interrupted whilst formatting/copying it is almost certain, so ensure the computer is connected to a reliable power supply and not used much (to maximise the resources available - make sure it doesn't suspend etc though). Also, if the partition is a boot partition, the computer may not boot afterwards if the bit with the boot stuff has been damaged, which I think is vaguely possible even with a successful copy. \nRelevant documentation:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=help-manual#gparted-move-partition\n\n*http://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=moving-space-between-partitions\n\nAn alternative method would be use the allocated space by creating a new partition inside it - this is quickest (should take less than five minutes) and also the less risky way, though it may be annoying have data separated between partitions. You can do this by selecting the unallocated space and creating a New Partiton - if you are just using just Linux, then the ext4 format may be best.\nYou can then select the partition in you file manager (e.g. Nemo, Nautilus, Dolphin, Thunar, etc) to use it:\n\nYou may need to use this command so you can use it as your normal user:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /<path>/<to>/<mounted>/<folder>\n\n", "Q: How to downgrade php version in ubuntu 15.04 I am working on a codeigniter project where the system requires php version < 5.6 that is 5.5, but few days ago I have installed ubuntu 15.04 with having LAMP stack installed using tasksel;the tasksel is gives me the latest update to php5.6 which is incompatible to my project;even I have uninstall tasksel LAMP server and installed lamp individually but the problem is not persisted\nI have a limited knowledge in linux environment if anybody knows please help me with some resources;I will be highly obliged.\nThank You.\n\nA: You should run sudo apt-get remove php5, then for 5.5 specifically, which was not used in 15.04, you will need to add a source from utopic by opening /etc/apt/sources.list in your favorite text editor and adding the following lines deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu utopic main and \ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu utopic main.

It is not a duplicate because the HDD in question is plugged into the optical bay.\nI have replaced my HDD with an SSD. Then I put the HDD in a optical bay caddy, and put it in place of my CD Drive. \nEverything is working fine, except I use the HDD to save bulk data which I won't be using that frequently. \nSo, is it possible, by any means, to power the HDD off and on in my optical drive, while the system is running? A shell script will do it, perhaps?  \n\nA: The SATA connection in the optical drive bay is no different from the other SATA ports. A hard disk drive connected where your DVD drive was will show as a regular SATA drive (ie: as /dev/sdb)  and can be put to sleep, using hdparm \nTo put this drive to sleep after 10 seconds of inactivity and save battery, you could do:\nsudo hdparm -S 10 /dev/sdb\n\nThis is not permanent and can be configured to be so in /etc/hdparm.conf. See the man hdparm manual pages for more details. \n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not possible unless the SATA controller on your motherboard has it as a feature. I am not aware of any controllers that expose this in their API. Even if it was available, you would need to get into the Linux kernel's SATA driver and code in your access through a system call (or, even better, a /proc filesystem access). In essence, you would need to hack and recompile your own custom kernel.\nYou may have a more simple solution through using an USB external hard drive enclosure: just put the platter HD into one of these, and connect only when you need access. You can go with USB 3 if the enclosure handles it and you have a USB 3 port on your computer, which would give you native HD speeds since a platter HD is in fact much slower than USB 3. \nThis question actually touches on the main distinction between hot-pluggable devices such as USB and not hot-pluggable (or only with supplementary circuitry) such as SATA.\n", "Q: How to run a command automatically after completing download?

It seems the touchpad is very sensitive and I want this to stop.\n2) I can move the cursor around with 1 finger moving around the touch pad but as soon as I place another finger or part of my hand (often by accident) on the touch pad all navigation stops and I cannot move the cursor so long as more than one piece of flesh is touching the touchpad. I do not want this to happen and don't know how to prevent this. MacOS is not as restrictive like this.\nTo address #1, I tried the suggestion at the link below, which attempts to change the default right-click mechanism to that of MacOS which is a button+click. \nhttps://www.void.gr/kargig/blog/2009/06/11/handling-right-clicks-on-a-macbook-running-linux/\nHowever, that did not work. When I click on the COMMAND key the Linux Mint menu pops up instead. The right-click functionality is unchanged and remains the 2 finger tap.\nI also placed the following in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf:\nOption \"TapButton2\" \"0\"\n\nLike so:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n        Driver \"synaptics\"\n        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n# This option is recommend on all Linux systems using evdev, but cannot be\n# enabled by default.

For a short term fix try using synclient directly, e.g.,\nsynclient TapButton2=0. I made my changes permanent by copying /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf (I don't think you are supposed to edit the former).

I messed up a couple of things and now I am extremely annoyed at my poor installation of Ubuntu. When I go to boot options I have two copies of Ubuntu which was part of my horrible installation procedure. One Ubuntu is on my SSD another on my HDD. However, selected either option seems to contain the same profile ( I have the same setup, data, and downloads).\nI went to the BIOS and attempted to make Ubuntu the default booting option, but the only option I have is the Windows boot manager which automatically boots to windows anyways unless I access the boot menu. I miss the boot menu too many times and this has caused me to do too many restarts in a short period of time.\nSo my laptop is an MSI GE60 Apache Pro-867. I wonder how could I wipe out both discs (a 128GB SSD and 1TB HDD), but not mess up my BIOS. I want to install Ubuntu only as I'll be using this computer for software development and I don't see any advantages to being on Windows at the moment. But I still want to be have the ability to install windows in the future if needed. The catch is that I don't have a CD.\nThank You!\n\nA: First, you must determine your boot modes: BIOS or EFI. Note the plural modes; it's possible to install Windows in one mode and Ubuntu in the other. You can learn each OSes' boot mode from Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, Ubuntu is booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, Ubuntu is booted in BIOS mode.\n\n*Type sudo parted /dev/sda print | grep Table. (This assumes you've got one disk, /dev/sda.) If the result reads Partition Table: gpt, Windows boots in EFI mode; if it reads Partition Table: msdos, Windows boots in BIOS mode.\n\n\nIf you're booting Ubuntu in EFI mode, as I suspect, you can adjust your boot menu by using the efibootmgr utility. Type that command alone (with sudo) to see your boot entries. You can then change the order by using the -o option. Note, however, that some computers have buggy EFIs that ignore or reset these settings. With them, ugly workarounds are required, as noted on this page of mine.\nIf you're certain you want to wipe both Windows and Ubuntu from the disk and start fresh, you can completely destroy all your partition table data from Ubuntu:\nsudo sgdisk -Z /dev/sda\n\nThis command will completely destroy your partition table data on /dev/sda. When you re-run your Ubuntu installation medium, you can set it up to take over the whole disk. That said, if you're using EFI, it's conceivable that the NVRAM entries that point to your old Ubuntu installation will survive. In this case, you may want to use efibootmgr to delete them, particularly if they cause you any trouble. I recommend you ignore this possibility for now and post a new question if you have problems, or check out this question and answer, which covers the most likely problem.\n\nA: If you are not planning on using windows for a long time, but still want to preserve your license, you could make an installation medium for it. This will automatically save your license in modern Windows OS (see this answer for details on how to).\nThen, you can simply run your ubuntu usb live and install ubuntu from scratch by choosing the option \"Erase the whole disk and install ubuntu\". \n", "Q: HTK ERROR [+5010] InitSource: Cannot open source file f-ihm+k 0\ndown vote\nfavorite\nI believe that this error has something to do with a mismatch between my tiedlist and the hmmdefs (as pointed out here:http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~bromberg/htk_problems.html), but I can not seem to solve it. All of the triphones in my corpus are present in my triphones1 list and triphones1 only contains monophones,biphones and triphones from my corpus.\nIf I take said triphone out of the triphones1 list and recreate the tiedlist it passes but complains about another triphone down the road. Obviously manually taking out all of these triphones would take me years and it doesn't seem efficient which leads me to believe that I have missed something further back.\nIt is also important to note that all these triphones generating errors are in my corpus as well. To me this error would only make sense if I had unseen triphones somewhere, but where? I feel that I have left no stone unturned but surely someone can give me a fresh idea of where to look.\n\nA: There was an extra AU command at the end of the tree.hed file This was causing it to try and open another file after the tiedlist.  I am not sure why this causes an issue when it has already accessed tiedlist, but there you go.\nHopefully this serves as a extra check for future htk users.\n", "Q: How to Read HD when only booting to Bios with dual-boot Windows 10 and 15.10? Brand new Asus Zenbook UX305FA, came with Win 8 installed--upgraded to Win8.1, then to Win 10 prelim; dual boot with Ubuntu 15.10;\nI've had no problems with this machine as setup for the past 2 weeks I've owned it, until this afternoon. In the airport I was using the machine in Windows to write some documents, I fly home, open it up, reboot it and bam--it ONLY boots into the BIOS.\nI've read at least 100 articles on the net about disabling UEFI and fast boot mode and security and all this crap--also went ahead and made a Super Grub2 Disk repair USB disk and tried that, to no avail--just says it won't boot anything because it's invalid.\n\n\n*\n\n*I cannot read /dev/sda (my only SSD on the machine) from linux.\n\n*I can however read (hd0,1) from Super Grub2 and see the /boot/grub/ folder and the files, all EFI. \n\n\nMBR is likely screwed, no idea why the hell this happened... any suggestions to recover my data or is this toast? \n[paste does not exist]\nHardware: Asus Zenbook UX305FA\nUbuntu: 15.10\nDual-boot: Windows 10    \n\nA: The main errors from your boot repair are:\nInvalid MBR Signature found.\nERROR: asr: reading /dev/sda[Input/output error]\n\nSo it looks like your SSD is broken.  HDDs die a horrible death like cancer: slowly they get worse and worse, until they finally die whereas SSDs die a quick and painful death like a heart attack: they just die suddenly.\nYou have just one (very small) chance that the SSD got loose from its bay while you were flying: open up the HDD bay, remove the SSD, re-insert it and try again.  If that doesn't help, return the laptop to the store and get it repaired under warranty.\n", "Q: Will I be able to install ubuntu touch on a Meizu MX4 with android? I'm thinking about buying this Meizu MX4 that comes with Android.  \nI was wondering if it would be possible to install Ubuntu Touch on it and keep receiving OTA updates. Being able to dual-boot it with android/ubuntu would also be nice.\n\nA: according to this article it's not such a good idea.\nNot all Meizu devices are unlocked, and even if they do, they have a different partition table scheme.\n\nA: This guy somehow managed to get it there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe9hKdYEMqY. I think if you are persistent about it, better to follow some tutorials on rooting the Chinese version of Meizu MX4 on XDA developers. As far as I know it is also possible to unroot it, so you would have a single boot with Ubuntu or with Android. In case if it is rewriting the architecture you would need to buy a new phone. Android phones come with a custom system partitioning, and rewriting the system multiple times even switching to CyanogenMod can result in boiling of your processor. \n\n\n*\n\n*You need to backup your existing system.  \n\n*You need to root your device.  \n\n*You need to download the Ubuntu build for your device.  \n\n*You need to burn it through your boot loader.  \n\n*Turn on your phone and enjoy it!  \n\n\nThe bootloader on Android is usually accessible through pressing VOLUME UP and POWER button. This link seems like a good solution for building any OS into Meizu. In general it is also good to check with the Ubuntu community and ask questions there. \n", "Q: Where to look for drivers for Ubuntu I want to know from where i can get all the drivers for Ubuntu 14.10 for my lenovo G580 laptop.\nIs there any link for getting drivers for ubuntu ?\n\nA: Lenovo laptops are the best supported computers for most any flavor of linux, including Ubuntu.  As a result, you should not even need to seek drivers for them as such drivers tend to be automatically installed at installation time.  A couple of years ago I saw one Lenovo laptop which had failed to have its drivers properly installed because the internet wasn't connected during installation.  If your computer has a wired ethernet port, I recommend using that during installation.  If you don't wish to reinstall, you could open system settings and click on the \"additional drivers\" icon.\nPS: Ubuntu is really the easiest operating system to install, the only caveat being that there are quite a few laptops which resist installation, most of them being made between 1998 and 2004.  The only way to tell is to boot such computers to the live cd/usb stick.  If it doesn't work with those, it probably won't work on the hard disk installation.\nHere's another tip.  when in doubt, try disconnecting the internal hard drive and installing instead on a high performance external usb stick or hard drive as a \"dry run test\".  I am particularly fond of the Patriot Rage Pro XT sticks.  32g is overkill so these drives, for all their performance, don't actually cost that much. Best of all, after you have made your customized external stick, you can apply it to many valid purposes, not the least of which is introducing your friends computers to ubuntu by running their windows pcs to Ubuntu.  These sticks will also facilitate data recovery on your friends computer even when their windows is so corrupted that the machine wont boot.  You can save your friends hundreds of dollars by assisting them in data recovery, or of course you can probably persuade them to give you a few bucks for the service.  I suppose that may depend on how fond you are of them.  ;-)\nAlmost forgot, if you install CLAMtk VIRUS SCANNER on the stick you can help your friends to see how much malware and viruses their windows computers are suffering from.  Pay close attention as most of these are password stealers and scamware, so your friends will thank you when they see how much danger they are in.  My guess is they'd pay you to install Ubuntu for them.  It can be great fun. (or profitable) but at present I don't even charge for this simple service.\n", "Q: Windows gone and ubuntu not working I installed ubuntu alongside windows 8.1 and i installed correctly by creating partitions and the laptop finally says restart to use ubuntu but when i do , it agains diplays a gnu grub version showing :\n-try ubuntu without installing\n-install ubuntu\n-oem install\n-check disc for defects.\nalso i have no idea where my windows has gone.\n\nA: Remove the installation media (disk or usb) and then reboot.\n\nA: When your computer boots up, enter BIOS and change the boot settings so that the default device is your hard drive and not your USB or CD.\n", "Q: 15.04, Wireless randomly have long delay I am using Ubuntu 15.04 with Wifi Driver RTL8723BE\nWhen I ping Google, time randomly go over 10,000ms.

In my case all I had to do to solve the issue was remove the accelerated graphics card, but that's probably not going to work for you.\nAs to your windows installation, you should have been greeted by a boot manager at boot time, provided you selected \"side by side\" installations when you installed Ubuntu.  If you opted to use the entire hard disk, then your windows installation has been deleted.  Sorry.\nI suggest you boot to whatever medium used to install Ubuntu and once that has loaded, open either Disk Utility to examine the content of the hard drive and look for any NTFS partitions.

My ubuntu router is on a vmware and I was wondering how do you add this to another router so the network may expand?\n\nA: Depending on the capabilities of your wireless router, you might be able to configure it as a switch, thus extending your LAN that way.\nOn my LAN my main Ubuntu server is the router / dhcp server / firewall. My wireless router is configured as a switch, taking care of all the wireless requirements, while the devices themselves get their IP address from main DHCP server, and everything is on one sub-net. So that I can still connect to the administration web interface of the wireless router (switch), it has a static IP address on the same local sub-net, but outside of the pool of addresses reserved for dynamic allocation.So, I have:\nWAN <--> Ubuntu Server <--> switch <--> wireless router configured as a switch\n", "Q: Both journald and rsyslog are running Since the migration to Ubuntu 15.04 both journald and rsyslog are installed and running.\nI'm wondering if this is by design or if rsyslog might not have been uninstalled by accident?\nCan I uninstall rsyslog without problems or should I take precautions?\n\nA: UPDATE AS OF 18.04:\nAs of 18.04, there doesn't seem to be any real dependencies. Aside from other rsyslog specific packages, most of the dependencies listed by apt-cache rdepends rsyslog appear to be \"recommends\" and not actual dependencies.\nTherefore, it might be safe but proceed with caution.\nTo assess the situation, you can do a \"dry run\" removal to show which packages would be removed:\nsudo apt remove --dry-run rsyslog\n\nThis will not remove any packages but it will show which packages would be removed.\n\nIf you remove rsyslog, apt may install another package to replace it. This is the case when there is an \"either/or\" dependency for rsyslog or a similar package.\nExample:\nDepends: rsyslog | inetutils-syslogd\n\nHere, either package will satisfy the dependency so if you uninstall one, the other will install automatically to satisfy the dependency.\n\nORIGINAL ANSWER (15.04):\njournalctl is part of systemd.\nMany packages depend on rsyslog and it is not recommended to uninstall it.\nsee:\napt-cache rdepends rsyslog\n\n", "Q: Android Studio lists device as \"????????????????

Or any settings change in my Android studio.. ?\n\n\nA: If you're developing on Ubuntu Linux, you need to add a udev rules file that contains a USB configuration for each type of device you want to use for development. In the rules file, each device manufacturer is identified by a unique vendor ID, as specified by the ATTR{idVendor} property. For a list of vendor IDs, see USB Vendor IDs, below. To set up device detection on Ubuntu Linux: Log in as root and create this file: \n/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules\n\nUse this format to add each vendor to the file: \nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"0bb4\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\"\n\nIn this example, the vendor ID is for HTC (to get your vendor ID use lsusb command with connected device). The MODE assignment specifies read/write permissions, and GROUP defines which Unix group owns the device node. Note: The rule syntax may vary slightly depending on your environment. Consult the udev documentation for your system as needed. For an overview of rule syntax, see this guide to writing udev rules.\nNow execute:\nchmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules\n\nThe full solution is here.\n", "Q: Ubuntu from pendrive. How much space available I am currently trying ubuntu gnome which is mounted on a 2 GB pendrive. So, the computers internal hard disk (320 GB) is not used. So, I want to know how much space I have available. On running the command df -h in the terminal, I see this - \nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/cow            1.9G  636M  1.3G  33% /\nudev            1.9G  4.0K  1.9G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           387M  1.3M  386M   1% /run\n/dev/sdb1       1.9G  923M  979M  49% /cdrom\n/dev/loop0      882M  882M     0 100% /rofs\nnone            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\ntmpfs           1.9G   96K  1.9G   1% /tmp\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            1.9G  1.1M  1.9G   1% /run/shm\nnone            100M   48K  100M   1% /run/user\n/dev/sda1       290G  374M  275G   1% /media/ubuntu-gnome/9e05a859-dc89-4e59-be8a-73d3e6da36e5\n\nHow can there be multiple partitions all 1.9GB when the whole pendrive is 2GB?

Is it possible to use that to store files? \n\nA: What you see is an artifact. There really is only one 1.9GB partition. /tmp for example is a tmpfs, ie it is in memory, yet it shows up. A command to use if you have it is findmnt which shows you the hierarchy and where the real disks are. \nWhen you download a large file the Avail column should change.\nYou should be able to use the /media/... disk, but you need to first create a directory on it for your user id. Use sudo mkdir and the full pathname of the directory, then sudo chown user and the same directory. Replace user by whatever you are logged in as (try who am i).\n", "Q: Make echo ignore spaces?

The Terminal and the script are behaving differently. Any work around for this?\n\nA: You can use parameter expansion and an extended glob to \"normalize\" the whitespace. \n# enable extended globs so that +([[:space:]]) matches one or more whitespace\nshopt -s extglob\n\n# replace all occurances of one or more whitespace with a single space\nprvar=${prvar//+([[:space:]])/ }\n\necho \"blah blah blah $prvar blah blah\"\n\nThis allows you to safely quote the variable. If you don't quote the variable, word splitting is not the only thing that will happen. The shell will also attempt to replace words with filenames, if they contain glob characters like *, ?, [...].\n\nA: You dont have to quote (\") everything in echo. You can have many strings. Simply dont quote prvar:\necho \"blah blah blah\" $prvar\n\nIn the shell (which is expanding $prvar for you before echo even sees it), spaces inside quotes (\") are preserved, but spaces and tabs outside quotes are reduced to one space. eg\necho \"a        b\"        d            e\na        b d e\n\n", "Q: What are the Enlightenment (e17) shortcut keys?

When I issue the shutdown option in virt-manager, or virsh shutdown windows, the virtual machine cleanly shuts down as expected.\nSupposedly, the VM should be allowed to cleanly shut down when I shut down or reboot the host. However, this is not the case, and the virtual machine is abruptly stopped.\n\nA: Update upon suggestion:\nAccording to the blog/wiki author:\n\nHowever, there is the problem that each VM will only receive one shutdown request. For Linux VMs this is usually fine, but Windows VMs sometimes do not react to the first request, resulting in the VM being killed forcibly after the timeout. The only way to fix this problem is modifying the shutdown script so that it sends shutdown requests again and again until a VM has shutdown or the timeout has been reached.\n\nSo the solution is to patch /usr/lib/libvirt/libvirt-guests.sh in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) (credit to the wiki author: Sebastian Marsching):\n--- /usr/lib/libvirt/libvirt-guests.sh  2016-10-10 09:33:38.000000000 +0200\n+++ /usr/local/lib/libvirt/libvirt-guests.sh    2016-11-08 11:58:33.000000000 +0100\n@@ -339,6 +339,19 @@\n     retval run_virsh \"$uri\" shutdown \"$guest\" > /dev/null\n }\n \n+# shutdown_guest_retry URI GUEST\n+# Start a ACPI shutdown of GUEST on URI.

I haven't used hardlinks for a long time and never really needed them until I was asked in an interview. I read their difference from symlinks here: What is the difference between a hard link and a symbolic link?\nIs there any particular reason why the design is not having both of the capabilities of the symlink and the capabilities of the hardlink in the same link file?  \nYou want to point to a file. Ok so you start with a hardlink functionality to cover situations where the filename is changed or the file is moved. If hardlink is not valid because it refers outside the filesystem or fails for some other reason have a fallback, the filepath of that file to refer to, in other words have a symlink.\nBecause what the user of an operating system wants by the end of the day is just have a link to a file.\nIs there anything that could prevent the above design solution for links?\n\nA: I don't really understand what you mean. I think you have misunderstood what hard links are. First of all, all files are hardlinks. Every single one. A file is just a link pointing to an inode. A symlink, on the other hand, is a link pointing to a hardlink (to a path). How could the two be combined?\nMore to the point, the functionality is very different. Consider this:\n$ echo \"This is file\" > file\n$ ln -s file softlink\n$ ln file hardlink\n$ cat softlink \nThis is file\n$ cat hardlink \nThis is file\n$ rm file\n$ echo \"This is a different file\" > file\n$ cat softlink \nThis is a different file\n$ cat hardlink \nThis is file\n\nAs you can see above, deleting the file a hardlink points to does not affect the hardlink since the hardlink is pointing to an inode. The softlink, on the other hand, is changed when the target is deleted and recreated since the new file is now pointing to a different inode.  \nAlso, since hardlinks point to inodes and not filesystem paths, they cannot be relative. It is very often useful to have a symlink pointing to, for example, ../../foo. That way, we can move the whole directory structure somewhere else and rename anything we like but the link does not break. So, if we move to a different directory, a softlink will always point to a foo that is two levels up. A hardlink, however, will just point to whatever inode it was created to point to and moving the directory will not affect it. Sometimes that's what we want and sometimes it isn't. Having this kind of versatility is very useful. \n\nA: I think you are confused by the word “link” in “hardlink”/“softlink”. Despite the apparent naming symmetry, those are completely different things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Soft links:\nIf you come from some microsoft background, maybe it would be easier to say that : a softlink is pretty close to what a shortcut is. It is an (almost) regular file that has a pathname in it.\nOnly difference is on Unix, the OS has some magic to redirect applications automatically. Namely, when an application open()s a file, the OS will check the S_IFLNK mode flag on the file - if it is set, it means it only contains a path to another file, and the OS will transparently redirect the call to that path.\n\n*Hard links:\nA hard link is just a technical term for \"filename\". When you \"create a hardlink\" you're just adding a second name for the same file. The whole workflow looks roughly like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you create a file, it gets a first filename automatically.\n\n*You may add additional filenames if you so wish.\n\n*You cannot actually delete files on Unix. The rm command only deletes a filename. This is much more obvious when you know the actual operation it performs is called unlink()ing\n\n*Whenever a file no longer has any filename, it gets deleted. (*)\n\n\nAs a sidenote, directories always have at least two filenames: one in their parent, and one in themselves (.). Also, if a directory has subdirectories, it will have an additional hardlink in each subdirectory, named ...\nYou may see the filename/hardlink count by running ls -l. Second column in the output.\n(*): if some process is using the file, deletion is postponed until it's not used anymore. In the meantime, you do have a file with no name, which you cannot see or access.\n\nA: I see the following disadvantages:  \n\n\n*\n\n*with hard links there is no \"original\" path of the file anymore, i.e. you can't distinguish a file from its links. I often use links as shortcuts to files which are down in a well-sorted, nested directory structure, to simplify navigation, but I still want to be able to look up where exactly the file is stored (since its original path contains information). \n\n*The fallback would make things confusing for less advanced users. If you get used to everything being hardlinked, and the file being a link itself, you might sometimes delete the file at the original location because you know that the links will keep the data on the drive. Now if the fallback to a soft link has occurred, you will delete your data. Of course the software could issue a warning, but for many that could increase confusion. \n\n\nIn general I don't think it's a good idea to hide fundamentally different things from the user. For most scenarios, soft links are fine. In my experience, hard links are mainly useful for backups. For example dirvish makes use of them. \n\nA: The idea you describe exists already, in the form of the 'Alias' in Apple's HFS+ filesystem.  If you create an alias for a file, then you can use that alias to refer to the file in future.  The alias uses a mixture of inode-equivalent (HFS+ doesn't have inodes as such), file name, and... other stuff to re-find the file, using an algorithm which is deliberately undocumented.\nPragmatically – meaning, for most non-technical users – this works pretty well, because the sort of filename changes, and file moves, that people make in practice are handled well enough by this (DWIM and all that); and the undocumented nature of the resolution algorithm means that Apple has the freedom to tweak the heuristic if they find something that works better.  This is a Good Thing, in principle.  On the other hand, it annoys the hell out of anyone who'd prefer that their computers were deterministic, dammit!  Apple doesn't currently seem to push the 'alias' in their technical documentation.\nI think this comes under the heading of: interesting experiment – pushed hard – not ultimately rewarding.\n[It's rather hard to find chapter and verse on HFS+ aliases (sc, I haven't been able to find any in 10 minutes of searching, just now), so if anyone does have specific references, feel free to edit this answer.]\n\nA: Before I started using Unix I used AmigaOS which have links which both have some of the aspects of symlinks and of hardlinks. I never really got to understand how they behaved.\nThen I got to use Unix systems (and later Linux). I found both symlinks and hardlinks easy to understand on their own. To this day I still don't understand the hybrid construction used for links in AmigaOS.\nFrom a principle of least surprise, I find the distinction between symlinks and hardlinks to be a very good construction. Neither of them comes with any surprises.\nBut the two constructions are very different. The most significant aspect they have in common is that both can be created using the ln command line tool.\nI cannot imagine how you would merge the two into a unified concept without making it immensely complicated. And that would be the primary argument against changing the design. It is better to have to separate features each of which is simple to understand than one complicated feature.\nAnother argument against the change is that there is a lot of software designed to work with symlinks and hardlinks as they work now. All that software would be unable to deal with a hybridlink.\n", "Q: hcitool scan does not find my bluetooth device I have a small device that has a bluetooth chip.

All Linux file systems have 4kb block size. Let's say I have 10mb of hard disk storage. That means I have 2560 blocks available and let's say I copied 2560 files each having 1kb of size. Each 1 kb block will occupy 1 block though it is not filling entire block.\nSo my entire disk is now filled but still I have 2560x3kb of free space. If I want to store another file of say 1mb will the file system allow me to store? Will it write in the free space left in the individual blocks? Is there any concept addressing this problem?\nI would appreciate some clarification. Thanks in advance\n\nA: The default block size was 512 bytes since the first Linux ever. Except until recently 4k block sizes where introduced to cater for the ever increasing size of disks. This is actually even nearly dictated by the disk hardware (see more:https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/178899/optimizing-logical-sector-size-for-physical-sector-size-4096-hdd).\nYet for your specific question: you are right that all files waste the unused bytes of the last block on many types of file systems, which is particularly wasteful for small files. But btfrs and reiserfs seem to be able to cope, acvording to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_suballocation\n\nA: *\n\n*File systems can have block size from 512 to (usually) 65536 bytes. The block size can be specified as mkfs.xxx option. The default blocksize in most Linux filesystems - 4096 bytes.\n\n*Some filesystems support tail-packing and/or subblock allocation. ext2/3/4 - does, xfs - doesn't.\nIf you plan to fill a partition with several small files, you can reduce wasted \"tail\" space by shrinking blocksize to 512 or 1024.\n", "Q: Empty black screen after on virtual machine My ubuntu 14 virtual box virtual machine shut down because of cut in power supply to machine.\nNow I am getting black screen ,I have restarted and shunt down machine many times.\nBut no result.\nPlease guide.\n-Thanks\nShahab\n\nA: Um well there a quite a few things that could be going wrong here.\nI have had this issue before a few times and never caused by the \nsame thing.\nFirst try turning on the box, in the menu, Machine > Reset.\nI have had luck with this before.\nWhat is your host os, Ubuntu..

For a while now when I switch between two user sessions the inactive one in some cases will stop executing GUI processes. This way I'm forced waiting for another session to load and can't do something in another one, because if I switch and return after a while it's still on the same point. The software affected includes rsync, rdiff-backup, KDE background processes, Steam launched in Openbox session (even downloading stops) and at least some games. VLC is not affected, at least it skips to needed time after I switch back, but for a moment I can see old frame and time in it's window.\nWhat process is responsible for such behaviour? Can I reconfigure it somehow?\nUpdate: Memory and Swap Usage\nSome additional context: The irony is I suggested this exact behaviour on the old brainstorm.ubuntu.com (now defunct).\n\nA: I run into this problem too because I switch between console and graphical virtual terminals on a regular basis. Xorg by design suspends its clients during VT switches, which is why its clients seem to \"freeze\" when Xorg's VT is no longer active. Wayland does not, so if the programs you need to stay running in a background VT support the new display protocol, use a Wayland compositor instead of Xorg.\nOne way to work around this problem is to run graphical programs on a local VNC server so that they never get suspended. This is the workaround that I use the most frequently.\n\nA: \nWhat process is responsible for such behaviour?\n\nDisplay Manager (DM) is the one you are looking for. Anyone: lightdm, gdm, kdm (old kde), sddm (new kde), xdm ...\n\nCan I reconfigure it somehow?\n\nAFAIK, That should be that way with X server.

Why it is not working \"out-of-the-box\"?\nThis seems to be similar question, but I still don't know how to open login page.\n\nA: I had exactly this problem, and I found the solution here.\nSpecifically, as directed, here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Comment out dns=dnsmasq in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf (i.e. put a # at the beginning of the line)\n\n*Restart network-manager: sudo service networking restart\nFor me, worked like a charm.

How can I destroy my Ubuntu system (in a virtual PC) or render it unbootable?\n\nA: This command deletes your system irrevocably. This information is for educational purposes only and I am not responsible for your misuse of this information\nsudo rm --no-preserve-root -rf / deletes everything recursively from root down to other directories , including kernel and any system binaries. Works in both VM and physically installed OS.\n\nA: This'll nuke you're MBR as well as your EFI partition. (Assuming the EFI partition isn't bigger than 64MB)\nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=1M count=64\n\n\nThis'll ruin your permissions, and render the system unbootable:\nsudo chmod -r 777 /\n\n\nThis'll hang your system:\n:(){ :|: & };:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Use lsblk to find the partition Ubuntu is installed to. It should be mounted to /.\n\n*Replacing /dev/sda1 with the actual partition (found in step 1), run this command:\nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda1\n\n\n*Enjoy.\nIf you want to nuke the entire drive, take the number of the Ubuntu partition off, revealing something like /dev/sda, and use that.\nThis command will completely wipe out every single bit of data on the given partition pretty reliably, allowing little to no chance of recovery if not stopped very quickly.\nAlternatively, if you need it gone now with zero chance of recovery:\n\nIf you do not have dynamite available, thermite, a drill, a hammer, or a large neodymium magnet will also be acceptable in a pinch.\n\nA: You can run wipefs on each partition of your intallation. wipefs returns immedialty so it is very quick. So for example,\nwipefs -a /dev/sda1\n\nwill wipe trace of a filesystem (any of them) in /dev/sda1 partition. It could be recoverable but the goal was to render it unbootable not irrecoverable.\nIf you use LUKS you can delete the header with dd, as already mentionned.\n\nA: To remove a virtual machine completely from Virtual Box we can select it from the Virtual Box Manager:\n\nOn right click context menu select Remove or press \nCtrl + R:\n\nOn choosing Delete all files all files associated to this machine including snapshots will be irreversibly removed.\nIn case we had created a VDI virtual hard drive used for other machines as well we may need to remove them separately from the Virtual Box Media Manager Ctrl + D:\n\n\nA: ~$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > /usr/bin/FORKBOMB.sh\n~$ echo ':(){ :|: & };:' >> /usr/bin/FORKBOMB.sh && chmod 755 /usr/bin/FORKBOMB.sh\n\nThen let's ask systemd to make this happen at startup:   \n~$ sudo su\n/home/user/# printf \"[Unit]\\nDescription=Totally Innocuous\\n\\n[Service]\\nExecStart=-/usr/bin/FORKBOMB.sh\\n\\n[Install]\\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\" > /etc/systemd/system/totally_innocuous_service.service\n\nHaven't tested yet, but telling systemd to start a forkbomb at boot could be hard to fix.\n\nA: to destroy ubuntu type in the terminal sudo su then type your password.\nThen type cd .. and type cd .. again then type del grub then type yes then reboot and it won't boot up again unless you repair it\n", "Q: Base Ubuntu Server, Can't install anything I'm currently administrating an Ubuntu Server 14.04.2 and was looking forward to installing LAMP, first two lines I wrote were\n$ sudo apt-get update\nReading package lists.. Done (no more no less)\n\n$ sudo apt-get install apache2\n\nOnly to get \"unable to locate package apache2\", how do I deal with that? and will I keep running into this for all repositories?\n\nA: As I take from our conversation in the comments, you have no software sources configured. This can be due to the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*No sources were configured on installation. (is this even possible?)\n\n*The software sources were removed accidentally or maliciously deliberately.\n\n*They were lost due to another reason, which would most likely indicate a system that is broken elsewise, too.\n\n\n\nIf your system has a GUI installed, you can open the Software Sources utility (if it is installed). If it isn't or your system doesn't have a graphical desktop, you can generate a new sources list using tools like the Ubuntu Sources List Generator.\nSelect your country (for mirror selection) and Trusty as release, and then enable the repositories you wish to have (at least main and universe). Then tool will generate a text output, which you can copy and paste into the /etc/apt/sources.list file or save it to a local file and upload it to the server. Then your APT commands should work again.\n", "Q: How To Start Python Script On Bootup I have a couple of Python scripts I want to launch at bootup.

Can someone suggest to me another way I can launch them please?\nNote: This is actually for something I'm trying to do a Debian machine. Not sure if it makes any difference.\n\nA: You can add it to /etc/rc.local. This can be used to run scripts and programs on system boot which doesn't have their own scripts for runlevels. It will run as root\nRun sudo nano /etc/rc.local and add your line before exit 0\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\npython /home/my-sickbeard-install/SickBeard.py 2>&1 >/dev/null &\n\nexit 0\n\nPress CTRL+ O to save and  CTRL+ X to exit. \n\nA: have you tryed this:\npython-py | echo '/home/my-sickbeard-install/SickBeard.py'\ncron -l /home/my-sickbeard-install/SickBeard.py\ncron -l -restart\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Should I use autoremove in these packages? When I run sudo apt-get autoremove it is trying to remove the followings packages:\nlinux-headers-3.16.0-40 \nlinux-headers-3.16.0-40-generic \nlinux-image-3.16.0-40-generic\nlinux-image-extra-3.16.0-40-generic \nlinux-signed-image-3.16.0-40-generic\n\nShould I really remove them? They look important.\n\nA: Run this command in Terminal:\nuname -r\n\nOnly if the output is not:\n3.16.0-40-generic\n\n... you can remove the packages. \nAfterwards, reboot the machine and try again, maybe you have upgraded your kernel without rebooting after upgrading.\n", "Q: How can I back up Ubuntu partition before reinstall? I want to re-install my Ubuntu install for various reasons. Before doing this, I would like to back up my Ubuntu partition, in case something goes wrong (highly unlikely). I have backed up entire disks before, but not single partitions. My partition layout:\nsda 8:0 0 232,9G 0 disk\n├─sda1 8:1 0 35G 0 part     (Windows 8.1)\n├─sda2 8:2 0 194G 0 part /  (Ubuntu 14.04)\n└─sda3 8:3 0 4G 0 part      (SWAP)\n\nCan I just boot up a portable Linux drive using a USB Key, and use \"dd\" to copy \"sda2\" to my external hard drive?\nAnd since it is the second partition, do I have to do anything with the MBR, if I wish to restore the backup partition?\n\nA: I am not really sure what you mean by \"just bootup a portable linux drive\".\nIf what you want is: hard-copy your sda2 into a usb and then eventually boot from it, it is probably possible. \nWhat you can surely do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*dd your sda2 to a key (be careful with the dd command and see here)\n\n*If you want to restore: dd it back to an appropriate sized partition\n\n*Boot up from a live usb key and run the boot-repair utility (this tells your GRUB to give you an option to load the system you cloned back)\n\n\nI believe this should work even if you omit step 1 (e.g. you can instruct your grub to boot the system that is in the usb-key) but I never tried myself.\nAlso, maybe lookup something like \"Install ubuntu from a USB key\" (also see a possibly related thread).\nA final word of warning: notice that you have a dual boot with win 8.1, therefore you might have a UEFI installation of UBUNTU, and  have a ESP partition that holds all of your boot files (also for windows). To check if this is the case look if there is /sys/firmware/efi directory as suggested by other users. Keep this in mind when working with partitions and with boot-repair.\n\nA: You can back up your personal files to an external disk with normal file-copying commands (cp in a Terminal or drag-and-drop with whatever file manager you like). That's normally adequate, unless you do heavy customization of system-wide settings (in /etc). In a worst-case scenario, you'd re-install Ubuntu and then copy your personal files back.\nClonezilla is a popular backup tool if you want to back up an entire partition or an entire set of partitions. You'll then be able to restore the whole partition much like you could with a dd backup, but a Clonezilla backup will chew up less disk space and will proceed more quickly, since it won't back up unused sectors from the disk, which a dd backup will.\nAs to the MBR, I wouldn't bother. GRUB relies on code in the MBR, but also code elsewhere, so if something goes badly wrong, you might need to use Boot Repair or restore the boot loader manually even if you have an MBR backup. This is likely to be safer, too, since all sorts of things can go wrong if you start mucking with the MBR using dd and don't know what you're doing. Furthermore, as Three Diag says, you may have an EFI-based installation, in which case you'd want to back up the EFI System Partition (ESP). Aside from the MBR's role holding a protective \"partition\" in the GPT system, the MBR is unimportant in EFI-mode booting. (That said, I suspect you've got a BIOS-mode installation, given the lack of an ESP in the data you've shown -- but I could be wrong about this.)\n", "Q: How to boot Ubuntu 14.04 on an Macbook pro intel How to boot Ubuntu 14.04 from an USB drive on a Macbook pro intel\n\nA: If you have done the bootable USB already shut down the MBP and when powering it on leave the left Alt button pressed and then select the pendrive to boot.\n", "Q: Why does Firefox not open pages?

So is there anyway I can fix this? Or is this some sort of bug? If so, where should I report it?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\n\nPackage Information:\ngoogle-earth-stable:\n  Installed: 7.1.4.1529-r0\n  Candidate: 7.1.4.1529-r0\n  Version table:\n *** 7.1.4.1529-r0 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n\nA: I have the same problem .. the only way to fix it as far as I know and according to the other forums about googe earth crashing on start up is on start - up just try not to move the mouse and wait for it to be stable (like when the earth has been fully loaded) It works for me .. so give it a try\n\nA: The only workaround for me was to disconnect from the Internet before starting the program.\nI downloaded the latest version of google-earth-stable_current_amd64.deb and installed it by Ubuntu Software. I am using Ubuntu 16.04.\nThe better solution to my mind is to install such unstable programs on Virtualbox. But what could I do if the Virtualbox didn't install?\n\nA: The solution is to remove (or rename) the ~/.googleearth directory.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Google-Earth\n\n*Rename the directory\nmv ~/.googleearth ~/old_googleearth \n\n\n*Start Google-Earth and be happy.\n\n\n\nWell, with Fedora 23 this didn’t help. I had to install the 32 bit version of Google-Earth. At least it works now.\n\nA: Here is a screenshot of a utility available on Ubuntu Software Cente:\n\nSteps:\n1. Open Ubuntu software center and search for \"googleearth\" (no spaces found what I was looking for, with a space between google and earth it yielded something else).\n\n\n*After that's the software center should look like the image I've posted. Then on your console/terminal run make-googleearth-package.\n\n*Then run sudo dpkg -i googleearth_6.0.3.2197+1.1.0-1_amd64.deb  as the console asks you the same after step 1 is done.\n\n*If some dependencies are unmet run sudo apt-get update then run sudo apt-get -f install\n\n*After step 3 run sudo dpkg -i googleearth_6.0.3.2197+1.1.0-1_amd64.deb.\nThis did the trick, no crashes.\nErik's and 7th's solution worked for a few months till today when no matter how much I tried to not-move the mouse or play around with the globe while it loaded and is flying-to, it crashed.\nEDIT: Chrome and Google Earth will not run simultaneously on my system, wonder why? \nEDIT: Chrome and GEarth work simultaneously now.\n\nA: I had the same problem, I executed it as sudo. In terminal:\nsudo google-earth\n\nIt worked for me.\n", "Q: Download Manager for Ubuntu that can open multiple HTTP connections Is there a download manager that can open multiple connections to the specified URL and download part files only to join the files later and present it as one single file?\nI know about wget, but as far as i know, it opens a single connection to download. (Though can resume a interrupted download) \nIs there such a download manager or a command line tool available?\n\nA: In addition to aria2, there is uGet which has a GUI as well as command line options.\nRun the following commands to install uGet:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:plushuang-tw/uget-stable\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install uget\n\nIt can also use aria2 as a backend engine if you want.\nhttp://uGetdm.com\n\nA: Yes, there is. Run the following commands to install:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install aria2\n\nUse aria2 basically just like wget. I believe the default number of connections is 4 but you can change this by using the -x flag followed by the number of connections you would like to make. For example, to make 8 connections:\naria2c -x 8 http://www.example.com/example.file\n\nclick here for more info\n\nAlso, you can use the DownThemAll extension for firefox.\n", "Q: \"Please enter passphrase for disk\" I'm using Ubuntu 15.04. I don't know what has happened; when I start and enter the passphrase, this message appears: \n\nPlease enter passphrase for disk ubuntu--vg-swap_1 (cryptswap1) on none!\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: If your root partition is not encrypted, or if you're not sure, try this:\nBoot off a Ubuntu install DVD or USB stick and select Try Ubuntu.\nIf you are able to see your files, edit /etc/fstab and remove the line that looks like this:\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-swap_1 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nReboot and it shouldn't ask you for a passphrase.\nIf you can't see any files then your root partition is encrypted. I personally haven't experienced this issue, so I can't speak with certainty, but the system shouldn't need to access the swap partition to boot... try pushing enter a few times and see if it gives up and continues booting.\n", "Q: Apt-get for Cuda 6.5 Libraries I am trying to install Jetpack 1.1 for an Nvidia Jetson development card on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04.  This is a mostly automated process, but at one point fairly deep into the install the process halts with the following error message:\n\nFailed to install one or more of the following packages: g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf cuda-toolkit-6-5 cuda-cross-armhf-6-5 libgomp1-armhf-cross. Please make sure they are correctly installed with apt-get command before continuing installation.\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward error message, and for three of the five named packages, I think I have successfully applied apt-get. The two bold pages yield the following responses:\n   ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install cuda-toolkit-6-5\n   Reading package lists... Done\n   Building dependency tree       \n   Reading state information... Done\n   E: Unable to locate package cuda-toolkit-6-5\n\nAnd similarly for cuda-cross-armhf-6-5\nHow can I help apt-get find this software?\nEdit:  The CPU is an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3540M CPU @ 3.00GHz\nEdit:  The Nvidia Jetson dev board is an ARM architecture board and my Ubuntu system is not.  However, Jetpack supports cross-compilation from x86 to ARM architectures.  What is not obvious to me is if i7-3540M, being x86-64, is sufficient.  But I strongly suspect it is on the basis of the following outdated dev blog, which sure looks like it's using amd64 as its base example:\nParallel ForAll\n\nA: The packages that could not be installed are of the ARM architecture.\nYour CPU is an Intel one, so such packages cannot be installed on it.\n\nEDIT Jetpack is only available with NVIDIA Nsight Eclipse Edition when using the AMD architecture. The explanation is simple when looking at the required .deb package: cuda-repo-ubuntu1204_6.0-37_amd64.deb\n - it's an AMD 64 bit debian package.\n", "Q: symlink to already existing directory Is there a proper way to link /home/user/app/public to /home/user/public_html, considering the fact that the target already exists?\nIf I do ln -s /home/user/app/public /home/user/public_html, I end up having /home/user/public_html/public.\nI guess it would be possible also to inverse the action such as ln -s /home/user/public_html /home/user/app/public, however I'm not sure how to avoid /home/user/app/public/public_html as the end result.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you wanted to know how to deal with already existing targets. If that's the case, there are two possible scenarios.\n1) the existing target is a file. If this is the case, you can force the creation of the symlink with \"-f\"\n2) the existing target is a directory. If this is the case, then it depends on your current implementation of the ln command. It could have the \"-n\" argument available, which causes symlink to directories be handled properly, instead of duplicating them as you say. \nReference: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/207294/create-symlink-overwrite-if-one-exists\n\nA: Lemme understand your issue in the right way\nYour source is /home/user/public_html and I assume it has files in there. And you want to make a link to this directory right in /home/user/app/public. In this way then, you could do something like ls /home/user/app/public and see the files on that exist on /home/user/public_html.\nIf this is correct, then your source is /home/user/public_html and the target is /home/user/app/public. The proper command is this one:\nln -s /home/user/public_html /home/user/app/public\n\nJust make sure that /home/user/app/public isn't a valid directory or file previous enter the command.\n\nA: I'm not going to get into an elaborate discussion of this as the correct answer has already been selected, but ln simply doesn't work in that way.\nAn alternative solution would be to use mount instead of ln.  I believe the correct command in this case would be:\nsudo mount --bind ~/app/public ~/public_html\n\nNotice the caveat to doing it this way, however: in my experience mount requires privilege so you're going to have to sudo it.  For this reason you can't put it in .profile as that will lock up your session.  You could put it in a script, or you could add it to /etc/fstab.  I don't generally add bound mounts to fstab, but I believe the entry would be:\n/home/user/app/public /home/user/public_html none defaults,bind 0 0\n\nor something very similar.  I'm also pretty certain that you can't use relative paths in fstab, so the paths must be absolute, as I've shown here.\n\nA: As @jotadepicas and @Milkmannetje allude to in the comments, there are a couple ways to deal with this.\nAssuming your source is $source and destination is $target.\n\n*\n\n*Remove the target manually first. This should work on Linux and Mac consistently.\nrm \"$target\"\nln -s \"$source\" \"$target\"\n\n\n\n*If you're on Linux you can use the -T option.\nln -sT \"$source\" \"$target\"\n\n\n\n*If you're on macOS you can use the -F option.\nln -sF \"$source\" \"$target\"\n\n", "Q: How to show files in desktop in KDE 5 like file explorer?

Since you can already decrypt the whole partition ok, you just need to decrypt your home folder now.\nEasiest is probably using the ecryptfs-recover-private script, just run it (optionally telling it where your encrypted private directory is) and it should take care of the rest.\nSee these for more info:\n\n\n*\n\n*man ecryptfs-recover-private\n\n*eCryptfs author Dustin Kirkland's blog post\n\n*Dustin's answer to a similar Q - Trying to mount old encrypted home\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch on Sony Xperia M2 I want to install Ubuntu on my device, but when I run:\nsudo ubuntu-device-flash touch --channel=ubuntu-touch/stable/ubuntu --bootstrap \n\nI get this back:\n2015/06/28 23:13:09 Expecting the device to be in the bootloader... waiting\n2015/06/28 23:13:09 Device is |D2302|\nDevice D2302 not found on server https://system-image.ubuntu.com channel ubuntu-touch/stable/ubuntu \n\nHow I can install Ubuntu on my device? \n\nA: Check if the handset is supported first.

In fact, most other methods are easier and safer to use.\nUbuntu is in no way dependent on Windows. They are separate operating systems. Still, they (and most other OS'es) can coexist without many problems. From the nature of your question I take it that your understanding of what an operating system actually is and does is somewhat limited. You may want to read up on this.\n\nBy default, Ubuntu is installed in partitions using the EXT4 file system. Windows uses the NTFS file system. Most UNIXoids, including Ubuntu, contain drivers for NTFS and can thus access the files on a Windows partition. Windows, on the other hand, does not ship with such drivers and can only access a small variety of file systems (NTFS, FAT).\nYou can install Ubuntu in an EXT4 partition on your hard drive, be there a Windows installed in a NTFS partition on the same drive or not. So multiple OS'es can go on one hard drive.\nYou can even do it the other way around: Install one OS on multiple drives. I'm not talking about RAIDs here. As an example, my core system is installed on a 256GiB SSD, but my user's home directory is stored on a much larger HDD, which gives me a good combination of the speed of a SSD and cheapness of HDDs. Another example could be a network setup where the system core is installed in a network share, and only host-dependent files are stored on local partitions.\n\nSo you see, the installation of Ubuntu is not dependent on the state of a hard drive, or multiple hard drives, before installation. You can install Ubuntu in any way you want, but I recommend you to stick to a simple one-hard-drive-setup, as you seem rather inexperienced with file system management to me.\n\nIf your real question is how to install Ubuntu, please read the official guide on how to do it.\n", "Q: How to install icons on Ubuntu 14.04 using gnome shell?

If it doesn't exist, rm considers the job already done, and just returns with success.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nrm -rf \"$@\"\n\nWhich also means there's not really any point in the script, since you can just run  rm -rf /some/dir instead of  scriptname /some/dir.\n", "Q: Cannot install bluetooth-indicator, ubuntu-desktop or unity-control-center Messages pertain to incompatible dependencies.

If you already have one OS set up, just disconnect the hard drive you don't want to overwrite.\nOnce everything is set with Linux on the SSD and Windows on the HDD, you can add the mount point for the HDD editing /etc/fstab.  You will need to get the uuid of the drive you want to mount though.  \nCreate a mount point in /mnt/ like Windows, or whatever you want to call it.  With the uuid of the drive, mount the ntfs partion at that mount point.\nOnce you have got it configured, you can add the windows boot link to your grub menu by using sudo update-grub.  On the next boot you should see the Windows 7 boot loader.\n", "Q: How to install Budgie on Ubuntu 15.04 I used many guides, and even an offical repo, but all of them result in this\nE: Unable to locate package budgie-desktop\nI also tried building it myself, but that resulted in this.\nmake: *** No rule to make target 'install'.

If I press CTRL+c, the first one will be canceled and 'job 2' would start, I just want to stop second job not to be executed. I tried atq, ps but no luck, with ps -ef I can see only 'job 1' but 'job 2' is not listed, so I can not get PID to use kill. I know I can use && instead of ; but it is too late now, I ran this command by accident on my server instead of my home PC and now I am trying to figure out how to prevent a disaster. \nThis problem is specific to rsync command followed by another command: \n$ rsync ..... ; sudo shutdown -h now\n\nKilling process by ID or killing it's parent will not work.\nAfter several hours of testing, I isolated it to rsync, other commands I am able to terminate with CTRL+c in various orders, but not if they are after some commands like rsync or ping, I tried different Ubuntu versions, kernels, server without sudo user and I could reproduce it everywhere, best way to avoid this problem is to use && after rsync to execute following command only on success exitcode 0:\n$ rsync .... && job 2\n\n\nA: Kill the parent process of job1 with SIGKILL.\nShow the processes in a process tree, eg. with htop or ps axf and kill the parent process of job1 and not job1 itself.\n\nInstall htop with\nsudo apt-get install htop\n\n\nDownvoters, understand the answer before downvoting\n\nA: I think you miss something, When you run two commands seperated by ; you can kill the both commands by the CTRL+c.\njust to be sure try this command:\nfind / -name a ; ls /home\n\nThen kill the above commands with CTRL+c, this would kill both processes, you'll not list your home content. I.e, the next command will not run.\n\nUPDATE: This also will be valid for your rsync command.

You essentially create a tarball, which could be unpacked at the root of your filesystem (the parallel directory structures), but in addition there is a debian folder, which contains scripts which can be run during the process.\nI'm assuming you knew this, so I'm not sure exactly which bit of the process of creating a package, you're unclear on.  \nhttps://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian\nWill give you chapter and verse on creating the package\nhttp://kb.mozillazine.org/Installing_extensions\nSays putting .xpi files in a certain directory will cause firefox to install them on next startup\nhttps://forum.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=804\nTalks about using unopkg to install libreoffice packages from the command line.  \nIf you want hired consultancy to do the grunt work for you, that's a different matter ;-)\n", "Q: mySql not working after upgrading to 15.04 After upgrading from 14.10 to 15.04 when i start rails server it gives this error:\narslion@arslion-Lenovo-B570e:~$ rails s \n/home/arslion/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p481/gems/mysql2-0.3.18/lib/mysql2.rb:31:in `require': Incorrect MySQL client library version!

I decided to create the partition manualy with gparted but whilst the installation of Ubuntu the installer said there were 4GB used on my ssd but it was formated and should be empty.\nThe Disks program says there is a 250GB big partition on my ssd. But when I look at the properties in Nautilus it says there is only 246GB space.\nWhat does it mean? \n\nA: This is normal, formatting will always use up some space. For example, my 2TB HDD is recognised as 1.819 TB.\nThis is for a couple of reasons, the first being the manufacuturer lies about the volume (they will say 1 TB is 1000 MB, not 1024, and so on down).\nThis means my 2 TB HDD is actually 2,000,398,934,016 bytes. This translates to 2,000,398,934,016 / 10243 ~ 1863 GB, or 1.819 TB.\nNote that I've just lost 9% of my disk space, which is close to 200 GB, just because they lie about the space.\nAnd then formatting takes up space. I'm not sure how much, but GParted claims my Disk is 1822 GB (more than my calculations) but there is definitely some loss there.\nAparently,\n\next3 and ext4 file systems take 5% of partition size for security etc.\n\n", "Q: Stopping a postgresql instance For the sake of educational purposes I  have two identical instances of postgresql running on my machine.\nI can easily stop the service of the instance that is running on port 5432 like this :\nsudo service postgresql stop\n\nWhat I like to know is that how I can stop the other instance (it is running on port 5433)\n\nA: Use systemctl\nsudo systemctl stop postgresql\n\n\nA: pg_ctl is the postreSQL way to stop postgreSQL (in Ubuntu and Debian we should use pg_ctlcluster which is a wrapper for pg_ctl). The example in that link uses option `-p 5433\".\nAs suggested by naoko in the comments below, use pg_lsclusters to list clusters.\nAnother way is to give a kill signal to the process running postgresqld. To stop both at once, killall postgresqld might work.\nFinally as suggested in the comment by psyCHOder, pgAdmin can also stop the server, but of course that means installing that package.\n\nA: In Ubuntu use systemctl:\n:~/github/kafka/postgres-kafka-demo$ pg_lsclusters\nVer Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory              Log file\n12  main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/12/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-12-main.log\n\n:~/github/kafka/postgres-kafka-demo$ sudo -u postgres pg_ctlcluster 12 main stop\n[sudo] password for : \n\nWarning: stopping the cluster using pg_ctlcluster will mark the systemd unit as failed.

I am trying to restrict access to my home directory so as to prevent another user from accessing it, even another that user also has sudo permissions.\nI've tried the following commands to achieve this\nsudo chmod 0750 /home/user    \nsudo chmod 0755 /home/user\n\nbut if other user have sudo permissions they can change the permissions easily using\nsudo chmod 0755 /home/user\n\nIs there another way around this?\n\nA: How to encrypt your /home folder:\nBefore doing any of this, you should ensure you have a backup of your home directory and important files.\ninstall the encryption utilities:\nOpen a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nRun it:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils cryptsetup\n\nYou’ll have to encrypt your home directory while you’re not logged in.\nYou’ll need another user account with administrator privileges\nYou create one from Ubuntu’s User Accounts window:\nPress your name on the panel and select User Accounts.\nCreate a new user account and make it an administrator.\nSet a password by pressing the password box.\nAfter creating the user account, log out of your desktop.\nSelect your new user account on the login screen and log in with it.\nOpen a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nRun it, replacing user with the name of your user account:\nsudo ecryptfs-migrate-home -u user\n\nYou’ll have to provide your user account’s password.\nAfter you do, your home directory will be encrypted.\nLog out and log back in as your original user account.\nDo not reboot your system before logging back in!\nAfter you log in, press the Run this action now button to create a recovery passphrase.\nKeep this passphrase somewhere safe – you’ll need it if you have to manually recover your files in the future.\nYou can run the ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase command to view this passphrase at any time.\nAfter restarting your system once or twice and verifying everything works properly, you can delete the user account and remove the backup home folder.\n\nA: You can easily change the permissions for your home directory to protect your private files. To check the permissions on your home directory, press Ctrl + Alt + T to open a Terminal window. Type the following line at the prompt and press Enter. Replace <username> (aka lori) with your own username.\nls –ld /home/lori\n\nAt the beginning of the line, the permissions for the file are listed.\n“The r stands for “read,” the w stands for “write,” and the x stands   for “execute.” Directories will start with a “d” instead of a “-“. You’ll also notice that there are 10 spaces which hold value. You can ignore the first, and then there are 3 sets of 3. The first set is for the owner, the second set is for the group, and the last set is for the world.”\n\nSo, the home directory listed below has read, write, and execute permissions for the owner and read and execute permission for the group and world.\n\nTo change these permissions, type the following line at the prompt and press Enter.\nsudo chmod 0750 /home/lori\n\nType your password when prompted and press Enter.\n\nPress the up arrow twice to use the ls –ld /home/<username> command again to check the permissions. Notice that the permissions for world are all dashes (-). That means that the world cannot read, write, or execute anything in your home directory.\nHowever, users in the same group as you can read and execute files and folders in your home directory. If you don’t want anyone else but yourself to have access to your home directory, enter 0700 as the numbers in the chmod command.\nTo close the terminal window, type exit at the prompt and press Enter.\n\nNow, when other users on the system try to access your home directory, the following dialog box displays.\n\nYou can also set up Ubuntu to use specific permissions when setting up the home directory for a new user you are creating. To do this, you need to edit the adduser configuration file. To do this, type the following command at the prompt and press Enter.\ngksudo gedit /etc/adduser.conf\n\n\nEnter your password in the Password edit box on the dialog box that displays and press Enter or click OK.\n\nScroll down to the DIR_MODE command in the adduser.conf file. The number set is 0755 by default. Change it to reflect the  different types of permissions (r, w, x) you want to grant to the different types of users (owner, group, world), such as 0750 or 0700 as discussed earlier. Click Save.\n\nClose gedit by selecting Quit from the File menu. You can also click the X button in the upper-left corner of the window to close gedit.\n\nClose the Terminal window by clicking the X in the upper-left corner of the window.\n\nNow, the files in your home directory will remain private. Just remember that, if there are other users in the same group as you, you might want to take away the permissions for both group and world for your home directory.\n\nTaken from (where other articles are referenced as well): http://www.howtogeek.com/190084/how-to-prevent-other-users-from-accessing-your-home-directory-in-ubuntu-14.04/\n\nA: You can't do that.

How?\n\nA: There are two parts to this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a user without admin privileges\n\n*Creating a user who's a clone of another\n\n\nTypically, an admin user on Ubuntu is an admin because they are in the sudo group. Membership in sudo gives you both sudoers and Polkit privileges by the default configuration:\n$ grep %sudo /etc/sudoers\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n$ grep sudo /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/51-ubuntu-admin.conf \nAdminIdentities=unix-group:sudo;unix-group:admin\n\nSo, all we need to do is not add a new user to the sudo group. And that doesn't need anything special to accomplish.\nThe second part can be handled by either using the normal adduser command, and then copy everything in your home directory to theirs' using rsync or cp, or specifying your home directory as the skeleton directory to useradd. The first method would look like:\nsudo adduser newuser\n# answer all the questions\nsudo rsync -aP ~bytecommander/ ~newuser\nsudo chown newuser -R ~newuser\n\nThe second would like:\nsudo useradd -mk ~bytecommander newuser\n\n(In both cases, replace bytecommander with your username.)\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a new user.\n\n*Execute the following command:\ncp --no-dereference --recursive --preserve=timestamps, /home/old_user/* /home/new_user/\n\n\n*Delete the data files from old_user that you now don't need any more (documents, pictures, …)\n\nA: *\n\n*From an admin user, create new user (example : 'Joan'). In GUI, u can create it in accounts.\n\n\n*Open terminal and go to /home, take note about user and group in the folder /home/joan, and remove it.\ncd /homels -lasudo rm -rf /home/joan\n\n\n*copy the source user folder to a new user folder, with the same name created before.\nsudo cp -pPR source_user joan\n\n\n*change user and group with the same as before it was removed.\nsudo chown -R joan:joan /home/joan\n\nA: In Ubuntu 20.04, I used these commands:\nsudo cp -pPr /home/user1 /home/user2 \nsudo adduser user2 \nchown -R user2 /home/user2\n\nThen I went into Settings > Users > verify that user2 is a standard user.\n", "Q: syslog-ng activation fail I installed syslog-ng on Ubuntu.

That location is also mentioned in /usr/share/doc/ca-certificates/README.Debian (on Debian 8 Jessie).\n", "Q: What happens if you Trash the Trash? I was just wondering what would happen if I went and moved the Trash located here:\n/home/neo/.local/share/Trash\n\nTo my Trash? I mean if I go to that folder and right-click on the contents and tell it to move it to the Trash.\n\n\n*\n\n*What would happen as it would be trying to move itself inside itself?\n\n*Is there another Trash it would move it into?\n\n*And if so, what if I also Trashed that one?\n\n\nA: You can trash files inside the trash (files inside /home/USERNAME/.local/share/Trash/files/). They will just disappear for a second and then come back to the same Trash folder.\nWhen I tried to trash the Trash folder itself (or its subdirectory \"files\"), I got an error by Nemo file manager that it got an illegal argument. So this seems not to work (at least not with Nemo).\n\nA: A Trash folder is first created when a user deletes a file. Within that folder are three directories: \n\n\n*\n\n*files, where the deleted files are stored until the trash is\nemptied;\n\n*info, which stores information on where the files once were and when\nthey were deleted;\n\n*expunged, to which files are briefly moved when the trash is emptied\n(but may contain some owned by other users from directories you\ndeleted).\n\n\nSo whenever you delete a trash indeed you are calling recursively to create a new dir for the newly trashed files.\nAlso note that Trash exists for every user including the root account plus sometimes you could face some dirs names such as  Trash-0 , Trash-1.

They won't allow the Bash variable $MYN to expand.

Is there a somewhat systematic way to reduce that?\nThe priority is on geting rid of software that is actually active, or sometimes active, without producing relevant results.  \nBut even software that is present as processes sleepin almost always, using only trivial amounts of ressources increases the total complexity of a computer system a lot, so I like to get rid of that with almost the same priority.\n\nA: To see current running processes enter ps u U <username> into the terminal.\nIt will bring up a list of running processes and their status.

I am running 15.04 (with LVM) and I want to create an iso image of my SDD. Installed Clonezilla (sudo apt-get install clonezilla) and tried to use the tool from within 15.04. It tells me \"Error! No existing partitions(s) or no unmounted partition(s) are found! To use Clonezilla to save or clone a partition, the source partition must exist or be unmounted! ...\"\nDid a bit more reading on Clonezilla, and the usual practice appears to be to burn the Clonezilla Live DVD, boot from that, and then clone/restore your primary Ubuntu image. If this is the recommended practice - I have to ask, why is Clonezilla available as a application that can be installed within a Ubuntu instance? \nFor convenience, I would prefer to just clone my SDD from within a running 15.04 instance (as I do with Acronis TrueImage from within my Windows 8 install). Not possible? \nFYI, I have the following configuration sda -> [sda1, sda5 -> [root, swap_1]]. i.e. just one physical SDD with LVM installed.\nI don't mind using some other tool (other than Clonezilla) if that would allow me to clone from within my running Ubuntu instance.\nThanks.\n\nA: Running Clonezilla within Ubuntu allows you to clone unmounted drives. Cloning a drive while it is mounted can and will cause damage. I am not sure how it is possible to clone like how you mentioned in Windows, unless the drive is unmounted. \n\nA: The installed-in-Ubuntu tool is designed to be used with other drives and unmounted partitions - such as an external USB drive, or a separate internal disk, etc.\nAs has been mentioned before, CloneZilla needs an unmounted partition to work safely.  It cannot live-image your current root partition.\nI do not know how Acronis TrueImage works, as it sounds proprietary and Windows only, however it could be doing a live-image of the system (storing partition data and filesystem data, then live-traversing the file system and grabbing data off it), in a similar fashion to how forensic analysts live-image seized machines.  However, without further information on the inner workings of Acronis' tools, the only thing we can say is \"Windows and Ubuntu are different, and have their own quirks.\"\n\nA: It is useful where you have set up a multi-partition environment in which you have a data drive/partition that you want to back up. That is, you can unmount that partition without making important parts of your system unavailable.\nI don't know of any Linux tools that will take an image of a mounted system. I use a bootable USB pendrive with CloneZilla on it which seems convenient to me. http://clonezilla.org/liveusb.php .\nIf you just want to backup some files you could look at rsync .\n", "Q: Grub menu not showing after installing ubuntu 15.04 in dual boot with windows I have a lenovo g50-80 windows 8.1 is preinstalled in uefi mode. I changed the mode to legacy mode then installed ubuntu 15.04. but even after installing it boot menu was not coming. Then I changed the boot order to legacy first. \nThereafter, when I loaded system grub menu came but after the login screen in ubuntu it showd nothing. Then I restarted and selected the windows option from grub menu but windows was corrupted I had to recover it using recovery drive.\nUbuntu 15 i\n\nA: Ubuntu will install perfectly fine on the G80 using UEFI mode. Do the following to install Ubuntu properly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Return the laptop to the original boot setting, not legacy\n\n*Download Rufus to create the bootable USB drive (which works with UEFI and MBR)\n\n*Reboot with flash drive connected (pressing F8 for boot options or F1 for BIOS setup whichever allows you to boot from USB)\n\n*Install Ubuntu as normal (by creating custom partitions \"only need root '/' and swap partition or '/home' if so desired\") or choosing \"along side Windows\". This would be the quick way to get Ubuntu installed on the computer. \n\n\nAlso whenever you remove the partitions for a Ubuntu installation, because grub is installed you have to run a Windows installer to fix the boot for Windows. When you insert the Windows installation media choose \"Repair my computer>Troubleshoot>Advanced>Command prompt\". Run the following command:\nbootrec.exe /fixmbr \nThis will fix the Windows boot loader so Windows boots right up after restarting, if you don't have something else installed that requires a boot loader.\nI would suggest starting over with Ubuntu if you can to properly install it. Get booted up into the installer, remove the old partitions (not the Windows ones), and then recreating them again. This would ensure a fresh install of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How is Ubuntu pronounced?

Can I adjust GRUB loader settings from the booted Ubuntu OS? but this refers to changing the default highlighted operating system for unattended boot, which I solved by using the grub-customizer as mentioned in the answers of such question.\nMy question is related to the ability to set up something like mouse compatibility, which will react to the touch screen pressing, or physical button's binding in order to just move the marker to the desired operating system and bind another button to work as the return key in order to accept the selection.\nAnother good scenery would be to bind the Volume+ and Volume- for moving the selection and, when hitting the Volume keys don't stop the clock which seems to stop when the user interacts with the GRUB options.\nAny help is appreciated a lot.\nOh! Yes. I have to explain that I need this because of The Slate's size is very convenient for the outdoors work in minimal space conditions. I set up several things related to telecommunications which forces me to go up on high towers or work in small size conditions where a laptop is not a solution and when hanging upside down, the slate and companions (docking, keyboard, mouse) is too difficult.\nThe dual boot thing is needed because of Ubuntu is faster than anything when it is about setting up certain things which you can access via telnet or ssh, and in such conditions, saving time is a must! But... unfortunately the final tests should be done in a Windows environment.\nThank you for your help!\n\nA: I know two workarounds which may not be very convenient but should do the trick. They involve telling the bootloader from inside a booted operating system to reboot into another OS.\nOn the one hand grub-reboot which should work from inside ubuntu and, as the name says, will only work with GRUB as the bootloader. On the other hand there's iReboot which is a free program for Windows. That only works with a windows bootloader. I'm not sure if all types of Windows-bootloaders are supported but on Win7-64bit it works just fine for me. Setting up either method will only take couple of minutes.\nFor more info on iReboot have a look at the official website of NeoSmart Technologies.\nFor instructions on using the grub-reboot method, you can follow one of these two guides: How to reboot into Windows from Ubuntu? or https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43196/how-can-i-tell-grub-i-want-to-reboot-into-windows-before-i-reboot Following either guide should work for your setup, just make sure to set Ubuntu as your default boot entry in GRUB when configuring. Vice versa if you choose to use iReboot, make sure to set Windows as default enty in Windows bootloader.\nOne last note on the difference of those two methods: iReboot provides a graphical user interface per default while grub-reboot is usually done via terminal. If you want to use grub-reboot without tiping in a terminal you can easily create a custom starter for that cause.\n", "Q: What happens if I attempt to delete Ubuntu itself while logged in? What would happen if I delete the / directory while logged as root into Ubuntu?\nWould I get some sort of error to the effect of Error: unable to self-destruct? Or would I actually be able to delete the directory?\n\nA: I did try this out on a live USB for answering a question on Quora some time ago (there's another great answer there by Eric Bowersox).\nFirst attempt on an installed system where I was confident nothing would happen:\n# cd /\n# rm -rf /\nrm: it is dangerous to operate recursively on `/'\nrm: use --no-preserve-root to override this failsafe\n# rm -rf .\nrm: cannot remove directory: `.'\n#\n\nSo, I tried it on a live USB (quoting from my original post):\n\nEric Bowersox inspired me to try it out on a live USB (without\n  persistence). Like he said, a huge number of errors about files\n  currently being used, plus another huge set of errors about the\n  read-only file system being used ended up with parts of the GUI\n  vanishing in stages: first the icons in the Unity launcher, then the\n  icon for the HUD, then icons in the system tray. When it all ended\n  (remarkably quickly), only the terminal could focused, clicking\n  anywhere else didn't work. I could open anything else, not even the\n  preferences of the terminal. Menus of the localization and the clock\n  applets opened, but didn't work.\nSwitching to the other ttys worked once (I didn't get around to trying\n  any commands), but once I switched back to the GUI, nothing worked.\nHere's how it looked then: \nNothing worked at this point. Except for the power button and the\n  Magic SysRq keys.\n\n\nDeleting the shared libraries or rm itself shouldn't cause any problems, since both would have been loaded into memory when rm started.\n\nA: So I did it in a running Ubuntu 14.10 VM inside Virtualbox. I did not bother to install it myself but downloaded one directly from osboxes.org\nRunning sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root / in a terminal caused this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some buttons began to disappear in the launcher\n\n*Then the launcher was gone\n\n*And finally all the desktop with the terminal running disappeared\n\n*Left with a total blue screen (sic)\nThat was only the visible part. I didn't let it run very long and  shut down the machine.\nSo rm was not completely succesfull because there was some files lying around still: /bin, /run, some part of /lib, and /var\nBut no /boot and no kernel left so it was no bootable again even though the modules were still there.\nEdit:\nDoing it from a console (Ctrl-Alt-F1 or Right-Ctrl F1 in vbox) is much more sucessfull though less spectacular.\nIt spits out errors about /sys file it can't delete , the same in /proc. But there is nothing left after it completes. Only some devices under /dev and some files in /run. \n\nA: DO NOT EVER DO THIS, but if you did sudo rm -rf / the rm command, running as root, would happily start deleting. If it found a file, it would delete it,. If rm found a directory, it would enter the directory, delete all the files, then delete the directory. Eventually, rm will run out of files to delete, or will delete a file rm needs (like a dynamic library):  \n$ ldd $( type -p rm)\nlinux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffd4a978000)\nlibc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f905b7be000)\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f905bbcc000)\n\nWhen rm deletes /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 or /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 it will probably break.  \nLinux takes its philosophy from Unix: \"Powerful tools are powerful, keep fingers out of the machinery\".\n\nA: If your goal is to remove the / folder and all subfolders, you could boot to a Live PenDrive and use Gparted to remove the partition that / is on and rebuild it, if that is what you want.  If you want all other folders under root that are on separate partitions, you could do the same with the other partitions.  You just can't do it on purpose from the command line when that's where you booted from. \n", "Q: Cannot format memory stick to fat32 I am trying to format my usb stick on /dev/sdc, partition sdc1:\nsudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdc1\n\nI get the following for a few seconds, no error:\nmkfs.fat 3.0.26 (2014-03-07)\n\nHowever, sudo fdisk -l lists /dev/sdc1 as 'Linux':\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdc1            2048   122879999    61438976   83  Linux\n\nand I still can't mount it on a FAT32-only system.\nI have tried to zero the stick first, sfdisk, removing -F 32, nothing works.\nHow do I format my USB stick?\n\nEdit: I tried to format from nautilus.

The issue I think is with my laptop only because in hostel same problem happens for all netgear routers that I have discussed above.\nedit\n I did kept no security for router but still the problem persists\n\nA: Failure to ping google.com by name only indicates a DNS problem. Failure to ping by address indicates a connection problem. If I traceroute to google.com I get an address of 216.58.216.238 (likely one of many servers in the farm - the readers traceroute will vary).\nIf you can't ping google.com but can ping 216.58.216.238 you have an issue with DNS which you can likely resolve by changing the DNS server config in your router (assuming DHCP configuration for your client. Make these changes in the client configuration instead if using static IP addressing) Google public DNS server is at 8.8.8.8 as I recall your ISP can provide you with their DNS server address(es).\nBeing unable to ping 192.168.1.1 indicates that you may not be using the correct address as configured in the Netgear router. This address can be changed in the router configuration which can be reset to factory defaults if it's been mucked up beyond your ability to fix. It's also possible to disable wireless configuraton of the router. Use a Ethernet cable rather than wifi to access the router after restoring to default settings and set it up properly from scratch.\nNOTE: Make sure you know the security type (encryption level)  in use before resetting as well as the wireless passcode or you'll end up having to reconfigure every client on the network (good practice perhaps, but avoidable with a bit of pre-planning in most cases)\n\nA: doubt netgear has something to do with it.\ni use netgear router and it works just fine with ubuntu, but i have a different wireless card.\ntry checking additional drivers in dash menu, if you can use other driver for your wi-fi - try it.\nalso try checking is your IP4 address currently used by a windows machine within same network, i saw some problems with embedded in wi-fi DHCP`s when there are different OS computers in same network.\nanother thing you can try is installing different software on your wi-fi router, like DD-WRT or Tomato.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 14.04 installer does not recognise partitions on hard disk with GPT For a friend I'm repairing a computer so I have a brand new hard drive lying around. I've found documentation that Linux is capable of booting from a hard drive even if the computer is not UEFI enabled.\nSo using GParted I've prepared the hard disk for GPT and I've created three BTRFS partitions on it for boot, root and home. The GDisk program indeed detects GPT is available.\nWhen I try to install Kubuntu 14.04 I'm getting stuck immediately. The installer complains about not enough space being available on the drive. So somehow it does not find the three partitions.\nI've found a few comparable questions on this site and on SuperUser but all involve a dual install and they more or less all suggest zapping GPT in favor of MBR, which is not what I want.

As I was configuring i3, it crossed my mind to check and see if the power key would behave the same way as it had under Xfce/Xmonad.

It didn't work with UEFI enabled.\nIn the live session and with the installed OS the bottom of the screen (about as high as the trash icon in the launcher, I only can see its top) keeps always black. It's black already in grub.\nI tried to figure out whether it has something to do with UEFI (the preinstalled Windows 8 only boots with UEFI) but I couldn't get Ubuntu to boot with UEFI. When selecting UEFI in the bios settings, Windows Boot Loader appears in the boot mediums (for whatever reason). I made sure to place the HDD above the Windows Boot loader but it goes straight to Windows and doesn't load grub. With an USB stick I can't get Ubuntu to boot any further than to the Ubuntu logo with the dots under it. I also can't manage to do the change of settings as explained by the thread linked to above because the part when I could change the settings is skipped.\nI also tried to figure out whether this can be cured by installing additional graphics drivers but none helped and some prevented me from logging in via GUI (neither into my account nor into the guest account, logging in via a TTY, however, worked and that's how I removed the driver afterwards).\nI don't care at all whether I can use Windows or not, I just want the black stripe to vanish.\n\nA: I just solved the problem and don't want to delete the question because I think this could be interesting for other people as well.\nI simply changed\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nto\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nin /etc/default/grub, ran sudo update-grub rebooted and the problem was resolved. :)\n", "Q: Cannot install mysql server 5.5 on ubuntu 14.04 I have tried many ways to install mysql-server.

So there is no real need to upgrade. Please note, 14.04 will be supported until April 2019, and 14.10 only up to July this year, so you are in fact taking a step backwards.\nIf this is a production machine, I would strongly recommend staying with 14.04 until the next LTS version rolls along. \nOn the other hand, if this computer is just for testing and all your personal data is fully backed up, you could consider trying the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*as root, edit manually the file /etc/apt/sources.list, replacing all occurrences of trusty with utopic. \n\n*sudo aptitude update\n\n*sudo aptitude safe-upgrade\nThis procedure has been known to work to upgrade between Debian versions.

At home it could get a DHCP address or a static address 192.168.2.x but at work it must get the static IP address 10.10.34.122.\nI know how to assign a static IP address manually by editing /etc/network/interfaces but once I do that, I can't reach the device any more if I'm in the other network, so it needs an auto detection.\nMy idea was to create two files (/etc/network/home.if and /etc/network/work.if) and copy them as needed. I would start with the 192 address and try to ping my DSL router. If it responds, it should use home.if, if not, use work.if.\nSo far I think this script should achieve what I want:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Start with my home setting\ncp /etc/network/home.if /etc/network/interfaces\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n# If I can ping my router, I'm at home\nping=$(ping 192.168.2.1 -c 1)\n#echo $ping\nif [[ \"$ping\" =~ \"1 received\" ]]; then\n        echo \"home\"\n        cp /etc/network/home.if /etc/network/interfaces\nelse\n        echo \"work\"\n        cp /etc/network/work.if /etc/network/interfaces\nfi\n\n# Apply the detected settings\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nWhere do I need to put this script that it is executed in the correct place during the startup sequence?\n\nA: You can call it from the file /etc/rc.local. You can either add the lines to that file or call the script there. Whatever you choose you have to add it above the line 'exit 0'.\nBTW: I suggest you add a wait command after the first network restart because it can take a few seconds for the network to start. If the ping comes to early you can get an incorrect result.\n", "Q: Ubuntu wifi problems with new router I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and have recently installed a new TP-LINK TL-WR841N Wireless N router at my home.

For example migrating from ubuntu x.x to ubuntu x.x but on a new machine.\n2) Can I restore a backup on other distros (previous version of Ubuntu but also fedora etc..)?\n\nA: Yes and yes.\nDeja Dup is a file-based backup utility, which is actually a front-end to Duplicity, and can restore those files to any drive or operating system independent of things like filesystem type or partition size.\nYou can use it to back up only certain folders, or to back up all the files and directories in a filesystem.  What it won't back up is your partition table, filesystem type, boot loaders etc.  This makes it flexible.\nRestoring would involve restoring to a folder of your choice.  If you wanted to restore system folders (ie all of / including /bin, /lib and so forth) you could do this, via something like a live CD, if you know how to do the partitioning and install the boot manager later.  But a simpler, typical use case would be, you re-install Ubuntu (or an OS of your choice), then restore your data files and folders you need to a certain directory where you can then access them.  You cannot directly browse the files that are backed up, you need to restore them to somewhere first then browse them from there.\nIf you back up from a Linux based system and restore to a Linux based system it should preserve file permissions.\nYou can even restore the backed up files from within Windows, though the process is somewhat involved and not for the faint-hearted.  But the ability to restore from a Live CD would mean you can restore to just about file system anywhere.\n\nA: Absolutely you can. In addition to other solution, I'll add steps to do that quoted from DejaDup wiki.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Déjà Dup. Choose “Applications → Accessories → Déjà Dup Backup\nTool”.\n\n*Click on the big “Restore” button.\n\n*A dialog will appear asking where your backup files are stored (your\n“Backup location”). Choose it from the dropdown or choose “Other…”.\nOn this same screen, select whether you encrypted the backup or not.\nClick “Forward”.\n\n*Choose the date you want to restore from. Usually you can just leave\nthis alone, as the default is the most recent backup. Click\n“Forward”.\n\n*Choose where to restore. Since this is a full system backup, leave\nit as the default (to restore over your current install). Click\n“Forward”.\n\n*Review your selections and click “Restore”.\n\n*Wait. Your files won’t appear in your home directory until the\nentire restore is finished.\n\n*Reinstall any programs that you enjoyed in your previous install.\n\n", "Q: Cannnot run a .sh file in terminator I am having trouble running a .sh script file in Terminator, however I can run it perfectly fine in the default terminal Ubuntu comes with(gnome-terminal).\nThis is what I get when trying to run it in terminator:\nsenpai@senpai:~$ '/home/senpai/Documents/Stuff/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64/ts3client_runscript.sh\n> \n> '\nbash: /home/senpai/Documents/Stuff/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64/ts3client_runscript.sh\n\n: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: I think your problem in the whitespace(space ,tabs , Enter, whatever...) added to the name of the script.\nAnd here obviously you press enter\nI'll show you in example using terminator in my system:\n$ '/home/maythux/Documents/ts3client_runscript.sh'\nOutpout\n\nWhile when running:\n$ '/home/maythux/Documents/ts3client_runscript.sh\n> \n> '\nbash: /home/maythux/Documents/ts3client_runscript.sh\n\n: No such file or directory\n\nSo all you have is to remove those whitespaces(enter in your case)\n'/home/senpai/Documents/Stuff/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64/ts3client_runscript.sh'\n\n", "Q: Hard drive space I've recently installed Ubuntu 15.04 alongside my mac osx on my macbook pro. \nWhen I wanted to install, I chose to install it alongside my osx.

When I'm installing something now like csgo dedicated server is it going to install under my user account or under sda5 ? Can't I merge them? That I have all of those 88gb on my user account?\n\n\nA: What you are seeing is a little misleading, because most of those lines aren't real partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*The line with filesystem udev is a virtual filesystem that does not exist on disk, and just represents some data in memory.\n\n*Lines with filesystem tmpfs are virtual filesystems that exist only in memory, or swapped to the existing swap partition.  They are not from actual partitions on the disk.\n\n*The line with filesystem cgmfs also appears to be a virtual filesystem related to the cgroups manager which you have for some reason.\nThat leaves only three lines referring to actual partitions on the drive: partitions sda5, sda2 and sda3.\nsda5 contains your entire Ubuntu install, is 69GB and is mounted at /.\nsda3 is your Snow Leopard (Mac OS install) which is 55GB and mounted as an add-on drive in /media/fendora/Snow Leopard.\nsda2 is another partition which is 19GB and is entitled \"LINUX\".  I don't know why you have this partition.  It's possible you created it intending for it to be your Linux partition (maybe for a previous Linux install) but you ended up not using it.  It's basically empty.\nWhen you install something in your Ubuntu installation it'll go into that 69GB sda5 partition.\n", "Q: python pip broken on ubuntu My pip is not working anymore.\nHere is the output for a sudo pip install pyjs :\n  File \"/usr/bin/pip\", line 9, in <module>\n    load_entry_point('pip==1.5.6', 'console_scripts', 'pip')()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 356, in load_entry_point\n    return get_distribution(dist).load_entry_point(group, name)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 2476, in load_entry_point\n    return ep.load()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 2190, in load\n    ['__name__'])\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/__init__.py\", line 61, in <module>\n    from pip.vcs import git, mercurial, subversion, bazaar  # noqa\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/vcs/mercurial.py\", line 9, in <module>\n    from pip.download import path_to_url\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/download.py\", line 25, in <module>\n    from requests.compat import IncompleteRead\nImportError: cannot import name IncompleteRead\n\nHow can i repair this ? :(\n\nA:     sudo apt install --reinstall python\n    sudo apt purge python-pip\n    wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n    sudo python get-pip.py\n\nAll problem done \nall of this problem result from /etc/pip.\n\nA: this has been answered here.\nBut I will paste the answer as I don't have enough points to mark this a duplicate.\n\napt-get installs a much older version of pip which can lead to\n  problems, completely remove python-pip with:\napt-get remove --purge python-pip\n\nthen:\ncurl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python\n\nusing sudo if required\n\n\nA: I got the same error.

It says that volume serial number is the eight bytes beginning at offset 0x48 in an ntfs formatted drive/partition so, altering it will change the serial number/UUID. To reproduce it:\ndd if=/dev/sda# of=my_block bs=512 count=1\n\nghexedite2 my_block (or what ever hex editor you like. Alter a byte or two between 0x48 and 0x4f, inclusive)\n\ndd if=my_block of=/dev/sda# bs=512 count=1\n\nI have not tried this myself, but looks interesting.\nNote: dd is Disk Destroy :) so use with caution!\n\nA: To mount an NTFS drive we can also use a disk label only. We can safely change the label from Windows or by using ntfslabel . See\n\n\n*\n\n*Constant UUID on USB install\n\n*How to rename partitions?\nNeedless to say that by using ntfslabel we can also change a partition's UUID (aka serial number).

Note that mysql is probably not the cause of the problem. Linux by default overcommits memory and then when processes actually start to use it, it has to kill some other process to get some memory.\nOften it chooses whatever is big and not much used. You can protect a process from being killed by doing\necho -1000 > /proc/999/oom_score_adj\n\nwhere 999 is the process id. See man proc. The value is -1000 to +1000 to bias the oom killer (less likely to more likely), with -1000 = dont ever kill. \nYou should monitor process memory sizes, eg with top (type M to sort by memory). \nThe output is from the oom manager. php-fpm is probably part of apache. You can often configure apache to kill much reused threads that have grown too much; its a choice between faster cgi and less memory being wasted.\nYou can temporarily disable overcommitting memory with\nsysctl vm.overcommit_memory=2\n\nthen you are more likely to have the memory-hogging process crash, instead of some random process being killed. It's not usually recommended as a permanent setting.\n\nA: These look like process id, user id, and again process id, respectively. Can't see what is in the last column, probably some indication of memory usage.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu Mate on Raid 1 I wanna install ubuntu mate desktop 14.04 LTS on Raid 1 - preferably with LVM and Encryption.\ntha farthest i got so far is. booting live system installing mdadm, creating a raid starting installation.

I have similar lines in dmesg, but nothing more.\n\nA: First, identify the driver for your network device with the command:\nlshw -C network\n\nLook for driver=.\nNext, check the log for clues as to why the device disconnects. I suggest you look at both the driver and what Network Manager is doing:\ncat /var/log/syslog | grep -e some_driver -e etwork | tail -n 20\n\nIdeally, run this just as the internet connection has dropped.\nThen I suggest you search this site and Google for your driver name and \"disconnects\" for possible solutions. You might also edit your question to add additional details and we'll be happy to assist.\nIf you wish to post your syslog result, as it will be lengthy, post it here and give us the link: http://paste.ubuntu.com\nYou have confirmed the infamous e1000e. There are several things you might try. The probable solution that seems to work often, but not always, is to disable gigabit speeds. You can try temporarily with:\nsudo ethtool --change eth0 speed 100 autoneg off\n\nIf this is helpful, we will drop the parameters into rc.local to make them persistent.\n\nA: For whatever reason, these issues became rarer in recent time.\nBesides that, whenever it occurs, I run the following command to disconnect and reconnect:\nnmcli con down \"CONNECTION NAME\" && nmcli con up \"CONNECTION NAME\"\n\nTo speed typing up, I've created an alias for it, by appending the following line to my ~/.bashrc file:\nalias reconnect='nmcli con down \"CONNECTION NAME\" && nmcli con up \"CONNECTION NAME\"'\n\n\nA: What you describe seems like dhcp lease issue. When you connect to the router, dhcp gives you ip for some particular amount of time ( that's what's called lease ), and then that gets renewed.  \nFor example, here's what I have in my syslog:\n$ grep 'renew' /var/log/syslog\nJun 30 20:38:01 anaconda dhclient: bound to 192.168.43.209 -- renewal in 1342 seconds.\nMy assumption,then, is that you still have the IP, so your machine is reported as connected, but in fact the lease hasn't been renewed or has glitched/failed.\nWhat I suggest is try switching the dhcp client that you're using.\nNetworkManager comes with dhclient by default, if I am not wrong. You can try to install dhcpcd (for other options check apt-cache search dhcp). Why I suggest this one is because man NetworkManager.conf says that's the supported one (along with the default one ,dhclient).\nThen in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf you're gonna need this line dhcp=dhcpd , bellow [main]. For example,\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\ndns=dnsmasq\ndhcp=dhcpcd\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nI've had the issue like that where network icon says connected but in fact it's stopped working, but I've realized what's going on only recently, because I'm slowly learning about networking. I won't say that's 100% bulletproof solution, but that's what i can suggest. At least I haven't experienced this issue much after playing around with my dhcp client settings.\nAlso, try disabling ipv6, disable the n-channel wifi (if your card supports it), and power management as suggested in this article: http://itsfoss.com/speed-up-slow-wifi-connection-ubuntu/ These hacks mostly work for speed, but they won't hurt\n", "Q: Use common data folders for two users instead of separate ones I have a 15.04 machine with basically 2 user accounts, an admin and a restricted user. What I want is that both of them have separate home directories (for system/application settings etc.), but use the same data directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop\n\n*Documents\n\n*Music\n\n*Pictures\n\n*Public\n\n*Templates\n\n*Videos\n\n*and maybe some more, program-specific data folders...\n\n\nThose directories therefore have to be outside of those two users' home directory, e.g. be located in /home/shared-data/ or something like that and both users need full access on them.\nIf I navigate through that directory and back upwards in the hierarchy, I want to come out in the same user's home directory where I started, if possible. And the real shared directory should not be publicly accessible by new users, just by those users I specifically allowed.\nAlso, new files and folders created there should automatically be accessible to both users.\nSo what is the easiest way to move all data from the users' current home directories to this external location, then replacing the original folders with links/mounts/whatever to the new shared directory, so that it looks like before? \n\nA: Don't move anything. Just use links. For example, say your normal user is usera and your second one is userb. Presumably, userb is a brand new account and doesn't have any data you want to keep. So, delete the directories in question and recreate them as links, then set up the right permissions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the directories and recreate as links\nsudo rmdir ~userb/{Desktop,Documents,Music,Pictures,Public,Templates,Videos}\nfor i in Desktop Documents Music Pictures Public Templates Videos; do\n    sudo -u userb ln -s ~usera/\"$i\" ~userb\ndone\n\n\n*Create a new group and add both users to this group:\nsudo groupadd foo\nsudo usermod -aG foo usera\nsudo usermod -aG foo userb\n\n\n*Change the group ownership of the directories you want to share to this new group:\nchgrp -R foo ~usera/{Desktop,Documents,Music,Pictures,Public,Templates,Videos}\n\n\n*Set the permissions on the target directories to rwx for the group and set the SETGID bit on the directory so that new files will belong to the right group. \nchmod -R g+rwxs ~usera/{Desktop,Documents,Music,Pictures,Public,Templates,Videos}\n\n\n*Set the Access Control List settings to set the permissions for newly created files/directories:\nsetfacl -d -m g:foo:rwx ~usera/{Desktop,Documents,Music,Pictures,Public,Templates,Videos}\n\nThat's it. Now, the directories in ~/userb are links to those in ~/usera and both users have read/write access to them. \n", "Q: core file size with ulimit My question is probably not related to Ubuntu in particular, but since my desktop running this OS, I came to this forum.\nI am trying to change the core file size using ulimit -c command as follows:\n$ ulimit -a\ncore file size          (blocks, -c) 0\ndata seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited\nscheduling priority             (-e) 0\nfile size               (blocks, -f) unlimited\npending signals                 (-i) 7959\nmax locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64\nmax memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited\nopen files                      (-n) 1024\npipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 8\nPOSIX message queues     (bytes, -q) 819200\nreal-time priority              (-r) 0\nstack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192\ncpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited\nmax user processes              (-u) 1024\nvirtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited\nfile locks                      (-x) unlimited\n\nChanging the limitation:\n$ ulimit -c unlimited\n\nObserving the result:\n$ ulimit -a\ncore file size          (blocks, -c) unlimited\ndata seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited\nscheduling priority             (-e) 0\nfile size               (blocks, -f) unlimited\npending signals                 (-i) 7959\nmax locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64\nmax memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited\nopen files                      (-n) 1024\npipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 8\nPOSIX message queues     (bytes, -q) 819200\nreal-time priority              (-r) 0\nstack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192\ncpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited\nmax user processes              (-u) 1024\nvirtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited\nfile locks                      (-x) unlimited\n\nIndeed the limit is changed.\nHowever, when I open another terminal and check the value, I still see zero value in core file size.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are changes made using ulimit command affect only current process, i.e. in this case the bash?\n\n*I launch a program from shell as a fore- or-background process.

Is there a better ownership scheme?\nEither way, thanks in advance.\n\nA: So you can try to create a group like its said in the links given by you, then add in this group all the users that can modify the files which belong to wp-user. finally all the files creates by wp-user need to let the write permission to this group.\nOr create a directory where only users who are authorised to modify the files of wp-user can acces to this directory\nso the steps are:\nsudo addgroup ftpaccess //create group ftpacess\nsudo adduser paul ftpacess // add user paul to the group ftpacess\n\nOr\nsudo adduser paul -ingroup ftpaccess --shell /usr/sbin/nologin //command in the first link\n\nthen wp-user will create a file you will change the group owner\nsudo chgrp ftpacces file\n\nNote: you can put your wp-user in the groop ftpaccess then all the users in this group can modify it. (Dont know if its good for security)\n", "Q: Cannot install tor service When I try to install tor I get:\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree\nReading state information...

It is needed for UEFI.\n/dev/sda3 must be Ubuntu OEM distribution image.\nI do not know what /dev/sda2 is for, but it may be also needed for factory restore.\nRegarding swap partition that you call \"exchange memory\" I can say that 4 GB will be enough.

You may ask , what if the field contains spaces, like ( 1 ) or (1 ) ? Wouldn't that remove only (1 in the last example ?

I've got one PM (16 cores, 48GB RAM), running 7 (initially empty) VMs, which were created using virt-install. I used virt-install to create two NAT'ed networks: 'private' to which all 7 VMs are attached and 'public' to which only 2 are attached. The PM runs MAAS and provides DHCP & DNS only on the 'private' network. (I chose the names 'private' and 'public' as I assumed that one of the required networks would be for doing MAAS/openstack-y stuff, and the other would be for accessing whatever service ultimately gets deployed on the (nested) VMs that will ultimately get created). The systems get enlisted and commissioned so that, by the end of step 3 in the Ubuntu procedure, I have 7 nodes, all marked 'Ready'.\nProblem: As per step 4 in the Ubuntu procedure, I run openstack-install, provide the MAAS key, specify the MAAS server as the PM's IP on the 'private' network, and after about 15 minutes it fails. \nOther info: The status line of openstack-install's TUI

See here for more information: How to configure MAAS to be able to boot virtual machines\nThe other problem I see is that you seem to be running the installer as root.

So I can look-up users and their passwd lines.\nBut I failed to automount the user homes. What I did so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add autofs to services in sssd config\n\n*Create an automount config auto.home: * -fstype=cifs,rw,sec=krb5 ://myserver/&\nI just couldn't find any instructions how to integrate autofs with realmd/sssd approach in Ubuntu 14.04. Any hints?\nWhen I try it manually as root user (sudo -s)\nkinit myuser\nmount -t cifs -o rw,user=myuser,sec=krb5 //myserver/myuser /home/myuser\n\nI get: Permission denied. Which may be due to the fact that sssd uses some hashing algorithm to calculate a user ID, while the Samba server uses some enumeration.\nSo actually want sssd to handle all credential stuff.\n\nA: You can mount them automatically at system startup by adding entries to fstab. You have to take care to provide your user credentials, which can be done via a file in your home dir.\nPlease find the details at:\n\"Mounting cifs URL not implemented yet\" when I try to mount a samba share\n", "Q: Boot ISO file via GRUB2 I'm migrating my multiboot USB drive from syslinux+grub to grub2. I'm now searching a way to boot my ISO files. I'm searching for a chainload method. So I don't want to add kernel and initrd parameters.\nThis is, how it looks like in grubs menu.lst:\ntitle MiniTool Partition Wizard 9\nfind --set-root /multiboot/ISOS/pwfree9.iso\nmap /multiboot/ISOS/pwfree9.iso (hd32)\nmap --hook\nroot (hd32)\nchainloader (hd32)\n\nHow would this look like in grub.cfg?\n\nA: To create a Grub2 menuentry you must add it to the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file. \nAdd the menuentry below the existing lines in the file.\nOpen the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file as root with a text editor.\nsudo nano /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\nAdd the menuentry.\nSave the file.\nUpdate the Grub 2 menu.\nsudo update-grub \n\nSystemRescuecd example:\nmenuentry '[loopback]systemrescuecd-x86-4.5.2' {\n    set isofile='/boot/iso/systemrescuecd-x86-4.5.2.iso'\n    loopback loop $isofile\n    linux (loop)/isolinux/rescue64 isoloop=$isofile\n    initrd (loop)/isolinux/initram.igz\n}\n\nUbuntu example:\nmenuentry '[loopback]ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64' {\n    set isofile='/boot/iso/ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso'\n    loopback loop $isofile\n    linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz.efi boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile locale=en_US.UTF-8\n    initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz\n}\n\nSource\n\nA: You can use grub4dos and the partnew command but I don't think grub2 is capable of doing the same thing though.\nThe partnew command writes a partition entry to the USB drive (e.g. ptn #4) and then you can boot 99% of all linux ISOs directly with no special menu - the same menu will work for pretty much all linux ISOs.\nhttp://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/tails\nhttp://www.easy2boot.com/faq-/how-e2b-works/\n", "Q: compress and email option in right click I'm using Ubuntu 15.04 with the Nemo file manager.\nHow can I enable a right click option which compresses files into a zip archive and attaches it to a new E-Mail in Thunderbird?\n\nA: Create a script(.nemo_action) to do that, here you can find a sample for correct syntax.\nWhen you finish your script add it to nemo-actions to make it available to right click. You have to add it to \n$HOME/.local/share/nemo/actions/\nThe script has to have .nemo_action extension\nNow you have to make script for compressing and mail:\nAdd the need to the script:\nTo compress using zip for example:\nzip -r attach.zip attachFiles\n\nNow attach it to  a new mail in thunderbird:\nthunderbird -compose \"attachment='/path-to- attach.zip'\"\n\nSo this script will be called by the nemo_action one\nSome useful links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Arch Nemo Wiki\n\n*Behind the curtain.. Nemo actions\n\n*How to make nemo support compressing files by context menu?\n\nA: You need two scripts for that: The Nemo action script and the script that will actually do the work: (Well, actually one would be enough, but it would make maintenance veeery annoying)\nThe action script for the right click will have to go into a very specific directory:\n~/.local/share/nemo/actions/compress-and-mail.nemo_action:\n\nAs it doesn't expand ~ or $HOME, you'll have to give a full path.\n[Nemo Action]\nName=Compress and E-Mail\nComment=zip-compress files and send them with Thunderbird\nIcon-Name=thunderbird\nExec=/home/saravanabawa/.local/nemo_mail_compress.sh %F\nSelection=notnone\nExtensions=any\nEscapeSpaces=true\n\nThe other script will be a bash script to compress the selected files, attach the temporary archive to a new message and delete it as soon as Thunderbird closes. The file will have to be at the location you specified in the Exec= line in the previous script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nATT=$(mktemp /tmp/attachment.XXXXX.zip)             #Generate temp file\nrm $ATT                                             #Remove temp file\nzip -rj $ATT $@                                     #Compress files\nthunderbird -compose \"attachment='file://${ATT}'\"   #Attach zip to message\nrm $ATT                                             #Delete archive when done\n\nYes, I'm first creating a temp file and then delete it again. This way a file name is generated, but zip doesn't complain about the file not being a zip archive.\nThe script I created allows you to attach multiple files and directories. Due to some limitations, it is either possible to compress the whole path (the archive will take the whole path as name, eventually containing the directory tree from / to all of the compressed files) or to omit all directories, i.e. all files will be at root level. Duplicate file names in  different directories will cause the program not to work properly (I never use zip, I don't know how it will react). If you wish the first behavior, remove the j switch from the zip command, else leave it there.\n\nPS: Recipients may be suspicious if they receive an E-Mail with an attachment called attachment.JgHdI.zip (name generated by mktemp). So you may want to rename the archive inside Thunderbird.\nAnother option would be to query for an archive name, e.g. using Zenity. An adapted script could look like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nATT=\"/tmp/$(zenity ---entry --title='Enter file name' --text='Please name the attachment archive').zip\"\nzip -rj $ATT $@\nthunderbird -compose \"attachment='file://${ATT}'\"\nrm $ATT\n\n\nA: For Thunderbird in Ubuntu 16.10 for Nemo 3.20 I adapted this solution: http://www.badpenguin.org/nemo-action-send-to-email\n\n\n*\n\n*go to /usr/share/nemo/actions\n\n*open as root (in Nemo) \n\n*copy sample script\n\n*rename to: thunderbird.nemo_action\n\n*open it and insert following content:\n[Nemo Action]\nName=Attach to Email\nComment=Attach to Email\nExec=thunderbird -compose to=,\"attachment='%U'\"\nIcon-Name=thunderbird\nSelection=notnone\nExtensions=nodirs;\nSeparator=,\nEscapeSpaces=false\n\n\n*close nemo: nemo -q\n\n*on right clicking a file in Nemo you will now find \"Attach to Email\" in the menu!\n\n", "Q: Unity dash: Sorry, there is nothing that matches your search I face with problem\n\nSorry, there is nothing that matches your search\n\nWhen searching in applications.

And fix is not in current versions.\nthis bug was fixed in the package ubiquity - 2.18.8.3 jan 2015\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1265192\n\nA: Assuming the Boot Repair output you posted is still accurate (you note in a comment that you re-installed Ubuntu, but it's not clear if that was before or after you ran Boot Repair), it seems that the GRUB setup scripts are not detecting Windows. There are several things you can try to fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You should disable the Windows Fast Startup feature. This feature turns a Windows \"shutdown\" operation into a \"suspend-to-disk\" operation. The trouble is that the disk is then left in an inconsistent state, which can cause other OSes to fail to read shared partitions, or may mis-read them. This includes the partition where boot loaders are stored. Note that this feature is entirely separate from firmware options that may have similar names.\n\n*In Ubuntu, open a Terminal and type sudo update-grub. This will cause it to regenerate the GRUB configuration file. You may need to do this after you disable Fast Startup.\n\n*To temporarily boot Windows, you might use the firmware's own boot manager to bypass GRUB. Typically you get to this tool by hitting Esc or a function key early in the boot process. You may have used this tool to get your Ubuntu boot medium to boot.\n\n*Another way of temporarily booting Windows is to try disabling Secure Boot and use a CD-R or USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager. If it works, it should detect both Windows and Ubuntu and let you boot either one.\n\n*If disabling Fast Startup and re-running update-grub doesn't help, the Boot Repair tool might help. Unfortunately, that's a bit of a gamble; it might do a better job than the standard tools or it might not. Also, it writes its new configuration over the old one, and in some rare circumstances, it will actually make matters worse.\n\n*If rEFInd can boot Windows, you can install it to your hard disk by installing the Debian package or PPA. You'll then use rEFInd rather than GRUB to select your boot OS. Note that you need not disable Secure Boot to use rEFInd in this way, unlike the USB and CD-R versions.\n\n\nYou can try these options in any order you like, although at some point, you really must disable Fast Startup in Windows, since it's a trouble-maker.\n", "Q: Read / Write permissions in /opt directory I installed Android Studio in my /opt directory without a hitch and have been using it.

First tried Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 and it was quite the same. Could somebody please help me?\n\nA: First, if you intend to dual-boot with an already-installed Windows system, go back into your firmware and disable the BIOS/CSM/legacy option that you enabled. Such a configuration creates the opportunity for problems related to the boot mode. If you intend to single-boot Ubuntu, then the boot mode isn't so important. If you can't get the Ubuntu installer to boot except by enabling BIOS/CSM/legacy support, then chances are you either have a Secure Boot problem (in which case disabling that feature in your firmware may help) or you created your boot medium incorrectly (in which case you should examine the options you used to be sure the program creates an EFI-bootable medium or switch to another program). I cover all of this in more detail in this Web page.\nSecond, your description of the problem is a little unclear; I'm not sure what you mean by \"it skips part of the left side of the screen\" -- are you saying the screen is partially blank?

When I navigate to that file in file manager, it says it's size is 0 bytes. I'm using Xubuntu 15.04. I'm thoroughly confused.\n\nA: /proc (manpage, kernel docs) is a virtual filesystem (as is /sys - kernel docs). Files in /proc aren't real files, but ways to access information and settings from the kernel. You shouldn't use an editor to edit files in /proc, but write directly to these files:\nsudo sh -c 'echo foo > /proc/some/file'\necho foo | sudo tee /proc/some/file\n\nWhen you attempt to read or write from it, the kernel converts the actions to system calls internally and does the right thing. Some editors can still view the contents (try Vim, for example), but writing to it is a different story.\n\nFor a special class of files, those in /proc/sys (kernel docs, Arch Wiki), there's another alternative. You can use the configuration files in /etc/sysctl.conf and /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf to make permanent changes to their values. A file /proc/sys/foo/bar can be set using a key foo.bar in one of these files.\nFor example, /proc/sys/vm/swappiness can be set by adding a /etc/sysctl.d/90-swappiness.conf containing:\nvm.swappiness = 10\n\nAnd running:\nservice procps start\n\nYou can also make one-off changes (that will not survive the next reboot) by using the sysctl command directly:\nsudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10\n\n", "Q: I get some error when i insert this particular USB disk in , dosent give any error in other OS Says unable to mount at heading\n\nError mounting /dev/sdb1 at /media/user/HRM_CCSA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV5: Command-line `mount -t \"udf\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,iocharset=utf8,umask=0077\" \"/dev/sdb1\" \"/media/user/HRM_CCSA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV5\"' exited with non-zero exit status 32: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1,\n           missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n\nI get this error everytime I insert this particular USB disk.

I'm very novice when it comes to OS management, so if this question is ignorant please be kind.\nThe idea is pretty self explanatory, essentially keep a text file of packages&versions, every change creates a new git commit. If something breaks, you can revert to a previously set up and apt handles the removing/installing/versioning of packages to match that previous environment.\nIf this does not exist, I would appreciate any advice / links to advice on proper OS management.\nThank you!\n\nA: There's some tools that can do the job using snapshots (not like version control systems):\nSystemback:\n\nSimple system backup and restore application with extra features\nSystemback makes it easy to create backups of system and users\n  configuration files. In case of problems you can easily restore the\n  previous state of the system. There are extra features like system\n  copying, system installation and Live system creation.\nInstallation:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nemh/systemback\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install systemback\n\n\nBackInTime:\n\nBack In Time acts as a “user mode” backup system. This means that you\n  can backup/restore only folders you have write access to (actually you\n  can backup read-only folders, but you can’t restore them).\nIf you want to run it as root you need to use “su” (command line),\n  “gksu” (Gnome) or “kdesudo” (KDE).\n\nInstallation:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bit-team/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install backintime\n\nTimeShift:\n\nTimeShift for Linux is a application that provides functionality\n  similar to the System Restore feature in Windows and the Time Machine\n  tool in Mac OS. TimeShift protects your system by taking incremental\n  snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots can\n  be restored later to bring your system to the exact state it was in at\n  the time when the snapshot was taken.\nTimeShift is designed to protect only system files and settings. User\n  files such as documents, pictures and music are excluded. This ensures\n  that your files remains unchanged when you restore your system to an\n  earlier date. If you need a tool to backup your documents and files\n  please take a look at the excellent BackInTime application which\n  is more configurable and provides options for saving user files.\nInstallation:\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install timeshift\n\n\n\nA: You could use a hook for apt to run a script after each invocation of apt-get/dpkg.\nA script that will list all installed package and commit the new list in a git repo\nFor example, in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99-dpkg-snapshot\nDPkg::Post-Invoke {\"/usr/bin/dpkg -l > /root/apt.git/dpkg-list.txt; git commit -a -m `date +%Y%m%d%H%H%S` -C /root/apt.git\"; };\n\nand create a git repo in /root/apt.git\nBut even with a list of package and their version, it could be not enough to get back a system in shape. You need at least to keep /etc with, for example etckeeper.\nIt would be better to use snapshot instead like @muru said. The problem is that only btrfs and LVM provide filesystem snapshot.\nYou could do it with device-mapper too but this is not trivial. https://serverfault.com/a/481513/297044\n", "Q: Unable to start ubuntu touch emulator.

You need to reopen your Bios menu, and make sure that that is turned off.  Also, make sure to check your boot order so that windows boot manager comes after any ubuntu entries.  if you can't access your boot menu on startup, you can reach it using windows 8, by accessing the settings menu for  refresh/restore, and go from there.  \n", "Q: How to get vertical tabs for terminal I am a great fan of vertical tabs which I use for Firefox.

I need to understand how the bootloader needs to be configured and how it will behave on both cases. \nP.S: Anyone figured out how to have Ubuntu 14.04 properly shutdown/reboot? I've been fighting it for some time and nothing seem to work!\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu which ever way you prefer. Most Linux distributions including Ubuntu will use a boot loader. So when you install it there will be a menu that gives you choices to choose which OS to run. You can configure the grub file for a specific timeout period and which OS to boot from by default. Either way there will be a boot loader. \nHowever if you install Ubuntu on your secondary HDD and you choose to boot from that and there is no other OS installed it will automatically boot into Ubuntu. It's only when you have multiple OS's that you will have the choice to choose operating systems.\nAdditionally, to answer your comment on Ubuntu messing up your Windows boot loader most newer computers come with UEFI boot mode, but Linux will install Grub or Grub2. If you remove the partitions of Ubuntu from one hard drive you will need to use a Windows install CD or USB to repair the MBR for Windows. You can do this by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert repair or installation media\n\n*Choose \"Repair\"\n\n*Then choose Troubleshoot>Advanced>Command Prompt\n\n*Enter bootrec.exe /fix mbr\nThis will repair your Windows boot loader.\n", "Q: Conditional file and directory installation in `.deb` Packages Is it possible to create a binary .deb package with conditional files and directories installation (e.g. installation of an init script in /etc/init.d/ after being confirmed by the user)?\n\nA: In order to interactively ask questions during package installation you should use debconf. To dynamically create and manage configuration files (and files in /etc/init.d/ are considered configuration files) ucf can be used.\nA tutorial, on how to use debconf, may be found here:\nhttp://www.fifi.org/doc/debconf-doc/tutorial.html\nMinimal example\ndebconf template\nPut this in the file debian/templates.

They allow stuff to be started in the\n background without you having to start them manually!!!\n\nPackage configuration script\nThis is where you ask the user (interactively) about the things you need to know. This script is special since, when installing more than one package, all of these files of all packages are run before dpkg begins the actual installation process. This means that, if more than one package wants to ask the user something, all questions are asked at the beginning of installation for all packages, instead of later on for each package individually.\nJust put the following stuff into a file named debian/config and mark it as executable (remember to replace demo-pkg with the correct package name):\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Make sure this script fails if any unexpected errors happen\nset -e\n\n# Load debconf library\n. /usr/share/debconf/confmodule\n\n# Should an init job be installed?\ndb_input high demo-pkg/install-init.d || true\ndb_go\n\n# You can also act upon the user's answers using `db_get`\n#db_get demo-pkg/install-init.d\n#[ \"${RET}\" = \"false\"] && echo \"I don't think that was a wise decision...\"\n\nMaintainer scripts (postinst, prerm and postrm)\nHere we do the actual magic and dynamically add and remove the configuration file/init script.

Needless to say, 3 months later I am out of room. I'd prefer just to extend my Ubuntu partition, but I'm already out of room on my HDD. However, I have a little less than 30GB of free space on my Windows C drive, so I was thinking I'd shrink the C drive first and then use the newly freed up space to extend the Ubuntu partition.\nI tried to shrink the Windows partition in the Disk Management tool, but it wouldn't allow me to shrink it any more than 500MB.

The C drive and the Ubuntu root partition are directly adjacent to each other. Since I was having trouble with the Windows Disk Management, I was going to do everything in GParted Live. Any advice or comments would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Disk Management has some restrictions. You can only shrink a partition or volume up to half of its free space, and you can only extend a partition having contiguous unallocated space to the right of it. Disk management cannot extend a basic partition using an unallocated space to its left. You can use a third party disk manager software, such as aomei partition assistant, to resize partition.\n", "Q: Weird Lines when Dual Booting with Windows 8.1 So I recently decided to give Ubuntu a whirl, so I tried to dual boot it alongside windows 8.1.

The SD card worked with my previous laptop without problems and is formatted with ext4.\nI tried\nsudo modprobe -r r852; sudo modprobe -r sdhci_pci; sudo modprobe r852; sudo modprobe sdhci_pci which helped others but did nothing for me.\nThe SD card works with an SD card to USB adapter. When using this adapter the SD card is /dev/sdb and the single partition on it is /dev/sdb1. When I put it into the SD card slot it is /dev/mmcblk0 and its partition is /dev/mmcblk0p1.\nWhen I enter the SD card into the slot, nautilus says:\n\nError mounting /dev/mmcblk0p1 at\n  /media/christoph/e07d3be4-bd85-4eb2-9205-d6638ab37704: Command-line\n  `mount -t \"ext4\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid\" \"/dev/mmcblk0p1\"\n  \"/media/christoph/e07d3be4-bd85-4eb2-9205-d6638ab37704\"' exited with\n  non-zero exit status 32: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad\n  superblock on /dev/mmcblk0p1,\n         missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n   In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n   dmesg | tail or so.\n\n\nMounting it manually results in pretty much the same error message:\n\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/mmcblk0p1,\n         missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n   In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n   dmesg | tail or so.\n\n\nNow the weird part is that dd doesn't seem to work in either case. I copied the first 100 MiB of each /dev/sdb, /dev/sdb1, /dev/mmcblk0 and /dev/mmcblk0p1 and earlier this day even got matching sha256-sums.\nThey now don't match any more but are very similar in the way that except for a little bit in the beginning almost exclusively consist of zero bytes even though the SD card is almost entirely full (and filled with compressed and encrypted data, so there shouldn't me many zero bytes).\nSo I replaced every instance of 4 consecutive zero bytes in $mmcblk0 (the copies I made via dd are named exactly the same as the devices but I but a dollar sign before the name so they can be differentiated) with plain nothingness in a hex editor and ended up with files just being 129.4 kB for r$sdb (the 'r' is for 'reduced' / 'replaced') and 312.7 kB for r$mmcblk0 instead of being 104.9 MB each.\nr$sdb has a mount point stated in the beginning (and I have no idea why). It really is the mount point the SD card was mounted on. Then comes randomly seeming data with a lot of repetitions, followed by a whole lot of FF bytes, followed by actual names of files saved on the SD card, followed by a little more randomly seeming data but not much.\nAbout the fist 1600 Byte in r$mmcblk0 are exactly the same as in r$sdb (this includes the mount point even though the SD card couldn't be mounted while in the slot). Then comes randomly seeming data with a lot of repetitions but with big blocks made from printable characters including file paths, followed by FF bytes, followed by exactly the same as the ending of r$sdb (actual names of files saved on the SD card, followed by a little more randomly seeming data but not much).\nCan you help me to resolve the problem and maybe tell me why dd outputs this weird data?\n\nI figured out how to make it work with FAT myself. I ran apt-get install nfs-common, rebooted and now FAT is working. Unfortunately, FAT is a shitty file system which doesn't support loads of stuff and I need file many GB in size which aren't supported by FAT. So I cannot use the SD card with FAT at all.\nIf I format the partition with ext4, the same error as previously occurs. For FAT everything seems fine.\nIs there a command to make it work for ext4 as well?\n\n$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 931.5 GiB, 1000204886016 bytes, 1953525168 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisklabel type: gpt\nDisk identifier: 2D8D2D1D-B17D-4F86-ACD1-743E6B376EFE\n\nDevice          Start        End    Sectors   Size Type\n/dev/sda1        2048    1230847    1228800   600M Windows recovery environment\n/dev/sda2     1230848    1845247     614400   300M EFI System\n/dev/sda3     1845248    2107391     262144   128M Microsoft reserved\n/dev/sda4  1716043776 1920843775  204800000  97.7G Microsoft basic data\n/dev/sda5  1920843776 1953523711   32679936  15.6G Windows recovery environment\n/dev/sda6     2107392   36923391   34816000  16.6G Linux swap\n/dev/sda7    36923392 1716043775 1679120384 800.7G Linux filesystem\n\nPartition table entries are not in disk order.\nDisk /dev/mmcblk0: 59.1 GiB, 63416827904 bytes, 123860992 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0xd69abc36\n\nDevice         Boot Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type\n/dev/mmcblk0p1       2048 123860991 123858944 59.1G 83 Linux\n\nDisk /dev/mapper/cryptswap1: 16.6 GiB, 17825267712 bytes, 34814976 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\n\n \n$ lspci\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor DRAM Controller (rev 06)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor PCI Express x16 Controller (rev 06)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 06)\n00:03.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor HD Audio Controller (rev 06)\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB xHCI (rev 05)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 (rev 04)\n00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB EHCI #2 (rev 05)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset High Definition Audio Controller (rev 05)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #3 (rev d5)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #4 (rev d5)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB EHCI #1 (rev 05)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation HM86 Express LPC Controller (rev 05)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family 6-port SATA Controller 1 [AHCI mode] (rev 05)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller (rev 05)\n01:00.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM107M [GeForce GTX 860M] (rev a2)\n07:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Wireless 7265 (rev 48)\n08:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

There is a very high probability of data loss. FAT is working probably because it has less error checking features, but that doesn't mean no errors! Use FAT with extreme caution. Take backups if you will be storing important data. Or rather, don't store important data, or simply use the USB Card Reader. That being said,\nTry repairing your SD card which is a standard procedure:\nsudo e2fsck -f -C 0 /dev/mmcblk0p1\n\ne2fsck is the linux utility to repair ext based filesystems. Anyways, I don't expect it to work. \nSo, as another answer suggests, the card reader might not support such a large drive.  But the fact that FAT works indicates that it is possible, with the added possibility of getting screwed up. \nThese are things you can try, but I don't know if they will work: Partition it into two, or even four drives if it will suit you, and then go forward with ext4. Or how about creating a smaller partition and leaving the rest as free space? You could give it a try.\nFinally, since FAT works, (remember, probably because it does little error checking) exFAT could meet your requirements of storing file sizes greater than 4 GB. See how to do it here.\n\nA: I believe the problem is caused by the fact that this particular SD cardreader is unable to read SD cards that have a 64 GB capacity while the other one in your previous laptop apparently can read such cards. Not all card readers have the same specifications. When you buy a card reader it is stated in the documentation what the biggest capacity is that the reader can handle. When it sits already in a laptop you'll have to figure it out what it can handle. Currently the limit is usually 32 GB. Unfortunately you can't change this property.\n\nA: Considering the new information you've added to the question I've a different approach for you.\nIn GParted format the partition on the card as ext4. Then create a mountpoint. Let's assume this is sd. So you do:mkdir -p /media/sd.Then to mount it you do:mount -t ext4 -O noatime,nodiratime /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/sd.The second command above is supposed to be on one line. Probably you have to prepend these commands with sudo. You can also use the flags in the second command in /etc/fstab.\n", "Q: Where is the output of pdftoppm? Hi I followed the instructions for using pdftoppm in the terminal so as to convert a pdf to an image. \nI tried: \npdftoppm -png file.pdf prefix\n\nI also tried it with the resolution parameters rx etc.... and also as it was the only pdf in the directory I read further down in the thread that you don't even have to put the name. So tried all of this and just kept getting poppler returning all the options and parameter choices as if I typed pdftoppm --help which of course i hadn't. What is going on? \nAll I want to do is convert a bloody image so i can insert it into a cell in an excel spreadsheet. \n\nA: pdftoppm creates output files in the directory where You run it. So if You simply open a terminal, You always start at Your home directory. This:\nuser@pc:~$ pdftoppm -png file.pdf prefix\n\nshould create png file(s) in home directory (~ is the same as /home/user) with name(s) starting with prefix.\nI've just checked it on my machine (Xubuntu 15.04) - it works like a charm.\n", "Q: Is it safe (secure) to change the owner of the html/ folder in Apache? I know how to use chmod and stuff so that is not the question.\nI have a little server (Ubuntu LTS ) running with Apache on it with the standard folder in /var/www/html/.\nBy default root is the owner of the html/ folder.\nQuestion: Is it safe (secure) to change the owner of the html/ folder?\n\nA: It is perfectly safe to change ownership of files in /var/www, and indeed anything in that folder is yours to edit and change how you wish.\nFor example, if user tsmith needs to be able to write to files in /var/www/myweb then it's perfectly fine to set the owner of these files to tsmith.  Or if you prefer, keep the owner as root and require tsmith to sudo in order to write to them - if you trust him/her with sudo.\nIf you have multiple users that need to be able to edit the files, and you don't want to give them sudo, you could alternatively use group membership, eg create a group and add users to that group, then set group ownership and group write to the relevant files to enable members of that group to modify those files.  When doing this you will probably want to use the SetGID bit (chmod g+s dir) on the containing directory to ensure new files inherit the same group ownership, and umask 002 in each user's ~/.profile to ensure they get group write permission, otherwise any new files will only be editable by their creator and not other members of the group.\nYou should however be aware of the following bad practices:\n\n*\n\n*Do not set ownership of any files to the www-data user, or the www-data group if you are giving group write permissions.  The whole point of the www-data user is that it is an unprivileged user, not able to write to any files.  Server daemons accessible from the outside network (such as the web server) typically run as an unprivileged user so that in the event that they are hacked due to a vulnerability, the possible things the attacker can do is minimal.\nException: some web apps require write access to certain files and folders in order to implement things like attachment storage, etc.  In these cases you should set ownership to www-data ONLY for those files, keeping the number of files writable by www-data at a minimum.\n\n\n*For the same reason, don't set any files to be world-writable.\n\n\n*If creating groups, don't re-purpose existing user groups like admin, sudo or especially www-data, which already have purposes in Ubuntu because this may reduce system security if those groups were not intended to be able to write to files.  Instead, create your own groups and add members to those.\n\nA: It's not very secure to use any directories or files with root permissions (either ownership or single permissions).\nFor static HTML files it would not be a big security problem but as soon as there are running scripts (PHP, JavaScript, any forms and so on) you can get serious problems.\n\nA: If you only need to serve content (html, images, etc), there is no need to set a special ownership to the directories/files in /var/www, as long as the apache2 user (www-data) has permission to access the content.\nIn case you need to do some more, you may need to modify the ownerships.\nFor instance, if you need to upload files from a CMS (like WordPress, Joomla, etc), you'll need to change the ownership of the upload directory to www-data (or at least grant write permissions to that user)\nI personally have /var/www owned by root user with mod 1777 (same as /tmp) and the websites (ie: /var/www/site1) directories owned by www-data.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Just installed and 1st time user needs link to novice site?

How can I start Steam using a cron job?\nI've tried just putting steam in cron, but it does not work. I've tried some odd stuff that I don't understand like DISPLAY=:0.0 steam %U but that does not work either.\nI've tried these lines in cron: \n00 02 * * * steam\n00 02 * * * DISPLAY=:0.0 steam %U\n00 02 * * * /usr/bin/steam %U\n\nAlso, is there a way to complete a Steam client update from a cron job? Usually a client update will require user input by asking for permission to restart before it will download and install a client update.\nAdditionally, if anyone knows how to STOP Steam from cron (as in cause a regular exit under Steam's terms like if you'd pressed \"exit\"; not a hard kill of the application) I would would also like to know that.\nThe reason is that I'm stuck with a lousy ISP with a data cap (Hughes.net = crap) except between 2AM-7AM and I'd like to be able to start Steam and get all game/client updates during that time. I know that under Steam/Settings/Downloads you can set it to only download game updates during a certain time but that would only work if I left my computer and Steam running all night; I have my computer's BIOS wake-on-timer set up to boot up my computer a little before 2AM, so I can't leave Steam running. Thank you!\n\nA: 00 02 * * * DISPLAY=:0.0 steam\n\nor (see edit below*)\n00 02 * * * DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/games/steam\n\n(Thank you to muru for giving me the clue to figure this out!) This line in cron will start Steam every night at 02:00 (2:00AM).\nThe breakdown is this: the first part is standard cron \"minutes, hours, days (of the month), months, days (of the week)\", so the 00 means at zero minutes past the hour; the 02 means at 2 on the 12 hour clock (2:00AM); and having * in the locations for days, months, and days of the week means to do it on every day of every week of every month.\nThe DISPLAY=:0.0 I think has something to do with activating the graphical user interface at coordinates on the desktop, but I'm not sure. It's needed to make the line work; that's all I know for sure.\nAnd steam is Steam.\nIf I figure out how to stop Steam from cron I will put it up, but I haven't figured that out yet. Thanks to everyone for their help!\n*EDIT: Okay, so weeks later for some reason the original line I gave above: 00 02 * * * DISPLAY=:0.0 steam stopped working suddenly. I tried this slight alteration to the line and it works: 00 02 * * * DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/games/steam I have no idea why but try them both and see which works for you.\nFor Linux noobs like me, you can find the full path like in the new line for any command by typing which [command] in the terminal; for example which steam shows /usr/games/steam which is what I used to make the line work again.\n\nA: This might work:\ncd ~/steamcmd\n./steamcmd.sh\n\nhttps://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Linux.2FOS_X\nThese are the commands to install updates:\nInstall or update the app using the app_update command (supplying a Steam Application ID). To also validate the app, add validate to the command. To download a beta branch, use the -beta  option – for example, the HLDS beta branch is named beta and the SrcDS beta branch is named prerelease. Some beta branches are protected by a password; to be able to download from them, also add the -betapassword  option. \n", "Q: ECS not an option in AWS CLI?

You've said that you never reboot the box, because it's always computing some stuff.  My guess is its using /tmp to store computational data in a temporary location.  That directory usually is cleared out on reboot and in other cases.\nThe problem is, when /tmp gets full you can run into a lot of problems.  From your df -h output above, your /tmp was mounted as 'overflow'.  Likely what happened is your root filesystem got filled up, and /tmp wasn't defined as its own partition, and the system remounted /tmp as an 'overflow' disk, which is limited in size.\nSo, you've got two things you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Figure out whether your / partition is out of space.  df -h on its own will give you a rundown of everything.\n\n*Remove old data from your disk (either delete it or move it elsewhere off the system), and the /tmp directory.  Something's eating your space and that's a bad thing.\n\n*Consider a reboot from time to time, during a regular maintenance period or something.

I do not need it but maybe I am overseeing something.\n\nIf there is no feature or software in the newer version that you need, then the only reason in favour of upgrading will be that it will be supported for longer, so instead of losing support in April 2017, you'll lose support in April 2019.\n\nI am mostly using Apache, Bind9, Cron, MySQL, PHP, Rsync and SSH. Is it going to be all compatible and working together? Anybody had any conflicts or issues, something working very different?\n\nAll of these will continue to be supported in 14.04, and between those two versions any required configuration changes should be minimal.  Obviously you still need to properly research and test that, though, so there is a definite cost to upgrading that needs to be balanced with the benefit.\n\nWhen I run ubuntu-support-status, I get some unsupported packages, is it worth looking into this stuff from security point of view? \n\nIt's worth looking into these.  It sounds like you have a mix of packages from previous versions of Ubuntu, including non-LTS versions, that weren't upgraded properly or were removed in the newer versions.\nIn particular, you have 47+9 packages from other non-LTS versions of Ubuntu, which should be upgraded or removed.  You have 5 packages that are not included in Ubuntu (or no longer included in Ubuntu) some of which may need to be removed, unless you get them from a third party eg PPA and you trust that PPA to support them, and you have 246 that are unsupported - I presume this means they're from the universe respository in which case that's better than nothing.\n", "Q: Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG network card wifi not working I recently installed Xubuntu on my laptop, dual booted with Windows. \nEverything works perfectly on the Windows side, but Xubuntu for some reason either doesn't recognise or can't access my network card, so I can't connect to the wifi.

You can get the download here. \n\nA: The best way is to use software center, and search for stream and install it from the software center, and it probably work best this way, or else you need to install wine1.7, and open the downloaded exe file whit wine loader, and to install wine you have to enter this in the terminal:\n       sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wine-ubuntu/ppa\n       sudo apt-get update\n       sudo apt-get install wine1.7 winetricks\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Which Ubuntu Flavor is best for old PC WITH Nvidia GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 and AMD 64Bit and 4 GB Ram? I had horrible experience installing Ubuntu on my machine with Nvidia. Just want to hear some expert advice. Currently using Linux Mint but want to switch back to any Ubuntu flavor, just not sure which is best.\n\nA: It is probably best if you use Lubuntu or Xubuntu, which both use lightweight desktop environments. Make sure you use the proprietary nvidia drivers, as there are known issues with running nouveau drivers on this device. Other good options include Peppermint, Puppy, Crunchbang (now deceased but there are forks). You may even wish to run Unity2D.\n(I recommended these other distributions mainly because you asked for an Ubuntu based distribution, which probably means you're most familiar with the apt package management)\n", "Q: Safely move (and extend) Ubuntu Partition So I know this question has probably been asked before but I am having trouble finding an answer specific to my problem and I really dont want to ruin my machine and have to reinstall both operating systems. But basically:\n1) Windows 7 was installed\n2) I installed Ubuntu with only 30GB of space\n3) I am running out of space on Ubuntu so I want to extend the partition\n4) I shrank the Windows partition using GParted on a LiveUSB drive\nNow I have an unallocated partition that I would like to use to extend Ubuntu. The unallocated partition comes before the Ubuntu partition.\nIs it safe to do so?\nNote: I know I must use GParted through LiveUSB and all my data is already backed up.\nGParted screenshot: screenshot of partitions\n\nA: In principle (without actually seeing your partition layout) you should be able to simply extend the Ubuntu partition using the unallocated space.  This process ought to be perfectly safe.  However, in real life, nothing is guaranteed.  Why not use disk imaging software (e.g. Macrium Reflect Free Edition for Windows, Clonezilla for Linux) to make a backup of the entire hard disk just in case things go south with GParted?

I've seen the cat command come up in some online stuff and I was curious as to what cat did and what it's for in the context of someone who is just doing some simple command line stuff.\n\nA: cat's primary purpose is to concatenate files. cat file1 file2 ... will show the contents of file, file2 and the others one after the other, as if the contents were in a single file. See the manpage:\nNAME\n       cat - concatenate and print files\n\nIt is meant for usage where either:\n\n\n*\n\n*a target command cannot read from files and you need to pass multiple files to it. An example is the tr utility. Ordinarily, with one file, you'd do:\ntr < file\n\nBut with multiple files, redirection can't be used, so you have to do:\ncat file1 file2 ... | tr\n\n\n*a target command can read from multiple files, but its behaviour may change when it's given multiple files. An example is wc, which prints the counts for each file, along with the filenames, where you might have wanted just the total, without a filename.\n\n\nRemember that most commands you encounter (grep, sed, awk, sort, ...) can read files perfectly fine.\nIf you want to view the contents of a file, use a pager - less and more are both eminently capable of presenting files for viewing, and are far more convenient to use.\n\nA: cat is one of the most frequently used commands on Unix-like operating systems. It has three related functions with regard to text files: \n\n\n*\n\n*displaying them\n\n*combining copies of them\n\n*creating new ones.\n\n*Copy files\n\n\ncat's general syntax is:\ncat [options] [filenames] [-] [filenames]\n\nReading Files\nThe most common use of cat is to read the contents of files, and cat is often the most convenient program for this purpose. All that is necessary to open a text file for viewing on the display monitor is to type the word cat followed by a space and the name of the file and then press the ENTER key. For example, the following will display the contents of a file named file1:\ncat file1\n\nConcatenation\nThe second role of cat is concatenation. (This is the source of cat's curious name.)\nThere is no effect on the original files.\nFor example, the following command will concatenate copies of the contents of the three files file1, file2 and file3:\ncat file1 file2 file3\n\nThe contents of each file will be displayed on the monitor screen. This output could just as easily be redirected using the output redirection operator to another file, such as file4, using the following:\ncat file1 file2 file3 > file4\n\nFile Creation\nThanks to @muru comment : cat is capable of create new files depending on the shell redirection feature and not itself \nFor small files this is often easier than using vi, gedit or other text editors. It is accomplished by typing cat followed by the output redirection operator and the name of the file to be created, then pressing ENTER and finally simultaneously pressing the Ctrl & d keys. \nFor example, a new file named file1 can be created by typing\ncat > file1\n\nthen press ENTER and simultaneously press the Ctrl & d keys. \nPS1: If a file named file1 already exists, it will be overwritten \nPS2: you can append to exited file using append operator >> example cat >> file1\nCopy Files\nThe cat command can also be used (depending on shell redirection feature) to create a new file and transfer to it the data from an existing file. Example: make a copy of file oldfile.txt:\ncat oldfile.txt > newfile.txt\n\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux and Unix cat command\n\n*The cat Command\n\n*cat (Unix)\n\n*HowTo: Use cat Command In Linux / UNIX\n\nA: It can be used to show the contents of a file. Eg: cat \"my file.txt\". You can also do man cat to show you the details about what cat can be used for.\n\nA: Here is another way for file creation using shell redirection (or piping) and cat:\ncat << EOF > foo.sh\n#!/bin/sh\necho 'Hello World!'\nEOF\n\ncat << EOF will output the following lines until the string EOF is encountered again. Then > (>>) will redirect the output to the file foo.sh. Alternatively, if you need to create a file as root, you can pipe the output to the command tee (tee -a), executed by the command sudo:\ncat << EOF | sudo tee foo.sh && sudo chmod +x foo.sh\n#!/bin/sh\nHELLO='Hello World!'\necho \"\\$HELLO\"\nEOF\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The above will make the file executable (chmod +x) if it is successfully created (&&).\n\n*The special meaning of some characters (as $) should be escaped (with \\) within the output of cat.\n\n", "Q: Dual boot Windows and Ubuntu on separate drives I have two HDDs, one with my Windows 8.1 install on it. I installed Ubuntu 15.04 on the second HDD by creating a UEFI bootable USB and installing it that way.

It appears to be that you have been booted to a Grub shell. Take a look at this for how you should boot to your Linux HDD. Once you do that, run (in a terminal):\nsudo update-grub\n\nand it should automatically add entries to your Grub configuration.\n\nA: Thanks, I couldn't figure out the EasyBCD thing, I think it was creating a grub boot for the SSD where Windows is installed. Instead when BIOS is booting, I select the SSD where Linux is installed and it loads, likewise I do the same for Windows.\n", "Q: Permission denied problems after rsync with sudo on the remote I was trying to move files from one server to another.

Currently, I have the file \"sc_serv2_linux_x64_11_29_2013.tar.gz\" on a flash drive. How can I copy the file and extract it?\nI already tried other methods I read, but none worked.\n\nA: Method 1:\nThe file is on your USB stick. I suppose you plugged it into your computer. So you need first to know the name of your USB stick. For this, run this command on Terminal:\nls /media\n\nThis will give display the name of your USB stick, for example: usb1234\nTo copy your file, run this command on your Terminal:\ncp /media/usb1234/sc_serv2_linux_x64_11_29_2013.tar.gz .\n\nThis will copy sc_serv2_linux_x64_11_29_2013.tar.gz to where you are running the commands on Terminal (continue reading above).\ntar -xzvf sc_serv2_linux_x64_11_29_2013.tar.gz\n\nRunning man tar on Terminal will give you the explanation of the options xzvf above:\n -x, --extract, --get\n       extract files from an archive\n\n -z, --gzip, --gunzip --ungzip\n\n -v, --verbose\n       verbosely list files processed\n\n -f, --file ARCHIVE\n       use archive file or device ARCHIVE\n\nThis will extract the file above in the same folder where you opened the Terminal. By default, when you open Terminal you are on /home/your_user_session\nIf you do not know where you are then just type on Terminal:\npwd\n\nMethod 2:\nThe simplest way: if you are running Ubuntu 12.04 and over, then as soon as you plug your USB stick into the computer, it will be opened and you will find yourself within it, in which case you can view the data of your USB stick and copy what you want using the mouse :)\nIf it is not opened by default then be sure you plugged it correctly and click on the file browser where you will see the name of your USB stick displayed as above:\n\nClick on the USB stick name and copy your file wherever you want. Then right click using the mouse on your file and click on Extract Here.\nMethod 3:\nIf sudo fdisk -l shows the presence of a USB stick but you can not access it then you have to mount it:\nsudo mkdir /media/external\n\nThat creates the mount point in /media called /external in our case (you can choose an other name)\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/external -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137\n\nThat will mount the drie.\nAfter you finish, you have to unmount the device by running:\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\n\nOr:\nsudo umount /media/external\n\nSource.\nBegueradj\n", "Q: Setting permission for Xampp installation directory. see details I know bit about setting permission but i'm little in a mess with it.\nI'm new to ubuntu so i get little confused and took much time to solve a little problem.\nI have installed xampp with installer which put it in /opt/lampp i have set Virtual hosts as well i successfully configured my first vhost after spending couple of hours but when i try to create a new one one i lost my access now whenever i open my host url opencart.lh it says access forbidden. i tried to play with chmod but i get lost with it.\nNote: i didn't create folder manualy in opt/lampp/htdocs i just copy my existing project to it like opt/lampp/htdocs/opencart.\nIt might be a duplicate question but i hope you can answer it as well.\nThanks in advance.\nEdit -1\nMy Question is i have added new folder to htdocs i have settled it's permission chmod 755 for directories and chmod 644 for files this worked for my on my first project but with 2nd i used the same method but it didn't work for that one.\n\nA: In general to change file and/or directories permissions you need to use chmod command (you already knew that).\nThere is two way to use chmod more information in official ubuntu docs page. In the nutshell either use letters e.g\n\n*\n\n*r read (readable)\n\n*w write (writeable)\n\n*x execute (executable)\n\nOR use numbers\n\n*\n\n*4 == r\n\n\n*2 == w\n\n\n*1 == x\nHere are some example that you should be able to adapt them for your own use.\nchmow 644 *\n\n*\n\n*6 make all files in the current directory readable and writeable for the file owner\n\n*4 make all files in the current directory only readable for people in the group\n\n*4 make all files in the current directory only readable for everyone else\n\nI don't know equivalent command using letters but to get the same reuslt you would do something like this\nchmod a+rw *\n\n*\n\n*all can read and write\n\nchmow o-w *\n\n*\n\n*others can't write\n\nchmod g-w *\n\n*\n\n*group can't write\n\nThere are many different ways to change files and directories permission. You should really look at the docs\n\nA: After little more effort I'm able to work with my htdocs folder.\nFirst i set my owner of my htdocs from root to My User\nafter that i set permission of my htdocs 755 (drwx-rx--rx-) for my all directories in htdocs\nUser this code to do that\nfind htdocs -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\n\nand for files i set 644 (rw-r-r)\nUser this code to do that\nfind htdocs -type f -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\n\nand it works fine.\nYapeeee.\nHope someone will find this use full.\n", "Q: How to create bootable ISO from an installed OS? Say I have two systems A and B.\nI have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on system A and need same set of settings in system B, for which I am thinking to make a bootable iso from System A(creating as a backup). so that I can make Live USB from the generated iso and boot the System B which will be now the replica of System A.\nCould you please tell is there any method or tool in doing this process?\n\nA: You have many tools that are available for Ubuntu 12.04(some of them are not used anymore for newer versions. but still works for ubuntu 12.04).\n\n\n*\n\n*relinux\n\n*remastersys\n\n*Ubuntu Builder\n\n*System Imager\n\n\nAnd much more.\nI personally advise you to use Relinux.\nDownload this version from launchpad and not the last version to use the following tutorial on it\nHere is a great tutorial how to use.\n\nA: You can use Clonezilla. It's a great tool if you want all systems have a same copy of OS and softwares. As your requirement look like you want all alike systems. You can clone any hard disk partition or full hard disk using this utility.\nYou will have a great choice of USB install, network install, samba server, etc. to install your cloned image to other system.\nVisit this tutorial to learn about \"Use Clonezilla Live to clone a computer’s internal hard drive to a USB external drive\".\nGet Steps here!\n\nA: Many of the tools that were viable when this question was first posted have become abandonware.\nClonezilla is an enduring option. Some (including me) find it cumbersome and sometimes confusing. Systemback is more user-friendly. There are multiple tutorials for both. Distroshare is another option. There are also paid options that I have not tried (e.g., TeraByte, possibly PowerISO).\nI will mention some other possibilities, in case the ISO route is not really your best solution.\nFirst, I suggest thinking of backup and copying as two separate processes. Backup should occur regularly -- maybe monthly, if you don't make many changes to your system drive. Your best backup method may or may not be the same as your copying method.\nFor copying, there are at least three basic approaches:\n\n*\n\n*Connect drive B directly to drive A. This is feasible, even on laptops, if you can get drive B out of its machine: you can connect it to system A using an external docking station (assisted by male-female SATA extension cord if necessary).\n\n\n*Start with an image of drive A. You may or may not find that the imaging process gives you the kind of monthly backup you want. Use the image to restore the system to drive B.\n\n\n*Make an ISO of drive A. The ISO will function as you say: install it onto a USB drive, boot system B with that, and use that to install onto drive B.\nThere is further information on those possibilities, in case the ISO route is not, after all, the one you want.\n", "Q: Unable to Wipe my SSD from linux I have an SSD which I've installed Ubuntu on, it was completely clean.

I'm unable to do this, I've tried using a USB boot loader and re installed although now the boot drive is broken and my hard drive has been divided. I cant re-unite it. I don't think it's a partition since GParted shows the division as a new drive. I really want to fix my Ubuntu installationbut I have been unable to do so.\nIt could be a virtual drive or something, but at this point I just want to clear my SSD\nI've tried formatting it in windows, although the drive appears to have lost space and the partition does not appear. Even when I formatted the drive and booted it up in a different computer a broken linux installation still appeared which means that there is still something in the drive.\n\nA: Have you tried using the dd command?\nIt's a low level disk command, which means it can be very dangerous if you type incorrectly, so proceed with caution!\nYou will need an Ubuntu live CD or USB to boot from, or an Ubuntu installation on another disk, and you need to know the device name for your SSD, eg /dev/sda. It's really important that you get the device name correct.\nThis command will overwrite the drive with zeros, which should leave it nice and clean to re-format:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/(your-ssd)\n\nReplacing (your-ssd) with the correct device name.\nI can't stress enough how important it is to get the correct device name, and type the command correctly, except by saying that dd is the abbreviation of Disk Destroyer!\n", "Q: Annoyances with appindicator icon positions (Ubuntu 14.04.2) I have a niggling problems with appindicator icons.

I've tried the following:\nI deleted /etc/xdg/autostart/vboxclient.desktop file.\nBut I am still seeing the message when logging in.\nAny suggestions on how to fix this?\n\nA: This usually happens when you update the Guest's Linux Kernel.\nAfter each update, you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Host (installing server)\nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\n\n*For Guest (installing additions)\nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxadd setup\n\nThe reason why inserting the VBox addition disk again works is because that's one of the things the installation procedure does as well.\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 15.04 on Virtualbox 5.02.

Ubuntu provides .iso.zsync for it's ISOs which is efficient to save some (around 35%) bandwidth, if you already have the ISO locally. \n", "Q: Shell script to remove unity launcher(if present in Ubuntu 14.04 ) and/or the xfce panel (in the case of xubuntu) Just want shell script to remove unity launcher(if present in Ubuntu 14.04 ) and/or the xfce panel (in the case of xubuntu).\nIf anybody has idea about the same then please let me know.\nThanks\n\nA: Update:\nTo completely remove the launcher for the time your script execution, I'd disable the unity compiz plugin.\nWe have such a script in Checkbox, that I'm pasting here for convenience:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n# This file is part of Checkbox.\n#\n# Copyright 2014-2015 Canonical Ltd.\n# Written by:\n#   Daniel Manrique <roadmr@ubuntu.com>\n#   Sylvain Pineau <sylvain.pineau@canonical.com>\n#\n# Checkbox is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n# it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3,\n# as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n#\n# Checkbox is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n# but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n# MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

So I simply deleted it's partition. But now I am trying to move half of the unallocated to windows and half of it to Ubuntu. I am having a great deal of issues doing this. Any help appreciated.Thanks!\nHere is a picture of all my partitions. \n\n\nA: First of all you need to boot from Ubuntu LiveCD to be able to move Ubuntu partitions. You see that now they are locked with \"key\" sign.\nAfter that you will be able to move all partitions. But do not mount them in Nautilus, otherwise they will be locked again. But you can unmount partitions using right-click in Gparted.\nBut you may have trouble with \"Microsoft reserved partition\". It can be unmovable. In this case the easiest way is to create 2 new partitions using unallocated space.\nYou can format one of new partitions to ext4 and mount it in Ubuntu and format the other one to NTFS and use it in Windows.\nAnother way is to backup /dev/sda5 with Clonezilla and restore it in the unallocated space. It is just enough for that.\nThere are some other ways using LVM, but it is not that easy.\n", "Q: How to enable TLS 1.2 in apache?

You should remember to not start a system if some partition is mounted on another, hibernated system (Ext4 partitions are quite save, because Windows can't mount them without some 3rd party software).\n\n*It depends on what you want to store in you home directory, but if you have most data on your NTFS partition, then it should be OK. Steam installs all the games to your home directory by default, so you should create a Steam Library on another partition and use it instead of default one.\n\n\nA: Your partitioning is reasonable.\n\n\n*\n\n*Order of partitions does not matter.\n\n*Yes, you can.\n\n*It depends on what you will install to Ubuntu /home partition. E.g. steam games are installed there. But generally it must be enough in most cases.\n", "Q: Recursive directory renaming I need to recursively append the same suffix to all sub-directory names in a directory. What is a simple and safe way to do this?\n\nA: Using find and rename:\nfind . -depth -type d -not -name '.' -exec rename -n 's/(.*)/$1_foo/' {} +\n\nThis will add suffix _foo to all directories recursively, -n will show the names of the directories that will be changed.\nIf you are satisfied with the names you can remove the -n option to let the action take place:\nfind . -depth -type d -not -name '.' -exec rename 's/(.*)/$1_foo/' {} +\n\n", "Q: How can I use Left Ctrl+Alt combination for special characters? I've been using Ubuntu for few days and I really like it, but I have a problem with my keyboard:\nI can't use the left Ctrl+left Alt combination to type special characters like in Windows.\nHow can I activate this combination?\n\nA: Open Text entry ,mark input source and press on keyboard icon. You will see all characters available for particular input source.(As you can see not many options for English (US) layout but instead you can use English (US, alternative international) layout)\n\n\n\nIf you want to use additional keys open keyboard>shortcuts>typing and set a Compose key and Alternative characters key. The latter is used to write additional keys of present keyboard layout (My guess is that's what you've been looking for).\n\nIn this case I have set RCtrl as Alternative characters key. Note that you can set only one key for this and not a combo like LCtrl+Alt, which is by all means simpler. You can change the layout however suites you to gain missing keys, but I don't think you can rebind the way you want and not create further mess with your system.\n\nThe Compose key is used to write special characters(lets say it is AltGr):\nAltGr+Shift then release followed by a+e will produce æ.\nTo write Unicode Characters press:\nCtrl+Shift+u, you will get underline u then release and type the Unicode without the leading zeros, e. g.:\nCtrl+Shift+u followed by aeEnter will produce ®, or\nCtrl+Shift+u followed by1f44fEnter will produce \nYou can use Character map to drag and drop any of the symbols you need.\nUseful, but little old link.\n\nA: On Ubuntu, you have to use AltGr.\nThis key is also the one you can/should use in Windows, but as Windows predates the AltGr key, they (still) treat AltGr and the combination Ctrl+Alt the same way (most of the time) whereas Ctrl+Alt is used for navigation under Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Is it possible to log all items installed, modified, removed? (Ubuntu Server 14.04.2) Is it possible to log automatically when things are installed, removed or modified at my Ubuntu server? It would be nice if I can view the log to see what I (as root) did modify, install, remove. \nI'll hope this is possible and I'll hope someone can explain me how to setup such thing.\nKind regards,\nKevin\n\nA: It's already done (at least for things installed via Softwarecenter etc.). Please check /var/log/dpkg.log or as mention in the comments via /var/log/apt/history.log\n\nA: In GUI you can do it from Ubuntu Software Center, go to the tab History and there you can find every thing.\nBut now for you as you using ubuntu server 14.04 then the above is not valid so you should search from files, basically those history is located under:\n/var/log/dpkg.log* \n\nAnd\n/var/log/apt/history.log*\n\nAnd Why I put * because there is more than one file as stated above, For example:\n$ ls /var/log/dpkg.log\ndpkg.log        dpkg.log.12.gz  dpkg.log.5.gz   dpkg.log.9.gz\ndpkg.log.1      dpkg.log.2.gz   dpkg.log.6.gz   \ndpkg.log.10.gz  dpkg.log.3.gz   dpkg.log.7.gz   \ndpkg.log.11.gz  dpkg.log.4.gz   dpkg.log.8.gz \n\nSo indeed log will be compressed and moved when it reaches some size.\nNow to know for example let's know recently installed packages that were installed via any method\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep \"\\ install\\ \"\n\nExample output:\n2015-07-01 13:56:40 install htop <none> 1.0.1-1\n\nlet's know recently installed packages that were removed\n cat /var/log/dpkg.log.1 | grep \"\\ remove\\ \"\n\nExample output:\n2015-06-02 08:34:18 remove dconf-tools 0.12.0-0ubuntu1.1 <none>\n2015-06-04 13:15:06 remove bitmeteros 0.7.6 <none>\n2015-06-04 13:16:25 remove bitmeteros 0.7.6 <none>\n2015-06-08 11:34:33 remove jack 3.1.1+cvs20050801-26build1 <none>\n2015-06-09 08:35:05 remove nautilus-dropbox 0.7.1-2 <none>\n2015-06-26 11:53:29 remove dconf 0.5.1-2 <none>\n\n", "Q: Find all files that contain a given clause in their names This is a general question but my case is that I have installed (I beleive it got installed!) the gcc arm compiler but I can not find it anywhere in my system.

It's stuck at the part where it says \"install (as superuser)\" at the top of the page. What am I supposed to do?\n\nI am stuck at this. ^^\n\nA: There could be a few issues occurring. I would recommend doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a disc check to ensure there are no errors on the Ubuntu CD/USB you created\n\n*When choosing \"something else\" during the install, delete the partitions you had created for Ubuntu and start over. I do the following:\n\n\n\n/dev/sdaX linux-swap 4GiB (or half the amount of ram you have)\n\n/dev/sdaX / 20 GiB - (this is your root)\n\n/dev/sdaX /home (rest of disk space /home partition is also optional)\n\n\n\nI format all my partitions to Btrfs format as well, this runs the smoothest for me. \n\n\n*Ensure that you have your power supply as well as a good Ethernet connection plugged in. \n\n\nAs installation can take some time and if you are running a live CD/USB you want to be sure your Internet connection is consistent for the install.\nThen follow the installation as normal.

I've created a file /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/45fixusbwakeup copied the script into it, and made it executable with sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/45fixusbwakeup as I always did before. I'm not an expert, and this hook has always been working from me, so I don't have a clue what could be wrong now.\nWhat I basically need is that these 3 commands execute every time before computer is going to sleep, or at every startup:\nsudo -s\necho USB0 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\necho USB2 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nI would also like to note that when I suspend via terminal command sudo pm-suspend the script works flawlessly, it's only not working via traditional logout--->suspend button in Xubuntu, so I guess this is something Xubuntu-related. I guess it actually suspends via xfce4-session-logout --suspend and that's creating the problem. \n\nA: \nxfce4-session will use systemd-sleep on a systemd system (not pm-suspend). systemd-sleep hooks should be put in /lib/systemd/system-sleep using the following template:\n\n#!/bin/sh\ncase $1/$2 in\n  pre/*)\n    echo \"Going to $2...\"\n    ;;\n  post/*)\n    echo \"Waking up from $2...\"\n    ;;\nesac\n\n\n...and made executable. One other caveat with systemd is that the\n  scripts in this directory are run concurrently, not sequentially based\n  on name (as is the case with pm-utils).\n\n\nA: To run the commands on startup\nPlace the commands (remove sudo -s) into a .sh file and make it executable with chmod +x <filename>.\nCreate a new bash script containing gksudo -s root <path_to_other_bash_script> and make it executable.\nCreate a file with a .desktop suffix in the ~/.config/autostart directory - create the folder if you don't have it.\nPlace the following into the .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=name_of_second_bash_script\nExec=path/to/second/script\nType=Application\n\nThe commands present in the bash script will be run on startup.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Software Center: The upload does not appear to be a valid click package I'm trying to upload an application to the Ubuntu Software Center and have encountered this error when uploading the .deb file:\nThe upload does not appear to be a valid click package.\nWhat is the reason for this error?\n\nA: Sounds like you were accidentally in the phone section, clicks are currently for Ubuntu Touch.

I initially installed RHEL first and then tried Ubuntu.  When installing Ubuntu, I wouldn't get the statement that says, \" we found another Operating System, would you like to have both?\" I tried it the other way around (Ubuntu first and then RHEL), but somehow I would end up wiping Ubuntu and get stuck only with RHEL.  \nMy second issue is when I have installed both OS, why does GRUB2 or GRUB 0.97 find both OS? (and yes, I did run update-grub, but no luck).\nCan someone kindly assist me?\n\nA: So, below is what I did:\nI used Live Ubuntu and fired up gparted and created two partitions:\nsda1    ext4    Ubuntu (with boot flag)\nsda2    fat32   Red Hat\n\nNext, I used the RHEL Boot CD, and it first asked,\n\nWhat type of devices will your installation involve?\n\nI choose the first one, “Basic Storage Device”. It then asked\n\nWhich type of installation would you like\n\nI think I clicked on “Create Custom Layout”.  I do remember not choosing, “Use Free Space” nor “Shrink Current System”. Regardless, the option I choose automatically checked off a checkbox at the button: see screenshot below:\n\nHerein under Hard Drives I choose sda2 and clicked next.  I got this error: see screenshot below:\n\nI then clicked on sda2 and clicked ‘edit’.  I basically set the mount point to: / and file type ext4: see screenshot below:\n\nIt then asked me if I was sure to write to disk and I hit “yes”.\nNow, the next part is crucial in making the whole thing work.\n\n*\n\n*I was then asked about the bootloader.  Since RHEL’s GRUB was 0.97 and was not recognizing Ubuntu after I installed it previously, I choose to not install a bootloader.\n\n*After clicking next and finishing up, it asked to reboot and it did not boot RHEL.  It took me to a grub rescue screen.  (its fine).\n\n*I then rebooted the PC and used the 14.04 Live Ubuntu USB.  Ubuntu then asked that it found another Operating System and if I would like to have both.  I choose “yes” and continued the process.\n\nFinally, when I did a reboot GRUB2 appeared and had both OS.\n", "Q: Brother DCP-7070 does not scan I have a problem with scanning on my Brother DCP-7070DWR, Ubuntu 14.04 via GUI software like xsane or simplescan\nMy printer connected via wifi.

Do not do it on just /, /usr etc, as it probably will break the system.\n\n\n\nFor example:\n$ touch file\n$ sudo cp file filert\n$ ls -l | grep file\n-rw-rw-r--.  1 wilf wilf         0 Jul  2 09:42 file\n-rw-r--r--.  1 root root         0 Jul  2 09:43 filert\n\nThe above commands. create a file called file, copy it as root to filert, then displays the file properties. When files are copied as root, the resulting file should be owned by root - this is what happened to your files. With the above example, filert can be made usable by a normal user using:\n$ sudo chown $USER:$USER filert \n$ ls -l | grep file\n-rw-rw-r--.  1 wilf wilf         0 Jul  2 09:42 file\n-rw-r--r--.  1 wilf wilf         0 Jul  2 09:43 filert\n\n", "Q: synaptic tries to uninstall so many packages when trying to install openssh-server I've been tyring to get openssh-server through sudo apt-get install openssh-server, but when I ran it I got the following:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n openssh-server : Depends: openssh-client (= 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu1)\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nI tried using synaptic to install things from where, but when trying to install it, I was presented with a dialog box saying that many packages are going \"to be removed\", the likes of audacity, clang, clementine, g++, glmark2.\nWhat's going on?\n\nA: Remove these packages, as you might not have it installed from official repo. Use command below to remove it but make sure no more packages are uninstalled, like half of the system!\n\nsudo apt-get remove openssh-server openssh-client\n\nThen, update you repository info with\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAnd finally install needed packages with\n\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client\n\nIf you get some unexpected results, post it here.\nIF it doesn't help (3 commands above), then you might have something broken on your system due to installing/adding different software repositories and system is not unable to resolve dependencies. In that case, you should post here file content of  /etc/apt/sources.list  and all files from folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\n", "Q: Maintaining multiple Linux distros - boot and grub partitions Here is my GParted view of /dev/sda\n\nThe unallocated blocks were once another Ubuntu distribution - I will resize my other partitions to consume them soon. /dev/sda2 holds my Debian installation's root directory - which I installed first on a clean disk. The Debian installation created the /dev/sda1 partition as a boot partition and a swap partition (which I deleted at some point). dev/sda5 holds my Ubuntu root directory. I installed the two Ubuntu distributions by creating custom partitions, but to be honest I didn't really know what I was doing, I just messed with it till it worked.\nSide questions\nWhat is /dev/sda7 for, and what does it do that /dev/sda1 doesn't do? Could I combine the two together?\nAlso, everything is working and the two distros are booting fine. I just want to know where to go from here - should I change the partition layout to make it neater and more future proof in case I needed to add more Linux distros?\nMain question\nIf I added another Linux distro, how would I proceed? What partitions should I create and how should I organise them? (I don't want to share a /home partition). Do I need a separate bios_grub partition for each distro?\n\nA: The bios_grub partition is needed for enabling Legacy BIOS booting in GPT/UEFI setups. If you're booting with UEFI, which I, for the sake of simplicity, assume you do, you won't need it at all.\nYou can use the existent SWAP partition for all installed Linux systems, as they can't be booted simultaneously.\nIf you don't want a shared /home, the only thing you need to do is to create a root partition for the new system in the unallocated space on installation time (i.e. set its mount point to /) and format it as EXT4. As you are asking on AskUbuntu, I assume you'll be installing Ubuntu next. Ubuntu will automatically use existing swap partitions. If you install an OS that doesn't use it automatically, you can afterwards tell it to use the swap partition by adding the following to your /etc/fstab in the new system:\nUUID=<uuid of /dev/sda6>    none    swap    sw  0   0\n\nYou can get the UUID with sudo blkid. To apply the new fstab, run sudo swapon /dev/sda6.\nThe boot loader for the new installation will have to go into /dev/sda1, the EFI partition. The newly installed GRUB should recognize the other installations. If not, run sudo update-grub after first boot.\n", "Q: Ctrl+click on link in a browser doesn't open page in a new tab I reinstalled Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and for the most part it went off without a hitch; however, my browser isn't acting right.  I often use the CTRL+click shortcut to open links in a new tab.  At first I thought the issue was with Chrome, but then I decided to try the same thing in FireFox and it doesn't work there either.\nI run Ubuntu on a MacBook Air with a touchpad and no mouse.  I fooled around with the touchpad settings without any luck.\n\nA: I eventually discovered that CTRL cause a drag operation evidenced by the change in the mouse pointer.  By holding CTRL down I am able to drag a Window around not only by the title bar but by any part of the window including the hyperlink in the browser window.  I had to turn this off in Unity under Windows > Moving and Resizing Windows > Special Key to move and resize Windows > Alt.  (from Ctrl.)\nThen under Mouse and Touchpad on the Touchpad tab I had to set Advanced > Two-finger click emulation > Middle Button, which apparently Chrome accepts as a mechanism for opening a link in a new tab.  So while I don't have CTRL+click on a link working I have a two-finger touchpad press on a link working, which is acceptable.\nLater, I restarted Chrome and CTRL+click appeared to be working again.  Thus I suspect the first issue was the main thing.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of Grub-Rescue? After a week of digging, it doesn't seem any of the current solutions are working for me. I removed the Ubuntu partitions but grub-rescue prevents me from booting into Windows. It doesn't let me execute anything other than ls.\n \nI don't have a Windows Recovery disk. I'm running Windows 8 but can't access it. I DO have a ubuntu live usb though.\n  \nI already tried bootrec.exe /fixmbr without any success, as well as lilo and boot-repair. None of the options work.\nHere's my paste from boot-repair: http://www.paste.ubuntu.com/11805577/\n\nA: As the_Seppi stated, using the the bootrec.exe /fixboot and /fixmbr should work. Sometimes the boot flag can be removed from the partition to boot from. Try creating a live USB of GParted and look for the following:\n\nYou will notice that the boot flag is on my 2GiB boot partition. If you do have to add the boot flag back, reboot back into recovery mode for Windows and then run the bootrec commands again and see if that works.\n", "Q: Is Skype in partener repository the same as from website? I have noticed that in the partner repository that there is a package called skype, is this the same package that you get from the Skype website? And is it managed by Microsoft too? Or is there any difference in the managing of the two packages, or their versions or anything?\nI noticed this because when I did apt-cache policy skype I got:\nskype:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 4.3.0.37-0ubuntu0.12.04.1\n  Version table:\n     4.3.0.37-0ubuntu0.12.04.1 0\n        500 http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ vivid/partner amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: You can get the version number of the repo package using \napt-cache policy skype\n\nFor my 14.04.2 setup, this returns:\nskype:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 4.3.0.37-0ubuntu0.12.04.1\n  Version table:\n     4.3.0.37-0ubuntu0.12.04.1 0\n        500 http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ trusty/partner amd64 Packages\n\nSo the version in the Trusty repos is 4.3.0.37-0. The package downloaded from Skype's website is named\nskype-ubuntu-precise_4.3.0.37-1_i386.deb\n\nSo it has version 4.3.0.37-1.\nThe number after the hyphen usually indicates a change in the packaging, not in the software itself.\nThe fact that the package is called ubuntu-precise means that it was packaged for 12.04 Precise Pangolin. So one can see that the software hasn't undergone any change in the past two years (or that the devs were too lazy to update the version number in the package control file...)\nSo eventually both packages ship with the same version of Skype. If you, however, compare apt-cache show skype with the DEBIAN/control file of the package from the website, you'll see that the packages are maintained by different people. Still, the software is the same.\n", "Q: How can I be sure \"apt-get install\" successfully finished its work? I have Ubuntu 14.04 and I intend to download Skyrim.

This MSSQL server is on our internal network. I've installed these packages: unixodbc, unixodbc-dev, unixodbc-bin, libodbc1, libtool, autotools-dev and several other dependencies. Also tdsodbc, freetds-bin, freetds-common, freetds-dev, libct4. \nBut I can't seem to find where the .so file is to use it in my DSN in /etc/odbc.ini. Which file do I use? Doing this: echo \"select 1\"|isql -v mydsn gives me this error: \n[01000][unixODBC][Driver Manager]Can't open lib '/usr/lib/libtdsodbc.so' : file not found\n[ISQL]ERROR: Could not SQLConnect\n\nThe 'mydsn' is trying to point to /usr/lib/libtdsodbc.so but it's not there. Which .so file do I set up in the /etc/odbc.ini file?\nThank you. \n\nA: According to this link: http://www.unixodbc.org/doc/FreeTDS.html, it might be:\n\n/usr/local/freetds/lib/libtdsodbc.so\n\nAnother possibility is: \n\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsodbc.so\n\nThis is for 64-bits architecture.\nOnce you found the right place, update the /etc/odbcinst.ini to reflect the changes.\n\nA: Below link might help if this case is still observed.\nTDSODBC\nSharing here because I faced this too, recently.\n", "Q: Missing argument to -exec This is the command I'm entering. \nfind /home/things/backups -mtime +0 -exec echo \"{}\" >> /home/things/logs/backup.log \\; -exec echo \"Hourly rotate successful: $(date). {} was deleted.\" >> /home/things/logs/backup.log; \\;\n\nand the output is below.\nfind: missing argument to `-exec'\n\n;: command not found\n\nIt creates the file backup.log fine, but the file is empty.\n\nA: Using:\nfind /home/things/backups -mtime +0 -exec \\\n    sh -c 'echo \"$0\" >> /home/things/logs/backup.log; echo \"Hourly rotate successful: $(date). $0 was deleted.\" >> /home/things/logs/backup.log;' {} \\;\n\nWe start a new shell sh with a command -c and the parameter {} (the find result). In the command we use this parameter via $0.\n\nA: Let's reposition the redirections a bit and add some line breaks to see what you're actually running:\n >> /home/things/logs/backup.log \\\n   >> /home/things/logs/backup.log \\\n   find /home/things/backups -mtime +0 -exec echo \"{}\" \\; \\\n     -exec echo \"Hourly rotate successful: $(date). {} was deleted.\";\n   \\;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You're redirecting find's output, not that of the commands run by -exec. This would affect the commands run using -exec since they are child processes and inherit open file descriptors, so the effect would be what you needed even if the way you went about it was weird. \n\n*Then the ; at the end of the second exec wasn't escaped. The find command got terminated there without a ; for exec, causing the error. find quit immediately because of this, so no output was produced.\n\n*The \\; at the end is then processed by the shell. Usually, it would be a statement delimiter, but since it is escaped, it tries to run it as a command. This fails, naturally.\nConsider simplifying the command:\nfind /home/things/backups -mtime +0 -exec \\\n  bash -c 'printf \"%s\\nHourly rotate successful: $(date). %s was deleted.\\n\" \"$0\" \"$0\"' {} \\; \\\n  >> /home/things/logs/backup.log\n\n", "Q: Grep showing file name and string found I need an egrep command that list all the file names that contains the words + which string it has found. Let's imagine this scenario:\nWords that I need to find: apple, watermelon and banana.\nWhat I need: I want to list all files that contains any of them (don't need to have all of them in the same file), and print which word it found in the file. Example of a search result I want:\n./file1.txt:apple\n./file1.txt:banana\n./file2.txt:watermelon\n./file5.txt:apple\n\nI remember seeing a grep command which shows FILENAME:STRING in the search results, but I can't remember how it was done. I tried:\negrep -lr 'apple|banana|watermelon' .\n\nBut the search results showed:\n./file1.txt\n./file2.txt\n\nOk, it helps but ... in file1, which one of the words it found? That's the problem I'm facing .\n\nA: The way to do it with awk:\nawk -v var1=apple -v var2=banana -v var3=watermelon '{ if($0~var1) {print FILENAME\":\"var1} ; if($0~var2) {print FILENAME\":\"var2} ; if($0~var3) {print FILENAME\":\"var3}  }' *\n\nBasically, declare 3 variables, and 3 if statements to print filename and corresponding variable that has been found\nEDIT\nShorter version:\nawk '/watermelon/{ print FILENAME\":watermelon\" }; /banana/{print FILENAME\":banana\"}; /apple/ {print FILENAME\":apple\"}' *\nBasic idea find /regular expression/ and execute code in curly braces after it if found (which is to print FILENAME and which string we found ).\n\nA: Here is the command you're looking for:\ngrep -R \"apple\\|banana\\|watermelon\" <search_path>\n\nThe -R will read all files under each directory in search_path, recursively. The file name will be displayed for each match.\n\nA: The following will give you the output you want (using bash):\nfor x in apple banana watermelon ; do grep $x * ; done\n\nThe output will give you all lines containing the search string. \nThe following will give you only the search string as output:\nfor x in apple banana watermelon ; do grep -l $x * |xargs -I{} echo {}:$x; done\n\n\nA: You used -l, which is the opposite of what you want. From man grep:\n-l, --files-with-matches\n      Suppress normal output; instead print the  name  of  each  input\n      file  from  which  output would normally have been printed.  The\n      scanning will stop on the first  match.   (-l  is  specified  by\n      POSIX.)\n\nWhat you want is -H:\n-H, --with-filename\n      Print the file name for each match.  This is  the  default  when\n      there is more than one file to search.\n\nBut that's the default anyway. Just do:\ngrep -Er 'apple|banana|watermelon' .\n\n(The -E tells grep to act like egrep.)\n", "Q: Problem with .dmg extraction I have disk image file on my external HDD.

Then, I wonder about the need/use of some sort of partition where both Ubuntu and Windows can access the data.\nAnd do I want to put an OS on the SSD? I'm using Windows for gaming and Ubuntu for emulation and big number crunching.\nFinally, is an update to Windows 10 going to absolutely wreck my Ubuntu installation, or should I be fine on that front?\nThanks for any advice or direction.\n\nA: The partitioning scheme can be anyway you like it.Just be sure you do not delete your Windows partitions when creating or modifying ones for Ubuntu. Paying attention will help with this.\nPlease take a look at: Partitioning Schemes - Ubuntu Help for some additional info regarding how to partition your machine. The following set up is how I have three of my machines running.\nI have seven partitions while dual booting Windows 8.1, they are as follows:\n/dev/sda1 - 2GiB (boot partition /EFI that windows created automatically during it's installation)\n/dev/sda2 - 350GiB - (Windows partitions with install)\n/dev/sda3 - 100GiB \"Extended Partition\" (since you can only have four primary partitions on a system)\n/dev/sda5 - 4GiB \"Linux-Swap\" (usually you only need to have half the amount of your ram for swap. Since I have 8GiB of Ram I used 4GiB for Swap)\n/dev/sda6 - 20GiB \"/\" (root partition)\n/dev/sda7 - 70GiB \"/home\" (I have a separate partition for my home folder)\nFor my root \"/\" and \"/home\" partitions I have formatted them to the Btrfs (Betree), file system as this runs best for me. Ext4 will work just fine as well.\nThen you can install Ubuntu along side of Windows.\nFor your question regarding if Windows 10 will corrupt Ubuntu - It should not. I had upgraded to Windows 10 preview while I have Ubuntu installed and nothing was harmed. I always recommend reading over the official help documentation at Ubuntu.com for installation and partitioning.\nTo answer your question on whether or not you can create a partition that both Windows and Ubuntu can use, I am not sure. You could always create one then try to mount it on both Windows as well as Ubuntu, but I am unsure how this would work due to the way Windows and Ubuntu handles files systems. I guess it would be similar to having a network drive that you could see on both OS's. Just not 100% sure.\n", "Q: Boot much slower after partition resize I'm on Xubuntu 15.04.

Because I moved the swap partition, it had changed UUID. The mismatch in fstab caused the delay, it seems. Found the answer here:\nVery slow boot with Ubuntu 15.04\n\nA: One possible cause may be incorrect partition alignment.\n\nProper partition alignment is essential for optimal performance and\n  longevity. This is due to the block nature of every I/O operation on\n  the hardware level as well as file system level. The key to alignment\n  is partitioning to (at least) the given block size, which depends on\n  the used hardware. If the partitions are not aligned to begin at\n  multiples of the block size, aligning the file system is a pointless\n  exercise because everything is skewed by the start offset of the\n  partition.\nSolid state drives are based on flash memory, and thus differ\n  significantly from hard drives. While reading remains possible in a\n  random access fashion, erasure (hence rewriting and random writing) is\n  possible only by whole blocks. Additionally, the erase block size\n  (EBS) are significantly greater than regular block size, for example\n  128KiB vs. 4KiB, so it is necessary to align to multiples of EBS.\n\n(from ArchLinux wiki)\nTo verify a partition is aligned, query it using /usr/bin/blockdev as shown below, if a '0' is returned, the partition is aligned:\nsudo blockdev --getalignoff /dev/<partition>\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Find/generate the UUID for swap. or simply blkid | awk -F\\\" '/swap/ {print $2}'\n\n*Update the /etc/fstab file.

I'm hoping this question can help other people in the future who may be facing the same dilemma with whether to chance imaging a large drive, or just go right after individual file types (jpeg,mp3 etc)\nI searched for the same question here, and could not find a specific answer. \nmy case-\nI had a 750gb WD Scorpio Black drive with OSX 10.6.8 fail on my Macbook a few weeks ago.\nIt was imaged using DD by a local computer place. They basically told me to continue imaging the rest would take a month so they just saved about half the drive and called it a day. It cost me $250 to get maybe 300gb of 650. The clone drive was a 2tb WD My Passport Ultra and was formatted to Mac extj. There were two folders. \"Found Files\" files that still had filenames,tags etc, though many won't open and \"Reconstructed Files\" files that have no filename I have to sort through. \nAll I want to recover is audio files and pics, nothing else. My friend has a desktop setup now to use Linux recovery tools, I'm just wondering what is the safest route to go now?\nI can either try and re-image the drive in chunks with the better GNU DD Rescue and use log files, or use something like Photorec. \nIf I know exactly what folders the files I want are in does that help?\nAnyway I'm a noobie at Linux based data recovery, but I'm eager to learn. I'm 44 and was actually a hacker in high school on Apple IIE's lol \nBut it's been a long time since I had to use command lines etc. Last hard drive utility I used with success was Spinrite years ago.\nI appreciate any suggestions or help.\nthx \n\nA: You have to try some Data Recovery tools which may help you to restore some of your old data.\nFrom R-tools Technology:\n\nR-Linux is a free data recovery and undelete utility for Ext2FS/3FS\n  (Linux) file systems.
