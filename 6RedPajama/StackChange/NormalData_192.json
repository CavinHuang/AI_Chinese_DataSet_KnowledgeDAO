I tried to upgrade, but it hung somehow and I had to reboot, (press the reset button, the little one beside the big start button.) It tried to boot into 14.10, but hung after accepting the password. Using an Ubuntu 14.04 LiveCD, I recovered my /home directory to an external HD, then re-installed 14.04 and copied my saved /home directory back to the new /home directory like this:\nsudo cp -dRv dev/sdb1/home/* home/ \n\nsudo was necessary as cp otherwise could not read all of the files\nSince then, neither Firefox nor Thunderbird will run.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I click on Firefox in the launcher, it returns, \"Your Firefox profile cannot be loaded.

Thunderbird never opens a window.\nAll other software seems to work properly.\nI've checked and the old .mozilla and .thunderbird directories were copied over along with my other files. I've tried changing permissions in both directories and the files in them; no joy. I've tried renaming the .mozilla directory; Firefox creates a new one, but behaves the same way. I recovered my old /etc, /var and /usr directories along with my old /home directory; copying the old /etc directory to the new one did nothing, the old /var directory crashed the system. I tried upgrading to 14.10; Unity seems a little slower, Firefox and Thunderbird behave the same way. I've tried un-installing and re-installing Firefox and Thunderbird using Ubuntu Software Centre; no joy.\nFor now I'm using Chromuim and reading emails online. This is will do for now, but is sub-optimal. I would be grateful for any help.\nUPDATE -- I made a guest account. Firefox and Thunderbird work correctly in that.\n\nA: I mistakenly copied my user directories to the top level of my /home partition instead of in my user directory (/home/username/).

What does it mean? What are the consequences?\nWho knows?\nDaniel\n\nA: You are using a UEFI boot, in BIOS, but have told the BIOS to not boot in a secure mode.  There were problems earlier with UEFI and Ubuntu, but I am using secure boot with Ubuntu 14.10 and not having issues at this time.\nSecure boot prevents drivers from loading unless they have an acceptable digital signature.  You can try eneabling secure boot in your BIOS with 14.04, and if it does not work, just turn the secure boot back off.\n\nA: From Ubuntu 14.10 release notes page:\n\nAn update to shim in 14.10 introduces a bug where, when booting on a UEFI system with SecureBoot disabled, the boot is delayed for two seconds and a message \"Booting in insecure mode\" is displayed on the screen. This message does not indicate a security problem with Ubuntu and does not interfere with the operation of the system except for introducing this boot delay. As a workaround to avoid this boot delay, users can enable SecureBoot if enabled on their hardware, or if they do not intend to use SecureBoot at all they can uninstall the shim-signed package and then rerun the grub-install command. 1384973\n\n", "Q: Gedit launches with Save & Save As disabled unless launched as root Whether I launch gedit from a terminal or from the GUI, the Save and Save As menu items are ghosted as soon as gedit opens.

I am new using ubuntu, so take that in mind :)\nI have a project at the school in wich I have to create an Intranet using a switch and router. I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and apache2 server.\nI have already create a webpage in HTML and I can connect different computers in order to enter to the page.\nBut the only way that I can enter is by typing the ip address. I am trying to enter to the page but by using a domain name like \"www.example.com\" not just numbers.\nI followed the steps to create the intranet here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts\nBy the way, I already have the domain (I got it here www.noip.com)\nThank you >:)\n\nA: If I am not mistaken, www.noip.com is a dynamic DNS provider. What this boils down to is that it allows hosts with dynamic (DHCP) IP addresses to run a small client program that updates the noip database with the current IP address of the host where the client is running. Note that this will also typically require that the IP address of your server is routable over the internet or that portmapping/static NAT is established to such an address.\nHowever, if you are not running the client software, there is nothing that will update the database, thus the hostname will not be resolvable. Or if your IP address is not visible on the internet, your server won't be reachable.\nWhat you can do under these circumstances is:\n\n\n*\n\n*either configure a local DNS server and configure your clients to use it as a DNS source\n\n*or you can enter your server's FQDN in /etc/hosts of all of your clients which would allow them to resolve the name to IP address. Obviously, this will work only if you have a known set of clients.\n\n\nA: To solve your problem you have to setup domain name resolution. You might already have it working without knowing. Please check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you ping the server by it's hostname (e.g. ping example-host)? The hostname can be found easily in Ubuntu. It's the part of the prompt between the @ and the :. You should also try the same with suffixing .local → ping example-host.local.\n\n*Does you router provide a DNS service. Some router do and they will allow you to resolve the host in a special domain.\nIf both don't work you still have some options:\n\n\n*\n\n*setup your own DNS server and configure all the client to use it. \n\n*Manually configure the hostname in the hosts file of the clients; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)\n\n*Use a domain you have control and create a new A (or for IPv6 AAAA) record in it. The IP in the record can be local only if does not matter. People from the outside would be able to resolve the hostname to the IP, but they would not be able to access the server. \n\nA: I am assuming you are referring to your external IP address assigned by your ISP. \nIf you already have a domain at no ip you simply need to configure dynamic DNS in your router/firewall and forward the necessary ports (80 & 443) for your web server to the internal IP address of your web server. \nTypically to log into your firewall you look for the default gateway address that is assigned to your web server and log in by typing the address into a browser on a system that is connected to the network. \nEdit: the other way to get an IP address to appear as a domain address is to set up a virtual host in your web server that resolves to that domain name and edit the hosts file of all of your LAN computers to resolve that domain at your web servers internal IP address. I have more info on that if you want.\n", "Q: How to repair win7 boot?

That file is read one time at startup with the addresses sent to the network controller and not updated until the networking service has been restarted again.\nAdditionally, if your system has NetworkManager installed (all new versions of ubuntu do by default) then you will need to use the graphical network setting editor. The files that appear when you do a manual configuration are not those used by NetworkManager. You also need to restart networking using the same interface.

After upgrading to 14.04, I had Samba upgraded from 3 to 4. Since then, I can't get group write permission on my newly created directory or files.\nWhat was previously working in Samba3 was using these settings:\nsecurity mask = 000\nforce security mode = 660\ndirectory security mask = 000\nforce directory security mode = 770\nforce user = nobody\nforce group = Domain Users\n\nThese settings were removed in Samba 4 (see https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba_4.0_Features_added/changed#smb.conf_changes).\nBut now, my directories are created \"drwxr-x---  2 nobody Domain Users\" and my new files \"-rwxr-x---  1 nobody Domain Users\".\nSo what is the way in Samba 4 to allow my users to create and share with write permissions new directories and files ?\nHere is my full samba config:\n[global]\n    workgroup = WORKGROUP\n    server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)\n    interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8, eth0\n    map to guest = Bad User\n    obey pam restrictions = Yes\n    passdb backend = ldapsam:ldap://ldap\n    pam password change = Yes\n    passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u\n    passwd chat = *Enter\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *Retype\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *password\\supdated\\ssuccessfully* .\n    syslog = 0\n    log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m\n    max log size = 1000\n    load printers = No\n    domain master = Yes\n    dns proxy = No\n    ldap admin dn = cn=root,dc=example,dc=com\n    ldap group suffix = ou=Groups\n    ldap idmap suffix = ou=Idmap\n    ldap machine suffix = ou=Computers\n    ldap passwd sync = yes\n    ldap suffix = dc=example,dc=com\n    ldap ssl = no\n    ldap user suffix = ou=People\n    usershare allow guests = Yes\n    panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d\n    idmap config * : backend = tdb\n\n[CommonShare]\n    comment = Common share\n    path = /srv/samba/common\n    valid users = @myusers\n    read only = No\n    create mask = 0660\n    force create mode = 0770\n    directory mask = 0770\n    force directory mode = 0770\n    inherit permissions = Yes\n    inherit owner = Yes\n\n\nA: To fix the problem you may add the force user username to the list of valid users for the share.\nIn your case:\n[Myshare]\n...\nvalid users = @bureau\n...\n\nshould be:\n[Myshare]\n...\nvalid users = nobody @bureau\n...\n\n\nA: This same problem happened to me.  \nI had to update the access control lists of all directories with the default group permissions:\nsudo setfacl -R -m d:g:family:rwx /mnt/backup\n\n-R = recursive\n-m = modify\nd: = defaults\ng: = group name (\"family\" in my case) or gid number\nrwx = default permissions read write execute for all in group\n\n/mnt/backup is the directory (and subdirectories) to modify.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but this might help someone. I solved this by setting the setgid bit to 2 (instead of 0) so the directories / files are created with group write permissions, e.g.\nforce create mode = 2777\nforce directory mode = 2777\nFrom : https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-use-special-permissions-the-setuid-setgid-and-sticky-bits#h7-the-setgid-bit\n\nA: While researching this problem, I stumbled onto this Samba\nmailing list message:\nhttps://www.spinics.net/lists/samba/msg169260.html\nIn it, a developer implies that Samba completely ignores traditional Unix file permissions when a client asks for the file's permissions. So if you right-click on the file from Windows and look at its permissions, it will show up as having no group write permission. While in most cases this is fine (Windows leaves it up to Samba to enforce the permissions), it makes a file effectively non-group-writable if it's in Word format, since Word checks the permission and switches to a special read-only mode if it thinks (incorrectly in this case) the file isn't writable. OpenOffice does the same thing.\nTo work around the problem you must add an ACL to whatever file you want to be group writable using certain Windows programs:\napt-get install acl # Not installed by default on Debian\nsetfacl -m 'group:<group-name> :rw' <filename>\n\nIf you mistype the group name, setfacl will report it as if it was a syntax error. The space before :rw is required. After this command succeeds, the group write permission will show up for Windows programs that check it.\n\nA: The first four parameters have been removed, not the last two (see: https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages/smb.conf.5.html#FORCEUSER).\nSo, just put them back in the config file and that should solve the problem. If you want write permissions to users in a particular group, add the write list parameter. It provides ability to grant write permissions to specific users or groups.\nHere is an example of a config I use to allow creation/modification of files to all users belonging to a specific group (and only these users):\n[Myshare]\n    writeable = yes\n    path = /shares/office\n    force directory mode = 770\n    force create mode = 770\n    force group = bureau\n    valid users = @bureau\n    write list = @bureau\n.  \n\nA: Mask parameters don't change anything,\neven force parameters don't change behavior with group bits.\nFor me only this config worked:\n[global]\nstore dos attributes = yes  (for correct office hidden files)\n\nobey pam restrictions = no  (!!!!)\n\n[shares]\ncreate mask = 7770\ndirectory mask = 7770\nforce group = [one_group_for_all_shares] \n\n(nothing critical, there is parameter valid users, where I am grouping users for shares )\n", "Q: Server 12.04 LTS Desktop Environment install \"Package xubuntu-desktop is not available, but is referred to by another package.\" I am trying to build the HP SDN VAN controller on Server 12.04 Precise but need a GUI to download the controller.\nWhen i try to install a desktop i get the following (I have already done an apt-get install update)\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\nReading package lists...

Is this the desired behavior, or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: Even scripts need the executable bit set.\n\nA: You will probably have your script named similarly (starting) like an existing application or executable in $PATH (or, as Oli mentions, you forgot to make it executable).\nAnother thing is that it is bad practice to use language extensions in executables in $PATH, see this link\n\nA: I'm using zsh for shell and after putting a script in /usr/local/bin it would not tab-complete.

So can someone tell me how to fix this? I tried to search, reinstall openconnect but I still didn't solve the problem.\n\nA: I believe you've created a private VPN on your local IP. You can use this VPN when you are at Starbucks or Mc Donald's and you won't have to worry as much about MITM attacks because you will be able to connect to your own private encrypted VPN linked to your home network IP.\nIf you want to use a public VPN in some other country or IP, I suggest using openvpn. To install run the following commands ain a terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openvpn\n\nTo connect to a vpn, download an .ovpn file from a VPN provider such as vpnate.net. Locate an \"Open VPN Config File\" and download this file (.ovpn). You can use TCP or UDP. UDP is faster but TCP is available for compatibility. \nFirst download the .opvn file from this address:\nhttp://www.vpngate.net/en/do_openvpn.aspx?fqdn=vpn956716021.opengw.net&ip=113.151.69.81&tcp=1703&udp=1468&sid=1416531490220&hid=558684\nThen, run the following command to start the vpn:\nsudo openvpn --config /path/to/file.opvn\n\nYour IP should now be from Japan. \nThe basic command is\nsudo openvpn --config \n\nthen, enter the path to the file or drag and drop the .ovpn file into the terminal, press enter and enter your password.\nAnother example with the file downloaded to your downloads folder:\nsudo openvpn --config ~/Downloads/vpngate_vpn956716021.opengw.net_tcp_1703.ovpn\n\nSome VPN servers will require a password and a username, however, VPNs on this website do not.\nThe UDP version can be downloaded from here.\nA world wide selection of \"Open VPN Config Files\" for free VPN servers can be found here.\n", "Q: external microphone on double jack (mic/headphones) I would like to use my microphone on my laptop.\nBut my laptop only have a single jack, mic + headphones combined.\nWhen I plug my microphone, the system think it's an headphone.

Will the files be in all drives on the array when the sync is complete? \nWhat if a disk fails while sync is in progress?\n\nA: *\n\n*You can safely write to any degraded RAID array and not lose any data, that's a standard RAID feature\n\n*If a disk fails during sync, well it matters which disk that failed. If it was the resync target, who cares, it'll just resync from the master again. If it was the master then the RAID 1 has failed however that member still has the most up to date copy of the data. So if it's a transient error your data is probably fine, the system reboots and resync attempts to continue, if it's not then you've exceeded the protections provided by RAID 1 and have now lost data\n\n*No RAID is a substitute for regular backups aka duplicity or plain old rsync.\n\n\nA: If one of the disk fails then it will ruin your whole RAID setup, if the disk were to fail, then you will have to setup your whole RAID over again, so on that note, if at all possible, do not attempt to write file to the disk while in sync.\n", "Q: How can I upgrade Pitivi to 0.94? In Ubuntu 14.10, every time I open Pitivi it says \"Pitivi 0.94 is available\" but there doesn't seem to be a way to upgrade to it. I want to try out Pitivi again, because they seem to be making huge improvements, but I always like to have the latest.\n\nA: PiTiVi is correct in that a new version is available, but it fails to tell you that it's not available from the package management system. The latest version on Ubuntu is 0.93 (for 15.04). For a newer version, you'd have to install from source, or download an all-in-one precompiled bundle. I couldn't find any PPAs with the latest version.\n", "Q: Mysterious .directories in my home directory I discovered some mysterious directories in my home.\nEvery one has dot before name.\nThey can't be seen from file explorer or even terminal, for example I'm using Eclipse \"open file\" for seeing them. \nThey are called for example \".arduino\", \".mozilla\", \".local\"...\nMy question is: What are they? Are they bad? Why are they messing my home? Is it like apps data?\n\nA: Files with a dot at the beginning of the name are hidden by default. In Nautilus (Ubuntu's default file manager) you can make them visible with Ctrl+H. For the ls command, add the switch -a to it, which lists all files.\nThese files are either there from the beginning (like .local or .config) or are created by a program to store configuration etc.\nAs an example, PlayOnLinux stores its virtual drives in ~/.PlayOnLinux. Java will create the .java directory, and Firefox and Thunderbird use the .mozilla directory. There are also files, not only directories. E.g. .bash_history contains the command history of your terminal shell.\nSo don't worry about these files. As a \"normal\" user, who doesn't mess with his systems config, you'll most likelynever even need to take a look into these files and directories.\n\nA: Those are configuration directories (or application data) for programs and are normal. .arduino is likely for the Arduino IDE, and .mozilla is for Mozilla Firefox. .local/share is used by many different applications.\n\nA: think of it as your %USERPROFILE%\\AppData for Linux.\nBut unlike WinAPI, it actually works.\n", "Q: Grub: preferred video interface at boottime My HDTV is connected through HDMI. My desktop through DVI. At boottime grub displays the bootmenu ( where I can choose for Windows or Linux) only on the HDMI interface. Since my TV is off during most of the time this is undesirable. I would very much like the grub menu to appear on the DVI interface.\nI am using on board video. My motherboard is a MSI FM2-A75MA-E35.\nThanks in advance for any help!\nHans\n\nA: This is not an option you can select in GRUB, it's a BIOS option.\nIn your BIOS, you should be able to select a default video output for boot up.\n", "Q: What is the point of the bash Null-operator \":\", colon? What is the point of the \"null\" operator in a BASH script?  I understand that it is used as a placeholder following an if command when you have nothing to say, but need a command to allow the program to run properly.  But what is the overall use for it?  When would you use it?  When does it make sense to use it?\n\nA: You can use it to create a file without running a program::\n: > /path/to/file\n\nThis is infinitesimally faster than touch /path/to/file\n(since it doesn't require running the touch program)\nand may be marginally more portable than just plain\n> /path/to/file\n\nwhich seems to work on many systems. \nSimilarly, it can be used to check whether you have write access to a file:\nif { : >> /path/to/file;} 2> /dev/null\nthen\n    echo \"writeable\"\nelse\n    echo \"write permission denied\"\nfi\n\nalthough this, also, can generally be done without the :.  Caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*This doesn’t check whether the file already exists. \nIf it doesn’t, this will create the file if it has permission to do so.\n\n*If the file doesn’t exist, and your script doesn’t have permission to create it,\nthis will report “write permission denied”.\n\n\n(See the linked question\nfor reasons why this is more reliable than if [ -w /path/to/file ].)\n\nA: Way back, in Unix V6 and Thompson Shell, the : was actually used as part of the goto statement.  According to the manual, it originally appeared in version 3 of Unix:\n\nThe entire command file is searched for a line beginning with a : as the first non-blank character, followed by one or more blanks, and then the label. If such a line is found, goto repositions the command-file offset to the line after the label and exits. This causes the shell to transfer to the labelled line.\n\nNowadays, in bash, it's used as a no-op operator, returning success. Indeed, if you look at the source code, you'll see that both true and : use same function, int colon_builtin(), underneath.  There's no : non-builtin command, and /bin/true is actually a fairly large command for what it does.\n: could be used anywhere true is used, for example in command_that_can_fail || true, though that's likely to confuse non-experts. Read more about it here.\n\nA: You can use it on the positive test of an if command when you only want to do something on the negative side. For example:\nif [[ True == False ]]; then\n    :\nelse\n    echo \"true <> flase\"\nfi\n\nWithout the : bash would generate a syntax error.\nThis is an oversimplified example. Generally you would use such a technique in preliminary coding when you haven't written that code segment yet and just need something that doesn't generate an error.\n\nA: It's sometimes useful to allow parameter expansions side-effects to occur.\nFor example, setting a default value\nread -p \"Enter your name: \" name\n: ${name:=John Doe}  # if the user entered an empty string\necho \"$name\"\n\n\nA: You can also use it for endless loops:\nwhile : ; do \n   # ....\ndone\n\n\nA: I just used it in a script with SSH commands to keep the script from erroring out.\nIn this case, I want to see if a user can connect to a set of servers.  If the connection is OK, the remote host will echo OK.  If the connection fails, SSH will respond with the error.  However, I want my script to exit with 0 and not the value of the SSH command if it fails.  So essentially I trap the SSH error by ORing it || with the null command :.  Looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor i in $(cat servers.txt); do\n    echo -n \"$i \"; \n    ssh user@${i} 'echo OK' || :; \ndone\n\nThat way I get the output from SSH but not the error code:\n....\nswl06 ok\nswl07 ok\nswl08 Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password).\nswl09 ok\nswl10 Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password).\n....\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu on an old ia64 HP server I want to install 14.04 (Trusty) 64bit, on and old ia64 HP BL860c server.\nDoes someone know if this is supported by Ubuntu?\n\nA: 10.04 (Lucid) was the last Ubuntu release that supported ia64: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2010-August/000441.html\n", "Q: Is there still any modern non compositing desktop? I am still using Ubuntu 12.04, mostly because of the 'Gnome Classic without effects' desktop provided by gnome-fallback-session.\nI like to use a non compositing desktop, as compositing seems to introduce slight latencys and slightly raised battery use in everyday use. \nI tried the Gnome-Shell, Cinnamon and Unity on Ubuntu 14.04, but none of them can be run without compositing it seems. Xfce and LXDE do, but both are not so well featured or integrated as the heavier ones. \nSo is there any way of running a modern desktop without compositing?\n\nA: howtogeek has this to say about it:\n\nUse a Non-Composited Desktop\nIf you do want to play 3D games in windowed mode and get maximum performance, you’ll need a non-composited desktop.\nIf you’re using Ubuntu 12.04, you can select Unity 2D on the login screen. Ubuntu 12.10 users will have to use a different desktop environment, as Unity 2D is no longer available.\nUnity and GNOME Shell don’t allow you to disable compositing, although many other desktops do. You may want to try Xfce, KDE, or another desktop environment – just ensure you disable compositing in the desktop you choose. (Perform a Google search to learn how to disable compositing on your desktop of choice.) You’ll lose the fancy graphical effects, but windowed 3D rendering will speed up.\n\n\nIt mentions 12.10 but you can read this as \"12.10 and newer\".\nThe link has several desktops listed but I would start with XFCE if I was you. Mind though: compositing will be enabled on first install and you need to turn it off yourself. Regarding the 2 mentioned in the article, xfce and kde:\n\n*\n\n*webupd8 on XFCE and disabling composite.\n\n*KDE.org forums on KDE and disabling composite.\n\n\nA: So thanks to @Rinzwind's answer and comments on it, I figured out that Metacity is still around in vanilla Ubuntu 14.04, and can be installed by installing 'gnome-panel'. \nThe provided 'Gnome Classic Fallback (Metacity)' session does not use compositing, looks mostly like Gnome 2.x, and sports all current Gnome tools like settings center, providing for example a working up-to-date display settings panel like gnome-shell would do. The settings even allows the placement of the old-school panels to other screens etc., so they actually provide more options in respect to Ubuntu 12.04.\nThis way, almost all Gnome features are available besides the gnome-shell itself on a non-compositing desktop. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 won't let me login Yesterday I was updating some applications.

You can take an open source project and add your proprietary things and give it away as closed source. It doesn't work the other way round. Because as the name suggests, closed source wont give you any source code to fiddle with and if you reverse engineer it and do something, that is illegal.\nThis question is out of topic at this forum.\n", "Q: Wireless Atheros Qualcomm AR9285 not working My WiFi doesn't work.

Everything worked perfectly, until the game would start. I can heard the game noises, but then the game would crash. Trying to figure out the problem I clicked emulate a virtual desktop and run the game again. Now everything seemed to be working and I could run the game smoothly without problems. So what would the difference be between emulating it in a virtual desktop and not doing so, in order to pinpoint the problem...\n\nA: Emulate a virtual desktop is an option in Wine to run applications contained inside a window, which pretends to be the desktop of Windows.\n\nA: Emulate Virtual Desktop creates a separate window that acts as a desktop for launching games. Since it matches the resolution of your Linux desktop to make games appear full-screen, it eliminates the need to change the resolution manually using the game's config files.\nIn your case, the resolution of LoL may not have been set correctly and that is why although you could hear the sounds, the game UI never appeared.\n", "Q: Rename all files in subdirecories I am having a problem writing a script for mass renaming of files in subdirectories.\nI have a folder with multiple subfolders, and those subfolders have multiple files that I need to rename.\nThis is the where I got so far:\nfor file in $(find -name \"*.report\")\ndo\n  mv \"$file\" \"LPP_${file/LP_/}\"\ndone\n\nSo as you can see, I need to replace the 'LP_' string in the filename with the 'LPP_'.\nThis is not working because of the path to the file - the strings retrieved from the find command are only file names, and don't include the path.

The use of -execdir instead of the more common -exec ensures that the substitution happens only on the filename portion, in case any of the paths happens to contain the string LP_\nThe echo is just so you can try it out and check that the renaming looks correct - you will need to remove it to allow actual renaming.\n", "Q: Freezing issue on Ubuntu 14.04 I own a Dell Vostro 3500 with an Intel i5 CPU, 8GB DDR3 memory, NVIDIA GeForce GT 310M GPU and a 500GB SSD.\nI recently installed Linux ubuntu - but ever since, I've been having problems.\nI love ubuntu, but when I put my password and stuff, after login, it shows purple login screen, but can't see anything except my cursor that I can move around, m desktop fails to show up and program problem error comes up.

It can be set either to win32 (support only 32-bit applications), or to win64\n  (support both 64-bit applications and 32-bit ones in WoW64 mode).\n  \n*The architecture supported by a given Wine prefix is set at prefix creation time and cannot be changed afterwards.

I am new at this and need step by step help. Thanks.\n\nA: By default the Linux download is an RPM, which is a type of file to package software different from what is used by Ubuntu, as Ubuntu uses .deb files - or Debian packages. You can either convert the RPM to a Debian package, or go into the download section of the ProjectLibre site and download the Debian package directly, if available.\nFirst try to download the Debian package directly and install it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the download section of the ProjectLibre site and click on the directory with the latest version. \n\n*See if there's a .deb file. \n\n*If there is, click on it to download. The currently latest version is 1.6.1 and for this version, this is the Debian package file: projectlibre_1.6.1-1.deb. After downloading, just click on it to install.\n\n\nIf you cannot find a Debian package for the version you want to install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just hit the download button on the ProjectLibre site. This downloads the RPM file for the latest version. \n\n*Now install alien to convert the RPM and install as shown on the ProjectLibre blog (Thank You mytrant):\nsudo apt-get install alien\nsudo alien -ic package_file.rpm\n\n\nA: Let's have a look at that for you. As far as I can tell, there is no PPA or automated way to do this. Should someone see a way that I'm missing, please edit this answer and fix it. That said, this means that you will have to install it manually. \n1) To start, open your software updater and verify that you're up to date. \n2)Then go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/projectlibre/files/ProjectLibre/ and select the newest version(1.5.9 when this post was written), then download the file that ends in .deb. \n3) Now, open your file manager and navigate to your Downloads folder. You should see the .deb file right there, named something like projectlibre_1.5.9-1.deb. Double click on it.\n4) The Software Center will open and remind you that you had better trust this software. Click the install button on the right. \n5) This should pull in the dependencies, or at least inform you as to what those are during the install. \n6) Now your new software is installed and ready for use. \n\nA: Seems the .deb package is of poor quality, wrong usernames for example. \nI would recommend getting the pre-build tar.gz and unpacking that. \n\n\n*\n\n*Fetch the latest tar.gz projectlibre-1.6.2.tar.gz - This might be outdated  so check sourceforge for newer versions if needed \n\n*Open with file-roller and unpack to desired install directory. Personally I pick /opt but you need root privileges for that.\n\n*Start the projectlibre.sh script, either from terminal or follow this question. How do I run executable scripts from nautilus\n", "Q: I accidentally deleted all my data with `dd`. Any chance of recovery? I wanted to install opensuse alongside my trusty setup. When doing:  \ndd if=/path/to/downloaded.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M        \n\nI selected the iso to lay onto the harddrive instead of the flash drive and all of my data is gone. Can I recover the operating system? Can I at least recover my 30 gigs of vinyl recordings?\n\nA: dd is a whole lot worse than rm or any other mechanism that just marks blocks in the filesystem as available. dd does verbatim reads and writes on the disk or partition, thus by overwriting it not only deletes files on the filesystem but destroys information on the filesystem how the data was organized and the filesystem itself. While some data structures like EXT superblocks have some redundancy this does not allow to recover overwritten data.\nDependent on the behavior of dd, that is if it filled the remaining space of the partition with zeros and was let to finish the task, consider all data on the partition lost.\nThere is this myth that you still have to overwrite data several times to make data recovery almost impossible. The recovery techniques this is based upon are not applicable to modern disks and Peter Gutmann is cited in one of the answers with:\n\nAny modern drive will most likely be a hopeless task, what with ultra-high densities and use of perpendicular recording I don't see how MFM would even get a usable image, and then the use of EPRML will mean that even if you could magically transfer some sort of image into a file, the ability to decode that to recover the original data would be quite challenging.\n\nMore over the typical suggestion to make a raw copy of the disk and use the copy for recovery attempts is misleading. With failed drives that may be a possible solution, but also puts a lot of stress on the drive which may be counter productive. In your dd-scenario though this is different and looks like a quite moronic approach. Recovering data that was overwritten with dd by creating a copy with dd for further recovery approaches? That shouldn't give you anything else than what dd previously wrote, right? Now of course if you want to prove that Peter Gutmann's or more advanced methods still work with newer drives, you only want to read from the source drive and don't write to the drive to prevent further overwriting of data.\nHonestly, trying to recover all data will be almost impossible, waste a lot of time and bind resources (the drive cannot be used and the computer must continue the recovery process) that you could have easily avoided by creating backups and being more careful with such dangerous commands.\n\nA: This is not a step by step, but a little advice that might put you onto the right road.\nIf it is important for you make raw copy of the disk to a spare or new disk with dd. Then consider disconnect the original disk to prevent more changes by another misstake. (Only use the main disk to seed your recovery attempts on spare disk.) In your case, you have only written over the first part of your disk, equal to the size of the iso.\nHowever, that might confuse some recovery tools. So for that case it might be smart to use dd to zero out exactly the size of the iso and then use a tool to try to recover the partitions.\nWell, I do believe you have a great chance to recover all important stuff if your proceed with caution.\n", "Q: Dual Boot Menu Missing - Can't open Luna I'm certain that I correctly installed Elementary Luna OS alongside Vista, but my computer doesn't seem to recognize it.\nThere is no dual boot menu, and when I press F12 or F8 during start up, I can't find any option for Luna.\nThe advanced system properties in the Vista control panel doesn't show an option for Luna either.\nWhen I tried Snyper's suggestion, everything seemed to go fine, but I still can't open Luna:\n\n/dev/sda2 on /media/ACER type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)\n/dev/sda3 on /media/DATA type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)\n/dev/sdb5 on /media/06f44361-143e-4960-9e07-d04b5e9f4646 type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks)\n/dev/sdb1 on /media/64ECE79BECE76630 type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)\nelementary@elementary:~$ sudo mount --bind /dev /media/06f44361-143e-4960-9e07-d04b5e9f4646/dev\nelementary@elementary:~$ sudo mount --bind /sys /media/06f44361-143e-4960-9e07-d04b5e9f4646/sys\nelementary@elementary:~$ sudo mount --bind /proc /media/06f44361-143e-4960-9e07-d04b5e9f4646/proc\nelementary@elementary:~$ sudo chroot /media/06f44361-143e-4960-9e07-d04b5e9f4646\nroot@elementary:/# grub-install /dev/sdb\nInstallation finished.

We can chroot into the Luna partition and re-install GRUB rather easily.\nBoot into the Luna DVD. When you have done so, open the file manager and, in the list on the left, click on the partition that Luna is installed on. This will mount your partition.\nNext, open a terminal and type mount. The line showing your Luna partition should be near the bottom, and will look something like this:\n/dev/sda1 on /media/name type ext4 (rw,nodev)\n\nIn my example the partition was /dev/sda1 and the mountpoint was /media/name. The actual values, especially for /media/name, will possibly be different.\nNow, in the terminal, type\nsudo mount --bind /dev /media/name/dev\nsudo mount --bind /sys /media/name/sys\nsudo mount --bind /proc /media/name/proc\n\nwhere /media/name is the value we found previously.\nThis will mount the needed directories from your Luna installation so that we can chroot into it.\nIn the terminal again, type chroot /media/name.\nYou should now be seeing a root shell prompt (which should end in #).\nIf you have only one hard drive, type\ngrub-install /dev/sda (where /dev/sda is the partition name that mount showed us, but do not use the number at the end)\nAnd then:\nupdate-grub\n\nThis will reinstall GRUB, and update it so that it recognizes Vista.\nIf you have multiple drives, use the value that the mount command we typed earlier gave us, but without the number at the end.\nNow we're finished. In the terminal, type exit, which will make you leave the chroot. You may now restart, and hopefully GRUB will be displayed when next you boot.\n", "Q: ive downloaded the latest ubuntu and copied it to a usb stick ive downloaded the latest ubuntu iso file and copied it to my usb stick. i'm trying to boot from the USB stick on an aspire one net book and its telling me that its missing the operating system.\n\nA: It sounds like you copied the iso\nGreat instructions from the link below.

Example, instead of the read out being home/stuff/stuff2/stuff3/cat.png I would prefer the read out to be stuff3/cat.png\n\n*It must capture every file and folder and files within those folders.\n\n*It needs to be piped (I think this is the term) to a text file.\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The command\nfind -printf \"%P\\n\" > file\n\nwill list all files and directories below the current directory and redirect the list to file. From the printf section of man find\n  %P     File's name with the name of the command  line  argument\n         under which it was found removed.\n\n\nA: In addition to find, it is also possible to do this with just the bash shell:\nshopt -s globstar\nprintf \"%s\\n\" ** >file\n\nAll output file names are printed relative to the current directory.\nshopt -s globstar enables globstar which gives bash some of the power of find.  With globstar, two stars in a row will, as man bash states, \"match all files  and  zero or  more directories and subdirectories.\"  Here, printf is used to format the file names one to a line.  The output is sent to a text file called file.\nFile names with special characters\nThis question asks for output in a text file.  Text files generally have lines separated by newline characters.  If any file or directory name itself contains a newline character, this will lead to confusion.  Unless it is known that no such file exists, it is better to use a null-separated file, not a newline-separated text file.\nIn this case, one can use:\nprintf \"%s\\000\" ** >file\n\nOr, \nfind -print0 >file\n\nSince the nul character (ascii 000) is never allowed in a filename, this is the one format that can be used to store file names in a file without danger of losing information.\n\nA: If you can handle file in the form \"./dir/filename\", then a simple form of the find command would work:\nfind . -type f > filename will pipe all files below the current directory into \"filename\".\nAfter seeing @steeldriver's answer, a combination of his solution and mine would eliminate the \"./\" prefix, like so:\nIf you do not want blank directory names in the list (ie, just the file names in each directory,\nfind -type f -printf \"%P\\n\" > file\nIf you actually do want the directory names by themselves along with the directory/filenames, then omit the \"-type f\" flag from all the examples.\n", "Q: Running ubuntu side by side with windows and OSX i have a Apple macbook air currently running OS X 10.10 and Windows 7 HP with bootcamp, during the installation of windows i messed up a couple times badly enough that i had to factory reset my computer, i have since fixed that issue and the the 2 OSs are running in harmony.

(you may also tweak your patition size if you do not wish to use the entire hard drive)\nIMPORTANT - make sure you selct install the boot loader at the begining of external hard drive and NOT on sda (this allows the mac to recognize the external drive as a bootable device and also does not mess up your mac)\nafter that click on \"install now\"\nthen continue on with the installation as per normal\nafter it is complete and rebooted you should be able to select linux as a boot option.\nRemember important, the bootloader must be installed on the external drive, not on the internal drive.\n", "Q: What is wrong with My Apache2 (Alternate) 000-default.conf file I'm starting a course in PHP which will require its own web-pages that I do not want to conflict with my existing work.

The tooltip said \"Disabled by a hardware switch\".  However, I had not disabled it while in Fedora.  So, I booted back into Windows and enabled the Wifi and rebooted back to Fedora and it was on (detected).\nNot saying, you have this exact same situation but I anyway mentioned - doesn't hurt to check and try.  Let us know.\n\nA: Thanks for your help thus far. I managed to connect directly to my adsl router wifi. Ran updates. Rebooted.

There are instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB. This requires editing some dconf keys.\nHow can I edit these keys without dconf-tools, and without installing anything else? Are they in the file system somewhere?\n\nA: You can use gsettings to change most of these. For example:  \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open false  \n\nSee:  \nman gsettings  \n\nFor other gsettings related commands that will probably come in handy. dconf-editor is really quite useful though, it might be worth installing offline if possible.\n", "Q: How can I solve this terminal sudo update error/ or software updater error?

If so, and if the computer appears to work correctly booted to the CD/DVD then open Disk Utility from that CD/DVD and check to see if the hard disk is healthy.\nIt has been my experience that when people install Ubuntu on old computers and have problems, the cause very often is that the hard drive is sick.\nOn the other hand, if you cannot make your computer work correctly even running Ubuntu from the live CD/DVD, it could just mean that your computer simply isn't particularly compatible with Ubuntu.  I run into that occasionally.\n", "Q: Stuck in log-in loop, Ubuntu randomly crashes, Windows still boots first I'd really appreciate it if someone could shed some light on 3 problems of mine:\nI tried to reset my forgotten account password using the \"standard way\" in this guide. However, when I enter the new password at log-in, the screen goes black and just asks me for my password again. Small googling has told me that this is because you're not supposed to use the above method when the home drive is encrypted. I do still have the unwrapped key that I was given at installation, however, so how can I use it to fix this and have a working password again?\nSecond problem is very vague: about every other day, Ubuntu will crash without warning as if I took the battery straight out of the laptop. Any thoughts?\nLast is hopefully easy to fix; the pre-installed Windows 8.1 always boots first, even with ubuntu listed above it in UEFI settings.

You successfully got colored ls output after copying suitable .bashrc and .profile files to the other user's (e.g., www-data) home directory. Obtaining colored output in mercurial should presumably be as simple as additionally copying a suitable .hgrc file.\nAlso see the mercurial man page.\n", "Q: unexpected EOF on the last and next to last line while creating alias I am creating alias in .bash_aliases file in Ubuntu 14.04 with reference of this article\nI write these \nalias agi='sudo apt-get install'\nalias upd8='sudo apt-get update'\nalias perms='stat -c '%a - %n'\nalias dwld='cd ~/Downloads'\nalias ..='cd ..'\nalias la='ls -alh'\nalias hf='history | grep $1'\nalias pf='ps -e | grep $1'\n\nI close the terminal and file and start the terminal it always gives error.\n\nbash: /home/ice/.bash_aliases: line 8: unexpected EOF while looking for matching \n  `''\n  bash: /home/ice/.bash_aliases: line 9: syntax error: unexpected end of file\n\nPlease note there is not a line 9, no white space, no special character\nWhat I have done so far \n\n\n*\n\n*Removed white space new line and space between lines.\n\n*Remove last two lines but then error comes on last and next to last line ( 6 & 7)  \n\n*Deleted the temp file on same folder ending with ~ but error remains. \n\n*Removed the .. and la alias line ( may be it can cause issue) but error still remains.  \n\n*I have created an alias with perms from terminal before the creation of .bash_aliases so removed that alias using unalias perms \n\n*check all alias using alias and it show only first 2 alias andd interestingly first two aliases are working fine.\nIs this some kind of bugs or what?\n\nA: The syntax highlighting that Stack Exchange offers is enough to see what's wrong.

While installing some softwares, the system removed several softwares automatically. And I also found out newly installed softwares are almost useless to me. So I want to revert to the last state(that is, remove the newly installed softwares and install the recently removed softwares). Because there are many softwares in question, so I don't want to do it one by one. Is there any method to do the trick conveniently?\n\nA: Try the below:\ncat /var/log/apt/history.log | grep 'apt-get remove' | cut -d\" \" -f4 | xargs apt-get install\n\nWhat it does is, list all the packages that have been removed using 'apt-get remove' and then attempts to install them one by one.  You might also want to rerun this using 'purge' instead of 'remove'.\nNote that, this will install ALL applications you have removed so far, not just the recent ones.  You can edit the history.log file to remove old entries and keep only the \"recent\" ones\n", "Q: Where does /etc/inputrc come from?

No package assigned?\nI've seen there exist a inputrc file in the libreadline6 and bash packages but neither of them seems to be responsible of it (unless I failed to see the steps who produce it in one of those packages).\n\nA: After looking more clear-fully at the readline6 source package, more specifically at the readline-common.postinst file I discovered the file is copied at the configure step\nif [ \"$1\" = \"configure\" ] && [ \"$2\" = \"\" ]; then\n  install_from_default /usr/share/readline/inputrc /etc/inputrc\nfi\n\nI really don't understand why it's copied this way and not with some cp in the rules file or even in a debian/readline-common.install file.\n", "Q: How does awk -F work?

Awk regards each line of input data as composed of multiple \"fields\", which are essentially words separated by blank spaces. A blank space (or a tab character) is the default \"field separator\". In some cases, the input data may be divided by another character, for example, a \":\", and it would be nice to be able to tell Awk to use a different field separator. This is what the \"-F\" option does. To invoke Awk and specify a \":\" as the field separator, we write:\nawk -F:  ...\nIn this case, the field separator is a \".\"\n\nA: -F. sets the Field Separator to .: Given a  line a.b.c., awk will see four fields: a, b, c, and  (an empty field).\nfield=1\nwhile (field < NF) \n{\n     printf $field\n     if (field < NF - 1) \n     {\n         printf \".\"\n     }\n     field++\n}\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The code loops over each field and prints it. Note that field begins with 1, as field 0 is the entire line (or record, to be precise). Since the check is < NF, it never reaches the last field.\n\n*Until the second-last field, it adds a ., presumably as a field separator for some other program to handle.\n\n\n\nAll told this code is a convoluted way of implementing basename, a command often used to strip the extension from a filename:\n$ basename hello_world.ksh .ksh\nhello_world\n\nEven in awk, a more concise way would be to decrement the number of fields by one: NF--, and set the Output Field Separator to ., so that it gets automatically added between fields:\n$ echo hello_world.ksh | awk -F. -v OFS=. '{NF--}1'\nhello_world\n\n", "Q: apt-get install -f wants to remove linux-image-generic I seem to remember doing the suggested autoremove earlier this year and bricking my system in the process. linux-headers-generic and linux-image-generic seem pretty important. \n    phm@LuckyCompCo:~$ sudo apt-get -f install\n    Reading package lists... Done\n    Building dependency tree       \n    Reading state information...

They provide nothing by themselves, but rely on other packages. These two always depend on the latest version of the kernel, so when you do apt-get upgrade, the latest version get installed. You can safely remove them, but you won't be prompted for kernel upgrades if you do. You can mark them as manually installed:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic\n\nAfter this, autoremove should not suggest removing these two.\n\nA: Those package are being suggested to be removed because they are marked as \"Automatically installed\" instead of manually:\n\nThe following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:\n\nThis is not normally the case as Ubuntu tries to keep the system using the latest available kernel using this metapackage, in fact, after you install your system most packages are marked as manually installed. You unknowingly must have set it up as automatically installed, but you can safely ignore the message so long you don't use the autoremove command. To mark those packages as manually installed you can use apt-mark:\nsudo apt-mark manual linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic\n\nWith this, the package must be successfully removed from the list. You can use aptitude's unmarkauto to mark packages as manually installed too.\n\nWhy not using apt-get install packages to mark them?\nFirst of all, it can get undesired results such as upgrading the packages or install others unrelated packages. Secondly, that's not the usage of the install command. This feature was implemented so when you select to install a package already installed it wouldn't be uninstalled automatically when you used autoremove or with other packages, since you already listed the package to be installed explicitly, instead of implicitly as result of other package installation.\n", "Q: Software can't be installed or removed because the authentication service is not available I'm trying to install flash via the software center and I get this error :\n\"Software can't be installed or removed because the authentication service is not \navailable.

Seems cryptswap is being used.\nWhen I open the gnome-system-monitor it says \"Swap is not available\".\nHere is some edited terminal output:\nsudo swapon -s\n(Nothing)\n\nsudo swapon -a\nswapon: stat failed /dev/mapper/cryptswap1: No such file or directory\n\ncat /etc/fstab\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=3dbb0bca-df4c-426d-a672-2e31e6683646 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n# swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation\n#UUID=ef29aae9-af0e-403c-b702-334acb1d5879 none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\ncat /etc/crypttab\ncryptswap1 UUID=ef29aae9-af0e-403c-b702-334acb1d5879 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nsudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,UUID\nNAME   FSTYPE UUID\nsda           \n├─sda1 ext4   3dbb0bca-df4c-426d-a672-2e31e6683646\n└─sda5\n\nGParted:\n\nAny help is appreciated =)\n\nA: The link necordian provided has steps that do resolve this problem (I tested on a system with RAID and encrypted home directory/swap) except 1 step is missing you need to reboot before swap becomes available. Here is what I did to get my encrypted swap partition working.\nNeed UUID and Device name for the swap partition to fix this on RAID system with encrypted home directory/swap:\nFind Device ID using \"Disks\" utility:\nClick the ubuntu logo in the unity toolbar and then type Disks to open disk utility.\nSelect the SWAP partition and the device name should be listed below.\n(usually /dev/dm-# for RAID or /dev/sda# for non RAID)\nOn my PC with RAID it was /dev/dm-6.\nGet UUID from crypttab:\ncat /etc/crypttab\n\nMy /etc/crypttab:\ncryptswap1 UUID=5381faa1-369c-4504-9d8d-acfc7cb69e71 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nThen run the following with your swap UUID and device name:\nsudo mkswap -U 5381faa1-369c-4504-9d8d-acfc7cb69e71 /dev/dm-6\n\nAdd the following text ,1024 to the swap line in /etc/crypttab directly after swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 do not leave any spaces.\nsudo nano /etc/crypttab\n\n/etc/crypttab should now look similar to this:\ncryptswap1 UUID=5381faa1-369c-4504-9d8d-acfc7cb69e71 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256,1024\n\nRun the following command:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nReboot and your swap should now work (well it worked for me).\nTry rebooting a few times to make sure it's all good.\n\nA: It looks like the UUID for your swap partition isn't being reported. I don't know if that's supposed to be normal for encrypted swap, but you could try specifying the partition using other methods in crypttab, such as:\ncryptswap1 /dev/sda5 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\n\nA: I traced /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 down to /dev/dm-1 so this worked for me:\nsudo mkswap /dev/dm-1\nsudo swapon -a\n\nThis enabled the swap that was already there. I am using Ubuntu 14.10 64-bit.\n", "Q: ubuntu on tonbux 10 inch tablet I am a big fun of ubuntu.  I recently bought a tonbux tablet 10 inch with android.  I have tried to install ubuntu on it but I don't seem to be able to unlock the device, has anyone tried this before on a tonbux tablet?\n\nA: First of all, verify that your tablet is supported by Ubuntu touch, check this.\nThen, check this tutorial to unlock and install Ubuntu on your device\n\nA: It looks like it is not, this is a cheap tablet I bought from amazon at an affordable price of 70GBP, quite surprise it is not even yet a work-in-progress.  Anyway, if anyone has tried this before please let us know.\n", "Q: Ubuntu will not load since I updated to 14.10 I have used the older versions over a year. After the latest update only the background shows.\nAfter searching similar problems on online forums I did the following:\nCtrl-Alt-F1, I run xfdesktop, it installed itself (15MB), xfdesktop gave the error message:\n\"Failed to parse arguments: Cannot open display:\"\nWhat should I do next? (I am a newbie)\n\nA: I had the same problem on a computer for which I had changed unity to gnome. I think the gnome was the cause - I ended up reinstalling everything from scratch. But be careful when you do fresh installation because Ubuntu (at least in my language) did not make the options between replacing the current Ubuntu installation and completely formatting the drive clear.\n", "Q: How to install a virtual machine on a different physical hard drive using VirtualBox As the title states, I'm looking to install a Virtual Machine on a different physical Hard Drive using VirtualBox..\nI don't know how to do it though. I can't find any place in the installation process that lets me pick a different hard drive.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Change default storage path\nFrom the VirtualBox Manager we can define the default location of Virtual Machines by choosing a location path, which can also be on a different drive if this drive was mounted with r/w permissions:\n\nCreate a VDI on a different path\nIf that drive is not for general use we can also create a virtual drive we had stored on a different path (click on ):\n\nLoad a VDI to an existing VM\nAny VDI located on a different drive can also be attached to a virtual machine on the machine's storage settings. Click on  then choose a virtual hard disk file on any path of mounted drives.\nCaveats\nTo avoid an error when starting a virtual machine we have to take care to Always mount the drive holding our VDIs before we start Virtual Box.\n\nA: Open virtual box ..\n1) click new \n2) choose OS\n3)Memory size\n4) Create a vertual hard drive now\n5) choose type (VDI)\n6) Dynamic allocated\n7) File location and size \nfirst mount the destination partition (Just open it on nautilus)\npress on folder icon and choose your location\ncheck this image http://imgur.com/Rsm3nSy \n\nA: Once you create the Virtual machine all you have to do is copy or cut it to the different drive.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Shuts Down on Restart (v 14.04.1) I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 on my laptop and I am not able to restart it. Every time I press the restart button, the system logs me off as usual, then the ubuntu loading screen appears (with the 5 dots) and after the second dot is completed, the whole computer SHUTS DOWN. The laptop makes the sound of a HARD SHUT DOWN (like when I am holding the power button to hard shut down the computer). It appears as if the computer crashes right before it restarts.\nShut Down button on the other hand works just fine.\nWhat could cause this problem?\nI should also note that I am dual-booting Ubuntu with Windows 8.1\nHere are my specs:\nCPU: Intel Core i7 - 3630QM, 2.4 GHz\nMemory: 6GB\nHDD: 1TB\nOS: Ubuntu 14.04.1\nGraphics: nVidia GEFORCE 635M GT, 2GB\nInstalled Apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cpufreq Indicator\n\n*Unity Tweak Tool\n\n*nvidia-prime\nThank You\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my desktop and I fixed it magically by changing some options on my computer BIOS.

It is not a big problem but more like a convenient feature! \nI have no experience in Linux at all and I need a help.\nI have re-formatted my HP Net book and loaded Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Everything went as planned except this small issue! GRUB gets loaded first and I cannot workout how to not load GRUB at the boot time? There is no other OS on the netbook. Hard drive was reformatted\n\nI am having issue. Attempted to apply the boot-repair suggestion and got following error:\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/yannubuntu/boot-repair/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-i386/Packages 404 Not Found\nE: Some index files failed to download.

Done\nE: Unable to locate package boot-repair\n\nWhen I try the 3rd solution, again similar error. It is failing to fetch packages?\n\nA: GRUB will be there even if you like it or not. Believe me, its there for a good purpose, for example, if your system fails to boot, you can go into the recovery from the GRUB.\nBut i f you dont want to see the GRUB screen at all, you can do the following.\nWe need to edit the grub configuration file. Type the following command into terminal\n\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nThis will open up geditor to edit the grub file. Search for GRUB_TIMEOUT=10 and change it to GRUB_TIMEOUT=0. \nYou should really consider changing it to a smaller time like 3 or 4 because changing it to 0 will result in the GRUB screen not visible at all, and in case you run into issues, it will be a pain to rectify.\nSave the file and close geditor.\nThen type sudo update-grub and reboot system.\n\nA: This is not a problem:  Grub is the boot loader for Linux and will always be present at boot time, prior to starting Ubuntu.  You can set the Grub menus not to show, which sounds like what you want.\nThere are several ways to edit and update Grub - since you are new to Linux, I'd recommend a graphical tool called Grub-customizer:  Open a terminal and type the following commands.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:peterlevi/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n", "Q: Purple haze displaying from power on I had the computer hooked up to a 23\" LG monitor via DVI and everything was fine. Then I hooked it up to a 27\" Dell U2713HM via the same DVI and I get this crazy purple haze over the screen. I did try changing cables and that didn't work.\nEverything acts fine though. It doesn't crash or freeze, it's just this ugly purple haze that's always on the screen, from the time that when I power on.\nWhere do I start trying to troubleshoot this?\n\nA: This doesn't seem like a software issue. It could very well be a problem with your display. I would suggest connecting another computer to the same display. If the problem persists, there's something wrong with the display.\nIf the display does work fine with another computer you should try booting a completely different OS to determine if the problem is in software or hardware.\n", "Q: Auto-complete not working in Chrome Ubuntu 14.04 I am using Chrome Version 38.0.2125.111 (64-bit) on Ubuntu 14.04.\nThe problem is that the auto-complete doesn't work when writing in the search line, and I have no idea what the problem is.\nThank you for helping!\n\nA: This might be due to disabling of auto fill in browser. so please check the following, \nsettings---->select Show Advanced Settings----->Under Passwords and forms---->Click Check the box Enable Autofill to fill out web forms in a single click.\nHope this helps!!!!\n", "Q: Xubuntu: Locale settings in /etc/default/locale are overridden by regional format settings I am running xubuntu 14.04 and recently changed my /etc/default/locale to\nLANG=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\n**LC_NUMERIC=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"**\nLC_MONETARY=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLANGUAGE=\"en_GB:en\"\n\nEverything seems to work fine except the time and numeric format, which is still in german.

This seems to override my locale settings. Is there any way to keep these regional settings from overriding the settings in my /etc/default/locale? \nAnd, yes I did a restart after my changes ;)\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Manually editing /etc/default/locale is usually not a good idea on an *ubuntu desktop.\nIf you want that the changes affect all users on the system, you can create a file in the /etc/profile.d/ folder, for instance like this:\n$ cat /etc/profile.d/locale-tweak.sh\nexport LC_NUMERIC=en_GB.UTF-8\nexport LC_TIME=en_GB.UTF-8\n\nOtherwise, to affect your own user only, you can put those export commands in your ~/.profile file instead.\n", "Q: Alt-shift: skip some of the languages? I use alt-shift to switch between keyboard layouts in Ubuntu 14.04. I have 3 languages enabled, but I use one of them much less often.\nHow could I make alt-shift skip the rarely used language(s)?\n\nA: This is what \"switch to previous layout\" should do but it does not on Ubuntu. It just doesn't work.\n\nIt does work great in OSX. It loops through the layouts you 've used lately(usually two).\n\nA: \nHow could I make alt-shift skip the rarely used language(s)?\n\nI would assume you can not. The system does not count keyboard lay-outs used to determine how often it is used.\nThen again it becomes possible if you change the question to ....\n\nHow could I skip the rarely used language(s)?\n\nThen the answer would be: by using another key combination and change that key combination to switch between the 2 lay-outs you do want to switch between.\nLay-outs are numbered from 0. So the 1st and 2nd lay-out are activated with respectively...\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources current 0\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources current 1\n\n(or \"2\" if you, in your case, need the 3rd keyboard). \nThis will take up 2 keys though: you can add one to a key like control + P and the other to control + O. If you want this to be one key you would need to change the 0 in \n$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources current 0\n\nto a variable that toggles the 0 to a 1 and a 1 to a 0.\n\nThat would be this command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources current $(($(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources | grep -Po \"'[[:alpha:]]+'\\)\" | wc -l)-1))\n\nThis would allow you to use 1 key and make it a toggle.\n\nRefer to How can I change what keys on my keyboard do? (How can I create custom keyboard commands/shortcuts?) on how to set this. Tweak tools and compiz action plugin would be 2 methods on setting those.\n", "Q: I installed ubuntu with windows, and windows don't load grub shows that there is Windows, but when I click on it, it showing me a black screen with a dash at top-left; and then sending me back to grub\nwhat can I do? please help !!!\n\nA: I doubt if you are able to \"click\" on the GRUB Boot screen.  Have you already tried 'update-grub'?\nHowever, to fix Windows boot, insert a Windows bootable repair/recovery media and attempt to fix the MBR.  There should be a utility to scan your active Windows installation and then rewrite MBR. For example, Windows 7 and 8 has a bootrec utility. \nOnce it is done and you are able to load Windows, then you will need to attempt to repair grub which should pick up your valid Windows entry from MBR.\n", "Q: package system broken (14.04) I tried installing Google Earth this morning using this code:\nTerminal Commands:\nsudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libglib2.0-0:i386 libsm6:i386 libglu1-mesa:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libxext6:i386 libxrender1:i386 libx11-6:i386 libfontconfig1:i386 lsb-core\nwget -O google-earth64.deb http://dl.google.com/dl/earth/client/current/google-earth-stable_current_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i google-earth64.deb\nrm google-earth64.deb\n\nIt did not appear to install (can't find it when I search anyway), and I am now getting a package system broken error when I try to run software updates.\nI am new to ubuntu, so am looking for detailed help with this.\nThanks!\n\nA: Try sudo apt-get -f install to install the missing dependencies and try again.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu via a USB stick I have decided to try Ubuntu because 1)my friend keeps saying how good it is and how much windows suck, and 2)my OEM windows stuffed up.

So what does Openstack bring that MAAS and Juju do not?\n\nA: MaaS/juju allow you to utilize the hardware that you have one by one, while openstack (this is oversimplification) also allows you to build virtual machines (usually kvm guest), which in many cases significantly improve the physical hardware utilization.\nIn addition, openstack gives you the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*It provides a self-service portal where end users (not sysadmins) can easily provision resources - virtual machines, networks (private), storage\n\n*It allows you to meter usage (and as a result bill or cross-charge the users)\n\n*It allows you to take snapshots, spin up new virtual machines from snapshots, etc.\n\n*It has a bunch of add on services for application provisioning, such as building hadoop clusters, template-based provisioning, database provisioning.\n\n*It can actually manage bare metal, kvm, xen, vmware and docker containers from the same interface.\n\n\nEDIT: Probably the most differentiating aspect that i missed to mention the first time is the multi-tenancy model. Even if openstack is deployed as a private cloud, you can have separate tenants for different divisions/departments of the entity and users from one tenant will have no access to resources allocated to a different tenant.\nThis is not an exhaustive answer, just a high-level overview.\n\nA: It is definitely for larger organizations - 200 virtual servers or more. The more virtual servers, the lower overall cost per server and the foundation server cost is spread across more compute nodes. You can read how Intel migrated 17,000 VMware virtual servers to OpenStack and saved $21 million while decreasing virtual server provisioning from 90 days to 30 minutes. The PDF is available on this link: http://www.openstackready.com\nAlso note that ATT is deploying 500,000 OpenStack nodes between now and 2020. It will run the entire ATT IT infrastructure and eliminate VMware licensing and maintenance. Average cost per virtual machine will be less than $3 per month per VM (includes the server, storage and networking).\n", "Q: ubuntu-tweak not starting When I try to run ubuntu-tweak in terminal I get the following:\nadwaita@adwaita-HP-2000-Notebook-PC:~$ ubuntu-tweak\nAttempt to unlock mutex that was not locked\nAborted\nadwaita@adwaita-HP-2000-Notebook-PC:~$ ubuntu-tweak -d\n[Launcher][DEBUG] Distribution: Ubuntu 14.04 trusty\nApplication: Ubuntu Tweak 0.8.8-1~trusty1\nDesktop:gnome (ubuntu-tweak:84)\nAttempt to unlock mutex that was not locked\nAborted\nadwaita@adwaita-HP-2000-Notebook-PC:~$\nWhat to do now?

How can I create a PPA that automatically pulls changes from a git (hub) repository every time a new tag (release) is added, and then compiles the app?\n\nA: In general, you will need to maintain (install, configure) a continuous integration system. With proper configuration, such system can pull from git(hub) periodically or on every commit, it can build and package the software, and it can push it to a ppa and update the ppa metadata.\nThere are multiple CI systems, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*jenkins - you need to install this on your servers\n\n*travis - hosted solution that you can use online\n\n*teamcity - there is a free and commercial versions that you need to install on your servers\n\n\nFor jenkins and teamcity, there may be some online providers too, but I have never looked for such.\n", "Q: disable rsh on ubuntu server I installed rsh-server in my system for test purposes, but now I want to disable it without removing its package.

However the actual brightness stays the same, until I get to the absolute lowest value possible, then the backlight just turns off completely (which I can then turn back on again by increasing the brightness again). I've also changed my grub settings as suggested by this question but that doesn't fix things for me. \nWhen I look at /sys/class/backlight I only have the intel_backlight folder.

Some time ago I installed Ubuntu on my Windows 7 system, going the partition drive route.  I'm now out of space on the Ubuntu partition and can't do any updates.  I want to get rid of Windows and the partition, leaving just Ubuntu on my computer.  Is there a way to do this without losing everything I have in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Two step process:\nFirst Step:  With Ubuntu up and running, use gparted to delete the partition that has windows 7 on it.  Modify grub to remove the Windows 7 boot entry...\nSecond step:\nDecide if you want to incorporate the space into your existing Ubuntu partition, or mount the partition as a directory within your file structure.\nTo incorporate, you will need to create a live USB to boot from - the one that you download from Canonical for installing Ubuntu would be great.  Boot from this USB using the 'try Ubuntu' choice.  The USB will have a copy of gparted on it, and you can use this to increase the size of your Ubuntu partition, although you will need to move any partitions between the unused space and your Ubuntu partition.\nShould you decide to have the space mounted on the directory somewhere, you should use gparted to create an acceptable partition and format, and then study the man mount commands to learn about getting the partition online, and placing appropriate entries into /etc/fstab\n", "Q: install windows 8.1 alongside ubuntu I have windows 7 and ubuntu 14.04 on my ASUS laptop.

I would like to know about them.\n\nA: The acceptable flags for programs, and what those flags do, differ from program to program.  Because the -v or -l flags (or any flags, for that matter) will vary from program to program, it is best to read the manpages for each application to figure out what does what.\nIn your case, you specify fdisk and shred. Try reading the manpages for each.  (man fdisk and man shred)\n\nA: For a simple list of the arguments and what they do you can usually run command --help. Most commands show the most common or useful arguments (like -l) when run with --help or -h. The help page also shows what the command does. It would be useful if just want to know what the command does in one line instead of a whole paragraph.\nWhile man command would show a lot more information. I find it easier to run it with the --help as it is easier to find what you are looking for quickly. You could use command --help if you already know what the command does and just need to look for the correct argument to use and man command when you want to know what the command does and a lot of other information not shown in the help page.\nSome programs may not have the help page in which your only option would be to see the manpages.\n", "Q: Weird (and annoying) screen flicker on Compaq Presario CQ50 I have a Compaq Presario CQ50 laptop.

Piercey.\n\nA: This flickering is a persistent issue; I've experienced it on a Compaq Presario and on a Toshiba Satellite.

A) At a terminal, type gstreamer-properties; if nothing happens, install with sudo apt-get install gnome-media; once installed, try tweaking the video properties. B) On my Toshiba, I tried installing updated intel drivers using these instructions (Ubuntu 14.04 - changing Intel graphics driver configurations?); surely there's something similar for your Compaq. C) I tried resetting the resolution and refresh rate as described here (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHZ5n9pHohI). D) I had some kind of success when I used nomodeset (What does `nomodeset` do); there was no flickering, but performance was slowed down in so many other ways that this “solution” is like shooting your foot when you have a toothache to take your mind off the pain in your mouth. \n**\nI eventually solved this issue by using a newer (3.18) kernel.\n\nA: I've had this issue as well on my compaq cq60.\nFirst, Purge the proprietary Nvidia drivers (if any)\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-*\n\nNext, install Nvidia 304 drivers and nvidia settings\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-304 nvidia-settings\n\nLastly, Reboot\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: Weird Noise From Left Headphone I hear this weird noise from my left headphone all the time.

There are at least three possible reasons for this: the nouveau DRM kernel module is not loaded, a version mismatch between the Nouveau DRM and libdrm, or KMS being disabled.\nFirst check, that lsmod command lists nouveau. If not, do modprobe nouveau to load the nouveau DRM kernel module, and check the kernel log for possible errors.\nIf the kernel module nouveau is loaded according to lsmod command, but there are no kernel messages about nouveau at all, then most likely Nouveau KMS is disabled. This prevents the driver to work at all. Possible places to disable KMS are:\nkernel command line with: nomodeset, drm.modeset=0, nouveau.modeset=0 or similar\nmodprobe.conf or modprobe.d/ adding the module options drm modeset=0 or nouveau modeset=0\ninitramfs carrying the above module options\nCheck and remove all those that you may find, and retry.\nQuote from http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/TroubleShooting/#index1h3\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK: How can I use PyQt for developing Ubuntu Touch apps?

I'm trying to get rid of windows and the partition.  I'm currently running a dual boot, Ubuntu/windows system.\n\nA: Yes, you can use an Ubuntu DVD to remove it.\nStart off by booting off the disk and enter live CD mode. Once inside, start up the partition manager (like Gparted). Find your Windows partition in Gparted's menu—it'll be listed as an NTFS drive.\nRight-click on that Windows partition and choose \"Delete\" from the menu. Your machine may have other Windows-related partitions as well, like \"System Reserved\" and recovery partitions. If you want, you can delete these as well (but make sure you have recovery discs handy if you're going to delete a recovery partition).\nRight-click on your Linux partition and choose \"Resize/Move.\" Resize it so it takes up the rest of the now-free space on your drive.\nClick the \"Apply All Operations\" button in the toolbar to perform the selected tasks. It may give you a warning saying that your computer may not boot, but with most Linux instalations this shouldn't be a problem (though if it is, check out this article to fix it). This process may take some time, so let it be!\nWhen it finishes, you should have a hard drive with nothing but Linux on it. Your boot menu will still have some Windows entries, and it'll work fine if you leave them there, but if you want to clean things up, just open up a Terminal in Linux and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nto remove them.\nHere goes the original source. :)\nI've done this myself, but usually I just wipe my whole hard drive rather than just deleting a partition.\n", "Q: Netflix error code M7357-1003 Netflix error code M7357-1003. \nI am using Ubuntu 14.04.

On a laptop you usually have working keys for changing the backlight and you see OSD notifications while changing them.\nHow to patch this up for “normal” desktops? How to get parts of this going?\n\nA: Even on many laptops, but especially on a desktop you should get the keyboard events for brightness changes on X11.\nIf you don’t have a fancy keyboard with keys for that, decide on your own shortcuts. Configure XKB to report the keyboard symbol you want for this.\nThere are “official” keysyms for monitor brightness up/down in X. And unity-settings-daemon or gnome-settings-daemon have a passive grab on them. Unfortunately I didn’t find a reasonable way to make those programs leave those keys alone.\nunity-/gnome-setting-daemon are the origin of those fancy OSD messages. They also trigger the change of the backlight brightness via dbus(?). Their very own gsd-backlight-helper is executed that way to actually change the backlight.\nThat ...-backlight-helper binary goes out to look for devices in /sys which belong to the standardized backlight class. It searches first for devices of type “firmware”, then \"platform\" and then \"raw\". This is the recommended way according to backlight class spec.\nOn desktop systems the monitors can often handle DDC/CI control, which is an entirely different handling and is not setup on Ubuntu. There are no kernel drivers which map this kind of control to a device in the backlight class. At least there is an abandoned tool ddccontrol which interfaces via DDC/CI. It can do this with two access types. One is via PCI registers or memory of the VGA card or something. The other and better paved route is via I2C bus interfaces. For that you have to load the i2c-dev module, which drives the /dev/i2c-? devices. Some of these devices reflect the real existing I2C buses in VGA, DVI and HDMI connections. DisplayPort emulates I2C, so it works as well. The good news is the kernel support is pretty complete here, because DDC (without CI) is also used to read the monitor identification and specs (EDID).\nIf you have root access it should be feasible to replace the gsd-backlight-helper (or usd-backlight-helper) with a script driving ddccontrol.\nWithout root access on the machine it is probably easier to (re)configure the keyboard to report some other keysym where nothing is listening on (there are tons of keysyms for multimedia keys, just grab some). Then tell your window manager or use xbindkeys to launch ddccontrol directly and/or launch a script which also generates some OSD notifications if desired.\nddccontrol has some disadvantages: it’s not maintained as it seems and it takes so long to start up (on my system) for no apparent reason. I was thinking about hacking a script together which does DDC/CI itself. The biggest challenge here is to actually find out what to talk over the bus. I guess the source code is a good way to find out.\n", "Q: Support for Kworld UB435-Q V3 TV Stick I am trying to set up a small Home Theatre PC, based on Ubuntu (14.04), where I'm planning to run MythTV.\nI've chosen the KWorld UB435-Q because of price, and have hit a wall as it seems many others have.\nI verified mine is a V3. This post on linuxtv.org says the V3 only works on a USB3 interface. Well, that is not what the package spec says... But of course my box is USB 2.0 only.\nNow the folks at LinuxTV seem to have done some work on that V3 device\nFrom the comments, the \"patch\" has been verified on ATSC signals (8VSB).\nWhat would it take to have that patch available on a Ubuntu build ? Short of me rebuilding the kernel...\n\nA: I managed to get this to work...\nThis page at linuxtv.org informs that this KWorld UB435-Q V3 is supported in Kernel 3.16. \nI updated my box (Ubuntu 14.04) to use Kernel 3.16 (explained at How can I install 3.16 kernel on Ubuntu 14.04), much easier than trying to recompile the V4L library with the updated driver.\nOnce this got done, the device is recognized (expected), and able to scan. I have now my MythTV setup locking all ATSC channels.\nMy box is a Gygabyte Brix GB-BXBT-2807. It has 1 USB 3.0 and 2 USB 2.0.

As I mentioned above, the integrated graphics card is an Intel HD 2000 with dual VGA and HDMI outputs, both of which worked fine until Windows failed and I decided to switch to Ubuntu.\n\nA: You need to purge the intel graphics installer from your system using the following command in a terminal   --   sudo apt-get purge intel-linux-graphics-installer && sudo apt-get autoremove  --           Shut down system and restart.    If that does not fix the problem I recommend doing a fresh clean install of UBUNTU 14.04, after fresh install do not install the Intel graphics installer, that installer was only to be used in a couple of previous versions of linux and not to be used in UBUNTU 14.04, it can cause you alot of problems, also DO NOT install (mesautils), which can also cause you problems with resolution. After your fresh install, let UBUNTU install the correct driver for your system. Also when you copy and paste above command do not use the (--) in the command they are only there to seperate. I am also using a gateway DX 4860 computer which is a newer system but with the same i3 chip and onboard graphics and this worked for me.\n", "Q: UbuntuShape component doesn't show the background color.

What is the defination of \"machine\" here? Is it an LXC container?\nNOTE: I setup my MAAS with VMs.\n\nA: What is a machine in Juju?\nWhat a machine is, is context-sensitive. A machine is an instance of the provider. If you're using digitalocean as your provider, a machine will be a digitalocean VPS. If you're using the local provider, it will be an LXC container. Or in your case, you're using MAAS as a provider, it is a MAAS machine (a VM in your case).\nWhy did juju create a new machine?\nThe default behaviour of deploy is to create a new machine for every unit it deploys. You can deploy a charm to a specific machine with juju deploy mysql --to 3. This will deploy the mysql charm to machine 3. More information on deploying charms to specific machines.\nIf you do not use the --to option, juju will ask a new machine from the provider, MAAS in your case. If the provider does not have any machines ready, it will give an error. This is the error you get. MAAS does not have any machines ready.\n", "Q: sudo apt-get command not found I cant run apt-get update or anything involves apt-get command.

I was messing with SSH tunneling into my Raspberry Pi (with no problems) and since then, every time I open terminal on my Ubuntu machine, it tries to ssh into the RPi. When not connected to a network, I actually have to press Ctrl+C before I get my terminal back or else wait for it to fail. \nIn my attempts to fix this, I have gone so far as to completely remove openssh-client, openssh-server, and ssh from my machine. The only change is that upon launching, terminal now informs me that ssh isn't installed (I presume this is because it is trying to run an ssh command every time). To be clear, this is the FIRST thing that comes up when I launch terminal:\nThe program 'ssh' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-client  \nusername@username-ThinkPad-X230:~$ \n\nWhat did I do and how do I stop terminal from trying to run ssh every time it opens? \nEDIT/UPDATE: I have played around with restoring my .bashrc file from /etc/skel/ and discovered that when I have NO .bashrc file in /HOME/ my terminal initializes correctly (i.e. without running ssh). However, as soon as I restore even the default .bashrc from /etc/skel/, I get the ssh prompt popping up again every time.\nEDIT/UPDATE: I am officially an idiot! Indeed, .bashrc was sourcing a file that caused the problem. In fact, it was only .bash_aliases. I, in my infinite ineptitude, added an alias to shell into my pi without prefixing alias so it was running the command every time .bashrc ran the line. sigh\n\nA: Look under the following locations for references for 'ssh' executable (including programs mentioned in 'source'd files within the listed location. (Note: assuming you use bash as your default shell)\n$HOME/.bashrc OR $HOME/.bash_profile OR $HOME/.profile OR /etc/profile\n\nA: Install another Command Line Interface like GUAKE or any other terminal of your choice from the sofware center.\nNow check if the problem persists even in that. If yes, there might be some common bash setting that is altered, which I don't know of. But if there is no autologin in the new Command Line Interface, then you need to change the setting of your original gnonme-Terminal:\ngnome-terminal → edit → profile preferences → title and command → run a custom command instead of my shell.\nSee if there is an ssh command written in that.\nIf there is, remove that option.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: How to use Virtual Machine to use programs in my pre-installed win 7 in my Ubuntu OS?

If so will that help?\n\nA: Did you install and run \"pavucontrol\" (Pulseaudio volume control) ?\nIn pavucontrol, go to the \"output devices\" tab:\n You will  probably see 2 devices (HDMI and  internal soundcard)  .\nYou can choose which one is active by clicking the green \"define as alternative\" button that is near each soundcard .\nYou can also try changing profile in \"configuration\" tab.\n", "Q: 3TB partition disappeared by Windows 7 I am wondering if anyone can help me with a problem...\nI have a dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows 7 system.  I bought a new 3TB HDD as I needed more storage space (the HDD is not used to boot the system).  I created a GPT table and a single 3TB NTFS partition on the new HDD using GParted in Ubuntu.  I then proceeded to transfer files onto this 3TB HDD in Winodws 7.\nEverything was going well until the drive capacity hit 2TB (I think).  Then I started having problems copying.  After rebooting, I found the partition has disappeared along with all the data.  GParted gave me an error message that the partition had been altered to use less than the capacity and asked me if I want to fix it.  Even after pressing \"Fix\" the partition is still gone.\nAny one has any suggestions on how I might recover the partition and the data in either Ubuntu or Windows?\nMany Thanks\n\nA: try to to split the capacity of the drive to small partitions like 1TB each, or 500gb, i think it will not have issues, although it is a bit strange to see this happen\n", "Q: How can I find a program for selecting in \"open with...\" I wanted to install an extension for OpenOffice.

So I selected Other, but then I had no clue, how to find Open Office.\nI went to /usr/bin but saw no clue of open office. I tried \"which openoffice\" - no reply. \"which writer\" - no reply. \nFinally I had an idea - I opened OpenOffice and did \"ps -ecf|grep open\". I found it in \"/opt/openoffice4/program/soffice.bin\". \nIs there a better way to locate a program on my computer?\n\nA: After choosing \"other application\", at the resultant window you must click the bar near the bottom marked \"show other applications\". I understand your frustration. Ubuntu is ordinarily so sensible that one simply would not expect it to need you to ask to be shown the other applications you might want to select from. After the other options are shown to you, you should be able to find OpenOffice.

If you wish to redirect users from the non-secure site to\n  the SSL site, you can use an ordinary Redirect directive inside the\n  non-secure VirtualHost\n\nSo, try to add this directive in your non-secure VirtualHost:\nRedirect permanent / https://www.mywebsite.com/\n\nIf you want anyway use rewrite rule, you should add these lines in non-secure VirtualHost:\nRewriteEngine On\n# This will enable the Rewrite capabilities\n\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on\n# This checks to make sure the connection is not already HTTPS\n\nRewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]\n# This rule will redirect users from their original location, to the same location but using HTTPS.\n# i.e.  http://www.mywebsite.com/foo/ to https://www.mywebsite.com/foo/\n\nas described in HTTP to HTTPS Apache wiki page.\n\nYour configuration doen't work, because it is not defined a non-secure VirtualHost (usually on port 80) that handles http requests and redirect them to secure VirtualHost. \nTry adding these lines:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n   ServerName dev.dom1.com\n   Redirect permanent / https://dev.dom1.com/\n</VirtualHost>\n\nIn this case you don't need a DocumentRoot because this VirtualHost is redirecting everything. \nRewrite rule shown in your configuration file protect secure VirtualHost from being accessed via http protocol, for example http://www.mywebsite.com:443/ will be https://www.mywebsite.com:443/\nYou should also check that your site linking to the correct page (https) from within your HTML pages.\n\nA: This is an old post, but in Ubuntu 14.04 the original rewrite works, you just have to change it to:\n<Directory /var/www/>\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\nRewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}\n</Directory>\n\n", "Q: SSHFS to make remote external drive visible in Nautilus?

However, it seems that I'm not able to boot into any of the media I've tried. Here's what happens\nFrom 12.10 Live CD:\nGet past purple screen with the small man at the bottom. Then, black screen with blinking cursor. After about 15 seconds, the cursor stops blinking. No activity light on the DVD drive. I have to do a hard reset.\nFrom 14.04 USB and Boot-Repair USB:\nAfter selecting to boot from USB, I see the UnetBootin screen with various options.

I've tried nomodeset, same exact results.\nFrom USB devices:\nNot much, since I can't really do anything once it freezes.\nAll media work on my laptop to boot.\nAny advice on what to try next? Or why this is happening? I've got a 12.10 install on my HDD that I haven't booted into in quite some time. I've for windows 7 on my SSD (primary OS). I wanted to get back into Linux but this is giving me trouble :(\nSome additional info: I can boot to a Windows 7 recovery disc DVD, and (more importantly) I can boot to a linux-based OCZ SSD utility that is on a USB. \nSOLUTION: Here's how I ended up getting it to work: I have an Asrock Z77 Extreme4 mobo, which has both intel SATA ports and SATA ports run by an Asrock driver. The CD drive was plugged into the Asrock SATA ports, and this was causing some kind of hang because communication through that port is unsupported. I simply unplugged it from the Asrock port and into an Intel port and voila! All of my various USB memory sticks and the CD drive were able to boot, and I was able to boot into Boot-Repair to repair the bootloader of my Ubuntu 12.10 install.\n\nA: I'm not certain, but it seems likely your cd/dvd (optical) drive isn't working.  I recommend you borrow an external USB model from a friend, or even buy one.  They only cost about $16 these days.  I just looked this one up on amazon at that price which I purchased last year.  It works fine.  They can be very handy in service work, and if your internal optical drive has failed, this could save money over the cost of having the internal one replaced.\nPersonally I run into this problem so often I've made a self-booting boot-repair flashdrive, and I was pleased to find it actually boots faster than it would off of CD.  That could be an alternative for you, if you have access to a pc onto which you can download the ISO image of the boot media you wish to boot to and then use unetbootin to write that image to a usb flash drive.\n\nA: First please remake a bootable usb stick with unetbootin or imagewrite and try using another iso (ie the 32 bit version).\nIf that fails you can try using http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanagers.html as a boot manager (make a usb or a cd with it) to boot a usb from it? Also if the keyboard does not work inside the manager try:\n\n\n*\n\n*search you bios/cmos configuration for support for usb keyboards\n\n*using an old PS/2 keyboard.\n\n\nAlso what i believe is the cause of the usb not booting is that the utility you use is either out of date or that the uuid of the usb is not computed properly for some reason (this has happened to me some times). Lastly take care that you are not booting from usb3 as many motherboards even if they have onboard usb3, do not support booting from them\nBTW: you can set the nomodeset option by editing the various .cfg files in your usb with notepad\n\nA: Here's how I ended up getting it to work: gyropyge's comment about the CD drive not working gave me pause.

I have all the music stored in ~/Music and I want to delete all pop music (or it could be a different genre). \nI was thinking to look the song metadata to check and see if a song is pop, and then delete it. I'm just organizing the music collection, and it's not a problem if there are some false-positives.\nFor now, it's safe to assume that all the files are mp3 and have id3 tags.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Rhythmbox Music Player and import all your Music files. From the Rhythmbox menu select File -> Add Music -> Select a location containing music to add to your library (This should be set to your Music folder.) -> click the Import listed tracks button.  \n\n*Wait for a few minutes for Rhythmbox to import all the songs in your Music folder. How long it takes to import all the songs in your Music folder into Rhythmbox depends on how many songs there are in your Music folder.\n\n*In the Rhythmbox search box, search for a genre that you want to remove (for example, Pop). This will populate the big central pane in Rhythmbox with all the songs that have this metadata tag. Warning: This search will also populate the central pane with all of the songs that have metadata tags that contain the string pop, such as Pop/Rock and BritPop, as well as songs that have the string pop in their names! So you can't delete them all. You have to be selective and only delete the songs that have Pop as their genre in the Genre column.\n\n*Select all the songs that you want to delete from your ~/Music folder. This is the tricky part! In order to not delete songs that have the string pop in their names, which you don't want to do!!, you have to go down in the Genre column and individually remove only those songs which have Pop listed as the Genre in the Genre column of Rhythmbox. And don't delete the songs that have other metadata tags that contain the string pop, such as Pop/Rock and BritPop, in case you  want to keep these songs, and only delete the songs that have the Pop metadata tag.\n\n*Right-click on the song(s) that you selected for deletion, and from the popup context menu select Move to Trash.\n\n*That's it.

The usual method of adding your own CA certificate to Ubuntu is:\ncp cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates\nupdate-ca-certificates\n\nI'd like to distribute my CA certificate using a Debian package, but /usr/local/ is off-limits to packages (and lintian complains, and the Software Centre denounces my package as a low-quality one). So what's the standard method for doing so using Debian packaging? I tried peeking at ca-certificates-java, but I couldn't make much sense of what it is doing.\n\nA: It seems the_Seppi and bodhi.zazen are correct: the only clean way to do this is using a maintainer script to do the deed. From /usr/share/doc/ca-certificates/README.Debian:\nHow to install local CA certificates\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                              ...  If you want to prepare a local\npackage of your certificates, you should depend on ca-certificates,\ninstall the PEM files into /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ as above\nand call 'update-ca-certificates' in the package's postinst, and should\ncall 'update-ca-certificates --fresh' in the package's postrm.\n\nAn example source package for building a local CA certificate package,\nusing ca-certificates (>= 20130119) (since it uses triggers) can be\nfound in /usr/share/doc/ca-certificates/examples/ca-certificates-local/.\nThe README file in the above directory has step-by-step instructions for\nbuilding a local CA certificate package.\n\nThe example package has a Makefile which directly installs the file to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates. \nHowever, the Debian policy on installing files in /usr/local is to not do so at all (see section 1.2, chapter 9), either by directly or using a maintainer script.\nThe compromise that I find acceptable is to use the scripts, and place links instead of copying them. This way an end user can still trace where the stuff in /usr/local/ is coming from.\nInstead of calling update-ca-certificates with varying arguments, one should add update-ca-certificates-fresh to the triggers list (as noted in the last paragraph quoted above), allowing the certificates to be processed along with any other pending certificate updates:\necho 'activate update-ca-certificates-fresh' >> debian/package-name.triggers\n\n", "Q: Can I change the appearance of the bootloader, ..?

Probably has to do with it being an LVM volume.\nHow do I get it to let me read the files from my old installation of Ubuntu?\n$ sudo fdisk -l\nDisk /dev/sda: 223.6 GiB, 240057409536 bytes, 468862128 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0x7f79a18e\n\nDevice     Boot  Start       End   Sectors   Size Id Type\n/dev/sda1  *      2048    499711    497664   243M 83 Linux\n/dev/sda2       501758 468860927 468359170 223.3G  5 Extended\n/dev/sda5       501760 468860927 468359168 223.3G 8e Linux LVM\n\nDisk /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root: 215.6 GiB, 231479443456 bytes, 452108288 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-swap_1: 7.8 GiB, 8317304832 bytes, 16244736 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk /dev/sdb: 596.2 GiB, 640135028736 bytes, 1250263728 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0x0004f632\n\nDevice     Boot  Start        End    Sectors  Size Id Type\n/dev/sdb1  *      2048     499711     497664  243M 83 Linux\n/dev/sdb2       501758 1250263039 1249761282  596G  5 Extended\n/dev/sdb5       501760 1250263039 1249761280  596G 8e Linux LVM\n\n\nA: I had this issue and found a solution from this Ubuntu Forums Thread. I will give further details in case others have this issue and/or that link goes dead in the future.\nSystem Details\nRunning Ubuntu 16.04 on primary. I have 2 internal drives (SDA = Ubuntu 16.04 with Grub, SDB = Windows 10). I also had an internal SATA drive with Ubuntu 14.04 from a different machine which I decided to mount using an SATA-to-USB external dock, which subsequently placed this disk at SDC; I will refer to this drive as \"delta\" (view these with sudo lsblk or sudo fdisk -l, or optionally launch GUI \"Disks\" from Dash)\nIssues\nSimply looking in Nautilus (Files GUI) I can see a 255 MB Volume when the delta drive is connected, however this is the Partition 1 Master Boot Record (Linux Bootable; EXT2). Looking in Disks GUI it is clear I have an Extended Partition (partition2) of 1,000 GB and Partition5 which is 1,000 GB LVM2 Physical Volume, but no option to mount this partition. \nFix\n\n\n*\n\n*First run\n$ sudo vgscan\nReading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...\nFound volume group \"ubuntu-vg\" using metadata type lvm2\nFound volume group \"ubuntu-vg\" using metadata type lvm2\n\nThe issue with this output is that both my primary drive and this secondary \"delta\" drive are showing the same volume group name ubuntu-vg which causes some conflicts and makes it difficult to distinguish one from the next. So we need to change one of them.\n\n*Unplug the secondary (delta) drive. If it is internal you'll need to shutdown to do this, since I'm using a dock I just power it down.\n\n*After reboot, re-run: \n$ sudo vgscan\nReading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...\nFound volume group \"ubuntu-vg\" using metadata type lvm2\n\n\n*Run: \nsudo vgrename /dev/ubuntu-vg /dev/ubuntu-vg-primary\n\nChoose anything you want as the new name, I opted to append -primary here.\n\n*Now either shutdown and re-attach secondary and reboot, or just attach the drive if using an external dock as I am.\n\n*Again run: \n$ sudo vgscan\nReading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...\nFound volume group \"ubuntu-vg-primary\" using metadata type lvm2\nFound volume group \"ubuntu-vg\" using metadata type lvm2\n\nThis is what we want to see; two unique volume group names.\n\n*To activate our secondary (delta) drive volume group, run:\n$ sudo vgchange -ay ubuntu-vg\n2 logical volume(s) in volume group \"ubuntu-vg\" now active\n2 logical volume(s) in volume group \"ubuntu-vg-primary\" now active\n\n\n*Make a mount point if you haven't already, such as:\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/delta/  \n\n\n*Make the mount point owned by your user:\nsudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) /mnt/delta/  \n\nImportant Note:\nAt this point your system would either fail to reboot into Ubuntu, or it would attempt to load the version of Ubuntu corresponding to the \"secondary\" drive; At boot time the default/standard is to load from volume group identified as \"ubuntu-vg\". In order to handle this situation I went ahead and did the following:\n$ sudo vgscan  \n2 logical volume(s) in volume group \"ubuntu-vg\" now active\n2 logical volume(s) in volume group \"ubuntu-vg-primary\" now active\n$ sudo vgchange -ay ubuntu-vg\n$ sudo vgrename /dev/ubuntu-vg /dev/ubuntu-vg-secondary\n$ sudo vgscan\n2 logical volume(s) in volume group \"ubuntu-vg-secondary\" now active\n2 logical volume(s) in volume group \"ubuntu-vg-primary\" now active\n$ sudo vgchange -ay ubuntu-vg-primary\n$ sudo vgrename /dev/ubuntu-vg-primary /dev/ubuntu-vg\n$ sudo vgscan\n2 logical volume(s) in volume group \"ubuntu-vg-secondary\" now active\n2 logical volume(s) in volume group \"ubuntu-vg\" now active\n\nFinally we can mount with:  \nsudo mount /dev/ubuntu-vg-secondary/root /mnt/delta/\n\nAt this point you can navigate in Nautilus to \"Computer\" then /mnt/delta/ and view the root of your external drive. You can quickly add a bookmark to this location so that you can easily access it. You could proceed (cautiously) to backup your existing /etc/fstab (to /etc/fstab.bak) and modify the existing fstab to attempt to auto-mount this device/location to the mount point. Make sure to test your fstab before shutting-down or rebooting.\nUsing sudo blkid I was able to find all of the relevant UUIDs, devices, partitions, volume group info, as well as FS Types, and use this information to add a mount entry directive to my fstab. For example:  \nUUID=d7556cd2-67b3-4fb4-acc8-1e33dd0eb040       /mnt/delta      ext4    defaults        0       2\n\nTest using sudo mount -a (no output means good; any output can mean there are errors which should be dealt with before attempting to reboot else you may not be able to reboot back to your OS properly).\n\nA: You have to mount the LVM partition. It can be confusing if the physical volumes and/or logical volumes have the same name ...\nScan your system for LVM volumes and identify in the output the volume \nsudo vgscan\n\nyou will see something like \n\nFound volume group \"fedora\" using metadata type lvm2\n\nYou should see two volume groups\nactivate the (old) volumegroup\nsudo vgchange -ay fedora\n\nchange \"fedora\" to your volume group ;)\nFind the logical volume / partition that has your old ubuntu install\nsudo lvs\n\nor\nsudo lvdisplay\n\nor\nls /dev/fedora\n\nagain, change fedora to your volume group name\nMount the logical volumes\nsudo mount /dev/fedora/home /mnt\n\nand on ....\nThere is only one graphical too I know of, system-config-lvm\nsudo apt-get install system-config-lvm\nsudo system-config-lvm\n\n\nA: There are lots of ways to copy over your data, even if your data folders are encrypted.  All you have to do is boot the old drive and copy the data you want to copy onto external media and back to the new media. You could also try using the included \"backup\" utility which works very well in my experience.\nHaving said all of that, had you asked me before you did the upgrade I've have offered you entirely different advice.  I'd have pointed out that 14.04 is an LTS version and that upgrading to 14.10 merely commits you to upgrading every six months, which I find bothersome.\nI would have advised you to download clonezilla and merely clone your old hard drive to the new media, directly, and continue using the installation you already have with no need to start over.  Of course you can still do that, but by now you might have made up  your mind to stick with the new installation.\n\nA: You can probably do this UI with KVPM.\nSelect the group you want to mount and click the \"mount fs\" option.\n\nYou an also rename it from there if needed.\n", "Q: Cannot add/edit/remove Startup Applications; Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity New to Ubuntu/Linux. In Startup Applications, changes are not saved; as soon as I close Startup Applications, settings revert to default. I've searched for answers (and tons of other questions on this site) but have yet to find a solution. Tried adding symbolic links to /etc/xdg/autostart, but it hasn't helped (though the symlinks did save there). \nSpecifically, I want a desktop slideshow app to start automatically. Using applications GUI's to add to autostart also has not worked. I've tried Wallch, Variety, and Slidewall. Wallch and Slidewall GUI's showed that the programs were set to start with login, but they did not (I also made sure not to run them simultaneously to prevent conflict). The setting kept in the GUI, but it had no effect. When I enable that setting on Variety, the app crashes.\nFound another question here that recommended using gnome-session-properties via terminal to edit it instead of launching Startup Apps from Dash, but this is was also ineffective. Terminal provided the following:\n** (gnome-session-properties:2319): WARNING **: Could not save /home/jordan/.config/autostart/variety.desktop file\nLogging out/restarting also had no effect.\nI have also tried adding other apps to startup just to see if the problem was the apps I was using; all attempts have been equally unsuccessful.\n\nA: I figured it out with the help of a number of random threads/questions around this site and the web with different but related issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the following in the terminal (without quotes, and with your username):\nsudo chown \"yourusername\":\"yourusername\" -R ~/.config\n\nUse of sudo will prompt you for your password. Enter it (the terminal won't show anything while you do), then press Enter. Doing this grants permission to edit the ~/.config directory. \n\n*Enter the following in the terminal: \nsudo rm -r ~/.config/autostart\n\nDoing this first grants permission to, then removes the contents of the directory. Initially I tried running without sudo, but I was denied access and told Directory not empty.\n\n*Enter the following in the terminal: \nrmdir -r ~/.config/autostart\n\nDoing this removes the directory. If access is denied, try adding sudo before the command as in the previous steps.\n\n*Enter the following in the terminal: \nmkdir ~/.config/autostart\n\nDoing this recreates the directory you just deleted, only now you should have full permission over it. If access is denied, try adding sudo before the command as in the previous steps.\n\n*Use Startup Applications (in the Dash) or gnome-session-properties (in the terminal) to add an application to the startup applications.\nFeel free to comment and correct me if I'm mistaken about anything. This is my (EXTREMELY LIMITED) understanding of what is accomplished by this process. Following these steps, I have had no problems adding/editing/removing applications using Startup Applications via the Dash or gnome-session-properties from the terminal. I have logged out and restarted, and the settings hold.\n\nA: The follwing command will be able to help you: (press Ctrl+Alt+T first)  :)\ngksudo  gnome-session-properties\n\nusing this method, the gnome session properties will appear normally.\nAfter your edit, it will now save your edits.\n", "Q: Nautilus context menu for current directory when there's lots of files / \"Open in Terminal\" I want to be able to \"open in terminal\" from any directory.\nI have the nautilus-open-terminal package installed\nI'm not sure what the problem is exactly: when there's only a couple of items in a directory I can just right-click in the empty space, see the context menu, and click \"Open in Terminal\".\nBut if there's enough items to create a scroll bar there's nowhere to right click for the current directory.\nIf I right click on the breadcrumbs I don't see \"open in terminal\".

I am attempting to follow the instructions here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation (1)\nI am using the PC (Intel x86) desktop CD iso which I burned to a flash drive using the instructions here: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20install%20Ubuntu%20on%20MacBook%20using%20USB%20Stick (2)\nI then proceeded to restart my mac, boot from the USB, start up Ubuntu, partitioned the drive using Gparted and install Ubuntu on my computer. I am confident the installation was complete. Afterwards, I was not able to restart the computer and was forced to do a hard reset. \nThe instructions say to restart your computer and fix a partitioning bug using rEFIt (which I have installed) As expected from (1), rEFIt gives me the error message \"GPT partition of type 'Unknown' found, will not touch this disk\" when I try to run the partitioning tool. I see that I need to install gptsync_0.13-10 but now when I try to boot from the USB, Ubuntu stalls for at least 20 mins at a blank screen with only a small white cursor in the upper left hand corner. I tried formatting my USB and re-burning the image to it, but have not been able to boot from the USB since.\nAny suggestions or tips? Is my best bet just formatting everything and trying to reinstall again?\n\nA: rEFIt is no longer maintained. It is a better idea to use rEFInd instead. Also, why don't you try to install Ubuntu 14.04? It is also an LTS release and has many kernel improvements.\nThere are two ways of installing Ubuntu on a Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Legacy Boot - Use the Mac variant of Ubuntu which you can download from here.\n\n\nInstall rEFInd before you install Ubuntu. Now, create a partition for Ubuntu using either Disk Utility or GParted and install normally. When you reboot after the installation finishes, rEFInd will load and give you an option to select either OS X or Ubuntu.\nThis is the easier method and is convenient if you are dual booting.\n\n\n*EFI Boot - Use the normal variant of Ubuntu.\n\n\nThis method is slightly tough because you will have to delete the grub partition created by the Ubuntu installer (on a FAT partition) and install grub on an HFS partition, failing which your mac will not boot. However, this method works better if you want to completely replace OS X with Ubuntu.  \nRefer to this post for steps to the EFI Boot method.\n\nA: As the guy who boots ALL of his computers to external flash media, I'd like to point out that making external media boot a mac is significantly easier than installing Ubuntu to the mac, and significantly less risky.  This is not to say that I will never aspire to have three or even four operating systems on a mac, if only for geek points, but when it comes to safety, it's generally a bad idea to put all of your eggs in one basket.\nThat said, the last time I booted my mac to Ubuntu flash media I used a refind cd and the time before that I used refit.  It has been on my todo list for some time now to install refind to a clone stick to see if it works with the mac and if it interferes with booting other computers.\n", "Q: multiple file rename based on modification date I have looked on the web on multiple sites but I can't seem to find a solution and the man page is not clear (I'm a beginner with the CLI).

As soon as you select a window manager it will be replaced and MATE Tweak will close.\nYou can check which window manager you are using by running the following in a terminal.\nwmctrl -m\nFor more information read this\nThis can be tricky, so I recommend you try these steps on a VM before doing on your actual system.\n\nA: 16.04 and 16.10 MATE you can do this: \nsystem > preferences > personal > onboard settings\nthen click window from the left side menu\nThen uncheck dock to edge of screen\nYou may want to figure out how to get Ubuntu to remember per application window preferences - that's next on my list, so every window opens in the same place, every time until I change it, that'd be great. \n\nA: I know this only from Unity but there must be a way to enable corner snapping in MATE.\n\n*\n\n*Enable Corner Snapping.\nTop and bottom screen scaling do not work in a half-screen snap.\n\n\n*Grab window and throw it in a corner\nBy dragging the window by its menu you can enlarge it to a quarter of the screen. Very useful in many cases.\n\n\n*Enlarge the window as much as needed, horizontally AND vertically!\nIf you want to cover two thirds of the screen, go for it. If you want to fit that sheet of paper in true size, go for it. Fit the window to your preferred size and shape, and enjoy.\n\n\n*Optional: Grab it again and bring it down a bit\nIf you don't want your window to sit in the corner, grab it and bring it down. It will retain the size and shape you just made. The window should snap to the side of the screen so you don't have to be too finnicky.\nSadly, this is Unity I'm talking about. But I hope this helps your workflow.\n", "Q: Hard disk decryption, forgotten key I am using ubuntu14.04. During installation, I encrypted my hard disk. Now, I forgot my key and I have a lot of important data on my system that I want to recover. Is there a way to change my pass-phrase or remove it or may be any other way to backup my data.\n\nA: If you do not have the original key that you used to encrypt the data, you are not going to be able to decrypt the data and recover  o.\nThe whole idea of disk encryption is that if you don't have the key, you can't just easily 'recover the data' from the disk or partition. If there were such a way to easily access the data, it would defeat the point of disk encryption, which is to prevent others who do not have the key from easily decrypting the data.\nUnfortunately, that concept has a flaw: if you were the one that set up the key, and forgot the key, you no longer have a way to access the data.  That key is required to decrypt the data, and without it there is no way to decrypt the data to recover it.\n", "Q: how to list autostart application or services in ubuntu server I have an ubuntu server and i need to know a list services and application that autostart in ubuntu server, is there a way to do this ? \ntill today I do it manually by checking in htop after I restarted the server and take note application that is starting, I know this seems dumb, I hope there is a better way to do this. \n\nA: You can use the initctl list command to list the contents of /etc/init.\n", "Q: Installed Office 2007 in Wine, How to Run Them? I installed Office 2007 using Wine1.6 on Ubuntu 14.04. Seemed to go fine but I can't find the Office executables to get them to run. I would also like to add the shortcuts to the toolbar or desktop\n\nA: Microsoft Office 2007 typically installs to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office on Windows 64-bit.  We can kind of assume that this will apply in the case of Wine as well, but we need to change C:\\ to a Linux file path.\nThe default wine prefix, and the drive_c directory, ends up in your user profile data, such that wine's C: drive is in /home/$USER/.wine/drive_c.\nTry searching in /home/$USER/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Office as a starting point.  Keep in mind that you should probably put that entire string in single quotes, like so:  cd '/home/$USER/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Office'\nWithin that directory, you should find some kind of OFFICE## directory in there.  If I remember correctly, Office 2007 is OFFICE12.  The binaries should be within that folder (/home/$USER/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Office/OFFICE12/).  You will need to know the actual executable names to run with the wine command, or you can double click the .exe (winword.exe for example is Word).\n\nA: The easiest way to install MSO on Linux is with PlayOnLinux. You just choose Microsoft Office from a list, point it to the installer file, and then click through the installer using default values. After that, shortcuts will be installed for Word,  Excel etc. \n", "Q: Why has my audio suddenly stopped working in 14.04? I just installed Ubuntu today.

When you ask if it is better to put Ubuntu \"in flash drive(usb3 for max speed) and run the \"try ubuntu\" whenever I want?\", you are discussing doing something very similar to what I do every day, except that my flash drives actually contain complete installations that you can write to, which an image of a live cd on flash would not do.\nI can answer that two different ways, both \"yes\".  yes it is better, which is why I do it.  My portable complete installation is better because I can boot my personal OS anywhere there is a pc, whether it belongs to me or someone else who trusts me.  It is versatile.  Even an image of a CD-rom is versatile, though annoying that you can't write to it or install new software.\nIf you intend to make an installation to a flash drive as I have done, you must do so on a computer in which you have temporarily disabled the hard drive.  If you do not, the internal windows hard drive will be essentially corrupted by the installation of the grubloader and suddenly that computer will become unable to even boot to windows unless the flash drive is inserted.\nSo, to recap my original solution revealed through comment discussion.  My advice was to reinstall Ubuntu but this time connected to the internet so that Ubuntu is better able to install properly.  I also suggested using the live-cd to check the hard drive for errors before even proceeding to install to it again.\n(comments are automatically deleted after a time.  These \"answers\", which may benefit others, are retained indefinitely.)\nPS:  about running from flash drives.  Most so-called usb3 flash drives are just as slow as usb2 because the chips are slow.  Patriot makes fast and slow units and the more expensive ones have little raids inside and go very fast.  That's what I use for units I make for my friends.  For myself I use something still faster and more expensive, combining an mSATA card case to usb3 adapter and then whatever size of mSATA solid state drive I choose to use.  I have two currently one is 64g and the other is 128g.\nThe case.  The drive.\nOne more thing.  This is going to sound crackers, but after investing in these supposed usb3 drives I found that computers with usb3 ports don't play well with them so now I use them only with usb2 ports.  They aren't remotely slow though, and faster than the patriots I mentioned.\n", "Q: How to access openstack instances from the outside world? We've created a few instances on our MAAS+Juju+Openstack cloud. All these instances have been assigned private IPs but can access the internet via NAT. Only our MAAS cluster controller node has a public IP. Now how should we access these instances from the outside world?. Should we assign separate unique public IP address to each of these instances or is it possible to access them all without public IPs via NAT?\nI understand there is a concept of associating a floating IP to an instance from a pool of IPs.

Is there any proper method to avoid the only file from syncing?\n\nA: The --exclude filter works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the pattern does not start with a slash, then it matches at the end of the path, anywhere in the tree.\n--exclude myfile.txt matches any file called myfile.txt in any directory.\n--exclude logs/myfile.txt matches myfile.txt inside any directory called logs.\n\n*If the pattern begins with a slash, it is anchored to the root of the transferred files.\nTo determine what the root of the transferred files is, remove everything after the last slash in the source path.\nFor example, in the following rsync command, the source path is /srv/files/something and so the root of the transfer is /srv/files/.\nrsync -a /srv/files/something host:/backup/files/\n\nSo, to exclude source file /srv/files/logs/myfile.txt you would use --exclude /logs/myfile.txt, where that slash at the start of the exclude pattern refers to the root of the transfer, which is rooted at /srv/files/ (on the source).\n\nA: rsync uses directories relative to the root rsync folder.

I've applied this method but, sorry, haven't tested it thoroughly yet.\n\n*a hard and violent workaround: just disable USB 3.0 mode in the BIOS settings - disable the xHCI interface, which is essential to USB 3.0. It helps... Although slows down the USB...\n\n", "Q: How do I download wine on 12.04 can someone please tell me how to download wine so that I can open exe. files.\nMany Thanks,\nDave.\n\nA: You can use the below command to install the wine via terminal.\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\n\nA: Install using sudo apt-get install wine\nThe website is at https://www.winehq.org/ with more information and hints on how to get individual windows programs working correctly under wine.\n", "Q: Flash Plugins required I have recently upgraded OS to 14.10 from 14.04.

What is the best way (options, those numbers on the end) to mount a /tmp partition in /etc/fstab in terms of security and speed on a desktop (laptop) computer (read: not server)?\nI've heard about nosuid, nodev and noexec, but I have no idea what they do, how to use them or even if I should used them.\nI'm using LVM btw.\n\nA: The default is just a directory in the root filesystem.\nThat's fine but I have a desktop, a ton of RAM and reboot very infrequently... Which is the perfect description of somebody who could be using RAM instead of SSD for caching temporary stuff... So mine is mounted as a tmpfs RAMdisk, defined in fstab as:\ntmpfs    /tmp    tmpfs    defaults,noatime,mode=1777   0  0\n\nIf you power cycle lots, this obviously isn't going to be a good idea for you.\nYou asked on another —now deleted— answer what the two zeroes were on the end, that's handled by another answer but they basically mean the system doesn't care about what happens to this filesystem if things crash. It won't dump out or check it for errors on boot.\nnoatime is just there as a tiny performance thing. Nothing I know of needs to audit access times of /tmp so I don't bother storing them. There's nothing inherently dangerous about allowing SUID, exec or character devices in /tmp and some things might need them. \nIn terms of security, while anything can write into /tmp it doesn't mean anything can overwrite or even read existing files. If you have a go-rw permission file, other people won't be able to mess around with it. The various systems that write into /tmp already do things to make sure that they're not clashing over filenames (typically by appending the $USER variable to the filename).\n\nA: I am not sure, but it looks like in modern Ubuntu versions, editing /etc/fstab doesn't work anymore for /tmp. Now it seems to be managed by systemd, so to edit its options you should edit the /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount file. You could do that with sudo systemctl edit tmp.mount --full. Options are given in the Options line, like Options=mode=1777,relatime,nodev,nosuid,noexec.\n", "Q: Create Yosemite usb/dvd installer on ubuntu I just installed Ubuntu on my Macbook and I did a mistake while installing so my hard drive is formatted.

I want to use nVidia for sessions when I play games and Intel for everything else. Therefore I installed nVidia drivers (tried several times, binnary from nVidia site and from Ubuntu repo but never from PPA). \nLightdm never manage to display login screen when nVidia is selected (using primus or nVidia prime indicator applet). Screen is black, no mouse arrow and system does not freeze, I can hear drum startup sound and I can switch to console by pressing ctrl+alt+f1 and logon successfully (I use this to switch back to intel).\nI checked for brightness setup, changed them both to max and it didn't help (it affect brightness in terminal). Connecting external TV on HDMI also didnt help (same picture on both diplays: when works using intel and when it does not work using nvidia). in BIOS I have no options related to GPUs...\nI'm under impression that issue is not with driver - but on lightdm side or x side - like they cannot pick the right connector to send picture to display...\nBoth next commands works, but I can only see black display when switching to nvidia\nsudo prime-switch nvidia\nsudo prime-switch intel\n\nAny help is appreciated?\nI already tried everything else from web but it dint helped My laptop never freezes and because of that I think the issue is not the same...\n\nA: I know from bitter experience that at any given time there are several nvidia drivers available and each one has its own pros and cons.  I learned that after I \"upgraded\" to a later version only to spend hours putting it back the way I had it the first time.\nI admit I'm not clear about your wishing to switch it off.  I think what you need is the nvidia control panel so you can turn it on and off on the fly.\nI used to have that on one of my computers.  To get it I would advise you to go into the \"Synaptic Package Manager\" and there type, \"nvidia control\".  You will get several results most of which I suspect you'll be interested in.\nPS:  If you don't already have the \"Synaptic Package Manager\" installed you can install it from the the Ubuntu Software Center\"\n", "Q: Grep for specfic number format I have a Unix script, which within has release numbers which are like this (2.19.0.32) Look like IP's but are not as some are like this 2.23.0.06.DBP.\nI've tried variations of this but comes back empty.\negrep \"^[0-9]\\.[0-9]\\.[0-9]\\.[0-9]\\.[DBP]$\" TEST.LOG\n\n\nA: You can use this simple command:\ngrep -E '^[0-9.]+\\.DBP' TEST.LOG\n\nIf you want your just change your command to this:\ngrep -E '^[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.DBP' TEST.LOG\n\n+ means: Matches the one or more occurrences of numbers.\n", "Q: How to read memory usage?

I installed it from my usb and everything went fine. Ubuntu was on my comp and I stupidly spent a few hours personalizing it and installing my favorite programs. Then I restarted the comp. Now, the only way Ubuntu will boot is if the usb is in. Not only that but it goes right back to the bare bones Ubuntu and not my personalized version. Before it boots the same black screen comes up and asks if I want to try Ubuntu or install it and I have to hit either one just to get into the system. If the usb is not in the comp then nothing boots up. Ubuntu should already be installed onto my comp. How do I switch the OS from on the usb to permanently on my hard drive? It is not an issue with boot order. I have already played around and changed order up a few times. \n\nA: Some systems shipping with Windows 8 have trouble booting Ubuntu the way it is currently implemented for UEFI machines.\nYou could try booting the live USB again and follow my instructions from this Q&A:\nUEFI machine doesn't boot Ubuntu through NVRAM bootcatalog.

I was using Windows 7 & Windows 8 [Not-Activated]. Then I thought to use Ubuntu only, and to just un-install both the OSs from this laptop. I tried installing Ubuntu, but in result it formatted my whole Hard Drive, deleted all 4 partitions, and made a Single Partition. So did I lost all my personal stuff as well. Now, after a bit of hard work, I restored and recovered my partitions and data back in state. Now, I have a 100GB FREE partition at \"C\", rest D, E & F are fully occupied with my personal stuff. Now, I have a Bootable USB ready with me with Ubuntu 14 and looking to Install this on C only, without affecting my personal stuff. please guide me through the way for it. Om installation pane I see two options, Erase Disk & Something Else. After moving onto Something Else, I am confused to select the options from partitioning table. Please guide me through.\n\nA: I'm not certain as to what you are asking, but dual booting Windows and Ubuntu, as well as just having Ubuntu as your single OS, is very doable.\nHere is an in-depth guide on how to install Ubuntu 14.04. \nYou can initially try Ubuntu by running it off a CD/USB key. Clicking \"Install Ubuntu 14.04\" will guide through through the process. You will hit an \"Installation Type\" screen as seen below. \n\nIf you plan on Ubuntu as your only operating system, you should go ahead and click \"Replace Windows X with Ubuntu\". \nIf you want to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, I suggest clicking \"Something Else\", which will allow you to properly partition your hard drive. Both Windows and Ubuntu should be in separate partitions. You can resize the partitions however you like, as long as they are sufficiently large. \n", "Q: Run a standard command in bash script I am writing a bash script to automate several actions:\n#!/bin/bash         \n\necho \"Hello, World\"\nNAME=\"${1}\"\nPATH=\"${2}\"\necho $NAME\necho $PATH\neval \"ls\"\n\nI am going to call ls, ffmpeg and a lot of other commands.\nHowever running my script gives me the following error:\n/var/www/html# ./life.sh test midhand.mp4\n+ ./life.sh test midhand.mp4\nHello, World\ntest\nmidhand.mp4\n./life.sh: line 9: ls: command not found\n\nHow come? why not found? Maybe I should import a directory with scripts?\n\nA: The variable PATH is a special shell variable. It defines the list of directories in which executables/commands can be found.\nIn the line PATH=\"${2}\", you wipe out the default value of PATH and now the shell doesn't know where to find the ls command. For example, ls can be found in the directory /bin, but you modified PATH to have the value midhand.mp4 (the second argument), in particular PATH does not contain /bin and thus your shell cannot find the ls command.\nTry this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Hello, World\"\nthe_name=\"${1}\"\nthe_path=\"${2}\"\n\necho \"PATH is '$PATH'\"\necho $the_name\necho $the_path\neval \"ls\"\n\nNote. You can change the last line from eval \"ls\" to just ls.\nYou can run man bash to get further information.\n\nA: You are getting this error message because you have changed the PATH environment variable to a command line argument (${2}) which dose not hold the actual binary.\n", "Q: Why can't my laptop use more than 85% of my RAM? I have 1GB RAM in my notebook (HP Compaq 6735s), but the video card is using 256MB, so I'm left with 768MB RAM.\nHowever, whenever my system starts using more than 85% of memory, it becomes unusable. It literally stops. With a swapfile it slowly wakes up, once it has freed enough RAM, but without it, my system freezes.\nIs this caused by system misconfiguration or is it normal behaviour?\nThanks.\n\nA: Is such behavior normal or not depends on how it freezes: if it's freezes due to failure of one of the services or kernel — this is a bug, but if it's freezes only for limited time (like 20 minutes, until some processes will get into swap, and other get out of swap) — this is expected behavior.\nI don't think usual Ubuntu distributive can be normally run on such hardware (although Canonical claim, that it will run on 768 MB of RAM). I recommend one or more of following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu distributive designed for low-end systems, e.g. Lubuntu.\n\n*Use lightweight desktop environment, like LXDE (it is preinstalled in Lubuntu, but you can also install it in usual Ubuntu).\n\n*Configure zRam. All you need is to install zram-config package and reboot.\n\n*Upgrade your system: SSD drive will give you notebook new life. 1 GB more of RAM would great too.\n\nA: It is normal this to happen, because when the RAM usage gets higher than the RAM itself, the system starts to swap to disk, which makes the system very slow, and in your case unusable.\nIf you want to run Ubuntu smoothly, think about upgrading your PC to atleast 2GB of RAM.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server drop ping for specified interface I am searching for a possibility to drop the ping packets for my ppp0 interface, but allow them for eth0.\nI use ufw know that i can reject ping by changing lines in /etc/ufw/before.rules\nBut thats for all interfaces, i just want it to drop for ppp0. \nHow can i do this?\n\nA: Why not use iptables?

On Ubuntu, you may follow the instructions on this answer. You may need to clear your DNS cache from Ubuntu to make sure all DNS query are executed again, thus creating a new cache without the blocked websites. This will not prevent the access to the website itself, but it'll make impossible for your browser to translate www.exemple.com into 67.23.11.1, for instance.\nYou may apply those rules on your router to further improve the block.\n\nA: I read the dupe answer link but it didn't mention the free account at Opendns.org. Free personal account.\nBy pointing your DNS at their DNS servers, you can block categories of websites, individual websites as you find them, log attempts to get to blocked websites, etc. \n\nWhen you set up OpenDNS Home on your router, your settings take effect\n  across everything on your home network. In addition to computers, this\n  includes your kids’ Xbox, Playstation, Wii, DS, iPad, and even their\n  iPhone.\n\n", "Q: How can I make a desktop wallpaper slideshow with my own images?

Here is the excerpt from the Readme.\n\n\n*\n\n*About printing from 64-bit version Ubuntu\nBecause a common module is installed with 64-bit Ubuntu, a 64-bit version\nlibglade2 library is required.\nYou can install the libglade2 library by executing the following command.\n# apt-get install libglade2\n\n\n*In a 64-bit Ubuntu environment, all the 32-bit libraries required for\nprinting are not installed. As a result, printing will fail if 32-bit\nlibraries are not installed.\nBefore printing, it is required that you execute the following commands to\ninstall a 32-bit library package.\n# apt-get install ia32-libs\n# apt-get install libpopt0:i386\n\n", "Q: installing software package for any user account and root user Suppose I've two users in my system viz. USER1 and USER2.\nWhen I need to install any package for any user say USER1, I need to do \"sudo su\" which means root privilege. But is this software installed only for the USER1, though I've done \"sudo su\"? Why is it so? \nHow to install any package in a system that can be accessible to every user in the machine?\n\nA: Programs installed from the Software Center or apt-get should be installed globally (system wide) and will be available to all users.\nThis is because they are not installed in a particular user's home folder but in the usr folder.\nEach user will have their own file in their account to save there preferences and data except any user logged in as a guest, as their data is deleted on logging out.\n.sh and .bin files that install without root will only be available by the user that installed it unless the folder that it is installed in is made available to all users via the sharing options via the mouse right click or the command line chmod.  This is because programs that install without root only install into the home directory of the user that installed them.\nsource\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu 14.04 installed? I've been trying to dual boot Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8, on my HP Pavillion g6-2320.\nThe installation got complete the first time, but Windows got booted. I tried installing again, but got errors,\n\ngrub-efi amd64-signed failed to install into /target/\ngrub-install /dev/sda failed\n\nduring different combinations of enabling/disabling Secure Boot/ Legacy Mode\nI installed reFind Bootloader but still it didn't work.\nNow I used BootRepair, and I got reFind , with options for Windows and Ubuntu. But after using Windows once, now Windows gets booted by default - no reFind. I can still access reFind from BootOptions but now both its options load Windows 8. I can access Ubuntu by choosing the option from BootOptions. How to display grub/reFind screen on system startup ?\nBut in all cases where I'm accessing Ubuntu, the option \"install release\" is present. So is Ubuntu really installed in my system ?\n\nI'm okay even with a solution requiring a reinstall of Ubuntu if other methods are hard. But do give me any advice on partitioning or Legacy/Secure boot, which would help me install Ubuntu without using bootrepair.\nThanks\n\nA: You will have to create a 'boot' partition while installing Ubuntu so that grub may be installed in it. Otherwise, although Ubuntu may be installed, you will not be able to boot into it.\nFor instructions, refer to this page.\n", "Q: Booting from Ubuntu install disk My dilemma continues.  I had copied the latest Ubuntu download to DVD.  Reason being, I don't have enough space on my dual partition drive so need to start fresh.  From Ubuntu I did a restart with that DVD in the optical drive expecting it would start the process.  It just by-passed the DVD and went right to my dual boot menu and then into Ubuntu as it currently exists on my drive.  Do I need to do a shut down for this DVD to start the formating and new install?\n\nA: Also you can try to boot from a USB stick using this http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ \nSometimes it requires to download a couple of times the ISO to burn it without any faults.\n", "Q: How to properly install Ubuntu on my new PC I got a new lenovo PC pre installed with windows 8.1 and I'm having trouble installing Ubuntu.

Writing this from the live ubuntu dvd. I will try to provide as much description as possible, because I am hoping that this can somehow be solved. I am new to ubuntu, so try to be gentle.\nWHAT I DID\nAfter installing ubuntu 14.04 on my pc, I was using the open source generic drivers for my ATI HD6570. Then after I while wanted a bigger resolution so I installed fglrx proprietary ATI drivers using the System Settings>Software Updates>Additional Drivers(strictly in that way with not using of terminal or anything)\nThat worked with a flaw, the flaw being a memory leak that grows days slowly until you need to restart pc. Eventually, I wanted to attempt ATI catalyst 14.9 for my GPU (downloaded it from official site) because apparently it lessens the issue. This is where I probably screwed something up. Tried to remove old fglrx drivers through terminal had partial success and I continue to install Ati catalyst using the built/in installer of AMD.\nRESULT\nWhen I boot ubuntu it comes to the desktop with only the generic background screen, no icons, no unity tab, no upper tab and nothing else besides background and cursor.\nPlease tell me if this is solvable or should I go and install ubuntu again from the scratch for the third time... sad face\n\nA: Press ctrl+alt+F1 to enter tty1 console and login.\nRun the following commands\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx-amdcccle fglrx-dev\nsudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-radeon\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\nsudo rm -rf /etc/ati\n", "Q: Nautilus-Actions Configuration Tool -- Archive Manager -- Show a specific option in selected cases I have managed to make a new entry to Nautilus right click menu in order to extract a compressed file to a specified folder.

I'll try to explain why below.\nThere are two types of compression, lossless and lossy.  In lossless compression no information is lost and so the original data can be reconstructed perfectly from the compressed version.  In lossy compression, some information is lost, and so the original data cannot be reconstructed perfectly from the compressed version.  In this case, the reconstructed version is an approximation of the original, but the file size will be smaller than would ever be possible with a lossless algorithm.\nLossy compression is commonly used for media such as JPG (images), MP3 (audio), and MP4 (video).  Using lossy compression results in much, much smaller files because we can get rid of data such that the human eye or ear doesn't notice its absence. This is actually pretty interesting, and usually involves a frequency transformation such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), but that's beyond the scope of this question.\nIn the case of generic data compression, when you might be compressing text files or executables, as far as I am aware lossy compression is NEVER used.  If you compressed a text file in a lossy manner, you would lose some information, and thus you would forever lose some of the text.  If you compressed an executable file in a lossy manner, it would not work the same way (if at all) after you uncompressed it.\nTaking it a step further, let's say you have an MP3 file.  The audio inside has already undergone lossy compression.  However, the MP3 file itself is organized in a very specific manner so that audio players understand how to play its data.  If you were to lossy compress an MP3 file, you would lose information, the organization would be destroyed, and in all likelihood it would be unplayable.\n", "Q: Problems installing mysql on Ubuntu 14.04 I hit the following error shortly on entering the mysql \"root\" password:\nAn error occurred while setting the password for the MySQL administrative user. \nThis may have happened because the account already has a password, or because of a\ncommunication problem with the MySQL server.\n\nHere is the full output of apt-get install mysql-server:\nReading package lists...

This is the same for MariaDB or MySQL. So...here is the solution:\nI did all the same as you:\nsudo aptitude purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo aptitude autoclean\nsudo deluser mysql\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql\nsudo rm -rf /etc/mysql\n\nAnd from now, I did this based on answers of dpkg issues. I don't know if this is the safest but well, it worked:\ncd /var/lib/dpkg/info/\nsudo rm -rf mysql*\n\nAnd that was all, I installed again and it worked. I hope this is useful for someone.\n\nA: From your question it seems you have used the command \nsudo rm -rf /ver/lib/mysql instead of sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql\nMake sure my.cnf was removed from the location /etc/my.cnf.\nsudo rm /etc/my.cnf\n\nsudo apt-get remove mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common\n\nOnce it is done, try reinstalling mysql server again.\n", "Q: Access a local repository I'm trying to access a local repository which happens to be a mirror of the Ubuntu 14.04 trusty release.

Input / Output errors typically point at failing disks or bad hardware.  Those errors can result in the kind of \"No OS Found\" messages you were seeing, as well.\nIf the issue is hardware in nature, and the hardware is dying or faulty or failing, there's no real way to fix that except to replace the hard drive. Given that you were having irreparable issues in Windows 8.1, it looks like hardware failure might be the issue.\nI'd suggest taking your computer to a technician for testing and diagnosis of hardware issues, or reach out to the manufacturer of the computer, because it sounds like a dying disk if Windows was also giving you errors and such.\n", "Q: create a .tar file of all latest files in the directories I am in a directory A.

Somehow something doesn't work out for my setup.\nWhat I have: A computer, a laptop, a router. I want following:\nComputer <-- eth0 --> laptop=DHCP-Server <-- wifi --> router.\nWhy? If this works, I can connect another device instead of the computer to the laptop's eth0 and analyze its network traffic. But I can easily use the computer to check if this works first.\nWhat did I do until now: Basically everthing I could find :D\nThe laptop is running Linux Mint 17, which uses a NetworkManager, which automatically starts some kind of dnsmasq. I disabled this, by editing /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf to look like this:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\n#dns=dnsmasq\n\nno-auto-default=54:42:49:70:E5:8E,\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nUsing sudo apt-get install dnsmasq I installed dnsmasq and edited the /etc/dnsmasq.conf to look like this:\ninterface=eth0\ndhcp-range=192.168.2.210,192.168.2.230,255.255.255.0,12h\ndhcp-option=3,192.168.2.1\nlog-dhcp\n\nMy thoughts here: Router's IP is 192.168.2.1 and it's giving out IPs from 192.168.2.100 to 192.168.2.199. So the laptop can give out IPs from 192.168.2.210 to 192.168.2.230.\nWhen connecting the computer to the laptop's eth0 the computer tries to connect, but fails. \nSo i checked the laptop's tcpdump and could see lines like that:\n22:29:21.141599 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc > 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 6c:f0:49:0a:25:61 (oui Unknown), length 300\n\nwhich shows that the computer is sending out a broadcast DHCP request, right?\nBut I don't see any answer to that request. Same in Wireshark: DHCP requests/discovers from computer, but no answers.\nIn between I also tried to do some NAT masquerading in iptables and IP forwarding. If necessary I can remove that again.\nWhen assigning a static IP for eth0 on the computer, it connects, but cannot connect to any website (I setup this connection in NetworkManager using IP 192.168.2.75, 255.255.255.0, Gateway: 192.168.2.1 and even DNS Server: 8.8.8.8).\nAny help is appreciated! Thx \n\nA: In the end the solution was to use the NetworkManager GUI to share the eth0 interface to other computers.\nedit: I did everything stated in my initial post, and then the solution was to startup the network manager and to change the ethernet connection to \"Shared to other computers\". You can do this by doubleclicking the ethernet connection, select tab \"IPv4 Settings\" and then change the Method. Save.\nIf your NetworkManager does not state any ethernet connection, just click \"Add\" and add one. \n", "Q: black screen startup.

She is wanting to learn to code. She wants to create apps and games.  I want to give her a laptop for Christmas. My research indicates I should download Ubuntu for her.  I saw where Ubuntu partners with an organization to provide Google chromebooks to kids with Ubuntu downloaded.  I am considering getting the following laptop; HP 13.1 touch screen 750 GB Hard Drive AMD Quad Core A8-6410 2.4 GHZ AMD Radeon R5 Graphics. 6GB DDR3 Memory.  She is just starting and just took a course to create a video game.  Her game will be showcased at a technology fair in January. I am not tech savvy.  I do want to give the best start That I can but I can not pay $1000 for a gaming computer. This computer is on sale at sams and I can get 24 months no interest to pay for it.  Would this make a good a starter computer for a young coder?\n\nA: You're probably asking your question at the right website, although some would differ and slight it because of the hardware topic. The fact is that Ubuntu has a different character from proprietary operating systems, and that is what makes it such a good operating system for development. Like any other work, development is dependent on having the right tools to do the job properly. By doing the job properly I mean being able to download and install the necessary software in order to not have to \"reinvent the wheel\" for every project. \nUbuntu has a very large repository of vetted software, and this is a great benefit, but in the end one has to face the eventuality of requiring additional software from untrusted sources and this means in real terms having to run such software in some sort of virtual environment, either a virtual envelope or if that is not possible a virtual machine.  \nThe requirements for a virtual machine would be enough RAM (6GB is OK) and preferably an SSD. Although a spinning hard drive is possible, it's slow and unpleasant to use compared to an SSD. A touch screen is nice, but a 13\" screen is in my opinion entirely too small. It's unpleasant to have to work with your eyes glued to a small screen squinting to read miniature lines of text on the screen. LCD screens become yellowish and off-color with age, so get a computer with an LED screen. A ten-year-old girl will have no difficulty at all appreciating the difference between an LED and an LCD screen.\nFor development, the difference between a laptop and a desktop computer is like the difference between a little gardening shovel and a full-sized shovel. They're almost like two completely different tools. You can't properly do gardening with a full-sized shovel and you can't properly shovel wet concrete with a gardening shovel. Lines of code on a screen have a virtual weight. For working with large quantities of code, you need a full-sized tool to do the job efficiently.\n\nA: It very much would so make a good computer for a young coder. Touch screen is nice for art, you can get her a touch pen for greater accuracy later, and you wouldn't need the tablet to go with it until she really finds the need for it. \nYour biggest issue will be the eventuality of her looking into making something bigger, like a 3D game. A 3D game,especially one created with a powerful engine, can be very tough on a computer like this. Some of them ask for a minimum of 8Gig ram or more.\nDon't let the latter discourage you though, there is still much she can do with this as it is. If she likes making games, you might want to know if she likes making the art for her games, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has great open-source (free, and without royalty) programs like \nART\n-Inkscape (Art Program)\n-GIMP (Adobe Photoshop quality program)\n-Blender (like autodesk maya which is 7000. A 2D/3D art program and game engine)\n-MyPaint (works with Wacom tablets, so you neednt use the mouse tediously)\nMOVIE (could be video game cutscenes)\n-Kino\n-Pitivi\nMUSIC (for game music)\n-Ardour (Music Maker)\n-MusE (Music Maker)\n-Rosegarden (Audio Sequencer)\nthese are programs for making games, they are all bundled together so that its easier to make a game.\nGAME ENGINES (some have demos only that are free to use)\n-Open Game Maker\n-Solarus\n-Game Maker Studio\n-C4 Engine\nIf she likes making art on computers as well as coding, a Wacom Tablet and Pen might be a good investment for the future, they go as cheap as 99$ for both.\nIf she is into 2D games and coding programs and viewing the code of other people, this is the PERFECT computer for her right now. The codes on linux are almost always open source and available for anyone to see, study, change, and distribute. So your daughter can learn from tech geniuses without needing to go to college to meet them first, this community is full of really smart people who can answer her questions and help her grow from an aspiring coder to whatever she wants.\nLittle more advice\nI am 20 years old and I have had \"I wanna pull out my hair moments\" trying to use this OS after 20 years of windows and mac. But reinstalling the OS is free and quick so if you screw up you just start over and redownload everthing much faster now that you know what to do.\nIf you yourself haven't looked up Sudo commands and the like for the linux terminal it might be wise to check it out so that you can show her how to open up terminal and how to google for the instructions on how to add what shes trying to add.\nfor example I needed Nuvola Player as an app for my Google Play Music. But its not on the ubuntu software center, so I needed to download the Nuvola Tarball on thier website and extract it, then run the installer through terminal to get the app.\nwould have looked something like this\nctrl+alt+t (open terminal)\ncd home/username/desktop/nuvola   [hit enter]\nsudo apt-get install nuvola-player   [hit enter]\nsudo apt-get update    [hit enter]\nand poof the nuvola player is on my computer.\nThe only true reason we see this as anymore complicated than the windows and mac way of going onto the web and finding files to download is that we got used to the fact that we needed to go out into the dangerous web with a stupidly weak Operating System like Windows, attempting to dodge virus' and hopefully getting the files we wanted.\nThis way we get the files from the source and no virus' or bloatware will show up with it. no offers to norton antivirus or for girth enlargement pills, none of that garbage. Just you and the files you wanted on the computer you love. Once you get used to the terminal, the OS is a piece of cake.\neverything on linux works perfectly for me except that sometimes on boot I need to start up twice, and now my headphone speakers will not play, although my mic does work. trying to solve this one myself haha.\nanyways hope this helps\nEDIT\nI just read the other post about a laptop and a desktop difference is like a tiny garden shovel and a full sized shovel. True in its ways. \nBut.. A huge but is this.\nI have an old macbook, almost 10 years old. It has intel core 2 duo, 256 Megabytes of ram, and some whack graphics card that has no name and it just a bunch of random assorted numbers. It's awful,I there's a game from the 90's on my steam that won't run on it... \nOn top of all this it runs Linux 12.04 32-bit perfectly, there's new 300$ laptops that run worse. Its alive and kicking and just last week it was dead and in a drawer rotting away. \nLinux brought a useless laptop back and now it runs inkscape,even blender runs,I haven't put strAin on it in blender but still it works. It runs GIMP, Libre office, steam (games won't run without a new graphic card and ram though) and everything else essentially. Linux just kicks butt in this regard. My Mac was dead and osx was actually holding it back. Now I can do more coding than your little girl could learn in a year on a crummy laptop that wouldn't start a week ago. Not that I could,cuz I suck at coding so far I'm very new to it. But just to put in to perspective just how weak a laptop can be and still run Linux and the nice programs it has\n", "Q: Ubuntu and Windows drivers question? I'm probably the world's newest Ubuntu user; just installed it today. I'm so excited to start using it. However, I have a slight problem. I have a wirless keyboard and mouse called \"Microsoft Wireless Mouse 3000\". I had a driver for it installed on windows 7. But, when I went to the Microsoft Website to download the drivers, there were driver installations for Windows Vista, 7, and Mac OS X 10.4-7. There were no downloads for Ubuntu. :( What should I do?\n\nA: In general,\n\n*\n\n*Wireless mice and keyboards that have a USB dongle don't need any drivers, in any OS - they will just work.\nIf they did come bundled with drivers, the drivers will not usually be essential, but will only add extra features such as a little configuration console (that runs all the time in the tray, consuming resources), or activate extra features on the device, usually unrelated to the plain keyboard/mouse functionality.  Even the media/navigation buttons on the keyboard are likely to work without extra drivers these days.\n\n\n*Linux tends to include drivers for as many devices as possible in its kernel (and related firmware packages).  As you have noticed, it is not typical for device manufacturers to include Linux drivers for download from their sites, so this is often combated by the fact the Linux kernel already has drivers for a lot of devices.\n", "Q: Headset appearing as only input, tried so many things to fix and out of ideas. ubuntu 14.04 I have searched googled for a very long time, I am about ready to start pulling my hair out.\nI have headset with built in mic, no matter what USB port I use it only shows as a Mic in Sound Settings or Pavo.\nWhen I user \"#  alsamixer\" in terminal it shows the all the headset speakers AND the mic, and nothing is muted. trust me nothing is muted anywhere.\nI recently switched off the nouveau driver before I ever tried using the headset, because my games didnt work with that driver, counter strike was choppy and required very low graphics to run and war thunder was crashing at boot.

Sometimes the downloaded ISO is corrupted.  Sometimes the cd/dvd which is burned is flawed.  Sometimes writing the ISO image to flash media goes wrong.  \nI recommend you start over with a fresh copy of the OS to be installed.  While you are at it I have one more tip for you if you prefer safety and don't mind opening your PC to ensure a desirable result.  Please consider opening your PC and physically disconnecting the 1tb drive containing your windows installation while installing Ubuntu to the 80gb.  This way neither drive can be overwritten.  Later when both drives are connected, there's about a 60% chance that GRUB will offer up both operating systems as though you had a typical dual boot.  If that is not the case, reinstalling grub is EASY, and can be accomplished either of a couple of easy ways.\nMy reason for giving you that added advice is to help save you from a circumstance in which you might not be able to boot your PC to EITHER operating system, and also to help prevent your Windows installation from being accidentally overwritten.\n\nA: Well one big mistake you are making is that if you are installing Ubuntu on an SSD and Windows is on a different HDD all together, they are NOT being installed side by side.\nSide by side installation is intended for installing two operating systems on the same disk.\nWhat you are describing is very possible, install Ubuntu like a normal OS and update GRUB to see Windows on the other hard drive.\n", "Q: How to calculate Pi decimals from a given offset?

Only if an application does not listen to SIGTERM it may be killed. \nIn case a running application needs user interaction (test this with an opened unsaved document from LibreOffice) the shutdown will be halted until the user interacted.\nOn a multi-user system a user-initiated shutdown will be halted as long as other users are logged in. We need root privileges to still be able to shutdown. Then the SIGTERM signal will be sent to all open applications in all running sessions.\nIf is supposed that after a timeout (90 s) the user or the applications did not react on the SIGTERM signal SIGKILL should be issued which only then should lead to loss of unsaved data. The default KILL timeout for SIGTERM issued by upstart is much shorter (5 s).\n\nTesting on present release showed however that we can always shutdown without being prompted for saving our other other logged in user's unfinished work. As this indeed may lead to data loss I consider this a bug:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1281058\n\nA: As per my experience with Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. When you shutdown your computer, the kernel automatically sends a close notification to all open programs. It then shuts down after killing all processes including networks.\nWindows have a feature which works a little bit differently, if open processes require a file to be saved, the shutdown process is paused for some time until user interaction is observed.\n\nA: \nshutdown does its job by signalling the init process, asking it to\n  change the runlevel.  Runlevel 0 is used to halt the system.\n\nSo when run level changed to 0 i.e init 0. init get killed . Actually init is the parent process of all processes running in system. if parent process died then all child process will become zombies i.e they are not real process and not considerable.\ni.e all are closed.\nRead its Man-Page , All you have to do is some research on shutdown process.\n", "Q: two iso on the same pendrive? if I use Gparted can I create two partitions on my 4gb pendrive?\nand then can I make each of these two partitions becoming one an installer* for Ubuntu and the other one the installer for puppy Linux?

Holding packages can have a lot of nasty consequences on the long run.\nThe available versions can be found with apt-cache search numpy and after finding the correct name (by looking at the list): \n[romano:~] % apt-cache policy python-numpy\npython-numpy:\n  Installed: 1:1.8.2-0ubuntu0.1\n  Candidate: 1:1.8.2-0ubuntu0.1\n  Version table:\n *** 1:1.8.2-0ubuntu0.1 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     1:1.8.1-1ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages\n\n", "Q: User Rights letters to numbers I am having Problems converting user rights. I want to assign the following rights to certain files/folders but dont know hat to translate them into a format which chmod will work with like chmod 755.\n-rwxrwxrwx \n\nwill be?\nAnd\ndrwxr-xr-x\n\nwill be?\nAnd finally\n-rw-r--r--\n\nwill be?\n\nA: You don't need to convert them to numbers. chmod understands symbols just fine, if you split them into user, group and other fields. The following are equivalent:\nchmod 755 \nchmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx\n\nSo given a set of permissions like, split them like so:\n-rwxrwxrwx  == - rwx rwx rwx\ndrwxr-xr-x  == d rwx r-x r-x\n-rw-r--r--  == - rw- r-- r--\n\nAnd then assign the first triplet to u, the second to g and the third to o, skipping the hyphens:\nchmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx\nchmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx\nchmod u=rw,g=r,o=r\n\nWhen two fields are the same, you can combine them. The last chmod would be the same as:\nchmod u=rw,go=r\n\nAnd you can use a (all) to assign to u,g and o at once, so the first is equivalent to:\nchmod a=rwx\n\nNow, there are a few special permission bits: s (setuid/setgid) and t (sticky bit).\nThese are shown over the field where x is normally seen, so if a directory has the sticky bit for others, you'd see a t (if execute permissions are present) or a T (if execute permissions are not present) . For example, the permissions of /tmp:\ndrwxrwxrwt\n\nIn such cases, you need to write t as xt, and s as rwxs:\nchmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwxt \n\n\n\n*\n\n*The setuid bit means that when this file is executed, it runs as the user who owns the file, not as the user executing it. Consider passwd (used for changing the password):\n# stat `which passwd`\nAccess: (4755/-rwsr-xr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\n\nIf I (user muru) run passwd, the process that is started runs with root's permissions, not with mine. It is usually seen on binaries which need to be root for performing some action (passwd edits /etc/shadow, for example).\n\n*The setgid bit on a directory means that any newly created files or directories in it inherit the group ownership. It is usually seen on directories used for web or FTP servers, etc.\n\n*The sticky bit means that even if an user has write permissions on the directory, they cannot move or rename another user's files. It is usually seen on shared directories, like /tmp.\n\nA: Short version:\n\n*\n\n*Permissions can include: read(r), write(w), execute(x)\n\n\n*Therefore, permissions are expressed in a row of three characters, for example rwx (to give all permissions)\n\n\n*When a permission is denied, a \"-\" is placed, for example: r-- to give only read permission.\n\n\n*because there are three types of users, we will need 3 x 3 characters:\n owner | owner group | others\n\nfor example rwx rwx rwx gives all types of users all permissions.\n\n*\n\n*these permissions can be expressed in octal numbering, where:\n read    =  4\n write   =  2\n execute =  1\n\n so: \n r-- = 4\n rw- = 6\n rwx = 7\n\n\n\n*example:\n rw- r-- r-- \n\ngives everyone read permission, only user can write. In octal:\n    644 \n\n(4+2+0 | 4+0+0 | 4+0+0 )\nYour example:\n-rwxrwxrwx\n\nis probably the output of ls -l, where the preceding - means it is a file. In your second example:\ndrwxr-xr-x\n\nthe item is a directory (d)\n\nAbout the s flag\nFrom the Wikipedia article on setuid:\n\nsetuid and setgid (short for \"set user ID upon execution\" and \"set\ngroup ID upon execution\", respectively) are Unix access rights flags\nthat allow users to run an executable with the permissions of the\nexecutable's owner or group respectively and to change behaviour in\ndirectories. They are often used to allow users on a computer system\nto run programs with temporarily elevated privileges in order to\nperform a specific task.\n\nAn example is passwd (-rwsr-xr-x) which can change write-protected files on behalf of a user.\nA pretty good description is to be found here on Wikipedia.\nThe t flag (sticky bit)\n(Again) from the Wikipedia article on Sticky bit:\n\nWhen a directory's sticky bit is set, the filesystem treats the files\nin such directories in a special way so only the file's owner, the\ndirectory's owner, or root user can rename or delete the file. Without\nthe sticky bit set, any user with write and execute permissions for\nthe directory can rename or delete contained files, regardless of the\nfile's owner.\n\nOn Linux systems, the t flag is ignored when used on files.\nNumerically, the sticky bit, the setuid bit and setgid bit are set using the first digit of a 4-digit octal value. From man 1 chmod:\n\nA numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by\nadding up the bits  with values  4,  2,  and  1.   Omitted digits are\nassumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID\n(4) and set group ID (2) and restricted  deletion  or  sticky  (1)\nattributes.   The  second  digit  selects permissions for the user who\nowns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects\npermissions  for  other  users  in  the file's  group,  with  the\nsame  values;  and the fourth for other users not in the file's group,\nwith the same values.\n\nSo:\n\n*\n\n*rwsr-xr-x would be 4755, using the conversion for rwxr-xr-x to get 755 we saw earlier, and 4 for the setuid bit as mentioned here.\n\n*rwxrwsrwt would be 3777, using the conversion for rwxr-xr-x to get 777, and the leading 3 from the setgid bit (2) and sticky bit (1).\n\n", "Q: Unable to eject DVD When a DVD is inserted into the drive, it will play and work as normal, however it refuses to eject. I've tried via the command line as well as the eject button. I remember a while back finding some code to add to a file (not helpful, I know!) which basically prevented the drive from locking. Can anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: It is not a good idea to eject a disc while it is mounted into the file system. Many application don't expect that and might not work properly anymore. Also in some rare cases a forced eject can to physical damage to the drive or media.\nTo prevent ejecting a mounted media Linux usually prevents to eject via the the button on the drive. If the disk in unmounted, you eject normally.\nThe most easy way to do that is to use Nautilus (the file manager) and click the eject button next to the drive. This will unmount and eject the disc.\nIn XBMC there is usually an option to do that as well, where depends on the used skin.\nYou can control the locking behavior with the eject command:\neject -i on /dev/cdrom\neject -i off /dev/cdrom\n\nman eject will give you a list of arguments you can supply to eject some might also be helpful in getting more control over the drive's ejection behavior.\n", "Q: Gnome keyboard accelerators / keys in Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 Since upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04 I've lost the ability to set custom keyboard shortcuts in Gnome applications such as gedit and meld.\nThe setting can-change-accels has no effect when enabled using either gconf-editor or dconf-editor. I also tried using the UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 gedit command. In gedit, no matter what, I can't set accelerators by hovering over the menus. Manually editing the .config/gedit/accels file has no effect (accelerator is not working), and the file is re-written upon exit of the application (the rewritten file is all-comments). Inside meld, I noticed that you can set the accelerators by hovering, and they work for the duration of the program, but they are persisted nowhere. Upon restart, the old accelerator is in effect. Watching my home dir shows that no configuration files are written when setting the shortcut, neither when exiting the application.\nI also tried creating a ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file, no effect.\nOne of the questions I checked out: here\nMy conclusion so far is that a serious and important feature of Ubuntu 14.04 is malfunctioning beyond repair. I'm only using LT releases but am consistently dissapointed by the fragility of desktop features.\nNote: I'm using gnome flashback - metacity login.

I want to easily create live usb installation USBs for testing purposes, for installing various distros in VM and to have at hand an installation device in case I need to reinstall my system.\nBut most tutorials direct me to applications that create Linux installation usbs in Windows, while I want to do it in Ubuntu. (Xubuntu)\nI was expecting to find a big old question on this on askubuntu to which this one should be a duplicate, but I seem to miss it.\nThe only tool I used in Ubuntu is Unetbootin.\nAre there others? - in case something goes wrong and I might need an alternative.\n\nA: Many live CD images are actually hybrid CD/USB images, so they can be copied directly to either a CD or USB drive with dd and will work either way.  This is true of all Ubuntu and Debian official live CD images over the last few years, and may be true of other distros.\ndd if=cdimage.iso of=/dev/xxx\n\nWhere /dev/xxx is the USB drive.\nIn cases where that doesn't work because the image is not a hybrid CD/USB image, unetbootin is the best way I can think of.\n\nA: You can either use Startup Disk Creator or MultiSystem, a tool which has the advantage of being able to put multiple distros onto a single USB stick.\nFollow these links to install and use MultiSystem:\nhttp://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Blogs/Productivity-Sauce/Create-a-Multi-boot-USB-Stick-with-MultiSystem , \nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/multiboot-create-a-multiboot-usb-from-linux/ . \nIf you don't have startup disk creator in your applications, install it by sudo apt-get install usb-creator-gtk. \nI prefer these tools than Unetbootin for creating a live USB.\n\nA: A very efficient and easy to use tool is the one from Linux Mint,  which can still has a PPA for older Ubuntu:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tsvetko.tsvetkov/trusty-backports\n\nor\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tsvetko.tsvetkov/xenial-backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mintstick\n\nAlthough a single application, it is used as two separate launchers for the two separate actions: format (USB Image Formatter) and installation (USB Image Writer). \n\nIn order to install it in Ubuntu 18.04:\nuntil a newer version is launched along with a Ubuntu 18.04-based Linux Mint, download latest version 1.3.8 from here.\nOpen a terminal at the location of the download and do\nsudo dpkg -i mintstick_1.3.8_all.deb\n\nInstall the missing dependencies.\nIf needed do\nsudo apt --fix-broken install\n\nthen do again  sudo dpkg -i mintstick_1.3.8_all.deb.\n\nThere is also gnome-multi-writer. \nsudo apt install gnome-multi-writer\n\n\nIt is able to format a stick before writing, but cannot simply format (without writing anything). \nFor the latter purpose, one can use \"Disks\" (gnome-disk-utility), which is a bit quicker than Gparted or the KDE Partition Manager. \nsudo apt install gnome-disk-utility\n\nIf the usb stick already contains a live Linux, it is a bit trickier: first, select \"Format Disk\" from the top right corner (NOT \"Format partition\" ), \n\nthen select \"Partitioning: No partitioning\".\nAnd only then select Additional partitioning options - \"Format partition\" , FAT, Next, Format.\n\n\n\"Disks\" (gnome-disk-utility) can also write an iso to the usb: after having formatted the usb as said above: go to Additional partitioning options as before, and select \"Restore partition image\", then select the Linux iso.\n\n\nA: There are many tools for this, my favorite is Etcher. Its just so simple to use and the UI is beautiful. Also works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux distros. Available at http://etcher.io\n\n\nA: There is an application called usb-disk-creator available via official repositories.

I've set my grandson's laptop to be able to dual boot (Vista and Ubuntu). I'd like to give as much space as possible to Ubuntu as Windows isn't used much. I'm  pretty noob to Linux and have no real idea how to use gparted.\nHere is a screenshot of gparted; it'd be great if someone could explain what it means and how to give more space to Ubuntu and less to Windows.\n\n\nA: This is what to consider before we can change partition size:\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing partitions always bears a risk of data loss. Therefore backup all valuable data.\n\n*Only partitions that are unmounted can be altered, i.e. work on a live session (boot Ubuntu \"Try out\").\n\n*Ubuntu does not need much space (30 GB) but knowing that the other OS is Vista it may really be better to give Vista as little space as possible but not too small (or remove it entirely if you grandson agreed).\n\n*Ubuntu needs two partitions at least (root partition /, and swap) but it can handle more if needed. Some people recommend a seaparte HOME partition, which eases distribution upgrades and backups.\n\n*Swap needs to be in a single partition with no holes. It is therefore in the way when you enlarge your NTFS partition to hold Ubuntu.\n\n*Windows must not be hibernated.\n\n*We can only have 4 primary partitions in an MSDOS partition table. Make extended partitions to hold Ubuntu.\n\n\nFrom your present partition layout it appears that the root partition for Ubuntu is a bit too small, and the swap partition is in the way of increasing your root partition.\nIt is possible to add a swap partition later but this may be too complicated for a first start into the Ubuntu universe.\nLet me therefore recommend that you \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup all valuable data\n\n*Delete and remove your existing Ubuntu partitions (this will delete all data in them!)\n\n*Resize (shrink) the Windows partition (to the right side) according to the excellent answer you already have (but you may have to repair your filesystem from a Vista CD), or from Windows. Shrinking may need a defragmentation first.\n\n*Re-install Ubuntu to the now sufficiently large unpartitioned space you will have gained in step 3.\n\n*On re-installation of Ubuntu take care to select the unpartitioned space for installation of /, swap, and if applciable /home on \"Do something else\", or let the installer automatically do this for your by choosing \"Install alongside of Windows\".\n\n\nA: It's pretty simple.

Upgrading Ubuntu to a new distribution entails a download of about 2GB each time while Android upgrades require a download of a few hundred MB's. \nAndroid is of course a smaller operating system but another difference is that an Android upgrade only upgrades the base OS (kernel and the fundamental apps) and not the user installed apps. But an Ubuntu upgrade updates every single application and library, it seems that it even reinstalls the ones which have not been moved to a new version.\nMy question is about the latter difference: why is this and does it give any advantage over the Android model?\n\nA: Android uses something called ARM as it component setup.   ARM uses much less hardware because of the smaller space.  Because of this Ubuntu on Android doesn't need to be as big.  Also most phone devices don't have more than 1 gb of storage space on a common level.  We are also talking about mobile data.   No one wants 2gb eaten on a single update. \n", "Q: ubuntu 14.10: ibus only working in the search applicatoin Just installed Ubunut 14.10 (clean install with old $HOME directory).

(The spool files found in /var/spool/mail/$USER on Linux). To do this, I would like to create a continuous loop that excutes once every 30 seconds. Each time the loop executes, it will compare the size of the mail spool file with its size from the previous loop. If the new size is greater than the old size, I will have it print a message saying \"You have new mail.\"\nI've written the script below, but I'm failing to get it to work.

I want to integrate node.js into the kernel as a module. So that i could develop a common html+js+css app as a desktop app. How can this be done ? It would be nice if ubuntu had this feature.\n\nA: No, there is no way to do this. In general, having it as a kernel module will pose a significant security risk, because nodejs is executing a user application and if there are problems with that application, it will be very easy to exploit them. As well, kernel modules are supposed to be \"very tight and tidy\" in terms of their runtime behavior, many/most nodejs application certainly will not be.\nI might be wrong, but I am not aware of any other software similar to nodejs that runs as a kernel module (java, django, etc.).\nAt the same time, I do not think you are going to gain any real benefits compared to running it as a daemon.\n", "Q: Copying files from one user to another in a single machine How can I copy files or directories from one user to another user on the same machine via the commandline?\nSuppose there is a file test.txt in the home directory of USER1. I need to copy that file to the home directory of USER2 on my machine. How can I do it via the commandline?\n\nA: If you don't have sudo privileges, an alternative may be to use scp with localhost:\nscp file1 user2@localhost:/home/user2/\n\nThis assumes:\n\n*\n\n*You have the login information for both users\n\n*An SSH server is enabled on the host\n\n* can login via ssh\n\n\nA: Assuming that you have sudo privileges  the following command will do.\nsudo cp /home/USER1/FNAME /home/USER2/FNAME && sudo chown USER2:USER2 /home/USER2/FNAME\n\nWill copy the file from USER1 to USER2, and then change the owner of the copy in /home/USER2 to USER2\nIf you do not have sudo privileges, then the two users will need to ensure that you have read permissions on the USER1 directory, and write access on the USER2 directory.  If you have these accesses, you can enter the command:\ncp /home/USER1/FNAME /home/USER2/FNAME\n\nThis will copy the file in question, but USER2 may not be able to manipulate the file until they have appropriate permissions.\n\nA: Assume you either do not have ssh installed, or cannot do do not want to share keys/secrets.\nSuppose user1 is in group1, and user2 is in group2, and both user1 != user2 and group1 != group2.\nCreate a shared group, group3s.\naddgrp group3\n\nAdd both user1 and user2 to group3s.\nCreate a directory in a mutually accessible place, where one user owns, but has group ownership of group3s.\n#as user1,\nmkdir $place/shared && chown user1.group3s $place/shared && chmod 770 $place/shared;\n#as user1 or user2,\ncp $file $place/shared && chgrp $place/shared/$file && chmod 660 $place/shared/$file\n\nBut, suppose you cannot create the new, shared group, and place both users in that group?\nCreate the directory and give it 770 permissions,\nmkdir $place/shared && chown user1.group1 $place/shared && chmod 770 $place/shared;\n\nThen, as root/admin, change the group ownership to the other user's group,\nsudo bash\nchgrp group2 $place/shared && chmod g+s $place/shared\n\nThe command chmod g+s sets the setgid bit so that files placed into the directory have the group ownership set to group2.\n\nA: As USER1:\ncp [filename] /tmp\nchmod 777 /tmp/[filename]\n\nAs USER2:\ncp /tmp/[filename] .\n\nAs USER1:\nrm /tmp/[filename]\n\n\nA: Use the below commands to copy files\nsudo cp /home/USER1/test.txt /home/USER2/test.txt \nsudo chown USER2:USER2 /home/USER2/test.txt \n\nUse the below commands to copy directories\nsudo cp -r /home/USER1/directory1 /home/USER2/directory1 \nsudo chown -R USER2:USER2 /home/USER2/directory1 \n\n\nA: Every other answer here requires root access, allows any user on the same machine to copy the file, or requires password sharing. Here is a method that does not:\nHave USER2 (let's call him Bob) run the following commands (you can replace /tmp with any directory that both users have permissions to write to, but /tmp is ideal because by default it is sticky, which prevents a malicious user from subverting this process. A directory owned by Bob that is world-readable also works):\n[bob@computer ~]$ touch /tmp/test.txt\n[bob@computer ~]$ chmod 622 /tmp/test.txt\n\nThis creates a file that is world-writable, but not readable.\nThen have USER1 (let's call her Alice) run (if you're paranoid, Alice can check the permissions first to make sure the file is owned by Bob):\n[alice@computer ~]$ dd if=\"$HOME/test.txt\" of=/tmp/test.txt\n\nThis overwrites the contents of /tmp/test.txt. If you want to check integrity of the file, Alice should also generate a hash of the file. For instance:\n[alice@computer ~]$ openssl sha1 < \"$HOME/test.txt\" > /tmp/test.txt.sha1\n\nYou can instead digitally sign the file, or any other method of guaranteeing its integrity.\nAnd finally Bob moves the file and takes ownership of it:\n[bob@computer ~]$ mv /tmp/test.txt \"$HOME\" \n[bob@computer ~]$ chmod 600 \"$HOME/test.txt\"\n\nAnd Bob can check the integrity if he likes. If so, he should check to make sure only Alice can write to /tmp/test.txt.\n[bob@computer ~]$ diff /tmp/test/txt.sha1 <(openssl sha1 < \"$HOME/test.txt\")\n\nIf the file was copied correctly, this should display no output.\n\nA: The trick is to place the file in a subdirectory where all users has read and execute rights.\nIt will not work in $HOME as it has file mode 700.\nmkdir -m 755 share              # 755 might be default with umask\ncd share                        # you have to cd\ntouch file\nsudo -u user2 cp file ~user2/\n\n\nA: try install;\nman install\n-o, --owner=OWNER\n-g, --group=GROUP\ninstall -C -o ldap -g ldap /etc/letsencrypt/live/privkey.pem /etc/openldap/certs/tls/ldap_server.key\n\n\nA: Before going to copy one user to another you need to login as su user and then you use the command cp\nsudo cp /home/shyam/Desktop/sparkhadoop_2.11-1.0.jar /home/hadoop/Desktop\n\n", "Q: If I boot Ubuntu, restart and then Boot Windows, it will give an error in the boot loader I have Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.10 in my laptop. If I boot into Ubuntu and then reboot and try to boot into Windows 8, in the Windows 8 boot screen (With a light blue background) I will get an error saying \"contain errors\". Then I have to press ctrl+alt+del to reboot and then again if I try Windows it will work. What is happening in here?\n\nA: The answer to your problem is to disable Fast Boot on Windows 8.\nTo disable it - \nAll Control Panel items -> Power Options -> System Settings\nClick on the 'Change settings that are currently unavailable' link to make the Shutdown options available and Untick the Turn on fast startup option.\nThe reason for this is explained below with content from this source.\nFast boot explained with an image:\n\nDuring fast boot the system loads the hiberfile and does not use the files on the filesystem. \nSo the biggest problem, and the worst problem you can have on a computer, is data loss: if you create a shared NTFS data partition the hibernation may maintain the file structure so if you try to save a file from Linux into the NTFS partition it will get lost on Windows reboot as it only remembers the old file structure. See this Ubuntu Forums thread for more information.\nIn general: if a disc is mounted when using fast boot, Windows puts this disc and its content in a hiberfile. Any changes made to the system are gone when the hiberfile is restored. This includes mounted external discs. Ubuntu will refuse to mount a disc that has a hiberfile. \nOne of the bad messages you see in these topics is getting a \"disc has errors\" when booting Windows.\n\nA: Windows 8 discourages to dualboot ubuntu and winodws both together.\nSo you should have faced a lot of problems with UEFI, Legcay and BIOS modes and settings.\nSo the problem you have now is usually seen with most people who use Ubuntu with Windows 8 or later versions..\nSo I prefer you to use Ubuntu as the main and the only operating system in your computer.\nOr If you can't still leave Windows, Then Try removing Ubuntu and install Ubuntu in some another device !\nYou better do that I think !\nOtherwise Windows 8 will always make disturb you with this error !\n\nA: Try using EasyBCD on your Windows System to reconfigure Windows 8 to use the classic bootloader that was used in Windows 7.That way it will no more interfere with GRUB or other bootloaders making no problem with your system.\n", "Q: Nvidia Optimus with GTX 850m not working I recently got a new notebook (Acer Aspire V5 573G) with a Nvidia Geforce GTX 850M and the Intel Haswell integrated graphics.\nNow I read through a lot of websites in order to find out what the best way is to get the system running. Usually, I wont need the GeForce card so that the intel one is good enough. However, I think the Displayport and the HDMI port are wired to the Nvidia card, so I need that one to work as well. \nProblem is, the Nvidia card is not detected by Ubuntu: Output of lshw -C display:\n*-display\n       description: VGA compatible controller\n       product: Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 2\n       bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n       version: 0b\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n       configuration: driver=i915 latency=0\n       resources: irq:65 memory:b3000000-b33fffff memory:c0000000-cfffffff ioport:5000(Größe=64)\n\nThe best thing for me would be, that the Nvidia card is constantly turned off but can be activated so that i can use HDMI/Displayport. I already tried to install bumblebee, but -of course- the card is not detected.\nPlease tell me if you need any further information.\nThanks a lot!\nEDIT: Output of uname -a:\nLinux LappII 3.13.0-52-generic #86-Ubuntu SMP Mon May 4 04:32:59 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nA: I think the problem is that current version of Nvidia drivers in Ubuntu does not support this card. You can try to install a newer version.\nRun in terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346\nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nAlso it makes sense to upgrade kernel and graphical stack to HWE of 14.04.2.\nIt can be done by running:\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-lts-utopic libqt5gui5 libgles1-mesa-lts-utopic libgles2-mesa-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic:i386 libglapi-mesa-lts-utopic:i386 libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-utopic\n\nThen reboot.\nAfter that try both 346 and 349 drivers. New kernel and stack support newer hardware better.\n\nA: Instead of Bumblebee, you could try nVidia's proprietary drivers, which have been added Optimus support to.\nOpen the Software & Updates utility, and navigate to the Additional drivers tab. It will take some time to load, after which you'll be presented with a list of drivers known to work with this device. By default, the open source noveau driver will be selected.\nSelect the driver next in the list, probably something like nvidia-331, and click Apply. After the download and installation of the driver finished, reboot. You can now open the nVidia Control Panel and configure Optimus in the nVidia Prime section.\nIf the driver doesn't support Optimus or works badly with your graphics card, choose the following one in the list.\n\nA: Based on what you have said in earlier communications on the Question. Nvidia 349 Seems to be working with your Card. You also intend to use Nvidia GPU only when needed. \nSo I have a Solution for you. I have posted this to my blog a well and got a very positive response from people who used it. So I have compiled a little how to document like below\nThe official Repository of Ubuntu has only old and dated drivers. I don't use that myself and would suggest you do the same if you want the latest Nvidia Driver without any problems.\nSteps:-\n1) First step after installing Ubuntu is to install all updates. You may use the software updater or simply run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n2) Add the Xorg-edgers ppa using\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa and then sudo apt-get update\n3) Run sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nThis is the most Important step. If you miss this you will see a black screen after reboot. Please do this as we are using the xorg-edgers ppa. We need to ensure all packags required for bumblebee and nvidia are taken from the ppa.\n4) Now Install bumblebee and Nvidia drivers using\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia primus nvidia-349\n5) Add the current user to the bumblebee security group.\nsudo gpasswd -a $USER bumblebee\nfor Ubuntu 15.04 only you need to manually enable to bumblebee daemon using\nsudo systemctl enable bumblebeed\n6) This will take care of the Installing the required software on your system. We need to configure it.\nI can assure you if you followed these steps so far then configuring should be a breeze.\nWe start by enabling bbswitch and intel i915 Driver.\n7) sudo gedit /etc/modules \nUbuntu 15.04 the file is /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf\nadd these two lines to it\ni915\nbbswitch\n8) Edit the bumblebee configuration file.\nsudo gedit /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf\n\n\n*\n\n*line 22:\n\n\nDriver=nvidia\n\n\n*line 55:\n\n\nKernelDriver=nvidia-349\n\n\n*line 58:\n\n\nLibraryPath=/usr/lib/nvidia-349:/usr/lib32/nvidia-349\n\n\n*line 61:\n\n\nXorgModulePath=/usr/lib/nvidia-349/xorg,/usr/lib/xorg/modules\nIn addition to this there is another file that needs to edited.\n9) sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/bumblebee.conf\nAdd the below line to end.\nblacklist nvidia-349\nNow you may reboot. After reboot.\nCheck using\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils if mesa-utils is not already installed.\nprimusrun glxinfo | grep OpenGL\nThis should tell you that nvidia-349.16 driver in use.\nPlease note that nvidia-349 is the latest driver at the time of writng this. Please check the launchpad page for xorg-edgers ppa an accordingly replace nvidia-349 with the latest version if any.\nLet me know if this works for you.\n", "Q: Installing TikzEdt on Ubuntu 14.04 I switched from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 14.04 and want to install TikZ editor TikzEdt (See here and here).

I tried gpicview, nomacs, mirage and viewnior - all are permanently deleting images (there is a prompt) rather than using trash.\nI would prefer moving to trash without confirmation. Moving to trash after confirmation also would be better than not using trash.\nIs it some strange design tradition of not using trash on Linux? Is it maybe some system-wide setting?\n\nA: gThumb, available from package with this name is able to use Ubuntu trash folder (out of the box, without changing any settings).\nIt is also possible to stop confirmation before moving to trash using Edit | Preferences - tag General, section Other.\nEye of GNOME is also able to use trash and it is enabled by default, but it is impossible to pernamently disable confirmation before moving file to trash. It resides in package eog.\ngwenview also technically fits but is unusable due to horrible effects and animations, without option for disabling them (according to http://kde-bugs-dist.kde.narkive.com/YHb61htK/bug-289213-make-crossfade-animation-optional it should be possible once Ubuntu package is updated). Also, selecting \"install plugins\" results in installation of programs spamming start menu.\n\nA: I forked Viewnior 1.4 to delete to trash on my Ubuntu 14.10 install.\nOther notes\nIf configure yells it's missing exiv2  sudo apt-get install libexiv2-dev worked for me.\n\nA: The illusion of a \"trash bin\" is created by the file manager, e.g. Nautilus. It is just a normal directory somewhere in your home. For Nautilus, I think, it's ~/.local/share/Trash. The Linux kernel itself doesn't know about the trash bin.\nHowever, as there are quite a few file managers for Linux (I can name Nautilus, Nemo, Dolphin, Caja and PCManFM from memory, but there certainly are more than just those), it is near to impossible to create a program which moves items to the trash of the current file manager compatible with all file managers out there.\nSo I think you'll have a hard time finding a program fit for your needs. And if you don't find anything, you could get the source code of your favorite image display software and patch it so it will move images to PCManFM's (or another one if you don't use LXDE's default FM) trash.\n\nA: launch the File Manager get into menu -> Preferences -> Behavior -> Trash where you have choices about enabling a permanent delete or simply put into the trash bucket\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Slow and unstable wifi connection After installing Ubuntu 14.04, the connection frequently drops.

Or how can I get a fresh install and get rid of my windows partition?  I appreciate comments thus far, but none of the suggestions has worked.\n\nA: You need to apply the ISO to your DVD, not burn the ISO as a data file. Most burning suites will have an option like create dvd from disc image, that is what you'll need to choose, then browse for the ISO, insert a blank DVD, and click burn. You will then be able to boot the DVD, and install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Any application wherein i can create photo mosaic I am new to Ubuntu and  I wonder if there's an application that i can install so  I can create mosaic out of my photos.

Basically from what I understand from the man pages is that you made every symbolic linked file to the user group 'root'.

I have been researching this for a couple hours now with no luck.  It doesn't have to be long. All I need is an example and I can copy it for different extensions.

I'd rather scan files for their MIME type using a combination of find and file.

Saved to media.txt\"\n\nNote that I use full RegExp with grep. To add some MIME types, build them the same way as I did with the two already included: (type/enc;) and add them with a RegExp OR (|).\nPS: As is, the script operates in the current directory. If you want to make it more flexible, add a $1 between find and the following pipe. Now run the script and give the path to search as argument.\n\nA: Definitely a more verbose option (python) that looks for mimetype(s) using the file command.

When I reboot the server it boots up with nginx running, and not apache2 like I would like.\nI end up having to stop the nginx service, then restart apache2 to get everything running as I would like it to.\nTo further complicate my problem is when I try to remove nginx it says it is not installed but if I run locate nginx it brings up a couple hundred files so clearly it is installed.\nHow do I remove nginx completely?  I've tried removing and purging the nginx package without success.\n\nA: The nginx package is just a metapackage, and points to the nginx flavors.  Because apt-get, apt, and dpkg are not as smart as users assume it will be, removing the nginx package does not remove the actual nginx binaries and common files.\nRun the following to remove all flavors of NGINX from the system.  This will catch at least one installed one, and the common files that are common across the entire set:  \nsudo apt-get remove nginx nginx-common nginx-full nginx-extras nginx-core nginx-naxsi nginx-light nginx-doc\n\nAfter this, you can then run Apache automatically.\nNOTE: Ubuntu Server does not come with nginx automatically installed - when you install a web server on Ubuntu Server via tasksel or as a LAMP install, you get Apache, and not nginx.

Cases in which mounting a Windows partition is impossible include:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the installed Windows is hibernated rather than fully shut down, the partition will have a flag telling so. mount.ntfs may refuse to mount the drive.\n\n*If the partition is encrypted, you either can't mount it or can't read from it.\n\n\nThere may be other cases in which a Windows drive remains unmountable, but these two are the most common problems.\n", "Q: Multitouch gestures do not work on an Asus X555LA Just bought an Asus X555LA laptop, and multitouch on the touchpad does not seem to work.

I have installed PHP using apt-get.\nI need to enable PDO_OCI using:\n$ ./configure --with-pdo-oci=instantclient,/usr,10.2.0.3\nas per http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-oci.php.\nHow can I do so?\n\nA: The packages you download via apt are pre-compiled binaries. You'll have to build PHP from source using those options.\nYou can get the source from the PHP website or using for example:\napt-get source php5\n\nA: You can't.\nThe ./configure script creates Makefiles - recipes how to make the actual program.\nWhen you invoke make you create the actual program using these recipes.\nThe actual program - the binary executable file will likely be different from the one installed by apt-get. Sometimes these differences are small but sometimes they may require extra dependencies and/or configuration files. If this is your case then manually replacing the program file will likely break your system.\nEven if you replace the package supplied binary file (/usr/bin/php5 or whatever) with your own and nothing breaks, next time there is an update of the php package your file will be overwritten by apt-get without warning, so don't do that.\nWhat I would do in your situation is install the newly compiled php in directory /usr/local - along with the existing php. Then configure apache to use your php rather than the one supplied by the package manager.\nOnce you do that make sure you subscribe to the PHP security list and apply any security related patches as soon as possible. Failure to do so will leave your server exposed to hackers.\n", "Q: Why is Memtest still version 4.20 when there is 5.01 out since over a year? Why is Memtest still version 4.20 when there is 5.01 out since over a year? Is it so hard to get that one into the repositories?

However, since 250GiB is too less space for my files and the system, I'm going to remove the DVD drive and install the HDD into the now-empty space using a HDD Caddy, where I want to put my files onto.\nHowever, I still want things like ~/.config, ~/.local etc. on the SSD, since my HDD is a real performance bottleneck and applications will most likely load faster if all their config is on the SSD. But all other stuff I want on the HDD: Documents, Pictures, Music, ...\nIs there any way to accomplish this in a way where I don't notice the partition difference? E.g. I'd like not to mount all my data at e.g. /media/data, but I'd like to have the directories from the HDD root mounted 1:1 inside my home. Where and how woud I have to mount the HDD root?\nE.g.:\n/home/username/\n    .config/\n    .local/\n    .PlayOnLinux/ # -> not sure yet\n    Documents/ -> HDD/Documents/\n    Pictures/ -> HDD/Pictures/\n    Downloads/ -> HDD/Downloads/\n    .bashrc\n    #...\n    #Anything undefined to SSD\n\n\nA: This is completely possible.\nMount your HDD via fstab.\nModify the ~/.config/user-dirs.dirsin your home directory.\nYou can modify the entry by changing XDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$HOME/Picture\" to XDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"/<your_pictures_directory>\".\nThe same thing goes for any other such directory. \nMy setup below:\n\nThis will also change the bookmarks in the places column so you can easily navigate across directories. Programs also don't have any problem whatsoever.\nAfter this change, the programs will start using the new directories. Though the earlier folders will still exist, they wont be used by any programs. You need to remove them and replace them with symbolic links to your new directories. These symlinks are completely for our convenience only and have no impact on programs.\n\nA: the mount command as a bind option where you can mount a partition at a second place (sort of)\nso you can have in your /etc/fstab something like\n/dev/sdb3 /media/SSD_home ...\n/media/SSD_home /home/username/.config none bind\n\nthe second line is to bind the mount to the correct place\nThis has not been tested; it's jsut an idea\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Vulnerable to Shellshock?

Indeed, you'll see, earlier on in the instructions:\nsudo mount --bind /dev chroot/dev\n\n/dev is populated by the kernel, but is not a kernel-provided filesystem, so it had to be bind-mounted. Therefore, in practice, you'll see that mounting it using bind mounts (or otherwise) before entering the chroot works just as well (assume sudo):\nfor i in dev proc sys dev/pts\ndo\n    mount -o bind /$i chroot/$i\ndone\nchroot chroot\nfor i in dev/pts proc sys dev\ndo\n    umount -chroot/$i\ndone\n# or\nmount -o bind /dev chroot/dev\nmount -t sysfs none chroot/sys\nmount -t proc none chroot/proc\nmount -t devpts none chroot/dev/pts\nchroot chroot\nfor i in dev/pts proc sys dev\ndo\n    umount -chroot/$i\ndone\n\nRelevant reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount dev, proc, sys in a chroot environment?\n\n*Which of proc, sys etc. should be bind-mounted (or not) when chrooting into a “replacement” distribution?\n\n*Automate chroot into broken system\n\nA: you should go with simple solution like pipe:\ncat << EOF | chroot chroot\n#do something\nEOF\n\nAnything inside EOF is run inside your chrooted directory, you can also use sudo if you like:\ncat << EOF | sudo chroot chroot\nls /\nEOF\n\n\nA: Create a second script (e.g. chroot.sh) and place it in your chroot/ folder.\nNow edit the command in your original script to this:\nchroot chroot/ ./chroot.sh\n\nNow the script chroot.sh will be executed inside your chroot.\n\nA: You could create a .bashrc script or something like it, which is appended to the chroot env's /root/.bashrc, which does all the mounting etc. Aftwerwards you restore the backed up .bashrc in /root and exit the chroot:\nMain script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ncp bashrcscript chroot/root/\nif [ -a chroot/root/.bashrc ]; then\n    cp chroot/root/.bashrc chroot/root/.bashrc.bak\nfi\necho \"./bashrcscript\" >> chroot/root/.bashrc\nchroot chroot/\nrm chroot/root/.bashrc\nrm chroot/root/bashrcscript\nif [ -a chroot/root/.bashrc.bak ]; then\n    mv chroot/root/.bashrc.bak chroot/root/.bashrc\nfi\n\nbashrcscript:\nmount none -t proc /proc\nmount none -t sysfs /sys\nmount none -t devpts /dev/pts \n# Anything else you like to do\n\nThe bashrcscript will then be executed when the root console is started. Ensure it's executable.\nYou could even put the resolv.conf copying into the main script etc.\n\nA: I think it's not saying that you should put those commands into a script, but that you should type them; i.e., type the mount commands into the sudo shell.\n", "Q: The display previous/next command shortcuts doesn't work I read in some article that \nCtrl+P - to display previous command\nCtrl+N - to display next command\n\nBut in my terminal it doesn't work.

I have been using Ubuntu for some time, and I loved it! I'm feeling way more safe now. \nBut, I'm a Computer Science Student, and I have to code a lot. And I have been creating various codes, and it caused a lot of Segmentation faults, stack overflows, stack smashes, etc.\nI have been wondering, does this errors can cause any harm to the memory of the OS or creating something like a bug?\n\nA: A program runs in a especially allocated space in memory. A segfault, stack overflow, etc. happens inside this space.\nWhen you run your programs normally, these errors won't affect anything else. All these errors happen on the RAM btw., not on persistent memory.\nSo you won't compromise your computer with stuff like this.

Using nautilus I can navigate to my DCIM/Camera folder and copy the photos to my desktop.\nI wanted to automate this process, and so I wrote a script that runs after the phone has been mounted. It automatically detects the mount point (usually something like /run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=%5Busb%3A001%2C004%5D/), retrieves a list of the photos and copies them to my desktop using cp.\nI took me a long time to notice, but command line tools (like cp and md5sum) do not see the last 32 bytes of the files. When I copy the files to my desktop, the final 32 byes of all files are missing. If I take an md5sum hash of the files, the hash returned is for a file that is missing those same 32 bytes.\nI've googled a bit, and can't find anyone with a similar problem.\n\nA: I have a simple way,\nTry connect your phone with PTP and Shotwell Photo Manager has auto copy picture and videos to your computer.

It may be a pain, but you may have to back up your ubuntu install.  Reformat your first partition to ntfs, install windows, then after completed install ubuntu on the next partition then apply your backups.  This should get grub setup proper for you as well.\nIf windows is already on the first partition, then reinstalling grub should do the trick.\n\nA: this link might help you create a bootable usb and after that you can partition your disk with gparted to make space for windows, note that win7 creates a 100mb partition for boot files automatically so if your not using GPT make sure you have a max of 2 partiton already there because win7 requires 2 and mbr style partition tables allow a max of 4 primary partitions\n", "Q: No Grub2 boot manager window after installing Ubuntu 14.10 over Linux Mint 17 I have a laptop with Windows 8.1 update 1 and I installed Linux Mint 17 trough dualboot and everything worked great so when I start my laptop I get a Grub2 bootmanager window where I can choose between Windows 8.1 and Linux Mint. A couples of weeks ago there was a new update for Ubuntu (Ubuntu14.10) so I tried to install it over Linux Mint. Ubuntu 14.10 was installed and I had to reboot my laptop after that I got a message: \"Grub resque\". Finally I found a way to bypass the grub2 resque error so I could start Linux Mint 17.1 Live cd (trough usb) and installed Linux Mint 17.1 on the sda5 partition (I format Ubuntu completely). So I solved the Grub2 resque error by creating a new partition with bios_grub flag (2mb) because the previous bios_grub partition was deleted. The only problem I still get is that when I start my laptop he boots into Windows 8.1 so I have to start my laptop and push F11 for the BIOS Boot Manager and then I can choose between Windows boot manager or Ubuntu or ubuntu (when I choose Ubuntu or ubuntu the Grub boot screen appears and I can choose Linux Mint 17.1 rebecca). So the problem is I get no Grub2 boot menu when I start my laptop (also push shift doesn't works). The problem begin after installing Ubuntu 14.10 over Linux Mint 17. I tried to install Lubuntu, Kubuntu, Fedora and Linux Mint Debian Edition but everytime I start my laptop it start straight to Windows 8.1.

You can check which kernel you are running by entering uname -r, and your headers should match this version.\n", "Q: Firewall and virus software for Ubuntu 14.10 I've only used a window operating systems in my life. I just began using Ubuntu 14.10 about a week ago after my old Windows OS was corrupted.  Using Ubuntu 14.10, how does change the firewall settings?  I'm unable to locate the the old Firestarter firewall program I've read about.  Also, virus scanning software, is this necessary with Ubuntu?  I've read of a virus software called ClamAV and ClamTK, but i think i am reading from an outdated book.  Any help would be great.   \n\nA: Firewall settings in Ubuntu can be customized using Firewall Configuration Software or using command line.\nBesides if you are normal user you need not to worry about firewall, because the default settings are pretty safe. If you want to play around you can use above links.\nThere are only 100 or so viruses for linux. And changes of them to be distributed on internet is very very small, so don't be scared and keep your system up-to-date and disable autoplay from System Settings > Details > Removable Media.\nClamAV could be use to scan your files for viruses or malware, specially those files that are downloaded from downloading sites or email. Besides if you visit only popular sites (Google, youtube etc) you need not to worry about viruses. ClamAV can be sometimes used to scan windows partition.\n", "Q: Ubuntu distro upgrade - does it install new kernel? I performed a distro upgrade via apt-get and upgrade-tool from saucy 13.10 to trusty 14.04.  It seemed to go OK and the \"about\" now tells me I am running 14.04, however uname -a says I am running kernel 3.11.0-18-generic.  Was the upgrade successful?  I had expected the kernel to change to 13.13, and in fact it looks like the headers in /usr/src are for 13.3.\nThe machine works OK, however I'm trying to install a new ATI graphics driver and it fails due to incorrect kernel headers (it wants the headers for 3.11.0-18).  I have tried to install the 3.11.0-18 headers but apt seems not to be able to find them.\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: Yes, upgrading installs a new kernel. However, it seems as though the old kernel is still installed (the currently running kernel won't be automatically removed on upgrade), and for some reason you are still running it. Did you do a full reboot? Is the old kernel set as the default in grub? You can reboot, select the new kernel at the grub menu, remove all the old kernels, and the install the new graphics driver.\n\nA: I know the issue, but I'm not sure the reasoning.  First the reasoning, I think the upgrade process will not automatically install the latest generic kernel, since Ubuntu is designed to run on multiple kinds of devices, which require different kernels.\nKernel upgrades are handled by having the proper kernel meta package installed.  It might be that somehow that package got uninstalled.  \nFor a typical desktop, which is one running x86 architecture, here is the fix: sudo apt-get install linux-generic\nThat will install the latest kernel and associated header files, which should set you up proper to install your graphics driver.\n", "Q: Why “which” returns none on some commands I can run? I used which to tell the location of a runnable file. For example, which pwd returns /bin/pwd. However, I found which alias or which compgen etc returns nothing. \nWhat are commands like alias? Aren't they executable files on my Linux? I am using bash 4.3 on Ubuntu.\n\nA: \nI found which alias or which compgen etc returns nothing. \n\nBoth of those are shell builtins.  which knows nothing of shell builtins: it simply searches a path for executables.\nFor a more reliable result, use type.\n$ type compgen\ncompgen is a shell builtin\n$ type alias\nalias is a shell builtin\n\ntype has better knowledge of what executes because it is a shell builtin.\nWhy which is unreliable\nwhich often gives the wrong answer.  Observe:\n$ type pwd\npwd is a shell builtin\n$ which pwd\n/bin/pwd\n\nWhen you run pwd, without specifying an explicit path, the shell will execute its builtin, not the executable that which found.\nHere are more examples of which giving the wrong answer:\n$ type echo\necho is a shell builtin\n$ which echo\n/bin/echo\n$ type [\n[ is a shell builtin\n$ which [\n/usr/bin/[\n\nObserve:\n$ type /bin/echo\n/bin/echo is /bin/echo\n\nWhen you give an explicit path for echo, such as /bin/echo, then the shell would run that executable, not its builtin.  type knows that also, as you can see above.\nHow which works internally\nOn debian-like systems, which is a simple shell script,  The relevant part of which is:\n   for ELEMENT in $PATH; do\n    if [ -z \"$ELEMENT\" ]; then\n     ELEMENT=.\n    fi\n    if [ -f \"$ELEMENT/$PROGRAM\" ] && [ -x \"$ELEMENT/$PROGRAM\" ]; then\n     puts \"$ELEMENT/$PROGRAM\"\n     RET=0\n     [ \"$ALLMATCHES\" -eq 1 ] || break\n    fi\n   done\n\nAs you can see, it does a simple search along the PATH for an executable file of the name given.\n\nA: I think this is because there is not a program/file called alias or compgen, etc. They may be just keywords that BASH as a language interpreter knows.\nYou can think BASH is a porgram and alias is just a name of method in that program. \n", "Q: Installed Flash plugin version 13 - video still not working I just installed Ubuntu Gnome 14.10 Utopic Unicorn and I updated the Flash plugin to version 13. I checked Firefox \"add-ons\" and visited http://tsn.ca and http://ufc.com. Both websites claimed that I \"needed to install Flash.\"\nThe bottom line: I can't stream live video. YouTube works fine.\n\nA: I've dealt with this before. There appears to be a difference between the Flash plugin that is installed within the browser, and the one that works better.\n(This also seems to resolve the issue of videos spontaneously stopping and restarting themselves in Firefox and Chrome.)\nI recommend using Synaptic to check this, but the instructions below are for the terminal...as you probably don't need me telling you what to click in Synaptic, ha ha.\nsudo apt-get remove flashplugin-installer\n\nThat removes the rather glitchy version that gets parked in the browser when you install from the Adobe Flash website.\nsudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin\n\n(For the record, that one is version 11. Version 13 is not yet available for Firefox, as user7134 correctly stated.)\nThat installs the plugin, which works a LOT better. That's the only one I have installed on my Ubuntu 14.14 system, and Firefox and Chrome are quite happy.\n", "Q: check status of services and daemons I installed some services such as ntpdate and reportbug. How I can check their status and start/stop them?\nThese don't work with service commands.\n\nA: I think you should check this link..\nCheck The Link\nAnd for stopping and Starting we use service command--\nservice SCRIPT COMMAND [OPTIONS]\nservice --status-all\n\nservice --help | -h | --version\n\nservice runs a System V init script in as predictable environment as possible, removing most environment variables and with current working directory set to /.\nThe SCRIPT parameter specifies a System V init script, located in /etc/init.d/SCRIPT. The supported values of COMMAND depend on the invoked script, service passes COMMAND and OPTIONS it to the init script unmodified. All scripts should support at least the start and stop commands. As a special case, if COMMAND is --full-restart, the script is run twice, first with the stop command, then with the start command.\nservice --status-all runs all init scripts, in alphabetical order, with the status command.\nlike in Case of ntp--\nsudo service ntp stop\nsudo service ntp start\nsudo service ntp restart\nsudo service ntp status\n\n\nA: ntpdate is not a service, it is a command line utility, so it naturally does not work with the service command. I have not used reportbug, but I think it is also just a command line utility, not a service.\nEDIT: BTW, if you want a service that synchronizes time, then you are looking for ntp, not ntpdate. ntpd is a real service and it can be controlled using the standard service xyz start/stop/status commands.\n", "Q: The apache2 configtest failed.

This has resulted in a dangling symlink /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/nagios3.conf. You should be able to confirm if it is dangling using the ls command.\nIf it is dangling indeed, then just rm /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/nagios3.conf and then apache should work as expected.

I have heard that Proxy Support in Trasmission has been removed as of version 2.12. Is it possible to use proxy by any other method?\n\nA: TL;DR: http_proxy environment variable works for at least 2.92.\nFor versions 1.4.x and older see configuration options here or below.\nCitation from transmission wiki page:\n\nTransmission uses the libcurl library for http- and https-based tracker announces and scrapes. Transmission doesn't support proxies, but libcurl itself honors a handful of environment variables to customize its proxy behavior.\n\nrelevant variables start here here. And in CURLOPT_PROXY description there is this:\n\nlibcurl respects the proxy environment variables named http_proxy,\n  ftp_proxy, sftp_proxy etc. If set, libcurl will use the specified\n  proxy for that URL scheme. So for a \"FTP://\" URL, the ftp_proxy is\n  considered. all_proxy is used if no protocol specific proxy was set.\n\nI run transmission-daemon using systemd, so I just add line\n\nEnvironment=http_proxy=http://proxy_url:proxy_port\n\nto service configuration using\n\nsudo systemctl edit transmission-daemon.service\n\nand all worked.\nI have transmission-daemon 2.92.

Consider the following QML snippet:\nListView {\n    //...\n\n    footer: Text {\n        text: \"Sample Text\"\n    }\n}\n\nThis will display the text \"Sample Text\" directly at the bottom of the ListView.

I've had it for about a year now and have had no problem whatsoever. A few nights ago, out of nowhere and while I was in the middle of working on my windows machine, I saw Ubuntu (which is running on a 2nd monitor) crash. Basically the screen went black, tons of text appeared and disappeared before I could read any of it.\nAfter a restart it asked me to check the file system and then it boot up to a login screen I've never seen before, as I always had it log in automatically.

The following advice either does not work in 14.04, or if it does I've not figured out how to manage it.  So far only two of the 50 or so people I support have upgraded to 14.04 or higher, and they seem to be getting by, okay, but I have yet to see the advantage, and I dread having to figure out how to fix it if they run into a problem like yours.\nWhat I'm about to suggest may or may not fix the problem to your satisfaction, if at all, but it may yield critical information for solving the actual problem.\nNext time you are at the pre-login screen, where the default kernel is listed at the top, select the menu choice \"Previous Linux versions\" and then open one of those, preferably fairly recent.\nMy assumption here is that your inexplicable failure may have been due to a kernel change which was unfortunately incompatible with your virtual machine.  I realize VM's are supposed to cater to an operating system's every whim, but what if it was configured one way, and then the kernel changed?\nI've only seen this one time and on a Toshiba laptop which was straight up, and not a VM.  It was extremely frustrating to solve in so much as I was never entirely able to solve it, but merely restore useful function of the computer with some annoyance for its owner.  To this day the owner has to select that menu choice every time in order just to boot the computer.

When I manually change language with this indicator, this also have no effect with layouts.\nThis problem seems to be solved with just running setxkbmap after logging in:\n$ setxkbmap -option \"grp:caps_toggle,grp_led:scroll,compose:ralt\" -layout us,ru\n\nSo I mentioned this problem just as I think, it can be linked with the real one.\nSecondly, when I attach my laptop to the external keyboard, I have different layouts on these keyboards: if I push the same button on different keyboards, I have different symbols.\nAnd finally and most annoying, when I use IntelliJ IDEA, I can't use any shortcuts, containing letters. And that applies only to internal keyboard. Of course, I tried changing layout multiple times.\nHow can I fix that?\n\nA: If I don't mind the first problem, I may get rid of the second and the third: just turning off any Gnome-based layout features (set one language) and use just setxkbmap.\nSo, the final solution would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off embedded solutions for layout switching and set only one input language (English).\n\n*add setxkbmap -option \"grp:caps_toggle,grp_led:scroll,compose:ralt\" -layout us,ru entry to Menu -> Startup Applications\n", "Q: Thinkpad x201 tablet touchscreen not recognized xsetwacom --list devices\n\ngives me nothing, however, on Windows7 touch-screen and stylus works fine.

First: \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThe first command updates the package index, and the second upgrades any packages you have installed.\nThen install your package using dpkg -i <packagename>. Then do:\nsudo apt-get -f install \nsudp dpkg -a --configure\n\nThe first command goes out and looks for the dependencies and installs/upgrades them, and the second one continues the installation of your package (this is usually done by the first command anyways).\nIf you are getting errors, please copy and paste the exact commands you have used and the exact output you see. In your comment on the other answer, you mentioned you're not getting \"unmet dependencies\", so please clarify your question again and state exactly what you want to do.\n\nA: Run the following command in the terminal\nsudo apt-get -f install\nIt will install any dependencies that are missing.\n", "Q: unable to install twilio python module in ubuntu 14.10 , When I tried to install twilio module on my system by ...\nanupam@JAZZ:~$ sudo pip install twilio\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/pip\", line 5, in <module>\n    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 2876, in <module>\n    working_set = WorkingSet._build_master()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 451, in _build_master\n    return cls._build_from_requirements(__requires__)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 464, in _build_from_requirements\n    dists = ws.resolve(reqs, Environment())\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 639, in resolve\n    raise DistributionNotFound(req)\npkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: pip==1.5.4\n\nI am not getting the errors,, how would I resolve it??\n\nA: Try the following command\nsudo easy_install pip==1.5.4\nThen, install twilio with\nsudo pip install twilio\n", "Q: cannot add memtest86 in Grub menu I had already seek solution in:\nHow can I add the Memtest86+ options back to the Grub menu?\nMemtest86+ options are missing in Grub menu\nHowever, they still can't solve my problem...\nwhat drives me crazy most is the command \"update-grub\" only shows like below, and memtest86 is missing:\nGenerating grub configuration file ...\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-35-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-35-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-32-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-32-generic\nAdding boot menu entry for EFI firmware configuration\nFound memdisk: /boot/memdisk\nImagepath /boot/images not found\ndone\n\ni tried manually execute /etc/grub.d/20_memtest86 and found it printed nothing..\nbut i think it should print some code so that it can modify grub.cfg, right?\nit there anyone have solution?\nthanks a lot!!\n\nA: Memtest86+ does not work in UEFI mode because it is a 16-bit program.

You can place all settings in a little folder named \"Settings\".\n\nWhisker Menu\n\nIn Utopic (and I suspect earlier), the XFCE Whisker menu has a high-level system. While it is not quite Zeitgeist[citation-needed], it does most of the things that Zeitgeist-enabled menus do. However, it does not seem to be able to search files yet.\n\nMy take on XFCE\n\nXFCE isn't really an environment like Unity or KDE or E23 or whatever you do. XFCE is more of a creation kit. It gives you a base environment, and it's your job to custom-tailor it for what you want. XFCE isn't meant to be kept in its current state. XFCE is meant to be customized for the user. You choose the display manager. You choose the window manager. You choose the search provider. All you get when you install XFCE is a demo environment as to what XFCE can do. It's your responsibility to make it how you want it. XFCE truly is open-for-customization software.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 12.04 LTS only boots after crash I am having troubles with my Kubuntu 12.04 LTS installation:\nIf system has shutdown properly before I start the computer, the boot process crashes after the bootloader.\nThe last output of the boot process is:\nStarting network connection manager\nStarting Bluetooth daemon\nSkipping profile in /etc/apparmor.d/disable: usr.sbin.rsyslogd\nStarting mDNS/DNS-SD daemon\nStarting AppArmor profiles\n\nWhen I then reset the computer it boots without a problem, but the problem above appears again if I restart it normally. It was also started correctly after I performed a system crash with sysrq  c.\nThe setup is an Itel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2637 v2 @3.50GHz with 4 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 Ti.\nI have installed the NVIDIA drivers (which changed nothing about the problem) and put 'nomodeset' as a permanent boot option.\nHow does Grub or the entire boot process behave differently after a system crash than after a normal shutdown?\nAnd what can I do to change this behavior so that it will start correctly all the time?\n\nA: The problem turned out to be a hardware problem.\nI followed this manual to adjust the blacklist.conf file:\nhttp://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Resolve_mei:_Init_hw_failure_or_mei:_initialization_failed\nNow the PC boots fine everytime.\n", "Q: Best way to update files on production server from development server I am developing a website for my own company. To do so I have 2 servers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Server 1: a development server where I upload and test files. I use Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 to put and get files I am working on; I myself work on MAC OS;\n\n*Server 2: a production server where accepted files are put into production\n\n\nBoth servers run Ubuntu 14.04.\nI recently looked into creating a debian package on the development server. I followed this guide to create one. It seemed to go well and all except that I don't want my package to be grabbed by everyone on the internet by putting it on the Ubuntu public package archive.\nThis package should contain all the php/javascript/stylesheet files I created and tested on Server 1. On the production server (Server 2) I was hoping on the possibility to apt-get install my-package-name once a new feature on Server 1 is fully tested and accepted. I understand that this is only possible with packages uploaded to the Ubuntu archive. \nMy question therefor is: it possible to create a private archive/repository so that I can apt-get install my package on the production server from the development server? Or is there a different and/or better way to update the files on the production server after testing?\n\nA: You can certainly create your own apt repository and configure your production server ot use it. You do NOT need to post your debs in a public ppa (i.e., Ubuntu archive).\nThis wki page gives you the basic steps to create a deb repository and how to update it when you put new versions of packages in it.\nThe guide is about creating a local, disk-based repository. In your case I would guess you want to make it available for remote consumption - you can do that by just exposing the directory in apache2.\n\nA: I would use a something like git. That way you can have separate branches for production and development, once you are happy, merge the development branch in to production, and then git pull\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29\n", "Q: Compose key stopped working (Xubuntu 14.04) I'm running Xubuntu 14.04 with an Apple USB QWERTY keyboard.

When I check in the terminal which GPU I am using it says \"i915\" instead of \"nvidia\".\n\nA: *\n\n*Uninstall the NVIDIA proprietary graphics driver. Find the file you used to install the NVIDIA graphics driver from the NVIDIA website. It's in whatever folder you downloaded it to (your Downloads folder, for example). It should be named something like NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.58.run. If so, the command to uninstall it is:\nsudo ~/Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.58.run --uninstall  \nsudo reboot \n\nIf the NVIDIA-Linux-x86-XXX.XX.run file has a different name or location, then change the name and/or location in the above command. The name and location of the .run file in the above command have to match exactly to the name and location of the .run file that is in your computer.\n\n*Run the following command to identify the recommended NVIDIA proprietary graphics driver:\nubuntu-drivers devices  \n\n\n*Install the recommended NVIDIA proprietary graphics driver and reboot. \n\n*NVIDIA Prime is a way of adding hybrid graphics support to your laptop. NVIDIA Prime allows the user to switch between NVIDIA (Performance Mode) and Intel (Power Saving Mode) graphics from the NVIDIA Settings utility. \nIf your computer has an NVIDIA 319 or more recent graphics driver installed, run the following command to install NVIDIA Prime packages:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-settings nvidia-prime  \n\nThen NVIDIA Prime can be enabled/disabled from the NVIDIA X Server Settings application.  \n \n\nA: I found a solution in this post: https://askubuntu.com/a/557395/321613\nThis works well for me, as I have an Axus UX303LN with Nvidia GT840M graphic card.\n", "Q: Removing Ubuntu from a default O.S when starting PC I have installed ubuntu alongside windows, on starting it, the computer starts in Ubuntu. I would want to have the option of selecting which operating system to use. \n\nA: Open and edit sudo gedit /etc/default/grub.\nYou will see the following contents:\n\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10 \nYou can change the GRUB_DEFAULT from 0 to any number, corresponding to the entry in the GRUB bootup menu (first entry is 0, second is 1, etc.)\nSet the value of the GRUB_TIMEOUT as 10 seconds if it has not been set. You can force the grub menu to show by commenting out the two GRUB_HIDDEN lines with a # at the beginning of the line.\nAfter saving the changes, run\nsudo update-grub\n\nA: In Ubuntu, open a Terminal and enter sudo nano /etc/default/grub.\nNow you should see a line which says GRUB_TIMEOUT=0, meaning it'll wait 0s to boot the default OS. Set this to another value, e.g. 10 and save with Ctrl+O, exit with Ctrl+X.\nNow apply the changes with sudo update-grub.\n", "Q: Virtualbox fullscreen mode stops working after update I got Ubuntu 14.04 installed in VirtualBox. I installed the guest additions and GNOME 3, and everything was working. \nNow, Ubuntu's software manager popped up and notified me that updates were available, so I installed them. I restarted the system and now two things have started to happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fullscreen has stopped working View -> Switch to fullscreen.\n\n*I am getting a memory error sometimes when shutting down. The status under the Virtualbox manager is reporting that the process of shutting down the system was aborted. \n\n\nHas anyone else had this problem after installing the OS updates? I've been looking around the forums, but I cannot seem to find anything that is exactly the same.\n\nA: I had this same problem.  Here are my notes on how I resolved it. It comes from the vbox manual chapter 4 paragraph 4.2.2.1\n\nBe sure to install DKMS before installing the Linux Guest Additions.\n  If DKMS is not available or not installed, the guest kernel modules\n  will need to be recreated manually whenever the guest kernel is\n  updated using the command /etc/init.d/vboxadd setup as root. \n\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms\n\nAnswer Y to question.\n\nA: You can also install all the guest additions packages from the repositories, that way each time you perform an kernel update, the corresponding modules will be automatically recreated:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-x11\n\n", "Q: Mouse is trapped after standby/suspend System: ~$ uname -r\n3.13.0-39-generic (Ubuntu 14.04 64 Bit)\nAfter executing suspend my Lenovo Thinkpad T430 (Intel HD 4000 graphics) normally went into standby.

The top menu is visible.\nAbnormal behaviour\nGo to terminal, type: gedit.  Then the top menu is invisible. (Problem persists even when sending to bg)\nAdditional info:\nI noticed when I do a gksudo gedit, that the menu appears below the menu bar of the window instead of the top menu…\nMore additional info:\nI just found the culprit: X11-forwarding.  The \"abnormal\" behaviour stops when I remove export $(dbus-launch) from my bash.bashrc file.\nDoes anyone have a clue how to bring abnormal back to normal? (keeping x11-forwarding?)  I've looked everywhere, but except for a bug on the preferences not showing, I found no solutions to this problem…\n\nA: I found the answer after all:\nIf you're using X11 forwarding, don't forget to look at the ~/.config/ for the user actually running gedit!  Not the ~/.config/ of the user that the application is displayed in!\nIn this particular case, deleting the ~/.config/gedit solved this particular problem as gedit just recreates it afterwards. (dumb me: I should have renamed it and looked what the differences were, so I could have posted the perfect answer, but at the time, I was trying to solve another problem)\n\nOriginal answer:\nToo bad no one found any answer, so I'll post my own work-arounds as a \"solution\"\n(I know though they're not really \"solutions\"; they're just \"work-arounds\")\n\n*\n\n*Use the toolbar for the most-often used commands.\n\n*Use the Keyboard short-cuts:\nAs the only menu-item I'm really missing from the toolbar is \"File - Save As\", I just press Alt+F and the menu seems to be coming out of the system menu when using this workaround.

And I absolutely love it. I have it indexed all my journals, ebooks, pictures, videos and also a wild bunch of pdf's from all over the internet. Topics spanning from movie reviews to computer algorithms and mediterranean recipes. Infact, for me recoll has kind of replaced google in the sense that .. I search my local instance of recoll first and only when I don't get anything relevant, I open up google in a new tab and start searching..\nThe only problem is .. I'm still not sure how well to search using recoll. I went through the documentation and it is a bit confusing. I mean it supports a rich query syntax and all.\nSo I was wondering if anyone has any idea of how to effectively search using recoll? What modifiers can I use and such? And what exactly do all those modifiers mean? There is 'l', 'p', 'o' and a few others. Some of these modifiers support appending numbers to them like 'o10' for instance. The documentation is not very clear about what exactly that means. Sometimes, it seems like turning off 'stemming' gives me better results. But I'm not exactly sure.\nCould someone more enlightened, enlighten me? Thanks\n\nA: I suppose that you did have a look at this manual section and that it was not clear enough ?\nhttp://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.SEARCH.LANG.MODIFIERS\nStemming is the operation which turns a derived term like \"floors\", \"flooring\" into a base one (the stem): floor. This means that searching for \"floors\" will also find texts which only contain \"floor\". Sometimes, this is undesirable, so Recoll lets you turn it off either by capitalizing the term (\"Floors\"), or by using the 'l' modifier.\nNormally, a double quoted input to Recoll tells it to look for the input terms in the order given, without any intermediate terms. Searching for \"first second\" (actually double quoted in the entry) will not find texts only containing [second first] or [first a second]\nA double-quoted entry can be turned into a \"proximity search\" by adding a 'p' modifier. \"first second\"p will find texts containing [first second] but also ones containing [second first], but not any only containing [first a second] or [second a first].\nThe o modifier lets you specify that some intervening terms may appear. For example \"first second\"o1 will match both [first second] and [first a second]\nFor most queries, you don't need this stuff at all, but sometimes, they can make the difference between finding hundred of uninteresting results and finding just the one you want.\n", "Q: How to turn off nvidia (hybrid graphics) I have a big problem, which prevents me from using Kubuntu 14.04 as my default system.

I do not want to play with the kubuntu anyway and my laptop is constantly very hot, the fan running a lot and the battery live is only halve compared to win7. \nSo it would be the easiest solution to just turn nvidia off instead of messing around with switching between the two cards(bumblebee etc. which already has lead to great problems and a reinstall). \nI would really appreciate some help, because until now I am not able to use kubuntu all the time and am afraid it will melt the cpu one day.\n\nA: I've been struggling repeatedly on my Asus N55S with an NVidia GT 635M. Especially after the upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04. NVidia is just so evil with the Linux community and its drivers are a well known pain in the neck... Here is what I did:\nsudo apt-get install bbswitch-dkms\n\nthen \ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nand add the following lines\n# Blacklist the alternative nvidia module \nblacklist nouveau\n# Blacklist the original nvidia module \nblacklist nvidia\n\nthen \n$ gksudo gedit /etc/modules\n\nand add the following lines\n# Switch off discrete GPU \nbbswitch load_state=0\n\nat last update the initial ramdisk by running\n$ sudo update-initramfs -u\n\n\nA: Thank you for the hint with the proprietary driver. It saved my kubuntu experience. \nWith nvidia version 340 it works perfectly. Furthermore I figured out there was no option in nvidia x server settings menu to switch between the two shown after installing, but you can do it via terminal:\nwith    prime-select query you can see, which one is currently running.\nwith    sudo prime-select intel  you can turn on the intel card.\nwith    sudo prime-select nvidia the other one.\n\nA: There should be such an option in the bios.\nOtherwise you can install the proprietary driver and under the nvidia control panel you can select which chipset you want to use. Select the Intel one.\n", "Q: Can I make Apache more secure by removing read access from the others group? It says in the Apache documentation security tips to set your server root directory and sub-directories to be owned by root, with a group of root and to not be writeable by non-root users. However it also says to change the mode to 755 which gives read access to others. So, as an admin, I can create a new user who by default can access the Apache configuration files. Wouldn't it be more secure to change the mode to 750? Apart from the inconvenience of having to sudo in order to view the files is there any other disadvantage to doing this? \n\nA: The location where config files for Apache are stored in Ubuntu by default, is already only writeable by the root user. The files however, must be readable by non-root, as the httpd daemon does not run as root.\n", "Q: Bash: what is the meaning of ${parameter##word} I'm working on bash code and I found a function CheckOtherFiles that I guess is used to check if a file ($1) is more recent from file $WS_ROOT/$NomeVista/COMP/COMP_COMPILE.\nCheckOtherFiles is called with one parameter that is a file with absolute path.\nHere is the code: \nfunction CheckOtherFiles {\n   fver=$1\n   if [[ -r $fver ]]\n   then\n      if [[ -r $WS_ROOT/$NomeVista/COMP/COMP_COMPILE ]]\n      then\n         filecheck=`/bin/ls -1t $fver $WS_ROOT/$NomeVista/COMP/COMP_COMPILE | head -1`\n         if [[ ${filecheck##*/} = ${fver##*/} ]]\n         then\n            return 1\n         fi\n      fi\n   fi\n   return 0\n}\n\nI read bash manual and found this useful link, but it is unclear the meaning of:\n   if [[ ${filecheck##*/} = ${fver##*/} ]]\n\nI also doubt that there is an error in it.\nSo, could you please help me understanding the meaning of this piece of code?\nAlso I really appreciate any suggestion to improve this function. \n\nA: As answered in the linked question, this is substring removal:\n${string##substring}\n   Deletes longest match of $substring from front of $string.\n\nIn this case, it is removing the path and retaining only the basename:\n$ FILE=/etc/default/google-chrome\n$ echo ${FILE##*/}\ngoogle-chrome\n$ basename $FILE\ngoogle-chrome\n\nOrdinarily, I'd stick to basename, but it's a matter of opinion whether write-only code is better if it is faster.

For that purpose, I have a machine with 32 GB RAM and a Xeon e3v2 with 4 cores (8 threads). So far I've managed to get MAAS and Juju up and running, but I'm not sure about the number of virtual nodes I can safely deploy (and the CPU / RAM overcommit ratio, although I've read somewhere that the physical CPU can handle overcommitting with 1-vcpu-machines pretty well).\nCurrently, the VM that runs MAAS uses 1 vCPU and 8 GB RAM, Juju runs on the host. That leaves me with 7 vCPUs and 24 GB RAM without overcommiting any resources. What I've come up with is the following:\n\n*\n\n*1 Controller node: 2vCPUs, 4GB RAM - RabbitMQ, mysql, keystone, dashboard, cinder, nova-cloud-controller and glance in lxc containers\n\n*2 Ceph nodes: 1 vCPU, 4GB RAM each - ceph\n\n*2 Compute nodes: 2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM each - nova-compute\n\n*1 Network node: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM - quantum-gateway\n\n*Plus the MAAS host: 1 vCPU, 8GB RAM\n\nThis would result in a total of 38 GB RAM and 10 vCPUs, so I'm overcommiting a little.\nMy actual question is if anyone has a better architecture in mind. I really just plan to show some features of OpenStack (or clouds in general).\n\nA: I have a similar setup, and let me suggest to your configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reduce the amount of RAM assigned to MAAS, around 2GB will be enough.\n\n*Add another ceph node, this will help you to demonstrate resilience when using ceph and 1 node goes down.\n\n*Overcommit in CPU isn't that bad, but you don't want to overcommit in memory, because the system will start swapping and everything will get unusable performance.\n\n*Something you don't mention is the disks you have, this is a huge bottleneck for me, I have 2 x 7200 RPMs disks with btrfs (raid0), but it isn't enough while the juju is deploying.\n\n*Also you may want to use juju-deployer and tweak the command line you use to deploy, specifically timeout modifiers and '-s' which is a delay between each \"juju deploy\" call.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\nFelipe,\n\nA: I suggest you dump it if its still running and use LXD.  You should have no issues deploying this without MaaS and just running Juju with local control of your local LXD as described here.  Your machine should be able to run it without sweating too much.  If you require MaaS to demonstrate it (It really is pretty awesome.  You should try to check out the Openstack Roadshows that Canonical does if one comes nearby...) then it gets a bit more complicated.  \nThis reference demonstrates setting it up on 3 machines, but you can get sneaky and deploy Juju and MaaS to the same other machine if you really need to.  If your second machine was running MaaS and JuJu under LXD with the bridge connected to your lab LAN and your PXE traffic could get through you should be able to run it all in containers on two machines.  I am attempting to do something similar with VMWare Fusion VMs on my laptop where I have bridged the internal network out to a thunderbolt NIC to allow the MaaS and Juju machines to orchestrate Raspberry Pi and NUC devices.\n\nA: I do not have experience using juju for openstack orchestration, but from experience with ceph and openstack, for demo purposes you can run ceph on 2GB machines w/o problems and I think that the maas host can also be configured with 6GB instead of 8.\nI do not know if juju allows you to combine different roles in the same VM, in our (non-juju) deployments we combine the controller and the network roles on the same VM (not using containers).\n\nA: When using physical nodes in a small cluster, especially test-lab-type-stuff, one typical shortcut is to combine the ceph-nodes with your compute-nodes.  See this ceph-0.48-era set of instructions for debian, or this more modern lab config for proxmox VE.\nUsing the numbers you provided, and the suggestions for ram-decreases plus triple-ceph in the other answers, perhaps something like this:  \n\n\n*\n\n* 3vCpu + 8gb == RabbitMQ/keystone/glance/etc + cephMon1/Osd1 \n\n* 2vCpu + 10gb == novaComp2/Net2/Vol2 + cephMon2/Osd2/Httpd2/Rgw2 \n\n* 2vCpu + 10gb == novaComp3/Net3 + cephMon3/Osd3 \n\n* 1vCpu + 2gb == novaQuantum4 \n\n* 1vCpu + 3gb == MAAS_host5 \n\n\nI'm currently working on a one-node config of this nature myself, but have less RAM available, and only four disks to devote (cephOsd is better with multiple disks).  I cannot confirm the numbers above will function for you with adequate performance, not having tried this scheme myself, but the core idea of merging somewhat-orthogonal nodes to be parsimonious with vCpu&ram may give you enough traction to get where you want to go.\np.s.

I plan to turn my fanless HTPC completely silent, exchanging the current HDD for a silent runner.

My question is whether there is any noticeable difference in performance, in case if I install a light Ubuntu flavour OS on a flash drive rather than on a SSD.\nMy thoughts is that since I will not be doing any heavy reading/writing to the disk, once the OS and XBMC is loaded into RAM, I cannot see why differences in read/write speed (as pointed to here) would play a role. Another SE answer notes that the wear on a non-SSD flash drive is a significant issue, even from temporary logs etc. So perhaps I should go for a Ubuntu favour which minimise log writing (temporary writing to RAM etc), whichever that may be.\nAre there other issues I have not considered which would give a performance difference here?\n\nA: Your intuition is correct, there should not be a significant performance problem in the case of an XBMC box. If you think about it, this is almost exactly what the Raspberry Pi does, although technically it uses an SD card rather than a USB drive.\n", "Q: Uninstalling hadoop on Ubuntu 14.04, files/directories left over I'm trying to completely uninstall Hadoop on my Ubuntu partition (14.04 Trusty Tahr) and am running into an issue I haven't seen before. I completely removed the directory that hadoop was installed to and the hadoop user's home directory. I also deleted the user and tried to delete the group but bash said the group didn't exist (although it told me that the group wouldn't have any more members in it once I deleted the user, thought that was wierd).\nNow, when trying to find any remaining directories or hadoop-related files - I get the following.\n$ locate hadoop\n/home/hadoop\n/opt/hadoop\n/opt/hadoop-2.5.1\n$ cd /home/hadoop\nbash: cd: /home/hadoop: No such file or directory\n$ cd /opt/hadoop\nbash: cd: /opt/hadoop: No such file or directory\n$ cd /opt\n$ ls -laF\ntotal 24\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root     root     4096 Nov 19 09:54 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x 23 root     root     4096 Oct  5 23:59 ../\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 clickpkg clickpkg 4096 Jun 29 23:44 click.ubuntu.com/\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 jxb      jxb      4096 Nov  4 23:36 eclipse/\ndrwxr-xr-x  5      501 staff    4096 Mar 18  2014 LightTable/\ndrwxrwxr-x  9     2000     2000 4096 Mar 18  2014 scala/\n\nIt says there is still some hadoop left on my system but I can't find it.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no hadoop directory or file in my /home or /opt directories. What does the above mean?\n\n*How can I be sure that I removed the hadoop group?\n\n\nA: locate is not looking directly in the filesystem, it uses a database (or more than one).  The database is updated using the updatedb command, which is usually scheduled as a daily cron job.\nSo I guess in this case, what you are seeing is the indexed information from yesterday. Once the updatedb cron job completes, you should not see these anymore.\nYou could run find / -name \"*hadoop* instead, as find looks directly in the filesystem. Since it does the search when you run it, it will take some time to complete.\nAs for the hadoop group, you can run sudo grep hadoop /etc/group, if it does not show anything, then the group has been removed. \n\nA: You can uninstall hadoop completely using:\nsudo apt-get purge hadoop-2.5.1\n\nThis purge command will remove all packages and configurations related to hadoop from your system.\n", "Q: Configuring youtube-dl I want to configure youtube-dl, that it downloads only audio files in mp3. and in its help it shows the following line:\n   You  can  configure  youtube-dl by placing default arguments (such as\n   --extract-audio --no-mtime to always extract the audio and  not  copy\n   the     mtime)     into     /etc/youtube-dl.conf    and/or    ~/.con‐\n   fig/youtube-dl.conf.\"\n\nBUT in my etc folder is no youtube-dl.conf file, nor is one in the .config folder (im a bloody greenhorn, took me 15 minutes to find the .config folder..)\ncan anyone help me to configurate youtube-dl?\nbtw.: I already made it to download the files in mp3 by manual command, but I need to type the commands after every download :/\nI have ubuntu 13..... 10? I think? 13. something for sure =) thanks!\n\nA: You need to create the config file yourself, it's not created by installation of the program.\nJust save from your editor to  ~/.config/youtube-dl.conf (note no dash in .config).\nThe system-wide default configuration file, /etc/youtube-dl.conf, could be created by installing, but is not. That's not a problem, as the file format is not complicated, so an example file is not important.\n\nNot sure what exactly you are doing, but if it's about repeating the download command with a different url, try using the shell history, pressing Up to recall the command, and edit the file name.\n(To show your Ubuntu version, use lsb_release -a)\n\nA: i made an \"executable\" for downloading musics from youtube ...\nmy ubuntu 14.10 also does not show up those config files, so what this does is basically executing the cmd for youtube-dl (instead of strange names it uses only what shows up on youtube, without the link in the end) , converts to mp3 and discards video.\nto use this you need to:\n\ncreate a file: (terminal -> touch download.sh)\npaste this:\n#!/bin/bash\n#youtube to mp3 downloader\nyoutube-dl -o '%(title)s.mp4' --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 $1\nmv *.mp3 ~/Music/\n\nterminal again: chmod +x download.sh\nto download simply do: sh download.sh link\n\nex: sh download.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trolololololol\n\nas it's now executable, you can also do ./download.sh link, your choice ;)\n\nPs , i'm assuming the creation path as your home (~/download.sh), so when you open terminal, it's where you should be able to execute it ...\nCheers\n", "Q: corrupted bootable usb stick I was making a bootable usb(using unetbootin) stick for kali-linux but the process was interupted before it finished and now the usb stick is read-only and can neither format it nor change the permision. your help will be appreciated.\n\nA: First wipe away the MBR with dd.

(14.04) Yesterday I temporarily took the password requirement off my login account (the only account on the machine). I then later tried to re-enable it. The password took (it works when I use sudo for instance), but it is not required to log in, even though I have checked that option in user settings. How do I make the password required again for login access?\nI should also note that the lock screen isn't working, it appears to immediately lock then unlock.\nI have tried setting it to no password, then setting a password again.\nI recently upgraded to 14.04 from Precise.\n\nA: I finally solved this myself. Even though I had set \"Automatic Login\" to off and had set a user password in System Settings -> User Accounts, it had failed to properly set the flags in /etc/gshadow and /etc/group. To check and see if it is set properly, do in terminal:\nsudo grep nopasswd /etc/gshadow\n\nwhich should return something like:\nnopasswdlogin:!::\n\nand\nsudo grep nopasswd /etc/group\n\nreturning:\nnopasswdlogin:x:112:\n\nInstead, mine looked like:\nnopasswdlogin:!::josh\nnopasswdlogin:x:112:josh\n\nif you see user names at the end of these lines, then you need to remove them. Any user names on these lines indicate that user can login in without a password. To remove them, just open the files in gedit and delete ONLY the user names you want to require passwords of. You can open them with:\ngksudo gedit /etc/gshadow\ngksudo gedit /etc/group\n\nOnce you delete the user names, save the files and reboot. Done!\n", "Q: copy n number of files from one folder to another folder I have  a folder of n number of files. I need to move n/2(or)n/3 files from that folder to any other folder. How to set the value of n so that it will move exact those number of files?\n\nA: You could do something like\nk=1; find source/ -type f | while read file; do\n     [[ k++ -le 20 ]] && cp \"$file\" target/ \ndone\n\nThat will find all files in the current directory and copy the first 20 it finds to target/. The trick is the $k variable which is initialized to 1. Then, the [[ k++ -le 20 ]] && cp means \"If $k plus one is less than or equal to 20, run the cp command\".\nThe above will break if your file names contain spaces or newlines or other strangeness. If that can be an issue, use this safer version instead:\nk=1; find source/ -type f -print0 | \n    while IFS= read -d '' -r file; do \n        [[ k++ -le 20 ]] && cp \"$file\" target/ \n    done\n\nIf you don't need to descend into subdirectories, just do\nk=1; for file in *; do [[ k++ -le 20 ]] && cp \"$file\" target/ ; done\n\nFinally, to calculate n on the fly, you can do (note that this will also count subdirectories)\nfiles=( * ); ## save all files in the current directory in an array\nn=$(echo \"${#files[@]} / 3 \" | bc) ## get the value of n/3\nfor file in \"${files[@]:1:$n}\"; do cp \"$file\" bar/; done\n\nThe solution above should work with arbitrary file names, even those including newlines. \n\nA: Use a combination of find, sed and xargs:\nfind /path/to/dir -print0 | sed -nz '1~2p' | xargs -0 cp --target-dir=/some/dir\n\nsed -n '1~2p' prints every alternate line, thus reducing the count to half. To make it a third, use 1~3p. The -print0, -z and -0 options indicate that we're using the \\0 (NULL) character to delimit things.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*how to reduce number of lines by half with sed \n\n*Could sed or awk use NUL character as record separator?\n\nA: To do a fraction (e.g., &frac13;) without knowing the count in advance,\nk=0; for file in *\ndo\n    if [ $((k++ % 3)) -eq 0 ]\n    then\n        mv \"$file\" target/\n    fi\ndone\nThis will grab every third file,\nby keeping a running counter (k) and acting on each file for which k is a multiple of 3. \nSince I started the counter at 0, this will round up;\ne.g., if you have ten or eleven files (or twelve), it will move four of them. \nIf there are subdirectories (or exotic files, like FIFOs) in the current directory,\nand you want to move ⅓ of the plain files, leaving the others alone, change the above to\nk=0; for file in *\ndo\n    if [ -f \"$file\" ]  &&  [ $((k++ % 3)) -eq 0 ]\n    then\n        mv \"$file\" target/\n    fi\ndone\nIf you want to descend into subdirectories, say\nshopt -s globstar\n\nand use ** instead of *. \nIf you want to include names that begin with a dot (.), you must also shopt -s dotglob.\nThe above solution should work with arbitrary file names, even those including newlines.\n", "Q: Remove Mac OS X entirely and install Ubuntu I already formatted my hard drive in my Macbook Air and installed Ubuntu. However, after installing it doesn't seem to boot. What am I missing? I created two partitions, 250GB each.\n\nA: There are two ways of installing Ubuntu on a Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Legacy Boot - Use the Mac variant of Ubuntu which you can download from here.\n\n\nInstall rEFInd before you install Ubuntu. Now, create a partition for Ubuntu using either Disk Utility or GParted and install normally. When you reboot after the installation finishes, rEFInd will load and give you an option to select either OS X or Ubuntu.\nThis is the easier method and is convenient if you are dual booting.\n\n\n*EFI Boot - Use the normal variant of Ubuntu.\n\n\nThis method is slightly tough because you will have to delete the grub partition created by the Ubuntu installer (on a FAT partition) and install grub on an HFS partition, failing which your mac will not boot. However, this method works better if you want to completely replace OS X with Ubuntu.  \nRefer to my earlier post for steps to the EFI Boot method.\n", "Q: Why won't Ubuntu Software Center let me edit my review?

Then, when the installation is complete, pop the SD card into the multi-card reader and away I go.\nThis has worked perfectly on 2 Foxconn NanoPCs with 2012 firmware, though we've recently purchased newer models, with newer firmware, and this is where the problem has appeared.\nWhen I switch from the USB card reader to the internal one, the system loses track of the SD card whilst running local-top scripts, and drops to a shell in initramfs, giving the message;\nGave up waiting for root device.  Common Problems;\n  -Boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)\n    -Check rootdelay= (did the system wait long enough?)\n    -Check root= (did the system wait for the right device?)\n  -Missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev)\nALERT!   /dev/disk/by-uuid/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX does not exist. Dropping to a shell!\n\nIt seems to me that the hardware isn't passing the UUID to the system at the point that the root filesystem is being mounted.\nIs there any way to make the initramfs point to the internal card reader, or search for the SD card by anything other than UUID? \nAlternatively, am I barking up the wrong tree, is there something else I should try?\nEDIT\nIt's just occurred to me that a major difference between the working and non working systems is that, when choosing BIOS boot options, if the SD card is in the internal reader the working system shows the name of the SD card (Generic multi-card 1.00) but in the non working systems it always shows as USB card reader 2.0. Does this suggest that it's a firmware issue?\n\nA: I have the same problem. You can identify the card by which drive it is in instead within grub.  Go to /etc/default/grub and uncomment the line to do with not using uuid. Then run 'update-grub'. It should then try to boot from /dev/sda1 for example as opposed to looking for the uuid of the card.\n", "Q: NETIS WF2120 Wifi Adapter Drops Signal Within Seconds I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Under a directory, I have a bunch of directories named Debug. How do I delete all the Debug directories?\n\nA: It's not clear --- under the directory dir_a you can have only one directory named Debug. Or are you saying that you have dir_a/Debug, dir_a/dir_b/Debug, dir_a/dir_c/Debug and so on?\nYou can list all directory named exactly Debug under the directory dir_a with: \ncd dir_a   # or whatever you need to go there\nfind . -type d -name Debug\n\nthis will list all the directories named Debug under the current directory. To delete them (double check, this IS NOT UNDOABLE): \nfind . -depth -type d -name Debug -exec rm -r {} \\; \n\n-depth will list Debug/Debug/ before Debug/ to avoid errors. \nIn detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*find . -type d -name Debug will search all directory under the current one (.) for entries which are both directory (-type d) and have the name \"Debug\" (-name Debug). \n\n*The added -depth flag make the search depth-first (it means that \"deeper\" matches are found before \"shallow\" ones). \n\n*-exec ... \\; tells find to execute the command in ... for each match. (The semicolon is quoted because otherwise the shell will interpret it). \n\n*In the command ... above, the special symbol {} is substituted by the current match.  \nSo in plain English it is: find every directory under this one which name is \"Debug\", depth first, and for each one execute the command rm -r followed by the full name of the directory.\n", "Q: Ethernet and wifi not working after package update 12.04 LTS Recently I updated some packages in my Dell vostro 2520 laptop and after that my broadcom network driver is not working.

It works fine, just that a few days ago I started seeing the screen of Ubuntu smaller (previous to that it was on full screen, and I can't recall changing anything). How can I fit it back to full screen?\nNote: When I say 'full screen' I don't mean that I don't want to see the VirtualBox's task bar, so CTRL+F is not the solution I'm looking for (with CTRL+F my screen stayed small) . CTRL+C doesn't seem to work either; it gives me a screen in the desired size, but it's distorted.\n\nA: You need to install guest additions and extension pack first\nSecond select 'view' then select 'resize to match' option\nthis will make full screen a true full screen.\nIf you need help locating any of the files let me know.\n", "Q: If I have an x64 capable CPU, but install a x86 Ubuntu distribution, can I still run 64bit executables? Also, would it be possible to install a x64 kernel, to transform it to a full 64bit installation?\n\nA: Short answer: No, a 32bit system can only execute 32bit binaries.\n\nA: you should think of 32 vs. 64 bit as if 64 Bus (mistakenly talking about processor) is like a truck that is as twice as wide than a normal truck (for 32 bit) , sure the 64 carries more cargo (data) on one trip than the normal 32 bit, so it is better if you use 64 bit OS to better benefit from hardware, the issue you mentioned is related to the way the apps are developed , the majority of 64 bit apps started as 32 bits apps that's why they have a hard time running on 64bit OS, due to it's original code base and the limitations of the porting operation\n", "Q: Multiboot ubuntu, Elementary, Windows, joint swap or sparate ones?

Make sure you backup before partitioning.\nYou can use the same Swap partition since it is used only while the OS is running. But do not hibernate one OS and then boot in another OS, because when you go back to the first one, it will not be able to wake up from hibernation.\n", "Q: How do I configure a local directory in a wine launcher? ok, so I'm trying to make a portable launcher for my wine application...\n[Desktop Entry]\nName= UMC\nType= Application\nTerminal=true\nExec= wine ~/data/Python/x86/python.exe loader.py 'x86'\nStartupNotify= true\nIcon= ~/data/UMC.ico\n\nthe '~' in my code means the current directory, which can be relocated.\nwhat could I use in place of the '~' that would do what I expect??\n\nA: Got it working with this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=UMC\nType=Application\nTerminal=true\nExec=wine ./data/Python/x86/python.exe loader.py 'x86'\nStartupNotify=true\n#Icon= ./data/UMC.ico #this one doesn't work\n\nI recently stumbled across a Ubuntu Forums thread which mentioned this.\nOn the note that I DO have it working, I'm not sure if XFCE might be lending a hand here.\nSo if this doesn't work for you, check your Desktop Environment and/or Window Manager.\n", "Q: ubuntu is trying to upgade from 14.04 to 12.10 I'm currently on 14.04 and I want to upgrade to 14.10.

All the output you show support this scenario.\nTherefore, the proposed upgrade to 12.10 is valid. However, I recommend not to run this. Once on 12.10 you'll have to go through the long process of 12.10 → 13.04 → 13.10 → 14.04 to reach a supported release. LTS → LTS+1 upgrade path is supported and is a lot quicker.

Is there a combination of the find command that can change all non-executable mime-types back to 644 instead of 755?\n\nA: You could use something like that:\nfile -F' ' --mime-type * | awk '$2 ~ /text\\/plain/{print $1}' | xargs chmod 644\n\nThis changes all permissions to 644 if a file has the mime-type text/plain. Just replace the part in the awk body to whatever mime-type you wish. See /etc/mime.types for all available ones.\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*The -F' ' flag causes file to use a space as separator between the filename and the result.

It's for you to add software that you compiled/created yourself or that is from third-parties.\nSo, /usr/local/bin is a place to put the executables (only), /usr/local/lib for libraries, /usr/local/share for architecture-independent supporting files, etc.  You can create your own directory structure in there if you like.\nAny executables in /usr/local/bin should be included in your path by default and should be executable just be typing the name of the executable.  You'll need to make sure they have the execute bit set in the file permissions.\n", "Q: Problem changing icons in ubuntu 14.04 I wanna change program icons. I previous versions I just went into /usr/share/applications and changed the icon of what I wanted. In 14.04 I repeat this and it doesn't work. Moreover, if I enter in /usr/share/applications being superuser I see that the picture has been changed, but if I enter without being superuser i see that there is no icon. \nWhat's wrong?\n\nA: The /usr/share/applications consist of .desktop files which are owned by root.\nEg :- For gedit, the default text editor.\n\nHere, the Icon field shows the name of the .png or .svg file present in /usr/share/icons\nTherefore, to change the application icon, you can either edit the .desktop file in /usr/share/applications to point to a new image by specifying its path or replace the .png or .svg file in /usr/share/icons with the icon image you wish to see.\nOnce you have done either of the above steps, refresh the icon cache using the command\ngtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/<name of icon theme>\nAlternatively, it is easier to use Main Menu or alacarte - \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Main Menu (package name is alacarte) alacarte \n\n*Open Main Menu (alacarte)\n\n*Click on a program and select Properties in the right menu.\n\n*Click on the icon\n\n*Browse for your new icon and click Open\n\n*Close your programs properties\n\n*Close Main Menu\n\nYou do not need to reboot to see the changes.\n\nA: Well, for me alacarte allowed to choose any icon, but that icon could not be shown.

That means it is simply halting the OS and stopping all CPUs. Once the system is cleanly halted, the user may safely hit the Power button on his computer manually.\nSo you can just press the power button if you want.\nHowever, to solve that you can use this command\nsudo shutdown -P now\n\nThe poweroff, shutdown -P now, and halt -p commands all do the same thing as halt alone, while additionally sending an ACPI command to signal the power supply unit to disconnect the main power. This prevents you from having to physically push the Power button on your computer.\nThat suggests you can also use this command:\nsudo poweroff\n\nor this:\nsudo halt -p\n\n\nA: It is because of your computer is not really eligible for using ubuntu or it maybe because of you are using an old and customized version of ubuntu !\nSo, Its usually seen in customized versions of ubuntu.Some Ubuntus made in Ubuntu customization kits had this trouble before with me...\nSo I did install another version of ubuntu to fix this problem.\nYou easilly upgrade if you are really using an ubuntu version....\nJust do upgrade to fix this problem.\nThis problem is just because of the Shutdown button isn't setted up currectly !\nSo try installing a fresh version of ubuntu which can be downloaded from Ubuntu.com\nIf you still face some problems then it  might be because of your system problems...\nOr you can simply try using this code :  \n% sudo grub-update\n\n(Type this code in Terminal and Press enter)\n...............................................\nIf it doesn't works, then try this :  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal emulator by Pressing Ctrl+Alt+T together.\n\n*sudo vi /etc/default/grub type this code in it and press enter !\n\n*Locate the following part in the loaded content - GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”\n\n*Add acpi=force at the end as shown here: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash acpi=force”\n\n*Save and exit using :wq  \n\n*Finally run this command and press enter,\n% sudo update-grub\nI hope this will work for sure.This worked for me when I had the same problem with my Ubuntu 12.04 !

Is it possible that if I completely wipe my hard drive (also deleting all partitions on it) and put it to NTFS, it would bring back Windows Boot Manager. Therefore, I can install windows again?\n\nA: It is always possible to delete EVERYTHING, start from scratch, and install a new Operating System (in fact this tends to be the easiest way to install an OS). This holds for Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.\nWhen you boot from the Windows Live Media (e.g. installation DVD) and choose an option similar to \"Erase disk and install\", it will delete EVERRYTHING on the disk, create NTFS partitions, install Windows, and install the Windows boot loader.\nAlso note that it's possible to have Windows and Ubuntu on your computer at the same time. This is called dual boot.\n\nA: The Windows Boot Manager can be installed and configured through the bcdboot command in Windows or Windows installation media. It's very simple to use.\nCreating new filesystems (\"formatting\") or partitions on the other side is completely unrelated to bootloaders and won't magically create or install them.\n\nA: http://easybcd.joydownload.com/?c=61&gclid=CP_d0NiKicICFUrpwgodbwUAig\nits very good app use it to edit boot menu\n", "Q: Is a 32 bit OS sufficient for Ubuntu I've got an old pc with windows XP 32 bit, and I wanted to turn it into a home based server.  I am thinking of installing ubuntu as an OS.  I'm a networking novice so I'm not quite sure if it will work good.  My other computers are all running windows 7 64 bit.  So, will it be sufficient to turn this 32 bit box into a server to hold all my files and backups, while the 64 bit pc's just exchange the data?  Please let me know, or educate me on the subject.  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You have a processor that is capable of 64-bit, so go ahead and use a 64-bit version of Ubuntu.\nYou stated elsewhere that your PC has a \"Pentium Duo Core\" chip.  Intel has never released a dual core chip called \"Pentium\" that doesn't support 64-bit apart from the \"Yonah\", a re-branded version of the Pentium M that is for laptops.\n\nA: It depends on the hardware how much ram/cpu and disk space you have, for example\nif you have 512mb of ram and Pantium 4 cpu with sufficient disk space let's say 80gb\nan Ethernet card, that should enable you to have a decent server, with BackupPC that will make it easy to make backups\n\nA: As to whether it will serve your novice-networking needs, I'll go out on a limb and say \"probably\".\nupdate/correction:\n I previously said that your processor is only capable of 32bit processing.  I wish to rescind that claim.  In fact I believe it is probably only capable of 32 bit processing given some of your previous comments regarding it's brand, model, and previous operating system, yet to be perfectly fair, it might be 64 bit capable.  It is impossible to tell without more information.  Please see this informative Wikipedia link regarding the processor you previously mentioned.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_Dual-Core\nThe easiest way to find out if your CPU is 64bit is to try to install Ubuntu64, and if it fails to install, then your processor is not 64bit.  Yet your decision doesn't stop there.\nI work with all generations of PCs, some predating the year 2000, and due to the complications I was encountering with Ubuntu64, I all but entirely stopped using it.  Among the more common annoyances, it simply wastes RAM, so if your old PC has 2gb or less RAM, and if you don't intend to purchase more for it, I would strongly urge you to stick with 32bit, but that's just a personal opinion.\n", "Q: How to do virtual networking (all types) in virt-manager?

I experienced similar symptoms that went away after re-attaching the cable at the back of the monitor. In other cases, a new or alternative cable should be tried before anything else.\n", "Q: Problem Updating from CUDA-5.0 to 6.5 I just tried updating from CUDA-5.0 to CUDA-6.5 and seem to have broken my GUI interface. I tried  to update with the following procedure:\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_6.5-14_amd64.deb \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cuda \n\nI then updated my PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables so that they contained paths to /usr/local/cuda-6.5.\nHowever, when I reboot my machine, the resolution of the logon screen is wrong - everything is slightly too large, and after I logon, all I get is the background screen. I have no access to icons or menus, although my touchpad still works and I can move a pointer around the screen.\nWhen I switch to one of my virtual terminals, I can verify that:\n\n\n*\n\n*lspci still shows my NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670MX\n\n*/usr/bin/cuda-6.5 is installed\n\n*nvcc -V shows 'Cuda compilation tools, release 6.5, V6.5.12'\n\n\nBut, cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version claims there is no such file or directory.\nAlso, I don't even have the /proc/driver/nvidia directory.\nI think that I somehow removed my nvidia drivers, even though I still get some graphics for the logon screen.\nDoes anyone know how I can fix things or what other debugging steps I should try, so that I can use my GUI interface again? \nThanks...\nPS\nI just tried to install the nvidia-340 driver by:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install nvidia-340\nIt seems to claim that nvidia-340 is installed \n nvidia-340 is already the newest version. \n nvidia-340 set to manually installed\n\nbut there's still no /proc/driver/nvidia directory... Am I missing something obvious?\nThanks \n\nA: I had a similar issue with ubuntu gnome 14.04 (Gnome 13.10). I have followed the same steps you mentioned, installing cuda 6.5 and removing 5.5 (that comes with the standard ubuntu repositories). After that cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version/ gave no results.\nMoreover rebooting resulted in a failure in loading the login screen (the screen was fixed on the gnome splash screen). I could login with command line, using the command ALt + Ctrl + F1, but I wasn't able to have the GUI working.\nAfter a day of trial and error of recovery attempts (and many Ubuntu reinstalls), I've found that the problem was gdm, so I solved my problem installing lightdm and rebooting with it. This was needed only for the first reboot after cuda installation, then I could revert to gdm. \nHope it helps.\n", "Q: --Problem with virtual box I work on UBUNTU.

Check this with echo $DISPLAY\nIf what you're trying to achieve, is accessing an open Window on your X11 server through SSH, I'll suggest taking a look at this: http://www.wensley.org.uk/x\nIt explains how to achieve behaviour similiar to 'screen', but with X11 applications. \n\nA: Try setting the DISPLAY variable to the X server of the VNC session:\nDISPLAY=:1 java xxx\n\n\nA: There's a couple of things you can do here I guess, one way is to use ssh -X command.\nHowever, I like the approach of running a VNC server (like tightvnc) on you host that you're trying to connect to. Then you can ssh to that host and use a vnc viewer for the display if you need it. On your ssh terminal, connect to your host vnc and forward it's 5901 port (assuming your tightvnc server is listening on 5901 port) to local 5901 port.\nssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 -C user@192.168.186.111\n\nAnd, on a different terminal connect to the forwarded port for viewing X11:\nvncviewer localhost:5901\n\nNow, when you run a command that's giving you error that's because your DISPLAY variable is not set. You can set it by typing export DISPLAY=:N on your ssh terminal. Note: The N is usually 1, but to verify you can open a terminal in your x11-vnc window and type echo $DISPLAY, N is whatever value is displayed here.\n", "Q: Problem with Media Device(MTP) when connect to Ubuntu 14.04 I used to transfer files from pc to mobile using MTP option. but suddenly two days back i am unable to connect my mobile.

Can I directly upgrade to 14.04, or I have to update first to 13.04 & then 14.04?\n\nA: I would recommend that you take a backup of your data and do a fresh install instead.\nHowever, if you wish to upgrade, enter the following commands in the terminal\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo update-manager -d\nNow your Update Manager will open and it will show the availability of the upgrade.

(CodeBlocks gets affected in a similar way.) Because the scrollbars were changed in that version, Nin's answer made me wonder if that was the problem - it was.\nI think the problem is that there is an interaction between wxWidgets (the GUI toolkit that Filezilla and Codeblocks are built on) and certain scrollbar configurations. Thus, this is actually a much deeper issue than just one version of Ubuntu or one application.\nAn alternative way to turn off the custom scrollbars is to install the unity-tweak-tool. Go to Scrolling, and set Scrollbars to Legacy.\n", "Q: Set custom added PATH vars to work in each Terminal session I ran these 2 commands simply in the terminal:\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/home/milkncookiez/Developer/android-studio/bin\"\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/home/milkncookiez/Developer/PhpStorm/bin\"\n\nin the 2 bin folders I have the files studio.sh and phpstorm.sh. In that same terminal session when I simply wrote the name of the files - the programs were ran.\nWhen I opened another terminal - did not work. I added these both lines in the ~/.profile file, opened a new terminal session but it still does not work. How do I set the 2 variable changes to be permanent for all terminal sessions?\n\nA: Adding them to ~/.profile (apply to your user) or a /etc/profile.d/*.sh file (apply to the entire system) is the correct way. In order for the change to apply, you have to log out of your system and log back in, as ~/.profile and /etc/profile.d/*.sh are loaded when you login.\nTo 'reload' ~/.profile in a running terminal, you can use source ~/.profile\n\nA: You don't need to use export; the PATH variable is already exported at that point. Anyway, .profile is read when you log in, so what you've done is correct, but opening a new terminal does not count as logging in.\n", "Q: How to add custom sources to GNOME Music Player? I just upgraded to GNOME 3.12 (running Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 LTS) and I love the Music Player that comes with it. The problem I have, is that my music is located on a NAS, so its not in the default directory that the player expects it to be. I have looked through all options within the player, but I had no luck defining a custom location for my music.\nDoes anybody know how to adjust those settings?\n\nA: It seems to utilise 'Tracker' to find your music. \nOpen the \"tracker-preferences\" application, navigate to the 'Locations' tab, and add the location of your music.

Mixed up characters I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and I am having a character problem with my terminal.\nThis is my  terminal when I write a short command and this is my terminal when I write a command with more than the characters that can fit in a line.\nI tried changing various fonts and I still get the same problem. I also tried changing font size but still nothing.\nAlso if I write a command that is like the second link and then I try to delete characters then things get really ugly.Once I start deleting characters then the rest of the line just disappears but if I press enter then the command is interpreted correctly.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: What terminal is this? Add the output of echo $TERM to your question.\nThis can happen when you have escape sequences (as generated by tput) in your prompt that are not surrounded by \\[ and \\].  Those backslashed brackets tell Bash that the escape sequences do not take up any horizontal space on the screen.  Without them around the escape sequences, Bash counts each byte of the escape sequence as a visible character, which messes up previously displayed commands as you move back and forth through command history.\nSource\nTo check if you have escape sequences in your prompt, use echo \"$PS1\" | od -c and lookfor characters with the value 033. If you spot those, then you have escape sequences in your prompt.\nIf you find 033 in your prompt\nCheck where the prompt PS1 is set: grep -i ps1 .*|less\nThen edit that file (often it's in .bashrc)and surround the sequence with \\[ and \\].\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu work with dual sim phones?

To remove the ability for an user to do sudo:\ngpasswd -d user sudo \ngpasswd -d user adm \n\nand to enable it: \ngpasswd -a user sudo \ngpasswd -a user adm \n\n(one or the other --- check with groups which is the correct group in your system). \n\nA: If you don't require a fool-proof solution, you can make a wrapper for sudo that checks to see if you're logged in over SSH before running the real sudo.  Just create a /usr/local/bin/sudo script, mark it executable (sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sudo), and add these contents:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ \"$SSH_CLIENT\" != \"\" ]; then\n    echo \"remote sudo access is disabled\" 1>&2\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n/usr/bin/sudo \"$@\"\n\nFlaws:\n\n*\n\n*while it works for sudo, it can be bypassed by calling /usr/bin/sudo directly\n\n*it relies on the contents of the SSH_CLIENT environment variable, so a user can bypass the restriction by clearing this environment variable\n\nIt's possible there's ways to address these issues, but if you just need something to stop your \"typical\" user then this should work.\n", "Q: Geary not installing I have a problem that Geary is not installing even after repeated attempts.

To install Latex, we tried the following commands:\nsudo apt -get update\nsudo apt -get install texlive -full\n\nBoth the commands do not work. After giving first command it asks for [sudo] password. When we give administrative password, it says  'apt is not found'.  We also tried to install 'tilda' by giving the following command.\nsudo apt -get install tilda\n\nIt also says 'apt is not found'. It does not recognize Advanced Packaging Tool (APT). What is problem?\n\nA: Firstly, when you run sudo you are prompted for the password.  The password would be the password for the user logged in.  So if you are under the user foo, the password you would enter is the password for foo.  It won't show the typed characters or even placeholders though.\nSecondly, there is no space between apt and -get.  The actual program is called apt-get.\nThirdly, there should not be ANY spaces in the package name, so texlive -full is wrong, it is texlive-full.\nTherefore, the commands you should be running are:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install texlive-full\nsudo apt-get install tilda\n\nAlternatively you can try the following to actually use the apt tool instead of apt-get, however I would recommend that you use apt-get instead:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install texlive-full\nsudo apt install tilda\n\n", "Q: indicator-cpufreq always shows only one bar on Ubuntu 14.10 On Ubuntu 14.10 the indicator-cpufreq always shows only one bar.

When I say \"bare-bones\", I mean as minimal installation as is practical. Ideally I want Ubuntu Minimal, but if that refuses to work altogether, I'd settle with a close equivalent. I see two paths to it: either get the network connection working with the installer, or acquire an offline installer and then get the network working after the OS has been installed.\nEdit: I noticed the problem only manifested if I rebooted straight from Windows to Linux by using the \"restart\" feature of Windows. If I shut down the machine completely first and then booted up to Linux, the network worked fine. This clue lead me to a solution, see the answer I posted myself.\nI only have a vague idea of what I'm doing. That's why I'll be a bit more detailed than would be necessary if I had the knowledge to extract only the necessary information of what's wrong.\nWhen I try to install Ubuntu Minimal or Server from an USB drive, the installation fails to \"bad archive mirror\" error when it tries to download something it apparently needs for the installation. When I tried to diagnose it further, it seems the installer cannot connect to Internet. I'm trying to do the installation on a machine where there already is Windows 7 installed, and the network works just fine on the Windows.\nDuring the installation, before the bad archive mirror error, there is a network configuration phase. During this phase, the following steps occur:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Detecting link on em1: please wait...\". Seems to complete just fine, rather quickly.\n\n*\"Waiting for link-local address...\" completes so fast I can barely read the text.\n\n*\"Attempting IPV6 autoconfiguration...\" completes without error after 15 or so seconds.\n\n*\"Configuring the network with DHCP\" fails after 30 seconds of trying. The error message includes \"Your network is probably not using DHCP protocol\". My network is using it, with Inteno X5668 modem acting as the DHCP server. As mentioned, it works when using the installed Windows.\n\n\nThe installer then offers me the option to manually configure the network settings. At this point, before the manual configuration steps, I can open the terminal. The command \"ip a\" results in following output: (I don't have good grasp of what the output means or what the command does. I came accross the command when searching for a solution for the problem.)\n1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue\n     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n     inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n     inet6 ::1/128 scope host\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n2: em1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000\n     link/ether [NETWORK ADAPTER MAC ADDRESS HERE] brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n\nPinging anything else but 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 at this stage results in \"sendto: network is unreachable\" message, including pinging the router.\nOther common troubleshooting commands I am aware of I don't have access to during the installation (eg. ifconfig).\nIf I select to \"not configure network now\" and proceed with the installation, the installation halts a few steps later with the \"bad mirror archive\" error.\nI have tried to select manual network configuration, in which case I get to enter IP address, subnet mask, gateway address and DNS address manually. I entered the same values for these that the Windows 7 on the same machine is using, including the address of the router as gateway and DNS. These values include 192.168.1.1 for the router, and 192.168.1.2 for the machine the OS is being installed on. After inputting these, the \"Detecting link on em1\" step occurs again. This time I suspect it's failing, as the progress bar stays at 0% for a good while, until the screen suddenly goes blank for a moment and then the next step of the installation appears.\nAfter the manual configuration, the output of the \"ip a\" command is the following:\n1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue\n     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n     inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n     inet6 ::1/128 scope host\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n2: em1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000\n     link/ether [NETWORK ADAPTER MAC ADDRESS HERE] brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n     inet 192.168.1.2/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global em1\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n     inet6 fe80::468a:5bff:fea0:5e00/64 scope link\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n\nPing commands at this point don't output an error message, but result in 100% packet loss. This includes pinging the router.\nAfter this, proceeding with the installation again stops soon with the \"bad archive mirror\" error.\nI've tried both normal and command line install from 'Ubuntu 14.04 \"Trusty Tahr\" Minimal CD' from the minimal CD wiki page under the '64-bit PC (amd64, x86_64)' section, and command line install from Ubuntu server image 'ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso'. I've tried using both Linux Live USB Creator and UNetbootin for creating the USB installation media I'm installing from. They all behave the same way.\nI have tried rebooting the router. It did not change anything. When I rebooted it, the installer was already running, but in an earlier step before the network configuration phase.\nI've been trying to find an offline installer, so that the lack of network connection would not be a problem during installation and I could troubleshoot it after the OS has been installed, but I haven't been able to find one for the configuration I want. The installers I tried seem to need to download some files during the installation process. I don't want the regular desktop install of Ubuntu. My original intention was to install the Minimal installation. I then tried the Server one in the hopes I could install that offline, but that does not seem to be the case. Even if such installer exists, I will probably still need help resolving the problem with the installed OS.\nThe machine has MSI MPower Z97 motherboard, which has integrated Intel I218-V network adapter. Perhaps the driver the installer is using does not work properly with the I218-V? I found out some other users had problems with this network controller until they manually installed some non-default driver, but that was after they successfully completed the installation. Would it be possible for me to mod the ISO so that it uses a different driver during the installation?\nThe Windows 7 that is already present on the machine has been installed in and is presently booting with UEFI mode.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: It seems the issue of not being able to connect to the Internet is somehow caused by Windows NIC drivers and Wake-on-LAN.\nFrom my Windows drivers settings I turned off the setting \"Wake on Magic Packet from power off state\". I've had no problems with connecting to Internet with Linux since then. The other \"Wake on\" settings I'm able to have enabled with no problems. I did not even have the \"Wake on Magic Packet from power off state\" setting visible before I updated my drivers to a more recent version - the old version had the same problem, but the setting was not there to be turned off.\nImage of the NIC drivers setting window for reference.\n", "Q: permissions question I'm new to Ubuntu and setting permissions.

I've done any number of fixes I've found online and everything seemed to make the problem worse, but I was able to reverse everything I did. \nI can see all the wireless networks in range, including my two, a 2.4gHz and a 5 gHz. I click connect and the button does nothing. Networking is enabled. I've restarted network manager. I've rebooted the system. I've changed the slot where the wireless card resides. Any ideas?\nI forgot to mention. Wired is working. Through some of the fixes it had switched itself to unmanaged, but I got that working again and connect via either ethernet or with my phone.\n\nA: I installed wicd and it worked right away. It would be nice for it to work through network manager though.\n", "Q: Can I install pantheon terminal in Ubuntu 14.04 or newer? Is it possible to install Pantheon terminal from elementary OS on my Ubuntu 14.04 or newer LTS releases? If yes, how can I?\n\nA: Pantheon terminal requires gtk >= 3.12, but Ubuntu 14.04 comes with gtk 3.10\nSo at the moment it is not installable unless you want to add gnome3 staging ppa, which is not recommended and will probably break your system.\n\nA: You can install it by running: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pantheon-terminal\n\nThe ppa:elementary/stable is recommended for LTS releases of Ubuntu.\nThe ppa:elementary/daily may be used for any currently supported releases of Ubuntu and has the newest and most unstable development of elementary. The Daily PPA is subject to critical bugs and should not be used except for testing purpose only.\nDo note that, since Pantheon often uses a different version of GTK than Ubuntu (especially with LTS), this may impact your system with broader impact (IE: Gnome issues), so thar be dragons\n\nA: In case you want your Terminal to look like Elementary OS' terminal, do the following -\nGo to Edit -> Profile Preferences\nGo to the Colors tab and uncheck Use Colors from System Theme\nFrom the Built-in Schemes drop down menu, select White on Black\nGo to the Background tab and select Transparent Background\nAdjust the slider below according to your preference.

(sorry for bad English, I am Brazilian)\n\nA: If Linux detects a problem on the harddrive, it will switch the filesystem to read only to prevent damage to the filesystem.\nSince this is happening during install, I would assume something is wrong with the CD (ie. a bad ISO). You can find this out by running the 'check cd' option you get during boot. If this shows errors you need to re-download and re-burn the install disc.\nIf the installation disc turns out to be perfect it is likely to be a hardware problem. It could be your hard disc that is failing.

My problem is that when I reboot the USB, the \"install Lubuntu\" icon has returned to the desktop, even though all the other changes I made persist after rebooting.\nHow can I permanently, persistently remove the install Lubuntu icon from the desktop?\n\nA: To remove the \"Install Lubuntu\" icon, you could remove the installer, Ubiquity. To do so, you'll have to customize the ISO. When you arrive at the step where you chroot into the extracted ISO, you can uninstall the installer with\napt-get purge ubiquity\n\nThe resulting ISO will then have no installer. This should also remove the installation icon from the desktop. If it doesn't remove the installation .desktop file in /home/lubuntu/\n\nTo remove the Installation options from GRUB, open the file USBROOT/boot/grub/grub.cfg in a text editor. This file contains all boot menu entries in the following format:\nmenuentry \"Name\" {\n    # some config\n}\n\nRemove the entries you don't need, then save. If you use UNetBootin for creation of the boot sticks, also edit the file USBROOT/syslinux.cfg.

I am trying to install something and among the steps there was this one:\n\"Place it on your $PATH\"\nWhat does this mean? What is that?\nI have searched both this site and on Google but everyone just takes it for granted!\n\nA: I assume you are coming from a Windows background (apologies if it is not true). In layman's terms, a path (or the search path) is the list of directories that will be searched for anything that you type on the command line. If you type in a built-in command like ls, it will look for a specified list of directories. You can look up your path by typing echo $PATH. Here is one difference between Windows and *nix: By default, Windows always looks for the executable file in the current directory. For example, if you have a file called uptime.bat in c:\\myscripts, and you cd c:\\myscripts and type in uptime, it will run. However, in *nix, the path will be consulted and the executable found (if available). \nIf you keep your scripts in a directory called /home/teresa/scripts, to execute those scripts, you will have to specify the full path to that directory. Example: /hone/teresa/checkHost. A variation would be to cd /home/teresa and then type ./checkHost (note the ./ which means that you  are explicitly asking the file to run from the current directory. \nTo avoid this, you can just type\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/teresa/scripts\nwhich means that, in addition to the path that already exists now, also search in /hone/teresa/scripts. However, the problem with this is that once you logout, this setting would be gone. So, you should edit the hidden file ~/.bashrc, find the PATH line there, and append it accordingly. I am assuming you use bash. In the case of other shells, the syntax and file are different.\nAs a new user, it is very tempting to have . in the search path, which basically means that also search in the current directory. However, that is not considered a good practice for reasons discussed elsewhere.\nHTH\n\nA: Run in a terminal:\necho $PATH\n\nor\nprintf \"%s\\n\" \"$PATH\"\n\nwhat you see is a list of directories, looking like:\n/home/jacob/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\nIf you put an executable in either one of these directories, you do not need to set the path to the executable / script, but you can run it by its name as a command.\nExecutables in $PATH should not have a language extension by convention (although they would work) \nEditing your $PATH variable\nYou can (permanently) add a directory to $PATH by adding the following line to your ~/.profile file (invisible by default, press Ctrl+H in the file manager to make it visible):\nexport PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dir\n\nMore usefull information on environment variables\n(such as $PATH) can be found here (thanks for the suggestions @Letizia)\n\nA: $PATH is a environment variable that is file location-related.\nWhen one types a command to run, the system looks for it in the directories specified by PATH in the order specified.\nYou can view the directories specified by typing echo $PATH in the terminal.\nSuppose there is a executable file foobar01.sh present at /home/user/foo1/foo2/foobar01.sh which you want to execute on a regular basis. typing the entire \"path\" would be time consuming. So we add the directory in to $PATH variable and we can execute foobar.sh directly without even specifying the path.\nYou can add it to $PATH by typing the following command:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/user/foo1/foo2\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu stuck on login screen I have a small issue with my Ubuntu (I think After an upgarde).\nWhen I try to login (Login Screen), I get disconnected and get back to the screen (again & again).\nI tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Trying to login with others Desktop environements.\n\n*Booting from old kernel.\n\n*log in via command line [apt-get update && apt-get upgrade].\n\n*removing ~/.gconf directory.\n\n*sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop and sudo apt-get install unity\nNone of these solutions worked.\n\nA: Press Ctrl+Alt+F3 and login into the shell using your username and your password.

However, Ubuntu overrides and displays a menu which allows me to minimize/close/maximize/etc the window. Is there any way to disable all the keyboard shortcuts except for Alt+Tab when I'm using blender?

I am configuring a guest VM under libvirt using virsh edit.  The source of the kernel running in the VM is an embedded security device where I have no control over what drivers it comes with.  In particular it doesn't seem to recognize the virtio driver for the NIC so I am using the e1000 emulation shown as follows:\n<interface type='bridge'>\n  <mac address='52:54:00:ae:cd:b2'/>\n  <source bridge='br0'/>\n  <model type='e1000'/>\n  <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x03' function='0x0'/>\n</interface>\n\nThis value was copied from an example I found on the web somewhere.\nI want to experiment to try other emulations to see what works best, but I haven't been able to find what options there are.   This applies to both the disk and the network devices.  I wouldn't mind known what video emulations are available either.\n\nA: A list of some of the available emulations are shown on the man page for kvm.  For a definitive list for the system in use, use the kvm command as follows:\nkvm -net nic,model=?\n\nOn my system that results in the following output:\nkvm -net nic,model=?\nqemu: Supported NIC models: ne2k_pci,i82551,i82557b,i82559er,rtl8139,e1000,pcnet,virtio\n\nFor people who are following the same learning curve as I am, it helps to understand how the virsh command does its job.  The XML definition file is parsed into a kvm command when you execute a virsh start xxx command.   The actual command that it is transformed into along with environment variables is logged in /var/log/libvirt/qemu/xxx.log where xxx is the domain name of your guest VM.\nSo with this architecture the list of available options doesn't need to be defined by the virsh package since it is basically an abstraction for the real work going on which is done by kvm.

Am I over-thinking this?\n\nA: This is standard practice in many large organisations - you take a \"clean\" installation with everything set up correctly, then take basically a dump of the entire disk and store that in an image file, then when you deploy a new desktop you deploy from that image file.\nYou can basically do a dd of the whole drive, including all partitions, with, say\ndd if=/dev/sdc of=/media/externalhd/myimage.img\n\nMake sure none of the partitions are mounted, and you don't modify anything on the drive, during this operation (practically this means you should probably boot from a live CD/USB to do this).\n\nand then save it as it's own bootable reco media\n\nWell one of the limitations of this practice is that you are copying the partition table and everything, so if you just do a straight restore onto another drive it has to be the same size or larger, and the partitions won't be resized - though you can do that later.\n", "Q: Openstack Juno Juju Charms for Utopic Finally, managed to deploy a utopic image, see MAAS 1.7 How to Deploy utopic images; however, my problem now is that I can't deploy  utopic charms:\n$ juju status\nenvironment: maas17\nmachines:\n  \"0\":\n    agent-state: started\n    agent-version: 1.20.11\n    dns-name: utopic.maas17\n    instance-id: /MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-b61e1cb4-7112-11e4-aede-08002781ac14/\n    series: utopic\n    hardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=1 mem=490M\n    state-server-member-status: has-vote\n\n$ juju deploy --to 0 juju-gui -v --debug\n2014-11-21 03:07:48 INFO juju.cmd supercommand.go:37 running juju [1.20.11-utopic-amd64 gc]\n2014-11-21 03:07:48 DEBUG juju.conn api.go:187 trying cached API connection settings\n2014-11-21 03:07:48 INFO juju.conn api.go:270 connecting to API addresses: [10.0.0.70:17070 utopic.maas17:17070 utopic.maas17:17070]\n2014-11-21 03:07:48 INFO juju.state.api apiclient.go:242 dialing \"wss://10.0.0.70:17070/environment/31846f9e-c1b4-4490-842d-2f5d11f49e7f/api\"\n2014-11-21 03:07:48 INFO juju.state.api apiclient.go:176 connection established to \"wss://10.0.0.70:17070/environment/31846f9e-c1b4-4490-842d-2f5d11f49e7f/api\"\n2014-11-21 03:07:49 ERROR juju.cmd supercommand.go:323 charm not found: cs:utopic/juju-gui\n\nIf I deploy Trusty charms, would I be able to deploy Openstack Juno or would it default to Icehouse?

I am new here. And I may replace a laptop's hard disk with Ubuntu. It's an HP Compaq notebook which has Windows 7 installed. So If I choose that install option, will it replace the screen that says F12 for boot options [actually it was esc]. I am just asking. I know that choosing that options erases your other partitions. I am assuming it gets replaced by grub2?\n\nA: The Erase disk and install Ubuntu option will cause all partitions on the disk to be erased, including the protected system and recovery partitions. It will also delete all your programs, photos, music and any other files in all operating systems, including all other operating systems themselves.\n\nWhen you install Ubuntu, the GRUB bootloader will replace the existing Windows bootloader, but it will not replace the HP Compaq notebook's splash screen that appears  during boot before the Windows logo appears on the screen. The splash screen is a function of the motherboard that provides a visual cue for accessing the BIOS. Because the splash screen is determined by the computer's hardware, replacing the operating system will not have any effect on whether the splash screen appears when the computer is started.\n\nIf you are installing an Ubuntu guest OS on a virtual machine the Erase disk and install Ubuntu option will erase all the data that is stored in the directory that is dedicated to the new Ubuntu installation and then install the Ubuntu guest OS in that directory.\n\nA: No. It won't replace the screen that say F12 for more boot options.it is because that screen is displayed by an independent software called Firmware BIOS. First displaying F12 option it will show you Grub where you can select Ubuntu and it's advanced options\n", "Q: I'm having difficulties opening Poker Stars I have a problem running an updated version of Poker Stars using Wine.

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You should never run a graphical application (such as nautilus) with sudo.  You should use gksu instead if you need to do this.\nUnfortunately, using a graphical application as sudo creates a lot of problems which you are discovering can be difficult to clean up. \nThe technical explanation behind this is that the program you are executing will be executed as root, but it will think its home directory is your home directory.  So if it writes any files to what it thinks is its home directory, you're gonna end up with root-owned files in your home directory.\nYou have possibly ended up with root-owned files in your user's Trash folder.\nYou will probably have to clean this up with terminal access, becoming root with sudo -i, and then going into your trash folder (/home/user/.local/share/Trash/files or similar) and manually deleting what you need to delete.\nIn the future if you need to run nautilus (or any other graphical program) as root, use gksu.  This will ensure that it won't mess up your home directory with root-owned files.\nNote: There is no reason you would need to copy regular user files to your home directory as root that I can think of - presumably you were trying to work around some other problem by doing this?\nNote 2: As a result of running sudo nautilus you may also have other root-owned files within your home directory, such as if nautilus writes its configuration to files in ~/.config/ or similar. This may cause other breakages when you try to run other software.\n", "Q: Use other environment variables in PATH definition I've been wondering if there is a way to set the PATH system variable using other system variables.

While in a virtual environment, what will happen if I use other methods of installation such as apt or manual install? Will the installation go into the virtual or global environment?

When you delete the environment folder, you also delete everything that was installed by pip from that environment.\nThere's also pip uninstall but even so, it's safer to use pip in an isolated virtualenv virtual environment in your /home directory, because it puts the files installed by pip somewhere in the /home directory instead of in a directory that is owned by root.\n", "Q: Problem in USB Ethernet driver Installation on Ubuntu 14.04LTS I am facing problem while installing & loading USB ethernet drive (AX88179_178A).\nI have downloaded ethernet drivers from this link.\nAfter that I followed below procedure...\ncd AX88179_178A_LINUX_DRIVER_v1.12.0_SOURCE/\n\nmsil@mswelt29:~/AX88179_178A_LINUX_DRIVER_v1.12.0_SOURCE$ ls\n\nax88179_178a.c   ax88179_178a.h   Makefile   readme\n\nmsil@mswelt29:~/AX88179_178A_LINUX_DRIVER_v1.12.0_SOURCE$ make\n\nmsil@mswelt29:~/AX88179_178A_LINUX_DRIVER_v1.12.0_SOURCE$ ls\n\nax88179_178a.c  ax88179_178a.ko     ax88179_178a.mod.o  Makefile       Module.symvers\nax88179_178a.h  ax88179_178a.mod.c  ax88179_178a.o      modules.order  readme\n\nmsil@mswelt29:~/AX88179_178A_LINUX_DRIVER_v1.12.0_SOURCE$ sudo modprobe usbnet\nmsil@mswelt29:~/AX88179_178A_LINUX_DRIVER_v1.12.0_SOURCE$ sudo insmod ax88179_178a.ko\n\n**insmod: ERROR: could not insert module ax88179_178a.ko: File exists**\n\nmsil@mswelt29:~/AX88179_178A_LINUX_DRIVER_v1.12.0_SOURCE$ locate ax88179_178a.ko\n\n/lib/modules/3.13.0-24-generic/kernel/drivers/net/usb/ax88179_178a.ko\n/lib/modules/3.13.0-34-generic/kernel/drivers/net/usb/ax88179_178a.ko\n/lib/modules/3.13.0-35-generic/kernel/drivers/net/usb/ax88179_178a.ko\n/lib/modules/3.13.0-36-generic/kernel/drivers/net/usb/ax88179_178a.ko\n\nstill after this execution my Ethernet adapter wont works.\nPlease suggest me right method. \n\nA: In my case on Debian Wheezy, I fixed it with building a new kernel.

But as the Arch Wiki suggests this may also cause other problems, but you should try it out.\nYou can temporarily add acpi_osi=\"!Windows 2012\" to the end of the linux line in GRUB by selecting the entry at boot, editig it with e and booting with F10.\nIf that worked you can make the changes permanent by editing GRUB defaults in terminal (Ctrl+Alt+t, then sudo nano /etc/default/grub) and add the string to a line that looks similar to this: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" (save with Ctrl+o and close with Ctrl+x).

I am doing dpkg -l and it is listing all installed packages, but\nrpm -qa is not showing anything.\nWhy is this the case? Do I have to make some changes so that rpm will also display the installed packages?\n\nA: Per your comments, you say that you're \"doing RHEL based Linux distribution\" and that you don't know what mistake you're making.\nThe mistake you're making is that you are thinking that Ubuntu is a RHEL based distribution.  Ubuntu is a Debian based system, and uses dpkg as the package management system.  It does not use RPM packages, which is why using rpm will return nothing.  The use of dpkg -l was somewhat more accurate to use, as dpkg is the underlying package system.\nIf you want a RHEL based distribution to work with, CentOS and Fedora are possible alternative options.  (However, support for those is not on this site, which is Ubuntu only, so for Fedora and CentOS questions, try Unix and Linux instead.)\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't use rpm packages, hence you don't see them (as some people stated already in comments). Ubuntu is using deb packages so you have to use proper tools to handle them, like: dpkg, apt and some other more or less convenient tools to handle repos in text console or graphics mode.\nSo - dpkg -l in that case was the proper tool.\n", "Q: Where is `__FLT_MAX__` constant defined on Ubuntu?

But to be able to automate my working process, it is necessary that every part ends with a specific tag: </record>. And it is also necessary that every part has got at least the size of about 40MB.\n\nA: The script below slices a (large) file into slices. I didn't use the split command, since the content of your file has to be \"rounded\" by records. The size of the slices you can set in the head section of the script.\nThe procedure\nDifficulties\nBecause the script should be able to deal with huge files, either python's read() or readlines() cannot be used; the script would attempt to load the whole file at once into memory, which would certainly choke your system. At the same time, divisions have to be made, \"rounding\" sections by a whole record. The script should therefore somehow be able to identify or \"read\" the file's content.\nWhat seems to be the only option is to use:\nwith open(file) as src:\n    for line in src:\n\nwhich reads the file line by line.\nApproach\nIn the script I chose a two-step approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Analyze the file (size, number of slices, number of lines, number of records, records per section), then creating a list of sections or \"markers\" (by line index).\n\n*reading the file again, but now allocating the lines to separate files.\n\n\nThe procedure to append the lines to the separate slices (files) one by one seems inefficient, but from all I tried it turned out to be the most efficient, fastest and least consuming option.\nHow I tested\nI created an xml file of a little over 10GB, filled with records like your example. I set the size of slices to 45mb. On my not-so-recent system (Pentium Dual-Core CPU E6700 @ 3.20GHz × 2), the script's analysis produced the following:\nanalyzing file...\n\nchecking file size...\nfile size: 10767 mb\ncalculating number of slices...\n239 slices of 45 mb\nchecking number of lines...\nnumber of lines: 246236399\nchecking number of records...\nnumber of records: 22386000\ncalculating number records per section ...\nrecords per section: 93665\n\nThen it started creating slices of 45 mb, taking appr. 25-27 seconds per slice to create. \ncreating slice 1\ncreating slice 2\ncreating slice 3\ncreating slice 4\ncreating slice 5\n\nand so on...\nThe processor was occupied for 45-50 % during the process, using ~850-880mb of my memory (of 4GB).

I reinstalled Ubuntu, and after reinstall I can enter Windows 8.1, but my mouse is not working properly in Ubuntu.

I use integrated graphic card hd3000.\nHow do I solve this?\n\nA: It seems the mouse issue was caused by some configuration files (I reinstalled Ubuntu 14.04.1, but my home directory pointed to a separated home partition that was not formatted when reinstalling Ubuntu). \nSo I backed up all of the hidden files and hidden directories in the my home directory using tar -czf cfg.backup.tar.gz ~/.*, then I removed all the hidden files and hidden directories in the my home directory by sudo rm -rf ~/.*.\nI restarted the computer, after I logged in, everything is ok! now, if you miss some custom configuration you has lost, you can find it from cfg.backup.tar.gz, use the one in the backup to replace the one in your home directory.\n\nEditor's Note: \n\nWARNING! while removing offending config files is a useful technique, removing all hidden files and directories is not a good idea as many things will not work properly. A better approach might be to back up all your config files and try renaming or removing the likely suspects one by one (start with ~/.config and if that doesn't work try ~/.local). If you really feel you need to nuke the whole lot (highly unlikely) then you could make a new user, and copy the hidden files from the new user's home directory over those in your old home directory, for example.\n\n", "Q: 64 bit chrome doesn't work on ubuntu 14.0.4 64 bit On my ubuntu desktop, i have both firefox and chrome installed.  firefox works fine with my proxy settings, but chrome won't.

I make a lot of backups. I do so on different disks, which are stored on different places. I am looking for a type of backup, but I can't find its name (which I need in order to figure out whether rsync or another ubuntu tool can help me with it). \nHere is what I am trying to achieve.\n\n\n*\n\n*Always keep an identical copy of the current state of the home folder (in other words, the backup and the home folder are identical after each back up)\n\n*On each backup every file that is changed or deleted in the home folder is taken out of the backup and is stored in a folder that contains all changed and deleted files on the particular day of the backup.\n\n\nFor instance,\nDay 1\n/home/joey/1.txt\n/home/joey/2.txt\n/home/joey/3.txt\n\nRegular old-school Backup:\n/media/backup/joey/1.txt\n/media/backup/joey/2.txt\n/media/backup/joey/3.txt\n\nDay 2\n/home/joey/1.txt\n/home/joey/3.txt\n# D /home/joey/2.txt is deleted\n\nBackup with an exact copy of joey, but with a new diff folder:\n/media/backup/joey/1.txt\n/media/backup/joey/3.txt\n/media/backup/day2-diff/joey/2.txt\n\nDay 3\n/home/joey/1.txt\n/home/joey/3.txt # A /home/joey/3.txt was changed\n/home/joey/4.txt\n\nBackup with again an exact copy of joey, and with a diff folder for a changed file:\n/media/backup/joey/1.txt\n/media/backup/joey/3.txt # the new version\n/media/backup/joey/4.txt\n/media/backup/day2-diff/joey/2.txt\n/media/backup/day3-diff/joey/3.txt # the old version of the backup is copied here\n\nThe logic is the following: currently I have so many backups that I need to delete them at some point. This is bad luck, because I want to keep at least the files that I deleted and that I changed. This type of backup would allow me to do so.\nSo I was thinking of \n\n\n*\n\n*a dry run rsync TARGET -> SOURCE to get a list of changed files from the perspective of the TARGET\n\n*a script to copy these files to specific folders with the time and date in the folder name\n\n*a regular rsync SOURCE -> TARGET\n\n\nI know this is altering the backup, but I think that given the number of backups I have, this should not be a problem.\nIs there a name for this type of backup (main question). If possible, how would one achieve it on ubuntu? \nI am not sure whether a file that is deleted, should be part of every single diff afterwards. This is a bit a choice between a diff for each backup or one big diff that is incremental. Again, not sure about terminology.\n\nA: It sounds to me like what you are wanting to achieve is exactly the way BackupPC works. See http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/\nYou can install it in Ubuntu using \nsudo apt-get install backuppc\n\nNote however that the default install doesn't do anything on its own. You will have to create configuration files for each machine and/or directory you want backed up. \nThe way BackupPC works is by transferring a copy of the files on the first backup, and then on subsequent backups, creates hard links to the unchanged files and copies the changed ones. SO to your filesystem, when you navigate to the BackupPC backup directory, you have a snapshot of the way the files looked on a particular time.\nSee http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/info.html or install backuppc on your system and read the docs there.\nHere's how to install it (the process may vary in newer versions): How to configure Backuppc in ubuntu 12.04? \nWatch for issues with differing filesystems on different systems (Windows / Linux / Macintosh). Furthermore, differences in the the way the backup volume is connected between the host and the backup clients (network drive vs. local drives for example) will have a huge effect on the time it takes to finish a backup.\n\nA: I would just use git. You can revert changes as necessary and host your \"remote\" repo on a hard drive, another computer, or just about anything else you want to. You can check the status of changes and push to your repo as needed, meaning that a daily backup isn't necessary. That being said, you might want the daily backups, in which case you could write a bash script and run it as acron job if 'git status' reveals changes have occurred.\n", "Q: Ubuntu black screen after install!

And now it's not doing anything AT ALL. It just goes black. And NOTHING AT ALL happens, just stays black. BUT! Ctrl + Alt + Del does restart the PC. Any help now?\n\nA: The problem was: GRUB bugs out when the HDD is the only slave IDE drive. You have to make your way to make it master. After that you have to re-install GRUB, which I did by installing boot repair in a live CD using the advice here on the Ubuntu help wiki.\n", "Q: Acer Laptop Hangs at Ubuntu Installation I have bought an acer aspire e11 es1-111m-c064.

Thank you in advance.\nAndrew\n\nA: If you can use DHCP, do it and delete all DNS settings from the interface, let router assign you the right DNS server to your network card, if you do your settings manually in /etc/network/interfaces or else, you may configure multiple settings for one interface, wlan0 and wlan0:0, one for school and one for other, there use only the necessary DNS servers in each profile. \nAn easy way to see, what is supplying you with wrong IP address, use dig command against schools nameserver.\n$ dig @10.162.X.50 pop.univmtl.ca \n\nLook for A record, your primary nameserver should be the one in school with IP 10.162.XXX.162. If this is right, it means probably another nameserver is being used.

I've tried connecting the same way using other networks and that doesn't work at all. I've made sure numerous times that the credentials are correct. I'm new to Linux in general and would be very appreciative if someone can explain in detail the steps to take so I'm able to connect to my new server remotely from anywhere. \n\nA: Okay. Here's the basics of networking and your problem:\nYou have a local network behind your router, and your brother has a local network behind his. Each one of your local networks are, well, local to you. You are completely isolated from each other. Your server's IP address is 10.0.0.17, right? So if your brother tries to ping that IP, he'll be trying to ping a machine on his network that has that IP. But since he doesn't, he gets a \"host not found\" error.\nIf you want to make him be able to connect to your server from outside your network, you'll have to do something on your router called \"port forwarding\". Right now, your router has a public IP address, say 1.2.3.4. Now this IP, your brother can probably reach, because it's a public IP address. What you'll have to do is go into your router and tell it \"hey, if someone reaches you at port 22 (so if someone reaches 1.2.3.4 on port 22), forward that connection internally to 10.0.0.17 on port 22\". So you'd be telling your router to forward that connection to your server. That's what \"port forwarding\" is, and that's what you have to do to make your server accessible from the internet. When you do this, your brother can connect to 1.2.3.4 using SSH and it should work.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*This all depends on whether your router supports this, but it most likely does. Read this for more information on port forwarding: http://portforward.com/help/portforwarding.htm.\n\n*Your server is not exposed to the internet, the outside world. The outside world is pretty dark, so you have to make sure that you have strong passwords and an up-to-date server (yup, that's why people say we have to update to be secure).\n\n\nIn any case, your problem is not Ubuntu related, and AskUbuntu is certainly not the place to find out how to do port forwarding on your router.\n", "Q: Can not suspend my laptop Asus I can't suspend my Asus laptop: after suspending it resumes again.

The problem is that inside this partition I have all of my media (music, books, etc).\nI want to install Ubuntu on the same drive, wipe the windows partition, but moving my media to the newly created ubuntu partition.\nWhat is the proper way to do this? \nI thought about shrinking the current partition, making a new one and copy over all of my media there, wipe the windows partition and install whatever there. Would there be a problem with that?\n\nA: No at all , it is completely safe to proceed as long as you make sure all important data is passed to the newly created partition\n\nA: Approach 1: a bit long\nThis is your approach. There's nothing wrong with it. Here's how it'll go:\nShrink Windows partition, create a new partition, copy media to new partition, install Ubuntu on Windows partition. Then, you can either copy back the data into Ubuntu and expand, or leave that \"data\" partition there and access it through Ubuntu.\nFor this approach, when you're installing Ubuntu, I would do the following steps (this is assuming your Windows partition is 100GB and you have 4GB RAM):\n\n*\n\n*Pick \"Something Else\" under the \"Installation Type\" when installing Ubuntu. This will give you a list of the partitions you have.\n\n*Select the Windows partition (identify it by its size), delete it.\n\n*Create a partition of size 96GB, choose filesystem ext4, and make it use mount point /.\n\n*Create a partition from the remaining 4GB, filesystem swap.\n\n*Continue with the installation.\n\n*Once you're done, if you can't boot into Ubuntu, boot from your Ubuntu CD/DVD/USB, choose \"Try Ubuntu\", open up the program called Boot-Repair, and click \"Recommended Repair\". That will fix your booting problems.\n\nApproach 2\nCopy your media to an external hard disk, detach the external hard disk, install Ubuntu using the option \"Completely wipe the disk and install Ubuntu\". Once it's done, copy back your media. This approach is much easier, given that you have an external hard disk big enough.\n", "Q: Realtek RTS5138 Card Reader not working I have a Dell N5110 laptop with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on it. My internal card reader is a Realtek RTS5138 is not working (when I plug-in an SD card nothing happens).\nI tried this solution (although it is for Realtek rts5139 and I found an rts5139 module on my system) but it didn't work.\nWhen I plug in and SD card in the internal card reader it appears in the lsusb output:\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 0bda:0138 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.

What you have to do now is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy your current /home contents to your partition,\n\n*Remove the current /home,\n\n*Make a new /home folder and mount your partition over it.\n\n\nHere are the steps you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rsync -aXS --exclude='/*/.gvfs' /home/. /media/habib/home/.\n\n\n*\n\n*This copies your existing /home to your partition, which is currently mounted as /media/habib/home. This might take a while, depending on how big your home folder is.\n\n\n*Once it's done, make sure that everything was copied over to your partition by doing an ls -l /media/habib/home/habib, you should see all your files there.\n\n*Edit fstab by doing sudo nano /etc/fstab and add this line at the end:\nUUID=e42ffcb6-e8f1-4566-b698-fc6913737510   /home    ext4   defaults   0   2\n\nHit Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter to save and close.\n\n*cd / && sudo mv /home /old.home && sudo mkdir /home\n\n\n*\n\n*This moves your /home to /old.home so that we can still keep it instead of deleting it, then creates a new folder called /home.\n\n\n*sudo mount -a\n\n\n*\n\n*This mounts your partition on /home. If all is well, you shouldn't get any errors here.\n\n\n\nDo the following to verify that everything worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls -l /home/habib, you should see all your files there\n\n*df /home, the output line should start with /dev/sda7.\n\n\nIf all of this checked out, then you've been successful! All you need to do now is to remove the old /home to free up space on your root partition. You can do that by sudo rm -r /old.home.\nRead this for more information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\n", "Q: LVM: unable to create snapshot due to failed merge of prior snapshot I inadvertently created a situation where I deleted an LVM snapshot that was pending a merge (yes - bonehead move). Now I can neither finish the merge nor create a new snapshot on the original logical volume.  When I try to create a snapshot I get the following:\n\nroot@ubuntu:~# lvcreate -s -n snap -L 15g /dev/sysvg/syslv\n   Snapshots of an origin that has a merging snapshot is not supported\n\nand in dmesg I see the following logs:\n\nNov 21 20:32:47 ubuntu kernel: [  721.210733] device-mapper: snapshots: Snapshot is marked invalid.\nNov 21 20:32:47 ubuntu kernel: [  721.211641] device-mapper: snapshots: Snapshot is invalid: can't merge\nNov 21 20:32:47 ubuntu kernel: [  721.233283] Buffer I/O error on device dm-4, logical block 16\nNov 21 20:32:47 ubuntu kernel: [  721.233289] Buffer I/O error on device dm-4, logical block 16\n\nThis is not surprising as I did an lvremove of the snapshot (oops).

I switched to btrfs when I upgraded my root hard drives.\nI thought LVM was pretty stable and maybe it is, but being able to break a key feature on casual use with no one seeming to know how to fix it really turned me off to the technology. I am sure it works great for lots of people. Not sure if btrfs is much more stable, but the impression I get is the community is much more responsive and at least I don't have to screw around with installing mdadm and rescanning physical/logical volumes if I need to boot from USB.\nFor the record, upgrade/migration to btrfs was super smooth and I had a mirrored raid configuration up in no time.  My /home was on a separate drive so once I used aptik to reload all my software everything came back up with a few very minor hiccups (e.g. needing to downgrade a package).  All in all, one of the easiest migrations I have ever done.\nSo sorry to end it LVM.  It's not you, it's me. I know that btrfs is younger and maybe sexier and there's a chance that she will go crazy and leave me with a big hole in my data at some point.  But we're happy together and that's important to me. I know that you have a ton of guys wanting you out there, so I'm sure you'll bounce back. After one or two good, meaningless fsck's you'll forget we even had a thing.

Is there any way to prompt for a password in a script in if-up.d?\nFor example this doesn't work because there is no DISPLAY variable set (setting one doesn't help):\n# create temp file to store password\ntmp=`tempfile`\n\nxterm -e /bin/bash -c \"read -s -p \\\"Enter password: \\\" mypassword; echo \\\"\\$mypassword\\\" > $tmp\"\n\n# read in password and delete temp file\nmypassword=`cat $tmp`\nrm -f $tmp\necho $mypassword\n\n\nA: Ok, so mainly you will want to do two things: add a prompt when you start your desktop session, asking for your password, and make a prompt each time the interface is brought up again.\nSo, you will need to use an Upstart session job to guarantee you that an X session is started and the DISPLAY variable is set. Session jobs go in ~/.config/upstart/, not /etc/init/, and they are run as a non-root user. You will need to make sure that your desktop sessions actually use Upstart as a session init. Unity definitely does this, some other Ubuntu flavors do as well. Just run initctl list-sessions to see if you have any Upstart sessions started to tell.\nAnyway, here is the session job to use:\n# change IFACE= to whatever interface it is, unless it is all interfaces.\n# in that case just omit the IFACE=\nstart on desktop-start or :sys:net-device-up IFACE=eth99\n\ntask\n\n# put your script in this location\nexec /usr/local/bin/unilan-password\n\nAlso, you will most likely want to use Zenity to prompt the user, not an xterm. The following can be used instead of your bash command:\nmypassword=$(zenity --entry --text=\"Enter University LAN password\" --hide-text)\n\n$(command) is just a nicer way to do command substitution than command, if you did not recognize it. Make sure you have the zenity package installed, of course.\n", "Q: installing Ubuntu Openstack - Canonical Distribution on a virtual environment I've tried to install Ubuntu Openstack - Canonical Distribution using this new Ubuntu guide.\nDuring step 3, i use the following command to install MaaS;\nsudo apt install maas\n\nI've received this error:\n\nThere is also an error when I try to install the maas-region-controller:\n\nThis means that the error is related to PostgreSQL.\nHas anyone reported the same error, and how does one resolve that? \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: From OP's second comment;\nI resolved the problem with re-installing MaaS via the Ubuntu ISO, without using the CLI. \n", "Q: 14.10 Cannot connect to internet through a wired connection. Still trying before install I'm currently attempting to install 14.1 on a new computer via USB. No Wireless. It's plugged into the ethernet port on a Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 ATX mother board with an AMD FX-6350 3.9 GHz 6 core processor. I tried 14.04 but it wouldn't even boot, when I looked into that it appeared to be a conflict with the mobo or processor. Right now I'm just running from the \"try ubuntu before you install\" option. I'd like to be connected to the internet before I consider installing. I'm not super familiar with the ubuntu terminal but I'm not afraid to mess with it.

It worked for me on Ubuntu 15.04\n\nA: I have two ideas of which I recommend you plan on trying both.  My first thought was that you should prepare another USB install thumbdrive, this time using 12.04, and I suggest that only because there seem to be a lot of complaints about 14.04.  My second thought may be better though.  I suggest you make a second install thumbdrive, but this time the same version you are attempting already.  The reason is that I've seen install thumbdrives fail to write properly.  Use a new thumbdrive, as the drives themselves can be flaky, and preferably download a fresh copy of the ISO file as well, in case it is corrupt.\nI'm not a huge fan of Gigabyte brand motherboards, but they don't typically display the problems you are describing.\n", "Q: Nautilus keeps re-creating thumbnails I'm have a thumbnail problem on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine where my thumbnails won't stay deleted.

I would like to buy a laptop for my research, which also, will be my first Ubuntu-only laptop. After searching for a design, with decent specs and ubuntu compatibility (although I did not find one here in which the community agreed) I think that the most convenient, in my case, would be the Dell Inspirion 15 7000 series:\nhttp://www.dell.com/uk/business/p/inspiron-15-7537/pd. \nIn Spain this model comes in two versions: The first one would be with a Intel HD Graphics 4400 and the second with a NVIDIA GeForce GT750M (I will not be using it for gaming or any graphics consuming task).\nI seems there is not 100% compatibility with any of the models but I would love to hear user experiences with both cards about the following issues:\n1) Noise, heating\n2) How easy are the drivers to install? (Using bumblebee or the intel utility)\n3) Which option offers better user experience, for example, brightness controls, software compatibility, updates....\nAny advice would be most welcome, thanks. \n\nA: I have a lenovo Y510P with a nvidia 775m & only use the Intel Graphics  for Ubuntu. Why? -\nMobile nvidia adapters are Optimus. If setting the laptop to nvidia only then that's done thru nvidia-prime. In that case there is no vsync at all which is unacceptable here when using an ubuntu session. The way bumblebee is used also provides an unacceptable solution.\nSo irregardless of whether you purchase the Intel only or the Nvidia card laptop the odds are you'll just be using Intel.\nAs far as Intel drivers what's provided by 14.04 for Intel by default is just fine, no need to install anything.\n\nA: You can visit the following link to see if your laptop is compatible:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/\nPer the site there, your laptop is compatible.\nI can not answer on noise and heat. I can answer on drivers for the video cards.  I have never had any luck in compiling the drivers for Nvidia video cards myself.  Downloading NVIDIA drivers and installing them are tricky and they have never worked for me.  I managed to install the available drivers by running the following command in Terminal:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nThis option could be sufficient for you as you have stated that you won't be gaming or utilizing graphic intensive applications that may require the latest version of NVIDIA drivers.  Using the above method will install NVIDIA drivers, but they will be a couple of versions behind.\nIntel drivers are much easier to deal with.  I have managed to install drivers for Ubuntu straight off the Intel site by simply downloading them:\nhttps://01.org/linuxgraphics/\nOnce you have downloaded the drivers, you will need to add keys to Ubuntu's software package manager (\"apt\"). Open a terminal, and execute these line:\n$ wget --no-check-certificate https://download.01.org/gfx/RPM-GPG-KEY-ilg -O - | \\\n> sudo apt-key add -\n$ wget --no-check-certificate https://download.01.org/gfx/RPM-GPG-KEY-ilg-2 -O - | \\\n> sudo apt-key add -\n\nThen you can run the deb file to install the graphics installer.  Note that the graphics installer will only install it, and not run.  To actually install the drivers once the installer is installed, run the following command from a terminal:\n$ sudo intel-linux-graphics-installer\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: parsing JSON data QML As in topic, I'm trying to parse this json data in to my QML project\nlink:  http://www.rad.io/info/menu/valuesofcategory?category=_genre\nSo I have list of 188 elements but don't know how to get value of each element...\nhere is a link to JSONListModel component I used in this example\nhere is qml code:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.1\nimport \"../components\"\nimport Ubuntu.Components.ListItems 1.0 as ListItem\n\n\nPage {\n    title: i18n.tr(\"by Genre\")\n\n\n    JSONListModel {\n        id: json\n        source: \"http://www.rad.io/info/menu/valuesofcategory?category=_genre\"\n        query: \"$\"\n    }\n\n\n    UbuntuListView {\n        height: parent.height\n        width: parent.width\n        clip: true\n        model: json.model\n        cacheBuffer: contentHeight\n\n\n        delegate: ListItem.Standard {\n            text: index + \"  \" + indexValue\n        }\n\n    }    \n\n}\n\n\nA: I'm no expert on JSONListModel so I may be mistaken, but it seems to be expecting to iterate over a list of Objects.  What you get from rad.io is a list of strings, which seems to be causing your problems.  But since you don't need to do any fancy processing of the result, it's easy to roll this by hand.\nWhat you want to do is parse the response into a list (usingJSON.parse).  Then you can go through the elements of the list.  For each, you create an object and append that to a ListModel.  Note that the ListModel takes objects, not strings.  Then the delegate can reference the properties of those objects.\nExample code:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.1\nimport Ubuntu.Components.ListItems 1.0 as ListItem\n\nMainView {\n    width: 300\n    height: 600\n    property string source: \"http://www.rad.io/info/menu/valuesofcategory?category=_genre\"\n\n    ListModel {\n        id: listModel\n    }\n\n    Component.onCompleted: {\n        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest;\n        xhr.open(\"GET\", source);\n        xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {\n            if (xhr.readyState == XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {\n                var list = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);\n                listModel.clear();\n                for (var i in list)\n                    listModel.append({ \"genre\": list[i] });\n            }\n        }\n        xhr.send();\n    }\n\n    Page {\n        title: i18n.tr(\"by Genre\")\n\n        UbuntuListView {\n            height: parent.height\n            width: parent.width\n            clip: true\n            model: listModel\n            cacheBuffer: contentHeight\n\n            delegate: ListItem.Standard {\n                text: index + \"  \" + genre\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nLet me take a moment to remind you of the importance of posting short, self-contained, correct examples.  The code you posted failed to run not because of any problem with parsing JSON, but because a Tab cannot be a top-level widget.  Anyone who tried to help you first had to figure out that before getting to the real problem.\nAlso, when using a non-default component, like JSONListModel, please note this fact and point us to where it can be found.  The less work it takes to reproduce the problem, the better.\n\nA: Actually no data is stored in your ListModel.\nI suppose you are using this, from GitHub.\nJSONListModel is filled by using the method append(jsobject dict) from QtQuick ListModel. This method requires a role and a value to be specified, but the json data you get from rad.io contains only the values.\nFor that reason, ListElements are added in your model, but they don't contain any data.\nYou can check this, by adding the following lines in your delegate:\nComponent.onCompleted: {\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(json.model.get(model.index)))\n}\n\nI'd suggest you to read the content of the json file you download from the web, using XMLHttpRequest, and then parse it and add its content to a string list (or a var). You will be able to access the content through a ListView, using the modelData role.\n", "Q: How to mount an extra partition in Ubuntu 14.04 I have a desktop computer with two hard-drives.

This would only bring up the menu about one time in five. I think it's because the mohterboard is so new and so very fast at getting to the bootloader stage.\nThen I chose to go into rescue mode and then from the menu when to a root prompt.\nAfter getting a root prompt I did the usual..\n # mount -o remount,rw\n\nOnce the file system is in rw mode I then edited to the sudoers file.\nLeasons learned\n\n\n*\n\n*Always use visudo to edit your sudoers file so that syntax is checked for you before saving.\n\n\n\n # sudo visudo\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Annoying, ubuntu uses nano as it's default text editor, which put me off using visudo.

In Ubuntu the normal way to gain superuser access is via sudo which is a way of using your own user account to gain superuser access.  In this case, the password it wants will be your own account password.\nNote: It pays to be suspicious of anything that claims to require your password or superuser access.

I shut down the NAS and booted into a machine with an Ubuntu Live Cd and attached one of the NAS drives.\nI made an image of the drive using DD and now have an oldhd.img file on an external drive.\nI then moved to a new machine, booted up with the Live CD attached the external drive and changed to the external drive directory and ran this command \nmount -r -o loop oldhd.img /mnt\n\nThen I ran fdisk -l and saw the drive I need to be recovered was /dev/sdb\nI changed dir to my computer's hard drive folder and ran:\nextundelete /dev/sdb --restore-all\n\nIt returns :\nextundelete - failed to read-only open device \"/dev/sdb\": Error code 2133571347\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? And what should I do instead?\n\nA: When you use mount with the -r option, the filesystem is mounted read only.  In order to do any writing to the disk you must not mount in read only.\nSo, the command should be\nmount -o loop oldhd.img /mnt\n\nAlso, from a sourceforge forum post:\n\nError code 2133571347 is  \"EXT2_ET_BAD_MAGIC\"\n  This means there is no valid signature for the superblock.\nEither:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The superblock is corrupt, in which case you can try to open the file system with help of the superblock copies. see options -b blocknumber and -B blocksize, or \n  \n*You have made ​​a mistake during the creation of the file system image, or \n  \n*You have created an image of the entire disk, not a copy of the file system, in which case you must specify offset options for losetup.\n  \n\n", "Q: Can't ping my ubuntu pc from Windows 7 pc Windows 7 \nIpadress:        192.168.1.3\nSubnet

Can I upgrade using a mobile internet connection?\n\nA: *\n\n*There is a low but relevant risk, that upgrading to another release will damage the data in your home directory or anywhere outside of system folders. Keeping a backup of important data in case of a hardware failure, a software bug, or a user error is a good idea anyway. There's a saying that “data without a backup is unimportant data.”\n\n*You should always have a bootable Ubuntu live system on a removable storage medium prepared and handy while upgrading in case the upgrading procedure is stuck in an inconsistent state or booting becomes impossible for some other reason. Downloading that is roughly 1 GB.\n\n*The mode of internet connection is irrelevant for the upgrading process, as long as it's stable (which may be a problem with mobile connections depending on the local service). You may need to re-install drivers once you boot the new kernel after the procedure is finished, if it doesn't work out of the box.\n\n*I agree with bolzao that the upgrade procedure should download roughly 400–500 MB. If you have an external installation medium (like I suggested to have anyway), you can use it as a package source, so you don't have to download packages twice. Ubuntu should offer you to register its installation medium as a package source as soon as you put or plug it in.\n", "Q: List all available display managers How can I get the list of all the display managers installed in my Ubuntu laptop from the terminal?\n\nA: It is possible to search for x-display-manager meta used in Debian package that provide an X display manager.\nUsing aptitude:\naptitude search '~i~Px-display-manager'\n\nOr debconf:\n./dm_list.sh\n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\n\n# source debconf library\n. /usr/share/debconf/confmodule\n\n# set default display manager\nDEFAULT_DISPLAY_MANAGER_FILE=/etc/X11/default-display-manager\n\nCHOICES=\nif db_metaget shared/default-x-display-manager choices; then\n  CHOICES=\"$RET\"\nfi\n\necho $CHOICES\necho default $DEFAULT_DISPLAY_MANAGER_FILE\n\nsudo ./dm_list.sh\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*DEBIAN/config file from lightdm debian package\n\n*How do I get a list of packages that “Provides” something\" using dpkg?\n", "Q: KVM/Spice/Remote-Viewer: Need assistance troubleshooting USB redirection Bottom line up front: I'm unable to redirect USB from my desktop to the VM. 'USB Device Selection ' is always grayed out in Remote-Viewer and in full screen it says that 'USB redirection support not compiled in'.\nThe details: \nThe host KVM server is Ubuntu Server 14.04 and I have installed qemu-kvm (kvm -version = QEMU emulator version 2.0.0 (Debian 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.7)), libvirt-bin, bridge-utils, ssh.\nThe guest is a Win7 VM which was created using virt-manager remotely from an ubuntu desktop. Some of the pertinent settings for the VM: the display is set to Spice, video is set to QXL, there is a 'Controller USB' present, there is a 'Redirected USB' present.\nThe desktop which I'm trying to redirect USB from is Win7 and I'm using Remote-Viewer which came from spice-space.org.\nI have been reading lots of information and everything tells me that this should be working. When I connect to the VM with Remote-Viewer, the menu item for 'USB device selection' is always grayed out and if full screen it then says the 'USB redirection support not compiled in'. I'm not sure if this message is accurate or not, because I'm under the impression that Remote-Viewer has this compiled in by default. In fact, looking through the files in the installation folder, there is one the shows all the dependencies and it is in there. So I'm not sure where to go from here for troubleshooting. I have looked at lots of things in terms of configuration and nothing jumps out at me. If someone could point me in a direction to aid in troubleshooting this, it would be most appreciated!\nUpdate #1 (11/28/2014):\nI took 'audiomobster' advice and compiled qemu on the host that I'm trying to get the USB redirection to work on. Below are the commands I used to compile.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends -y build-dep qemu\nwget http://wiki.qemu-project.org/download/qemu-2.1.0.tar.bz2\ntar -xvf qemu-2.1.0.tar.bz2\ncd qemu-2.1.0/\n./configure --enable-usb-redir\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThe compilation ran without error and afterwards I was able to run $ kvm --version and I get the updated version that I just compiled returned. QEMU emulator version 2.1.0, Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard. I can run virt-manager remotely against it and I can still run the VM, but I still get the same message ('USB redirection support not compiled in') in virt-viewer (remote-viewer). I have been assuming the message is referring to qemu, but I'm now wondering if it is referring to 'remote-viewer' itself? I got the remote-viewer ('virt-viewer' on the page) from http://www.spice-space.org/download.html. Based on the docs that I have read, it sounds like the Windows binaries should work with USB redirection just as they are. Anyone out there using it successfully without changes of any kind for USB redirection? If I can rule that out, I think I can continue to focus my troubleshooting on qemu and the comms between my desktop and the host. Sort of working through process of elimination at this point. Again, appreciate any thoughts on this issue...thanx!\n\nA: Although I've got a gentoo flavor maybe this gives you a hint.\nRecompiling qemu and spice-gtk with usbredir USE flag did the job for me.

You could use -name instead. \n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean about sorting, unless you want to change the directory layout, but here's why it's not working...\nPart of the problem is that by using '>' you're redirecting output of the grep command to a file called 'cp' instead of using a pipe '|' to the 'cp' command.\nHowever the bigger problem is that your grep command is probably never returning (or perhaps returning nothing), as you're using grep -r '.mp3' ./  instead of grep '.mp3' -r ./  Also, I imagine grep is probably looking for .mp3 in the content of the files rather than the file names.\ntry:\ncd /media/dan/RAID/MUSIC\nfind . -name '*.mp3'\n\nif that lists all of the files you wish to copy, try:\nfind . -name '*.mp3' -exec cp --parents \"{}\" /home/dan/Music \\;\n\nthe --exec runs a command for each file matched by find, the --parents preserves the full path of the file (otherwise all files would be copied into /home/dan/Music instead of /home/dan/Music/subdir1, etc..), {} refers to the currently matched file.  I've put quotes around it because audio files often have spaces in them. the \\; is how you terminate the command for --exec\nHope this helps.

I am using Gnome Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS. I have noticed that padding between two indicators are too much in shell, which I would like to decrease it.\n\nI tried using shell extension available but it didn't worked.\nThen, I edited gnome-shell.css & decreased padding but surprisingly it didn't worked either.\nPlease help me in decreasing padding between two indicators in shell.\nThanks.\n\nA: As with some Gnome extensions, installing doesn't work if the extension says it does not support that version of Gnome - even if it does work. So to install it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the extension from the extension homepage:https://bitbucket.org/mathematicalcoffee/status-area-horizontal-spacing-gnome-shell-extension/downloads/gnome3.8_status-area-horizontal-spacing@mathematical.coffee.gmail.com.zip\n\n*Extract the status-area-horizontal-spacing@mathematical.coffee.gmail.com folder to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/status-area-horizontal-spacing@mathematical.coffee.gmail.com/\n\n*Run gedit ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/status-area-horizontal-spacing@mathematical.coffee.gmail.com/metadata.json, and edit the shell-version to include 3.10:\n   \"shell-version\": [\n    \"3.4\", \n    \"3.6\", \n    \"3.8\",\n    \"3.10\"\n  ], \n\n\n*Enable the extension from Gnome Tweak Tool. This method works with quite alot of extensions, but does not always work. You may need to restart the shell with Alt+F2+r\nYou can also modify the theme to have a different spacing - this can be done by finding the theme's directory (e.g. /usr/share/themes/ZukitwoGreen/gnome-shell, ~/.local/share/themes/ZukitwoGreen/gnome-shell), and editing the gnome-shell.css file to have a different hpadding (you can use find and replace) - e.g. mine is:\n-natural-hpadding: 4px;\n-minimum-hpadding: 4px;\n\nI think this is also available as a option under the 'Elegance colours' customizable theme.\n\nA: There is no need for extensions. In Ubuntu 18.04 (Gnome 3.28.4), the stylesheet is named /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/ubuntu.css. Around line 680:.panel-button > natural-hpadding must be adjusted. If the space is still too big for your taste, also reduce minimum-hpadding:\n#panel .panel-button {\n    -natural-hpadding: 12px;  /* change HERE, e.g. 6px */\n    -minimum-hpadding: 6px;   /* and here, e.g. 3px */\n    font-weight: bold;\n    color: #eee;\n    text-shadow: 0px 0px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);\n    transition-duration: 100ms;\n}\n\nIf you don't want to restart, you can also only reload the theme via\ngdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.Shell --object-path /org/gnome/Shell --method org.gnome.Shell.Eval 'Main.loadTheme();'\n\nSource.\n", "Q: Jitsi / XMMS : always offline, unable to connect I tried Jitsi, (xmpp account created trough Jitsi was successful).

My solution is to install PlayOnLinux, and run Firefox through wine.  Then, install silverlight in the same prefix as Firefox.\nYou have to use the wine version of firefox for these sites, but it works decently well.  The automatic video quality usually sets the quality really low, but everything is watchable.\n\nA: You can configure Amazon prime to use flash for web browser streaming via their settings page.  It will work with firefox using pepperflash, however, I cannot get chrome with pepperflash to work (Chrome: Version 39.0.2171.95 (64-bit), Ubuntu: 14.10).

I have a Western Digital My Book 3TB External Drive Plugged into my PC that I bought from one store because it was on sale and I needed extra storage capacity. Then, at another store, I saw they sold the same external hard drive with a 4TB Disk Capacity. I also have 5 SanDisk Cruiser Glide flash drives, completely identical except for the fact that one of the drives has 16 GigaBytes of storage, another has 128 GigaBytes of storage, and the rest have 32 GigaBytes worth of storage.\nSo, with all this info, I believe manufacturers are manufacturing the drives with the same parts but limiting the capacity of the drive that's allocated and the prices are higher when the capacities are higher. So, my question's are if it's possible to expand the total storage capacity of these devices, such as expanding the 16GB Flash Drive to 128GB and the 3TB Hard Drive to 4TB, how do I do it?

Thank you in advance for your responses.\n\nA: Try these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Redownload the ISO, as it could be corrupt\n\n*(If you're on Windows) Try use a program such as Universal USB Installer\n\n*Try use UNetbootin (Windows, Mac and Linux)\n\n\nIt could be something to do with UEFI; if so I'm no help there as I don't have a UEFI machine.\n\nA: It could be that your USB Stick is too large with 256 GB of storage, and \"corrupted\" from creating a bootable image. Normal people have USB with 8, 16 or max 32 GB, or DVD's of 4.7 GB ;)\nI have one suggestion on that issue: I boot my Ubuntu Live CD from my phone via DriveDroid app. You can get it for Android and iPhone and it mounts via cable all ISO's except Windows images. Check the link for more detailed description and report if it helps you. Best regards!\nBooting via Phone\n\nA: The problem was I have UEFI, I had to play around in the BIOS settings to get it to properly boot. I turned off secure and fast boot. It won't allow me to set my USB as my default boot so I will have to do that manually but that's no big deal. Thank you to all who helped on this question. Very much appreciated.  \n", "Q: Problem in accessing hard drives by programs Until today I used Ubuntu 12.04, but after many suggestions to update to 14.04, I finally did so. However, I am no longer able to use artemis (a DNA sequence analysis program) when it needs to open files on external and internal extra hard drives. The program works normally when it has files on the main hard drive, but it looks like it has no \"permission\" to open the extra hard drives. Same happens from the terminal. When using a dir /media command, I see only two of my hard drives, yet I can easily get at my files at those drives through the file windows. Other programs, seaview, libroffice don't have this problem, but the NCBI BLAST program has neither access to files on the external drives. \nWould much appreciate a solution, as I am getting pretty upset about this.\nAny suggestions are more than welcome.\nJan Veenstra\n\nA: The mount location for user mountable drives has changed from 12.04 to 14.04:\n/media/drive became /media/$USER/drive\nIrritating at first, but makes sense.\n", "Q: Apache problem while I restart it When I try to restart the apache I get an error massage :\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting web server apache2                                         [fail]\n\n*The apache2 configtest failed.\n\n\nOutput of config test was:\nAH00526: Syntax error on line 20 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/zzz-deny-generic.conf:\nInvalid ServerName \"*\" use ServerAlias to set multiple server names.\nAction 'configtest' failed.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Probably at line 20 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/zzz-deny-generic.conf is present something like:\n ServerName *\n\nAccording to Apache documentation, ServerName syntax is:\n ServerName [scheme://]fully-qualified-domain-name[:port]\n\nAs I can understand this last configuration file would deny any request that is not matched by previous VirtualHost. \nDepending on your specific situation you could remove ServerName directive.\n", "Q: \"Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\" when trying to install dnsutils?

When I power the computer on, it loads grub boot loader and when I select Ubuntu 14.04-LTS, the computer almost immediately shuts off.\nI can only log boot the computer if I turn off my BIOS ACPI control and load Ubuntu on recovery mode, and resume a normal boot. \nI'm not sure if this is a software or hardware problem. Can anyone give me some instructions on how I can start debugging?\n\nA: I changed a few parameters on my BIOS and now my PC seems to be working properly. My changes were: \n1 - Enabled the Limit CPUID MaxVal option. The manual says \"Use this item to enable or disable the Max CPU ID value limit. When suppports Prescott and LGA775 CPUs, enables this to prevent the system from “rebooting” when trying to install Windows NT 4.0.\"\n2 - Performance mode from standard to enhanced mode, which allows overclocking. Although I disabled all overclocking options.\nI can now boot with standard kernel parameters. I have no idea why this worked.\n\nA: I encountered a very similar issue on CentOS.  It's not Ubuntu, but at that stage of the boot process, it's just Grub and a Linux kernel 4.x so they're equivalent for the intents and purposes of this fix.\nMy problem stemmed from the fact that I had recently copied all my data to a new hard drive, so all the UUIDs of my filesystems were different.  I had updated my /etc/fstab/, but my Grub config was still looking for the old root fs UUID.  Regenerating my Grub config solved the problem. After it booted, SELinux had to redo a bunch of things (automatic process), so if you're using that, you might see your system take longer than normal to boot on the first go.  I don't know how AppArmor behaves with this.\nOn Ubuntu, I believe you can regenerate the Grub config with sudo update-grub.\nThe reason the rescue system might work is because it does more advanced checks and filesystem hunts, so it can probably figure something out that Grub has to be explicitly programmed to do.\n\nA: (If I understand your question) If you can boot without the BIOS ACPI and able to boot in, you should look at the syslog.  It records everything from the very start of the computers boot cycle and what is causing it to fail to load.\nnano /var/log/syslog\n\n", "Q: How to use a Ubuntu 13.04 (amd64 .deb) program on 14.10 I have a Toshiba L505D-S5965 laptop with Ubuntu 14.10, I am trying to install was the Dolphin Emulator but all I see is the 13.04 (amd64 .deb) link. Is there some compatibility mode like Windows or will I have to wait?\n\nA: Ubuntu has no 'reverse compatibility' mode, at least, not in the same sense as Windows does.  Even in Windows, the 'compatibility mode' does not account for older, non-compatible dependencies for programs.\nTo get older software installed into 14.10, you would have to download the .deb file, and attempt to install it.  You might run into issues such as dependencies being out of date, or too new, or just being totally obsolete and unavailable, in which case you have to then download each of those dependencies and install them manually.\nWhen working with old software and ancient dependencies, as well, you will always run the risk of breaking your system.  I would suggest compiling the software from source, if they provide such a method to do so.  If using the older .deb is the only remaining option, then you are free to attempt to use it, but be warned you might not be able to install that because the dependencies for the software might all be gone, or your software is too new, or any number of other issues.\n", "Q: Problem With Guest Additions in Ubuntu Server [Virtual Box] I have a problem installing Guest additions in ubuntu server with kernel 3.13.0-39-generic\nI install whole headers for this kernel with \n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) dkms\nAnd when i do \n$ ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\nReturns this error:\n\"The headers for the current running kernel were not found.

Don't forget to check documentation in /usr/share/doc/virtualbox.\nIf you want the have the file sharing stuff in the virtual machine, just install virtualbox-guest-utils and have a look in /usr/share/doc/virtualbox-guest-utils.

That's probably what's causing your problem.\nI'm not using Kubuntu myself, but you should open the GUI for the language settings. Somewhere there you have probably selected Algeria as the country. To get a valid locale name, change that to e.g. United States or United Kingdom.\nNext you should better remove that erroneous line in /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local:\nsudo sed -i '/ar__AR/d' /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local\n\nThen log out and log in again.\nFinally regenerate your locale:\nsudo locale-gen --purge\n\nThis time the output should be clean from error messages except for the ones about LC_MONETARY and LC_ADDRESS in ar_SD.UTF-8.\n", "Q: How to reduce streaming latency Pulseaudio output using Rygel?

(source) This means that even with no compression there is likely 1.5 seconds (stereo) to 3.0 seconds (mono) delay simply filling those buffers. Likely much more delay if using compression techniques that reduce the size of audio samples drastically, eg. you can likely fit 5+ seconds of audio into a 64K buffer.\nYou can try disabling compression as a workaround.\nOne can also modify the 64K buffer size in source and recompile.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't start after installation / live from USB today I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my old (x64) computer.\nI installed it from a live USB stick (created with unetbootin, FAT).\nAfter the sucessfull installation on the hard disk I rebooted the PC.

If I am correct that VMware Player in Ubuntu doesn't require to install the full Windows OS.

These flags prevent certain obvious programming bugs from being ignored by the compiler.  That means less debugging work for the programmer.\n\n*I advocate the use of the -s option with make.  It eliminates (usually) unnecessary verbosity.\n\n*One feature of make is that it doesn't recompile your program if it doesn't need to.  This can be a nice time-saver if the program takes a long time to compile.  This is especially useful if your project has more than one source (.cpp) file, since these can be compiled independently -- and even in parallel (simultaneously) with the -j option.\n\n\nA: First you need to compile and link your program. Assuming the source code is saved in a file yourprog.cpp, you can do that using the GNU C++ compiler g++, for example\ng++ -Wall -o yourprog yourprog.cpp\n\nThe resulting executable will be called yourprog and you can then run it using\n./yourprog\n\n\nA: open a terminal and execute the following\n1- g++ -o outfilename.bin source.cpp\n2- ./outfilename.bin\nthat assumes the source file is source.cpp\n\nA: *\n\n*Open terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+t\n\n*Install GNU C++ Compiler by running following command:  \nsudo apt-get install g++  \n\n\n*Now compile the cpp source file by running this command:  \ng++ sourceFile.cpp -o anything  \n\n\n*You can now run the file like this:\n./anything  \n\n\nA: There's a nifty package called binfmtc that allows you to run C++ files as if if they were \"scripts\" -- not requiring an explicit compilation step.\nOnce the binfmtc package is installed, your source file needs a /*BINFMTCXX: ... header comment (see example) and mark the .cpp file as executable using chmod +x.\n/*BINFMTCXX: -Wall -Werror\n*/\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// main () is where program execution begins\nint main()\n{\n  cout << \"Hello World\";        // prints Hello World\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\nSetup steps:\n$ sudo apt install binfmtc\n$ chmod +x ./first-time-to-run-c-program-on-ubuntu-14-04.cpp\n\nRunning the \"script\":\n$ ./first-time-to-run-c-program-on-ubuntu-14-04.cpp\nHello World\n\n\nA: First, you save it to a file, most likely by pressing ctrl+s, then compile it. To compile it, run the following command:\ng++ path/to/that/file.cpp -o path/to/output/file.out\n\nThen just drag the output file to the terminal window to run it, because it is now an executable file.\nYou need to use g++ because c++ is a compiled language, meaning you need a compiler to compile it into machine code. This results in c++ being a faster language than others.\n", "Q: Assembly: TASM illegal command Few weeks ago I asked for a similar TASM compiler, but seems that the instructor wants nothing but TASM.

You can make use of cron job log file to verify that.

You can check the syslog at the location /var/log to trace it out.\n\n*Try reducing your key_buffer_size to 1MB and watch if it is still getting crashed.\nIf still getting crashed upgrading RAM should be the final option.\n\n*I also recommend that you run a mysqltuner script and let me know the output.\n", "Q: Asus Q302LA Wifi Problems: Intel Wireless 7260 I'm using a live USB for Ubuntu and it's not detecting the Wifi connection on my Asus Q302LA. \nI can't use an Ethernet cable because I don't have an Ethernet port on my laptop. \nHow should I proceed? \n\nA: You will probably need internet connection for installing the driver. \nHow much i know from our little chat, you have a Note 4 Android phone connected to your WiFi.\nTry to set up USB Tethering on the phone and connect the phone to Ubuntu via USB cable, it should work out from the box for working internet connection.\nNext step is on Ubuntu, go to System Settings->Software & Updates->Ubuntu Software Tab.\nCheck \"Proprietary drivers for devices (restricted)\"  and go to tab labeled \"Additional Drivers\" to check if there is a driver availible for your WiFi card.\nReport back if solved or you need more info.\nP.S.  if you are new to Ubuntu this guide is great for setting up a new system:\nhttp://howtoubuntu.org/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-14-04-trusty-tahr\n\nA: I couldn't stay connected to WiFi with my brand new ASUS Q302LA.

I am doing a project for my operating systems class. In Virtualbox, I have already installed the Guest additions and restarted, but it is still the same screen resolution.  I am using the \"Try Ubuntu\" option since I do not want to get rid of the Windows 7 that I already have on my computer. I am using Ubuntu Gnome 14.10 desktop and Vitrualbox 4.3.20. I have never dealt with Ubuntu before, so I am a complete novice.  \n\nA: A guest operating system installed in Virtual Box will not alter the host operating system in any way other than using some hard drive space for a virtual disk.\nInstalling Ubuntu in Virtual Box will not affect your host installation. In fact it is a good approach to test Ubuntu and it's various flavours without the need to repartition a hard drive.\nTo be able to run Ubuntu in variable screen resolutions and to be able to benefit from a virtual graphics adapter for hardware video acceleration we need to install the guest additions within the guest. These will install as a kernel module loaded on booting the guest.\nTherefore guest additions will not be available when booting a live system (\"Try out Ubuntu\"). They need a proper installation on a virtual drive.\n", "Q: SSD crashed with error no boot device fount My 256GB SSD crashed and when I start my laptop I get errors saying no boot device found.

You have to modify the config file from another computer running linux (or windows, if you've got good command line knowledge with Cygwin). \nRunning update-grub while using /cow (which is a casper filesystem on your USB mounted as / in your setup) will have it try to update the grub entries of the root partition, which isn't actually where grub runs from in the case of a liveUSB. It runs from a device other than /cow, then changes into /cow for your usage.\nOstensibly, you could chroot into the /rofs loop device (loop means the filesystem is in a literal file instead of a physical disk), as running update-grub there would actually update the grub of the file used to run the liveUSB enviroment. \nUnfortunately, the image used here isn't updateable as it's mounted write-only (as it should be! You don't want temporary filesystems modifying themselves). I'd recommend you try using two USBs, one with the live disk, and the other to install to. Make sure you disconnect the hard drive of the computer you use, to avoid grub (or worse, the whole linux system you're trying to install) from installing over whatever bootloader is already there.\nSource: I've been trying in vain to do just what I imagine you were trying to do, and have learned a lot along the way.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1 no audio, Dummy output , model lenovo z570 codec Realtek ALC272 cat /proc/asound/card0/codec* | grep Codec \n\noutput:\n\n   Codec: Realtek ALC272\n   Codec: Intel CougarPoint HDMI\n\n laptop Model: Lenovo z570\n\n  \"HD-Audio-Models.txt\" contains\n\n  ALC662/663/272\n  ==============\n  asus-mode1    ASUS\n  asus-mode2    ASUS\n  asus-mode3    ASUS\n  asus-mode4    ASUS\n  asus-mode5    ASUS\n  asus-mode6    ASUS\n  asus-mode7    ASUS\n  asus-mode8    ASUS \n\nI tried all nothing worked, also \"options snd-hda-intel model=auto\" didn't work.\n\nA: this is the bug, this happens after a hard shutdown.  \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/1264213 \n\nfixed it. now sound works properly. but wasted a lot of time doing nonsense for days.\n\nadded this line to the file \"/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\"\n\n      \"options snd-hda-intel model=ideapad\"  and then\n\n       \"sudo alsa force-reload\"   and then\n\n       reboot\n\nfor more info visit this thread => http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1316634 \n\n\nedit: \n\n    the above solution is not a permanent solution.\n    Installing NVidia driver fixed the problem.

I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a Dell XPS 420 that has 2 hard disks of 750GB each.  There is still plenty of room on the first disk.  I am using it to store old photos and music so it will soon fill up.  \nThe second disk wasn't formatted during the Ubuntu installation so I used GParted to format it in one volume as ext4, but then found I don't have permission to copy any files onto it as it belongs to Root.  \nIf I keep going and fill up the first disk will Root Ubuntu automatically overflow my home folder with pictures and music onto the second disk please?  Otherwise is it ok to reformat the second disk as NTFS and store stuff on it but not in my home folder under music or pictures?\n\nA: In the current configuration Ubuntu doesn't automagically use the free space on the secondary drive. There are multiple solutions to your problem. The easiest would probably be to make use of the ext4 file system you already created on it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach or mount¹ the file system on the secondary disk, e. g. through Nautilus or Gnome Disks. By default it should then be mounted¹ to a directory in /media or /media/$USER, where $USER is your local login name. I'll refer to this directory, the mount point¹, by [mountpoint].\n\n*Now you need to transfer the ownership of the root directory of said file system to your user account. To that purpose open a terminal with a command interpreter (e. g. through the application Gnome Terminal) and type:\nsudo chown \"$USER:\" [mountpoint]\n\nAs soon as you press Enter, you'll be asked to authenticate yourself with your account password (press Enter again), because the root directory of new file systems initially belong to the system.\n\n*You should now be able to access and write to that file system with your regular user account and without system-level or super-user¹ privileges.\n¹ This term is the common technical term in the Linux and Unix world. I tried to explain it with more colloquial terms, so you grasp their meaning from the context.\n\nA: Not by default.

Many distros adopted systemd and left init why does Ubuntu still use init?\n\nA: As far as I am aware, there has been no additional movement on systemd vs. upstart vs System V Init in the mailing lists for 15.04.  There was a summit meeting on this during the last Ubuntu Online Summit for developers, as seen here.  As far as I am aware, that was the last set of discussion on the issue.  It is likely there has not been any further movement on the issue since then.\nAlso, some discussion-point notes can be found on here: http://pad.ubuntu.com/uos-1411-systemd-transition  (but you'll need a Launchpad account that has access to the etherpad to view this).\n\nPlease note: Your question is designed to inspire a discussion, rather than a clear answer.

I did an upgrade to 14.10 and the screen brightness controls stopped working correctly. I did a wipe and fresh install and I still have the same problem.\nThe symptom is that the brightness is now set automatically, regardless of setting it using the controls. In a bright room, it tries to turn up the brightness automatically, although it's very hit-and-miss. Conversely, in a darker place, it tries to turn the brightness down.\nThe brightness control has no effect until it's turned down to zero, when the display switches off entirely (and, fortunately, comes back on again when you reverse the process).\nHow do I switch back from automatic to manual brightness control?\n\nA: You can also use command line option to control brightness.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal using ctrl+alt+t.\n\n*Type command \"xrandr\".\n\n*It will display something like this:\n\n\n\n4.You need to see (in the underlined part) which display is connected. (Here in my case it is LVDS1).\n\n\n*Use following command to adjust brightness:\n\n\n\nxrandr --output \"your connected display name\" --brightness\n  \"brightness value\"\n\nFor example, in my case it'd be:\n\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness .75\n\n\n\nNote: Brightness value should be less than 1. (Otherwise it will be too much brightness).\nThat's it. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: How can I transfer Thunderbird profile from Windows XP? I've saved the profile on a flash drive by using the Import/Export feature of the Windows Thunderbird. However, the Thunderbird in Ubuntu seems to be a reduced version of the Windows one. \nIn the Import wizard under the prompt: \"please select the type of file to import\" it is not possible to enter anything, so I cannot direct the wizard to the saved profile (exported from the laptop). \nAlso, I don't want to do a profile replacement, as I've got some emails in the Thunderbird on Ubuntu and wouldn't like them to be overwritten. Please note the desktop Thunderbird is set to IMAP, whereas the laptop Thunderbird contains old emails and is not connected to the server.\n\nA: You can simply copy your windows thunderbird profile inside your ~/.mozilla/thunderbird (or may be it is ~/.config/thunderbird) directory. You may either rename it as default, or select it from the commandline thunderbird -P.\nNote: Some paths might be screwed up because of path differences in windows and linux. You can either fix them in the files manually, or reset them from the UI. I have not used thunderbird since long to help you more.

The only problem is that not all necessary files are installed by default.\nThere are just few steps to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Grilo DLNA client in Rhythmbox. Go to Tools -> Plugins and make sure that \"Grilo Media Browsing\" (or similar) is enabled.\n\n*Install Grilo plugins. Open \"Ubuntu Software Center\", search for \"grilo-plugins\" and install package \"grilo-plugins-0.2\".\n\n*You are done now. Open Rhythmbox and should already see your DLNA server in the left column. You can browse it and play your music. If you do not see it, try clicking little \"+\" sign on the bottom left and then \"Find new devices\" (or similar). See picture below.\n\n\nA: Here is how I configured Rhythmbox to work as a DNLA client in Ubuntu 20.04.\n\n*\n\n*Open Rhythmbox\n\n*Open the \"hamburger\" menu, the three stacked lines segments in the top bar on the Rhythmbox window\n\n*Select \"Preferences\" from the dropdown menu\n\n*In the popup window select the \"Grilo media browser\" option and click the \"Close\" button.\n\n*At this point, the name of my DLNA server appeared in the leftmost panel under the heading shared, and I was able to browse and play my files.\n\nI believe the package \"rhythmbox-plugins\" is required, and it was already installed.  I don't know if it was installed by default, or if I installed it sometime in the past.\nBy the way, the answer for Ubuntu 14.04 instructs you to go to the Tools->Plugins menu option, but in Ubuntu 20.04 there doesn't appear to a 'Plugins' option under 'Tools'.\n", "Q: How to fix seemingly autogenerated duplicates in sources.list in 14.04 LTS?

OFcourse, this is just what I think.\nI'd really like like some of which commands I can/should run to fix this. I am running ubuntu 14.10.\nThanks\n\nA: Try to go back to the original version of your driver by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*When your computer boots press F8 or F10 depending your boot options so you can display Ubuntu's advanced boot options.\n\n*Choose the recovery option for your latest kernel version\n\n*Choose failsafeX in the list and confirm Yes\n\n*Now in the same menu choose the resume option\n\n\nUbuntu will start ONCE in this mode with Kernel graphic drivers (aka Gallium). When you login go to Additional drivers, uninstall your current driver and re-enable it again.\nRestart your computer once done, this should solve your boot issue.\n\nA: I almost solved every boot issue i had with following uninstallation and reinstallation on AMD website:\n1- Uninstall The Driver\nsudo aticonfig --uninstall\n\nif this makes errors use this:\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/amd-uninstall.sh\n\nif you also got an error from this then try to force\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/amd-uninstall.sh --force\n\n2- Reinstalling X.org driver\nIn order to restore the system to the previous state before the last installation, the original configuration file needs to be restored manually. Without that, Xorg may fail to start properly after uninstalling the driver and rebooting the system.\nTo restore the original Xorg configuration file:\nLocate backup configuration files: \nls /etc/X11/xorg.conf.original-* \n\nTake the latest version with the highest number and copy it over the existing xorg.conf file: \ncp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.original-<number> /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nAfter that, it should be safe to reboot the system and start up using the open-source driver that ships with the OS.\nReboot your system.\nsudo reboot\n\n3- You should get a usable GUI.\nIf you reached this point then you have 2 choices.a- install proprietary from amd website b- install proprietary from additional drivers.\nVisit this for more info.\n\nA: After you are in the command line interface (i.e. following the steps as stated by addictcook below choosing failsafeX login option) you can just directly run \nsudo aticonfig --uninstall\n\nHowever, the above command will fail to uninstall the AMD driver if you have installed it  with the .deb packages, which was the case for me. So I had to run\nsudo dpkg -r fglrx-dev fglrx-amdcccle fglrx \n(that command line interface indeed will advice on the above command)\nand then reboot the machine with sudo reboot\n", "Q: How can I determine which fonts are installed from the command line, and what is the easiest way to install more?

I want to wipe all data off of all partitions of my HDD, and send it back as a single blank NTFS partition.\nI know Google returns many ways to format the hard drive, but I'm not sure which way is best for my scenario.

If you do a ls -l on /etc you should see something like:\nUMS.sh < /root/.config/UMS.conf\n\nbut the script never actually creates that file, probably doesn't have the permissions too.

The first couple of days it really did wonders, basically cutting the boot-time from 50sec to 25sec. \nThen all of a sudden, for no (obvious) reasons it took 20sec longer again. The change actually happened from a boot at ~1am compared to a boot the next morning ~9am. Ever since, it's been stuck at the 45sec mark.\nI tried to look at my boot-charts and you can actually see that before e4rat-preload started at ~5secs in the boot-process and now it starts at ~25secs. The strange thing is: from 5 until 25secs there is nothing at all happening, at least according to the bootchart.\nIn the boot process e4rat-preload is taking incredibly much time now at the point where it says loading I-Nodes. That part was a lot faster before.\nIf anyone has any idea on how to fix this, I'd be more than happy. \nThanks in advance for your effort.!\nHere are the before/after bootcharts. I cut them a little, to show the important part in the beginning. Apart from that, they look very much similar. If it helps I can of course add the whole charts.

(click here for more info on rc.local)\nI don't really understand why, but it is apparently interfering strongly with e4rat-preload.\nTaking away this statement I end up at ~25sec boot time again.\nHope this will be of help for similar problems.\n", "Q: Wi-fi doesn't work without reinstalling after every restart - please help me - 14.04 Wi-fi doesn't work without reinstalling after every restart - please help me\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and bcmwl driver on Dell Inspiron 15 3521\n02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 802.11b/g/n [14e4:4365] (rev 01)\nthe blacklist.conf contains \n    # This file lists those modules which we don't want to be loaded by\n# alias expansion, usually so some other driver will be loaded for the\n# device instead.\n\n# evbug is a debug tool that should be loaded explicitly\nblacklist evbug\n\n# these drivers are very simple, the HID drivers are usually preferred\nblacklist usbmouse\nblacklist usbkbd\n\n# replaced by e100\nblacklist eepro100\n\n# replaced by tulip\nblacklist de4x5\n\n# causes no end of confusion by creating unexpected network interfaces\nblacklist eth1394\n\n# snd_intel8x0m can interfere with snd_intel8x0, doesn't seem to support much\n# hardware on its own (Ubuntu bug #2011, #6810)\nblacklist snd_intel8x0m\n\n# Conflicts with dvb driver (which is better for handling this device)\nblacklist snd_aw2\n\n# causes failure to suspend on HP compaq nc6000 (Ubuntu: #10306)\nblacklist i2c_i801\n\n# replaced by p54pci\nblacklist prism54\n\n# replaced by b43 and ssb.\nblacklist bcm43xx\n\n# most apps now use garmin usb driver directly (Ubuntu: #114565)\nblacklist garmin_gps\n\n# replaced by asus-laptop (Ubuntu: #184721)\nblacklist asus_acpi\n\n# low-quality, just noise when being used for sound playback, causes\n# hangs at desktop session start (Ubuntu: #246969)\nblacklist snd_pcsp\n\n# ugly and loud noise, getting on everyone's nerves; this should be done by a\n# nice pulseaudio bing (Ubuntu: #77010)\nblacklist pcspkr\n\n# EDAC driver for amd76x clashes with the agp driver preventing the aperture\n# from being initialised (Ubuntu: #297750).

For your system you should be able to run ubuntu quite smoothly. It won't make running a large website on it possible, but you won't get lag or anything. Also, if you choose to use ntfs you should be able to simply not format the drive and keep your files, but you can also just install ubuntu to a different partition and keep the ntfs partition from windows as storage until you transfer everything over to the linux partition.

I am trying to modify a software called Cura specifically the CuraEngine. It was developed under linux and has dependencies that I could not fulfil on windows (from what I understand). So I am specifically installing a linux based system. I then need to install CUDA; I have a Nvidia 750Ti installed in the machine. I plan to write some kernels to accelerate the 3DModel -> G-code generation process for the project. \nI have tried quite a few times now to get this working but the process always breaks down after I install the nvidia drivers. I have been using the method described here to install along with trying from the CUDA toolkit download. For the second method I have had to shutdown lightdm and run the .run from the command line to get the drivers installed. All attempts have been from fresh installs of Ubuntu also. \nEach attempt results in the driver being installed (from what I can tell, no errors upon install), but upon restarting the computer and a login the background of the desktop and the mouse appear but nothing else, I can Ctrl+Alt+F1 to a terminal. Worth noting right now maybe, that before the drivers are installed the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F1 displays a black screen but after the install and a reboot it works though I can't login properly. So I assume the driver has been installed and is running but I am not sure how to check properly. I ran the command in step 5 of the install guide I'm using but my machine did not display the desired result of \"Kernel driver in use: Nvidia\".\nTo try and fix this issue I tried to use sudo apt-get purge nvidia-current and rebooted but still couldn't login. I also tried unity --replace and received errors pertaining to an \"OpenGL module\". \nI currently am now at the point of an install seen below, also under \"System -> Software & Updates -> Addditional Drivers\" it shows no additional drivers. \n\nNow this is the point at the install that I would restart and try to log back in and see if NSight Eclipse would recognize my GPU as a CUDA enabled device.

(Please correct me if I'm wrong)\nXorg/edgers is the bleeding edge for NVidia, so you are installing drivers that are in beta (or worse) and you might run into problems using them. On the other hand, they give you the flexibility you apparently need. This is advanced stuff and frankly, you're a computer wiz under Windows but you should not forget you're a newbie under Linux! (You are now where I was about 9 months ago.)\nSo take a less \"let's first install all this stuff and see what happens\" and more a \"let's install one single thing and see if that works\" approach:\nFirst of all, install plain vanilla Ubuntu.  That works? Clonezilla Disk to Image file your Ubuntu partition so you can roll back.\nNow install xorg nvidia latest drivers and play a few games, open a few spreadsheets and see whether it works.  If it does not, use xorg/edgers to install a previous driver and keep going back until it works. \nCloneZilla again to an additional image. (keep the previous CloneZilla Image)\nkeep doing this until you have everything installed and working.  If you break something really serious, you can easily restore to a previous version using the Clonezilla live CD.\nYou're on the bleeding edge Very few people will be able to help you with specific questions.\nTip: read all of the Ubuntu user manual.\n", "Q: Move a persistent USB Ubuntu to a smaller USB drive I plan to move my persistent USB Ubuntu which is currently on a 32GB USB drive (limited to only 4GB by default) to a new 4GB USB drive.

They also mentioned that \"the destination partition must be equal or larger than the source one.\"\nWould the copying work in my case then?\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThanks!!\n\nA: Just copy the casper-rw file from one USB drive to the other.\ncasper-rw is the name of the file where the Live USD stores persistent information.\nSince the size of thencasper-rw file itself is 4GB, and Ubuntu will require an additional GB or so, you'll need a larger USB drive, say 8GB.\n", "Q: How to automatically restart an application for using too much RAM or CPU I'm going to be running an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server that will have a few Garry's Mod (Half-life 2/Source based) servers running on it.

Before this, I had dual-boot Windows 7 and Fedora 18, and I tried to uninstall the Fedora, but I did something wrong, so I have to install Ubuntu (because I have its boot CD). I chose to install Ubuntu, and then \"Erase disk and Install Ubuntu\". Now I cannot open Windows 7 again, as it immediately runs Ubuntu when I turn on the computer.\nWhat I want to do now is to check whether there are some files left from Windows 7. Of course, those files aren't important. I just want to make sure that there aren't. How can I do this?\nSorry for my English\nThanks\n\nA: Since you selected the option Erase Disk and Install Ubuntu, the hard drive was formatted as an ext4 partition and hence no Windows related files are on it.\nHowever, data can still be recovered using tools such as photorec and hence if you want to completely get rid of your previous data, it is recommended to zero the hard drive, ie overwriting with zeros.\n\nA: \n\"Erase disk and Install Ubuntu\". \n\nThis means \"remove any and all other operating systems and install Ubuntu\".\n\nNow I cannot open Windows 7 again, as it immediately runs Ubuntu when I turn on the computer. \n\nThat is because you removed Windows 7 (and Fedora). When there is just one operating system on a computer it will automatically boot that operating system. When there are 2 or more you get to choose when booting.\n\nOf course, those files aren't important. I just want to make sure that there aren't. How can I do this? \n\nIf you want to check the lay-out of your disk you can install \"gParted\" and see if there are any partitions labelled as \"ntfs\". Those are Windows partitions. But I doubt if there will be any.\nBut in general: foreign partitions will be automatically shown in the launcher after the initial install (the icon is a grey harddisk icon). If those are not there you can also assume there are none on your disk.\n\nA: If you've only erased the Fedora partition and left the Windows partition intact, you might want to press \"shift\" while booting to show you the boot menu and then choose windows (again: if its partition is intact)\n\nA: If you chose to \"Erase disk and Install Ubuntu\" during your ubuntu installation there can not possibly be any windows files left .\nBecause in the \"Erase disk and Install Ubuntu\" step the installer formats your hard drive while converting it from NTFS(default windows file system) to ext4(ubuntu 14.04's default file system).\nUnless you lost some important data and are looking for ways to recover it.\nYou really shouldn't be worried! \n", "Q: Allow root access without passwd Have a VirtualBox Ubuntu guest (14.04) used for the sake of testing only.\nThe root user has its own password, so I can login as root in a separate terminal (su -), or directly from a login session (eg after Ctrl-Alt-F4).\n$ su -\nPassword: <current root password>\n# echo Works!\n\nSince it is a VB testing system, and the root user does not need any security, I want to be able to su - or login as root quickly, i.e. without root having a password.\nSo, tried as root\n# passwd -d root\n\nto remove the root password - it seems to work according to /etc/shadow (::)\nroot::16304:0:99999:7:::\n\nbut when trying to su -, it asks for a password, I just press enter (no password)\n$ su -\nPassword: \nsu: Authentication failure\n\nbut it doesn't su. \nThere has to be a setting somewhere to allow root to login/su without password.\nWhere would that be?\n\nA: try \nsudo -s\n\nIt will ask your password to login in as root.\nthen use passwd to change the root password.\nif you are not in sudo user \ntype \nsudo visudo\n\nadd this line in the last\n<username> ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nthen ctrl+x to exit then ,y to save the changes\nthen try again sudo -s it will login  to root without asking password\n\nA: Warning; not tested because I think it's not such a great idea, even for a VM (bad habits are difficult to remove...). \nI think this is a PAM thing (PAM=pluggable authentication modules). \nIn /etc/pam.d there are all the PAM configuration files that tell the system how to do the authentication of users. Now, the module that check for the passwords \"unix style\" is pam_unix.so, in which man page you can find among the options:\n\n  nullok\n       The default action of this module is to not permit the user access\n       to a service if their official password is blank. The nullok\n       argument overrides this default and allows any user with a blank\n       password to access the service.\n\n   nullok_secure\n       The default action of this module is to not permit the user access\n       to a service if their official password is blank. The nullok_secure\n       argument overrides this default and allows any user with a blank\n       password to access the service as long as the value of PAM_TTY is\n       set to one of the values found in /etc/securetty.\n\n\nSo I suspect is a matter of finding all the occurences of pam_unix.so in the files above, and add the option nullok (or change the nullok_secure to nullok) to the entries.  \nAccording to this post the file should be /etc/pam.d/common-auth --- but I am not sure about this because in Ubuntu the VC are in the /etc/securetty list so the null password for root should work from there (although not from a terminal emulator), and the SO states it doesn't work. \nSo a bit of experimentation will be needed ;-).\n", "Q: How to update 0ad?

Is there a way to make docky available only in one workspace and not in any other workspace in Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: A background script to make docky run on specific workspaces  (or not)\nBased on exactly the same mechanism as this answer, below a background script that starts/stops the Docky launcher, depending on the current workspace.\nThe mechanism itself is pretty much tested out. Having said that, in the linked question it is tested with setting different Unity Launchers and setting different wallpapers per workspace, not starting/stopping Docky. That should however make no difference whatsoever, and in the hours I tested it, it ran without a single error.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as docky_perworkspace.py\n\n*Test-run the script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Docky\n\n*Start the script with the command:\npython3 /path/to/docky_perworkspace.py\n\n\n*Now Docky runs on all workspaces. Navigate to the workspaces you don't want Docky to appear and run (while on the workspace):\npkill docky\n\nN.B. Use pkill docky, do not close docky from its own menu!\n\n*That's pretty much it. If you want to change the setting simply either start or kill docky on the workspace you'd like it to run or not; the script will remember your preference.\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your startup applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15&&python3 /path/to/docky_perworkspace.py\"\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess    \nimport os\nimport time\n\ndatadir = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.config/docky_run\"\nif not os.path.exists(datadir):\n    os.makedirs(datadir)\nworkspace_data = datadir+\"/docky_set_\"\n\ndef get_runs():\n    try:\n        subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"docky\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n        return True\n    except:\n        return False\n\ndef get_res():\n    # get resolution\n    xr = subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    pos = xr.index(\"current\")\n    return [int(xr[pos+1]), int(xr[pos+3].replace(\",\", \"\") )]\n\ndef current():\n    # get the current viewport\n    res = get_res()\n    vp_data = subprocess.check_output(\n        [\"wmctrl\", \"-d\"]\n        ).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    dt = [int(n) for n in vp_data[3].split(\"x\")]\n    cols = int(dt[0]/res[0])\n    curr_vpdata = [int(n) for n in vp_data[5].split(\",\")]\n    curr_col = int(curr_vpdata[0]/res[0])+1\n    curr_row = int(curr_vpdata[1]/res[1])\n    return str(curr_col+curr_row*cols)\n\ncurr_ws1 = current()\nruns1 = get_runs()\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    runs2 = get_runs()\n    curr_ws2 = current()\n    datafile = workspace_data+curr_ws2\n    if curr_ws2 == curr_ws1:\n        if runs2 != runs1:\n            open(datafile, \"wt\").write(str(runs2))\n    else:\n        if not os.path.exists(datafile):\n            open(datafile, \"wt\").write(str(runs2))\n        else:\n            curr_set = eval(open(datafile).read())\n            if all([curr_set == True, runs2 == False]):\n                subprocess.Popen([\"docky\"])\n            elif all([curr_set == False, runs2 == True]):\n                subprocess.Popen([\"pkill\", \"docky\"])           \n    curr_ws1 = curr_ws2\n    runs1 = get_runs()\n\nExplanation\nThe script keeps track of the current workspace (no matter how many workspaces you have). Per workspace, a file is created in /.config/docky_run, in which is \"written\" if docky should be present or not on the referring workspace (True or False)\nIf you stay on the same workspace, but docky is either started or killed (its pid appears or ends), the script \"understands\" it is you who made the change on the referring workspace, and the file is updated.\nIf the workspace changes however, the script sees if the file exists, reads it and either starts or kills docky (or does nothing if not necessary), according to the content of the file and the current situation. If the file does not exist yet (because you are using the workspace for the first time since you started the script for the first time), the file is created and set to the current (last) situation.\nBecause settings per workspace are remembered in files, they will be remembered even after a restart.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to mixed b/g/n wifi network on Ubuntu I cannot connect to mixed b/g/n wifi Network.

Everything works fine.\nHowever, once I close thunderbird and come back to it later, everything disappears, and TB asks me if I'd like to create a new email (it seems to be starting tb as root, as the suggested email is root, not nls). \nThe profile.ini within the .thunderbird folder of my home drive points to my mail folder on the separate partition.\nAs you can see here:\n    [General]\n    StartWithLastProfile=1\n\n    [Profile0]\n    Name=default\n    IsRelative=1\n    Path=hn3xusic.default\n\n    [Profile1]\n    Name=Default User\n    IsRelative=0\n    Path=/media/dataHive/Mail/hn3xusic.default\n    Default=1\n\nNow what confuses me the most is, that even if I remove TB using software center, and delete the .thunderbird folder in /home, and reinstall it, the error keeps happening - without it working at all (first startup doesnt show my emails/rules/folders anymore).\nIs this some kind of problem with permissions or access of files?\nMy fstab looks as follows:\n    # <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n    # / was on /dev/sda1 during installation\n    UUID=d20689ef-0113-454a-a015-5a7fc370d9fd /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n    #[...]\n    # /media/dataHive was on /dev/sda7 during installation\n    UUID=345cb53c-78f1-46e0-a312-360d89797a0f /media/dataHive ext4    defaults        0       2\n\nIf you need anything else to identify the issue, I'll gladly comply.\nUpdate\nI have reinstalled ubuntu to trace back my steps as to how this happens.\nThis time I did not format my data partition, leaving as it is, since I believe the problem being related to file access permissions.\nHere's what I did:\n1. Install ubuntu 14.04 LTS from usb (formated / partition, left all others as were)\n2. Updated ubuntu via software updater\n3. Made sure I own the /media/dataHive partition using the command\n        sudo chown -R nls:nls /media/dataHive\n4. Started thunderbird, clicked \"I will configure my Account later.\", closed TB again\n5. started thunderbird with 'thunderbird -p' and created a new profile, pointing to\n        /media/dataHive/mail/xxxx.default*\n*note that xxxx was the same number as the folder name that was created in   /home/.thunderbird after I started TB in step 4.\n6. Saw that nothing was imported / loaded.  \nEven when I modify my profile.ini to show only one path it doesn't load anything:\n        [General]\n        StartWithLastProfile=1\n    [Profile0]\n    Name=default\n    IsRelative=0\n    Path=/media/dataHive/Mail/5i1ehrtc.default\n    Default=1\n\nUpdate 2\nI created a new partition and mounted it under /mnt/mail.\nI chown'ed it from root to me, and additionally made sure I have access & execution permissions by using the chmod cmd (chmod ug+rwx /dir).\nStill not working. :(\n\nA: Alright, I apparently 'fixed' my issue, and it is apparently (?) a problem with compatibility between Ubuntu versions.\nOR\nAn issue with logical partitions.\nI have repeated my steps as described above again, this time I used ubuntu 14.10 instead though (as I remember having that version installed before 14.04LTS):  \n\n\n*\n\n*completely formatted the drive using gparted\n(this time, I put the mail partition in a primary partition, instead of a logical one.)  \n\n*Installed Ubuntu 14.10  \n\n*Chown'ed the partitions to belong to me instead of root.  \n\n*Started TB, quit it, renamed the folder on my mail partition to be the same as the one in my Home folder (just as described in the tutorial on how to move your TB profile)  \n\n*Started TB with the profile manager enabled and created a new profile pointing to my mail partition's email folder  \n\n\nUnfortunately I didn't realize that I may have altered two variables, instead of one, so the answer to this question may be one of the two: \n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbird Profiles cannot be moved from a newer Ubuntu Version to an older one (or in the very least not from 14.10 to 14.04 LTS)  \n\n*Thunderbird doesn't like its mail profiles on logical partitions.\n\n\nEither of them seem unlikely to me, however I am a novice in all matters Linux/ubuntu, so an answer from an experienced user may give more insight.\nEitherway, my profile now starts regularly and completely everytime now, after making the above changes.\n", "Q: Install ubuntu in LenovoG500s I have a laptop branded lenovo G500s with windows 8 pre installed.I need to install Ubuntu as a secondary operating system in my laptop without removing my current Operating System.\nIs it possible?\nI have run  the installation CD and which says no operating system found in my system.The ubuntu not detecting my current operating system.\nIf i proceed with the next steps,anything happen to my current OS?\n\nA: if you are afraid to break anything and just want to try it do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*-mount ubuntu image on windows with daemon tools\n\n*-from there run wubi.exe it will make you a ubuntu installation on your disk.\n\n\nreboot and voila you have side by side.\n", "Q: Nautilus window background goes black when using custom themes I am facing a problem when using custom themes in ubuntu 14.04 unity interface, such as the mbuntu-y theme appearing in the screenshot attached, as you can see the background of nautilus window goes black sometimes when using custom themes, this does not happen when I use Ambiance or Radiance themes..

Install csvkit:\nsudo pip install csvkit\nsudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-setuptools build-essential\n\nStep 2. Use the join command with a comma as separator\njoin -t,\n\nStep 3. Feed it the actual columns you want to. Note how you feed it the first column twice, because that is the one the join is actually performed on (default behavior of join).\njoin -t, <(csvcut --columns 1,3,4 file1.csv) <(csvcut --columns 1,2 file2.csv)\n\nor in shorthand:\njoin -t, <(csvcut -c 1,3,4 file1.csv) <(csvcut -c 1,2 file2.csv)\n\nYou can redirect that standard output to a file (desiredOutput) if wanted.\nAdvantages\nThis method has several advantages over the others proposed.\nFirst and foremost: it performs a real join. That means that it can be used for more complex data as well. It is very easy to do a join on another field, for instance. It does not simply look at the position of the field, but it really takes the column into consideration. It actually works with the format of the data (csv) and does not treat it like text.\nSecond, it uses the very powerful csv toolkit which also allows you to a) display statistics with one command (csvstats), b) check whether the data is clean (csvclean), but also to transform it into json, into sql, or even load it into python! This toolkit is heavily used in data science for data preparation.\n\nA: Here is another beautiful one.

If you want to swap two columns, you can do so by using the same file as input.csv and update.vsc.\ncsvtool pastecol 2 1 file2.csv file2.csv \nA,A\nA,A\nA,A \nA,A\n\n\nA: To move a chosen number of columns from one file to another:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\ncols = 1; file_1 = \"/path/to/file_1\"; file_2 = \"/path/to/file_2\"\n\ndef readfile(file):\n      with open(file) as src:\n          return [item.strip().split(\",\") for item in src.readlines()]\n\nfile_1 = readfile(file_1); file_2 = readfile(file_2)\n\nfor i in range(len(file_1)):\n    print((\",\").join(file_1[i]+file_2[i][-cols:]))\n\nfrom two files:\nfile_1\nA,B\nA,B\nA,B\nA,B\n\nfile_2\nK,L,M\nK,L,M\nK,L,M\nK,L,M\n\nWhen you set cols = 1:\nA,B,M\nA,B,M\nA,B,M\nA,B,M\n\nBut When you set cols = 2:\nA,B,L,M\nA,B,L,M\nA,B,L,M\nA,B,L,M\n\ncols = 3:\nA,B,K,L,M\nA,B,K,L,M\nA,B,K,L,M\nA,B,K,L,M\n\nHow to use\nCopy it into an empty file, set the path to file1, file2 and the number of columns to move, save it as move.py and run it by:\npython3 /path/to/move.py\n\nIt is also possible to add one or more columns from the middle of the source file's colums this way.\n\nA: With only awk command:\nawk -F, '{getline f1 <\"file2\" ;print f1,$3,$4}' OFS=, file1\n\nGet a line from file1 and store it into local variable f1, then print the line that stored in f1 and finally print the third($3) and forth($3) fields from file1 which delimited with comma , altogether, and change the OFS(output field separator [space by default]) to comma(,).\n\nThe short command would be like this:\npaste -d, file2 <(cut -d, -f3- file1)\n\n\n A,B,C,D  \n A,B,C,D  \n A,B,C,D  \n A,B,C,D  \n\npaste the file2, then cut and paste the third column to the next(-f3-) from file1.\n\nWith awk and paste (option A)\nBelow command also copies the last two columns (C,D) from file1 at the end of each line in file2:\npaste -d',' file2  <(awk -F',' '{print $(NF-1)\",\"$NF}' file1)\n\nAbove command paste the file2 content then print a comma delimiter(-d',') then paste the two last field(NF is the index of last field and $NF is the string which its index is NF. So $(NF-1) is the second field before last field ) from file1 when those index redefines or splits with comma spectator(-F',').\nWith awk and paste (option B)\nThis command also is the same as above($3 and $4 points to third and forth field of each line from file1 ):\npaste -d',' file2  <(awk -F',' '{print $3\",\"$4}' file1)\n\nOr another solution with cut command:\npaste -d, <(cut -d, -f1 file1) <(cut -d, -f2 file2) <(cut -d, -f3- file1)\n\ncut command in above command first cut the first field(-f1 which indexed with comma delimiter(-d.)) from file1(cut -d, -f1 file1), then cut and paste the second field of file2(cut -d, -f2 file2) and finally cut and paste the third column(-f3) to the nexts(-) from file1(cut -d, -f3- file1) again.\nThis command also returns the same result:\npaste -d, <(awk -F',' '{print $1}' file1) <(awk -F',' '{print $2}' file2) <(awk -F',' '{print $3\",\"$4}' file1)\n\npaste the second field from file1(awk -F',' '{print $1}' file1) then print a comma(-d,), then paste the second column from file2(awk -F',' '{print $2}' file2), finally paste the second and last column of file1(awk -F',' '{print $3\",\"$4}' file1) again.\n\nA: Another method in python through csv module.\nscript.py\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nimport csv\nimport sys\nfile1 = sys.argv[1]\nfile2 = sys.argv[2]\nwith open(file2, 'r') as r:\n    with open(file1, 'r') as f:\n        csv_f = csv.reader(f)\n        csv_r = csv.reader(r)\n        bar = [linex for linex in csv_r]\n        foo = [liney[2:] for liney in csv_f]\n        zipped = zip(bar,foo)\n        result = [x+y for (x,y) in list(zipped)]\n        for i in result:\n            print(','.join(i))\n\nTo run the above script,\npython3 script.py file1 file2\n\nOutput:\nA,B,C,D\nA,B,C,D\nA,B,C,D\nA,B,C,D\n\n", "Q: Problem with wireless connection in 14.04 lts My problem: I can see and connect to the network, most of the time (sometimes connecting does not work).

If irrelevant please redirect.\nI'm wondering why all the Ubuntu boxes on VagrantCloud are targeted at virtualbox.\nI need one tailored for the vagrant vmware provider.\nThe problem is that the vagrant boxes available from Ubuntu on VagrantCloud are specifically targeted at virtualbox, and as such can't be used with the vmware provider. What I'm trying to find out is who's maintaining those vagrant boxes, as they seem to be officialy released by Ubuntu: https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu\nFor example, look at this vagrant box. It is specifically advertised as an \"official\" Ubuntu cloud image, so I'd like to find out who maintains those images: https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64\nWho's responsible for those boxes ? Who should be contacted for this ?\n\nA: Most of the vagrant boxes are build for virtualBox, because by default, vagrant is configured to use virtualBox as its provider. Moreover virtualBox is free of charge where that isn't the case with other providers. I can't find any good reason on why we should use other providers. I use vagrant for most of my projects both on LAMP and MEAN and using virtualBox without any problems. \nNow you want to use vmware, you have to install plugins. You can always build a box from scratch if you don't get one from cloud. But of course, that is a time consuming process. I've published a guide on 'how to setup a ubuntu development environment using vagrant' and in that I have mentioned how to wrap an existing vagrant environment in to a new box. Again, I'm not sure if repackaging is possible for another provider. Please check it out and let us know about it.  \n\nA: To answer your question it is probably the Ubuntu Cloud Images team that creates these boxes automatically using a tool like Packer (at packer.io) or a custom workflow that generates a compatible Vagrant box. As stated by Jasnan these are easiest and cheapest to do via Virtualbox because there is ZERO licensing costs and users who are cheap are far more likely to use Virtualbox than VMware which runs around $200, and the Vagrant plugin that is required to use it with VMware is another $79, so a user who is $280 in is probably likely to have their own preferences on which box to use and they are probably happy with one of the many other Ubuntu based images available.\nHere is the root of the Ubuntu cloud images repository for Docker/Vagrant and other platforms.\nhttps://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/\nIf you would like to build your own there are any examples available for Packer like the following Github repository.\nhttps://github.com/boxcutter/ubuntu\n", "Q: Volume of Laptop speaker very low I am using HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook.

When I logged in, there were no Wi-Fi connections at all.\nI've tried everything and I can't seem to find a solution.\n\nA: I have a Dell Inspiron 17, and I had the same problem. It is due to the fact that the machine uses a wifi card that requires a proprietary driver. It is easy to fix. First, you will need to connect your machine to your internet router by a cable. Then in a terminal window, enter the command\nsudo software-properties-gtk\n\nIn the window that appears, select the \"Additional Drivers\" tab. The screen shows \"Searching for available drivers ...\". After a minute or so, you should see your wifi card listed, with two options, like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Broadcom 802.11 Linux STA wireless driver source from\nbcmwl-kernel-source (propprietary)\n\n*Do not use the device\n\n\nChoose the first option, and click Apply Changes.\nYou will then just need to press F2 to enable (unlock) the wifi card, and then it should all work. When you click on the wifi icon in the toolbar, you should see a list of available networks. Select yours, and enter its password when prompted. You can then disconnect your cable from the router.\n\nA: Please insert the command\nsudo lshw -c network\n\nIf your network device is the BCM43___ then follow the thread:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/460019/wifi-card-on-but-wont-connect-to-wifi-network-dell-inspiron-e1505-ethernet-w\nIt might contain something useful to you, I have the same problem but with the Bluetooth functionality of B43___ board.\n\nA: For the Dell Inspiron 17 1750 I also spent a few hours trying to get the Wi-Fi card to work. Initially I just tried the first n solutions I could find on various fora, however doing so, I had done some softwarematic damage I was not aware of. (I think I disabled the Wi-Fi driver in some way by adding it to a blacklist). That meant that the actual solution also didn't work anymore.\nAfter a few months I did a clean install of Ubuntu (20.04) and pursued the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*I enabled switching Wi-Fi on and off in the BIOS.\n\n*Installed Ubuntu without the third party software (it is a checkmark you should keep unchecked during the installation in this strategy).\n\n*Opened the Ubuntu Software Center and installed Synaptic Package Manager.\n\n*Opened Synaptic Package Manager and searched: b43\n\n*Next I selected the option firmware-b43-installer. This prompted me if I also wanted to install the b43-fwcutter which I did.\n\n*I reooted the laptop.\n\n*The Wi-Fi adapter was recognized, which was indicated by the airplane symbol.\n\n*After login, I pressed the Fn+F2switch to turn the Wi-Fi on and it worked.\n\nSo in essence, the most basic steps worked, but only after a clean install. (Note that the Synaptic Package Manger is not actually needed, you can also just install the firmware-b43-installer and b43-fwcutter from terminal, but given the amount of erroneous commands I had given, and the accompanying hassle that that brought, I picked the safer manual option).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 does not shut down on Acer Extensa 2509 notebook I am currently running into a problem with my new Acer Extensa 2509 notebook.

For cinder and nova-cloud-controller had to set notification_driver =  rabbit. Furthermore,  had to manually set password, in rabbitmq server, for nova, neutron, and cinder users. In all cases, had to restart relevant services, manually. (Note that in case of cinder and cloud-controller, juju overwrites notification_driver.) Unfortunately, still can't access Access&security page. Keystone is reporting the following:\n(keystone.common.wsgi): 2014-11-24 23:51:42,238 WARNING Authorization failed.

This is all done directly in RabbitMQ's underlying state database - so don't expect anything to appear in /etc/rabbitmq!\nFor some reason, it looks like this password does not correspond with the password in RabbitMQ - you're running in a clustered configuration so I wonder whether there is some issue with the clustering - try running:\nsudo rabbitmqctl cluster_status\n\non one of the RabbitMQ nodes to see if all units are listed; I suspect there may have been some issue with the RabbitMQ clustering set-up, and you might be running in some sort of split brain configuration, so the passwords remote services have only match in a subset of the RabbitMQ units.\nI also checked on the notification driver configuration for the cinder and nova-cc charms; although they are using the older deprecated name for the rpc driver, this gets remapped to the correct oslo.messaging (the shared OpenStack messaging library) driver. We'll update this during our next dev cycle to use the oslo.messaging one directly.\n", "Q: Root crontab not running For some reason, my root crontab does not seem to be running.\nTrying to reboot the device every night at midnight.\nShould be the following as root:\ncrontab -e\n\nThen add:\n0 0 * * * /sbin/shutdown -r now\n\nWhen I test using some values close current time, nothing happens. I installed NTP and made sure the time zone is correct. I am also specifying using the 24-hour clock. For example, to test this line right now (5:35 PM) I try entering the following:\n36 17 * * * /sbin/shutdown -r now\n\nI have checked the time with date -R. The time for the crontab to run comes and goes and the system does not reboot. What am I missing here?\n\nA: I have three solution suggestions for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Invoke the crontab with crontab -e -u root\n\n*Make sure that you have an empty line at the end of the cronjob file, meaning that every line ends with a newline.\n\n*You might need to redirect the output to devnull: shutdown -r now > /dev/null\nHere are two helpful webpages for cronjobs:\nCRON Tester\nCRON Generator\nYou can also handle the cronjobs neatly with webmin.\nOther than that, you have at least two more ways for restarting your computer at midnight.\nOne is to run the shutdown command as a script automatically at login but with specific time as a parameter instead of \"now\":\nshutdown -r 00:00\nHowever, this will yield a broadcast message of upcoming shutdown at every login (might not be a bad thing at all). Well you can also make this be run at boot time by adding the script in init.d, still yielding the message, though.\nAnother is to use atcommand:\nat 0am\nEnter command shutdown -r now and save it with ctrl+d or do a script for the command and do:\nat -f restart_script.sh 0am\nHope these help you to get the result you wanted.\n\nA: System Cron jobs are listed in /etc/crontab file. Therefore editing this file directly will help you out to run the reboot command as root.\ntherefore, \n$ sudo vi /etc/crontab\n\n# Example of job definition:\n# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)\n# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)\n# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)\n# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...\n# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat\n# |  |  |  |  |\n# *  *  *  *  * user-name  command to be executed\n  23 20 *  *  *  root  shutdown  -r  now\n\nmake sure you check the Cron log file after editing the crontab as it will let you know if the cron was installed successfully. \nI have tested it and it worked for me. Restarted my system at 8:23 PM\nGood LUCK!\n\nA: 36 17 * * * etc ..\n36 17 is not a way to specify the right time in your cron.\ncheck via date command to see if your system is working in US time or Europ time\nuse 17 36 if europ time and if your system use 24 H time\nor\n5 36 if your system use US TIME and 12 H time\n", "Q: How to add decorative borders in LibreOffice Writer?

What is the difference?  If I am setting up virtualenv for 3.4 do I need to point it to the 3.4 file, or does the python3 act like a meta package?\n\nA: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2  and /usr/bin/python3 are just symbolic links to a Python executable for convenient access to a Python 2/3 interpreter or just a python interpreter. In 14.04 they point to:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/bin/python → /usr/bin/python2.7\n\n*/usr/bin/python2 → /usr/bin/python2.7\n\n*/usr/bin/python3 → /usr/bin/python3.4\nIn combination with virtualenv you should use the executable directly: /usr/bin/python2.7 or /usr/bin/python3.4, but the symbolic links should work as well.\n", "Q: Neverwinter Nights hangs at startup in my Kubuntu 14.10 VMWare Guest All right, I'm setting up Neverwinter Nights yet again~ ..And I've hit a pretty heavy snag that I've never seen before, and I'm really not sure how to progress.\nI unzipped all the zips in order (and I do mean ALL the zips), added my license keys, ran ./fixinstall, and started the game...and was met with missing libraries (I think libGL.so.1 was first.) I installed them as they were reported, and was finally met with everyone's favorite error message \"SDL Parachute Deployed.\" To get around that, I installed some more libraries (SDL and sundry) and removed the ./libs folder from the library path NWN exports.\nNow, when I try to launch it, it just hangs. The nwmain process is still running, but it doesn't appear to be doing anything. I used strace to peer inside, and all threads appeared to be stuck on futex locks except for one that looked like it might be the game loop, but was only doing this over and over:\ngettimeofday({1416876489, 342686}, NULL) = 0\nnanosleep({0, 1000000}, 0xf0fff2c0)     = 0\ngettimeofday({1416876489, 344658}, NULL) = 0\nnanosleep({0, 1000000}, 0xf0fff2c0)     = 0\n\nNo errors are reported to the console and nothing is written to NWN's log files. ..And I'm at a loss as to how to troubleshoot further. Any advice/insight would be appreciated..\n\nA: I experienced the same symptoms: no output, no window, no logging, almost no CPU usage and a similar strace when running Neverwinter Nights. This was on Kubuntu 14.04 from a NWN installation that used to work fine with 13.10 and older versions.\nSomeone clever on the ArchLinux forums (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=155009) traced the problem back to libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0 using gdb debugging. This libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0 is an optional OpenGL extension for texture compression. Optional. :)\nI removed it with\napt-get remove libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0:i386\n\nand now NWN starts again and I can load a save game from the official campaign without any noticeable problems.\nHowever, some textures, e.g. from the community expansion project, are missing (white) in game. This is likely due to them being compressed with the s3tc algorithm (which is implemented by above library). The good news is that some (most?) graphic cards can deal with compressed textures directly. To force OpenGL to simply pass the compressed textures to the graphics card, set the environment variable\nforce_s3tc_enable=true\n\nbefore starting NWN. That fixed the white textures for me, but might not be a complete substitute for the library, as someone warns here: Is there an easy way to enable S3TC on Intel graphics?\nNote, this libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0:i386 library is also supposed to improve graphics performance, but NWN is so old, it should not matter. Since the above command only removes the 32-bit version of the library, 64bit games should not be affected at all.\n", "Q: Is there a google voice or other VoIP app for Ubuntu phone?

I have an Alienware Aurora-r4 with a liquid cooling system. Before installing Ubuntu my temperatures on Windows would always be around 25°C idle and 30°C when running several applications. Ever since I installed Ubuntu, sensors are showing the temperatures around 35°C to 45°C at idle.\nXsensors shows:  \n\nsensors shows:  \n\nI think it may have something to do with the liquid cooling system not pumping but both sensor readings does not even recognize I have liquid cooling. So how can I check and control the liquid cooling pump?\n\nA: I don't know how to control the liquid cooling, it might act like a cpu fan & allow bios or software speed up & slow down, but I thought most liquid coolers are more like an always-on full-speed thing, they're supposed to be quieter so what's the point in slowing them down ever. Does your BIOS show anything about the cpu pump or fan speed? The sensor pictures show 3 fans, are there 3 air fans in there somewhere, or is one definitely the CPU water pump? I'd look up more info about that particular liquid cooler & see if it can report and change it's pump speed like a fan, and some liquid coolers have an air fan on the radiator too so that might be it.\nI do know how to test a car's radiator to see if it's working, and a cpu liquid cooler is a little radiator... grab both hoses and see if one is cooler (the one from the rad to the cpu) and the other is hotter (from cpu to rad). If they are then it's probably working (at least a little). \nOr maybe ubuntu is just running the cpu hotter for other reasons, like the cpu frequency might not be slowing down, does cpufreq-info show the governor's ondemand or conservative with the frequency within some available steps? Just saw another Q where overheating occurred because the cpufreq governor was stuck on performance=fastest which tends to be hot. Or sometimes video drivers run the cpu &/or vid card hotter in ubuntu/linux, and may need updating or trying another driver?\n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.04 desktop will not load after automatic update Since the last automatic update my account is basically gone.\nWhen I log in all I see is the mouse and the default desktop image, but no panel, no icons, and not even the Terminal will work, it's as if the explorer.exe on windows never loaded (something that is in charge of loading the GUI).\nWhen I open the guest account and open firefox it works for a moment but then it freezes.\nAny ideas?

To avoid crashing the Xfce theme (and getting the ugly buttons, etc.), I always first disable the external monitor output in Settings > Display and only then I physically unplug the cable. But this ugly workaround may fail at times.\nIf you have already experienced the ugly themes, this means that your xfsettingsd has crashed. You can easily revert from the ugly theme to the usual desktop appearance settings simply by restarting the daemon in a terminal: \nxfsettingsd\n\nAnd if this happens often enough (as, for instance, with 4.11.3), then you may want to define a launcher on your panel that will (re-)start the daemon: \n\nFor more details check the upstream bug report.\n", "Q: Can I install a theme meant for Linux Mint[cinnamon] on Ubuntu? I am currently running Ubuntu 14.04 on my system. \nThe other day I found this cool theme meant for the cinnamon desktop and downloaded the zip file of that theme.

I'm very new to Ubuntu, and Linux in general. In Windows, system updates are generally installed while the computer is shutting down, and completed on the next startup, presumably so that it can access and change protected system files without the chance of user error.\nIs this necessary in Ubuntu, or Linux in general? While updates are installing, can I use my computer as I normally would, without having to worry about the update screwing up my system because I was doing something while it was trying to update itself?\nI'm running Xubuntu 10.14, but this more of a general question that I'm hoping you guys can answer for most current versions/flavors of Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can use your computer normally while updates are installing. This is because file system works different in Linux than in Windows. In Linux, once file is opened, it is kept in process' memory until process exits, no matter what happened to the opened file during existence of process. For example, you could delete some files process use or even delete the binary of the process itself, the process would continue to run normally. (All data are kept in memory.)\nBecause of this, no process can be disturbed during updates. But to use updated program you need to restart it (or reboot if kernel was updated).\nPS: I presented somewhat simplified view of how file system works, but it should be sufficient to answer your question.\n\nA: no need.\nIn Linux distros, there can be two type of updates:\n\n\n*\n\n*System updates: where the software components or libraries, linux kernel are updated\n\n*Software updates: this includes update of software like firefox browser, vlc etc.\nSo the point is when you have software updates you need not to worry about the update messing with your open software. If softare whose update you receive will be updated after closing it. \n\n\nAbout system updates, some times there may be updates those don't require restart, so these updates won't mess with your system(makers of distros, linux kernel makes sure that you dont have any problem). There may some updates which require restart, so even in this case you don't need to worry since update is applied only after restart.\nIt can be any type of update, you can apply updates even if you wish to operate your computer for some more time.\nthis is not much technical answer, but it explains pretty much you need to know as newbie (to a point you need not worry about applying updates anytime). \n", "Q: Starting Apache display errors Usually when i log in my system, apache automatically startup and works fine, today its not.\nThen i try to start by service apache2 start then it displays following error.\n* Starting web server apache2                                                     \nAH00548: NameVirtualHost has no effect and will be removed in the next release /etc/apache2/ports.conf:8\nAH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1.

The \"only detected an i686 cpu\" error may be from VirtualBox's way of emulating the \"trusted platform execution\"(TPE), or maybe VirtualBox starts to boot the image, but the cpu's TPE doesn't let it, and the kernel sees something wrong with the cpu that fits the \"not x86-64 cpu\" error?

I followed the steps listed here and here. The only thing that wasn't mentioned, was that if you decide to use this method, you still need to type in the user password for the machine on each login.

Instead of using the touchpad's button I want to use the 'Home' key. I am able to emulate the mouse-down part but I don't know how to release the click when the 'Home' key is released.\nHere is what I have so for. first I use the xbindkeys tool. I added this entry to the .xbindkeysrc:\n\"~/bin/mouse-click\"\n  m:0x0 + c:110\n\nmouse-click is this bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\nxdotool mousedown 1\n\nThe problem is the click is never being released so I need to find a way to detect the release of the 'Home'. Here is the script I am trying to write. The comments describe what I am trying to do:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# not sure how to do that:\nexit if Home key is in a pressed state (to avoid more mousedown actions)\n\nxdotool mousedown 1\n\n# not sure how to do that: (if Home key is released, release the mouse click)\nwhile xinput query-state <device name> | grep -Flq 'key[9]=up'\nxdotool mouseup 1\n\nSo That's what I am trying to figure out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Query the state of 'Home' key (pressed or not). \n\n*Listen to keyboard events and detect a release of 'Home' key.\n\n\nIf there are better approach to achieve that, I would love to hear about them.\nThanks!\nEdit: the solution is one line:  xmodmap -e \"keycode 115 = Pointer_Button2\"\nso now my Home key is doing left click and behave just as if I hit the mouse click and I can keep the key pressed and it highlights (copy) as expected.\nI also mapped my End key to be middle click, so I can use it to paste:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 110 = Pointer_Button1\"\n\nA: The solution is\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 115 = Pointer_Button2\"\n\nNow my Home key is doing left click and behaves just as if I hit the mouse click and I can keep the key pressed and it highlights (copies) as expected.\nI also mapped my End key to be middle click, so I can use it to paste: \nxmodmap -e \"keycode 110 = Pointer_Button1\"\n\nNote that it is necessary to have \"mousekeys\" (mouse emulation using the numeric keypad) enabled for this to work. \"mousekeys\" can be toggled by pressing Shift+NumLock or set explicitly by running:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/a11y/keyboard/mousekeys-enable true\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/a11y/keyboard/mousekeys-enable false\n\n\nA: Most desktops have some accessibility settings that will control the mouse with the keyboard already built-in, like XFCE has them in it's All Settings -> Accessibility -> Mouse -> Mouse Emulation, that uses the keyboard number pad so the 5 key does exactly what you're trying to do.\nIf I recall, gnome, cinnamon and mate have similar features under something like \"Accessibility\" or assistive technology, etc. Or an installable program/package like mousetweaks (\"mouse accessibility enhancements for the GNOME desktop\") or keynav (but I couldn't get it to work on xfce).\nOr, if your touchpad still works ok (just not the buttons) you could just do a tap for a single click, a tap & then hold for a click & drag, a double-tap = double click... and if they don't work there should be a line or two in the terminal that should get those to work (don't remember them offhand now). I wouldn't want to write my own script when there are a few other options that should work\n\nA: You should use for that an auto clicker program that emulate and automate your mouse clicks (left mouse button in your case).\nI recommend for you to use Max Auto Clicker that is available for Ubuntu Linux and other debian like distros.\nAvailable packages format: .deb, .AppImage, .zip\n", "Q: Install Firefox on lubuntu I have already download Firefox for Lubuntu a (Firefox.tar.bz2 file) and I have extracted the file after downloading.

The server version doesn't even come with X, let alone a desktop, so think about what you want.  grub probably got confused about the devices, and wrote the /etc/grub/grub.cfg file with wrong devices -- typically they are one device too high, e.g. sdb instead of sda, hd2 instead of hd1 etc.  but maybe hd0 is right for your case, and hd1 is being used.  You can edit the grub.cfg file from the live session, or if you get to a grub prompt, use the tab completion feature to track down what disk is used (the UUIDs where used are OK).  For example, at the grub prompt, type \nls (hd    then TAB to see what disks are available (assume hd0 and hd1). Choose 0 so you get ls (hd0)/ TAB   and use tab again to see what's on the root of the disk.  If you see ubuntu directories, hd0 is your device (or sda if that's used anywhere).  If you see Windows files, use the other disk.  Eventually you should be able to find the right path to the grub.cfg file, and pull it in with the \"configfile (hd0)/boot/grub/grub.cfg. \nNow you should have a grub menu, and instructions on screen to edit (type e, fix the disk references, then thpe ctrl-X or F10 to boot.

It's actually pretty weird and after searching I couldn't find anything about it. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Gzip has error-detecting code, like if there's an error (ex. one changed byte) gzip will complain & tell you about it.

The results weren't as I expected and I tried something else which eventually worked out for me. \nI executed this command in the path ~/bar\nln -s ~/foo/baz.txt .\n\nI wonder now why my first approach didn't work since I referenced my file to the directory where I want to have my symlink. It looks to me like I did the same thing in both commands just in different directories.\n\nA: The issue here is absolute versus relative paths. An absolute path is /bar/foo/file.txt and a relative path is ./file.txt. When you run ln -s foo.txt /home/ubuntu/central_addcontent/program/, that is equivalent to running\nln -s ./foo.txt /home/ubuntu/central_addcontent/program/\n\nThis will create a file called foo.txt that is pointing to ./foo.txt in the target directory. This is simpler to illustrate with an example giving a different link name:\n$ ln -s foo.txt /home/terdon/central_addcontent/program/bar.txt\n$ ls -l /home/terdon/central_addcontent/program/\ntotal 0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 terdon terdon 7 Nov 25 11:25 bar.txt -> foo.txt\n\nAs you can see above, bar.txt is pointing to /home/terdon/central_addcontent/program/foo.txt and that file does not exist. To do this correctly you can either use the full path of foo.txt or use the relative path but with respect to the target directory. Both of these will work:\n$ ln -s ~/central_app/program/foo.txt ~/central_addcontent/program/\n$ l /home/terdon/central_addcontent/program/\ntotal 0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 terdon terdon 40 Nov 25 11:28 foo.txt -> /home/terdon/central_app/program/foo.txt\n\nOr \n$ ln -s ../../central_app/program/foo.txt ~/central_addcontent/program/\n$ ls -l /home/terdon/central_addcontent/program/\ntotal 0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 terdon terdon 33 Nov 25 11:29 foo.txt -> ../../central_app/program/foo.txt\n\nIn the second example, I've used a relative path but with respect to the link's target.\n", "Q: Is any RDP client can be used in Ubuntu 14.04 that can access Windows Server 2012?

This was via the popup window that informed me 14.04 was available as opposed to via a do-release-upgrade on the commandline.

They should never send a 404, as they are the primary source for packages.\nTry switching your mirror, I believe that your selected one is out of date, got moved, or another problem. Switch your mirror back to the Main one in your software sources.\nIf that didn't work, make sure that you don't have any official sources being blocked in your sources list, possibly by having unchecked one or another may be blocking it.\nStill no luck? Try jumping on a known network, it could be that whatever your computer thinks ubuntu.com is is not actually what it should be.

If you use it as a startup application, you should uncomment the line:\ntime.sleep(10)\n\nIn the head section of the script. The script might crash if it is called before the desktop is fully loaded. Change the value (10), depending on your system.\nExplanation\nIn a loop the script:\n\n\n*\n\n*[checks the possible pids of the set applications]\n\n*checks the screen's resolution, to see where the windows are positiond (relative to the current workspace)\n\n*creates a list of current windows, their state\n\n*checks the current hide-mode (either 0 for not- autohide or 1 for autohide)\n\n\n(only) if a change in the hide-mode needs to be made, the script changes the setting.\n\nA: Here you go guys.

Make a backup first though if you do not know what this means. From a command line: \nsudo cp /etc/lsb-release /etc/lsb-release.backup\n\nAnd then edit the file ...\nsudo gedit /etc/lsb-release\n\nAnd change the lines as below:\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.10\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=utopic\n\nAnd save it. Start the installation and it should finish this time without a notice regarding the distribution.\nAfter that you can then put back the backup file with (cp to leave the backup, change it to mv to also remove the backup)...\nsudo cp /etc/lsb-release.backup /etc/lsb-release\n\n", "Q: Find server address on ubuntu How do I find the dns server of my router 192.168.1.1 in a file? \nI am using Ubuntu 14.04\n/etc/resolv.conf \nName server is 127.0.0.1\n\nA: On current desktop versions of Ubuntu (using NetworkManager), DNS resolution is provided via a local process called dnsmasq that listens on port 53 of localhost - that's why your DNS server appears to be 127.0.0.1 in this instance.\nIn turn, dnsmasq gets its information from the upstream server specified as part of the interface definition, either manually or as part of its DHCP provision. If you are using a DHCP-supplied upstream DNS then that will be visible as part of the DNS lease, so it should be visible in your DHCP client's lease file, for example /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases - although it would be more usual to access that information programatically either using nm-tool or nmcli e.g.\n$ nmcli -f IP4 dev list\nIP4.ADDRESS[1]:                         ip = 192.168.1.16/24, gw = 192.168.1.1\nIP4.DNS[1]:                             192.168.1.1\n\nIf you have specified an upstream DNS server manually (i.e. are using DHCP only for addressing information), then you would need to look in the connection definition file - for example in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<CON_NAME>\n\nA: You can find out which DNS servers your machine uses by running \nnm-tool\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Flex 2-15 I just got my new Lenovo Flex 2-15 with preinstalled Windows 8 using which I do not want to use. \nI would like to install Ubuntu on it but I never had experience with touch screens and I am wondering if it is a good idea at all and if it will have a proper touch screen support or if not, any other Linux distributions that might have it? Are there any other driver problems like WiFi, for example, that may arise? \n\nA: I have a Lenovo Flex 14 (series 1), I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS alongside Windows 8. For me, the touch screen works a treat, although I am old school and never have the need to touch it during normal use, I prefer to use the mouse and keyboard.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: When you asked this question, the answer would have been no. I was running only Ubuntu on this system with no issues. However I did have to reload Windows on here a couple of months ago and it upgraded to Windows 10.  After that, I was able to go back to Ubuntu with no need for Windows (happy dance).  \nNow, here is where the problems are starting to compound. The laptop would no longer just shutdown, it would power back on after 3 to 5 seconds. Also, wifi would stop functioning after roughly 15 to 20 minutes regardless of what the Ubuntu said. Restarting the network would have no effect. The only thing that I can think of is that there was an update to the UEFI. \nI have tried many different flavors of Linux since then, Arch, Kali, Red Hat, Slackware, even FreeBSD in legacy mode. Same issue, wifi drops off after 15 minutes and is no longer useful. The only operating system that seems to work perfectly with this laptop is Windows 10.  Believe it or not, it was having issues with Windows 8.1 when I did a restore. I had to hardwire it to be able to update to Windows 10 again. So beware if you are planning on dumping Windows off this machine. It would be best to use a virtual machine and run anything other than Windows on top of Windows.  shudder\n", "Q: How do I \"unpin\" the kernel? Earlier this year I had to pin my kernel because an update came down the pipe that broke WINE compatibility with Win16 apps.  I followed the directions here:\nHow to skip kernel update?\nIt appears as though the issue has been fixed because tests have shown that Win16 applications once again work with later kernel builds.  I've removed the changes I made, but the kernel is still not updating.  What am I missing?\n\nA: Okay, TONS and TONS of hits on how to pin a kernel, but not one blessed article I can find on the entire internet on how to \"unpin\" the kernel and let allow it to be updated again?  That's just INSANE.\nIn any event, I never did find out how to \"unpin\" the kernel, BUT I went to this link: http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/kernel/\nAnd I pulled down the latest AMD64 kernel, headers and extras for Trusty and just installed them manually and rebooted.  I'm finally on a later kernel, and since I am no longer on the \"pinned\" kernel, I think it should upgrade normally from now on.\n", "Q: Installing java 8 on ubuntu I am trying to install Java 8 on Ubuntu. Due to restrictions on download at my work place, I cannot install using apt-get. Hence, I downloaded the archive from Oracle's website, named jdk-8u25-linux-x64.gz. However, when I extracted it, there was only a file inside it, named jdk-8u25-linux-x64. How to install using that file?\n\nA: These are the installation instructions for Java SE Development Kit 8u25 (jdk-8u25-linux-x64.tar.gz) which I copied from the Oracle website. This isn't really an answer, it's a long comment to demonstrate that the question is indeed a duplicate of How can I install Sun/Oracle's proprietary Java JDK 6/7/8 or JRE?.\n\nInstallation of the 64-bit JDK on Linux Platforms\nThis procedure installs the Java Development Kit (JDK) for 64-bit Linux, using an archive binary file (.tar.gz).\nThese instructions use the following file:\njdk-8u25-linux-x64.tar.gz\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the file.\nBefore the file can be downloaded, you must accept the license agreement. The archive binary can be installed by anyone (not only root users), in any location that you can write to. However, only the root user can install the JDK into the system location.\n\n*Change directory to the location where you would like the JDK to be installed, then move the .tar.gz archive binary to the current directory.\n\n*Unpack the tarball and install the JDK.\n tar zxvf jdk-8u25-linux-x64.tar.gz\n\nThe Java Development Kit files are installed in a directory called jdk1.8.0_version in the current directory.\n\n*Delete the .tar.gz file if you want to save disk space.\nThe only change that I made from the source is to change the name of the file to the name of the file that was downloaded in the question. Is it OK to do this? Yes indeed. See the Oracle documentation: Installation Instructions Notation and Files.\n\nA: As it turns out, you shouldn't rely on ubuntu's archive manager.

Search using nautilus or browser\nYou can search as mentioned above in the /usr/share/doc directory, but some packages install it in their /usr/share/package_name directories or even other locations. Here you can find the html and pdf docus, best using nautilus (use the search function of nautilus and open your requested docu in your browser). If you often use the docu don't forget to bookmark your link.\n2. Using find command\nFrom your command line you can use the find command to search for  your docu:\n\n\n*\n\n*html-documentation:\nfind /usr/share -type f -name index.html | grep doxy\n\n*pdf-documention:\nfind /usr/share/ -type f -name *.pdf | grep doxy\nInvoke your result with evince or your browser (in my case google-chrome)\n\n\n*\n\n*html:\ngoogle-chrome /usr/share/doc/doxygen/html/index.html\n\n*pdf:\ngoogle-chrome /usr/share/doc/doxygen_manual.pdf\nevince /usr/share/doc/doxygen_manual.pdf\n3. Make a list and search and invoke with less\nI prefer to automate this task and make a list the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*for html:\nfind /usr/share/ -type f -name index.html | sort -k1 | awk '{ print \"file://\" $0;}' > ~/DocHtml.txt\n\n*for pdf:\nfind /usr/share/ -type f -name *.pdf | sort -k1 | awk '{ print \"file://\" $0;}' > ~/DocPdf.txt\nThis will create 2 files in your home-directory (DocPdf.txt and DocHtml.txt). Simply open this with less \nless ~/DocPdf.txt\n\nor\nless ~/DocHtml.txt\n\nand press & followed with your searching string, e.g. doxygen. \nNow simple move your mouse over the requested document and press ctrl and left-mouse-click will open the file.\nYou can also make a bash script and invoke it via a chron job. This will automate the task. \nHere is a simple bash script which can be modified. Put additional directories as desscribed in the script. Save the below bash script as makeDoc, change chmod +x makeDoc and invoke it with ./makeDoc. Rest as above:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Author: abu\n# Description: script creates two files, DocPdf.txt and DocHtml.txt, \n#   which lists all pdf/html documents found by the find function.\n#\n#   You can include other search directories, e.g. Anaconda, \n\ndeclare -a DocDirs=(\n    \"/usr/share/\"\n    \"/opt/anaconda3/\"       # you can put here additional  directories\n#   \"/path/to/other/dirs/\"  # -\"\"-     -\"\"-    -\"\"-\n)\n\necho \"DocHtml automatic generated!\" > DocHtml.txt\necho \"   File generated with\" $0 >> DocHtml.txt\necho -e \"   Date: \" `date` \"\\n\\n\" >> DocHtml.txt\n\necho \"DocPdf automatic generated!\" > DocPdf.txt\necho \"   File generated with\" $0 >> DocPdf.txt\necho -e \"   Date: \" `date` \"\\n\\n\" >> DocPdf.txt\n\nfor i in \"${DocDirs[@]}\"\ndo\n    find $i -type f -name index.html | sort -k1 | awk '{ print \"file://\" $0;}' >> ~/DocHtml.txt\n    find $i -type f -name *.pdf | sort -k1 | awk '{ print \"file://\" $0;}' >> ~/DocPdf.txt\ndone\n\n4. APT Package Solution\nThe package doc-base helps developers to install it in the correct way. To view this I know dhelp and doc-central.\n4.1 dhelp: web base documentation reader.\nInstall it with \nsudo apt-get install dhelp\n\nand open in your browser the file:\nfile:///usr/share/doc/HTML/Programming/Awk/index.html\n\n\n\n*\n\n*documentation are well indexed\n\n*documentation is available through a web browser\n\n*indexes documentation (in the background)\n\n*not so convenient command line interface\n.\n\n\n4.2 doc-central: web base documentation reader.\nInstall it with:\nsudo apt-get install doc-central\n\n\n\n*\n\n*documentation are well indexed\n\n*documentation is available through a web browser\n\n*indexes documentation (in the background)\n\n*not so convenient command line interface\n\n", "Q: Can't find window builder on ubuntu I am searching for window builder in eclipse.\n\nA: If you are running the official Eclipse version, go to Help -> Install Software.

You will find it in the machine's configuration in VirtualBox.\n\n\nA: The VT-X And VT-D Are in your virtual machines settings in the boot order. But to activate any of the both. You need to turn on virtualization in your BIOS. For your PC, It should be F2. Then Go and change the following:\nSecurity > Execute Disable (set to On)\nPerformance > Virtualization (set to On)\nPerformance > VT for Direct I/O Access (set to On)\nPerformance > Trusted Execution (set to Off)\n\nActivating virtualization in the BIOS should let you boot your virtual machine.\n\nA: For sony vaio users you need to press F2 to enter into bios.

I've tried alt+0198but it doesn't work. I guess that only works in Windows. How do I type it in Ubuntu?\n\nA: From this Ubuntu Forums post: Press CtrlShiftu and the Unicode number of the character. In this case, æ is 00e6 (or simply e6). e6 is 230 in decimal, so presumably you were talking about the capital letter (Æ), which is c6 (198).\n\nA: If you need such characters frequently, one-shot solutions like composing or going through code points don't really cut it. I would suggest you give one of the \"international\" US key layouts a try.\nI'm German, but prefer (*) US keyboards with the \"English (US) English (international AltGr dead keys)\" key layout -- at least that's what Mint (an Ubuntu derivative) calls it. For X11, that'd be \"-xkblayout us -xkbvariant altgr-intl\". Windows calls it \"US International Alternate\".\nIt leaves the basic mappings (those available via Shift-<key> etc.) alone, but allows easy accent construction by making `, ', ^ and \" \"dead\" when entered with AltGr, plus making many international characters directly available via AltGr:\n¡²³¤€¼½¾‘’¥×\näåé®þüúíóö«»¬\náßðø¶ø\næ©ñç¿\n\nYour \"æ\", for example, would be AltGr-Z. You quickly get used to where those extra characters are, and you don't have to memorize (or look up) character codes.\n\n(*): US layout makes /{[]}\\| much easier to reach, which I welcome since I write code most of the day.\n\nA: When one needs some specific unicode char one can open KCharSelect and guess it's name there:\n\none then can copy-paste that in any application.\n\nA: If you need \"Æ\" because you actually write in Norwegian sometimes the most simple would be to activate the Norwegian keyboard layout in Ubuntu's OS settings so that you have two available keyboards layouts, English and Norwegian (f. ex.) and you can quickly switch between them. You can probably also set a keyboard shortcut for swithcing between the keyboard layouts.\n\nA: Typing unicode is slightly different in Ubuntu.\nThe key combination is:\nCtrl+Shift+U, code, Space\nHowever, Windows uses decimal notation while Ubuntu uses Hex notation.\nÆ in this case (what 0198 is) is c6 for Ubuntu. So, you'd do:\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Shift+U. Release it.\n\n*Type c6 (or 00c6)\n\n*Press Space\nIf you were talking about æ (or 145 on Windows), replace all instances of c6 with e6.\nAs mentioned by @Graham, you can also use the compose key. By default, it is AltGr or Right Alt. You can use Shift+AltGr followed by A, E to enter an æ. I think holding the other shift as well will give you Æ. On some keyboard layouts, AltGR+A or AltGR+Z (below) will also give æ.\nAs mentioned by @DevSolar, if you need to use special characters frequently, you can also use keyboard styles such as English (US) English (international AltGr dead keys). These keys will automatically map certain AltGRs to characters.\n\n(src)\n\nA: Whatever you have set as the compose key then a then e in sequence will produce æ \nThis solution is much simpler, as you don't have to know the unicode for the character you wish to type. For example compose key  then o then e will produce œ. compose key then c then , (comma) will produce ç and so on.\n\nA: There’s another method: typing using the Meta key\nIn this case, it’s Meta-f because the ASCII code (and Unicode) of f is 66hex, and the Unicode of æ is U+00E6, and 66hex + 80hex = E6hex.\nYou will need to either use xterm with Meta key configured correctly, or a BSD with wscons(4) text console (not FreeBSD, which has a different one), or a custom keyboard layout (I made one for Windows (NT 4 and up), one for the Linux text console, and three for X11 (XFree86® (MirBSD), old X.org (e.g. Ubuntu hardy), new X.org (what you probably have)). The Meta key function is on the left Alt key for all these layouts (and BSD wscons) except the WinNT one, where it is on the right Alt key. (Your left Windows key is then usable for the GUI “Alt” key function.) Beware that I also changed the location of the Esc key for my own convenience (but I’m willing to put up variants without that). This is a graphical depiction of the keyboard layout (XFree86® variant, but the others are almost the same): \n", "Q: Screen brightness cannot be changed after upgrade to 14.10 As the title suggests, I upgraded my Dell XPS 15 laptop to 14.10 and now the brightness is stuck at the lowest level.\nThe fn+F4/F5 displays the brightness notifications but the brightness level of the screen does not change.\nThings I have tried that did not help:\nSwitching from Nvidia drivers to Nouveau did not help. \nxrandr does increase the gamma a tiny bit:\n xrandr --output \"LVDS1\" --brightness \"1\"\n\nMany questions suggest either adding or subtracting acpi_backlight to your /etc/default/grub file, which did not help either:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet acpi_backlight=vendor splash\"\n\nI also tried writing directly to the brightness file:\necho 4000 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nThere seem to be many questions of this type:\nAutomatic screen brightness on Ubuntu 14.10 not working right, manual controls not working at all\nCan't control laptop screen brightness after upgrading to 14.10\nHot keys brightness issues with Ubuntu 14.10 in Acer Aspire 5755\nToshiba u840: Hotkeys don't work after upgrading to 14.10\nUnable to change screen brightness with hotkeys on Ubuntu 14.10\nUpgraded to 14.10, brightness control quit working - Intel HD 4400\nWhich package should I be looking at to file a bug?

How do I install this dang thing?!  \nI attached two screenshots for clarification.\n\n\n\nA: Since Thunderbird version 60, Lightning is integrated in Thunderbird and no longer just an add-on.\nBut, unfortunately, for now, on Linux you still need to install the package separately. Hopefully this won't be the case for long...\nSo here is how to get the Lightning calendar on Thunderbird >= v60 if it was not installed directly along with Thunderbird:\nIf you have/had lightning already as an add-on, start with step 1. If you newly install Thunderbird or did not have Lightning installed as an add-on before, start at step 3.:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Thunderbird go to Tools > Add-ons > Extensions \n\n*Remove the Lightning add-on (don't worry, your calendar configurations will not disappear).\n\n*Close Thunderbird\n\n*Open a terminal and enter:\napt-get install xul-ext-lightning (you might need sudo ...)\n\n*Launch Thunderbird again and you should be good to go.\n\n\nA: After download .xpi file, open Thunderbird.\nOpen the Add-ons Manager ( Tools -> Add-ons )\nJust drag the .xpi file from nautilus, and drop it in the Add-ons Manager, then it should start installing.\n", "Q: Can I move or hide the unity panel so my browser tabs appear at the very top of the screen? I really like Ubuntu, but one minor annoyance I've always had with it is that, when using a web browser that places its tabs at the top of the application (Chrome in my case, though Firefox does this too), the unity panel (bar at the top of the screen) prevents the browser tabs from being placed at the very top of the screen. This makes it marginally more difficult for me to position my mouse over the tabs, as I have to worry about my mouse's vertical positioning instead of just pushing it all the way to the top of the screen as I do on Windows.\nIs there a way to hide this annoying bar or move it to the bottom of the screen so my browser tabs can utilize that valuable piece of screen real-estate instead of it being wasted on menu items I rarely use? (Or alternately, a solution like this would also be acceptable.)\n\nA: That feature is not available on the unity desktop. You can, however, install another desktop environment.\nlubuntu-desktop, gnome-session-fallback, xubuntu-desktop, and ubuntu-studio-desktop offer either autohide or in the case of gnome-session fallback there is a hide function you can click an arrow to hide the top panel.\nFor ubuntu-studio, xubuntu, and lubuntu you can right click on the panel, choose panel properties and there should be an autohide function somewhere in the options.\n\nA: Press F11 in the browser to put it in full screen mode.\n", "Q: Interrupted upgrade, now boot loop, restarts before Grub Laptop battery of my Lenovo Ideapad S205 ran out of power while upgrading to 14.10. I connected it and powered it up as usual, but forgot about resuming the upgrade. Then I put it to hibernate, and since then it's stuck in a boot loop whenever I turn it on.\nThe BIOS screen will load and the fan go on, but then it will turn black and the fan goes off. Then it does the same again, on and on.\nI can boot from live USB fine. I have chrooted and resumed the upgrade from here (dpkg --configure -a, then apt-get upgrade again) and configured Grub to show the boot menu (edited /etc/default/grub, then update-grub && grub-install /dev/sda). But the boot loop remains. I guess it never gets to the point where Grub takes over.\nCould it be that the hibernated session is broken and is preventing the boot procedure? Can I \"clear\" it? Edit: I tried to clear it with mkwap as suggested, but had no success. Btw the root and swap partitions are LVM, but the /boot partition is ext2.\nWhat else could cause this behaviour?\n\nA: You can clear the hibernated session by cleaning the swap partition (if isn't cleaned) \nyou can know what is your swap partition by running:\nlsblk -f | grep swap\n├─sda5 swap         81ede0e2-2b07-4986-9a98-cea7a5b22556 [SWAP]\n\nThen, you can clear it:\nmkswap /dev/YOUR-SWAP-PARTITION \n\n\nA: May be your grub installation is corrupted.

From its manual page:\n\nRsync  finds  files  that  need to be transferred using a \"quick\n  check\" algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed\n  in size or in last-modified time.\n\nUsing the --checksums option, it will look at the file contents instead:\n-c, --checksum              skip based on checksum, not mod-time & size\n\n\nA: A closer study has revealed the root cause of my problem: the receiving file system was not case-sensitive, and the files in question all had identical names in all but the extension, like this:\n2873603 Oct 20  2009 R1.JPG\n2180728 Oct 20  2009 R1.jpg\n2814276 Oct 20  2009 R2.JPG\n3150011 Oct 20  2009 R2.jpg\n\nThere seems to be a working general solution to the problem, but since I only had a few files to change, I did a manual name-modification job on them.

You can install it using -\nsudo apt-get install calibre\n\nCalibre manages your e-book collection for you. It is designed around\n  the concept of the logical book, i.e., a single entry in your library\n  that may correspond to actual e-book files in several formats.\nCalibre can sort the books in your library by: Title, Author, Date\n  added, Date published, Size, Rating, Series, etc.\nIn addition, it supports extra searchable metadata:\nTags: A flexible system for categorizing your collection however you like\nComments: A long form entry that you can use for book description, notes, reviews, etc.\n\nYou can easily search your book collection for a particular book.\n  calibre supports searching any and all of the fields mentioned above.\n  You can construct advanced search queries by clicking the helpful\n  \"Advanced search\" button to the left of the search bar.\nYou can export arbitrary subsets of your collection to your hard disk\n  arranged in a fully customizable folder structure.\nFinally, calibre will even go out onto the internet to find book\n  metadata based on existing title/author or ISBN information. It can\n  download various types of metadata and covers for your books,\n  automatically. The metadata system is written using plugins so that\n  different types of metadata sources can be supported in the future.\n\nYou can have a look at the other features here.\n", "Q: xubuntu: no indicator when VPN is activated In ubuntu, when a VPN connection is made, the network icon in the status bar will have a lock added to it.

However sometimes it creates a problem when using Latex/Auctex key shortcuts, because it \"eats\" the first C-c or C-x. To explain myself better, assume I want to comment out some lines in Tex.

Why do I need sudo to run apt-mirror?

The first entry is OK, but the next two should be similar.  You can always check it by entering the command sudo mount -a, which will mount all entries, but then you will see any errors at the commandline output.\nWhy would you even want to mount a partition to a mountpoint, then change that mountpoint to a different mountpoint?  That seems to be what you are trying to do.\nIt's much simpler, I think, to use symbolic links, and one mount command.  Once mounted, you can create a symbolic link from /mnt/bis/myuser to /home/myuser/mydocs  You can easily do this with Nautilus by creating the link in /mnt/bis/myuser after it's mounted, then moving it to /home/myuser, and renaming it to mydocs.  I actually use this method for all my home's data directories (Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc).  It ends up looking like the normal directories, but can be shared with other OS's)\n", "Q: Removable HDD defined in fstab causing problems at startup when not present Recently I made some edits in my fstab file after some change in my partitions. (check \nPartitions mounted with fstab, not opening from Nautilus nor Unity sidebars ) In the process I wanted to include a removable device so it would be present for all users when it was present.\nIt automatically mounted as \\media\\activeuser\\HDDMaker with user access permissions set to activeuser only.  My idea was to mount it as \\media\\HDDMaker with access permissions to any user in a given group (gid=1004 common).\nThe fstab file looks like this:\nUUID=543Exxxxxx  /mnt/543Exxxxxx  ntfs-3g  rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,auto,gid=1004,umask=0002 0 0\n/mnt/543Exxxxxx  /media/HDDMaker  auto     rbind,x-gvfs-show,x-gvfs-name=HDDMaker          0 0\n\nThis works fine when the HDD is attached to the computer at startup (except for the detail in my other question: Partitions mounted with fstab, not opening from Nautilus nor Unity sidebars ), but when the HDD is not attached I have two problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*It reports at startup that the device cannot be mounted. (and the startup process is halted until you press S)\n\n*When plug, after the system is up, it doesn't automatically mounts. You have to manually mount it as\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/HDDMaker\nThe desired behavior is that it reports no problem at startup, and that, when plugged, it automatically mounts on /media/HDDMaker, with permissions set to all users in group common.\n\nA: For an external drive, in order to prevent hold-up of the boot, the nobootwait option should be added to the fourth column in the /etc/fstab. Moreover, you should preferably use the UUID of the drive instead to ensure the right drive is always mounted (and see @Marty Fried’s comment to your question) so you get:\nUUID=XXXXX  /media/HDDMaker  auto     rbind,x-gvfs-show,x-gvfs-name=HDDMaker,nobootwait          0 0\n\nThis post explains when and why this is a good method.\nFurthermore, since fstab is run only on startup, unless you write a specific process to keep re-running it, you have to do a manual sudo mount -a\nto mount the disk if added afterwards, if you use the fstab option to auto-mount.\nTherefore, a solution you could try instead, if you have Desktop Ubuntu, is to eschew fstab for this solution\n", "Q: Is it still possible to develop C# software for Ubuntu?

The browser asks the OS for an available source port (let's say it receives 33123) then makes a socket connection to the destination port (usually 80/HTTP, 443/HTTPS).\nWhen the the web server receives the answer, it sends a response that has 80 as source port and 33123 as destination port.\nSo if you have 2 browsers concurrently accessing stackoverflow.com, you'd have something like this:\nFirefox (localhost:33123) <-----------> stackoverflow.com (69.59.196.211:80)\nChrome  (localhost:33124) <-----------> stackoverflow.com (69.59.196.211:80)\n\n\nSource - Stack Overflow, Flavius Stef\n\nA: I just checked the source code of chromium-browser version 65.0.3325.181-0ubuntu1.debian.\n# google_apis/gcm/engine/gservices_settings.cc\nconst char kDefaultCheckinURL[] = \"https://android.clients.google.com/checkin\";\nconst char kDefaultMCSHostname[] = \"mtalk.google.com\";\nconst int kDefaultMCSMainSecurePort = 5228;\nconst int kDefaultMCSFallbackSecurePort = 443;\n// ...\nGURL GServicesSettings::GetMCSMainEndpoint() const {\n  // ...\n  return GURL(MakeMCSEndpoint(kDefaultMCSHostname, kDefaultMCSMainSecurePort));\n}\n\n\nLooks like chromium is connecting to some google services on port 5228.\n", "Q: grep to get compile error I have created a simple c program and have left off a ';' on purpose to get an error.\nI want using the grep command to know whether the compilation was successful or not.\nI use:\ngcc test.c | grep 'error' but the output does not seem right. Is this the right way ?\nI am supposing it does not work because by doing:\necho \"hello world\" | grep \"hello\" I get a coloured text for the match. \nWhen doing grep for compilation there is no such thing.  \nThe error has this form:\ntest.c: In function ‘main’:\ntest.c:8:2: error: expected ‘,’ or ‘;’ before ‘return’\n  return 0;\n  ^\n\nand the program I use is :\nint main(int argc, char const *argv[]){\n    char f[] = \"Hello thereeee!\" \n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nA: If you would like to know whether a command has succeeded or failed, you usually have to check its exit code. Zero indicates success, non-zero shows failure.\nExample in shell:\ngcc foo.c\nrc=$?  # Store exit code for later use\nif [ $rc -ne 0 ]; then  # $rc not equal to zero\n    echo \"gcc exited with $rc\"\nfi\n\nYou could also use && or || to execute a command on success or failure, respectively:\ngcc foo.c && echo gcc succeeded\ngcc foo.c || echo gcc failed\n\nAs mentioned in the comments, gcc foo.c | grep error did not catch everything because a pipe normally catches the standard output (stdout) only. Programs will often output exceptional messages to standard error (stderr). To catch that stream, you have to redirect stderr to stdout before piping to grep:\ngcc foo.c 2>&1 | grep error\n\nOr, if you use the bash shell, you can use this shorthand:\ngcc foo.c |& grep error\n\nNow, this gcc generates an a.out binary. If you just want to check for syntax errors, you can use gcc -fsyntax-only foo.c. You can then examine at the output or check its exit code for errors.\n\nA: Solved by muru in comments:\n\nYou should be grepping the stderr:\ngcc ... |& grep.\n\n–  muru\n\n", "Q: Will an open source .NET framework allow built-in Windows program compatibility? As probably at least a few people know, Microsoft made the .NET application framework open source. \nDoes this mean that it will be possible to run more Windows programs on Linux, and somehow speed up wine by directly integrating APIs? Or is it more of just a development system that won't be possible to natively integrate to run as smoothly as programs written to use bash? \nI've used wine and found that, even on distros where it is natively installed it ends up running slowly even for the most basic programs, and with virtual disks and such it ends up being a pain to use. Will it be possible to integrate the APIs on a core/kernel level, maybe change a couple things so that slashes are represented differently, and throw in a reported Windows version and let them run as they would natively? If anyone thinks this is going to be possible only once pigs fly on their own please tell me that it won't ever work, but I'd like to know specifically why it would or would not work, not just a one word answer.\n\nA: What's wine got to do with it? Let's ignore that for a moment.\nMicrosoft are open sourcing the core parts of .NET as well as making ASP.NET more open source than it already was. On their own, these two parts would allow you to make command line applications and ASP.NET websites. If you have existing applications like this, it should eventually be possible to create Linux targets (if that's even required) and run them natively on Ubuntu.\nThat said, there are a whole fleet of .NET components required to make something like a GUI application. On Windows, developers use things like the Windows Presentation Foundation to draw things on the screen. In Mono, we can use things like GTK# and Qt#. If you want a cross-platform application, you need a cross-platform toolkit.\nThat's a very long winded way of saying not much is going to change initially. Developers could use Mono before if they wanted cross-platform apps and they still can. In the future it'll perhaps be easier to pull in Mono's toolkits into a VS.NET project, or MS will replace WPF with a cross-platform toolkit.\nBack to Wine. A .NET application running in Wine will still need something to provide it with presentation libraries and (if native Windows libraries) they're going to need to still go through Wine so the right environment is provided for them. Wine is still the link between application and hardware (well virtual hardware through Linux) that .NET sits on top of. I can't see that arrangement changing any time soon.\n", "Q: Lenovo Thinkpad E330 wireless hardware blocked I have an issue with freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04.

A few potential workarounds are shown in the comments on that ticket.  One workaround is to drop into a terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+F1, logging in, and then running unity --replace.  Other variations are shown in the bug comments.\n\nA: This can be worked around without losing your session by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to a tty (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F1)\n\n*Log in\n\n*Run: sudo loginctl unlock-sessions\n\n*Switch back to the Desktop: Ctrl+Alt+F7 (or F8).\n\n\nFrom the bug report fori this issue and this answer to a similar question\n\nA: I see in some cases it could be linked to the use of Nvidia drivers.

I pluged it as instructed, with an external power source, but the unit just flashes and never gets mounted.\nThe most strange thing is that I tried it on 2 computers at my work (12.04 and 14.04) and it worked flawlessly.\nI used a USB voltage/amperage tester to check the ports and they have similar reads at my home and at work.\nChecking dmesg I see that Ubuntu recognizes it and then immediately disconnects.

How can I get this to work? I'm guessing there's one of those boot parameters I could change to get this working?\n\nA: First do a MD5 hash check of the ISO to verify it.\nIn case the ISO is valid, you may be facing an issue because of your GPU, ie Nvidia GTX 765M.\nTry the following to make it work.\n\n\n*\n\n*As soon as you boot from the USB, press any key to enter the splash screen.\n\n*Press F6 and select the nomodeset option\n \n\n\n*Now select Try Ubuntu without installing option and check whether the problem persists.\n\n*In case nomodeset does not work, try either acpi=off or nolapic options and try again.\nALTERNATIVELY, you can edit the /boot/grub/grub.cfg on your live USB and add the nomodeset option.\nEdit :\nWhat is nomodeset?\nThe newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into the kernel. So all the programming of the hardware specific clock rates and registers on the video card happen in the kernel rather than in the X driver when the X server starts.. This makes it possible to have high resolution nice looking splash (boot) screens and flicker free transitions from boot splash to login screen. Unfortunately, on some cards this doesnt work properly and you end up with a black screen. Adding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not load video drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.\nNote that this option is sometimes needed for nVidia cards when using the default \"nouveau\" drivers. Installing proprietary nvidia drivers usually makes this option no longer necessary, so it may not be needed to make this option permanent, just for one boot until you installed the nvidia drivers.\nSource\n", "Q: Device not found when setting up android usb debugging in Ubuntu 14.10 I have an HP 10 Plus 2210xx tablet, and I want to use it for Android USB debugging.

(And then Boot into Full Windows With Luks Running Silently In the Background)\nI have a client that is completely unable to use Linux, but I was thinking maybe there was a way to setup their computer to look like it just runs windows, but actually use LUKS in place of truecrypt in light of the recent developments with truecrypt re: truecrypt website.\nAnyone have any ideas?  I know it won't be as fast as running a native windows FDE solution, but I think it would be more secure due to its uniqueness.\n\nA: Luks works at the block level so theoretically you can put any filesystems you want inside it including NTFS.\nBut you wouldn't be able to boot directly into Windows and access it, except I guess if Windows was running on a virtual machine inside your Linux installation.\nWhile setting it up is outside the scope of this site, you could use Bitlocker.\n", "Q: Is there any way to show vnstat as indicator Unity? I tray indicator-netspeed but show sum of download and upload, I want to show each one seperate, Then tray system-monitor-indicator and show total network, I want to show just ppp0 bandwith.\nIs there any way to show result of vnstat (vnstat -i ppp0 -l -ru) as indicator?\n\nA: I've generally found the utilities like vnstat to be problematic.  Whenever I have needed network flow analysis I have used either iptables or scapy on top of pcap\niptables example\nsudo iptables -N measure\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o $INTERFACE -j measure\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -i $INTERFACE -j measure\nsudo iptables -A measure -m quota --quota $bytequota -m comment --comment \"measure\" -j ACCEPT \nsudo iptables -A measure -j REJECT -m comment --comment \"exceeded measure\"\nsudo iptables -A measure -j RETURN\n\nThis will count bytes on an interface.  Use different rules if you want separate values for input/output.   Very flexible and you can put results into whatever analysis you want (Kafka, google sheet etc).   Scapy is far more flexible but I can't provide an example in an answer box....\n\nA: I use system-load-indicator by Michael Hoffmann.  It shows everything (CPU, net, disk...) but you can selectively turn on what goes into the indicator panel.

(I'm going to fall short of delivering example use cases for each, but I figured this much out to satisfy my curiosity so I may as well contribute it.) \nFrom smallest to largest:\nnginx-light: \"basic version\"\nThe minimal set of modules for basic functionality. \nnginx-naxsi: \"version with naxsi\"\nThe minimal set, plus the hardened \"Nginx Anti Xss & Sql Injection\" configuration and its required plugins. \nnginx-core: \"core version\"\nThe standard nginx deployment, less the third-party modules. \nThis is the first Canonical-supported nginx package. It's in the Ubuntu \"main\" repository instead of the community-supported \"universe\" repository. See the announcement \"nginx-core is now in Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 Main!\" on an archive of the maintainer's unofficial (older and now defunct) blog or on the copy of the old post on the maintainer's unofficial blog: \n\nnone of the already-established flavors of nginx are included in Ubuntu Main (nginx-light, nginx-full, nginx-extras, and nginx-naxsi). The Ubuntu Security Team has said that the third-party modules are wildly different in coding and therefore cannot be supported.\nTo that end, we created a package called nginx-core which has been included in the Main repository. This package contains only the modules that ship with the stock nginx tarball. We do not include any third-party modules with this package, just the modules that come from NGINX upstream.\n\nnginx-full: \"standard version\"\nThe standard nginx deployment, including frequently-used third-party modules. \nnginx-extras: \"extended version\"\nThe standard nginx deployment plus several infrequently-used and largish modules.\n\nA: \nNotice: Debian has adjusted this so flavors no longer exist; this will eventually affect Ubuntu probably in 23.10.\n\nWhile Steven's answer touches on the key points and a very basic summary of what each flavor is, I'll give you a much larger description of the differences, as I work on the packaging quite a bit, and the very different sets of modules in each is absolutely critical to a good answer.  The basic descriptions don't do much justice to the comparison.  (Also, kudos to Steven quoting my older blog (and even referring to me as a 'maintainer'.  I meant to port the nginx-is-coming-to-main post to my newer blog, but I haven't had the opportunity.)\nAlso note that the latest packages for the NGINX web server are available in the NGINX PPAs, maintained by myself, based almost entirely off of Debian.  (Stable PPA (1.6.2 as of this post); Mainline PPA (1.7.7 as of this post, with 1.7.8 slated to land on December 4, 2014))\n\n#The Different Flavors of nginx:\nThe different flavors are all the same version of nginx, however the flavors were decided upon by the Debian package maintainers in order to provide different feature sets (for nginx-extras) as well as the bare minimum and the most feature-effective 'full' set of functions that web servers tend to have used in websites.  The exact reason a feature was chosen over another is not known to me, however in supplementary discussion with one of the Debian maintainers on IRC, a statement was made affirming my initial assessment, that each variant was intended on being a different set of features for a different use case - light for a lightweight set of features that meets bare minimum of site hosting, full for a more full set of features without including any much-heavier extras, and extras for pretty much everything that is in the package that can be included in Ubuntu.  naxsi, prior to 15.04, was the Naxsi variant specifically with only the bare minimum of modules in it, as naxsi could be fairly resource intensive.\nSupposedly, according to one of the Debian maintainers of NGINX who is regularly coordinating with Upstream NGINX in a private conversation of which I cannot currently post logs, NGINX 2.x is going to have loadable module support.  In which case, light, full, and extras will become metapackages which call upon the individual packages containing each module.  The date this becomes the case is not known, however, nor is which modules will actually be capable of doing this.\nAs it currently stands, the nginx virtual package is designed to just install one of the available versions.  By default, as nginx-core is in main and we would love if individuals used it more, nginx-core is the first item seen and install-attempted in the virtual package.  (However, the nginx package can rely on any one of the flavors of nginx, and is mainly there to make installation a little bit easier for those who don't need any specific flavor preference)\nA detailed breakdown with the specific modules available in each variant (based off of the Vivid debian/control file and the Trusty debian/control file (as the Naxsi packages have been removed in Vivid)) is available below.  Note that this does not reflect the most up to date changes in Ubuntu, and you should refer to those package descriptions to make sure you have updated, accurate information:\n\n*\n\n*nginx-core is the only flavor in the Main section of the Ubuntu Repositories, as of 14.04, and exists only in the Ubuntu repositories (and is not in the PPAs or Debian, and is not going to be included in Debian ever).  It is effectively identical to the nginx-full flavor, but does not contain any third party modules.  The reasoning behind using nginx-full as the base for this variant was that we wanted to provide a relatively-full-fledged set of core modules in the built binaries, while keeping third party modules out at the same time.  As such, it does not contain any of the third-party modules, since the Security Team did a review of the code and found that third party modules have widely varying coding styles which aren't as nicely supported as the nginx-tarball-included modules (this is discussed more in-depth in the Main Inclusion Request/Report bug, which contains the discussion points and further review discussions as to what could be included in Ubuntu Main for nginx).  A full list of the modules enabled here is in the package description, which I've nitpicked here:\n\n\nSTANDARD HTTP MODULES: Core, Access, Auth Basic, Auto Index, Browser,\nCharset, Empty GIF, FastCGI, Geo, Gzip, Headers, Index, Limit Requests,\nLimit Zone, Log, Map, Memcached, Proxy, Referer, Rewrite, SCGI,\nSplit Clients, SSI, Upstream, User ID, UWSGI.\nOPTIONAL HTTP MODULES: Addition, Debug, GeoIP, Gzip Precompression, HTTP Sub,\nImage Filter, IPv6, Real IP, Spdy, SSL, Stub Status, Substitution, WebDAV,\nXSLT.\nMAIL MODULES: Mail Core, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, SSL.\n\n\n*\n\n*nginx-light is the lightest flavor of nginx available.  It is in the Universe repository and you have to have that enabled to use it.  It does not enable a large amount of the modules available in -core or -full.  It also contains third-party modules.  The modules available in it are as follows:\n\n\nSTANDARD HTTP MODULES: Core, Access, Auth Basic, Auto Index, Charset,\nEmpty GIF, FastCGI, Gzip, Headers, Index, Log, Map, Proxy, Rewrite, Upstream.\nOPTIONAL HTTP MODULES: Auth Request, Debug, Gzip Precompression, IPv6, Real\nIp, SSL, Stub Status.\nTHIRD PARTY MODULES: Echo.\n\n\n*\n\n*nginx-full is one of the more feature-rich flavors of the nginx package.  Like its light counterpart, it is in the Universe repository.  It enables most of the core included modules that are standard and optional in the from-nginx source tarball, as well as several more third-party modules designed to extend the capabilities of the nginx web server.  It's modules are as follows:\n\n\nSTANDARD HTTP MODULES: Core, Access, Auth Basic, Auto Index, Browser,\nCharset, Empty GIF, FastCGI, Geo, Gzip, Headers, Index, Limit Requests,\nLimit Zone, Log, Map, Memcached, Proxy, Referer, Rewrite, SCGI,\nSplit Clients, SSI, Upstream, User ID, UWSGI.\nOPTIONAL HTTP MODULES: Addition, Auth Request, Debug, GeoIP, Gzip\nPrecompression, HTTP Sub, Image Filter, IPv6, Real IP, Spdy, SSL, Stub Status,\nSubstitution, WebDAV, XSLT.\nMAIL MODULES: Mail Core, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, SSL.\nTHIRD PARTY MODULES: Auth PAM, DAV Ext, Echo, HTTP Substitution Filter,\nUpstream Fair Queue.\n\n\n*\n\n*nginx-extras is the most feature-rich flavor of the nginx package.  And like its full and light brothers, it too is in the Universe repository.  It enables all of the modules in nginx-full but also includes additional modules (such as the Perl module), and many more third-party modules designed to even further extend the capabilities of the nginx web server.  Its full modules list is below:\n\n\nSTANDARD HTTP MODULES: Core, Access, Auth Basic, Auto Index, Browser,\nCharset, Empty GIF, FastCGI, Geo, Gzip, Headers, Index, Limit Requests,\nLimit Zone, Log, Map, Memcached, Proxy, Referer, Rewrite, SCGI,\nSplit Clients, SSI, Upstream, User ID, UWSGI.\nOPTIONAL HTTP MODULES: Addition, Auth Request, Debug, Embedded Perl, FLV,\nGeoIP, Gzip Precompression, Image Filter, IPv6, MP4, Random Index, Real IP,\nSecure Link, Spdy, SSL, Stub Status, Substitution, WebDAV, XSLT.\nMAIL MODULES: Mail Core, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, SSL.\nTHIRD PARTY MODULES: Auth PAM, Chunkin, DAV Ext, Echo, Embedded Lua,\nFancy Index, HttpHeadersMore, HTTP Substitution Filter, http push,\nNginx Development Kit, Upload Progress, Upstream Fair Queue.\n\n\n*\n\n*nginx-naxsi is the variant of nginx which has the Naxsi Web Application Firewall module available.  It too is in Universe, however this flavor is no longer supported by Debian maintainers, and will be completely dropped from Ubuntu with the 15.04 release.  In addition to the Naxsi WAF module, it also includes a much lighter set of modules than nginx-full. The full list of modules is below:\n\n\nSTANDARD HTTP MODULES: Core, Access, Auth Basic, Auto Index, Browser,\nCharset, Core, Empty GIF, FastCGI, Geo, Gzip, Headers, Index,\nLimit Requests, Limit Zone, Log, Map, Memcached, Proxy, Referer,\nRewrite, Split Clients, SSI, Upstream, User ID.\nOPTIONAL HTTP MODULES: Debug, IPv6, Real IP, SSL, Stub Status.\nTHIRD PARTY MODULES: Naxsi, Cache Purge, Upstream Fair.\n\n\nResource Usage Among the Flavors\nWhile I am not aware of any benchmarks that have been run on the various flavors of nginx, it is typically logical to assume that the more feature-enabled the version of nginx you use, the more resources it would use.\nHowever, unlike Apache which can be something of a memory whore with the more modules enabled, nginx still does not eat as much memory compared to Apache when modules are enabled.  (The exception to this statement is the naxsi flavor.  That flavor always eats a lot more resources, as it is a Web Application Firewall as well as a web server.)\nI will add benchmarks to this answer if I find them, but again, I am not aware of any existing benchmarks for the various flavors against each other.  And even though the sites I run don't have heavy traffic, I haven't noticed any real performance decrease between nginx-extras, nginx-full, or nginx-light on a PHP-driven site.\n", "Q: How do you return a list of the current project folders and files of your current project in QtCreator?

When you delete files from a flash drive or external hard drive, files go to a trash bin located physically in the drive.\nBut in the GUI, both the external drive's trash and the computer's trash are coalesced into one. When you empty the trash you are emptying both trashes. That also seems to be the case for OS X and Windows.\nI could, obviously, delete the trash on the flash drive using the terminal, but it seems to me there should be a way of emptying the flash drive trash without emptying the computer's trash using the GUI.\nIs there one in Ubuntu ?\n\nA: When you open flash drive press CTRL+H or through menu View > Show hidden files, hidden folder should appear .Trash-1000 or similar. Delete this folder like normal file, you will be prompted with ask \"Remove it permanently?\", press delete button. Or delete this folder by selecting it and pressing Shift+Del.\n", "Q: How to grant access to a folder which resides in a folder owned by another group Situation:\nGroup A requires access to /path/to/dir/foo to upload files through ssh or ftp, but the directory in question: /path/to/dir/foo is owned by group B (if you'd like: /path is recursively owned by B), which should stay this way, for security reasons.\n\nMy attempt for a solution:\nI create a symbolic link to /home/A, which A owns. Next, I grant permissions so A can access the symlink:\nsudo ln -s /path/to/dir/foo /home/A/foo\nsudo chown -h A:A /home/A/foo\n\nI figured that /path/to/dir/foo should at least be owned by a group that A is part of:\nsudo addgroup C\nsudo useradd -G C A\nsudo chown -R B:C /path/to/dir/foo\nsudo chmod -R 774 /path/to/dir/foo\n\nAfter doing all that, I connected through an FTPS client as user A and changed directory to: /home/A. To my surprise the symlink is not visible, which is odd, because the proFTPd is set up to show symlinks.\nI also tried connecting through SFTP to the same directory. This time the symlink was visible, but when I tried to access it, I got the following prompt:\n\nCannot open remote file '/path/to/dir/foo'.\nPermission denied.\n  Error code: 3\n  Error message from server: Permission denied\n\nThat leaves me with little to no alternatives, since this was the easiest solution I could think of.\n\nDesperate attempt:\nI granted global permissions to /path/to/dir/foo, but I still couldn't access the symlink foo in /home/A as user A. Meaning: ls -l /path/to/dir/foo would print -rwxrwxrwx.\n\nQuestion:\nHow do I create a symlink /home/A/foo which points to /path/to/dir/foo. Which A can access, despite /path/to/dir/foo being mostly owned by user:group B (/path is owned by B) ?\n\nA: If your directory is in an ext4 filesystem, you can use ACL. Best explained by example; my user is romano and the other user is default. \nAs romano: \n[romano:~/tmp] % mkdir -p a/b/c/d\n[romano:~/tmp] % cd !$\ncd a/b/c/d\n[romano:~/tmp/a/b/c/d] % touch f1\n[romano:~/tmp/a/b/c/d] % ls -l\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 romano romano 0 nov 27 17:15 f1\n\nObviously I can write to directory d, it's mine... but from default: \ndefault@pern:/home/romano/tmp/a/b/c/d$ touch f2\ntouch: cannot touch ‘f2’: Permission denied\n\nYep. No symbolic link will change the fact that default can't write there. \nNow, as romano, I grant additional access to group default: \n[romano:~/tmp/a/b/c/d] % setfacl -m g:default:rwx .\n\n(read as: add rwx permission to group default to the current . directory) \n...And now, as default: \ndefault@pern:/home/romano/tmp/a/b/c/d$ touch f2\ndefault@pern:/home/romano/tmp/a/b/c/d$ ls -l\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 romano  romano  0 nov 27 17:15 f1\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 default default 0 nov 27 17:17 f2\n\nACL syntax is a bit convouted, but it's a quite powerful tool. See man setfacl and man getfacl for a full info and more examples. \nIn your case if you have /path/to/dir/foo  owned by A:A, and you want group B to have write access to foo you should: \n\n\n*\n\n*add +rx permission to each of the directory leading to it for group B: \n setfacl -m g:B:r-x /path\n setfacl -m g:B:r-x /path/to\n setfacl -m g:B:r-x /path/to/dir\n\n\n*add +rwx permssion to group B to the directory: \n setfacl -m g:B:rwx /path7to7dir/foo\n\nNotice however that seems we have a nasty bug around... See http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=8527. I am not sure about the consequences --- the simple case above worked ok, but please check it.\n\nA: This answer is based on the tip Rmano gave at the end of his answer, even though the file access control list method didn't work.\nIt didn't work, because the full path, e.g. /path/to/dir requires at least read+execute permission: sudo chmod -R g+rx /path. This solved my issue, and I can now access the symbolic link in A's home directory, and write to the containing files.\n", "Q: Print driver for Epson Workforce Pro WP-4025 Does anybody run Epson Workforce Pro WP-4025DW on Ubuntu successfully?\nIf yes, which driver is similar.\nFor me it's not necessary to use all features, but I've no clue how different Epson printers are.

I work in a small office with 6 PCs and a server. I'm looking at installing Ubuntu on all of the computers, but I'd like users to be able to log in to any one of the computers and be able to access their files.\nIs it possible to store each users home directories on the server and set up each PC to check their credentials on there too?\nI'm thinking that by setting up the network like this I can keep everything tidily on one system and manage everything from there. Is this a sane approach or will it eventually just lead to more headaches/complexity and cause performance issues over LAN?\n\nA: There are several software solutions designed especially for those task, but I can suggest a simple ad-hoc solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*On server, create a single grand /home directory and share it by NFS. \n\n*On each client, move following files so that they, too, reside in NFS and share between PCs.\n\n/etc/passwd - user account information less the encrypted passwords \n/etc/shadow - contains encrypted passwords \n/etc/group - user group information \n/etc/gshadow - - group encrypted passwords\n\n\n*Mount NFSs at boot on each client. \n\n\nHowever, the problem is that some quirky PAM tricks do not play along with shared user settings. Those are the cases when you need a specific software. \n\nA: You will need more than one component to do this, and be aware that there are many ways to accomplish this;\nAt first you will need to have an Linux Domain Controller (Like Windows AD), to do your AAA.\nThen also an database server must be used to store these information (LDAP in most cases). There are \"all-in-one\" solutions for this like Fedora 389DS.\nAnd then you will need a storage server with;\n\n\n*\n\n*A 'private' share per user, which stores the user profile and personal data.\n\n*[OPT] A 'shared' share, only available for certain groups, users etc.\n\n\nHere you can also chose between software like Samba (which is the one you'll find the most docs on), Open Media Vault, FreeNAS etc.\nAfter that you will still need to look at ting such as WebDav to make your shares accessible from outside your LAN, or on mobile devices.\nEven then there are a lot more things that can be configured and implemented to improve overall usability. \nThere is something called Zentyal which is a Windows SMB-like server, based on Ubuntu that can do all this things with a nice web-GUI.\nIt is simply too much to explain everything in a post, but this will give you some info tho get started.

But if your package contains any debconf templates for setting up, you should use po-debconf to allow translations for those templates.\n", "Q: My USB Keyboard isn't working I have just installed Ubuntu and now my USB keyboard and mouse are not working.\nI plugged in a PS/2 keyboard so i can now execute commands.\nI get a lot of strange messages in dmesg: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9269795\nThe USB keyboard and mouse were working fine while installing from the Live CD.\nThe USB keyboard works in BIOS.\n\nA: I have fixed this problem by enabling IOMMU in BIOS. This seems to be a motherboard specific issue.\nForum thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2111223&p=12503485#post12503485\n\nJust wanted to add to this thread in case in helps someone -- I have\n  also been experiencing this bug (Networking and USB not working with\n  64-bit Linux kernels on the Gigabyte 970A-D3 Rev. 3.0 motherboard). I\n  originally posted about it in this thread if you want gory details.\nNote that my motherboard is a D3, not a DS3, though they are almost\n  identical.\nAlso note my motherboard is Rev. 3.0. The Revision is important as it\n  has a different bios than the earlier Revs; also, I did not have this\n  problem with the earlier Rev that I used briefly.\nFurther note, 32-bit kernels work fine, it's only the 64-bit ones that\n  don't have successfull Networking and USB.\nAnd further note - the same problem exists in the current 13.04 Raging\n  64-bit kernel as well.\nThe good news: I was able to get my system working by setting IOMMU to\n  ENABLED in the bios (it was set to disabled by 'optimized\n  settings'/defaults).\nYMMV. I figured out that I should play with this setting by going\n  through this thread and the similar launchpad bug mentioned earlier (\n  ), though I don't know if anyone else solved it by the same method.\nNot 100% sure where this bug should be reported to. Its not strictly a\n  Ubuntu bug, it affects all 64-bit kernels (that I tried, at least). I\n  guess it might be considered primarily a gigabyte bug. Not sure. I do\n  feel, though, that it would be better if the kernel gave some more\n  useful warning / debug messages in this case so people could diagnose\n  it better.

Now I've decided to install it on my HDD.\nMy PC has an SSD with Windows 7 Ultimate and a standard HDD that up to now I'm using just for storage.\nMy intention is to keep the SSD only for windows, particionate the HDD and install Ubuntu on it.\nMy doubts are:\n\n\n*\n\n*is this solution fine or some problems can rise and make my pc unstable (both on windows and ubuntu)?\n\n*installing two different OS on two different disks, I imagine I have to set the boot preference from BIOS.

Don't use the solution above...\nBoth possibilities (Using BIOS boot order/Not using BIOS) have their advantages/disadvantages.\nUsing BIOS\nAdvantages\n\n*\n\n*Windows doesn't even know that Ubuntu is there.\n\n*Ubuntu gets an entire HDD to itself\n\n*Easier to delete Windows once you've used a professional OS.  ;-)\n\nDisadvantages\n\n*\n\n*You have to remember to press the button!  ;-)\n\nNo BIOS\nAdvantages\n\n*\n\n*Just one menu to rule them all...\n\n*No need to hit the [F12] or whatever key on boot\n\nDisadvantages\n\n*\n\n*grub2 (the Ubuntu boot loader) incorporates the Windows boot loader into its own menu and boots Windows if you choose to. However, if you ever do a Windows boot repair, grub2 will be gone (Microsoft wants its OS to work and doesn't care about the rest of the world especially Linux) and you'll have to do grub2 repair as well.\n\n\nA: It's perfectly safe to install Ubuntu alongside Windows on a separate hard drive. Once installed you should not have to change any BIOS settings, instead Ubuntu will now be an option available to you in the Windows Boot Loader. You'll just have to select either load Windows or load Ubuntu from a menu.\nThe easiest method to achieve a dual boot is to install Ubuntu from inside Windows with the Ubuntu Windows Installer (Wubi). You can download it here.\nFor instructions on how to install Ubuntu using the installer you can read a detailed explanation here.\nJust be sure to select your HDD when you're asked where you want to install Ubuntu on this screen:\n\nOne thing to note is that Wubi only allows you to install a partition with a maximum of 30gb. If you want a larger partition you will need to install Ubuntu from your live USB. This method is also safe, just be sure you've specified the correct partition to install it to and be careful not to accidentally install it on your SSD.\n", "Q: Storage almost full for 14.10 I recently wiped my computer to have 14.10 as my only OS.

Any help is much appreciated.\n\nA: Before running the command try entering:\nexport JAVA_HOME=\"path_to_java_home\"\nWhere path_to_java_home is the folder where your bin/java is. \nIf java is properly installed you can find it's location, by using the command:\nreadlink -f $(which java)\nDon't forget to remove bin/java from the end of the path while putting it into JAVA_HOME\n\nA: Get your Java path using the command\nwhereis java\n\nThe following is a possible output depending on your default Java version\njava: /usr/bin/java /usr/share/java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_241/jre/bin/java\n\nMaven need to pick the Java location (home) so you can export the Java path using the following command\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_241/jre\n\nThis will allow Maven to pick the java version and location in the /etc/environment file\nOptionally you can add this in the /etc/environment manually using the following command\nsudo nano /etc/environment\n\nand edit the JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_241/jre/\n\nA: To make it automatic on Linux/Ubuntu, add these lines at the end of your .bashrc:\nJAVA_HOME=$(dirname $( readlink -f $(which java) ))\nJAVA_HOME=$(realpath \"$JAVA_HOME\"/../)\nexport JAVA_HOME\n\nThis gets java executable, then climbs up a directory level\nTo designate the default java version/executable on Debian/Ubuntu, run this once:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\nThis builds up on previous answer by Andrew Onischuk (thanks!)\n\nA: Try to edit /usr/bin/gradle\nComment the line \"export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java\" with a #\nthis: #export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java\n\nA: Run with sudo\nsudo ./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace eclipse\n\nYou are not a sudo doer for running this command\nSo Add sudo to it.\n", "Q: Lenovo Z510 Ubuntu Disk Partition I have Lenovo z510 laptop and i want to install Ubuntu but i need your suggestions.\nI have 8 GB ssd and 1Tb hard disk.\nHow can i divide to the disk?\nActually, i want to learn about size of partition for example:\nSda1 300 GB,\nSda2 500 GB. and swap area? Also there are ext4,ext3 and ext2 as i understand difference is that ext4 is the newest so should i choose as ext4?\nHow should be order of partitions. By the way,\nMy situation is a little bit different. My computer came without operating system for a while i used Windows 8 than i decided to use free and open source operating system. Also i want to develop Java and PHP applications. Than i installed Ubuntu but My Home gave error because of inadequate disk space. So I wanted to ask ideal disk space of partition size. I lost Windows if i want to install windows 8.1 beside of Ubuntu what should i do. And if i want to backup where should i reserve.\nThank you for your advices.\n\nA: *\n\n*The 8gb ssd is only used to speed up the boot process. It cannot be used separately. Don't touch it.\n\n*Your computer comes preinstalled with Windows 8.1 which takes all the disk space.  You can use use a GParted Live CD or the Windows disk management console to make some free space to install Ububntu.\nPlease take both points above in mind or you might loose your Windows 8.1!\n\n\n*Ideally there are 3 partitions needed to install Linux: BOOT, SWAP, ROOT. The SDA1 and SDA2 you see are partitions currently present on your laptop. First you have to define the boot volume in GB. Set it identical to your RAM size. Set the swap space to double of that your RAM. Both the SWAP space and BOOT space will be used by Ubuntu itself, not by you.  For a 100GB hard drive space on your computer, Boot space should be 8GB, swap space 16GB, Root space 76GB.\n\n*While you install on SDA1 or SDA2 just ensure that you have chosen the free disk space saved for Ubuntu in step 1! You will not be able to use this space in Windows. If you use the windows disk console, make a separate partition say of 100 gb. Don't use that space and don't even format it. That way, while installing Ubuntu you can easily identify the space as it will be mentioned as free space/unpartitioned.\nSelect that partition. Only use that partition and verify twice! \nNow define your BOOT, SWAP, ROOT partitions for Ubuntu as mentioned above.\nDon't worry your windows will be safe as there will be dual boot.\nFor more information on dual boot see the link :\nHow to make a Lenovo Ideapad Z510 as dual boot?\n", "Q: Run interpreted commands within sudo The question is how to run generic commands which may contain ; && | <  > << >> $ and so on within sudo.\nPossible solutions could be:\n\n\n*\n\n*To use interpreters within sudo\n\n\nsudo /bin/bash -c 'command ; command | ...'\nor\nsudo -s <<< 'command ; command | ...'\nBut I don't have sudoer /bin/bash /bin/sh or any other permissions. So that gets me permission denied.\n\n\n*I could also use something like this:\n\n\nsudo command ; sudo command\nBut the problem is that i need a solution working for any command given as an argument to my function (see context)\nSome context:\nI'm writing a python Popen wrapper which has a flag sudo=True/False. If sudo is true It should run any given command string within sudo (meaning the commands can contain ;| <> &&)\n\nA: Perhaps writing the commands to a shell script, making it executable and running it with sudo will do what you need.\nHowever what you are doing is very dangerous. Allowing potentially untrusted command line to be executed as a root is a disaster waiting to happen. Look up \"shell injection\" type of vulnerabilities. Then perhaps consider reviewing what needs to be done and then redesigning it without the need to run any command as sudo.\n", "Q: apache2 on ubuntu 14 - localhost works but ip doesn't I've just installed apache2 on my box, along with php5.\nI can navigate to \"localhost\" and it works.

I don't see this in the registry at all - how are you getting the DNS?\nDoes your apache configuration file have the ServerName specified in the VirtualHost setup in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled? \nWhat sort of system is this hosted on? I've seen situations with certain routers where you couldn't access a local site from the local machine using the external public ip (for example, Comcast's router).\nEDIT:   Also, when you make changes to your configuration, as suggested by people who may or may not have a clue about what they are suggesting, and the change does not solve your problem, do you go back and undo the change to restore the original configuration?  You should either do that, or keep very good records about all the changes you've made. \n\nA: If you are using a VM, just try restarting it!!\nI had the exact same problem with the same configurations you had in a fresh install of Ubuntu. localhost was working but nothing else. A restart solved it for me.\n", "Q: Where are bluetooth link keys stored in Ubuntu 14.10? I am trying to set specific bluetooth link keys for a device in Ubuntu 14.10 but I am unable to find where they are stored.\nThe purpose is to have a bluetooth mouse working in both Ubuntu and Windows without having to re-pair it after switching operating systems.\nAll the answers I found on AskUbuntu state that the keys are stored in /var/lib/bluetooth/<mac_address>/linkkeys and this used to be the case at least until 13.10, but in 14.10 this file is missing from a clean desktop install and creating it manually has no effect, it is ignored by bluetoothd.\nEDIT: It seems that the mouse doesn't issue a pairing request and the link keys aren't stored in this case. However, connecting the mouse in Windows and then rebooting in Ubuntu causes the bluetooth connection to fail (and the mouse needs to be removed and re-added to the bluetooth device list), so there's definitely some key exchange/authentication going on that prevents the mouse from being shared in both OS. The question remains, how can I force bluetoothd to save and use the saved link keys when connecting this mouse?\nHardware details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000\n\n*413c:8161 Dell Computer Corp. Wireless 365 Bluetooth (Broadcom BCM2046B1)\n\n\nThe two logs below show that for a pairable device (mobile phone) the keys are stored in the linkkeys file; this is not the case for the mouse. I know that older bluetoothd versions used to save the link keys for mice as well, because there are lots of answers/tutorials here on askubuntu and ubuntuforums about copying linkkeys from Windows to Ubuntu for the specific purpose of sharing a mouse between the two OS.\nHere is the bluetoothd log for the mouse discovery and connection setup:\n    bluetoothd[15615]:

I still haven't found an answer to the initial question (I couldn't determine where the link keys are stored for this particular bluez/adapter/peripheral combination) but I did find out that bluez will read the linkkeys file, if present, and will use the keys in the file.\nSo even though the link keys might not be written to the file after pairing, it is possible to override those keys by manually adding them to the linkkeys file.\nIt is important that the key type is set correctly, otherwise the key will be ignored.\nFor reference, the key type that worked in my case is shown here: https://askubuntu.com/a/246791/352576\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.10 uses bluez 4.98, 14.04 and 14.10 uses 4.101\nBoth versions were compiled with the same option (--localstatedir=/var)\nI'm using 14.04 and the files are there and if I remove or add a device the /var/lib/bluetooth/(myadapteraddress)/linkkeys file is updated accordingly.\nI made a test on a 14.10 system, I added a BT device and the /var/lib/bluetooth/(adapteraddress)/linkkeys file was created\nMaybe you are using a newer version of bluez.\nSchema for new versions of bluez (5 onwards i think) :\n/var/lib/bluetooth/<adapter address>/<remote device address>/info\n\nIn the documentation of settings storage for the new bluez version, I found this:\nhttp://git.kernel.org/cgit/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc/settings-storage.txt\n...\nStorage directory structure\n\nThere is one directory per adapter, named by its Bluetooth address, which\ncontains:\n - a settings file for the local adapter\n - an attributes file containing attributes of supported LE services\n - a cache directory containing:\n    - one file per device, named by remote device address, which contains device name\n - one directory per remote device, named by remote device address, which contains:\n    - an info file\n- an attributes file containing attributes of remote LE services\n- a ccc file containing persistent Client Characteristic Configuration\n  (CCC) descriptor information for GATT characteristics\n\nSo the directory structure is:\n\n/var/lib/bluetooth/<adapter address>/\n\n    ./settings\n    ./attributes\n    ./cache/\n        ./<remote device address>\n        ./<remote device address>\n        ...\n    ./<remote device address>/\n        ./info\n        ./attributes\n        ./ccc\n    ./<remote device address>/\n        ./info\n        ./attributes\n    ...\n\n...\nInfo file format\n\n...\n[LinkKey] group contains:\n\n  Key           String      Key in hexadecimal format\n\n  Type          Integer     Type of link key\n\n  PINLength     Integer     Length of PIN\n\n...\nIn any case seems that bluez should storage the files in /var/lib/bluetooth\nIf you use this command\nbluetoothd --version\n\nyou get 4.101?\n\nA: /var/lib/bluetooth/{bluetoothaddr}/linkkeys\nWhere {bluetoothaddr} is your bluetooth interface (you should have only one, it looks like a mac address)\nThe file format is {remoteaddr} {128 bit link key} {type}. \n20:12:03:22:EE:0E C21D3A69DEA0A8C629F1BB5D12AEEA79 4 0\n00:18:94:68:3E:90 EC02519ED656DB87B7F152E899F8A810 0 4\n00:21:3F:3E:2E:6C 948A0EF91FA8E9EB9032CE775BF8E0B0 0 4\n\n\nA: In Debian Jessie & I assume Ubuntu as well you can manually set the PIN to use. \n\n\n*\n\n*Do what this post https://askubuntu.com/a/246791/352576 describes to get your windows key. \n\n*your /var/lib/bluetooth/XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:AA (where XX: ... :AA is the mac of your PC's BT adapter) should contain a dir with the mac of your BT mouse/keyboard (I'll represent it as XX: ... :BF, and files config, & settings.\n\n*within XX: ...

How I can install Internet Download Manager on Ubuntu 14.04 ? anyone help me \n\nA: ...I'm going to show you how to use latest version of IDM in any linux OS, yes you heard it right \"latest version of IDM\".\nTill wine 1.7.4x, it only supported an older version of IDM which was IDM 5.05, It was functional but *** version when we look at newer versions of IDM with added new features.   \nSo just follow this step by step guide to get your IDM working.\nSo I have divided this Post in 3 parts:\nInstalling \"Internet Download Manager\"\nIntegrating IDM with Firefox.\nMake IDM look Good.\n\nInstalling \"Internet Download Manager\"\nAs you know IDM is a window's application. So to run IDM on linux we need something that supports Windows apps in linux. Wine (Wine is not an emulator) is a free and open source compatibility layer software application that aims to allow applications designed for Microsoft Windows to run on Unix-like operating systems.\nTo install wine run following commands: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa    \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine1.7 winetricks\n\nNote:- Make sure the Wine version installed is atleast 1.7.44. Because the older version of wine even 1.7.43 may not support latest version of IDM.\nAfter you are finished with installing wine, you need to install IDM. Get latest version of IDM from internetdownloadmanager.com\nOpen the downloaded setup file with \"Wine Windows Program Loader\" and follow instructions. after installing IDM it will look as shown in screenshot below:\n\nAlrighty you have installed IDM but it doesn't look good. does it??. Don't worry we will handle this look thing just after we will be done with Firefox integration Part.\nIntegrating IDM with Firefox Web Browser.\nDownloader's integration with Web Browsers is a must thing. Copying links from Browsers and pasting them in Download Managers would be a stupid thing to do. So let us integrate IDM with Mozilla Firefox.  \nTo integrate with Firefox we need an Extension named Flashgot. Flashgot is an Extension that allows you to download all links with your favourite Downloader with a single click.\nTo install Flashgot goto Tools>Add-ons and type flashgot in searchbox and install FlashGot Mass Downloader x.x.x.xx.      \n\nNext thing we need to do is to enable Wine Apps for FlashGot in order to use IDM. To do this type about:config in Firefox address bar and search for \"wine\". Now Toggle the value of Flashgot.useWine to true.  \n\nNow goto Extentions and edit flashgot preferences. Under General Tab In Download Manager select \"Internet Download Manager\" and under Download tab Select \"Intercept all Downloads\". Click OK.\n\nCongratulations you have completed the IDM installation with full firefox integration.\nMake IDM look Good and Verifying IDM Setup:-\nThis part is pretty easy. Just follow some simple steps:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Download Luna theme for wine and extract the downloaded file. (if\nthis file is downloaded with IDM then our configuration is done\nproperly and IDM Setup is also verified).\n\n*Open \"Configure Wine\" from launcher . Go to \"Desktop Integration\" tab\nand hit install button and select your theme with \".msstyles\"\nextension.\n\n*Now from drop down list select VistaPerfectionX4 and hit apply.\nYou can see how IDM will look after applying this theme:\n\n\nSource : http://amittoor.blogspot.de/2015/07/how-to-run-any-version-of-internet.html\n\nA: Ubuntu and linux has a few. For firefox there is the Down Them All extension (search for on firefox).\nFor linux you have aria2, uget, and steadyflow just to name a few. \nIf you like the command-line, I really recommend aria2, it's awesome fast. To install, open a terminal and type the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install aria2\n\nTo run aria2 from the terminal use the commands like this example similar to wget:\naria2c http://exampledownloadurl.com/file.txt\n\nReplace \"http://exampledownloadurl.com/file.txt\" with the URL of the file you want to download.\nTo install the GUI download managers use the following command to install:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install uget steadyflow\n\nThis will install all both uget and steadyflow or you can install one at a time if you want to try each of them out. \nclick for more info:\nuget\ntop-4-linux-download-managers \n\nA: As a complement to the other answer: IDM can be installed in Playonlinux too (I find it much easier to try different Wine versions; in my case 6.23 version of IDM with Wine 1.8 didn't work outside Playonlinux, but there it worked with Wine 1.9). Tested in Ubuntu 16.04.\nTo get Flashgot integration with IDM installed through Playonlinux, following this tutorial:\nAfter installing Flashgot and IDM, closing IDM and, in about:config in Firefox,  setting Flashgot.useWine totrue, as indicated in the other answer, open Flashgot settings, and, under General tab, add IDM. For the executable path select /usr/share/playonlinux/playonlinux; under Command line arguments template add the following: --run IDM %F /d [URL].\n\nIn the tutorial linked above it says to use --run IDMAN %F /d [URL]. This seems to depend on the version of IDM, as in the tutorial version 5.0.5 is discussed, while I used 6.23. To see what the correct line is, first create a desktop launcher for IDM in Playonlinux (Configure, General tab, select virtual drive, Make a new shortcut...), open that launcher in a text editor ans see what the Exec line says (in my case it was --run \"IDM\" %F). Select IDM under the Flashgot tab, restart the browser and it should work.\nOn Firefox-Flashgot compatibility:\nNewer versions of Firefox (\"Quantum\") are not yet supported by the Flashgot addon (it seems that they will be in the future - see this and this). Meanwhile, use Firefox ESR for this purpose, or Pale Moon browser.\n\nuGet for Linux is a real alternative.\nAccording to this answer that I was able to test, now there is a the updated version of uGet with multiple connections using both curl and area2. \n(The official Ubuntu version is very outdated.)\nAlthough people seem to praise aria2 before curl, using curl multiple connections in uGet it is for the first time in Linux (maybe excepting Flareget, now very limited in the free version) that I have seen download speeds pushed up in the same way IDM does it in Windows (and that I feel I do not need IDM in Linux). \nsudo apt-get install curl aria2\n\nThen install uGet downloaded from their website. Even the previous version had multi-thread for aria2, but I had better experience with curl in uGet, so I would say try the latest.\nThe main graphical difference from IDM is that you don't see the progress bars for multiple connections. But knowing your maximum speed you can verify that it's pushing it up.\nOne has to consider also the fact that uGet is free, unlike IDM and Flareget. If you don't mind commercial version, Flareget is an option; but except some more flashy things in the GUI, including those progress bars,  it doesn't provide more.\n\nA: I'm using pyLoad. Its a python server which provides an android app and a webinterface for inserting links to download. From YouTube it even can parse playlists.\n", "Q: Speech to text software for notes Is there any software for speech to text ? I want to make random notes.\nFrom searching i can only find the opposite, text to speech.\nThanks.\nEDIT:\nThe question which has been linked to mark this as a duplicate suggests Simon as the solution. However, Simon has not had a release in more than one year and is quite buggy and unusable in newer releases of Ubuntu. Therefore, alternatives must be sought, requiring newer answers to this question.\n\nA: A single search of apt-cache search speech to text returned a program called \"Julius\":\nDescription of the package julius:\nspeech recognition engine\n Julius is a high-performance, two-pass large vocabulary continuous\n speech recognition (LVCSR) engine.\n .\n It supports N-gram based dictation, DFA grammar based parsing, and\n one-pass isolated word recognition. Phone context dependencies are\n supported up to triphone. It can perform a multi-model decoding, a\n recognition using several LMs and AMs simultaneously with a single\n processor, and also supports \"hot plugging\" of arbitrary modules at\n run time.\n .\n This package contains the executable applications, a set of tools\n useful to build recognition grammar and some examples (like a\n script to use Julius to execute some predetermined commands).\n\nInstallation: sudo apt-get install julius\n", "Q: Limit apt repo to a certain arch? I have several repositories that don't have armhf binaries (for RPi cross-compiler), so apt-get always gives me a ton of 404 errors on updating package lists. It also prevents me from running do-release-upgrade as it can't find armhf compiled system binaries, that it doesn't need and can't run anyways.\nI'm looking for a way to tell it to only search for specific arches in certain repositories so I can fix the massive wall of 404s on apt-get update. Google was no help; so as far as I know this isn't a dupe; and the one question that was possibly related was about GPG errors, of which I have none.\nsources.list:\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release amd64 (20131016.1)]/ saucy main restricted\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release amd64 (20131016.1)]/ saucy main restricted\n\n# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to\n# newer versions of the distribution.\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main restricted i386 amd64\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main restricted amd64 i386\n\n## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the\n## distribution.\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-updates main restricted amd64 i386\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-updates main restricted amd64 i386\n\n## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu\n## team.

They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\ndkpg arches: i386, amd64, armhf\nI'm using an ARM cross compiler as Raspberry Pi is very slow to compile larger things, and crashes on some huge ones, even with a 4GB swapfile on an external drive.\n\nA: From man sources.list:\nThe format for a sources.list entry using the deb and deb-src types is:\n\n   deb [ options ] uri suite [component1] [component2] [...]\n... \noptions is always optional and needs to be surrounded by square\nbrackets. It can consist of multiple settings in the form\nsetting=value. Multiple settings are separated by spaces. The following\nsettings are supported by APT (note however that unsupported settings\nwill be ignored silently):\n\n·   arch=arch1,arch2,...  can be used to specify for which\n    architectures information should be downloaded. If this option is\n    not set all architectures defined by the APT::Architectures option\n    will be downloaded. \n\n·   arch+=arch1,arch2,...  and arch-=arch1,arch2,...  which can be used\n    to add/remove architectures from the set which will be downloaded.       \n...\nThe first line gets package information for the architectures in\nAPT::Architectures while the second always retrieves amd64 and armel.\n\n       deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy main\n       deb [ arch=amd64,armel ] http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy main\n\nSo try something like:\ndeb [ arch=armhf ] http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ wheezy main contrib non-free rpi armhf\n\n", "Q: Some Wi-Fi connections are very slow, but internet is good I use dual-boot between Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04. Everything runs smooth except one problem: The Wi-Fi doesn't always work well. \nI can connect with different Wi-Fi networks, but some networks are very slow (13MB/s) and my browser says I'm not connected to the Internet. \nWhen I ping an IP adress, it responds very fast. I have a broadcom BCM3413. I already updated the drivers. Can someone help me?\nThanks!\n\nA: First of all: 13MB/s is considered quite fast. (13312KB/s???)\nSecondly follow carefully and fully this answer.\n", "Q: Include Ubuntu Font in Game Am I allowed to include the (unmodified) Ubuntu font in my game and distribute it together?\nThe situation is, that I like the font, but because the game is written in python, it also runs under windows and there nobody has this font installed. I would put it in a resources folder as I downloaded it (with license, and so on).\nThanks for your response :)\n\nA: From  http://font.ubuntu.com/about/:\n\nBoth the final font Truetype/OpenType files and the design files used to produce the font family are distributed under an open licence and you are expressly encouraged to experiment, modify, share and improve. The typeface is sans-serif, uses OpenType features and is manually hinted for clarity on desktop and mobile computing screens.\n\nNext step: consult a lawyer about the licence and what it allows.\n", "Q: ubuntu software center can't open When I was trying to update program and systme by Ubuntu softwar Center. Internet cut off and now I can not download any software to download Ubuntu Center and can not install  through Terminal? what can i do?\n\nA: It may happen some files are corrupted. \nIn this case I would try the standard remedy: sudo apt-get update\nIt helps in 75% of problems.\n", "Q: How can I open a *.gt file? Hi guys I was trying to open some files that the teacher sent as tests but they are in an extension that I can't find a way to open, *.gt. They are to be used inside a .py file for the test. I would really appreciate your help.\n\nA: Open it with gedit. When it is a binary file you should ask your teacher. When not you should see the content, more or less helpful.\n", "Q: Dell inspiron 14R has no network after kubuntu installation I've just installd the LTS version of Kubuntu, and i can't connect to any network, wired OR wireless..\nMost of the answers i've seen here assumed there's only a problem with the wireless, so i'm kinda stuck. i've tried installing \"compat-wireless-2012-07-03-p.tar.bz2\" and following the steps to install it but the problem persists,\nI've got a dell inspiron 14R 5420, dual boot with win7, in which everything works fine.\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: Are your drivers for the network cards loading? A quick check might be to mouse over your network  notification area or try to manually connect to a network (I'm not terribly familiar with KDE). Running lspci -vv might net you some information about the cards and what driver they are using , if they are using one.\n", "Q: Cannot Login after Fresh install of ubuntu 14.04.1 I just installed 14.04.1 on a desktop computer. Everything installed just as usual, but my user account does not show up when the new system starts. All I have is a guest session!\nWhen I try to login to my account from a command prompt using CNTRL-ALT-F2, my username and password are accepted but the screen just flashes a brief message and returns immediately to the login prompt. The message is far too quick to see.\nThe guest session works fine, but I have no administration privileges on my machine!\nWhere did I go wrong?\n\nA: I am not expert yet.\nThe fastest way to solve the problem is to logging in as root user. The second alternative is by creating a new account and activating the sudo mechanism.\nPlease take a look further in:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\n\nA: If you have a bootable disk, (eg the installation media), you could try using that to add a user to the local system. Not sure if it's different on Ubuntu but if you add a new user to the system by editing one into the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and /etc/group files you may be able to log in. If it's a new install you may not be able to log in as root since root has no password on a fresh Ubuntu installation.

I also like having fixed IP addresses for every device on my network, so I fix the IP configuration for its Ethernet adapter, and use the same IP as well for the TAP device when connected to the VPN (using a client configuration directory on the server side).\nIs there a good and minimally hack-ish way to configure the OpenVPN service on my laptop to only connect to OpenVPN when the Ethernet connection is not active? Having the OpenVPN service running in the background automatically is super-convenient and I don't want to manually have to shut it off every time I connect to Ethernet, but having it trying to connect to the same network I'm already physically on via VPN using the same IP address I'm already using is obviously not a good idea...\nI'm sure I could hack something together with init scripts, but I'd like to minimize my divergence from the official Ubuntu configuration as much as possible. I'd really appreciate if it anyone could think of a more \"proper\" approach.\n\nA: I played around a found a solution that happens to work for my configuration. It's not a fully general solution, so hopefully someone can come along and give a solution that's more robust.\nInstead of disabling OpenVPN on my laptop when on Ethernet, I just configured ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) on my network's OpenVPN server to reject connections from the local subnet; it's a teeny bit more complicated than just creating rules using sudo ufw allow ... and sudo ufw deny ..., though:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, if you're running ufw on a machine bridging a VPN to a local network (which I am doing), you need to configure ufw to allow forwarding traffic, since it drops that by default. This means changing DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=\"DROP\" to DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=\"ACCEPT\" in /etc/default/ufw.\n\n*Second, you need to make sure to add rules in the right order; ufw processes rules one by one and uses the one that you reject connections to OpenVPN (port 1149) within your subnet before allowing them from outside only if you create them in that order; in my case, this meant running sudo ufw delete deny from 192.168.16.0/20 to any port 1194 (no, that's not a typo, I actually use a /20 subnet locally :D) before running sudo ufw allow 1194.\n\n*Lastly, you need to make sure that connections from your local network actually do look like they come from your local network so the ufw rule gets invoked.\nThe last part is important because initially that was not the case when I tried the first two steps; my laptop OpenVPN is automatically set up to try to connect to my VPN at mydomainname.com, which is dynamically assigned to my home router, which in turn forwards port 1194 it to the computer running my VPN at 192.168.16.1. This might not be the case for all routers, but for my router at least, connecting to mydomainname.com from within the local subnet creates a connection to the OpenVPN server that looks like it has the router's IP address, rather than the laptop's. (And it's a long story but I actually want to allow VPN access from other devices connected to the router, on a different subnet--I have a pretty complicated home setup :D).\nThe solution in my case ended up being to configure my router's DNS server with a static assignment from mydomainname.com to 192.168.16.1, so that mydomainname.com resolves directly to 192.168.16.1 but to my router's external IP otherwise. This works for me, but your mileage may vary.\n", "Q: What is the exact command name to invoke an apt-get install downloaded package?

I have ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64 operating system installed on my desktop computer. it is a clean installation. i have a USB 3.5 floppy drive. I need to format a floppy disk with the ext2 file-system. what do I need to do if i have the ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64 operating system up and running now? I need to be able to use the formatted floppy disk in a subsequent re-installation of ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64 operating system. The installation part of the operating system has to be able to identify the formatted floppy as \"/dev/fd0\" so that it is able to load GRUB on to the floppy.\n\nA: For a pretty graphical way to do it, install/use gparted or even gnome-disk-utility (\"Disks\"). I strongly prefer gparted, gives more options and tells you more details on what it does, Disks may work, but seems more like a black-box \"click and hope\" solution.\nOr, you can use the terminal tools yourself, using mkfs.ext2 (alias to mke2fs). If your floppy drive is /dev/fd0 then this command should make an ext2 filesystem on the floppy drive, using ext2 and automagically figuring out the other parameters (see man mke2fs for all the options). This would use the whole floppy disk with no partitioning, probably the same as gparted would do, I'm not sure.\nmkfs.ext2 -t ext2 /dev/fd0\n\nMaking the disk bootable / setting bootable flag isn't an ext option, I always use gparted to do that, or even gnome disks, but you can use the terminal program fdisk like fdisk /dev/fd0 and then the a command to toggle the bootable flag (may need to add 1 for the 1st partition), then w for write.\nOr if your floppy drive isn't /dev/fd0 then you could try lsblk or maybe blkid and see if it's listed, or after you plug it in check the logfiles and it should be listed in there somewhere (use dmesg or browse through /var/log/syslog and it should have some info. I think /dev/fd0 is the standard name for floppy drives, but with a usb floppy drive it could be different, I suppose you could try linking /dev/fd0 to whatever name the usb floppy drive is called if it's different, but I've never tried to needed to try that.\nAnd installing grub to a floppy disk should work, though a cd/dvd/usb would be big enough for a whole ubuntu live iso, and might be easier.

Then click install windows. backup your data before you install windows.\n\nA: Unfortunately, unetbootin does not support Windows ISOs.\nTo create a bootable Windows USB from Ubuntu, you need to use winusb.\nRun the below commands on terminal to install WinUSB.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:colingille/freshlight\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install winusb\n\n", "Q: Juju Backup Failing Juju version 1.20.11-utopic-amd64 fails on backup, as per Juju documentation - Backup and Restore of the Juju State-Server:\n$ juju backups create\nERROR unrecognized command: juju backups\n$  juju --version\n1.20.11-utopic-amd64\n\nIn fact \"juju help commands\" does not list backups as an option.

If the miners are off then switch them on using:\ntracker control -s\n\n\nA: Check if it's tracking the correct folder by installing the Search & Index tools. You can use the Software Centre, or with this command:\n$ sudo apt-get install tracker-gui tracker-utils\n\nAdditionally, I'd recommend telling Tracker not to look at the Videos and Downloads directory, and filter out '*.jpg' files.

Is there a plug in (for transmission) that will save my \"wanted\" list and look for my movies automatically?\nAnd notify me when I can download it ?\n\nA: I use flexget for downloading automatically. Mostly series so I use it daily. You can filter on quality, subgroup and many many more. It even has IMDB filtering. \n\nDaemon Mode\nYou can now run FlexGet in daemon mode, and handle scheduling directly in your FlexGet config. Traditional cron scheduling is also supported. \nTorrent clients\nIntegrates with Deluge, transmission, and uTorrent directly, and other clients like rTorrent via watchdirs.\nMovies\nInternal movie queue. Automatic searching. Grab all movies which match predefined imdb and/or rotten tomatoes rules (score, year, etc).\n\n\nDownside: it uses a text file you need to create and maintain so you will need to know upfront the movie name if you want to creaste a list of future downloads. Example from the link:\ntasks:\n  task name:\n    rss: http://example.com/torrents.xml\n    series:\n      - pioneer one\n      - some series\n    download: ~/torrents/series/\n\nThis would downloade new episodes of serie \"pioneer one\" and \"some series\" the moment the torrent is active on \"http://example.com/torrents.xml\" and it will download the file to \"~/torrents/series/\". A configuration can become very complex and very large rather quickly.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Cookbook and Configuration examples.\n\n*Plugins\n\nA: It just happens that I've made an easy to use Python application for downloading YIFY movies (only), either the ones already available, or the ones that you are expecting to be available soon.\nThe application can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/hakermania/autoYIFY/ . You can click the 'Download ZIP' button on the right to download it.\nOn the above page you can find a pretty good documentation about it, but I will break down the main things here (I suggest reading the documentation though because it keeps it simple and clear and shows all the available potentially useful options):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the dependencies:\nsudo apt-get install python-bs4\n\n*Make the program executable and run it once to let it create the configuration files. Terminate it with Ctrl+C after it complains about having no movies to search for.\nchmod +x autoYIFY.py; ./autoYIFY.py\n\n*Make the program accessible by typing just the command yify. There are multiple ways of doing this, I prefer creating a soft link:\nsudo ln -s /home/alex/Documents/Scripts/autoYIFY.py /usr/bin/yify\nBefore running the above command, change the autoYIFY.py path to the permanent path of your autoYIFY.py script.\n\n\n*Set the configuration options in the file ~/.autoYIFY/settings\nThere are some options that you can set, like check-interval which is the interval between each check for movie availability. More options can be found on the documentation, on the link I posted above.\n\n\n*Use the program.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download movie right now:\n\n\nyify 'Movie Name'\n\n\n*\n\n*Download subtitle right now:\n\n\nyify sub 'language name' 'Movie Name'\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for movies to become available:\n\n\nyify\nNotice that you run it without any arguments. You just have to list your movies (one per line) at ~/.autoYIFY/loop-movies, then you just run it and it will wait until they become available. Once a movie becomes available, it will be automatically removed from ~/.autoYIFY/loop-movies (and launched in your torrent client).\nI suggest you put the yify command at the startup so as you don't have to worry about starting it each time you open your computer.\n\nA: Take a look at couchpotato for movies (and sickbeard for series).\n\n\n*\n\n*It support torrents via various search engines, but also newsgroups. \n\n*It supports various download actions, you can choose your downloader (e.g. by putting the file in a certain directory)\n\n*for series, sickbeard can 'follow' your seasons\n\n*it has post-download options to move, rename etc. \n\n\nA: Integrated with Transmission, no, at least nothing that you can obtain OOTB. You can set up a RSS client that downloads torrents into a directory and make Transmission to load automatically all torrents in such directory, like the transmission-rss project do. That's the only way of using Transmission + something lightweight.\nA more integrated solution is using instead Deluge and YaRSS2 plugin.\n", "Q: Problem with partition (Ubuntu) I created bootable USB Windows for my UBUNTU but when i installed it, it says:\n\"Windows Setup Cannot find a location to store temporary installation files.

They don't actually exist on your harddrive, but are instead transparently created at boot time. There are quite a few of them, the ones you ran into: /dev, /run, and /sys, and a few more, such as /proc. \nThey are used primarily for providing the OS access to kernel-ly things such as block devices such as your harddrive (/dev), run time sockets/configs/etc (/run), hardware features such as a battery or display backlight and kernel features such as cgroups (/sys), and information on running processes (/proc).\n", "Q: modify another user's password entry with sudo power what are the sequence of commands to modify another user's password entry with sudo power in ubuntu?\nI like to change the other user's pass in ubuntu with sudo power?\n\nA: Just type sudo passwd username to change username's password.\n", "Q: Executing a script when inserting a flash drive How can I write a script that fires on an event?\nWhen I insert an USB flash drive, Ubuntu mounts it and automatically opens Nautilus.\nWhen this happens with a specific flash drive, I'd like to open a second tab with a determinate folder.\nI don't think it can be done with a Nautilus script, but how can I do it with a Linux script or a Nautilus extension?\n\nA: If you run the script below in the background, it checks for mounted volumes. If one of your defined drives is mounted, it automatically opens the set folder in nautilus.\nA minor problem was that nautilus does not support opening a directory in a new tab from command line, only in a new window. That means that the initial window, that appears if you insert a usb drive, has to be gracefully closed. The script uses wmctrl to do that, at the same moment that your chosen folder will open. \nYou might need to install it first:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n#--\ndrivename_folders = [(\"My Passport\", \"docs\"), (\"7827-2F8C\", \"sanel\")]\n#--\n\ndef get_mountedlist():\n    return [item[item.find(\"/\"):] for item in subprocess.check_output(\n            [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"lsblk\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split(\"\\n\") if \"/\" in item]\n\ndone = []\n\nwhile True:\n    mounted = get_mountedlist()\n    new_paths = [dev for dev in mounted if not dev in done]\n    valid = sum([[(drive, drive+\"/\"+item[1], item[0]) for drive in new_paths \\\n                  if item[0] in drive] for item in drivename_folders], [])\n\n    for item in valid:\n        open_window = \"nautilus  \"+\"'\"+item[1]+\"'\"\n        close_window = \"wmctrl -c  \"+\"'\"+item[2]+\"'\"\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", open_window])\n        time.sleep(1)\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", close_window])\n\n    done = mounted\n    time.sleep(2)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file\n\n*Set your drives and folders\nIn the head section of the script, change the line:\ndrivename_folders = [(\"My Passport\", \"docs\"), (\"7827-2F8C\", \"MyFolder\")]\n\nwhere every tuple represents a drive(name), and the folder inside the drive that has to be opened. I left my \"test\" -names as an example.\nIf you are not sure about the exact name of your drive, run lsblk to see the name (without the preceding path to the mountpoint)\n\n*Save the script\nSave the script as open_folder.py and run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/open_folder.py\n\nIf all works as you expected, add it to your Startup Applications\nHow it works\n\n\n*\n\n*Every two seconds, the script runs the lsblk command to check for all mounted volumes.\n\n*If it finds one or more newly mounted volume name(s), it checks if the name is in the list of volumes that you set to be opened in a specific way (opening a sub directory)\n\n*The script opens the sub directory of the volume that you defined, and closes the (drive's root-) window that was automatically opened on connecting the drive.\n\n*To prevent repeatedly opening the folders, the volume then is added to the \"done\" list, until the volume is unmounted.\n\n\nOther file managers\nI tested it on pcmanfm (Lubuntu) and thunar (Xubuntu) and, as expected, in both cases, it workes fine. \nIf you want to use it on either Lubuntu or Xubuntu, change the line:\nopen_window = \"nautilus  \"+\"'\"+item[1]+\"'\"\n\nto:\nopen_window = \"thunar \"+\"'\"+item[1]+\"'\"\n(for Xubuntu)\n\nor \nopen_window = \"pcmanfm \"+\"'\"+item[1]+\"'\"\n(for Lubuntu, also disable in pcmanfm's preferences: Media > \"Show available options for removable media\")\n\nOf course, make sure wmctrl is installed\nMost likely, it will work on other file managers as well.\n\nGeneralized version of the script\nThe version of the script above is specifically for one situation. To be able to use the script in a broader range of purposes (to run any command when a specific drive gets connected, making backups of it for example) the version below could be useful.\nIn this case, in the head section of the script, the tuples represent:\n drivename_folders = [(<drivename_a>, <command_a>), (<drivename_b>, <command_b>)]\n\nsee the \"test\" setting in the script below.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n#--\ndrivename_command = [(\"My Passport\", \"gnome-terminal\"), (\"F806-0C50\", \"gedit\")]\n#--\n\ndef get_mountedlist():\n    return [item[item.find(\"/\"):] for item in subprocess.check_output(\n            [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"lsblk\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split(\"\\n\") if \"/\" in item]\n\ndone = []\n\nwhile True:\n    mounted = get_mountedlist()\n    newly_mounted = [dev for dev in mounted if not dev in done]\n    valid = sum([[(drive, item[1]) for drive in newly_mounted \\\n                  if item[0] in drive] for item in drivename_command], [])\n    for item in valid:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", item[1]])\n    done = mounted\n    time.sleep(2)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file\n\n*Set your drives and commands\n\n*Save the script\nSave the script as drive_run.py and run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/drive_run.py\n\nIf all works as you expected, add it to your Startup Applications\n", "Q: mysql-workbench and Gnome keyring daemon problem when launching mysql-workbench I have the following warning:\n[12:13:49] coil@coil:~$ sudo mysql-workbench &\n[12:14:03] coil@coil:~$ ** Message: Gnome keyring daemon seems to not be available.

To check whether this is true, check the kernel message buffer with sudo dmesg and look for signs such as Volume was not properly unmounted. Some data may be corrupted. Please run fsck or Input/Output error, and most importantly, Filesystem has been set read-only. If this is the case, it may be likely that there is not save (i.e. your drive is dying), however you could try the below to squeeze some life back out of it (it may not work though).\nI had this problem once with a dying SD card of mine. You could try creating an entirely new partition table (not just reformat) and then reformat. \nTo create an entirely new partition table (this will destroy all data on the drive), run fdisk /dev/path/to/device (you want the device itself and not an individual partition -- in your case it would look something like like fdisk /dev/sdc and NOT /dev/sdc1). \nAt the fdisk prompt,\n\n\n*\n\n*type o for new partition table, then \n\n*n for new partition (and accept all the defaults),\n\n*t then c to change partition type to one suitable for a FAT filesystem\n\n*then w to write changes to disk\n\n\nAt this point you should have a device with a new partition (something like /dev/sdc1: you can check with lsblk. Try and format that partition. Best of luck.\n", "Q: Using `sudo apt-get clean` & `autoremove` killed my laptop! I found somewhere here in the forum that I could use the commands sudo apt-get clean and sudo apt-get autoremove to get rid of things I don´t use and my laptop does not need.\nWhy is it that every time I use either of these commands Ubuntu starts acting up?\nBy \"acting up\" I mean that:\n\n\n*\n\n*All hot corner functions and Window Snapping functions on my desktop stop working. After entering either of the two commands, the corners I selected as Window Spread will not do/show anything.\n\n*The Unity icon on the launcher disappears.\n\n\nIn the end I solved things by reinstalling Ubuntu, Spotify, Skype, Chrome and so on... I don´t really mind. It is only an hour of my time, it is fun and I always learn something.\n\nA: There's a simple solution to this, stop using the commands that break your system. autoremove and clean shouldn't break the system but if they do, stop using them.\nYou wont save much disk space anyway, if you have problems with high disk usage, try removing some applications instead.\n\nA: apt-get clean just removes the package cache. There's no way* it could hurt anything.\napt-get autoremove removes packages that were automatically installed but now their dependent package has either been removed or no longer depends on them. If you remove a package that depends on things (eg ubuntu-desktop) and then do an autoremove, you're going to end up removing a lot of packages.\nThis is often done by removing something that a big metapackage depends on. If you look at apt-cache depends ubuntu-desktop you'll see a number of Depends: ... packages. If any of these are removed, Apt has to also remove the ubuntu-desktop package. That's dependency resolution in action. If you then run an autoremove, it'll clean up all those other depends (assuming nothing else depends on them).\nOccasionally you might end up in a situation where you want to install something but it conflicts with something ubuntu-desktop depends on. Apt may try to force this through by removing the conflict package (and therefore also ubuntu-desktop). It will warn you about this.\nThe simple fix is to find out which meta-package you're missing, and reinstall it. This is usually ubuntu-desktop. And in the future READ what apt-get tells you. I don't mean that in a nasty way. I wish I did more often. Upgrading to 14.04 I tanked my whole system back to a very basic command line and had to redownload and install over a gig of packages.\n* Life, uh… finds a way™\n", "Q: Is XFS a distributed file system or a journaling file system? Is XFS a distributed file system or a journaling file system?\nIn Wikipedia it says that XFS is a journaling file system, but in the Berkely website they mentioned that it is a serverless file system/Distributed file system.\nWhich one is true?\n\nA: It appears you may be confusing XFS (a journaling file system) with xFS which appears to be something entirely different. Case matters.......\n\nA: Both are true, because these are two different projects.\nYou should have noticed that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The latest xFS release was in 1997.\n\n*The Wikipedia article on XFS doesn't link there, but to other sites.

I am not finding a method to recovering a /boot partition that was overwritten by an identical /boot partition. This isn't your regular average grub installation problem. This is from hell.\nI have 2 systems, A and B. These 2 systems are identical in every way except for UUID's and several files that are particular to the respective systems (e.g., fstab, crypttab, etc). B was a backup of A and both systems were able to boot successfully at one point.\nNow B having its /boot overwritten %100 by A, B refuses to boot up and I've tried everything I could possibly come up with that should work (nothing works).\nI've --bind mounted /dev/ /dev/pts/ /sys/ /proc/ to a chrooted environment and chrooted into it and updated-grub, purged grub, reinstalled grub, removed kernels, updated kernels, ran update-initramfs -k all -c with other options and other stuff in all sorts of orders, even from scratch. I've ran grub-update from the host using the --directory option and I've even resorted to boot-repair and I've literally done this perhaps a hundred times for 6 hours.\nNothing will get the system back up.\nI know this has to be simpler and I'm just having the most terrible luck at figuring it out. What am I doing wrong? Both systems are encrypted using the whole disk encryption from installation.\nupdate it appears at the point during boot where I should be prompted for a password to unlock / the system hangs and then drops to an initramfs prompt. I have no idea and there is no help on how to unlock a cryptsetup disk. I don't have cryptsetup in initramfs :/\n\nA: I hope this helps anyone that may have come across the same situation. It turns out, after 8+ hours of trying to figure this out, I get some rest and come back and solve it in under 30 minutes. It turns out I was hot on the tail of the answer every time.\nFrom the host system, when I mount the encrypted disk for a backup, I do the following\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdd5 kub # a sneaky kind of wrong\n\nIt turns out, the name \"kub\" screws up everything. What name should it be? Why did I always use kub? The name should be what the encrypted disk name is in /etc/crypttab. I always used \"kub\" because it always worked for what I needed but it turns out, not when using update-initramfs on a chrooted system and trying to update-grub on it. The correct name in my /etc/crypttab turned out to be sdc5_crypt so\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdd5 sdc5_crypt # wow, the answer\n\nThen after unlocking the disk correctly and making the relevant mounts (/dev/ /sys/ /run/ /dev/pts/ /proc/) I ran the following\nsudo update-initramfs -k all -c\nsudo update-grub\n\nAnd the system became bootable. Wow \"kub\" is like calling someone named Jack, Bobby and Jack never bothers to correct you so you think you're right but it turns out Jack hates you for it.\n", "Q: Transfer or copy Gnome to Ubuntu 14.04 I was wondering if there is a way to import/clone/restore my gnome configuration from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04. \nBoth Ubuntu sit on two different HD installed in the same machine.\n\nA: This ishad to run off and double check what you where going to need to look for.\nYour personal gnome settings are located in 'hidden' directories in you home drive.\nThey are as follows:\n~/.gnome\n~/.gnome2\n~/.nautilus\n~/.gconf\nThe ~ indicates the users home drive.\nSo now you know where the settings are you have 2 options.\n\n\n*\n\n*If yo have a separate partition on one of your 2 drives you should migrate your home drive to it.\nThen on each of the versions you need to point the system to this part it on (read up on the config file /etc/fstab).\n\n*Copy the above files to alocation that is accessible from distros, and then create links to them from you home directory on each instance.\nThe first option is going to be better long term, as it will enable you to keep all your files and config intact between upgrades, and with your current setup you will be able to test o the new version to ensure that no 'essential' stuff is broken before you do a full migration.\nThe second method is good if you are using multiple versions of something, it will enable you to easily switch between old and new forms of acceptable config.

Logical volumes are easy to set up, remove and resize. Without the hassle that ordinary partitions have, like you have set up now.  I would also consider using quota systems in the file system instead of different partitions.

I tried google and searching this site, didn't get very good answers.\nI'm running 14.04.1 LTS. I have multiple 3.5\" internal drives in my system with very important data on them. I'm only using one of them for ubuntu. I installed ubuntu hoping I could use it to play and mess around, without worrying about hurting the rest of my system. \nIn windows you can go to device manager, right click an internal drive, and click disable. Is there an equivalent in Ubuntu? I want it so that nothing can access the drives in any way until I manually re-enable them.\nThanks!\n\nA: If the disks are SATA (the most normal thing; they are sda, sdb, etc.) you can do that two ways:\n\n*\n\n*After the boot, you can disable them. The \"magic\" is (as root)\n echo 1 > /sys/block/sdx/device/delete\n\nwhere sdx is your disk. This will make the device disappear. Notice however that if something triggers an update of udev the disks may reappear.\nNote also that the sdx denomination is not completely fixed; it can change especially if you add/delete disks to the system.\n\n\n*At boot level, if you have a kernel with version 3.13 or newer. You need to identify the ATA address, which is a number like 4.00 (you can use dmesg | grep \" ata\") :\n ata4.00: ATA-8: ST2000DM001-1CH164, CC24, max UDMA/133\n\nand you can completely hide the disk with the boot parameter:\n libata.force=4.00:disable\n\nthe disk will act as if it were not connected at all to the system.\n\n\n*Another option is using udev rules as explained (I did not test) here. The difference in this case is that the disk devices are still there, but the disks are not mounted. In 99% of the case the result is the same, unless you are playing tricks with directly writing to the raw disk devices...\n\nA: There's no integrated way that I know of (which needn't say anything, you can probably achieve this using udev rules). As a workaround, you could use something like this:\nls /dev | grep -P \"^sd[^a].?$\" | xargs -d\"\\n\" rm\n\nThis command first lists all device files, then picks the drives from there (every drive except sda, sda1, ..., e.g. sdb). Those device files are then removed and thus can't be mounted any longer. This needs to be run as root. However, all USB sticks mounted at that time will be thrown away, too. If this happens, just replug them.\nYou could set this to be run at system startup.\n", "Q: How to fix blank screen with mouse pointer on Ubuntu install reboot? I am trying to re-purpose my Dell Inspiron 8600 with Ubuntu 14.04 to be used as a low scale HTPC. \nHere is what I have done so far. \nI have created a live USB for installation.  I had to force pae to get the installation to work. \nThe entire installation process goes well and prompts me to reboot to finish installation. It reboots, I get to the login screen with the drums, it looks like the desktop is going to fire up and then the screen goes black and the only thing active is the mouse pointer. \nI can access the terminal through Ctrl+Alt+F1. I have tried several workarounds but I honestly don't really know what I am trying and if it is making any progress. Help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04 While you are in the black screen. You should do the following steps:\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F4, then login using your username and password. Enter the following commands:\nsudo apt purge gdm3\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\nsudo apt install gdm3\n\nIf it displays a warning, then choose gdm3 with arrow keys and press Enter.\nIf it didn't, then enter these two commands:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3\nsudo service gdm3 start\n\nThen restart from your Ubuntu login screen.\n\nA: It worked for me, try these steps:-\n\n\n*\n\n*From Grub menu select \"*Advanced options for Ubuntu\".\n\n*Select the 1st \"recovery mode\" option ,that you see on your screen.\n\n*After that you will be navigated to Recovery Menu options.\n\n*In that select the 3rd option i.e. \"dpkg Repair broken packages\". And then enter the \"Ok\" button.\n\n*Enter to \"Yes\" button.\n\n*Then you will be navigated to the booting screen with 2 options 1st is \"Continue [yN] and 2nd is Details [d].\n\n*Type y and hit enter.\n\n*Again hit Enter.\n\n*You will now navigated to Recovery Menu again and then select 1st option \"resume   Resume normal boot\". and hit \"Ok\" button.\n\n*Again hit \"Ok\" button.\nNow you will see your login screen with desktop background and everything works fine as it was before.\n\nA: *\n\n*Press ctrl+alt+F4\n\n*Login with your user name and password\n\n*use command: sudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n*Now use command sudo shutdown -r now  to restart the computer\n\n\nA: Try pressing CTRL+ALT+F4 and then type startx.\nThis is what solved it for me.\n\nA: Note: as commented by @asocia, you will need Internet connnection for this solution to work.\nSometimes your desktop may not load due to problem with lightdm.\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F4 then login using your username and password.

I finally tried doing a fresh install of 14.04, and my laptop's built-in monitor would not work unless I added the nomodeset option to /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"nomodeset\"\n\nThis allowed me to boot, but not change the resolution, nor recognize the external VGA monitor. After googling the problem, I learned that the appropriate driver for my  Mobile Intel® Graphics Media Accelerator X4500MHD seems to be i915 DRM. I also learned that nomodeset was likely preventing the display modes on my LVDS screen from being changed and the external VGA from being recognized because it was disabling KMS. So, I installed Intel Linux Graphics Installer 1.0.7, ran it, and after some trial and error changed the boot options in /etc/default/grub to say...\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"i915.modeset=1 i915.lvds_channel_mode=2 video=VGA-1:1280x1024Me video=LVDS-1:1024x768Me\"\n\nNow my system recognizes the external VGA just fine, but the built-in LVDS screen is black.

But I can't get the installer to even be recognized. \nhttps://github.com/lopaka/instructions/blob/master/ubuntu-14.10-install-asus-x205ta.md\nThank you.\n\nA: My Asus x200 will not boot when secure boot is enabled, but works just fine when secure boot is disabled.  UEFI mode otherwise works fine.  The other 'gotcha' is that the boot order is not persistent when the usb is removed.  The default order of hard disk first is reset, so you might have to play around with that too.  \n\nMy BIOS is American Megatrends version 203, GOP version 3.0.1023, EC version B14E150001\nDon't know anything about bitlocker.\nTo be more clear:  The specific USB needs to be plugged in as the UEFI settings are run and the bootorder changed to put it first.  The USB item in the boot order list is pretty specific to the USB, including brand and type.  Any boot without that specific USB will remove it from the bootorder.  \n\nA: Debian latest ISOs are working for this laptop now.

I plan to install soon, overwriting my copy of Windows. \nMy question\nWhilst booting from a CD, is it possible to update my drivers? I'm not sure how this can be possible due to CDs being write-once. Hoping someone can explain.\nPlease note, I'm new to Linux, this is the first time I've used the OS (aside from Android).\n\nA: You actually can install drivers, although somewhat limited.\nEverything you do in the live environment is only stored in the RAM; it gets lost at shutdown. So you can install drivers, but they will be lost as soon as your computer shuts down.\nSome drivers aren't automatically loaded after installation. After a reboot, however, they are then loaded automatically, if needed. If you happen to use such a driver module, you can load it manually using the command sudo modprobe <modulename>.\nHowever, some drivers need to be included into the initramfs image, because they need to be loaded before a user logs in. An example for this are storage drivers (HDD, CD) or Graphics drivers. These you can't install in a live system; they require a reboot to work properly. But as the RAM is cleared, you'll lose those drivers.\n\nIf you want to keep drivers even after a reboot, you should create a bootable USB stick with persistent memory. My software recommendation for this is UNetBootin. After giving the ISO path, you can set up the size of the persistency; I always choose about 4GiB, but it depends on what you want to do with the live system and how much space there is on the USB stick.\nAnother way of using drivers in a live system is to customize the ISO. If you do so, you can even install boot-time drivers by chroot'ing into the extracted ISO.\n", "Q: How does one read the contents of a text file located on the desktop using the terminal?

By default, you will be in your home directory.\ncd Desktop\n\nls\n\ncat \"filename\"\n\nExample\ncd Desktop\n\nls\n\ncat file1.txt\n\n\nA: Cat is a UNIX command that lets you read text files. So, you can just run the command cat ~/Desktop/FILENAMEHERE unless you are root. If you are root, you must type cat /home/*/Desktop/FILENAMEHERE. Also, you should upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 or 14.10. This isn't Windows. It's not okay to use an older version of Ubuntu like it is when you use Windows.

It is like what I'm used to except that the find and replace function does not work as I want it to.  I'm used to being able to be anywhere in a document, hit M-x %, then type my search and replace strings, hit enter, and replace throughout the rest of the document.  It does not do that anymore.  If I don't select a region, it will not even attempt to find any instances.  If I have selected a region, and it is entirely visible in my window, it will do the search and replace.  If I have highlighted a region that is larger than my window, it will only search and replace in the visible part of the region.

You can also \"escape\" the # by doing something like this: rm -rf \\#abd\\#.\nTo show this point more clearly, run some (safe) commands:\necho Hello #World\necho \"Hello #World\"\necho Hello_\\#World\n\nThe first will return Hello while the second will return Hello #World. The third will return Hello_#World. \nPrograms might do hash-naming to make their files hard to delete.

I do not think this is a duplicate of How to disable mouse power status in indicator-power?, which deals with the Unity panel rather than the xfce panel.\nI recently purchased a new wireless mouse to replace my previous wired one. In my notification area, there is now a mouse icon.\n\nI do not want this icon there, and besides, it appears to serve no useful purpose. Nothing appears when I hover over it or left-click on it. When I right-click on it, the battery monitor menu appears.\nThe application is not listed in the notification area settings, and changing the \"when to show battery icon\" settings had no effect.\n\nA: That looks like it might even be in the \"Indicator Plugin\" if not the \"Notification area\". Did you check the settings for both of those, and the settings for anything else that shows up in the Panel Preferences Items near there, like the battery monitor? You might be able to hide it if it's hiding in another (adjacent?) Panel Item.\n", "Q: Is canonical reconsidereing support for android apps on ubuntu touch? It seems like we are going to have ubuntu touch powered devices in the near time. \nEven though I'm willing to have an ubuntu powered device I find it pretty hard for a new competitor in the mobile arena to succeed if it doesn't have lots of apps, and the only way I see this could be achieved in the near feature is supporting android apps. Besides, there are some apps that are clear deal-breaker for many, like whatsapp, facebook, etc.\nJolla seems to think so, and being open source Ubuntu Touch could benefit from all their work supporting android apps.\nSo I was wondering if Canonical is considering adding support for android apps.\n\nA: This is what Richard Collins, head of Ubuntu mobile products, has to say on this issue -\n\nQ. Since Android is also Linux-based, is there any plan for Ubuntu to\n  run Android apps? \nA. Many Android developers already use Ubuntu as their desktop OS and\n  we have a very close affinity with them.

They were gettjng rid of a bunch of old hardware and I got my hands on an old still perfectly good ASUS eee Netbook. Naturally I decide the first thing to do is to install a linux distro. Going on to use Xubuntu 14.04 X86. Get my bootable usb drive (my tablet with a fancy app on it that works on every other pc I have tried) and it will not boot. I go into the bios and disable quiet and quick boot (I already have it set to boot of of removable drive) and still nothing. I then try to manually select usb at boot (pressing escape at boot) and it won't even show my drive.  The only choice is the hard drive (side note: the hdd is only 4 gigs!) Does anyone know how to get the darn thing to boot off of the drive?\nShort Version:\nthe stuff before was like a story with hidden info\n1. I went into the bios and set the first device to \"removable div.\" (failed)\n2. I went into the bios and set quick and quiet boot off (failed)\n3. I tried to select the boot device on startup instead of letting the pc do it for me (failed)\n\nOn the boot device list the only thing that even showed up was the HDD. I would have tried a CD but I have no usb DVD drive. Im at a loss and a couple hours of research proved to be useless.\n\nA: You can try to use the netboot approach.

The netboot guide is on another community doc https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Netboot\n\nA: The problem was the tablet. There were settings you had to initially set to get it to work and they dealt with how the image is hosted. I had forgotten about these settings and did not change them. I used an SD card and the SD card reader to install. Just in case you were wandering I used Android as my OS because its small and fast enough to run well on the hardware.\n", "Q: best way to copy your ubuntu to a new hard drive I found this question Best way to clone an installation (copying to identical hardware) to be close to what I need, but I wonder if it is still going to work if, instead of two different machines, I want to clone all to a new hard drive, bigger, and of a different brand (installed on the same machine). \nThe other option that I was considering is to the do a back-up of the current system and restore it (after a fresh install of the same ubuntu 12.04) on the other hard drive, what do you think?\nI am using ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS\n\nA: using timeshift you can backup current OS and then restore it some other computer after installing fresh setup first. it will restore your personal files and installed software\n", "Q: Move each filename into filename subfolders I have a directory structure like this\nfile 1.ext1\nfile 1.ext2\nfile 1.ext3\nfile 2.temp.ext1\nfile 2.ext2\nfile 3.ext1\n\nI want to create each subfolder and move each file name no matter what extension there\nfile 1\\file 1.ext1\nfile 1\\file 1.ext2\nfile 1\\file 1.ext3\nfile 2\\file 2.temp.ext1\nfile 2\\file 2.ext2\nfile 3\\file 3.ext1\n\nany easy way to do it? thanks\n\nA: find . -type f -exec sh -c 'base=$(echo $1 | grep -oP \"(?<=\\./).*(?=\\.[^\\.]*$)\"); mkdir -p \"${base}\"; mv \"$1\" \"$base\"' . {} \\;\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*find . -type f This script will operate on all \"regular\" files (i.e. will not work on the current directory .).\n\n*-exec sh -c '...' . {} \\; execute the '...' part, with the filename fed to the script as an argument (and accessed by $1).\n\n*base=$(echo $1 | grep -oP \"(?<=\\./).*(?=\\.[^\\.]*$)\"); derive the base part of the filename. i.e. grep out the part after ./ and before the final ..\n\n*mkdir -p \"${base}\"; Create the directory (e.g. file1).\n\n*mv \"$1\" \"$base\" Move the file into the newly created directory.\n\n\n\nIf you prefer files such as file1.temp.ext1 to move to the directory file1, instead of file1.temp, then you can use the following instead.\nfind . -type f -exec sh -c 'base=$(echo $1 | grep -oP \"(?<=\\./)[^\\.]*(?=\\..*$)\"); mkdir -p \"${base}\"; mv \"$1\" \"$base\"' . {} \\;\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*(?<=\\./)[^\\.]*(?=\\..*$) The only part that differs is the regular expression to capture the \"base\" part of the filename, where the new directory will be created.

However, the same can't be said of an Ubuntu 14.04 container. It appears that the problem lies within Ubuntu's fractional implementation of systemd, whereas Fedora's full implementation (even with LXC restrictions) doesn't seem to have a problem in this case.\nMy test case relies on the Spice vdagent git sources. Once spice-vdagent connects to spice-vdagentd, vdagentd attempts to get session information for vdagent PID via libsystemd-login0 call sd_pid_get_session. This call returns with \"No such file or directory\", preventing Spice form working correctly. After digging through the source of libsystemd-login0, it appears that this call is reliant on the systemd cgroup.\nUnfortunately, this cgroup doesn't exist within a container due to the file /etc/init/systemd-logind.conf explicitly not mounting the cgroup when running in a container. After removing the LXC check and rebooting the LXC container, I am left with a cgroup mounted in /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd. All appears to be well and good until examining /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/cgroup.procs -- it's empty, as are all other cgroup.procs files underneath. The comment in the systemd-logind.conf above the LXC check states \"mounting the cgroup does not work in LXC, there it uses cgmanager,\" but this doesn't give me any insight into how it should be done, or how it can be worked around.\nI'm really unsure if this is an LXC-specific issue (perhaps LXC is preventing it from working properly?) or whether it's a systemd-logind issue. I should clarify that, for the moment, I have assigned my Ubuntu 14.40 LXC container to the 'unrestricted' profile so as to ensure it's not some kind of funky permissions issue.\nDoes anybody have any insight on what can be done to get the systemd cgroup within the LXC container working properly so that I can use Spice happily?\nEDIT: After checking my host system, the systemd cgroup there seems to be working just fine, hm...\nDespite lacking systemd-cgls, I can still provide some similar information:\nHere is a tree of the /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd

I think the title explains the question clearly. Trying to become familiar with linux systems, so may be a noob question. However it has been a question mark in my mind since I met with linux. Why is it that hard to handle hybrid graphics architectures on linux based systems while windows doing it as easy as 1 click?\nthanks in advance\n\nA: Hybrid graphics a set of two graphic cards with different abilities and power consumptions.\nThe (Old) Basic Switching Model -\nThis approach involves a two graphic card setup with a hardware multiplexer (MUX). It allows power save and low-end 3D rendering by using an Integrated Graphics Processor (IGP); or a major power consumption with 3D rendering performance using a Dedicated/Discrete Graphics Processor (DGP). This model makes the user choose (at boot time or at login time) within the two power/graphics profiles and is almost fixed through all the user session.\nThe (New) Dynamic Switching Model -\nIn this approach, the DGP and IGP are plugged to a framebuffer and there is no hardware multiplexer. The IGP is always on and the DGP is switched on/off when there is a need in power-save or performance-rendering. In most cases there is no way to use only the DGP and all the switching and rendering is controlled by software.\nThe problem with dynamic switching in Linux -\nAt startup, the Linux kernel starts using a video mode and setting up low-level graphic drivers which will be used by the applications. Most of the Linux distributions then use X.org to create a graphical environment. Finally, a few other softwares are launched, first a login manager and then a window manager, and so on. This hierarchical system has been designed to be used in most of cases on a single graphic card.\nTherefore, the kernel has to be indicated that the graphic switching has to be done in a dynamic manner by means of a driver. However, most manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD are focused more towards the Windows side since it is more popular due to the number of games that are designed for it and the user base. It is basically a vicious cycle in which linux gets stuck.\nReference : Arch Wiki\n", "Q: Argument \"perl_version\" isn't numeric in numeric ge (>=) at (eval 534) line 1 Since last package update all my Ubuntu 14.04.1 servers are sending me emails with a Cron warning - subject is\n\nCron  test -e /usr/sbin/amavisd-new-cronjob &&\n  /usr/sbin/amavisd-new-cronjob sa-sync\n\nwith a body content\nArgument \"perl_version\" isn't numeric in numeric ge (>=) at (eval 530) line 1.\nArgument \"perl_version\" isn't numeric in numeric ge (>=) at (eval 1023) line 1.\nArgument \"perl_version\" isn't numeric in numeric ge (>=) at (eval 532) line 1.\nArgument \"perl_version\" isn't numeric in numeric ge (>=) at (eval 1025) line 1.\n\nDo I need to worry about it & how can I solve it?

It can be safely ignored. It is due to a recent rule update using a SA conditional that has been added to trunk but not released yet.\nGermar's answer will fix the problem but may not be acceptable for those who want to stay with pure distro code.\nI don't know how quickly distros will incorporate the SA changes: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1642207\nThe rule in question has been disabled in the rule sandbox, it will (hopefully) go out in updates by tonight (2014-11-30) and this warning should then stop.\n", "Q: using ubuntu-sdk to create app with problems I upgraded my ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10 to use the latest ubuntu-sdk. But When I created a simple UI project there is just a red wave line under the \"import Ubuntu.Components.1.1\".\nSo I moved my mouse to the red wave line. A window poped up showing like this literally:\nErrors while reading typeinfo files:\n   Failed to parse 'usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/Ubuntu/Component/plugins.qmltypes'.\n   Error:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt3/qml/Ubuntu/Components/plugins.qmltypes:632:19:Expected string literal to contain 'Package/Name major.minor' or 'Name major.minor'.\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt3/qml/Ubuntu/Components/plugins.qmltypes:633:36:Expected array literal with only number literal members.\n\nWhat does this lines mean? How can I solve these problems?\n\nA: I was having the same problem today, however, I just discovered the solution (and what the error was specifically). \nThe problem is the qml plugin files required are not in the currently specified include directories.\nIf you make a new app and select App with Simple UI, there will be a file called [projectName].qmlproject in the app project root directory. \nOn mine, the include was near the bottom of the page, like this:\n/* List of plugin directories passed to QML runtime */\n    importPaths: [ \".\" ,\"/usr/bin\",\"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/qml\"]\n\nI ran find / -name *qml* and found something that looked to be a suitable directory, with many items that had a good chance of being qml plugins, so I copied that directory, went to [projectName].qmlproject to the statement posted above and added the directory. The final importPaths statement looks like this:\n/* List of plugin directories passed to QML runtime */\n    importPaths: [ \".\" ,\"/usr/bin\",\"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/qml\",\"/var/lib/schroot/chroots/click-ubuntu-sdk-14.10-armhf/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/qt5/qml/Ubuntu/Components/\" ]\n\nAfter doing that, I could open the qml file in designer in that project as well as in another that doesn't have a qmlproject file, so I assume the memory of the directory was retained.\nThe issue is, however, that it's looking in the wrong directory for the qml plugin files, so find those and a way to include them (the way specified above solved the issue for me).\n\nA: I had the same problem, to fix it I edited the plugins.qmltypes file. Follow the path in the error message, you need superuser permissions. The error message says some lines could not been parsed. Looking at the file, the lines are contained in some kind of JSON object, in my case, at the end of the file. I removed the whole object and it worked.\nComponent {\n        prototype: \"QObject\"\n        name: \"UbuntuColors\"\n        exports: [\"UbuntuColors -1.-1\"]\n        exportMetaObjectRevisions: [-1]\n        isComposite: true\n        isCreatable: false\n        isSingleton: true\n        Property { name: \"orange\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"lightAubergine\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"midAubergine\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"darkAubergine\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"warmGrey\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"coolGrey\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"orangeGradient\"; type: \"QQuickGradient\"; isPointer: true }\n        Property { name: \"greyGradient\"; type: \"QQuickGradient\"; isPointer: true }\n        Property { name: \"lightGrey\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"darkGrey\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"red\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"green\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"blue\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n        Property { name: \"purple\"; type: \"QColor\"; isReadonly: true }\n    }\n\n\nA: My solution was to change the plugins.qmltypes file:\n\nThis bug is caused by setting exportMetaObjectRevisions to [0,0] on Component blocks that only have one export defined.

To be able to shutdown with a keyboard shortcut we can assign gnome-session-quit ---power-off to a custom shortcut.\nIn Unity this will lead to the following dialog:\n\nThen we need another at least two keystrokes to finally power off our system. This is rather inconvenient and I would prefer the old shutdown dialog when you could poweroff by just pressing Return or letting it wait the default countdown of 60 seconds.\nWhen calling gnome-session-quit --poweroff from a GNOME session flashback session on the same system (14.04 LTS) the old dialog including the countdown comes back:\n\nSo we know it dwells somewhere. \nIs there any way to call this old dialog when running a Unity session?\n\nA: Not literally what you asked for, but at least an (effectively) comparable solution would be to put the script below under a shortcut key.\nWhat it does\nWhen the shortcut key is used:\n\n\n*\n\n*the gnome-session-quit --power-off command is run\n\n*the mouse is moved to the corresponding \"close\" button, effectively making the shutdown button pre- selected:\n\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the user presses Enter, the system shuts down\n\n*If the user does nothing, the system waits for 30 seconds (or any other period of time you'd like to set) and shuts down.\n\n*If the user moves the mouse during the 30 seconds, the procedure is stopped\n\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n#--- set the location of the close button x, y\nq_loc = [1050, 525]\n#--- set the time to wait before shutdown\ncountdown = 30\n\nsubprocess.Popen([\"gnome-session-quit\", \"--power-off\"])\n# for slower systems, set a longer break, on faster systems, can be shorter:\ntime.sleep(0.4)\nsubprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"mousemove\", str(q_loc[0]), str(q_loc[1])])\n\ncoords1 = q_loc\nt = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    cmd = \"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"\n    currloc = subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").split()[:2]\n    coords2 = [int(n.split(\":\")[1]) for n in currloc]\n    if coords2 != coords1:\n        break\n    else:\n        if t >= countdown:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"key\", \"KP_Enter\"])\n            break\n    t += 1\n\nHow to use\nI am pretty sure you know how to use it, but here we go for habbit reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses xdotool\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as run_close.py\n\n*In the head section, set the screen's location of the shut-down button in the close- window (my first guess was right):\n#--- set the location of the close button x, y\nq_loc = [1050, 525]\n\nand the time to wait before unattended shut down:\n#--- set the time to wait before shutdown\ncountdown = 30\n\n\n*Test-run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/run_close.py\n\nTest it with all of the option: pressing Enter for immediate shutdown, unattended shutdown and break the procedure by mouse- move\n\n*If all works fine, add it to a shortcut key: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\n python3 /path/to/run_close.py\n\n\nEDIT\nBelow a version of the script that does not need any additional setting. It calculates the coordinates of the quit button, no matter what is the screen's resolution. \nThe setup is pretty much the same, but [3.] can be skipped.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n#--- set the time to wait before shutdown\ncountdown = 30\n\ndef get_qloc():\n    xr = subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    scrs = [s.split(\"+\") for s in xr if all([s.count(\"x\") == 1, s.count(\"+\") == 2])]\n    center = [int(int(s)/2) for s in [scr[0] for scr in scrs if scr[1] == \"0\"][0].split(\"x\")]\n    return [center[0] + 250, center[1]]\n\nq_loc = get_qloc()\n\nsubprocess.Popen([\"gnome-session-quit\", \"--power-off\"])\n# for slower systems, set a longer break, on faster systems, can be shorter:\ntime.sleep(0.4)\nsubprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"mousemove\", str(q_loc[0]), str(q_loc[1])])\n\ncoords1 = q_loc\nt = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    cmd = \"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"\n    currloc = subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").split()[:2]\n    coords2 = [int(n.split(\":\")[1]) for n in currloc]\n    if coords2 != coords1:\n        break\n    else:\n        if t >= countdown:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"key\", \"KP_Enter\"])\n            break\n    t += 1\n\nExplanation\nThe size of the Session Manager window to close the system is always centred and of a fixed (absolute) size, independent to the screen's resolution. Therefore the position relative to the centre of the screen is a constant factor. \nAll we need to do then is to read the screen's resolution and calculate the button's position from there.\nThe applied function ( get_qloc() ) calculates the resolution of the left screen, since that is the one where the dialogue will appear.\nNote\nThe time, set in the line time.sleep(0.4) is set for relatively slow systems, to make sure the mouse is moved after the shut down window appears. On faster systems, it can be shorter, on slower systems (like possibly a VM) it might be needed to set to longer.\n\nA: Here's a script to emulate the desired behavior. Must be ran as with sudo. Can be bound to a keyboard shortcut ( with preliminary addition of the shutdown command to sudoers file to allow passwordless run ). Simplistic, concise, and does the job.\n#!/bin/bash\n# Date: June 11,2015\n# Author: Serg Kolo\n# Description: a script to emulate\n# behavior of GNOME session flashback\n# shutdown dialog\n\n# Tell ubuntu to shutdown in 1 min\nshutdown -P +1 &\n# Show the dialog\nzenity --question --text=\"Shutdown now ? Automatic shutdown in 60 seconds\" --ok-label=\"DOIT\" \n# If user clicks DOIT, then cancel the old \n# shutdown call that has countdown,\n# (because only one shutdown command can be run at a time), and\n# tell ubuntu to shutdown immediately\n# otherwise - cancel it\nif [ $? -eq 0 ];then\n        shutdown -c\n        shutdown -P now\nelse\n        shutdown -c\nfi\n\nUpdate: June 14\nAs suggested by Takkat, here's a script that utilizes zenity's --timer option and dbus to achieve the same behavior without need for sudo access:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Date: June 14,2015\n# Author: Serg Kolo\n# Description: a script to emulate\n# behavior of GNOME session flashback\n# shutdown dialog\n# version #2\n\nzenity --question --text=\"Shutdown now ? Autoshutdown in 60 seconds\" \\\n    --cancel-label=\"DOIT\" --ok-label=\"NOPE\" --timeout=60 ||  \n  dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.login1 \\\n    /org/freedesktop/login1 \"org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.PowerOff\" boolean:true\n\nBasic idea here is that zenity's timeout option exits with code greater than 0, which typically means command failed. So by treating zenity's cancel option and timeout as the condition that will allow shutdown, we use the OR operator (|| ) to shutdown only if user clicks the cancel button (labeled as \"DOIT\" ) or dialog times out.\nAnother variation to improve user experience can be done with yad (needs to be installed first with these commands sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager;sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install yad ). This variation uses progress bar to let user know how much time is left\n    #!/bin/bash\n    yad --auto-close --sticky --on-top --skip-taskbar --center \\\n  --text 'Shutdown now ? Autoshutdown in 60 seconds.' \\\n  --button=\"gtk-ok:1\" --button=\"gtk-close:0\" --image=dialog-question \\ \n--title 'Shutdown' --timeout=60 --timeout-indicator=top || \ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.login1 \\\n/org/freedesktop/login1 \"org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.PowerOff\" boolean:true\n\nAnother possible version does take into account that if you change Zenity's ok button label, the button highlighted by default may or may not be the ok button.\nzenity --question --timeout 10 --text=\"Automatic shutdown in 10 seconds\"\nif [[ $? -eq 1 ]] ; then\n    # user clicked Cancel\n    exit \nelse\n    dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.login1 /org/freedesktop/login1 \"org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.PowerOff\" boolean:true\nfi\n\nThe script shuts down the system upon any return that is not 0.

What is the difference between the driver that comes with Ubuntu and Intel open source graphics driver?\nInstalling the Intel driver will improve performance and reduce battery consumption considerably?\n\nA: \nwhat is the difference between the driver that comes with ubuntu and intel open source graphics driver ?\n\nThey are the same driver.  The benefit of the one included in Ubuntu is that it will have had an additional period of testing by Ubuntu and its users and will remain stable for the life of that Ubuntu release.  The benefit of obtaining it from Intel directly is that it will be a more recent version.\n\ninstalling intel driver will improve performance and reduce battery consumption considerably ?\n\nUnlikely.  It's basically the same driver, the only differences will be as stated above; if it's a more recent version, then battery consumption may have improved, but there's also a small chance that it's worsened or that you may notice other issues.  There's no reason to install the driver from Intel unless dealing with specific problems it may solve.\n\nA: They are the same. It's just that the one shipped by default by ubuntu are just a little old. But not much.\nWith the intel graphic driver installer, you get the latest of their latest driver. if your distro is supported.\nAs of today, 14.10 is still not. just a few days to wait though.\n", "Q: Unable to upgrade or fresh install Lubuntu 14.10 (32bit) on Lenovo Ideapad S205 I'm unable to upgrade or fresh install Lubuntu 14.10 (32bit) on a Lenovo Ideapad S205.\nAfter the install or upgrade, the laptop just boot loops.

I would give you an upvote if I could.\n\nA: Sure just install a ssh server. You should also probably route the vnc over the ssh but i am not gonna focus on that.\nThe ssh server does basically what the vnc does but for tty (not for the gui). It is capable of many things but is mostly use as a way to display a terminal window to a remote computer so you can use commands from the remote computer.\nYou can install it by using sudo apt-get install openssh-server and the server/service should start automatically after the installation (and at startup) \nThe server listens to port 22 and to login you only have to use your username and password as you would in a tty.\nto test the server from any linux installation just open a terminal and type:\nssh 'your username'@'your ip'\n\nand then type your password. If the ssh client is not installed you can install it by \nsudo apt-get install openssh-client\nif you want to connect to your pc from a windows installation you can use the program putty (free, google it :P)\n\nA: Use SSH.

Things got scary for a while and I was unable to boot :-(. I have now got myself back to a working system by renaming the corrupt /tmp to /tmp.old, and creating a new /tmp:\ndrwxrwxrwt   6 root root       4096 Nov 29 13:44 tmp\ndrwxrwxrwt   4 root root 1013628928 Nov 29 13:49 tmp.old\n\nI forced an fsck at reboot, and I expected that might fix things. It seemed to go ok, but if I attempt to look at or remove /tmp.old, ls or rm commands just hang and don't return any thing. How do I get rid of /tmp.old and make sure there are no other problems?\n\nA: The solution to this turned out to be a little different to what I was expecting. After I asked this question my /tmp directory \"corrupted\" two more times.\nI finally figured out that actually it wasn't corrupt at all. It was just full of an enormous number of files (symlinks actually). So full in fact that ls would hang for a considerable time (over a minute) whilst it was processing the index before it would start doing anything. My system wouldn't boot because part of the start up process is to clear out /tmp, and it was getting stuck at this point. I never got the rm command to return at all even after waiting for a very long period of time. After doing some online research I eventually came across this command:\ncd /tmp\nsudo find . ! -path . -delete\n\nThis seemed to work faster and only took an hour or so!!\nThat sorted out the /tmp directory. The reason it was filling up was to do with printing. If I attempted to print something then that triggered the problem (although this wasn't immediately obvious as it took a while for /tmp to fill up). However looking at the symlinks that were being created, I noticed that they were all pointing at a ppd file for my printer. I deleted and reinstalled my printer using the hp-setup program (it's an HP printer) - but that didn't solve the problem. However deleting and manually setting up the printer without using hp-setup did.

I decided e-mail was the best option.\nI've installed, configured and tested ssmtp to use one of my usual e-mail services.\nAlso, I've configured unattended-upgrade to e-mail me after any upgrades, at least initially.\nCan I get the unattended-upgrade e-mail to come from a specific address?  I know I can do that using just mail or ssmtp directly but if I don't specify a \"from\" address then it defaults to my mail service's default account and I want it to be clear it came from this particular machine.  Where can I specify a \"from\" address for the mail command that unattended-upgrade uses?\n\nA: Found in /usr/bin/unattended-upgrade:\nfrom_email = apt_pkg.config.find(\"Unattended-Upgrade::Sender\", \"root\")\n\nSo by default it will use \"root\" as a sender, which (at least in my case) can lead to a rejection of the email due to missing or wrong from field.\nYou can change the sender in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades, for example:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Sender \"Unattended-upgrades Hostname <MyName@MyDomain.com>\";\n\n\nA: Just specify an alias in your mail.rc file:\nalias root root<ParticularMachine@YourDomain.com>\n\n\nA: @Fabby - Thank you for your suggestion, I couldn't find a mail.rc file anywhere but you pointed me in the right direction.  (I tried to vote up your answer but I'm apparently too much of a noob!)\nJust to check, I did a sendmail -V which confirmed that I was using sSMTP.\nRe-reading the docs on sSMTP pointed me at setting an alias as suggested but in either /etc/aliases or /etc/ssmtp/revaliases.\n/etc/aliases already contained an entry for root - and changing it seems to have no visible effect on sent e-mail headers or contents.  (Is it for incoming mail I'm thinking...?)\nHowever, adding: \nroot:MyName@MyDomain.com:MyMailHub.com\n\nto /etc/ssmtp/revaliases did result in mail generating a message with:\nFrom: root <MyName@MyDomain.com> \n\nwhich isn't exactly what I wanted but is good enough.\nIronically, when I logged into the server to try this, it informed me that a system restart was required but I have no e-mail to alert me to that so I must still not have that set up correctly... back to square one!\n\nA: Edit 50unattended-upgrades.\nsudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades\n\nAdd the line:\n// Specify the from email address.\nUnattended-Upgrade::Sender \"EXAMPLE-Unattended-Upgrades\";\n\nChange \"EXAMPLE\" or even remove \"-Unattended-Upgrades\" and the email will come from the EXAMPLE name.\n", "Q: Capture line-in audio, stream to vps and rebroadcast for mobile device I need do something like this:\nCapture from line-in  ---stream---> vps ----stream---> 5-6 mobile devices\nNow I using icecast with burts off as server on vps and darkice to capture audio on my local pc, but I got 6-15s delays and its for much for me :( \nCould I get 0.2-2s latency with other software?\nWhat software I should install on my local computer and on vps and how to configure it to works?\n\nA: In icecast.xml , reduce \"burst size\" to 0 will reduce the delay  .\nIncreasing bit rate will also reduce delay (256 kb/s better than 128).  \nYou can also reduce buffer size in darkice.cfg (try .5 or 1 sec )\n", "Q: Can't access any remote network routes using OpenVPN client My home network has an OpenVPN server installed and working.

The scanner can then be used from SANE (Simple Scan), basically, similar to ScanToPC.\nWhile this could be set up with sane-xerox_mfp backend (by simply adding a tcp <printer's-IP-address> 9400 entry), this would not work properly when scanning from ADF Feeder. Instead, the current solution that worked for me involves installing the scanner driver from the official Unified Linux driver package for the printer (uld_V1.00.39_01.17.tar.gz, only scanner part ./install-scanner.sh), fixing up some links to the dirver's libsane-smfp.so.1.0.1, installing legacy libusb version (libusb-0.1-4), and finally, adding the printer's USB info (usb 0x04e8 0x3453) in xerox_mfp.conf.\nThe scanner is then being recognized as smfp:net;<printer's-IP-address> device.\nWell, it works now! Wish it worked without such involved configuration.\n", "Q: External 4k Monitor on Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro Do you have any experience with a 4k monitor at the Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro?\nIt has an Intel Core i5 4200U and an Intel HD Graphics 4400 card with a mini HDMI port.\nI am interested in buying a UHD (3840x2160) external Monitor and use it mainly for office work on my Yoga so 30Hz would be enough for a start.\n\nA: I'm using it with a AMH A399U 3840x2160 monitor with a microHDMI–HDMI cable.  Getting 30Hz.\nHardware\nThe HDMI connection seems somewhat sensitive — at some points some of my cables and/or one of the 2 HDMI ports on monitor didn't work at 4K.  I'm unable to say if the laptop, the cables or the monitor were to blame.  But overall I've settled on a connection that works.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apparently the Yoga's HDMI port is slightly too deep for some cables, can be fixed by shaving off some plastic.  I haven't tried that but I can confirm moving the cable (any of several I tried) easily disconnects it.\n\n\nOn frequency: My monitor claims 60Hz via HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort; the Yoga 2 Pro is only capable of 30Hz over its HDMI 1.4 (or 1.3?).\n(IIUC HDMI 2.0 is not coming to laptops anytime soon, except maybe via nVidia cards.)\nOn MST / single-stream: I think my monitor uses MST to achieve 4K (pretends to be 2 screens).  This is invisible to me — all software treats it as one video output.  Can't say if it will work with newer single-stream monitors (don't know if Yoga can send single stream nor if all such monitors also accept MST).  I think that's a hardware—hardware question, so a report from a Windows user for your specific monitor should be enough.\nThe only non-HDMI way to get 4K out of the Yoga is via USB3 -> DisplayPort or USB3 -> HDMI adapters; I haven't tried any and I'm not sure there are any exist with linux drivers (Pluggable are fantastical about linux  and but none of their 4K adapters does).  Also, I think they all use lossy compression to fit USB3 bandwidth.\nPerformance\nWe're using it for reading and coding, and some movie watching.  The Haswell GPU is definitely not enough for 3D gaming at 4K.\n4K streaming from Youtube doesn't work well.  Left to \"auto\" it settles on 1080p / 1440p.  Not sure if it's network speed (10–20Mbps here) or decoding speed but I'm resorting to youtube-dl and then playing locally.\n4K decoding in Gnome Videos app and MPlayer seems to be smooth; VLC tends to struggle.  However there's constant screen tearing.  I suspect that's resolvable, haven't looked into it yet. \nSoftware configuration\n\n\n*\n\n*Turning off the internal display and enabling the HDMI just worked.\n\n*So did extending the desktop — half here half there (I did it vertically; don't remember if there was a horizontal width limitation or I just wanted one on top of the other).  In any case, due to the Yoga screen's very high pixel density, it was an awkward setup.  (Per-screen UI scaling is practically non-existant in linux yet.)\n\n*Touching things on the laptop's screen is sometimes nice, so I settled on a config showing same desktop on both screens.  The resolutions are not that different, so I'm set it to draw at 4K and scale down for the internal screen, using this command:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 -s 3840x2160 --transform none --pos 0x0 --output eDP1 -s 3200x1800 --scale-from 3840x2160 --pos 0x0\n\n[https://github.com/cben/myenv/blob/master/bin/4k]\n\nA: I connected dell UHD 4K monitor to Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro laptop. Then pressed window key+P key. Selected external monitor only. I got 4K signal at 29HZ. For regular work it is fine. \n\nA: Well according to Intel ark, it isn't specified to be able to output a resolution over 3280x2000, so I'm pretty sure 4K is going to be a bad idea, if it works at all. This system is prone to running warm, and 4K wouldn't be very comfy for the iGpu even doing menial tasks\n\nA: It depends on your exact processor type.  the Y-Processor series only support 24Hz on HDMI.  Have a look at the Intel website...\n", "Q: HP UEFI doesn't boot Ubuntu automatically I own a HP ProBook, which came with SLED11 preinstalled, and on which I has Trusty installed\n(NO Dual boot). UEFI wasn't enabled. Now I bought a SSD and built it into the laptop. As I read that using UEFI can improve firmware loading time by several seconds, I enabled it and booted the Ubuntu Trusty Live USB I created with UNetBootin.\nAfter the installation finished (erase disk and install), I rebooted and noticed that the HP boot menu said it didn't find any OS's. When I open up the Boot device selection, it lists the following:\nOS Boot Manager\nBoot from EFI file\nubuntu\n\nThe entry ubuntu boots my system. I can also manually specify the path to grubx64.efi. But OS Boot Manager shows above error message.\nHow do I get my Ubuntu automatically booted, without hitting F9 every time?\nPS: The UEFI setup allows me to specify a path to a custom EFI file, if that might be helpful. However, /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi doesn't work. I assume it requires some sort of device ID before it... But I's prefer putting Ubuntu in the OS Boot Manager.\n\nEdit 1: It turns out that this is a flaw in HP's UEFI implementation. It seems that Customized Boot is the only option.\n\nEdit 2: As soon as the HP guys tell me how to apply a firmware upgrade to my computer (refuses to load the update EFI image), I'll do so, maybe OS Boot Manager will boot Ubuntu then.\nEdit 3: I learned it is not possible. To upgrade the firmware of my ProBook 455, I need to run Windows directly on it, as the upgrade image is generated locally by a Windows-only software, which reads various stuff from the BIOS, so I can neither use virtualization nor Wine.\n\nA: The path that needs to be entered as the Custom Boot image is:\nWhen using Secure Boot: EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\nWhen not using Secure Boot: EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\nThis is one of two workarounds. The other would be to copy /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/(grub|shim)x64.efi to /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi.\n\nSource: https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxmint/+bug/1309395\n", "Q: How to completely restore Unity Launcher (all icons are missing)?

What do you suggest?\nBr.\n\nA: As a secondary user does not exhibit the behaviour of your primary user, there is something else wrong in your primary user's profile.\nTherefore, you can look and look and look and eventually find what is wrong, but I would not worry and just copy (not move: copy) all your Documents, Downloads, ... from the \"problem\" user to the new user and then delete these from the bad user.  \nE.G.:\nsudo cp --recursive --force /home/slashme/Documents /home/slashme2/Documents\n\nif no errors:\nsudo rm -r /home/slashme/Documents\n\nrepeat for bin, Pictures, Templates, Desktop, Downloads, Music, Public, Videos\nthen delete user \"slashme\", rename \"slashme2\" to \"slashme\" and forget this ever happened.\nProblem solved!

Recently, my windows screwed up and I had to factory reset it. Everything was fine: my system downgrade to windows 8 and I still had the grub to choose what operating system I'd like to use. \nBut as soon as I went into windows, I updated it to 8.1: that made the system boot directly to windows. Thankfully it didn't mess up with my linux partitions as I could see on GParted.\nThen I put my ubuntu live usb and ran Boot-Repair. The log can be seen on http://paste.ubuntu.com/9304059/\nBut that didn't change anything, it boots to windows directly yet. \nAt the end of the boot-repair setup, it shows:\n\nBoot successfully repaired.\nYou can now reboot your computer. Please do not forget to make your\n  BIOS boot on sda1/EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi file!\nIf your computer reboots directly into Windows, try to change the boot\n  order in your BIOS. If your BIOS does not allow to change the boot\n  order, change the default boot entry of the Windows bootloader. For\n  example you can boot into Windows, then type the following command in\n  an admin command prompt: bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path\n  \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nI ran Powershell with adm rights on windows and run the command it gave me, but it said command specifications were not valid. \nHow can I fix my boot?\n\nA: Go back into Windows and in the power settings, turn off fast boot.  The 8.1 upgrade turns it back on, preventing a normal boot.\n\nAlso check that the INtel Rapid Start is disabled.\n\nA: After a couple of research I found out a solution:\nsudo efibootmgr\n\nThen check what was ubuntu boot number. In my case, it was 3, and for windows boot it was 1.

It looks to me like something on the destination server is blocking SSH or breaking it once it's connected, hence, \"broken pipe\". I disagree with @kenorb because if it were a timeout issue you would probably be seeing rsync exit codes 30 or 35.\n\nA: Broken pipe error most likely means that you've hit the timeout. For example the remote rsync command started to calculate the file differences, but it didn't replied to the client on time.\nIf this happens very often, add these settings to your local ~/.ssh/config:\nHost *\n  ServerAliveInterval 30\n  ServerAliveCountMax 6\n\nand on the remote server (if you've got the access), setup these in your /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nClientAliveInterval 30\nClientAliveCountMax 6\n\nSee: What the options ServerAliveInterval and ClientAliveInterval mean?\n\nA: To investigate, add one or more -v options to the rsync command.\nAlso, try to use plain ssh:\nssh -v 192.168.1.21 /bin/true\n\nto find out whether it is rsync or the underlying ssh connection that is causing the trouble.\n\nA: I got the 255 error when rsnapshot using rsync encountered the situation \"The ECDSA host key for foobar has changed\". The rest of the error message included \"POSSIBLE DNS SPOOFING DETECTED\" and \"REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED\".\nI had recreated my server and so the fingerprint had changed. I removed the ECDSA key (ssh-keygen -f \"/home/bruce/.ssh/known_hosts\" -R \"foobar\") and agreed to the new one when I sshed into foobar again.\nssh -vvv foobar gave me the info I needed to see this issue.\n\nA: I know this issue is old, but maybe someone (like me) still have the error.\na) Check if the ssh service is running:\nsudo service ssh status\n\nb) Check the connection with triple verbose command:\nssh -vvv <hostname>\n\nc) Maybe you use the wrong ssh-key or the key is broken in some way.\nVine\n\nA: I had a similar error using rsync via my deploy for an Ember app (ember-cli-deploy).

However lots of servers also check your reverse dns to match you HELO/EHLO, so you identification should be made the same as your reverse dns for most domains to be able to send mail to it.\n\nA: You are trying to send from mikeserver, but that is not a fqdn.i assume mikeserver is your home machine on a dial up connection? You should use a mail relay to send mails from your home machine. If it is a server with a static ip you must check the dns name resolution is working forward and backward, your mx record is set correctly (mikeserver.yourdomain.tld) and the mailname of your server is set accordingly. You also should have a valid spf record for your server.\n", "Q: Notebook compatibility I'm currently using a Notebook with Ubuntu and and since like it, I would like to keep using this Ubuntu... :-)\nUnfortunately I can't find any notebook for sale with Ubuntu in Portugal. I was looking at this one with windows 8: ACER ES1-512-C29D and ASUS F553MA-SX361B, but I can't find whether they work with Ubuntu or not. \nHow can I find out if they are compatible?\n\nA: The best way is to go to a computer shop which sells one of your models and ask whether you may boot Ubuntu from an USB stick in order to test if everything's fine (emphasize that you're not going to change anything at the computer at all - I've experienced that many resellers have never heard of Ubuntu, let alone used it.)\nYou can put an Ubuntu ISO on an USB stick using utilities like UNetBootin. When the shop allows you to test it, boot from the USB stick and select the menu option \"try without installation\".\n\nAnother way to find out whether Ubuntu works with this computer is to find out which components are installed in this machine and search the internet on known problems to these devices (e.g. graphics card, LAN card, WiFi card). Some computers are even certified to work with Ubuntu in the Ubuntu Certification Program, in which Asus participates.\nHowever, this won't 100%ly assure that it will actually work, so first method is preferable.\n\nIn general, I've made the experience that Ubuntu will run on most systems almost without problems, as long as you don't use and exotic hardware, whose manufacturer only provides Windows drivers.\nYou could also search for computers that come preinstalled with ANY linux-based OS. They all use a release of the Linux kernel, which does all the hardware interaction, so it shouldn't matter whether you use Ubuntu or, let's say, SUSE Linux, which was preinstalled on my Notebook when I bought it.\nAlthough I have to say that this is not always true: Only after waiting two months for the shipment of said notebook, I learned that HP sent me a device whose hardware components are not completely Linux-compatible: Bluetooth, SD-Card reader and certain Fn keys don't or only partially do work.\n\nA: Although the seller did not let me test the software I ended up buying an ASUS F553M. I installed Ubuntu in accordance with the instructions given here and the computer is running almost 100%. With the exception of not turning off, is locked in the message \"* will now halt\", and consequent problems in restarting, all hardware seems to work. Thank you, Vasco Reis –  Vasco Reis\n\nA: Asus F553M works with Ubuntu on USB but after installation you can't run computer. It's a problem with all Linux systems on F553M. I have tried Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, CentOS and OpenSUSE. OpenSUSE as only one run on F553M but it needs long time to start (about 1min) and there is many other problems. \n\nA: After all, i'm not the only one having these problems. I also had this problem in the boot that does not start without the usb device and ubuntu (and mint 17.1) does not turn off completely. Well I am not a pro but i already used Linux distros enough and had never had so much trouble until try to install linux on this asus. The best way I could find to let Linux working more or less, was installing linux mint debian version and every time you turn on the pc you immediately press Esc key and then appears a small boot menu and you choose Linux that it install.( i don't know well how it is written because it has been a while). With this you can use the linux, but for example, screen brightness controls do not work but now turns off completely is possible! As I say, not everything is working 100% but is working! Try waiting for the ubuntu 15:04 to see if it is already improved compatibility, but for now you can try this method.\n\nA: The current link to Ubuntu-certified hardware is here: https://certification.ubuntu.com/\nAsus no longer appears to be participating, which means it will be hit or miss, or you'll need the full component spec list and go through it all one by one to ensure it isn't Windows-specific hardware.\nOlder/established model lines tend to do better, in general, as it has given time for open source developers to create drivers and get them into the mainline kernel.\nIt would be nice to have a definitive list of hardware manufacturers who are supportive of Open Source, and to what degree? (e.g., 3 levels: open source hardware (and software), open source software/drivers, or proprietary binaries for open source platforms (e.g., nVidia)) but I am unaware of anyone maintaining such a list.\nJust having that list would be an element of market pressure that could help manufacturers see the value in supporting or adopting open source philosophies.\n", "Q: FGLRX disturbs TTYs and Plymouth graphics I just installed Ubuntu Trusty on my new SSD, enabling UEFI, which was disabled previously. After the installation finished (and I finally found a workaround for a strange HP UEFI, which denied booting Ubuntu), I noticed the following problems during Plymouth's animation and when switching to\nTTY1-7:\nEach screen line is shifted to the right relative to the one above, like you can see in the image below. This results in an ugly boot splash and barely usable (only if I know the commands by heart) TTY.\nThis only appeared after installing fglrx. Before, when using xserver-xorg-video-ati, everything was fine.\nHas anyone experienced this before? How can I fix it?\n\nImage: TTY1 filled with a hexdump\n\nDevice: HP ProBook 455 G1\nOS: Ubuntu 14.04 64bit\nFGLRX Version: 2:13.350.1-0ubuntu2, installed via Additional Drivers\nEDIT: Now using FGLRX Version 14.301.1001, installed from ATI installer, problem persists.\nEDIT2: Video modes listed by videoinfo (former called vbeinfo):\nAdapter `Bochs PCI Video Driver`:\n  No info available\nAdapter `Cirrus CLGD 5446 PCI Video Driver`:\n  No info available\nAdapter `EFI GOP driver`:\n* 0x000 1366 x  768 x 32 (5464)\n  0x001  800 x  600 x 32 (3200)\n  0x002 1024 x  768 x 32 (4096)\n  0x003  640 x  480 x 32 (2560)\n\nI tried every one of these, the only one that worked was 0x002 1024x768. But how can I enable 1366x768 without the distorted screen?\n\nPS: I previously used Ubuntu on the same computer, but without UEFI and on a HDD. Then it worked, too\n\nA: Turns out is is some strange incompatibility with fglrx in HP's UEFI BIOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I only use Legacy BIOS, the bootsplash is shown correctly\n\n*If I use UEFI BIOS with Legacy support, the bootsplash is always 1024x768, no matter which resolution\n\n*If I only use UEFI BIOS, the screen is distorted, as seen above, except when I choose 1024x768.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no fix for this (except using Xorg's driver) (And I can't even do a BIOS upgrade, because the exact same computer model is needed, but with Windows, to create the upgrade EFI file... VM's don't work)\nUpdate: After a BIOS update, the problem does not occur anymore once the fglrx/radeon driver is actually loaded, so by embedding it in the initramfs, the problem can be circumvented easily.\n\nA: This is a known problem with FGLRX. \nTo fix it, you need to edit your boot settings.\nIn a terminal, run:\nhwinfo --framebuffer ## Depreciated, use videoinfo instead!\n\nIt should spit out a lot of numbers. Choose the resolution that you want (usually the highest). Remember the corresponding code!\nNow, reboot. In the GRUB menu, edit the entry and add vga=0x1234 between quiet and splash, where 0x1234 is the code from above. If it works, then simply open up a terminal and type:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nLook for the CMDLINE_DEFAULT. It should have the same quiet splash in it. Now, after splash, put the VGA code, like so: quiet splash vga=0x1234. \nSave and exit from nano and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\n(src)\n\nA: Have you to enter this in the terminal or drop shell from recovery:\n update-grub \n update-grub2\n Plymouth-upstart-bridge\n grub-install \n grub-mkconfig \n\nand then enter this from the terminal:\n sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop \n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu and elementary? I want to dual boot Ubuntu and elementary on the same drive,  but keep the home,  swap, and boot partitions separate.   Will this prevent applications from accessing the other OS (I want to isolate Ubuntu so that it's  \"clean\")?   How can I set this up so that I don't accidentally install Ubuntu into the elementary partitions?   For reference,  I'm using the \"something else\" option for both installs where I create my own partitions. \n\nA: There's nothing you preventing you from creating separate partitions for your data using gparted or the partitions tool in the Ubuntu/Elementary installer. You can't prevent yourself from overwriting a partition, but you can give it a helpful volume label so you know what each partition is. If you'd like applications on the other OS to not be able to access your data, you can use the \"Encrypt my home folder\" option when prompted by the OS installer - just keep in mind this also means if you ever forget your password, you won't be able to recover your data without the key provided during setup, so proceed with caution.\n", "Q: how to list or change name to HDD in nautilus In Ubuntu 12.04, I have added three old HDD after formatting and encrypting them with disk util. \nThey work fine, no issues of functioning, however I don't know how to change the order they appear in the left pane of Nautilus. \nI see this:\n500GB Encrypted.\n320Gb Encrypted. \n320GB Encrypted.\nI don't use them very often but when I do I have to try the password for each one before i get the right pass with the right disk. \nSo let's say I want to list them by size, can it be done before I try the password? \nOr, instead of \"500Gb Encrypted\" can it be changed to something else?

To install from the terminal, execute sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get install luarocks, or install from the Ubuntu Software Center, by searching for luarocks\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if you've updated your package index files lately, maybe some of the files you're looking for have been removed or renamed from the source, hence the \"file not found\" error. Try an sudo apt-get update first. \nOr maybe the particular source (us.archive.ubuntu.com) doesn't have that file for some reason, if update doesn't work you could try switching to a different source/mirror? The Software & Updates program/settings can change those, and like Charles Green mentioned make sure you've got the universe checked. Those settings can also be changed directly in the files /etc/apt/sources.list and in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ if you're feeling adventurous (though make a backup first just in case)\nAnd when new to linux I preferred using Synaptic for searching & installing, easier than a terminal for looking through results with multiple windows & scrollbars imo.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14 compatible with Asus Slate EP121 with Touchscreen?

In the meantime you could try a different desktop environment and see if it still happens, like xfce, or lxde, or kde, or cinnamon, or mate, or just a different window manager like fluxbox... \nUbuntu has different live iso's for different desktop envirnoments, like Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu... \nIf others show the same corruption then maybe you need a specific or updated graphics driver which could be hard to do or impossible when running a live iso (can't reboot and save changes, though persistence might work). You could try a different distro, one based off of Ubuntu like Linux Mint should be very very similar to Ubuntu, or one not even based on Debian (like fedora, suse, slackware, could be very different.\n", "Q: When I create a file on the desktop,it create in /root/desktop not /home/desktop When I create a file on the desktop,it create in /root/desktop not /home/desktop,how can I fix it?\n\nA: If you're logged as a normal user, say, chris, your desktop will be at /home/chris/Desktop, not /home/desktop.

I have searched to web and am now so confused I don't know what to do. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: Did you use Simple Scan? \nIf you don't press \"New Document\" but keep on scanning using the button with the scanner icon, you should be able to save all pages in a single file.\n\nA: I had this same issue, and I downloaded and now use PDF-Shuffler.\nPDF-Shuffler will allow you to quickly and easily merge those separate individual files into a single PDF document.\nAlso, you can take multi-page PDF documents and split them any way you like just as easily by deleting individual pages.\nOnce you have added or removed the necessarily individual pages and your file is the way you want it, then you can save your work as a new file.\nOne thing to be aware of is that PDF-Shuffler is totally free (slash awesome), and as such it has just a few minor limitations: the more pages you merge into a single file, the longer processing time the software takes...be patient...the software is working.\nAlso PDF-Shuffler seems to max out at around 500 megabytes per single file, so if you had more than 12 pages...say something like 75 pages or more...and the finished product was something like 650 megabytes, then you'd have to split that document into two parts like document part \"A\" with ~500 megabytes and part \"B\" with ~150 megabytes (or however you wish to divide the data).\nAnd if you're working with PDFs or any imaged documents, then I also recommend you check out ImageMagick (http://imagemagick.org/) because I use PDF-Shuffler in conjunction with ImageMagick in order to produce my finished product for my job.

Here's a screenshot of my partition table in Gparted.\n\nNow I want to add another linux OS. I wanted to resize the /dev/sda3 and take 40GB for my new OS. But if I try to create a new partition after resizing, I am getting the error,\n\n\"It is not possible to create more than 4 primary partition.\"\n\nI know that I can't create more than 4 primary partition and this looks like I'm in a corner. I created the initial partitioning from windows and didn't give much thought about Primary/extended partition.\nNow my question is what should have I really done so that this problem doesn't happen? Was I supposed to create /dev/sda3 as extended partion and /dev/sda4 under it? Will that solve all the problem related to adding extra OS when needed?

I think if you didn't already have an extended partition you would have to delete one of the 4 existing partitions first, and then create an extended partition in the free space.\nBut, it appears that you already have an extended partition, so you should just need to shrink one of the partitions (sda3 as you suggest) to make more free space adjacent to the extended partition (sda4), and then resize the extended partition (sda4) to include the free space, and create another partition (inside the free space, inside the extended partition). If you're not currently running linux from (or have mounted) a partition you should be able to shrink it with gparted but if it is mounted and it's something important that won't unmount you can use gparted from a live cd/dvd/usb.\nOr if you're worried about windows's files and don't want to shrink it with gparted, windows should know how to shrink its own partition if it's sda3 (though windows will undoubtedly call it something different) and leave the free space to resize the extended partition with gparted.\nIt's hard to read but it looks like there's a /tmp partition, that sounds like a good candidate to delete if you didn't have an extended partition and still needed to delete one, and then recreate the /tmp partition, though it might require a little recofiguring of linux/ubuntu to find /tmp again.\n\nAlmost forgot, but in the future if you wanted to avoid all this \"limit of 4 partitions\" nonsense you can make the first partition an extended partition using the whole disk, and create every partition as a logical partition inside the \"main\" extended one. I think I heard somewhere there used to be problems with dos or old windows where they had to have at least one \"primary\" partition, but that's probably not an issue anymore.\nOR you could not use MBR (master boot record) partitioning at all, and instead use GPT (GUID Partition Table) it has a limit of 12x partitions and disk sizes up to 18EB (I don't even know what an EB is offhand, but I'm sure I don't have 18 of them ;-)\n\nA: You have 4 primary partions used .. three ntfs and one extended(extendable).\nSo yes, partion 3 as extended would have been nice.\nNow, resizing one of the ntfs would leave you with empty space .. if it's adjacent to your extended partition, you could then resize that.\n\nA: I don't see the unallocated space.  But yes, using parted to move your extended partition boundaries and then to recover the partitions inside.  note where they are supposed to be.\n", "Q: Chrubuntu 14.04 WINE install unmet dependencies Okay, I understand that there have been quite a few solutions to this problem.

Can Firefox add-on damage to the system? why no need root access to install them?\n\nA: Browser install plugins inside the user's home directory and are only in use for that user. \n\nCan Firefox add-on damage to the system? \n\nYes. But there are a few things to consider.\n\n\n*\n\n*plugins tend to be downloaded from the browsers's own homepage and as of today we can trust Mozilla. Downloading them from random sites is a Windows mentality we should all avoid.\n\n*problems tend to come from bugs in those plugins.\n\n*as long as your \"sudo\" password is safe problems tend to be local (ie. related to that user; not the whole system).\n\n\n\nWhy no need root access to install them?\n\nNow you seem to misunderstanding something. Plugins requiring sudo that would be WORSE than a plugin without needing sudo. If the plugin has a keyboard logger and a method to  send what you type to the owner of the plugin... \n\nA: Firefox add-ons should not damage the system, depending on two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*You got the addon from https://addons.mozilla.org/ (not including install links in the description)\n\n*It has been fully reviewed by Mozilla, not preliminary reviewed:\n\n\nIf a addon has only be preliminary reviewed:, it should have a install yellow install button to differentiate it from fully reviewed addons.\n\nThe reason not root access is the addon is installed in your Firefox user profile in your home area - this is inside a hidden folder in ~/.mozilla, e.g. ~/.mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXXX.default. The profile Firefox uses on startup is configured in ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini, and get be edited by closing firefox and running firefox -P. Note your user profile contains your browsing data, bookmarks, web history, addons etc, so if you delete it because of an addon you will likely lose the other information\nTo disable an extension, press Ctrl+Shift+A, open 'Tools'>'Add-ons', or enter about:addons into the address bar.

How do I get the pid of that new session just created if the browser was initially closed?\n\nA: effectively, what you want is opening a new url in a window without closing the current window manually (if I understand well), nor having to close tabs manually.\nBasic solution\nThe solution could be to run a command that combines two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a new window from the command line with the url as argument\n\n*automatically close the current window\n\n\nThis way the pid of the browser will not change, and you would not have to manually close tabs and/or windows.\nThe small script below does exactly that, using firefox. The reason to use firefox is that (e.g.) chrome has multiple pids by definition, making the process more complicated.\ninstalling wmctrl\nThe script uses wmctrl to find and close the current firefox windows, you might have to install it first:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport socket\nimport sys\n\nurl =sys.argv[1]\n\ndef get_info(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n\ndef run_command(command):\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\ncurrpid = get_info(\"pidof firefox\")\nbrowserwindow = [l.split()[0] for l in get_info(\"wmctrl -l -p\").splitlines() if currpid in l]\nrun_command(\"firefox -new-window \"+url)\nfor i in browserwindow:\n    run_command(\"wmctrl -ic \"+i)\n\nHow to use\nCopy the script into an empty file, save it as firejump.py. Open a firefox window (any address, just a window) and run the script by the command:\npython3 /path/to/firejump.py <new_url>\n\nDisable warning to close the current window\nFor the procedure to run without the annoying firefox warning that you are closing the current tabs or windows: disable the warnings by unticking it in the preferences:\n\nMore advanced solution\nIf you really need to jump over a list of thousands of url's, it might be useful to extend the script a little (see the script below), and let it automatically jump to the next url from a list, that you created in a text file, and run the script with a key combination to jump to the next url.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty texfile, save it as jump_list.py\n\n*create in the same folder a text file, named (exactly): urls.txt\n\n*fill the file with your urls, one per line:\nwww.something.com\nwww.another_thing.com\nwww.yet_another_thing.nl\nwww.itshardtostop.be\n\nand so on\nOpen a firefox window (any address, just a window).\nNow when you run the script, firefox opens the first url.\nRun it again and it will jump to the next url and so on, until the last url of the list has passed.\nExplanation\nThe script reads the lines in the file urls.txt by index. It keeps track of the (last used) index in a file that the script creates in the script's own directory. Every time the script runs, the number is increased by one until the last line is reached.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport os\n\ncurr_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n\ndef get_info(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n\ndef run_command(command):\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\ndef write_totrack(file, next_url):\n    with open(file, \"wt\") as wrt:\n        wrt.write(next_url)\n\ndef read_file(file):\n    with open(file) as src:\n        return src.read()\n\nkeep_track = curr_path+\"/\"+\"next_visit.txt\"\nurl_list = read_file(curr_path+\"/\"+\"urls.txt\").splitlines()\n\nif not os.path.exists(keep_track):\n    next_url = \"1\"; index = 0\n    write_totrack(keep_track, next_url)\nelse:\n    index = int(read_file(keep_track))\n    next_url = index+1\n    write_totrack(keep_track, str(next_url))\nif index < len(url_list):\n    curr_url = url_list[index]\n    currpid = get_info(\"pidof firefox\")\n    browserwindow = [l.split()[0] for l in get_info(\"wmctrl -l -p\").splitlines() if currpid in l]\n    run_command(\"firefox -new-window \"+curr_url)\n    for i in browserwindow:\n        run_command(\"wmctrl -ic \"+i)   \nelse:\n    pass\n\nRun the script by:\npython3 /path/to/jump_list.py\n\nAdd it to $PATH\nMore elegant would be to save the script to ~/bin, make it executable, remove the language extension and run it by the command:\njump_list\n\nAdd to Shortcut Keys\nTo really make it comfortable, add it to a shortcut combination: System Settings > \"Shortcut Keys\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\"\n\nA: I have an idea for the alternative solution: You can check with\n\nps -ef | grep chrome\n\nthe process number of the running chrome session. With\n\nkill [process number]\n\nyou can kill the process. Hope it works for you.\n", "Q: Luarocks version I'm new to Linux and am attempting install the newest luarocks version. I'm currently running version 2.0.8 (after running sudo apt-get update) which isn't sufficient for some of my needs. Is there a way to specify the version to install? (Also: I'm running this Linux version through a VM)\n\nA: So, you got Luarocks from the previous question, but you want a newer version.  I checked the Luarocks homepage, and found their instructions to be pretty good, and did the install on a VM in my home machine - it worked!\nHere's the steps:\n1)  Download the newest version of Luarocks from the download page at http://luarocks.org/releases/.  Get the file luarocks-2.2.0.tar.gz\n2)  In the ~/Downloads directory, where I am assuming your webbrowser placed the tar.gz file, you will need to unpack file file.\nOpen a terminal windows (ctrl+alt+t) and first ensure that you have the tools to build programs:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nNow change to the download directory, extract the Luarocks source files and change to their directory:\ncd downloads\ntar -xvf luarocks-2.2.0.tar.gz\ncd luarocks-2.2.0\n\nDown for the configure, build and update\"\n./configure\nmake build\nsudo make install\n\nYou done!  If you enter luarocks at this point, it will confirm that you are on version 2.2.0\n\nA: In this case there is no possibility to specify a Version. But you can use\n\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nto update all your packages to the newest Version, luarocks too.\nAnd if you dont have luarocks installed yet, you can do it by typing:\n\nsudo apt-get install luarocks\n\nThat should installiert the newest Version, which is available in the ubuntu package sources.\n\nA: Googling \"luarocks ubuntu\" brings up the packages.ubuntu.com website, where you can see what versions of programs are on what ubuntu's... Precise has version 2.0.8-2 ( http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/luarocks ), trusty & utopic have 2.0.9-1, vivid has 2.2.0+dfsg-1 ( http://packages.ubuntu.com/vivid/luarocks ). Each new & older version is (currently) in the top-right \"[lucid][precise]...\" links on each page, and under the \"Download luarocks\" heading in the bottom left you can download the .deb files(s)\nYou might not have enabled the \"backport\" or \"romeo/proposed\" packages in the Software Sources, they might enable a newer version. And if there are multiple versions available you can use \"=version\" with apt-get install package=version or using Synaptic \"Package -> Force Version\" and \"Lock version\" to keep a particular package from being changed.\nIf you're running linux in a VM anyway it might not be hard to download & run vivid.\nOr you could try downloading the newer .deb package file(s) from the websites above, and install from the command line with dpkg -i though they may require some other upgraded packages that aren't in your current ubuntu, which you may also need to try to download & upgrade manually.\n", "Q: How can I install Windows 7 alongside Ubuntu I am currently using the latest version of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nI would like to install windows 7 alongside with Ubuntu.
