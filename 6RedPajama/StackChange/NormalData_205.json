["Q: Installing Adobe Photoshop with Wine : OS requirement not met I followed the steps in this post : How can I install photoshop cs6 on ubuntu 14.04?\nEverything went fine until I got stuck on Step 3 because of a requirement issue in the installation process. The installation probably detects my OS is not a windows one and desactivates the Install button as shown in this picture.\n\nIs there a way to circumvent this verification step? Any other advice to help succeed in installing Photoshop with wine? (I'd rather install with Wine than use a windows virtual machine)\n\nA: Unfortunately, in Wine, WinXP tends to be the current 'OS' to set up with on a default setup.  So, we need to tell Wine to emulate a Windows 7 environment instead of a Windows XP environment.\nFirst, close the Photoshop installer completely.  Next, run winecfg.  In the \"Applications\" tab, where it says \"Windows Version\", select Windows 7 from the drop down.\nRestart the installer, and it should help fix it and it'll see Win7 instead of WinXP.\n", "Q: How to get the PID of my script?

If this doesn't solve the problem go to tty1 again, log in, and type sudo apt-get install --fix-missing -> again, some dependencies might not be resolved. \nNote 1.\nOnly after I wrote this I thought that you may not have an internet connection since you've never log in and connect to a network.\nIn order for this to work you will need to connect to a network with internet access. So I'll try to describe to you how to connect to an WiFi network but you can check it here for more info about both WEP and WPA/WPA2. I won't copy and past it here but I'll add a few notes with some output. I've done some research and I couldn't find a way to connect to a WPA/WPA2 network without installing wpa_supplicant so I can't really help with that. ( if someone knows how to fill free to edit this )\nConnecting to a WEP Network\nFirst of all, you will need to check the name of your wireless card using iwconfig. This will give an output similar to this:  \n$ iwconfig\n    eth0      no wireless extensions.\n\n    wlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:off/any  \n      Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=15 dBm   \n      Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n      Power Management:off\n\n    lo        no wireless extensions.\n\nIn this case, the card name is wlan0 but it can be different in your case so check your output for the one that don't say: no wireless extensions.  Also remember that, although not explicit in the link I shared, you will need to run almost all commands with root-level permission so don't forget to append sudo to the beginning of every command ( or just log in to root using sudo -i ).\nHope it helps somehow. \n\nDon't forget to up vote if you found this useful. \n", "Q: Folder permissions to certain folder I want to be able to only allow a user read/write permissions to a certain folder, and not any of the parent folders\nso for instance\nmywebsite\nCan only access /var/www/html/mywebsite\nAnd not /var/www/html/otherwebsite\nI have tried:\nchown -R www-data /var/www/html\nchown -R mywebsite:www-data /var/www/html/mywebsite\nchmod -R 770 /var/www/html\n\nThe problem I am getting is that when logged in to mywesbite I don't have read write permissions to the mywebsite folder, or any other folder for that matter\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: To give user mywebsite read/write permission inside /var/www/html/mywebsite:\nchown -R mywebsite /var/www/html/mywebsite \n\nThat should be sufficient.  You should not have to alter group owner or permissions because the user owner should be given read/write permissions already.\nIf you wanted to grant a group read/write permission inside that folder, say, group my-group, you'd need:\nchgrp -R my-group /var/www/html/mywebsite \nchmod -R g+w /var/www/html/mywebsite\n\nImportant notes\n\n*\n\n*Don't set the ownership (either user or group) of files within /var/www to the www-data user.  The point of having the web server run as the www-data user is that this is an unprivileged account, unable to modify any files.  If you set some files to be owned by this user, you are negating that security measure.  If you need your web server to be able to modify certain files, only set ownership for those particular files and be very careful not to allow direct execution (eg via PHP) of them.  In general, never set it so that www-data can modify files.\n\n\n*When doing a recursive chmod, it is often better to use letters than numbers, eg chmod -R g+w something rather than chmod -R 770 something.  This is because the former is able to modify only the permission you want, and leave the others.  By default, directories and files will have different \"execute\" permissions - files will have it off (eg 644) and directories on (eg 755) because this permissions has a different meaning for directories.  If you do chmod -R 770 something then regular files will have execute permissions turned on.  In general it's a good idea to only modify what you need.\nAnother thing to note is that 770 would remove the world-readable permission, which will prevent the web server (which runs as an unprivileged user) being able to read it.  In this case it's also preventing the user mywebsite being able to see the /var/www/html/mywebsite directory at all, because you've set the parent directory /var/www/html to 770.\n\nA: What I did on Ubuntu 16.04 (for my future reference too):\nsudo groupadd web-content                 # creates a new group 'web-content'\nsudo usermod -a -G web-content myuser     # adds 'myuser' to the group\nsudo usermod -a -G web-content www-data   # adds 'www-data' to the group\nsudo chown -R myuser:web-content /var/www/html          # changes owner to 'myuser' and 'web-content' group\nsudo find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \\;   # applies rw for myuser and r permissions to all files\nsudo find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \\;   # applies rwx for myuser and rx permissions to all directories\nsudo systemctl restart apache2.service    # restarts the apache web service\n\nPlease let me know if this is not secure or sensible.\n(Note.

My wireless is a bit buggy on Ubuntu, every now and then the DNS will cut out for no reason, and I'll need to run sudo restart network-manager to actually fix it.\nHowever I just upgraded to 15.04, and after experiencing the DNS problem again I tried to restart network manager- however, I was greeted with the error \nrestart: Unable to connect to Upstart: Failed to connect to socket /com/ubuntu/upstart: Connection refused\nI saw another AskUbuntu question which said the problem was related to systemd vs upstart, and that to fix I could reinstall upstart. I did so, using the command\nsudo apt-get install upstart-sysv\nHowever this did not seem to fix my not being able to restart network manager.\nMy question is twofold- if necessary, how can I roll back the changes I made to my system by installing upstart, and how can I make so that I can actually restart network manager?\nAlternatively, I'd accept some help with solving my DNS errors, but historically no one has really been able to help me with that.\n\nA: The service management system has changed.\nEvery system management toolset has own utilities.  The utility that you are used to using is one of the ones that come with upstart, which is a trivial shim for initctl restart.  But this is Ubuntu version 15.  You aren't using upstart any more. \nYou're using systemd, and the service control commands are subcommands of systemctl rather than of initctl.  So services are started with systemctl start, stopped with systemctl stop, enabled with systemctl enable, disabled with systemctl disable, queried with systemctl status, and restarted with systemctl restart.\nupstart was already there.\nUpstart was already installed on your system.  Otherwise there wouldn't have been its restart program to run in the first place and you wouldn't have even seen its error messages.  It simply wasn't running as the active system management system.\nInstalling the upstart-sysv package is using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.  You can switch to upstart on the fly from the GRUB menu.  Doing that in this case wouldn't have got you into the mess that you are in now, where you now want to switch back.  Indeed, switching to upstart at all is using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut, when all that you really needed to do was learn the systemd commands, which aren't that different from the initctl ones.\nThe Release Notes say that installing that package has removed two others.  So fairly obviously you need to install those two others again.  ☺\nkillall is yet another sledgehammer.\nAs the name suggests, it doesn't discriminate, and just kills everything by a particular name.  You don't need this, even with upstart.  Both systemd and upstart track exactly which processes they need to kill in order to restart services, and only those services, because they spawned the processes in the first place.  If you have even halfway-decent service managers on your system, then you should never be approaching things with killall.  Just use the commands that are provided by the service management toolsets.\nOn similar grounds, sudo NetworkManager is another clanger.  That will start NetworkManager in the wrong execution context.  Again, use the service management toolset's commands for starting dæmons.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Lennart Poettering (2013-10-07).  systemctl. systemd manual pages.  freedesktop.org.\n\n*James Hunt and Clint Byrum (2014).  \"Utilities\".

Do not install upstart and run upstart commands to manipulate services unless you really know what you're doing. If you have upstart installed, I'd recommend uninstalling it.  \nTo restart network manager as non-root, since it runs as a daemon process:\nsudo killall NetworkManager && sudo NetworkManager\nshould work fine\n", "Q: Boot ubuntu not recognize pendrive I have installed on my notebook ubuntu 14:04, as I am new to ubuntu, just damaging the etc folder then decided that it would re-install the system.

I'm trying to use the Gnome Color (default Color app in /usr/bin/gnome-control-center.real color) to manage my laptop's color profile. However, only some of the color profile actually change the display colors! \nFor instance, PJD7820HD, E551i-A2, EQ276W HDMI, Projector, DVX-3150, D65 and Swapped Red and Green (!) all display the same colors. Whereas Blue, D50, and D55 are the only profiles that change the display colors. \nWhy is it that some of the profiles work, but some don't? I noticed that in the description for Blue, it says it works by \"altering the video card lookup table\" - maybe this is what D50 and D55 do as well. \n\nA: I believe that it's the difference between calibration and characterization profiles described here: What's the difference between calibration and characterization?\nMore info here: Missing information for whole-screen color correction?\n\nUnfortunately, many vendor-supplied ICC profiles do not include the information required for whole-screen color correction. These profiles can still be useful for applications that can do color compensation, but you will not see all the colors of your screen change.\n\nYou can also see that in all of the profiles that do change your screen color that the \"Display correction\" in the View Details window is \"yes\" where in the profiles that don't change it are \"no\".

You have to install a different hybrid bootloader called  \"rEFIt\" which is a boot menu and maintenance toolkit for EFI-based machines like the Intel Macs. You can use it to boot multiple operating systems easily, including triple-boot setups with Boot Camp. It also provides an easy way to enter and explore the EFI pre-boot environment.\nJust be careful while you wipe the Mac HDD to not to use the all space. I had my old mac mini (early 2006) which does not support the internet recovery and I made it working with Ubuntu however now it's almost a brick, since it doesn't boot into ubuntu (after latest update) and doesn't recognize the latest installation media.

Edit: --------\nWhatever the second problem was, it was fixed somewhat using the EasyRE utility after using gdisk to copy over the backup GPT - at least enough to get back into Windows to grab my documents. I now have three partitions instead of the former two, though. A ~400GB C: with most of the important things; a 600MB D: called \"Recovery\" filled with \"recovery\" related things I think created by Windows, though could have been EasyRE using Windows tools; and a 400MB blank (though apparently 9/10 used according to Windows - Ubuntu shows the hidden files) E:. Ubuntu also shows a 315MB FAT \"SYSTEM\" partition. So I lost my former D: drive. I will try to figure out why over the next week, would of course appreciate any ideas. \nUbuntu notes I have two blocks of \"Free Space\": 599GB and 134MB. I assume recovering what was in its place before (D:) would be difficult.\n\nA: First, the Common Internet File System (CIFS) is a network protocol, not a filesystem used on a hard disk. Thus, your attempt to mount the disk with CIFS was doomed to failure from the start. (You might use CIFS to access the same disk from another computer, but not locally.) Most Windows partitions use NTFS, which Ubuntu mounts using the NTFS-3g driver.\nSecond, using ntfsfix on the disk was also doomed to failure. Despite its name, ntfsfix doesn't actually fix anything significant; it does a few trivial checks and then marks the filesystem as requiring attention by Windows. Thus, if anything this step will make matters worse, since it might block attempts to access the filesystem from Linux. Also, it's not clear why you tried /dev/sda6 with both mount and ntfsfix. Did you get that device ID from a disk utility, did you remember it was the correct device, or what? This is exactly the sort of technical information needed to help solve your problem.\nThird and most importantly, the error message you report refers to the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which is a data structure a level above that of the filesystem. Thus, attempts to fix the filesystem are misplaced, at least at this stage. (It's like trying to bake the flour and eggs before you've combined them in the cake recipe.) Instead, you must look for a way to repair the partition table. Fortunately, GPT includes redundancy, so repairing it may well be possible. You've presented insufficient information to provide step-by-step instructions on doing so, though, and there's no simple set of data you could provide that would change that fact. There are any number of things that could be wrong, so from here on it must be a process of diagnosis and steps taken in response to things you learn, not a recipe.\nTo start, I recommend you read the following pages, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*The GPT fdisk \"What's a GPT?\" page\n\n*The Wikipedia page on GPT (you can actually skim most of this, but pay attention to the layout of data on the disk and the difference between the protective MBR, the two GPT headers, and the two partition tables)\n\n*The GPT fdisk documentation on repairing problems\nBe patient! If you skip the first two pages and rush in to the third, your knowledge will be incomplete and you'll likely just make a hash of things. Once you've read these pages, you should be able to use gdisk to investigate your disk and, with any luck, repair it.\nIf you can't fix the disk with gdisk, you may be able to use TestDisk to search the disk for filesystems and create a partition table that describes what it finds. This is definitely a utility of last resort, though.\n", "Q: Where is the guide to port Ubuntu touch to cyanogenmod based devices? This guide on developer.ubuntu.com tells how to port ubuntu to android based devices.

When connecting the display, the external monitor one mirrors what is on the builtin display. I need it to function as an additional screen.\nI have searched for a monitor mirror option in the BIOS, but there is no such related function in the BIOS.

With previous versions of Ubuntu, to install a new theme it would suffice to copy it to the ~/.themes folder. If I do the same on Ubuntu 15.04 the theme never shows up the Unity Tweak Tool or the Appearance tab of the Settings tool.\nWhat is the correct procedure on Ubuntu 15.04?\nUpdate: I have tried various things following the suggestions from Sadi below. I am able to install themes with these two procedures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Directly from a PPA (e.g. apt-get install);\n\n*Compiling from source and then issuing something like sudo make install.\nSo far no theme copied directly into ./~themes or /usr/share/theme ever appears in the tweak tools; irrespective of folder permissions.  \n\nA: The themes listed in System Settings... > Personal / Appearance / Theme are usually none other than Adwaita, Ambiance and Radiance that come with Ubuntu.\nYou can install other GTK themes (including Window themes) via some PPAs or manually.\nPPAs usually install such themes under /usr/share/themes but you can also manually install themes by also copying files to ~/.themes (or ~/.local/share/themes) as well as copying them to /usr/share/themes using root privileges as PPAs do, and in either way you should be able to see and select them in Unity Tweak Tool or Ubuntu Tweak.\nNote: It might also be a good idea to create a symlink for /root/.themes to have GTK2 apps use the same theme also when running as root if you put your theme at ~/.themes.\nLately Ubuntu has begun using the unity sub-folder under a theme for window control buttons (Close/Minimize/Maximize) but it still requires the   metacity-1 sub-folder containing at least a file named metacity-theme-{NUMBER}.xml - otherwise the theme will not be listed.\n\nA: To install themes in Linux, you can use Unity tweak tool Unity which is available in Software center.\n\nExtract the theme file that you want to install.After extracting theme file, open terminal and move extracted folder to /usr/share/themes.\nsudo mv path-of-extracted-theme-folder /usr/share/themes\n\nWhen you have moved folder, open Unity tweak tool that you installed before.

Both are PAE capable, but the Banias CPU doesn't advertise this via the CPUID.\nTo work around this issue, a patch was included in the linux kernel from version 3.15 on. This patch recognizes the Banias CPU and, in conjunction with forcepae, enables PAE on these CPUs.\nHow to boot a PAE kernel on Pentium-M\nAt the boot menu screen the options are\n1.Install  \n2.Command-line options  \n3.Advanced options  \n4.Help  \n\nWith the cursor on the top choice press F6.\nA menu with a number of options appears.

This is a change from older installs where only one parameter was sufficient. The change applies to Ubuntu Server 14.04.2, 15.04 and later (although it will do no harm to use it on early releases).\nTechnical note: After booting, dmesg | grep -i pae will now show PAE forced!.

I installed the 64-bit version of Ubuntu 14.04 for the first time, and I think it is heavier than the 32-bit version. While it was installing it got stuck. I tried four times to install. \nIs it true that Ubuntu does not get very many updates? Does installing less software and updates help to keep the system running smoothly and fast?\nMy system has these specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel-E5700 processor\n\n*ASUS P5G41T-MLX3 motherboard\n\n*4 GB RAM\n\n\nI know it is old and slow. My question is this: \nDo I have to change it to 32-bit for my PC to work faster?\n\nA: 64bit is typically faster but does use slightly more RAM. If you are running into a situation where 64bit addressing is using up all your RAM, that could be an argument for using 32bit.\nThat said, 4GB of RAM is plenty for a typical desktop. Therefore the issue you are seeing is likely nothing to do with the architecture and probably something else (a wonky driver, hardware fault, etc).\nAnd that said, trying 32bit might not hurt. It's monetarily free and the only real cost is the time it takes to download and install. There's no other way to switch between architectures. \n\nA: Having very similar system specs (P5G41M, E5300, 4GB RAM, 1GB GT610 card, 25GB swap partition) I have found that, especially when used for gaming, the 32-bit version of Ubuntu 15.04 runs a bit smoother than the 64-bit, but this is just based on personal observation.\nWhen it comes to updates and drive space, yes, the less you clutter up your hard drive the more efficient your system will be. I have a 500GB hard drive with about 195GB free and am considering upping my storage to 1TB+ in the near future for that reason. Keep in mind, though, that updates are meant not only for feature additions but more often than not are bug fixes which will also help your system run more smoothly.\n\nA: In general, if you have enough RAM, 64-bit is preferred. But in some cases it is not true. For instance, I have an old laptop with Intel Core 2 Duo CPU T5450. It supports 64-bit operations. But it appeared that not very well. 32-bit systems run much better with this CPU. Technical details why this happens may be found in the net. But this is applicable only to some old cpu's where 64-bit operations were not made well yet.\n\nA: First of all 64-bit is not like 32-bit at all:\n\n*\n\n*The 64-bit version is faster and reads all the existing RAM in your computer, ensuring you can use it all.\n\n*The 32-bit version is not as fast. It reads only up to 3.2 GB of RAM in your computer. So even if you have more it won't be used.\n\nWhat is difference between 32 bit and 64 bit\nAbout why your PC runs slow:\nYou may consider your PC not that powerful. So you might want to try Lubuntu or Elementary OS, for example. Such a lightweight derivative will be easier for your PC to run. In particular, they don't feature such a heavy graphical interface, so you don't need as good of a graphics card.\n", "Q: ls discrepancy with du df output Adding up the sizes of files and directories returned by ls gives a different value than that given by df or du. The df and du commands give me the same output, so I don't have that frequent problem, but I know that this was an \"empty\" device/folder so I wanted to know why that \"not empty\" used space. \nMy first thought was about hidden files, so I searched around and I found the -a option but the figures don't add up yet [24.4 KB from ls -lah is very different from 5.1 MB with df and du: output at the end of the message].

It shows the size used to store the metadata describing the directory. That size will depend on the number of files in the directory and the length of their (and the directory's) names, and not on their sizes. To illustrate, I will create different numbers of empty (0-size) files:\n\n## 10 files\nfor i in {1..10}; do touch foo/$i; done\n$ ls -l\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 terdon terdon 4096 May 11 16:36 foo\n$ du -sc foo/* | grep total\n0   total\n\n## 100000 files\n$ touch foo/file{1..100000}\nls -l\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 terdon terdon 2801664 May 11 16:37 foo\n$ du -sc foo/* | grep total\n0   total\n\nAs you can see above, the size reported by ls changed, despite the actual size of the directory being the same. \nSo, your missing files are probably in the lost+found directory, check there.    \n", "Q: 3 monitors (vga, dvi, hdmi) recognized, but no image on HDMI So far, I have used VGA and DVI monitors on NVidia GeForce 650 card and all worked flawlessly.

Like you're experiencing, the third monitor will be recognized, but trying to enable it either won't work, or it will disable the non-main (secondary) monitor. It's not a driver problem or a problem with Ubuntu, it's just not possible.\n\nA: It was not an issue with a graphics card. I checked and it supports 3 monitors at the same time. And Ubuntu DOES support this (14.04).\nIn my case, BenQ did not automatically recognize which cable was on so I had to manually set that input is coming from HDMI. \nI now have image on all 3 monitors and all is working flawlessly. \n", "Q: Keeping old Gnome 2 while upgrading to newer versions I turned an old PC into a server by installing Ubuntu Desktop 10.10 some time ago, and I really love it, but it's outdated and I think it's time for an upgrade.\nIt's specs are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Core 2 Duo E6850\n\n*2 GB Ram 800 MHz\n\n*40 GB IDE HDD (the only spare I had)\n\n\nMy problem is that only the GUI from 10.10 which I believe is Gnome 2.32, offers VNC which works without problems, and is lightweight enough not to lag my server.\nHow can I upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 and also keep the old GUI? \nShould I install Ubuntu Server and then the GUI? If so, how?\nI am basically looking to install Gnome 2.32 on a newer Ubuntu version.\n\nA: Well GNOME 2 is completely obsolete, and has been since 12.04, but you can get GNOME 3. Ubuntu MATE is a sub-distro of Ubuntu which aims to bring back the old GNOME interface. It's not going to be exactly the same, but it is very similar. \nUbuntu MATE 14.04 ISO \n\nA: You have many disparate issues here I want to address.\nUbuntu Server is (as far as is important for your use) just Ubuntu without the graphical desktop packages installed. That is to say, if you want a clean install of Ubuntu Server with a graphical desktop, you might as well just install the Ubuntu spin for that desktop (eg Ubuntu Mate, Kubuntu, etc) and then install things like LAMP (or whatever server tasks you need) with tasksel or Apt.\nThe Ubuntu desktop of the 2010 era is long gone. It moved onto Unity. If you upgrade the ubuntu-desktop metapackage will pull you onto Unity. You could just uninstall those packages before upgrading (and run an apt-get autoremove) and then install whatever -desktop metapackage (probably mate-desktop) when you're done upgrading the core system.\n10.10 has been dead for years. As has 11.04 and 11.10. You'll need to upgrade through all of those to get to 12.04 and from there you should be able to LTS-hop to 14.04. That's another reason for getting rid of any non-essential packages (less to upgrade).\nHonestly, I'd be weighing up whether it's not best to back-up and do a fresh install of Ubuntu Mate (or whatever desktop spin takes your fancy - there are many now). It'll be much faster for you and will likely leave you with a better result.\n", "Q: How to list photos by date in folders?

Currently I have installed Lubuntu 14.10 on my EEE PC 701, but I am thinking of upgrading to Lubuntu 15.04. Do you recommend to upgrade to Lubuntu 15.04 and why? \n\nA: Lubuntu 14.10 is not an LTS release. It is supported 9 months. So less than in 3 months the support will be dropped. So it is recomended to upgrade. If you do not want to upgrade frequently consider installng an LTS release. It is supported for 3 years. Current LTS release is 14.04.\n\nA: Your 14.10 release will go end-of-life (no more support) in July - I would recommend upgrading to 15.04 before that date.  15.04 is also not a long term release, and will go end-of life in January 2016.\nI would also recommend making a backup of your data before trying to do an upgrade\n\nA: Support for 14.10 will end July 2015. \nI would advice to plan your upgrade before supports end.

Your best bet would be to modify this post on how to mute audio when your headset becomes disconnected to send the Multimedia Pause key.\nBasically, a file (/proc/asound/card0/codec#0) will change depending upon whether or not headphones are connected.

To set it from command line, you only need two commands.\nRun in a terminal:\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/vsize 1\n\nto set the number of rows to one, and\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/hsize 4\n\nto set the number of columns to four\n\nA: Typically, the number of desktops and their relative locations are controlled using ccsm (Compiz Configuration Settings Manager).

This can be accomplished by making Apache the owner of the directory, for example, if the directory were called my-dir, you would open a terminal and run this:\nsudo chown www-data my-dir\n\n\nA: as stated on the Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file apart of those located in /var/www  .... This means that any directory or file you want to write to must be under /var/www. Missed this info myself and got my hair pulling for a while trying to write to /tmp etc.\n\nA: If you want to change all the folders and files within that directory, and not just the directory, add -R like so \nsudo chown -R www-data my-dir\n\n\nA: If you are creating the File on the fly and you do not want to save it on the server but instead download it on client computer after an action is triggered from client side e.g. like a button click from a User Web Browser, you can write the PHP code as follows;\n<?php \n\n$dataToWriteToFile = \"This Text has been saved in this Text File and Downloaded for you to View !\";\n$fileName = \"TxtFilename.txt\";\n\n$file = fopen($fileName,\"wb\");\nfwrite($file, $dataToWriteToFile);\nfclose($file);\n\nheader('Content-Type: charset=utf-8');\nheader(\"Content-disposition: attachment; filename=$fileName\");\n\nprint $dataToWriteToFile;\n\n?>\n\nDISCLAIMER: It will not work for those intending to write a file to server for archiving but for anyone else creating a file on the fly for purpose of making their client users download it to their web browsers it may suffice for that purpose.\nI was about to talk to my client to request them to allow the Apache user to add more rights to the Apache user (as is suggested by previous answers here and other related Questions on internet) to allow writing files to the folder where their server web pages are served from. I am almost certain this would have been an uphill task for them to agree to but luckily the above code worked for me. \n", "Q: Gimp does not start My gimp does not start, I get the following error:\ngimp\n/usr/share/themes/Yuyo-Dark/gtk-2.0/Apps/libreoffice.rc:40: Unable to locate image file in pixmap_path: \"Entry/entry-border-bg-solid.png\"\n/usr/share/themes/Yuyo-Dark/gtk-2.0/Apps/libreoffice.rc:43: Background image options specified without filename\n/usr/share/themes/Yuyo-Dark/gtk-2.0/Apps/libreoffice.rc:49: Unable to locate image file in pixmap_path: \"Entry/entry-border-active-bg-solid.png\"\n/usr/share/themes/Yuyo-Dark/gtk-2.0/Apps/libreoffice.rc:52: Background image options specified without filename\n\n\nA: Try simply reinstalling GIMP.

Every time I download an update for 14.04, I am unable to start Steam.  I get an error to the effect of \"OpenGL is not using direct rendering\".  \nUp until now, my way around it is to ignore the notifications and just wait for a new proprietary driver for my GTX 970.  Once a stable driver is released, I download the Ubuntu update, then manually install the new driver and everything works fine.\n(Thankfully, manually installing the proprietary drivers is a snap ever since 346.47.  Thank you NVidia!)  \nIs there another way to do this?  Can I just uncheck the OpenGL portions and/or something else when I download the 14.04 updates or will that cause other problems?  As of now, I am only doing 14.04 updates every couple of months.\nThanks.           \n\nA: I reinstalled the driver because it was the most expedient way to go about it.  The name, \"nvidia-346\" seems to refer to the names that the repositories give to the drivers.  The repositories don't work for the latest proprietary drivers.  I'm not sure whether I could enter \"NVIDIA-Linux-*-346.72.run\" rather than \"nvidia-346\".  \nFor future reference for anyone who happens to read this, the easiest way to install the latest driver is to download it from the Nvidia site.  From there, you hit Ctrl+Alt+F1.  Log in, then enter \"sudo service lightdm stop\".  Then \"cd ~/Downloads\" (or wherever else you put the file).  Next the commands are as follows:  \"sudo chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux--(version, in my case 346.72).run && sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux--(version).run\".  From there it's basically \"yes, yes, yes\".  The uninstall command is \"sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-*-(version).run --uninstall\".  It worked for me to say \"yes\" when it asked me to restore the previous xorg configuration and continue to uninstall normally.  Next, I entered the same install sequence of commands that I had originally entered and I was good to go.  (Apologies for my lack of knowledge of the appropriate ways to post this stuff.  This answer is by an idiot, for idiots :)  To summarize:  Do the update, uninstall the driver, then proceed with the normal installation commands for said driver.  Steam will work, everything will be updated, and life will be good. Cheers. \nEdit:  For some reason, the asterisk isn't appearing in parts of my final post.  The name of the file I downloaded is \"NVIDIA-Linux-(asterisk)-346.72.run\".\n\nA: I think it because of new kernel is coming with updates and some nvidia kernel modules are missing.\nTry to reconfigure nvidia driver after update, for example\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure nvidia-346\n\nWhere \"nvidia-346\" name of driver package.\nIf it not help just try to reinstall your current driver via \"sudo dpkg -i nvidia-346.deb\" (from folder with driver package if you downloaded it from external resource) or \"sudo apt-get install nvidia-346\"\n", "Q: \"Your PC ran into a problem\" and it never restarts I had the \"Your PC ran into a problem\" blue screen while I was using Visual Studio in Windows 8.1, and then I am never able to start Windows 8 again.

There are KDE4 applications and there are new KF5 applications.The KDE4 parts are looking the service menus from:\n~/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/\nand\n/usr/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/\nThe new KF5 service menus are at:\n~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/\nand\n/usr/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/\nTo get the KF5 service menus to the KDE4 applications the KF5 service menu directory can be linked to the KDE4 directory.\n\n..and there are the KF5 service menus with the Dolphin (KDE4).\n\nMore of the Dolphin: https://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?67996-Bug-275405-Dolphin-ignores-file-association-for-scripts-but-executes-them\n\nA: In my installation of Kubuntu 15.10 solution is bit different. Copy only service menus is not enought.\nDesktop files are in the right place ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/ and /usr/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/, but ingored. \nThe solution is to copy plugin .desktop file to the new place too: from /usr/share/kde4/servicetypes/konqpopupmenuplugin.desktop to /usr/share/kservicetypes5/konqpopupmenuplugin.desktop\nScript to finally fix this:\n# Copy Service Menus and symlink old and new place\ncp -r ~/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/* ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/\nrm -rf ~/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus\nln -s ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus ~/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus\n\n# Copy main plugin file\nsudo cp /usr/share/kde4/servicetypes/konqpopupmenuplugin.desktop /usr/share/kservicetypes5/konqpopupmenuplugin.desktop\n\n\nA: I had the same problem as Peter Petrovich on Kubuntu 15.10. I solved this one using a hard file system link without copying. Thus, you do not break backward compatibility:\nsudo ln /usr/share/kde4/servicetypes/konqpopupmenuplugin.desktop /usr/share/kservicetypes5/konqpopupmenuplugin.desktop\n\n", "Q: 14.04.2 LTS booting to black tty screen after i was forced to hard restart I attempted to restart my Lenovo T400, and my laptop just sat there on the desktop, not responding. so after a hard restart, there was this error that there was some sort of error with my \"temporary folder\". i thought nothing of it and skipped whatever setup or fix it was attempting to do. now my system boots up to the ubuntu screen, but then goes straight to this black TTY/Kernel screen. tried a couple options off of here to no avail, and I've only seen one problem that's remotely similar to what I'm seeing here..\nCtrl+Alt+F7 takes me to a blank black screen and nothing happens.\n\nafter logging into my username, it tells me:\n\"no talloc stackfram at ../source3/param/loadparm.c:4864, leaking memory\"\n\n\nA: Ok that is good.  The talloc error sometimes is fixed as below.\nsudo apt-get purge libpam-smbpass\n\nIt is related to pam authentication on Samba Shares\nNow back to the other problems.  It appears that you may have a broken or misconfigured kernel.\nTry:\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n-f looks for missing dependencies\nIf all of that fails then reboot to recovery options on the grub screen and try an older kernel.\n", "Q: Completely unable to login I've been trying to add more security to passwords, etc.  I did the following things (in Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS)\nin /etc/pam.d/common-auth, added (as first line)\nauth required pam_tally.so onerr=fail deny=3 unlock_time=3600 magic_root\n\nin /etc/pam.d/common-password:\npassword [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so obscure sha512 minlen=14 remember=24 audit\n\nin /etc/login.defs\nPASS_MAX_DAYS 60 \nPASS_MIN_DAYS 1 \nPASS_WARN_AGE 14 \nLOG_OK_LOGINS yes\nSULOG_FILE /var/log/sulog \nSYSLOG_SU_ENAB yes \nSYSLOG_SG_ENAB yes\n\nI cannot log in from either the GUI or the text console.

So I think somewhere my DNS settings got messed up.\nAny pointer on resolving this issue is appreciated. Please, let me know if you need any more information.\n\nA: So I figured out what the problem was. When I ran the following command sudo resolvconf -u I got this error:\n/etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc: Warning: /etc/resolv.conf is not a symbolic link to /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf`\n\nI solved this error by deleting /etc/resolv.conf and recreating the symbolic link. You can do that using the following commands:\nsudo rm /etc/resolv.conf\nsudo ln -s /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\nsudo resolvconf -u\n\nThis resolved the DNS error I was getting.\nfor Ubuntu 20.04 and above, just\nsudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\n\n\nA: sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nSay yes to \"prepare /etc/resolve.conf for dynamic updates?\"\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: I had this problem when using NordVPN and using openvpn via terminal. I resolved this problem by importing VPN configuration file to Ubuntu Network UI. You can  go to Settings -> Network. There will be VPN section, press add and then import file. Choose one of the downloaded .ovpn files from NordVPN. Then when you try to connect it seems to automatically fix DNS issue for some reason. :)\nActually that's what I expected because sometimes UI solutions are more stable than running Terminal commands.\n", "Q: Different proxy servers to diferent networks I'm looking to a alternative to configure a different proxy each time that I connect to a different network.\nBy example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Network 1 (cable) - Servers - proxy 192.168.0.1:3128\n\n*Network 2 (wireless) - Lan - proxy 192.168.1.1:3128\n\n*Network 3 (wireless) - Client 1 - proxy 192.168.2.1:3128\n\n*Network 4 (wireless) - Client 2 - proxy 192.168.3.1:3128\n\n\nWhen I connect to 'Network 1', I need to change proxy configs on network manager to 192.168.0.1:3128.

However you can try to use a so called PAC (Proxy Auto Configuration) script. This works for programs that obey the proxy settings in Ubuntu or for programs that can be set independently to a proxy like Firefox. However you need to do a bit Javascript programming. Basically you can make the script to figure out to which network you're connected and let it select the appropriate proxy. A good site with useful information is here.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on a SSD and everything else on a HDD So I am looking into the future on getting a new computer, one with a 1TB Hard Disk Drive for everything and a Solid State Drive STRICTLY for Ubuntu, I did some research and found out that you have to move each program every time you install it or another one. \nI know that in Microsoft Windows you can put the OS on a Solid State Drive and everything else on a Hard Disk Drive (I believe the user files to). I am not aware what Ubuntu's \"Programs File(x86)/Programs File x64\" equivalent is since it... well does not seem to have one. \nI use Steam with a library of 2 to 4 games, 10+ virtual Boxes, a bunch of different programs, including Wine. Wile keeping the Solid State Drive all to Ubuntu (since the OS is read-only, I figured this would work well on a Solid State Drive without wear and tear off the Drive.) So how would I set something like this up? Even for guest users and other users.\nAnd how to install the OS properly to the computer to have the following confuration?\nP.S. What do people call that when you have a Solid State Drive as your OS Drive and a Hard Disk Drive as your storage?\n\nA: I have a SSD with with Sheerly Ubuntu and a 1TD HDD set up as a network share on my desko. I haven't had any issues with this setup so far. \nThe Equivalent to the Program files in Ubuntu is the /etc folder so you would need to format a disk with a mount point of /etc and the system would put that folder there to r/w from.\nfor you I would recommend putting your /home and /etc on an the separate drive. Also I don't think it's really called anything, You just DO that with your hard drives windows or linux. both user groups do it\n\nA: Choose the \"something else\"  option off the installer and create the appreciate mount points on each of your disks \n", "Q: How to find the size of a filesystem? How can I find out the size of a filesystem in Linux? By that I mean the exact number of bytes that are used from the partition, not just the output of df, as that can differ from the true size when compression or deduplication is used on the filesystem.\nThe size of the partition itself can be printed with:\n$ lsblk -b\n\nor\n$ blockdev --getsize64 /dev/sda\n\nI am looking for something similar for the filesystem.\nPS: This is for LVM grow/shrink stuff. I am mostly interested in ext2/3/4 and btrfs, but any other filesystem info is appreciated as well.\n\nA: It depends on the filesystem you want to investigate:\next2, ext3, ext4 file system\n\ndumpe2fs -h /dev/sda1 | grep '^Block'\n\nYou have to multiply block count and block size to get number of bytes.\nISO-9660 file system\n\nisoinfo -d -i ubuntu-18.10-desktop-amd64.iso | grep -A1 '^Logical block size'\n\nThe unit for volume size is logical blocks, so you have to multiply volume size and logical block size to get number of bytes.\nBTRFS file system\nAs one btrfs can include several devices, the command takes the mountpoint as argument\n\nbtrfs filesystem usage -b /mnt/mountpoint | grep 'Device size'\n\n\nA: For btrfs, you can use:\nsudo btrfs filesystem usage -b /mountpoint\n\n\nA: If you want filesystem information and not partition/volume information, I think you'll have to use filesystem-specific tools. \nIn the case of the extN systems, that would be dumpe2fs. And dumpe2fs doesn't directly print the size in bytes, as far as I can tell. It does, however, print the block count and the size of blocks, so you can parse the output instead:\n$ dumpe2fs -h /dev/sda1 |& awk -F: '/Block count/{count=$2} /Block size/{size=$2} END{print count*size}'           \n29999980544\n\nIn my case, this size is slightly different from the partition size:\n$ parted /dev/sda u b p\nModel: ATA ST500LT012-1DG14 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 500107862016B\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B\nPartition Table: gpt\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start          End            Size           File system     Name  Flags\n 1      17408B         30000000511B   29999983104B   ext4                  boot, esp\n 2      30000807936B   453049843711B  423049035776B  ext4\n 5      453049843712B  495999516671B  42949672960B   ext4\n 3      495999516672B  500102862847B  4103346176B    linux-swap(v1)\n 4      500102862848B  500107845119B  4982272B                             bios_grub\n\nThe partition size is 29999983104 bytes, 2560 bytes more than a multiple of the block size, which is why the size reported by dumpe2fs is less.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server Change Username I currently only have 1 user account on my ubuntu server. I would like to change the user name without creating another account. Is there a way to do this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You can manually change the contents of /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow and /etc/group.  Or you can use usermod command. Check the manual page for information on how to use them.\nThen you need to search and change the name in some configuration files under /etc/, I usually uses grep to do that, see manual page about how to use it. Don't forget to check and possible change the mail directory name in /var/spool/mail/.\nNotice that Linux only identify users and groups on the number values. Linux uses /etc/{passwd,shadow,group} to map between names and id numbers. So if you have two users with same uid value, the kernel will not be able to make any difference between them. For the kernel the user have two login names. Don't use this, as that is not supposed to work.\nMost applications store the user name and not uid. That is why you might need to change some configuration files with the old login name to use the new login name.\n", "Q: Tagging files, not just images How can I tag files in Ubuntu?\nI know how to tag images with shotwell, but I want to tag all files (text, audio, ...) not just images.\n\nA: I would check out Tracker Tags. It's been pretty legit for my purposes \nMaybe some more info on the Meta Tracker Ubuntu help page?\n\nA: You can use extended attributes.\nYou need the attr package.\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install attr\n\nCreating a tag:\nsetfattr -n user.foo -v bar yourfile\n\nListing tags on a file:\ngetattr -d yourfile\n\nFor GUI, you can use Eiciel\nYou can add Eiciel to Nautilus and Thunar using custom actions.\nFor searching, you can use Recoll\nHere is a good read:\nhttps://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html\n", "Q: What does `cat passwd | awk -F':' '{printf $1}'` do? What does this command do? How do I see that in the terminal because I don't have anything when I write cat passwd | awk -F':' '{printf $1}'\n\nA: cat passwd outputs the contents of a file named passwd in the current directory. The awk command then parses it, splits each line with : as the field separator and prints the first field.\nIf you don't get any output, either:\n\n\n*\n\n*there is no file named passwd in the current directory\n\n*there is a file, but it is empty\n\n*there is a file, but the first fields of all lines in it are empty (the lines begin with :).\n\n\nWhat the command presumably is meant to do is parse /etc/passwd. In which case, you can do:\nawk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd\n\nFurther, unless you want to restrict the command to local accounts, uses getent passwd instead of using the /etc/passwd file:\ngetent passwd | awk -F: '{print $1}'\n\n\nA: I assume this is a malformed command to extract all usernames from the system:\n\n\n*\n\n*cat passwd prints the output of the file passwd, presumably /etc/passwd.\n\n*awk -F':' {printf $1} separates the input (given by cat) using : as a delimiter and then only prints the first token, i.e. the username.\n\n\nIt doesn't work because /etc is not in the path variable by default, so the path would have to be given, not just the file name. Also, the result wouldn't be parsable properly, as awk's printf doesn't put newlines at the end, as opposed to print.\nThe IMO correct command would look like this:\ncat /etc/passwd | awk -F':' '{print $1}'\n\n", "Q: kcron not running commands When I add a new command to kcron it seems to work fine.

So, in awk, you could do:\ngetent passwd | awk -F: '$3 > 10 {print $1}'\n\n\nA: SOLUTION 1 :\nYou can use:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    [[ \"$(cut -d: -f3 <<<\"$line\")\" -gt 10 ]] && echo \"$line\"\ndone </etc/passwd\n\nConsidering you have no username containing :.\nIf you just want the usernames:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    [[ \"$(cut -d: -f3 <<<\"$line\")\" -gt 10 ]] && echo \"$(cut -d: -f1 <<<\"$line\")\"\ndone </etc/passwd\n\nHere we are reading each line of the /etc/passwd file and comparing the third field delimited by : (UID) to check whether it is greater than 10. If it is true, we have printed the line (or username in second script).\nThis would be much simpler using an array (thanks to muru):\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile IFS=: read -a line; do\n    [[ \"${line[2]}\" -gt 10 ]] && echo \"${line[0]}\"\ndone </etc/passwd\n\nSOLUTION 2 :\nUsing grep with PCRE:\ngetent passwd | grep -P '^[^:]+:[^:]+:(?!(?:\\d|10):)' | cut -d: -f1\n\n\n\n*\n\n*^[^:]+: will match the first field (username) including trailing :\n\n*[^:]+: will match the second field (password) including trailing :\n\n*(?!(?:\\d|10):) part is tricky, it is a zero width negative lookahead patern of PCRE (grep -P), it means there is no single digit (\\d) number or number 10 next, followed by a :. \n\n*cut -d: -f1 will just print the first field (username).\nAlternately, you can avoid the cut, by using the negative lookahead (?!) inside of the positive lookahead (?=) pattern (thanks to Avinash Raj) :\ngetent passwd | grep -Po '^[^:]+(?=:[^:]+:(?!(?:\\d|10):))'\n\nSOLUTION 3 :\nusing python :\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nwith open('/etc/passwd') as f:\n    print '\\n'.join([line.split(':')[0] for line in f if int(line.split(':')[2]) > 10])\n\nHere we are printing usernames if the third field is grater than 10. line.split(':') will split fields of each line on :, making it a list of fields.\n\nA: Using awk:\n awk -F: '{if ($3 > 10) { print $1 \":\" $3 } }' /etc/passwd\n\nthis will list all users with their associated UID where UID > 10.\nThanks to @sadi note, to list only usernames\nawk -F: '{if ($3 > 10) {print $1}}' /etc/passwd\n\n", "Q: bash shell script How do I write a bash shell script that requests the user's name, verify that it exists and, if it does, show the following information:\nUsername: xxxx\nUser ID: xxxx\nGroup ID: xxxx\nShell: / bin / xxx\nDirectory: / home / xxx\n\nI have this so far:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Ingrese el nombre del usuario\"\nread nombreUsuario\nid $nombreUsuario\n\nRESULTADO=\"$?\"\n\nif [ $RESULTADO = \"0\" ];then\n    id $nombreUsuario | tee salida.txt\n    echo \"id del usuario:\"\n    cut -f 1-1 -d\" \"--output-delimiter=\"; \" salida.txt\n    #asignar la salida de cut a una variable\n    UID=$(cut -f 1-1 -d\" \" --output-delimiter=\"; \" salida.txt)\n    clear\n    echo \"ID del Usuario: $UID\"\n\n    #quitar el texto UID\n    UIDUNICO=$(echo UID | cut -d= -f2)\n    echo \"ID del Usuario: $UIDUNICO\"\nfi\n\nBut that just shows the first part. How do I show the rest?\n\nA: Here's one way to get the gid, uid, shell and directory:\nprintf \"Enter username: \"\nread user\n\ngroupid=$( id -g $user )\nuserid=$( id -u $user ) \nusershell=$( grep $user /etc/passwd | awk -F':' '{ print $7 }' ) \nuserdirectory=$( grep $user /etc/passwd | awk -F':' '{ print $6 }' ) \n\n\nA: Here is a python solution:\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nimport sys\nwith open('/etc/passwd') as f:\n    for line in f:\n        if line.startswith(sys.argv[1] + ':'):\n            parts = line.rstrip().split(':')\n            print 'Username: ' + parts[0] + '\\n' + 'User ID: ' + parts[2].rstrip()\n            print 'Group ID: ' + parts[3] + '\\n' + 'Shell: ' + parts[6].rstrip()\n            print 'Directory: ' + parts[5].rstrip()\n\nYou can put all the print statements in a single line, for better view-ability i have put it in several lines. Save this as a file e.g. username.py. Run  the script giving the username as the first argument to the script. For example:\npython username.py foobar\n\nwhere foobar is the username.\nIf found the output will be like:\nUsername: foobar\nUser ID: 1000\nGroup ID: 1000\nShell: /bin/bash\nDirectory: /home/foobar\n\n\n\n*\n\n*line.startswith(sys.argv[1] + ':') will read each line of the /etc/passwd file to check whether it begins with the given username. The : will ensure that we don't select e.g. foobarspam while our input username is foobar\n\n*If so, then line.split(':') will make a list of fields (separated by :) of the line\n\n*Then we print out the desired indexed values from the list along with the appropriate string.\n\nA: If with \"the user's\" name you meant the username of the user running the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nread -p \"Username: \" username\nif [ \"${username}\" == \"${USER}\" ]\nthen\n    user_data=\"$(< /etc/passwd sudo grep \"^${username}:\")\"\n    echo \"Username: ${username}\"\n    echo \"User ID: $(<<<\"${user_data}\" cut -d: -f3)\"\n    echo \"Group ID: $(<<<\"${user_data}\" cut -d: -f4)\"\n    echo \"Shell: $(<<<\"${user_data}\"  cut -d: -f7)\"\n    echo \"Directory: $(<<<\"${user_data}\" cut -d: -f6)\"\nfi\n\nIf with \"the user's\" name you meant any username:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nread -p \"Username: \" username\nif [ $(< /etc/passwd grep \"^$username:\") ]\nthen\n    user_data=\"$(< /etc/passwd sudo grep \"^${username}:\")\"\n    echo \"Username: ${username}\"\n    echo \"User ID: $(<<<\"${user_data}\" cut -d: -f3)\"\n    echo \"Group ID: $(<<<\"${user_data}\" cut -d: -f4)\"\n    echo \"Shell: $(<<<\"${user_data}\"  cut -d: -f7)\"\n    echo \"Directory: $(<<<\"${user_data}\" cut -d: -f6)\"\nfi    \n\n\nA: Another bash way:\n#! /bin/bash\nread -p \"Username: \" user\n\nif IFS=: details=($(getent passwd $user))\nthen \n    printf \"Username: %s\\nUser ID: %d\\nGroup ID: %d\\nShell: %s\\nDirectory: %s\\n\" \"${details[0]}\" \"${details[2]}\" \"${details[3]}\" \"${details[6]}\" \"${details[5]}\"\nfi\n\nOne can, in a single step \n\n\n*\n\n*run a command, taking its output - $(getent passwd $user)\n\n*split the output on :, save the result as an array  IFS=: details=(...)\n\n*and use the exit status of the command for testing in if\nThen it's just a matter of printing the correct fields.\n", "Q: How can I mount an external drive with the permission to execute programs from it?

Sometimes trusty LTS, MaaS 1.7.3+bzr3363, Dell c6105s.  I boot new nodes, they are found, but no IPMI is detected.  Nodes fail in commissioning, even if set to WOL and powered up by hand.  I delete an old node from from MaaS, rebooted it, and IPMI info is found.  I grepped maas.log for IPMI and found no entries in the last 10 days.  I grepped pserv.log, and maas-django.log and found no instances of ipmi of IPMI.\nHow do I debug the ipmi enlistment process?\nWhat logs could I review/include to help determine the cause?\n\nA: The issue was that, as I was set up, my MaaS server did not have an APT cache.

My goal was to use this partition with Ubuntu's built in Deja-Dup backup utility. However, upon performing the first backup and pointing to my samba share, Deja-Dup errors out complaining that the there is not enough free space on the share. Here is the output of df -h on the pi:\n/dev/sdb3       1.7T  4.0G  1.6T   1% /media/SG_MEDIA\nClearly there is enough space. However, when I connect to the share via nautilus's \"Connect to Server\" in the sidebar, right click in the window, and select properties, it reports only 3GB of free space as seen here:\n\nClearly, this is not accurate. Anyone have any ideas of what is causing this? In my smb.conf file I have explicitly set max disk size = 0 and the problem persists. Thank you. \n\nA: For whatever reason, this is what caused the issue: \nI was sharing my root directory via samba and attempting to navigate through it to create the backup, i.e., backing up to smb://192.168.1.2/root/media/SG_MEDIA. This was what reported the 3GB free space.\nHowever, when I directly shared my connected HD, i.e., creating a samba share directly to /media/SG_MEDIA and backing up to smb://192.168.1.2/SG_MEDIA it reported the correct space. Can't say why.\n\nA: Hmm looks like each file is round-up to nearly 1MB.\nHere is an workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit smb.conf and add this:\n[global]\nallocation roundup size = 4096\n\n*Restart samba.\n", "Q: How to use a symlink in Apache Web Server I Installed Apache2.

For the sake of completeness, (and for my own future self googling this :-), I'll add all issues I've ran into and their solution:\n\nProblem: dispcalGUI does not detect the instrument at all\nSolution: Argyll CMS needs to be downloaded and installed manually, as stated in the first step of the dispcalGUI Quickstart Guide. After installing, run dispcalGUI, select File -> Locate Argyll CMS executables and locate the bin folder of your Argyll CMS installation.\nProblem: Calibrate & profile fails with Error - new_disprd() failed with 'Instrument Access Failed'\nSolution: Check if /etc/udev/rules.d/55-Argyll.rules exists. If not,\ncopy it from the Argyll install directory (or downloaded package). It\nis in the folder usb/. Then reboot the system or at the very least,\nunplug the device and plug it back in again. More info can be found in\nthe Argyll installation\nmanual.\nUSB 2 / 3\nApparently there might be issues when using some devices on an USB 3 port.\nIf possible, try switching it to an USB 2 port and see if this helps.\nIn my case it was not necessary, the Spyder5 runs fine on my USB 3 port.\nLast resort\nIf all else fails, you could run either Windows or OS X on a separate\npartition and do the calibration there using the vendor software. The\nresulting ICC profile is compatible across operating systems, so it is\npossible to import it to Linux.

However - even I pointed that the boot loader should be on /dev/usbdrive it still utilized the hard drive (and in such way mingled with the windows boot loader).\nI checked the following guide\nHow to create UEFI-only bootable USB live media?\nIt looks to me however that it is done on fat32\nThere is 1 main program that I need on this computer specifically and it is darktable. \nCan you point me to some guide that I can follow step by step please? My first attempt ended up with restoring the whole HDD (thanks to clonezilla).\n\nA: You could have removed GRUB from your hard disk pretty easily, just by deleting some files. That ship has sailed, though....\nThe easiest way to do what you want is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the Ubuntu installation media, but select the option to try Ubuntu without installing rather than the option to install Ubuntu.\n\n*Launch a Terminal window.\n\n*Type ubiquity -b or ubiquity --no-bootloader. The installer will run, but in such a way that it will not install GRUB.\n\n*Select options to install Ubuntu on your USB flash drive. Be sure to include a FAT partition on the USB flash drive that will eventually hold a boot loader. (550MiB is a good size for this; it should not be the whole drive, and it should not be your root partition.)\n\n*Install the boot loader of your choice on the USB flash drive's FAT partition. Install it as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on that partition. Personally, I'd use rEFInd for this purpose, since it's easy to configure and flexible; but as I'm rEFInd's maintainer, I'm biased.\n\n\nWhen you want to boot Ubuntu, insert its USB flash drive and use the computer's built-in boot manager to pick the USB drive.\nThere are other ways to achieve your main goal. For instance, you could set up rEFInd on your hard disk. Configure it to make your Linux kernel the default, with Windows as the second choice. When the USB flash drive is not inserted, Windows will boot; and when it is inserted, Ubuntu will boot.\n", "Q: Cannot SSH into home desktop I've installed openssh-server, I've edited /etc/ssh/sshd_config to look as follows\n# Package generated configuration file\n# See the sshd_config(5) manpage for details\n\n# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for\nPort 22\n# Use these options to restrict which interfaces/protocols sshd will bind to\n#ListenAddress ::\n#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0\nProtocol 2\n# HostKeys for protocol version 2\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\n#Privilege Separation is turned on for security\nUsePrivilegeSeparation yes\n\nAllowUsers jhallard\n\n# Lifetime and size of ephemeral version 1 server key\nKeyRegenerationInterval 3600\nServerKeyBits 1024\n\n# Logging\nSyslogFacility AUTH\nLogLevel INFO\n\n# Authentication:\nLoginGraceTime 120\nPermitRootLogin without-password\nStrictModes yes\n\nRSAAuthentication yes\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\n#AuthorizedKeysFile     %h/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n# Don't read the user's ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files\nIgnoreRhosts yes\n# For this to work you will also need host keys in /etc/ssh_known_hosts\nRhostsRSAAuthentication no\n# similar for protocol version 2\nHostbasedAuthentication no\n# Uncomment if you don't trust ~/.ssh/known_hosts for RhostsRSAAuthentication\n#IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes\n\n# To enable empty passwords, change to yes (NOT RECOMMENDED)\nPermitEmptyPasswords no\n\n# Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords (beware issues with\n# some PAM modules and threads)\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\n# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords\n#PasswordAuthentication yes\n\n# Kerberos options\n#KerberosAuthentication no\n#KerberosGetAFSToken no\n#KerberosOrLocalPasswd yes\n#KerberosTicketCleanup yes\n\n# GSSAPI options\n#GSSAPIAuthentication no\n#GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes\n\nX11Forwarding yes\nX11DisplayOffset 10\nPrintMotd no\nPrintLastLog yes\nTCPKeepAlive yes\n#UseLogin no\n\n#MaxStartups 10:30:60\n#Banner /etc/issue.net\n\n# Allow client to pass locale environment variables\nAcceptEnv LANG LC_*\n\nSubsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server\n\n# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,\n# and session processing.

There are three formats available:\n\n\n*\n\n*1.0: Specifies that the debian folder and any changes that need to be made to other files in the upstream package will be in a .diff.gz file. This results in a .orig.tar.gz that contains the upstream tarball and .diff.gz that includes changes/additions for packaging.\n\n*3.0 (quilt): Specifies that the debian folder in a .debian.tar.gz file, and that changes to the upstream files will be specified as separate patch files in the debian/patches folder, and will use the quilt patch system.\n\n*3.0 (native): Same as 3.0 (quilt), but for packages that won't have any patches because the software/program itself is made by the distributors (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.), and so any changes are made directly to the files.\nFor the last two formats, the versioning formats are different. 3.0 (quilt) expects the version number followed by -# or -#ubuntu#. Some examples of this are 2.7-1ubuntu3 (from Ubuntu's standpoint, this means that the package was imported from Debian, but has Ubuntu-specific changes on top of it) and 3.4-2 (from Ubuntu's standpoint, this means that the package was imported from Debian, but has no Ubuntu-specific changes).  Note that the version doesn't necessarily indicate whether there are changes made to the upstream tarball itself (patch files in debian/patches), or whether they're just changes in building the package.\nFor 3.0 (native), there is no dash after the version. Some examples of this are 23 and 8.4.\nIn your case, the version follows the 3.0 (quilt) format, but debian/source/format says 3.0 (native). There are two things you need to do here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change debian/source/format to 3.0 (quilt).\n\n*(Recommended) Make any changes to the package in a separate patch. Take a look at Ubuntu's patches folder for the syntax. Note that the series file specifies what patches in the folder should be applied and in what order. (lines starting with # are ignored)\nAs for the version of your package, using 32.0-0ubuntu5ppa1 will work (watch the underscores and dashes).\n", "Q: How to use the terminal on Ubuntu 14.04 to connect to remote bluetooth device?

I did not understand why it was not upgraded automatically...\n\nA: Kernels do not upgrade automatically to a next major version (like 3.13 to 3.16) through routine updates. You can do it manually by running\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-utopic\n\nYou can read about HWE stack.\nIf you want to install graphical stack from Ubuntu 14.04.2, then you can run\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-lts-utopic libqt5gui5 libgles1-mesa-lts-utopic libgles2-mesa-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic:i386 libglapi-mesa-lts-utopic:i386 libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-utopic\n\nHere is a good guide for that. \nThe Ubuntu Wiki command can remove a lot of useful packages. In some cases it removes ubuntu-desktop. So it is not good to run it.

It can be installed by\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\n\nA: Short answer\nIf you want to move to a newer series of generic kernel(called LTS Enablement Stacks ), you may run the following command for Ubuntu 14.04\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-utopic\n\n\nNote: It is important that you install all the packages mentioned in above command or you may break the system.\n\n\n\nLong answer\nUbuntu uses it's own set of modifed kernels known as generic kernels. They are based upon original releases by the linux team which you can see on https://www.kernel.org/.\nBut when you install a specific version of Ubuntu, it comes with some series of generic kernel(say the 3.13.x series) and it sticks to it. So whenever you update your system using the command\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nyou will update your kernel automatically but you will stick to the same series(3.13.x)\nIf you wish to move to a newer series of generic kernel, you have to do it as mentioned earlier.\nAlternately, you may want to install the latest kernel(with or without changing the current one) from https://www.kernel.org/.

Please do correct me, as I know I can be wrong.\nThanks in advance for all the help I have already found on the Ask Ubuntu forums.\nThanks and Regards\nAnkit\n\nA: The way you can do is here :\nhttp://tinyurl.com/mdpfzpo\nAlso you can read :\n\n*\n\n*For the first question this link might help you a little bit http://tinyurl.com/q6tm77t\n\n\n*If you'll install the bootloader on USB, then the USB will have to be always plugged in whenever the computer starts.\nThe link below could be also useful\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ozo5tz8\n", "Q: MAAS on Ubuntu 14.04 comissioning scripts fail I have 2 network one private network with private switch and another one connected to internet and a proxy\nI have 1 MAAS Server (Ubuntu 14.04) MAAS stable version 1.7\nthe 3 nodes fail in the same manner while being comissioned.\nThe UI shows the following scripts as failed:\nError output:\nfailed [3/7] (00-maas-03-install-lldpd, 99-maas-01-wait-for-lldpd, 99-maas-02-capture-lldp)\n\nWhen I look at my log I've got this :\n00-maas-03-install-lldpd.out\n\nReading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information...\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\n  libperl5.18 libsensors4 libsnmp-base libsnmp30\nSuggested packages:\n  lm-sensors snmp-mibs-downloader snmpd\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  libperl5.18 libsensors4 libsnmp-base libsnmp30 lldpd\n0 upgraded, 5 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 1144 kB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 4566 kB of additional disk space will be used.\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu/ trusty/main libsensors4 amd64 1:3.3.4-2ubuntu1\n  Could not connect to spike-dmz.aql.fr:3128 (192.168.194.50), connection timed out\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu/ trusty/main libperl5.18 amd64 5.18.2-2ubuntu1\n  Unable to connect to spike-dmz.aql.fr:3128:\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu/ trusty/main libsnmp-base all 5.7.2~dfsg-8.1ubuntu3\n  Unable to connect to spike-dmz.aql.fr:3128:\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu/ trusty/main libsnmp30 amd64 5.7.2~dfsg-8.1ubuntu3\n  Unable to connect to spike-dmz.aql.fr:3128:\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu/ trusty/universe lldpd amd64 0.7.7-1\n  Unable to connect to spike-dmz.aql.fr:3128:\n\n00-maas-03-install-lldpd.err\n\nE: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu/pool/main/l/lm-sensors/libsensors4_3.3.4-2ubuntu1_amd64.deb  \nCould not connect to spike-dmz.aql.fr:3128 (192.168.194.50), connection timed out\n\nE: Failed to fetch    http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu/pool/main/p/perl/libperl5.18_5.18.2-2ubuntu1_amd64.deb  \nUnable to connect to spike-dmz.aql.fr:3128:\n\nE: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu/pool/main/n/net-snmp/libsnmp-base_5.7.2~dfsg-8.1ubuntu3_all.deb  \nUnable to connect to spike-dmz.aql.fr:3128:\n\nE: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu/pool/main/n/net-snmp/libsnmp30_5.7.2~dfsg-8.1ubuntu3_amd64.deb  \nUnable to connect to spike-dmz.aql.fr:3128:\n\nE: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu/pool/universe/l/lldpd/lldpd_0.7.7-1_amd64.deb  \nUnable to connect to spike-dmz.aql.fr:3128:\n\nE: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/user_data.sh.jg10Bw/commissioning.d/00-maas-03-install-lldpd\", line 65, in <module>\n    lldpd_install(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/tmp/user_data.sh.jg10Bw/commissioning.d/00-maas-03-install-lldpd\", line 49, in lldpd_install\n    check_call((\"apt-get\", \"install\", \"--yes\", \"lldpd\"))\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py\", line 540, in check_call\n    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)\nsubprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '(u'apt-get', u'install', u'--yes', u'lldpd')' \nreturned non-zero exit status 100\n\n\n99-maas-01-wait-for-lldpd.err\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/user_data.sh.jg10Bw/commissioning.d/99-maas-01-wait-for-lldpd\", line 32, in <module>\n    lldpd_wait(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/tmp/user_data.sh.jg10Bw/commissioning.d/99-maas-01-wait-for-lldpd\", line 23, in lldpd_wait\n    time_ref = getmtime(reference_file)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/genericpath.py\", line 54, in getmtime\n    return os.stat(filename).st_mtime\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/run/lldpd.socket'\n\nit look like I've got a problem with my proxy or not ?\nSeems this is something trivial with someone with more experience in MAAS.

Windows 8 connects without problems. Anybody help(\n\nA: First, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly.

I'm playing around with a script to create a user across a number of machines. I'd like to not know the users password at any time, but having the public SSH keys is quite acceptable to me.

Use -maxdepth 1 to limit results to the current directory - but then find is overkill for this.\n\nA: If don't have to use the find command, using the test command (or its short form [...]) would be easier, IMHO. With test, the e switch does what you're looking for.\n#!/bin/bash\nread -r a\nif [[ -e $a ]]; then\n    echo \"You found the file\"\nelse\n    echo \"You haven't found the file\"\nfi\n\nBut be aware that test only looks for the file in the current directory, not in any subdirectories (thanks to EliahKagan for the reminder).\nYou can find a good overview about test at the Bash Hackers Wiki\n", "Q: Touchpad barely works after updates Hardware: Dell Laptitude E6410:AlpsPS/2 ALPS Dualpoint TouchPad\nUbuntu 14.04.2\nDid updates this morning and haven't used my touchpad until now. Just started using the touchpad and it barely works.\nWhen I say it barely works, here's what I mean.\n- Scrolling vertical and horizontal works perfectly\n- Clicking via the touchpad or the touchpad buttons works\n- Using the touchpad to move the cursor doesn't work\nThe touchpad barely moves. My sensitive is the same as before, and even moving it around does nothing. I have a nub in the middle of the keyboard and that works fine. Problem with the nub is I can't use it nearly as effectively. I'm very slow and I need my touchpad to work.\nUnfortunately, I don't know what updated this morning. There were 4-5 packages, but I'm not entirely sure which ones they were. Disabling the touchpad and reenable it doesn't fix the issue. Restarting Ubuntu doesn't fix the issue either.\n\nA: The touchpad driver is in the Linux kernel. You probably upgraded the kernel and there is some regression there. Try to boot with a previous kernel using grub menu and test, if touchpad works.\nIf this is the case you can upgrade your kernel to 3.16, which is default in 14.04.2 by running\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-utopic\n\nIt may help, if regression is not that fundamental and appeared accidentally in some kernel release.\nIf it still does not work, then it makes sense to report a bug at launchpad by running\nubuntu-bug linux\n\nOr if you previously installed some specific touchpad driver and upgraded the kernel, the driver may not build.\nYou can find this by running\ndkms status\n\nThere were some alps touchpad drivers in dkms format, that could be found in the net.\n", "Q: Linux mint 17.1 libgtk Hi i have problem while i want install gnome shell in linux mint ,iam using this command:\n\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell gnome-shell-extensions gnome-tweak-tool\n\nand its display this:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\ngnome-shell : Depends: libgtk-3-0 (>= 3.11.1) but 3.10.8~8+qiana is to be installed\ngnome-tweak-tool : Depends: gir1.2-gtk-3.0 (>= 3.12) but 3.10.8~8+qiana is to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nI cant install newer verision of libgtk.\nPlease help me how to install gnome shell!\nThanks!\n[Sory for my english]\n\nA: From this post at Linux Mint Community:\n\n\"Gnome isn't extremely compatible with Linux Mint.

I'll be working by myself on a website that runs on ASP.NET through mono on a xsp4 server. I'm new to linux and the ASP.NET framework so I'll try to explain things the best I can. To get things going I ssh into the server and change to the project's directory. From here I use git to pull any new changes. Next I use: \nscreen (or screen -r if one is already running) \n\nand run/restart the server by:\nsudo xsp4 --port 80\n\nI left last night with everything in working order and running, but when I visited the site this morning I got an error 403 access forbidden in the browser. I haven't changed permissions or edited files.\nI decided to ssh in and screen -r to stop the server but it said there is no screen to be resumed. In a new screen I tried to run the server but get this error:\nw@c:~/CRIME/CP-Web-l> sudo xsp4 --port 80\nxsp4\nListening on address: 0.0.0.0\nRoot directory: /home/webmaster/CRIME/CP-Web-l\nError: System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: Address already in use\n  at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Bind (System.Net.EndPoint local_end) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at Mono.WebServer.XSPWebSource.CreateSocket () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at Mono.WebServer.ApplicationServer.Start (Boolean bgThread) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at Mono.WebServer.ApplicationServer.Start (Boolean bgThread, System.Exception initialException) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at (wrapper remoting-invoke-with-check) Mono.WebServer.ApplicationServer:Start (bool,System.Exception)\n  at Mono.WebServer.XSP.Server.RealMain (System.String[] args, Boolean root, IApplicationHost ext_apphost, Boolean quiet) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n\nI don't quite understand how it could be in use if there wasn't a screen running. I'm also not sure how the screen disappeared overnight. Is it possible that there was a crash? \nThrough googling I found this post that had a similar problem, http://www.ubuntufaqs.com/questions/432605/xsp4-address-already-in-use-error-cant-run-mono-application, that gave 3 solutions. I don't think xsp is still running but I'm not 100% sure how to check. I thought that since the screen wasn't found that xsp wasn't running anymore. The directory isn't a root directory of another server. Would an error be thrown if xsp couldn't find the required assemblies in the mono path?\nI reverted the project back to a previous version and the same errors still exist.\nAre these two problems connected? If there is some information that I didn't provide that would be useful please let me know. Thanks!\nEdit (May 12, 1:48PM):\nFrom what I understand these are the things listening to port 80 but I'm not sure what they are:\nw@c:~/CRIME/CP-Web-l> sudo lsof -i:80 -n -P\nCOMMAND    PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nhttpd2-pr 1324   root    4u  IPv4  10644      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)\nhttpd2-pr 1795 wwwrun    4u  IPv4  10644      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)\nhttpd2-pr 1796 wwwrun    4u  IPv4  10644      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)\nhttpd2-pr 1798 wwwrun    4u  IPv4  10644      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)\nhttpd2-pr 1799 wwwrun    4u  IPv4  10644      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)\nhttpd2-pr 1800 wwwrun    4u  IPv4  10644      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)\nhttpd2-pr 3314 wwwrun    4u  IPv4  10644      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)\n\n\nA: So after a few days of no luck I decided to have the server admin reboot the virtual server.

If not, you better make a screenshot of you gparted window, then some specific directions can be made.\nAnd noone will give 100% guarantee that the data won't be lost. It is recommended to backup your data. But in most cases it works OK. It is your decision.\nBased on your information you can do it, but some moving is needed. Boot from Ubuntu LiveCD, start gparted, do not click any partitions, so they do not mount and do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click swap partition and disable swap. \n\n*Delete /dev/sda5 partition.\n\n*Delete /dev/sda3 partition\n\n*Extend your /dev/sda2 partition left. \n\n*Press apply button. It will take some time.\n\n\nWe removed your swap partition. It is too small to be relevant (165 MB). It is not needed this small anyway.\nNow run \nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nAnd remove the line with the swap partition and save the file.\nNow we are done. If you want to have swap, you can leave some space at the end and create a swap partition. Then you will need to add it to /etc/fstab file with UUID, which you can find in gparted same way as it was made before. Size of swap depends on you ram size, and maybe you don't need it at all. Anyway swap should be not less than 1GB. Smaller makes no sense at all.\n", "Q: Can't resize an OpenStack instance due Host key verification problem I installed OpenStack using openstack-installer's autopilot option.\nAfter starting an instance, if I want to resize it (i.e. change its flavor), this produces an error, the same if I try it with the instance turned on or off.

For example, when I am copying a file from my documents folder to an external USB, a small window labelled File Operations appears, showing progress etc. However, when I close Nautilus, it disappears and can't be accessed, even if I open Nautilus again. Is there a way that I can reopen it? I don't seem to have experienced this until I upgraded to Vivid.\nThanks\n\nA: Using Alt+Tab you should be able to go to the copying window.\nAlso, when you click on the \"file manager\" icon, a new file manager window will appear. Click again on the file manager icon and you should see a \"window spread\". One window is the file operations window.\nYou even have a third method: press Super+W and you see a window spread of all open windows, including the file operations window.\nSuper is the Windows / Ubuntu / Tux key on your keyboard.\n", "Q: Setup 3rd/4th level characters (typographic layout) When Ubuntu used GNOME, there was support for typographic characters on the third/fourth level, independent of input source (e.g. «English US» or «Russian»). As I've learned, in Ubuntu 15.04 the option for accessing alternative characters has appeared again under «Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Typing -> Alternative Characters Key». But there are no any alternative characters at all.\nHow can I setup 3rd/4th level alternative characters?\n\nA: In DConf (to edit it I've installed dconf-editor) go to org.gnome.desktop.input-sources. The target property is xkb-options. If «Alternative Characters Key» was already set to R.Alt, one could find 'lv3:ralt_switch' option in the list represented by this property. To enable typographic layout on 3rd/4th level one should add 'misc:typo' option. After this xkb-options will look like: ['grp:alt_shift_toggle', 'grp_led:scroll', 'lv3:ralt_switch', 'misc:typo'] and typographic layout will become enabled as well.\n\nUpd: Without dconf-editor it is possible to update xkb-options using gsettings like this:\n$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options\n['grp:alt_shift_toggle', 'grp_led:scroll', 'lv3:ralt_switch']\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \\\n\"['grp:alt_shift_toggle', 'grp_led:scroll', 'lv3:ralt_switch', 'misc:typo']\"\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch HTML5 app Orientation lock Can somebody tell me how can I fix my HTML 5 app into portrait mode only?\n\nA: Add the following line to your APP-NAME.desktop file:\n\nX-Ubuntu-Supported-Orientations=portrait\n\n", "Q: NTFS Disk with error in S.M.A.R.T I have a NTFS disk where I store my data, after a problem with a bad IDE/SATA adapter (who was shutting down my disk) the S.M.A.R.T is showing errors.\nI want to know what more I need to do to check and fix any error at this disk.\nI've used fsck to check the disk but its not verbosely to me.\n    andre@PITCAIRN:~$ sudo fsck /dev/sdb1\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\nMounting volume...

They may simply have become corrupt for example, due to sudden power loss in the middle of a write.  You can try to write zeros to them and see if they come back.  You will need to identify the sector numbers in question, which you can see from the error log there, the first one is 268435455.  First, try to read it to verify it is bad:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb bs=512 of=/dev/null count=1 iflag=direct skip=268435455\n\nIf this is a 4k sector drive, use 4096 for bs= instead of 512.  This should give an error.  If it does, write it with zeros:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=512 of=/dev/sdb seek=268435455 count=1 oflag=direct\n\nDouble check the command before hitting enter; if you don't get it exactly right, you can destroy data.\nRepeat this for each of the sectors in the error log, then check the SMART status again.  The pending count should go down.  If the reallocated count goes up, then the sectors were physically damaged and you should replace the drive.  If not, it should be fine.  You might try running the long SMART selftest to find more bad sectors.\n\nA: You've already done anything that's necessary to repair the drive. SMART is a monitoring system that is a feature of the hard drive controller, so the only thing the operating system does is showing the data collected by the SMART system. You can't reset it, so if SMART has detected something that is considered as wrong it will be remembered forever. Errors detected by SMART are not necessarily a sign of a failing drive, however it is possible that there is indeed something wrong. In any case make sure you create good backups which you should do anyway.\n", "Q: Can't flash recovery image I'm working about a month now on turning my BQ Aquaris E4.5 Android edition into an Ubuntu Edition.\nunfortunatly I always get this error:\n    2015/04/25 14:35:20 Device is |krillin|\n    2015/04/25 14:35:21 Flashing version 21 from ubuntu-touch/stable/bq-     aquaris.en channel and server https://system-image.ubuntu.com to device krillin\n    2015/04/25 14:35:21 ubuntu-touch/ubuntu-rtm/14.09 is a channel alias to ubuntu-touch/stable/bq-aquaris.en\n    67.41 MB / 67.41 MB [======================================] 100.00 % 1.70 MB/s \n    60.40 MB / 60.40 MB [======================================] 100.00 % 1.48 MB/s \n    286.68 MB / 286.68 MB [====================================] 100.00 % 2.94 MB/s \n    /root/.cache/ubuntuimages/ubuntu-touch/stable/bq-aquaris.en/krillin/version-21.tar.xz\n    /root/.cache/ubuntuimages/gpg/image-signing.tar.xz\n    /root/.cache/ubuntuimages/gpg/image-master.tar.xz\n    /root/.cache/ubuntuimages/pool/device-0142302186687e3e48e6987283f6caf5d471a4160f98aa6a3cb7658f96471297.tar.xz\n2015/04/25 14:37:18 Can't flash recovery image\n\nhowever, on my device screen (fastboot) it says: `Partition 'recovery' not support flash\nhow do I get around this and flash ubuntu-touch to it\n\nA: The Android version of the phone needs to be repartitioned before Ubuntu can be installed on it.\nYou can follow How to Install Ubuntu on bq Aquaris e4.5, to get your phone configured such that you can flash Ubuntu onto it with ubuntu-device-flash.\n", "Q: OpenSSH client not connecting after deleting id_rsa So I stupidly overwrote my id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files earlier, and I just decied to rm -rf the whole .ssh folder because it was all corrupted/broken after tinkering with it.

I want the first one to only copy files and not go into directories and copy. I just get the error \n\ncp: omitting directory '/var/www'\n\n\nA: By default, cp will not copy directories.  This protects you from accidentally copying too much.\n$ cp -v /var/www /var/www/dev\ncp: omitting directory `/var/www'\n\nTo override this default, supply the -R option:\n$ cp -vR /var/www /var/www/dev\n`/var/www' -> `/var/www/dev/www'\n\nThe reason that this was the only command that failed was that this was the only command that was missing -R.\n\nA: John1024's answer, does answer the question, however, I would argue that the reasoning is not wholly accurate. It is correct that, by default, the cp command will not copy directories, however the implication that this is primarily to protect the user from \"copying too much\" seems unlikely. \nUbuntu operates a Unix-style file system, which uses the concept of inodes to describe a filesystem object, be it a file or a directory. \nA directory is simply a list of names assigned to inodes. In that sense, the visual representation provided by the GUI is somewhat of an illusion, i.e. a directory is not actually a 'container' of other files, but rather a list of file names and inode pointers. \n.....a directory entry contains only a name for the associated file and a pointer \nto the file itself. This pointer is an integer called the i-number (for index \nnumber) of the file. When the file is accessed, its i-number is used as an index \ninto a system table (the i-list) stored in a known part of the device on which the \ndirectory resides. The entry found thereby (the file's i-node) contains the \ndescription of the file:...\n   — The UNIX Time-Sharing System, The Bell System Technical Journal, 1978\n\nFrom this perspective, we can see that copying a directory, would simply copy a list of names and associated inodes; this would be akin to creating a hard link to the directory. This is (probably) not the user's actual intention when copying a directory. In all likelihood, when copying a directory using the cp command, a user intends to make a physical copy of the actual data files within. \nTherefore, I would argue that using the -r option when copying directories, makes the command explicit. \n", "Q: No sound option except Dummy Output on Dell Latitude D630 I have a Dell Latitude D630. When I reinstalled Ubuntu 15.04 from a DVD after an update, it left my laptop inoperable. Now the only sound option under audio is \"Dummy Output\".

PulseAudio is supposed to be able to, for lack of a nicer term, \"hijack\" the sound card. However to to so requires that PulseAudio be the only program accessing the sound card directly.\nThe first thing I would do is try restarting PulseAudio using pulseaudio -k.\nIf there are other programs accessing the sound card, they need to either stop accessing the card, or be shut down. The best way to find out which programs are accessing the sound card is to run sudo fuser -v /dev/snd/*. You should see the names and PIDs of any programs using your sound card. If you see anything other than PulseAudio, you can shut it down using the kill command. Assuming the problematic PIDs are 12345 and 67890, you can use kill 12345 67890. If the programs accessing your sound card are being run by some user other than you, you may need to use sudo to run kill with root privileges.\nPS: The Arch Linux wiki has a very detailed article on troubleshooting PulseAudio. If none of the above works for you, maybe something there will.\n\nA: Try to boot from any of the Linux LiveCDs as @TSJNachos117 suggested in the comments.\nOn my Toshiba Tecra A8 I tried Puppy Linux 4.

My problem was, at the drop down, to install the linux loader, I kept checking the sdb which is my HDD. But my windows 8 loader was on my sda.\nEven though you want to put linux on a different hard drive than your other operating system, your loader has to be the same location as your original OS.

If you don't specify a specific file, it will look in its root directory (by default /var/www/html, but that can be changed).  There is a hierarchy of filenames it will look for, such as index.html, which is the default page you see.  However, you can specify a different filename in the URL, such as localhost/index.php, which will load the file index.php instead.  \nI believe Joomla uses index.php, so try that.  If Joomla were in a directory such as /var/www/html/MyWebsite, then you would enter localhost/MyWebsite/index.php to load it.\nApache itself doesn't need to know whether you are running a Joomla site, or a Wordpress site, or whatever; it just needs to know what file to load.\n", "Q: I need Ubuntu in dual boot with windows 8 I have installed ubuntu in windows8 .but dual boot is not showing. when i am starting system ,Ubuntu only getting starting. how to change in dual boot. i want get back windows8 and its files. please help out.

BTW, the \"undetectable\" DVD plays and is being detected in Windows.\nHave you found any solutions yet?\nIn the mean time, I'll look in other forums.\n", "Q: scripting a \"manual\" apt-get install of kept back packages TL;DR: is there a way to \"automatically\" install any kept back packages? I know that apt-get dist-upgrade is too blunt of an instrument.\nDetails...\nI have a bash script that runs (periodically) to keep Ubuntu Desktop VMs in a consistent state.\nIt does the usual apt-get update ... apt-get upgrade routine. Of course, there are the periodic kept-back packages.\nI have addressed this up to now by adding the kept back packages to a manual list of apt-get install <whatever was kept back>. I have started exploring a way to make this less manual.\nAbout the time I found myself (seriously) pondering how to refactor sudo apt-get -V upgrade | grep '=>' | grep -Ei '([A-Z]+(-)?)+' -o | sed 'N;s/\\n/ /;' for readability, it occurred to me that perhaps there is a better way. (yes... I hadn't quite fixed the bugs in that line either)\nThe horribleness above was an attempt to pull out the (unversioned) kept back package names in order to pass them dynamically to apt-get install.\nSo, is there a better way to identify the kept back packages and install them via apt-get install?\n\nA: I did more noodling on the problem (and learned lots more about sed along the way). I'm not convinced that this is the best way, but it is a way. If anyone has a better way to do this, please answer, and I'll happily take your answeer.\nsudo apt-get upgrade -s | sed -n '/back:/,/upgraded./p' | sed '1d;$d'\nThe -s option of apt-get upgrade indicates a dry-run rather than an actual install. I pipe the dry-run output text to sed, where magic happens. In sed, -n makes it quiet, so only what I tell it to print actually prints. The what to print is defined by a starting and ending regex. Start with a line matching \"back:\", and end with a line matching \"upgraded.\". The sed syntax was tricky at first... linuxcommando helped me grok the basic range-of-lines selection. That last p is telling sed \"ok... print now\".\nThe output of the first sed is something like:\n\nThe following packages were kept back:\nthing1 thing2 newthing3\n42 upgraded, 7 newly installed 1 to remove, and 3 not upgraded.\n\nI pipe that to another, simpler sed that drops the first and last lines (1d;$d). Note, there are ways to do line offset magic in the first sed, but I felt that made the single sed too confusing. I'm ok using a second sed, which leaves just:\n\nthing1 thing2 newthing3\n\nAnd those are the kept-back packages to manually install.\nkept_back_packages=$(sudo apt-get upgrade -s | sed -n '/back:/,/upgraded./p' | sed '1d;$d')\nsudo apt-get install $kept_back_packages -y\n\n(the -y is just an assume-yes for scripted apt-get).\nNote:\nwhen there are no kept back packages, this handles it all gracefully and does nothing. An empty string gets passed to apt-get install, and that's ok.\n", "Q: Is there a downside to installing all google fonts in Ubuntu? From the google fonts repo (github.com/google/fonts/) I installed all fonts by:\ngit clone https://github.com/google/fonts/    \ncp `find fonts -name *ttf` ~/.fonts\n\nThat worked and I can use all fonts from Ubuntu. I was wondering if there is a downside to installing too many fonts? Does the fact that I have almost half a gig of fonts now mean that they are all loaded to memory on boot or every time I open a word processor?\n~$ du -sh .fonts\n454M    .fonts\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit, number of fonts:\n~$ find ~/.fonts -name *.ttf | wc -l\n1691\n\n\nA: With about 1600 variants - I think bold, italic etc have a separate \".ttf\" file which were counted here, you will have about 400 fonts\nTo handle them all in the normal user interfaces for text input has some drawbacks:\n\n\n*\n\n*These font chooser interfaces are mostly linear, so it may take more time to find a font.\n\n*There may be performance problems with handling the fonts it the implementation is not expecting to handle this amount. That could be easily apparent, but it could also be in unexpected places, like seldom used programs or uncommon features. But overall, It's mostly a problem when font-related menus or dialogs open with a delay.\n\n*There will be fonts that you will not want to use ever. But you spend time scrolling past them every day, wasting time. And maybe there are times when you really only want to work with your three prefered fonts.\nThere is a tool that can reduce part of these problems, and make it quite feasible:\nThe tool that can manage groups of fonts, and activate or deactivate them - where deactivation means making them not installed, seen from the X font system, while the tool keeps track of them.\nIf, from time to time, you arrange the fonts that you will \"never\" use in a group, and others that you will \"normally not\" use, and disable these, you will hide lots of fonts over time.\n\n\n*\n\n*This reduces the long scrolling along useless fonts\n\n*Performance problems will be reduced, depending on the size of number of fonts kept active; Suspected cases of font-related performance issues can easily tested by changing between large and minimal active font sets.\n\n*You can keep away the fonts you will never use - not deinstalling them allows to change your mind for unforeseen reasons, and to check against th\ne list of names if you happen to get hold of a similar collection of fonts.\n\n\nA suitable tool to manage fonts seems to be font-manager.\nThere is also fontypython - which is quite powerful in it's features, but has a very convoluted user interface, so that I can not fully endorse it.\n\nA: The version of Font Manager in the Ubuntu repositories is very outdated, broken even.\nThere is a PPA which tracks the latest GIT.\nThis is the homepage.\n", "Q: WiFi Only works for short time I have dell Inspiron 15N Notebook, and installed Ubuntu 15.04 with gnome.

After t the name of the label follows. In your case it's the input filename without the leading t. sed therefore tries to jump to a label called est/sub2/configuration.php, which sed cannot find anywhere. The second expression s///g is never executed.\n\nA: The reason why your sed is not working was already given by chaos's good answer.\nLet me go a bit step further to indicate another way to loop through your file, since you are using some unnecessary steps:\nwhile IFS= read -r file\ndo\n    echo \"$file\"\n    if grep -q \"public \\$host = '127.0.0.1';\" \"$file\"; then\n        echo \"there's config file\"\n        sed 's/$host = 127.0.0.1/$host = localhost/' \"$file\"\n        echo \"changed to\"\n        grep \"public \\$host =\" \"$file\"\n    fi\ndone < \"test-paths.txt\"\n\nDifferences:\n\n*\n\n*You are using for i in $(cat test-paths.txt) (well, with backticks, but I don't know how to quote them). This is ok, but it is better to use a beautiful while loop doing while read line; do ... done < file. This way you read one line at a time. See a broader discussion about the topic in To read lines rather than words, pipe/redirect to a 'while read' loop.\n\n\n*Also, using backticks is deprecated. It is better to use $(), since it is possible to nest them. (In fact, we already observed this is even bad when posting an answer here :) )\n\n\n*There is no need to grep \"something\" and then check the $? status. You can directly use grep -q for this.\n\n\n*Some of these suggestions can be also found by pasting your script in http://www.shellcheck.net/.\n", "Q: Font Rendering Error I only have this issue with google chrome, everything is displayed okay in firefox.

You can install it by typing:sudo apt-get install keepalived\n\nhow do I make it available system wide?\nThanks, \n\nA: Read the manual!\nThe keepalived User Guide has had instructions for doing this since 2001.  Follow them.  The User Guide is considered out of date, but in fact only part 2 of the instructions are outdated.  Part 1 (./configure && make && make install as the superuser) is still valid.\nPart 2 is outdated because it addresses an old System 5 rc way of creating a keepalived dæmon service, and that for Fedora-style System 5 rc no less.  You're using Ubuntu Linux.  You've had upstart for years and you have systemd nowadays.\nsystemd\nFor systemd, write your own local service unit and place it (because it is a non-system non-packaged local-administrator unit) in /etc/systemd/system/keepalived.service.

Is it related to my fan making a lot of noise? I have two problems with my computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*The system is halting for short times intermittently so the computers becomes almost impossible to use for short times that can happen just when the computer has booted up, then after some usage the computer is usually behaving as normal. \n\n*The computer gets very noisy at times when the fan makes a lot of noise. \nAre the problems related? I ran the system test suite and it found no errors. Now when I run the computer with an external monitor and with the internal display turned off then my computer is seemingly working well for a long time (several hours) without a single problem. \nAre my 2 issues related? I went to a computer repair store to have the fan changed and they put in a new fan. still the computer is noisy from time to time, is it a problem with the builtin graphics? can I expect improvement now that I've disabled the internal monitor and I use an external monitor only?\nWhat could otherwise be the cause of the error? Could it be faulty RAM, the graphics cards or the harddrive? My computer is a Sony Vaio laptop and I've had it since 2012.\n\nA: It's probably a hardware problem, not a software problem, and the two problems in your question are probably related. \nWhen a computer fan gets old it wears out and the fan blades aren't mounted snugly on the bearings. This causes the fan to make noise and friction causes the fan to slow down, sometimes to less than half of its normal operating speed. The fan has to run more of the time to compensate and makes more noise. In addition, it can cause the processor to overheat, especially when the processor is working hard starting up the operating system.\nWhen you took the computer to the computer repair store, they diagnosed the intermittent hanging and the fan noise as being caused by a worn-out fan, which was a reasonable diagnosis, and so they replaced the fan, hoping to solve both problems, but the problem still remains unsolved.\nSince overheating can also cause intermittent hanging and excessive fan noise, plan B would be to check the aluminum heat sink on top of the CPU to determine if it is so clogged up with dust and debris as to be unable to effectively circulate hot air away from the processor. If necessary replace the aluminum heat sink or at least have it disassembled from on top of the processor, have it properly cleaned, remove the old thermal paste, apply new thermal paste and remount the heat sink on top of the processor. This painstakingly complicated procedure would normally be a job for a computer repair store, and it's easy to break something if you don't know what you're doing. Despite its being complicated, it doesn't take much time for an experienced technician to properly do it. Depending on the circumstances, it could even be done while you waited in the store. \nCircumstances being what they are with ordering computer parts, it may or may not be possible for the computer repair store to order a new aluminum cooling block for your laptop if you decide to go that route. The new aluminum cooling block normally comes with the fan securely mounted on top, eliminating the possibility of noise and overheating being caused by a bad job at mounting a new unmatched fan on top of an old cooling block. If the fan is not securely mounted on top of the aluminum heat sink, then it will vibrate and make noise, and the processor will overheat.\nI obviously don't know for sure if the aluminum cooling block is clogged up with dust, but at least it's something to check. Another thing to check is the processor temperature. Psensor is a graphical application for monitoring hardware sensors, including CPU temperatures, GPU temperatures and fan speeds. If the speed of a fan is slower than normal and that fan is spinning all the time, this is a good indication that the fan is starting to wear out due to friction on the bearings. \nYou can install Psensor with the command sudo apt install psensor.\n\nA: Another possibility is that it is a software issue. I had the same thing on my laptop. When it happened, I opened \"System Monitor\" and saw that one process was using 2GB ram and 100% of one core.\nWhat can I do to diagnose this?\nWhen it happens again, open the system monitor and check if some process is using a lot of ram or cpu. If this is the case, it is probably a software problem.\n(In my case it was the Anaconda sublime plugin. After removing that plugin, everything worked again.)\n", "Q: Error in dpkg-configure: Can not find file \"symbols/u\" in any known directory After upgrading to vivid, I keep getting this error for each apt-get operation or when running sudo dpkg --configure -a directly:\nSetting up keyboard-configuration (1.108ubuntu5) ...\nError loading new keyboard description\n/usr/bin/ckbcomp: Can not find file \"symbols/u\" in any known directory\ndpkg: error processing package keyboard-configuration (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\n\nThat is followed by a number of dependency problems like this:\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of console-setup:\n console-setup depends on keyboard-configuration (= 1.108ubuntu5); however:\n  Package keyboard-configuration is not configured yet.\n\ndpkg: error processing package console-setup (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of kbd:\n kbd depends on console-setup | console-setup-mini; however:\n  Package console-setup is not configured yet.\n  Package console-setup-mini is not installed.\n\nAll in all, that leaves the following packages unconfigured:\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n keyboard-configuration\n console-setup\n kbd\n console-setup-linux\n ubuntu-minimal\n xserver-xorg-core\n xserver-xorg-input-evdev\n xserver-xorg-input-mouse\n xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse\n xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\n xserver-xorg-input-wacom\n xserver-xorg-input-all\n xserver-xorg\n xorg\n ubuntu-desktop\n xserver-xorg-video-r128\n xserver-xorg-video-mach64\n xserver-xorg-video-radeon\n xserver-xorg-video-ati\n xserver-xorg-video-cirrus\n xserver-xorg-video-fbdev\n xserver-xorg-video-intel\n xserver-xorg-video-mga\n xserver-xorg-video-neomagic\n xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n xserver-xorg-video-openchrome\n xserver-xorg-video-savage\n xserver-xorg-video-siliconmotion\n xserver-xorg-video-sisusb\n xserver-xorg-video-tdfx\n xserver-xorg-video-trident\n xserver-xorg-video-vesa\n xserver-xorg-video-vmware\n xserver-xorg-video-all\n xserver-xorg-video-qxl\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI am not aware that I made any manual changes to the files involved or installed alternative versions of any of these.

For example:\nsudo kpartx -a ubuntu-15.04.iso\n\nWill give you additional devices under /dev/mapper like /dev/mapper/loop0p1, ... that you can mount.\nThis might not be needed in your case as to grow your partition, I suggest (do backup):\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=500 >> yourfile.ext4\n\nto append some zero at the end of your unmounted file. And then proceed to grow the ext4 fs with\nresize2fs yourfile.ext4\n\n", "Q: Install JavaFX scene builder 2.0 on Ubuntu 14.10 I am beginning my work on a JavaFX application for which I am using Intellij Idea ide. I have Java 8 installed on my system and I can see JavaFXSceneBuilder 1.1 in my system installed. But as I read in Oracle documentation, Java 8 comes with in-built scene-builder, unfortunately I am not able to locate it.\nBecause of that I see a page in the IDE for my scenebuilder even though I have provided path for 1.1 Below is the screenshot :\n\nHere is the path screenshot :\n\nSo, why do I see that blank guy there, how can I install Scenebuilder 2.0 recommended in Intellij Idea documentation for creating JavaFX apps. Kindly let me know. Thanks a lot. \n\nA: you can find your deb installation using following :\ndpkg-query  -S scenebuilder\n\nafterwards you can add it in intellij - it should look something like this:\n/opt/JavaFXSceneBuilder2.0/JavaFXSceneBuilder2.0\n\n\nA: So, if anyone has the same problem, go here and download SceneBuilder 2.0. Specify it in \"Scenebuilder path\" in Settings, restart the IDE, and it will work.\n", "Q: How do I get the IP address of joined unit in install hook? I am new to Juju and charms, trying out basic things.\nI am writing a charm(say client) which needs IP address of another charm(say server) in its install hook.\nBasically, I need the IP address of server and put it in a configuration file of client. But it won't be available in the install hook of the client. I added relation of client and server and $REMOTE-UNITand relation-set hostname=unit-get private-address public-address=unit-get public-address and server_address=relation-get hostname can be used.\nHowever, this doesn't seem to work. The IP address of server must be made available to the client whilst in the install hook, right? Since it's a one time config parameter.\n\nA: So, if I understand correctly, you want to install an application that needs a server ip in order to install correctly? What you basically have is a client that is \"useless\" without a relationship to a server.\nJuju is event-based. When an event is triggered, Juju queues all other events for that charm. The next even gets fired from the moment the previous one is done. The relation events will only get fired after the install event is completed. Technically speaking, the relation between two charms can only be added after the install hook of a charm finishes.\nIf you have a charm that cannot install unless it has a relation (unless it knows the \"server\" ip) then the install hook does nothing. The actual installation should happen in the relation-joined hook.\nSo implement this:\n\n\n*\n\n*install hook basically does nothing [1]\n\n*relation-joined hook gets the ip using relation-get private-address\n\n*relation-joined hook does the actual installation and configuration of the client\n\n\n[1] or the install hook can do the installation up to the point that the ip is needed, and then stop\n", "Q: Gimp Plugin Mixing Images Hi. I have a qustion about a gimp plugin and where, if, I can find it.\nAs you can see, in the image bellow there is a printed image. On one side the printed image is normal, on the other it it's mixed. Can I find a plugin that can mix a image like that? \nThank you!\n\nA: Try looking into the PythonFu Slice filter. It will take an image and then divide it into however many pieces you want in as a even a way as possible, then you can manually re-join them in whatever way you want.\nThere's also the Guillotine plug-in that divides up the image based on any guides on the image. Again, this would require you to manually composite the images back together.\nAnd, finally, there's this Split and join images filter I found on the GIMP Registry. I haven't got it to work, but perhaps you can. It also seems to be partially in another language.\nThese aren't exactly what you want, as it's not automatic - but perhaps you can take these and create your own PythonFu script or GIMP extension!\n", "Q: How to open shared SMB resources in the form \"\\\\host\"?

To do this click the 'connect to server' button in the left sidebar and enter in the information. \nYou might need to know what type of server it is (chances are it is a normal windows sharesamba), so you could try typing in \"smb://10.1.2.3\".\nUsing the Unity Dash\nAnother way which I cannot guarantee will work, but you might want to try, is to press ALT+F2. This is the pretty much the equivalent of the Windows \"Run...\" prompt.

I started making an application with some text and buttons and I would like to assign a button to open gnome-control-center. How can I make a button in Glade open it?\n\nA: I figured out how to do it! After some research, I figured out the following would work:\n1. Import system processes\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\nimport subprocess\n\nthis need to be added at the top of AppNameWindow.py.\n2. Connect a button to an application\ndef on_button1_clicked(self, widget, data=None):\n       p = Process(target=self.launch_gcc)\n       p.start()\n\ndef launch_gcc(self):\n       subprocess.call([\"gnome-control-center\"])'\n\nWith this code you tell button1 to open GNOME Control Center when clicked. \"gcc\" in this example is a variable you can change yourself when adding another button.\nAdding URL to button\nYou can also add an URL to a button with the following code:\n1. Import webbrowser\nimport webbrowser\n\nthis need to be added at the top of AppNameWindow.py.\n2. Connect a button to an URL\ndef on_button3_clicked(self, widget, data=None):\nreturn webbrowser.open ('http://example.com')\n\nWith this code you tell button3 to open the webbrowser with \"example.com\" when clicked.\n", "Q: Is there a file manager that opens readme files? I'm looking for a file manager that shows the content of a readme file when I open a folder, like on github.\nIs that possible to do? \nEdit: I know that they are just text files that I can open like any text file. But I want it to open in for example a box at the bottom of nautilus for easy viewing when I navigat to a folder.\n\nA: I don't think there is a file manager that would do what you want if you don't count apps like Midnight Commander which can be configured to show contents of any file in a side panel. From what you describe, you want the readme file in current directory shown no matter which file in that directory is currently active. Additionally, if you are talking GitHub, you probably also mean Markdown files. However, existing Ubuntu, Kubuntu file managers can be extended with plugins. For instance for Nautilus check out https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NautilusPython \nYou could write a python plugin that would do what you want. You could imagine using one of existing markdown parsers in the process as well.\n\nA: This requirement is too specific. You will not find this option in a normal file manager.\nAs workaround, you could start your filemanager with a script like this, but that has nothing to do with comfort:\nnano /usr/local/bin/openloc\n\nAdd the following lines\n#!/bin/bash\nsearchpath=\"$1\"\nsearchpath=\"${searchpath//~/$HOME}\"\n\nopenwith=\"gedit\"\n\n\"$openwith\" \"$searchpath/README\" &\n\nxdg-open \"$searchpath\"\n\n» I use gedit, because README is normally not associated with a standard program.\nMake the script executable:\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/openloc\n\nAnd start with:\nopenloc \"$HOME/src/myproject\"\n\nYou can create desktop files for different directories.\n\nA: ReadMe files are just plain text files and can be opened in gedit or similar text editors. You can also try sushi which is a previewer for nautilus. \nIn addition, you can even view the contents of readme files in the terminal by:\ncat path/to/your/readme/file\n\nA: I agree that this is a useful feature.\n\n\n*\n\n*Nextcloud seems to have added this feature recently. When browsing files stored in a Nextcloud instance, if you navigate to a folder with a README in it, it will be previewed. screenshot: Nextcloud showing README\n\n*Dired is a file manager in Emacs. It does not have this feature natively, but because I'm most familiar with Emacs, I have implemented an Emacs package to make Dired show the README of a directory. screenshot: Dired showing README of my dotfiles with dired-show-readme\n", "Q: Xsetwacom -list devices having issues Ok Hi first of all, \nI am a new born linux user thanks to my uncle.

One of the actual topics was the malware \"mumblehard\". This malware makes your server to a part of a botnet and sends spam via email. The malware is locate in the /tmp or /var/tmp folder. So I looked up to this folder and I saw a few folders. One of them was an owncloud folder, which named \"owncloud-occ23cq12x22...\". The moderator of the webinar said, that a folder with chars like in this example above is the malware folder. I restarted my server, because the tmp folder will be cleared. Now ist is nothing in this folder (mc folder for midnight-commander only).\nIs it possible, that this was the malware or is it normal, that owncloud create this tmp folder?\nI have installed owncloud on my webserver.\nThanks \n\nA: It is perfectly normal for software to create files and their own directory in /tmp/ to store temporary files (most likely these are session related files). That is what /tmp/ is for. \nIn general these files contain the name of the software (like your example with owncloud* and a \"random\" set of characters behind it). If you never installed owncloud and you have these files I'd expect something to be wrong. If you did install (as you did) it I would assume all is fine.\nIn  my own /tmp/ I have a sni-qt_synergy. Synergy is software to connect 2 systems to 1 mouse and keyboard. You will also see this behaviour when using encryption (though this probably will be outside of /tmp/).\nAt the moment and with the information you provided I would say: perfectly normal.\n\nRelated to the malware: it is installed from WordPress and Joomla exploits and a cracked DirectMailer (if you do not have these you are safe(r)) and detection is very simple since it creates its own cron job.  A crontab -l used with root and a more /etc/crontab will always reveal if this malware is present on your system\nRemove that cron job, clean /tmp (or /var/tmp) and delete the cracked DirectMailer.\n", "Q: Black borders Ubuntu 14.04 After installing wine, I see the black borders everywhere and can't see my terminal:\n\nI've reinstalled the wine, nvidia drivers and Bumblebee, but the problem still exist.

Also, what you show is not an array in bash, it's a string1. Arrays are separated by spaces, not commas.\nThat said, here's a bash way, assuming true arrays:\na=(1 2 3 4 5)\nb=(2 4)\nc=( $(printf \"%s\\n\" \"${a[@]}\" \"${b[@]}\" | sort | uniq -u) )\n\nIf you actually have comma-separated strings and not arrays, use this instead:\na=(1,2,3,4,5)\nb=(2,4)\nc=( $(sed 's/,/\\n/g' <(printf \"%s\\n\" \"${a[@]}\" \"${b[@]}\") | sort | uniq -u) )\n\nAlternatively, you could use perl instead:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nmy @A=(1,2,3,4,5);\nmy @B=(2,4);\nmy %k;\nmap{$k{$_}++} (@A,@B);\nmy @C=grep($k{$_}==1,keys(%k));\nprint \"@C\\n\";\n\n\n1Strictly speaking, it's an array with one element but that is essentially the same as a string as far as bash is concerned. \n\nA: The perl way. This script displays all elements in array a, which are also contained in array b.\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nmy @a = (1,2,3,4,5);\nmy @b = (2,4,7,8,9,10);\n\n# Create a hashmap with the entries in b as keys,\n# but without values for the keys for a better lookup\n# (exists ($hash{$element}))\nmy %hash;\n@hash{@b}=();\n\nforeach my $element (@a) {print \"$element \" unless exists($hash{$element})}\nprint \"\\n\";\n\nOutput:\n1 3 5\n\n\nA: The complexity the task (O(N^2)) cannot be reduced; assuming only what has been explicitly given (i.e. no hypothesis for the values of both array a and b) the code below will just check if each value present in a is also present in b, and if the value is present, it will break the inner for loop (the only optimization possible with the given hypothesis) and add the value to c; with more clues about the contents of the arrays a and b (i.e. if the values in each array might be repeated and if the arrays are sorted), there might be some more room for improvement: \n#!/bin/bash\n\na=(1 2 3 4 5)\nb=(2 4)\nfor i in ${a[@]}\ndo\nmatch=0\n    for j in ${b[@]}\n    do\n        if [ \"${i}\" == \"${j}\" ]\n        then\n            match=1\n            break\n        fi\n    done\nif [ \"${match}\" == 0 ]\nthen\n    c+=($i)\nfi\ndone\necho ${c[@]}\n\n\nA: In python, entries like:\na=(1,2,3,4,5)\nb=(2,4)\n\nare iterables and known as tuples.\nYour task can be easily done in python:\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\na = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nb = (2, 4)\nc = tuple(i for i in a if i not in b)\nprint c\n\nOutput :\n(1, 3, 5)\n\nHere we have found the values of the tuple a, that do not exist in tuple b and put them in another tuple c. Also note that this operation will be fast and memory efficient for larger data sets as we have used python generator expression. \n\nA: @terdon's accepted answer doesn't actually remove items from a that are also in b, but rather concatenates both lists and removes non-unique values. This is a huge difference when b includes items that are not in a: c will contain values that are in b, but not in a.\nHere's a pure Bash solution for actually removing items from a that are also in b (note the additional 6 in b):\na=(1 2 3 4 5)\nb=(2 4 6)\nc=( $(printf \"%s\\n\" \"${a[@]}\" \"${b[@]}\" \"${b[@]}\" | sort | uniq -u) )\n\nc will consist of 1 3 5 and exclude the unexpected 6.\nPlease note: This assumes that all values in a are unique. Otherwise they won't show up in c. If a contains duplicate values, you must remove the duplicates first (note the duplicate 1 in a):\na=(1 1 2 3 4 5)\nb=(2 4 6)\nc=( $({ printf \"%s\\n\" \"${a[@]}\" | sort -u; printf \"%s\\n\" \"${b[@]}\" \"${b[@]}\"; } | sort | uniq -u) )\n\nIf you want to replicate the duplicates in a to c, go with @kos' answer. The same is true if a and b are huge: this is a very inefficient solution for a lot of items, even though it's negligible for a few items (<100). If you need to process huge arrays don't use Bash.\n", "Q: How to delete a partition that is locked I wish to delete a partition of Linux Mint. I am familiar with Gparted and using a live cd, but it is locked. It says extended /dev/sda2. Here is a screenshot of my partitions:\n  Thank you all for your help in advance. \n\nA: If it's THE extended partition, you can't delete it without removing all the logical partitions in it.\nYou need to unmount all partitions in the extended partition that may be mounted.\nIn your case, you need to unmount swap partition. Right-click on it and choose unmount. Then proceed.\n\nA: You can't delete or move partitions that are mounted. If you don't want to delete a system partition, where your working system is installed, then right-click it and choose \"unmount\". If you want to delete a system partition, then you will have to boot from some other drive, like LiveCD.\nIf your linux Mint is on sda6 prtition, then just delete it.\n", "Q: How to get gnome session idle time?

But when using the same command in the reverse tick utility, the perl script throws a lot of errors. \n$thirdlast=`df -H | awk '{print $(NF-3)}'`;\nprint $thirdlast;\n\nWhy does the same command not run in the script? Is there any other way to return the required results?\n\nA: The main problem is that the $ is important to perl. When you use it in a system command, you need to escape it:\n$thirdlast=`df -H | awk '{print \\$(NF-3)}'`;\nprint $thirdlast;\n\nOtherwise, perl will try to expand $(NF-3) as a perl variable. The variable $( is the perl process's real GID:\n\n$(\nThe real gid of this process. If you are on a machine that supports membership in multiple groups simultaneously, gives a space separated list of groups you are in.\n\nThe variable $) is the process's effective GID:\nSo, $(NF-3) evaluates to list of groups you are a member of NF-3). For example, on my system, that is:\n$ perl -le 'print \"$(NF-3)\"'\n1001 27 29 111 112 1001NF-3)\n\nThe next problem is that your awk call is wrong. The % use is $(NF-1), not $(NF-3). So, what you wanted is:\n$thirdlast=`df -H | awk '{print \\$(NF-1)}'`;\n\nOr, to only print percentages above a certain threshold, for example 90:\n$thirdlast=`df -H | awk '(\\$(NF-1)>90){print \\$(NF-1)}'`;\n\nIn any case, you could just process the output of df in Perl itself:\n$thirdlast=`df -H`;\n@matches=($thirdlast=~/(\\S+%)/g);\nprint \"@matches\\n\";\n\nOr\n@matches=(`df -H`=~/(\\S+%)/g);\nprint \"@matches\\n\";\n\nAnd to set a threshold:\n@matches=(`df -H`=~/(\\S+%)/g);\n@above90=grep {$_>90} @matches;\nprint \"@above90\\n\";\n\nOr, more directly:\n@matches=grep {$_ >90} (`df -H`=~/(\\S+%)/g);\nprint \"@matches\\n\";\n\nThe @array=($variable=~/foo/g) will save all matches of the regular expression foo in the variable $variable into the array @matches. That will have the same result as parsing the df with awk.\n", "Q: NIS translation files I've found a problem in NIS translation to Portuguese (pt-pt).

Is there a practical difference between using Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server? \nI am making a VM of Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS with LXDE desktop, and it's very fast with small size on disk, even after full upgrade. It is a great learning tool, as I am building it from the ground up.\nThank you.\n\nA: Well... generally speaking, the two distributions differ in that one has a graphical environment, and the other has not.\nAlso I guess, the kernel is compiled with less modules and optimized for other work.

I tried to begin the installation in the UEFI-mode, but it doesn't recognize the USB, even when I defined the USB as the loading source.\nOnly after I defined in Dell Vostro 3460 the boot legacy support and disabled the Secure Boot the installation process has begun.\nDuring the installation, I defined the following partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*/efi, (300 MB);\n\n*/boot, (200 MB);\n\n*/swap, (8.5 GB);\n\n*/, (15 GB);\n\n*/home, (the rest of the space).\n\n\nThe process has finished successfully. But when I tried to switch from the legacy mode to UEFI, I faced with the problem when the laptop doesn't load and suggests to check the loading settings in BIOS.\nMy question is how to install Ubuntu in UEFI/GPT mode on my laptop? Why the created installation USB-drive doesn't work. It's important to note, there is no such issue with the Fedora and Windows installations, both of them succeed to accomplish the installation in UEFI/GPT mode, the installation drive has been created by Rufus too.\nThanks.\n\nA: I can't speak to Rufus. My personal preference is to use dd to copy an image to a USB flash drive, since this results in a medium that usually boots fine in both BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and in EFI/UEFI mode. That said, some computers choke on such media, which employ something of a Frankenstein's Monster approach to their layout. In other words, there's no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach.\nIf the system is installed but unbootable, you might try a USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. If you can boot it, rEFInd should detect your kernel and enable you to boot Ubuntu, with one caveat: Because you used a separate /boot partition, you'll need to highlight your kernel in rEFInd, hit F2 or Insert twice, and add ro root={whatever} to your kernel options, where {whatever} is your root (/) filesystem's device identifier. For instance, it might be ro root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu-root or ro root=/dev/sda4.\nIf you can boot to Ubuntu in this way, you should be able to re-install GRUB or install rEFInd to get your system booting normally. Read up on efibootmgr and EFI boot loaders for Linux to learn more.\nThere are a number of issues that can cause the type of problem you're having. Often it boils down to buggy firmware. There are workarounds for such problems, but if you've got a buggy firmware, it's better to return the defective computer and tell the manufacturer why you did so; anything less is an invitation to the manufacturer to keep shoveling junk down your throat.\nOne final point: If you can boot more easily in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode than in EFI/UEFI mode, by all means use the former. There are advantages to EFI/UEFI-mode booting, but they're fairly modest, so you shouldn't feel compelled to use that boot mode if BIOS/CSM/legacy is easier for you.\n\nA: Ubuntu's live media will boot both in legacy and UEFI mode, and the install is done in whichever mode is booted.  Some machines will not boot USB unless secure boot is disabled, but that does not mean you have to go to legacy mode.  Try that.  Also read:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\nhttp://askubuntu.com/questions/221835/installing-ubuntu-on-a-pre-installed-windows-8-64-bit-system-uefi-supported\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS without the software, just command line? Is there a way to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS without the software, just command line? (desktop version, not server)\nThank you.\n\nA: The server version is what you want. It only differs from the desktop version in that it does not install any package related to desktop. Other than that, it is the same, apart from the kernel, which is tailored to server duties. From that point, you can add whatever package you need, so you can build your own system.\n", "Q: FireFox Bookmark Deletion Problem In windows I can easily delete a FF bookmark. To do so I just click on Bookmarks button. Then a list of bookmarks appears and I just right click on the bookmark which I want to delete and once a menu come with delete option I just click on this.

There might be a bug which is occurring your problem. nVidia 319 doesn't support GTX 760, the support for Linux came from nvidia-337. I'd recommend you to install it from Ubuntu's additional drivers.

There seems to be an issue with the compatibility of the NVIDIA drivers and Ubuntu.\n(After weeks of struggling with various black/purple screens, toggling nomodeset, blacklisting nouveau, and restarting lightdm/trying gdm, returning my GTX960 for a GTX750TI, installing Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10, login loops, and a few other things I'm sure I forgot, I have the following minimal example.)\n\n\n*\n\n*I create a boot USB with Ubuntu 15.04.\n\n*I select \"Install Ubuntu\" (note that I must edit the options for this, changing \"quiet splash\" to \"quiet splash nomodeset\" or else it doesn't work).\n\n*After installing Ubuntu, I am asked to restart. I can boot in recovery mode (although the resolution is strange), but not normally.\n\n*At this point, I have tried various things (reinstall nvidia drivers, permanently add nomodeset to boot options, etc.), most of which end up leading to the need to reinstall Ubuntu from scratch due to inability to see anything without removing the graphics card and plugging the monitor into the motherboard. \n\n\nI have just completed the first 3 steps, which are by now muscle memory, and am begging for suggestions on a new step 4.\nEDIT: I have tried the steps here (which led me to the nomodeset option that allows me to see the screen while I install Ubuntu) but when I update the NVIDIA drivers (I have tried both the proprietary and non-proprietary versions, many different version numbers), this leads me to other problems. Most often, it is a login loop, but occasionally it is a black/purple screen. When I follow the suggested to address the login loop, this invariably leads me back to a blank screen and I then reinstall Ubuntu. \n$ sudo lshw -C video\n  *-display UNCLAIMED     \n       description: VGA compatible controller\n       product: GM107 [GeForce GTX 750 Ti]\n       vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0\n       version: a2\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress vga_controller bus_master cap_list\n       configuration: latency=0\n       resources: memory:f6000000-f6ffffff memory:e0000000-efffffff memory:f0000000-f1ffffff ioport:e000(size=128) memory:f7000000-f707ffff\n\nUpdate: installing bumblebee allows me to escape the login loop. The resolution of my monitor still doesn't look right, and I have to click out of about a dozen \"Report system problem\" boxes.\nEdit: My xorg.log is here.\n\nA: I too built a desktop, and used the 750Ti. I had the exact problem that the OP has, and I can personally testify that the below worked for me.\nI don't have a ton of time, so I'll have to summarize. When in doubt, Google is your friend.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to NVIDIA's website from another PC and download the appropriate driver to a USB drive.\n\n*Plug this USB drive into your desktop and boot. At the login screen, enter runlevel 2 by pressing CTRL+ALT+2\n\n*Now you will be in a terminal (fun times!). Login using your account.\n\n*Kill lightdm.\n\n*Mount your USB drive and un-tar the driver. \n\n*Run the driver installer. If there are no errors during installation, then reboot. The login loop should now be gone.\nThis makes it sound simple, but unfortunately, it is actually pretty difficult. It took me four tries to get it right. \nLet me know how this works for you!\n\nA: OK,Lets understand the point number 2 you mentioned, You said that you had to pass nomodeset kernel parameter while Booting off of the USB. \nThis would Indicate that the Graphics Card you have GTX750TI, Does not want to work well with the Open Source Nouveau Driver. So that is your First Problem. I would not Proceed with the Install if I had to use nomodeset just to boot into the Installer.\nI don't have experience with this card but the Maxwell Architecture which it is based on has a lot of issues with Nouveau Driver which is Open Source.\nUbuntu By default ships with Open Source Drivers and if your Card has issues working with it you will see black screens etc..\nWhat is the best way to confirm this?\nPlease download Manajaro Linux and while booting select non free drivers you will get a confirmation. You could also try Archlinux which has the 4.0 Kernel and many Graphics related issues are fixed in that release.\nI AM  NOT ENCOURAGING USE OF MANJARO OR ARCH. I AM SUGGESTING TO TRY THEM ONCE AS A TEST TO CONFIRM WHAT I SAD ABOVE .\nYOU WILL CONTINUE SEEING BLACK SCREEN UNTIL YOU INSTALL THE PROPRIETARY  NVIDIA DRIVER. YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE CORRECT PROPRIETARY DRIVER VERSION COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR CARD!!\n\nA: I think it's because of kernel version. As you know the kernel version of Ubuntu 15.04 is 3.16.

It turned out that the problem was the NVIDIA card was overheating to about 30% more than suggested temp.  Get a live disk install, and install psensor to check temperatures of the video card.\n\nA: I had a similar problem after installing an nvidia card in an existing 15.04 machine. After struggling for some time, looking for answers here and finding nothing that really helped, I gave up and installed 14.04 (LTS). The nvidia drivers were installed automatically and everything works like magic. (See Problems installing Nvidia drivers, Ubuntu 15.04)\nFrom your question it seems that you did exactly what eventually solved my problem, except that you installed a fresh 15.04 while I installed a fresh 14.04. I suspect that 15.04 has a specific problem. So installing 14.04 could be a solution for you.\n\nA: I have had the same problem, and you need a fresh installation, and first enter the bios and set the boot from uefi to legacy, and not a secure boot, and then install Ubuntu again.\n", "Q: Pycharm broke pip Situation:\nWhilst using Pycharm on a python3 project, I came across the option under the \"Project Interpreter\" settings to install a package manager. I clicked it absentmindedly and immediately realized that I had wrought a horror upon myself.\nI'm assuming that the option I clicked was to install PIP for python3, because from my terminal I was unable to use PIP correctly. Doing anything with the pip command results with this output:\n$ pip install lxml\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/pip\", line 9, in <module>\n    load_entry_point('pip==1.5.6', 'console_scripts', 'pip')()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/setuptools-5.7-py3.4.egg/pkg_resources.py\", line 356, in load_entry_point\n\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/setuptools-5.7-py3.4.egg/pkg_resources.py\", line 2472, in load_entry_point\n    try:\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/setuptools-5.7-py3.4.egg/pkg_resources.py\", line 2186, in load\n    self.py_version = py_version\nImportError: No module named 'pip'\n\nI thought PIP was missing, so I tried to remove and re-add the ubuntu package python-pip, I attempted to run python get-pip.py but that reported that PIP was already installed.\nAfter a while, I found that PIP was still installed for python27, but not for python34. (From my understanding) This is what /should/ be expected to prevent the exact issues I'm having now, however, whatever Pycharm did seems to have changed the default behavior in my terminal to look for PIP in python34, despite the fact that my default python is still python27 (verified by running python --version).\nI reinstalled PIP for python34 which has given me the ability to install packages again, but I do not want this behavior.\nQuestion:\nHow do I reset everything so I can safely uninstall PIP for python34 and revert the default PIP to be the python27 version?\n(After I've cleaned everything up, I'll start working with virtualenv. I was only made of its existence today while attempting to troubleshoot this issue.)\n\nA: When switching python interpreter from 2.7 to 3.4 on pycharm it installed setuptools-5.7 which probably broke my pip. I fixed this by renaming the setuptools files and installing python3 pip. My pip now works again.\n\ncd /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages\nsudo mv setuptools-5.7-py3.4.egg setuptools-5.7-py3.4.egg.moved\nsudo mv setuptools-5.7-py3.4.egg setuptools-5.7-py3.4.egg.moved\nsudo apt-get install python3-pip\n\n\nA: Solution\nAfter googling for answers since yesterday, I came across no way to set the default pip. I decided to go through and remove every instance of pip I could discover.\nsudo -H pip3 uninstall pip\nsudo -H pip2 uninstall pip\nsudo apt-get purge -y python-pip\n# It should be noted, 'python-pip' is the ubuntu package for pip2, but\n# there is also another ubuntu package for pip3. I didn't have it, but you may.\n\nAfter this I reinstalled pip via sudo -H python get-pip.py, and all seems to be right again. pip3 fails because it is not installed, pip2 confirms the correct pip was installed, and (best of all) just running pip works just like it should.\nLearn from me.

Upon logging onto Ubuntu, however, I notice that there exists the Elementary theme and a few other things so it's not like nothing was installed... But still I cannot access it. \nI then followed the instructions on the second answer, but once again it was to no avail. No way to choose another session. \nWhat can I do?\n\nA: \nWell, long story short answer: There is currently no way to install or run Pantheon on Ubuntu (or any other distro, for that matter) in a stable and sane way.\nLet's talk about why: Although elementary OS (Freya) is based on Ubuntu (14.04), some core packages are patched or backported (= we imported a newer version of the package). You experienced this problem with the GTK+ library (a very popular toolkit for writing GUI applications).\nWe do not maintain versions of Pantheon for other distros than elementary OS, because there are simply no ressources (in terms of developers) left to do so. It's a very complicated thing to write applications for different distros (because of the different versions of libraries) - and let's not talk about a whole desktop environment depending on GNOME tools and libs.\nOh and you shouldn't add elementary PPAs (which are our repos currently) because this may/will overwrite libs and stuff. I fear you will only bork your system with doing so!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/elementaryos/comments/2y60m5/new_issues_with_elementary_desktop_on_ubuntu1404/\n", "Q: How to prevent the deployment process from accessing DNS server? I noticed that when deploying a virtual machine while using a preseed, the host name specified in the preseed is ignored and the one from DNS server is used instead.\nDetailed description\nThe Ubuntu Server machine is deployed using:\nvirt-install \\\n    --name custom-name \\\n    --initrd-inject /some-path/preseed.cfg \\\n    --extra-args \"preseed/file=preseed.cfg\" \\\n    ...\n\nThe preseed file contains, among others, the following lines (notice the custom-name value in the second line):\n...\nd-i netcfg/disable_dhcp boolean true\n...\nd-i netcfg/get_hostname string custom-name\nd-i netcfg/get_domain string pelicandd.com\nd-i netcfg/get_ipaddress string 192.168.1.35\n...\n\nOn the other hand, DNS server contains both the A record:\ndemo    IN A       192.168.1.35\n\nas well as the PTR record:\n35      IN  PTR     demo.example.com.\n\nOnce the machine is created, it appears that /etc/hostname contains:\ndemo\n\nand that /etc/hosts contains:\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n192.168.1.35    demo.example.com     demo\n\nQuestion\nI'm not particularly happy with the fact that the deployment process accesses the DNS server to get the information. Not only does it take time, but in some circumstances, the DNS server can be down (such as the case where it's the DNS server itself which is being deployed).\nWhat should I specify in the preseed to prevent the installer from accessing DNS to retrieve information which is already available in the preseed?\n\nA: RTFM helped. From Debian's preseed example:\n# Any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take precedence over\n# values set here. However, setting the values still prevents the questions\n# from being shown, even if values come from dhcp.\nd-i netcfg/get_hostname string unassigned-hostname\nd-i netcfg/get_domain string unassigned-domain\n\n# If you want to force a hostname, regardless of what either the DHCP\n# server returns or what the reverse DNS entry for the IP is, uncomment\n# and adjust the following line.\n#d-i netcfg/hostname string somehost\n\nWhich means that netcfg/get_hostname is irrelevant: its only purpose is to prevent the installer from asking the question in the first place.\nIndeed, when I set the value of netcfg/hostname, both /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts contain the values specified in the preseed, ignoring the DNS PTR record.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Dual boot problem with windows 7 I have a problem switching back to my windows 7.

If after running updates you can no longer see your other operating systems try the following:\nYou will want to run the following command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis command will basically update the grub configuration, and since Ubuntu installs OS-prober with Grub it will search automatically for any other OS's installed on the hard disk while updating.\nOnce you run this command, reboot and you should see the additional OS in the list of boot options. This method would work with Windows either being installed as primary or as a secondary OS.\n", "Q: XPS-L421X - Drivers anyone know how to install the notebook drivers DELL XPS 14 and your video card NVIDIA Geforce 630 ?

I just dual installed Ubuntu 14.04 with Windows 7, using Wubi. It went pretty smoothly, but when my Ubuntu home screen came up and I opened the \"Install Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\" icon, this screen came up:\n\nI have no idea what anything on this screen is for.

When I click \"Install now\", I get an error saying, \"No root file system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu.\"\nHas anyone dealt with this screen before, who knows how to use it? Any insight would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: /dev/sda is the first harddrive that ubuntu sees. ubundu, and by extension linux, sees hardisks as devices and name them sda, sdb and so on. sda1, sda2 are partitions within sda. sort of like now you can partition a hard disk into multiple disks in windows. (a 500GB disk into a C drive and D drive, for example.)\nWhat this screen shows is that you have a 500GB harddisk, and it seems to be entire taken up by windows. also that you have a smaller 8GB disk that is named /dev/sdb. I am not sure what that is being used for. \nI would recommend not touching /dev/sda at all. this is your windows stuff and whatever changes you make here will probably break windows. \nYou should google how to setup a dual boot windows ubuntu machine.

After the cache has been flushed to the drive it should be safe to pull the drive after that.\nYou could try syncing the drive before unmounting so the drive cache is flushed before you unplug it, as that should give you the same effect.

Most of the time I update software on Ubuntu. The software consumes a lot of space on my storage device.

Unless the software packages are using a lot of memory, or your hard drive isalmost completely full, updating software packages shouldn't slow your computer down.\n\nA: It may or may not. Updates oftentimes introduce greater functionality to the older version of the program, thus causing the program to consume greater memory and/or cpu. Other times, updates may fix bugs that would otherwise uselessly consume memory and/or cpu. On the other hand, updates may also introduce new bugs that also uselessly consume cpu and memory.

When I install Ubuntu, the swap area for the already-installed Red Hat was identified by the Ubuntu installer, and the default option is to \"Use as: swap area\". \nThe issue I have is that when I click \"Install Now\", the installer asks me to confirm that I'm formatting the Red Hat swap area as \"swap\". \nQuestions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Does this mean somehow the Red Hat swap and Ubuntu swap uses different file systems or formats?\n\n*What filesystem is swap anyways?\n\n*If I use the default option, \"Use as: swap area\" for the swap already configured for Red Hat, and Ubuntu proceeds with the format, will Red Hat still be able to that area as swap when in the future (when I boot into it in the future)?\n\n\nA: You can share the swap partition among multiple linux (and even windows) operating systems. Swap partition is a space used by the OS to move idle/unused pages from the RAM when the RAM is full. When you install Ubuntu, you can choose \"Use as: swap area\" to tell ubuntu to use that partition at its swap. Also it is better to make sure that Redhat is not hibernated as Ubuntu will need to format the swap partition.\nYou might have some disadvantages. One being the inability to hibernate one OS while booting other.\n\nA: *\n\n*No.\n\n*Swap is no actual file system. It is just a reserved part of the disk that is raw addressable memory with no special structure. Quoted from here.\n\n*Yes, however you have to be careful with hibernate and/or suspend. In this case the OS stores RAM contents in the swap area. If another OS then uses that space itself, that stored state will be lost and it will become impossible to restart the suspended OS into its saved state. When you boot that OS, it will be as if the system crashed -- open files may be damaged, file systems may need repair, etc. If you want to hibernate/suspend, do not share swap partitions (or file systems)\n\n\nA: Yes they can share swap. In fact, every Linux OS can.\nBy default they do not share swap. You have to choose that manually from the advanced install options (chose \"Something else...\" when you have to decide how/where you want to install Ubuntu). And swap is not that important if you don't use the hibernation or suspend functionality. When you hibernate, data from RAM is stored in swap.\n", "Q: Distribution not supported error when trying to install Intel Graphics Installer on Ubuntu 15.04 How do I install the Intel Graphics Installer 1.08 32-bit on Ubuntu 15.04? I'm getting \"Distribution not supported error\".\n\nA: First of all I do not recommend to install this package, if you do not have a serious reason for that. Intel drivers that are already installed in Ubuntu are good. It will be hard to remove that package and it may conflict with future updates.\nThis package is not intended for Ubuntu 15.04. Future release may support it, but as I wrote earlier it is not too good to install it.\n\nA: According to 01.org, the next release of the Intel Graphics installer q2-2015 is supposed to be made available for 15.04.

When I run gksudo android I receive a password prompt but after entering the password nothing opens. I have then tried running terminal as root then running android command but then the command is not recognized. I have tried looking for other shortcuts but I cannot think of any now. The reason I need to run as root is because my android sdk is locate in usr/local folder. Thanks in advance for your assistance.\n\nA: This is because the directory /usr/local/android-sdk/tools (I assume this is where you installed the SDK) is not in the PATH variable of root. So your system has no idea where the SDK manager is located.\nTo change this permanently and most easily, open  /etc/bash.bashrc in an edior with elevated privileges and add the following line:\nPATH=$PATH:/usr/local/android-sdk/tools:/usr/local/android-sdk/platform-tools\n\nThis will add the Android SDK path to all users, not just root. If you only want to set it for root, edit /root/.bashrc.\nAdditionally, this command adds the platform-tools directory, where tools like ADB and fastboot reside.\n", "Q: Nvidia Corporation: G96 [GeForce 9500 GT] After I recently updated my computer software \"Ubuntu\" I went to my \"System Settings\" And click on \"Software And Updates\" There was something new I have never seen before.\nNvidia Corporation: G96 [GeForce 9500 GT]\nBelow There are 5 Options.\n1. \"Using NVIDIA binary driver - version 340.76 from nvidia-340 (proprietary, tested)\"\n2. \"Using NVIDIA legacy binary driver - version 304.125 from nvidia-304-updates (proprietary)\" \n3. \"Using NVIDIA legacy binary driver - version 304.125 from nvidia-304 (proprietary)\"\n4. \"Using X.Org X server - Nouveau disaplay driver from xsever-xorg-video-nouveau (open source)\"\n5. \"Using NVIDIA binary driver - version 340.76\n from nvidia-340-updates (proprietary) \nI really don't know what these mean so if you do please tell me withc one to choose. \nTheres one more also, below the options, \nUnknown: Unknown This device is not working.\n1. \"Using Processor microcode firmware for AMD CPU's from amd64-microcode (proprietary) \n2.

And if everything works OK, then it makes no much sense to change anything.\nBut if you choose to test if proprietary drivers work better, or work at all with this card, then you need to know how to revert system back. It can be done using system console with a command\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nBut for a new user it is not always easy to reach the console.\nThe AMD microcode updater is a driver, which loads microcode to your CPU.

I have written a C program containing code allocating memory using the malloc() function. If I don't free up the memory using the free() function, will Ubuntu release it automatically?\n\nA: Yes.\nThe kernel will release all the resources allocated by a program upon the program's termination.\nThis is done after the do_exit() function defined in kernel/exit.c has terminated its execution; the do_exit() function execution itself might be triggered by a number of events, most commonly by an explicit exit() syscall called by the program during its regular computation or by an implicit exit() syscall called by the program upon its termination (as the C compiler places an exit() syscall after main()'s return). Other reasons include the reception of an unhandable / not ignorable signal or exception.\nThe do_exit() function itself performs a number of tasks. After it has terminated its execution, the program's allocated resources are released by the kernel and returned to the system for further uses.\nSource\n", "Q: MFC-L2700DW installation I recently tried to install a customer's Brother MFC-L2700DW without success.

Both lists are then combined into a list of coordinates, in which the windows will be rearranged.\nThis is done in line 26-28 of the script:\nx_coords = [int(left_margin+area_h/cols*n) for n in range(cols)]\ny_coords = [int(top_margin+area_v/rows*n) for n in range(rows)]\ncoords = sum([[(cx, cy) for cx in x_coords] for cy in y_coords], [])\n\n\n*The actual rearranging finally (after unmaximizing possibly maximized windows) is done from line 33 and further.\n", "Q: How to create a perl script which checks the system stats(CPU,RAM,HDD) and sends an alert mail?

The --escape option to ls is your friend in such instances, as are tools such as cat -v.\nSo, too, is rm -i -- *\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2182/\n\n*http://opensourceforu.com/2010/12/secure-upload-methods-in-php/\n\nA: Reposting in detail, expanded from my comment on Eliah's answer\nThe problem is invisible, but can be seen if you know what to look for:  The file name includes a space at the end.  Because you copy/pasted the entire ls output, it can be seen in the question if you highlight the output, or edit the post and move the cursor to the end, or (as Eliah pointed out) look at the diff in the edit history.  I highlighted the ls output in the post in this screenshot:\n\nA quick little terminal session to duplicate the problem, with comments:\n$ touch 'foo '        # Create file with a space at the end\n$ ls -l               # Space is not visible in ls output\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 izkata izkata 0 May 14 21:59 foo \n\n$ rm foo              # Cannot remove it when not specifying the space\nrm: cannot remove ‘foo’: No such file or directory\n\n$ rm 'foo '           # Can remove it if we quote the file name and include the space\n$ rm foo\\             # Or can escape the space to tell bash to include it as part of the filename\n\nUsing tab completion would have also completely sidestepped the problem here, as bash is smart enough to escape spaces correctly (It's also a good habit in general, speeds up typing paths so much).\nFor example, had I typed rm f<tab>, it would have auto-completed to rm foo\\<space><space>, as in the last example in the code block above.\n\nA: TL;DR: Run ls -1b, find the filename, copy the line on which it appears, and give that to rm.\nAs others have suggested, most likely this is due to limitations in the way ls--and some other programs, including client and server software--handle weird filenames, such as those containing control characters, by default. Your success with JdeBP's answer strongly suggests this was the case, though it would've been a good bet even before that. \n\n\n*\n\n*For ls, when standard output is a terminal, ? characters are printed in their place. So if you're not piping ls's output to any other command (or redirecting it to a log for viewing), probably your filename doesn't contain control characters. But there are other problematic characters--perhaps the filename contains trailing whitespace, for example.\nThis behavior of ls can be confusing but is not a bug, can can be overridden explicitly by the user (see below).\n\n*When attempting to access or remove a file remotely, bugs in client or server software can produce such problems.\nI've experienced this sort of thing via ftp myself several times, including for files whose names contain trailing spaces. (That it didn't work was due to a bug in my ftp client.) Even when you manually create a file yourself, depending on how you are creating it, it's sometimes quite easy to inadvertently insert a trailing space, or other whitespace that may look like spaces even though it isn't.\nThis is a situation where ls -1b (or dir -1) comes in handy:\n\n\n*\n\n*-1 tells ls to show one entry per line. That way there is no confusion about where one filename ends and another begins. This is handy for weirdly named files.\n\n*-b tells ls to print escape sequences for any special characters. The output of ls -b can be copied and pasted literally into a command, with no added quoting: all problematic characters are already quoted in a way that causes the shell to recognize them as what they are.\n\n\nThere is only one caveat: if the last character on a line appears to be \\, copy one character after that, since this means \\ is quoting a space.\nYou can run ls -1b just like that, or you can pass a shell glob pattern to it (e.g., ls -1b qyx*). Globbing may or may not find the file, depending on whether or not the control characters (or other weird characters) are present in the portion of the name appearing in the glob pattern.\nHaving copied the \\-quoted version of the filename given to you by ls, you can paste this into a command. You don't have to modify it manually in any way. In your case, as you wish to delete the file, type rm, type a space, paste the line, and press Enter.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*10.1 ls: List directory contents in the GNU coreutils reference manual.\n\n*My answer to that question, which is very different from your question but touches heavily on issues of how ls (and dir) displays strange filenames.\n\n\nA: once, i've created a file to open Nautilus as root, but the file name when seeing from nautilus was \"File Browser (root)\", then when i tried to remove as\n$ rm \"File Browser (Root)\"\n$ sudo rm \"File Browser (Root)\"\n$ sudo rm \"File Browser (Root).desktop\"\n\nthe only anwser i got was: \"rm: cannot remove 'File Browser (Root).desktop': No such file or directory\"\nthen when i run:\n$ ls -l\n\ni saw/remembered that the file name, in fact, was \"Nautilus-root.desktop\"\nso i run:\n$ sudo rm \"Nautilus-root.desktop\"\n\nworked for me, hope it helps !\n\nA: I had a similar situation, after using rsync to backup my Pictures directory on a Mac and reading it on Ubuntu.\nThere were two files (actually directories) with different names, but having the same content. I deleted one to the Trash (using Nautilus), but could not delete the other, even from the command line. It would say:\n$ rmdir Pictures\nrmdir: failed to remove 'Pictures': No such file or directory\n$ rm Pictures\nrm: cannot remove 'Pictures': Is a directory\n\nAfter checking the inode numbers with ls -i -l it turned out that both directories have the same inode number. Looks like a hard link...\nThe solution was surprisingly simple - empty the Trash by right clicking on the icon.

I did an upgrade to GNOME 3.16.\nI checked /usr/share/gnome-control-center and /usr/share/unity-control-center, but the logo can't be found there. Also tried to search it in nautilus with various search terms. \nIs is possible that it's linked to cache or saved files in /etc/skel or ~/.config ?\n\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n\nA: You have to download the source:\napt-get source gnome-control-center and gnome-control-center-data\n\nGo into the source/panel directory. \nReplace UbuntuLogo.png and check inside config files inside that directory.

Two other locations within sources requiring renaming: debian/rules and debian/patches/56_use_ubuntu_info_branding.patch.\nBottom line source only solution.

So I have successfully installed joomla on my apache2 server, but the default page is still the index.html.  That is, when I click on the preview in my joomla manager, it goes to index.html!\nThe very same index.html recommends that I delete it, but for the life of me I can't figure out how.  I can't send it to trash, I can't manually delete it.  I can copy it to another folder and then delete the copy, but this doesn't really help.\nFrom this quesiton: Editing index.html in apache2\nIt looks like with the right sudo command I could delete this file.  I would probably cd into the folder and run some sort of delete command?\nThanks in advance for the help!  If it weren't for this SE I don't know if I would be able to learn this new operating system!\n\nA: The quickest way is to run the following command from the command-line terminal:\nsudo rm /var/www/html/index.html\n\nThe default location of that file is /var/www/html/index.html\nThe rm command is used to delete a file.\nsudo is used to give the root permisions to delete this file, as there is a good chance your user is not a member of the correct group.\n\nA: Very simple.\nThis is because, during each deployment, CodeDeploy first deletes all files from the previous deployment, which are listed in a cleanup log file. If there are files in the target installation folders that aren’t listed in this cleanup file, the CodeDeploy agent by default interprets this as an error and fails the deployment.\nRemove the files from the locations and instances to which they were previously deployed, and then try the deployment again.\nOpen your server on the terminal and type\nrm /var/www/html/index.html\nRedeploy again.\n", "Q: How do I prevent Kubuntu from forgetting its sticky keys settings?

Well, last night I booted to Win 7 and through Disk Management I deleted the contents of the Ubuntu partition and now when i boot the system the screen says GRUB recovery....not sure how to resolve this issue.\n\nA: *\n\n*reinstall ubuntu\n\n*change the grub order so that if you do nothing Windos will start as first.\nYou can use an easy-to-use the GUI application called Grub Customizer to make your life a little bit easier. As the name suggests, you can do much more than just reordering GRUB menu entries with it.\n\n\nYou can install it by typing the following in the Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nsee How do I change the GRUB boot order?. (note change the time out from 10 to 5, so Windows wille start after 5 sec. if you do nothing).\n\nA: GRUB is the bootloader that Ubuntu installed on your hard disk, replacing the Windows 7 bootloader. It can't run without certain files from your Ubuntu partition, which you deleted. You'll need to reinstall the Windows 7 bootloader. To do this, you'll Windows 7 install media.

It will not work unless the interfaces it should use are already configured when it starts up.\nNow, that does not mean that the other interfaces on your machine could not be obtaining their IP address from some other DHCP server, but it cannot autoassign itself an IP address.\nSo, what does /etc/network/interfaces say?

In display settings I'm only seeing my main screen and my second screen, not any other \"Unknown display\", so there's nothing to remove there. I didn't find any other solution yet. When I'm disabling the second screen, my cursor no more flickers. I'm not having this issue on Windows 7.\nEdit : Another detail. If I'm putting my cursor in-between my two screens, the half is flickering, and the other is not.\nAny idea?

Thanks!\n\nA: You could try enter this in the terminal it might work:\ngsettings set org.settings.gnome-cursor active=false\n\nonly idea I have, and it might work fine this way.\n\nA: I've found the setting @Michael; not sure if it helps though, YMMV.\ngsettings list-schemas helps as it lists the available schema.\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active reports the current value,\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active false changes it.\nFor me there seems little change, the mouse cursor is only available reliably on the top couple of lines of the screen.\n", "Q: Canon MG3250 Printer Colours I have just purchased a Canon MG3250 printer for it's wireless functionality.

Little deeper and I saw that the NIC port labels were changed from em1, em2 to eth0 and eth1! I mean \"ip link ls\" showed different names. Also, the Boot screen started showing Network ports for booting which is fine.

As I was doing some sorting of my collection of CDs, I found out that processing the output of a find with sort -u was giving me a smaller list than plain sort, so I investigated. Using diff on the outputs, I found out the name of the repeated file, and I went to actually check how the same file can exist twice. Indeed, the file that was being repeated, 32, exists twice in fonts/basic. The filesystem is ISO9660:\nroot@user-desktop:/mnt/loop/fonts/basic# ls -al\ntotal 22\ndr-xr-xr-x 1 root root  2048 1978-07-01 00:47 .\ndr-xr-xr-x 1 root root 12288 1978-07-01 00:48 ..\n-r-xr-xr-x 1 root root  3884 1978-07-01 00:47 32\n-r-xr-xr-x 1 root root  3884 1978-07-01 00:47 32\n\nroot@user-desktop:/mnt/loop/fonts/basic# ls -l -i\ntotal 8\n203394 -r-xr-xr-x 1 root root 3884 1978-07-01 00:47 32\n203394 -r-xr-xr-x 1 root root 3884 1978-07-01 00:47 32\n\nOK, so they are hardlinked because they have the same inode, but how can they have the same name?  And why do they report only having one hardlink?\nroot@user-desktop:/mnt/loop/fonts/basic# mount|grep mnt/loop\n/dev/loop0 on /mnt/loop type iso9660 (ro)\n\nCan anybody think of an explanation? Is it something about the ISO9660 filesystem?\n\nA: Let's make a plain ISO9660 filesystem:\nmkdir cd\necho 'hello world' > cd/foo\necho '42' > cd/bar\ngenisoimage -o cd.iso cd\n\nMount, examine, and unmount it:\ngnome-disk-image-mounter cd.iso\nls -li /media/user/CDROM\n 1474 -r--------  1 user  user     3 Jul 18 19:38 bar\n 1475 -r--------  1 user  user    12 Jul 18 19:38 foo\numount cd.iso\n\nNow open the image in a hex editor, and replace FOO.;1 with BAR.;1.  If it's helpful, the inode numbers on my system are really the offset of the directory entry into the ISO image / 32, i.e. look at around python -c 'print hex(inode*32)'.\nISO9660, like FAT, doesn't have inodes, but Linux pretends it does.  All information is stored directly in the directory, and as each variable length entry is at a minimum more than 32 bytes, this guarantees all 'inodes' are unique.\nNow remount it and look again:\ngnome-disk-image-mounter cd.iso\nls -li /media/user/CDROM\n 1474 -r--------  1 user  user     3 Jul 18 19:38 bar\n 1474 -r--------  1 user  user     3 Jul 18 19:38 bar\numount cd.iso\n\nNotice the 'inode' numbers and file sizes.  Both files are still there in the image, but the duplicate filename confuses Linux, causing it to list the first file twice.  The second file is completely inaccessible now anyway.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server 14.04 CLI visual details Basically I am trying to find out everything that there is to find out about the visual details of CLI of Ubuntu Server 14.04.

For my work, I regularly mount two network drives via sshfs in Xubuntu 15.05. Now I've written a little bash script to mount/unmount both drives & create a symlink to them in local bin to make things easier for myself, and they work fine. The problem is that I can only mount these network drives when VPN is connected, and when I suspend my laptop (which I sometimes have to do very unexpectedly) the VPN connection gets broken without the disks being unmounted. After resuming the session later, the disks seem to be stuck between mount and unmount. I cannot access the disks, but I can also not unmount them, or even remount them.

Please post output of\nsudo iptables -vL INPUT -n\n\nIf incoming connections on 80/tcp are indeed allowed but somehow you're unable to access your web server from outside of the network, you might want to log into the web server and use tcpdump to capture incoming traffic to see if any connection attempts are reaching it.\nUse:\nexport ext_if=$(ip ro | awk '/^default via/ {print $5}')\nsudo tcpdump -i ${ext_if} port 80\n\nIf you don't see any connections when you're trying to connect to your web server from outside of your network, you need to fix that first.\nIf the firewall on your machine doesn't allow incoming connections to reach port 80/tcp, fix this by running the command below and verify:\nsudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n\nUPDATE: you also mentioned:\n\nThis is the tcpdump output after making a request to my public ip from\n  the same machine the server is running on\n\nThis isn't likely to work. The path your request takes is:\n192.168.0.4 =>\n<public_ip> (doing source and destination NAT, aka port forwarding) =>\n192.168.0.4\n\nAs you can see in the tcpdump output, there are 3 HTTP requests initiated by whatever tool you used to open the connection to your web server, the router rejects all connections by responding with packets with RST (\"reset\", i.e. \"go away, close the connection\") flag set.\nAs far as I know, many devices providing NAT won't let you initiate a request from within the network behind NAT to its public IP address and then back to the host behind the same NAT by means of port forwarding (destination NAT).\nYou should try making a request from outside of your network. If you don't have an external host where you can log in and use i.e. wget/curl to make the request try some of the many web based tools to do it, such as http://www.infobyip.com/httpservertest.php\nIf this works, and you get a result which contains at least the HTTP request status code (i.e. 200, 302, 404, etc.) and some response headers such as Server, Content-Type, this will confirm that:\n\n\n*\n\n*your public IP is accessible from outside\n\n*the configured port forwarding works\n\n*the server on your network indeed receives the request and responds to it.\n\n\nIf you want to be able to access your webserver using its public IP from within the same network, you might either:\n\n\n*\n\n*add an appropriate entry to your /etc/hosts file, pointing the server's domain name to your web server's private address (a temporary hack).\n\n*run a so-called split-dns server (preferred but not worth if it's just for yourself)\n\n*reconfigure your router to allow such connections. This can be done but it's unlikely that your home router (if that's what you have) will be able to do that.\n\n", "Q: Partial upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10 I was trying to upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10 but due to a brief wifi disconnect, at some point the upgrade failed.\nSince everything was working fine and some packages were modified, I ran apt-get upgrade to update my packages.\nWhen I logged in, the login screen said \"Ubuntu 14.10\" but when I check the Overview page in system settings, it shows \"Ubuntu 14.04\" Also, I am getting random errors like \"You are not allowed to perform this action\" when I try to change network settings or settings in the update manager.\nIs there any way I can go back to 14.04 or finish my upgrade to 14.10?

Looking at the computer's specs you have an AMD video card, so you may be able to work around the problem by installing AMD's video drivers. Pilot6 said you just need to type sudo apt-get install fglrx into your console, but it is not entirely correct, as the last LTS release -14.04.2 LTS- is not able to install this package at all, because of the LTS Enablement Stack. I had this very problem not long ago and the solution may be a little obscure.\nThe solution\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the Software and Updates dialog, either by searching in the dash or by looking for it in the settings manager. You can also type software-properties-gtk in a terminal to obtain the same effect.\n\n*Navigate to the Updates tab and activate Pre-released updates (trusty-proposed).\n\n*Wait for apt to syncronize, then close the Software and Updates dialog.\n\n*To successfully install the drivers either run:\nsudo apt-get install fglrx/trusty-proposed fglrx-amdcccle/trusty-proposed\n\nor:\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-updates/trusty-proposed fglrx-amdcccle-updates/trusty-proposed\n\n\n*Reboot and check if the driver works by typing fglrxinfo. The expected output should look like this:\ndisplay: :0.0  screen: 0\nOpenGL vendor string: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\nOpenGL renderer string: AMD Radeon HD 7400 Series\nOpenGL version string: 4.4.13374 Compatibility Profile Context 15.20.1013\n\nI hope this helps, let us know of any changes in your situation. :)\nSource\n\nA: If writing \"slow\" you mean the interface, then try to install propritary video drivers. It can be done by\nsudo apt-get install fglrx\n\nand reboot.\n\nA: Most likely its a video problem as person above me said, in any case after you get new drivers you can make your system a bit faster by installing preload, disabling some start ups if dont need them, and by reducing swapness to 10%. \n\nA: The HP 15-1009 is a nice little notebook computer, the only disadvantage being that it has a very slow processor. It's got more than enough RAM to support the integrated Radeon HD 8210 GPU, so your challenge is to do whatever you can to take the processing load off the CPU. For this purpose you need to choose the Ubuntu edition with the most lightweight desktop environment, which is any currently supported version of Lubuntu. 64-bit is faster than 32-bit in most cases. The biggest difference between different releases of Lubuntu is that Lubuntu 14.04 is a Long Term Support release which is supported by updates for three years until April, 2017 and the other releases are regular releases which are only supported for 9 months after the official launch date.  \nInstalling the proprietary graphics drivers for the Radeon HD 8210 GPU shouldn't be a problem. Open the terminal and run ubuntu-drivers devices to show the Recommended proprietary graphics driver, and then install that one.\nThe HP 15-1009 is a good notebook with a lot of character. If you conform to the conditions that its hardware dictates, it should perform acceptably. Try QupZilla instead of Firefox. QupZilla is the only lightweight web browser that I have ever used that I consider to be usable on a daily basis. If you also have Firefox installed, you can import your Firefox bookmarks into QupZilla. \nQupZilla has renamed itself as Falkon and be installed by the following command in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu:\nsudo snap install falkon  \n\nAnother lightweight application that I recommend is Exaile music player.\n", "Q: Duel boot ubuntu and hackintosh I have an Lenovo Yogo 2 Pro with ubuntu installed.

You need to find the mountpoint of your drive, and change the permissions of that folder.\nTo find the mountpoint, open a terminal and type mount. This will show you a list of all the partitions mounted, and where they are mounted. Find your device and remember where it's mounted. If you don't know the device name, it will usually be mounted someplace in /media.

Samba server rejects me for a first time but lets me in on second try. Actually, the same behavior show Linux and Mac OSX clients too, so it's not a Windows issue. I can simulate this from linux console following way:\nnas@AGStorage:~$ smbclient -U AG //agvault/backup\nEnter AG's password:\nsession setup failed: NT_STATUS_NO_MEMORY\nnas@AGStorage:~$ smbclient -U AG //agvault/backup\nEnter AG's password:\nDomain=[HOME] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.1.13-Ubuntu]\nsmb: \\> q\n\nI tried to analyze the behavior with Wireshark and it shows clear that Windows tries first with AG (remember the user name in Windows is AG) and gets error, then comes with ag second time and gets Ok from samba server.\nWhen I simulate the login with ag it lets in with a single try:\nnas@AGStorage:~$ smbclient -U ag //agvault/backup\nEnter ag's password:\nDomain=[HOME] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.1.13-Ubuntu]\nsmb: \\> q\n\nI've tried suggested in internet solution: Adding a line username map = /etc/samba/usermap.txt to my smb.conf with ag = AG inside of mentioned usermap.txt but it does not work in my case.\nHow can I fix this inconsistent behavior of samba server? Any ideas?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Following command helps a lot:\nsudo service winbind stop\n\nSomehow (I do not know exactly how) my samba server is missconfigured to talk to winbind even if it has a standalone server role. This seams to cause a misscommunication with winbind and NT_STATUS_NO_MEMORY failure on first login.\nHave fun ppl!\n", "Q: How to replace Ubuntu with Windows 8.1 How can I replace ubuntu with Windows 8.1?\nI got my Windows CD, but Ubuntu cannot read it or I just don't know how to run it on Ubuntu.\n\nA: You need to boot from the disc. To do this, assuming your BIOS supports booting from a disc, put the disc into the disc drive and turn your computer off. Next, when you first turn your computer on, interrupt your BIOS. Usually this is done with the F12, Delete, or Escape keys. That should bring up an option to boot from the disc. Choose that, and the Windows installation screen should come up.\n", "Q: How to disable xubuntu touchpad I have a Lenovo T410, and the touchpad acts 'quirky' occasionally (cursor jumps around screen).\nIs a toggle function that allows me to disable the touchpad when I want (and use the eraser pad), and re enable it when I want?\n\nA: You can look for your touchpad id using \"xinput\" command.\nThen disable touchpad by\nxinput disable <id>\n\n", "Q: Error Updating MYSQL package My computer froze and I forgot it was updating in the background so I restarted it. When I rebooted I tried to login (and if I entered the wrong password it said incorrect password), but then the screen would go blank for a second and then return to the login screen. I booted into recovery mode and ran the package recovery manager. That did the trick and allowed me to log back in. I ran sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install to make sure all packages were updated correctly. However, mysql is no longer working (I cannot turn the service on). When I try sudo apt-get install  here is the error message:\n2 not fully installed or removed.\nAfter this operation, 0 B of additional disk space will be used.\nSetting up mysql-server-5.5 (5.5.43-0ubuntu0.14.04.1) ...\nstart: Job failed to start\ninvoke-rc.d: initscript mysql, action \"start\" failed.\nNo apport report written because the error message indicates its a followup error from a previous failure.\n                          dpkg: error processing package mysql-server-5.5 (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of mysql-server:\n mysql-server depends on mysql-server-5.5; however:\n  Package mysql-server-5.5 is not configured yet.\n\ndpkg: error processing package mysql-server (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n mysql-server-5.5\n mysql-server\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI also tried sudo apt-get -f install but got the same error message. My question is how do I fix the problem and get the database working again, with an abundance of caution to make sure that the the actual mysql databases/tables do not get deleted.\nUpdate\nFollowing this answer I removed mysql and reinstalled.\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-client-5.5 mysql-client-core-5.5 mysql-common mysql-server mysql-server-5.5 mysql-server-core-5.5\n\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nThe final step did not work (it installed, but at the end of installation it said root password was already set and database would not start). Instead of doing the final step in the terminal, I had webmin install mysql (which is how I originally set up the database) and the database would start and stop no problem. Except my database directory location is on a second hard drive at /media/D/mysql/, not at /var/lib/mysql and what was working was only a much older set of files that never got deleted from /var/lib/mysql when I copied them to the second hard drive.\nFollowing these instructions, which I originally used to change the directory, I edited the relevant configuration files (obviously I did not copy the files over to the D drive as they're already there, I just edited the configuration files). After I change the database directory location the database will no longer start.\nHere is what's in the error log (terminal just tells you it can't start):\n50514 16:50:55 [Note] Plugin 'FEDERATED' is disabled.\n/usr/sbin/mysqld: Table 'mysql.plugin' doesn't exist\n150514 16:50:55 [ERROR] Can't open the mysql.plugin table.

It would be so much easier if the error message said the directory does not exist!!!!\n\nA: Make sure your my.cnf doesn't have any options that have been deprecated.  I had a similar problem because I had default-character-set listed under [mysqld], but in the newer version of mysql this had been renamed to character_set_server.  However, mysql very unhelpfully let me know of this by simply hanging when trying to start the service.  And the package manager will generally try to stop and/or start the service when installing a new version.\nTo check, try running mysqld by itself.  If there are config problems, it should say so and die immediately.\n", "Q: Another OS Like Windows server on MAAS Nodes Is it possible in near future to have other OS like Windows Servers on MAAS as nodes?\n\nA: I will divide your question in two parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to have a Windows Server as a MAAS node?\nYes, as this is FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) anything is possible as long as you find enough people willing to develop something.\n\n*In the near future?\nYes, MAAS can provision Windows Server 2012 RT/Hyper-V since 2014... \n\nA: Until you have option to add windows as custom image to your cluster you have another solution:\n\n\n1) There is a charm \"virtme\" which can provide VM services\n\n2) You can have Windows on those VMs\n\n\nhttps://javacruft.wordpress.com/2013/06/25/virtme/\n\nMIXING PHYSICAL AND VIRTUAL SERVERS WITH JUJU AND MAAS\n", "Q: How can I launch Chromium from Dash/Unity with switches? I want to launch Chromium browser with the --no-referrers switch, which was mentioned on this site. However, I'm not sure how to do that.\nNormally, I use the Dash to launch Chromium, how do I add the switch to block the referrers?\nThanks.\n\nA: You need to edit the chromium-browser.desktop file a bit, but best practice is to edit a local copy of it in ~/.local/share/applications.\nWhat you need to do\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the global chromium-browser.desktop from /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications\ncp /usr/share/applications/chromium-browser.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n\n\n*Open the file:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/chromium-browser.desktop\n\nLook for the first line, starting with\nExec=\n\nChange it to:\nExec=chromium-browser --no-referrers\n\nSave the file and log out/in to make Dash change its focus from the global chromium-browser.desktop file to the local one.\nAlternatively\nMaybe even better would be to set the option as a shortcut to your launcher.

Use chromium and after you closed it, wait a little and close the terminal.\n\nA: Download this. It is a program called Main Menu that lets you make launchers with custom commands. Create a new launcher and tell it to run the command chromium-browser --no-referrers. You can find a chromium logo on google and set it as the icon if you want.

Does anyone has an idea on how to solve this?\nI'm using Chromium 41.0.2272.76 and Ubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: You can solve this by adding the shortcut to your applications folder.\nHere's how I do it via point and click.\nGiven that you've set the app the open in it's own window,\n\n\n*\n\n*From the App launcher, or the chrome://apps page, right click the web app and select Create shortcuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n*From the pop-up, select Desktop.\n\n\n*\n\n*This allows you to rename the shortcut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Next, navigate to your home folder and hit Ctrl + H to view hidden files and folders.\n\n*Naviate to .local > share > applications.\n\n*Cut and Paste the app shortcut you created in step 2 into this folder.\n\n\nNow anytime you click the app via the App launcher or the apps page, the web app will launch in it's own window, and icon of the web app will appear in the lanuncher (and in the application switcher when you use  Alt + Tab).

I need to install Ubuntu 15.04 with both standard options - \"Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\" and \"Use LVM with the new Ubuntu installation\". I don't want to create a swap partition, or at the very least I need to decrease it to the minimum, because by default it's taking up 16GB that will never be used. \nHow can I make this work? If I choose \"Something else\" I can't see any clear options how to accomplish this.\n\nA: The ubuntu installer (ubiquity) is quite limited in this regard. So we need to do it manually instead of the installer.\nSo when you run the Live CD/USB, choose \"Try ubuntu\", and launch gparted to partition your drive.\nYou need to make an ESP (sda1) (if you use EFI+GPT), a boot partition (256MB for example, sda2), another partition (for example, sda3) that will hold the crypted container called LUKS.\nThen open a terminal (ctrl-alt-t)\nSetup LUKS device\nsudo cryptsetup --key-size 512 luksFormat /dev/sda3\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 crypted\n\nSetup LVM on LUKS\nIf you don't want to use multiple partition, you can skip the following paragraph and avoid LVM.

Thank you for all your help. The solution was just to downgrade. Didn't even need to install the OS for it to work, it worked inside the installer.\nMy mother's old laptop was running Windows 7. For one reason or another, she decided she didn't want it, so I took it and installed Ubuntu 15.04 on the laptop. Now before I did this, her Wireless Card inside the laptop went out (For one reason or another, we don't know), so we bought a little USB WiFi Adapter. It's a netgear for anyone wondering. The installation went perfect without any hitches, expect the WiFi won't work. Now I'm not saying it's 100% dead, that's anything but true. I can still scan for networks and see them in the network list, but when I try to connect to my hidden network, using WPA2-PSK [AES], it will keep doing the little \"connecting\" animation in the status bar, then after about 10 minutes, stop, and quit trying to connect. Is there anyway I can connect to my Internet? Also, I do NOT have access to Ethernet at the time. I can get access, but it would take me a while.

I am currently using Ubuntu 14.04 on my very low end computer (it has pentium 4 2.8 GHz, with 1 Gb ram and 40 Gb HDD). The problem is that it gets really slow every now and then, though it is much smoother than Windows! However, am looking for something more buttery to use.\nI have spent a lot of time (since I am new to Linux) in installing apps such as Red Eclipse, Google Chrome, uTorrent and many more into my current OS.\nI have heard that Lubuntu would be the best choice for me, and have confirmed that with my own research on Google, as I would be using it for low end gaming, listening to music, web surfing, online gaming (Miniclip), movies, torrenting, some programming and some photo and light video editing.\nHow can I change from Linux Ubuntu to Linux Lubuntu without losing any data? Will my currently installed apps work on Linux Lubuntu as well?\nSome additional questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I make Lubuntu look better and really good to the eye after I have installed it?\n\n*Are the terminal commands almost the same in Lubuntu as they are in Ubuntu?\n\n*How would I connect my PPPoE connection in Lubuntu?\n\nA: The best way is to install lubuntu from scratch, but you will need to install applications again. You can install lubuntu desktop by running\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nBut some Ubuntu services will keep starting and making the system slow.\nAnd yes, all applications will work on lubuntu. And terminal commands are same.\n\nA: I am unable to reply in full and with sufficient precision to your question, however, I do have lubuntu running on mac, so, in the hope that someone more knowledgeable will chip in soon:\nYes, you can install lubuntu without loosing your data and applications. At login you will have to choose which front-end to load, unity or lubuntu.\nYou can install it via command line:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nOr you can find it in the software centre. \nmore info here: What kinds of desktop environments and shells are available?\nIn general, I found most apps will work when switching between different front-ends, but not all the time. The main problems I had were with lesser apps, though, not well established ones.\nInstalling Lubuntu Desktop will install a range of apps which integrate well with Lubuntu and are light weight. You might find yourself with many alternative apps to what you already have with installed by default in unity.\nYou can  certainly customize Lubuntu a lot, as a starting point, it is very different from Unity, more like windows XP somewhat.\nYou might want to look into Enlightment too, which is a windows manager but very evolved and very light, so an alternative to lubuntu and unity. Again, you can install it and choose it at login.\nCommand line will be similar, commands you know and user in ubuntu will work exactly the same.\nI cannot help you with pppoe, hopefully somebody will answer that :)\n", "Q: How to make a batch file add users to groups? I need help with a GCSE project, I'm stuck on the last question. It asks for a bash script to create users, and then assign them to groups. I've already made the script add new users, but I'm unsure of how to add them to groups in the bash script (bash script made with nano).\nAny help/examples?\nMy current script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to add a user to Linux system\nif [ $(id -u) -eq 0 ]; then\n    read -p \"Enter username : \" username\n    read -p \"Enter password : \" password\n    egrep \"^$username\" /etc/passwd >/dev/null\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"$username exists!\"\n        exit 1\n    else\n        pass=$(perl -e 'print crypt($ARGV[0], \"password\")' $password)\n        useradd -m -p $pass $username\n        [ $? -eq 0 ] && echo \"User has been added to system!\" || echo \"Failed to add a user!\"\n    fi\nelse\n    echo \"Only root may add a user to the system\"\n    exit 2\nfi\n\n(It looks something like that)\n\nA: You can use this modified script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to add a user to Linux system\n\nif [ \"$(id -u)\" -eq 0 ]; then\n    read -p \"Enter username : \" username\n    read -p \"Enter password : \" password\n    IFS=' ' read -a grps -p \"Enter group names : \"\n\n    if grep \"^${username}:\" /etc/passwd &>/dev/null; then\n        echo \"$username exists!\"\n        exit 1\n    else\n        pass=$(perl -e 'print crypt($ARGV[0], \"password\")' $password)\n\n        if useradd -m -p \"$pass\" \"$username\" &>/dev/null; then\n            echo \"User has been added to system!\"\n\n            for grp in \"${grps[@]}\"; do\n                usermod -a -G \"$grp\" \"$username\" && echo \"User is added to group $grp\" \\\n                || echo \"Failed to add user to group $grp\"\n            done\n\n        else\n            echo \"Failed to add a user!\"\n        fi\n     fi\n\nelse\n    echo \"Only root may add a user to the system\"\n    exit 2\nfi\n\nNote that you should always quote the variables.\nHere i have added mainly two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*IFS=' ' read -a grps -p \"Enter group names : \" will ask root to give space separated group names to which the newly created user will be a member of\n\n*Then this short for loop over the values of the array grps:\nfor grp in \"${grps[@]}\"; do\n     usermod -a -G \"$grp\" \"$username\" && echo \"User is added to group $grp\" \\\n     || echo \"Failed to add user to group $grp\"\ndone\n\nGiven the groups already exist. If not you can use groupadd to create the group and then add the user to that group. \nHere we have used usermod to add the user to an existing group, these groups will be supplementary groups for the user.\nCheck man usermod for details.\nNote that you should not use egrep, it is deprecated in favor of grep -E. In fact in this case you don't need grep -E.\nYour grep pattern will fail in certain cases e.g. if you have a user foobar and you are adding a new user named foo. To overcome this, match the username followed by a : (given no username has :) :\ngrep \"^${username}:\" /etc/passwd &>/dev/null\n\nAlso send STDERR to /dev/null too.\nThis can be simplified as:\nif grep \"^${username}:\" /etc/passwd &>/dev/null; then\n        echo \"$username exists!\"\n        exit 1\nelse ......\n\nAlso the next if statement with useradd can follow this.\n**Also some other improvements can be made to your current script, that would not fit in this context.\n", "Q: Re-installing OS's, best order? So I was going to take this weekend to throw in another SSD and install Ubunutu on it. But Windows (Win 7) has been acting up lately, so I was thinking I was going to go ahead and reinstall Windows while I was at it (I usually do this once a year-ish just to keep things clean). So what's the best order to do so?\nWipe and resinstall Windows SSD first, then throw in second SSD and install Ubuntu?\nThrow in second SSD, install Ubunutu on it, then wipe and resintall Windows SSD?\nDoesn't really matter?\n\nA: Since you are installing on separate SSD's, it shouldn't really matter.\nHowever, I HIGHLY recommend disconnecting the SSD (and all other hard drives) from your motherboard that you are NOT going to currently install anything on, it will drastically decrease your chances of error.\n\nA: Windows will try it's best to nuke grub if you install it after Ubuntu.\n\nInstall Ubuntu after Windows\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\nA Windows OS should be installed first, because its bootloader is very particular and the installer tends to overwrite the entire hard drive, wiping out any data stored on it. If Windows isn't already installed, install it first. If you are able to partition the drive prior to installing Windows, leave space for Ubuntu during the initial partitioning process. Then you won't have to resize your NTFS partition to make room for Ubuntu later, saving a bit of time.\nWhen a Windows installation already occupies the entire hard drive, its partition needs to be shrunk, creating free space for the Ubuntu partition. You can do this during the Ubuntu installation procedure, or you can see How to Resize Windows Partitions for other options.\nIf you have resized a Windows 7 or Vista partition and cannot boot up Windows, you can use the instructions from WindowsRecovery to fix it. \n\n", "Q: User can log in with old and new passwords Running Ubuntu 12.04, I changed the password of a user using \nsudo passwd user\n\nbut now that user is able to log in using both the old password and the new password.

I'm starting by building off of an existing theme, so if there's an icon already there I just replace the one with the right file name. But I can't figure out what I need to name icons I'm adding for programs that aren't already in the theme. Where can I find the names for icons for individual programs?\n\nA: As my comment appeared a good explanation for you I converted it into answer with some editions. \nAs stated all icons are located in /usr/share/icons/nameoftheme pick an icon theme and check the icons in apps folder. You can edit icon with other one for example:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop\n\nChange the icon= string providing a path to a new image or move your new icon to /usr/share/icons/nameoftheme and name it firefox.\nThe same if some of your apps is missing an icon provided by theme probably because it doesn't have such icon name, for example Guayadeque Music Player usually missing its new icon when new theme is applied instead original icon is used. What you can do is to check Guayadeque icon command with e.g.:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/guayadeque.desktop\n\nor directly:\ncat /usr/share/applications/guayadeque.desktop | grep -i icon\n\nif it says:\nicon=guayadeque\n\nGo to the theme folder and you can rename some music icon or create new one with the name guayadeque if it doesn't allow you to create a new one then run Nautilus with sudo priveleges gksudo nautilus.\nDo mention to name icon format if you providing a path to it manually otherwise it won't take effect for example if it .svg:\nicon=/home/admin/pictures/guayadeque.svg\n\nor if the icon is present in current theme folder then simply:\nicon=guayadeque\n\nTo list your desktop applications that you can edit or etc you can use ls command:\nls /usr/share/applications/*\n\n", "Q: Videos stop playing after I suspend or there is an automatic suspension of the system I have Ubuntu 14.04.

Everything in /home/user/ can be changed to your user.  If you chown the others your system will break.  And when you chown you need to make sure you chown to the user and NOT just some name you choose.  It will be the same name as the folder under /home/. Do not change either permissions or ownership of anything but files under /home/user/.\nsudo chown -v -R user:user /home/user/\n\nThe command will change the user and the group to the same at the same time. \n\nA: The below is for individual file:\nsudo chown user:user filename\n\nFor an entire directory it will be:\nsudo chown user:user dirName\n\nFor recursive (i.e files and folders inside a folder):\nsudo chown -R user:user dirName\n\nNote: user is, if you do pwd under any Documents, you will see the path: /home/jhon/Documents. Here user is jhon.\n\nA: Just go to the directory you want to change:\ncd /opt/lampp/htdocs\n\nand change the permission using the chown command:\nsudo chown userName -R codeigniter\n\nWhere userName is the username and codeigniter is the folder's name.\n", "Q: Where do I find drivers for 14.04.1 on Dell Inspirion 1720?

Since it's a virtual machine (via VirtualBox), I needed to install guest additions.  However, the installation fails saying (in /var/log/vboxadd-install.log):\n\nError! Your kernel headers for kernel 3.16.0-31-generic cannot be found.\n\nSo, I tried to install it in the usual way and got:\n\nPackage linux-headers-3.16.0-31-generic is not available, but is referred to by another package.  This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source[.]\n\nHaving installed linux-headers-generic, which should provide the correct headers, I was confused.  This is the sort of error I would expect if 3.16.0-31 was out of date.  But . . . indeed dpkg -l | grep generic produces:\n\n...\n  ii  linux-headers-3.19.0-17-generic ...\n  ...\n\nA ha!  So it looks like the guest additions are trying to use an outdated kernel.  Maybe they use uname.  So I tried uname -r and got:\n\n3.16.0-31-generic\n\n\nMy guess is that the guest additions are using uname to get the desired kernel header version, but that uname is giving the incorrect value for whatever reason.  Question: If my analysis is right, how do I fix it?  If not, what's the problem?\n\nEDIT: After looking around, it seems that this means the running kernel is actually 3.16.0-31, while 3.19.0-17 is merely installed.  I sudo update-grubd, confirmed that 3.19 kernel is the 0th element of /boot/grub/menu.lst and rebooted, but it doesn't seem to change anything.\nEDIT: While /boot/grub/menu.lst is correct (the 0th entry is 3.19), on reboot and holding Shift to get the manual menu, I do not see the 3.19 kernel, and the top entry is the 3.16 kernel.\n\nA: It looks like upgrade process from 14.10 to 15.04 has a bug.

It's a .desktop file editor that works well. You can create .desktop files for binary/script files, or .desktop files that run a command. You can also set the icon for the .desktop file.\n\nA: I might be late (as you posted in may), but this is what I figured out. I am also sorry for how much I drag this on, but I am trying to get into detail, for anyone else who has this problem and would like help.\nI found that if you want to search it, you have to add a line in the .desktop file. Here is my .desktop file.\nYou do not have to do this section, but I recommend it:\n\nFor my icon and exec lines, I made a folder in my Home directory called \"Applications\" that I put all my .jar, .sh, etc. files. You can just replace the line with whatever the location for your file is.\nYou can also make a folder for your icons. I didn't, but it would help ;). Again, if in another directory, just replace the line with whatever the location for your file is.\n\nAlso VERY IMPORTANT for the directories. When I made my .desktop file, I forgot to put quotes around the directory to my file. It wouldn't run without it, but I fixed it. This may be the problem. If that is the case, here is an example with and without. I will be using Feed The Beast as an example. If it is the icon that is the problem (eg. not showing), replace Exec= with Icon=. If you are trying to work on a jar file, at the beginning, put java -jar. You need Java to open them. To check if you have it, open a terminal and type java --version.\nNot Working: \n\n\nExec=/home/e1337gamerman/Applications/Feed The Beast/FTB_Launcher.jar\n\n\nWorking:\n\n\nExec=\"/home/e1337gamerman/Applications/Feed The Beast/FTB_Launcher.jar\"\n\n\nJar:\n\n\nExec=java -jar \"/home/e1337gamerman/Applications/Feed The Beast/FTB_Launcher.jar\"\n\n\nI will replace my lines to go along with a .sh file, and I will call it \"Bash.sh\".

Then, just search for it.\nKeywords should be used like so:\n\nKeywords=blah;blah;blah;\n\nFor spaces, you may or may not need quotes. Refer to the Ubuntu help section for that here. Also, multiple need a semicolon, followed by the word without a space. You should close the line by putting a semicolon after the last word.\nThere you go. This looks complicated, but it really isn't. Hope this helps. Have fun!\n\nA: Another reason that can cause the application to not appear in the launcher is if this property is defined:\nNoDisplay=true\n\nFrom the docs\n\nNoDisplay means \"this application exists, but don't display it in the menus\". This can be useful to e.g. associate this application with MIME types, so that it gets launched from a file manager (or other apps), without having a menu entry for it [...]\n\nIf the NoDisplay=true line is present in your .desktop file, delete it in order for the application to show up when searching for it in the Activities (i.e. by pressing the \"Super\" AKA \"Windows\" key).\n\nA: To make it run when double in clicked in nautilus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus.\n\n*Open this from the menu bar:\n\nEdit → Preferences\n\n\n*Select the 'Behavior' tab.\n\n*Select \"Ask each time\" under \"Executable Text Files\".\n\n*Close the window.\n\n\nNow you can double-click your executable text file in Nautilus to be asked whether to execute or edit your script.\n\nSimilarly for Nemo: Nemo --> Edit --> Preferences --> Behaviour --> Executable Text Files --> \"Run executable text files when they are opened\"\n\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04 hangs while browsing using Chromium or Firefox My Xubuntu 14.04 hangs too much when i start to use browsers like chromium or firefox.

I have a dual boot Win7/Ubuntu laptop, HP ProBook 6460b.  When I installed Ubuntu, I set a separate partition for the /home folder and had some trouble setting it up to share with the windows partition.  In the end, I mounted the new partition at /home/storage/, and set my 'home' folder inside there.  This has given me a couple of fits, but has been nominally successful.\nI am having an issue with pulseaudio running, as it reports back that it does not have permissions to run in /home; this is true, because that is not where my home folder is located.  The result is that I have no means to adjust my audio; I can hear things like videos on firefox, but they come out weakly and from only the left front speaker.  \nI suspect that I need to modify the location of the pulseaudio conf file, but I'm not sure how to go about that.  I've been using ubuntu since 12.04, but mostly as a desktop user- if I type very many commands, they tend to be cut n pasted from instructions.\nI have tried a couple things from other threads, and they mostly ended in failures, and none of them ended in fixes.  Purging pulseaudio and reinstalling just removed all my system settings options, which forced me to reinstall ubuntu-desktop.  Force reloading alsa did not help.  I tried adding my user to the 'audio' group, but that didn't change. The last thing I did was install the upgraded hda intel packages from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/UpgradingAlsa/DKMS , also to little avail.  I hope someone can steer me in the right direction with this. It appears I may have managed to install ubuntu in a way that breaks functionality that nobody has tried before.\nThanks!\n\nA: Permission errors are what is to expected if we put our HOME on a NTFS partition, because these will not support the Ubuntu file permissions at all.\nTo shared data with Windows we therefore have to set up a dedicated data-only folder on this NTFS partition which will then be mounted to be accessible from Ubuntu. We can even put a symlink to these folder in our HOME directory. This always needs to be stored on a Linux filesystem (e.g. ext4).\nSee also these related question & answers.\n", "Q: Why Can't GrUB Find a Kernel That It Already Found? After upgrading to 15.04, I need to have kernel headers matching the running kernel (for another package).  \nThe upgrade installed kernel 3.19.0-17.  Just in case, I also installed linux-headers-generic.  Then, I ran sudo update-grub and rebooted.  Yet, the system booted into kernel 3.16.0-31 (as confirmed by uname -r).\nAfter much digging, I found that GrUB recognizes the 3.19 kernel in update-grub and even populates it into /boot/grub/menu.lst.  However, on startup, GrUB only recognizes up to the 3.16 kernel in the boot menu.  How do I fix this, so that GrUB can boot into 3.19?\n\nHere are some outputs from my current system.\nsudo update-grub always produces the following output:\n$ sudo update-grub\nSearching for GRUB installation directory ... found: /boot/grub\nSearching for default file ... found: /boot/grub/default\nTesting for an existing GRUB menu.lst file ... found: /boot/grub/menu.lst\nSearching for splash image ... none found, skipping ...\nFound kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-3.19.0-17-generic\nFound kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-31-generic\nFound kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-40-generic\nFound kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-3.11.0-19-generic\nFound kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-35-generic\nFound kernel: /boot/memtest86+.bin\nFound kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-3.19.0-17-generic\nFound kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-31-generic\nFound kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-40-generic\nFound kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-3.11.0-19-generic\nFound kernel: /boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-35-generic\nFound kernel: /boot/memtest86+.bin\nUpdating /boot/grub/menu.lst ... done\n\nOpening /boot/grub/menu.lst after running update-grub, the very first option is:\ntitle        Ubuntu 15.04, kernel 3.19.0-17-generic\nuuid        ac9d0eaf-e090-4c29-8e7b-30e98ed07d29\nkernel        /boot/vmlinuz-3.19.0-17-generic root=UUID=ac9d0eaf-e090-4c29-8e7b-30e98ed07d29 ro quiet splash\ninitrd        /boot/initrd.img-3.19.0-17-generic\n\nBut, holding Shift during boot, there is no option to choose 3.19 (although I can choose any of the others).

It looks like you have some mix of GRUB and GRUB 2 installed.\nUsing update-grub from the grub package will update the menu.lst file, which will effectively do nothing if the bootloader is GRUB 2, which is what is happening here. Instead, you should install grub2-common (which should uninstall the grub package). Then, when running update-grub (or update-grub2; both do the same thing), the grub.cfg file gets updated instead.\nAnswer based on this answer.\n", "Q: how to to use lapack library, on Ubuntu 14.04 I want to use LAPACK $ BLAS library.

The advice given has been quite scattered and confusing thus far, so I'd like to confirm this here. I guess the more ideal choice would be to boot Windows from Ubuntu and not the other way around.

Should it be the sda (Windows disk) or the sdb (Ubuntu)? \nThanks very much.\n-M.\n\nA: As to part 1 of this post:   Swap with those specs is purely a preference but even /home is not required BUT given your use case HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended as /home is where all those imaging files will go NOT root (/).\nas for part 2 of this post: you will need to better define \"maxing it out\"  but also of note  LibreOffice and kingsoft Office  are BOTH in ubuntu repos and do 98% of Office suite  / mathlab is as well,   \nI personally would have bootloaders on both drives with the primary OS having  control of the loader on that disk(s)  using winboot  for the (mostly) windows drve and grub on the linux drive.\n", "Q: network manager: how to stop nm updating /etc/resolv.conf I do not want network manager to add DNS servers received from DHCP to my /etc/resolv.conf.\nWhen configuring from GUI/Connections/IPV4 and choose the method Automatic (address only) it still adds DNS servers received via DHCP.\nIs it possible to do it per connection (specific ssid ?)\n\nA: One way to stop Network Manager from adding dns-servers to /etc/resolv.conf file is to do this:\nFirst open the nm conf file /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:\nsudo vim /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nAnd add this to the [main] section:\ndns=none\nrc-manager=unmanaged\n\nSave and exit.\n\nA: /etc/resolv.conf is symlinked to /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf.

Those sectors (4 by default I think) consist the Data block. \nso in case suppose\nin system A the files starts from sector 1 of block 0 while in system B it start from sector 0 of block 0. then this leads to different in size since File in system A will reserve more sectors and thus more blocks and though more size\n", "Q: How does the system admin gets the ethernet address of computers in the network?

No problems doing the right click panning in KSP using this.\n\n*Xfce 4.12 (tried with compositing enabled and disabled, no change)\n\n*Nvidia 346.59 drivers\n\n*Performance in KSP is otherwise as expected based on my laptop's hardware\n\n*Packages (including kernel) are all stock\n\n*Mouse is plugged into a USB 3.0 port\n\n\nA: I did find a solution to this problem.\nI installed Windows in a virtual machine, attached the USB mouse device to the VM, then traced the USB traffic with Wireshark and isolated the control command that the official Logitech driver used to set the polling rate. (This was quite helpful in pointing me in the right direction: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/138742/how-to-dump-usb-traffic)\nThis magic Ruby code (must be run as root, or by a user with permission to write to /dev/hidraw1) will set the polling rate to 125Hz on my mouse:\n#!/bin/ruby\nHIDIOCSFEATURE = 0xC0024806\n\nf = File.open(\"/dev/hidraw1\", \"w+\")\nf.ioctl(HIDIOCSFEATURE,\"\\x20\\x03\")\n\n/dev/hidraw1 is the hidraw device for my mouse. This path may be different depending on how many devices you have plugged into your machine.\nThe 0xC0024806 sequence is the ioctl value required to \"Send a feature report\" to the hidraw device. I can't remember exactly how I obtained this value unfortunately, and it may not be 100% technically correct. Works for me though!\nThe \"\\x20\\x03\" sequence was the data that the driver sent in the feature report to the mouse. 20 appears to be the value in hex used to identify a polling change request, and 03 sets it to 125hz. 02 sets it to 250hz, 01 to 500Hz and 00 to 1000hz.\nBE WARNED: This works for me on a Logitech G400 mouse. I think there's only one hardware variant of this mouse so it should be safe on that model. It hasn't been tested on any other model, and will not work on any Logitech mouse that uses the HID++ protocol to communicate (this includes many newer mice, and any wireless models using the Unifying receiver).\nI also barely knew what I was doing, and every single thing I did to figure it out was learned for the first time along the way, including this phrase: Caveat lector (reader beware)!\n\nA: I had the same problem with a Logitech G302.\nPlanetary annihilation mouse lag problem\nUnfortunately, it seems that the Logitech mouse does not support reducing the mouse polling rate.\nBut if it is really necessary, you can reduce it by hardware by connecting your mouse to a slower usb port.\nUsing evhz, I noticed the mouse polling rate reduced from 1000Hz to 250Hz with a different usb port.\n", "Q: How to move/reorder columns in LXTask?

I know that the .desktop files of installed applications will be found in  /usr/share/applications. \nToday, I came across the directory /usr/share/app-install/desktop. It contains the same .desktop files of applications installed in my system.\nSo what is the /usr/share/app-install/desktop directory? Why are there two directories for the same purpose?\n\nUPDATE: Thanks to @serg; he states this question has an answer.\nNow I know what this directory is, but I still have a question:\nIf the .desktop files are all included in /usr/share/app-install/desktop, so why is there also the directory /usr/share/applications? Isn't it a waste of resources to keep both directories up to date?\n\nA: The files encountered are nothing more than symbolic links to meta file data of installed programs.  As Serg explained the apps using the software center go into described folder.  They are not real programs but merely point were the system can cache for faster use next time.  It more effective and efficient to have a system gather all programs and make meta files and symbolically link them in one area.\nBut Ubuntu uses two separate package managers.  One is apt one is the software center.  This in turn creates separate package file systems.  This is how Ubuntu deals with it, but instead of throwing it all together, the two systems act like a couple.  They both communicate to see what is there, both have root access to both, but they do not share what programs are installed by each other\n\nA: Virusboy has the right idea, and after digging around, I can confirm that /usr/share/app-install is related to software manager.

For large jobs, you can shave off another millisecond or so by terminating the commands with + instead of \\; if your find supports it (it probably does).\nEdit: The above commands neglected to handle symbolic links, which can be copied with a third run of find (do not terminate this one with +):\n% find . -type l -exec cp -R {} ../copy_dir/{} \\;\n\n", "Q: Safe to remove downloaded .deb packages after install?

I bought a font from myfonts.com, and installed it on my system by clicking on the .TTF file I received and in the dialog that came up there was a button that said \"Install Font\". Seemed to work, but after a while I realized only certain programs were seeing the font. Wine programs, like Photoshop don't see it, OpenOffice doesn't see it. Inkscape does.\nI looked in my .fonts folder, and clicked on the .TTF file, and this is what I see:\n\nIt can't be a good thing that the \"Name\" field is blank, and there is a question mark under \"Style\".

Every time I open the \"windows file\" in Ubuntu text editor I have to change encoding options.\nSolution is changing encoding from Windows-1250 to utf-8.\nSo the question is how to open each file with Windows-1250 and save it with utf-8, for every file in sub-directories of current directory (recursively I mean). Can I do it in terminal or I need some external application.\nI'm looking forward for your help.\n\nA: I prefer to use recode for this. It's not installed by default, but available through the package by the same name. It also changes CRLF line endings to LF.\nsudo apt-get install recode\nrecode cp1250.. file.txt\n\nYou can do this for all txt files in an entire dir\nrecode cp1250.. ./*.txt\n\nAnd recursively by combining with find\nfind . -type f -name \"*.txt\" -exec recode cp1250.. {} +\n\nThe standard option is to use the iconv command, which is installed by default, but this does not change the line endings, so you need to do that in another step:\niconv -f cp1250 < file.txt | sed $'s/\\r$//' > newfile.txt\n\nIn the long run, I'd recommend changing your windows editor's default character set and line ending to UTF-8 and UNIX line endings (LF,\\n) to avoid having to do the conversion after the fact.\n\nCR means Carriage Return (\\r)\nLF means Line feed (\\n)\nWindows uses both, but unix-like systems uses only LF.\n\nA: Sublime Text makes saving to different file encoding pretty easy.

The one that it is using is constantly at 100% usage and will jump from core to core. For example, cpu1 will be at 100% and then drop to 10% and then cpu5 will jump to 100% for another 10 seconds. I gave the machine 128M graphics ram in vmware but I'm not sure how to start using that. Any way to split the load between all the cpus?\n\nA: You can set number of threads in video codec settings.

I want to be able to move the current tab from the window (with other tabs) to a new window, in the foreground, keeping all other tabs open. I'm using Google Chrome, always up to date, on Ubuntu 14.04.2.\nI'm happy for a script / extension / similar.\nBear in mind I have a number of windows open (maybe 3 or 4).\nIt can't be closing and reopening the tab because I may have unsaved details (e.g. I'm taking a screenshot of the typed content).\n\nA: Personally I can't live without Vimium as it lets me do so much more than just move tabs.\nYou can easily open a tab into a new window with W or you can search across all your open tabs (in all windows) with T or open a url from your history with O. If you were editing text in an input field you may need to hit Esc first to \"unselect\" the field, but that is common with \"modal\" editors like Vim which Vimium borrows many of its ideas and key mappings from.\nA new tab is just a t away as well.\nSadly it doesn't have any direct \"send tab to a specific window\" options like Tab to Window (or at least the version I used to use on Firefox allowed that), but it sounds like you don't need that.\nFor actually moving tabs to organize them I use the extension Tabs Outliner which works great and lets you \"tag\" windows and tabs with notes, and the BEST feature is that you can simply hit Ctrl+s to save out the entire list of tabs to send via email or backup with Dropbox/Drive/etc.\n\nA: There is an extension called Tab Manager\nInstall it and easily you can do what you want\n\nWhen you click on + as shown in the picture this will detach the current tab to a new window\n\nA: Press F6 which selects the search/url field then press it again which would select the tab, then  press shift+F10 (which is right click) from there select the second option \"move tab to new window\" and from there select \"new window\".\n\nA: Use Tab To Window extension of chrome. it will provide you several shortcuts to manage your tabs.\nFor example, use Alt+Shift+X to move the active tab to a new window.\nThe shortcuts are customisable.\n\nA: In case someone is interested in a current solution without extensions:\nIf you just start typing the name of the website you want to access or highlight the URL and press Shift+Return, a new detached window will open.\n", "Q: Using script /bin/sh -c gnome-terminal to open 4 Terminal Windows at Startup I'm trying to open 4 Terminal Windows at startup and I'm using the script below to do so. However, it's only opening 1 terminal Window instead of 4.\n/bin/sh -c gnome-terminal; /bin/sh -c gnome-terminal; /bin/sh -c gnome-terminal; /bin/sh -c gnome-terminal\n\nI'm running the script from within \"Startup Applications\".  If I run the script manually from a Terminal Window it does open 4 Terminal Windows.\nSo here is my question. Why is the script only opening 1 windows from within \nthe \"Startup Applications\" when it should be opening 4?\n\nA: You do not need /bin/sh -c if you are running it from script. Also, use & instead of ;, like so \n#!/bin/bash\n\n\n\ngnome-terminal -t WINDOW-ONE &\ngnome-terminal -t WINDOW-TWO &\ngnome-terminal -t WINDOW-THREE &\ngnome-terminal -t WINDOW-FOUR &\n\nI believe the reason why it behaves like it does in your original script is because the shell is waiting for each line of script to complete first, so it is waiting for the first window to get done. With &, you disconnect gnome-terminal from script, and the script can go on to the next line. Hope that makes sense\n\nA: No need to use a separate script to run four terminal windows on Startup\nYou do not need a separate script to open four gnome-terminal windows, you can simply combine them into one command, to be added to Startup Applications.\nHow to use complex commands in a .desktop file\nWhen you add a command to Startup Applications, it actually creates a .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart, that runs your command on startup (actually log in). The syntax for complex commands to be used in a .desktop file is as follows:\n/bin/bash -c \"<complicated_command>\"\n\nHowever: You only need to use the /bin/bash -c a single time, so the complete command should look like:\n/bin/bash -c \"gnome-terminal&gnome-terminal&gnome-terminal&gnome-terminal\"\n\nDoing so, you do not need a separate script to do the job.\nChaining commands\nLike already mentioned, you should chain the commands with a &, not with ;.\nFrom man bash:\nIf a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0. Commands separated by a ; are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn. The return status is the exit status of the last command executed.\n", "Q: Kubuntu freezes during launch Good evening everyone.\nI have a weird bug since yesterday.\nI have installed  kubuntu 15.04 since his release with no problems.

I'm afraid I'll make things crash and loose all my data if I just disconnect the USB cable by hand.\nHow can I remove USB devices safely from my PC in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?\n\nA: Ubuntu's default file manager, Nautilus, shows an eject button on removable devices.\nBelow you see a screenshot section of Nemo's sidebar when I have my Sony E-reader plugged in. Note the eject button right next to \"READER\".\n\nYou can also eject a drive by right-clicking on its icon in the launcher, and click \"Eject\", as in the image below. E-readers have a Flash Drive icon most of the time.\n\n\nA: Your system give me cause for concern.  Ubuntu does not act like Windoze and mount everything in sight.  Unless you made a script for this, Ubuntu will recongize it but will not force mount.  As for saftly removing just right click on your taskbar and eject device you can also do this open your Files and clicking the eject button next your kindles name under devices.\n", "Q: Problem to stop lightdm I'm trying to stop LightDM, but I receive the following error message (translated from German):\nroot@robert-desktop:/home/robert/Downloads# stop lightdm\nstop: Connection to Upstart not possible: Failed to connect to socket /com/ubuntu/upstart: Connection refused\n\n\nWhat can i do to stop lightdm to Install Nvidia driver?\nThx \n\nA: It is not a good idea to install Nvidia drivers from .run files, downloaded from Nvidia site.

Some sites suggest turning off all error messages altogether which I'd rather not do, others talk about unlocking my phone before plugging it in which I do already, but this message still appears.\n\nA: Interesting question I upvoted it ;) I actually have an Android device and this message pops up all the time I connect my device but I don't pay any attention to it. There's a tweak workaround to play with is USB dubugging mode inside Android System Settings navigate to Applications/Development there you'll find USB debugging.\nWhen you connect your phone the first time and USB debugging is ticked it's not actually right.\nFirstly, untick/unmark USB debugging mode on your Android device, the message will appear:\n\nPress OK on notification message and unplug USB cable. Now plugin USB cable click OK again on notification message and inside System Settings where USB debugging at put a tick/mark on and press OK on your Android notification message and press OK on desktop notification (if any popped up). That's basically it, now unplug and plug USB cable as many times as you want the notification message should not appear. I also tried to logout and login to a new session and the notification message didn't appear either.\n\nA: This worked for me on Ubuntu 14.04:\nOn the Android device, under Settings->Networking, select USB Configuration and change it from \"Charging\" to \"MTP\" (Media Transfer Protocol)\nNo more pop-ups!\n\nA: On my Samsung Galaxy S7, I was able to go into the developer options and simply change the \"USB Configuration\" option to \"Charging\".

Now I want to somehow copy these two programs to other computers. What should I do. The other computers don't have access to internet.\n\nA: As for PlayOnLinux, you may encounter some problems installing it on a system without internet connection.

It turned out that after some time being powered on, the printer would put itself into a different state where its USB connection no longer works. Not sure why, but what helped in my case was to just restart the printer. Simply reconnecting the USB cable would not help, because the printer would still remain in that weird state.\nI have tried it on Linux kernels 4.9 and 4.12, on 3 different computers including Raspberry Pi 3 model B. None of them would even recognize the printer as an USB device after it has put itself into this weird state. There were just errors of the following kind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Device not responding to setup address\n\n*device not accepting address\n\n*and eventually unable to enumerate USB device\nI suspect it is a consequence of Canon printers implementing some kind of power saving mode where they also disable the printer's USB interface.\n", "Q: Open ports for public I am quite new to Ubuntu or any Linux family OS. I am trying to run a server on my laptop (for development reasons, however I have tried this on azure Ubuntu VM too). The server runs on 5222 port and the admin panel is on 5280 port. The server is ejabberd if you need to know it's name.\nThe server is working fine on localhost. I can open the admin panel in localhost:5280/admin . However I want this server to be accessible over internet via public ip. I have tried to forward the port on router. The admin panel started working on private ip such as http://192.168.1.109:5280/admin on the local machine, but if I try it over the lan, it doesn't work at all. The other machine doesn't get connected to the server even if they are on the same lan. I have no luck in public ip too.\nI am not sure but it may be a firewall issue, however I have no idea how to check or even know if it's been blocked.

But if you want to run it from anywhere , you have to put the script into one of the folders listed in your $PATH preferably /usr/bin or add a custom folder to the list.  \nAs for creating a file,  if you specify full path to script , like nano /usr/bin/myscript.sh , yoi don't have to be prese in that directory\n", "Q: Determinate if a file is already opened I want to create a bash script to determine if my file is already opened by another user. \nI have already tried with lsof but it didn't work as i wanted.

There are many users that can be modify .conf file. If two users work on same file, the last saving overwrite the change made from the other user.\nMy script wants to warn the users that the file is already opened by another user and maybe open the file in read-only mode.\nI already tried with ps aux (thx for the hint) but i can't estimate if my file was recently closed.\n\nA: lsof accurately lists all open files.\nThe \"problem\" is that most editors open the file, read the contents (into ram), and then close the file.\nEditors will then open the file when writing changes.\nTo see if any editors are using the file, for all users, run\nps aux | grep file name\n\nExample\nOpen a test.file with nano in one terminal.\nIn another terminal run the follwoing commands:\nbodhi@daemon:~$sudo lsof | grep test.file\n[sudo] password for bodhi: \n\nlsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuse.gvfsd-fuse file system /run/user/1000/gvfs\nOutput information may be incomplete.\n\nNote: no output ;)\nNow run ps aux\nbodhi@daemon:~$sudo ps aux | grep test.file\nbodhi     4736  0.0  0.0 121096  3404 pts/3    S+   17:49   0:00 nano test.file\n\nNow we see the information we want ;)\nnano shows up and we are editing test.file\n\nA: @bodhi.zazen accurately showed what the reason for your files not being shown in the output of lsof.\nWell, since we're lacking a description of your use case, I'll assume that your script\n\n\n*\n\n*does something that takes time\n\n*changes the content of other files which may have been modified between the time your script starts and the time it's ready to alter the file.\n\n\nIf this is the case, one thing you can do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*get the checksum of the file your script intends to modify early with, for instance: sha1sum <file>\n\n*do something time consuming\n\n*check the current checksum of your file. If it's the same as before, it hasn't been modified, if it isn't the same, you can then make a decision and ask the script user to decide whether to overwrite, or to show a diff, etc.\n\n\nIt's not ideal and it's merely a shot in the dark since we're missing context but maybe it will be helpful in some way to you.\n", "Q: How to set terminal application (joe, nano, vi) as default desktop text editor? I would like to know, how can I set a terminal text editor as a default desktop application? I want to double-click file and open it in terminal editor.\n\nA: I think that the right way to do this is to create a Desktop Launcher for your alternative editor, and then modify the MIME database to associate it as the default application for your target mimetype(s). \nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a minimal $HOME/.local/share/applications/myedit.desktop as\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=/usr/bin/nano %F\nTerminal=true\nName=MyEdit\nYou may want to add at least a suitable Icon field, if you have one.\n\n*Edit $HOME/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n[Default Applications]\nx-scheme-handler/mailto=thunderbird.desktop\nmessage/rfc822=thunderbird.desktop\napplication/x-extension-eml=thunderbird.desktop\ntext/plain=myedit.desktop\n\n*Update the MIME database\nupdate-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime\n\nAfter that, double-clicking a plain text file in the Nautilus file manager should open a gnome-terminal and run nano on the file.\n\nA: Short answer: I hope I am wrong, but this is likely impossible or prohibitively difficult.\nThe general answer is you would want to set your terminal as the default App in the GUI, with some some arguments to it.  In my experience, Terminals tend not to support \"run this application\" as an argument and last time I did something like this I had a launcher set an ENV variable which I then checked in my shell's .dotfile to do the right thing.  So, you would have to convince your file browser to use an action like \"export MAGIC_EDITOR=launch-vim; konsole %s\" and then your shell would check MAGIC_EDITOR and pull %s as what ... $1?\nThis can get fragile and may need to be re-done after an upgrade or if you change your terminal preference, &c.\nFar easier to use the GUI form of those text editors.  (Example: gvim is pretty nice, but I prefer the font/colors I already have in my terminal.)\nOf course, within the terminal, you can set the EDITOR and/or VISUAL environment variables.\n", "Q: Cannot reinstall Windows after Ubuntu I recently installed Ubuntu on my laptop(Sony Vaio Duo 13). The laptop ONLY has two USB slots in the back, no disk drive. A bit later I realized that I still needed Windows for programs needed in University. I tried using rufus to make a bootable USB that had Windows 8.1 on it. I tested the USB on a friends laptop and it went right into the Windows installation. When I plug the USB into my computer it says that \"My Sony could not read media(USB/CD).\" I was a bit baffled by this so I made a bootable USB with Ubuntu on it. Ubuntu was able to start up in grub and gave me the option to install it. I reinstalled it to see if that was the case. It was not, I still could not boot to the USB with Windows on it. If I do not boot into Ubuntu, I get into the grub command line. I have also changed my BIOS setting around to each combination of possible differences, no help. I fear that I have deleted or corrupted something in my MBR. If anyone could help, that would be amazing, as I have not been able to fix this problem in days. Nothing on google, reddit or anywhere else has made any difference.\nThanks!\n\nA: You might want to format your complete disk to NTFS format. Windows isn't very keen on anything else when it comes to installing it on your hard drive. With completely formatting it in NTFS (fx. with Gparted when in a Live CD session), you are also deleting GRUB. You should be able to boot into the Windows installer after that.\n", "Q: lvm reporting wrong size after gparted expansion - Ubuntu 14.01 After realizing I had under-allocated space on a hyper-v vm for this Ubuntu install, I expanded the partition in hyper-v and then used gparted to expand the lmv and boot partitions.  However, after that, while the boot partition saw the expansion from 1GB to 5GB, the lvm partition still reports the old size of just under 5GB (though it should be 20GB).  I've attached some screen shots for review.  The item I was curious about was wondering whether or not the remainder of the lvm partition required some sort of additional formatting or something in grub to help the os realize it has a larger disk partition now.  Any help you guys can offer would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The answer is in the last comment by Peter Lacis. See this:\nhttp://www.geoffstratton.com/2013/08/resize-disk-ubuntu-lvm/\nBasically, the partition has been resized, but you need to update the lvm and resize the file system.\nSo, if you've already resized the partition in GParted, then run lvmdisplay and note the \"LV Name\". Then run:\nlvextend -l+100%FREE <lv-name>\n\nNow resize the filesystem. For ext that would be:\nresize2fs <drive>\n\nwhere <drive> is something like \"/dev/mapper/ubuntu--my--root\".\nReally, just go read the article and you'll understand better what is going on. \n", "Q: Reset network settings to what Ubuntu installs The problem is I messed up lots of files (such as networkmanager.conf) and other because my laptop was not connecting to an ad hoc network, it connected to other hotspots like my androids shared internet.

They are named like \nNARUTO 50 — The Fifth Gate- A Splendid Ninja is Born_low.mp4\n\nI want to simply batch rename them to something like this Naruto_50. \nIs there an easy way to do it? I'm comfortable using the terminal.\n\nA: pyRenamer from the from the default Ubuntu repositories is a graphical renamer application that supports renaming files using patterns, including pattern expressions that are built-in in pyRenamer. Move the mouse over the Original file name pattern and Renamed file name pattern fields to show the list of pattern expressions that are available for that field. Click the Preview button to preview your changes before applying them. Click the Rename button to rename the files. This is the easiest way to batch rename a series of video files.\npyRenamer is available from the default Ubuntu repositories in Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier. In Ubuntu 18.04 and later pyRenamer has been replaced by GPRename or the Smart File Renamer snap package (sudo snap install smart-file-renamer).\n\nFor your example you would match the numbers of the videos in the series and the .mp4 extension at the end of the files' names and then replace with Naruto_ at the beginning of the files' names in the Renamed file name pattern field.\n\nA: There is a simple, albeit tedious, way if you want to stick with a shell. You can make use of bash's parameter expansion.\n\n\n*\n\n*String length modification:\n${PARAMETER:OFFSET}: expand from position OFFSET.\n${PARAMETER:OFFSET:LENGTH}: expand from position OFFSET to a final LENGTH.\nFor example:\n$ test=\"This is a long string\"\n$ echo $test\nThis is a long string.\n$ echo ${test:0:4}\nThis\n\n\n*Case modification:\n${PARAMETER^}: first character uppercase.\n${PARAMETER^^}: all uppercase.\n${PARAMETER,}: first lowercase.\n${PARAMETER,,}: all lowercase.\n$ test=\"This Is A Long String\"\n$ echo ${test,}\nthis Is A Long String.\n$ echo ${test,,}\nthis is a long string.\n\n\n*Substring removal:\n${PARAMETER#PATTERN}: remove a PATTERN, like bash understands, from the beginning of the string. Tries to find the shortest match.\n${PARAMETER##PATTERN}: same, but longest match.\n${PARAMETER%PATTERN}, ${PARAMETER%%PATTERN}: from the ending of the string.\nFor example:\n$ test=\"This is a long, long string.\"\n$ echo ${test#*long}\n, long string.\n$ echo ${test##*long}\nstring.\n$ echo ${test%long*}\nThis is a long, \n\n\n*Search and replace:\n${PARAMETER/PATTERN/STRING}: replace the first occurrence of PATTERN with STRING.\n${PARAMETER//PATTERN/STRING}: replace all the occurrences.\n${PARAMETER/PATTERN}: remove the first occurrence.\n${PARAMETER//PATTERN}: remove all.\n$ test=\"This is a long, long string.\"\n$ echo ${test/long/big}\nThis is a big, long string.\n$ echo ${test//long/big}\nThis is a big, big string.\n$ echo ${test//long}\nThis is a , string. \n\nSo, you could make a simple for loop and make changes progressively. For example:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor i in *; do\n    ext=\"${i##*.}\" # get extension\n    name=\"${i%% --*}\" # get original name\n    lname=\"${name,,}\" # lowercase\n    nsname=\"${lname// /_}\" # all spaces to underscore\n    mv \"$i\" \"$nsname.$ext\"\ndone\n\n\nA: You could also use the perl-based rename command: something like\nrename -- 's/(\\w+)\\s+(\\w+).*/$1_$2.mp4/' *.mp4\n\nwhich takes the first two \"words\" (sequences of word characters, separated by whitespace), discards the remainder of the name, and then outputs the words separated by an underscore followed by the .mp4 dot extension.\nIf you want to title-case the first word as indicated in your question, you could do that using \\u and \\L modifiers\nrename -- 's/(\\w+)\\s+(\\w+).*/\\u\\L$1_$2.mp4/' *.mp4\n\nTesting using the -n (no-op) and -v (verbose) switches with your sample filename\n$ rename -nv -- 's/(\\w+)\\s+(\\w+).*/\\u\\L$1_$2.mp4/' *.mp4\nNARUTO 50 — The Fifth Gate- A Splendid Ninja is Born_low.mp4 renamed as Naruto_50.mp4\n\nYou could get fancier - for example making it handle dot suffixes more generally rather than assuming they are all .mp4 - you may find this Regex Tutorial useful.\n\nA: I recommend you Thunar that comes with Thunar Bulk Rename\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*To install it, write and execute the command:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt install --no-install-recommends thunar\n\n\nIn your case this could be the way (It's in Spanish)\nFirst step:\n\nSecond step:\n\n", "Q: How to fix the issue with proprietary nvidia driver and plymouth on trusty 14.04?

I use openvpn, ssh tennels and socks proxies on linux to access uncensored internet.\nIs there a way I can share the uncensored internet over wifi so that other devices on my home network can access it? Foe example can I share my VPN connection over wifi?\nThere is an android softeware called Fqrouter2 that does the same thing. I wonder if that can be done in linux.\n\nA: If you can run the VPN client on the router (or the computer which acts as a router) then you can route all (or any selected) connections through the VPN. \nWith OpenVPN you can add \nredirect-gateway\n\nto the client configuration file to route all connections through the VPN, or \nroute destination.IP destination's.mask\n\nto route connections to a given destination. \nFor example, Ask Ubuntu uses CloudFlare and IPs in the 104.16.0.0 - 104.31.255.255 range so to route all connections to AskUbuntu.com through the VPN, you would add\nroute 104.16.0.0 255.255.0.0\n\nIf this provides insufficient granularity, you can also issue arbitrary commands with \nroute-up \"whatever command, for example /usr/sbin/ip route add ...\"\n\nwhich will be executed after the VPN connection is established. Make sure you set the appropriate script-security level. \nBefore that, you need to share the connection over wifi of course. \n", "Q: Problem while trying to create an alias Goodmorning\nI was trying to create an alias so as to launch matlab easier.\nI read this post :How to create a permanent \"alias\"? and I used the commands in this line \necho \"alias \"/home/user/matlab/bin/matlab='matlab'\" >> ~/.bash_aliases && source ~/.bash_aliases\n\nThen every time I tried to launch matlab I get the error  get the error \"Segmentation violation detected\".\nPlus, in the terminal I have the message \n\"bash: alias: « /home/vangel/matlab/bin/matlab » : nom d'alias non valable\".\n\nCould you help me find out what's happening?\n(I'm new to linux and I hope I described well my problem) \n\nA: you don't have to make an alias.

It allows you to remotely control the files on the sever via an OpenSSH client application.\n\nDNS Server:-\n\nIt is a server that points a domain name to an Ip address of a computer. Its like a phonebook which tells you the number (Ip Address) of a person when you search by his name ( In the below example, google.com).For example, when you open google.com in your browser a request is sent to Google's DNS servers which then connects you to one of their servers (For example:- 74.125.130.101). If their were no DNS servers, we would have to remember The Ip Address of askubuntu.com instead of typing in domain name.\n\nLAMP Server:-\n\nIt is a name given to a set of software usually required to run a website.\n  The software are Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP.\n\nMail Server:-\n\nAs the name suggests, it helps in transfer of email messages. It maps a email to an email address and domain. In short, its like a postman who delivers a letter to the right door.\n\nPostGreSQL Server:-\n\nIt is one of the types of SQL servers. They help in storing and managing data in a structured form for faster access. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.\n\nPrint Server:-\n\nAs the name suggests, it allows you to print your documents remotely through a Print Server connected to printer(s). Just like a mail server, it delivers a client's print request to the right printer.\n\nSamba File Server:-\n\nIt is just like OpenSSH for windows with an advantage over OpenSSH that Samba servers can be used as a print server without installing any other Print Server Application.\n\nTomcat J̶a̶v̶a̶  Server:-\n\nIts not Tomcat Java Server, Just Tomcat Server. Tomcat is a version of Apache. Its not a application server but a webserver used to serve websites.\n\nVirtual Machine Host:-\n\nIt is more like a Virtual Box for Ubuntu. It allows you to emulate a given hardware for testing without the presence of the hardware. It is commonly used to run various servers on a single Ubuntu install. You may need heavy hardware to run a VM Host.\n\nManual Package Selection:-\n\nAs I see, you are either installing a Ubuntu Server or reading a guide on how to do it. Manual Package Selection option in Ubuntu Server Installation allows you to manually select the packages that you need.\n\nI hope this helps !\n\nA: The term \"server\" means a piece of software that offers a service to clients. A server usually waits for a client to contact it, and then sends the reply to the client. For further information, read about the Client-Server-Model\n\nOpenSSH server\nSSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol to get encrypted remote access to a machine. The machine you want to access needs to run a SSH server to accept incoming requests. OpenSSH is an implementation of SSH. Next to shell access and file transfer (SFTP, SCP), SSH enables fancy things, such as starting an application on the server, but show the GUI on the client (X11 forwarding).\nDNS server\nThe Domain Name System, short DNS, resolves addresses, like askubuntu.com to IP addresses like 104.16.17.44, which makes the internet more usable to human beings. For DNS lookups, the clients, e.g. web browsers, send a request to a DNS server in order to retrieve the IP address of the required service.\nLAMP server\nLAMP = Linux Apache MySQL PHP, pretty much explains it: This package containes an Apache web server (a server that e.g. delivers websites), with a MySQL backend (A database management system), and a PHP interpreter (PHP is a scripting language that is executed on the server before sending the result to the client, in this setup through the Apache server).\nMail server\nA server that is responsible for delivering E-Mail, both for sending and receiving, depending on the setup.\nPostgreSQL server\nPostgreSQL is, like MySQL, a database management system. A database server enables clients to send queries to the server and returns the results.\nPrint server\nOn a default Desktop Ubuntu, there is a printing system called CUPS installed. CUPS works as a server, on which the printers are installed. Every time you print something on Ubuntu, it sends the print job to a print server, either on the same system, or to another. E.g. in my school, there is a central print server students send their print jobs to, and then the print server takes care of the printing.\nSamba file server\nSamba is an implementation of the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol, which can be used as a network file system. SMB clients can mount drives published by a SMB server.\nTomcat Java server\nTomcat is another web service, responsible for delivering JSP content, i.e. dynamic website generation.\nVirtual Machine host\nThis option installs KVM, a host for running virtual machines.\n\nManual package selection allows you to skip tasksel, the program that is offering you those precompiled package lists, and install the packages you need manually, which allows for a more fine-grained setup. However, this is much harder to accomplish, especially if you have no idea what packages are actually required to build, let's say, a web server.\n", "Q: \"Background\" tab missing in terminal profile settings I want to make my Terminal transparent. The setting need is in the profile settings dialog of the Terminal, in the \"Background\" tab.

My new company gave me a Dell Latitude E5440 laptop running Windows 7 64 bit. I am trying to install Ubuntu but neither 12.04 nor 14.04 boot.\nThe common Error that I take on the booting screen is:\ndmar: Failed to find handle for ACPI object \\_SB.PCIO.I2C0\ndmar: Failed to find handle for ACPI object \\_SB.PCIO.I2C1\ndmar: Failed to find handle for ACPI object \\_SB.PCIO.UA01\ndmar: Failed to find handle for ACPI object \\_SB.PCIO.SDHC\nmmc0: Unknown controller version (3). Yo may experience problems\n\n\nA: I had similar problems with installing Ubuntu on my new Lenovo W540 portable workstation (also a dual-boot setup). I tried installing 15.04, 14.04, and 14.04.2 -- both amd64 and x86 versions with to avail. While I've been using Ubuntu for about two years now I'm still rather n00b in the under-the-hood side and felt that I was not getting ahead with resolving my problem. Until I found this question, that is.\nWhat Mitch pointed to ended up solving my problem. Well, this problem anyways (more at the bottom about my new, possibly related issues). From the link he provided I found my way to Ubuntu Help's BootOptions page that detailed (clearly enough) how to set the acpi=off parameter when booting the liveCD.\nTo detail the steps that I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted with LiveCD on DVD. I had tried both DVD and USB before but used a DVD this time around as some have reported that they've been able to install from DVD when they've had problems with installing from or even launching the Live version from USB. I don't know if it mattered that I used DVD vs. USB, though.\n\n*Once the DVD kicked in I essentially followed the steps detailed starting at \"Ubuntu CD Advanced Welcome Page Options\" in the above-linked BootOptions page and set the parameter acpi=off as part of that (via pressing F6 in the Advanced options screen). FYI, I pressed the Esc key \"when the small logo appears at the bottom of your screen\". The instructions note that any key should work.\n\n*I chose to \"Try Ubuntu without installing\", going into the Live version and then\n\n*Installed Ubuntu from the live desktop (Install now, or what ever the icon is on the desktop there) as some have reported that they were able to install via the Live option when the direct installation didn't work. As with DVD vs. USB, I don't know if that mattered.\n\n\nThat's really it. The installation (with acpi=off) didn't run into any irregular issues of any kind. Now, I'm not sure but I think I chose to also install both updates and third-party applications in the installation options. Some have noted that not selecting these have helped in problematic installations. You might want to try without if you have issues.\nNow, I should add that while the first boot to Ubuntu after the installation was completely normal I ran into a halt on my second boot to Ubuntu after I had installed the first detected batch of updates (in my case about 180MB, IIRC). I can't remember for sure if the system stalled/froze when powering down or when powering up, unfortunately.\nAnyways, I was able to resolve that halt by adding the acpi=off kernel parameter in the Grub options as detailed (again, clearly enough) in the question that Mitch linked to above (in the Chosen Answer to the question answered by izx).\nI should finally add that while the installation seems to have gone through fine I did run into two new issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*I am now having persisent issues with the system not being able to power off or reboot (in Ubuntu, all ok in Windoze side). I have to brute-force with the power button. This might be also related to the acpi/APIC parameter per reading various people's problems with some kernel/hardware combinations and powerdown/reboot problems. The problems seems to have been around for years with varying combinations of kernel version(s) and hardware. (I don't have sufficient rights to post more links here but you can find these by searching with acpi / APIC / ubuntu power down, etc search terms). But so, just so you know that powerdown and reboot freezes might be next issue you may be facing, which are not show-stoppers, though, as you can still use the system -- just need to brute force power off from power button. \n\n*For some reason after the installation was done and I booted into my fresh Ubuntu (15.04) installation neither the keyboard nor the mousepad of my laptop work anymore. They work ok up until the Grub2 screen. After that, no more. In my case I'm able to use the computer normally with a wireless USB-dongle keyboard & mouse.\n\n\nI don't have a solution for neither one of the two new problems as is.\nI hope the installation solution that worked for me helps you too.\n", "Q: If I buy an Ubuntu tablet, will I be able to use it in the same way as an ubuntu PC?

Should the approach above fail to correct the problem (it is only known to work on some variations), you can try this next. If you are using Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (Precise Pangolin) or later:\nkillall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.config/pulse/* ; rm -r ~/.pulse*; ~/.config/pulse\n\nwait 10 seconds, then reboot (putting the machine to sleep is not enough -- fully power it off and then back on).

I do have CompizConfig > Cycle Through Multiple Sizes\nBut I want to assign a hotkey to make a window stick to the left, full height, 1/3rd width. The same for the right. and one for the middle. I'm used to using Windowpad (on windows) which allows me to define pretty much anything. And I'm so used to it.\nAny way to tweak this?\nClarify Edit.\nThis is not about opening windows but about the current active windows.\n\nA: Sounds like you're looking for xdotool or wmctrl. These are tools that let you script various interactions with the GUI. Both can be installed from the repositories, you can use whichever one you prefer:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool\n\nMy display is 1920 x 1080, so 1/3rd width would be 640. To place the active window at the left side of the screen, full height and 1/3rd width, I would run:\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,0,0,640,1080\n\nThe format is explained in man wmctrl:\n-r <WIN>\n     Specify a target window for an action.\n-e <MVARG>\n     Resize and move a window that has been specified with a -r action \n     according to the  <MVARG> argument.\n\n [...]\n\n<MVARG>\n     A move and resize argument has the format 'g,x,y,w,h'.  All five components  are  integers.\n     The  first  value, g, is the gravity of the window, with 0 being the\n     most common value (the default value for the window). [...]\n     The four remaining values are a standard geometry specification: x,y \n     is the position of the top  left  corner  of  the  window, and w,h\n     is the width and height of the window [...].\n\n<WIN>\n     This  argument  specifies a window that is the target of an action. [...]\n     The  window name string :ACTIVE: may be used to instruct wmctrl to \n     use the currently active window for the action.\n\nYou could also make it more dynamic by detecting the width automatically. This command prints the width of your display:\n$ xrandr | grep -Po 'current\\s*\\K\\d+'\n1920\n\nYou could, therefore, integrate it into wmctrl like this:\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,0,0,$(($(xrandr | grep -Po 'current\\s*\\K\\d+')/3)),1080\n\nNow, all you have to do is assign that command to a keyboard shortcut from the Unity Settings and you're all set.\n", "Q: I can't execute a binary file on ARM version of ubuntu!

Without a recompilation, that's not possible.\nOn the download page are no binaries for ARM.\nYou could use QEMU, a hosted virtual machine monitor to start x86 applications.\n\nA: You can't run this file, because it is for x86 cpu, not arm.\n", "Q: Add Spellcheck Dictionary to Abiword 3.0 I am working on Lubuntu 14.04 with Abiword 3.0.0 and with the pre-installed version only the spell-check for English came along. I can switch to other languages within the program, but then the spell-checking isn't working. \nI checked different forums, but didn't find a straightforward solution. I downloaded the ispell \"hash\" files (+encoding file) for French and German. But now I don't know where (in which folder location) to put them or how to use or properly install them. The location info from this help page doesn't seem to correspond anymore (http://www.abisource.com/help/en-US/info/infospelling.html) \nBut maybe that's also not the way to go and I can achieve spell-checking of these languages in a different way. How could this be solved?\n\nA: Testing with version 3.0.2 in 18.04.\nWithout having German or Italian support installed on my system I was able to switch to German and Italian, select them from the \"Set language\" setting (right-click outside text within document or under \"Tools\") and use spelling successfully. \n\n\nMake default, press Enter.\nIt seems the OP already did that but then the spelling didn't work. That may be true or may be an impression coming from the fact that the setting above is somewhat buggy and the selection is not followed as expected, or rather the selection is a bit difficult to make - I had to repeat a few times in order to get the correct selection. It seemed to me that the \"Make default\" option is not immediately followed, in which case I made sure that my text intended for correction was selected, and then right-clicked while it was selected, and then chose \"Set language\", with double-click on the language name. To see which corrector is selected for different parts of text, click text and look at right-bottom of the Abiword window.\n\nMaybe the 18.04 comes with installed aspell dictionaries that were lacking in previous ubuntu-s. And indeed, the instructions at the address linked in the question are partially outdated. There is no /usr/local/share/AbiSuite-2.0/dictionary/ in the 3.x version. There is /usr/share/abiword-3.0/ but without any dictionaries. I guess the 3.x program uses some dictionaries at system level, but I am not sure it's the aspell ones, because in Synaptic I only see aspell and aspell-en installed (While German and Italian spellcheck is working without having those language added to the system). \nIn order to install aspell dictionaries they should be available in Synaptic or similar tools. In order to install them manually, go here, download the archive, open a terminal within the resulting directory and run \n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nBut that's not what made it work for me.\n\nA: Open Language Support (in Menu -> Preferences), and install those languages you want to be available. The files you install that way will include dictionaries for spell checking.\n", "Q: How can I install Kubuntu on a Virtualbox with a dynamic hard drive?

The setup\nI'm trying to remap the CapsLock key to be Control when using my Model M keyboard (with trackpoint) with a PS2-to-USB adaptor.\nThe problem\nIf the now-remapped control key stays pressed for more than half a second or so, it stops modifying subsequent characters. That is, if I press control, press and release x, wait half a second, press and release c, I get control-x c instead of control-x control-c. You can imagine that this can be a problem for an emacs and bash user!\nThis problem does not manifest itself with regular USB keyboards, with built-in laptop keyboards, in Windows, or if I don't remap the capslock to control. \nI've used System Settings > Input Devices > Keyboard in Kubuntu to do the remapping, and I've also done straight xmodmap. Same behavior. Since setkeycodes has no effect on usb keyboards, I can't use that.\nWorkarounds I am not interested in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a Unicomp USB keyboard. While the buckling-spring mechanism is identical to IBM/Lexmark's, the quality of the trackpoint is inferior, making it practically unusable. The mouse keys are also unreliable. Pity, because that would have been the right solution. Plus they've changed the form factor to something ugly.\n\n*Use a non-buckling spring keyboard. Obviously not an option!\n\n*Not remap the keys. Against my religion.\n\n*Drop Linux and use Windows (where the problem does not exist). Also against my religion.\n\n*Drop Linux and use OSX. OSX has the same problem, plus it's against my religion.\n\n\nThe solution I am considering is building one of these and doing the remapping that way, but it's a bit extreme. I'd rather do it in software.\n\nA: This turned out to be a hardware problem. At some point noticed that a different PS2-USB adaptor did not have that problem, switched to that brand, and the problem solved itself. \nThe device that works well is made (repackaged, really) by Belkin, and identifies itself as \nID 0d3d:0001 Tangtop Technology Co., Ltd HID Keyboard\n\n(Yes, it only says \"keyboard\", but lsusb -v shows that it has both a keyboard and a mouse descriptor, obviously).\n\nA: You may be able to solve the problem by finding out the respective identities of the PS/2 -> USB adapter and the keyboard. \nTry the command\nlsusb\n\nFor me it showed, among other things, that there is a\nBus 001 Device 018: ID 04d9:1400 Holtek Semiconductor, Inc. PS/2 keyboard + mouse controller\n\nThe first part of the USB identity code (04d9) identifies the manufacturer, and the second the product.\nNow you can use that information to discover the identities of devices connected to that adapter by typing\nxinput list --long | grep 04d9\n\nWhat I got was\n↳ HID 04d9:1400                             id=9    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\n↳ HID 04d9:1400                             id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nI have no keyboard attached to the adapter, but there is my old trackball mouse, Logitech TrackMan Marble FX.\nSo I wanted to know more about the device identified above as id=9, and I used xinput command to get what I wanted:\nxinput list-props 9\n\nThe first line of the listing was\nDevice 'HID 04d9:1400':\n\nThe listing also shows the properties of the device, and I used those to build commands needed for modifying those properties. What I ended with was two commands:\nxinput set-int-prop \"pointer:HID 04d9:1400\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation Button\" 8 3\nxinput set-int-prop \"pointer:HID 04d9:1400\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation\" 8 1\n\nThe first line turns Button 3 of the TrackMan mouse into a Wheel emulation button. (Button 4 a.k.a. \"8\" does not seem to work at all). \"Pointer\" in the commands refers to the mouse and prevents confusing things with \"keyboard\" that could be attached to the same adapter (not in my system).\nSimilarly you could perhaps modify the properties of your keyboard with commands like\nxinput set-int-prop \"keyboard:HID (keyboard usb-identifier) (property to be set)\n\netc with other individual properties\n", "Q: Configuring Telegram on BQ Ubuntu Phone Before switching to the Ubuntu phone, I tested Telegram on my old Android phone.

(I'm using Telegram for Ubuntu v1.3.10 (102)). Should I delete (uninstall) Telegram from my old phone (is there somehow a connection via the cloud?) or is the option not available in Telegram for Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can definitely change your profile picture in Telegram on Ubuntu-touch.\nIn order to do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Telegram \n\n*Go into settings (upper right, last point in the\n    menu)\n\n*Upper right you see a picture icon > Clicking this you get\n    to choose the app you want to take your picture from\n\n\nThe notification signal you get for Telegram seems to be the same as you chose for your short messages, although it seems not to work for all available sounds (for Mallet it works for me).\n", "Q: Upgrade from 14.04 to 15.04 fails I recently got an XPS 13 DE that comes with Ubuntu 14.04 and kernel 3.13.

So there is no need for a separate cue file sheet.\nYou can use handbrake to rip your DVD. It supports chapters by default, and will generate them in your output file (mp4 or mkv) automatically. When you rip the DVD, you can edit the chapter names in the 'Chapters' tag.\nAny decent player should support chapters. In vlc to jump between chapters, use the Playback menu -> Chapters sub-menu.

WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly.

Replace /path/to/dir with the actual path.\n\n*glob.glob('*.dat') will find the files ending in .dat\n\n*ini_time variable will at first cut out the date-time from the original file name using re module and then sort out which entry represents what in the string that is taken out so that we can add the required time to this\n\n*fin_time will contain the resultant time i.e. ini_time plus 30 minutes\n\n*os.rename will rename the file accordingly.\nAlso note that, with successive file names (differed by 30 minutes) the renamed file will overwrite the next one, hence it it is better to add the seconds to the renamed file name so that it remains safe.

OP originally didn't provide full information about the naming format. This script adapts to what OP mentioned in the comments was the correct file naming.\n*Technical notes: *\nIn this script we separate filename into 6 separate fields using awk, with underscore as field delimiter. First two fields , $1 and $2 are considered static text string. Fields 3,4,5, and 6 are the timestamp at which OP's data was sampled, not the file's creation date on the filesystem. \nVariable COPYDIR holds name of new directory where files with updated timestamp will go. We create that directory in current working directory with mkdir $COPYDIR\nVariables TEXTSTRING and DATESTRING hold static text and timestamp respectivelly. In the sample output bellow I have used two different strings to prove that script will work regardless of what text the first two fields hold.\nNEWEPOCHTIME is variable that holds calculated new timestamp in unix epoch format. NEWDATE is variable that holds converted timestamp from unix epoch to YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format. NEWAPPEND is the actual timestamp that will be added to the file in OP's desired YYYY_MM_DD_HHMM format.\ncp $file \"$COPYDIR\"/\"%TEXTSTRING\"\"$NEWAPPEND\".dat copies the old file into \"converted_files\" directory ( instead of moving, to prevent data loss) with the updated datastamp.\nNotice, the script will work as long as the naming format is really followed, i.e., all the files are really have SomeText_123.Data_YYYY_MM_DD_HHMM.dat format.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n#\n# Author: Serg Kolo\n# Description: this script takes timestamp within the filename\n# (which may be different from file's actual creation date)\n# converts that date and time to unix's epoch time\n# adds 30 minutes to it and renames it\n\nCOPYDIR=\"converted_files\"\nmkdir $COPYDIR\n\nfor file in *.dat; do\n        TEXTSTRING=$(stat -c %n $file | awk -F'_' '{print $1\"_\"$2\"_\"}' )\n        DATESTRING=$( stat -c %n $file | awk -F'_' '{gsub(\".dat\",\"\");  print $3\"-\"$4\"-\"$5\" \"$6}' )\n        NEWEPOCHTIME=$( expr $( date --date=\"$DATESTRING\" +%s ) + 1800 )\n        NEWDATE=$(date --date=@\"$NEWEPOCHTIME\" +%F\"_\"%R)\n        NEWAPPEND=$(echo $NEWDATE | awk '{gsub(\"-\",\"_\");gsub(\":\",\"\");print}')\n        cp $file \"$COPYDIR\"/\"$TEXTSTRING\"\"$NEWAPPEND\".dat\ndone\n\nSCRIPT IN ACTION\nThe demonstration bellow is direct copy from my terminal. Notice that I've created original files with two different strings in the first two fields. So this script should work no matter what is in the beginning of the filename, as long as there are really only two strings separated by underscore\nThe script was named notes-conversion because I developed the script from the notes I took while working on this question. \nNotice that filenames which have HHMM part as 2345 (which is 15 minutes before midnight) get updated to 0015, and DD part is updated to next day. 24 hour format preserved. \nIn addition, because for loop only looks for .dat files, we avoid renaming other files or directories that may happen to be in the working directory, thus avoiding any potential data loss. In the example bellow, original directory holds 11 items, 3 of which are *.txt files for testing, so we only work with 8 .dat files. In the directory where updated files go, we see 8 files, all .dat and no other files. Data is safe, script does its job.\n[68 ]SERGIY@UBUNTU_[/home/xieerqi/testdir/conversion/convert2]\n***********************************************\n85 $ ls\nFileName_123.Dat_2015_05_31_1245.dat  Test.txt\nFileName_123.Dat_2015_05_31_2345.dat  YoloSwag_123.Dat_2015_05_31_1245.dat\nFileName_Foo.Bar_2015_05_31_1245.dat  YoloSwag_123.Dat_2015_05_31_2345.dat\nFileName_Foo.Bar_2015_05_31_2345.dat  YoloSwag_Foo.Bar_2015_05_31_1245.dat\nFile.txt                              YoloSwag_Foo.Bar_2015_05_31_2345.dat\nRandom.txt\n\n[68 ]SERGIY@UBUNTU_[/home/xieerqi/testdir/conversion/convert2]\n***********************************************\n86 $ ls | wc -l\n11\n\n[68 ]SERGIY@UBUNTU_[/home/xieerqi/testdir/conversion/convert2]\n***********************************************\n87 $ notes-conversion                                                                                \n\n[68 ]SERGIY@UBUNTU_[/home/xieerqi/testdir/conversion/convert2]\n***********************************************\n88 $ ls converted_files/; ls converted_files/ | wc -l                                                \nFileName_123.Dat_2015_05_31_1315.dat  YoloSwag_123.Dat_2015_05_31_1315.dat\nFileName_123.Dat_2015_06_01_0015.dat  YoloSwag_123.Dat_2015_06_01_0015.dat\nFileName_Foo.Bar_2015_05_31_1315.dat  YoloSwag_Foo.Bar_2015_05_31_1315.dat\nFileName_Foo.Bar_2015_06_01_0015.dat  YoloSwag_Foo.Bar_2015_06_01_0015.dat\n8\n\n[67 ]SERGIY@UBUNTU_[/home/xieerqi/testdir/conversion/convert2]\n***********************************************\n89 $ \n\nEXPLANATION (from original post)\n*) Today I've learned that Unix-Linux systems count time in Epoch time, or simply put seconds. \n*) the script takes each file name, extracts date, converts it to epoch , adds 1800 seconds (which is exactly 30 minutes), and saves the file with than new timestamp.\n*) This script addresses what OP wanted - change timestamp in filename, not update creation time of the file itself\nTools used:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu 15.04\n\n*GNU bash 4.3.30\n\n*GNU awk 4.1.1\n\n*date (GNU coreutils) 8.23\n\nA: You may use this code to do what you need assuming \n\n\n*\n\n*you should take backup and test the code first to see if it's suitable for your case \n\n*you are using 24H format\n\n*no files will be named after 23:29 (if you\nhave files after that time the code should be modified to change the date also )\n\n\nthe code is :\ncd /path/to/the/files\n\nfor i in `ls`; do MM=${i:(-6): -4}; HH=${i: -8 : -6 }; NAME=${i: 0 : -8 } ; if [ \"$MM\" -lt 30 ] ; then  NEWMM=$((10#$MM+30)); mv -f $i $NAME$HH$NEWMM.dat ; else NEWHH=$((10#$HH+1));NEWMM=$((10#$MM-30)) ; mv -f $i $NAME$NEWHH$NEWMM.dat ; fi ; done ;\n\nHow it works: \nThe code will check the minutes part in the file name  MM then if it's less than 30 it will add 30 to the MM if it equals 30 or more it will add 1 hour to the HH part in the name and deduct 30 minutes from the MM part of the name  \n", "Q: USB stick not usable after ISO boot burn I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and have made 2 ISO boot sticks, one for Mint 17.1 and the other for 14.04.

What can I do to get the permission?\nhttp://imgur.com/cRdMtn4\n\nA: Use sudo:\nsudo find / -name xorg.conf \n\nsudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user.\nFor more info:\nman sudo\n\n(you can quit with Q)\n\nA: You are getting all those \"permission denied\" messages because the directories are not readable by you and you are not running as root. xorg.conf would be in a readable/traversable directory anyway (/etc/X11), so if you didn't find it, it doesn't exist (but read on). If you don't want to see all the permission denied messages, just redirect stderr to /dev/null (2>/dev/null)\nModern Xorg servers do not really need an xorg.conf. If you must have one, run Xorg -configure (relevant man pages: Xorg(1) and xorg.conf(5)).\n\nA: \nYou are getting all those \"permission denied\" messages because the\ndirectories are not readable\n\nTry:\nsudo find -perm -a+r / -name xorg.conf\n\n-perm -a+r means that the current user (which is root once sudo is taken), its group and others must all have read permission\n\nA: Direct Answer: Use sudo to run with administrative privileges.  More precisely, as described in the man page: \"sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.\"\nsudo find / -name xorg.conf\n\nBest Answer: Use locate instead.\nlocate xorg.conf\n\nCool Answer: add 2>/dev/null at the end to discard error/warning messages.  -iname is cool because it makes the search case insensitive.\nfind / -iname xorg.conf 2>/dev/null\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Credit for the 2>/dev/null part: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/231626/145311\n\n*Basic Find command reference: http://www.binarytides.com/linux-find-command-examples/\n", "Q: Make htaccess file impossible to be modified I am running my wordpress website under Ubuntu server and the .htaccess file keeps changing every week.

But the problem is Ubuntu's bash ignores this file. As a result, it doesn't know that you already installed ruby and prompts you to install ruby!\nThe problem can be solved in two different way.\n\nSolution 1: Using ~/.bashrc file\nOpen your ~/.bashrc file and put these two lines (or last one) there.\n### Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*\n[[ -s \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && source \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\"\n\n\nSolution 2: Make the regular shell session as login shell\nOr you can turn on your virtual terminal's preference to consider the shell as Login Shell.

I keep reading that to merge two partitions, they must be adjacent.  But I haven't found any definition of the word \"adjacent\" in this context.  How do I tell whether two partitions are adjacent?\n\nA: First of all, you cannot merge partitions. You can delete one, and resize the other to use the now-free space additionally.\n\nIn this picture, the partitions hda1 and hda3 are adjacent, they could be \"merged\" by, e.g. backing up the data on hda3, deleting this partition, which would result in 7GiB of unallocated space between hda1 and the extended partition hda4 and the loss of all files in hda3. Now, one could resize hda1 to use this free space, too, and then put the files back on there.\nhda1 and hda4 are not adjacent, as there is a partition in between.\n\nA: \"Adjacent\" means \"right next to\", so, if your partitions (called A, B, C, and D for this explanation) are physically laid out on the disk like this:  \nAAAAAAABBBBBBBCCCCCCCDDDDDDD  \n\nthe, A and B are adjacent, B and C are adjacent, C and D are adjacent. No other pairs are adjacent. \"Only adjacent partitions can be merged\" makes sense when one considers how merging A and B happens, giving  \nAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCDDDDDDD   \n\nYou can tell by looking at gparted's display - if the partitions are next to each other, then they ARE adjacent.\n\nA: This image may make it a little clearer:\n\nPartitions are physically next to each other on a hard drive, like this:\n\nSo you can't just make green and purple into one partition. You first have to make them next to each other, then swap them. These are the steps the computer does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Red (free space)\n\n*Remove Green (free space)\n\n*Add Red (if wanted, at center)\n\n*Stretch purple (make the free space the same format, e.g. ext4)\n\n\nThe grey (unallocated) at the end of my image can't be part of /dev/sda1 because there is /dev/sda5 in the way.\n", "Q: Radeon Drivers R9 270X Ubuntu 14.04 Do I need drivers for my graphic card Radeon R9 270X? If yes how can I install them?\n\nA: Open the Software & Updates utility and open the Additional drivers tab.\nIf your graphics card is listed, like in the picture below, the proprietary drivers can be used, and you can install them from this screen with a single click, if you have Ubuntu already installed.\nThe installation will, however, not work on a live system, as video drivers are one of the few things which require a reboot. (And no, persistent pendrives don't work either, the installation will only work on a fully installed system.)\n\nIf the graphics card is not listed, then your graphics card is most likely not compatible with the proprietary AMD driver. If the default, open source driver works, stay with it.\n", "Q: How is it possible that I can execute JAR file from shell?

Are there other examples of this behavior? Can I create my own file type that can be executed only by its name/path?\n\nA: This is because ubuntu supports the binfmt_misc kernel module and the jar type is enabled. see /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/jar\nThis is very old (since kernel 1.03). See more information here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1667830/running-a-jar-file-without-directly-calling-java\nOther examples are python and wine, yes, if you learn how binfmt_misc works, you can create your own types too.\n", "Q: Apache broken after ubuntu upgrade I have 3 sites: two Joomla and one Squirrel Webmail. \nI recently updated Ubuntu from 12.04 to 14 and Apache broke.\nSite 1: 9.90.132.94\n\nWhen i browse to site 1 it says forbidden.\n\nSite 2: www.tczfans.info\n\nWhen i  browse to site 2 all i get is a directory listing.\n\nYou can see all my configuration files by browsing to http://www.tczfans.info.\nPlease help!\n\nA: Site 1: This site does not exist or the server does not respond.

With the SDL libraries for example, one would have to point to the headers at the beginning of their code, like so: \n#include <SDL/SDL.h> \n\nAnd, when compiling with GCC for example the library would then have to be included with:\ngcc project.cpp -o project -l/path/to/library/SDL\n\nSo, when you are developing a program with a specific library to include, where should the header files and the library be located so that GCC can recognize where to pull that information from? Do they have to be stored in the usr directory or can you tell GCC to point to whatever location you want? \nThis is specific to development on Ubuntu as that is the platform I am developing for but any *nix platform would likely be similar. \n\nA: The GCC compiler will look for headers depending on how you declare the header so there is two possibilities \nDeclaring the header using angled brackets <>\n#include <math.h>\n\nIn this case the compiler will search in the default system header locations in Ubuntu it is \n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/local/include\n\n*/usr/target/include\n\n*/usr/include\nSo if your needed library has its header file in one of those locations GCC should find it by default.\nDeclaring the header with \" \"\n#include \"myheader.h\"\n\nor\n#include \"myheaders/header.h\"\n\nIn this case the compiler will look in the same directory as your .c file is, unless you tell gcc to look somewhere else by using the -Idir option \nFurther information can be found in this article about Compiling, linking, Makefile, header files on gribblelab.org\n", "Q: Start the minecraft.jar demo I installed minecraft via PPA:\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:minecraft-installer-peeps/minecraft-installer\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install minecraft-installer\n\nAnd now I can start the login screen for the game on the console with\njava -jar /usr/share/minecraft/minecraft.jar\n\nand even copy the running game-screen with\ncp -a ~/.minecraft/ ~/mcraft\n\nwhich allows me to start it without internet connection:\njava -jar ~/mcraft/launcher.jar\n\nNow since I don't have an account, how can I start the demo?\n\nA: Simple as it is:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to create an account at https://minecraft.net/demo (You can use any fantasy email as it doesn't have to be valid for the demo to run once.)\n\n*Log in in your game-screen and press the DEMO Button\nThe game will download the rest it needs to run.\n", "Q: Boot problems after update After an update, I was asked to restart, and after the restart, I couldn't boot.

By default rkhunter will look for both programs, and execute each\n# of them as they are found. If the value of this option is '0', then both\n# programs will be executed if they are present. A value of '1' will disable\n# execution of the C 'unhide' program, and a value of '2' will disable the Ruby\n# 'unhide.rb' program. To disable both programs, then disable the\n# 'hidden_procs' test.\n#\n# The default value is '0'.\n#\n\nHe has obviously forgotten, and left it as 1 meaning that the unhide test is not run. So to enable it, just simply change the option to what it is meant to be as default, this being 0.\n", "Q: USB 3.0 port does not work on carbon x1 laptop I have carbon x1 second gen and the USB 3.0 port does not recognize any usb device.

I have researched online and have tried adding the Firefox security PPA as well and installed that but when I launch Firefox it is still the same old version that opens.\n\nA: I eventually tracked down the issue to a plugin I had installed a while back that allows you to modify the header information to look like your using a different OS and browser so the sites I visited were thinking I was on Windows and using an older version of Firefox.\n\nA: Firefox 38 is the latest version.

I also have a project in which I want to use that tool. I tried Googling it, but could not find a simple and detailed tutorial on how to get such a thing working on Ubuntu.\nI would also greatly appreciate it if I can be directed to a information page about Server Side JavaScript.\n\nA: \"Server-side JavaScript\" usually refers to Node.js (or the Node fork, io.js, which is being merged back into the Node project).\nWhat is Node.js?\nOn its own, Node is not a server. It also isn't a language. At its core, Node is just an environment in which you can run JavaScript code. They've taken Google's open source V8 JavaScript engine (which is used in Chrome) and separated it from the browser so you can run JavaScript outside of a web browser.\nNode comes bundled with some neat tools to help you interact with the filesystem and HTTP requests. There's also a huge repository of third-party modules available through npm.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*About Node.js\n\n*Node.js on Wikipedia\nSetting up Node.js on Ubuntu\nThere are several ways to get Node working on Ubuntu, each with pros and cons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install from the official repos\n\n\n*\n\n*How: sudo apt-get install nodejs\n\n*Pro: It's easy\n\n*Con: The package is always badly out-of-date\n\n*Con: Lots of scripts expect to find node in your path, but Ubuntu uses nodejs so you have to create aliases.\n\n*Con: You install with sudo which means that globally-installed third-party packages from npm also have to be installed with sudo. Sketchy.\n\n\n*Install via the NodeSource repository\n\n\n*\n\n*How: Follow these instructions\n\n*Pro: Your Node will be up-to-date\n\n*Pro: This is the semi-officially recommended method of installation\n\n*Con: You still have to use sudo to install other modules\n\n\n*Install via the Node Version Manager\n\n\n*\n\n*How: Follow these instructions\n\n*Pro: Installs in your home directory, so no weird permissions\n\n*Pro: Easy to keep node up-to-date, or even run multiple version of Node\n\n*Con: Node is tied to your user account, which isn't great if you're setting up a production server\n\n*Con: It's your responsibility to keep Node updated\n\n\n\nCreating a Server\nRemember that Node itself is not a web server, however it comes with lots of handy tools for building web servers. Without any additional packages, you can save this example server (taken from the Node.js About page) as server.js and run it from the command line with node server.js (or nodejs server.js, depending on how you installed Node).\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, res) {\n  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n  res.end('Hello World\\n');\n}).listen(1337, \"127.0.0.1\");\n\nconsole.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/');\n\nHowever, unless you were hoping to send plain-text responses, you'll probably want to look into a more robust solution such as Express.\nAny further training at this point really depends on what you want to do with Node (and things become much less Ubuntu-specific). NodeSchool has great tutorials on everything from the basics and managing packages to web servers and databases. \nAnd finally, a few popular packages to help you solve common problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*socket.io for handling real-time interactions with web sockets\n\n*Passport for authenticating users\n\n*Mongo for data storage in a document-oriented (NoSQL) database\n\n\nA: Here are some links you might want to take a look at.\n\nIMPORTANT\nRead this first if you want to follow these tutorials!\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need nodejs and npm\n\n*Do what this says.\n\n*Then run this: sudo npm install npm -g\n\nServer Side Javascript\n\n\n*\n\n*Node.js\n\n*Socket.io\n\n*Express\nTutorials\n\n\n*\n\n*Socket.io Chat Tutorial\n\n*Express Tutorial\n", "Q: Turning off desktop integration in firefox I used to be able to turn off the desktop integration in firefox by going to the general settings and unclicking the box that says \"Prompt integration options.\" But I just reinstalled 14.04 on a new laptop (T420) and the firefox settings have changed.

I am trying to troubleshoot why my cron task isn't working sometimes.  Where does cron store log files by default?  Is it /var/log/syslog ?\nI have looked at that file and it is empty.  Do I need to set something up?\n\nA: When cron doesn't work, it'll send out a mail to the user root. The only problem is: you don't have the software to send / store the mail in mailboxes.\nBut have no fear, Postfix is here!\nInstall Postfix\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install postfix heirloom-mailx\n\nWhen install postfix, it'll ask you how to you want to setup it up. On the first screen, select local only and proceed with the defaults for everything else.\nConfiguring Postfix\nNow, using your favorite editor, edit /etc/aliases. It'll look something like this in the beginning:\n\n# See man 5 aliases for format\npostmaster:    root\n\nWhat this means is that any mail sent to postnaster will now be sent to root as well. In this case, we want any mail sent to root (for the cron mails and any other system mail) to be sent to username (us).\nSo, edit /etc/aliases to look like:\n\n# See man 5 aliases for format\npostmaster:    root\nroot:          norman\n\n(Replace norman with your username obviously. Unless you have the same name/username as me. :) )\nAfter that's all said and done, run the following command to push the changes:\n\nsudo newaliases\n\nNow, after that run:\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix\n\nYou'll get the same screen you had before when installing postfix. Run through the defaults (Local Only, etc..). When you get to the part when it asks for the root and postmaster alias, just make sure it's the same as the one you added to /etc/aliases above. Then, continue running through the defaults.\nWhen you're done, run the following command to restart postfix and get underway!\n\nsudo service postfix restart\n\nConclusion\nNow, if cron has an error, it'll be mailed to you. But, you're probably wondering, how in the world do I check my (local) mail?\nTo do that, run the command:\n\nmail\n\nThat simple. If there's no mail it'll say No mail for <username>. Otherwise you'll get a neat terminal interface to use. See the man page for information on how to interact with your inbox.\nOr, if you prefer, you can access your local man page by using:\n\nman mail\n\nAnd now, you're done! :)\nP.S. You should read this to learn more about the cron issue.\n\nA: As default, cron's logs saved in /var/log/syslog.\nIt depends on rsyslogd configuration. You can change it:\nGo to rsyslog config\ncd /etc/rsyslog.d/\nsudo nano 50-default.conf\nUncoment line:\n#cron.*                         /var/log/cron.log\nSave file and restart rsyslog\nsudo service rsyslog restart \nRestart your cron daemon for get it's messages from new file\nsudo service cron restart\n\nA: When running mail I got the following response:\nThe program 'mail' is currently not installed. To run 'mail' please ask your administrator to install the package 'mailutils'\n\nInstead I found the errors / mails stored in /var/mail/root\n\nA: #to check all job run timeline\ncat /var/log/syslog | grep CRON\n\n#to check each job full log\ncd /var/mail/\n\nll\n-rw-rw----  1 ubuntu mail 9342 Dec 31 07:35 ubuntu\n\nless ubuntu\n\n#in the above file you can find the whole log\njust shift + g so you can see all new logs text\n#to check live file / log update\ntail -f /var/mail/ubuntu\n\n\nA: It is in /var/log/syslog by default.  \nBut it can be set up to create a separate cron.log, which is more useful.\nThis Q&A describes the process:\n16.04: How do I make cron create cron.log and monitor it in real time?\nAlso in this answer is the instructions to create a wcron command that displays it is near-real-time.

I was hoping maybe someone more experienced could help me figure this out.\nFirst of all, nm-connection-editor is broken. I have no idea how or why. When I try to add a wifi connection, many of the necessary fields are deactivated -- e.g., I cannot enter an SSID for a new connection, so wireless connection is hopeless.\nSecond, when I try to plug in via wire, I still don't get an Internet connection. When I open a browser, I get ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED. When I try to use \"ifup wlan0\", wlan0 is not found. When I try \"ifconfig up\", error fetching interface information: device not found.\nI have no clue how the wifi became nonfunctional, so I figured I might just try reinstalling XFCE -- BUT I can't even do THAT, because -- problem number three -- my BIOS appears to be totally inaccessible. I have tried both restarting and shutting down, and neither process gives me any opportunity to boot to the BIOS, even if I spam all the F-keys and Delete and Escape before the GRUB menu ever appears. There is no Lenovo splash screen of any kind during which it would ordinarily make sense to interject with F2 or F12 or Delete or whatever. Therefore, I can't even boot from USB.\nDoes anyone have any bright ideas for resolving this? I am open to anything -- even reinstalling the whole damn computer -- if I can just get it to work.\nI have flash drives through which I can get offline installers onto the Lenovo, if that helps.

I have an Ubuntu 14.04 LXD container on an Ubuntu 14.04 Server host (using lxd-git-master PPA). I want to prevent it from reaching any other containers or from communicating with the public Internet over any IP range except for a specific /32 block (that is, one IP). This IP is statically routed to my server in a datacenter and I need to be able to specify the IP, subnet, and default gateway.\nI read that LXD itself does not do networking, so what program/utility specifically is the easiest to install and configure in a direct way to explicitly configure this?\nP.S. I need it to be able to bind to all possible TCP and UDP ports on that IP address, and it would be ideal if the host would not try to bind to the IP when it starts up a process that binds on 0.0.0.0.\n\nA: You probably want to route that public IP to your container, so make sure the host itself doesn't have it in its network configuration, then do something like:\nip route add IP/32 via CONTAINER-IP dev lxcbr0\n\nYou may then add the public IP to the container's network config by adding this to its network config under the eth0 section:\npost-up ip addr add IP/32 dev eth0\n\nAt which point you should be able to ping the container using the public IP.\nYou'll want to make sure the host doesn't NAT traffic coming from that IP and as for restricting access to other resources from the container, you'd have to do that with iptables on the host. Note that one nice property of Linux bridges is that iptables does get called on intra-bridge traffic, so you can absolutely firewall the container from accessing any neighbor.\n", "Q: How do you install sauerbraten?

You can turn this option on by running\nsudo modprobe ath9k btcoex_enable=1\n\nTo make this option permanent you can do this:\necho \"options ath9k btcoex_enable=1\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf\n\nThis solution should work for Atheros AR3011 and AR3012 combo chips.

You can, however, increase this by adding a line to your ~/.bashrc file to set the HISTSIZE variable:\nHISTSIZE=<number of entries, -1 for unlimited>\n\nThis will not take effect immediately, but only to newly started sessions.

In the past, I've always used three ext4 partitions to fulfill my needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda2: /\n\n*/dev/sda3: /home\n\n*/dev/sda4: /mnt/Data\nRight now, I'm using Ubuntu 15.04 with the btrfs filesystem. After installing, I ended up with one big partition, containing the three partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda2: extended\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda5: /\n\n*/dev/sda6: /home\n\n*/dev/sda7: /mnt/Data\nWhen I browse through these partitions from a live USB, something strange happens: the root directory of each of these partitions is called @. I suspect that this has something to do with something called subvolumes in btrfs.\nI'd like to make good use of those subvolumes. For instance, I'm using a separate /home partition to make new installs easier. Is this still necessary? Or may I just as well put every partition in one big partition with different subvolumes to achieve the same thing?\n\nA: It will depend on exactly what you want to do with your disks, but in my case yes I moved to using btrfs and I have done exactly as you say - use subvolumes instead of partitions. \n\nFrom the btrfs wiki: \n\nA subvolume in btrfs is not the same as an LVM logical volume or a ZFS\n  subvolume. With LVM, a logical volume is a block device in its own\n  right (which could for example contain any other filesystem or\n  container like dm-crypt, MD RAID, etc.) - this is not the case with\n  btrfs.\nA btrfs subvolume is not a block device (and cannot be treated as one)\n  instead, a btrfs subvolume can be thought of as a POSIX file\n  namespace. This namespace can be accessed via the top-level subvolume\n  of the filesystem, or it can be mounted in its own right.\nSo, given a filesystem structure like this:\ntoplevel\n+-- dir_1           (normal directory)\n|   +-- file_2      (normal file)\n|   \\-- file_3      (normal file)\n\\-- subvol_a        (subvolume)\n    +-- subvol_b    (subvolume, nested below subvol_a)\n    |   \\-- file_4  (normal file)\n    \\-- file_5      (normal file)\n\nThe top-level subvolume (ID5) (which one can think of as the root of\n  the filesystem) can be mounted, and the full filesystem structure will\n  be seen at the mount point; alternatively any other subvolume can be\n  mounted (with the mount options subvol or subvolid, for example\n  subvol=subvol_a) and only anything below that subvolume (in the above\n  example the subvolume subvol_b, it's contents, and file file_4) will\n  be visible at the mount point.\nSubvolumes can be nested and each subvolume (except the top-level\n  subolume) has a parent subvolume. Mounting a subvolume also makes any\n  of its nested child subvolumes available at their respective location\n  relative to the mountpoint.\nA btrfs filesystem has a default subvolume, which is initially set to\n  be the top-level subvolume and which is mounted if no subvol or\n  subvolid option is specified.\nChanging the default subvolume with btrfs subvolume default will make\n  the top level of the filesystem inaccessible, except by use of the\n  subvol=/ or subvolid=5 mount options.\nSubvolumes can be moved around in the filesystem.\n\n\nMy understanding is that the Ubuntu installer (if you choose btrfs) will create @ and @home as subvolumes in your btrfs filesystem. It will then mount @ as the filesystem root, and @home in /home. \nThis then opens up more possibilities, one of which is snapshots. I use apt-btrfs-snapshot which manages creating a snapshot each time I do anything with apt, i.e. installing or removing packages. In this way I can revert all changes to the system if something goes wrong. I also have subvolumes for each of the users on my system, although this is almost definitely unnecessary. The point is that I no longer have separate root and home partitions, and don't waste space trying to allocate enough to each. \nI recently did a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.10 over the top of a 14.04 install which had btrfs for the main disk - and I was able to keep the @home subvolume intact while replacing the root @ directory with the new install just using the graphical installer. This was the main reason for using separate partitions, and it seems that recent Ubuntu versions support btrfs in the same way - so I would suggest that you no longer need partitions if you've configured btrfs. \n", "Q: Recursively rename files there is a whole bunch of files all of them who have the pattern\njoob_1_1\njoob_1_2\njoob_2_1\njoob_2_5\n\nso it is joob then underscore numeric underscore numeric - these are also the only files in the folder if that makes it easier. I want to rename them into\njob_1_1\njob_1_2\njob_2_1 ....\n\nthere has to be some way to do that automated ? It is just getting rid of that single letter \n\nA: Use rename :\nrename 's/^joob/job/' joob_*\n\nThis will change the file names starting with joob to job.\nTest :\n$ ls\njoob_1_1  joob_1_2  joob_2_1  joob_2_5\n\n$ rename 's/^joob/job/' joob_*\n\n$ ls\njob_1_1  job_1_2  job_2_1  job_2_5\n\n\nA: If you want to do it the gui way, here is an alternative to the very good suggestion of heemayl.

Then I read this answer and followed the ways mentioned in the answers with no luck!\nIsn't there any way to create shortcuts like Windows in Linux?\n\nA: Make sure the drive to which that link belongs (Other than linux partition) is mounted when you restart the PC or when you try to use that link. It mostly happens with window partitions, you are not able to access files from those partitions after system restart. You have to first manually mount them.\nInstall NTFS Configuration Tool and configure the drives which you want to mount on system restart and you will not face the problems of broken links again.\n", "Q: Run command at login - Ubuntu 15.04 This has been asked to death, and yet none of the solutions I've found seem to work.\nI want to run a command, say setxkbmap -layout us -option ctrl:nocaps\n, at login. It should only run for me, and not anybody who logs in.\n~/.profile doesn't work. ~/.xinitrc doesn't work. ~/.xsession doesn't work. ~/.config/autostart doesn't work.\nEdit: Ideally, the solution would also be backup-friendly. Config files are easy to copy, and that's one of the great things about Linux systems.\n\nA: Most certainly, ~/.config/autostart does work if the command works \"normally\", but you have to be aware of two possible bottlenecks:\n\n\n*\n\n*The launcher in ~/.config/autostart is a .desktop file. To run a complicated command from a .desktop file, use the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"setxkbmap -layout us -option ctrl:nocaps\"\n\n\n*Some commands break if they run while the desktop is not fully loaded yet.

I also use Android Studio and notice laggy performance. the \"top\" command shows the various tracker processes running at the top of the list. I see my load average reaching 6 or 7 and my memory use nearing 100%. This is with the default settings for tracker after exiting Android Studio. It is supposed to do its work without interfering with normal use, but that is not the case. I see other software failing (i.e., network apps timing out) due to the excessive load.

So what has happenend, is that I have a Ubuntu 14 server. I have my SSH key uploaded to the server, and a password. I only have one user; root. The problem is now, I formatted the computer on which I had the SSH key. Is it in any way possible to get access to the server, without losing any data?\n\nA: The SSH key uploaded to the remote server is the public key, which is one of two parts of the actual \"SSH Key\".  It is designed to be 'publicly' disclosed to remote servers, as you need the corresponding private key which is stored on your computer to work with the connection.  (An analogous example is PGP encryption which works in a similar way - the PGP public key can be used to encrypt data, but the PGP private key is needed to decrypt the information and use it.  In the same way, SSH needs you to have the private key that corresponds to the public key in order to do key-based authentication.)\nIf you formatted your system, lost your private key, and have written data to the disk since then, you likely cannot recover the SSH private key.\nCheck with the remote server provider, and see if they have a serial console to access the system.  If it's a VPS they probably have such a mechanism available through a control panel.  Create a new SSH key on your computer, upload the private key to the server through the serial console, remove the old private key, and then connect normally.\n\nA: If SSH on the server side allows key authentication only and the private key on the client (your) side it lost, you need to contact the system administrators, connect a monitor to the machine (depending on your possibilities to access the server).\nIf you get a password: prompt when you run ssh root@[ip], then you should try a password you might have set on the server.\n", "Q: MATLAB R2014a permission denied problem I have installed MATLAB R2014a on my PC.

This is because other packages also put their files in this folder. A package can not easily remove a folder that is not empty, that would leave an unstable or broken system.\nIt is also possible that you yourself have stored files in this folder. And it would certainly be annoying if those files were suddenly disappeared along with the folder.\nFurthermore, especially this folder is one of the default folders part of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

Every time I need to login to BOOT Manager to login to Ubuntu. Help me, TIA\n\nA: You wrote:\n\nRecently installed Ubuntu 14.04 along with windows 8.1 in my dell inspiron 15 5547 (Legacy Mode, windows 8.1 in uefi mode)\n\nYour parenthetical comment reveals the cause of the problem. Mixing BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and EFI/UEFI mode is a Bad Idea. On most computers, doing so makes it difficult to switch boot modes.\nFortunately, the solution is not too difficult: Install an EFI boot loader for Linux. Several are available (see the preceding link), but two are likely to be easiest to install and maintain:\n\n\n*\n\n*rEFInd -- Download and prepare a USB or CD-R image of my rEFInd and boot with it. It should detect both Windows and Ubuntu. Test booting both OSes. If both work, boot to Ubuntu and install the PPA or Debian package version of rEFInd. It will then take over as your default boot manager, and you'll be set.\n\n*EFI-mode GRUB -- GRUB is Ubuntu's default boot manager, but you've got the BIOS/CSM/legacy version installed. You must replace this with the EFI-mode version. This is most easily done by booting an emergency disc to EFI mode and running Boot Repair (in the boot-repair package, IIRC). The trick is booting to EFI mode. You may need to use rEFInd (as above), or you can disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support in your firmware and boot your Ubuntu installation disc to its \"try before installing\" mode, or you might be able to use your built-in boot manager to boot the installer to EFI mode.\n\n\nThe biggest problem you face is variability from one EFI to another. This variability means that there is no standardized way to get to the firmware's built-in boot manager, force an EFI-mode boot, and so on. There are also bugs that can interfere with one or both of these solutions. You'll just have to take these issues one at a time as you work toward a solution.\n", "Q: What can a Beowulf cluster help process? So, my school has hundreds of old computers and a few gigabit switches.

I am new to Ubuntu and I am really interested in making software that can work on it and I would like to make profit from these software.\nHow can I make money from making software for Ubuntu if the programs are open-source and free ?\n\nA: Ubuntu, being a free and open source OS, does not limit you to the usage of free (as in freedom, not as in free beer, to quote Richard Stallman) software only. If you take a look into the Ubuntu Software Center, you'll find a bunch of proprietary software, some of which you have to pay money for. Another example is Steam, which allows users to sell games for Linux.\nSo you can make and deploy proprietary and paid software for Linux. There is no contradiction in that.\nIf you want to make your software free as in freedom, you could charge for it too, but it wouldn't make the most sense, as anyone who has the software and its code may remove any copy protection and redistribute it legally. Another way would be to raise donations.\nThere are, however, some successful business models which are based on free software, but I can't think of any example where the customer pays for the software. Most of the times, you pay for exclusive support, such as in the example of Canonical, who offers paid support for business customers. Some companies may offer other services, but I think I've made my point.\n\nA: ask for donations.  You can even have a donate button built into the app.\nkick of the project with a fund raiser / kickstarter.\nYou can sell the binaries, Documentation, support contracts.\n\nA: The open source effort itself rarely makes much money.  Donations perhaps.  However, open source can be made to create an environment which is conducive to profit nearby.  Most \"for profit\" work with open source consists of trying to create a symbiotic relationship between your profit generating venture and the open source community.\nRed hat is an excelent example of this relationship.  They provide quite a lot of feedback to the Linux community, but their profits come from providing Linux related services to large corporations.\nOne can also look to the relationship between python and Guido von Rossum's employers\nDo make sure your heart is in the right place.  If you want to make open source software, and seek to earn a living at it, you will find opportunity everywhere.  If the wording is slightly different, and instead you seek to make profit, but want to use open source to do it, you will find more profitable approaches elsewhere.\n", "Q: Terminal: Avoid repeating directory multiples times to reach files within I have two files file1.txt , flie2.txt in a directory X.

Should I just merge all 3 devices into one BTRFS filesystem and not worry about filling up my SSD with media?  Is there a way to achieve my end goal using a different method than the one I'm currently using?\n\nA: Btrfs filesystems do not interact with each other, so you cannot mount the @media subvolume on /dev/sd{b,c}1 because the @media subvolume is currently on /dev/sda1, and you get a cross-device error when you try to snapshot /mnt/media to /mnt/media_snap because /mnt/media is on /dev/sd{b,c}1 whereas /mnt/media_snap is on /dev/sda1.\nInstead of having the @media subvolume on the /dev/sda1 btrfs filesystem, you want to create an @media subvolume on the btrfs filesystem on /dev/sd{b,c}1:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/media/\nsudo btrfs subvol create /mnt/media/@media\nsudo umount /mnt/media/\nsudo mount -o subvol=@media /dev/sdb1 /mnt/media/\n\nYou can create snapshots of /mnt/media/, but you can place the snapshot only on the /dev/sd{b,c}1 filesystem. So you can create a read-only snapshot like this:\nsudo btrfs subvol snap -r /mnt/media/ /mnt/media/<snapshot_name>\n\nBut I recommend placing each snapshot of a subvolume outside the subvolume itself, because this simplifies things when you need to revert to a snapshot. To do this, you will need to mount the root of the /dev/sd{b,c}1 filesystem:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/media_root/\nsudo mount -o subvol=/ /dev/sdb1 /mnt/media_root/\nsudo btrfs subvol snap -r /mnt/media_root/@media/ /mnt/media_root/<snapshot_name>\n\n", "Q: How can I make my shell prompt look like a cheeseburger?

Today I noticed that the line numbers in gedit would not show up. Could graphics drivers be causing this problem? can I roll back? How can I roll back. I've included an image that shows the problems.\n\nA: First off\nYes, your graphics card, could possibly be using a wrong or corrupted driver that makes it render some GUI elements incorrectly. It's recommended that you reinstall the drivers. You should have begun the post with your specs, but never mind. I guess you're using a Nvidia card. \nUninstalling\nThe first thing you need to do is to uninstall the driver you're currently using (if the re-installation didn't work). How to do that depends on the method you installed the driver. If you installed it using Nvidia's Unix/Linux GNU script provided on their website, then launch that script again with the :\n\n--uninstall\n\nflag to it, at the end. If you installed it using the ppa/terminal/deb file, type in this:\n\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n(For apt-fast users: sudo apt-fast purge nvidia*)\n\nIf you didn't install any drivers at all, Google how to disable nouveau driver.\nInstalling, well... Again\nNow you have to install the correct packages for the Nvidia card, that i assume, you're using. With the graphical glitches, you've been having, I suggest you to use the stable Nvidia drivers. \nI don't recommend any beta drivers.\nTo install the drivers type in:\n\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n(For apt-fast users: sudo apt-fast install nvidia-current)\n\nand the installation shall begin, if you don't have any repo-related problems.\nFinalizing\nWhen the drivers have finished installing (correct me if I'm wrong), all you have to do is reboot your system, and hope the glitches are gone. If everything is still like it was... The last thing I can suggest you is googling on \"How to reinstall the ubuntu-desktop package\". If that still doesn't help, well another theme or a full reinstall would be the only (non-elegant) solutions\nIf i helped, a vote up would be appreciated\nEDIT: Just read the comments, and noticed you're using Intel HD4000.

I have installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1, but have not been able to connect with wifi (it works fine when using Windows). Is there any way to download gedit from Windows, then install it on Ubuntu using a pendrive?\n\nA: Most software is available as a .deb package. You could download that, save it somewhere Ubuntu could find it, and use that to install the application. However, if there are any dependencies not already installed or included in the .deb, then you'll have trouble. \nA better plan is to fix the WiFi. You might need internet access to do that, but surely you can plug into Ethernet long enough to solve that problem.\n\nA: Gedit comes with Ubuntu out of the box. Just open a terminal with ctrl + shift + t and type Gedit \n", "Q: Booting to Ubuntu on dual boot (with Win 7) Desktop I am a novice in Ubuntu. I followed the instructions on installing Ubuntu given on the website  next to my Win 7 and created a USB bootable stick. During the installation, I will choose \"Install alongside with Win 7\" option, so it will create the necessary partition for Ubuntu. Before I start the installation, I'd like to know whether it is going to create the necessary boot setup, or I have do this in Ubuntu after the installation using GRUB? That is, after the installation, when I boot, will I be able to either choose to login to Windows or Ubuntu? \n\nA: With windows 7 installed first grub will detect windows for you and configure itself to Boot into windows. Problems only arise with Ubuntu installed first as windows boot loader overwrites grub and cannot detect the Ubuntu install. \n", "Q: Deleted Swap, now boot takes forever Running Ubuntu 15.04.  I was receiving messages about my root / partition running out of space, and so I looked up how to allocate more space to it.  I followed the answer to this question: How to extend my root (/) partition?\nAfter turning swapoff, deleting the swap parition, and hitting Apply all operations, I executed the command sudo resize2fs /dev/sda10 (in my case, I used sda8, as it is my root partition) and it said: The filesystem is already 2441472 (4k) blocks long.  Nothing to do!\n.  I restarted the machine, and once it reached the Ubuntu screen with the loading dots it stayed there for about 2 minutes before proceeding to the login screen.  \nI figured I messed something up with the boot process, so I thought I'd recreate the swap space.  I opened up GParted and created a new parition in the unallocated space, allocated it as swap, hit swapon, Apply all operations, and restarted.  Same thing happens.  Every time I restart or do a fresh boot, it hangs on the loading screen for a good 2-3 minutes and then proceeds to the login screen.\nI don't see why deleting the swap partition would have messed with the boot, as I understand it is only really used for hibernation.\n\nA: If you want to remove the swap partition, you should first try by commenting its entry in /etc/fstab, then reboot.\nAs for the long boot time, it may be that one of your filesystems has been damaged. As soon as your system is up, run the appropriate fsck.* command for each of the file systems. If it reports errors, it will usually recommend how to fix them.\n(Btw, running a system without swap is perfectly normal. I'm doing this since several years – these days, common machines have enough RAM.)\n\nA: From Terminal run\n    sudo blkid\n\nThen \n    cat /etc/fstab\n\nDouble check that the fstab entry for swap partition matches all entries in the blkid\nYour fstab entry should look something like this=>\n    UUID=your/UUID/here none      swap    sw        0       0\n\nIf they don't match with each other, change UUID in fstab using your preferred text editor, to match the one you get from command sudo blkid.  Then reboot and you'll see the effect.\n\nA: I had about the same problem. When I removed my swap partition, the system kept booting very slowly. Although my situation was different from that of the OP, I hope it will be useful to others. I'm adding it here because this was my first hit when searching for solutions.\nFor me commenting out the relevant line in /etc/fstab as indicated by other answers did not yet solve it. It turned out that I had an encrypted swap partition enabled, which may be the default if your home directory is encrypted.\nLook at /etc/crypttab, and comment out any lines referring to a partition that no longer exists. For me, removing this line reduced the boot time from ~3 minutes to the usual < 1. \n\nA: You may also need to edit the /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume file and comment out any references to the deleted Swap partition\nsudo nano /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume\n\n#RESUME=UUID=2854a8db-6494-44ac-9cee-974714bb0b00\n\nAfterwards, run update-initramfs -u (thanks @Stefan)\nI commented out the swap entries in /etc/fstab and the slow boot wasn't resolved. I also made sure that my swap wasn't encrypted, since no /etc/crypttab existed as suggested by @ankit7540. In the end, i came across this error message while installing a virtualization package and this gave me the right direction\nW: initramfs-tools configuration sets RESUME=UUID=2854a8db-6494-44ac-9cee-974714bb0b00\nW: but no matching swap device is available.\n\nFrom the docs:\n\nThe initramfs is an cpio archive. At boot time, the kernel unpacks that archive into ram, mounts and uses it as initial root file system. From there on the mounting of the real root file system occurs in user space.\n\nresume\n      The resume hook tries to autodetect the resume partition and uses  the  first  swap\n      partition   as  valid  guess.  It  is  possible  to  set  the  RESUME  variable  in\n      /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume.  The boot variable noresume overrides it.\n\nIn simpler words, since a swap partition is a requirement for hibernation in Ubuntu, it makes sense that it'll be defined in some boot config as the RESUME parition and the boot process will look for it.\n\nA: Had the same problem: userspace booted for 3 minutes. Before it i have deleted swap partition on another disk. Once I commented related line in /etc/fstab and rebooted, linux booted in 48 seconds\n", "Q: How to allow a process to use more memory I am trying to run a game on Steam at a decent speed. I exceed the system requirements for this game, and the game is already set to minimum graphics, but it is still running slow.\nI have been using free and sysinfo to monitor memory usage and when playing a game I still have over 60% free memory. What I want is to be able to use that memory to run the game.\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you!\n\nA: What I will suggest here is, try killing the other unnecessary processes when you run the game. Then there would be more memory available for all the remaining processes, and therefore the performance will increase. In fact it should increase then.\n\nA: You cannot just tell an application to use more memory; it will only request and use as much memory as it has been programmed to do so.  If the application itself doesn't let you increase the memory in its own configuration then there is no way to force it to do so.\n", "Q: \"error while loading shared libraries\" when running executable file I tried to execute a file and I got an error:\n\n./Tracking: error while loading shared libraries: libboost_system.so.1.49.0:\n cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: The error you see indicates that one of the programs \"shared libraries\" (which provide functions that your program needs) is not available.\nIn this case, the actual shared library that is missing is called libboost_system.so. If we search the apt repositories for something with a similar name, we get the following packages:\n$ apt-cache search libboost system\n[...]\nlibboost-system-dev - Operating system (e.g. diagnostics support) library (default version)\nlibboost-system1.54-dev - Operating system (e.g. diagnostics support) library\nlibboost-system1.54.0 - Operating system (e.g. diagnostics support) library\nlibboost1.54-dev - Boost C++ Libraries development files\n[...]\n\nSo, you should be able to fix this by installing that libboost-system package:\nsudo apt-get install libboost-system1.54.0\n\nThe actual version number may change, depending on the version of Ubuntu that you're running.\nNote that the actual library that your program requested was libboost_system.so.1.49.0, which doesn't match the version available in Ubuntu. So, you may need to get a different build of that program, which uses the Ubuntu version of that library.\nYou may see further missing library messages after installing that package; if that's the case, repeat the process with the new library name.\n", "Q: rsync over ssh \"error in protocol data stream\" (code 12). ssh works I tried:\nrsync -v -v -e 'ssh -p YY' ./testfile me@XXXXX:/home\n\nError Message\nopening connection using: ssh -p YY -l me 146.6.84.206 rsync ->-server -vvve.s . /home \n[sender] make_file(testfile,*,0)\nsend_file_list done\nsend_files starting\nserver_recv(2) starting pid=17537\nrsync: connection unexpectedly closed (9 bytes received so far) [sender]\nrsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(600)[sender=3.0.6]\n_exit_cleanup(code=12, file=io.c, line=600): about to call exit(12)\n\nThis works fine:\nssh -p YY me@XXXXX\n\nWhich suggests to me the problem is neither that sshd is not running nor that port YY is firewalled. I have checked anyway.\nWhat other problems could there be?\nEDIT:\nThe problem seems to have been \"self resolving.\" I could not replicate the following day. I started my local computer up. Perhaps notably I had a different IP address than last time. And now rsync magically works. I'd appreciate guesses as to what it could have been in light of it going away.\n\nA: Does your login script at the remote end produce garbage on stdout?\nCheck this with\nssh -p YY me@XXXXX /bin/true > out.txt\n\nIf out.txt contains data, identify the offending statements in your .profile or .bashrc and wrap them in\nif [ ! -t 1 ]; then\n  echo garbage\nfi\n\n\nA: I got this error when rsync wasn't installed on the target host. The error message in my case also said rsync: command not found. A simple\nsudo apt-get install rsync\n\non the target host solved the problem.\n\nA: This error can also happen if the path to rsync at the remote system is not what the local system assumes it to be.  You can see what is happening by specifying -vv (or even more vs).  If this is the problem you can specify the remote path to rsync with the  --rsync-path option.\n\nA: You may need to put in the full path to the ssh binary, ie\nrsync -v -v -e '/usr/bin/ssh -p YY' ./testfile me@XXXXX:/home\n\nThough there are other possible causes.\n\nA: I hit this error because I was rsyncing to a drive that was full! Check your disk usage if the other solutions here don't help you resolve this.\n\nA: I happened to run into this error for a specific file's transfer because a previously aborted rsync run seems to have corrupted the destination file (maybe due to interrupted delta/incremental changes on the destination file).\nMy solution was to find out which file caused the error (by using -v and/or --progress), deleting that file in the destination, then running rsync normally again.\n\nA: You can also get this error if you specify a remote path that doesn't exist.\nI got this error on OS X:\n$ rsync -avz public/ static:apps/myapp.com\nbuilding file list ... done\nrsync: connection unexpectedly closed (8 bytes received so far) [sender]\nrsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/rsync/rsync-47/rsync/io.c(453) [sender=2.6.9]\n\nTurned it was simply a matter of mistyping the destination path. The apps dir didn't exist. When I changed that to static:sites/myapp.com instead (the sites dir did exist), the error went away.\nIt's fine if the final directory in the path doesn't exist (I could do static:sites/mynewapp.com) but it appears any preceding directory must already exist.\n\nA: I was seeing this error:\nrsync -e 'ssh -v'\n\ndebug1: Exit status 11\n\n...\nrsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /BuildRoot\n/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/rsync/rsync-51/rsync/io.c(453)\n[sender=2.6.9]\n\nI was able to ssh into the remote host and found that it was out of disk space.\n\nA: I got this error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) for a pair of rsync's with different versions. So please check the rsync versions on both client and server.\nIn my case, local rsync was version 2.6.9 (on Mac OSX), while remote one was version 3 (can't remember now the exact version). Once I upgraded my local rsync to version 3 (using brew), the problem was fixed.\n", "Q: Cannot find /bin directory in Android Studio working directory I am new to Ubuntu and have installed Android Studio in my system.

I would rather have another browser try the Seamonkey suite. It has a browser (firefox), email client (thunderbird) and IRC client. \nI recently saw a Windows XP computer and it was very slow. I uninstalled Chrome and suddenly it became very fast. The problem with Chrome is that it runs multiple processes rather than process threads. Some of these process are always calling home all the time.\nWith a memory-limited computer like that you need a more lightweight browser.\n\nA: Firefox might work a little bit better than Chrome. If that doesn't work, try QupZilla web browser from the default Ubuntu repositories. QupZilla is  lightweight, very fast and feature-rich, like a scaled-down version of Firefox. You can import your bookmarks from other web browsers into QupZilla.\nQupZilla has renamed itself as Falkon and be installed by the following command in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu:\nsudo snap install falkon  \n\n", "Q: How are process id PID assigned on Ubuntu?

If doing updates is safe and secure, why does it need my password?\nFrom what I have read so far, it prevents man-in-the-middle attacks also. So what vulnerabilities exists that a user should be aware of?\n\nA: In my experience, most updates don't ask for a password. The system is able to update the necessary files without extra permissions.\nWhen it does ask for your password, it's to send to sudo, which lets you run a command with root permissions. There are some files that can't be modified except with root permissions, such as the kernel. When one of these has an update, you need to authenticate to allow the system to update those files.\n", "Q: How can I fix my pycharm installation?

Rather than going through the hassle of creating the .desktop file yourself, once you load the program you can go to Tools > Create Desktop Entry.

The MaaS vm itself is able to detect the server automatically, and once the dell server boots using PXE, the installation of Ubuntu (my target OS) begins as you would normally expect. However, after a few minutes (during Ubuntu's installation), the server shuts down (I'm assuming this is part of the provisioning process?) and then MaaS fails to power it back up. As such, Ubuntu fails to get installed and provisioning comes to a halt.\nThe dell servers use IPMI 2.0 as a management interface, and the configuration is correctly captured by MaaS (as far as I can tell). The official docs state that power-on issues might be caused by desynchronization of system clocks but this is something that I already checked. As such, I'm currently unsure about how to approach this issue, but I'll be appreciative if anyone can shed some light on what could be causing MaaS to be unable to properly power-on/off the connected servers.\nThanks!\n\nA: I had to turn on IPMI in the Network settings on the iDRAC for this to work:\niDRAC -> iDRAC Settings -> Network/Security -> Network -> IPMI Settings\n[x]Enable IPMI Over LAN\n\n\nA: I'm in the same situation.

If using an iDRAC, virtual media must be set to auto-attached, otherwise the OS provisioning process will fail.\n\nThis is because this option seems disabled without the license, and I'm trying to get by without purchasing an iDRAC license.\nHas anyone else on this thread been able to commission an iDRAC enabled server without a license?\n", "Q: Permissions when installing brackets.io I recently installed the brackets editor and was wondering what the best approach to handling the file permissions is.\nI tend to edit php/html files that are located in my /var/www/html\nand I'm running into permission problems when I'm not running brackets with sudo\nI wondered if there is a better approach to this?\n\nA: this actually answered my question just fine, the most upvoted answer is perfect:\nHow to avoid using sudo when working in /var/www?\n", "Q: How to run Redshift, and Redshift Plasmoid in Ubuntu 12.04?

Additionally, certain commands such as time and strace write output to stderr by default, and may or may not provide a method of redirection specific to that command\nBasic theory behind redirection is that a process spawned by shell (assuming it is an external command and not shell built-in) is created via fork() and execve() syscalls, and before that happens another syscall dup2() performs necessary redirects before execve() happens. In that sense, redirections are inherited from the parent shell.  The m&>n and m>n.txt inform the shell on how to perform open() and dup2() syscall (see also How input redirection works, What is the difference between redirection and pipe, and What does & exactly mean in output redirection )\nShell redirections\nMost typical, is via 2> in Bourne-like shells, such as dash (which is symlinked to /bin/sh) and bash; first is the default and POSIX-compliant shell and the other is what most users use for interactive session. They differ in syntax and features, but luckily for us error stream redirection works the same (except the &> non standard one). In case of csh and its derivatives, the stderr redirection doesn't quite work there.\nLet's come back to 2> part. Two key things to notice: > means redirection operator, where we open a file and 2 integer stands for stderr file descriptor; in fact this is exactly how POSIX standard for shell language defines redirection in section 2.7:\n[n]redir-op word\n\nFor simple > redirection, the 1 integer is implied for stdout, i.e. echo Hello World > /dev/null is just the same as echo Hello World 1>/dev/null. Note, that the integer or redirection operator cannot be quoted, otherwise shell doesn't recognize them as such, and instead treats as literal string of text. As for spacing, it's important that integer is right next to redirection operator, but file can either be next to redirection operator or not, i.e. command 2>/dev/null and command 2> /dev/null will work just fine. \nThe somewhat simplified syntax for typical command in shell would be\n command [arg1] [arg2]  2> /dev/null\n\nThe  trick here is that redirection can appear anywhere. That is  both 2> command [arg1] and command 2> [arg1] are valid. Note that for bash shell, there  there exists &> way to redirect both stdout and stderr streams at the same time, but again - it's bash specific and if you're striving for portability of scripts, it may not work. See also Ubuntu Wiki and What is the difference between &> and 2>&1.\nNote: The > redirection operator truncates a file and overwrites it, if the file exists. The 2>> may be used for appending stderr to file. \nIf you may notice, > is meant for one single command. For scripts, we can redirect stderr stream of the whole script from outside as in myscript.sh 2> /dev/null or we can make use of exec built-in. The exec built-in has the power to rewire the stream for the whole shell session, so to speak, whether interactively or via script. Something like \n#!/bin/sh\nexec 2> ./my_log_file.txt\nstat /etc/non_existing_file\n\nIn this example, the log file should show stat: cannot stat '/etc/non_existing_file': No such file or directory. \nYet another way is via functions. As kopciuszek noted in his answer, we can write function declaration with already attached redirection, that is \nsome_function(){\n    command1\n    command2\n} 2> my_log_file.txt\n\nCommands writing to stderr exclusively\nCommands such as time and strace write their output to stderr by default. In case of time command, the only viable alternative is to redirect output of whole command , that is\ntime echo foo 2>&1 > file.txt\n\nalternatively, synchronous list or subshell could be redirected if you want to separate the output ( as shown in related post ):\n{ time sleep 1 2> sleep.stderr ; } 2> time.txt\n\nOther commands, such as strace or dialog provide means to redirect stderr. strace has -o <filename.txt> option which allows specifying filename where output should be written. There is also an option for writing a textfile for each subprocess that strace sees. The dialog command writes the text user interface to stdout but output to stderr, so in order to save its output to variable ( because var=$(...) and pipelines only receives stderr ) we need to swap the file descriptors\nresult=$(dialog --inputbox test 0 0 2>&1 1>/dev/tty);\n\nbut additionally, there is --output-fd flag, which we also can utilize. There's also the method of named pipes. I recommend reading the linked post about the dialog command for thorough description of what's happening.\n\nA: There are two main output streams in Linux (and other OSs), standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr). Error messages, like the ones you show, are printed to standard error. The classic redirection operator (command > file) only redirects standard output, so standard error is still shown on the terminal. To redirect stderr as well, you have a few choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Redirect stdout to one file and stderr to another file:\ncommand > out 2>error\n\n\n*Redirect stdout to a file (>out), and then redirect stderr to stdout (2>&1):\ncommand >out 2>&1\n\n\n*Redirect both to a file (this isn't supported by all shells, bash and zsh support it, for example, but sh and ksh do not):\ncommand &> out\n\nFor more information on the various control and redirection operators, see here.\n", "Q: Change Aquaris phone ringtone I tried adding more ringtones by following instructions here and on other fora, but when I typed: sudo mount -o remount,rw / in the terminal, I got the following message: only root can usr \"- - options\" option\nI have already saved the audio files in .ogg format (in my downloads folder on the phone), but moving them to the ringtones folder is proving to be an impossible feat.

These experiences are developed using Ubuntu Scopes, a new UI toolkit available through the Ubuntu SDK.\nScopes are a complete reinvention of the content and services experience. Users have a new way to access content and apps without having to download individual apps – and developers have the opportunity to be discovered via the device’s categorized home screens. There are two types of scopes:\nAggregation Scopes – these define the device’s default experience by bringing together content and services from multiple sources and delivering them as a unified experience. For example, the video scope will display multiple video sources, and similarly a music scope can display music related content from a variety of providers. Each source can expand into an app-like, fully branded experience (branded scopes).\nBranded Scopes – app-like experiences delivered directly to the screen. This is the fastest path to develop a rich mobile experience on Ubuntu, with higher discoverability and easier to develop and maintain than traditional apps. By attributing categories (music, news, videos, etc) to your branded Scopes, users can discover them from both the default aggregation Scopes and the Store. They can become integral to the device’s default experience once a user favorites your branded scope.\nIt’s a world away from traditional smartphones and the app icon grid, and brings a great opportunity for developers to shine.\nSource\n", "Q: swap option missing while installing in ubuntu server 14.04 lts There is no option to select swap partition while installing the server version....I have tried all the possible ways to check the option and not found anything.

I use Terminal a lot, and sometimes I am running commands, which aren't things I don't want others to see, but more commands that if I accidentally arrowed up to and accidentally executed would cause a lot of trouble.\nSo I am wondering if there is, or I can make, some sort of Terminal 'incognito mode' which would allow me to, upon the execution of a certain command, stop recording my history, and then only start recording after I either execute a start recording history again command and exit 'incognito mode', or I simply restart the Terminal?\nBecause I find myself later on going and removing stuff from my .bash_history, when it would be much easier if I could have stopped it recording there in the first place, or at least got it to try to record it somewhere where it just wouldn't be allowed to, and would just end up not recording it.\n\nA: You could also make .bash_history read-only. I would empty the file first and then do:\n chattr +i .bash_history\n\n\nA: You could execute the sensitive commands in a screen session, then destroy the session when you are done.\nAlternately, you could keep that screen session alive but detached, and only access it when you actually want to be able to up arrow to the otherwise dangerous commands.\n\nA: You can simply delete the history of one particular terminal session by adding command history -cw after working.\nDo not close the terminal before giving this command. \n\nA: shopt -uo history should do it best.\nNuking the HISTFILE (et al) variables won't stop your Up history being logged, it just won't push it to disk. This may or may not be a positive thing for you, but given you mention it, I guess you want something better. Changing the shopt history setting stops the whole history mechanism from triggering.\nYou can turn logging back on with shopt -so history (the -s and -u are set and unset respectively).\nNote that the command itself will probably be logged so prepend it with a space to stop it being added to the history before you clear the variable.\n\nA: Run a command without putting it in history:\nSimply put a space before the command. Bash will ignore commands with a prepended space:\nExample: Spaceecho \"Some secret text\"\nNote: This only works if the HISTCONTROL variable is set to ignorespace or ignoreboth.\n\nDisable history temporarily:\n\n*\n\n*Run Spaceset +o history or Spaceshopt -uo history to disable history.\n\n*Run set -o history or shopt -so history to enable it again.\n\n\nDisable history for the current session (won't remember any commands from the session):\nunset HISTFILE\n\nNote: You'll be able to see the commands pressing Up until you close the terminal.\n\nRemove a command from the history:\nRun Spacehistory | grep \"part of your secret command\"\nIt will show a list of previously ran commands, in this format:\nuser@host:~$  history | grep pkill\n  302  pkill $$\n  467  pkill gone-cal\n  468  pkill actionaz\n  500  pkill chrome\n  550  pkill super\n\nSelect the entry number at the left of the command.

If you walk back through history (e.g. with Up or Ctrl+P) and change a line without executing it, only the modified version of the line will be saved. You can modify it in any way you like; good choices would include using Ctrl+U to totally blank the line or using Esc# to put a # comment character at the beginning.\nTo leave behind a line without executing it, remember not to hit Return (Enter). What I do is return to the newest line in history via Esc>.\n(Instead of Esc followed by >, in most terminals you can hold Alt and press >; the same goes for the Esc# suggestion above.)\nNote: You can’t permanently modify entries from previous sessions this way. Those changes will not be applied to the HISTFILE at the end of the session.\n\nA: Personally I use mksh, and this shell by default has no history file. That means you could launch alternative shell such as mksh or dash (which comes by default by the way) to run the command you don't want users to see, and exit once done. bash history will only record that you launched alternative shell and that's it.\n\nA: You can also use terminal multiplexer such as tmux, screen.

But doing this seems to make runit think that my service has ended and runs /etc/service/myApp/run again, and again, and again...\nI have also tried running this not as a daemon and it works fine running in the foreground, but then I still have an issue. I have a clean-shutdown command to send to my server at some point which will eventually shut down the foreground process and I do not want it to restart. But to my dismay, /etc/service/myApp/run gets called immediately to restart my server :(\nI am no sys admin so most of this side of things is new to me. All I want is my script to run on boot and not auto-restart. Thanks for your help.\nEDIT: I updated my question to include the fact that runit is being used here. I see that runit monitors processes to keep services up. My question still remains though.\n\nA: Don't use forever.\nIt's dead easy.  As you've already observed, forever is unnecessary here as runit already is a service manager, and is already starting and restarting your program.\nAs you've also already observed, there are a few rules for what run programs must do.  They must not fork and exit the main program.  The runit service manager, like most daemontools-family service managers (there being a whole family of softwares that all work like this), expects that the process running the run program is the dæmon.  Not its parent.  Not a brief fly-by-night that forks and exits.  But the actual dæmon itself.\na simple run program\nThere are various scripting languages that make writing such run programs a doddle.  Laurent Bercot's execline is one.  My nosh program is another.  Presuming that bin/www is the actual executable program for your dæmon, a nosh run script would look something like:#!/bin/nosh\nfdmove -c 2 1\nchdir /src\nbin/www\nAn execline script is similarly brief.  But the shell script isn't that much longer.  If your run program is a shell script, the thing to remember is to overlay the shell program with your dæmon program in the same process.  The shell command for doing this is exec and a shell script thus looks something like:#!/bin/sh -e\nexec 2>&1\ncd /src\nexec bin/www\nI strongly recommend that, if your program does not require superuser privileges, you execute it via the chpst program (and its -u option), so that it starts as a non-privileged user — for best results, one that is dedicated to this service.\nSeveral people have collected and published suites of run programs, over the years, and most of the run programs are that short and simple.  Since you have runit, you can start with Gerrit Pape's own collection of run programs.\nstarting and stopping dæmons\nWhen it comes to starting and stopping the service, again most daemontools-family service managers need to be told to stop auto-restarting the service.  They all come with a tool to do this.  You just need to use it in your clean-shutdown script.\n\n\n*\n\n*runit has the sv program: sv down /etc/service/MyApp\n\n*s6 has the s6-svc program: s6-svc -d /etc/service/MyApp\n\n*perp has the perpctl program: perpctl d /etc/service/MyApp\n\n*daemontools has the svc program: svc -d /etc/service/MyApp\n\n*daemontools-encore has the svc program: svc -d /etc/service/MyApp\n\n*nosh has the service-control program: service-control --down /etc/service/MyApp which is also aliased as svc: svc -d /etc/service/MyApp\nI said that it was a family of toolsets.  In fact, under the covers all of these tools are speaking mostly the same protocol.  \nThis brings me to a larger point.  All of these toolsets are not exclusive.  Just because you have runit, that doesn't stop you from using execline if you want to.  Or you can run a nosh script under s6's service manager.\nlogging\nYou've tried to write log files with forever.  Again, don't use forever.  This isn't the right way to go about logging with runit.  Redirecting standard output and error directly to files makes your logs impossible to rotate, size-cap, and otherwise control without drastic interference in your dæmon's operation.\ndaemontools-family service managers all do logging by having the output of one main service connected, through an ordinary pipe, to the input of another log service.  This pipe is set up by the service manager.  You don't do it yourself.\nThe log service is another service.  It runs one of the many available tools that simply read from their standard input and write to a strictly size-capped, automatically cycled, on-demand rotateable, set of log files in a log directory.\nThese programs are multilog,multilog, s6-log, tinylog, cyclog, and svlogd which latter is the one that you'll find that comes in the toolkit with runit.\nIn fact, you might find that whoever set up /etc/service/MyApp has already set up a log service in /etc/service/MyApp/log .  If not, a log service script is dead simple:#!/bin/sh -e\nexec chpst -uMyApp-log svlogd -t ./main\nJust create a user account named MyApp-log, mkdir /etc/service/MyApp/log/main, chown MyApp-log /etc/service/MyApp/log/main and you are away.  (Note that main can be a symbolic link to somewhere else where you make the directory instead.  You don't have to put logs under /etc with runit.  I put my log directories under /var/log/sv.)\nYou do nothing at all to your main service to cycle and size-cap logs.  The cycling and size-capping happens independently, in the log service process.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Jonathan de Boyne Pollard (2001).  \"Don't fork() in order to 'put the dæmon into the background'.\".

Problem is, even though I set up my router appropriately, I can only ssh into it when I am in my apartment's network (not my own personal one).  They have their own network with their own set of IP addresses.  This is problematic. I was wondering if anyone knows a solution?  I have considered VPN but it would seem that even with a vpn, I would still have to go through their own network which idk if it would work.  Is there a way to vpn onto their network and then ssh into my machine via my own network?  Or an alternative?\nThanks for your time\n\nA: Without knowing much about your aprtment's Internet Service Provider (ISP), as well as how your apartment's network (AN) is managed, it is hard to give a solution. \nDynamic Vs Static IP addresses\nThree levels of difficulties\nFirst: IP address assigned by ISP For most home users ISPs provide a single dynamic IP address. This means the IP address can change anytime at the whim and fancy of the ISP. You need to find out the IP address assigned to your AN by the ISP. You can type \"What is my IP\" in Google search and get the IP address assigned to your apartment's network. However, this does not tell you if this is static (it never changes) or dynamic (it can change anytime). Let's say this address is www.xxx.yyy.zzz.\nSecond: IP address assigned by Apartment's Network: Your apartment's network may again assign IP addresses to each apartment statically or dynamically. If apartment network admin uses dynamic IP address allocation. STOP HERE! There is no way to reliably ssh to your home computer from outside.\nIf your apartment's network admin uses static IP address allocation, there may be still hope. I will assume this is the case for the rest of the answer. Let's say your apartment's network has permanently assigned the IP address 10.0.0.25 to your apartment. You can find this from the WAN setting part of your own router.\nThird: IP address assigned by your own router This you can control. Make sure that your router assigns the same (a static) IP address to the computer you want to ssh to. Let's say this address is 192.168.1.101. This is just an example. There is no need to change your IP address to this specific one. You can find this from your computer's Network Manager's connection information.\nPort forwarding through two routers\nYou already know that ssh uses port 22. However, since your apartment's network admin works remotely, she may be using that port to ssh into local server/router. In any case, the same port cannot be used to connect to more than one apartment. So, if 22 is used by some other resident or is simply blocked, you have to use another port. Choose a different port in the 50000+ range. Say 50005.\nSet up your computer's ssh server to listen to 50005 rather than 22. Set up your ssh client to use this port as well.\nNow, ask your apartment network's admin to forward the port 50005 to your apartment's IP address, 10.0.0.25.  \nSetup your own router to forward the port 50005 to your computer's IP address, 192.168.0.101.\nNow you should be able to ssh from outside your apartment's network. Remember to use the external ISP's assigned IP www.xxx.yyy.zzz and the port 50005 (or whatever you choose) when ssh from outside.\nIf www.xxx.yyy.zzz is dynamically assigned, you may use a DDNS service to link that IP address to a host name.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Network manager core dump 15.04 I am trying to get someone to respond to this question:\nUbuntu 15.04 reboots by itself\nBut in the meantime I get this on Uuntu 15.04\nnm-applet\n(nm-applet:4109): nm-applet-WARNING **: Cannot grab information for modem at /org/freedesktop/ModemManager1/Modem/0: No ModemManager support\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nA: \nIt seems I was able to solve the problem.

Now run the command as (make the script executable):\nsudo /path/to/script.sh\n\nNote that the gnome-screensaver-command -a command will also run as root, if you don't want that you need to grant the permission for passwordless sudo shutdown command for the user:\nfoo spamegg = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown\n\n\n*The second problem is due to the fact that in your current script the gnome-screensaver-command -a will only run after the completion of shutdown command. As the shutdown command will actually be executed after 30 minutes, hence its in a blocking state. To solve this you can put the shutdown command in the background :\nshutdown -h +30 &\ngnome-screensaver-command -a\n\nIn a nutshell, you can make the script as following :\n#!/bin/bash\nshutdown -h +30 &\ngnome-screensaver-command -a\n\nRun it as :\nsudo /path/to/script.sh\n\nBefore using sudo, store the script in a secure place, it must only be accessible to you and you must be sure of the contents of the script.\n\nA: When you have two commands on two separate lines of a shell script, the second will only run when the first has finished. To avoid this, you need to add a & to the end of the first command to have it run in the background:\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo shutdown -h +30 &\ngnome-screensaver-command -a\n\nAs for not asking for the password, you'll need to tell sudo that your user has the right to run /sbin/shutdown with no password. Run sudo visudo and add this line to /etc/sudoers:\neka  ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/shutdown\n\nChange eka to whatever your username is. Save the file and you will now be able to run sudo shutdown without being prompted for a password.\n", "Q: How can I delay sound in the system?

Once it is exhausted, will the system begin to swap on regular swap partitions (if present)?\nWhat are the main disadvantages of zram?\nNote: I have 32gb of physical memory and 20Gb of swap partition. I use very memory-hungry programs, and often I run out of memory (top command shows both physical and swap almost full, and system slows a lot).\nThanks.\n\nA: zram creates a virtual block device of a size you specify by writing ( for example \"512m\" ) to /sys/block/zramX/disksize ( where X is the 0 based number of the zram device in question, so 0 for the first one ).\nYou can then format it for swap with mkswap /dev/zram0 and enable swapping on it with swapon /dev/zram0. Data written to it will be compressed and stored in RAM. The compressed data itself can not be swapped out. Note that not all data is compressible.\nWhich swap device is used up first is up to their priority, which you can specify with the -p xx argument to swapon.  A swap with higher priority will be filled before a lower one so it is a good idea to give zwap a high priority so it will be used up before falling back to a disk swap.\n", "Q: How to create a SFTP (SSH) User with extremely limited permissions i run a server on Ubuntu Server 14.04.\nI want to create a user that is able to connect via sftp, download 1 file and terminate the connection.\nThe user should not be able to do ANYTHING else.\nBrowsing system files or settings nor command line entries, nothing.\nLog in, download the file, gg.\nWhen the file is updated, log in download it, gg.\nThe file is in the same directory every time and has the same name every time but is updated.\nEDIT:\nI'm trying to implement your solution but i've found some problems: On the config file of the ssh on my configuration there is a line with \"allow groups sshdusers\".

The nouveau one sometimes worked but has frequently been faulty. \nI installed nvidia-346 (via xorg ppa instructions I found), which is working but is also faulty; it doesn't recognise my external monitor so I have to use laptop screen. Also my external speakers weren't recognised initially (no sound unless I disconnect them), but are now going again, and the splash screen script is very large. \nWhen I choose XP it starts loading and then after a bit goes to a black screen, without the desktop ever appearing. I have no idea how to fix that.\n\nA: From the looks of your paste, it seems like there shouldn't be any issue booting Windows XP. Nevertheless, a sudo update-grub may help out.\nAs far as the blank/frozen screen at the login, this seems like a graphics/driver issue. Apparently, Noveau (the open source Nvidia driver) doesn't work well with your card. So, the proprietary drivers may be needed. \nBy going to Geforce.com, you can determine the specific proprietary driver version for your card by doing a search for your card. In your case, the correct driver is the 304 series. This can be installed from the repositories via the command: sudo apt-get install nvidia-304.\nAfter this has been done, reboot the computer and you should have a fully functioning display.\nIn the comments of your question, it appears that you're still having issues setting the \"primary\" monitor that displays the window manager (i.e. Unity, Gnome Shell, etc.) If I understand correctly, you want to use your external monitor as the primary display so that it shows the Unity launcher, Gnome Shell Activities bar, etc.\nLuckily, I have a little bit of experience with this and I remember most of it! First though, let me explain the issue that I had.\nI would leave my HDMI cable plugged into my laptop. If I started up my laptop with the HDMI cable plugged in, X would always place my external monitor to the right of my laptop's LVDS monitor. This is not what I wanted since my external monitor was physically to the left of my laptop and lead to some confusion. No matter how I configured the monitor in the Gnome Display or Nvidia configurations, it would always default to this behavior if I entered the login screen with the HDMI cabled plugged in. It seemed that the Gnome/Nvidia settings would only apply if the cable were plugged in after X started.\nHowever, I found that if I left the HDMI cable unplugged until I got past the login screen, that my settings from nvidia-settings/GNOME would be applied correctly. At least, I think this was the case (it's been quite a while, honestly). However, I do remember setting something up for OpenBox specifically. In the file ~/.config/openbox/autostart I added the following lines:\nxrandr --output HDMI-0 --left-of LVDS-0\nxrandr --output HDMI-0 --primary #Make sure the desktop is on the HDMI monitor\n\nEssentially, what this does is force my configuration no matter how it was originally loaded. In order to find your specific monitor names, use the command xrandr -q.

It would popup by pressing some keyboard shortcut. Specifically, from what I remember, he was using Lubuntu, and mostly opening apps (like Chrome, Audacious, etc.).\nIs it a known extension for lxde or did he most probably create it by himself?\nThanks everyone!\nEDIT: some guys recommended Alt + F2, but nothing happens.\n\nA: This type of GUI for running commands is basically known as \"Run\" interface. It's fairly simple idea.\nIn the Ubuntu's Unity environment Alt+F2 allows running specific commands using the default shell, dash or Debian Amquist Shell. Of course, you have to remember that you are running commands \"blindly\", meaning without the STDOUT output from command or STDERR streams going. So unless you are running a GUI app, you won't know if your command failed or not.\nThere are tweaks for Gnome desktop environment to utilise the same keybinding as well, which if I am not mistaken , can be configured using from Gnome Tweak Tool\nFor blackbox desktop environment there exists bbrun package, which also does very much the same functionality. \nAt the very bottom of things, one could build such tool by themselves, using any programming language available or desired. For instance, here's some examples\nShell script +  zenity\n#!/bin/sh\nexec $(zenity --entry --title \"Enter command\" --text \"\") \n\nJava:\n//runSomething.java\nimport javax.swing.JOptionPane;\nimport java.lang.Runtime;\nimport java.io.IOException;\npublic class runSomething\n{\n public static void main(String [] args) throws IOException\n {\n  String cmd = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(\"Enter command:\");\n  Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd); \n }\n}\n\n\nA: Alt + F2 worked for me (i know you suggested it didn't work for you, however its worth reinforcing for others!).\nKubuntu 15.04\n\nA: I think you're talking about a shell script, which has extensive help available on the internet. I'll get you started, though.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new text file.

I have a Dell Inspiron 3542 laptop (Pentium 3558U, 4 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD, Intel HD Graphics, Bluetooth 4.0) and Linux Ubuntu 15.04 x64 (stable) freshly installed and updated. My main issue is that my separate Logitech Z600 Bluetooth Speakers, which I use because my laptop's built-in ones are awful, cause the Wi-Fi to stop every time I play audio (in YouTube f.e.). The Internet comes back again a bit after the speakers have stopped playing.

I installed Ubuntu 15.04 a few minutes ago with it plugged in the whole time, but I still think it's not being recognized since I'm having the exact same problems I used to have with my laptop's built-in Bluetooth adapter which I believe a person told me was on one chip with the Wi-Fi.

It takes full backup in a month period. Is there a possibility to change frequency of full backups? I want to setup duplicity to create only seven incremental backup and next it will be full backup. Where I can change it?\n\nA: Yeay! I found it! :D First install dconf-editor:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\nSecond run dconf-editor. In path /org/gnome/deja-dup/ is a key full-backup-period.

You can force it to do full backup after a particular time using the --full-if-older-than <time> parameter. So,\n\nduplicity --full-if-older-than 1M /some/dir sftp://uid@other.host/some_dir\n\nwill do a full backup every month.

This is simply how Advanced Format disks are most often implemented. Some external disks use the same (4096-byte) sector size for both physical and logical sectors, and I've heard that some high-end internal disks now do the same, but most disks these days are Advanced Format models with 512-byte logical sectors and 4096-byte physical sectors. There's nothing you can (or should try to) do about this.\nThat said, properly aligning partitions for Advanced Format disks is important. I ran some tests on Advanced Format disks to determine what happens when their partitions are misaligned and published the results here. In brief, the extent of the problem varies greatly from one filesystem to another and from one disk to another, but there's almost always a significant (and sometimes huge) performance penalty associated with misaligned partitions.\nYour /dev/sda4, however, does not directly hold a filesystem; it's an extended partition, which means that it is simply a container for other partitions. The data directly associated with /dev/sda4 is simply two (logical) sectors, which are probably not even adjacent to one another, so they can't be properly aligned. Real performance penalties would come from alignment of the partitions contained within /dev/sda4. In your case, /dev/sda4 holds /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6, both of which are properly aligned. Thus, you don't need to worry about /dev/sda5. The warning you're seeing is simply code that's being over-enthusiastic about reporting a \"problem\" when one doesn't exist.\nYour /dev/sda1, on the other hand, is not properly aligned -- it begins on sector 63, which is not divisible by 8. Whether you should do anything about that depends on how much you use that partition, how you use it (file size, reads vs. writes, etc.), how important it is that you get optimum performance from it, whether you've got adequate backups, etc. I recommend you read the article I referenced earlier, then decide whether to fix the problem. (I didn't report FAT results in that article for space reasons, but FAT performance suffered pretty badly -- IIRC, not as badly as ReiserFS, but at least as badly as most other Linux-native filesystems.)\nIf you decide you want to fix /dev/sda1, you should begin by backing it up. With that done, one way to fix it is to delete it, create a new partition in its place, and restore its files. Another way (after backing up) is to resize the partition in GParted. Make a tiny change to the start point; any recent version of GParted should round to a multiple of 2048 sectors, and you'll be fine. Moving the start point of a partition is always riskier and takes longer than moving the end point. As the partition is only 19GiB in size, the operation shouldn't take a ridiculous amount of time, even moving the start point, but it won't be instantaneous.\nAs a side note and background, only fairly old tools misalign partitions on modern Advanced Format disks. My guess is you used such a tool (an old version of Linux's fdisk or a DOS FDISK, perhaps) to create /dev/sda1, then used a more modern tool (a more recent fdisk, parted, or GParted, perhaps) to create the rest of your partitions.\n", "Q: Suddenly can't run sudo I didn't do anything on the computer except Internet for a few days and suddenly when I tried to do:\n$ sudo apt-get update \n\nI got:\nsudo: effective uid is not 0, is /usr/bin/sudo on a file system with the 'nosuid' option set\n      or an NFS file system without root privileges?\n\nI have no idea what happened, last time I remember running sudo is when I did update.\n\nA: sudo works with a mechanism that is called setuid (Set User ID, or also called suid). If that bit is set on an executable file (like sudo), then the application is executed under the permissions of the user, who is the owner of that file (in case of sudo, the owner is the root user).\nThat means, sudo is executed as root. So far so good. But, now nothing prevents you from inserting an USB-drive with a shell on it, that has the setuid bit set. You have full root access! That's why normally USB-drives are mounted with the mount option noexec, to prevent executing binary/scripts on such a device. Another mount option, if you still want to execute files, is the one that is mentioned in the error message in your question: nosuid.\nSee that excerpt of the mount manual page:\n\n[...]\nnosuid     Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect.\n[...]\n\n\nWith the mount command, you can determine, if your root filesystem is mounted with that option. Just type:\n$ mount\n\nYou can now remount the filesystem on-the-fly and change mount options:\n$ mount -n -o remount,suid /\n\nThat sets the suid option, which is the exact opposite of nosuid.\n\nA: Not really 100% related, but hear me out:\nI had this problem, because I had changed the default Docker installation. And docker service wanted to execute sudo or do similar things (system calls?)\nMore specifically, I had moved the filesystem location where Docker installs volumes and images.\nDocker Virtual machines  can take a substantial amount of disk space.\nTherefore I had moved /var/lib/docker to  /mnt/virtualmachines_ssd/docker.\nAfter a while I had forgotten that. I had to find out where /var/lib/docker was symlinked to.\nls -l /var/lib/docker\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  /var/lib/docker -> /mnt/virtualmachines_ssd/docker\n\nIndeed /mnt/virtualmachines_ssd/ was a different partition, a different filesystem.\nmount | grep virtualmachines | grep sdd\n/dev/sdd1 on /mnt/virtualmachines_ssd type ext4 (rw,nodev,nosuid,relatime,x-gvfs-show)\n\nThus,\nsudo mount -o remount,suid /mnt/virtualbox_ssd\nsolved the problem!

Because you aren't able to use the sudo command, you'll have to escalate to a root command line with su.\n$ su\nPassword:\n#\n\nThen\n# apt reinstall sudo\n\nNo reboot necessary.

This folder was found to contain around 350 GB and was unusable(no read/write permission) for the user.\nWhen I investigated more, It was found that the ownership of that folder was neither  root nor user (May be system admins did it by mistake during installation).

Is it possible to pipe or xargs a search result from find into the type command in Linux?\nFor example:\nfind . -name anacron | type\n\nor\nfind . -name anacron | xargs type\n\n\nA: type is not a normal command. It's a shell buitin. See:\n$ type type\ntype is a shell builtin\n\nSo, you need to invoke bash with -c to achieve what you want\n$ find . -name anacron | xargs -I '{}'  bash -c \"type {}\"\n\nOr even simpler (no need for xargs):\n$ find . -name anacron -exec bash -c \"type {}\"  \\;\n\nIt will call bash -c \"type ./file\", with every file that is found by find. -I in xargs means, we define here a placeholder {} to use later. This placeholder is replaced with the filename found.\nWhy shell builtins don't work with xargs:\n\n[...] Builtin commands are contained within the shell itself. When the name\n  of a builtin command is used as the first word of a simple command,\n  the shell executes the command directly, without invoking another\n  program. [...]\n\n\n\nxargs reads items from the standard input, [...], and executes the\n  command\n\nThe command in this case is a simple excutable, and a shell builtin is not an executable. It cannot be found in the filesystem. It's within the shell itself. So you have to call the shell and tell the called shell to invoke the builtin command. That's what happend with bash -c \"command\".\n\nA: There are a few problems here (some already highlighted):\n\n\n*\n\n*type is a builtin. It's not a command that's resolved, it's a function inside bash. See man bash-builtins. It only works in the context of bash so not an xargs or -exec forked subshell.\n\n*type is used to doing its own path searching. If you give it a path (as find is wont to do), it'll probably just return that path. readlink -f might be better if you're just trying to resolve symlinks; and you can pipe into xargs readlink or -exec readlink -f {} + all day long.\n\n\nThat's not to say you can't do what you're trying to. There are two options. The type command can handle many names at once so you could just provide it all the names at once:\ntype $(find /usr/sbin -name anacron)\n\nFor many commands, if there are too many arguments you'll exceed the command line length limit (see getconf ARG_MAX).  However, that won't apply in this case since type is built into the shell and doesn't generate a new process ID (the length limit applies to the exec() function used by the child process in a normal command line).\n", "Q: How to show all files created on a specific date?

Suggestions? Also, how do I move from one OS to the other with both installed?  Thanks\n\nA: I have no idea as to your skill level with Ubuntu, but since you've asked a relatively basic question, I'm going to assume you're a beginner. Sorry if that's an incorrect assumption. With that in mind, I would like to recommend going with 14.04 LTS instead of 15.04 since issues dealing with installation, setup, and general use are better-documented for that version. You may have a better time with it.\nInstalling Ubuntu alongside Windows or any other operating system is commonly called \"dual-booting\" and is handled by the Ubuntu installation process. When you actually boot the computer after Ubuntu has been installed, you will be given the option to boot to any of the operating systems detected on your drive. Here is a good overview of the installation process: http://news.softpedia.com/news/Installing-Ubuntu-15-04-479239.shtml (Google is your friend here.)\nThe basic steps are common to just about any Ubuntu installation. There are, however, a few tips that I'd like to offer from my experience:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make your own partitions. When you get to the step where Ubuntu asks you about partitioning and dealing with other OSes, consider making your own partitions manually. This has the advantage of showing you exactly what you're going to get instead of relying on the installer to figure out what's what. It will also prove easier to re-install Ubuntu if you break the OS without losing your personal data. (This is unlikely to happen, but I've done it before, and knowing my partition setup helped me fix it.) Here's a guide that I've used in the past: How to use manual partitioning during installation?\n\n*Back things up. If you're unfamiliar with the partitioning process, you could destroy some or all of the data on your drive(s), and that can be anything from discouraging to disasterous. If you can, back up either your whole drive or as much of it as you can.\n\n*Search before you ask. Even though 15.04 is new, there are a lot of concepts that are common to all versions, so give Google a try before asking questions. Don't be afraid to ask, of course, but do your research.\n\n\nNow let's talk about drive space. I'm not really clear on what you mean by not having \"enough space\", since that can mean that either your Windows partition is taking up the whole drive or you simply have too much data on the drive already. In the latter case, you'll just have to shuffle stuff off of the disk (either by deleting or moving to another place) until you've got enough room. In the former, bear in mind that you can make your Windows partition smaller as a part of the installation process, or even from within Windows. This will leave unallocated space on your drive for Ubuntu. Poke around on your drive and see what you might be able to live without.\nI hope you found this to be helpful.\n\n\n*\n\n*Scrat9518\n\n\nA: Please share more details on the setup you have. You could get Ubuntu Installed with as little as 6 GB on your Drive. With Both Windows XP and Ubuntu Installed side by side.\nYou could then mount the Windows Partition in UBuntu and copy your valuable Data. later you could get rid of Windows Completely.\nHowever if you share more details, we can get to a better solution quickly.\n", "Q: Touchscreen problem - Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in Dell inspiron 13 serie 7000 (7348) I recently purchased a Dell Inspiron 13 7000 Series 2-in-1 (7348). I would like to install Ubuntu, though still not officially released a version pre-installed on this machine.\nWhich version of Ubuntu would guarantee the Touchscreen and its rotation of 360° in your opinion? I read the version of ubuntu 12.04 about the dell XPS 13 (the most similar) that allows the touchscreen to function. Do you believe that this version of Ubuntu would be better for my 13 7000 series?\nWhat do you recommend to do?\nThank you, I aspect reply!\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS installed on Dell inspiron 13 7000 series (7348). Here the results.\nIt works almost everything. What does not work is:\n\n\n*\n\n*The touchpad, the first time I turned on the machine the trackpad worked more or less well: Left click OK, the two-finger scrolling OK, but the right-click did not work; from the second restart the trackpad does not work anymore, the arrow disappears even if the setting is on.\nI read a similar problem here, this can be the solution?\nClickpad not working on Dell Inspiron 13 7000, running Ubuntu 14.04\nI try.\n\n*The touchscreen, it works only in a basic, but it's the only way to move around. Single click OK, it does not work the zoom with two-finger touch and the touch prolonged that served (in windows) to right-click. So it's impossible to use it to take notes with the stylus, much less as a tablet because it does not react to the 360 ° screen rotation.\nCan someone please help me?\nI wait for answers, Thanks!\n[UPDATE]\nTouchpad problem SOLVED only doing 'blacklist i2c-hid' solution/workaround described here:\nhttp://trustdarkness.com/wordpress/dell-sputnik-xps-13-touchpad-settings-not-working-in-updated-ubuntumint/\nNow touchpad works in all its functions! :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Touchscreen problem remains, it works with the basic function of the click. Does anyone know help me?\n\n\nA: You can install the orientation program and start it via the terminal command \"sudo orientation\", or put it in the auto-start list. It needs a root permission. Works the same way as a Windows STMicroelectronics driver: it automatically rotates your view according to the display's position.

You seem to have a Standard Spinning Hard Disk which means swapping will cause your System to Go Crazy Slow.\nI had the same issue with my laptop I did the below.\n1) Reduce the Swappiness to 10. Use this Wiki \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\n2) Get rid of Swap completely. Remove the Fstab entry for SWAP.\nsudo nano /etc/fstab \nRemove the Entry for your swap partition.\n3) sudo apt-get install zram-config\nNow my system swaps to RAM instead of slow Hard Disk Drive which is causing slowness.\nTo establish this please do the below.\n1) sudo swapoff -a\nSee if system responsiveness Improves.

I'm not smart enough to use iptables directly, so I would use ufw for this. You can restrict the allowed network range using CIDR addressing e.g.\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 111\n\nIf that still doesn't work, you may need to configure nfs-kernel-server to use a static RPCMOUNTDOPTS port as described in the Debian SecuringNFS wiki. You can use rpcinfo -p to probe the current services / port settings.\n", "Q: apt-get update errors after installing google chrome I have asked a question related to this problem before here\nHow to fix Update error: Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file?.

I quite don't like Unity though, so I was thinking about ditching it for Elementary OS but I don't want to break the convenient hw compatibility. Also, for other Ubuntu based distros like Kubuntu or Netrunner, would switching to them require me to find new drivers/patches?\n\nA: The *buntu variants (Kubuntu, Ubuntu Mate, Xubuntu, etc) are just a different selection of applications held in one of the many *-desktop packages (eg kubuntu-desktop, mate-desktop, xubuntu-desktop, etc). You can switch to one of the others fairly easily, just by installing one of those and removing ubuntu-desktop and the applications it bundles.\nThe systems underneath these packages are exactly the same. It's Ubuntu.\nNetrunner and Elementary OS are different distributions run by different people. Some might be based on Ubuntu but few are package-compliant to the point you would just install a new meta-package, like you would with an official spin.\nThe same goes for their driver support. What they do is up to them and while Dell might \nSo yeah, if you want to try Kubuntu, it's fairly painless and you keep your existing underlying system.

I've generated a new one but I want to remove the lost ones from the keyserver.\n\nA: I am afraid that this is not possible. As pgp keys are synchronized also with other servers, it would also not be effective. Other keyservers would still have your key.\nThe following will not be very helpful for you, but it may help other readers:\nIf you had the private key, you could have used gpg to generate a revocation certificate, and upload that to the keyserver. This would not delete your key from the key server, but it would tell people who download it that the key has been revoked, and should not be used.\nMore information on this can be found here.\n\nA: For future readers of this question.\nOf course you can delete keys from a keyserver since they aren't physically engraved onto a indestructable stone.\nJokes aside I also wanted to have a key removed from ubuntu keyservers and I submitted a data privacy enquiry on their website.\nhttps://ubuntu.com/legal/data-privacy/enquiry\nI also signed this message with the key that I wanted to have removed. You probably can also provide a photo of an ID to have a key with your personal data removed.\nA couple of days later I got an email from ubuntu that they received my request according to GDPR article xyz followed by another email a few hours later that they have removed my key.\n\nA: TL;DR: There is no way, you're out of luck.\nDeletion\nOpenPGP key servers do not allow removal of keys for various reasons, mostly it boils down to\n\n\n*\n\n*having the OpenPGP web of trust being resilient against deletion attacks,\n\n*missing procedures to do so,\n\n*technical reasons with the key servers exchanging keys with each other (\"gossiping\") and\n\n*the fact key servers are operated by hundreds of individuals all over the world (also in pretty much all countries of the world, if you'd like to go through the legal route).\n\n\nIf you'd ask the individual operators to remove a key, they might block it on their own server (but the others will still be hosting it), or simply tell you they won't do so because of the reasons given above.\nFor further reading, I'd recommend How long do keys stay on keyservers? for a more detailed discussion why deleting keys would be a bad thing to have.\nRevocation\nThe \"OpenPGP way\" to remove old keys is to mark them as revoked by uploading special revocation certificates. These will tell other OpenPGP users that your key is superseded.\nRevoking keys is not possible if you don't have access to the private key, defined a designated revoker or a pregenerated revocation certificate.\nIf you don't have a revocation certificate for your new key yet, generate one now!\nComments\nComments are hardly possible, either:\n\n\n*\n\n*people would not realize they're there if using some OpenPGP client software\n\n*anybody could've uploaded them, as you can't sign them with your private key\n\n*there is no such thing as comments anyway.\n\n\n\nPrecautions\nTo prevent loosing access to your key, do following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Regularly backup your computer (important anyway).\n\n*Create an offline copy of your private keys.\n\n*Create a revocation certificate immediately after creating a primary key. Store it both in a digital way and print it on a piece of paper (I recommend something like gpg --gen-revoke | qrencode to be able to scan the certificate without the hassles of OCR).\n\n*Create a second copy and hand it to somebody you trust. He cannot do anything but revoke your keys with it (never gain access!), but you always have a fall-back in worst case scenarios (house burned, robbery, ...).\n\n\nA: Your private key is not on any keyserver unless you have done something Very Wrong. The only key that should be on the keyserver is your PUBLIC key.\nSo, you cannot retrieve your private key from a keyserver in any case.\nIf you have only \"formatted\" your disk (and not done security wipe or physical destruction), then you may be able to recover the private key using file recovery or forensic techniques. These methods will depend on the disk format, operating system and other factors.\n", "Q: Updating Ubuntu 14.04.iso I have had to reinstall Ubuntu from iso and was wondering now that I have updated all the files etc, is there away that I can add these updated files to the iso so next time I have to do a reinstall then atleast I will have a reasonably upto date iso file.

(Depending on the size of the internal HDD and the amount of data that the external HDD contained, your chances of recovery vary from 0% to an unknown %…) \nAs you're talking about a D-drive, I suppose you were following very advanced Linux instructions to the letter and that is why the original post mentions:\n\nIt is critical at this point to get the dd command correctly.

I have verified that taskset works with processes other than VirtualBox (so I know I've setup isolcpus correctly). What I believe is happening is that VirtualBox is just the frontend, and when I pick the VM I actually want it's somehow launching it such that the core pinning isn't inherited.\nHow can I make the actual VM instance obey the pinning?\n\nA: You are right VirtualBox is not the only process that needs to be contained, but it's more than just a front end.\nShort answer: Try binding VBoxSVC.\nLong answer:\nYou should probably use top (or better htop) in your computer to find the component that is doing the work in your situation, Virtualbox spans at least two background processes VBoxSVC, that at least in my computer looks like the main CPU user and VBoxXPCOMIPCD that looks like some kind of communication server. \nNote that only one of each processes are spawn for each user even if multiple VMs are started by the same user.

VBox suggests an extremely inadequate default size for its root partition, so I had to create and mount a more realistic /dev/sdb1 to do anything useful.  Despite that, / (/dev/sda1) is 96% full, and /usr appears to be by far the largest consumer, causing me to ^C out of du -s /usr.\nMy first mistake was to sudo mv /lib /home/jerry/sdb1/root_lib with the intention of following this with ln -s /home/jerry/sdb1/root_lib /lib, only to find that nothing in /bin works without /lib!\nI am in the process of repairing this by mounting both virtual disks on a different device and copying the path back to its original location (even if not necessarily to the original clusters, as boot code might require).  Obviously, even if I did create a symlink while it's not bootably mounted, it's unlikely the system could process a symlink without /lib as an absolute path!\nBefore I waste my time and patience on another misguided experiment, is either /usr itself or any of its more bloated subdirectories, safe to move to another partition and instantiate as a symlink?  :D\n\nA: In archlinux, /bin, /lib, lib64, /sbin are all symlinks and this works fine.\nI don't see why it's not working with you. You should have made the symlinks while the system was not running, ie by mounting the filesystem in a live session or similar\nAlso, if you use partitions and mount them, then I don't see why you need to use symlinks at all? For example, you could copy only the content of /lib/* into your new partition and mount it under /lib with /lib directory still on your root partition. That way, there is no need for symlinks.\n", "Q: where can i download windows installer for ubuntu or wubi?

To overcome this either escape all those to treat them special or use the -E option of grep.\n\n*Another problem caused by the above not escaping issue is that $() is the bash command substitution pattern, as you have not escaped the relevant characters bash was treating the pattern $() as command substitution. Note that the \\\\$() actually makes the command \\ plus command substitution as first \\ will make the second \\ literal and the remaining command substiturion pattern will be left as it is.\nAlso note that -i is needless here as we are not searching alphabatic characters. You might be interested in printing the file names :\ngrep -Hrn \"\\$\\('\\|\\\"\\)\" /path/to/directory\n\nAnother thing is that you could get away without escaping $ (indicates the end of line) in this case becasue there are characters to match after $, as a result grep will treat it literally :\ngrep -Hrn \"$\\('\\|\\\"\\)\" /path/to/directory\n\n\nA: No idea what you're doing wrong, as I am not so good with grep, but you should be doing this  grep  \"\\$'\\|\\$\\\"\", basically search for $' or $\", and notice that those expressions are all escaped\nHere's an example:\n\n", "Q: Error opening zip file or JAR manifest missing : /usr/share/java/jayatanaag.jar I've made a mistake by: \n\n\"sudo rm -rf /usr/share/java\"\n\nNow, every check version by \n\n\"java -version\"\n\nthe output messages is: \n\n\"Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -javaagent:/usr/share/java/jayatanaag.jar\nError opening zip file or JAR manifest missing : /usr/share/java/jayatanaag.jar\nError occurred during initialization of VM\n  agent library failed to init: instrument\"\n\nMy question:\nHow can I solve it for check java -version?\nUpdate (1): by apply \"sudo apt-get install --reinstall oracle-java6-installer\", the output:\n\n:~$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall oracle-java6-installer\n[sudo] password for evergreen: \nReading package lists...

The volume is less than half full and I'm looking to unraid the disks, keeping the data so that I can use one of the disks in another machine.\nIdeally I'd like to be able to do this without buying another drive for data copy.\nThanks!\n\nA: If the raid array is partitioned, then you can use gparted to shrink and/or move the filesystems within it until the second half of the disk is unused.  If it is not partitioned, then you need to shrink the filesystem with resize2fs ( assuming it is ext[234] ).  Give yourself a little extra room just to be sure.  Then you can convert the raid0 into a degraded raid4, which supports reshaping ( raid0 does not, but a degraded raid4 is essentially the same thing as a raid0 ).  Then you can reshape the array down to only one disk, and remove the second disk.\nresize2fs /dev/md2 2800M  # 2 3gb drives, left an extra 200mb of margin\nmdadm -G /dev/md2 -l raid4\nmdadm -G /dev/md2 -Z 2900M\ne2fsck -f /dev/md2 # make sure you didn't break things\nmdadm -G /dev/md2 -n 2 --backup=backup\nmdadm -D /dev/md2 # watch until it is done reshaping\nmdadm -G /dev/md2 -l raid0 # drop the second disk and go back to ( single disk ) raid0\nmdadm -G /dev/md2 -Z max\nresize2fs /dev/md2  # maximize the fs to use the full disk\n\nIn the process of testing this, I found that resize2fs would not let me shrink the fs to half of its original size even though it was only 33% used.

At this point the\nuser may enter 'e' to re-edit the sudoers file, 'x' to exit without\nsaving the changes, or 'Q' to quit and save changes. The 'Q' option\nshould be used with extreme care because if visudo believes there to\nbe a parse error, so will sudo and no one will be able to sudo again\nuntil the error is fixed. If 'e' is typed to edit the sudoers file\nafter a parse error has been detected, the cursor will be placed on\nthe line where the error occurred (if the editor supports this\nfeature).\n\n\nHowever, this is pretty much a wall of text, and not very intuitive.\nTo avoid confusion if you get a syntax error, I'll recommend that you define the following function in your ~/.bashrc (or another file sourced from ~/.bashrc).\n# Improved visudo command\neditsudo () {\n  echo \"Valid options at the 'What now?' prompt:\"\n  echo \"  e : Re-edit the sudoers file\"\n  echo \"  x : Exit without saving the changes\"\n  echo \"  Q : Quit and save changes (NOT recommended)\"\n  sudo visudo\n}\n\nNow this has 2 advantages:\n\n*\n\n*The command editsudo ensures to run sudo visudo (so it's shorter).\n\n*The command editsudo prints a help text first, so that if you exits out with an error you have the relevant info right above.\n\n\nA: It is just safer to use visudo. You can edit /etc/sudoers directly, but if you make a typo there, you will not be able to use sudo anymore. And won't be able to fix your error.\nvisudo locks the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks, and checks for parse errors.\nYou can read more by:\nman visudo\n\n\nA: Straight from the horse's mouth, man visudo:\n\nvisudo edits the sudoers file in a safe fashion, analogous to vipw(8).  visudo locks the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks, and checks for parse errors before installing the edited file.  If the sudoers file is currently being edited you will receive a message to try again later.\nvisudo parses the sudoers file after editing and will not save the changes if there is a syntax error.  Upon finding an error, visudo will print a message stating the line number(s) where the error occurred and the user will receive the “What now?” prompt.  [...]\n\n", "Q: Explanation of visudo lock file When I edit /etc/sudoers using visudo, I think it saves to sudoers.tmp, checks it for errors, then copies it to the real /etc/sudoers.\nHowever, I can't confirm my theory (how the lock file is used) in the man pages:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/dapper/man8/visudo.8.html - it's not described there.\nDoes anyone know if this behavior is described anywhere? Or is this because lock files are so common it's not described in visudo?\n\nA: It is mentioned in man visudo. \nFrom man visudo go to FILES section, you will find :\n\n /etc/sudoers.tmp          Lock file for visudo\n\n\nIt is also described in the illustration of -f option :\n\n-f sudoers, --file=sudoers\nSpecify an alternate sudoers file location.  With this option, \n  visudo will edit (or check) the sudoers file of your\n  choice,\n                   instead of the default, /etc/sudoers.  The lock file used is the specified sudoers file with “.tmp” appended to it.  In\n                   check-only mode only, the argument to -f may be ‘-’, indicating that sudoers will be read from the standard input.\n\nIf you are interested you can trace the system calls, here what you will find :\n\nopen(\"/etc/sudoers.tmp\", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0600) = 7\n\nEDIT :\nYour concept is right and yes i also personally think that as this is a generic concept it is not mentioned in the man page.\n", "Q: nvidia control panel reporting 60hz on 144hz monitor. how to make ubuntu output 144hz?

In the BIOS it says I have 8192 MB of Installed Memory. However, when I run free -m in Xubuntu 14.04 it says I only have 7111 MB of memory. It seems the BIOS is reserving about 1 GB of my RAM. \nTo try to remedy this issue, in the BIOS I went into Video Setup and changed the UMA Frame Buffer size from Auto to the minimum value of 32M (image below). This then bricked my BIOS which I was able to reset and fix. I thought this was the setting for memory size for the integrated graphics card that I do not use. I use a discreet card which is set as the main card PEG (PCI Express Graphics) in BIOS.  \nCould I possibly change the UMA Frame Buffer size to a different number that does not brick my BIOS? If at all possible, I'd like to avoid bricking my BIOS, no fun to do that. By the way, I also have Linux Mint 17 and it also shows the same amount of RAM availability as Xubuntu 14.04.

Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Change the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\n", "Q: Upgrade to 14.04 LTS from Windows 7 and 12.10 dual boot I have a dual boot of windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10 on my laptop.

The first few days have certainly been bumpy, and one of the issues I am facing is that I can't record streaming audio on Audacity.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: I understand your question as \"how can I use Audacity to record audio that is being streamed to me?\" There are a lot of good answers here and I recognize that this question was from a while ago, but they don't quite touch on how I usually do it, so I felt I'd contribute.\nIt's easy if you've got Pulse Audio Volume Control (though Pulse has gotten a little bit buggy in recent years). You can get it on just about any Ubuntu-based distro through the software center, or via:\nsudo apt install pavucontrol\n\n...along with its dependencies, which are probably already on your machine.\nOpen it and you'll find a few tabs; Playback and Recording, which cover program terminals; and also Input and Output, which are about detected hardware, and last Configuration, which is pretty self-explanatory and not something you'll usually need to worry about.\nAfter pressing Record on Audacity, Audacity will show up under the Recording pane. From there, you can use a drop-down to switch which input it is listening to. Some of those inputs are what's called \"monitors\", which is basically a watch on what's coming out of your speakers or moving to any other output device. Usually you'll want \"Monitor of Built-In Analog Stereo\", or your equivalent, and Audacity will start recording what's leaving your speakers.\nThis is admittedly very similar to what was suggested by Dario Salvati, and more and more distros are duplicating Pulse features in their default sound; but I've found them to be a bit sketchy on monitors. Pulse more-or-less gets you a virtual rack with a GUI.\n\nA: *\n\n*In Audacity you have the red button to record.\n\n*Chose (Alsa - default - line:1 )\n\n\nA: Try this: go on System Settings, then Sound as follow\n\nNow, go to the Input section and select the source device.\n\nThen, start recording from Audacity like you used to.\n\nA: Recording audio with Linux Mint 17.\nThere are lots of posts and tutorials about this subject, and it is fraught with challenges.\nMy project involves copying all my old VHS tapes to DVD.\nThe usual video capture hardware based on the Empia 2861 chipset produces rubbish audio, noisy, distorted and full of glitches and dropouts.\nThe solution is to use the 2861 hardware to record the video, and record the audio via the computer line input.  This involves purchasing or making up an adaptor cable from twin RCA connectors to miniature stereo jack.\nThe application of choice for recording audio appeared to be Audacity.  The problem is that on long recordings (over an hour), Audacity has a nasty problem of stopping, locking up or dropping periods of recording.  Changing focus appeared to knock it out of record mode, and even when I left the computer alone with only Audacity running, it still dropped out of record mode.  When I tried to splice the resulting clips, Audacity just sneered at me and crashed.\n\nAfter a lot of research I discovered that arecord is built into our Linux distros.  It is a very simple command-line application, which can be persuaded to show a VU meter of sorts.  This has proven to be very reliable, and makes nice (huge) WAV files from the line input.  The screenshot shows an arecord session in the terminal window at top left.\nThe -c 2 parameter puts arecord into stereo mode.  -f cd sets the resolution (16 bits) and the sample rate (44.1 kHz) to the normal PCM standard.  -V stereo produces the VU meter on the line after the command.\nThis generates about 10.6 Mbyte per minute.  Ctrl+C terminates the recording.\nNext thing is to adjust the level on the line signal.  Click on the speaker icon in the system tray left of the update status, and select “Sound Settings.”  This produces the screen at lower right: select the “Input” tab.  This allows you to set the level to give a reasonable fill of the level meter without clipping.\nBeware: the “Input Volume” slider is very sensitive; but once selected, you can inch it up and down with the left- and right-arrow keys on the keyboard.\nNow we can record, but we can't hear what is being recorded.  For music videos, I was finding it much better to record the sound track separately and sync it to the video later, so I could not look at the video to see where things had progressed to.  This is where Audacity comes into its own.  You can see my Audacity session at upper right of the screenshot.  The input is selected as “default: Line:0” and the output as “ALSA.”\nPull down the “Transport” menu and make sure that “Software Playthrough” is checked.  This effectively connects the line input to your speakers.\nClick the down-arrow next to the microphone icon, and select “Start Monitoring.”\nLo and behold, the level meters come to life, and you can hear what is coming into your line input.  I find the Audacity level meters a bit more informative than the command-line jobbie attached to arecord.  Again, simple things knock Audacity out of monitoring mode, but you can switch monitoring off, then back on, and it carries on working.  Audacity's shenanigans do not appear to affect the recording made by arecord.\nDon't touch the Sound Settings applet whilst recording.  This will introduce snaps, crackles and pops into your recording.\n\nA: Type ctrl+alt+t to open the terminal, then type in alsamixer to open the control panel. Here use the arrow keys to move to mic boost and activate it. Problem solved!\n\nA: Simply press the shortcut Shift+Ctrl+G or open the menu Transport > Record\nThis will start recording your streamed audio. \n\n", "Q: Problems difference with installing drivers for nVIDEA GTS 450 Help me I'm a newbie at Ubuntu or Linux.\nI have a NVIDIA Corporation:GF 106 [Geforce GTS 450]\nI thought I could just change my driver on the \"Additional Drivers: menu for my video card but when I click the other options then \"Apply Changes\" it goes back to the Nouveau display driver.\n(Can't post picture)\nPicture link : http://s21.postimg.org/tjn690m93/nvidia.png\nI have learned that I can install it using Bumblebee? or from nvidia directly?

But upgrades to a better graphics card (GPU) and a solid state drive (SSD) could help to make your laptop faster. The 64 bit version of Ubuntu also improves the performance a bit.\nHowever, I don't think you should go ahead with replacing your CPU.

So try installing an SSD, using the 64 bit Ubuntu and probably a new graphics card.\n\nA: You say it had an AMD graphics card in it (and the product page confirms this) - did you take it out, or are you just mistakenly referring to it in a past-tense?\nIf the AMD graphics card is stand-alone (which as I understand it, it is), there's no reason why you couldn't upgrade the graphics card... But due to the design (which offers limited space), you'll probably find that only a laptop graphics card will physically fit (\"all-in-ones\" rarely use \"regular\" graphics cards)...\nA little more expensive, but they fit, they're designed to use less power and in terms of performance, your only real limitation is your budget.\nAn SSD (solid state drive) and if you're running a 64-bit version of Ubuntu (Unity Dash-->Details-->OS type), more RAM (memory) will also increase your performance somewhat... Additional RAM (memory) will make the computer faster in general (though I wouldn't go beyond 16GB unless you've got money to waste - it's a waste outside of specific usage scenarios), and an SSD will significantly shorten load times of the computer, it's programs and files (they're expensive though).\n", "Q: k9copy concerns I downloaded k9copy from tomtomtom and test installed it.

I plan to install Ubuntu soon on my PC. I currently use a TP-LINK TL-WN822N wireless adapter. I want to know if it will work without additional setup.\n\nA: Take a look at\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsTP-Link\nLook for TL-WN822N \n\n\nPlease ensure that you also install linux-firmware package after installing Ubuntu.\nIf you still have issues please post results of lspci and lsusb commands.\n\nA: There are 4 different versions of this wireless adapter and they use different chipsets:\n\n\n*\n\n*Versions 1 and 2 use Atheros AR7010.\n\n*Version 3 uses Realtek RTL8192CU.\n\n*Version 4 uses Realtek RTL8192EU.\n\n\nTo find out which version you have, take a look at the back of the adapter - it will say something like \"Ver:3.0\". Alternatively, use lsusb - my TP-LINK WN822N V3 identifies as \"Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8192CU 802.11n WLAN Adapter\".\n\nIf you have the Atheros-based one, the driver used is ath9k_htc and it should work out-of-the-box. \nThis page lists the drivers currently used for Realtek chipsets - essentially, they will all be replaced with rtl8xxxu at some point.\nThat said, while version 3 works out-of-the-box with the rtl8192cu driver, that driver is really bad (slow speed, disconnects occasionally). You'll want to install rtl8192cu-fixes to make it usable (which will also blacklist rtl8192cu).\nI have no information about version 4, but RTL8192EU should work out-of-the-box with the rtl8xxxu driver on newer distros.\n\nA: It should work with Ubuntu without additional setup. But kernel driver for this adapter may work unstable. I suggest to install a better driver from source.\nsudo apt-get install git\ngit clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new.git\ncd rtlwifi_new\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThis answer is applicable to hardware version 3.0 of this adapter with a Realtek chip. Previous versions should work well out of the box.\nI packaged this driver to DKMS format and added it to ppa. If you instal it from there, you will not need to re-install it after kernel upgrades. It can be installed by\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hanipouspilot/rtlwifi\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rtl8192cu-dkms\n\n", "Q: Accidentally run command rm -R in Amazon EC2.

I tried du but that doesn't output the empty space of a folder. Any commands to do this?\n\nA: Just to clarify it a little more (hope i do not miss any special filesystem):\n\n\n*\n\n*Folders are a small file\n\n*Folders grow as more files / sub folders are added to it (but not to a sub folder of it), only directly to it\n\n*Folders (on some systems do not) decrease on size when files / sub folders directly on it are removed from it\n\n*Think on folders as a phonebook list\n\n*Most filesystems leave empty entries on folders (just to not move all the rest up), so size most of the times only grows\n\n*Folder size does not include any file size (unless such folder is a container where talking about free space may have a meaning: size to reach max container size)\n\n*Folder size depends on the number of entries (including the ones than have been blanked) ceiling it to a multiply of a number\n\n*Folders does not hold inside it any content of any file (except special folders that are really a container, with or without a max size defined)\n\n\nAt least for FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, ext, ext2, ext3, ext4, and maybe for much more filesystems, folders are a small file that identifies what folders and files are under it, just like a phonebook list, it only describes what is inside it (beware: only directly on it, nothing about what is inside any sub folder).\nNTTS has some extra things, but all has it's unique identificator (a number), folders identify only what of such identificators are just directly on such folder, not the ones that are in a sub folder of it, etc.\nBeware there are filesystems very special, on that ones a Folder can have a size (upper limit) and so it has sence to talk about free space inside that folder.\nFor most Linux users to understand that, treat such Folder as a Container with a max size, concept is near the VDI files of VirtualBOX, etc. They can grow up to a limited size. Some special filesystems use that concept for a Folder, while others (like Pismo Private Folders) use a no max size limit.\nFor most Windows users to understand that, treat such Folder a a sparse big file, that with some 3rd part tool is seen as a folder.\nIn other words, the are three common well defined type of thing on a file system (including some special filesystems not so much common to see):\n\n\n*\n\n*Files (hold information, or links to other files)\n\n*Normal folders, they are really a small file (hold a list of what is directly on its 1st level inside them)\n\n*Special folders, they can be seen as a huge file, with or without an upper size limit (holds all what is inside them, list and content of all, including sub folders, etc); not all filesystems allow them natively, most use the trick of defining a file and then mount it as if it where a folder (like .zip, .rar, .7z mounter utilities, etc), but a few filesystems allow them natively.\n\n\nIf you want to see something very weird, try this (on a NTFS):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder on the root, called for example: MyWeirdFolder\n\n*Then inside it create a sub folder with a very large name (more than 200 characters)\n\n*Create another folder, but with a short name, like WillBeRenamed\n\n*Move the long one inside the short one\n\n*Rename the short one to a very long name (more than 200) characters\n\n\nYou will get a path that is not accesible due to very long path, just rename such long names to shorter ones and will get access to it again.\n\nA: Folders are as big as the total size of their contents; they do not have any free space. \nThe df command shows empty disk space. \n\nA: There is no meaning of a folder size. In really a folder/directory is just a File in Linux as the concept everything is a file in Linux.\nSo a folder is a file of files. I,e it's just a place to hold files, though it has no size, its size is related to the size of files inside.\nSo, there is nothing called free space on a folder.\nYou can know the size of a directory \ndu -sh\n\nalso you can know the free space of your whole filesystem\ndf -h\n\n", "Q: Evolution will not send mail with attachments I have been using Evolution for years.

The screen flashes once when trying to boot, then the phone is off again.\nWhen trying to use the boot menu (power & volume), I get to choose between normal, fast & safe boot, but all have the same result, a flash and then it's off again.\nI have not enabled developer mode. 3 weeks ago my disk was almost full, so I deleted the contents of the cache directory, but after that the phone was booting fine.\nWhat can I do?

After few attempts the phone booted normally but I didn't find pattern that works every time.\n\nA: Try to use the power button for a very long time, phone should reboot perfectly.\nWorked with mine after typing 'reboot' on the terminal and the phone became bricked.\n\nA: I've noticed that if my Aquaris has low charge then it refuses to turn on, even though it clearly has enough to get as far as the charging status screen. The only reliable solution I've found is to wait a while for the phone to charge more (about five minutes on my charger) and then try again.\n\nA: I have a pretty similar issue:\nI get a short period of flickering when I hit the power button to unlock, but only in these two cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*when automatic brightness adjust is on, and I'm in the dark.\n\n*when I turn brightness to minimum.\n\n\nSo in both cases it seems the brightness level is a factor.\nI've found that pressing volume up and down simultaneously causes the phone to flash the display for a short time, as if that were a command to turn it on. You could try this on several boot-stages.\n", "Q: Hide Title Bar When Maximized in GNOME 3.16 In GNOME 3.14 and 3.12, I had a modification in metacity-theme-3.xml which basically hides the title bar from any window when it's maximized. I preferred this method to the Maximus Two extension because the extension's behavior is inconsistent where sometimes I would see a transparent bar in place of the title bar on maximized windows (usually after resuming from a suspend).\nNow, in GNOME 3.16, the metacity tweak doesn't work anymore because GNOME no longer uses it. I've tried custom gtk3 css such as:\n.maximized .titlebar {\n    display: none;\n}\n\nand variations of that, to no avail. Is this possible to achieve through gtk-3 custom css?\nUpdate: Pixel Saver is a good extension for doing just this without any bugs but I would still like to know if there's a way to do it manually.\n\nA: To get to the core of why the metacity theme tweak no longer works we have to look at the gnome blog itself where gnome developer where Florian Müllner explains that when drawing the title bars gnome no longer uses metacity at all and they are always drawn by Gtk+\nThis means that a css answer is the only one that will work and I believe you are most of the way there. I read on this commit page that the css you want is somewhat like this:\n.maximized .header-bar.default-decoration {\n  padding: 0;\n  font-size: 0.7em;\n}\n\n.maximized .header-bar.default-decoration .button.titlebutton {\n  padding: 0;\n  border-width: 0;\n}\n\nOr like this:\n.maximized headerbar.default-decoration {\n  padding: 0;\n  font-size: 0.7em;\n  min-height: 0;\n}\n.maximized headerbar.default-decoration button.titlebutton {\n  padding: 0;\n  border-width: 0;\n  min-width: 0;\n  min-height: 0;\n}\n\nThe reason the css can't hide or remove the element like it can with html (or svg) is that the css applies to gtk properties and the visibility of an object isn't a property in the typical Gtk way. You actually have to call widget.hide() from code. Similar to how Gimp themes have to hide widgets by making them the same colour as the background as a hack.\n", "Q: Which Ubuntu / Linux version have include plugins (Network,Audio / Video) I have used Linux Mint years back, That version has every plugins or Codecs (we normally called Drivers for windows) means (Network,Audio/video)etc...

However, after checking my I/O scheduler I see that it seems to be using deadline.\n\nA: No, you pretty much have to do most of the optimizations yourself.

Which version of Ubuntu / Linux is best supported & easy to install codecs on?\n\nA: If you're looking for an OS that has low spec requirements, then you're looking at one of three of the Ubuntu derivatives. Take a look at this Ubuntu wiki page for more info\n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu (LXDE)\n\n*Xubuntu (XFCE)\n\n*Ubuntu MATE (MATE)\n\n\nAll three of these would be a good choice for your laptop's specifications. \nI would personally choose one of those three over stock Ubuntu (Unity), Ubuntu GNOME (GNOME3) or Kubuntu (KDE) because they have higher minimum system requirements. However, I run stock Ubuntu (Unity) on a laptop with a Dual Core Core 2 Duo @ 1.6 GHz with 2.5 GB of RAM - so it's up to you.\nOnce you decide which derivative you're going to go with, you've got to decide which Ubuntu release to go with.\nCurrently, the supported versions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*12.04 LTS (And all subsequent .x releases)\n\n*14.04 LTS (And all subsequent .x releases)\n\n*14.10\n\n*15.04\n\n\nI would personally suggest using either 14.04 LTS (because it's stable and will be supported for 5 years) or 15.04 because it's the newest version. Basically, just ignore 14.10.\nAs for which architecture to choose, your processor is basically assured to be 64 bit - so I would just suggest downloading the 64 bit version. The 32 bit version will work, but if you have a 64 bit CPU you might as well make use of those extra 32 bits.\n\nA: For this hardware I would recommend 32-bit version of Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS.\nLTS are always preferred, especially for new users. And they are supported for 5 years.\n32-bit, because there is only 2GB of RAM and 32-bit version uses less RAM.\n64-bit should be almost as good.\n\nA: You can install the latest version of Ubuntu (15.04), but i would recommend you to install the 14.04 LTS version.See this http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop\n", "Q: Mouse cursor invisible after 15.04 update My mouse pointer became invisible after some updates after I upgraded to 15.04 from 14.10. \nIn all standard settings the mouse pointer is activated (system settings, dconf...)\nI also tried different cursor icons with no success.\nThe pointer is sometimes visible after I shut down and reboot the system. But only sometimes and I couldn't figure out a patterns why it sometimes shows up.\nI found the following solution which did not work\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active false\n\nAny help appreciated! thanks!\n\nA: I have similar problem. Mouse pointer is invisible after system boot, even on LightDM screen. To bring cursor back I'm switching to virtual console (ctrl+alt+f1) and run command:\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nAfter LightDM restart mouse pointer back to normal. I reported this bug to Launchpad.\n\nA: Open a terminal ctrl+alt+t and type sudo apt-get install lightdm --reinstall then sudo shutdown -r now to reboot. This worked for me and I've tested it by rebooting several times.\n\nA: This bug is still around for a Xubuntu 16.04 system using lightdm. A fix for Xubuntu, and possibly other DE's, as described on the Xubuntu 16.04 Release Post is to bring the cursor back with Ctrl+Alt+F1 followed by Ctrl+Alt+F7 .\nThis worked for me, where none of the other solutions had without reloading everything and closing every page.\n\nA: I have the same problem after upgrading to 15.04 from 14.10. Sometimes the mouse pointer will appear, this happens approx 1 in 5 computer switch on times. I found a way to get round this as suggested above.\n(note: this will hard-kill any running processes).\nsudo service lightdm restart\nThis does have to be issued after every start up . Does anybody know of a more long-term fix?\nI have now found a long-term fix. Switch to gdm instead.\nsudo apt-get install gdm\nafter trying several reboots this fix seems to work every time.\nI don't know if lightdm gives any advantages over gdm, but to me seeing the cursor is a big advantage of GDM over lightdm.\n\nA: There can be some problems of this kind if you have got nvidia optimus technology in your computer. Try to use different driver (e.g. Noveau display driver) from Additional Drivers tab in Software & Updates.\n\nA: I fixed it by going to displays setting (write dis in search bar) and than turned off the \"unknown display\". U see in displays setting two displays in the middle of picture in settings. One is built-in-display another is unknown. Choose unknown by clicking on it on the picture and take the button next to the \"Unknown Display\" from on to off. Tada\n\nA: From this post on Ubuntu forums, running this command in a terminal fixed this issue\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active false\n\nThis works intermittently for me... and I don't know yet why it works at times and not others, but. may help you too.\n\nA: Issuing the following command will restart compiz (the window manager and decorator), without loosing your desktop and loging out (like restarting lightdm would):\nsudo killall -i -HUP compiz\n\nThat brought my cursor back when it disappeared, while keeping all my windows and my currently working programs.\n\nA: A dirty hack I do (which surprisingly works for me) is to open terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and then type ls then the mouse shows in 1-2 seconds.\nThat said, the normal way that works is to restart the mouse driver. This solution also works when the mouse pointer is misbehaving (like flickering randomly out of control). You restart the mouse driver like:\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse  # disable the driver\nsudo modprobe psmouse # enable the mouse driver\n\n\nA: I had this problem as well, it seems like replacing gnome-setings-daemon with unity-settings-daemon seems to fix this problem.\n\nA: Have you tried this:\n gsettings set org.settings.daemon-plugins.cursor -KEY=s.cursor -VALUE=false\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n\nA: This is a very old Unity bug to which that are references that date back to 13.04. Given that Unity version 7 is reaching its end of life, probably it will never be fixed. For a while, logging out and logging back in would temporarily revive the mouse pointer, but this workaround no longer does it on Ubuntu 14.04. The gsettings set command is not functional on 14.04 either.\nHowever, this problem can be fixed on 14.04 by issuing this command:\nsetsid unity\nThis will reset all your Unity options, number of workspaces, launcher size, etc. But better that than not having the mouse pointer.\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 and Gnome Flashback here.\nThe mouse cursor would disappear during login.  Similar fix as mentioned above.\nI used \"dconf Editor\" and searched for \"cursor\".  I found the value that fixed the issue in the location:\norg,gnome,desktop,settings-daemon,plugins,cursor,active\nI unticked active and my mouse come back instantly and is surviving restarts.\n\nA: I fixed this issue by deleting my .config folder from my home dir (~) after noticing the issue only appeared on one user. While not ideal it is a possible fix.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on 15.04. At one point the mouse cursor suddenly disappeared, but when I moved to another workspace (Ctrl+Alt+Arrow) it reappeared.\n\nA: Doing this solved the problem for some of the users:   install dconf-editor \nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\nand change the icon size to smaller in settings.\nThat seems to solve the issues\n\nA: Here is how I solved the problem: \nCreate a shell script (yourscript.sh) with this code: \n#!/bin/bash\nservice lightdm restart \n\nAs root, move it to the /etc/init.d folder\nThen, open the folder in the terminal and run: \nchmod 755 yourscript.sh \n\nThen, while in terminal, enter this command: \nln -s /etc/init.d/yourscript.sh /etc/rc2.d/S99yourscript.sh \n\nNow, your mouse pointer will appear at every boot and the problem of the invisible mouse pointer should be gone. \nReferences: \nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/290107\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/629965/462410\n\nA: I had the same issue after upgrading to 16.04. I tried to install gdm as suggested by @user417467 but this didn't solve the problem so I reverted back to lightdm. I found that after logging back I can make the pointer reappear simply by pressing crtl+F7.\n\nA: Setup: Ubuntu 14.04 with default installation. I have automatic login enabled as well.\nFor me, I simply log off and log in again. At the login screen the mouse cursor returns and remains till next restart. Works every time for over 50 times now. \n\nA: Same problem upgrading Lubuntu 14.04 to Lubuntu 16.04. Cursor disappear after resume. Ctr-Alt-F1 ,  Ctr-Alt-F7 solve the issue.\n\nA: I solved it by plugging an unused wireless mouse dongle in to keep the driver happy.\n\nA: Well, On Ubuntustudio 16.04, I found out that if I get the mouse to hover the button for the app menu, and start to browse, it comes right back no problem!!\n\nA: I had the same issue on XUbuntu 15.10.\nThe only working way I found to get back the cursor is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+T (open the terminal)\n\n*sudo apt-get install gnome-screensaver\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+L (lock screen)\n\n*got the cursor back...\n\n\nA: I came here from google because I have been experiencing the same problem in ubuntu 16.04 . The last several times it has happened, i was reliably able to get the mouse back by simply opening a terminal using ctrl + alt + t .\nbetter than having to reboot every time.\n\nA: The top few answers did not work for me, however I managed to solve my problem by unplugging and re-plugging my USB mouse.\n\nA: I had to create a file called: \n20-intel.conf // I'm using intel graphics \nplace the file on: \n/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/\nUsing these lines:\nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier  \"card0\"\n        Driver      \"intel\"\n        Option      \"Backlight\"  \"intel_backlight\"\n        Option      \"AccelMethod\" \"uxa\"\n        Option      \"SWCursor\" \"on\"\n        BusID       \"PCI:0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\n", "Q: Set login password “unlock login keyring” neither old nor new Password works I reset my login in password on two desktop computers using the GUI at System Settings > User Accounts.\nOne computer gave no grief whatsoever, but the other computer the one I use as primary turned in to a nightmare.\nHad to go to reset the login password using the CD.

Some USB sticks don't work as liveUSB sticks. I've had some dodgy sticks in the past (especially Kingston ones). Try another USB stick.\n\nA: You can instruct Windows what to do when you hit the \"Power Button\". Your distro is sensing that Windows is hibernating, meaning that your user state is stored on the hard drive and is accessed at boot. To make sure it is not hibernating, go to the control panel, find the power settings, set it to power off, not hibernate, when you hit the off button. By default, it is set to hibernate. Tricky huh? If that doesn't work, it might have to do with \"Secure Booting\", a BIOS setting. On modern systems, \"Secure Booting\" interferes w/ what your doing. You can disable it in the BIOS settings, probably the \"DEL\" key before the OS is loaded. I have to hit F12 (boot menu) for my Live sticks, but I'm already dual booting 8.1 and Ubuntu.\nGood Luck\n\nA: It is likely the usb drive. Alot of usb drives now have \"Windows 8 certification\" which makes it impossible to boot a live distro. I would refer here to the faulty ones. You may also need to disable secure boot. Isn't microsoft the worst for messing all this up? Disabling quick boot might also help.\nAlso, as another user said you may also need to go to the control panel and under change what the power button does in the power settings.

Some say 1Gb for boot partition.\nYou've probably been here already:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootPartition\nThe UEFI and EFI question lingers as does Boot repair, which just might solve you problem.

The deadlock happens when a process tries to clean up a cgroup directory. I'd recommend you to update your kernel to newer version.\n", "Q: Installing 32-bit libbz2.so.1 in 64-bit Ubuntu I'm trying to install LabView on my computer (Ubuntu 15.04, 64-bit), but I need the 32-bit libbz2.so.1 library, based on these instructions on the NI website and googling elsewhere. However, the link to download getlibs to install it doesn't work, I can't find getlibs anywhere else (all the links are old and broken), and the other option I was considering (ia32-libs) isn't part of Ubuntu anymore. (These instructions were unsuccessful - I still got the error Package 'ia32-libs' has no installation candidate).\nHow can I get this 32-bit version of the library to install LabView?\n\nA: The package for libbz2.so.1 is libbz2-1.0. You can check this with the command:\napt-file search libbz2.so.1\n\nSample output:\n% apt-file search libbz2.so.1 \nlibbz2-1.0: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libbz2.so.1\nlibbz2-1.0: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libbz2.so.1.0\nlibbz2-1.0: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libbz2.so.1.0.4\n\nTherefore install the package for 32-bit with the command:\nsudo apt-get install libbz2-1.0:i386\n\nThe library ia32-libs is no longer in the repositories. Check here.\n\nA: Are you still trying to do this? I (after much frustration) installed LabVIEW 8.5 32-bit on my new 64-bit Linux Mint Debian Edition 2 (LMDE2) machine today. Should be similar for Ubuntu. \nYou probably already did, but for those who don't know the first thing to do is set up multiarch (the ability to run 32-bit programs on 64-bit machines):\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThis broke my Cinnamon; but running the update manager fixed it again. That's a LMDE specific problem; I don't think you need to worry about that. Then install some dependencies. bzip2 includes the libbz2.so.1 you were looking for, and (as already mentioned) lib32z1 replaces ia32-libs:\nsudo apt-get install lib32z1\nsudo apt-get install bzip2:i386\n\nThe LabVIEW installer looks in an unusual place for a file, so we make a link to it so it can find it:\nsudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 /lib/libc.so.6\n\nNow the LabVIEW installer will run, but LabVIEW won't start after the installer finishes because it needs libGL.so.1. This is where my method is a bit iffy and there is certainly a better method ... but this is how I did it:\nsudo apt-get install libgl1-fglrx-glx:i386 \n\nThis installed the libGL.so.1. It also killed my MDM (graphical login). So I dropped to a tty, made a copy of libGL.so.1, and then \nsudo apt-get remove libgl1-fglrx-glx:i386\nsudo cp libGL.so.1 /usr/lib\n\nAfter that, everything worked :). I hope this helps you or someone.\n", "Q: Saving current configs Is it possible in 14.04 to save the current system settings? \nI want (yet again) to install NVidia drives, but I'd like to save the current state of my settings and be able to roll back to the current state in case the drives don't work.\n\nA: The easiest and most reliable way to do this is to take a full backup of the drive.

I thought that ubuntu is a more or less virus-free system (\nplease,in case when u answering, try to be as thorough as it's possible, because I installed ubuntu just a month ago.\n\nA: okay, now I can answer to this question by myself. So, this tipe of virus is situated not in the PC itself (may be it can create some suspisious files in various directories, but even if u remove them every time it doesn't mean that the problem is solved). It's just changeing something within the router, making some kind  of new DNS (in my case it started with 185.) and this is the main reason of pop-ups. By the way, I didn't instal anything suspisios, the infection was from clicking suspisious webpages, adds, I don't know. \nAnd by the way, because of the abovementioned this infection affects also\nvia Wi-Fi.\nSo one have just to contact to Internet provider's support team, ask them to change that DNS into the provider's DNS.

So does anybody know either the name of this software, or another way round this issue?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\n\n\nA: There are a few things you need to do to play DVDs in Ubuntu.  First you need to install restricted extras:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nNext you need to install libdvdread:\nsudo apt-get install libdvdread4\n\nFinally you need to execute it:\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\nSome Media Players won't automatically update with the ability to play DVDs. I would recommend installing VLC (if you haven't already), and using it to watch DVDs.\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\n\nA: Another thing to check is that your region is set correctly on your DVD drive.\nFrom Setting DVD Region Codes:\n\nIf your DVD player regularly locks up when you try to play back a DVD,\n  your DVD player probably does not match the DVD's region code.\n  Region codes are a form of vendor lock-in. For example, you cannot\n  play a DVD published in Japan (Region 2) on a DVD player in the United\n  States (Region 1) without changing the region code of the DVD player\n  (unless you own a region-free DVD player). You can view or modify the\n  region code of your DVD drive with the regionset tool.\n\nYou can install the regionset utility from universe with the following command:\n sudo apt-get install regionset\n\nThen to set the region, insert a DVD from the region you want to use and run the following command (replace sr0 with the name of your DVD drive if different):\nsudo regionset /dev/sr0\n\nNote there is a 5 change limit (usually).\nAlso note most players will ignore the region set (and some drives come without any set region). \nFurther details see Setting DVD Region Codes.\n", "Q: Eclipse Crashing in Ubuntu 15.04 I have recently upgraded to Ubuntu 15.04 from 14.10 and my eclipse Luna keep crashing abruptly.

I use this every day at work, where I have ubuntu and centos VMs running on VMWare Workstation under windows (and I have both setup with Samba, so I can copy files between VMs).  In my past job I had Windows and Centos VMs running under an Ubuntu desktop.  \nI've had some experience of installing RPM packages under ubuntu using Alien, but it tends to be a game of basically unpacking the package to get the application tree, and putting it in /opt and then working through the scripts/config files to resolve dependencies to some other package or refer to something that is in a different path.  \nI suspect developing in an ubuntu VM will be much easier for you, especially as with X running on your desktop, you can forward X connections to your ubuntu VM and have the GUI display on your desktop, and if you setup your desktop to export /home via NFS, you could configure your VM to share your home folder within that NFS mount, so you can have your workspace on your native computer and just use the VM for emulation and compilation.  \n", "Q: VM Resolution can't go over 640x480, even after guest additions were installed This is on VirtualBox, guest is Xubuntu 32bits 14.04, host is Windows 8.1 64bits\nI should point my hardware does not allow x86 virtualization, hence why VirtualBox only allowed a 32bits VM to be installed. \nSide note : It's an AMD FX 6300, although in the specifications it says virtualization supported, my BIOS says otherwise.\n\nA: When your VM is shut down, change the available video memory to something higher.

Use a different key if that's not it).  Once you're in linux, you will have to run\nsudo update-grub\n\nThat should do it.  You may also have to change the default boot device to the partition containing the GRUB bootloader.\n\nA: Loading Ubuntu on a different HD avoids the problem of having to choose between Windows and Ubuntu - instead you choose the startup device which appears to be far easier.\nFWIW I successfully installed Ubuntu 15.04 (from a CD burned with the 15.04 image) on a T520i with Windows 7 (professional) (64 bit - that may have made the difference).  Also probably making a difference is I installed 15.04 on an external HD rather than the HD with the windows system.\nOn the T520i   \"control + F12\"  is  what you hold down on startup to get the menu to select what device to boot from. (other computers will use different keys but there should be one to enable selection of booting device when starting up.   You may have to go thru several menus to get to the bootup device selection option.*1) Since the external HD does not contain windows, booting from it avoids any need to select between Windows and Ubuntu.  [[NOTE:   I tried installing with 14.04 (15 not then available) on an HP Pavillion 017DX and on startup I get the choice between windows and Ubuntu and select Ubuntu it says that a file is missing!  (which is why I tried from an external HD the second time)]]\nAFAICS, the only downside to the approach of loading Ubuntu on a different HD from windows that if it's an external HD you have more to lug around.

But my laptop (old Acer aspire one 722) is 64 bit. When i realized this, wanted to see if i can get t64 ubuntu (same LTS 14.4). Made a bootable USB using unetbootin. But on shutdown and start, it says missing or bad OS (USB is default), then goes to hard drive and the 32 bit boots up.\nMain point where my question is different than others is that I ask about my specific hardware. After talking to a linux admin, he said even if make my laptop 8GB the CPU is quite out dated, so now I plan to buy a new laptop in 5-6 months before I change OS to 64. It is a 3 year old laptop. And has only 1 working slot, the other one is a blank.\nOutput of lscpu\nArchitecture:          i686\nCPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit\nByte Order:            Little Endian\nCPU(s):                2\nOn-line CPU(s) list:   0,1\nThread(s) per core:    1\nCore(s) per socket:    2\nSocket(s):             1\nVendor ID:             AuthenticAMD\nCPU family:            20\nModel:                 2\nStepping:              0\nCPU MHz:               800.000\nBogoMIPS:              1995.07\nVirtualization:        AMD-V\nL1d cache:             32K\nL1i cache:             32K\nL2 cache:              512K\n\nOne of the reasons I want to try the 64 is that this laptop used to be windows XP and now on ubuntu it seems slower, probably cause the CPU is old and only 4GB ram. But wondering if 64 arch will make things better?\nIf I use ubuntu 12 will laptop performance be better?\n\nA: If you only have 4GB of ram, then 64 bit won't do any good for performance.  If you plan on upgrading the ram, you might want 64 bit, but if you're not going to upgrade in the nearish future, I wouldn't bother with it.  Also, for an install, I prefer an actual DVD install disk.  I find them more reliable than USB drives, since more machines can boot off a DVD but not USB.\nUbuntu 14, in my experience, seems to run just as fast as Ubuntu 12.  You might want to try Ubuntu 15, the latest version.\n\nA: UNetBootin has become less and less reliable. Use dd from the command line to create an USB bootable drive. (warning: follow the instructions correctly, not doing so may result in a loss of data)\nPlug in your USB stick. It will get erased, so make sure there are no important files on it.\nDisplay all drives:\ndf -h\n\nLook for /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc. The size of the drive can be seen in the second column. Make sure the size matches your USB stick.\nDo not use /dev/sdc1 or /dev/sdb1, but instead omit the 1 so you use /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc.\nNow open the terminal in the folder where you downloaded your ISO, for example\ncd ~/Downloads\n\nThen flash the ISO onto the USB drive (replace the X with an b/c depending on the output of df -h). Make sure the ISO file name is correct (here ubuntu*.iso).\nsudo dd if=ubuntu*.iso of=/dev/sdX\n\nNow wait a few minutes until the command completes. Make sure to properly unmount the disk:\nsudo umount /dev/sdX\n\nNow try out your USB drive with Ubuntu on it. :)\n", "Q: Google Chrome's icon after Ubuntu 14.10 lastest update I am getting the gray box with a question mark in the middle of the icon for chrome, before it would show the chrome icon but now it's this ugly icon, I did fix it with a sudo apt-get install --reinstall google-chrome-stable and the icon came back, but it goes back to the gray box icon after a reboot.\nIs there a permanent fix for this? \nEdit: seems installing Google Chrome Beta or Unstable fixes Google Chromes Stable's icon to  normal, will reboot after unstable installes\n \n\nA: Google Chrome is famous for producing local .desktop files (launchers) in ~/.local/share/applications. The downside is that these .desktop files are not updated when the application is updated. Appearantly the latest update makes earlier .desktop files incompatible.\nWhat to do\nNavigate to ~/.local/share/applications, find and delete all launchers, related to Google Chrome, log out and back in. It should be fixed then.\n\nA: Your chrome extensions can cause this problem. \nFor example, my extension \"Multiple Accounts for Outlook\" causes this problem if enable \"Shortcut On Apps Menu\" in extension settings.\n\nA: I would lurk around the install directory where Chromium is (probably somewhere is /usr/) and see if you find any .png, .bmp, or .jpg files (or just images in general).  You may be able to manually deny deletion to it like this:\nsudo chmod 644 [name]\nsudo chown root:root [name]\n\nThat should prevent deletion, unless for some reason it's deleting it as root.\n", "Q: blank desktop after installing Ubuntu 14.04 on Oracle virtual box I have been trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my oracle virtualbox, after installation, it brings forth a blank desktop without any programs or applications on it.

After typing in the password, it still shows blank desktop.\nAlso, I tried installing \"Virtualbox additional disk image\", but to no avail.\nPlease, what do I do to resolve these issues?\nThanks\n\nA: I am a several years long user of VirtualBox and have noticed this issue with the latest version of Kubuntu (15.04) and the latest version of VirtualBox (4.3.28). I can install Kubuntu just fine on the virtual machine, and get into the desktop, but once I run updates I begin getting the blank screen after login.\nI'm beginning to believe it is an issue with the latest Linux Kernel, since that is a part of the update package. Either the kernel is incompatible with VirtualBox, or something in Kubuntu.\n", "Q: Cannot access outlook.office365.com I must say I'm a new Ubuntu user. I'm using 14.04 LTS version. I always keep my Ubuntu updated. I've an office365 account and I already configured it in Thunderbird. It was working fine, so far. Today I've installed a new update and outlook.office365.com has become inaccessible. Neither Thunderbird not browsers (Chrome, Firefox) can access this host. I get timeout in both cases. If I try to look up it I get this:\n$ nslookup outlook.office365.com\n;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.\n;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\n\nIt's also timeout.

If I slide the pointer along the left edge, a gray fringe appears briefly, but no launcher panel.\nBut now that I am writing about it, and trying again, after a couple tries, the panel appears if I slide the pointer fast enough and also far enough. And now, once the panel shows, it does stay put until I move the pointer out of the launcher entirely. If I slide too slowly or to short a distance, at most I get the gray fringe described in the second paragraph.\nI now also tried to minimize all windows to see if I got the behavior I described in the first paragraph, but no, I still have the behavior of the third paragraph.\nThis is not the first time I experience this. It's been countless times before. Quite possibly it happens only when I have just logged in. Yet I have not found anyone else asking about this.\nThe behavior described in the first paragraph is annoying, how can I fix it?\n\nA: In System Settings select Appearance and then go to Behavior tab to modify the launcher auto-hide settings. Probably, what you want to adjust is the sensitivity option.\nA 3rd party application Unity Tweak Tool has even more options for launcher's settings.\nUnity Tweak Tool can be acquired via apt-get install unity-tweak-tool.

I think it should be something like this: \"#-*\"\n\nA: With rename, assuming that a . only appears at the end of the filename for the extension, you can use the following expression:\ns/-[^-]*\\././\n\nThis replaces a hyphen followed by characters other than a hyphen until a ., with ., effectively deleting the last hyphen and the characters following it. Use it thus:\nrename -n 's/-[^-]*\\././' *\n\nIf the changed names look fine, then run without -n.\n\nA: Instead of hacking with replacing pattern you can just tell youtube-dl not to include these random letters (that's a video id actually) to the final filename.

' .. is there a easier way to do it without using the terminal? I checked the User Accounts but my user is already an Administrator.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: \nis there a easier way to do it without using the terminal?\n\nYes. You change the destination to your own account. Let's say you have an external USB stick that is identified mounted in /media/ as usb1. By default this stick (when freshly formatted) is owned by user and group root. \nThe command \nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/usb1\n\nwill change all files on /media/usb1 to your user. This command needs to be issues 1 time (not every time you want to do something with that disk) and that enables you to use Nautilus with your user and lets you freely copy, move, delete files to, on, from that USB stick.\nIf you feel experienced enough it can be quicker to use Nautilus as root but you should avoid using Nautilus as root to do this. If you get used doing that you are more than likely to cripple your operating system: some files on the system have to be set to your user and changing them as root will set them to root. In /home/$USER/ you can find lots of these files where your login depends on them being owned by your user. Having said that: if you know what problems can arise from using root and you take care not to change those important files or make sure you know how to fix a problem due to this it can be quicker to use root. But changing the ownership of the destination should always be preferred.\nIf you want to move files to a place that can not be changed from root you will have to use sudo. Directories like /var/, /usr/ and so on you should avoid putting files into. It is best to do this from command line. For instance files needed for websites tend to go to /var/www/. Changing those files should be done as root where root makes a backup 1st and then copy the new files over the old ones and not directly in /var/www/ by a user to avoid altering a file with a bad version.\n\nA: Try running your file manager as root. I believe you right click on the background of your file manager and click open as root, if that doesnt work try that on a folder. If all else fails do sudo <replace with your file manager> or gksu <replace with your file manager> \n", "Q: fatal error: SDL/SDL.h: No such file or directory I am trying to practice lesson_1 at \nhttps://tutorialsplay.com/opengl/2014/04/23/textured-cube/\nWhen I run the code named cube.c I got\ncube.c:16:21: fatal error: SDL/SDL.h: No such file or directory\n #include <SDL/SDL.h>\n                     ^\n\ncompilation terminated.\n\nI've installed SDL2 with guidance at \nhttps://github.com/PluginIO/EX3/wiki/Setting-up-SDL2-in-Ubuntu-12.10\nI am using 14.04 though..\nThe installation of SDL2 was successful I did not get any error.\nThe SDL.h file is located in \"/usr/local/include/SDL2\"\nI tried to force to use fullpath linking by command \ngcc cube.c -lglut -lGL -lGLU -l/usr/local/include/SDL2\n\ninstead of \ngcc cube.c -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lSDL\n\nBut all were in vain...\nDoes anybody know solution for this linking problem?\nAs what muru pointed out I changed to captial i got \"error: unknown type name ‘SDL_keysym’\" meaning worked. \nOther way I discovered was \nI changed \n#include <SDL/SDL.h> \n\nto  \n#include <SDL2/SDL.h>\n\nNo longer shows \"fatal error: SDL/SDL.h: No such file or directory\"\nThus for now consider solved.\nHowever I am getting the following errors that will be posting on separate thread.\ncube.c:105:22: error: unknown type name ‘SDL_keysym’\n void handleKeyPress( SDL_keysym *keysym )\n                      ^\ncube.c: In function ‘main’:\ncube.c:239:5: error: unknown type name ‘SDL_VideoInfo’\n     const SDL_VideoInfo *videoInfo;\n     ^\n\nA.B.: I pasted output of your suggested commands below.\ngcc cube.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl`\nPackage sdl was not found in the pkg-config search path.\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `sdl.pc'\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\nNo package 'sdl' found\n\n\n\ngcc cube.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl2`\ncube.c:105:22: error: unknown type name ‘SDL_keysym’\n void handleKeyPress( SDL_keysym *keysym )\n                      ^\ncube.c: In function ‘main’:\ncube.c:239:5: error: unknown type name ‘SDL_VideoInfo’\n     const SDL_VideoInfo *videoInfo;\n     ^\nerrors continue....\n\n\nA: Probably you have already installed the libraries, I show the steps but again for the reason of completeness.\n\n\n*\n\n*SDL2\nsudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev\n\n\n*SDL1\nsudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev\n\nStart the compilation with:\n\n\n*\n\n*SDL2\ngcc cube.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl2`\n\n\n*SDL1\ngcc cube.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl`\n\n\nSample output:\n% pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl               \n-D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT -I/usr/include/SDL -lSDL\n\n% pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl2\n-D_REENTRANT -I/usr/include/SDL2 -lSDL2\n\n", "Q: How to boot into recovery mode on Ubuntu on chromebook When I set up Ubuntu on my HP Chromebook 14 again after breaking it, I forgot that the admin password had to be 4 digits and set it as 1 (the password was just 1) since I don't really need a password on it.

I have a SAMBA server where the only user is root. I want the user on the client system to be able to access the files on the remote server as root. So far I can't, even though I've used options like \"uid\", \"setuid\", etc. The client just sees the remote files as belonging to \"root\" and \"permission denied\" is all I get.\nThe server, which runs OpenELEC, shared with guest permissions, so the solution is unlikely to involve profound changes to the server. The client is running Ubuntu 14.04.02.\nThis is the samba.conf file, which I think overrides the smb.conf. I took it from a template and added only the last share:\n###############################################################################\n#      This file is part of OpenELEC - ...\n#      Copyright (C) 2009-2014 Stephan Raue (stephan@openelec.tv)\n#\n#  OpenELEC is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n#  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n#  the Free Software Foundation, either version 2 of the License, or\n#  (at your option) any later version.\n#\n#  OpenELEC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n#  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n#  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Likely, this is because it is in /run/user/1000/gvfs/\nTerrible, but it gets the job done.

I have already tried to change the server and other tips found on the web at no avail. \nFirstly I thought that was a problem with my ISP, but then I downloaded the DEB files for skype and chrome and both got downloaded at regular speed (340 KBps, I have a 3 mbps connection). All internet pages and services work correctly.\nAlso, when I was installing ubuntu, I ticked the option to install updates and 3rd party software, what a mistake, it took more than 4 hours for the installation to complete because I had to skip the installation of those files (the installer indicated that 105 minutes were remaining for the installation).\nA simple sudo apt-get update takes 20 minutes and the installation of scribus (20 mb download) took 26.\nAs I said before, I have already tried changing server, but the problem still persists in my two computers.\nAny Idea?\nBTW, one computer uses ubuntu 15.04 32 bits and the other 64 bits.\nThank you\n\nA: run the following commands to install apt-fast which uses aria2 as a download manager:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:saiarcot895/myppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install apt-fast\n\nthen, instead of using apt-get in the future, use: \nsudo apt-fast\n\ninstead.\nexample:\nsudo apt-fast upgrade\n\nor\nsudo apt-fast install packagename\n\nmore info: github.com/ilikenwf/apt-fast\nsee also: how-can-i-get-apt-to-use-a-mirror-close-to-me-or-choose-a-faster-mirror\n", "Q: nvcc fatal : Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_30' I am trying to setup vlfeat/matconvnet on my system.

I have an eMachines T5246 running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS set up as a home media server with Plex. \nEverything has been running well (if slowly) up until today when I installed the updates that showed up in the auto-update and restarted.\nWhen I next booted it up, the screen was completely blank until I moved the mouse, at which point the pointer appeared. I have rebooted several times, and a few times the login screen and wallpaper has appeared, and after logging in, the wallpaper disappeared when I clicked onscreen.\nI can boot to other devices. I booted to tails on a usb to see if I could access the files, but I don't remember the Admin password, so I couldn't access the files.\nI think that when I first installed ubuntu, the computer had some graphics driver issues, but I believe that was from ubuntu automatically using 3rd party drivers.\nWhat can I do?\nUPDATE 1: I have not been able to fix the problem, but I can access the terminal from the login screen using CTRL+ALT+F1\nUPDATE 2: I have tried booting using nomodeset, but I got the same screen and reaction when I booted up.\n\nA: If you have an Nvidia or AMD graphics card, or a laptop with Optimus or switchable/hybrid graphics, the issue may be the fact that it is does not have the proprietary drivers installed. If this matches your setup, check This out. Specifically, the section \n\"Black/purple screen after you boot Ubuntu for the first time\"\nThe answer is to boot (only need to one time) using the nomodeset option and then install the proprietary drivers. Once those are installed, you should have no more issues.\nSee the link for exact directions and screenshots. \n\nA: It's good that you can still get into the console, as you'll likely be able to fix your problem from there. I'd first look in the logs of your X server and examine what is going on. You can do this with:\ncat /var/log/Xorg.0.log\nThis will likely give you some message with an (EE) marker, which would tell you were the problem lies. It could be that the proprietary NVidia driver is at fault, and you could consider trying to see if it works without any proprietary drivers first (google for purging the nvidia packages). Make sure the open source nouveau drivers are installed and see if you can get a graphical login. If so, you could experiment from there on with different nvidia (proprietary) drivers or stick with the open source drivers.\n", "Q: FFmpeg use AAC encoder I am trying to do some video conversion with FFmpeg.

So I try:\nffmpeg -i 5.mp4 Parkford-05.mp4 -strict -2\n\nand get the same result.\nHow do I tell it to use the experimental encoder?\n\nA: Here is what you are looking for:\nffmpeg -i 5.mp4  -strict -2 Parkford-05.mp4\n\nor\nffmpeg -i 5.mp4  -strict experimental Parkford-05.mp4\n\ntrac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/AAC\nalso\ntrac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/AAC#NativeFFmpegAACencoder\n\nAdditionally, if the file is named \"5.mp4\" but is not actually an mp4 file, the use of the mp4 extension in the name can cause problems. However, it is not always necessary to provide a file extension; having no file extension does not usually cause problems. \nTry renaming the file \"5\" instead of \"5.mp4\" and see if that doesn't help.\n", "Q: How to install GreenAddress Bitcoin Wallet in Ubuntu?

And there are no options in any of the system setting menus for adding more virtual desktops.\nI've a lot of web searching about this - which is an error I've never seen before - but I'm not sure how to apply fixes to a virtual system.

It looks like it had rebooted during an update, and had left grub booting a kernel image (3.13.0-45-generic) that was unable to find my hard drives, and didn't have an entry for /dev/disk/by-uuid/.\nI solved the problem by booting from an older kernel, and then completing the upgrade. This gave me 3.13.0-53-generic, which seems to work better.\n1) Boot to the grub prompt, press 'e' to view the boot script for the current (broken) boot process. Take a photo of the screen.\n2) Press ESC, then 'c' to get to the GRUB command prompt.\n3) Check the contents of the boot directory on your root drive, to see what kernels you have available.

(Refer to your photo for the exact commands and the root UUID=... . Use tab-completion to get the spelling exactly right, and use the same version number for vmlinuz and initrd.img):\ngrub> set root='hd0,msdos3'\ngrub> linux /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-70-generic root=UUID=xxx[replace this]xx ro\ngrub> initrd /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-70-generic\ngrub> boot\n\n(It may take a few tries to get everything right.

So you won’t need any other change in Theano files or Theano configuration.\nBut i dont how to uninstall this ATLAS package. \nI tried\n sudo apt-get remove libatlas\n\nbut it didnt worked. Can you tell me how can i formally remove them.\nregards\n\nA: If you want to remove the ATLAS development packages, they are actually called libatlas-dev and libatlas-base-dev.\nHowever, there should be no need to uninstall these packages in order to use OpenBLAS: the update-alternatives mechanism will take care of things for you, automatically assigning higher priority to the OpenBLAS version of libblas when you install it e.g. with only the ATLAS development packages installed you should see\n$ update-alternatives --get-selections | grep libblas\nlibblas.so                     auto     /usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/libblas.so\nlibblas.so.3                   auto     /usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/libblas.so.3\n\nthen installing OpenBLAS development packages using\n$ sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev\n\nand checking again you should see\n$ update-alternatives --get-selections | grep libblas\nlibblas.so                     auto     /usr/lib/openblas-base/libblas.so\nlibblas.so.3                   auto     /usr/lib/openblas-base/libblas.so.3\n\nYou should be able to swap between them using sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so and following the on-screen instructions.\n", "Q: I keep getting the same GRUB error?

I've installed Nginx Mainline/Dev, PHP 5.6 from webupd8 repo and MariaDB 10.\nBut with Software Updates/PHP update, Apache is being installed also.\nHow can I prevent this?\nI just don't like apache and will use Nginx alone :).\nI installed them with this command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/development\nsudo apt-get install nginx\nsudo apt-get install php5 php5-fpm php5-mysql php5-gd\nsudo apt-get install mariadb-server\nsudo apt-get install phpmyadmin\n\n\nA: The problem is somewhat two-fold.\n\nThe first problem is that that you use the php5 package in your install.\nThat package is a metapackage - it pulls in other packages when you hit \"Install\".  The problem is it prefers the Apache plugins over php5-fpm and other processors, and causes Apache to install with everything else. (And this is not supposed to be the case, and I noticed this as a potential bug in the package and/or apt)\nUse the same commands but drop php5 from the install command.\nFirst, remove any packages you've marked for install (it'll 'unmark'):\napt-get remove nginx php5 php5-fpm php5-mysql php5-gd mariadb-server phpmyadmin\n\nThen reinstall them.\napt-get install nginx php5-fpm php5-mysql php5-gd mariadb-server phpmyadmin\n\n\nThe second problem is that the phpMyAdmin package has a similar recommendation on the Apache components.  I do not have the commands here but you'll need to override the installation options for apt to try and force it to NOT install the Apache packages.\n\nWorst comes to worst, however, if phpMyAdmin requires Apache (which means the package is made incorrectly) you should be using Apache in place of nginx.\n\nNOTE: As the PPA maintainer for the NGINX team, I recommend that you please use the stable PPA which has a newer version than the Mainline PPA at this time.  We are waiting for upstream changes (preferably a point release) in some third party modules before we can publish updates for the Mainline 1.9.x packaging to the PPA.  (1.8.x based on 1.7.x initially with additional updates is now the Stable release)\n", "Q: MAAS is failing to provision a node May 20 21:47:13 maas-poc maas.power: [INFO] Changed power state (on) of

I can still log in fine with the key provided by AWS. Is it forcing the security of my SSH connections to be downgraded? Has it been disabled on purpose because of security concerns?\nI've seen some people suggest that the key wasn't generated correctly during installation, and that I need to regenerate the key with dpkg-reconfigure or ssh-keygen.\nAlternatively, I've also seen people recommend just commenting out the line: HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key in /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nA: You can generate the missing hostkey via:\nssh-keygen -A\n\ned25519 is a bit faster and more secure. It's not necessary and, aside from logspam, this doesn't have that much effect. You could, indeed, comment out HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key, without much effect. But, at the same time, `ed25519 is a good host-key format to support.\n\nA: If you are running FIPS mode when you run ssh-keygen -A you will see an error like:\nED25519 keys are not allowed in FIPS mode\nSo the appropriate action on a FIPS server is to disable this HostKey type in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.\nComment out the line like this:\n# HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\nThen restart SSHD: service sshd restart\nNo more log spam.\n", "Q: After Permission & Ownership Changes system starts giving me errors All problems started when I changed ownership and permission with gksu nautilus from the ETC and SBIN folder.

Specific to Node.js, developers can choose from one or more of the currently supported releases and get regular automatic updates directly from NodeSource. Node.js versions 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 are currently available, with the Snap Store being updated within hours or minutes of a Node.js release.\nNode can be installed with a single command, for example:\nsudo snap install node --classic --channel 9/stable \n\nThe node snap can be accessed by the command node, for example:\n$ node -v  \nv9.9.0\nAn up-to-date version of npm will installed as part of the node snap. npm should be run outside of the node repl, in your normal shell. After installing the node snap run the following command to enable npm update checking:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/your-username/.config\nReplace  your-username in the above command with your own username. Then run npm -v to check if the version of npm is up-to-date. As an example I checked that npm was up-to-date, checked the version of an already installed package named yarn with the command npm list yarn and then updated the existing yarn package to the latest version with the command npm update yarn\nUsers can switch between versions of Node.js at any time without needing to involve additional tools like nvm (Node Version Manager), for example:\nsudo snap refresh node --channel=8/stable\n\nUsers can test bleeding-edge versions of Node.js that can be installed from the latest edge channel by switching with:\nsudo snap switch node --edge\n\nThis approach is only recommended for those users who are willing to participate in testing and bug reporting upstream.\n\nOriginal answer\nTo install the latest LTS versions of Node.js (nodejs) and Package manager for Node.js (npm) in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu, open the terminal and run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get remove nodejs npm ## remove existing nodejs and npm packages\nsudo apt-get install curl  \ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs  \n\nIf you are copying these three commands, don't neglect the hyphen at the end of the second command.\nThe nodejs package contains the nodejs binary as well as npm, so you don't need to install npm separately. However, in order for some npm packages to work (such as those that require building from source), you will need to install the build-essential package:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential  \n\nLTS Plan\nNew semver-major releases of Node.js are cut from master every six months. New even-numbered versions (e.g. v6, v8, v10, etc.) are cut in April. New odd-numbered versions (e.g. v5, v7, v9) are cut in October.\nWhen a new odd-numbered major release is cut, the previous even-numbered major version transitions to the Long Term Support plan.\nEvery major version covered by the LTS plan will be actively maintained for a period of 18 months from the date it enters LTS coverage.

Having a high DPI screen however (13.3\" with 1920x1080) I need to scale the entire system to use it. There is a setting for that in the TweakTool, but it only seems to accept integers as scaling factor.\n\nDoes anybody know about a workaround for this? Scaling by two is way too large for my screen. The value I want is closer to 1.2\nAny help will be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I checked with my Fedora 21 install where I have Gnome 3.14.2 and it doesn't seem to be possible to set your desired value:\n[btegge@za21 ~]$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor 1.2\ninvalid character in number:\n  1.2\n   ^\n[btegge@za21 ~]$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor 1,2\nexpected end of input:\n  1,2\n   ^\n\nMy assumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a another setting to achieve what you want. The only thing that comes to my mind is font rendering related, though that is not exactly what you are looking for.\n\n*It's a mistake that the key only accepts integers as datatype and you should file a bug.\n\n\nA: I am not sure if this got resolved or not, but there are two scaling options in Gnome to achieve this. The \"window scaling\" attribute that you are doing either accepts 1 or 2 (or 0, but this is \"undefined\" I think). If you want, you can do text scaling, which accepts floating numbers.\nIn Gnome Tweak Tool, this is available under the font section. Alternatively, you can access both in the dconf-editor under org.gnome.desktop.interface I have noticed this option tends to work better, as Gnome Tweak Tool can sometimes not update setting correctly, causing weird scaling issues.\n\nA: Fractional scaling is not officially supported on versions lower than 3.32 and not supported at all inside GNOME in versions lower than 3.28.\nYou can neverthless obtain the same effect on 3.16 with xrandr.\n\nA: You can do it if you switch to the Wayland display server:\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/09/enable-fractional-scaling-gnome-linux\nOtherwise, your only option would seem to be to upgrade to a version of the distro with a newer version of GNOME. This functionality is available in Ubuntu 19.04:\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/06/enable-fractional-scaling-ubuntu-19-04\n\nA: Non-integer scaling is not (yet) supported in Gnome and therefore Ubuntu. Athough, it is possible to achieve with some workarounds using xrandr, which involves an upscaling and a subsequent downscaling, I cannot recommend this as it is very CPU/GPU intensive and comes with other quirks and problems and does not necessarily lead to the desired result. There are a lot of ongoing debates and argues on r/linux over at reddit if you are interested and here is also an article from one of the elementary devs (a distro based on Ubuntu) who talks a bit more about High DPI in depth: link.

There’s a new problem with SSL called “Logjam” appears yesterday to public.\nHow could it affect Ubuntu?\nAnd how to protect Ubuntu against it?\n\nA: Update your browser when you can. Here you can check if your browser is affected: https://weakdh.org/\nGoogle is aware of this and is working on a fix for their browsers. For firefox there is a notice on their forums.  From both you can expect updates fairly quickly. \nRegarding this bug:\n\nThe attack allows a man-in-the-middle to downgrade security of connections to a lower level of encryption — 512 bit — which can be read and attacked with relative ease.\n\nIf you do use encryption yourself use something better than 512 bits. If the encryption is done with a browser (https) you will need to wait for the maintainer of that browser to create a new release. \nThe website above also has a couple of pointers.

It came with username \"user\". So I wanted to change the username as well as the name of my home directory. \nSo I followed the instructions on https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Change_username to do it.

Logged in as that user and did:\nusermod -l newname oldname\nusermod -d /my/new/home username\n\nWhen I logged out and tried to login as the original user, my desktop has been stuck for a day. I've tried hard rebooting it several times, but to no avail. \nI am not sure what is going on. Can you please help me to fix it?\n\nA: Ok, so considering what you have now here's what I would do:\n# adduser \"your-new-username\"\n# mv /home/user /home/\"your-new-username\"\n# chown \"your-new-username\":\"your-new-username\" /home/\"your-new-username\" -R\n\nReboot, and try to login again.\n\nA: From what you have posted, you seem to be missing the last detail:\n# usermod -m -d /my/new/home username\nThis will move the data from your old home to the new home (and create the new dir, if it doesn't exist already). \nThe last command you issued probably did not create a new directory in the filsesystem with your username.

If you convert to a GPT format, you can have larger partitions. \nThe good news is that you don't have to reformat/restore your drive to convert your drive from MBR to GPT. There is a tool called gdisk which can handle the conversion for you. \nsgdisk is a non-interactive version of gdisk, and you can check whether the conversion is possible by first running sgisk -p /dev/sda (assuming sda is the device you want to resize). Then you can run the MBR -> GPT conversion by running sgdisk -g /dev/sda. See the above link for the sgdisk docs.\nBackups are highly recommended, just in case.\n\nA: The problem is your partition table, not ext4.  You'll need to backup, format, and restore to convert from MBR to GPT.  Booting from GPT requires either an EFI system partition ( if your motherboard supports UEFI ) or a 1 mb bios_grub partition.  After that, resizing in the future is done easily with gparted.\n", "Q: unlock kwallet at login before plasma 5 I had my kwallet unlocked at login and it worked well (same password for kwallet as for my session).\nNow, with plasma 5, it does not work anymore, I think I'm not far from working this out, but I don't know what to do next.\nHere is my setup, in ~/.config/plasma-workspace/env/ssh-agent.sh :\n#!/bin/bash\nexport SSH_ASKPASS=/usr/bin/ksshaskpass\neval $(ssh-agent)\n/usr/bin/ssh-add ~/.ssh/servers ~/.ssh/gitolite\n\nNote that I load 2 keys whith ssh-add.

These files can be used to run commands, applications etc. \nThe most basic version of a .desktopfile:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Some Name\nExec=<command> \nType=Application\n\nIn your case, you want to run a series of commands, using sudo. In that case you need:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Some Name\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"command1&&command2&&command3\"\nType=Application\nTerminal=true\n\nYou need to save the file with the extension .desktop, e.g. run_commands.desktop. To use these files from the desktop, make it executable.\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*To use complicated commands in a .desktopfile, the Exec= line should look like:\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"command1&&command2&&command3\"\n\n\n*to chain commands in a .desktop file, as if each command would be on a new line in a script, you have to use && between the commands.\n\n*If you use sudo in a command, you need to either set:\nTerminal=true\n\nso the commands will run in the terminal and ask you for the password, or you need to use gksu instead of sudo, so gksuwill ask you for your password. In that case, you would have to install gksu, which is not by default on your system:\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\nIf the command is too complicated or too long to handle in a .desktop file\nIf your series of commands is too long to handle in a .desktop file, write them in a small script, like you did, and call the script from the .desktop file. The Exec= line in the .desktop file should then look like:\nExec=/bin/sh mobi_mani.sh\n\n\nEDIT if you need to run commands in the terminal\nYou can also use the following to run commands from the terminal: \nSet in the .desktopfile as Exec= line:\nExec=gnome-terminal -x /bin/bash -c \"<command1>&&<command2>&&<command3>\"\n\nThen, assuming you use gnome-terminal, go to Preferences (gnome-terminal) > Profile Preferences > Title & Command, then from the dropdown list \"When command it finished\" > keep terminal open:\n\nThis practically cannot fail.\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't appear on network discovery when connected over Ethernet I am trying and failing to establish a wired network between a PC running Windows 8.1 and another running Ubuntu 14.04.

That means you'll always have the latest and\n  greatest applications that the open source world has to offer. Ubuntu\n  is designed with security in mind. You get free security updates for\n  at least 9 months on the desktop and server.\nA new LTS version is released every 2 years. In previous releases, a\n  Long Term Support (LTS) version had 3 years support on Ubuntu\n  (Desktop) and 5 years on Ubuntu Server. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04\n  LTS, both versions will receive 5 years support. There is no extra fee\n  for the LTS version; we make our very best work available to everyone\n  on the same free terms. Upgrades to new versions of Ubuntu are and\n  always will be free of charge.\n\nUbuntu 12.04 and 14.04 are LTS which means it will still have support for 5 years, while others not LTS have support for 9 months only.\n\nThis is the main reason for choosing LTS distros.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases\nRead this for more information about.\nsupport means:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updates for potential security problems and bugs\n\n*Commercial support from Canonical\n\n*Landscape support\n\n\nNow what should you use?\nThis depends to your needs. If you want a stable supported version you should use LTS and here 14.04 is preferred if you want new version packages. But If you are looking for trying some new concepts and be up to date with the newest versions you can use non LTS normal versions which is now 15.04 the latest version. \n", "Q: Ubuntu very slow startup My new laptop is taking very long (a few minutes) until it reaches the log-in screen.\nHere is the output of dmesg: http://pastebin.com/MuW79kVd \nI think the important part is the following gap in the time:\n[    6.861250] input: HDA Intel PCH Mic as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/sound/card1/input20\n[    6.861304] input: HDA Intel PCH Line as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/sound/card1/input21\n[    6.861346] input: HDA Intel PCH Dock Line Out as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/sound/card1/input22\n[    6.861391] input: HDA Intel PCH Headphone as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/sound/card1/input23\n[   66.332039] usb 1-9: USB disconnect, device number 2\n[   67.830294] usb 1-9: new low-speed USB device number 5 using xhci_hcd\n[   67.962114] usb 1-9: New USB device found, idVendor=03f0, idProduct=1041\n[   67.962117] usb 1-9: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0\n\nIt is an HP Probook 640 laptop.

Thanks in advance. \n\nA: This Answer is rather a Wiki that Is meant to be read and understood first before attempting to use either Preload or Prelink.\nWe need to first understand how Applications launch under Linux, I will not comment on Windows. Linux is secure by design, So what do we really mean by that?\nApplication launch Process\nLinux programs typically consist of a binary executable file that refers to multiple shared libraries. These libraries are loaded into memory once and shared by multiple executables. In order to make that happen, the dynamic linker (i.e. ld.so) needs to change the binary in memory such that any addresses of library objects point to the right place in memory. For applications with many shared libraries—GUI programs for example—that process can take some time. For most small programs this dynamic linking is very quick. But when bigger programs are launched it could take time. I mean considerable time.\nLinux uses ASLR to randomize the addresses in memory. One of the ideas behind address space layout randomization (ASLR) is to randomize these locations each time a program is run—or library loaded—so that malicious programs cannot easily and reproducibly predict addresses\nLet us understand With Context what preloading is and what prelinknig is and how they help reduce application launch times.\nFirst lets take a look at Preloading.\nPreloading is the action of putting and keeping target files into the RAM. The benefit is that preloaded applications start more quickly because reading from the RAM is always quicker than from the hard drive. However, part of your RAM will be dedicated to this task, but no more than if you kept the application open. Therefore preloading is best used with large and often-used applications like Firefox and LibreOffice.\nPreload is an adaptive, pre-read demon. It observes the applications Starts over a period of time. Understands the application launch behaviour. It collects the information and based on the information starts to preload the libraries required by the programs into the device RAM. Hence over a period of time the Application launch times reduce considerably and applications launch faster.\nSince Preload requires memory to store the program code, the system should in any case have more than 1GB of memory.\nThe increase in speed can be up to 55%. However, this is not detected right after installation. Preload requires a few days or a week or two until a reliable statistic is created. This statistic uses Preload to load the code of the corresponding programs in the memory.\nNow Lets look at Prelinking\nOn most systems, libraries are not changed very often and when a program is run, the operations taken to link the program are the same every time. Prelink takes advantage of this by carrying out the linking and storing it in the executable, in effect prelinking it.\nIdealy it nullifies the Randomization of the Addreses which means it is easy to predcit where the libraries are stored hence it results in quick access to the libraries. This in turn reduces the launch time considerably.\nThe idea behind pre-linking is fairly simple: reduce the amount of time the dynamic linker needs to spend doing these address relocations by doing it in advance and storing the results. The prelink program processes ELF binaries and shared libraries in much the same way that ld.so would, and then adds special ELF sections to the files describing the relocations. When ld.so loads a pre-linked binary or library, it checks these sections and, if the libraries are loaded at the expected location and the library hasn't changed, it can do its job much more quickly.\nWhich means that on a System which does not change much. Libraries stay the same for a long time, something like an Ubuntu LTS/RHEL/CentOS/Debian basically fixed release distros, Prelink will run better and provide great results.\nThere is only One Caviat.\nPrelinking needs to be Scheduled, It needs to run after the Libraries/programs have been upgraded since the libraries are changing. One could achieve that using a simple Cron job or could run it manually once in a while.\nSo We could techinically combine Preload and Prelink. However prelink is still like a Hack but your mileage may vary. I would give it a shot anyways. If I was on something like Debian or CentOS I would definitely use Preload and Prelink Both.\nReferences for more Information.\nhttp://sysmagazine.com/posts/108454/\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Preload\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Prelink\nhttp://lwn.net/Articles/341244/\nhttps://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Prelink\n\nA: One simple advice is to disable less important add-ons.

I want to know if I can pass an argument with an alias command.\nfor example:\nalias d=\"dmesg | grep -iw usb | tail -5\" \n\nNow d will print the last 5 lines. If I want to use d to print a different number of lines, I have to make change in the alias command declaration of d again.\nIs there any way I can modify the declaration of an alias so that I don't have to retype the declaration to change the number of lines. Like incorporating passing the number of lines as an argument while declaring alias for d? Or is there some other method to solve this?\n\nA: Working around alias limitations with group command and here-string\nAliases can't take arguments, but we can \"simulate\" that. Take for instance example of my answer on this question.\nalias mkcd='{ IFS= read -r d && mkdir \"$d\" && cd \"$d\"; } <<<'\n\nKey points that are happening here:\n\n\n*\n\n*we use read built in to read a string into a variable d. Because we want to read a full string including blank characters(newline's,tabs,spaces), we use IFS= and disable back backslash escapes with -r.\n\n*<<< which is here-string operator allows us to redirect whatever string we provide as argument to mkcd alias; the usage would be as mkcd \"some directory\"\n\n*multiple commands within alias are combined and executed in current shell using { list; } structure (which is known as group command in the bash manual). Note that leading space after { and ; individual list of commands are required.\n\n\nIn your specific example we could do:\nalias d='{ IFS= read -r n; dmesg | grep -iw \"usb\" | tail -n ${n:-5};} <<<'\n\nWe could also make use of word splitting to store space-separated arguments:\nbash-4.3$ { read -r a1 a2; echo \"$a1\"; echo \"$a2\";}  <<< \"arg1 arg2\"\narg1\narg2\n\nOr we could use arrays to provide multiple arguments:\nbash-4.3$ { read -a arr; echo \"${arr[1]}\"; echo \"${arr[0]}\";}  <<< \"arg1 arg2\"\narg2\narg1\n\nBut is this good approach ?\nNot necessarily. The problem with such approach is that it's very specific - arguments can't be quoted easily which means we can only have arguments with no spaces.\nbash-4.3$ { read -r a1 a2; echo \"$a1\"; echo \"$a2\";}  <<< \"'arg1 with space' arg2\"\n'arg1\nwith space' arg2\n\nThis is of course not something that would be widely used, simply because in the real world we have to deal with complex arguments, so this approach isn't quite practical. Functions are far more flexible. And the need to quote args string becomes annoying  fast.\nDespite the limitations, this works with simple strings as arguments where we can afford word splitting, thus partially allows us to give arguments to aliases. \n\nA: Aliases don't take arguments. With an alias like alias foo='bar $1', the $1 will be expanded by the shell to the shell's first argument (which is likely nothing) when the alias is run.\nSo: Use functions, instead.\nd () {\n  num=${1:-5}\n  dmesg |grep -iw usb|tail -$num\n}\n\nnum=${1:-5} uses the first argument, with a default value of 5 if it isn't provided.\nThen you can do:\n$ d\n# prints 5 lines\n$ d 10\n# prints 10 lines\n\n\nOr, if you change the options you used slightly:\nalias d=\"dmesg|grep -iw usb|tail -n 5\"\n\nThen you can pass additional -n options:\n$ d\n# prints 5 lines\n$ d -n 10\n# prints 10 lines\n\nIf multiple -n options are specified for tail, only the last is used.\n\nA: You need to have a function for this as described in the SO and here. Try the following:\nfoo() { /path/to/command \"$@\" ;}\n\nand call the foo with:\nfoo arg1 arg2 arg3\n\n\nA: In this particular case, where the parameters are at the end you don't need a function, just:\nalias d=\"dmesg | grep -iw usb | tail -n \" \n\nThen run for eg. d 2 and you'll get just two lines. The drawback is that there is no default value. To insert the parameter(s) in between I would follow this answer.\nBTW, you can use journalctl parameters like --dmesg, -k -p err, etc.\n", "Q: when using pulseaudio, internal sink not selectable using unity-control-center/sound, there is only a selection for the HDMI audio output, not for the internal sound.  the internal sound has jacks on the back of the mother board.

My Ubuntu environment is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Perl 5.18.2. \nThe first line of my scripts is #!/usr/bin/perl, which should invoke the perl interpreter in /usr/bin, and indeed, there is a 10.2 Kb object living there. However, my scripts won't run unless 'perl' is the first command line argument on Terminal, as in perl myscript.pl.\nIs there a way to have perl automatically running .pl scripts without invoking it explicitly? \n\nA: In order to solve this you can use #!/usr/bin/env perl as the hash-bang line, instead of #!/usr/bin/perl so that bash use the first Perl found in your PATH.\nQuoted from http://perlmaven.com/hashbang\n\nWhile we used #!/usr/bin/perl as our hash-bang line there can be other as well. For example if we have installed another version of perl in a different location and we would like our scripts to use that, then we can put the path to that version of perl. For example #!/opt/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl.\nThe advantage of setting a hash-bang (and turning on the executable\n  bit) is that user does not have to know the script is written in Perl\n  and if you have multiple instances of Perl on your system the\n  hash-bang line can be used to pick which perl to be used. This will be\n  the same for all the people on the specific machine. The drawback is\n  that the perl listed in the hash-bang line is only used if the script\n  is executed as ./hello.pl or as hello.pl. If it is executed as perl\n  hello.pl it will use the version of perl that is found first in the\n  directories listed in PATH. Which might be a different version of perl\n  from the one in the hash-bang line.\n\n\nA: Taking a different guess: Does your script have executable permissions?\nls -l should list permissions like rwxrwxr-x in order to run the file as a script. You can modify the permissions in your GUI (right-click → Properties, and depending on your file manager program, usually something like a Permissions tab with a setting like Execute: □ Allow executing file as a program) or from a text shell with chmod; eg, chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx my_script.pl to set \"the user owning the file can read, write, and execute it; members of the group owning it can do the same; others can read or execute (but not write) it\"\n\nA: I'm going to take a guess and postulate that your files (developed in Windows) are in DOS (CRLF) format.\nThat will interfere with the shebang, failing with not-so-clear messages:\n$ ./my_script.pl\n: No such file or directory\n\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3569997/view-line-endings-in-a-text-file on how to verify your line endings.\nFor example:\nbash-4.1$ cat -v my_script.pl\n#!/usr/bin/env perl^M\n^M\nprint \"Hello World\\n\";^M\n^M\n\nThen there are different tools (e.g. dos2unix or fromdos) that will help you to convert your text files to proper unix line-ending.\nAfter conversion:\n$ cat -v my_script.pl\n#!/usr/bin/env perl\n\nprint \"Hello World\\n\";\n\nAnd you will be able to execute them:\n$ chmod 755 my_script.pl\n$ ./my_script.pl\nHello World\n\n\nA: Thank you, all, I found a working solution.\nI use only one version of perl. I use a default perl installation on a default Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installation, with defaults tools bash and gedit.\nUsing bare 'myscript.pl' on the cmd line I got weird 'no such file','command not found' or 'cannot execute binary file...' messages.\nUsing chmod u=x, I changed the x bit. Script still doesn't run.\nThen, using gedit, I saved the UTF-8 file with Unix LF instead of DOS CR/LF.\nStill wouldn't run.\nThen, using './myscript.pl', bingo! it finally runs with !#/usr/bin/perl.\nConclusion : Linux users coming from Windows have to learn some Unix...\nMy script now runs on both Linux and Windows and correctly prints and sorts accented character filenames and messages provided it is saved in the correct default format, UTF-8 with Unix LF for Linux, or ISO-8849-1 or ANSI with CR/LF for Windows.\nIf anybody would like to have more info, I can post a barebone test version doing exactly that.  \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 14.04 on Dell Inspiron 5548 I recently purchased Dell Inspiron 5548 with a pre-installed Windows 8 OEM on a HDD 1TB with Single Partition.

I want the changes to be permanent \nI use Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 with GNOME 3.16.\n\nA: The initial name is usually set by the (code within) the application itself. You can however change it, e.g. by using xdotool, which you would have to install first:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nThen, once it is installed, you can set another window name by (e.g.) the command:\nxdotool search --name \"Unity LauncherSwitcher\" set_window --name \"Monkey\"\n\nThis will change:\n\ninto:\n\nNote\nAs you can see, the command exists of:\nxdotool search --name \"<current_name>\" set_window --name \"<new_name>\"\n\nThe <current_name> has to match exactly.\n\nEdit alternatively\nFrom your comment, I understand the command above did not work.

If a window appears that belongs to one of the applications, definied in the file, it sets the window name accordingly.\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses both wmctrl and xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file save it as setwindowname.py\n\n*Create the file ~/window_names.txt (exactly named window_names.txt), add your applications in the format:\n<application> <window_name>\n\ne.g.\ngedit Text editor\n\nThe window name may include spaces.\n\n*Test-run the script from the terminal by the command:\npython3 /path/to/setwindowname.py\n\n\n*If all works as expected, add it to startup applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add\nNote that in some cases, a script might break if it starts when the desktop is not fully loaded yet. If that migh be the case, the command to add to startup applications would be:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15&&python3 /path/to/setwindowname.py\"\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport os\n\nf = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/\"+\"window_names.txt\"\n\nchange = []\nlines = open(f).read().splitlines()\nfor l in lines:\n    try:\n        change.append([l.split()[0], (\" \").join(l.split()[1:])])\n    except IndexError:\n        pass\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\ncurr_1 = []\n\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        curr_2 = get([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"]).splitlines()\n        new = [w for w in curr_2 if not w in curr_1]\n        for item in new:\n            line = item.split(); pid = line[2]\n            procs = get([\"ps\", \"-e\"]).splitlines()\n            match = [l for l in procs if pid in l][0]\n            for app in [app for app in change if app[0] in match]:\n                subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"set_window\", \"--name\", app[1], line[0]])\n        curr_1 = curr_2\n        time.sleep(0.3)\n    except:\n        pass\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*If the file ~/window_names.txt is edited, the script needs to be restarted.\n\n*It works no matter how an application is started; it also works when applications are run from the terminal / and or with sudo.\n\n*It does not interefere with the the right-click option of any application.\n\n*The script also \"maintains\" the window name; if another process changes the window name afterwards (opening tabs, change directories e.g.) the script sees the window as a \"new window\" and maintains the window name of your choice.\n\n\nA: Just use the translation file!\nI ran into this very problem challenge with Thunar: It became annoying when Compiz Scale displayed the Thunar window title as \"AnyFolder - File Manager\" and comsumed space with unnecessary information.\nI tried the above mentioned ways with xdotool and wmctrl but they were not permanent since Thunar changes its window title every time I go to another folder. And it felt exaggerated to have a script sitting around in the background to change the title back every time Thunar alters it.\nAn easier solution was to use the translation file which comes with every application. You simply need to re-compile the translation source file with a tool called msgfmt included in the gettext package. I just did this for gThumb -just for fun- and there it works, too.\n1. Get source code for the concerned application.Type\n$ sudo apt-get source APPLICATION or head over to http://packages.ubuntu.com, get the source and look for for a folder called po: it contains plain-text language files. Look for your language. Let's say you're from Brazil, that file would be pt_BR.po\n2. Alter the file to your needs\nLook for the exact! window title that you want to get rid off or change.\nIn Thunar's case it was \"File Manager\" and in pt_BR.po I found\n:. set window title\n: ../thunar/thunar-window.c:3154 ../Thunar.desktop.in.in.h:3\n: ../thunar/thunar-settings.desktop.in.h:1\nmsgid \"File Manager\"\nmsgstr \"Gerenciador de arquivos\"\nwhere msgid is the signal the application sends and msgstr what the langpack translates it to.\nChange msgstr to whatever you like, i.e. msgstr \"o_-\".\nI learned that if you leave the translation empty like this msgstr \"\" the application will fall back to msgid. If you want it to be \"empty\" use whitespace. Or a dot. Or any funky ASCII symbol.\n\n3. Get the compiler\nAs mentioned you need msgfmt from gettext package, so you need to type\n$ sudo apt-get install gettext\n4. Compile\nOpen a terminal, go to the folder with your altered pt_BR.po and let msgfmt check the file for errors:\n$ msgfmt --check --check-accelerators=_ -o /dev/null pt_BR.po\nIf it's fine, go ahead and compile it:\n$ msgfmt -c -o pt_BR.mo pt_BR.po\n5. Place file\nHave a look how the original translation in /usr/share/locale/YOUR_LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/  or /usr/share/locale-langpack/YOUR_LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/ is named and place your file there. If it doesn't exist in both places, put it in one of them and experiment a little with the file name: lowercase, Camelcase or something like , i.e. gthumb.mo or YOUR-APP.mo.\nMake a backup of the original first:\n$ sudo cp /usr/share/locale/YOUR_LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/YOUR-APP.mo /usr/share/locale/YOUR_LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/YOUR-APP.mo.BAK\nthen copy your new translation there\n$ sudo cp pt_BR.mo /usr/share/locale/YOUR_LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/YOUR-APP.mo\nIf YOUR_APP is running, close all instances of it.\nTest It!\nHint\nIf you're running Ubuntu with EN localisation like I am, just use any *.po, delete or comment all unchanged msgid/msgstr couples from it and put it in /usr/share/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/.\nSources:\nhttp://wiki.xfce.org/translations/translation_guidance_in_xfce\n\nA: The title is generated by the application executable and there isn't a easy way to edit it.\n\nChanging the title of a application once it's open:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xdotool with sudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n*Get the pid of the application with pgrep myapp (i.e. pgrep rythmbox)\n\n*Change the window title (replacing HERE_THE_PID with the process id of the application):\nxdotool search --onlyvisible --pid HERE_THE_PID --name \"\\a\\b\\c\" set_window --name \"$new_name\"\n\nMaking a script to launch any application with a custom title:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bash script called change-title with these contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n## The new name of the window is the first argument passed to the script:\nnew_name=\"${1}\"\n\n## application is all arguments but the first (the title)\napplication=${@:2}\n\n## Run the app in background and in quiet mode:\n$application &> /dev/null &\n\n## Get the pid of the app:\napp_pid=$!\n\n## Wait until the window appears:\nuntil xdotool search --onlyvisible --pid $app_pid &> /dev/null; do sleep 0.01; done\n\n## Change the window name:\nxdotool \\\n         search \\\n                --onlyvisible \\\n                --pid $app_pid \\\n                --name \"\\a\\b\\c\" \\\n         set_window \\\n                --name \"$new_name\"\n\n## Comment this line to run the app in background:\nwait $app_pid\n\n\n*Make it executable with chmod a+x change-title\n\n*Run it with ./change-title \"NewTitle\" theapp --its-arguments\nTo make the change permanent:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run gksudo gedit /usr/local/bin/custom-title (fx. user/local/bin/music)\n\n*On the text editor paste the above script and save it.\n\n*Run sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/custom-title\n\n*Run gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/rhythmbox.desktop\n\n*On this file, there is a line (the line number is 35 on mine) that says:\nExec=rhythmbox %U\n\n\n*Replace it with this with the name of the created file:\nExec=custom title (fx.

The only way is resets itself is when you refresh your session with ALT+F2+R.\n\n\n*\n\n*And you should have the bash script in /usr/local/bin ofcourse.\n\n\nFinal notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I'm using --name \"\\a\\b\\c\" is to fix a bug, don't replace with the application name!\n\n*If do you uncomment the last line of the script, the script will not end until the app is closed.\n\n*Explaination of ${@:2} in the code requested by @Maud Kon:\n\n\n*\n\n*$@ is an array that stores all the positional parameters.\n\n*${@:2} means: All the positional parameters but the first\n\n*Let's say that I call a program this way:\nawesome-program foo bar baz fooz\n\n\n\n*\n\n*${@:1} would be foo bar baz fooz\n\n*${@:2} would be bar baz fooz\n\n*${@:3} would be baz fooz\n\n*${@:4} would be fooz\n\n*${@:5} is empty because there aren't more positional parameters.\n\n\n*$@, ${@} and ${@:1} are the same thing: All the positional parameters.  \n\n*Learn more about this topic here: http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/posparams\n\nA: Replace (parts of) window titles with wmctrl\nSince my own answer using the application's translation file wasn't sufficient for several cases for me, I built upon Jacob Vlijm's solution and modified his script to replace certain strings in window titles.

So last night I tried Ubuntu for the first time (kinda), and as I was getting the hang of it I noticed an option to update my OS to version 12.04, so I said \"Why not? Let's start with something fresh and new\"... Bad choice. As soon as the process was over and I restarted my netbook (I first had some problems booting it up), the desktop appeared and I was like, what?\nSome parts of the taskbar were black, the resolution was way too low (even for a NETBOOK) and I couldn't even find the start-like button to show all of the apps. Pretty good for a first time, huh?\nI apologize if I don't add much information or a picture, I don't even know what version I had before I updated! I guess it's a matter of time until I learn the basics of this OS.\nIf someone could help me to revert this (maybe getting back to the previous version) I would truly appreciate it. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: *\n\n*Any Ubuntu version earlier than 12.04 has reached End of Life, so you can't revert back to it. You have no reasonable alternative except for backing up your personal files and reinstalling a currently suported operating system.  \n\n*The minimal systems requirements have increased a lot since Ubuntu 12.04, so you may not be able to install the latest version of Ubuntu because of the minimal hardware requirements. Assuming that your netbook has at least 1 GB RAM, you could install Ubuntu on it, but your performance would be very slow, so you are better off choosing a more lightweight *buntu edition, and if your netbook has less than 4 GB RAM choose the 32-bit version. Check your hardware against the systems requirements here: How do I find out which version and derivative of Ubuntu is right for my hardware in terms of minimal system requirements?.  \n\n*Whatever version of Ubuntu you choose you have an additional choice of the regular release or the Long Term Support (LTS) release. The regular release is supported by updates for only 9 months after it is released. The LTS release is supported for either 5 years in the case of Ubuntu or 3 years in the case of other LTS *buntu editions. The latest LTS release is 14.04.  \n\n*The classic GNOME 2 desktop has been updated to GNOME 3 and is no longer available. If you want a lightweight desktop environment that is similar to GNOME 2, it has been replaced by the MATE desktop environment in Ubuntu MATE. Ubuntu MATE does not yet have an officially supported LTS release, only a regular release.

Static linking doesn't work either (as expected).\n\nEdit: ldd myprogram yielded:\n    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffccabf4000)\n    libgfortran.so.3 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgfortran.so.3 (0x00007f149b334000)\n    libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007f149b038000)\n    libgomp.so.1 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1 (0x00007f149ae15000)\n    libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f149abfe000)\n    libquadmath.so.0 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libquadmath.so.0 (0x00007f149a9bf000)\n    libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f149a7a1000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f149a3e3000)\n    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f149b67d000)\n    librt.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 (0x00007f149a1db000)\n    libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f1499fd6000)\n\nSo I copied the 10 files /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2, /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1, /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 etc. to the foreign system. According to what I've found, it seems to be OK not to care about linux-vdso.so.1 as it's generated automatically inside the kernel.\n\nA: On Linux the dynamic linker does not by default look in current directory.\nIf you indeed include all needed libraries in current directory, it should work:\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./myprogram\n\nIf you do not provide all necessary libraries, it might complain or just crash (due to binary incompatibilities that the linker cannot detect only comparing library version numbers).\nReference: man ld.so\n\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for ELF libraries at execution-time.  Similar to the PATH environment\n  variable.  Ignored in set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.\n\n\nA: Thanks to this answer of Julien, I added to the linker the options -L. -Wl,-rpath='$ORIGIN'. The -L tells the linker to look for the shared libraries in the directory where you compile. The second option is more important in that now at runtime, the shared libraries in the original directory where the executable is, will be taken. So if I do now ldd /home/on/foreign/machine/myprogram on the foreign machine, I get e.g.\nlibgfortran.so.3 => /home/on/foreign/machine/libgfortran.so.3\n\nBut there is one library left whose entry does not change: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2. This is an alias for ld.so @Stéphane pointed at. Now from what he taught me, I concluded to try with the ld-linux-x86-65.so.2-file from my own machine on the other one:\nme@foreign:/home/on/foreign/machine> ./ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ./myprogram\n\nAnd it finally worked on the foreign machine. Note that I did not change LD_LIBRARY_PATH. \nHowever, I think this works because only the kernel versions (not architecture) are different between both machines.\n\nA: On Linux, there's a big effort for binary compatibility at kernel level, not so much at library level.\nWhat I did several times and worked perfectly is to make on a development machine a chroot with the target machine environment, including compiler. \n(One can replace chroot with virtual machine or any type of container.)\nThe binaries you'll make from that kind of environment will always fit perfectly the target machine.\nThe pros/cons are: \n\n\n*\n\n*chroot or container con: need some efforts (especially the first time) -- chroot is more traditional Unix. schroot might help to tune and use the chroot..\n\n*chroot or container pro: lightweight on resources (especially chroot)\n\n*chroot or container pro: somehow easier to make scripted (with schroot especially or a sudo configuration).\n\n*virtual machines pro: easier for beginners (e.g VirtualBox).\n\n*virtual machines con: somewhat heavyweight on disk usage and CPU\n\n*virtual machines con: generally needs graphical access (a user advanced enough to prefer shell access via SSH might be savvy enough to prefer a container or chroot).\n\n\nIn any case, chroot/container/VM can be kept and reused many times.\n", "Q: Certain commands not working for a user with sudo after adding to `sudoers` file I cannot seem to allow the user (In this case Ruby) to run sudo rm -rf, sudo rmdir, or sudo mkdir.

I recently had to replace the laptop that I was using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with a new laptop.  It is an HP laptop with the NVIDIA Quadro K1100M on a 32 bit OS.  It took me much tweaking to get it to work properly, but I was able to do it with installing the proper drivers and modules.  The problem is that each time I get a Linux Kernel update, it causes a problem that I believe is related to XServer and the NVIDIA graphics card.  I installed the closed source drivers from NVIDIA, and ran the Xserver config tool from NVIDIA (/usr/bin/nvidia-xconfig).  That seemed to work with the original install, and the first update that I received.  With the last linux image update (linux-image-3.16.0-38-generic), it once again crashed my system.  I am forced to use the grub menu to boot the previous version, as I cannot seem to fix it this time.\nWhat can I do to prevent future kernel updates from causing this problem?  I had previously tried making the xorg.conf file immutable, thinking if I prevented the configuration from being overwritten it would stop this from happening, but that did nothing.\n\nA: This problem is caused by a wrong way of installing Nvidia drivers. You probably downloaded a .run file form Nvidia site. In this case the driver is not properly installed and will need to be re-installed every time you update kernel.\nThe correct way of installing Nvidia drivers in Ubuntu is to go to System Settings -> Software & Updates -> Additional Drivers.\nAlternative way is to use apt-get.\nBut if you already installed drivers from a .run file, then you need to uninstall them first by running that file again with \"--uninstall\" parameter. \n", "Q: Upgraded Lubuntu 14.10 to 15.04, now get \"Kernel Panic: not syncing VFS: Unable to mount root fs.\" I have a home server with Lubuntu installed.

Use the manual method and forget about tools like Ubuntu Builder.

This laptop came with Windows 7, so it's dual boot.\nMy issue is that in windows 7, f1-12 keys were in default mode (I mean, I didn't have to press the fn key in order to active the function). Now, with Ubuntu, this feature is swaped, so I have to press this annoying key every time I want to change brightness or volume.\nEvery key works fine, it's only that the function is swaped.

So the updater told me my /boot partition is out of space.\nI came here from this answer, which recommended (if you can't expand it directly) to just move the contents of the boot partition to the primary partition and installing grub on it.\nThis was for 10.10, and it sounds rather risky to me. So is that still safe to do on 14.04 LTS?\nThis is not the same as this question, whose hard drive is about to die. The answer does not mention moving contents of /boot.\n\nA: If your boot partition is out of space it is most likely because there are too many old kernel images.\nYou can safely uninstall old kernels that you don't need/use anymore.\nYou can find the kernel version you are using with:\nuname -a\n\nTo find all the installed kernels, instead:\ndpkg -l 'linux-image*'|grep 'ii'\n\n", "Q: How to install Broadcom wireless drivers offline?

The USB live session seems to work in principle, tested it on the Mac I created it on, and can get into a Ubuntu live session (both with 14.04. and 15.04)\nThe problem:\nTrying to get a live session working on my old Thinkpad SL510 (on which I want to install Ubuntu from that session) fails. This is surprising because previously, it worked flawlessly, and in fact, an old version of Ubuntu is installed on the Thinkpad.\nPerhaps this is actually related: earlier today, I tried to upgrade the old Ubuntu version on the Thinkpad with apt-get dist-upgrade. Several errors happened during the upgrade (the Ubuntu version was badly outdated, I should add), so I decided to simply re-install via USB. But, as it turns out, that doesn't seem to work anymore.\nTimeline of the error:\nThinkpad starts up. Option to go to BIOS. Changed boot order to have USB drive on top. In addition, I can also select which drive to boot from via F12, and can select the USB as bootable drive.\nAfter selecting the USB with Ubuntu on it, there is a split second of waiting time, then no activity whatsoever, except for a black screen with a blinking cursor in the top left corner.\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Live USB not working on Thinkpad SL510, despite Ubuntu working on the machine previously.\n\n*Problem doesn't seem to be related to boot order (since I can select the USB as boot drive directly), but perhaps to some screw-up during previous distro upgrade of badly outdated Ubuntu on the Thinkpad.\n\n\nAny ideas what's the problem? \nAny chance that it's grub related? But if so, wouldn't the option to boot from USB appear anyway, and the boot problem only appear after installation to HDD?\nOr maybe related to not finding a graphics display (maybe some driver got screwed up during the failed upgrade?) If so, I guess Ubuntu boot option nomodeset might be worth trying, but unfortunately, I don't know how I could even set it, since I never get to the Ubuntu Live Session menu.\n\nA: So, at first I was thinking it's most likely a problem with some BIOS startup settings, since that seems to be the most common problem in cases like mine, but as it turns out, that wasn't it. \nNow I found a solution myself, described below.

Vendor:Model code is this (from lsusb): Bus 003 Device 003: ID 0951:1665 Kingston Technology\nI've been trying to get these rules to work, but on a 12.04 environment the rules aren't working.

I couldn't figure out why then I always go with other solutions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Well, ignore_device removed with udev release 148. See release note or changelog\nIf you noticed, all topics suggesting the use of it are old (~ 2009).\n\n*A quick alternative is to use: ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\"1\" (Ubuntu 12.04). For releases (>=12.10) which include udisks2 use: ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\".\nReference: Archlinux Wiki: Udisks\nThe other solutions are using SYSFS. Either device/authorized (as solsTiCe mentioned), device/remove or driver/unbind. See Only use Mass Storage devices on a selected USB port - how?\nDifficulty comes in how to deny all storage except only one brand/model. So the rule match condition should filter a single device node, no more no less (no child or parent devices).

This answer is left here for legacy reasons.\n\nSo, I sorta solved this, and it was a PAIN to do.\nI reexamined the restrictions in my rules, and I changed functionality.  Apparently, 12.04 doesn't honor the ignore_device option.  So, I improvised and wrote an unmount script.  Since there's only one functional USB port on these systems, we end up with the following, which I KNOW may break other things:\n/etc/udev/rules.d/100-restrict-usb-devices.rules\n# If a device is NOT a Kingston drive, ignore it.\nACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}!=\"0951\", OPTIONS+=\"ignore_device\", RUN+=\"/usr/bin/logger UnauthorizedUSBConnected\", RUN+=\"/lib/udev/unmount.sh\"\n\n# If a device is a Kingston drive, but is NOT the model we have, ignore it.\nACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0951\", ATTRS{idProduct}!=\"1665\", OPTIONS+=\"ignore_device\", RUN+=\"/usr/bin/logger UnauthorizedUSBConnected\", RUN+=\"/lib/udev/unmount.sh\"\n\n# If a device is a Kingston drive and is the model we have, then run a script\nACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0951\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"1665\", RUN+=\"/lib/udev/syslog-authorized-device-connected.sh\", RUN+=\"/usr/bin/logger AuthorizedUSBConnected\"\n\n/lib/udev/unmount.sh - Just a script that checks first for currently existing devices, and then checks all the other drive devices and unmounts if and only if the script runs.  Since all devices would be sdb, sdc, etc. there's ways to make it work for everything.\n\nMoral of the story: the system ignores the ignore_device option in 12.04.  Gotta script everything.  :/\n", "Q: New version of iPython installed, but only old version can be used (There is a similar question, so I intended to provide more information below that one but got my post deleted. So I'll ask my own question here.)\nI installed the newest version of iPython by typing\nsudo -H pip install ipython\nI confirmed the installed version is 3.1.0\n> pip show ipython\n---\nMetadata-Version: 2.0\nName: ipython\nVersion: 3.1.0\nSummary: IPython: Productive Interactive Computing\nHome-page: http://ipython.org\nAuthor: The IPython Development Team\nAuthor-email: ipython-dev@scipy.org\nLicense: BSD\nLocation: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages\nRequires: \n\nHowever, when I type ipython command and enter the program, the message is:\nPython 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) \nType \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\nIPython 1.2.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.\n?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.\n%quickref -> Quick reference.\nhelp      -> Python's own help system.\nobject?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.\n\nThe only way the IPython 3.1.0 can be called is to type ipython in the directory /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages where pip installed it.\nBy comparing the help file in iPython, I confirmed they are indeed different versions (so not just displaying wrong version).\nTyping which ipython would give /usr/local/bin/ipython, whose content is\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nimport re\nimport sys\n\nfrom IPython import start_ipython\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\\.pyw|\\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])\n    sys.exit(start_ipython())\n\nWeirdly, when I use pip uninstall ipython to remove ipython 3.1.0, the old 1.2.1 version (which I assume came with the system and caused the confusion) also disappeared.\n\nA: I had a similar issue. It turned out that I had two versions of IPython installed, and running ipython in the command line was launching the older version.\nTo resolve this issue, I simply had to update my PATH variable in my /.bashrc (or /.zshrc if you're using zsh as your shell) file.\nexport PATH=\"/path_to_my_anaconda/anaconda/bin:$PATH\"\nSince this section is pre-pended to your original PATH, running ipython should now launch the ipython version that is in anaconda (which I wanted) rather than the vanilla installation. \nAfter sourcing the /.bashrc file with the above line, running ipython from the command line started the version of IPython I wanted.\n", "Q: How to schedule a script to be run as soon as the system is booted? My laptop's touchpad doesn't work unless I enter the following commands in the terminal:\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse proto=imps \n\nI could do this everytime I log in, but I want to automate it.\nHow would I go about doing that?\nNote the need for my password to run the commands? Any way to avoid saving the password in plain text?\n\nA: This should not be done by a script. You can achieve your goal by\necho \"options psmouse proto=imps\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse.conf\n\nDo it once and your touchpad will work after reboot.\nBut you can get your touchpad working a normal way too.\nIf you decide to install an Elantech driver, you will have to revert this setting. It can be done by\nsudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse.conf\n\n", "Q: fresh re installation of ckan, jetty, solr I am trying to install ckan on my ubuntu 14.04, but i got into some errors that i cant fix, so i decided to do a fresh installation after i remove everything from my computer. I am getting some errors while i try to sudo apt-get remove jetty i get\n*Stopping Jetty servlet engine (was reachable on http://myComputer-ubuntu:8983/).\n\njetty start-stop-daemon: user 'solr' not found\n\nstart-stop-daemon: user 'solr' not found\n\ninvoke-rc.d: initscript jetty, action \"stop\" failed.\n\ndpkg: error processing package jetty (--remove): subprocess installed pre-removal script returned error exit status 2\n\n*Starting Jetty servlet engine. jetty start-stop-daemon: user 'solr' not found *(already running). [ OK ]\n\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n\njetty\n\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nafter doing sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove jetty I get this error:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\njetty : Depends: libjetty-java (>= 6.1.26-1ubuntu1.1) but it is not installed\n\nDepends: jsvc but it is not installed\n\nDepends: apache2-utils How on earth can i completely remove Jetty!!??!!\n\ncould any one have an idea? Thanks\n(also posted on StackOverflow, but this seems like the proper place for it)\n\nA: You just edit the jetty startup script /etc/init.d/jetty I assume,  and put a clean exit on the 2nd line:\n#!/bin/sh -e\nexit 0\n\nthen\napt-get update && apt-get -f install\n\nAnd that will cleanly remove jetty.  it fails because the init script fails.\n\nA: I have been experiencing the same error messages on Ubuntu 14 and I've just figured out what it was.\nThe issue was with the line endings of /etc/default/jetty. It turned out that the file had been edited on Windows and had line endings of CRLF, once I updated the file to LF and re-ran it the issue was solved. \nThe quickest way to test this is to revert back to Jetty's original config by running sudo mv /etc/default/jetty /tmp/ and then run sudo service jetty restart. If you have the same issue as me, jetty will restart properly.\n", "Q: Google chrome bookmarks I have follow the instructions from Webex on Ubuntu and after that i have problems when i use the Chrome and i have monitor via HDMI in use, when i click on the Folder bookmark it opens on the other monitor where the Chrom is not on that site. Can some one tell way is this happening, and how can i fix it ? It's start to annoying ... I'm not quite sure if i can remove the previews thing i did, installing java etc to fix the Webex, so i need an expert opinion \n\nA: You are not alone, I'm on a multi-monitor setup on 14.04LTS and anytime I bring down the bookmarks on chrome since the last update it shows the bookmarks on the opposite display.  I don't think WebEX is part of the equation this appears to be specifically a Chrome problem.\nChrome Version 43.0.2357.65 (64-bit)\n", "Q: ubuntu install wubi? first, sorry about my poor english.\ni have win 8.1 pre installed.\ni have tried to install ubuntu on another disk, i make another and gave him 30GB .\nthen i download ubuntu 14 amd64 and Universal USB Installer.\ni installed the ubuntu with the UUI on a flash drive(DOK).\nmy secureboot is disable if its help\ni reboot my laptop, and nothing happend no image of ubuntu.\nok, i try to install from windows. i opened the dok floder and then i saw \"WUBI\".exe\ni opened it and its ask me if i want to reboot my computer to install ubuntu, or i want to install it from the windows.\ni chose the first option, its reboot and nothing happened.usually.\nthen i chose the second, and its start to install some \"ubuntu\" floder on my c disk.\nso i stopped it cause i thought its a bad thing.\nin this ubuntu floder i see ubuntu.exe and uninstaller-wubi.exe and more floders.\nwhat to do?\ni wanna install ubuntu with dual boot.\nu have some advice? \n\nA: Wubi runs like a windows program.  I've not had much experience with it, but I know that it does not need or make its own partition.  It simply installs into the c: (or wherever).\nIn my experience, the best way to install a dual boot is to boot up from the ubuntu USB, and then (if everything is working) install from there.  This will give you the option to select which partition to use for the Ubunut install.\n", "Q: Mouse cursor disappears in Kubuntu 15.04 Recently I installed Kubuntu 15.04 and found that when I'm using Nvidia drivers mouse cursor disappears when I move it to top of the display.

And there has been a whole cottage industry of people writing unit files and publishing them.  GitHub, in particular, seems to attract repositories of collections of service units.\nIndeed simply searching the WWW for autossh.service (as a phrase) turns up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Phillipp Klaus doing this in 2013\n\n*Thomaz Fritz doing this in 2014\n\n*unknown people doing this in 2013\n\n\na template unit\nThat said, as I've pointed out in several places on StackExchange alone, this sort of migration is not a mechanistic process, and sometimes just robotically translating from whatever one has to a unit file is doing things wrongly, or at least poorly.  In this case, autossh is positively panting to be handled with a template unit, that it is instantiated into actual service units, parameterized by the target name.  So as /etc/systemd/system/autossh@.service, have:\n\n[Unit]\nDescription=AutoSSH service for a reverse tunnel from %i \nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=autossh\nEnvironmentFile=/etc/%p/%i.conf\nExecStart=/usr/bin/autossh -M 0 -q -N $SSH_USER@%i $SSH_OPTIONS\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nCreate a file named /etc/autossh/other_server.example.conf with, minimally:SSH_USER=joe\nAll of the usual controls then apply:\n\n\n*\n\n*systemctl enable autossh@other_server.example — Enable an instance to be automatically started at bootstrap.\n\n*systemctl start autossh@other_server.example — Manually start that instance immediately.\n\n*systemctl status autossh@other_server.example — See its status.\n\n\nAnd yes, the first rule even applies to this.  Searching, one can find that I was beaten to this, by just under a fortnight, by Greg Freemyer at OpenSUSE.\n", "Q: Copy folders /home /usr and /opt from hd2 I have the following partitions on my machine:\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"0c910853-807a-4c08-9257-ff028ec31287\" TYPE=\"ext4\" PARTUUID=\"000bb0e6-01\" \n/dev/sdb1: UUID=\"8ca21db1-81b0-42d0-8f56-fde9031c7d70\" TYPE=\"ext4\" PARTUUID=\"000d3067-01\" \n/dev/sdb5: UUID=\"d5e91016-6e23-4664-a460-4e6368ee3e8c\" TYPE=\"swap\" PARTUUID=\"000d3067-05\" \n\nI want to move:  /home /usr and /opt from sda1\nI've tried the command:\n sudo mount /dev/sdb1/ /mnt/tmp\n    mount: special device /dev/sdb1/ does not exist (a path prefix is not a directory)\n\nBut I can not mount the folder\n\nA: Use:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp\n\n/dev/sdb1 is not a directory - a trailing slash shouldn't be present.\n", "Q: Bluetooth not working after upgrading from 14.10 to 15.04 I upgraded to Ubuntu 15.04.

I can understand the need to run sudo apt-get update prior to installing another package, but, what is the difference in running update from the command-line and using the Synaptic package manager for updates and/or the the Auto-updater.\nIf there is no difference, why do we have all three?\n\nA: sudo apt-get update is run automatically in the back ground regularly. Auto-updater is the same as sudo apt-get upgrade. The pretty gui's use libraries that implement the same functions (they may be the same libraries), it's just a pretty gui for users to use. If you ask it to show you the details you'll notice they are just a slightly massaged version of the console output of apt-get.\n\nA: These are three types of methods given to the user.\n\n\n*\n\n*Command line: manual\n\n*Synaptic and the Ubuntu Software Center: GUI (graphical user interface)\n\n*Auto-updater: automatic \n", "Q: How to install RenPy on Ubuntu?

I have tried the nvidia-173 driver, the nvidia-common driver and the xserver-xorg-video-nouveau driver with the same results.\nWhen I boot the machine, it comes up and displays my walpaper on the screen the menu bar at the top and a login box and Ubuntu 14.04 at the bottom left exactly as I expect. At this point, ethernet is working and I can ssh into the machine and everything is normal from the ssh terminal.\nIf I try to log in on the console, either as myself or 'guest', I still see my wallpaper and Ubuntu 14.04 as I expect for some seconds. Then, at the point where it would normally display a desktop, the screen goes black. I have a  bright white cursor which I can move with the mouse or touchpad, but I see nothing else on the screen.\nI can still communicate normally with the machine via ssh over the ethernet port, but I see nothing but the black screen and cursor on the laptop display.\nThere is an external VGA port on the machine, and I have connected a monitor to it with essentially the same results.\nWhat more information can I provide to help figure this out?\nNote 2015/06/05: Additional information. When I originally upgraded this machine from 11.10 to 12.04, I recall that there was an issue involving Nvidia and X11, and at the time I found a very helpful installation package that included an X11 downgrade of some kind that I think was required to make this work, although the symptom wasn't a black screen. I no longer recall what exactly I did, nor can I find anything either on the computer or online about this.\n\nA: I had a desktop version of Ubuntu where I previously had the black screen problem. It was essentially resolved by aggressively removing all the nvidia files. My summary appears here: Fixing/Repairing a Blank (Black) Screen in Ubuntu 13.04.

I then searched for the app in my software center, saw nothing and proceeded to download it again. When it was done as well, I also went to look for it in the software and it was still not there. \nFinally, I watched a youtube video that explained everything in depth, followed the exact procedures (I'm pretty sure) and then still couldnt find the app. The last two times i attempted to install it, it said it was already installed I think, so where should I like for the file and how should I delete it so I can do it again and learn from my mistake?\n\nA: The correct way to install spotify is open your terminal Ctrl+Alt+t and run those commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository -y \"deb http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free\" &&\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 94558F59 &&\nsudo apt-get update -qq &&\nsudo apt-get install spotify-client\n\nIf everything finish with no error then you can be sure that it's installed in your system.\nNow how to find it? Or how to run it?\nIndeed you have to choices: CLI and GUI\n1. For CLI: Ctrl+Alt+t again to open terminal then run the command \nspotify-client\n\n2. For GUI: you don't have to search for it in Ubuntu software Center(USC) since sure you'll not find it there. USC is just a place to search for applications found in official repositories to find and install. Read this about https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter.\nThen now how to find the application. easily all what do you have is to open your dash by clickin on super key which is called \"windows key\" also, or with your  mouse click on the dash, then in the search field write spotify, this will brings you the application then just Enter to run\n\n", "Q: Setting up Minecraft server to start and stop automatically I followed this tutorial: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Ubuntu_startup_script\n...and I am getting an error that says:\nstart: Unknown job: minecraft-server\n\n...when I run the start or stop command.\n\nA: Upstart scripts need to end in .conf.

Obviously these would need to be local devices.  I fthat is what you ask, then the /etc/hosts table is not part of the solution.\nAll that the hosts file does is relate an IP to a host name, so from your host is you went to http://acs/ the hosts file would resoolve that name (acs) to the hosts file defined address, 127.0.1.1,  If you put www.acs.com in the resolution would be the 10.20 IP.

You might need to make a grub modification to make Suspend/Sleep/Hibernate work properly with the BIOS.  The idea would be to make it think that it is a Windows system.  To do this, you need to modify the grub default file.

A simple robust way would be like this\nif CONDITION\nthen\n    echo run >> ~/script-counter\nfi\n\nThis appends a line to a file every time it runs.

Can I change it back to previous version from safe mode  as I am not able to login to my system and I think this might be the issue\n\nA: You can do that through safe mode, just need to mount the partition in read-write mode with this command : mount -o remount,rw /. This command is necessary  because in recovery mode the Ubuntu portion of hard drive is mounted in read-only mode and you cannot make changes to files.  rw option tells ubuntu to allow read-write access to Ubuntu part of the disk. And yes, it is needed before running vim /home/yourusername/.bashrc. \nYou can get to safe mode aka recovery mode, by selecting \"Advanced Options for Ubuntu\" in the boot menu, then recovery mode (if you have multiple ones there, don't freak out - any of them is OK). Then access the root shell, and run the command I mentioned above. After that you can proceed with editing .bashrc or .profile with a text editor such as nano or vi\nNotice also, that in recovery mode, you don't need sudo as in recovery mode you automatically logged in as root. You will also need to navigate to your nome directory to edit .bashrc or .profile by running cd /home/yourusername Notice that if you are logged in as root sudo ~/.bashrc is for root's .bashrc. Tilde expands to current users' home directory, and if you are logged in as root, it will expand to root's home directory. This is why you need to run vi /home/yourusername/.bashrc \n\nA: First you have to notice that there is nothing called safe mode in Ubuntu. Here we have Recovery Mode.\nAnd if you mean Recovery mode then I could say you yes you can do what you want and you can edit those .profile and .bashrc files.\nYou have to notice when running in recovery mode the file system  usually mounted in read only mode so you have to remount it with rw.\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nOnce you do  that you can able to edit the files. and note you dont have to use sudo since you'll be using root. So please be careful not to broke your system, for that I prefer you to use live CD\nOr you can also use the Live CD to do the same task. Just mount your harddisk when you boot from live cd then navigate to the files and do what you want to do.\n", "Q: Any way to force files to inherit owner permissions from parent directory? Is there any way to force a file, created within a directory, to inherit ownership from the parent directory? I tried the sticky bit, but that doesn't seem to work.\nExample of what I'm looking for:\ndrwxrwxr-x www-data somegroup parentdir\n\nWhen parentdir/newfile.htm is created by someuser:\n-rwxrwxr-x www-data somegroup newfile.htm\n\nNOT\n-rwxr-xr-x someuser somegroup newfile.htm\n\nAny way this can be done? Thank you!\n\nA: Linux has something known as Access Control List (ACL). This is a way to extend standard unix permissions and fine tune them. One of the advantages is that it does have inheritance. What could be done, has been referenced by a related post on serverfault, and in your particular case:\nsudo setfacl -Rdm g:somegroup:rwx /path/to/parent\n\nAs for forcing the files to be owned by the same user, it has been discussed in Getting new files to inherit group permissions on Linux, however forcing the same owner on each file is far more troublesome than having the file to be forced to have same group ownership as done via setfacl. If the group has exactly the same permissions as the owner, there's no point to force the same ownership. Of course, you could always use inotifywait and trigger chown upon file creation, but that's pointless since group ownership already gives you control over the file.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Getting new files to inherit group permissions on Linux\n\nA: You problem (it's not really a problem) raises in two parts as I understand from you.\nFirst you want to give ownership of files created by a user in that directory directly to the apache user www-data. This can't be done that way. \nIn  real life You can't give something to  your friend if he doesn't want it!!\nSame thing here, you can't give the ownership to some user without his permission.\nSo how to solve this here:\nyou still need to make chown\nsudo chown www-data newfile.htm\n\nThe other needed is to change the permission of a file to inherits permission of parent directory.\nThis is not a good habit since the directory normally have execute permission x to make cd available in. But x for a normal file make it executable, and as those files as you mentioned are owned by www-data, this also makes you in trouble with a huge security threat, so my advice don't do it\nBut anyway if you still want to try : take a look for those two questions\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/264383/how-to-set-file-permissions-so-that-new-files-inherit-same-permissions\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/151911/how-to-make-new-file-permission-inherit-from-the-parent-directory\n", "Q: Dash is empty, applications do not appear I use Unity on Ubuntu 14.04.

It says in 14.04, AP Hotspot is not working so a downgrade of the app is needed. On my other laptop with the same distro it's working well.\nWhat do you think might be the problem?\n\nA: You can not have more than 4 primary partitions if you use MBR partition scheme(3 primary + 1 extended (which can have several 'child' partitions)). Since you say you already have 4 partitions, one of it must be extended (and other 3 will be primary) Suppose if you have C, D, E and F drives, and for eg: F: is your extended partition you can install Ubuntu on this partition (back up your data before doing this!). Boot from a Ubuntu live USB and select this drive to install Ubuntu. If you want to install Ubuntu with different partitions i.e with separate /boot, home / etc. you will need to partition the existing 'extended' partitions in Windows. \nIf you can provide a picture on how your partitions look in windows it would be helpful for everyone to give more detailed/specific suggestions.\n\nA: You may be able to convert one or more of your existing primary partitions from primary to logical form non-destructively using my FixParts (fixparts, part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu) or with some third-party Windows tools (I have no specific programs to recommend, aside from the Windows version of FixParts, but I hear that some Windows tools can do this). DO NOT attempt to add partitions using the standard Windows tools; they'll convert the disk to the Windows-proprietary Logical Disk Manager format.\nNote that you must not convert any bootable partition to logical form. Also, you may need to slightly shrink a partition to convert the one after it, since you need a small gap before each logical partition.\nAnother option is to create an external recovery disc and delete the partition that handles the same task.\n", "Q: using /home/user/music on two different Ubuntu installs on the same machine I like playing around with the newest daily builds, different DE and stuff, yet need a solid (LTS) fallback to rely on, so I have two installs on the same machine...

Except when one of the installs is e.g. using SELinux or some other non-standard permission model.\nTo allow another user to access the shared data, I'd suggest to add the users to a shared group and allow this group to access the shared data.

I just bought a new motherboard Z97M Plus. The problem is the kernel in Ubuntu 14.04 does not fully support it. For example I have trouble setting up fan control. So my question is, is it ok to install Vivid kernel in Trusty and how to do it? Will it fix the issue?\n\nA: In LTS versions of Ubuntu (eg 12.04, 14.04) you can install the Kernel (and X and graphics drivers) from the next standard releases, leaving everything else as-is. These \"hardware enablement stacks\" are supported for the life of the standard release (9 months currently), by which time you either have to upgrade to the next standard stack, upgrade to a newer LTS or downgrade to the LTS default major versions. \nIt can take some time for a HWE stack to be released. Utopic is latest version advertised, installable via:\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-utopic \n\nBut it seems there are some Vivid packages starting to become available. Some of the X server components are missing but if you just need the Kernel, you can install it with (Warning this didn't boot for me but it might work for you. As I say, it's early days):\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\nThere will be one more HWE stack for Trusty, after which you'll need to hop to 16.04 LTS via a full upgrade to keep getting major kernel updates.\n\nAlternatively, install the latest version of Ubuntu you want, and install the Elementary packages over the top from their PPA.\n\nA: You can upgrade kernel to 3.16 by\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-utopic\n\nto 3.19 by\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\nBut there is no guarantee that it fixes all issues with your hardware. But upgrading kernel this way is safe and can easily be reverted. \nYou can also upgrade graphical stack too, but the command from Ubuntu wiki is not correct.

But when wlan0 disconnects and reconnects, the routing table changed to default.

I'd really like to avoid deleteing my whole record of backups, and start a new one.\n\nA: Well, I know that this is an old post, but I was just now able to fix this problem for myself, so I thought I will leave a comment here.\nWhen I tried to backup my data today, deja-dup almost completed the backup but finally during verification gave an error, saying that the data is corrupted and backup must be deleted. In retrospect, I remembered that I had a failed network connection while backing-up the last time and may be that could be the source of error.\nSo here is what I did, and it seems to have worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Nautilus I navigated to the network location where I backup my data.

Just make sure you're REALLY careful with typing all the commands (i.e. don't just copy-pasta).\n\nA: Really, unless you need something from a previous backup, you don't need the old backup to do a new backup, and you're probably better off deleting the old backup and doing a new one.

At the moment I am using TeamViewer, but it's not really what I want, and I couldn't find a better solution.\nThe files are in Samba shared folders, but if I perform a write action on them (rename, edit, add file), it changes the owner.\nIs there a Windows app that I can use so I remotely manage my Ubuntu filesystem without screwing the file ownership and chmods ? (E.g. something like Total Commander, but with SSH/remote acces capabilities ; or something that allows me to \"mount\" the shared folders so I can edit the files like I'm doing it directly in Ubuntu) I'm not looking for RDP software, I have TeamViewer for that, only something to manage files.\nThanks\n\nA: If you have installed the OpenSSH server on the Ubuntu machine,then you should be able to use any SFTP/SCP-based file manager from the Windows box. My favorite is WinSCP but FileZilla is also popular. \n\nA: You can use xrdp\nsudo apt-get install xrdp\n\nxrdp: An open source remote desktop protocol(rdp) server.\ncheck this for more information and configuration\nhttp://www.tweaking4all.com/software/linux-software/use-xrdp-remote-access-ubuntu-14-04/\n", "Q: How to I install Bastion in Ubuntu 15.04?

This happens over time as you upgrade your kernel. In my experience, if you get an error telling you that you have no space left while running a dist-upgrade you can run:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThen the system will remove the old kernel and install the new one. If you want to remove the kernels you are not using, you can easily use synaptic by searching for linux-headers and linux-image. Synaptic will show you all of the kernels you have, and you can right click on each one and click mark for removal. Just make sure you don't remove all of them. Remove all but the latest (it's good to leave one in case something breaks so you can fall back).\n\nA: Begin to execute this command to check which version you are running:\nuname -r\nThen check linux headers and image currently installed :\ndpkg -l | grep -Ei \"linux-headers|linux-image\"\n\nFinally purge old version (here 3.13.0-30):\nsudo apt-get remove linux-headers-3.13.0-30 linux-headers-3.13.0-30-generic linux-image-3.13.0-30-generic linux-image-extra-3.13.0-30-generic --purge\n\nNOTE : Be carefull, do not purge the current version you are running.\nAlso, try to keep one or two older version just in case.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 15.04: Can no longer navigate with Ctrl + left/right on MySQL shell In previous versions of Ubuntu (and other Linuxes), I was able to jump word-by-word in the MySQL shell with Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→.

Mysql is using editline lib instead of readline and that's breaking a lot of features we are used to, like ctrl + ← or  ctrl + →  to move between words, ctrl + r to reverse search, or even writing unicode characters is not possible.\nEven when he bug is flagged as high, please support the request to change back to readline by adding yourself to the affected users.\n", "Q: High CPU by Firefox For some days, Firefox has been consuming high CPU percentage while simply loading pages.

But now every time I restart my computer, I can't print anything. I have to set up that printer again. \nWhy am I losing my printer configuration/installation after every reboot?\nHow can I fix this and make it persistent?\n\nA: I think it has something to do with not retaining the firmware when it comes back from boot. I've saw some remedies, but they make my head hurt.\nI've had your problem with many linux distros on multiple computers with the hp-1020 printer. I've tried a lot of things over time with no luck. Then I discovered purging the printer drivers in terminal with the lines below  (this is on linux mint 17.1, don't know if the drivers are same on Ubuntu. Do this method at your own risk.)\nsudo apt-get --purge remove printer-driver-foo2zjs-common\nsudo apt-get --purge remove printer-driver-foo2zjs\n\nThen afterwards in terminal use sudo hp-doctor to put back everything purged (use the a option to install all when it gets to the point of asking).\nIf hp-doctor stops at some point because it can't see the printer. It will say cut printer on and run hp-doctor again. At that point cut printer on if off, or if it's already on like mine was, then cut it off then on again and re-run hp-doctor \nIf you're lucky, the doctor won't have any complaints the second time and printer will continue to work after every reboot.

You will also need to install the KDE Connect application from the Playstore (or F-Droid). If you are not using KDE on Ubuntu, you should also install the KDE Connect indicator.\nYou will also get the benefit of receiving your phone notifications on the desktop. You can connect multiple android phones and linux desktops. The connection is encrypted and all involved software is open source.\nYou can get an idea of the available options in the screenshot below:\n\n\nA: There is an Android application named AirDroid .

Using Amaze you can set up an FTP server on Android and send and receive files using FileZilla.\n\nA: GSConnect\nIf you liked the KDEConnect solution mentioned in another answer, but got scared by the KDE part, there is a JavaScript port of KDE connect without any Qt dependencies.\nIt has the same features, but as a GNOME Shell extension requires the GNOME desktop to work\nOn your Android phone, you will have to install the KDE Connect app from F-Droid or the playstore.\n\nA: I use ES File Manager. Just install it on your Android phone and from the menu, click Network > Remote Manager > Turn on, which gives you a link (like ftp://192.168.1.54:8754). In your browser, type the link.

In OSX I can set the permissions of the symlink itself (instead of the thing it points to using the -h). From the man page:\n -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the mode of the link itself rather than the file that the link points to.\n\nIn Ubuntu 14.04 I try to set permissions of a symlink, but it's only set on the symlink target.\nIt's regarding a symlink from /home/nagios/.ssh/someprivatekey to /somewhere/else/privatekey, so permissions are important for ssh. How can I achieve this?\n\nA: You can't. The underlying chmod system call simply doesn't support this in Linux, and for that matter, Linux doesn't care about the link's permissions either. From man chmod:\nchmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system\ncall cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem since  the\npermissions  of  symbolic  links  are  never  used.   However, for each\nsymbolic link listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions\nof  the  pointed-to  file.   In  contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links\nencountered during recursive directory traversals.\n\nAs for hard links or bind mounts, the source's permissions are used, so none of the three standard ways to reflect a file's contents elsewhere can help you in this.\n\nA: Not possible. There is no way since permissions on a symlink are meaningless (a symlink is not a file; it only points to a file).  The way to do this with Linux is through ACL though.\nsymlink are explained as...\n\nThe values of the file mode bits for the created symbolic link are unspecified. All interfaces specified by POSIX.1-2008 shall behave as if the contents of symbolic links can always be read, except that the value of the file mode bits returned in the st_mode field of the stat structure is unspecified.\n\n\nThe difference is here: chmod and chmod... it is BSD versus Linux. \n\nNot sure if it is important but regarding SSH: it uses  stat(2), not lstat(2) to get the permissions. \n\n\n*\n\n*stat() stats the file pointed to by path and fills in buf.\n\n*lstat() is identical to stat(), except that if path is a symbolic link, then the link itself is stat-ed, not the file that it refers to. \n\n", "Q: How to have in Ubuntu, Windows like RDP server and client?

I would like to know if it is possible to do the following:\nI need to access data on a EX4 formatted external HDD that is used as a backup for our CAD server at work.  I read that there are programs you can download to view the files, but they seem to have a habit of corrupting the data and I wish to avoid that. \nI would like to create an Ubuntu live CD and run Ubuntu from that within my normal Windows 7 startup on the rare occasions that I will need to access those files and possibly write them to my (or any other) Windows 7 PC.

You will format this, etc, and can then set it to boot from your computer's BIOS.\nThis answer has more details about how to do this.\n\n*Virtualbox\nThis solution also uses virtualbox, but in a slightly different way.\nVirtualbox is designed to run an OS inside a computer - and it can run on Window, Mac and Linux. As I said above, you'll want the windows host binaries (an exe file).\nThen install Ubuntu on the Virtualbox. The answer here should help, but the basics are here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Virtualbox on your laptop and then download the Ubuntu ISO file.\n\n*Click new and then give it a name and chose Linux then Ubuntu 32 / 64 bit depending on the ISO you went for.\n\n*Give memory and create a new Hard Disk (dynamically allocated VDI probably). It needs to be at least 8GB + what you need to be able to use it.\n\n*Finish and then click settings then storage then the + next to Controller: IDE and navigate to the ISO. Click system and then click the tick next to cd, and move it up to the top with the arrows.\n\n*Click okay and then Start, and Ubuntu will boot.\n", "Q: All my system settings disappeared!

I'm intending to use HTML5.\n\n- Do applications have to undergo a reviewing process like Apple's appstore and the Ubuntu Software Center?\n\n- Is it possible to monitor the activity of the app, in terms of number of downloads, users, etc.?\n\n- I don't have a smartphone, so will I be able to reliably test apps in the Ubuntu SDK?\n\n- Can I charge for apps?\n\n- Can I get access to built in features of the phone/tablet such camera, GPS and accelerometer using HTML5? I know this is supported for android and iOS but not too sure about Ubuntu.\n\n- Is there an official desktop appstore for Ubuntu Touch, or is the third-party uApp Explorer the only option?\nI'll be thankful if only a few of the above are answered.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Here are some answers to your questions that can hopefully get you on your way:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Do applications have to undergo a reviewing process like Apple's appstore and the Ubuntu Software Center?\n  \n\nWhen you upload an app to the Ubuntu Store, it is automatically review by the store. Here, apps can take 5 minutes to go from review to being published! This is because apps are confined, so there is no need to have a code review. As a result, apps are published significantly quicker to the store than if they were published from Apple's appstore or the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Is it possible to monitor the activity of the app, in terms of number of downloads, users, etc.? \n  \n\nWhen you publish your app to the store, there is a page for developers to see how many people have download your app, on what date they downloaded your app, and from what region your users are from. Since you are making an HTML5 app, you could integrate analytic software, like Google Analytics to give you more information in real time.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*I don't have a smartphone, so will I be able to reliably test apps in the Ubuntu SDK? \n  \n\nThe Ubuntu SDK has an Ubuntu Devices tab to manage Ubuntu Emulators, so you will be able to test out your application as if you had a real device. When you app is ready for testing, feel free to reach out to the Ubuntu App Developers Community on Google Plus to get people to test your app on real devices and get feedback.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Can I charge for apps? \n  \n\nYes, the Ubuntu Store does allow developers to charge for their application.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Can I get access to built in features of the phone/tablet such camera, GPS and accelerometer using HTML5? I know this is supported for android and iOS but not too sure about Ubuntu. \n  \n\nLooking on the HTML5 API Page on developer.ubuntu.com, it does not appear that there is a native api for access to these features. However, since Ubuntu Touch has native support for HTML5, it is very likely that some of these features are supported. \nYour best place to start for access to these features is to check out the Cordova guide for Ubuntu. Cordova is an awesome api for developing cross-platform HTML5 apps with access to device sensors. For more information on Ubuntu HTML5 app development, see the HTML5 page on developer.ubuntu.com.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Is there an official desktop appstore for Ubuntu Touch, or is the third-party uApp Explorer the only option?\n  \n\nThere is an appstore, but it is in the Unity 8 version of Ubuntu, the version running on Ubuntu Phones. There is a desktop preview for Unity 8, but that requires installing it on your desktop. Eventually, Unity 8 will be default on the desktop. Until then, your will have to view apps from  uApp Explorer or the store on the Emulator.\nI hope this helped you!

With the default user, who was created on the installation of the server, it works. Why?\nThanks\n\nA: I had a similar situation in the past, in my case the problem was that /bin/false is not a shell. (Sorry, can't explain better, forgot the background. I think it had something to do with PAM.)\nMany older tutorials recommend settings /bin/false as shell for no-login users, but the better choice is /usr/sbin/nologin. \nTry setting /usr/sbin/nologin as login shell for FTP users:\nusermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin USERNAME\n\nThen try logging in again.\n\nA: I solved this with an reinstall of vsftpd. Now the user works.\n\nA: @lxg You were really close to did this.\nI agree that  /usr/sbin/nologin  is not a shell because you didnt add it to /etc/shells. So if you append this line to shells file to looks like for example this:\n\n# /etc/shells: valid login shells\n/bin/sh\n/bin/dash\n/bin/bash\n/bin/rbash\n/usr/sbin/nologin\n\nThat solves the problem.\nOf course command to login as user you have to use\n usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin USERNAME\nand match permissions of shared directory. \nTo roll back login possibility just use:\nusermod -s /bin/bash USERNAME \nBTW.

However, I have a hidden folder (call it /.hidden/) with many subdirectories, most of which have permissions set for root and not my_username. I want to change the permissions of all these subdirectories at once, if possible. However, if I cd /.hidden/ and then type \"sudo chown my_username:my_username *\", none of the file or folder permissions get changed, presumably because they're still considered \"hidden\" by the command even though I can see them. Anyone know an easy way around this?\n\nA: You need to use the -R flag, which will recurse into every subdirectory. For example, running sudo chown -R my_username:my_username .hidden will make .hidden and all subdirectories owned by you.\nThe * glob doesn't match any hidden directories (directories starting with a .).\n", "Q: Brightness & Lock missing in System Settings - can't change screen locking time I am running 14.04.2 LTS.

I have searched using the Unity search icon on the side ribbon, but no success. How do I add or restore that function? Thanks in advance.!\n\nA: Actually, brightness settings are not listed under settings, AFAIK. I just checked. Instead, they are either on your monitor, embedded in your laptop (if you use one) or are with your graphics drivers.

Is it possible to recompile the current running kernel WITHOUT downloading new sources packages?  I just want to reconfigure my currently running & patched kernel. I no longer have the original source build, including several fetched patches which I had downloaded.\n\nA: You cannot compile a kernel without the source. Compiling is something you do with source.

When using iftop on my wlan0 interface, there are a few link-local addresses connecting. \nHow and where can I filter these connections?\nI have very specific UFW rules blocking 169.254.0.0/16, \nbut I am not seeing any \"UFW BLOCK\" in my kernel/syslog. \nThe strange thing is that there isn't even a UFW AUDIT or UFW ALLOW for these connections, but they sure do show up in iftop.\nThis scares me that I have ufw specifically configured block these addresses, and yet iftop shows them connecting, and there's nothing in the log about them at all. Could this be a telepathy exploit?\n\nA: You may be mis-reading what iftop is telling you.  When you run iftop, it puts the interface in promiscuous mode and thus will receive every packet visible on the wire, regardless of where those packets are addressed, particularly broadcast packets.  \nThe 169.254.. packets are being transmitted by any devices on the same network which failed to get a DHCP response and ended up using the self-assigned IP range instead.  Generally these packets are un-routable anyway.\nUFW/IPTables is only going to log blocking a packet when that packet was specifically addressed for that specific host and then rejected by UFW.  There is likely a rule in your table that either discards or accepts broadcast traffic without logging about it.\nIf you launch iftop with the -F cidr options, you can get it to ignore the broadcast packets and focus the display on just the traffic to/from your host, for example:\niftop -F 192.168.1.10/32\nPackets with that one IP address (192.168.1.10) in either the dst or src field will get displayed, the others will be silently filtered out of the display.\n", "Q: No sound out of Ubuntu 15.04 There is literally no sound, I've tried every solution online I could find.

I've just installed Ubuntu 15.04 on a new 240GB SSD, and immediately noticed that /dev/ubuntu-vg/swap_1 on the resulting installation is 137GB.  That seems excessive, even counter-productive, but perhaps the Ubuntu installer chose that since the machine has 128GB of RAM.\nDoes anyone have a strong sense of whether it is useful to have ~140GB of swap, and if not, what a suitable size for the swap should be?  I do run I/O heavy binaries.  Though it may not be relevant I will note that the machine is dual CPU Xeon (E5).\nHaving consulted the link suggested below by Terrance, I am tempted to reduce the automatic ~140GB of swap to ~4GB, as it is taking up more than half of the 240GB SSD on which Ubuntu is installed!\n\nA: While the amount of swap you need is always dependent on your workload, that is certainly an excessive amount of swap and almost certainly can be attributed to an overly-simplistic \"swap = RAM * x\" type calculation.\nShort answer: in my opinion, 4GB swap is almost always more than enough.\nLong answer: Swap is always designed to stand-in for times where your system is operating abnormally - that is, your RAM usage by processes is nearing or exceeding the amount of physical RAM you have.  If the processes you are running use a very predictable amount of RAM (eg a database server that you've configured a certain heap limit) then your RAM use is going to be somewhat stable and swap is unlikely to ever be used.  If you are certain that RAM use by processes will never near or exceed physical RAM, you don't even need any swap.  But on a typical server, there is usually the random possibility that tasks will run which eat up large amounts of memory for a certain period, and when this causes RAM usage to near or exceed physical RAM, swap will step in and save your system from killing processes or running out of enough cache space to run efficiently.\nI say that 4GB swap is usually more than enough swap even on a system with a large amount of RAM, because I feel as if that's enough for 1 or 2 relatively memory-hungry processes to exceed physical RAM by if your system is already working near its limit.  I feel as though if your are in deficit by more than 4GB, something a lot more serious is wrong which would need to be fixed by configuring your memory-hungry processes.  Processes which occupy significantly more than 2GB RAM will usually be programmed to somehow self-limit their RAM use either by configuration or by being intelligent about how much physical RAM is remaining.\nOther opinions on how much swap is \"more than enough\" will vary of course.  Some will say 1GB, 2GB, 8GB, etc.  Some will say you don't need any with that much physical RAM (but I'd disagree).\nOne more thing: \"hibernation\" requires enough swap space to write all process memory, so if your swap space is significantly smaller than physical RAM you are not going to be able to hibernate.  On a system with 128GB RAM, you probably won't want to hibernate anyway - reserving that much swap space just for the privilege of hibernating would not only eat significantly into your disk space (especially for an SSD) it would also be pretty slow - imagine loading ~128GB from disk on resume, that would be significantly slower than just a normal boot.\n\nA: With that much RAM on a system, there really shouldn't be a need for a large swap partition.  Most of what it would be needed for is to swap info out of the RAM that maybe dirtied up and needs to be swapped, but anywhere from 4GB to 16GB should be sufficient enough.\nGreat information from the link below.\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/777907/swap-partition-size-on-a-64-gb-ram-computer-for-memory-intensive-work\n", "Q: Data won't persist on reboot I have an old netbook lying around so I've been trying to install ubuntu on it.  I downloaded unetbootin and the ubuntu iso, and used unetbootin to install it. In unetbootin, for \"Space used to preserve files across reboots (ubuntu only)\" I have tried both 10 MB and 3072 MB (I wasn't really sure what it was).\nAnd both times, I can boot into ubuntu flawlessly, but nothing I do is saved when I reboot.  And unfortunately I don't have any USB sticks or a CD drive, so I can't install Ubuntu the traditional way.  \nIs there any way I can install Ubuntu and get it to keep my files after I boot, or is this a lost cause?\n\nA: If you did choose this, and about 1GB is pretty optimal, it takes time to write out the updates so if it let you reboot or shutdown without delay I would be surprised if it wrote to 3GB. The thing is to keep your changes small and let the baseline do the heavy lifting so no wholesale apt-get upgrades. I can't tell you how to remaster the install either. \nGo back and try again, and keep your changes small, and the space small and do not interrupt shutdown.\nYou may want to try one of the netbook remixes.\n", "Q: Firefox cannot access a frequently visited website anymore I have tried unsuccessfully all the troubleshooting available from Firefox but I keep getting the same error:\nThe following error was encountered while trying to retrieve the URL: http://vodlocker.com/wv420ypnzarv\n    Connection to host failed.\nThe system returned: (110) Connection timed out\nThe remote host or network may be down. Please try the request again.\n\nI can access the website with my other computer, and I used to do it with this computer too.\nIs there a way to block access to an URL in Ubuntu?\nWhere should that code be stored?\n\nA: Probably you have an issue with the DNS resolver cache. The DNS resolver translates domain names to IP addresses and back. Probably the entry in your DNS cache is no longer valid.\nYou can try to refresh your cache by restarting the DNS service:\nsudo service nscd restart\n\nIf that does not work, try this\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n", "Q: Installing software on another computer with bash I'm relatively new to all things Linux, but I've missed out on two really good job opportunities because I lack Linux experience.

Since the server, prior to installing an os, will not have a working TCP/ip stack (I.e. networking ), you won't be able to simply ssh/putty over to it. \nUnless you have a device that allows you to have keyboard/video/mouse access over the network to a separate device that's then connected to the server, you won't be able to do a bare metal installation. \nIt is possible to configure a serial null modem connection to the server from the desk top to allow such installations (this is well documented in various older Linux how to books) most consumer grade motherboards may not support this type of connection.\n", "Q: How to transfer data from Genymotion to host machine?

I am using Xfce with Kde Plamsa5 as Window Manager. I cant open Xfce Window Settings anymore but KDE System Settings. I cant find an option to \nautomatically focus to newly created windows. \nWhen I open up a new window the focus stays on the window it was on before, but I want the new window to be raised and focused automatically. \n\nA: It's \"focus stealing prevention\" in the Kwin Window Settings. If it's set to \"medium\", newly opened windows get the focus automatically.\n\nA: The clean solution\nI do not use plasma, so I cannot look into what causes the issue. No need to explain that eliminating the cause would be the \"cleanest\" solution.\nIf that seems impossible, and you do want to use this combination, you can however use the bandage below to make it work. The solution is an extremely \"light\" background script, keeping an eye on newly created windows, raising them if they appear.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as raise_window.py \n\n*Test-run it from a terminal by the command:\npython3 /path/to/raise_window.py\n\nOpen some applications and see if their windows are automatically raised.\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your startup applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add the command.\n\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport os\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\ncurr_1 = get([\"wmctrl\", \"-l\"]).splitlines()\n\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        curr_2 = get([\"wmctrl\", \"-l\"]).splitlines()\n        new = [w for w in curr_2 if not w in curr_1]\n        for w in new:\n            w = w.split()[0]\n            command = \"wmctrl -ia \"+w\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n    except:\n        pass\n    curr_1 = curr_2\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n", "Q: Can I install ubuntu touch in konka KM7011BK tablet? Is it possible to install ubuntu touch on konka tablet with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of storage? It also has a microSD card slot which can be expandable upto 32GB.\n\nA: You can't expect it to work out of the box right now. There may be compatibility issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*not being able to connect to the internet\n\n*simply not booting\n\n*crashing / unstability\n\n\nI would advice against it, but you can always try and let us know the results.\nIt's not only the specifications that are important for Ubuntu Touch, it needs drivers for the hardware too. There is a big chance some of these will be missing.

It is version 4.3.26 (Latest, only installed it today)\n\nA: The problem was I wasn't part of the vboxuser group. For those with the same problem:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have the Virtualbox Extension Pack. This allows use of USB 2.0. USB 3.0 is not yet supported.\n\n\n*Add yourself to the vboxuser group (in the host):\nsudo usermod -a -G vboxusers <useruame>\n\n\n\n*Log out then back in for the change to take effect.\n\n\n*Enable USB 2.0 (EHCI) controller in the settings for you VM.\nIf you need more help see this topic.\nCredit to Takkat.\n\nA: In my case, after having applied William Satterthwaite's hack above, I could see the list of USB devices in VirtualBox and connect them. But they wouldn't appear in the guest OS. Then I turned off the guest and change the USB adapter from USB 3.0 to USB 2.0.

If that can't be found, or it doesn't work, it\n  will ask you for your gdlib configuration.  It's best to let\n  gdlib-config take care of that.  Best way to solve this problem is to\n  make sure gdlib-config is somewhere in your PATH and that\n  gdlib-config --all works.\nOtherwise replace all the instances of prompt with\n  Module::Build->prompt and it should work.\n\nAnd here is the problematic code in Build.pl\nmy $PREFIX = $lib_gd_path;\nif( ! defined($lib_gd_path) )\n{\n  warn \"\\n\";\n  $PREFIX = prompt('Where is libgd installed?','/usr/lib');\n}\n\nand here\nmy ($JPEG, $FT, $XPM, $GIF,$ANIMGIF,$UNCLOSEDPOLY,$FONTCONFIG,$PNG,$FTCIRCLE,$VERSION_33);\nif( defined($options) )\n{\n  $JPEG      = $options =~ m/JPEG/i;\n  $FT        = $options =~ m/FT|FREETYPE/i;\n  $XPM       = $options =~ m/XPM/i;\n  $GIF       = $options =~ m/GIF/i;\n  $PNG       = $options =~ m/PNG/i;\n  $ANIMGIF   = $GIF && $options =~ m/ANIMGIF/i;\n  $VERSION_33= $options =~ m/VERSION_33/i;\n  $UNCLOSEDPOLY  = $options =~ m/UNCLOSEDPOLY/i;\n  $FONTCONFIG  = $options =~ m/FONTCONFIG/i;\n  $FTCIRCLE  = $options =~ m/FTCIRCLE/i;\n}\nelse\n{\n    warn \"\\nPlease choose the features that match how libgd was built:\\n\";\n    $JPEG    = lc prompt('Build JPEG support?','y') eq 'y';\n    $PNG     = lc prompt('Build PNG support?','y') eq 'y';\n    $FT      = lc prompt('Build FreeType support?','y') eq 'y';\n    $GIF     = lc prompt('Build GIF support?','y') eq 'y';\n    $ANIMGIF = $GIF && lc prompt('Build support for animated GIFs?','y') eq 'y';\n    $XPM     = $^O !~ /^freebsd|MSWin32$/ && lc prompt('Build XPM support?','y') eq 'y';\n}\n\nand so on.\n\nA: Try:\nsudo apt-get install libgd-gd2-perl\n\nto install the package which will take care of the dependancies you are missing.\n", "Q: 14.04 Nvidia issues - black screen, freeze etc I have some issues with nvidia drivers on ubuntu 14.04, switchable graphics (intel HD + nvidia GT 740M). \nCurrently installed (from xorg-edgers repository): nvidia-352 (was recommended by ubuntu-drivers devices) + nvidia-prime + nvidia-settings.\nIssues (appears only when nvidia is selected in prime, with intel no problems):\n\n\n*\n\n*Blackscreen on login screen (I can hear sound, if I run startx from ctrl-alt-f1 and then stop it, or suspend/standby my pc and turn it on again - display appears).\n\n*when using touchpad it freezes every few minutes, and ctrl-alt-f1 then ctrl-alt-f7 unfreezes it. I saw bug report regarding this issue and it was marked as patched/fixed so not sure what the problem is.\nNvidia settings can show temp etc and seems like the driver has good communication with nvidia card.\nI tried to purge nvidia*. I tried using different drivers (nvidia-331). Both cause the same issues.\n\nA: The problem with hybrid graphics (aka switchable, etc) and nVidia Optimus technology is that nVidia doesn't give support of Optimus to Linux.  Meaning, you will always have problems of black screen when trying to run your machine with nVidia video chip directly.\nTo avoid this problem, there is a project called Bumblebee, which runs as main video chip the intel video integrated chip, turns off the nvidia to save power, and when you need video acelerating you can use optirun command to activate the nvidia chip.\nYou can find help about Bumblebee in the Ubuntu Help page:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\nHope that helps you solve your problem\n", "Q: Problems with accessing applications under /var/www I have Ubuntu 14.04 installed.\nThe DocumentRoot is /var/www/html\nWhen I type in my url address, it works fine: My test file shows up.

You can even change that, the script will calculate the setting and the positions of your icons.\nHow it works in practice\n\n\n*\n\n*Press a key combination (1) to take a snapshot of the current desktop icon arrangement (as mentioned, you only need to do this once). This arrangement will be remembered in a hidden file\n\n*Now attach your second screen, make any setup you'd like (left/right, top alligned or not, all is possible). Your desktop will be messed up.\n\n*Press another key combination (2), to \"translate\" your desktop layout to the new setup. Your icons will be moved to your built-in screen on the right as if no second screen was connected. Click on the desktop and subsequently press F5 to refresh the desktop (else you won't see the changes).\n\n\nIf you disconnect the second screen, your desktop will be messed up again. Simply press key combination (2), click on the desktop and press F5 again to restore the layout again.\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as arrange_desktop.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the name of your \"main\" screen (use the xrandr command to find out). This will probably be your built-in screen. I already set it to the output of xrandr in your question.\n\n*Arrange your desktop icons as you like\n\n*Test-run the script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run it from a terminal by the command:\npython3 /path/to/arrange_desktop.py snapshot\n\n\n*You'll see a notification:\n\n\n\n*Now connect the second screen, set it up as you want, your icons will be messed up.\n\n*Now run the script again, with the option restore:\npython3 /path/to/arrange_desktop.py restore\n\n\n*You'll see a notification:\n\n\n*Click on the desktop (anywhere) and press F5, your icons will be arranged according the snapshot on the main screen (the right one in your case), no matter what is the current screen setup.\n\n*If all works fine, create two shortcut keys for the commands:\npython3 /path/to/arrange_desktop.py snapshot\n\nand\n    python3 /path/to/arrange_desktop.py restore\n\nand you'll be done. Now you can fix your desktop layout both ways (connect-disconnect) with a simple key combination.\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*No need to say that if you change thge desktop arrangement and you want it to be remembered, take a snapshot again.\n\n*You can take a snapshot while the second screen is attached or not, the script calculates the icon positions correctly to the \"main\" screen.\n\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n#--- set the localized name of your desktop below (if necessary)\ndt_name = \"Desktop\"\n#--- set the name of the \"main\" screen below (replace \"DVI-I-1\")\nscreen = \"LVDS1\"\n#---\n\narg = sys.argv[1]\n\n# used strings & definitions\nval = \" 'metadata::nautilus-icon-position' \"\nsearch = \"gvfs-info -a\"+val\nset_val = \"gvfs-set-attribute -t string \"\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ndt_dir = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/\"+dt_name\ndatafile = home+\"/.desktop_items.txt\"\n\n# functions\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef scr_data():\n    scr = [l.split() for l in get(\"xrandr\").splitlines() if screen in l][0]\n    return [int(n) for n in [s for s in scr if all([\"+\" in s, \"x\" in s])][0].split(\"+\")[-2:]]\n\n# take a snapshot of the icon layout\nif arg == \"snapshot\":\n    screen_pos = scr_data()\n    try:\n        os.remove(datafile)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        pass\n    dt_items = os.listdir(dt_dir)\n    dt_data = []\n    for f in [f for f in dt_items if all([not f.startswith(\".\"), not f.endswith(\"~\")])]:\n        f = '\"'+f+'\"' if f.count(\" \") > 0 else f\n        file = dt_dir+\"/\"+f\n        cmd = search+file\n        try:\n            loc = [int(n) for n in get(cmd).split()[-1].split(\",\")]\n            loc[0] = loc[0] - screen_pos[0]; loc[1] = loc[1] - screen_pos[1]\n            loc = (\",\").join([str(n) for n in loc])\n            open(datafile, \"a+\").write(file+\"|||\"+loc+\"\\n\")\n        except:\n            pass\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"notify-send 'A snapshot was taken'\"])\n\n# restore icons\nelif arg == \"restore\":\n    vector = scr_data()\n    items = [l.strip().split(\"|||\") for l in open(datafile).readlines()]\n    for item in items:\n        try:\n            xy = [int(n) for n in item[1].split(\",\")]\n            move_to = (\",\").join(str(n) for n in [vector[0]+xy[0], vector[1]+xy[1]])\n            command = set_val+item[0]+val+move_to\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n        except:\n            pass\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"notify-send 'Click on the desktop and press F5'\"])\n\n\nA: I have this problemin virtuabox the solution , change the screen between monitors.\n\n\n*\n\n*The primary screen move to your Build-in Display \n\n*The secondary screen move to your Samsumg display\n\n\nOther mode in Ubuntu is change xml monitors :\n    gedit ~/.config/monitors.xml \n\nAnd edit : \n    <primary>yes</primary> <!-- For primary monitor -->\n    <primary>no</primary> <!-- For not primary monitor -->\n\n", "Q: Archiving a lot of files / one big file I want to compress about 100'000 files (that's what find . -type f | wc -l says) with a total disk usage of 100 GB. Most of the files are small but just a handful of them makes up about 70 GB of the 100 GB.\nI don't want to use tar or tar.gz for this because if I want to access the archive, File Roller first has to read in the entire archive from the external HDD before I can even see the file list. Same thing if I try to list the files on the terminal.\nI don't need the rights management of tar because I can remember the few files which need other rights than the others. What compression algorithm should I use?\nAnd while I'm at it: I make full disk backups with this command:\ndd if=/dev/sda bs=32M | gzip -9 > /location/dateAndMachineName.gz\n\nIt does a pretty good compression. But do you know a better compression algorithm?\n\nA: The only solution I am aware of is pixz (sudo apt-get install pixz), a variant of xz using a blocked encoder which allows for fast random acccess/indexing. Additionally, it is a parallel method using multiple cores for compression.\nCiting the docs:\n\nThe existing XZ Utils ( http://tukaani.org/xz/ ) provide great\n  compression in the .xz file format, but they have two significant\n  problems:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*They are single-threaded, while most users nowadays have multi-core computers.\n  \n*The .xz files they produce are just one big block of compressed data, rather than a collection of smaller blocks. This makes random\n  access to the original data impossible.\n  \n  \n  With pixz, both these problems are solved.\n\nUsage is simple: \ntar -Ipixz -cf foo.tpxz foo to compress a folder foo\npixz -l foo.tpxz to list files in it (fast!)\npixz -x <file_path> < foo.tpxz | tar x to extract a single file given <file_path> in the archive\nAs a bonus, you will get access rights stored as well since the files are tarred first!\n\nA: I con only think of one solution for you:\nMake a new partition, with a btrfs filesystem and activate transparent compression.\nKeep in mind tha some people still considder btrfs an \"experimental\" filesystem. That being said, my secondary backup HDD is using btrfs (for little over 2 years) and so far it's given me 0 issues. But as usual YMMV.\nThis and this should get you started with btrfs, if you are not familiar with it already.\n", "Q: Installing from the internet vs repos So I'm on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 on an HP HDX 16 Laptop and have a few questions regarding installing software. \nFirst thing I did was sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nSo I've used Linux for about 3 years and usually open up a terminal windows and run sudo apt-get install, yum install, or pacman -S to install packages. But I've just come back from 4 months of living in Windows 7 and 8.1 due to work and school, and now I'm back on Linux, specifically Ubuntu. So I've come to rely on a set of tools namely, sublime text 3, brackets, Visual Studio, and Netbeans. Also Apache but I've built and compiled Apache from source and find ubuntu package much more convenient. But as for the other editors with the exception of Netbeans and VS (though I'm definitely going give VS Code a try), come in .deb packages which i can easily run. I was wondering if this any better or worse than adding PPA from say webupd8team and installing via apt-get. \nI feel like I'm getting the latest versions by installing them directly from the website, are there any problems in the long run by doing this way. Also, I use Java for school work and was wondering if it would be ok to install the Java8 + Netbeans bundle from Oracle, it comes an executable installer. As far as Java being installed properly on my machine\n\nA: Indeed there is no specific answer. The answer would bw related to each package unique. The master guidlune to your choice is what you care about.\nInstalling from Ubuntu main repositories ensure you security, stability but with some versions, since to ensure the policies put by ubuntu packaging system would take some time.\nSo as a guidline, don't add third party repositories unless you really need it. So if old versions work for you then you shouldn't add that third party repositories. Another major consequence better to choose some known and trusted third party repositories if you need them, so if you don' t the needed third party repositories it's better to download only the .deb if available and not adding that repo\n\nA: Installing from the website itself gives you the latest updates of that particular software. Software being in PPAs generally take time to be tested and modified.

What to do next?\nSecond try at explaining my problem:\nAfter I installed the latest updates to 14.04.2 (including the new linux kernel) my display was wacky and the computer hung as soon as I tried to do something. I tried reverting to the previous kernel version but that didn't help. What to do next?\nI hope this is a clearer, more complete explanation of my problem. on the morning of May 22, my screen was displaying a dialog box announcing that security and other updates for my 14.04 OS were available. As I usually do, I expanded the list of updates to see what would be updated. Upon seeing that a new linux kernel (3.13.0-53, I think) was on the list I knew that a restart would be needed, so I closed my open applications and clicked the 'update now' button. Rather than wait for the update to complete, which I usually do, I went for coffee and errands with my wife. When I returned 2+ hours later I woke up the screensaver with my password and found the expected 'must restart to complete installation' dialog. I restarted. The restart took somewhat longer than usual and the icons down the left side of the screen were split in half and were missing pixels. I clicked on one and the computer froze, couldn't move the mouse, nothing. I powered down to restart and this time the restart took way longer but the screen looked more or less the same. I could move the mouse so I clicked on the button and the top right and tried to restart again from there. Nothing.\nSo I went to my Win7 computer and searched for a report of crashes after updating. I found one that indicated that reverting to a previous kernel might work, so I interrupted the next restart with a call to GRUB and chose to restart with the previous kernel in recovery mode. That led to screens that I had no clue how to deal with. So I tried again with the previous kernel, normal restart. That left me with what I had started with, a strange looking home screen and a computer that freezes on the first click of anything. Is that better?\n\nA: You did not write this anywhere it your post, but taggs say that you have an Nvidia graphics adapter.

The PC has a 500 Gigabyte HDD. \nDuring the installation it divided the HDD into separate partitions. However every time I turn on the PC it goes directly into Windows 8.1. It doesn't allow you the opportunity to select which OS you want to use. \nQuestion 1: How do I set the PC so it will allow me to select the OS?\nQuestion 2: And if #1 isn't possible. How to I remove Ubuntu from the PC and recover the partition for Windows\n\nA: Recently, I bought an Acer Aspire ES1-512 for a college course. As it happens this course requires the students to use Ubuntu. After several unsuccessful attempts to install Ubuntu alongside Windows. I believe I have an answer that allows you to install Ubuntu 14.04.2 alongside Windows 8.1 on an Acer Aspire ES1-512.\nSome of the steps are from memory, so if something doesn't work please let me know.\nSteps for Installing Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the laptop and press F2 as soon as you see the \"Acer Explore\nBeyond Limits\" screen. This will take you into the UEFI/BIOS screen.\n\n*If this is the first time you have entered the UEFI/BIOS section there are some adjustments that need to be made.\n\n*Using the cursor keys highlight the menu item \"Main.\" \n\n*Network Boot:       [Disabled]\n\n*F12 Boot Menu:  [Enabled]\n\n*D2D Recovery:   [Enabled]\n\n*Wake on LAN:    [Disabled]\n\n*SATA Mode:      [AHCI Mode]\n\n*Touchpad:       [Advanced]\n\n*xHCI Support:  [Enabled]\n\n*Cursor over to the \"Security\" menu item.\n\n*Set Supervisor Password to one of your choosing.\n\n*Disable \"Password on Boot.\"\n\n*Cursor over to the \"Boot\" menu item and arrange these items.\n\n*Boot Mode: [UEFI]\n\n*Secure Boot:   [Enabled]\n\n*Arrange the boot devices as follows\n\n*ATPI CDROM:\n\n*HDD:\n\n*USB HDD:\n\n*USB FDD:\n\n*Network Boot - IPV4\n\n*USB CDROM:\n\n*Network Boot IPV6\n\n*Windows Boot Manager\n\n*Press F10 to Save your modifications and Exit BIOS. \n\n*Open the DVD tray and insert your LiveDVD of Ubuntu. Close the DVD tray and restart your laptop. \n\n*When you restart, if the boot order is set correctly you should boot up in Ubuntu. If not go back into the \"Boot\" item in the BIOS menu and make sure the laptop's DVD is at the top of the boot devices.\n\n*Select the option \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\" The installation program will divide the Windows partition. My Acer Aspire has a 500 Gigabyte HDD. The installation program divided it like so:\n\n*Files (27.2 GB) /dev/sda4(ntfs) 253 GB\n\n*Ubuntu /dev/sda5(ext4) 231 GB \n\n*Wait for Ubuntu to install. This will take awhile. \n\n*After Ubuntu is installed you will be instructed to reboot your laptop. After you select reboot you will be instructed to remove the Ubuntu DVD from the DVD ROM drive.\nWarning: If you think the laptop will now boot up and let you choose which OS you want to run. I am afraid you will be disappointed. The only OS recognized by the UEFI firmware at this time is Windows.\n\n*Restart the laptop as we did back in Step 1. \n\n*Use the right cursor key to highlight \"Security\"  and use the down cursor key to highlight \"Select an UEFI file as trusted for executing\" and press Enter.\n\n*The \"Security\" window will show HDD0 in white letters. Press the Enter key.\n\n*On my laptop two items; they look like folders show up: \"EFI and Temp.\" Highlight EFI and press Enter.\n\n*These folders are displayed: ., .., ubuntu, Microsoft, Boot, and OEM. Highlight ubuntu and press Enter. \n\n*Another set of folders are listed: ., .., shimx64.efi, grubx64.efi, and  MokManager.efi. Highlight \"grubx64.efi\" and press Enter.\n\n*The \"Add an new file\" window will appear in the middle of the screen with the question: \"Do you wish to add this file to allowable database?\"  In the \"Boot Description\" type in grubx64.efi and press the Enter key twice.\n\n*Press F10 to Save and Exit BIOS.\n\n*Now restart the laptop and return to the BIOS menu. Cursor over to the \"Boot\" item and you will see a ninth boot file added: \"EFI File Boot 0: grubx64efi.\" If you choose to leave the boot order alone. Whenever you turn on your laptop it will boot up in Windows. \n\n*Or you can move the \"\"EFI File Boot 0: grubx64efi\" to the eight position and boot up in Ubuntu.\n\n\nFor stealth reasons you can let your laptop default boot into Windows, but if you need Ubuntu  when you power on the Laptop press the F12 key repeatedly until the \"Boot Manager's\" window opens. There should be two options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows Boot Manager\n\n*grubx64efi\n\n\nTo boot Ubuntu highlight the grubx64efi and press Enter. For Windows highlight Windows Boot Manager and press Enter. \n\nA: I have an Aspire E15 E5-573G-531D laptop (with WIndows 10) and I was originally unable to boot from CD/DVD/USB stick, but I've now solved it and here's how ...\nObviously, first ensure you're using a DVD/CD/USB stick which is bootable (i.e. that you were able to boot from on a different computer).\nBefore you can boot from DVD/CD/USB stick, you need to access the BIOS. To do this, reboot the laptop and keep pressing F2 until BIOS is displayed. In BIOS, go to the boot menu and do several things:-\n1.  Put \"Windows boot manager\" low down the boot order (e.g. just before network boot).\n2.  Put whatever device you want to boot from high up the boot order (e.g. position 1).\n3.  Switch from “UEFI” to “Legacy” boot mode.\nNow save changes and exit BIOS. When the laptop restarts, you'll get some DOS text with the GUID and MAC address and after a short wait it’ll say “exiting PXE ROM” and will then boot from the CD/DVD/USB stick .... Voila!\n(Now do whatever you want to from the DVD/CD/USB stick as you want). \n(NB: If you're running an app to wipe unused space on HDD - if that's why you needed to boot from DVD/CD/USB stick - ensure you don't accidentally delete the boot partition(s) which are marked “Primary Unknown”. I deleted several of these partitions by mistake and couldn't restart the computer afterwards, so don't make that mistake).\nNow, having run your DVD/CD/USB stick app, you'll want to put the laptop back the way it was so that'll it start Windows as before. To do this, first shut down (not reboot) the laptop. Wait for the lights to go off. Now switch computer on and keep pressing F2 until BIOS is displayed. In BIOS, go to the boot menu and:-\n1. Switch from “Legacy” to \"UEFI\" boot mode.\n2. Disable secure boot (It won't boot with secure boot enabled).\nNow save changes and exit BIOS. It will now restart and run Windows as before. Voila!\n\nA: Go to BIOS and set up supervision password. Next go to boot and make security boot from enable to disable. That all. \n\nA: Did you install windows after installing Ubuntu. If so then you need to reinstall the GRUB by booting through live disk.\nAnd if that's not the case then:\nDid you make a \"swap\" partition?\nThe process is like: (lets assume you have one drive with windows on it of 400 GB, other on with Linux with space of 100 GB)\n\n\n*\n\n*Now divide this 100 GB partition in two parts. Make one of almost 2-3 GB and make it's partition type as \"SWAP\" \n\n*The remaining space, format it as ext4 partition.\n\n*Go ahead with installation you won't face any problems.\nNote: You can do all these step by booting through live disk of ubuntu and deleting the partition with linux installed on it already and then do as said. Choose Custom partitioning when you're asked for installation destination.\n", "Q: How to mount Google Drive, without grive?

You may earn additional knowledge from this source pointing out similar problems with other apps besides Springseed.\nPlease read the content from the second link carefully again if you face any problems.\n\nA: You have two options\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the dependencies and use the latest libgcrypt\nThere are multiple reasons we're up to libgcrypt20\n\n*Install libgcrypt11 and use an old version of libgcrypt\n\nChange the dependencies:\nFirst, remove the previous installation of SpringSeed:\nsudo apt-get remove springseed\n\nDownload the latest SpringsSeed version here:\nE.G.:\ncd\nwget http://cdn.michealharker.com/dl/springseed_2.0_amd64.deb\n\nFollow these commands\nmkdir temp.$$\ncp springseed_2.0_amd64.deb temp.$$\ncd temp.$$\ndpkg-deb -x springseed_2.0_amd64.deb springseed-repackaged\ncd springseed-repackaged\ndpkg-deb -e ../springseed_2.0_amd64.deb\n\nOpen the control file:\nnano DEBIAN/control\n\nreplace the line:\nDepends: gconf2, gconf-service, libgtk2.0-0, libudev0 | libudev1, libgcrypt11, libgnome-keyring0, gir1.2-gnomekeyring-1.0, libnotify4, libxtst6, libnss3, python\n\nwith:\nDepends: gconf2, gconf-service, libgtk2.0-0, libudev0 | libudev1, libgcrypt20, libgnome-keyring0, gir1.2-gnomekeyring-1.0, libnotify4, libxtst6, libnss3, python\n\nSave and exit and follow these commands:\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg-deb -b springseed-repackaged\nsudo dpkg -i springseed-repackaged.deb\n\n\nInstall libgcrypt11\nOpen a terminal and download the latest Utopic version for libgcrypt11:\ncd\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/libg/libgcrypt11/libgcrypt11_1.5.4-2ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb\n\nDownload the latest Springseed version here, eg:\nwget http://cdn.michealharker.com/dl/springseed_2.0_amd64.deb\n\nInstall with:\nsudo dpkg -i libgcrypt11_1.5.4-2ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i springseed_2.0_amd64.deb\n\nAnd it works in Ubuntu 15.04 as well!\n\n", "Q: Minecraft with OpenJDK 7, I get \"the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty\" Im using Ubuntu 15.04 and OpenJDK 7, trying to run Minecraft. This is what I get.\nEDIT: Minecraft is working now when I use sudo java -jar Minecraft.jar but doesn't work without super user, how would I fix this! The reason i can't run it as super user all the time is because i want to be able to run by double-clicking it on desktop. \nDownloading: https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/launcher/launcher.pack.lzma (try 4/10)\nException: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unexpected error: java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty\n\nWhen running it.

The Minecraft launcher really\n  should give a better error message, but this was really Ubuntu’s\n  fault. You need the ca-certificates-java package installed, but on my\n  Ubuntu install, it was broken. Try doing ls\n  /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts. If it comes up missing, then you need\n  copy it from a friend or a different Unix machine.

At the bottom of this bug report, I found this magical series of commands:\nsudo dpkg --purge --force-depends ca-certificates-java\n\nAnd then:\nsudo apt-get install ca-certificates-java\n\nThis instantly solved the problem for me.\n\nA: I just solved it! Here is how to fix all SSL errors in Minecraft. \n\n\n*\n\n*You need another Linux computer's \"cacerts\" file, so on another Linux PC run this command:\nreadlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed \"s:bin/java::\"\n\nand go to that path (Something like /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/).\n\n*Open the \"lib\" folder, then open the \"security\" folder.\n\n*Copy the \"cacerts\" file.\n\n*Run the command again on your computer and go to that path:\nreadlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed \"s:bin/java::\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are having trouble editing things, you need to open \"Files\" using sudo -H nautilus.\n\n\n*Open \"lib\" and then \"security\" again.\n\n*Replace the \"cacerts\" file with the file from the other PC. \n\n\nIf you can't find the \"cacerts\" file on another PC, check this path for it /etc/ssl/certs/java/ and you should see cacerts. I can't guarantee this working though.\n", "Q: Laptop freezes unexpectedly I have a Lenovo T540p laptop with ubuntu 14.04.

I want to minimize writing to the SSD as much as possible, but it will mean wiping the HDD and resizing the disk to create larger partitions for both Documents and Ubuntu. \nI haven't been able to find anything specific to what I'm looking for and need advice on how to create a new dual boot system.\n\nA: It's pretty much the same as your previous configuration. The easy way to do this is to install Windows to the blank SSD without the hard drive connected, then plug the hard drive back in, create your windows partition, then install Ubuntu, selecting to install on the free space of the hard drive.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu Touch on a HP TouchPad? I have already tried searching around, and the only solutions I can find are outdated and no longer work. Does anyone have an up-to-date way of putting Ubuntu Touch onto a HP TouchPad? I have a laptop running Ubuntu 15.04 that I can use to install it onto the TouchPad, but I do not have access to a Windows machine, so anything that requires Windows is out of the question.\nI already know that people have previously been able to install Ubuntu Touch on a HP TouchPad, I want to know how to do so, as I can't find any guides and I have no idea what my first step would be.\n\nA: Yes, unfortunately Touch on HP Touchpad seems to be a back-of-the-queue for developers, (which is strange considering the number of TP's out there - natural potential hosts for Ubuntu Touch, especially now that WebOS is out of support).\nI'm not going to agree that the \"solutions are outdated\" - get yourself over to XDA-Devs (specifically Ubuntu Touch 13.10 Saucy on the HP Touchpad DUAL BOOT ANDROID) and you'll see that there's still some interest out there - last post April 2015.\nAs to first steps, and especially doing it properly, (ie without Windows), that might be tricky. I'm thinking that Novacomm (required) should work via Wine, failing that FreeDOS VM?. Once that's in place the instructions on the first page look reasonable, although I think you'll end up with WebOS/Android/Ubuntu, rather than just Ubuntu (like I guess you want).\nI've now got two \"surplus to requirements\" TP's so it's maybe possible that at least one of them will get the Ubuntu Touch treatment.

I have already checked Openstack installation on ubuntu but i saw Canonical version to install openstack. I am very confused. So please guide me to install openstack kilo on ubuntu.

After the recovery, it sent some information to Ubuntu Pastebin, something like this one.\nDoes this kind of paste contain private information?\n\nA: While the answer from Serg gives in-depth security concerns, guessing that nobody except the admin of http://paste.ubuntu.com gets the information you submit, here is the official privacy policy of the boot-repair.\n\nA: TL;DR: you're safe enough\nBoot Repair report that you have linked there only lists the layout of your hard drive and bootloader settings. This is quite low level information that reveals nothing useful about you as far as crackers are concerned. \nThe only tiny bit is on line 997, where it shows /home/adam. Users are usually assigned home folders same as their username, so this reveals your username. However, as far as an attacker is concerned, this is still nothing. Suppose you have ssh enabled or telnet enabled. Now, there is a possibility of bruteforce attack, with tools such as hydra, which basically go through multiple combinations of passwords. If  you have strong password, it will take forever for an attacker to crack it. In addition, there is no IP address of your system. A random guy online may figure out your username, but won't know where you are. Now, if there is a man-in-the-middle, then someone is intentionally would be looking at your packets, could potentially intercept this info. But in such case, you'd have a drone flying over your house or a van parked outside. You'd have to be really VIP target for this to happen. Then attacker also would need to go through your router; I suggest you have an admin password there - I've known a couple cases here on askubuntu where router settings were altered.\nIf you are still concerned about the bruteforce attack, do this: \nOpen /etc/security/limits.conf. here's how mine looks at the end :\n#<domain>      <type>  <item>         <value>\n#\n\n#*               soft    core            0\n#root            hard    core            100000\n#*               hard    rss             10000\n#@student        hard    nproc           20\n#@faculty        soft    nproc           20\n#@faculty        hard    nproc           50\n#ftp             hard    nproc           0\n#ftp             -       chroot          /ftp\n#@student        -       maxlogins       4\n\nxieerqi         hard    maxlogins       6\n# End of file\n\nSee line xieerqi ? That's my login name. This line limits amount of logins for my username on my computer, i.e, max amount of sessions open. \nNow look into /etc/login.defs . Again, here is mine :\n# \n# Max number of login retries if password is bad. This will most likely be\n# overriden by PAM, since the default pam_unix module has it's own built\n# in of 3 retries. However, this is a safe fallback in case you are using\n# an authentication module that does not enforce PAM_MAXTRIES.\n#\nLOGIN_RETRIES           3\n\nTo prevent an attacker going forever and ever guessing passwords, login page will give 3 strikes, and then terminate the connection. \nNote: to open these files for writing, you'd need sudo, like so sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf\nFor more info you can also ask this question on security.stackexchange.com . Those guys know more about security than we do here\n", "Q: How to handle google chrome external protocol when your software is on wine?

When you are browsing in the website, there is an option that loads data from browser to software, then the browser ask for external protocol for aibe:link (aibe is for Allen Institute Brain Explorer, I suppose), that ends on launch xdg-open, which as far as I know it handles the default apps.\n\nSo I guess must try config the default apps for aibe links, but honestly I'm lost. The most I figured is that is similar to magnet links with torrent. Of course on windows there is no such a problem since is designed for it. But how I make this work here on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Making it work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run gedit ~/.local/share/applications/allen-brainexplorer.desktop\n\n*A text editor will open up. Paste the following contents on it:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Brain Explorer 2\nExec=wine \"%ProgramFiles%\\Allen Institute\\Brain Explorer 2\\BrainExplorer2.exe\" \"/url\" \"%u\"\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nMimeType=x-scheme-handler/aibe;\n\n\n*Save the file and close the text editor.\n\n*Run the following command to \"install\" the newly-created file in the system:\nxdg-desktop-menu install ~/.local/share/applications/allen-brainexplorer.desktop\n\n\n*When the browser prompts you how to handle this type of link, choose Run Application.\n\n\n\nHow I got it:\nI've installed Brain Explorer 2 on a Windows XP VM so I could open the regedit and find that key:\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\aibe\\shell\\open\\command\n\nThat key had this content:\n\"C:\\Program files\\Allen Institute\\Brain Explorer 2\\BrainExplorer2.exe\" /url \"%1\"\n\nThis means that the /url option allows to pass the URL to BrainExplorer. Example:\nwine \"/home/$USER/.wine/dosdevices/drive_c/Program files/Allen Institute/Brain Explorer 2/BrainExplorer2.exe\" /url \"aibe://human.brain-map.org/mri_viewer/data/heatmap/probe_values?atlas=351&resolu‌​tion=samples&probes=1036443&selectedDonor=9861&well=2569&colormap=redgreen&exprRa‌​nge=-6,6\"\n\n"]
