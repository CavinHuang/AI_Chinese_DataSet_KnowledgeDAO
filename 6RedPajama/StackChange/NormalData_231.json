["Q: How would you label an audio track as a \"Japanese Surround 5.1\" in MP4Box or ffmpeg I have tried several methods of trying to label the track such as using \nMP4Box -lang 3=jpn file.mp4\n\nand then did\nMP4Box -name 3=\"5.1 Surround\" file.mp4\n\nand the file in VLC keeps it's label only showing \nTrack 2 [Japanese]\n\nSidenote: Yes I am selecting the right audio track I want to rename which is track 3 in the file.\n\nA: It is possible to add metadata in this manner using FFmpeg. To demonstrate this I created a test file with the following properties:\nStream #0:0(und): Video: h264 (High) (avc1 / 0x31637661) [...]\nStream #0:1(und): Audio: aac (LC) (mp4a / 0x6134706D), 44100 Hz, stereo, \n\nTo add a tag to the audio stream using FFmpeg try the following syntax:\nffmpeg -i test.mp4 -c copy \\\n          -metadata:s:a:0 language=jpn -metadata:s:a:0 title=\"5.1 Surround\" \\\n          testing.mp4\n\nSome notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*-c copy: copy both streams without encoding to a new container. FFmpeg will not actually place the tags without this process.\n\n*-metadata:s:a:0: add the metatdata to : the stream : audio : first audio track. Note that this is 0, not 1 as you might expect. Note also that the -metadata option must be repeated with each extra metadata added.\n\n\nRespect for these tags is a bit hit and miss across media players but tags added in this manner are picked up by mediainfo...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*FFmpeg Documentation: Main Options\n", "Q: User limit of inotify watches reached on Ubuntu 16.04 I just installed Ubuntu 16.04 and I get this warning when I start SmartGit:\nIOException: User limit of inotify watches reached\n\nMoreover I get this warning launching tail -f:\ntail: inotify resources exhausted \n\ntail: inotify cannot be used, reverting to polling\n\nI never get this error with Ubuntu 14.04 and applications and files I'm using on the new Ubuntu are quite the same I was using in the previous version.\nThe only relevant differences are that I added an additional Hard Disk on the PC and I configured the Ubuntu's backup tool. Can this problem be related with a second disk or with the backup tool?\n\nA: You can check the existing Limit and based on that you can alter it as per your requirement\n\nTo Check :  cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches\nTo Alter :  sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288\nThis will resolve the error.\n\nA: Above answers work great but it does not explain why which I was looking around to here my attempt for a complete answer -\nWhy?\nPrograms that sync files such as dropbox, git etc use inotify to notice changes to the file system. The limit can be see by -\ncat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches\n\nFor me, it shows 100000. When this limit is not enough to monitor all files inside a directory it throws this error.\n\nIncreasing the amount of inotify watchers(Short version):\nIf you are running Debian, RedHat, or another similar Linux distribution, run the following in a terminal:\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p\n\nIf you are running ArchLinux, run the following command instead (see here for why):\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/40-max-user-watches.conf && sudo sysctl --system\n\nThen paste it in your terminal and press on enter to run it.\n\nTechnical details:\nListen uses inotify by default on Linux to monitor directories for changes. It's not uncommon to encounter a system limit on the number of files you can monitor. For example, Ubuntu Lucid's (64bit) inotify limit is set to 8192.\nYou can get your current inotify file watch limit by executing:\n$ cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches\n\nWhen this limit is not enough to monitor all files inside a directory, the limit must be increased for Listen to work properly.\nYou can set a new limit temporary with:\n$ sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288\n$ sudo sysctl -p\n\nIf you like to make your limit permanent, use:\n$ echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n$ sudo sysctl -p\n\nYou may also need to pay attention to the values of max_queued_events and max_user_instances if Listen keeps on complaining.\nSource: https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers\n\nA: The current default on Xenial is 8192 (see fs/notify/inotify/inotify_user.c in the kernel source), you can verify this by printing the file to stdout:\ncat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches\n8192\n\nYou can bump the number up, for example, doubling this to 16384, using:\necho 16384 | sudo tee /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches\n\nbear in mind that inotify watches do consume memory, I think it's around 160 bytes per watch on 64 bit systems.\nTo set this permanently, add an entry to /etc/sysctl.conf, for example:\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=16384 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\nsudo sysctl -p\n\n..or manually edit /etc/sysctl.conf (you need root privileges to update it) and then run sudo sysctl -p\n", "Q: Running xfce4-power-manager as daemon with ubuntu 14.04 and awesome I'm running default ubuntu 14.04 in combination with awesome WM 3.5.9.

Whether or not using the sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa repository and installing sudo apt install nvidia-364 helped I do not know. But it seems that my major issue was that I had to disable secure boot in BIOS, changing from Windows to Other OS.\nSo if you have the nouveau drivers by default as I did (you can check with lshw -c video | grep -i driver where driver=nouveau would ideally be driver=nvidia, then add the above repository, sudo apt update and sudo apt install nvidia-364 with a reboot may work for you too.\nIf you do encounter the first issue my question is about, check to see whether you have secure boot mode on in BIOS and disable it if it is on. I can only hazard a guess that the nvidia drivers were defaulting to a fallback that at least allowed a GUI, though I never figured out the cause of  the problem.\nIt is also worth noting that I get this issue with my DVDROM drive plugged in via SATA cable.

It depends on Gstreamer 0.10, which is scheduled for removal from the archive.\n\nIn a related request it was suggested that Exaile be removed temporarily until it has been updated to use newer software libraries.\nSince the latest development version of Exaile appears to have been successfully updated and still requires an external moodbar command, I expect that a moodbar package will accompany Exaile's return.\n\nA: Ypu can download it from here.\nNot sure thought why it was removed (it is marked as \"deleted\" there), so pay attention when installing it (it might break something else).\n", "Q: How to delete all hidden files after execution a program I have downloaded eclipse for linux from eclipse.org. I don't really know yet, whether I've started a program properly or nor, but i just unpacked a tar.gz and clicked \"eclipse\" execution file. It has started and worked properly, before I' ve decided to change the version, so I just deleted unzipped folder, cause I've executed eclipse from it, downloaded a new version of eclipse and repeated the same with a new file. Unfortunately it works properly no more, eclipse will be started, but I see an icon of former version (java EE IDE instead of just Eclipse) of eclipse, Marketplace will be not opened, cannot install a new Software and so on... I believe, there are any hidden files, as config or something else, which embarrassing a using of other versions of eclipse, which were executed previously. I also deleted an .eclipse from root/, but have no any improvements. Are any methods, to delete all files from previous executions of eclipse?\n\nA: To find files you could run 'locate eclipse'. Also try 'which eclipse' to make sure you're running what you think you are. If you're not running the program as root, deleting .eclipse from /root will probably have no effect.

What I want is to have it automatically show Downloads folder window.\nSo basically, when I click on \"Show in Folder\", I should directly see the 'Downloads' folder, rather than having to click on the Files icon.\nI searched this site for this question and could only find this: Popping up the folder when clicking \"Show in Folder\", which does not have an answer.

Using wget or by downloading the .deb package from http://www.opera.com/computer/linux ?  There was a bug in Ubuntu 16.04 Software Center that was not allowing .deb packages to be installed so the workaround was opening a terminal, entering sudo dpkg -i and dragging the downloaded .deb file onto the terminal to install Opera. Source: Problem with deb packages on Ubuntu 16.04.\nIn dash, try searching for 'browser' and see if Opera and other browsers are listed.  If not, open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter sudo apt-get update followed by sudo apt-get upgrade.  Then try to install Opera again.  You may have to remove Opera first if it did indeed install with sudo apt-get remove opera-stable.\n", "Q: Use DD to clone only Linux partition to external USB drive? I have a 1 TB internal drive that has two 1/2 TB partitions, one for Windows and the other for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  The station has become primarily a Linux station and I never boot into Windows anymore.\nI wanted to create an image backup so I used DD to clone the internal drive to an external 1 TB USB drive.  Unfortunately the USB drive appears to be just a few Gigabytes shy of the internal drive and DD ended with a \"Not enough space on drive\" error message.  Now I am seeing something odd.  When I ejected the USB drive and plugged it back in, I see two 1/2 GB partitions that appear to be duplicates.  They have identical GUID's and Nautilus shows identical directory structures and content.  I'm guessing that something about the incomplete copy of one of the partitions has left the external drive in a broken state.\nHow can I use DD to just clone the Linux partition to the external drive?  That's all I really want.  \n\nA: As first you need to find out data about your HDD, you can do this by typing in terminal:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou should get an output like this:\nDisk /dev/sda: 149,1 GiB, 160041885696 bytes, 312581808 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0x06bd4abe\n\nDevice     Boot     Start       End   Sectors   Size Id Type\n/dev/sda1  *         2048 230055935 230053888 109,7G 83 Linux\n/dev/sda2       292970494 312580095  19609602   9,4G  5 Extended\n/dev/sda3       230055936 292968447  62912512    30G 83 Linux\n/dev/sda5       292970496 312580095  19609600   9,4G 82 Linux swap / Solaris\n\nPartition table entries are not in disk order.\n\nSo lets say /dev/sda3 is the drive you want to clone, then you can do:\ndd bs=512 if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb1/partition.ddfile seek=230055936 count=$(expr 292968447 - 230055936)\n\nRemind this here are only examples you would need to fit that to your situation.\n\nA: Easier way:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo fdisk -l as said by Videonath. Locate the partition you wish to clone\n\n*dd bs=512 if=/dev/<partition-name> of=/<external-media-path>\ne.g.dd bs=512 if=/dev/sda2 of=/dev/sdb1\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*dd requires the size of the target to be grater or equal to the size\nof the source\n\n*The backup created this way (partition level) would not\nbe bootable\n\n\nA: While you ask about dd, may I recommend partclone? It is made to clone and restore a partition. It needs to be aware of the underlying filesystem, advantage over dd is that it copies only the used blocks and saves a lot of time or space, since it is rare that the unused part of a partition is compressible (old data garbage instead of zeroes).\nsudo partclone.ext4 -c -b -s /dev/sdaX -o /dev/sdbY \n\nwill do what you want. -c stands for clone, -b for device-to-device, -s is source, -o is target. Also, since you did a clone, the UUIDs of source and target are identical. Check this with blkid, use uuidgen to generate a new UUID and then sudo tune2fs /dev/sdbY -U <uuidgen-generated new UUID> to change it.\nHaving two identical UUIDs on the same machine could even be the root cause of the issues you had with the 'broken' state of the external device. \nBefore you do this, the target device needs to be set up with fdisk so that the new partition is not smaller than the old partition. If it is larger, you can grow the cloned partition afterwards with gparted to the new maximum size.\n", "Q: Cannot connect laptop to TV via HDMI My laptop is connected to TV via HDMI.

In your case, the directory vlsi is not in the current directory, but in your home directory.

However, none of the documented methods result in port 22 being open after the first boot.\nSpecifically, I've tried variations of the following lines:\nufw     ufw/enable      boolean true\nufw     ufw/allow_custom_ports  string 22/tcp\nufw     ufw/allow_known_ports  string 22/tcp\nufw     ufw/allow_known_ports   string  SSH\n\nBut none of them seemed to make a difference. Additionally, my attempts to add the rule in the post-install section failed as the iptables kernel module is not loaded, resulting in an error.\nIs this possible to accomplish within the preseed file? Or should I just give up and enable the firewall on boot with a hack?\n\nA: I have been trying to get this working for a while, too. Nothing seems to work. Until I finally gave up and I fixed it with a simple rc.local workaround:\nd-i preseed/late_command string \\\n    mv /target/etc/rc.local /target/etc/rc.local.orig; \\\n    echo '#!/bin/sh -e' > /target/etc/rc.local; \\\n    echo '/usr/sbin/ufw allow ssh' >> /target/etc/rc.local; \\\n    echo 'mv -f /etc/rc.local.orig /etc/rc.local' >> /target/etc/rc.local; \\\n    echo 'test -x /etc/rc.local && /etc/rc.local' >> /target/etc/rc.local; \\\n    echo 'exit 0' >> /target/etc/rc.local; \\\n    chmod +x /target/etc/rc.local\n\nThe workaround will add a custom rc.local script using preseed/late_command which will:\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of the original rc.local as rc.local.orig (using mv)\n\n\n*Then new rc.local is created -- which is a script that will be executed on the first boot up of the system\n\n\n*The new script will:\n\n*\n\n*Enable SSH access using ufw\n\n*Restore the original rc.local (by moving rc.local.orig to rc.local, deleting itself)\n\n*Test if the original rc.local is executable and run it\n\n*Exit successfully\n\n\n\n", "Q: \"Could not set interface wlan0 flags (UP): Input/output error\" RT3290 I've encountered a very puzzling issue with my WiFi card on Ubuntu. After reboot it's always disabled and there is no way to bring it back other than suspending or shutting down the laptop. Status according to Network Manager is \"device not ready\". This occurs consistently.\nSome background on my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*The laptop is HP 350 G1.\n\n*The WLAN card is the infamous Ralink RT3290. (If I knew how much trouble I would have with it I would never have bought it).\n\n*Ubuntu is the latest LTS 16.04, recently upgraded.\n\n*Kernel is 4.4.9-040409-generic (was 4.4.0-22-generic before upgrading from mainline - no difference wrt WiFi).\n\n\nBefore upgrading the distro, I was using a version of the rt3290sta/2.6.0.0 driver (compiled from source and loaded via DKMS) which performed mostly fine, but it doesn't work with the newer kernels and it seems abandoned anyway. So now I had to revert to rt2800 and have this problem since.\nThis seems to be a very old but recurring issue. I read through all threads I could find, but so far no luck.

You cannot merge the unallocated space to partitions unless it is right next to the partition. \n\nA: Simply you cannot alter the partition on which the current OS is running.\nThe solution is to make a bootable DVD or USB and boot your system with it. then you can alter the partition (sda1).\nYet, you should be careful about one thing: most probably the UUID of sda1 will get changed after alteration. Therefore, you should update you fstab and grub for the new UUID.\n\nA: I think the simple solution is, back up all your data on the current partition, delete them all, recreate new one.\n", "Q: Replace Windows 7 Entirely W/ Ubuntu & Security Feature Allows Wildows Files? \n*\n\n*If Ubuntu supports files from windows, doesn't this defeat the \"security\" of Ubuntu?

They are\n    compiled using Windows libraries and executed natively only in\n    Windows. Same applies to viruses since they are compiled\n    specifically for Windows.

I'm just having some issues trying to get my laptop to display on my projector using USB streaming. I'm using a USB connection only between the projector and computer with no adapters. I'm not able to use a VGA or HDMI connection as my projector input pins are broken/bent for VGA/HDMI.\nOn Windows, when the projector is connected the driver automatically loads and displays the second screen. When I connect in Xubunutu, it recognizes another driver/CD has been mounted.\nI'm still very new to Ubuntu I would prefer using it over Windows. Is there any driver or application I can run to help me get USB streaming work?\n\nA: After some research, your projector is USB compatible with Windows and Mac OS see page 23 of the user manual: \nftp://downloads.benq.net/user_manuals/projectors/english/projector_um_user_manual_20120331_114457_gp2_en.pdf\nThere are no linux drivers listed on the downloads page: http://www2.benq.us/product/projector/joybeegp2/downloads/\nThe mini HDMI port (1.3) is not a part of the multi-input socket/wires (input 11) but is separate (input 12) per the user manual page 9.  There has been reported success with the HDMI input working with Ubuntu, thereby projecting to the projector, however, I did not discover any positive results for using this projector with Ubuntu or other distros via USB.\nIt may be possible to contact Benq for a replacement or repair of the projector pins or the multi-input wires/pins, though this model has been discontinued.

Every tutorial I've read basically has you download the installer as a tar.gz extract and then run the installer or application. When I follow these steps I can't run the eclipse file. I have oracle JRE and JDK 8 installed so I'm not exactly sure what is going on here and why I can't run it.\nAnyway any help is appreciated, and I've attached a screenshot to get more of an idea what it looks like:\n\n\nA: So currently with Eclipse on 16.04 there is a known GTK3 issue. There are a number of ways to work around this issue, but it looks like you just want to click Eclipse icon and work away. In your eclipse directory as above, open the eclipse.ini file. Add:\n--launcher.GTK_version\n2\n\nbefore --launcher.appendVmargs \nThis will tell eclipse to launch with GTK2 instead. \nAs you're upgrading Eclipse by not using the Ubuntu repos (a very good move, MARS has a very retina friendly dark theme) when you try to run Eclipse you may get prompted for a jre. Simply unzip your latest downloaded JDK and open it to find the jre folder. Copy and paste the jre folder into your eclipse directory. Double click the eclipse icon and it should run perfectly. \n\nA: Don't know what the issue is with your installation, but if you run the \"eclipse\" executable (you know, the one with the gear icon) it should work.\nHowever, you might like to check out \"ubuntu make\" (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-make) to install eclipse. Then you get a nice starter in your dash/launcher.\n", "Q: Is it possible to control app volume from taskbar? I currently have Pulse Audio Volume Control and I'm using it to control audio between my laptop & external monitor as well as volume of different apps.\nIs there a faster way of controlling these (especially app volumes), from the music/sound taskbar for example?\nI am open to experiment with other ways.\n\nA: As of writing I have not found a solution for Ubuntu Unity.

I have searched, One solution I found is static IP for Virtual Machine on bridge interface. But It is not the solution for me. I am wondering if there is any way to block virtual machine traffic both with NAT and Bridge Interface (without static IP)?\n\nA: One alternative would be to block traffic using MAC address filtering. So, you would basically need to get the MAC address of the network interface you want to block, and then use an iptables rule such as the following:\niptables -I INPUT -m mac --mac-source 1E:2B:65:48:54:AD -j REJECT\n\nThe above rule will block all incoming traffic from the specified MAC address. If you simply wanted to block traffic to a specific port, you could do something like this:\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m mac --mac-source 1E:2B:65:48:54:AD -j REJECT\n\n", "Q: Which USB boot selection do I use? I have Ubuntu burned onto a USB and when i enter into my bios it gives me 4 different options for usb- Zip, FDD, CD ROM , and HDD. Which one would i use?\n\nA: In my experience, either USB-FDD or USB-HDD is what you want to choose. I believe it depends on how the flash drive is formatted. FAT32 and any derivatives or similar ones (ie, exFAT and FAT) will probably be the USB-FDD option, while NTFS and EXT formatted flash drives will boot when the USB-HDD option is selected.\nThis is something that I often test multiple times.

I tried all of those suggestions, plus I also installed network-manager_1.2.0-0, all to no avail.\nThe issue I am requesting help on is specifically that wifi completely stops working whenever I attempt to switch networks. \nI am adding a bounty and the results from the wifi script on ubuntuforums.  Also, please note that I installed iwlwifi-7260-17.\nI also am aware of the suggestions in bug report #1574347 (I posted on that report on post #8, although I think that the bug report is for the suspend-resume issue not my changing APs issue). In all events, I tried the suggestions to upgrade network-manager and network-manager-gnome (see post #42), to no avail.  \nI also am aware of bug report #1311257 and the suggested script to fix that bug.  I implemented that script and regressed back to the suspend-resume issue.  \n\n\nA: You have upgraded to the latest LTS version of Ubuntu, and like many you have been having problems with Wi-Fi. You experienced loss of Wi-Fi on resuming from suspend. This was due to bug 1574347,  bug 1311257 or some combination of the two. You found a workaround that worked. However when you switch networks you again lose Wi-Fi connectivity with NetworkManager not seeing any Wi-Fi access points. What should you do?\nThe following is the approach I would recommend.\n\n\n*\n\n*Research the problem\n\n*Ask for help\n\n*Raise a bug report\n\n*Seriously consider whether you need the latest LTS version of Ubuntu\n\n*Try an alternative to GNOME Network Manager\n\n*Control your Wi-Fi from the terminal.\n\n\nStep 1 You tried researching the problem. You did not find anything about this issue on the internet.\nStep 2 You posted this question on Ask Ubuntu. You posted the results of running the Ubuntu Forums WiFi diagnosis script and a screenshot of your screen. When you did not get a response you posted a bounty on the question. All great moves on your part. We have chatted about your problem and I have analysed your WiFi script results in detail. Apart from a couple of kernel error messages apparently related to the suspend/ resume issue the results show working Wi-Fi that is just not connected to an Access Point.\nStep 3 This is clearly a bug in GNOME Network Manager so create a bug report. The developers need bug reports to find an eliminate errors in the code. You do this by typing ubuntu-bug network-managerin a terminal.\nStep 4. Seriously consider reverting to your previous version of Ubuntu. Adding LTS to the name of a release does not make it of higher quality than any other release. What creates the quality is the amount of testing it has undergone. LTS releases are used by much greater numbers of users than development releases so once they are live they are much more thoroughly tested. As 16.04 LTS has been live for less than a month it will have far more bugs than say 14.04 LTS. On Windows my policy was never to use an operating system release until it had been live for at least a year so other people found the bugs. In your case you need a recent kernel to solve another issue so you want to stick with 16.04.\nStep 5. Looking at the bug list for GNOME network manager it is clear that they are actively working on a significant number of bugs. It is going to take some time for them to address all the serious ones. Consider replacing the GNOME network manager with another one. Wicd does not appear to be being actively developed but network management standards have been stable for years. I would recommend trying this as it does not depend on GNOME and is unlikely to have the same issue. You have tried Wicd in the past and have issues with it so you would like an alternative approach.\nStep 6. You don't actually need a network manager to get Wi-Fi connectivity. You can use a terminal. Detailed instructions are here. Connecting to WPA Wi-Fi from the terminal\n\nA: I wanted to report that I never fixed this issue on the particular install of 16.04 that I was running. Luckily, I had 16.04 installed on another computer and used systemback to make a copy and install it on a test partition.

I can do startx and my desktop comes up, my icons are as I had them before the upgrade, but there is no launcher, windows have no decorations, and I cannot change between windows, only the last opened window is active. Otherwise things work fine, including the screen resolution.\nI went through all the suggestions I could find. Reinstalled unity, lightdm, tried other managers, desktops. I even deleted xorg.conf so that it would be regenerated, but it wasn't: it is always xorg.failsafe that is generated.\nSo it looks to me that for some reason X-Server always wants to boot into failsafe mode. Probably because of the graphical login prompt, since the animation before that works, and the X-Server after that also works.\nI haven't found anything reasonable in the X-Server logs.\nWhere should I look for a solution?

I have read the post on \"What is suspend\". \nHowever, I would like to know exactly which ACPI Global State does pressing the Suspend button lead to. Can someone explain this?\nSpecifically, how do I know if pressing the Suspend button in Ubuntu 16.04 will lead to S1, S2, S3, S4, or S5? Is this determined by setting in the UEFI/BIOS or Ubuntu or both?\n\nA: It depends on Ubuntu (and the BIOS capabilities). It couldn't be any other way because the operating system needs to coordinate a great deal of things to enter any state above S2. The BIOS may however inform the operating system that it would like to enter a particular state.\nThere are two suspension modes in Ubuntu, Linux and modern PCs in general:\n\n\n*\n\n*Suspend-to-RAM (ACPI S3) powers off the CPU and all other devices unless they indicate that they need to stay on in S3. The main memory (RAM) retains its power supply and maintains the system state for later resumption.\n\n*Suspend-to-disk or \"hibernate\" (ACPI S4) saves the system state to a non-volatile storage medium, typically a hard drive or SSD, and powers off the system entirely. The operating system can see the stored system image on reboot and choose to resume from it.\nIt's not enabled or exposed to Ubuntu desktop users by default these days.\nThe other ACPI global states you mention are:\n\n\n*\n\n*S1 and S2 are states with less power saving potential but quicker resumption. These are not typically considered suspension state but a computer may choose to enter them automatically as soon as the CPU is unused for a few milliseconds. This is typically done by the CPU and BIOS without direct interaction of the operating system.\n\n*Power-off (S5) means exactly what you'd think it does.\n(Source)\n\nA: Q1. How do I know if pressing the Suspend button in Ubuntu 16.04 will lead to S1, S2, S3, S4, or S5? \nAns1: On my system, I found the information in the file /proc/acpi/wakeup. Also, the commands acpitool -w or acpitool -e present the same information as that found in /proc/acpi/wakeup. \nQ2. Is this (i.e. ACPI Global State) determined by settings in the UEFI/BIOS or Ubuntu or both? \nAns2: The answer is UEFI/BIOS. It is possible to amend the UEFI/BIOS defined ACPI Global State in Ubuntu, however any changes are only to be done for debugging and development purposes. \nAccording to  Linux/ACPI, \"DSDT modification is for debugging and development only\". Also, \"DSDT is an acronym for Differentiated System Description Table. This table contains the Differentiated Definition Block, which supplies the information and configuration information about the base system. It is always inserted into the ACPI Namespace by the OS at boot time.\". \nAccording to IntelOpenSource.org Linux*-ACPI:\n\nThe DSDT (Differentiated System Description Table) is the primary AML\n  table in the BIOS. Per the description of acpidump, the DSDT can be\n  extracted from the machine, the ASL modified, and a new AML DSDT can\n  be compiled. The sections below show two ways to tell Linux to use\n  this modified DSDT instead of the version that came with the BIOS.\nNote that overriding the DSDT is a debugging technique only. It is not\n  a viable way to run a production system, as no vendor would support a\n  system when the customer has modified the system firmware, and no\n  Linux Distributor could possibly support modified system firmware\n  either.\nIn the early days of Linux ACPI, DSDT modifications were common to\n  work around both BIOS bugs and Linux bugs. However, the stated goal of\n  the Linux ACPI project today is that Linux should run on unmodified\n  firmware. Thus, the DSDT database at the old\n  acpi.sourceforge.net web site is now largely a historical\n  artifact.\n\nFor detail understanding on ACPI and the Global state and S-states, a good read is the \"Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Specification\" from www.acpi.info. \n\nA: From my experience, suspension state will be determined by BIOS. On one of my PCs the power state in BIOS can be set to 'S3' or 'Disabled'. Setting 'S3' makes the PC to go into suspension/'stand by'. Setting it to 'Disabled' makes the PC to go into S1, because the processor's fan keeps spinning. Hibernation is always 'S4', as well as power off - 'S5'.\n", "Q: Installing Steam on Ubuntu 16.04 x64, 32 bit Package Problems When I try to install Steam on my Ubuntu 16.04 x64, I see these errors.\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\nsteam:i386 : \nDepends: libc6:i386 (>= 2.15) but it is not going to be installed\n\nDepends: libstdc++6:i386 (>= 4.3) but it is not going to be installed\nDepends: libx11-6:i386 but it is not going to be installed\n\nDepends: libudev1:i386 but it is not going to be installed\n\nDepends: libxinerama1:i386 but it is not going to be installed\n\nDepends: libtxc-dxtn0:i386\n\nDepends: libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 but it is not going to be installed\n\nDepends: libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 but it is not going to be installed\nsteam-launcher : \nDepends: python-apt but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unmet dependencies.

There are these pre-configured home screens called Scopes on the BQ M10 Ubuntu Edition tablet. After some research I've finally got an idea what scopes are meant for.\nWith understanding the concept of Scopes, the desire to adjust these Scopes to one's own needs arises. However, I can't figure out how to actually customize a Scope's content. Lets consider the News Scope. When opening the settings dialogue, a list of international news resources is displayed. All content resources are activated by default. All I can 'configure' here is to check or uncheck the defaults. However, living neither in an English nor Spanish speaking region, I'd rather add my own news resources to that scope. \nHow to do this? \nThe Location Scope appears as useless to me, too. Again, how to include customized content sources in there? Are Scopes actually meant to be customized? \n\nA: With one of the scopes open, swipe up from the bottom of the screen. You'll see the list of scopes starting with the enabled ones. Click on the star on the right to toggle whether a scope shows or not. \nThe sources contributing to each scope can also be changed with the settings button you found. If the source you're interested in is not available perhaps you could use the RSS scope?\nMore scopes may be found in the Ubuntu store but the selection is not exhaustive (yet)\n", "Q: gnucash crashes (2.6.12-1) gnucash 2.6.12-1 with Ubuntu 16.04.\nThis version was installed on May 5th and worked until today when I got an update of metacity (whatever that is).\nI have reinstalled gnucash, but the error remains the same.\n$ gnucash\nFound Finance::Quote version 1.38\n*** Error in `gnucash': free(): invalid pointer: 0x000056431b7b3960 ***\n======= Backtrace: =========\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(+0x77725)[0x7f5aa25de725]\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(+0x7ff4a)[0x7f5aa25e6f4a]\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(cfree+0x4c)[0x7f5aa25eaabc]\n...\n\n\nA: I had the same issue.

In this way, there is no need for GnuCash on Windows to delete the recurring transactions.\n\nA: Thank you, heemayl, for the editing.\nI have found the cause of the invalid pointer. Some of the scheduled transactions were corrupted (I don't know how that happened or if it was related to my upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04). \nI noticed it when I opened my data file with the windows version of gnucash.

And they are not available via Dash search anymore, which they used to be in the releases mentioned before.\nHow to make Chrome Apps behave like native apps in Ubuntu 16.04 again?\n\nA: It looks like the problem your referring to is a bug in Chromium. Until it is fixed you could use Google Chrome which does not have this bug.\nUpdate: Now the bug is fixed for me with the latest version of Chromium.\n\nA: If you upgraded from previous release (it sounds you did) you may try to clear your config files with \nmv ~/.config/google-chrome ~/.config/google-chrome-backup\nand maybe also clear the app shortcuts with \nmkdir ~/.local/share/applications-backup && mv ~/.local/share/applications/chrome* ~/.local/share/applications-backup\n(both commands should create a backup of those config files).\nSince the feature in question worked for me after fresh install of 16.04 I suspect some debris from your previous installs may cause your issue.\n", "Q: getty/mingetty automatic login 16.04 I have an nfsroot created from 14.04 that I am rebuilding using 16.04.  My nfsroot is shared by three systems named pc1,pc2 and pc3.  There are 3 matching user accounts named pc1, pc2, and pc3 as well.  \nWhen these systems boot up they automatically log in and subsequently run a bash login script.\nIn 14.04 I replaced mingetty in my upstart tty1.conf file as follows:\n# tty1 - getty\n#\n# This service maintains a getty on tty1 from the point the system is\n# started until it is shut down again.\n\nstart on stopped rc RUNLEVEL=[2345] and (\n        not-container or\n        container CONTAINER=lxc or\n        container CONTAINER=lxc-libvirt)\n\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nrespawn\n#exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1\nscript\n    exec /sbin/mingetty --autologin `cat /proc/sys/kernel/hostname` --noclear tty1\nend script\n\nThis worked just fine in 14.04 for my purposes.  It gleans the hostname from /proc and then uses that as the login name.  \nWhat I am trying to do is replicate the same behaviour in 16.04, but now using systemd.To do so I modified /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants.  Specifically I changed the ExecStart:\nExecStart=-/sbin/agetty -a $HOSTNAME --noclear %I $TERM\n\nHowever from reading the systemd docs and using some google-fu I have leared that I cannot use backticks or environment variable substitution in the ExecStart line.  I have tested hard coding a user account instead and it works correctly, but I can't figure out how to do the same thing I was doing previously with upstart in systemd.\nI've also tried using a small script for this purpose as well by changing the ExecStart line to:\nExecStart=/bin/sh -c \"/usr/bin/autogetty.sh\"\n\nThe autogetty.sh script is simple script which cats to get the hostname and feeds it to mingetty.  It however doesn't appear to work.  I think the issue may be that for the service, the type is idle and from my researching online it needs to be fork.  I have yet to try modifying the service type yet.  \nI would like to know the \"right way\" to do this.  So far I'm just trying things to make it work, and even if I make it work I won't be sure if its the best way of doing it.\nThanks. \n\nA: Wrong ideas and errors\n\nI have leared that I cannot use backticks or environment variable substitution in the ExecStart line.\n\nYou have learned a falsehood.  The doco does not in fact say this.  You can use environment variable substitution (with a syntax that is subtly different to most Unix shells').  It is simply the case that there is no HOSTNAME environment variable to substitute.  Service processes are not spawned with such an environment variable set up.\nUnit files are parameterizable, and the %H parameter expands to the (dynamic) host name as it was at the point in the past that the unit was loaded from file.\n\nExecStart=/bin/sh -c \"/usr/bin/autogetty.sh\"[…] I have yet to try modifying the service type yet.\n\nGood.  Do not.  That's the wrong thing to do.  Only change the readiness notification protocol to forking if your service actually implements that protocol.  Don't do it as a kludge because you have erroneously made a program that forks for no good reason.\nBecause that's exactly what you have done.  The unnecessary /bin/sh is forking a child to run autogetty.sh, which ends up being a second shell process running that shell script.  The second shell process is then forking to run mingetty as a grandchild.  This does not match the forking readiness protocol anyway, as that relies upon fork followed by exit in the parent.\nTake a lesson from the world of daemontools:  Services are run, not spawned.  The program that you run as ExecStart should be the service process, not something that spawns the service process.\nThe right way\nThe right way to set things up is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Override a specific instance of the template, for the specific terminal device, not the whole template.\n\n*Use %H to obtain the host name in ExecStart.  Or use %m and the machine ID as your user account names.\n\n*Invoke things properly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just run agetty directly, for best results.  You don't actually need any scripting for the task as described at all.\n\n*If you do nonetheless choose to insert a superfluous wrapper script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use /bin/sh -c scriptfile.  Just make scriptfile executable, with a properly specified script interpreter, and run it directly.\n\n*Make sure that your script uses exec to become the dæmon getty process.\n\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Werner Fink and Karel Zak. agetty.

Now I'm getting a black screen to login to. There I apparently need to put in two things my password and before something else, but I don't know what.\nDoes somebody know what I mean?\nI don't even know what'll happen after that, but probably I need to login first.\n\n\n\nA: Two words : \"FRESH INSTALL\".\nIt's the safest thing to do. Upgrading to a newer version of ubuntu always has problems. The best thing to do is to have a separate partition for /home. Follow this guide to do that when installing ubuntu from a scratch:\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/installseparatehome\nIf you've already installed ubuntu and wanna make a separate partition for home then :\nhttp://psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome\nNext time a never ubuntu distro comes out but you wanna preserve all your files and settings from the previous installation :\n\n\n*\n\n*In the type of installation choose \"Something else\".\n\n*Delete the previous / partition and also delete any /boot or swap partition if any.\n\n*Next follow the aforementioned guide except do not delete the existing /home partition. Click on the /home partition and click change/edit button. It should be set to \"do not use\". Change it and set the type as ext4 and mount point as /home.\n\n*In the user info page of installation set the username to EXACTLY THE SAME AS YOUR PREVIOUS USERNAME(and don't even change the case).\nOnce the installation is over you'll have to re-install all of your previous programs BUT your settings and preferences will have been saved so not much hassle. All the apps after re-installation will be they way they were before the new os installation.

But, you may only get one try (because rewriting the partition table and formatting the partitions will overwrite some data), so don't start that process until you have a proven method in hand.\nThe easiest way to get your data back would be to remove the hard disk from the machine and take it to a computer repair center for data recovery (or take the whole computer in).  That will be expensive, but if the data is that important, it may be worth doing.\n\nA: There are some software for data recovery.\nI personally used \"UFS Explorer Personal Recovery\" a few years ago, and it worked. It is not expensive, and saved me a lot of data.\nBut first, do not use your computer.

I am running Ubuntu 15.10 and already have memcached installed on my system. My current project requirement is to run two instances of memcached on the same server but with different ports. I start with /etc/memcached.conf file and check that it has option of specifying the port number. So, I thought I just need to have two identical conf files with different port numbers. \nThen I check the memcached start up script /etc/init.d/memcached so that I could specify the location of the conf files. But to my surprise I see that the start up script already has an option to run multiple memcached instances. \n# Usage:\n# cp /etc/memcached.conf /etc/memcached_server1.conf\n# cp /etc/memcached.conf /etc/memcached_server2.conf\n# start all instances:\n# /etc/init.d/memcached start\n# start one instance:\n# /etc/init.d/memcached start server1\n# stop all instances:\n# /etc/init.d/memcached stop\n# stop one instance:\n# /etc/init.d/memcached stop server1\n# There is no \"status\" command.\n\nFILES=(/etc/memcached_*.conf)\n# check for alternative config schema\nif [ -r \"${FILES[0]}\" ]; then\n\nI tried the above option, but it still keeps starting a single instance, instead of starting two instances. Am I missing something here ?\n\nA: As Robert Bihlmeyer said on https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=784357#13, a simple solution is to remove /lib/systemd/system/memcached.service.\nWithout this file, the systemd falls back on /etc/init.d/memcached, which supports multiple configurations.\nI confirmed this problem on Ubuntu 16.04 and solved it this way.\n\nA: This can easily be done by creating a file /lib/systemd/system/memcached@.service with basically the same contents as the memcached.service file with a few small changes:\n[Unit]\nDescription=memcached daemon for %i\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/share/memcached/scripts/systemd-memcached-wrapper /etc/memcached_%i.conf\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nYou can then use systemctl to manage each service individually:\nsystemctl enable memcached@server1\n\nsystemctl start memcached@server2\n\n\nA: Having the same issue in Debian Jessie. Will report back if I find a solution.\nIn the mean time you can manually start the services to achieve the desired result.\nExample:\nsudo /etc/init.d/memcached stop\nmemcached -d -m 64 -l 127.0.0.1 -p 11211 -u memcache\nmemcached -d -m 64 -l 127.0.0.2 -p 11211 -u memcache\n\nUpdate 1: Aha! There is a bug in Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=784357. Could this also affect Ubuntu?\n\nA: Run the follow command to configure multiple Memcached instances on ubuntu 16.04 server\nsudo cp /etc/memcached.conf /etc/memcached_11212.conf\nsudo vim /etc/memcached_11212.conf\nNote: change the port from 11211 to 11212 or another port which you want.\n\nsudo cp /lib/systemd/system/memcached.service /lib/systemd/system/memcached2.service\nsudo vim /lib/systemd/system/memcached2.service\nNote: change /etc/memcached.conf to /etc/memcached_11212.conf\n\nsudo systemctl start memcached2.service\nsudo systemctl status memcached2.service\nsudo netstat -tulpan | grep memcached\n", "Q: How to downgrade smbclient I'm trying to downgrade smbclient as is no longer working with backuppc.

(this one is still installed)\nOn my work I used 'Startup Disk Creator' in Ubuntu 15.10 to create an installation disk on an external SSD. The iso files are downloaded from the original ubuntu website. And selected the amd64 desktop versions (not mac versions). \nWhen booting from my external SSD installation disk. In the grub menu I had to press 'e' to edit the boot command. Because without de option nomodeset Ubuntu would not start and the installation would not begin.\nI have first tried to install Ubuntu with the option \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\". But when I did this my MacBookPro did show a folder with a question mark (?). So I had to tried something else:\nI started Ubuntu from my external SSD installation disk with nomodeset on. Here I configured my internal SSD with the following structure:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 | fat32 | 512MB | (efi)\n\n*/dev/sda2 | ext4 | 1024MB | (boot)\n\n*/dev/sda3 | lvm2 pv | remaining GB | (vg0)\n\n\n*\n\n*(lv)home | 50GB\n\n*(lv)root | 30GB\n\n*(lv)swap | 8GB\n\n\n\nThen I started the installer and selected \"Something else\" for installation.

I've downloaded ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso.  When I run \"Startup Disk Creator\" and select ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso to write to my usb stick.  Then I restart, change my bios to boot from the SANDISK USB.  I end up in a live CD of ubuntu 12.04.  Which is what I already have.  I know I'm running on the usb stick as my desktop is clean and my background image is missing.  System Settings Details shows ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nI have used gparted to create partitions on another usb stick, then used dd to copy the iso file to the usb device.  Then rebooted, again selecting the SANDISK USB in the bios. And do end up in an ubuntu 16.04 LTS live usb drive.  But if I'm having this problem then perhaps others are too?\nFor some reason it appears that Startup Disk Creator for ubuntu 12.04 doesn't write the selected iso file?  Also SDC does not show a version number.\n\nA: Startup-Disk-Creator works best when running on the same version as the ISO being used.  It does not even successfully create a bootable ISO for Ubuntu 16.04 when run on a 14.04 system, so failure on 12.04 is no surprise.  The bugs on this behavior are years old, do add yourself to the \"does this affect me\" lists.  As you have discovered, dd is the common workaround, and with perfect media, it works fine.  \nThe problems Startup Disk Creator has result from using some files from a running system instead of just files from the ISO.  These files can be the wrong version, and can fail.  Another issue the the apparent reliance upon filesystem links, which are in the ISO's iso9660 filesystem, but cannot be used on a FAT filesystem.  Just copying the files from the ISO (loop mounted) to the USB (FAT filesystem) misses the \"ubuntu\" link, and results in a kernel argument reference to \"/cdrom/preseed/...\" which does not exist.  Removing that reference in the grub.cfg will result in a UEFI bootable USB.  \nThe newer mkusb media creator does the dd copy, with more safety features to ensure you select the correct target.  \n", "Q: Creating an executable If I open a terminal and type the following then firefox opens with the webapp running:\n./refine\n\nSo I have added the following to a txt file, changed the txt file property to an executable - but I do not get the same behaviour - actually nothing happens:\n#! /bin/bash\n\n./refine\n\nSo that the pathway is explicit I've amended the above to the following - the files are all in Home:\n#! /bin/bash\n\n~/Downloads/openrefine-2.6-beta.1/refine\n\nWhen I double click the executable and I choose run in terminal, the terminal opens and then closes straight away.

And what do I have to fix so that I can run \"lxd init\"?\nI removed lxc1, uninstalled lxd and reinstalled it, all without success.\nI finally uninstalled lxd with a \"purge\" option and removed the /var/lib/lxd and /var/log/lxd directories, before reinstalling lxd and lxd-client.  Now I can run \"lxd init\", but it didn't create the lxdbr0 bridge.\n\nA: There are two questions here, I'll try to help.\nlxd init requires the LXD installation to be brand new with no containers already created. The command you're looking for is dpkg-reconfigure -p medium lxd which will allow for reconfiguration of the network bridge.\nYou can also use this command to address your second issue and try again to create the bridge.\n\nA: I ended up having to do the uninstall purge and apt-get autoclean. The only difference is that I set my /etc/network/interfaces back to the original and did a uninstall purge on bridge-utils as well.

Running man find will bring up the man pages for the find command showing more options available.\n/ is the starting point where find is going to start looking.  find is a recursive application meaning that it will look through all folders.\n-type d means that we want it to only return directories.  -type f would mean files.\n-uid $(id -u <username>) is we want the UID number of the user from the sub-shell command of id -u <username>.  Enclosing the command in the $() is the sub-shell allowing us to grab the output of the command.  If you ran the command by itself as id -u root it will return a 0 as that is the UID of the root user.

Apparently they are severely understaffed, and don't have barely enough time to keep the project on life-support. If you are also facing this issue, try reverting back to XQuartz 2.7.8, as that worked for someone in the bug report.\nYour other options could be to use VNC, as Amias Channer suggested.\nhttps://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93953#c6\nAs per the lead developer for XQuartz:\n\nGiven that the issue is with indirect rendering, it is either a change\n  in xorg-server in XQuartz or a change in libGL or the X11 stack on the\n  remote system.  My hunch is that the remote libGL changed and possibly\n  something in XQuartz's IGLX support changed.  If you can try running\n  older versions of XQuartz to see if it works with an older version of\n  XQuartz, that might point to a change that could be made to get this\n  working again.  Although as I mentioned, IGLX is on life support in\n  general, not just in XQuartz.\n\nAnd:\n\nYeah, as I mentioned in the bug report, there's not much chance of\n  things like this getting fixed soon because there aren't many people\n  working on the project.  I have maybe 2-3 hours every month or so,\n  which is about just enough time to pull in security fixes, do some\n  testing, and send out an update.  Adding support for OpenGL Core in\n  our direct rendering path is more work than I can sign up for.  What\n  you are asking for is adding it to the indirect rendering path, and\n  that's even less likely to ever happen.  Xorg is actively deprecating\n  AIGLX and even removing it from the default configuration, so I\n  suspect the solution there will be to just remove support for AIGLX\n  completely.\n\n\nA: NV-GLX suggests it is looking for NVIDIA OpenGL acceleration \nWhich would mean the ubuntu machine is trying to find 3D acceleration for its desktop. \nIt looks like that won't work via remote display ssh X forwarding for those applications.\nYou need to use something like RDP or VNC to display the image after the acceleration has happend. \n\nA: Based on this link have you tried the following on your local Mac OS X?\ndefaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool true\n\nIt seems that XQuartz doesn't support indirect GLX by default.\n", "Q: Video card like frying pan (heating) I've installed the new Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Unity) and sensors.\nThis is what the sensors command gave me:\nacpitz-virtual-0 Adapter: Virtual device temp1:        +64.0°C  (crit\n= +89.0°C) temp2:        +29.8°C  (crit = +89.0°C)\n\nnouveau-pci-0100  Adapter: PCI adapter temp1:        +66.0°C  (high =\n+95.0°C, hyst =  +3.0°C)\n                       (crit = +105.0°C, hyst =  +5.0°C)\n                       (emerg = +135.0°C, hyst =  +5.0°C) \n\ncoretemp-isa-0000 Adapter: ISA adapter Physical id 0:  +65.0°C  (high\n= +80.0°C, crit = +85.0°C) Core 0:         +65.0°C  (high = \n+80.0°C, crit = +85.0°C) Core 1:         +63.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit =\n+85.0°C)\n\nBut I actually have 4 cores, and the temperature is too high as for me. \nShould I worry about that?\n\nA: From discussions on various forums, the consensus online seems to be that ~65 degrees C is an OK temperature for a video card, and is certainly not dangerous for the hardware.\nHere's one explanation of temperature on the infamous Tom's Hardware forum:\n\nAnything below 90C would not damage the card. The ideal is to have it below 80C and the best is for it not to run over 70C [...] It should be fine.

I want to make a keybinding for i3wm that launches 2 GUI applications at the same  time. Is that possible?\n\nA: Yes. You can chain i3 commands by passing a list, which is separated by either , or ;. For example, this will open a terminal and xclock on pressing Super+x:\nbindkey Mod4+x exec i3-sensible-terminal; exec xclock\n\nNote: while exec i3-sensible-terminal will be run before exec xclock, there is no guarantee that the window for i3-sensible-terminal will open before the window of xclock. That is due to the fact that exec does not wait for a window to be mapped before returning.

In addition swap is using existing swap partitions on found hard drives instead of just the swap partition on the live usb disk.\nI have an existing ubuntu 12.04 system with four hard drives.  One of which is a Win 7 drive.  I've created an ubuntu 16.04 live usb flash drive.  I'm trying to install ubuntu 16.04 onto another usb flash drive.  Then we would use it such that we may add software, updates, and not overwrite the existing system.\nSo I booted ubuntu 16.04 from the live USB.  Then selected install ubuntu, something else.  Created a /dev/sde ext4 partition mounted at / and selected /dev/sde for booting.  When we select next we get a message stating that partion #5 of sda will be formatted as swap.  Partition #3 of sdd will be formatted as swap.  We do not want these drives repartitioned...  Any suggestions as to what to try without unplugging the four existing sata drives?\nWe tried numerous partition schemes on sde, such as adding a swap partition, or a user partition, etc.  But always get a message that the original hard disks are going to be modified / formatted.\nSometimes all four drives show up and then more drives and partitions are selected for \"formatting\".  Do we need multiple swap partitions across multiple drives?\nAlso note that we did accidentally create a usb with ubuntu 12.04 and the install process did not tell us it was overwriting the other disks.  However the next time we booted from hard drives it took two boots to work.  So we're suspicious that we might have formatted swap space or other space on the existing hard drives without telling.\nAlso note that \"sudo swapon -s\" shows that the live usb disk on sdd is using swap partitions on sda and sdd.  Trying \"sudo swapoff -a\" then running \"sudo swapon -s\" does disable using swap on this instance of the live usb disk.  However then running install still insists on formatting the swap partitions on sda and sdd.\nI've gone ahead and did install to sde, requiring the formatting of swap partitions on sda and sdd, with no apparent side affects. Other than a nagging concern in the back of the brain.  Maybe I should have removed the existing hard drives just to be safe.\n\nA: The installer does reformat the swap partition; but then it resets the uuid back to the original uuid, which is why you don't notice a problem later.\nThe message that the installer gives you, however, does not mention that the uuid is preserved.

If that's your case, then create the script steam.sh with executable permissions:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport LD_PRELOAD='/usr/$LIB/libstdc++.so.6'\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nsteam\n\nThen change at the steam desktop entry the Exec= line at the absolute path of the steam.sh script. Every time you want to play a game, open first steam with the modified desktop entry and then run the game from inside steam.

If so, and you are using an Nvidia  graphics card, this solution might help you.\nIf you don't have ubuntu-drivers, then install it with:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install ubuntu-drivers\n\nThen check what your device requirements are:\nubuntu-drivers devices\n\nYou will see a number of drivers listed. Choose the recommended driver e.g. driver   : nvidia-driver-460 - distro non-free recommended\nCheck to see if you have any older Nvidia drivers:\napt list -i | grep nvidia\n\nE.g. if you're seeing Nvidia 450 drivers, remove with:\nsudo apt purge nvidia-*-450\n\nNow you should be ready to install the new drivers:\nsudo apt install nvidia-driver-460\n\nIf you have any problems, such as a dependency, just add it in the install line e.g.\nsudo apt install nvidia-driver-460 nvidia-kernel-source-460\n\nOnce complete, reboot:\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 18.04: Once you successfully uninstalled your current Steam (all directory related to steam) please open a terminal and type the following in order to have a fresh and clean installation:\nsudo add-apt-repository multiverse\n\nOnce you're right the output should be:\n\n'multiverse' distribution component enabled for all sources\n\n\nThen install steam (using the terminal this is important in order\n   to see potential error messages)\nsudo apt install steam\nsudo apt update\n\n\nOnce the installation is successfull, just type steam\nsteam\n\nHere either it works and then have fun !

When I boot a 4.4.x kernel, I want to make sure that the buggy staging driver r8723au is blacklisted, in favor of the much-improved mainline rtl8xxxu.\nHowever, when I boot an older 4.2.x kernel, I'll still need to use the old r8723au driver.\nIs there any way to blacklist a module only for a specific kernel version? (UPDATE: I want to blacklist the old module, r8723au, from the new kernel, to prevent it from taking over from the new driver.)\nIdeas I had:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-r8723au.conf -- it's not possible to specify blacklist only for one kernel version, as far as I can tell\n\n*/etc/default/grub -- no way to specify modprobe.blacklist=r8723au for the kernel command line for some versions and not others\n\n\nThe quick-and-dirty solution I've got is to manually edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg and add the relevant blacklist parameter to specific kernel versions… but of course this will be overwritten automatically the next time I run update-grub (perhaps when installing an updated Xenial/16.04 kernel).\n\nA: The module rtl8xxxu doesn't exist in kernel version 4.2.0-xx, as far as I know, so booting into a 4.2.0-xx kernel should be fine.\nI am not aware that the two drivers cover the same usb.ids, however, you can keep r8723au from loading in 4.4.0-xx by renaming the modules. For instance:\nsudo mv /lib/modules/4.4.0-21-generic/kernel/drivers/staging/rtl8723au/r8723au.ko  /lib/modules/4.4.0-21-generic/kernel/drivers/staging/rtl8723au/r8723au.bak\n\nsudo mv /lib/modules/4.4.0-22-generic/kernel/drivers/staging/rtl8723au/r8723au.ko  /lib/modules/4.4.0-22-generic/kernel/drivers/staging/rtl8723au/r8723au.bak\n\nYou will need to repeat the process when an updated kernel version, -23 perhaps, is installed by Update Manager.\n", "Q: GUI DPI scaling on certain apps very small I recently installed STEAM and webcamstudio on my UBUNTU machine which is running a resolution of 1920 x 1080.  I have found that these applications do not honor the system-wide font sizes, but use instead a different DPI which makes reading the menus very difficult as the text is very small.\nIs there a way that I can change the settings so that the GUI font of these apps are not microscopic at this resolution?\n\nA: The skin (the accepted answer) is deprecated by the author, and it does not scale perfectly. \nFor those who are still looking for a good solution, there is actually a setting in steam to do that.\nSimply check Steam->Settings->Interface->Enlarge text and icons based on monitor size and restart steam will give you a perfect text size.\n\nA: Currently steam hardcoded the font size on linux.\nThe only way I found to increase the font size is to use a HiDPI skin\nInstallation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*cd to your steam skin directory (see note)\n\n*Clone the repo(you must have git installed sudo apt-get install git)\ngit clone https://github.com/MoriTanosuke/HiDPI-Steam-Skin.git\nThen open Steam and go to Settings->Interface. Choose the new skin \"HiDPI-Steam-Skin\"\nNOTE: The exact path to the skins might be different depending on your installation. \nIt might be located at ~/.steam/skins/ or ~/.local/share/Steam/skins/.\n\nA: I use KDE. I fixed this going to:\nSystem Settings → Application Style → GNOME/GTK Application Style → GTK Themes → Fonts\nThere I picked a font and new size. In my case the displayed font was not active, meaning that what was seen was not applying. I just increased and decreased the font size, so that the setting was refreshed and it worked! I just had to restart my applications. \n\nA: It is probably caused by system default dpi scaling as i recently faced the same problem with sublime text 3. You should use default dpi that is '1'. if you change settings certain apps behave erraticly as they are made for certain resolutions and thus making a fuss in rendering process of gui.\nTo correct this just go to \n\nSystem > Settings > Displays > Scale for menu and title bars \n\nand change the scale to 1. this should solve the problem (restart your pc just in case :p ).\n\nA: I was able to fix mine by going to:\nSystem Settings -> Application Style -> GNOME Application Style (GTK)\n\nand setting the font there for GTK themes to be the same as my system font.\nHalf my apps were fine, half were ugly fonts.\n", "Q: Cannot Use 3d Acceleration with Ubuntu Guest in VirtualBox I'm running Ubuntu 16.04LTS guest on a Windows 10 host.

Leo's version pair (VBox 5.1.30 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) ended up working, after trying 5+ other version pairs.\nHere's the steps that worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download exact VBox 5.1.30 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS versions, and create a fresh VM with max video memory allowed\n\n*Install Ubuntu from ISO onto the VM and do not install Ubuntu updates while waiting or third party software for media when prompted\n\n*Do NOT run sudo apt update or sudo apt upgrade as mentioned in other blog posts \n\n*Reboot and run:\nsudo apt install dkms build-essential module-assistant\nsudo m-a prepare\n\n*Insert the Guest Additions CD using the VBox host menu. Run it. Reboot, and it worked. \n\n\nOn a side note, it would appear upgrading your VBox version can break your installation of Ubuntu! However I suspect you should be able to upgrade your Ubuntu indefinitely without a problem once you have 3D acceleration working using the Guest Additions, without any issue. Have not tested that theory yet though.\nIt may also be helpful for some to know that when 3D acceleration is not working in Ubuntu + VBox it will cause keys to stick repeatedly when typing, making it all but impossible to use Ubuntu. You can reproduce this by installing the latest (v17) Ubuntu with latest VBox (5.2) on Macbook Pro Retina / High Sierra. Install runs fine but after reboot cannot even login to Ubuntu as keys stick.

I tried restarting my computer which didn't work. Checked the shortcut settings in the keyboard to make sure everything was right that Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right is still the shortcut and it is. Even right clicking a window, it doesn't say \"move this to left/right workplace\". \nThis started after I reinstalled Ubuntu. I recently reinstalled Ubuntu after trying to dual-boot Windows alongside it, and now this doesn't work. I have disabled Unity, I'm using Gnome. It worked before when I disabled Unity for Gnome as well. \nTried to be as detailed as possible, let me know if you need more thanks in advance. \n\nA: Switched from GNOME (Compiz) to GNOME (Metacity) and it worked.

This question is related to another, more general, question about guest accounts. This one is very specific.\nSetup: I have many older Dell Latitude E6410s and some newer Dell Latitude 5450 I use in a classroom setting running 16.04.  Many students use these machines for a variety of purposes among data analysis and data acquisition through attached USB devices. \nGuest accounts serve us well to wipe the machines clean between logins.  The additional feature of the guest accounts is that upon turning the machines on and 'forgetting' them the machine automatically log in to the guest account and launch a browser window.  The problem is that the guest accounts do not have any privileges to access the USB ports.\nA simple solution would be to add the new guest account (e.g guest-abf2) to the dialout and plugdev group so the students can use attached devices and thumb drives.  Something like:\nmoduser -a -G plugdev,dialout $USER\n\ninside a script early enough in the login process to work.\nThis is what I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*placing this command in either of the two documented hooks: auto.sh and prefs.sh in the /etc/guest-session directory.  Neither works.  prefs.sh is run in the user context and while auto.sh is supposed to run in root context it is run too late to add the newly created guest account to the two groups\n\n*modifying the available scripts the lightdm runs (Yeah I know this is not good but I was getting desperate) and still this doesn't work. I need to execute the moduser command right after the account is created but before the actual login.\n\n*According to old documentation (11 or so) there is a hook called setup.sh which I tried but I am not sure this hook works anymore.\n\n*I have looked into writing a udev script but that seems terribly painful and the documentation seems geared toward mounting USB thumb drives not allowing access to USB devices.  I could be wrong here.\n\n*Somewhere I tripped across some documentation that there was a similar 'script' like mechanism to automatically add new users to certain groups but I can't seem to find it.  This might work in this case or not but I'll give it a try.\n\n\nA: The guest accounts are created by the shell script /usr/sbin/guest-account. \nAt the end of the function add_account it calls useradd to create the user. If you add the -G plugdev,dialout option here that should do the trick.\nUse dpkg-divert to avoid that an updated package overwrites your modified script.\n\nA: Use usermod, not 'moduser'.\n\n... so the behavior of the startup script prefs.sh now works as\n  advertised. By creating a file called prefs.sh in /etc/guest-session\n  with the following line:\nmoduser $USER -a -G plugdev,dialout\n\n\nThat command will cause the guest session to crash and not load if you include it in prefs.sh. '`moduser' isn't a valid command. Use this line instead:\nusermod -a -G plugdev,dialout $USER\n\n\nA: auto.sh has never run in a root context. prefs.sh did so up to Ubuntu 15.10 when it was sourced by /usr/sbin/guest-account, but the code has been refactored, and in 16.04 prefs.sh is sourced by /usr/share/lightdm/guest-session/setup.sh which is not run as root.\nDon't know if this change in behavior is intentional. If not, there may be a reason to propose a change.\nNot sure what you mean when you say that a guest session cannot access the USB ports. I know that you can use USB sticks, at least. Possibly there are other devices whose use is prevented via AppArmor.\nEdit:\nI filed a bug report, and if accepted, you will be able to use prefs.sh to assign the guest to group(s) as you could before.\nAs regards USB sticks I did some testing, and found that how the stick is formatted matters. With an ext4 formatted stick I could neither read nor write, but when formatted as fat16 it works fine.\n\nA: I don't know exactly when it happened but lightdm was updated so the behavior of the startup script prefs.sh now works as advertised.  By creating a file called prefs.sh in /etc/guest-session with the following line:\nmoduser $USER -a -G plugdev,dialout\n\nI achieved exactly what I needed to allow students to access new USB devices in the guest account.\n", "Q: Landscape Autopilot install stuck on \"Add Juju machine in an LXC on 'the-to-be-networking-machine'\" (90%) My question appears to be very similar to the following mostly unanswered question.\nI have an Autopilot installation (I followed these instructions) with one MaaS master, one Landscape Autopilot server, and 5 floating machine. One of these five floating machines is configured during the install to host the networking node.\n~90% through the installation it stalls because it is waiting for juju to deploy into LXC on the to-be-networking node. However, this never completes. It can wait for days.\nI am not able to ssh into the to-be-networking node from the MaaS master. However, it reports being correctly deployed. Indeed I can and have watched it deploy and watched the MaaS master NAT its traffic successfully.\nDuring the Autopilot installation of OpenStack, other nodes also have juju deployed under LXC.

Alternatively, you could type:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0080,0000\n\nEither action should fix your problem.\nBe aware, however, that either Ubuntu or OS X might change the default in the future.

Can't send messages but can receive.  Error message is  \"4.4.0 ... Relaying temporarily denied. Cannot resolve PTR record for 202.91.195.235.\"  Am only able to send messages to myself using ISP address.\nHave reinstalled Thunderbird on PC and changed DSL router and spoken to ISP who can't see problem from their end but problem persists.  Installed alternate email client Claws POP3 on same PC.  Same problem as Thunderbird.  Changed SMTP Port from 25 to 587, get different error message \n\"mail server responded: 5.7.0 Authentication required\"\nChanged to laptop from PC and installed Thunderbird POP3 Ubuntu 12.04 on laptop which works perfectly.  Seems that problem must be in Ubuntu/Thunderbird on my PC.\nAppreciate any help.  Thank you.\n\nA: This problem has nothing to do with Thunderbird.  In an effort to fight spam servers are tightening up their requirements.  One of the standard requirements for relaying is that the IP address has a PTR record, often with the additional requirement that it passes rDNS validation.  Some servers will freely forward for servers from IP addresses they consider local.  It appears that your relay (SMTP) server does not relay for your IP address.\nIf you are using your ISP's relay, you should configure Thunderbird to connect to the Submission (587) port and authenticate with your credentials.   It is rare that a server will relay an email received on the Submission port without authentications.  If they do, it should only be from IP addresses that are local to the server.  You can configure the credentials when you define the SMTP server used for sending emails.  You can also add or modify them from the Account Settings menu in Thunderbird.\nSee the Outgoing section of my Email Policy for more details on restrictions that may be in place.\n", "Q: php7.0 Ubuntu 15.10 I have Ubuntu 15.10.\nI'm trying to install php7.0\nI executed :\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ondrej/php\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install php7.0\n\nI get:\nE: Unable to locate package php7.0 \n\nE: Couldn't find any package by regex 'php7.0'\n\nDoes anyone see where I'm going wrong?\n\nA: The Reason\nThe ppa:ondrej/php provides PHP packages only for supported releases \nWARNING: add-apt-repository is broken with non-UTF-8 locales, see https://github.com/oerdnj/deb.sury.org/issues/56 for workaround:\nLC_ALL=C.UTF-8 add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php\n\nTo set the language to UTF-8:\nsudo apt-get install -y language-pack-en-base\nlocale-gen en_US.UTF-8\nexport LANG=en_US.UTF-8\nexport LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n\n", "Q: Full Screen: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS running on Windows 10 Hyper-V I got Ubuntu 14.04 LTS running as a VM on my Alienware laptop running Windows 10.

However, any time I try running the apt-get commands in the accepted answer there, I get the same errors as above.\nLooking for another solution that didn't use apt-get, I came across this post, which recommends using things like sudo dpkg --purge linux-image-4.2.0-15-generic on old, unused kernels.\ndpkg -l | tail -n +6 | grep -E 'linux-image-[0-9]+' | grep -Fv $(uname -r) (from the afore-mentioned post) shows that I have several old kernels in the pi state (desired purged, state is installed according to this)\nuname -r tells me the kernel I'm running is 3.16.0-62-generic, so I thought I should be safe to remove these old kernels.

It requests the session manager to display  the\n   logout  confirmation  screen,  or,  if  given  one  of the command-line\n   options below, causes the session manager to take the requested  action\n   immediately.\n\nOPTIONS:\n   --logout     Log out without displaying the logout dialog.\n   --halt       Halt without displaing the logout dialog.\n   --reboot     Reboot without displaying the logout dialog.\n   --suspend    Suspend without displaying the logout dialog.\n   --hibernate  Hibernate without displaying the logout dialog.\n   --fast       Do  a  fast shutdown.  This instructs the session manager not to\n                save the session, but instead to quit everything quickly.\n\nSo to shut down, use \nxfce4-session-logout --halt\n\nand to reboot, use\nxfce4-session-logout --reboot\n\nIf you just want to get the dialogue where you can pick an action manually, run it without arguments:\nxfce4-session-logout \n\n\nA: Check this also .

When I use Transmission for torrents, it doesn't download anything and in the browser torrents sites are blocked, But if I do same thing on Windows in the same network it works perfectly fine.\nNot sure weather it has to do something with security since to me it looks like the ISP is able to interpret the data on Ubuntu but not on windows.\nSo, how do I fix this problem? Basically I want to know the root cause of why its blocked on Ubuntu but not on windows.\nThanks\n\nA: Setting up P2P systems like bittorrent is a PITA and problems seem to recur even after things start working (especially with port forwarding).\nAnything is possible, but it is very unlikely that your ISP even looks at your OS in this situation.\nThe usual problem is port forwarding. Bittorrent uses a port for incoming requests from other peers. Usually, this port will be closed by default in both your router/gateway and in your firewall on your computer. Opening the port will radically improve upload and download speeds for most torrents.\nBut, it should still work (slower) with it closed. So, until it does, there's no point in trying to fix the ports.\nHere's what I would try:\nDownload (from your web browser) a torrent for a recent Linux distro like Ubuntu 16.04. Torrents like this usually have a huge number of seeders available from the Peer Exchange, DHT, and from the trackers, so you can get plenty of peers without them being able to find you via your port (which may be closed).\nStart Transmission and add just this torrent to it (just to keep things simple) and start the torrent.\nIn Transmission, select Edit->Settings->Privacy and make sure the boxes for Use PEX and Use DHT are both checked (selected). These are the other 2 ways your client can find peers which may not be known by the tracker.\nOnce you have done this, this particular torrent should download/upload quickly. If it doesn't, then something really strange is going on.\nUsually, the next place to start looking for issues would be in your gateway/router, but since it is letting bittorrent traffic through in Windows, there's probably nothing wrong there or at your ISP.\nWhen you're done testing, you can delete the torrent from within Transmission to get your disk space back, but keep the original torrent file for use in future testing.\nOnce it works this much, we can get back to things like port forwarding to improve performance - especially on torrents with very few seeders from the trackers.\nYou can start with the guide they provide.\nFor future questions/posts like this, you should include information on your setup such as your OS/version, application (transmission) version, ... Each system is setup a bit differently than everyone else's and some problems have known solutions which have been fixed by newer versions of things.\n", "Q: Unable to turn off Airplane Mode on Ubuntu 16.04 After installing Ubuntu 16.04 in my HP Pavilion dv6 notebook, I cannot turn off my Airplane Mode.

You have to remember the passphrases for each certificate, though.\nThe X.509 certificates had to be imported from a backup,the secret ring didn't contain them. \nThanks a lot, solved!\n", "Q: will installing ubuntu (dual boot) makes my pc boot slowly? windows10 boots very fast ,as is known.But if I install a ubuntu to dual boot,will it slow down my computer's booting?\nonce I install ubuntu on win8.1,then it takes about 1min to boot,which is very annoying.\nshould I replace the \"grub\" with something else? and how to do it?\n\nA: Technically yes, installing Ubuntu next to Windows with the bootloader grub will slightly slow down your boot sequence, just by the mere fact that you have to select which system to start.\nHowever, besides of this, the boot process should not be significantly slower on any of the installed systems. If a low number of seconds, depending on your reaction time or setup, is not crucial for you, this should not be a factor to take into consideration.\nYou can also configure grub, so that it takes less time to boot the highlighted option or change the default to your preferred system. For simplicity, I would advise to install the grub-customizer by entering the following in a terminal:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nIn the general preferences, you can change the timeout to boot the selected system and you can also change the order of display for all entries, or remove them.\nBe a little careful though not to delete all Ubuntu entries or with setting the timeout to 0, since that will result in grub not showing up. There are fixes for this, but it's avoidable.\nAs far as grub alternatives go: If boot time is your only concern, I highly doubt that any other bootloader will noticably increase your boot time against a customised grub.\n", "Q: forcing synapse to index a directory I have a NTFS drive binded into a directory inside my home (binding is specified in fstab), like this:\nUUID=1A782A664EB8 /mnt/windows ntfs permissions,locale=en_US.utf8 0 2\n/mnt/windows/Users/me/Documents /home/me/Documents none bind 0 0\n\nThe permissions are set 666 for files and 777 for directories.\nThis is my /etc/updatedb.conf:\nPRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS=\"yes\"\nPRUNEPATHS=\"/tmp /var/spool /media /home/.ecryptfs /var/lib/schroot\"\nPRUNEFS=\"NFS nfs nfs4 rpc_pipefs afs binfmt_misc proc smbfs autofs iso9660 ncpfs coda devpts ftpfs devfs mfs shfs sysfs cifs lustre tmpfs usbfs udf fuse.glusterfs fuse.sshfs curlftpfs ecryptfs fusesmb devtmpfs\"\n\nNOTE: home directory is not encrypted.\nIt seems that synapse fails to index those files. Is there a way to force synapse to index that directory?\n\nA: It is possibile, but disabled by default. I am not sure what will happen to the NTFS file system if you index it with updatedb.\nThe thing is, Synapse uses Zeitgeist, that uses locate to find things.\nFollowing this answer my /etc/updatedb.conf reads\ncat /etc/updatedb.conf\nPRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS=\"yes\"\n# PRUNENAMES=\".git .bzr .hg .svn\"\nPRUNEPATHS=\"/tmp /var/spool /media /home/.ecryptfs /var/lib/schroot\"\nPRUNEFS=\"NFS nfs nfs4 rpc_pipefs afs binfmt_misc proc smbfs autofs iso9660 ncpfs coda devpts ftpfs devfs mfs shfs sysfs cifs lustre tmpfs usbfs udf fuse.glusterfs fuse.sshfs curlftpfs ecryptfs fusesmb devtmpfs\"\n\nWhere these variables are documented in\nman updatedb.conf\n\n[...]\nPRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS\n              One of the strings 0, no, 1 or yes.  If PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS  is  1\n              or  yes,  bind  mounts are not scanned by updatedb(8).

LightDM appears on both screens and shows my name in the login box, but the password field is not visible and entering the password anyway has no effect.\nThe machine is still running, and I can access it by SSH or an alternative shell (with ctrl-alt and function keys), but I can't get back to my previous Unity session.\nLogging out and in again without suspending works correctly.\nThe laptop is a Dell Precision M6700 with an nVidia Quadro K4000M and the external monitor is connected via DisplayPort 1.2. The OS is Ubuntu 16.04 and the problem occurs with both the latest nVidia drivers and the Nouveau display driver.\nWhat can I do to fix LightDM?\n\nA: Here is a workaround that uses the idea from Malith's answer, but automates a few steps, let me know if it works for you, and if not, I have some other ideas that may work.\nCreate a file named /etc/systemd/system/suspend-workaround.service, with the following content:\n[Unit]\nDescription=suspend lightdm workaround\nBefore=sleep.target\nStopWhenUnneeded=yes\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nRemainAfterExit=yes\nExecStart=/bin/chvt 1\nExecStop=/bin/chvt 7\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=sleep.target\n\nType the following on a terminal to reload systemd files and enable the unit above:\nsudo systemctl enable suspend-workaround.service\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\n\nTry to suspend and report your results.\nEDIT: If the above unlocks your session (it shouldn't), you can make your session lock post resume, by replacing the ExecStop=/bin/chvt 7 with ExecStop=/bin/chvt 7 ; /bin/loginctl lock-sessions.\nYou can also disable session locking on system settings, and force it to lock post resume using a systemd script like the one above, by calling /bin/loginctl lock-sessions and leaving all the chvt stuff out.\n\nA: When you needed to suspend, do it using the shell opened by Ctrl + Alt + F2\nlogin to that shell using your username and password.\nThen type sudo pm-suspend to suspend the machine. (If not, try installing pm-utils using sudo apt-get install pm-utils)\nTo resume, press any key and you will see the last shell window.\nNow you can press Ctrl + Alt + F7 to get your Unity session. \n\nA: I've been frustrated by this and found a solution that worked just now.  I don't know if it will work reliably.  I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 but it apparently happens on later versions also.\nUse cntrl-alt-f1 to get to an alternate console.  Login as normal (doesn't need to be root). Use ps -aef and grep to find compiz.  Then kill compiz with \"kill -9 \".  Be sure to enter compiz's pid not compiz's parent's pid (ppid).  The \"top\" command can help you find the right process and k (for kill) can be used to do the work.\nGo back to cntrl-alt-f7 and the screen flickers, redraws, etc (like when window manager gives up windows, dropping decorations, etc.).  Then it displayed the greeter UI with my username and (Yes!) a Password text entry box.  I typed my password and got back to my desktop. It looked a bit odd, and it started up a new instance of compiz without me doing that myself. I examined each window, saving work where needed, and exited each window.  Finally all the windows are closed and I made whatever notes I needed.  Then I did a restart of the linux system.\nAfter reboot I see the normal greeting page with my user name AND the password text entry box.

It requires Gambas3 to be installed as a prerequisite.

This happens if your Ubuntu interface uses other language than en or es. Just make a copy of the en folder (and all its' contents) and rename it with the language name of your Ubuntu (e.g. fr, ge, etc). And, of course, accept the GPL licence. This will make it start, but the interface language will still be es (spanish).\nAny help with an english translation is most welcomed.\n", "Q: Remove leading whitespace from files, folders and their subfolders I came up with this, but unfortunately it doesnt affect any files/folders in subfolders. \nfind . -exec rename \"s/^\\s+//\" {} \\;\n\nFolder structure:\nfoo\n|-- \\ bar\n`-- \\ foo1\n    |-- \\ bar1\n    `-- \\ foo2\n        `-- \\ bar2\n\n\nA: Renaming needs to be done from bottom to top\nThe issue is that you need to rename the directories from bottom to top. Else the command will try to rename files & directories which are inside already moved (renamed) folders, and thus cannot find them anymore.\nThis is where python's os.walk() can be used, in combination with topdown=False\nIn a small script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(sys.argv[1], topdown=False):\n    for f in files:\n        if f.startswith(\" \"):\n            shutil.move(root+\"/\"+f, root+\"/\"+f.strip())\n    for dr in dirs:\n        if dr.startswith(\" \"):\n            shutil.move(root+\"/\"+dr, root+\"/\"+dr.strip())\n\nTo use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as no_space.py\n\n*Run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/no_space.py /path/to/directory/to/rename\n\n\nA: As noted in other answers, the main issue is that ^ anchors the start of the path, rather than the start of the filename. There are several ways to work around that with find and rename: probably the safest would be to use -execdir in place of -exec so that all the path components reduce to ./, and then replace the pattern \\./\\s+\nAlso, if you are renaming directories possibly including ancestors of other files/directories that are to be renamed, then you should do a depth-first traversal.\nPutting it together,\nfind . -depth -name ' *' -execdir rename -vn -- 's#\\./\\s+##' {} +\n\nor (functionally equivalent, but a bit easier to see what's happening) using a zero-length \"lookbehind\" for the path separator\n$ find . -depth -name ' *' -execdir rename -vn -- 's#(?<=\\./)\\s+##' {} +\n./ bar2 renamed as ./bar2\n./ foo2 renamed as ./foo2\n./ bar1 renamed as ./bar1\n./ foo1 renamed as ./foo1\n./ bar renamed as ./bar\n\n[NOTE: remove the -n once you are sure it does what you want]\n\nA: I think the problem is with the output format of find, that includes the full path. So for bar2 you will have\n./ foo1/ foo2 /bar2\n\nthat rename will not understand correctly.\nA solution is to use a script to do each folder recursively like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n# if argument given consider it is the directory to parse\nif [ -n \"$1\" ]; then\n    cd \"$1\"\nfi\n# rename all files in current folder\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -printf '%f\\0'  | xargs -0r -n 1 rename -nono 's/^\\s+//'\n# No, repeat for all subfolders with current script (we are in the subfolder)\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -name '.' -print0 | xargs -0r -n 1 \"$(readlink -f $0)\"\n\n", "Q: How can I get a warning before restart/shutdown? I have just restarted my Ubuntu, but I forgot that a virtual machine was open in the background (having a minimized icon on the taskbar). Is it possible to configure Ubuntu in a way that if a user-defined application is running, then issue a warning before restart/shutdown? I am using version 16.04.\n\nA: Introduction\nThe script bellow monitors all or user-defined application for presence, and if that presence is found - the system will be prevented from shutting down via graphical dialog ( the shutdown via command line won't be affected , as this is task applied by system administrators who know what they're doing).\nThere are 3 options:\n-a Monitor any open applications.\n-c Graphically select an app\n-s specify .desktop file for app on command line\n-h prints the syntax and list of options.\nThe -c option is appropriate for one session only, where you want to simply click on a window and monitor that. The -a and -s options are appropriate to be added as autostart entries to be launched on system login. -s option can be used with either full path or a portion of it , e.g. either /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop or firefox.desktop are equally acceptable.\nScript Source\nThe script source is available here or on my GitHub.

I never found out the reason but my \"guess\" has been that it's a problem with the upgrade and not really something wrong with the kernel or Ubuntu 16.04 for my system.\nWhat you can consider is creating a boot disk and boot off of it.  Select \"Try Ubuntu\".  I guess this should work.  If it does, it at least means that the kernel and Ubuntu 16.04 will work for your system.\nMaybe some left-over settings is causing you problems.  From here, you can consider the following to re-install Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount your root partition and copy system-level files to your home\ndirectory. For example, at least everything from /etc.\n\n*Select \"Install Ubuntu\" and one of the options available\nin Ubuntu 16.04 is to write over your existing Ubuntu, leaving your\n/home directory intact.\n\n*It will wipe the system-level files and\ninstall a base system.\n\n*Yes, now you have to go through and install all the missing packages.  Hopefully, you don't have to stress out what settings you need to edit and just copy over the configuration file(s) from the old /etc.\n\n\nI wouldn't be stingy with step (1).  Copy any settings in /var and so on if you think it would take some time to recover.  Just make sure you put it in your home directory.  Other parts of the system will be wiped.\nHopefully, this should work.  Yes, it's a bit heavy-handed, but I've done this a couple of times (on different systems) for Ubuntu 16.04 already.  Trying to figure out the cause is better, but sometimes, you don't have the time...  \n\nA: You can also try the 4.6 kernel. I found this guide to be quite helpful but I had to match the kernel number to the one found here. Essentially I changed just the last 6 digits, which I assume represent the build date.\nI'm sorry to say that the 4.6 kernel still has the same problem on my machine. If yours does as well, we should try matching up components to see what is causing the issue. I would hate to be unable to update to a new version of Ubuntu, and that might happen if we have the same issue and it doesn't get fixed.\n", "Q: convert svg or ttf to otf, eot, woff I'm looking for a command line software/script for linux/ubuntu that can help me convert svg or ttf to otf, eot and woff formats. \nI've tried fontmin,webify, fontforge, eot-utils, sfnt2woff, ttf2woff and other alternative as much as i can, I can't find a good converter. \nfontmin convert files to ttf otf but doesn't convert to woff and is always broken. fontforge doesn't convert to woff and eot either, sfnt2woff and ttf2woff only convert to woff. \nI'm simply trying to make web fonts css after converting process, I've also tried many alternative for it but so far no success at all. \nPlease let me know if there are batter option to accomplish my requirements. and feel free to edit and correct my question. \n\nA: You may be able to convert ttf to eot, woff and svg with Ruby:\nsudo apt install ruby\ngem install convert_font\nconvert_font convert -i folder/font-file.ttf -f eot,woff,svg\n\nNote that convert_font is not longer developed and outdated (as of today, december 2020, there was no update since 7 years - apparently this fork was updated since then), I hope you'll find a way to make it work with your setup\n", "Q: No network connection in Ubuntu Server 16.04 I have installed Ubuntu Server 16.04 and updated all packages using:\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\nI have installed and configured Gitlab from their Omnibus package.\nFor two days, I used the server without issues.\nHowever, today I cannot connect to my local network.\nUbuntu stucks for 5 minutes in the boot screen waiting for the following to finish:\nstart job raise network interfaces\nWhen Ubuntu started:\nsudo service networking status display a red inactive text along other texts.\nI have used:\nsudo service networking restart, sudo ifconfig enp1s0 up and sudo dhclient enp1s0\nStill nothing working.\nWhen I use ipconfig i see two intrefaces: lo and enp1s0\nWhen I use ip addr show no ip address for enp1s0 is displayed.

Xubuntu = XFCE + Ubuntu so the instalation process and everything is the same as Ubuntu.\nTo sum up, I tried to install it and I wanted to delete my Windows and after Xubuntu was installed it didn't boot. If I plug the USB with Xubuntu and press try or install it gets stuck before booting. Help please!\nThis is everything I have tried:\nWhen I bought my laptop it had installed a trial version of Windows. I wanted to install Xubuntu via UEFI and delete Windows. I might install Windows later along Xubuntu. What I did was the following:\nI plugged the USB with the  64bit disk of Xubuntu in it. To boot from the USB I had to boot from Windows and then I clicked on an option that comes with Windows that rebooted the computer and booted from USB.\nI followed this guide to install the OS https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI \nI followed the \"General principles\" of that link, but #2 because my BIOS doesn't have any option of   QuickBoot/FastBoot and Intel Smart Response Technology.\nThe installer appeared correctly and I selected the option of creating new partitions. I erased Windows and created two partitions. A small swap and the rest for / with the correct format. After, the installer told me that a boot partition was needed and its size should be ~35Mb I created one with format EFI of size 70Mb. The installation continued and after it finished the computer didn't boot.\nA black screen with the text Reboot or select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press any key. I guess something didn't work in the process of installation. I went into the BIOS and the devices to boot from were just from the internet IPv4 and IPv6. \nNow if I plug the USB again the screen of the previous guide appears http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1347445084.png but if I press any option (and press Esc so I can see what is being loaded) it always gets stuck at some point.\nI read somewhere that the boot partition needs normally ~600Mb so I thought that it was getting stuck because it hadn't enough memory. So,\nI downloaded boot repair disk and erased all the partitions of my hard drive and formatted it completely. I wanted to install Xubuntu again from scratch. But I have the same problem, every time I plug the USB and press in try Xubuntu  or install Xubuntu it gets stuck.\nI tried to install it without UEFI mode and I had the same problem. But something really strange happened. I enabled again UEFI and enabled secure boot and after I selected \"try Xubuntu\" it booted perfectly well. I thought \"maybe I should have enabled the secure boot the first time and that was the only problem\". So I rebooted in order to select Install Xubuntu but it got stuck again!!! After that I tried again to select Try Xubuntu and it got stuck too. \nI don't know what more I can do. Could you help me to solve the problem? Ideally I would want to have Xubuntu installed in UEFI mode.\n\nA: I solved by pressing e in grub and writing nomodeset before splash and then I could boot with the live USB. I could install it although the boot partition was not correctly linked in the BIOS. I solved this last problem with Boot repair.\n", "Q: setup or exe files not found Downloaded Adobe Flah player, went to downloads to run setup, opened the downloaded file but there was no (exe, setup or install).

As an added bonus, using this workaround, you can shut down in one click instead of three.\n\nSetting up a Shutdown shortcut on your desktop is easy, but first you\n  must change the security of the executable, because in a fresh\n  install, it requires the root password to be used.

I'm looking at the image channel guide for developers of Ubuntu Snappy Core. The only release available is 15.04. To me this seems odd; on the desktop and server side there has been a 15.10 and a 16.04 release since the 15.04. Does Ubuntu Snappy not follow the release convention? When can one expect a new release?\n\nA: Maybe you have missed it ... Ubuntu snap support comes pre-installed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Canonical unveils 6th LTS release of Ubuntu with 16.04 - Introduces “snaps” for new robust secure app format. Check out which applications are available by executing -> snap find.  \nExecute snap --help to get a list of currently available commands. When you want to run snappy images the way you used to do it before, you can download the latest versions here.\nSome more information and an example on how it works : Snap support in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n\nA: Here is more information:\nhttps://developer.ubuntu.com/core/get-started/kvm\nWith the download link for 64 bit Ubuntu snappy core 16.04:\nwget http://releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/16/ubuntu-core-16-amd64.img.xz\n\n", "Q: Mounting a drive Ubuntu Snappy Seeing as the Snappy Ubuntu filesystem is so locked down I was wondering whether one can mount and access an external drive in Ubuntu Snappy?\n\nA: Of course! It works as you'd expect. However, it's only really useful for a local user or from unconfined snaps-- as you noticed, snaps are pretty locked down and their default confinement won't let them reach out to the external drive.\nThere are ways around this though-- one is to install the snaps with devmode to unconfine them:\n$ sudo snap install --devmode <snap>\n\nAnother way is to actually place the writable partition on the external hard drive, which would allow all snaps to place their data there without them knowing any different. Of course, that means the hard drive needs to be present at all times. This is the solution that was used for the ownCloud Pi device in order to make use of the large external hard drive and save the life of the SD card in the raspberry pi.\nThe final solution is a new interface to allow specific snaps access to the external hard drive. This isn't complete yet, but is a known limitation.\nUpdate as of snapd v2.15: This interface is now supported, called removable-media. It's documented here.\n", "Q: Ubuntu slows down dramatically after about 3 hours usage I have a situation whereby Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop slows down dramatically after a few hours usage.

Hopefully someone can help. I'm going to restart the system now. My guess is the blocky graphics will be back when I do.\nEdit: Yes indeed. Blocky graphics back. This is very frustrating as the performance is great until this happens. I'm going to change the driver then change it back again. \n\nA: Posting how I sorted this issue in case anyone comes across something similar in the future. \nI re-installed Ubuntu 14.04 on the machine in question and the open source graphics driver immediately recognised the dual monitors. I've been using it for 2 days with no issues whatsoever.\nIt appears the issues above were caused by the buggy AMD proprietary drivers. I've had none of them since I moved to the open source driver.\nAnd I guess the open source driver didn't originally pick up the dual monitors because I restored an image made from a different machine to this one. A clean install sorted that out.\nThanks to all for their assistance \n", "Q: How to set up cron to call php script - bash: */5: No such file or directory for setting cron job we are trying to set up cron for magento site running in ubuntu server\nwe are trying following command :\n*/5 * * * * php -f /var/www/html/sitename/cron.php\n\nbut we are getting  error as below :\n-bash: */5: No such file or directory\n\nUpdate 1\n\nUpdate 2 - Error\nPHP Warning:  require(app/bootstrap.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/sitename/cron.php on line 30\n\nPHP Fatal error:  require(): Failed opening required 'app/bootstrap.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www/html/sitename/cron.php on line 30\n\ncron.php\n<?php\n\n\n// Change current directory to the directory of current script\nchdir(dirname(__FILE__));\n\nrequire 'app/bootstrap.php';\nrequire 'app/Mage.php';\n\nif (!Mage::isInstalled()) {\n    echo \"Application is not installed yet, please complete install wizard first.\";\n    exit;\n}\n\n// Only for urls\n// Don't remove this\n$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] = str_replace(basename(__FILE__), 'index.php', $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']);\n$_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] = str_replace(basename(__FILE__), 'index.php', $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']);\n\nMage::app('admin')->setUseSessionInUrl(false);\n\numask(0);\n\n$disabledFuncs = explode(',', ini_get('disable_functions'));\n$isShellDisabled = is_array($disabledFuncs) ? in_array('shell_exec', $disabledFuncs) : true;\n$isShellDisabled = (stripos(PHP_OS, 'win') === false) ? $isShellDisabled : true;\n$isShellDisabled = true;\n\ntry {\n    if (stripos(PHP_OS, 'win') === false) {\n        $options = getopt('m::');\n        if (isset($options['m'])) {\n            if ($options['m'] == 'always') {\n                $cronMode = 'always';\n            } elseif ($options['m'] == 'default') {\n                $cronMode = 'default';\n            } else {\n                Mage::throwException('Unrecognized cron mode was defined');\n            }\n        } else if (!$isShellDisabled) {\n            $fileName = basename(__FILE__);\n            $baseDir = dirname(__FILE__);\n            shell_exec(\"/bin/sh $baseDir/cron.sh $fileName -mdefault 1 > /dev/null 2>&1 &\");\n            shell_exec(\"/bin/sh $baseDir/cron.sh $fileName -malways 1 > /dev/null 2>&1 &\");\n            exit;\n        }\n    }\n\n    Mage::getConfig()->init()->loadEventObservers('crontab');\n    Mage::app()->addEventArea('crontab');\n    if ($isShellDisabled) {\n        Mage::dispatchEvent('always');\n        Mage::dispatchEvent('default');\n    } else {\n        Mage::dispatchEvent($cronMode);\n    }\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    Mage::printException($e);\n    exit(1);\n}\n\n\nA: About cron\nQuoting wikipedia here\n\nThe software utility Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like\n  computer operating systems.

Everything works fine.\nThe next step of the project was to use it when the network wasn't connected to internet. I thought it would go smoothly. Wrong! The websockets wouldn't connect.\nAfter many hours, I found out that the local server would basically send a frame to try to resolve the local IP of the connecting client, and would lock the connection until it gets a reply, which my router couldn't answer as internet was unplugged.\nThe bad workaround I found was to add my client IP in the /etc/hosts/\nBut I cannot add all local addresses to the 'hosts' file.\nAny idea how to prevent ubuntu to resolve local IPs? it configured as DHCP:\n$>more /etc/network/interfaces\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them.

I recently upgraded to 16.04 LTS on  April 23rd. The unit was bricked the next morning, and the NUC has now bricked four times in total, twice the last four days. My power setting is \"Don't Suspend\" -- it's set there to avoid inviting the situation where the unit becomes unresponsive and will not wake up (not just to mouse and keyboard inputs, it won't even respond to the power button). When bricked, the unit has to be disassembled, the CMOS battery disengaged, then put together again. Such a fun way to start the morning. Every occurrence happens the same way. I stop my work and leave the system running overnight. When I return to my desk in the morning I hit the keyboard and mouse and there is no reaction. Than I hit the power button -- now cringing because I know there is about a chance that there will be no response when I do so.\nI am using a wireless Logitech mouse and Keyboard. My Advanced Power BIOS settings are as advised by Intel:\nWake from S3 via CIR\nWake from S4 and S5 via CIR\nUSB S4/S5 power\nI wonder if I need to resort to a crappy USB mouse/keyboard setup rather than wireless.\nWindows users do not seem to be plagued with this issue. Or at least they can recover from it using the \"Wake on LAN\" feature to start an unresponsive unit from a mobile app. That doesn't work for me. The 16.04 settings for Ubuntu allow me to set that feature for the wired ethernet connection but the wifi connection -- which is what I am using -- does not expose that option. Setting the wired option and using the wifi does not work.\nThe unit will accept a remote control, and that also works for Windows users. I can steal a remote from my TV if required, but when I searched for the \"directions\" to add a remote to a NUC running Ubuntu too many of the posts starting out saying, \"After two days of trying everything . . .\"\nThese NUCs are great little machines when they run, but it absolutely sucks that Intel hasn't been able to fix this long-standing problem. They have advised me to post the issue over here.\n\nA: I have had a nearly similar problem with NUC's specifically with wireless K/B combo's.\nUse an USB extension cable for the K/B & Mouse Wireless receiver. I have had 2 separate situations where the inputs from the K/B & mouse were freezing the NUC, and had to reboot via power button - admittedly running W10 though..To test my theory I used a wired Keyboard and mouse..the problem disappeared for me.\nIf you search on the Intel forums it's a known problem with interference with the wireless network card AND USB wireless receivers (input) for wireless K/B & mouse - like that Logitech. It's all because of everything jammed in that tiny NUC case and the interference it causes. \n\nA: I have encountered this problem when I upgraded Mythbuntu from 15.10 to 16.04 with the XFCE graphical user interface(GUI).  At first I thought it was the screen saver (xscreensaver) that comes with XFCE.  Finding that disabled, I checked the HDTV that is being used as a screen and searched its options.  Nothing there.  I noted that in the latest Mythbuntu, in the front-end setup configuration, the default setting for it to go into suspend when there is no activity is 16 minutes.  Setting it to 0 stops it going into suspend.  I set it 0 and it stopped going into suspend and all was right until I turned off the TV.  When I turned the TV on again, the screensaver, which is part of the TV, nothing to do with Mythbuntu, was showing.  Tapping the keyboard,moving the mouse pointer using the touch pad, nor disconnecting and reconnecting the HDMI, causes the screen to come back to life.  Pushing the on/off button causes the computer to shut down.  On restarting, the HDMI is once again activated and the screen comes back to life until you turn off its power and then, immediately afterwards, turn it back on; only to be greeted by the TV's screen saver.\nI have done a totally fresh install of Mythbuntu 16.04, formatting all partitions beforehand, and the problem, as expected, is still there.\nIn other words, the problem would seem to be with the operating system, 16.04 and, guessing, is most probably driver related when using HDMI.  I haven't had the time yet to try other video outputs.  \nI can definitely say that the moment, if you turn off the power to the monitor and when you turn on the monitor again, even immediately after having turned it off, the HDMI active is not detected by the computer.\nA confusing problem but I think, at least, I have positively identified what is causing it.  I hope this is helpful to the Ubuntu developers.\nThe mother board is a Gigabyte ITX using an Intel i5 processor.\n\nA: Intel now has a BIOS update fix for this that you can get from their Intel Download Center. This issue also affects 6th gen (Skylake) NUCs and a BIOS fix is forthcoming for those. \n", "Q: How do I uninstall Visual Studio Code?

So I tried:\n$ which visual-studio-code\n/home/tim/.local/share/umake/bin/visual-studio-code\n\nI was having a look at that directory and realized it was a symlink to\n/home/tim/.local/share/umake/bin/visual-studio-code -> \n/home/tim/.local/share/umake/ide/visual-studio-code/bin/code*\n\nSo I was able to remove it with\numake ide visual-studio-code --remove\n\n(Note how I use umake ide and not umake web)\n\nA: I find this command from http://tipsonubuntu.com/2017/03/03/install-ms-visual-studio-code-ubuntu-16-0416-10/ and it work for me.\nsudo apt remove code && sudo apt autoremove\n\n\nA: sudo dpkg --remove visual-studio-code\n\nThis will remove the software (including the Dash icon/desktop entry).\nI think that this method will leave the configuration information around (if you re-install); there's also a purge option on dpkg that will remove this information as well.\nsudo dpkg --purge visual-studio-code\n\n\nA: I did it with the following command:\nsudo apt purge code\n\nto uninstall the program and then:\nsudo apt autoremove\n\nto remove the menu items/shortcuts etc as @Joe suggested.\nI hope it helps!\n\nA: As none of the above answer has been accepted so I am assuming it didn't solve your problem. If you cannot find it with apt or dpkg then most likely it was installed with snap as was in my case. To remove it just type:\nsnap remove code\n\n\nA: If you have installed it with umake, chances are that you didn't use sudo in front of it, so to remove it just type in umake web visual-studio-code --remove.\nThat's it.\n\nA: For all of them like me, code or visual-studio-code didn't work try using, vscode.\n\nA: Classic\nsudo apt purge code && sudo apt autoremove\n\nDo not forget\nrm -fr ~/.vscode (That was taking a good 500M on my machine)\n\nA: sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove code\nThis should remove the files (of visual-studio-code), its configuration files and the dependencies.\n", "Q: Bluetooth broadcom 43142 unstable connection and other bugs during work I could successfully install drivers for this module thanks to this answer, but there are some issues. \nI need bluetooth for my keyboard, which works just fine under Windows. But with linux connection can often drop, and also very often some letters are typed much more then they needed. \nExample:\nLikkkkkkkkkke tttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhatt!!!!!!!!!\n\nOften after that loops it disconnects. If i am  turning off the keyboard during that loop, it will still continue to type for a long time, that is why I am sure, that it is a linux drivers issue.\nAny ideas please how to make work more stable? \n\nA: If low battery charge is not the issue (which it may well be, based on Your description), one thing that may fix Your issue would be to try a newer kernel version.\nUpgrading Your kernel may seem difficult, but it is actually fairly straight forward, provided that there are newer versions packaged and available (which is almost always the case).\nTo check Your current kernel version, open up a Terminal enter the following command:\nuname -a\n\nThe output will look similar to this:\nLinux {hostname removed} 4.5.2-040502-generic #201604200335 SMP Wed Apr 20 07:37:26 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nAs You can see here, in my case I have chosen to upgrade to kernel version 4.5.\nHere is a guide that explains how to do this in more detail: http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2016/03/upgrade-linux-kernel-4-5-ubuntu/\nNote: If You still experience issues, it could also be worth while to try uninstalling/removing the firmware mentioned in the other question that You originally linked to, as it may not be needed at all. I would suggest that You try experimenting with this.\nUpdate:\nI just stumbled upon this answer that may also help You out: Drivers for Broadcom BCM43142 on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr)\n\nA: Installed Bluez 5.27 from bluez.org (newer are laggy for me) and lags gone away.

This behavior seems semi-random, that is why I find it difficult to search for a solution. Also it is important to note that this behavior only seems to happen with my  screen and not with projectors for example.\nI say semi-random because it often (but not always) happens when I logout/restart/start a new program. These actions also often (again not always) tend to turn the screen on again. \nexample: \nI start my pc up and everything works fine. Then after doing some work for some time: \nI start a program/do nothing special/logout/... \nand my second screen goes black, saying it does not get any input. Then after repeatedly logging out/in or (un)plugging the HDMI cable it goes back online again. This repeats itself from time to time and drives me crazy, I really do not have a clue what it could be, hope you guys can help me!\nSetup:\nI have Ubuntu 15.10 running on a dell latitude 3340 with HDMI output and also an IIyama screen with VGA input. I connect my screen with an HDMI to VGA converter. \n\nA: If the HDMI cable is not the issue, it could also be worth while to upgrade to a more recent video driver.\nThere should be options for upgrading Your driver here: https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/intel-graphics-installer-linux-1.4.0\n", "Q: Why are the window buttons on the left? MS-Windows cribbed the original X-Windows button layout. Then for some unknown reason Ubuntu puts them on the left!!!\nYou don't change the layout of your keyboard every time you change your operating system, so why change the window button layout?\n\nA: Having windows buttons on the left side is not really unusual:\n Apple Macintosh\n MS Windows 1.0\n Atari TOS\n Apple OSX\nComing from an Atari ST I immediately felt at home with Ubuntu's windows buttons on the left. For me it was and still is the right place. I never felt comfortable with right sided Windows' buttons.\nSo the question should rather be why some operating systems won't let us move them to where we want them to be.\nUbuntu does not force us to live with left-sided buttons. You are free to move them to the right, just as you personally prefer, simply by choosing a windows manager different to Unity:\n\n", "Q: Extremely poor sound quality after upgrading from 15.10 to 16.04 This is a bit of an odd problem, but after upgrading to Xenial, something went wrong with my sound quality, which was working beautifully under 15.10.\nAfter the upgrade, there is a strong distortion that sounds as if I had blown speakers (I don't). This is true for system sounds or any audio/video files I play. Even with the volume at 50%, it's still a problem. \nI have no idea where to begin as this has never happened before.

The (ex-totem?) Video player proposes the installation of gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad, but after installation there is no playback, nothing. When I try to open the .midi file again, the Video player comes up with the installation again and again. So I guess, this is not the right package.\nUPDATE: Rythmbox isn't configured to play .midi files either.\n\n\nA: The gstreamer method of playing MIDI is to use the sound card's sequencer to do so. However, many sound cards do not necessarily have an instrument for playing MIDI, these days. Instead, you will need to install a software sequencer, such as timidity to play the files.\n\nA: I needed proper sound fonts. \nsudo apt install fluid-soundfont-gm fluid-soundfont-gs\n\n\nA: Open the terminal and enter:\nsudo apt install timidity timidity-interfaces-extra\n\nEnter your password, another prompt may appear type, Y and hit enter.\nGo to your menu, you should now have an application called TiMidity++  launch it. In terminal would be timidity mymusic.mid.\nIn TiMidity++ go to File > load and redirect it the location of your midi file, select the file, then okay then play\n\nA: VLC media player can do that for you given that the plugin for midi is installed.\nsudo apt install vlc vlc-plugin-fluidsynth\n\nAfter that you can play your midi library with VLC without installing timidity. \n\nA: There is also a Firefox plugin now: MIDI Player.\nIf all you need is playing the occasional MIDI that comes up on web pages like on Wikipedia, this may be the simplest solution.\n", "Q: Mosquitto Configuration on 16.04 I installed the MQTT mosquitto package from the standard repos on a fresh 16.04. I'm confused about where to place/edit the conf file for MQTT to work with a username and password.\nThere is a conf file in /etc/mosquitto/ however in reading that file it says to place \"your\" conf file in /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/. The conf file in /etc/mosquitto looks like the one you are supposed to edit. I tried editing that file and simply creating a new one and putting it in the place that was mentioned but nothing seemed to work.\nThere is an example conf but it is in /var/share/doc/mosquitto/.\nIf anyone familiar with running mosquitto on Ubuntu could chime it it would be helpful. I thought the config should be straight forward you put in the line to set anonymous connections to false and then set the path to your pwd file but I seem to either be putting it in the wrong place or using it incorrectly.\n\nA: I made the mistake of trying to edit the conf I found in the /etc/mosquitto directory.

This is a fairly fresh install. The only installs I have done are mate-desktop, xrdp, dropbear, and busybox. My client is PuTTY on a Windows machine. I am fairly new to Linux, but here is the progress I have made:\n\n*\n\n*Installed dropbear and busybox\n\n\n*Used puttygen to generate a key pair\n\n\n*Copied public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and set proper permissions (700 on directory, 600 on file)\n\n\n*Copied public key to /etc/initramfs-tools/root/.ssh/authorized_keys and set proper permissions (700 on directory, 600 on file)\n\n\n*Confirmed my keys are good by successfully connecting to normal user session via PuTTY using key authentication\n\n\n*Created the script and modified the config files as outlined at this link\n(Note: I did not perform step 8, but my /var/log/auth.log file did not contain the errors showcased in the Troubleshoot section of that blogpost if step 8 is not performed.)\n\n\n*Updated initramfs\nWhen the system boots and shows the graphical LUKS unlock prompt, I get no response from the server when I try to connect via PuTTY.

Before marking this as a duplicate please read all of the things I have tried. I have tried every solution I've found on the forums so far.\nBefore I get into the solutions I've tried I'll better define what I mean by \"freeze\". They screen locks up and nothing is responsive at all. The mouse doesn't move, the backlit keys such as caps lock do not light up when pressed, I cannot ssh into the machine, it no longer appears on my WiFi network, and REISUB does not have an effect on the machine. It's as if the computer is off, but the screen is stuck on a certain image.\nThinking that I possibly had an issue with my hard drive, I ran badblocks and found that the hard drive was in good shape. Thinking that it might just be an issue with Ubuntu I decided to dual boot with Arch for a while, but it still froze with Arch Linux. I tried just wiping my hard drive with dd from a live disk and reinstalling, but it still freezes. I tried booting from a live USB for a while, but it still froze on the live USB.\nThinking that I had a potential problem with my RAM I ran memtest86 on my computer for about 24 hours and no errors were found. Thinking that it could be my graphics card I downloaded a program designed to overclock the graphics card, ran it for ~18 hours, and it didn't freeze.\nThinking maybe some components were overheating I installed software to monitor the temperatures of the CPU cores, graphics card, etc. When it froze with that software running all temperatures were in the healthy ranges.\nSome additional info: It seems to freeze far more often on Chrome (especially while using Netflix) than it does when using firefox. It usually freezes while a web browser is open, but has also frozen just while running commands from the terminal, when the terminal is the only program running. Ubuntu is currently the only OS installed. The issue existed when I was using 14.10 on the same machine, but has gotten worse with 15.04 and 15.10. Is it likely some kind of issue with my drivers? That's all I can think of, a driver issue.\nHere is the output of lspci:\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series SoC Transaction Register (rev 0e)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Graphics & Display (rev 0e)\n00:13.0 SATA controller: Intel Corporation Atom Processor E3800 Series SATA AHCI Controller (rev 0e)\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series USB xHCI (rev 0e)\n00:1a.0 Encryption controller: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Trusted Execution Engine (rev 0e)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series High Definition Audio Controller (rev 0e)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Atom Processor E3800 Series PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev 0e)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Atom Processor E3800 Series PCI Express Root Port 2 (rev 0e)\n00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Atom Processor E3800 Series PCI Express Root Port 3 (rev 0e)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Power Control Unit (rev 0e)\n02:00.0 Network controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

Its the CPU energy saving \"C state\". You add kernel parameter to prevent CPU entering above C state 1.\nedit /etc/default/grub and edit the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line adding intel_idle.max_cstate=1 to whatever might already be there. After saving the file run sudo update-grub, then re-boot.\n\nA: I have a very similar Toshiba system. I have the L15W-B1220, and I have the same hard freeze issue as you, and I have installed all the different flavors of Ubuntu from 14.04lts, 14.10, 15.04, 15.10, and 16.04, including all the sub flavors, Mate, Gnome, Kubuntu, etc, all of them lock up.\nMy belief is it's a kernel issue mostly. Installing the package toshset is supposed to allow us to control the Toshiba ACPI system from the command line, but the software reports that the kernel isn't configured to use Toshiba, which is incorrect, as kernel modules toshiba-wmi, and toshiba_acpi load/initialize just fine.\nI believe the real issue is the cooling system in these Toshiba 2 in 1 devices in Linux. It doesn't seem to be able to detect any fan in the device, even though it works fine in Windows 10.\nYour solution did not work for me, just broke the xserver. I have the same i915 chipset.\nBut I think I found a decent work around. I installed a few packages to monitor my CPU temps. ( apt install tlp tlp-stat thermald, lm-sensors, psensor, etc )  This low power consumption quad-core CPU supports throttling, so I set up thermal trip points to manage the temperature in the chassis... Disabling Turbo mode in the bios was the first step so it doesn't ever burst the clock speed to 2.6ghz, and keeps the CPU at its normal rated speed of 2.1ghz. When the temperature hits 55 Deg C, I have it set to drop the clock speed to its lowest (500mhz), and also drop the SATA chip down to power save (same thing happens when you unplug the a/c power source).\nOther things I configured were to shut off the charging when it gets to 98%, when the AC is plugged in, so it runs completely on the battery until about 80% before starting the charge process again.... If you leave the AC plugged in when the battery is at 99-100% charge, the heat increases dramatically. The system does not freeze in Windows 10 at all, everything seems to work as expected, so the issue is with the Toshiba \"Bios\" not reporting to Linux the exact acpi addresses needed for the internal hardware. Linux likes to match your system to a T, which is great for performance. Windows on the other hand, Toshiba, only seems to care about developing its windows drivers...\nIts not an optimal solution (work around), but it is a work around that seems to be holding up well so far the past week. Hopefully a solution comes out of the bug report I sent in for Ubuntu 16.04.\n", "Q: Difference between bash-shell and ksh-shell by using while with read - what can I do in bash for the same response as in ksh?

I installed it succesfully in computers with <= 2Gb and it runs pretty well.\nBy looking at you computer specs, you should probably go with the 32 bit version.\n", "Q: Is there any way to save my session in Ubuntu 16.04 (NOT hibernate)? I went through a lot of previous duplicates. But still....\nWell dconf editor > org > gnome > gnome-session > auto-save-session is not working. It doesn't prompt me to save during log off/reboot. On reboot my apps do not load start like before. \nIs there any way in 16.04? or am I doing something wrong here.\n\nA: I wrote a little tool that can do that and there is also a gnome-shell-extension that uses it. You can install it via npm install -g linux-window-session-manager. Nodejs needs to be installed and on some machines you have to add sudo to the command. Afterwards you can run: \nlwsm save sessionName\n# and\nlwsm restore sessionName\n\nNote that wayland applications are not included (but XWayland works fine).\n", "Q: What is the meaning of \"/.cache/\" in a path or directory? I was looking for a file \"file.odt\" so I used the find command:\nsudo find / -name \"file.odt\"\n\nWhile my computer came up with several paths to a number of copies of the same file, it also came up with a path that looks like this:\n\n/home/user/.cache/.fr-ShFl2I/file.odt\n\nNeedless to say, there is no folder called \".cache\" in \"user\". What is the meaning of this?\n\nA: The dot . at the start of a file name marks a file as hidden, which is why you don't see it.\nIn Files (Nautilus), you can use Ctrl+h to show hidden files. Or from the menu: View >> Show hidden files .\nIn a terminal, you can use ls -a to show all files, including hidden files.\nThe /home/<user>/.cache directory is commonly used by programs to store information that is specific to the user. \nThe .cache is intended to be used as an area for a program's temporary or working data. In practice, however, it is still a good idea to understand how a program uses its data in the /.cache before deleting it.\n\nA: The ~/.cache/ directory is defined in the XDG Base Directory Specification to be used for “user-specific non-essential (cached) data”.  It's similar to what system-wide applications or services would put in /var/cache/.\nThe files in that directory are usually used by the application to make things go faster, to store logs or other data that can be useful to debug problems or recover from a crash, to keep a local version of data that can be (re-)downloaded from the network, etc.  Deleting them while the application is not running should not have serious effects, but it will often have some effect.\nA good example is thumbnails: keeping them there makes the file manager a lot faster when viewing a directory with a lot of pictures that you visited before, but if you delete them it will simply recreate the thumbnails (which might take a long time if there are many images, of course).\nThe . at the front of a directory or file name makes it “hidden” on UNIX/Linux systems.  You can view hidden files in the default Ubuntu file manager by pressing Ctrl+H, or View → Show Hidden Files in the menu (and the same to hide them again).  Many of the other hidden files or directories you will see that way contain configuration or other data (e.g. bookmarks, e-mail, etc.) that might be important for you, so be careful not to delete those!\n", "Q: Multiple Monitors while running Ubuntu on VM Ware, with Windows Host I've re-installed VM Ware Tools (following instructions from here Ubuntu 15.10: multiple monitors do not work within VMware).

I switched to 14.04 and dual monitor now works.\n\nA: This seems to be a bug in ubuntu open-vm-tools in combination with ubuntu 16.04. Vmware did notice the issue in the release notes of vmware player and workstation.\nI have tried several things but without luck.

I was just thinking that if I need to access the Ubuntu terminal from a machine like Windows is there a way I can simply enter my server's ip address and see my server's terminal. Both the machines are on the same network. ssh is one way. But can I see my server's terminal on a web browser or is it is impossible?\n\nA: It is possible, but you'd need a web server set up to serve an SSH session through a webpage using something like ShellInABox: https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox\nThat type of setup seems unnecessarily complicated to me, and probably presents new security holes that you wouldn't otherwise have on your server.\nA much easier way to see your server's terminal would be to use a Windows program like PuTTY: http://www.putty.org/ or even the Google Chrome extension Secure Shell: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo which both use your server's standard SSH software.\n", "Q: What is the correct or better server to use I live in the USA and was wondering what server I should use for updates, archive.ubuntu.com or us.archive.ubuntu.com.  What is the difference betweeen them?\nTIA,\nA4Skyhawk\n\nA: You can make yourself a list of the quickest responding mirrors by using the following command in terminal:\nsudo netselect -v -s4 -t10 `wget -q -O- https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors | grep -P -B8 \"statusUP|statusSIX\" | grep -o -P \"(f|ht)tp.*\\\"\" | tr '\"\\n' ' '`\n\nThis will give you at the end an output like this:\n   94 http://mirror.network32.net/ubuntu/\n   96 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\n   98 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\n  100 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\n\nSide note: this tests the ping speeds and is not necessarily output the fastest servers but you can assume that you might be able to use the one with 100 rating and get good results.\nAs fkraiem pointed out the netselect package is not officially avaiable in ubuntu (still not sure how I got it then) but you can download the source code here and find its homepage here. Or you can download the package here\n\nA: Both repository server mirrors are okay to use.\nYou usually check what servers are near to your location, and out of those you select one with a high free data rate, low ping time from your location, and of course it has to be a mirror that is up to date.\nYou could look at this official list and compare them yourself.\nAlternatively, let the system pick the currently best server for you:\nOpen your System Settings, click Software & Updates and in the Ubuntu Software tab, open the Download from drop-down menu.\nYou will see a list of at least the entries Main Server, Server for [your country] and Other.... Select Other... to get the advanced menu.\nA dialogue pops up that offers you a list of all registered mirrors on the left side. You could pick your favourite manually from there. But if you prefer the automatic way, click the Select best server button on the right.\nUbuntu will now make a few tests and compare the mirrors in your region. After a while (usually less than a minute) it has found the currently optimal mirror for you and selects it. Confirm and exit. When you get asked whether to reload the software lists, do that as well.\n", "Q: Getting smooth Terminal fonts under Gnome 3 In Gnome 3, the Terminal/monospace font rendering is really bad - not smooth, but thin and jagged.\nWhat can I do to make it smooth, somewhat \"blurry\"?

My current partition state is as shown in the image.\n\nI had Ubuntu 12.04 installed on a 19.22 GB partition, and I removed it and deleted the partition. Now I want to extend /dev/sda2 to include the 19.22 GB unallocated space that's right after it. However, GParted won't let me do that.\nI think it has something to do with the hierarchical way the partitions are presented (the unallocated space seems to be a part of /dev/sda4 somehow), but I have no idea how to solve this. \n\nA: In order to grow primary partition sda2, the unallocated space must be immediately adjacent.  Currently it is within extended partition sda4.\nThe steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from live media containing GParted, e.g. GParted Live.\n\n*Shrink extended partition sda4 to butt up against sda5.\n\n*Grow primary partition sda2 into the adjacent unallocated space.\n\n\nSee also Moving Space Between Partitions\n\nA: /dev/sda4 is an extended partition where your free space is and what has been a logical partition.\n/dev/sda2 is a primary partion. You could merge the space with /dev/sda5 (and /dev/sda6) if you boot from a Live-CD/DVD/USB as fkraiem has already told.\nYou cannot \"move\" the space from an extended partion to a primary one.

If it isn't empty rmdir will fail. It is a good practice that will prevent unwanted deletion, hidden files for example.\n\nA: Although Ronan did give a pretty good answer, there is also a more thorough difference, that can be seen by inferring what the command stands for.\n\n\n*\n\n*rmdir will remove a directory at the specified path, BUT, rmdir if given a path to a file such as a .deb or .jar file will not know what to do.\n\n*rm -r or rm -rf will be able to completely terminate any file that you have permission to delete. I would wholeheartedly recommend NOT using the -f flag with rm, as even if you type a single character wrong, you can break your installation, something we don't want to happen.\nAddressing your second question, I assume you are asking if it is necessary to include the path, and the answer to that is yes. Although commands can work on a local directory depending on your directory access in Terminal, using commands that can delete files is not a good idea in a local directory, because with one screw up, again, you can mess with your entire installation.\n", "Q: Understanding Linux Partition Table In Windows OS I used to have 2 partitions: \npartition #1: Windows OS\npartition #2: WorkPlace\nPlease take a look at my current partition set up:\n\nPartition    | File system   | Mount Point | Flags\n===================================================\n/dev/sda1    | btrfs         | /           | boot\n/dev/sda2    | extended      |             | \n  /dev/sda5  | btrfs         | /home       | \n  /dev/sda6  | linux-swap    |             |\n\nQuestions: \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I know if all my personal files such as: videos, musics, work docs, php scripts, web templates, etc .... are been saved in sda5/home?\n\n*How can I make sure Ubuntu is installed on sda1?\n\nA: Question 1\nIt's pretty likely that all the files are in /home/USERNAME since it's the default save location for all those. Although an app (or you) may have chosen to save some files elsewhere.\nQuestion 2\nSure, it's installed at /dev/sda1 - you can figure that out by looking at the partition setup image you gave, since / (the root of the filesystem, where Ubuntu installs to) is mounted at /dev/sda1.\n", "Q: after installation of easyshutdown nothing happens when i click on it ubuntu 16.04 i've just installed easyshutdown but when i click on it it rises up for some seconds and stops running.

Keep opening folders until you find your pictures.  If all the folders are empty, then something may have gone wrong when you imported the pictures into Shotwell.  If you run Shotwell you should see your pictures if they imported correctly; you should be able to right-click on one of the pictures in Shotwell and click Properties to see exactly where it is stored.

In that case, 8 GB is a must.  You must be using the 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 of course.\n\n*You need to install the  Oracle JDK 8 and this can be done by adding the webupd8team java ppa to your system (sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java) and installing both oracle-java8-installer and oracle-java8-set-default.\n\n*Install the complete KVM/qemu on your system by following the instructions given here.\nIn the beginning, you will find instructions on how to check if your system's processor is ok for use with KVM.\nDon't forget to log off and back on after the installation, otherwise your user will not be activated as a member of the libvirtd group and you will not be able to use KVM.\n\n*Download the latest Android Studio .zip file from the Android Developer's site and make sure you install the 32-bit support files listed over there.\nNOTE: The file lib32bz2-1.0 does not exist on 16.04, so you have to install libbz2-1.0:i386 instead, using sudo apt-get install libbz2-1.0:i386.\n\n*Extract the contents of the .zip file in a folder of your choice and create a launcher for the studio.sh file you will find in the android-studio/bin folder and if everything else is ok, it should run fine.\nYou will need to install all the necessary libraries and images using the android SDK and create the AVD's you'll be using of course but I think you must know that already since you are a developer.  In order for the emulator to actually use KVM, you must start it using these emulator parameters:\n\n/pathTo/emulator -avd avd_name -qemu -m 1024 -enable-kvm\n\nUpdate: The command above has been deprecated.  You can run your emulator with full hardware virtualization support now by simply using -accel on.\n\n/pathTo/emulator -avd avd_name -accel on\n\nThis switch is not necessary though, since the default setting for -accel is auto which means that if KVM is installed correctly, it will be used by default.\nThe value of 1024 is an example.  Use the same amount of memory you configured your AVD to use.  Further instructions on how to insert the parameters above to android-studio instead of launching the emulator manually, you can find on the android developers site.  Personally, I prefer to launch it manually and have it there whenever I need it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu linux 16.04 LTS localhost/phpmyadmin empty I've followed the procedures on installing LAMP on ubuntu linux 16.04 LTS but when i tried to go localhost/phpmyadmin it says that \n\"Not Found\nThe requested URL /phpmyadmin/ was not found on this server.\nApache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu) Server at localhost Port 80\"\n\nHow To fix this kind of error?\n\n\nA: You need to configure your apache2.conf to make phpMyAdmin work.

There I can add my gmail account, but there's no way to select the calendar application in the \"The following applications integrate with your Google account\".\nHowever, after I installed the gnome \"user interface\" and the gnome-shell (sorry for using the wrong lingo, it's my first time doing this), I could see the new option in the calendar settings. I did that and it worked well.\nHowever, I was so frustrated with gnome (several apps crashing multiple times, work spaces lackluster, pixel bugs and finally a failure of locking the screen using a hotkey, no matter whether I install xscreensaver on top of lightdm or not), that I went back to Unity.\nNow in Unity, my Calendar app still has the google entries that it used to have before (so something is apparently working; but whether they will be updated/refreshed I am not sure), but Calendar Settings still doesn't give me the option of integrating gmail and other calendars.\nHow do I get that functionality?

I am having difficulties mounting an USB drive. It shows this error:\nmount: can't find /dev/sdb1/mnt in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab\n\nHow can I get rid of this error?\n\nA: Why this error?\nYou probably forgot to tell mount where to mount your drive.\nLinux uses device files (/dev/sda, /dev/sdb1, etc.). And unlike Windows drives (C:, D:, etc.), you cannot access them directly (cd /dev/sdb1 will inevitably fail, telling you that it is not a directory but a file). If you want to open a drive with mount, you need to provide a mountpoint. A mountpoint is a directory wherein your USB drive will be opened and where you will be able to access your files.\n\nSolution\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a  directory that you will use as the mountpoint for your drive:\nmkdir /mnt/mydrive\n\n\n*Mount your drive with this command:\nmount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive\n\nNote: If you don't know your drive's device file, you can run sudo fdisk -l or lsblk to identify the partition you're looking for.\n\n*Now if you run ls /mnt/mydrive, it should list your drive's files.\n\n*When you're done, don't forget to unmount your USB drive before removing it from the computer:\numount /dev/sdb1\n\n\nMore information about this error\n/etc/fstab is a file in which you can associate a partition with a mountpoint, allowing you to run mount <device> instead of mount <device> <mountpoint>. This is why you get this confusing error.\nfstab has many more uses like mounting a partition at boot time, etc. More information about fstab on the Arch Linux wiki\n\nA: To know your device name use sudo fdisk. Your device can be recognized by its size, and probably looks like /dev/sdx, where x could be any letter from a to z. (Usually a is assigned to your first internal hard-drive)\nTo mount a usb drive sudo mount <Your Device Name>  <Mount Position>, for example:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt\n\nTo access what you have just mounted use the position where you have mounted. In the above example I have used /mnt, so I would type:\ncd /mnt\n\n\nA: sudo mkdir /mnt/spider \nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sda2 /mnt/spider\nRemember to replace the drives name from /dev/sda2 to yours.

I'm not sure how to go about fixing this? It seems to have started happening only since I upgraded to 16.04, and I'm using vpnc (Cisco VPN) on top of the Network-Manager thing.\nThe syslog just contains info like the UI, e.g it shows the states going from waiting for authorisation to disconnected, it doesn't say anything about trying to prompt for auth.\nSo far I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-installing the network-manager\n\n*Restarting dbus\n\n*Multiple reboots\n\n*Cleaning out the folder with all the network configurations in and starting \"from scratch\"\n\n\nThese steps were taken from the answers in: Unable to connect to VPN using gnome-network-manager\nWhich this may be a duplicate of?

Any idea on how i can fix this (if it's a bug) or how i can manually add the 'Open With Other Application' entry (if it's suppose not to be there due to creator's choice)?\nEdit:\nAdding a custom script as described by pomsky is a great solution. Although, I see that when you right-click some files have an 'Open With Other Application' entry and some others (like .xml) have an 'Open With' entry and then you choose 'Other Application'. Is there any way to add something similar for .desktop files. Maybe by editing something in /usr/share/caja folder? I see some 'open with' code at /usr/share/caja/ui/caja-directory-view-ui.xml but i can't understand it. \n\nA: You may try this not-so-elegant workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the directory ~/.config/caja/scripts/.\n\n*Create an empty document, name it Open-with-Pluma.\n\n*Open the document and enter the following two lines:\n#!/bin/sh\npluma $CAJA_SCRIPT_SELECTED_URIS\n\n\n*Save & close the document and mark as executable.\n\n*Log out and log in again.\n\n\nNow you should see an extra item called Scripts in the context menu (right-click menu).

This may be silly question for some more experienced guys. I have more than 100 GB of unallocated space on my hard drive. So I was thinking, that instead of using the space in my Ubuntu partition, it would be nice if the (virtual) hard drive for VirtualBox could be created in that unallocated space. Because once I have more than one or two OS-s installed in VirtualBox they occupy considerable amount of space in Ubuntu partition.\nI have dual boot Ubuntu 14.04 and Win 8.1.\n\nA: A virtual hard drive is a file, so it needs to go in a partition that is formatted with a file system.  There's nothing stopping you from creating a partition for some or all of your unallocated space, formatting the partition, and then putting your virtual hard drive file or files there.\n\nA: Yes, but only after you format the unallocated space.  \nIn Windows 8.1, right-click on the Start button and select 'Disk Management'.  Once the snap-in loads, right-click on the unallocated partition, Select 'New Simple Volume' and follow the steps to choose the size of the partition, Volume name, Drive Letter, format, and other options.\nIn Ubuntu, gparted (a partition management tool) can be used to create the partition\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nA partition can then be created and formatted in the unallocated space.\n\nA: *\n\n*Unallocated space needs to be formatted first. It would be safer to\nformat it as NTFS since you have a dual boot setup. That way files\nwould be accessible from both Windows and Ubuntu.\n\n*Transfer your existing VHD or other virtual hard disk file to that\nnew partition and load it into Virtualbox. (Link your virtual OS to the new location where you copied your VHD)\n\n*Change the settings for your virtual OS in Virtualbox and increase it to the size you wish to allocate\n\n\nE.g. \n\n\n*\n\n*My Ubuntu-1 VHD file is in partition A (Flexible allocation of 8GB)\n\n*I format my unallocated space to NTFS and call it partition B\n\n*I move my VHD file to B and update Ubuntu-1's storage settings to link it to its new location\n\n*I increase allocation of the VHD to 250GB now\nHope this helps\n", "Q: text to G-code converter I'm curious, is there a text to G-Code converter? Something where I could type a string, and get G-Code output that a 3D printer, or CNC machine could understand?\n\nA: G-code program lists are actually text files. The output of a post processor is a text file. That file is then loaded into a control memory, and executed with that control's cycle start button.\nSo, are you looking for an app that will output a line of g-code given another input (conversational)? Or an open source CAM system? CAM systems are the standard tool for creating tool path, but there is a learning curve if you've never used one. It is possible to work in a text editor and create templates of your most common program structures that would give a base program that could be edited for specific situations.\n", "Q: What is temp sensor pch_wildcat_point-virtual?

And if it is, is that some point in my laptop that has a temperature sensor?\n\nA: The Lenovo x1 carbon has an Intel H97 PCH (Platform Controller Hub), which was codenamed \"Wildcat Point\" during development. This \"system on a chip\" performs functions such as I/O (input/output) on the Gigabit LAN, SATA, PCIe & USB port and also contains various timers and controllers.\nIt has an internal temperature sensor located near its hottest point (the interface to the CPU) and sensors is reporting this.

There is not much to say. After I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 10, I am unable to boot to a live USB! I used to do it all the time before I installed Ubuntu. I am unable to find an answer online. I don't have the option in BIOS to boot to USB anymore like I used to. And there is no USB option to enable or disable in BIOS. \nSo whats going on here? How can I fix the problem?\nThank you!\n\nA: NOTE :\nOlder versions of Kali Linux distros did not have EFI support. In this special case you have to enable legacy support in BIOS. The procedure to do this varies depending on the vendor setup.\nIf you have an EFI supported version of Kali Linux such as the rolling-edition, follow these steps to create a bootable USB. In this example I consider the USB drive as /dev/sdb1 - it may vary, so execute sudo fdisk -l to determine your USB drive.\nFirst un-mount the USB disk : umount /dev/sdb1\nCreate the bootable USB disk : \nsudo dd if=/path/to/Your-kali-iso/kali-linux-2016.1-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=512k && sync\n\nThe dd command provides no feedback until the process is completed, but if your drive has an access indicator, you will see it flickering from time to time. The output will be something like:\n5618+1 records in\n5618+1 records out\n2945482752 bytes (2.9 GB, 2.7 GiB) copied, 287.421 s, 10.2 MB/s\n\nNow you should see your USB pendrive in BIOS.\n", "Q: Can't open Google Chrome on Ubuntu 16.04 When ever I try to open Google Chrome from the terminal I get this.

These are my partitions, but I can't tell which is which. I don't want to delete the wrong one.So as you can already tell, I am pretty much a newbie to the world of Linux.

This is the same environment you booted to in order to install Ubuntu in the first place.\nThere should be a utility (e. g. gparted) that you can use to remove the Ubuntu installation from the laptop.

I was able to decypt using 'gpg2' instead of gpg\n\nThen you're already using GnuPG 2.1, which stores the secret keys in the pubring.gpg.

At the login screen DO NOT log in instead do a NORMAL restart (click shutdown icon at the top right area of the screen).\nAfter the PC restarts then log in.\nNetwork connections were back when I did these steps.\n\n\nA: You can do it this way to fix the problem:\nDownload file:\n\n\n*\n\n*libnl-3-200_3.2.21-1_XXX.deb\n\n*libnl-route-3-200_3.2.21-1_XXX.deb\n\n*libnl-genl-3-200_3.2.21-1_XXX.deb\nOS 32bit: XXX = i386 ||\nOS 64bit: XXX = amd64\nLink:\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/libn/libnl3/\nTo them into one folder and install them with the command:\n\nsudo dpkg -i lib*.deb\n\nThen Reboot.\nDone :3\n\nA: I would not recommend downgrading packages or installing new ones by hand - this will inevitably lead to version issues later on. The best fix to this issue is simply to upgrade the network-manager package.\nThe first thing to do is to connect manually to the internet; while the network-manager is dead this does not mean you can not connect. \n1. Open a terminal and edit the interfaces file:\nsudo pico /etc/network/interfaces\nThere add the following lines, they indicate the eth0 interface should no longer be managed:\nallow-hotplug eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\n2. With this the connection can be started manually:\nsudo ifup eth0\nNote that there will be no notification in the panel - this is a manual connection. Give it a try with ping or firing up your internet browser. \n3. Now update the apt meta-data:\nsudo apt-get update\nAnd upgrade the network-manager package:\nsudo apt-get upgrade network-manager\n4. Make sure you now have version 0.9.8.8-0ubuntu7.3 installed:\napt-cache show network-manager\n5. Now edit again the interfaces file and remove or comment the lines added in step 1.:\nsudo pico /etc/network/interfaces\n6. Finally reboot the system.\n\nA: I got the same problem today.\nTLDR: downgrade libnl3 or upgrade network-manager.\nAs per this answer, problem is that a fix in libnl3 caused a regression in network-manager. Then, it was only a bug for -proposed packages, but I guess bug was tested enough that it could be introduced into regular Ubuntu ;).\nSafest way is to take a step back and install earlier versions of libnl-3-200 libnl-genl-3-200 libnl-route-3-200 (see details in said answer).\nThis leaves you with downgraded packages. Remember to not upgrade them until relevant upgrade for network-manager is available.\nAlternatively (I did this), you can take a step ahead and install newer version of network-manager:\nfor amd64 or for i386. You can download package on different system and pass it with USB stick. Or download it with your smartphone and pass it via USB.\nInstall it with:\nsudo dpkg -i network-manager_*.deb\n\nYou can try to get networking by just restarting NetworkManager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nBut I needed to reboot to get systray applet back.\n", "Q: Magento PHP cron job fail to open required php files We are trying to set up cron job for Magento site.\nWe tried this Job, but it didn't work for us:\n*/5 * * * * php -f /var/www/html/sitename/cron.php\n\nTo debug we tried this Job:\n*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/php  -q /var/www/html/sitename/cron.php > \n/var/www/html/sitename/cron-temp.log 2>&1\n\nAs a result, we found these errors in cron-temp.log:\nPHP Warning:  require(app/bootstrap.php): failed to open stream:\n No such file or directory in /var/www/html/sitename/cron.php on line 30\n\n    PHP Fatal error:  require(): Failed opening required 'app/bootstrap.php' \n(include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www/html/sitename\n/cron.php on line 30\n\ncron.php\n<?php\n\n\n// Change current directory to the directory of current script\nchdir(dirname(__FILE__));\n\nrequire 'app/bootstrap.php';\nrequire 'app/Mage.php';\n\nif (!Mage::isInstalled()) {\n    echo \"Application is not installed yet, please complete install wizard first.\";\n    exit;\n}\n\n// Only for urls\n// Don't remove this\n$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] = str_replace(basename(__FILE__), 'index.php', $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']);\n$_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] = str_replace(basename(__FILE__), 'index.php', $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']);\n\nMage::app('admin')->setUseSessionInUrl(false);\n\numask(0);\n\n$disabledFuncs = explode(',', ini_get('disable_functions'));\n$isShellDisabled = is_array($disabledFuncs) ? in_array('shell_exec', $disabledFuncs) : true;\n$isShellDisabled = (stripos(PHP_OS, 'win') === false) ? $isShellDisabled : true;\n$isShellDisabled = true;\n\ntry {\n    if (stripos(PHP_OS, 'win') === false) {\n        $options = getopt('m::');\n        if (isset($options['m'])) {\n            if ($options['m'] == 'always') {\n                $cronMode = 'always';\n            } elseif ($options['m'] == 'default') {\n                $cronMode = 'default';\n            } else {\n                Mage::throwException('Unrecognized cron mode was defined');\n            }\n        } else if (!$isShellDisabled) {\n            $fileName = basename(__FILE__);\n            $baseDir = dirname(__FILE__);\n            shell_exec(\"/bin/sh $baseDir/cron.sh $fileName -mdefault 1 > /dev/null 2>&1 &\");\n            shell_exec(\"/bin/sh $baseDir/cron.sh $fileName -malways 1 > /dev/null 2>&1 &\");\n            exit;\n        }\n    }\n\n    Mage::getConfig()->init()->loadEventObservers('crontab');\n    Mage::app()->addEventArea('crontab');\n    if ($isShellDisabled) {\n        Mage::dispatchEvent('always');\n        Mage::dispatchEvent('default');\n    } else {\n        Mage::dispatchEvent($cronMode);\n    }\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    Mage::printException($e);\n    exit(1);\n}\n\n\nA: PHP Fatal error:  require(): Failed opening required 'app/bootstrap.php' \n(include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear')\n\nIt looks like your required files cant be found and so it is throwing the error.

PHP looks for these in the include paths specified by php.ini and additionally in the document root for the apache module thus why the site itself works, for the command line version of PHP this additional path is the current working directory.\nIt should work if you make sure that PHP is executed from the document root ie change cron to run the command as follows:\n*/5 * * * * cd /var/www/html/sitename && php -f /var/www/html/sitename/cron.php\n\n", "Q: Can't use --help with printf Most programs print usage and quit with \"--help\".

However I cannot get suspend to work properly (really saving energy). I know the hardware can suspend as another Dell running Windows does suspend properly. The command I am using is \"systemctl suspend\", but the result is \"freeze\" instead of \"mem\", i.e. disks spin down, system does no longer react to input, but power consumption still close to active. I also tried \"pm-suspend\" which does nothing at all. A cat /sys/power/state shows just freeze and disk, no mem.\nI do have dmesg output with debugging info, but it does not fit the 30000 characters limit, and also I cannot see a real error there.

Yesterday I lost my internet connection after rebooting my Ubuntu 16.04 installation. Now when Ubuntu boots, it searches for a network for a couple of minutes, then states \"Connection established\" but I can't get online or communicate (send ping requests, for instance) to anyone.\nI deleted the ethernet network, hoping it would re-initialize if I re-added it. When I click the network manager icon, the \"Ethernet Network\" is greyed out (so I can't enable it). There is a new entry now, called \"Auto Ethernet\" but that one doesn't work (same symptoms as I mentioned earlier).\nIf I try to add a new ethernet network connection, the \"eth0\" is gone from the list of devices.

Restart the Network Manager after changes: sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager. Obsolete entries in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections can be deleted; if necessary, they will be recreated.\n\n*do away with NetworkManager altogether, as described here. In this case, the file /etc/networking/interfaces is decisive.\nThe fact that your network interface was renamed has to do with systemd adhering to a standard called \"Predictable Network Interface Names\" described here.\n", "Q: Why is it that I am unable to format my pendrive in exfat using gparted?

So, \"sudo apt install exfat-fuse\" should work.\n\nA: While Gparted cannot handle exFAT format, beside other tools that can (Gnome Disks, KDE Partition Manager), there is also the USB Stick Formatter, part of the mintstick tool (which includes both an USB Formatter and an USB Writter), and it covers exFAT format.\n\nIt is default in Linux Mint but can be installed in Ubuntu as deb from packages.linuxmint.com or pkgs.org. \n\nA: Workaround: use gnome-disks\nThis is the default pre-installed disk manager tool on Ubuntu that shows on the Dash as \"Disks\".\nYou can also launch if from the terminal with:\ngnome-disks\n\nEnsure that you have the exfat backend installed:\nsudo apt install exfat-utils\n\nThen as of Ubuntu 18.04:\n\n*\n\n*Gears button\n\n*Format Partition\n\n*Type: \"Other\"\n\n*Next\n\n*exfat\n\n\n\n\nThe GUI was a bit different in older versions: GUI tool for formating to exFAT\nThis is the only non-archaic filesystem I could find that works natively on all of current Mac OS, Windows and Linux, what a world to live in.\n", "Q: Unable to install mongodb on ubuntu 15.10 There is an errors when executing,the error as follows.\npccs063@pccs063-System-Product-Name:~$ mongo\nMongoDB shell version: 2.4.14\nconnecting to: test\nFri May 13 13:03:55.501 Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017 at src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:145\nexception: connect failed\n\n\nA: This problem could be solved by the below mentioned 5 steps\nStep 1: Remove lock file.\nsudo rm /var/lib/mongodb/mongod.lock\n\nStep 2: Repair mongodb. \nsudo mongod --repair\n\nStep 3: start mongodb.\nsudo start mongodb \n\nor\nsudo service mongodb start\n\nStep 4: Check status of mongodb.\nsudo status mongodb \n\nor   \nsudo service mongodb status\n\nStep 5: Start mongo console.\nmongo\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu GNOME and high resolution screen: icons in QT apps are too small. How to solve? my brother got a new laptop, a Thinkpad X1 Carbon 4th generation.

I experimented with QT_SCALE_FACTOR=2.5 QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0.8 calibre in the terminal and it worked!\nSo, basically (if my guess is correct), QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR controls the overall scaling except the font, while QT_SCALE_FACTOR controls font scaling only.\nI also added these two variables to the desktop file of calibre:\nbefore:\nExec=calibre --detach %F\n\nafter:\nExec=env QT_SCALE_FACTOR=2.5 QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0.8 calibre --detach %F\n\nAlso you may want to take a look at this github issue.\n\nA: The answer depends on which version of qt you are using, qt4 or qt5. The following will tell you which version of qt you are using.\nldd $(which $NAME) | grep qt -i\nFor qt5 you can use an environment variable QT_SCALE_FACTOR, for qt4 you can change font sizes using qtconfig-qt4, but it would appear that icon sizes don't scale.  You might, however, be able to use a different icon set, or if you are very energetic scale up another icon set yourself.\nSee https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI for more details and details for other toolkits.\n\nA: Para 1:__  You have several choices.  The situation can be resolved temporarily using the Displays setting under Systems Settings, or using a terminal and making use of the xrandr utility.\nPara 2:__ Enter xrandr by itself, and you see the possible YYYYxXXXX settings recorded in the video card's RAM.  Pick one and enter xrandr -s YYYYxXXXX (i.e. 1024x768) and hit Enter.  The monitor will blank out, then come back at the new settings.  If it does not blank out, you are already at that setting. (Note the RAM settings can be in error.  There may be other hidden settings that were not included either).\nPara 3:__ xrandr is an extremely powerful utility.  This is only scratching thec surface of what it is capable of.\nPara 4:__ Note some applications will automatically adjust to the new borders.  Meny don't, as they were written with one size screen in mind.  You can find ways to deal with this usually if a horizontal or vertical scrollbar does not automatically appear at the  bottom or right side of the screen.\nPara 5:__ One way is to move change the displayed window from its maximum settings and manipulate the borders.  Another is to move the Window off the center position.\nPara 6:__ Another way is to use any included zoom or magnify feature in the app.  Another is to use Select All, then Copy and Paste to put the contents elsewhere, like in LibreOffice Writer or gedit (leafpad, kate, jedit, cream are reasonable alternatives).\nPara 7:__ Putting the Copy & Paste into one of the text editors strips off the formatting and drops the link references, including images.  LibreOffice Suite keeps most of the contents intact. The Copy and Paste also handles text too small or hard to read by dropping all font, sizing, and coloring details.\nPara 8:__ The most helpful web browser I have found for performing these and other tasks is FlashPeak's Slimjet, which is multi-platform and free.  In some cases, you simply cannot get control of what is displayed well enough to work at a lower resolution.\nPara 9:__ But if you can't get the image or web page to to a useful size, you have several outs.  You have gsettings (dconf-editor is the GUI equivalent) for making changes in terms of fonts, size, magnification, the mouse, and much more. \nPara 10:__ The most effective search tool combination I have found for gsettings is this:\n        gsettings list-recursively | grep [whatever]\nPara 11:__ I just used \"gsettings list-recursively | grep cursor\" without the quotes in a terminal window, and got a list of settings which had \"cursor\" in the line.  [whatever] can be anything, and grep makes it easy to combine searches in one string using the \"|\" pipe option to chain the output of the commans on the left to as the input for the next command to the right.\nPara 12:__ I found one to change, \"org.mate.peripherals-mouse cursor-theme ''\".\nI want to use DMZ-White-Large, a custom cursor theme on these forums that eliminate all other cursor size possibilities.  T make this change, I enter:\n    gsettings set org.mate.peripherals-mouse cursor-theme 'DMZ-White-Large'\n\nPara 13:__ There is also a DMZ-White-Medium that sizes the cursor to 32 pixels.  Other sizes are 24 and 18, which is very very small on Hi-Res monitors at their maximum settinbgs (the default).\nPara 14:__ There are at least 2 other cursor influences.  One is XCursor, and the other is the \"com.canonical.Unity.Interface cursor-scale-factor\" found with gsettings (in dconf-editor, the periods equate to level separators, like the \"/\" does in folder and file structures (Windows and DOS use \"\\\" instead).\nPara 15:__ The scale factor roughly corresponds to 0.75 is 18 pixels, 1.0 equals 24 pixels, 1.35 is 32, 2.0 is 48, and 2.70 is 64, at the screen resolutions I am most familiar with.\nPara 16:__ Were the scale factor was truly used as intended. I believe the cursor would keep the same relative same size as the screen resolution changes.  That is not happening though, as changing the screen resolution also changes the size of the cursor displayed.\nPara 17:__ If you go to a low resolution setting, the present method is probably best.  If you intend to use high resolution, the scale factor approach would probably be best.  But this is not a matter of choice for the user.\nPara 18:__ It requires a logout/login sequence to change the mouse theme and size, so there is no practical way to adjust the cursor size on the fly.  I find white cursors best, but if you want black instead, you will also find custom DMZ-Black-Large and DMZ-Black-Medium files on this forum.  If you want more variety in mouse/cursor/X11 choices, they can be found via Google or Bing.  Just add linux, Ubuntu, or gnome to the search line to get ones that you can use.\nPara 19:__ Picking the right theme means using update-alternatives, gsettings, or the gnome-tweak-tool and unity-tweak-tool.  Specific instructions are posted elsewhere.\nPara 20:__ Some other interesting tools and options are \"dpkg -l *\" and \"man -k [terms]\".  The first lists all the packages in the Repositories, and the second lists information identified to man as possibly related to your area of interest.  Again, this is only the tip of the iceburg when it comes to what is possible with the commands and utilities provided in bash.\nPara 21:__ The best way to learn how to use individual commands and utilities is to search for examples online in forums, webpages, and articles.  look for matches that have the key terms linux, unix, bash, ubuntu, and words to reflect what you want to do or which command or utility you want to learn in detail.  Don't hesitate to add terms like sample or example or tutorial in your search.\nPara 22:__ You have five sources on your PC already:  man [command], info [command], help [command], and [command] --help are there to werve you, but rarely with real examples.  But your PC is cluttered with thousands of script files that illustrate the use of all the capabilities provided - you just have a problem weeding through the forest around you.  That is why the on-line search engines are so valuable, as it gets it all down to a few lines of code.\nPara 23:__ Which is the common complaint concerning my own posts.  I cover so much real estate in one post that people get lost in the forest of my words.  But now I am paragraphing the words into smaller batches.  And numbering them too.  I hope this helps in some way.\nPara 24:__ Shell programming is the fastest, cleanest, and most profound way for most people to program today.  You can compose code in hours that took the developers months or years to build up to the level we've arrived at.  I no longer write compiler code, except in extreme cases.   And the growth in what is possible has accelerated remarkably in recent years.  What you can't do with known utilities is often possible with tools like python or perl, and other areas of specialization.\nPara 25:__ What non-programmers and most programmers have failed to grasp, is that we make reuse of existing code rather than focus on writing our own versions now.  It's like moving from cutting down trees and clearing the ground to build a log cabin, to now just erecting a modular home on ground that has been stripped of its trees.\nPara 26:__ One approach takes time and effort and special skills.  The other just requires finding the right modular home and putting it up.  The do-it-yourself method takes  time, lots of it.  The modular assembly moght come pre-assembled and be put on the foundation by crane.  The difference in coding and reusing code is more dramatic than you can imagine.\nPara 27:__ But to make full use of this capability, you need to move to the terminal and the command line mode.  You can never do it via a GUI interface, as that is really just for looks and to simplify some tasks while masking over options and capabilities.  Not to knock GUI entirely.  The UbuntuGNOME interface is terrific at what it does.\nPara 28:__ Eyestrain.  Looking at a white screen is not like looking at a white sheet of paper.  The screen produces light, and the paper just reflects it.  All that white light is bad for your eyes, and people are suffering severe eye damage as a result.  If you can make the background dark and the text white instead, your eyes will thank you for it.   I like a dark red, dark blue, dark green, or dark purple myself.  And a solid color is less stressful than an image, as the image makes it harder to pick out the text.\nPara 29:__ Web pages are particularly bad at showing white backgrounds.  I'm looking at one myself as I type this.  But I can fix that quick.  Slimjet gives you the option to complement the colors on on individual websites or pages, and that makes almost all whites black, and almost all blacks white.  White on black is not pretty, but a whole lot easier on the eyes.  Other colors look odd when they are bit-flipped like that.  Maybe someday someone will find a better method of keeping the white from dominating the screen as it does now.\n\nA: This did it for me\ngsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features \"['scale-monitor-framebuffer']\"\n\nbut be warned my screen went dead but was OK after a reboot. I also have logged in with the Wayland option. Got this from this wiki.\nAlthough it started to make the windowing system unstable :-/\n", "Q: How to flash Ubuntu-core Snappy on Artik-5 (v 0.5)?

If the answer is \"yes\", so how could I mitigate CVE-2016-3710 in my system? Upgrading to 16.04 release is the only way for me?\n\nA: If support is ending for it, I would suggest compiling qemu yourself. This way as soon as patches are fixed upstream, you can recompile the newly patched versions and not worry about waiting for maintainers. \n\nA: As you can see on this chart: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases , support for Ubuntu 15.04 ended in February 2016. This means none of the packages for 15.04 will receive updates of any kind, including security updates. Current and future security risks will not be patched, so it is highly recommended to switch to a supported version. You are welcome to try to apply security fixes on your own by recompiling software, installing unofficial versions, or backporting packages from newer Ubuntu versions -- it's your system -- but this is completely unsupported and any breakage is at your own risk.\nFor future reference, if you plan on sticking with a specific version of Ubuntu for a long time without upgrading, it's best to stay with LTS, or Long-Term-Support releases, which receive security updates for 5 years from the date of release.

These are stored in Environment variables included in a session when you login, this prevents rogue background processes from messing up your desktop.\nAn easy way to make these session credentials available (and subvert the security of the desktop completely) is to have the desktop session start a screen session and then background it. \nyou can then ssh to it , connect to the screen session and then your notify-send will work. If you do this ensure your flatmate is fully aware that you have total access to her desktop and files.\nTo configure the screen session:\nFrom the dash run 'Startup Applications'\nclick add , give it a name and enter the following in command:\nscreen -dmS desktop_session\n\nThen when you connect via ssh \nscreen -r desktop_session\nnotify-send \"Insecure message\"\n\nYou can then run any command and have its graphical output appear on that desktop session. \nYou will need to do this interactively, if you want to do it non-interactively you could have a shell script poll a file and when it has data send it to notify. or just use an instant message client.\n\nA: I had to do a similar thing - I would run an update on one computer but wanted a notify-send on another computer.

I need to dual boot Windows and Ubuntu, but 256GB is really a small space to partition. Moreover, I have heard that partitioning SSD is not a good choice, tell me if I am wrong. I have read this on askubuntu.com. \nI want to know that, is there a better way to get off with it? Like using some USB 3.0 removeable media/hard drive. How do you do it? I do not want to run out of space after partitioning. I use both ubuntu and windows heavily.\n\nA: SSD is just like HDD , partitioning is not a problem other than it might result in too small disk space. I managed to dual both on a 120GB but then i barely used windows. \nThe linked post suggests its not a great idea to put swap on your SSD, it doesnt' say partitioning is bad. Swap on SSD is fine , makes suspend/hibernate super fast. It might wear it out a little quicker but SSD isn't designed for long term storage anyway and you should have backups.\nUSB 3 is almost the same speed as sata so if your usage is uneven then i'd suggest putting the lesser used OS on the external disk.  \nIt really depends on your workload and how much RAM you have , if you are editing big media files and really need the raw speed then nothing will be better than a full SSD install. Likewise if you have less than 4GB of ram then fast disk is essential as you will be swappign in and out of memory a lot.\nIf you have your OS on the SSD and your Data on the HDD then you will notice when you touch the HD as the system will slow. If its possible to get one system and its working data set on the SSD then it might be the way to go if your really really need performance.\n\nA: I installed ubuntu mint on a USB 3 32GB flash drive, and it works fine.

We should need to acquire the lock only when upgrading/installing the downloaded packages. What do you think? Why can't we download more than one package at the same time?

If another process was installing a package and one was installing one they could end up getting very confused and corrupt the database. for more on this concept google 'database transactions' or 'atomicity'.\nYou can avoid the locks by downloading the packages yourself using the links from /etc/apt/sources.list and browsing them in your web browser. You can then install the debs you have downloaded with gdebi or dpkg. However if you do this you will have to resolve the dependencies yourself which isn't allways easy and is IMHO way more annoying than the locks.\nIf the locks are annoying then consider batching your installs to include multiple packages e.g. apt-get install package1 package2 package3 and go make some tea.\n", "Q: Can't print on Ubuntu 16.04 with Epson L210 Even yesterday I printed with my Epson L210 printer on Ubuntu 16.04 and after shutdown - today - it does not work.

The fact that the answer to the other question does not work for me confirms that the difference between the models is meaningful, and that the answer to this question will be different.\nAs requested in comments, output of xinput is:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ PixArt USB Optical Mouse                  id=9    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Elan Touchpad                             id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ USB2.0 HD UVC WebCam                      id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Asus WMI hotkeys                          id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\n\nA: Upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 and the touchpad should work OK with kernel 4.4.\nThere is no supported way to install kernel 4.4 to Ubuntu 15.10.\nIt can be installed only to 14.04, or 16.04.\n\nA: This problem have been solved in kernel 4.4,\n You can install kernel 4.4 to Ubuntu 14.04 without upgrading to 16.04 by running in terminal\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-xenial\n\nRegarding \"how stable is 4.4.6\", it can't be answered as it will be based on opinions.

I would like to install Ubuntu from a live USB onto another USB, from which I will boot the computer in the future. I created a live USB with a flash drive formatted to FAT32 on a Mac computer using unetbooting. It has 14.04.4 on it. I have unplugged the harddrive and removed the tray from the target computer (Lenovo ideapad u430). \nMy steps:\nUpon inserting the live USB and the empty 16 GB USB (also formatted to FAT32) into the laptop, I am taken to a Ubuntu menu.\nI click the option \"install Ubuntu.\"\nI immediately given the message:\n\n\"error: invalid magic number.\n  alloc magic is broken at 0x94e4a440: 94d69540\n  Aborted. Press any key to exit.\"\n\nThis is all that happens. I have tried this exact process with 16.04 and I get the same results; I am fairly confident that the USB was set up properly in each case. I am very much a newbie and do not know what to try from here. I appreciate any and all help you guys may have to offer.\n\nA: *\n\n*Did you md5sum check the downloaded ISO file?\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\nCheck the number against the listing in the link for your release listed at\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com under the MD5SUMS link.\n\n*If using a CD/DVD, did you burn the disc as slowly as possible?\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\n\n*Did you select the media check before trying to install?\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/CDIntegrityCheck\n\n*Did you ever do a \"memory check\" (perhaps another live-media menu choice) on your PC?  \n\n\nDoing the above can save you a lot of time struggling with a bad install media.\n", "Q: Which port do I need to open so that others can connect to my \"www\" folder? I want to follow this solution, but...\nI specifically want to let others access a site on a LAN that would be stored in the default \"/var/www/html\" system folder AKA 127.0.0.1\nSo I guess I just need to know which port should I use, a guess is port 8080, anyways I want this question to be here @ AskUbuntu for it's usefulness.\n\n\n\nA: You don't want to \"open a port\", you want to setup a web server.\nBy default web server listens at port 80 for HTTP, or the web server opens that port for you. Your site is stored at a folder, you can call it \"www\", but that is not \"AKA\" 127.0.0.1, and if you serve it to other computers, you cannot let your web server listen at 127.0.0.1 only. Furthermore, if the access is restricted to LAN only, security may not be a issue, but keep such security concern in your mind when you setup a server for other to access your files. Please make sure you understand such stuff before continuing.\nYou can start by installing apache2 package, and your web server is up and running (The files are stored at /var/www/html).\nI suggest you Google something like \"ubuntu apache php\" to find tons of guides on this topic, i.e., to install, configure a web server capable of running PHP sites (possibly including a MySQL server), if you encounter some specific problems during this procedure, ask those questions instead.\nTIP: it may be more helpful to add your specific Ubuntu version when Googling, like: \"ubuntu 14.04 LTS apache php\"\n\nA: Just after the user installs apache webserver, the web-server is started as a service. With the start of this service the port 80 (for HTTP traffic) is opened automatically. \nSuggested reading and details about apache / php / MySQL on Ubuntu : ApacheMySQLPHP\nImportant: Apache, php, phpmyadmin and MySQL should be properly configured for a secure working of your website.

Any ideas on how I can proceed from here?\n\nA: I discovered that this is a Ubuntu bug that has been reported as https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/runit/+bug/1448164.\nThe problem exists because runit depends on upstart and Ubuntu changed to using systemd in 15.04. The workaround is as follows:\nsudo apt-get purge runit\nsudo apt-get purge git-all\nsudo apt-get purge git\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git\n\nBasically you completely get rid of runit, git-all and git, cleanup the apt database and then re-install git. Instead of installing git-all again cherry pick the packages that you actually need and install those.\n\nA: Get rid of runit and git-daemon-run. Install git-daemon-sysvinit instead. git-daemon-sysvinit is an alternative for git-daemon-run, and it actually works on Ubuntu 15.04 and up.\nOnce you install git-daemon-sysvinit, the dependencies for git-all should be met, and you can proceed.\n\nA: I had the same problem while trying to install all packages of git on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This is what I did:\nsudo apt-get purge runit\nsudo apt-get purge git-all\nsudo apt-get purge git\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt update \nsudo apt-get install git-daemon-sysvinit\nsudo apt-get install git-all\n\nI wrote this bit of code based on the two posts above by Johnathon and Stephen.It worked for me!\n", "Q: IPv6 Host Discovery?

Would this work if I changed my subnet to include all LANs?\nDo you know any better ways to discover IPv6 hosts?\n\nA: The script uses the ff02::1 multicast address. That is the multicast address for all IPv6 nodes on the local link. So you will need to run it on each LAN. There is no equivalent for multiple LANs.\nYou either have to run this script on each LAN, or you have to use network management tools that get information from the switches and routers in your network.\n", "Q: After routine update on 14.04, cannot even SEE internet (no ethernet, no wifi) I am posting this question from my Windows desktop, because as of this morning my laptop is no longer even an internet accessible device, and doesn't even seem to think it's supposed to be an internet accessible device.\nMy OS is Ubuntu 14.04, 64 bit.

In the apache configuration you can change that port if so desired (for this and some other intro info: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/httpd.html).\nIf you'd like to access it from outside your network, then you can look into how your home router/firewall handles port forwarding.

Is it possible to do this? I don't care what tool, ping, nmap, nslookup. Hell, i'll even write a bash script. I just need to figure this out.\nEdit:\nAll I know are IPv4 addresses and I want to see what their IPv6 addresses are. I realistically cannot scan a whole /32 block of IPv6 and that's terribly inefficient anyways. TL;DR \nIPv4 Input > IPv6 Output\nPseudo-code:\nping 1.2.3.4\nResult:\n1.2.3.4: IPv6 Address\n\nA: There is no direct mapping between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The most reliable way I can think of (which requires you to be on the same network as the IPv4 node) is to get the MAC address for the IP, and construct a link-local EUI-64-based address from it. That is, IPv6 nodes will almost always automatically configure a MAC-based link-local address, so this should work in most cases.\nThe following quick-and-dirty example script works on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) as long as the python3-netaddr package is installed. It doesn't seem to work on Trusty (14.04) since the netaddr library is missing some of the required functionality.\n#!/bin/bash -e\n\nIP=$1\nping -c 1 $1 > /dev/null 2> /dev/null\nMAC=$(arp -an $1 | awk '{ print $4 }')\nIFACE=$(arp -an $1 | awk '{ print $7 }')\n\npython3 -c \"\nfrom netaddr import IPAddress\nfrom netaddr.eui import EUI\nmac = EUI(\\\"$MAC\\\")\nip = mac.ipv6(IPAddress('fe80::'))\nprint('{ip}%{iface}'.format(ip=ip, iface=\\\"$IFACE\\\"))\"\n\nExample usage (assuming you pasted the contents into ipv4-to-ipv6.sh and did a chmod +x ipv4-to-ipv6.sh):\n./ipv4-to-ipv6.sh 192.168.0.1\nfe80::224:b4ff:fe9c:1329%eth0\n\nNote that this is a link-local address must be scoped to a particular link in order to be useful, so requires the %<interface> to be usable in most application. If your hosts have a global unicast prefix on this network as well, they would be probably be reachable using the MAC-based address there, too. (you could, for example, change the ip = mac.ipv6(...) line to use your global prefix, and that should work.)\n", "Q: PCIe Bus error severity=Corrected I have a new HP Pavilion Gaming Notebook and a new installation of Ubuntu 16.04.

It's always about pooling entire discs.\nUntil some future Ubuntu release provides a native-install option for ZFS, it would be enough that I could merely mirror partitions for greater data integrity for irreplaceable contents which matter most to me -- without facing what appears to be a fairly complex hat dance to manually install the entire root system on ZFS.\nThat would also take me to a level of bleeding-edginess which I tend to avoid since I'm more a business user than a geek. Which is to say I use technology but don't adore it.\nCan anyone point to some reference out there on this subject which I've not yet found?

Here are some screen-shots.\n\n\nI am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit. Android Studio is set to use the GTK Themes. I have also added the following options to andriod-studio/bin/studio64.vmoptions and android-studio/bin/studio64.vmoptions as described in this post on Super User.\n-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on\n-Dswing.aatext=true\n-Dsun.java2d.xrender=true\n\nApart from the GTK theme settings in Android-Studio > Settings > Appearance, nothing else is done.\nI am also not really happy with the overall fonts settings on my machine.

It might help\nAppearance and Behaviour > Appearance > Antialiasing\n\n\nA: In the bundled JRE, there's a font configuration file which seems to default to full hinting.\nTo change this, open jre/lib/fonts/font.conf and locate the following part:\n<edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"hintstyle\">\n  <const>hintfull</const>\n</edit>\n\nThere, replace hintfull with a different hintstyle, e.g. hintslight which is usually the default for other UIs in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Quick fix for me: delete the jre directory in your AndroidStudio directory. It will now use your java set with JAVA_HOME. Make sure you have one.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 freeze/crash I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04. 14.04 was rock stable for more than a year that I used it. This should rule out most hardware issues. The only difference is that in 16.04 I'm using Nouveau drivers for the Intel HD Graphics that came with i7-6700 CPU. The computer randomly freezes and the only way to recover is to reboot. I have looked at syslog and kern.log but nothing obvious there. How do I troubleshoot this?\nGoing back to Nvidia GTX 970M is difficult as there are other issues there.\n\nA: I tried disabling hardware acceleration in Google Chrome but that didn't help. And the system was freezing every few minutes/hours. So I went back to using Nvidia proprietary driver ( nvidia-364..which is the latest as of today). The computer no longer freezes. So I'm guessing either the Intel HD Graphics hardware is bad on my motherboard or there is a bug in Ubuntu support for Intel HD graphics. \nThese are the reasons I tried to move to Intel HD Graphics:\n\n\n*\n\n*My second UHD monitor was not being detected after login. In nvidia settings it showed up as disabled. Enabling the monitor in nvidia-settings-manager would not persist after a reboot. I deleted my ~/.config/monitors.xml file and also used the Ubuntu Displays utility to switch the monitor on. The displays utility asked me if I wanted to keep this configuration and I said Yes. This seems to have fixed the problem.\n\n*The other problem was that monitors were not waking up from sleep. I had to reboot the system everytime monitors went to sleep or remember to manually switch off the monitors everytime I stepped away. This is not a problem with the Intel HD Graphics so I'm guessing there is a bug in the Nvidia Proprietary drivers. For now I have disabled sleep on the monitors and hopefully will remember to switch them off manually whenever I need to.\nHope all this helps someone.\n\nA: I had the same problem following a long and fond relationship with Ubuntu 14.04.\nI'm using Nvidia 650 hardware and 16.04 has not frozen again since I installed the Nvidia-367 drivers and rebooted:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt-get nvidia-367\n\n", "Q: problems with sudoers if I run sudo visudo I get this page:\n\nHow can I fix?\n\nA: I solved removing the file with the command:\nsudo rm /etc/.sudoers.tmp.swp \n\nnow, sudo visudo works fine.\n", "Q: permission error when installing ttf-mscorefonts-installer/Can't drop privileges as file couldn't be accessed by user '_apt' I wanted to install the Microsoft fonts on 16.04 and ran the command below, but there are many errors (or only warnings?) about that the user _apt has no permissions on the downloaded .exe files.\nCommand:\nsudo apt install ttf-mscorefont-installer\n\nError message (repeated for every downloaded font exe):\nttf-mscorefonts-installer: downloading http://downloads.sourceforge.net/corefonts/andale32.exe\nGet:1 http://downloads.sourceforge.net/corefonts/andale32.exe [198 kB]\nFetched 198 kB in 1s (180 kB/s)                                                              \nW: Can't drop privileges for downloading as file '/var/lib/update-notifier/package-data-downloads/partial/andale32.exe' couldn't be accessed by user '_apt'. - pkgAcquire::Run (13: Permission denied)\n\nBut in the end it still says that the installation was successful.

As a consequence, the installation will not be able to extract font files to - in turn - update (or install for the first time), the indicated fonts.\nI contend that the package is therefore NOT properly installed, unlike the currently accepted answer (https://askubuntu.com/a/812152/269638).\nWhat should you do?\nFirst, you'll want to verify that you have an _apt user as suggested here with the following command:\ngetent passwd _apt\n\nIf for some reason you do not have the _apt user and need instructions for installing it, please go to the link indicated above.\nNext, you will want to assign the directory indicated, as well as all files and subdirectories contained within, to the _apt user.  You'll want to retain the privileges associated with root superuser group and consequently the root user account. Following the reassignment of ownership of the directory, we should perform some directory clean-up and then finally ensure that the packages and their dependencies are properly installed.\nThe commands you need...\n...after verifying that the _apt user does indeed exist:\nsudo chown -R _apt:root /var/lib/update-notifier/package-data-downloads/partial/\nsudo rm /var/lib/update-notifier/package-data-downloads/partial/*.FA‌​ILED\nsudo apt install --reinstall update-notifier-common ttf-mscorefonts-installer \n\n\nA: This is the bug #1543280, though a rather harmless bug.

The clients need to use that file (rather than the default, which is ~/.Xauthority). This can be done by setting the XAUTHORITY environment variable:\nDISPLAY=:99 XAUTHORITY=/tmp/xvfb-run.XXXXXX/Xauthority xdpyinfo\n\nHere XXXXXX should be replaced to match the actual path. The path can be discovered by printing the arguments of the Xvfb process using pgrep -ax Xvfb and inspecting the value of the -auth option. Alternatively, xvfb-run has an option --auth-file that can be used to set the location of the Xauthority file (a warning will be printed if the file doesn't exist; you can ignore the warning, or create an empty file at that location beforehand).\n\nAn interesting observation that @TomSchober made in the question is that if you manually invoke the Xvfb command used by xvfb-run (that is, with the -auth option), it may be possible for clients to connect even if XAUTHORITY is not set. This is because xvfb-run  adds an authorization entry to the Xauthority file before it runs Xvfb. If this entry is not added, and the file is empty/missing, Xvfb will allow clients to connect without requiring authorization (!). Xvfb only requires authorization if there is at least one entry in the Xauthority file. An authorization entry can be added manually using the following command:\nXAUTHORITY=/path/to/Xauthority xauth source - <<EOF\nadd :99 . $(mcookie)\nEOF\n\n", "Q: Logitech Mouse Appearing Incorrectly \n[~  dave@daveX1 ]$ xinput                                                                                                                                rvm: \n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint                     id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech G500                             id=14   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech G500                             id=15   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\n\nxinput reveals that there are two mice.

But when I plug it into my Ubuntu laptop, it defaulted to a weird profile that I made for gaming.\nI deleted that profile, and now my mouse works.  \n", "Q: Enable [Fn]+[cursor arrows] on lock/login screen to change volume and brightness Having a new Acer Aspire E17 E5-773G with Ubuntu 16.04 on it, I experience that the keyboard combinations to adjust volume (Fn + ↑/↓) and brightness (Fn + ←/→) do not work on the login screen or lock screen. \nThey do work when logged in though, so it's not a general problem. What do I have to do to be able to use them from the login and lock screen as well?\n\nA: I had the same problem and kernel parameters did not work for me. I wanted the keys to behave more like direct hardware buttons, so they worked regardless of login status, and also on tty screens. I got most of the solution via a third party site linked from this question, the various answers and comments on this question, and the Arch Wiki. In summary, this listens to ACPI events with a system service, and sets the brightness directly.\nInstall the acpid package:\napt install acpid\n\nCreate /etc/acpi/events/brightness:\nevent=video/brightness(up|down)\naction=/etc/acpi/brightness.sh %e\n\nand /etc/acpi/brightness.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\n# edit this to match your device under /sys/class/backlight/\ndev=amdgpu_bl0\n# change if you want a different number of brightness levels\nlevels=16\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    video/brightnessup)\n        chg=1\n        ;;\n    video/brightnessdown)\n        chg=-1\n        ;;\n    *)\n        exit 1\n        ;;\nesac\n\ndev=\"/sys/class/backlight/$dev\"\n[[ -e \"$dev\" ]]\nbri=\"$dev/brightness\"\nread -r cur < \"$bri\"\nread -r max < \"$dev/max_brightness\"\nmax_levels=$(( max + 1 ))\nif (( levels < 1 )); then\n    levels=1\nelif (( levels > max_levels )); then\n    levels=$max_levels\nfi\nincr=$(( max_levels / levels ))\nnew=$(( cur + ( incr * chg ) ))\nif (( new > max )); then\n    new=$max\nelif (( new < 0 )); then\n    new=0\nfi\nif (( new != cur )); then\n    echo $new > \"$bri\"\nfi\n\nand make it executable:\nchmod +x /etc/acpi/brightness.sh\n\nRestart and enable the service:\nsystemctl restart acpid && systemctl enable acpid\n\nThe final piece is to stop the double binding of the keys. In KDE Plasma, you can just disable the default bindings in System Settings > Shortcuts > Power Management > Decrease/Increase Screen Brightness. I assume other DEs have similar ability to ignore those keys.\n\nA: In the terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nChange\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=\"\n\nSave, then\nsudo update-grub\n\nRestart computer.\n", "Q: Keyboard lockup when typing  and random characters I am running Ubuntu 14.04 with a terminal window.  Because I type fairly quickly I sometimes use ctrl-u to wipe out my partially entered line which works great.  Once my partially typed line is wiped out, I am back at my command prompt and am ready to enter a command.\nBut sometimes I accidently press ctrl-shift-u and then immediately start typing (thinking I am at the command prompt again).  Instead of wiping out the line, the characters I type are underlined and sometimes get converted into hex characters, or sometimes if I type too many characters when it is in this mode, my keyboard completely locks up.  Even if I open an new terminal window I still can't type.  The only solution is a reboot.\nWhat am I activating when I type ctrl-shift-u followed by other characters?  And is there a way for me to configure this feature off so I don't lock myself up?\n(Perhaps I should type more carefully so I don't accidently hit ctrl-shift)\nThanks for your help,\nRobert\n\nA: I just found out that IBus was activating, and it substitutes Unicode characters.  I guess pressing more than 4 characters locks up keyboard input.\nI found out how to disable IBus completely.  I went to the Ubuntu system settings, selected Language Support.  Under Keyboard input method system I changed IBus to none, and my ctrl-Shift-U lockup problems are now gone.\nThank you Adonis for directing me to the solution. \n", "Q: Block internet if vpn connection drops Trying to set up gufw so that it if my vpn connection drops, my computer won't be able to access the internet any more.\nMy plan was to block all outgoing, but allow only a connection to the IP of my vpn server, but I find when the firewall is implemented I can't load sites even if the vpn is connected.\n\nAbove are the settings I am currently trying (partially hidden IP is my vpn server), what am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Try something like this\nYou wish to change ufw rules based on interface status.\nNice place for this kind of action is in /etc/network/if-down.d/ and /etc/network/if-up.d/\nYou can in this folder put some script and make action.

Second script will change default outgoing police to allow\n\nA: You can do that just by using the ufw GUI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure ufw to globally deny outgoing traffic (just like you did)\n\n*Add the following two rules, given that eth0 is your public interface, tun0 is the interface created by the VPN and xxx.xxx.68.138 is your VPN IP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow to connect to the VPN IP through the public interface: add a rule with Policy=Allow, Direction=Out, Interface=eth0 and To=xxx.xxx.68.138\n\n*Allow everything through the VPN interface: add a rule with Policy=Allow, Direction=Out, Interface=tun0 and To=0.0.0.0/0\nThat's all!\nYou almost did it, you just forgotten to allow outgoing traffic through the VPN, because globally denying outgoing traffic applies on all interfaces, including the one created by the VPN.\nBy the way, I suggest you to globally deny incoming traffic, this will prevent an evil person or a bot running on your network to hack into your computer by exploiting a bug or a misconfiguration of a running network service (by default, Ubuntu runs some network services listening on all interfaces, not only the local).\n", "Q: Ubuntu boots to command line after kernel error I was attempting to install Windows 7 in Virtual Box with Ubuntu 14.04 as the host OS.\nWhile so doing, a kernel error message came up.\nSuddenly, the terminal and software center were gone.

When I connect my Dell Ultrasharp U2713HM to the DisplayPort on my Lenovo Dock, and it displays the image fine in the correct resolution (2560 x 1440). \nBut there're some serious problems:\n(1) It shows an obvious lag or lower framerate, perhaps like 20Hz, when I move the cursor around. This is independent of resolution (also goes for HD and 1024 x 768). When I run xrandr the relevant lines read:\nDP-1 connected primary 2560x1440+0+0 597mm x 336mm\n    2560x1440     59.95*+\n\n(2) Perhaps connected to (1), the cursor leaves some \"pixels\" behind as if the graphics card \"forgets\" to update the image. These disappear when I try to take a screenshot or whenever that part of the display changes in any way.\n(3) There's no option for rotating the display. The Display GUI dialogue only has \"normal\". I usually work in portrait mode (rotated counterclockwise) so this is annoying. Using xrandr fails as well:\n$ xrandr --output \"DP-1\" --rotate left\nxrandr: output DP-1 cannot use rotation \"left\" reflection \"none\"\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing between nouveau and Nvidia drivers, rebooting after each change. No difference in lag, mouse trail, or rotation. So this is not obviously a driver problem.\n\n*Installing the newer nividia-364 driver from a ppa. It broke the login screen, which just kept playing the drumroll over and over. I had to boot into console (failsafeX failed...) and uninstall.\nSome relevant observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Ubuntu Display dialogue, pressing the monitor illustrations caused a significant lag, perhaps 20 seconds before the dialogue became responsive again during which the fan began rushing, indicating heavy processing.\n\n*Relevant lines from lspci:\n.\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM107GLM [Quadro M2000M] (rev a2)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Skylake Integrated Graphics (rev 06)\n\n\nA: Following this guide solved the problem. I did all of it: updated GRUB settings, BIOS settings, and the kernel. I haven't tested whether all of these are necessary but at least the full package did the trick for me.\nIt works on the P50's mini-DisplayPort. However, when my external monitor is connected to either of the Lenovo Dock's Displayports, it simply doesn't detect the external monitor in the Ubuntu's Displays dialogue or xrandr.\nI'm using nvidia-361.\n", "Q: Touchpad not working on toshiba p50 I have a toshiba P50 notebook and touchpad stopped working in my Xubuntu 15.10.

Well, that sometimes happens with Evolution – so I simply called killev, also took care all its sub-processes were terminated, and restarted it. Same thing still: As soon as I want to switch to contacts, Evolution freezes – and killev reports No response from Evolution -- killing the process.\nNow I thought this might be due to several library and kernel updates without reboot, there might be some mismatch – and the \"Windows repair method\" would fix it. Having finished the other open tasks, today I finally rebooted the machine. To my surprise, this did not fix the issue – behaviour is still the same: as soon as I try to access contacts, Evolution freezes.\nSystem: Ubuntu 12.04 (and no, updating to 14.04 or 16.04 is not an option for this machine)\nEvolution: 3.4.2-1ubuntu3.1~stracciatellappa+precise1 (same version for -common, dataserver and plugins); evolution-webcal: 2.32.0-2ubuntu2.1~stracciatellappa+precise1; evolution-indicator: 0.2.20-0ubuntu7\nIn my ~/.xsession-errors I see a couple of warnings related to Evolution:\n(evolution:4096): LIBDBUSMENU-GLIB-WARNING **: Trying to remove a child that doesn't believe we're it's parent.\n(evolution:4096): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: cannot register existing type `EABContactDisplay'\n\n\nA: Pushing the \"Submit\" button on my question, I just wondered about another application: About the time this issue started, I've installed syncevolution to get my ownCloud contacts/calendars synced (the build-in WebDAV sync in Evolution is a bit itchy). Never found the time to configure it, though – so just to be on the save side, I ran an apt-get remove --purge on its 4 packages (syncevolution*). Should have thought about that earlier: issue solved!\nObviously there are conflicts between those packages (syncevolution 1.2.2-1 and above mentioned Evolution packages), so removing syncevolution resolves the conflict.\n", "Q: Flash plugin for Firefox on Ubuntu 16.04 The flash player plugin has stopped working in Firefox on Ubuntu 16.04 .I cant find pepper flash for chromium either ,certain music sites require flash so are now not use-able.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash\n\nThis command got flash working in Firefox for me.\n\nA: Go to Official Adobe flash website, then download the  install_flash_player_11_linux.x86_64.tar.gz and extract the tarball using:\ntar -zxvf install_flash_player_11_linux.x86_64.tar.gz\n\nYou got the libflashplayer.so.

First of all I am using a brandnew Chromebook Acer R11 and used this guide to install Ubuntu next to Chrome OS:\nhttp://chromebookblog.de/ubuntu-auf-dem-chromebook-installieren/\nIt was very easy to install Ubuntu with Unity and to boot Ubuntu for the very first time but at that point, the problems started. \n1: There were no apps and programms preinstalled. No AppCenter, nothing. \n2: A few shortcuts do not work. For example I have to log out on Ubuntu to come back to the Chrome OS because the shortcuts for switching from Ubuntu to Chrome OS and backwards do not work. \n3: There is no way to start the bash shell and this is of course the main struggle and problem. The standard shortcuts for starting the bash do not work. I tried to change the shortcut or find some link or icon to start the bash but no effect. I then tried to start the shell manually over bin/bash.cpp but no effect. No shell opened up. \nI think something went really wrong. Is there any way to fix this problems? Unfortunatly I did not find any similar problems here or at stack overflow. Is there a better guide, would it be the best to start the process again, or is there still hope to fix everything?\nThank you for your time and help.

The first 2 are preferred.\n\n\n*\n\n*Update Chroot Using Crouton\nReferencing this great little cheat sheet, you can just run the following:\nsudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -u -n <chrootname> [-t <new targets>]\nThis will check for updates to the chroot and apply them, optionally with new targets.\nTo see what targets you might need, run sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t <help | list>.\n\n\n\n*Update Internally Using startcli\n\nIf you installed cli-extra, startcli will launch a new VT right into the chroot.\n\nThat's from the crouton \"homepage\" (GitHub).\nEssentially, it opens something like xterm in the background without X, and shows you the output (and accepts your input) through crosh. It also states that you may need to install the cli-extra target (see method 1)\nUsing startcli, you can run all of the updates you need - apt update, apt upgrade, etc.\nYou can even upgrade your Ubuntu release from in your chroot! (in your case, this may fix stuff, or completely break things, depending what you upgrade from and to, and how your chroot is configured.)\n\n\n\n*Start Over\nYep. I said it.\nDo your best to back up anything you managed to do in your chroot, and use sudo delete-chroot <chroot name>.

Is it possible to install the pantheon desktop environment on Ubuntu 16.04?\nFor many previous versions, it was only possibly by adding the unstable PPA, and installing from there, as explained here.\nIs this still the case or is there a stable build available?\nI haven't tried since I don't want to break my system...\n\nA: I have installed the pantheon desktop on Ubuntu 16.04.

I was afk for about two hours and when I came back there simply was no sound. Restarted my system several times. When using speaker-test on my headphones I get the following error: Playback open error: -16,Device or resource busy I asked google and tried some guides but couldn't find any solution. My sound is definitely not muted in the alsamixer\n\nA: I facing a problem is, when playing video in the half way. Suddenly turn off my volume, but after i check it all is not mute.\nI try to go into alsamixer and disable the \"Auto-mute\" function. Now so far is all work fine for me! ^_^\n\nA: If you tried all of the other options available, try restarting the desktop manager(thereby the login session, user-settings, etc). In my case, I did alsa force-load, killall pulseaudio, removed pulseaudio config files, etc, selected proper soundcard, etc - didn't fix. I didn't want reboot just to get sound back. So, I knew restarting lightdm(desktop manager in my case) would work as in many other cases. So, below is the command I ran, logged in and volia, the sound is back!\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\n\nA: In order to fix this I had to go into the alsamixer and switch the analog output from \"Stereo Headphones FP\" to \"Stereo Headphones\".\n\nA: I had the same problem, and I didn't find a permanent solution in this purpose except than a temporary solution which solves my no sound problem through restarting the pulseaudio/ALSA services:\npulseaudio -k && sudo alsa force-reload\n\n", "Q: I have a cluster of computers, how do I setup ntpd so they all have nearly the same clock? I have 4 computers, one is considered the master (direct connection to the Internet) and the others are considered slaves (for those the master adds one extra hop to any external communication.)\nAt this time, all computers are setup to have time synchronized through external time servers (a.k.a. 0.north-america.pool.ntp.org). Is that the way you would do it too?\nI am wondering whether setting up the ntpd of each slave to accept clock adjustments from the master instead of external sources could be better?\n\nA: Typically, you'd set an ntp server up on a single machine on your network, possibly your router or gateway.  That machine would call out to ntp servers over the Internet and make sure its time is accurate.  You will want to provide a few ntp servers in your region.  It will also provide time information to your LAN.  There are many tutorials on how to get this done properly for a LAN-only setup.\nThe other machines on your LAN would then make ntp requests to the ntp server on your LAN.  Your LAN ntp server will be the only machine they would query.\nThis would be the best method of making sure the machines on your LAN have near-matching times, as well as ensuring the LAN doesn't get get out of sync with the rest of the world.\n", "Q: Applications can't connect the X server to launch I can install and run CLI snap applications without issues, but when trying to run graphical apps it seems they can't connect to the X server, what am I doing wrong?\nkeepassx: cannot connect to X server :0\n\nAnd for telegram:\nQXcbConnection: Could not connect to display :0\n\nI am using snapd version 2.0.3 and snap interfaces gives me this:\nSlot  Plug\n-     keepassx-elopio:opengl\n-     keepassx-elopio:unity7\n-     links:network\n-     links:network-bind\n-     nmap:network\n-     nmap:network-bind\n-     notes:opengl\n-     notes:unity7\n-     notes-dpm:home\n-     notes-dpm:opengl\n-     notes-dpm:unity7\n-     telegram-sergiusens:network\n-     telegram-sergiusens:network-bind\n-     telegram-sergiusens:unity7\n-     tmux:network\n-     tmux:network-bind\n-     ubuntu-calculator-app:opengl\n-     ubuntu-calculator-app:unity7\n-     ubuntu-clock-app:opengl\n-     ubuntu-clock-app:unity7\n-     youtube-dl:home\n-     youtube-dl:network\n-     youtube-dl:network-bind\n\n\nA: The fact that the \"Slot\" column of snap interfaces is empty is telling: it means you have no snaps providing those interfaces, and you have several wanting to consume them. I'm guessing snap list doesn't include the ubuntu-core snap, correct? The fix may be as simple as snap install ubuntu-core. How you got there, I have no idea.\nIf that doesn't work your snap installation may have become very messed up somehow. I've found this script helps to get back to a working point, but only by cleaning it completely.\n", "Q: Reset the password in Ubuntu / Linux Bash in Windows I have installed Linux Bash on Windows 10 (available from Microsoft), but I've forgotten my password.\nI've searched for a solution but I only find suggestions that involve doing something before the system boots, like accessing recovery mode, but that will not work in this case as this Ubuntu is just an application within a Windows system and doesn't have its own boot process.\nHow can I reset my password?\n\nA: Important This answer is (a) for the older WSL1 only, (b) is outdated as it references paths that are no longer used by WSL1, even, and (c) most importantly, can cause filesystem corruption, per Microsoft.  Please refer to other answers here for proper methods of changing the password.\nThe above did not work. Even after changing default user, Bash always opened with my user.\nSo instead I did this, which worked:\n\n*\n\n*Edit this file (in notepad or notepad++):\n %localappdata%\\lxss\\rootfs\\etc\\shadow\n\n\n\n*Find your normal user, for example:\n user1:$jsdjksadgfhsdf.saflsdf.sadf.safd:17299:0:99999:7:::\n\nand simply remove the hash part (below part)\n    $jsdjksadgfhsdf.saflsdf.sadf.safd\n\nyou will see a different hash - I hope :) so it should look like:\n    user1::17299:0:99999:7:::\n\n\n\n*Save the file\n\n\n*Start Bash again with root privileges and set your password\n  sudo bash\n  passwd <your-user-name> \n\nYou can now set a new password without having to enter the previous one.\n\nA: I needed to reset my password also in my Windows 10, I has WLS 1 \n1- Check your linux/ubuntu name, listing the folder: \n%userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\n\nIn my case I found Ubuntu1604.exe, so I will use ubuntu1604 like name for the next step.\n\n2- Open CMD with administrator privilegies and run (you will get nothing in return):\nubuntu1604 config --default-user root\n\n3- Start your WSL, check that you get root privilegues or run whoami (you need to be root) and change your password with:\npasswd [your-linux-username]\n\n4- Close your WSL and get back to the CMD Window and set back your default linux username:\nubuntu1604 config --default-user [your-linux-username]\n\n5- Start your WSL/Ubuntu/AnotherLinux again, check and enjoy.\n\nA: *\n\n*Run bash and make a note of your Linux username (this need not match your Windows username), see How can I find out my user name?\n\n*Close Bash on Ubuntu if it is running (or the next command will fail).\n\n*In Windows admin command prompt (Super+X, A) change the default user to root:\nubuntu config --default-user root\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu 18.04 in WSL, the command has changed to ubuntu1804 , so \nubuntu1804 config --default-user root\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now Bash on Ubuntu on Windows logs you in as root without asking password\n\n*Use passwd command in Bash to change the user password (the user whose password you want to reset):\npasswd your_username\n\n\n*Change the default user back to your normal user in Windows command prompt\nubuntu config --default-user  your_username\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu 18.04 in WSL, the command has changed to ubuntu1804 , so \nubuntu1804 config --default-user your_username\n\nWatch Full Video to Recover your password Windows Subsystem Linux\nhttps://youtu.be/dTR232yvDCE \nNote 1: The subsystem used in the video is not Ubuntu, but Kali    Linux. Hence the difference in the command. \nNote 2: If you are still    using the original Ubuntu subsystem that came with the Anniversary Update, use the command lxrun. Upgrade to the subsystem version distributed via Microsoft Store is recommended.)\n\nA: Edit This no longer works if you have a store-installed distribution of WSL.\nTo add to Tmu's answer, here's a Powershell script (gist) that automates the process (including automatically detecting the current default username)\n# Resets the password for the default LXSS / WSL bash user\n$lxssUsername = (Get-ItemProperty HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Lxss).DefaultUsername\nlxrun /setdefaultuser root\nbash -c \"passwd $lxssUsername\"\nlxrun /setdefaultuser $lxssUsername\n\n\nA: Microsoft has a good help page on this: WSL User documentation.\nIn Windows PowerShell (Super+X, i) you can log in to the Ubuntu root account with\nwsl --user root\n\nThen change the password as you usually would, i.e. for the current user (which is root) with\npasswd\n\nor for another user with\npasswd username\n\nwhich interactively asks you for a new password (twice). Windows admin privileges are not required.\nIf you have more than one distribution installed in WSL, then you can list the names of the installed distributions with\nwsl -l\n\nand then use the name of the distribution to specify into which distribution you want to log in to, for example to log into Ubuntu 20.04:\nwsl -d Ubuntu-20.04 --user root\n\n\nA: The other answers here, while mostly valid, are vastly overcomplicated.  To change your user password in any WSL distribution, simply:\nFrom inside Ubuntu (or another distribution):\nwsl.exe \\~ -u root -d $WSL_DISTRO_NAME -e passwd $USER\n\n*Requires WSL Interop to be enabled.\nOr from PowerShell or CMD (as a regular, non-admin user):\nwsl ~ -u root -e passwd <username>\n# Add the -d <distro_name> if not using the default distro\n\n*Does not require WSL Interop.\n\nA: For those of you who lost the root password, what worked for me, was updating to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS via the Windows Store. Note, the windows store has two distinct options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Pick this one)\n\n\nTo check your current version, run the following as any user:\nAt command prompt, enter:\ncat /etc/*release\n\nYou should see a line in the output that says:\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=16.01\n\nIf you see that, then definitely update to 18.04, and it will prompt you to create new UNIX credentials.  \n", "Q: variable expansion in single quote I have have string in single quotes. Inside which I want to insert a variable and expand it. I know in bash variable expansion works with double quotes only. But I'm still not able to make it work.\ne.g.:\nTOOLS_DIR=\"/tools\"\necho '#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE \"${TOOLS_DIR}/etc/vimrc\"' >> src/feature.h\n\nThe result I get is like this:\n#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE \"${TOOLS_DIR}/etc/vimrc\"\n\nAnd, the expected output is:\n#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE \"/tools/etc/vimrc\"\n\nHow can I solve this issue?\n\nA: Your double quotes are technically still inside single quotes so no expansion can happen. You can close the single quotes before starting the double quotes and do the reverse at the end of that inner section to achieve what you want:\nTOOLS_DIR=\"/tools\"\necho '#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE \"'\"$TOOLS_DIR\"'\"/etc/vimrc' >> src/feature.h\n\nAlternatively:\nTOOLS_DIR=\"/tools\"\nprintf '#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE \"%s\"/etc/vimrc\\n' \"$TOOLS_DIR\" >> src/feature.h\n\n\nA: Your variable won't expand because you have the string delimited with '\ntry a heredoc\nTOOLS_DIR=\"/tools\"\ncat <<- EOF >> src/feature.h\n    #define SYS_VIMRC_FILE \"${TOOLS_DIR}/etc/vimrc\" \nEOF\n\nor you could change to \" and escape the inner \"'s\nTOOLS_DIR=\"/tools\"\necho \"#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE \\\"${TOOLS_DIR}/etc/vimrc\\\"\" >> src/feature.h\n\n", "Q: Python 3 AppIndicator3: What is the dependency? I'm packaging an app I wrote in Python 3 which uses:\nfrom gi.repository import AppIndicator3\n\nAs I'm listing the dependencies, I have been unable to determine what package contains AppIndicator3. I guessed python-appindicator, but looking at that package it appears that it's for Python 2, not Python 3.\nWhich package should I depend on?\n\nA: You're importing from gi.repository. The file for this module is:\n$ python3 -c 'import gi.repository, sys; print (sys.modules[\"gi.repository\"].__file__)'\n/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gi/repository/__init__.py\n\nAnd that file comes from:\n$ dpkg -S $(python3 -c 'import gi.repository, sys; print (sys.modules[\"gi.repository\"].__file__)')\npython3-gi: /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gi/repository/__init__.py\n\nSo, the package you need (at least on 14.04) is python3-gi.\n\nA: I followed the procedure described in muru's answer on Ubuntu 18.04 with GNOME desktop, and got precisely the same output as muru reports for Ubuntu 14.04:\npython3-gi: /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gi/repository/__init__.py  \n\nHowever, in order to run a script containing the line \nfrom gi.repository import AppIndicator3\n\nI had to install not only python3-gi but also libappindicator3-dev:\nsudo apt install libappindicator3-dev\n\n\nA: For my own indicators, I use  gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 as dependency. If I recall correctly libappindicator3-dev is for development.  Either one works in my experience.\n\nA: just open a terminal Ctrl+Alt+T and type\nsudo apt-get install gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 \nNo need to install full development package.\nTested on ubuntu 20.04.  \nHow I arrived at this?\nI tried sudo apt install libappindicator3-dev and pressed 'n' (not to install).

I currently can't take screen shots because I am right in the middle of the upgrading the distribution and my screenshot tool is broken.  For some reason the installer froze and came up with the following message while installing the upgrades:\n\"Package Configuration\nConfiguring postgresql - common\nObsolete Major Version 9.4\nThe PostgreSQL version 9.4 is obsolete, but the server or client packages are installed.

Same zipped files require extensive terminal usage just to attempt to install and mistakes can be easily made.  I have \"Alien\" installed.  For example, Mozilla, when it releases a new version, does not generate a \"deb\" version. Instead, it is \"zipped\" and requires a lengthy terminal install.  So, can I use Alien to convert the zipped file/app to \"deb\"?\n\nA: the installation will fail if you just convert the package to deb...\nit's not so hard. you download it, extract it and inside that folder you open a terminal and do what we all do: \n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nIt's only 3 commands.\nAs for firefox , there is a ppa that does your life easier.\nIf you still want to go for the manual procedure and do it yourself , then you must understand \"how to\".\nAll apps executables go to /usr/bin , the /opt folder is just a folder to remember where the manually installed apps are. For example you could just install an app on desktop and link the executable there. \nSo in other words you move the app in /opt and the executable in /usr/bin and link it to the app. It's simple already and can't be simpler.\n\nA: $ sudo apt install alien\n$ alien packagename.tar.gz whatyouwantthedebnametobe.deb\n\nExample:\n$ alien ige.tar.gz ige.deb\n\nThen you can install gdebi:\n$ sudo apt install gdebi\n\nThen right-click the .deb package and open with gdebi and click Install in the gdebi installer.\nThere you go.\nThen you can open it in your apps.\n", "Q: f.lux setup.py on xubuntu 16.04 results in error Took the zip from here and unzipped it: https://github.com/xflux-gui/xflux-gui but when i run setup.py\n$ sudo ./setup.py install \n\nResults in the following\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"setup.py\", line 12, in <module>\n    rename(\"xflux64\", \"xflux\")\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n\n\nA: cd xflux-gui && cp xflux xflux64\n\nThe previous answer is the wrong way round as there is no flux64 file to copy.\n\nA: Open a terminal window ands type:   \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nathan-renniewaldock/flux\n\nPress Enter, then type:  \nsudo apt-get update\n\nPress Enter, then type:  \nsudo apt-get install fluxgui\n\nPress Enter.  \nThat's all.

I am looking for an alternative to Psensor. I am running 16.04 LTS on my mid-2010 MacBook Pro and am wanting to monitor temperature and such. I have been using Psensor, and after seeing my CPU regularly sitting at the 90-100+ C range I fired up HTOP to see why my CPU was getting used so much. Looks like it was usr/lib/xorg/Xorg -core....... that was running consistantly at ~50% CPU and then Psensor was around 20%. I think xorg is the GFX driver used for my nvidia card? \nAnyways, as it turns out when I shut down Psensor and kill its tasks everything goes back to where it should be and the xorg process might take a tenth of a percent every couple secs.

Or just use something different that isn't such a resource hog. What are my options?\n\nA: Psensors is a graphical front end to lm-sensors.

Later I closed the Nautilus window.\nNow I try to press the button on the cd tray to insert a second cd into the tray, but the tray doesn't open. I also try the command line, and there seem to be some problem:\n$ eject\n$ eject -T\neject: CD-ROM tray close command failed: Input/output error\n$ eject -t\neject: CD-ROM tray close command failed: Input/output error\n\nHow can I solve the problem? \nThanks\n\nUpdate:\nI used a paper clip to open the cd tray, and insert the second cd in, but after a minute, it begins to try to read the cd by making sound and flashing the light, but the cd still isn't mounted. \nI guess it might not (just) be a hardware problem? Can the driver module for the cd tray be the problem? How can I test that, and make the driver module work?\n\nI am following Discs in DVD Drive not being read. Here is the output of lshw for the cd tray/drive:\n  *-cdrom\n       description: DVD-RAM writer\n       product: DVDRAM GSA-U20N\n       vendor: HL-DT-ST\n       physical id: 0.0.0\n       bus info: scsi@1:0.0.0\n       logical name: /dev/cdrom\n       logical name: /dev/sr0\n       version: HX12\n       capabilities: removable audio cd-r cd-rw dvd dvd-r dvd-ram\n       configuration: ansiversion=5 status=open\n\nI fail to mount the cd manually:\n$ sudo mkdir /media/t/cdrom\n$ sudo mount -t auto /dev/cdrom /media/t/cdrom\nmount: no medium found on /dev/sr0\n\n\nA: Have you tried a paper clip? Many CD drives, particularly older models, have a small hole into which you can insert the end of a paper clip and force the tray open. \n", "Q: How to remove the other DE's which get installed while installing GNOME and Cinnamon? I installed Cinnamon from the terminal and Cinnamon(Software Rendering) also got installed. While installing GNOME from the terminal and GNOME Classic, GNOME Flashback(Compiz) & GNOME Flashback (Metacity) got installed. As it is I have Plasma, MATE and Budgie installed and now there's just too many options in the DE menu of lightdm... I can't even scroll down to find unity any more. So can anyone tell a proper way to selectively remove Cinnamon(Software Rendering), GNOME Classic, GNOME Flashback(Compiz) & GNOME Flashback (Metacity) without losing Cinnamon and GNOME?\n\nA: Found it!\nTo remove both the GNOME flashback sessions all I had to do was run\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-session-flashback\nfollowed by\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nfrom the terminal. To remove GNOME Classic and Cinnamon(Software Rendering) I used this guide\nHere's how I did it:\nFrom the terminal run:\ncd /usr/share/xsessions\nNext List all the sessions using\nls\nAll the DE's which show in the lightDM menu should be listed there. Now all you have to do is remove the ones you don't need using\nsudo rm session-name.desktop\nI wanted to remove GNOME classic and Cinnamon(Software Rendering) so I ran:\nsudo rm gnome-classic.desktop\nfollowed by:\nsudo rm cinnamon2d.desktop\n\nProof:\n\nP.S:The above workaround only removes the entry and DOES NOT UNINSTALL THE PACKAGES. And if you're wondering how I got the steam login, here's how.\n", "Q: Where is the 1:1 zoom button in Image Viewer in Ubuntu 16.04? I want to use the 1:1 zoom in Image Viewer (eog). But i can't find the icon (or the option), which used to be there in the 14.04 release. Where is it?\n\nCompare it with this image: \n\nThis has the \"1\" icon which lets me view the image at 100% zoom.\nAlso, other Ubuntu \"stock\" applications like Text Editor (gedit), Videos, etc do not have the toolbar buttons. Is this the new look going forward?\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 is based on gnome 3.18. Applications such as eog or gedit (are part of gnome desktop environment) are updated versions and this is modified interface. In eog you can click + and set 1:1 zoom (just move to mark).\nIf you don't like the way it looks you can downgrade applications to previous versions like this example.\n\nA: Click the ↗ button to view the picture in full-screen mode. In that mode, there is an auto-hiding top toolbar with all the old toolbar icons.\nIf you use the Actual size mode often, you may find it useful to use the keyboard shortcut. Just press the 1 key on your keyboard and press F to return to Best fit mode.\n", "Q: How to disable automatic file extension and force writing to existing file with 7z?

The 11n_disable option disables 802.11n features. Adding it to /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf makes the change persist after reboots (because it will be part of the module config). The modprobe -rfv commands are removing the kernel modules iwldvm and iwlwifi, and finally the last line modprobe -v is adding iwlwifi back in.\nTo know what those kernel modules are/do, you can run modinfo <module name> | grep description, which will tell you the following:\niwlwifi is an Intel(R) Wireless WiFi driver for Linux (generic Intel drivers)\niwldvm is Intel(R) Wireless WiFi Link AGN driver for Linux (more specific drivers)\n", "Q: Common protected (Encrypted) partition for both Windows and Ubuntu I have installed Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 on my hard drive (Dual Boot). I like to have a common encrypted partition which will be available for both Windows and Ubuntu. \nWhen I was using Windows as my only Operating System, I used BitLocker for this. Since now I'm using both Windows & Ubuntu, I cannot use BitLocker because BitLocker doesn't support Ubuntu.\nSo, What is the best way to have a common encrypted partition?\nIn addition, are there any partition formats/types (fat32, NTFS, etc.) specially designed for encryption? \n\nA: This might work with LUKS encrypted containers. You have to create one with\ncryptsetup -s 512 --hash sha256 luksFormat /dev/partitionNode\n(Soon to be released KDE Partition Manager 2.2 can also create luks partitions but at the moment you would have to compile it yourself)\nThen open your encrypted device with\ncryptsetup open /dev/partitionNode cryptName\nand then format device /dev/mapper/cryptName with some filesystem.\nThen there are a few options for inner FileSystem.

Add repository for the latest driver (maintained by lwfinger on GitHub) and install it.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hanipouspilot/rtlwifi\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rtlwifi-new-dkms linux-firmware\nIf you cannot install the driver then, disable secure boot from BIOS ( some notebooks have had this issue). \nYour wifi-adapter should be working now (though maybe having weak signal or disconnects after some time).\nStep 2. Edit the configuration file for the new driver for specific antenna selection and power management,\n--First make a backup.\nsudo cp /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf   /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.old.conf\nthen,\necho \"options rtl8723be fwlps=0 ips=0 ant_sel=2\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf\nStep 3. reboot\nYour wifi-adapter should be working better now. It is suggested to test wireless connection under load for some time. User may test with ant_sel=1  or removing this parameter to ascertain best working condition. With every change reboot is needed.\nMore information: With future kernel update, no additional configuration is needed since linux-firmware is also installed. \nReferring solutions : Another issue with rtl8723be\nDriver development by lwfinger on GitHub: rtl8723be driver  Follow this for future updates.\n\nA: I've been searching for a solution for hours now always finding one that suggests installing the driver from https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new/ which no longer exists.\nTurns out you no longer need that driver as it is part of the kernel now. But you might run into a terrible signal strength issue I was experiencing myself on my laptop.\nThe only thing that needed to be done was to execute this in a terminal:\nsudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf <<< \"options rtl8723be ant_sel=1\"\n\nAs suggested here. Hope this helps someone running into the same problem.\n", "Q: How can i install Mongodb on 32 bit ubuntu?

For more details, refer KB article KB25230\"\nThe links to \"KB article KB25230\" are broken.  I tried the accepted answer at the linked question, but it didn't help.  I also tried manually selecting 32bit java with \"update-alternatives --config java\".  Is there anything new in 16.04 that has to be done?\n\nA: I had this issue too until I installed 32-bit java7 (which is not provided by default in the 16.04 repositories; they have java8).\nI grabbed an old unsupported one from oracle; there is hopefully a nicer way to do it via the package manager and openJDK but I just needed to get things working.\nSo I think it is an issue with the VPN software not liking java8.\n", "Q: can't install python modules using pip I am trying to install python module \"scrapy\".

Thanks.\n\nA: .bashrc is not meant to be executed but sourced. Try this instead:\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nTo edit the file run nano .bashrc\nHope it helps\n\nA: If what you are trying to do is open the .bashrc file for editing, you need to open it with any text editor, such as nano, vi, or gedit. If you are trying to update after altering it in any way, you could use source .bashrc command.\nFor instance, \n# Open the file with nano text editor and make changes you want\n$ nano ~/.bashrc\n# Run source command to apply changes\n$ source ~/.bashrc\nfoobar@ubuntu:$ \n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between executing a Bash script vs sourcing it? \n\n*How can I add a directory to PATH in a script so that it affects the calling shell and the rest of the session? \n\nA: ~/.bashrc isn't supposed to be executed. You're supposed to run something like gedit ~/.bashrc\nYou're getting that error because the execute bit isn't set, but it shouldn't be.\nYou can also source it to edit by running nano .bashrc when you're in the root.\n", "Q: no wifi with 16.04 on dual boot laptop I can't get my wifi to work on my laptop dual boot W10 / U16.04\nApologies for the post formating mess I really don't understand how to do it right.\nAlso I am really new to Ubuntu, I posted all these reports because I found them in other posts but I don't understand what all this means so if you can help, please don't hesitate to \"explain like I'm 5\" !\n\n\n*\n\n*Secure boot is disabled\n\n*sudo lshw -C network result :\n-network DISABLED    \n   description: Wireless interface\n   product: QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter\n   vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n   physical id: 0\n   bus info: pci@0000:07:00.0\n   logical name: wlp7s0\n   version: 32\n   serial: 30:52:cb:17:6d:6f\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n   configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath10k_pci driverversion=4.4.0-22-generic firmware=WLAN.RM.2.0-00180-QCARMSWPZ-1 latency=0 link=no multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11abgn\n   resources: irq:130 memory:64000000-641fffff\n\n*-network\n\n   description: Ethernet interface\n   product: RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller\n   vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n   physical id: 0\n   bus info: pci@0000:08:00.0\n   logical name: enp8s0\n   version: 15\n   serial: 30:65:ec:8c:30:ae\n   size: 1Gbit/s\n   capacity: 1Gbit/s\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n   configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=full firmware=rtl8168h-2_0.0.2 02/26/15 ip=192.168.0.14 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes port=MII speed=1Gbit/s\n   resources: irq:125 ioport:3000(size=256) memory:64204000-64204fff memory:64200000-64203fff\n\n\n*lspci result :\n    lspci\n    00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Sky Lake Host Bridge/DRAM Registers (rev 07)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sky Lake PCIe Controller (x16) (rev 07)\n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Skylake Integrated Graphics (rev 06)\n\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H USB 3.0 xHCI Controller (rev 31)\n\n00:15.0 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H LPSS I2C Controller #0 (rev 31)\n\n00:15.1 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H LPSS I2C Controller #1 (rev 31)\n\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H CSME HECI #1 (rev 31)\n\n00:17.0 SATA controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H SATA Controller [AHCI mode] (rev 31)\n\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H PCI Express Root Port #3 (rev f1)\n\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H PCI Express Root Port #4 (rev f1)\n\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H LPC Controller (rev 31)\n\n00:1f.2 Memory controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H PMC (rev 31)\n\n00:1f.3 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H HD Audio (rev 31)\n\n00:1f.4 SMBus: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H SMBus (rev 31)\n\n01:00.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM107M [GeForce GTX 950M] (rev a2)\n\n07:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 32)\n\n08:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I have been using Ubuntu 14.04 as my main OS for about two years now. I wonder what are the advantages of the new LTS version (i.e. 16.04) so I can decide whether I should upgrade or not.\n\nA: There are basically three things to consider.\n1.  Lifetime\nUbuntu does have a limited shelf life.  Every two years, Ubuntu puts out an LTS (Long Term Support) version.  Starting with 12.04, the long-term support lasts (security updates) lasts 5 years.  While you can keep running any given version of Ubuntu indefinitely, it is unwise to run a computer without security updates, particularly if you are online.\nTherefore, if it were just the security updates, it would seem logical only to update every 4 years or so, and skip one LTS version out of two.  However, on forums etc., you will find that the current LTS version will be the easiest to find debugging, etc.  Frequently, I have updated a computer to the newest LTS simply for that reason.  And often, the bug is fixed in the newest release.\n2.  Features\nThough this is very subjective, there is no doubt that 16.04 has additional features.  It is somewhat controversial as to whether those features are desirable or not, but in general, for the average user, it makes one's workstation more useful to be using the latest GUI (Graphical User Interface).\n3.  Upgrades\nMany packages are more up-to-date in 16.04, meaning more functionality, more usability, and more compatibility.  Furthermore, the fact that it is more up to date means that it there may be more programs available to do the job you need to do.\nBottom line:\nBasically, you're better off if you upgrade, but if it's a lot of trouble to do so, you can afford to leave it for a couple years or so.\n", "Q: Grub rescue after udpating to Ubuntu 16.04 I tried to install Ubuntu 16.04 on another computer running Ubuntu 14.04 from a bootable USB stick. During the installation I chose not to delete the existing files, but only to remove Ubuntu 14.04 and install Ubuntu 16.04. I got a warning message telling me to create a partition with at least 1 Mb and a specific name (which now I don't rembember). Quite stupidly, I ignored that message and continued the installation. The installation was succesfully completed, but now I can boot from neither the USB stick nor the hard drive.\nIf I try to boot without the USB stick, I get \n\nerror: file not found\n  grub rescue>\n\nI tried to follow this page and I have the following situation.\n\ngrub rescue> ls\n  (hd0) (hd0,gpt5) (hd0,gpt4) (hd0,gpt3) (hd0,gpt2) (hd0,gpt1) (hd1) \n\nI set\n\ngrub rescue> set prefix=(hd0,gpt3)/boot/grub\n  grub rescue> set root=hd0,gpt3\n\nbecause only with this choice I get a meaningful answer to\n\ngrub rescue> ls /\n\n(in all other cases I get \"error: unknown filesystem\").

Note that I also tried to run insmod normal on all other partitions (as suggested here), but without success.\nIf I try to boot from the USB stick, I get a screen of incomprehensible messages, and I can't do anything.

I'm about to install Ubuntu 16.04 on it and dual boot. I'm wondering how much disk space shall I give to both OSes because I want to keep them both on the same partition (C drive).\nMy aims:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows boot shouldn't slow down.\n\n*If there's a safety threshold (because I've seen at some place that Windows System Restore needs at least 50GB free space or something) of memory size for Windows C drive, I want to keep a healthy margin above that size.\n\n*I don't want to compromise Ubuntu by giving all importance to Windows.\n\n\nMy framework:\n\n\n*\n\n*My personal files and data are all stored in drives other than C drive. Big software like Maya and Adobe MasterCollection and games are not installed in C drive.\n\n*The C drive is 99.9GB and 49GB is free right now.\n\n*Even with Ubuntu, I'll store my data on those other drives (like B for bulky software, A for personal files, D for movies, etc.).\n\n\nMy question: How much space shall I allocate to both OSes looking at all this information? \nI have a related question -- if I'm running Ubuntu, does the disk usage required by Windows (reserved disk space for Windows) get invoked too? Suppose I give Windows x GB and Ubuntu y GB then if I boot with Ubuntu, will I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only be able to use y (C drive - x GB)?\n\n*Be able to use the whole C drive?\n\n*(If x < y) experience no problems because Windows isn't invoked at all?\n\n\nA: I just did the same setup on my computer. Apparently I am able to run Windows 10 with just 50 GB and some software installed, of course you need to make sure to always keep it kinda clean. The Ubuntu partition itself needs about 30 with software on mine. So it should work.\nThe question about the access depends on the kind of disk-formating you intend to use for ubuntu (ext4 recommended). In that case Ubuntu can access the Windows-partition (recognized as a second disk) but Windows cannot handle the Ubuntu partition that easily without software. Thats why in my case I made a data-partition which stores, well, all data and then the two partitions for the Window/Ubuntu.\n", "Q: network-manager crashes My networking was working fine yesterday. I shut down, went to bed, and when I booted up this morning it won't even talk to the router; network-manager crashes. \nI was wondering how to upgrade packages when it can't connect to the internet. My Ubuntu 15.10 laptop (this machine) connects to the internet through the same router just fine.

I had to setup the connection manually via command line to get to the internet and then I upgraded Ubuntu. After the upgrade it works fine. If you have DHCP on your router and using the cable, just type the following two commands:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 up\nsudo dhclient\n\nIt helped me to connect to the inernet and to update Ubuntu. After the update it works as yesterday. I have no idea why this happened.\nI am not sure how to do it if you use WiFi. I am not sure replacing eth0 with wlan0 will work. If you use WiFi password protection, the procedure to connect via command line is more complicated. Some pointers in this case: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/92799/connecting-to-wifi-network-through-command-line, https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90778/how-to-bring-up-a-wi-fi-interface-from-a-command-line\nYou can also try to download packages to another computer and transfer them to your laptop and install them there. Here are the instructions how to install updates without internet connection: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware#Installing_packages_without_an_Internet_connection\n\nA: The solution proposed by 'nobody' hasn't worked for me as my computer was unable to connect via ethernet and \"sudo dhclient\" didn't give any output. \nThis worked for me: Solution if you're unable to connect via ethernet.\nThe step 2 proposed by 'r2rien' worked as a charm and it is really simple, just download the three files (libnl, libnl-genl, libnl-route) in an online computer, put them in a USB stick and install them in the offline Linux via:\nsudo dpkg -i libnl-*.deb\n\nthen you just have to restart the service with: \nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\nA: I have the same problem, but I can't start network. ifconfig shows only the device lo.\nSo I start the PC with CD in live mode.

I think I made a mistake while installing my Ubuntu operation system because now there's no free space on the / partition. I already have unallocated memory though. Can that help? \nGparted Screenshot:\n\n\nA: You would have to shift your partitions in order to make room for the root partition. I think you should be able to do it in the method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move /dev/sda3 the left. (How much depends on how much space you want to add to your root partition).\n\n*expand /dev/sda4\n\n*Move Partitions if you have to, I think you might have to move partition /dev/sda7 to the right.\n\n*Expand /dev/sda6 to fill up the space you just freed up.\n\n\nIn order to make these changes you would have to boot from an Ubuntu Live USB. The Ubuntu Live USB comes with GParted So you can easily make these changes.\n\nA: You would have to boot from a USB and then resize with Gparted. The only issue is that you risk losing the partition all together.

I've used ndiswrapper but the page seems out of date. Any suggestions? \n\nA: Executable files not only contain the executable code, but also information like static and dynamic data, linker info and library imports.\nWhen you execute a .exe or linux executable, there's another program that loads the file, sets up the memory, sets up the various data and code blocks contained inside the executable file, and makes sure the executable has access to the shared library functions it needs.\nOn Linux, executables are stored in ELF format (Executable and Linkable Format). On Windows, executables are stored in PE format (Portable Executable).\nThere are also major differences between ABIs and APIs, and on Unix-y systems. Wine in an example of loader that can open, link, and execute code and libraries in PE format on an ELF-based OS.\nSo, in simple words, you cannot run a windows executable(.exe) on your Ubuntu to install your drivers.\n\nA: Simply install from the repository with:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ndiswrapper\n\nAfter that you have to set up according to this tutorial continuing from the point No. 3.\n", "Q: Upgraded to 16.04 and kwallet now empty I had a failure during an attempt to upgrade from 15.04 to 16.06 Kubuntu, so has to reinstall.

When I try to close a tab in Gnome Terminal, it says:\n\nClose this terminal? There is still a process running in this terminal. Closing the terminal will kill it.\n\nHow can I find out what is still running? Note that there is nothing in the output of jobs.  Thanks.\n\nA: If you started some process in terminal (eg. gedit) than the Process ID (PID) (of bash) and Parent Process ID (PPID) (of gedit) for this two processes will be the same. This can be seen in the output of \nps -ef\n\ncommand. To make it more readable lets first \"pipe\" the output to grep to find the PID of all \"bash\" processes currently running and than \"pipe\" it again to awk. The awk selects only the PID and process name fields (field 2 and 8) and outputs it to the screen.\nps -ef | grep bash | awk '{print $2 \": \" $8}'\nThe number in the output is PID. You will use it to find what process was started in terminal that has that PID. Note that there can be more than one line of output if you have more than one terminal opened. Now to find the \"child\" processes (if any) of that terminal-sessions we can use this command:\nps -ef | awk '{if ($3 == EnterPID) print $2 \": \" $8;}'\nYou must enter the PID number in place of EnterPID in the last command. If there is more than one PID for \"bash\" you must try them all. \nThe last command just looks the output of ps -ef and searches if PID (that you have found from previous command) and PPID are the same for any process. \nMore info:\nman ps \nman awk\n\nA: You can take a peak at the processes who list your shell's PID as parent.\nAs you may or may not know , we can specify ps format\nSHELLPID=$$ ; ps -e  -o cmd,pid,ppid | awk -v shell=$SHELLPID  '$NF~shell'   \n\nHere, we get the shell's PID from special variable $$ into SHELLPID , which then can be used by awk in pipe's subshell. Essentially we're just listing processes in form  NAME,PID,Parent PID , and filter out only those who have the appropriate PID in the last column.\n\nA: ps T\n\nSelects all processes associated with the terminal.\n\nA: You can use htop. In Ubuntu 16.04 ( and higher), you can install it just by typing sudo apt-get install htop.\nYou can also use top . \n", "Q: Change Home Directory location Just installed a ssd drive with 16.04 how can i point Ubuntu to the old drive for home folder with all my files?\n\nA: First use lsblk to find the device id of your old drive.

So, you cannot grow or shrink a partition from the OS on the partition itself.\nIf you need to boot from another partition, a good choice is to boot from the Ubuntu Live medium and start gparted from there because you won't have to deal with much differences to your day-to-day Ubuntu.\nBoot from the Ubuntu Live medium, start gparted, shrink your Linux partition and also grow your Windows partition from gparted. Do it in one step - it helps avoiding mistakes by booting to the Windows Recovery and working with diskpart from Windows. This is a OS-agnostic step. gparted is actually the best program to deal with since it has more options and is more user-friendly than diskpart.\nAfter this, you can reboot into the system of your choice with the new size.\n", "Q: Can I install the all the software included with Ubuntu Studio on Kubuntu without losing the KDE environment?

I have a roadmap of things I wish to accomplish with this evaluation and have been fairly successful until it came to getting the wireless network configured.  I believe the problem is limited to WPA authentication since I can disable WPA on both the network and the laptop and this allows me to connect (and stay connected) with no problems.  If I enable WPA on both ends the laptop indicates that it connects but roughly 10 seconds later it disconnects and then immediately tries to reconnect.  This repeats continuously.  \nThere is a lot of information available regarding problems like this but one of the things that is confusing me is that there is some documentation that applies to Linux in general and other documentation that is distribution specific and it is not always obvious to me which is which.  This is further complicated by the fact that the way something is done evolves over time as distributions mature yet web pages offering helpful tips tend to remain long after their information no longer applies.  Thus, I've tried to narrow my searches to information posted within the past year.  The primary document I'm using is help.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-help/net-wireless-connect.html.  Unfortunately, the troubleshooting sections don't cover authentication issues.  This document mentions nothing about \"wpa_supplicant\" which I've seen mentioned a lot on the web.  I've tried to configure and use this (unsuccessfully) and don't know if I've made things worse in the attempt.\nAny ideas on what to check next would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks,\nDave\n\nA: The wireless is now up and working.  I dug through syslog and saw that wpa_supplicant was giving up at the end with a reason code of 14.  I tracked down what this meant and found it was a MIC Error.  That made me wonder about the Wireless Access Point I was using.  I tried a new one and everything came right up.

You can download 12.04 at http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ or 14.04 at http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/\nIf you have an older, 32-bit processor, you may need the ...-i386.iso file instead of the ...-amd64.iso file.\nWhen you boot into the Ubuntu installer, one of the options should be to erase the disk and install Ubuntu.\n\nA: The solution to both the original post and the problem with booting are the same. Long as the Hardware meets requirements, provided on site of most .iso downloads,these problems can be solved.\nFirst obtain the desired OS .iso. Get to the desktop and transfer the .iso to home. Burn the .iso back to device. I kept the .iso on my USB in case something went awry. What should happen normally a window will pop up and follow instructions for installtion. \nFor me I had to have a Internet connection, otherwise install would revert back to previous settings. Added with the possibility during the hours of fetching packets someone had fun with my stuff, causing problems (see comment). Certain other factors lead me to believe that possibility.\nInstall not working and my now buggy OS didn't recognize the boot. Whats has to be done to fix all of this is open terminal and make the desired device with the .iso an option in boot menu. Shut down and turn back on in boot screen. Provided everything was done correctly, the option will be there, select device. Install/upgrade will work normally.\n", "Q: Minimum processor speed for 16.04 I have an Intel Pentium N3700 at 1.6 Ghz. Am I out of luck with 16.04?  If so, what is then suitable? Please and thanks in advance.\n\nA: I run multiple computers with processors slower than the Pentium N3700.  I haven't noticed much difference in processing power with 16.04 over earlier releases, but I haven't done any benchmarks. I have found, however, that some video cards have performance issues.  \nI say see what the performance is like on your hardware running a trial from the installation media.

Try \nsudo mount -o remount,rw /PartitionID /MountPoint\n\nEnter the right PartitionID and MountPoint.\n\nA: After a lot of attempt I solved the issue this way:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /PartitionID /MountPoint\n\nyou can find the partitionID with command sudo fdisk -l. The id looks like some random number. And MountPoint is the location of your drive. Usually resides in /media/user_name/. Even if after that you can't write, you might need to change the permission of writing using chmod sudo chmod u+w myfolder. \n\nA: I had the same issue, I fixed it with:\nntfsfix /dev/sdb1\n\nReplace sdb1 with your partition's ID.\n", "Q: Canon printer ink level detection When I installed Ubuntu 14.04 printing to my Canon MG6250 printer worked out of the box.

I have (a symlink) intel_backlight but it could be radeon_b10 or something else depending on your hardware. In any case, inside it you should find a file called brightness which contains only a number that represents the current brightness. Make a note of the number! To change this value first make sure you have this package:\nsudo apt install sysfsutils\n\nthen open the conf file with a text editor\nsudo nano /etc/sysfs.conf\n\nat the end of the file add a line like this:\nclass/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness = 4000\n\nreplace the path with the path to your brightness file (starting with class and no /), and replace 4000 with whatever number you think the brightness should be - my max brightness is 7812, so 4000 would make it about half as bright.

Kali Linux is named after the Hindu goddess of destruction which should give the user some indication that even Kali Linux itself is risky and difficult to manage, especially for new users.\nKatoolin draws its tools from a variety of sources including apt and GitHub. Katoolin doesn't know anything about the platform that it is running on, so the safest way to use Katoolin is to install each tool the hard way one tool at a time, checking each time to see if that tool is included in the default Ubuntu repositories and if so installing it that way instead. When the installation is finished, the software sources that were added by Katoolin should be immediately disabled in order to prevent Katoolin from replacing packages that were installed from the default Ubuntu repositories with its own updated packages whenever Ubuntu software is updated.\n\nInstallation of Kali linux tools\n(Re)install Katoolin as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install git  \ngit clone https://github.com/LionSec/katoolin.git && sudo cp katoolin/katoolin.py /usr/bin/katoolin  \n\n\n*Make /usr/bin/katoolin executable.\nsudo chmod +x /usr/bin/katoolin  \n\n\n*Run Katoolin as follows and you will see the Katoolin interface:\ncd /usr/bin/\nsudo ./katoolin   \n\n\nView the categories of available software in katoolin interface \n\nPress 0 to install all Kali linux tools.\nWhen you go to View Categories and then enter 0 for all, the installer will immediately return to where you were. Scroll up, and you'll see that a number of the packages can't be found. Those packages are no longer maintained or have been removed from the Kali repositories. Even with this issue, you'll still find a lot of the Kali software available for installation.\nSo the best option is to install Kali linux tools in a series of distinct steps. Just like if you want to install Forensic tools on your system, then choose its option from the category and then type 0 to install all forensics tools. If this still doesn't work, then you have to install whatever forensic tools that can be installed one package at a time. \nThis is why the Katoolin interface sometimes hangs when you try to install all of the Kali linux tools at once. Take the time of waiting for the server to respond to a request for a package that is not available and multiply it by how many unavailable Kali linux tools there are in the Katoolin repositories.\n\nIf you wish to go back to the main menu, type gohome in your katoolin interface. Now select the option 3 or 4 to install either the classicmenu indicator or the Kali menu. Press the y key to continue and then press Enter to start its setup.\nOnce you are done with installation of Kali tools using katoolin, you can quit by pressing the keyboard combination Ctrl+C and you will see the goodbye message. \nshutdown requested....Goodbye...\n\nCredit for the above text block goes to Kashif at How To Install Kali Linux Tools On Ubuntu 16 And CentOS 7 with my additions italicized.\n\nWarning about updates after installing Kali linux tools\nThe LionSec Katoolin GitHub webpage clearly warns Katoolin users to be careful when updating software.\n\nBefore updating your system, please remove all Kali-linux repositories to avoid any kind of problem.  \n\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16: edit file /usr/bin/katoolin and remove all references for the both packages: dff and webshag and save file.\nExecute katoolin again - choose 1 and then 2 to update - after that type back and choose 2 and then type 0.\nFor me it still showed an error for usb-modeswitch for version 2.2.5+repack0-1ubuntu1, so I installed using this package from ubuntuupdates.org\nAfter that I executed katoolin again - chose 1 and then 2 to update - after that type back and choose 2 and then 0 to begin installation.\n\nA: I have faced the very same\nEdit the file /usr/bin/katoolin (eg use sudo -H gedit usr/bin/katoolin) and remove those two packages, just search for text dff and webshag.

It is a mini ITX build using an asrock h110m-itx/ac motherboard and I use it primarily for coding, schoolwork, and gaming. Unfortunately I am having trouble with audio using this motherboard and honestly have no idea why. My case is a Coolermaster Elite 110 Mini ITX case, it comes with a separate front panel with a headphone and mic jack, when I plug in headphones there is no audio.  I have checked in the settings and there is an Analog output listed and the volume on it is all the way up. I have Wine and have attempted to install the audio drivers included on a CD that came with my motherboard, but to no avail. I also made sure that all the cords coming from the front panel are plugged into the correct ports on the motherboard. Any ideas on how to get my sound working?\n\nA: First off, did you try attaching speakers / headphones to the rear analog output in case you have a defective cable / connector?\nOtherwise, I notice that your motherboard has a RealTek 892 audio codec, which another user had issues with. You can see their post here and try out their solution: ALC892 Low sound issue fixed with changing alsa config, why does it work?\n", "Q: How to stream mic input with little to no delay(over lan) Seems the default answer is icecast + darkice but many people mention a delay of anywhere from 1-5 seconds. Is this due to hardware limitations?\n\nA: Icecast is not the answer. It is not designed for very low latency. You can trim the delays down to below 1 second, but it's not consistent across multiple clients. So if you have more than one player connected they will start drifting apart. For use cases like you imply them a constant (sometimes even adjustable) sub 100ms latency is key.\nAn approach more likely to succeed is VoIP software or network transparent audio servers like Jack or PulseAudio.\n", "Q: How to install driver for BCM4318 WiFi card on Ubuntu 14.04?

I know in Windows it's possible to change the location of user folders such as Downloads, Documents, Pictures, Music and so on.\nHowever, I haven't found something like this in Ubuntu. Even if it does exist, I highly doubt it would have any sort of support for NTFS.\nYou could always install ext2fsd on Windows and then set the Windows folder locations to their corresponding locations on Ubuntu. This is still a workaround, however. It's a little more integrated, yes, but ext2fsd doesn't always work. For that reason, I recommend not trying it this way.\n\nA: If you're looking to migrate user folders from Windows to Ubuntu, there is no simple one-click method or tool for this. You can permanently mount the Windows directories as your user directories as explained in Zacharee1's answer, but that will not cover you if what you stated in your question happens. If something happens to your Windows partition, or if you decided to get rid of Windows later on (yay for you!), you would lose those files (not yay).\nI would suggest taking the advice to automount that NTFS partition at start-up as stated in the other answer, but then I would diverge from there. Instead, save the following script somewhere in your home directory, such as /home/<USER>/winsync:\n#!/bin/bash\nrsync -avz /path/to/windows/pictures /home/<USER>/Pictures\nrsync -avz /path/to/windows/videos /home/<USER>/Videos\nrsync -avz /path/to/windws/documents /home/<USER>/Documents\n\nObviously, make the appropriate changes and then do a chmod +x /home/<USER>/winsync. Then, just add that script to your start-up apps through the Start Up Applications application. This script will copy over the data from your Windows user to your Ubuntu user each time you log-in to Ubuntu. However, because it's an rsync and not a cp, it will only copy over new/modified data. That way you don't have to worry about manually copying them over each time a change is made in Windows and you go back to Ubuntu. Now, even if you decided to get rid of Windows, your files will be safe.\n", "Q: How do i join a new node to conjure Open Stack Mitaka Now that I have the Mitaka version deployed using conjure, what would be the best method to add another compute node to this \"one stop shop\" deployment?\n\nA: conjure-up might let you go back into a running cloud and increase the number of machines allocated to a particular service.\nBut a better way is to start becoming familiar with the underlying Juju tools that conjure-up uses, because then you gain complete architectural flexibility.

There is only one version that appears in the dmenu(launcher bar). How can I set it up so i3 will launch the newer version that I need? I've attached a screen shot that will hopefully better illustrate what is going on. The left eclipse with white theme is what launches in i3 and I need the right one with the dark theme to launch. How can I archive this? Thank you.\n\n\nA: I ended up having to uninstall all versions of eclipse I can't remember the exact commands but basically I did sudo apt-get purge eclipse* and then also did whereis eclipse and deleted all of the directories it returned. After that I reinstalled eclipse and now when I launch dmenu I have an eclipse44 option that launches the current version of eclipse. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Cinnamon DE battery applet broken Has anyone noticed that the default battery applet in the cinnamon DE from the default Xenial repo will not consistently tell a correct percentage or time remaining?

Each time when I modify my program, the output png file changes. So I hope to have an image viewer that can automatically reload the png file once it detects that the png file has changed on disk.\nI have tried eog and viewnior, but none of them supports auto reload/refresh the image file. Can you suggest a better image viewer? \nI think inotify is a good tool that should be able to do this, but I am not sure how to use it.\n\nA: I have the same problem while experimenting with imagemagick. So I have written a simple image viewer which updates itself (using inotify): https://gitlab.com/dknof/siv For compiling you need the gtkmm dev libraries, version 3. Just call siv with the image(s). You can scale them with the keys 1 - 0 and the mouse wheel.\n\nA: \nI have tried eog\n\nCurrent versions of eog do reload the image automatically. There is also a plugin which adds an explicit reload option, if you're using filesystems such as FUSE which do not support inotify.\nfeh now also has an --auto-reload switch which uses inotify, along with --reload which uses a simple timer.\nMany more recommendations with this feature here:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/167808/image-viewer-with-auto-reload-on-file-change\n", "Q: rabbit vcs context menu not showing in ubuntu 16.04 I am unable to see the rabbit vcs context menu in the file manager window\nubuntu 16.04\nrabbitvcs installed via xenial repositories \n\nA: To solve it, I uninstalled the RabbitCVS\nsudo apt-get remove rabbitvcs*\n\ninstalled again\nsudo apt-get install rabbitvcs*\n\nand changed assigned permission to config file\nsudo chown YOURUSERNAME .config/rabbitvcs -R\n\n(please change YOURUSERNAME with your user name :D ).\nThis worked for me.\nOriginally posted here\n", "Q: Recently installed Ubuntu, having issues with multiple display setup I have an Asus Zenbook UX32VD dual booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 16.04 (installed last week) and I also have two external monitors hooked up to it via the HDMI and mini VGA ports.\nWhen I boot up and if anything is connected to the HDMI or VGA ports then my laptop screen gets disabled and only the display that is turned on works, note that I can't see the GRUB boot options but on booting Ubuntu I can see the background image. After booting into Ubuntu I can't see the prompt to login as, presumably, it's on the disabled laptop display.  I can't for the life of me figure out how to keep the laptop display enabled.\nIf I disconnect the HDMI/VGA and allow it to boot then I can see GRUB options on the laptop display and after booting into Ubuntu, also the login prompt. I can then login and plug in the other monitors to have them work.\nEverything was working OK up until today where.. the VGA display doesn't work at all unless the HDMI is also plugged in. If I unplug the HDMI but leave the VGA plugged in then the VGA display has no image. If I check the System Settings -> Displays .. it seems to detect the VGA display but I'm unable to use it.\nI tested against Windows 8 and it all works as expected, that is, regardless of which HDMI/VGA is plugged in... the laptop screen and the plugged in external display all function as expected.\nIdeas?\n\nA: So, personally I don't own this laptop, however I spent some time looking around. What I found was this:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AsusZenbook#HDMI\nThat help section basically says that if you want to use external displays, you'll need to leave them unplugged until you are booted up and logged in, which is what you've experienced. This seems to be an issue with the Nvidia Optimus drivers. If I find anything else in regards to this, I'll update my answer. \nAs for your second issue, you could get the Nvidia Optimus drivers fully updated.\nThis gentleman appears to have a solid tutorial on how to get those installed and configured:\nhttp://www.linuxveda.com/2015/07/16/how-to-install-drivers-for-nvidia-optimus-cards/\nI'd post his instructions, but they are rather long.\nThat may be worth a shot, though I'm not sure what nvidia drivers you are currently using.

My C drive has 100 GB space 50% of which is used. I have four different drives. (One physical HDD worth 1TB). Can I shrink A drive which is 263 GB and take out 30 GB space from it for /home and swap? Or do I have to use the same drive where Windows is installed?\n\nA: Linux can be install on any driver or any partition.  This also includes usb Pen drives as well as other usb or extended drives that are recognized at boot.\nThe Linux install comes with a GUI that will walk you through the steps.  When you boot the install disk it will give you default options, this includes installing along side Windows.  Choosing that option will give you a graphic slider to decide how much to specify for the Linux installation and how much to leave for Windows.\nBy your question details you might already be aware of the default options.  So you would choose the \"Something Else\" option of the install, and specify where you want Linux installed.  In this option you can also specify the drive or partition for your /home folder.\nVery specific to your question, you don't have to use the same drive where Windows is installed.  You can pick any drive, any partition, irregardless of where Windows is install, or whether Windows is actually installed or not.  When you use the something else option, the only parts of your drives or partition that will be touched by the install session will be the drives or partitions that you specify.\n\nA: Yes. You can shrink that 263 GB volume by following this guide. Next you can increase the space of your /home and swap using this guide.\n", "Q: Run Shell Script inside tmux Why after running tmux on a remote server via ssh, program works; but after detaching sessions, it returns 404?\nThis is a Go(golang) program, a http server listening on a port, behind a nginx reverse proxy.\nFirst data: everything works fine like this:\n1 - I connect to the server using ssh user@server-ip,\n2 - run tmux,\n3 - run this script inside tmux session, by . my-script.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ngo build -v\n\nexec 3>&1 4>&2\ntrap 'exec 2>&4 1>&3' 0 1 2 3\nexec 1>/tmp/myapi.log 2>&1\n\nexport API_COUCHDB_ADMIN='admin'\nexport API_COUCHDB_PASSWORD='************'\nexport API_COUCHDB_URL='http://172.17.0.2:5984/'\n# [some other env variables ...]\n./myapi\n\n4 - detach the tmux session by Ctrl-b and then d.\nSo far so good!

Directories are files, files are files and devices are files. Devices are usually referred to as a node; however, they are still files. All of the files on a system have permissions that allow or prevent others from viewing, modifying or executing.\nIn first one\n -rw-r--r--\n\nthe permissions are as follows for user, group and others\nowner = Read & Write (rw-)\ngroup = Read (r--)\nother = Read (r--)\n\nwhile in second one\n-rw-------\n\nonly user have read, write permission,i.e\nowner = Read & Write (rw-)\ngroup = None (---)\nother = None (---)\n\nFor more details read File Permissions Here\n\nA: The first file:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root 1502 May 14 23:06 file1.css\n\nThis file root root is owned by the user root which as you can see is specified by being in the file owner column of the listing.

The names of the user and group can be the same, or they can be different.  Using the Long Listing of ls (ls -l), you can see this type of detail about the file.\nQuick answer\nIn short, the difference is the specific userid owner and group id owner.

This effectively controls the CPU power as per need basis. Apart from that TLP as suggested above will help you optimize your system as per the power source. In battery mode it goes on saving mode and turns off turbo on CPU. In power mode all power saving optimizations are turned off. Power4Gear basically would run the CPU at full frequency under Windows. No need for that as Intel's own pstate takes care of that well.\n\nA: The linux world offers less 'pseudo optimization tools' from my point of view\nWhat you might consider is - and that doesn't covers everything for sure:\nTLP regarding battery usage\nTLP brings you the benefits of advanced power management for Linux without the need to understand every technical detail. TLP comes with a default configuration already optimized for battery life, so you may just install and forget it. Nevertheless TLP is highly customizable to fulfill your specific requirements.\nYou can install TLP via\nsudo apt install tlp\n\nSo tlp will most likely not boost your power (however you might define that) - but help optimize battery usage.\nGFX Driver regarding graphic power\nUbuntu comes with a GUI which lets you choose 'Additional drivers'.

I don't like all long directory paths to feel up my terminal's space so, I truncate them through a python script. I have edited the .bashrc file and replaced PS1 to\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND='PS1=\"$(python /home/vinay/bash_promt.py)\"'.\n\nAnd when I do that terminal's title doesn't work anymore. It simply displays Terminal Which is irritating. I can change the title manually by running following command in bash:\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\033]0;CUSTOM TITLE\\007\"'\n\nIs there a way to set terminal's title to the custom prompt which is being set in my bash.\n\nA: For gnome-terminal, the terminal title is set via PROMPT_COMMAND which is defined in /etc/profile.d/vte-2.91.sh.\nPROMPT_COMMAND, as defined in this script, does two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*changes the terminal title using the OSC 0 escape sequence (\\033]0;NEW_TITLE\\007),\n\n*changes the terminal's notion of the current directory using the OSC 7 escape sequence (\\033]7;NEW_CURRENT_DIRECTORY\\007, this is factored out to the __vte_osc7 function).\nShould you remove the second one from your PROMPT_COMMAND, your newly opened terminal windows or tabs wouldn't open in the directory where you were standing in the previous terminal. Most likely you don't want this.\nSo, in your shell startup scripts, after sourcing vte-2.91.sh you have to construct your preferred PROMPT_COMMAND that sets the title in a similar manner to vte-2.91.sh, and sets the current working directory exactly as it's done by default.\nI'm not aware of any way to refer to PS1's resolved value (that is, after substituting the username and such) inside PROMPT_COMMAND or anywhere else (let alone filter out the escape sequences such as color changes). If you wish to see the same string in your prompt and in the window title, I believe you need to duplicate the construction of that string for PS1 and PROMPT_COMMAND.\n\nA: This will work for you\nopen  ~/.bashrc . Find the line that says:\nPS1=\"\\[\\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]$PS1\"\n\nComment out this line, by putting a # character in front of it:\n# PS1=\"\\[\\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]$PS1\"\n\nNow add this line (you may want to put it just after the commented-out line):\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\033]0;Custom Name\\007\"'\nReplace Custom Name with whatever you want to change the Terminal title to be.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The escape sequence to use is ESC]2;new titleBEL where ESC and BEL are the escape and bell characters. Like \\[\\e]2;NEWTITLE\\a\\]. Using #Bash escape sequences, changing the title in your prompt looks like:\nexport PS1='\\[\\e]2;new title\\a\\]prompt > ' doc ref\nSo an example of a multi-color truncated bash prompt that also has a custom terminal title is:\nexport PS1='\\[\\e]2;$PWD\\a\\]\\e[93m$USER\\e[97m@\\e[90m$HOSTNAME \\e[93m$ \\e[0m'\nIn that example the terminal title will always reflect the present working directory ($PWD) and the terminal prompt will always look like the following regardless of what directory you are in: user@hostname $.\nYou can replace $PWD with CUSTOM TITLE to make the terminal title always reflect CUSTOM TITLE.\nUpdate\nBe careful when not wrapping non-printed characters in \\[ and \\]. It works without it and I've been doing it without them for years. However, as I found out today with some setups, it can cause some issues in terminal. Below is a cleaner version using variables and wrapping the color codes:\nT_YELLOW='\\[\\e[93m\\]'\nT_WHITE='\\[\\e[97m\\]'\nT_GRAY='\\[\\e[90m\\]'\nT_DEFAULT='\\[\\e[0m\\]'\nT_TITLE='\\[\\e]2;$PWD\\a\\]'\nexport PS1=\"${T_TITLE}${T_YELLOW}$USER${T_WHITE}@${T_GRAY}$HOSTNAME${T_YELLOW} $ ${T_DEFAULT}\"\n\n", "Q: pptpd in 16.04: can't establish the connection I can install pptpd in 14.04 using this short (9 steps) script:\nhttps://github.com/MdNor/digital-ocean-pptp-vpn/blob/master/ubuntu\nBut it doesn't work in 16.04: Windows client prints that it can't establish the connection.\nWhat step should be added for 16.04?\n\nA: It's not Ubuntu 16.04 - even if you had a slightly newer kernel set in 14.04 it would do this.

I have tried everything, but nothing is working.  I am on a Toshiba satellite c-50 b. \n Please help, it is important.\n\nA: I too have previously tried many different instructions without success and had almost given up when I found a working method using the very nicely created mkusb tool.\nPrior Considerations\nI am assuming you have the .iso file (of Ubuntu 16.04) already downloaded. If not get it.\nI have tried running these instructions from a Live USB stick so they should work from a LiveCD as well. \nNote that the USB stick I am live booting from is different from the one I intend to make as a persistent system. I.e. I have 2 USB sticks:\n\n\n*\n\n*The one I am booting from (it has Ubuntu 16.04 already)\n\n*The one I am about to make a persistent live USB.\n\n\nInstalling mkusb\nOpen a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the following commands one by one:\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install mkusb\n\nThe last command might fail (though unlikely) as mkusb (GUI version) has some dependencies that are not preinstalled/active in the live version of Ubuntu. \nNo need to panic though, the developer has also created a text only version. Run:\nsudo apt-get install mkusb-nox\n\nCreating the persistent drive\nI will focus on the main GUI version as that is the one I have used. So if you installed the default mkusb (GUI version) run:\nsudo -H mkusb /path/to/iso/filename.iso p\n\nFor example I have copied my Ubuntu iso to the the home folder, so I type:\nsudo -H mkusb ubuntu-16.04-desktop-i386.iso p\n\nThe last p parameter tells mkusb that I want a persistent live install. If you omit that you will get a simple live USB.\nAfter you run the command the GUI will open.\nFollow these steps next:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen 1: Click Select target device\n\n*Screen 2: Double-Click the device you want to install to.\n\n*Screen 3: Double check you have selected the right device. Tick the check-box and click Go.\n\n*Screens 4, 5: Just click quit and let mkusb decide what's best.\nAfter this mkusb will load some files. Wait patiently till the next input screen.\n\n*Screen 6: Enter the percentage of USB drive space you want to allot for persistence file-system. The remaining will show up as portable storage device. \nNote: Do not enter a value like 100% as some memory will be required for the Ubuntu OS files. Apparently entering 100% now works. As mentioned in @LMB comment, using 100% means the entire USB is used for the OS and the persistent storage\nDone!\nScreenshots\nThe whole process should look something like the following.\nRun the command in terminal:\n\nClick Select target device:\n\nClick on the USB drive to make persistent. I want to use my 32 GB one so I double click on option 2:\n\nDouble check very carefully and confirm. You don't want to mess up another drive.\n\nClick quit to let mkusb choose default:\n\nClick quit to let mkusb choose default:\n\nEnter a percentage of the drive to reserve for persistence. Mine is a large (32GB) so I allot only 20% ~ 6GB:\n\nIf all goes well you will be greeted by a nice green finished screen:\n \nNow plug your newly made persistent drive in any system and check if it really stores data/settings across reboots (Mine does).\nReferences\nYou can refer to a nice tutorial by Calvin Bui here to guide you through the GUI step by step or read through the detailed documentation \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\nThere has been a previous discussion about it here https://askubuntu.com/a/753163/585316 which I found useful.\nUpdate [August 2017]\nAs of 01-August-2017 the current version of mkusb (ver 12) is renamed as dus.

I see that inside VM it is owned by vagrant:vagrant user (which is absent from host machine) and share has rw bits set. But trying to create files there gives access denied error.\nI need  to understand what is going on to resolve the issue.\n\nA: Share modes define how the virtualised (p9fs) file system is presented to the guest machine. There are important implications for permission mapping. To understand this, it's important to remember that the virtualised file system needs to manage permissions of files and they may not be the same in the host as they are in the guest.\nThe best docs I have found regarding the modes is from the libvirt docs:\nThe filesystem block has an optional attribute accessmode which specifies the security mode for accessing the source (since 0.8.5). Currently this only works with type='mount' for the QEMU/KVM driver. The possible values are:\n\n\n*\n\n*passthrough\nThe source is accessed with the permissions of the user inside the guest. This is the default accessmode if one is not specified. More info.  Beware that changes to permissions/ownership will affect all guests using that filesystem.  This mode is generally quite fast.\n\n*mapped\nThe source is accessed with the permissions of the hypervisor (QEMU process). More info. \nThis means you need to make sure that files on the hypervisor are accessible to the QEMU process (username libvirt-qemu on my setup).  The advantage is that file attributes and permissions are \"mapped\" for the guest so that they are independent changes elsewhere (as long as the files stay accessible).  If your host system supports ACLs, this mode will also allow proper ACL support in the guest.  This mode is generally a bit slower than passthrough.\n\n*squash\nSimilar to 'passthrough', the exception is that failure of privileged operations like 'chown' are ignored. This makes a passthrough-like mode usable for people who run the hypervisor as non-root. More info\n\nA: I once had a very similar problem, providing read-write access to the shared folder. It was possible to read files but I was not allowed to write files to the shared source path folder.  \nUnix & Linux - KVM / QEMU / Virt-Manager : How can I store files in the mounted shared folder\nThe root cause is that the guest system is running as libvirt-qemu user. What you should do to create files from within the running guest system in the mounted shared folder are these steps :  \nIn Virt-Manager -> Add Hardware -> Filesystem select Mapped as Mode setting for the VM.\nChange permissions for the shared folders : sudo chmod -R 777 /<path-to-shared-folder>\nChange the owner to your username : sudo chown -R user:user /<path-to-shared folder>\nChange the permissions for virtual disk files : sudo chmod -R 777 /<path-to-virtual-disks>\nChange the owner to your username : sudo chown -R user:user /<path-to-virtual-disks>\nAdd your username to the libvirtd group : sudo usermod -G libvirtd -a <your-user-name>\nGive full permissions to the libvirt-qemu user : sudo setfacl -R -m u:libvirt-qemu:rwx /* \nNote : * = Specify the folder directory hierarchy you want to give libvirt-qemu the permissions.  \nReboot the host operating systems ... now you should be able to create files in the guest system.\nInformation about 9p virtio -> Sharing Host files with the Guest | QEMU Documentation 9psetup\nMode specifies the security mode for accessing the source. Mapped specifies that the source is accessed with the permission settings of the hypervisor. Passthrough specifies that the source is accessed with the user's permission settings that are set from inside the virtual guest machine. This is the default mode. Squash is similar to Passthrough, the difference is that the failure of privileged operations like chown are ignored, this makes a Passthrough mode usable for users who are running the hypervisor without elevated privileges.\n", "Q: 16.04 MariaDB -> Error in syslog (mysqlcheck) i've found the following failure in my syslog after installing Ubuntu 16.04 and MariaDB from the Scratch using this really awesome tutorial\nhttps://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/install-apache-with-php-and-mysql-on-ubuntu-16-04-lamp/\n    May 14 12:00:13 fortuna /etc/mysql/debian-start[1466]: /usr/bin/mysql_upgrade: the '--basedir' option is always ignored\nMay 14 12:00:13 fortuna /etc/mysql/debian-start[1466]: Looking for 'mysql' as: /usr/bin/mysql\nMay 14 12:00:13 fortuna /etc/mysql/debian-start[1466]: Looking for 'mysqlcheck' as: /usr/bin/mysqlcheck\nMay 14 12:00:13 fortuna /etc/mysql/debian-start[1466]: Version check failed.

I have done many Linux/Ubuntu installations on dozens of machines over the years.  I found an inexpensive machine in the \"HP ProLiant ML10 v2 Tower Server System i3-4150v3 3.5 GHz 8 GB RAM 500GB SATA 7.2K,\" for $260 online.\nIt appeared from the HP website that Ubuntu installation was a supported configuration, but I found some posts indicating that there might be a problem with the disk driver, with one post saying that there was not a stable driver available.  I could not find the drivers on the HP website, although I did find the manual at http://h20565.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?sp4ts.oid=7796450&docId=emr_na-c04622279&docLocale=en_US\nI bought the machine, connected an external DVD drive to the USB port, put a DVD with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server AMD64 in the drive, and turned on the computer.  \nAfter several cycles of a POST sequence, the system booted from the DVD, and the installation completed normally, including the GRUB install in the MBR.  At the end, the installation ejected the DVD, and prompted me to start the reboot sequence into Ubuntu.\nHowever, when the machine tried to boot from the HDD, I got the message \"Non-system disk or disk error.\"\n\nA: There are several posts about this problem over the past several years, but none that comprehensively describe the process for the ML10 v2, so I thought I would document my findings for those who want to use one of these inexpensive and capable servers with Ubuntu.\nHow to install Ubuntu Server on HP ProLiant MicroServer Gen8?, from 2014, describes the process of changing the SATA Conroller support with a ProLiant Microserver Gen8\nhttps://www.linuxserver.io/index.php/2015/03/24/hp-proliant-microserver-gen8-g1610t-setting-up-a-linux-home-server/, from 2015, describes the process in more detail, also using a Microserver Gen8, and includes screenshots, but I found they did not match exactly my BIOS screens.\nIt may be that the Ubuntu installation is able to adjust the controller so that the installation can write to the HDD, but that the boot BIOS does not make that adjustment.\nIn any case, what worked for me was to let the first stage POST complete, and then the second stage Processor Initialization will show an \"F9\" button at the bottom of the screen. Pressing the F9 key on the keyboard will \"light up\" the \"F9\" button, and after this Processor Initialization, the \"ROM-Based Setup Utility\" will start.  As per the screenshots in the second of the two references above, first select \"System Options\" and press Enter, then select \"SATA Controller Options\" and press Enter.\nHere, the new system is a little different than the screenshots shown for the Microserver Gen8 -- I had to select \"Embedded SATA Configuration,\" and when I did, I got a scary Yellow-on-Red warning that this would destroy my system (which would undoubtedly be true if I had a system installed).  \nPress Enter to get by this warning, then change from \"Enable Dynamic HP Smart Array B120i RAID Support\" to \"Enable SATA AHCI Support\", and press Enter.

The man page for xrandr is pretty good if you need help there.\nFinally what I learned in the process: gnome3 seems to not handle the multi-monitor setup well at all. It would work until login and then fail nearly everytime and start to misbehave. Even after updating to latest drivers. Additionally, Xubuntu handled the multi-head setup reasonably well right out of the box. Its just not my favorite distro.

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on a system with an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 950 graphics card. I had no problems until I switched on the iGPU (Intel HD Graphics 4600) in the UEFI settings. I want to use the NVIDIA card for some CUDA computation and the integrated graphics to drive a monitor. I can set this up pretty easily with an AMD card because it doesn't require additional drivers. The NVIDIA driver seems to be interfering with my integrated graphics card and I end up with a login loop if I select my integrated graphics as the POST display.\nI checked out Bumblebee, which doesn't seem related to my use case.

Normal releases are supported for about 9 months. 15.10 was released October 2015. If you install 15.10, you'll have to upgrade to 16.04 once the end-of-life date comes.\nLTS releases only let you upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu (by default) if the new version is another LTS. Even then, it waits until the LTS has reached x.04.1 before prompting you to upgrade. If you need stability, go with LTS.\nNon-LTS releases prompt you to upgrade on each new release, which is every 6 months. These are good for getting new features, drivers, kernels and programs, but are not the nest option for stability. If you upgrade from a non-LTS release to an LTS release, you will still be prompted every 6 months to upgrade. Use a non-LTS if you like new features and are more into experimenting.\n\nA: I generally recommend using last stable LTS version, thus Ubuntu 14.04\nDownload: http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/\n\nA: While @Zacharee1 post mentiones already the most relevant facts i would like to add that it might make sense to install the server version instead of the desktop ones.\nIts basically just a smaller amount of default packages.\nIt gives you the option to start a bit more from scratch and have something small to get started - choosing & installing a desktop environment by yourself etc...\nI would choose 14.04 LTS - as it gives you the option to do an entire upgrade from LTS to LTS (14.04 to 16.04) as well as another playground.\n", "Q: 16.04 reboots 4 seconds after shutdown completes (Acer Aspire V5-571P) My Acer Aspire V5-571P running Ubuntu 16.04 has started rebooting a couple of seconds after shutdown completes.

I've been searching all over but haven't found something to solve this yet.\n\nA: The problem seems to have solved itself. The avatar has now updated. \nI haven't done anything to specifically update it, though I suspect the times I have rebooted may have made a difference.

But the problem is that the fan started to behave crazy. It is working almost always making it impossible to focus on anything I am doing. Many times when it is idle, it starts to go on and off in very short period of time (few seconds). I saw that many other users of Dell had similar problems with previous editions of Ubuntu and I tried to follow the solutions, but until now, none has worked to some significant extent. I check the temperature of the CPU and is usually 45-55 degrees Celsius, which is not too much.\nSo, I am asking is there any workaround to this?\n\nA: There are few variations of N5110.\nIf you have one with Intel Graphic + Nvidia card, then Nvidia is heating up your laptop.\nSolution is to install Nvidia drivers which are offered in \"Additional Drivers\". I am using \"version 367.57 from nvidia-367\".\nOnce installed open up \"NVIDIA X server settings\" application; go to \"PRIME profiles\" and select \"Intel (Power saving mode)\".

Please, mind that prior to 12.04 the file had no .conf extension and this «feature» may get changed back in any later release):\nsudo nano /etc/i8kmon.conf\n\nEnter the following lines:\n# Run as daemon, override with --daemon option\nset config(daemon) 0\n\n# Automatic fan control, override with --auto option\nset config(auto) 1\n\n# Report status on stdout, override with --verbose option\nset config(verbose) 1\n\n# Status check timeout (seconds), override with --timeout option\nset config(timeout) 1\n\n# Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\nset config(0) {{-1 0} -1 55 -1 55}\nset config(1) {{-1 1} 55 70 55 70}\nset config(3) {{-1 2} 70 128 70 128}\n\n# For computer with 2 fans, use a variant of this instead:\n# Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n# set config(0) {{-1 0} -1 52 -1 65}\n# set config(1) {{-1 1} 41 66 55 75}\n# set config(2) {{-1 1} 55 80 65 85}\n# set config(3) {{-1 2} 70 128 75 128}\n\n6) Make sure there is /etc/default/i8kmon file and that it contains a line reading ENABLED=1\n7) Make sure there is /etc/default/i8buttons file and that it contains a line reading ENABLED=1\n8) If all the previous steps did not help, the versions of the «tk8.X» and «tcl8.X» libraries installed may be too old. The following commands worked for me, but I remember the 8.5 versions were installed manually by me instead of 8.4 some time ago. Hence, there may be 8.4, not the 8.5 versions in your system still:\nsudo apt-get remove tk8.5 tcl8.5\nsudo apt-get install tk8.6 tcl8.6\nsudo apt-get install i8kutils\n\n9) You may have to repeat editing /etc/default/i8buttons (please, see clause 7).\n10) Reboot  \n\nA: Try i8kutils 1.43 from https://launchpad.net/i8kutils\nThe kernel module in use is dell-smm-hwmon; i8k kernel module does not exist anymore in recent kernels.\n\nA: For me, It has been solved running the following:\nsudo apt install smbios-utils\nsudo smbios-thermal-ctl -v --set-thermal-mode=quiet\n\n", "Q: How to install last stable version of Gambas?

It provides baseline functionality, which is usually enough for the average user.\nUp until 16.04, AMD provided a proprietary driver (fglrx) that provided a few extra features (including better performance) for newer cards. However, with the release of 16.04, fglrx is no longer supported and will not work with the X display stack.\nAMD is focusing their efforts on a new driver, amdgpu that will serve as a replacement for the fglrx driver. However, it is only available for 14.04 at the moment. AMD has announced plans to provide a driver compatible with kernel 4.4 (used by 16.04) later this year.\nUnfortunately this means that if you want a feature not provided by the open-source driver, for now you will need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*downgrade to 15.10 or 14.04\n\n*wait for the newer driver\n\n", "Q: Not able to install ubuntu on msi PE 70 6QE I burnt a dvd from windows installation of 16.04 lts 64 bit.

Much of the information contained in this post was relevant to my troubleshooting: No version of Ubuntu can be installed with any Skylake 6th generation Intel processor\nI did not want to complicate the driver issue with getting UEFI working, so in this example I went with using the \"legacy\" mode in the BIOS to boot into linux, and UEFI to boot into Windows.\nI installed this version: VERSION=\"16.04.1 LTS (Xenial Xerus)\"\nWhich includes this kernel: 4.4.0-38-generic\nThis allowed me to avoid having to recompile a 4.3+ kernel for proper support.\nI had no issues with installing Ubuntu from a USB drive, and did not need to pass any boot options to the installer to get it to complete.\nLogging into a GUI after installation however would cause the system to lockup with a CPU getting pinned at 100% due to an lspci command.\nIn order to get the system functional, I took these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*When presented with the lightdm login screen, I switched to a\nterminal (CTRL+ALT+[1-4])\n\n*After logging in, edited the /etc/default/grub boot options to be: splash nomodeset i915.preliminary_hw_support=1\n\n*Edited /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and added: i195  nvme\n\n*Updated grub configuration: sudo update-grub\n\n*Hard reset the laptop (Hold down power button).\n\n*Login to a terminal again, NOT the GUI.\n\n*Apt-get update and install the nvidia-361 package: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-361.  This installed the\nnecessary firmware drivers and built the kernel modules.\n\n*Edit the /etc/default/grub boot options, and reset them to default.\n\n*Updated grub configuration: sudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot, and enjoy!\n\n", "Q: After suspend mode, Wi-Fi won't reconnect to open network, but works fine on secure network. Any suggestions? I have Ubuntu 16.04 on a 2007 MacBook. Wi-Fi works perfectly at home on my passworded Wi-Fi network, including after I suspend.\nBut at a coffee shop which has two open Wi-Fi networks, the Wi-Fi won't reconnect after I close the lid on the laptop. Also, the computer goes into some sort of low-power mode (screen dims), which forces me to stop working (even off my hard drive).\nMeanwhile, it works fine when I return home.\nI know from reading other posts there is a Wi-Fi / suspend bug, but I haven't heard of the problem occurring exclusively on open Wi-Fi networks (no password) while not occurring on a password-secured network. And I haven't seen any references to it effectively rendering the computer unusable.\nAny suggestions for a workaround that doesn't involve opening a terminal or installing a new kernel by itself? (I install all official Ubuntu updates immediately, but I'm not a technical person and I have no command line competence.)\n\nA: I don't have a solution :P I have problems with wifi even at my home, if the signal gets lost and then up again then the wifi, sometimes, can't reconnect (even with disabling-enabling wifi). The only thing I can do is run in terminal 'systemctl restart NetworkManager' and the wifi works again.

I can connect that same HDD with USB cable to my new PC. My question here is, can i just eject that external HDD and unplug it from USB, or do I have to turn off my PC completely in order to make my disk shut itself down and then disconnect it from USB?\nThis is actually real magnetic hard disc, not SSD or flash memory, just to be clear.\n\nA: Most external HDD are nothing more than an internal HDD in a case with a SATA-to-USB adapter. So no need to turn off your computer, you can use your disk like any regular external HDD. To remove it safely you can use your file manager's eject option or the umount command-line tool.\n\nA: I eject, then unplug any usb HDD without any problem.\nProblem could appear if unplugging  before the end of writing on the disk → eject first.\n", "Q: qualcomm atheros 168c0042-rev-30 i can't get my laptop WiFi up and running with ubuntu (Kernel 4.4.0-22-generic).\nI have a Qualcomm Atheros 168c:0042 pci adapter. \nThings I already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*The solution from this question (installing the firmware from git repo):\nQualcomm Atheros Device [168c:0042] (rev 30) Wi-Fi driver installation\n\n*I also tried using another Kernel (4.5 & 4.6), which showed some result.\nThere was a menu which i could use to connect to my WiFi, but i still\ncould not use the connection (no internet).\n\n*Install a backport (like described in the question above)\n\n*Format c:\n\n\nIs there something new i could try???

Not to mention that it screwed with the directories I originally had.\nThanks guys,\nDPC\n\nA: If you haven't change anything with root permissions (like in the /etc or /usr/share directory) you can always delete the folders ~/.APPLICATION_NAME, ~/.config/APPLICATION_NAME, ~/.cache/APPLICATION_NAME, ~/.local/share/APPLICATION_NAME and the folders will be recreated with default settings after you reboot or relaunch the application (the symbol ~ means your home folder which in my case is /home/thanos). In fact you can delete anything inside your home folder (you might get an error if you delete the trash folder) but you will loose any data that is in there (for example bookmarks in firefox, panel items configuration, installed games in steam, playonlinux's virtual drives or whatever), so keep a copy or choose wisely what you delete.\nFor example in  order to restore chromium settings you need to delete the folder ~/.config/chromium and it will be recreated when you relaunch chromium (delete the whole folder in order to be recreated not just some files in it).\nIf you have changed something with root permissions and you haven't kept a backup, I don't think there's any way to restore settings to their original state without purging and reinstall the applications that you have problem with.\nFor example to completely reset chromium:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run in terminal:sudo apt-get purge chromium (you can also use synaptic).\n\n*Delete the folders ~/.cache/chromium and ~/.config/chromium\n\n*Run in terminal sudo apt-get install chromium (you can also use synaptic or software center).\n\n", "Q: Mirror Hard Drive To New Hard Drive I am needing to copy my exact hard drive set-up to a different hard drive, so I can place this drive in a different PC and it be as if I was in front of the original PC.

My current laptop, a Toshiba Satellite, would reliably have a wireless problem under Ubuntu every six months, usually timing with an upgrade of the OS.

Instead, I just take a easy way by adding a hosts rule 127.0.0.0 www.sublimetext.com in /etc/hosts file. But take care, when you want to install some packages, you may remove this rule temporarily.\n\nA: As mentioned in the comments, the \"update_check\" setting has been ignored since about Build 3080. If it was working, setting\n\"update_check\": false\n\nin your user settings should disable the popup you are seeing. Unfortunately, that's not happening currently. You can follow this issue in the unofficial Sublime Text bug tracker to see if it gets resolved. \n\nDue to the relatively rapid pace of development at this time, instead of relying on the unofficial PPA, I would recommend instead installing from the Ubuntu .deb files located on sublimetext.com/3. See my answer here for simple instructions on how to do that. Basically, when the new version popup appears, click on the Upgrade button, which will take you to the download page. Click on Ubuntu 64-bit or Ubuntu 32-bit, depending on your system, and save the .deb to your Downloads folder. In the terminal, enter the following commands, where XXXX is the build number:\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i sublime-text_build-XXXX_amd_64.deb\n# or sublime-text_build-XXXX_i386.deb for 32-bit\n\nAnd that's it. Sublime is installed into /opt/sublime_text, and the subl shortcut is placed in /usr/bin. It will use the same config directory as the PPA version. If you wish to use sublime instead of subl, run this:\nsudo rm /usr/bin/sublime\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/subl /usr/bin/sublime\n\nPlease note that if you are a registered user (and you should be if you use Sublime professionally, or for an extended length of time; it's not freeware), you can use the dev builds, which contain more bleeding-edge features, and are updated much more frequently. These builds are only available via .deb.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit guest OS kernel panic on start up I have a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit guest OS running on VMWare Workstation 12 Player on a Windows 10 host.

The first packet came from  port 12601, and the second packet came from ip-.us-west-2.compute.internal's ssh port (port 22).\nThe fourth field (separated from the third field with a \">\" character, indicating the direction of the packet, i.e. it's pointing to the right, so the packet is coming from the third field to the fourth field) is the IP address or host name of the host receiving the packet, along with, for TCP and UDP packets, the destination port.\n\"Flags [...]\" is the TCP segment flags.  \"P\" is the Push (PSH) flag, so the first packet doesn't have any flags set (other than ACK), and the second one has the Push flag set.\n\"seq\" is the sequence number in the packet and the sequence number that the next data after that packet would have.\n\"ack\" is the acknowledgment number in the packet.  tcpdump shows sequence and acknowledgment numbers relative to the initial sequence number by default.\n\"length\" is the length of the data in the TCP segment.\n\nhow do you confirm there is an issue with the traffic\n\nBy knowing what issue you're looking for and seeing whether it's present.  Tcpdump doesn't dissect all protocol layers, so it might not show issues at all layers.

I just multiplied the first 2 \"1.0000000\"'s by the same number (which I guess are X and Y speed) and now my mouse has a good speed.\n\nA: The code above is a good one and probably will fix for most users however for the sake of documentation i want to share further:\nLubuntu, Ubuntu, Xubuntu lxinput, xinput mouse decelaration missing, no speed control, no acceleration control, only mouse pad working etc...

Start out with 0.2 , i'm using 0.4 but i like it slow so it may differ for you. This line of code is a life saver and works in every situation.\nYou need to add it to startup, it,s gone once you restart. Note that xinput only works after X session starts, which means you have to execute it after logging in.\nHere is how i did it on my lubuntu:\nCreate a script.sh file in somewhere isolated:\n#!/bin/sh -e\nxinput set-prop ID-HERE \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" HERE, 0, 0, 0, HERE, 0, 0, 0, 1\n\nCreate the file /home/USERNAME/.config/autostart/mouse.desktop :\nEdit and paste:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Mouse\nComment=Mouse sensitivity fix\nExec=sh /PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPT.sh\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nTerminal=false\n\nNow this app can be seen in your Default applications for Lxsession => Autostart tab.\nHope this helps someone since mouse problems with lubuntu is very common.\nEdit: Source for code\n", "Q: Synapse launcher crashes after any input from keyboard Everything worked perfectly after I installed it, but from this morning, every time when I launch it using Ctrl + spacebar it crashes immediately after I start typing anything from keyboard (even when I press arrow keys).

It is clear that the environment required for running a Windows application and an Ubuntu application are completely different. But a small package (of approx.  around 650 MB) is able to run Windows applications on Ubuntu. So how is this done?\nIt clearly won't simulate the entire Windows environment, so how far does it go by simulating the Windows environment?. What will wine do if certain setup files requite it to change registry keys (which Ubuntu does not have). Moreover, what does wine actually do while installing a Windows application on Ubuntu ?\nIt is not a virtual machine, so it must be missing many parts. I don't understand how far can it go, simulating the Windows environment. So briefly, what is it missing?\n\nA: Wine (originally an acronym for \"Wine Is Not an Emulator\") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, including Ubuntu. Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.WineHQ\nIn addition to allowing the user to install and run Windows applications just like you would in Windows, Wine provides these benefits over Windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Wine makes it possible to access Windows applications remotely.  \n\n*Wine makes it economical to use thin clients: simply install Wine on a Linux server, and you can access these Windows applications from any X terminal.  \n\n*Wine can also be used to make existing Windows applications available on the web by using VNC and its Java/HTML5 client. \n\n\nWhat is missing in Wine?\nWine does not support Windows USB drivers. Windows drivers are of zero use in Wine. Wine will only present the devices that are working in the Linux system.   \nReference: Ubuntu Community Docs: Wine \n", "Q: Plasma 5.5.5 NetworkManagement Widget won't load the QML file I am using Kubuntu 16.04 using Plasma 5.5.5 and Qt version 5.5.1.

I have a nightly process that SFTPs files from a Windows server to our Ubuntu server (12.04.5 LTS) using my username and login. A script is setup via cron (sudo crontab -e) runs later to copy those files, which are located in my encrypted directory, to an application directory. The script runs, but even using \"sudo commands\" the files never get copied.\nOf course if I'm logged in then I can reschedule the script for testing and it will run perfectly. I really need to script to run without me being logged in. Is there any way to have the script log in, then log out before it completes, or is there a better way to do this?\n\nA: So the script copying from the windows server to your ubuntu server's encrypted home (with eCryptfs right?) works OK, while you're logged in I'm assuming.\nThen later when you're not logged in, another script can not access your encrypted home. That's by design, nothing is supposed to be able to access your encrypted home unless you're logged in.\nYou could modify the script to automatically log you in, but that most likely would break the security.\nOr, you could have the second script run while you're still logged in.\n", "Q: How to get my disappeared network connection to work again?

I have created 100 GB for /. When I opened Nautilus I have found the root folder. So what is difference between / and /root?\nMy username is enigma, and I have a folder named enigma in the /home folder and another folder with the same name in /media. What is the difference between these two folders and when do I have to use the second folder?\n\nA: If you're coming to the Linux world (taking Ubuntu flavour as your choice or other one) from the Microsoft Windows world, then these folder structures might seem very confusing.\nTo answer your question, let me give a very brief introduction to the Linux filesystem. In a Linux filesystem every possible and accessible files, folders are created under the \"root\" filesystem and in Linux system it's denoted as \"/\" symbol (unlike Windows, where different Drives are created, named C:, D: etc. and you can create and store your files and folders inside those drives). In Windows, the OS is most of the time installed in C: drive. In Linux, everything comes under / (aka \"root\" directory). When you install the Ubuntu OS, you'll notice that, several existing folders are already there inside /. Open nautilus and click \"File system\" (or in some new version \"Computer\" under Devices) in the left sidebar. This is actually what is inside /. Among those folders there are two named \"root\" and \"home\". \nNow, In every Linux system, there is a root user who has all the power to change anything inside the OS (the super-admin ;), as I like to call it). You can create other users too. Whenever a new user is created, they'll have there own personal folder inside /home, e.g. /home/enigma (equivalent to C:\\users\\enigma in Windows). root user is the special one, who has one for his/her own directly under /, e.g. /root. Any user's personal directory is exclusively accessible to only that user (not technically only that user as root user can go & check & change anywhere). The other one with the same name as the User's name under /media is for mounting (beyond the scope of this discussion for mount, sorry, have to learn separately) storage devices like external HDD, Pendrive, CD/DVD etc. Modern Ubuntu handles them nicely and give a shortcut to those devices on the desktop. But, if you want to access those files through the terminal (command line), then you have to traverse like \ncd /media/enigma/ <your device name>/<folder/file name>\n\n\nA: / is the root.  /root is a folder called root in your root folder (/)\n/home/enigma is your home folder; ie., where your documents are stored, your Desktop, your Music, your videos, your configuration files, etc.  /media/enigma is the folder where removable devices, ex, USB sticks, external hard drives, cd's, etc. are mounted.  In other words, if you want to access a removable drive, the place you would go to would be /media/enigma/1TB drive or whatever the name of your drive is.\n\nA: The difference between / and /root is easy to explain. / is the main tree (root) of the whole Linux file-system and /root is the admin's user-directory, equivalent to yours in /home/<username>.\n\nA: In a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ is called the root directory, for the whole system; all directories of the system descend from this directory one way or another.\n\n*/root is the root user's (more precisely the user with UID 0's) home directory\n\nA: A user's home directory is sometimes referred to as ~ and in the case of root that is /root/.  For other users, perhaps users that cannot 'see' the rest of the system--they are chrooted into a directory where what they see is '/' as the base, even though parent directories exist.\nIf you can see 'everything'-- '/' is the topmost level of everything on the file system.\n\nA: \nI just created a picture for you to make it clear. The Linux system is like a tree. The bottom of the tree is the \"/\". The /root is a folder on the \"/\" tree.\n\nA: Your home directory is usually /home/$USER, but root's (administrator or superuser, the user that has full privileges) home directory is /root. Since you're not root, you're not able to see the contents inside /root without asking for root access (usually with the sudo command and a shell or file manager, e.g. sudo nautilus). \n/ is the filesystem root. It is like the C:\\ drive in Windows. The difference here is that other drives are mounted inside /, usually in /media/$USER/DRIVE (current user only) or in /mnt/DRIVE (for all users).\nTo sum up:\nInside your home folder, you'll find your Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc. And inside your media folder you have your \"mounted\" drives (except for /, because it doesn't have to be mounted). So /root is just a home directory inside the real filesystem root.\n", "Q: Problem connecting laptop (Ubuntu 14.04) to WiFi network Okay, so I recently downloaded Ubuntu and installed it to run alongside Windows 7.

After I got it to recognize my music, I'm facing the same issue as Saurav on Superuser when trying to run it in inside a Unity session:\n\nI recently installed Gnome music on a Ubuntu 14.04 16.04 system  with Unity desktop. However, there is a peculiar issue. Every time I play a song several windows pop up (six same windows for each song). So when the entire song list is played I have several pop-up windows open and I have to manually close them. Is there a setting which can help resolve this situation? Is it particular to Unity desktop?\nSee attached pic.\n\n\nI went a bit further as stated in my comment to Saurav's question:\n\nI can confirm this on a few installs of 16.04. To test I used a 16.04 VM installed ubuntu-gnome-desktop logged into the gnome session and gnome-music worked as intended. Back in the unity session I got the pop in the screenshot (and the unity desktop has gnome elements all over the place and looks broken).\n\nQuestions:\n\n*\n\n*Can anyone shine some light on why this happens in Unity while it works fine in Gnome on the same installation?\n\n*Can this be fixed?

People are going to great lengths to get the gedit R plugin back by downgrading gedit.  I tried, but couldn't make those instructions work.  Mostly now I'm sad.  RStudio is shiny and everything, but it is just so slow and annoyingly over-helpful.  And nothing else seems to approach the elegance and \"minimality\" of RGedit.\nIs RGedit going away forever?  Are there any plans to bring it into the new gedit that ships with 16.04?  What would I have to learn in order to bring it back?  What sort of programming would needed, and how hard would it be?  I'm not really fluent in anything but R...\n\nA: As you can see on the rgedit homepage it has not been maintained since 2013 and this is obviously the reason why it got dropped.\nFrom my personal experience I can tell you a try to get it working with the latest gedit is more than pain in the a** and almost impossible without rewriting the whole plug-in.\nAs far your downgrade attempts, you should definitively should check out the guide I made for that. There you even find a script which does the downgrade for you.\n\nA: According to the info provided in the survey link in Mauricio's answer, you can use RGedit with Pluma editor, which is available from the repos:\nsudo apt install pluma\n\nPluma is a fork of gedit2, maintained by Mate desktop project.\nAlternatively, I personally felt in love with Sublime Text + sublimeREPL plugin combo, which works splendidly for me. Sublime Text is light and fast and at the same time very advanced editor (and my most favourite piece of software, because it's such a problem solver) and I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for good editor. The R implementation is almost on par with Rstudio, however it's much lighter on resources. There are keyboard shortcuts for sending code from script to R session, you can make plots (making screenshots of just focused window saves plots without window decorations, at least in elementaryOS on my small netbook, where I use this setup), navigate console history on a minimap (including printed help). As a bonus (compared to gedit), Sublime Text has the best and most flexible implementation of multiple cursors I've seen so far (e.g. Rstudio has it, but rather cumbersome to use practically), which is a huge helper every day.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 - How to override fonts? I recently installed Ubuntu 16.04, everything went nice and smooth except when I installed Chrome, and logged in to my account to check my watch history on YouTube, then I came across this weird looking font:\n.\nI checked with Inspect Element to see what font it was, turns out it was \nfont: 12px Roboto,arial,sans-serif;\n\nPersonally, I don't like it, though on Windows I like it.\nInspect Element's font is weird also.\nWhy are they different?\nCan I change it, currently I'm using Open Sans as my main font.\n\nA: The default fonts you're disatisfied with are those which are set within your browser, and overriding the system fonts may not be the best approach. If you are using Firefox there are font setting preferences, and if using Chromium you will need to install an extension. You can then preview and choose your preferred fonts in a more flexible way. To get the Microsoft default system fonts in Ubuntu, install the package ttf-mscorefonts-installer via your preferred method (ie apt in a terminal, synaptic, or otherwise) to get Arial. As an alternative to Arial, I also recommend the fonts-texgyre package, with TeX Gyre Heros as the best free Helvetica alternative (actually a highly developed and extended set of Nimbus, a grotesk which has a history prior to Helvetica).\nMore specific to your situation, the diagonal stroke thinning on the \"S\" and \"s\", as well as the compressed counters and narrowed aperture in \"e\", and too-low middle stroke of the \"E\" seems to indicate that you are using the infinality package. To my taste, this package is very unsuited to the default tweaks Ubuntu is already applying to the freedesktop font rendering, and much better for most other distros (like Fedora or OpenSUSE). Basically, it's correcting in addition to the corrections that are built into Ubuntu by default, rather than replacing them. I think the Ubuntu defaults are the best font rendering on any desktop operating system, but if you are a long-time Windows user they will look very different (much less strongly aliased). I recommend uninstalling infinality if you do have it on an Ubuntu installation, and if you want to try a tweak, use unity-tweak-tool to turn font hinting off completely (allowing the renderer to make all the decisions itself).\nSome example screen shots of Youtube at different magnifications, in Chromium. Note that changing system hinting preferences in unity-tweak-tool (and logging out and back in to restart the session) did not change the rendering of these tiles in-browser.\nRoboto (Youtube default, to compare with OP's screenshot):\n\nRoboto (size decreased as a test of the compositor's aliasing capabilities):\n\nArial (as alternative font) this is with hinting turned off completely, RGBA aliasing. The font renders in a very crisp, MS way.\n\n\n\nA: 13.04 and later\nFor Unity interface users, customisation of fonts can be done using unity-tweak-tool Install unity-tweak-tool\ntry this and let me know..\n", "Q: Does apt-get autoremove remove intel graphics drivers? I have been trying to install the gtk+ packages on ubuntu 14.04. I had installed 3.20 of gtk+ & later had to install gtk+3.10.  In the process of doing all this I executed many apt-get commands. One of them was \nsudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module:i386 \n\nwhich asked me to run an autoremove command and I did\nsudo apt-get  autoremove \n\nwhich removed several packages. I did the  libcanberra install after the autoremove. \nNow when I start ubuntu I am getting \"your system is running in low graphics mode\" error and I have no desktop environment at all. How do I get it back. I have read several articles on fixing this low graphics error but not clear on what to so. lspci -nn | grep VGA shows \"VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controlller [8086:0a06] (rev 0b0)\". \nI am not sure how much of the above detail is relevant for the problem at hand but posting it based on some questions that were asked in other posts. I need to get my desktop env working back again.\n\nA: To focus on your past experience, if autoremove is going to remove \"more than you intended\", it's only doing that because those packages are no longer depended upon. That happens when you accidentally remove something :)\nA common example from the good old days would be removing something Compiz-related. apt-get would show you a list of Compiz packages it was going to remove and you'd miss that ubuntu-desktop was also in there. ubuntu-desktop is just a meta-package that depends on all the packages that make up the desktop so removing it doesn't directly remove anything...\n... But when you do an subsequent autoremove, all those things that ubuntu-desktop was the sole dependency... They're going bye-bye.\nA few lessons:\nsudo apt-get remove <package> will warn you what it's going to remove directly. It won't notify you about knock-on effects.\nsudo apt-get autoremove should also warn you what it's going to do.\nUse apt-get -s autoremove to do a simulated dry run if you're unsure. You can use that on all apt-get commands.\nIf you reboot and you're staring at TTY1 wondering what the monkeys you've nuked this time, /var/log/apt/history.log should have you most recent activity.\nIf in doubt, check ubuntu-desktop is installed.\nIs autoremove safe? It's heavy machinery so it's only as safe as the driver... But that said, it's hard to do permanent damage.\n", "Q: Bad language translation This is not error or problem, that I need to solve.\nWhen I am using Ubuntu in my language (Slovak) there are sometimes some bad translated words (or at all). Can I some help guys, which are \"programing\" Ubuntu with that words/sentences?\n\nA: Those who work with translating Ubuntu into Slovak are the members of the Ubuntu Slovak Translators team. You may want to contact them and get involved in improving the Slovak translations.\nGenerally, if you find a bad translation, you can submit a bug to Ubuntu Translations.\n", "Q: Cannot reinstall python3 on ubuntu 14.04 I think that I accidentally broke Python3 and was unable to do anything. I read somewhere that the solution was to remove python3 and reinstall it, but I got yet another problem: I was able to remove it, but not to bring it back. I tried the following:\nsudo apt-get install python3\n\nand\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall python3\n\nbut I keep getting the following message:\nE: The package python3 needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.\n\nWhich seems to be redundant given that the problem is not having python3 on the first place. Every time I try to use apt-get install I get the same error.\nI have Ubuntu 14.04 on my Toshiba Satellite P75-A7200, and it was working perfectly fine for almost 2 years until I accidentally (dumbly) broke python3.\nThanks!\n\nA: OP: Apparently deleting python3 was one of the dumbest mistakes I could have made. I couldn't reinstall it because it seems that a lot of basic functions (including installing packages) depend on python3. It even broke my GUI when I restarted my computer. Luckily I was still able to backup my data and make an almost pain-free re installation of Ubuntu 14.04 (without messing up my other partitions). I guess I got lucky.\nShort answer for other unexperienced Linux users like me: Do NOT uninstall python3 or any other pre-installed programs unless you absolutely know what you're doing. Ever.

I had to go to another network working linux machine and execute these commands to save the pre-upgrade packages to a usb stick:\n$ wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/libn/libnl3/libnl-3-200_3.2.21-1_amd64.deb\n$ wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/libn/libnl3/libnl-route-3-200_3.2.21-1_amd64.deb\n$ wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/libn/libnl3/libnl-genl-3-200_3.2.21-1_amd64.deb\n\nThen, insert the usbstick in the problem machine, mount it, cd the directory where your files are and execute the command:\n$ sudo dpkg -i libnl-*.deb\n\n...and the reboot.  That should fix your network issue.\nUbuntu will then want you to upgrade those packages again.  I did that and it broke mine again but someone else reported that more packages came up to upgrade and upgrading all of them fixed the original issue.\n\nA: P. Miller's answer put me in the right track. It is solved now. What I finally did is: \n\n\n*\n\n*To downgrade the libn libraries as suggested. Although it is not necessary, I also downgraded the kernel to the previous version. This had my ethernet port blink again, but I had no connectivity yet. \n\n*For the ethernet I wrote\nsudo ifconfig eth0 up\nsudo dhclient eth0\n\nThis is not permanent, but you can edit /etc/rc.local (sudo gedit /etc/rc.local) and insert sudo dhclient eth0, so that the final result is:\n #!/bin/sh -e\n #\n # rc.local\n #\n # This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n # Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n # value on error.\n #\n # In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n # bits.\n #\n # By default this script does nothing.\n sudo dhclient eth0\n exit 0\n\nAfter rebooting, ethernet was working again.\n\n*Recovering the wifi took longer. In my case, being a Broadcom card, the usual b43 driver did not work, while the suggested one in Software and updates -> Additional drivers, did (bcmwl-kernel-source). Just click to accept the suggestion. In principle, it will produce the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-bcm43.conf blacklisting the rival modules. To make sure that there are no interferences from b43, you can type\nsudo modprobe -rv b43\n\nDependencies are updated with\nsudo depmod -a\n\nFinally, to access the missing wifi icon in the taskbar (nm-applet), I did as in other threads:\nsudo apt-get install indicator-applet indicator-network\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager-gnome\n\nOnce again, after a final reboot, wifi was back again.

It does work if you only launch a terminal by clicking the desktop button but for me that was insufficient. So I came up with a solution that would fix this issue and dynamically place the Terminal window at your current pointer position.\nI wrote a little bash script that you can put at the very end of your ~/.bashrc  and it positions any Terminal window you open at the $X and $Y position of your current mouse pointer position.

It opens okay. But it won't connect to localhost.\nAnyone have any luck?\n\nA: This question might be two years old but my work with mysql-workbench tonight seems to have given me the answer to it.\nroot user now users auth_socket authentication by default.  The only way root can gain access is by being logged in as root.\nI found this out by running  mysql -u root both as root user and standard user.\nIt would not work under standard user.\nSo my next question was - what user does mysql-workbench run as.  Turns out it runs as standard user by default.  To get it to run as root user it has to be run from root.  So I went into root user CLI and type 'mysql-workbench'.\nI then had to go into the settings for the root user as shown here.  The file location is valid for an ubuntu 18.04 installation.\n\nIf that socket location is invalid then you'll need to go into the mysql CLI from root or sudo and run the following command.\n\nAfter you have the correct settings test the connection.  It should be successful and you're ready to go.\n\nA: The issue is likely due to socket authentication being enabled for the root user by default when no password is set, during the upgrade to 16.04. This important caveat is documented in the 16.04 release notes:\n\nPassword behaviour when the MySQL root password is empty has changed.\n  Packaging now enables socket authentication when the MySQL root\n  password is empty. This means that a non-root user can't log in as the\n  MySQL root user with an empty password.\n\nFor whatever reason, the MySQL Workbench that came with 16.04 doesn't work out of the box with MySQL server, at least for me. I tried using \"Local Socket/Pipe\" to connect in a number of different ways but to no avail.\nThe solution is to revert back to native password authentication. You can do this by logging in to MySQL using socket authentication by doing:\nsudo mysql -u root\nOnce logged in:\nALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';\n\nwhich will revert back to the native (old default) password authentication. If you've attempted some other method to fix the issue, you'll want to make sure the \"plugin\" field in mysql.user is set to \"auth_token\", which may require using mysqld_safe to log in to MySQL in the event you've been tinketing with things, like I did.\nCredit to Miguel Nieto's blog post for this solution.\n\nA: MySQL 5.7 and up don't support connecting as \"root\" in mysql-workbench so you must create a normal user and connect via that.\nsudo mysql -u root -p\n\nCreate a user named \"admin\" and use that to connect in mysql-workbench.\nCREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;\n\n\nA: Create an user account with appropriate administrative privileges that can connect via mysql workbench using the auth_socket plugin. Note that this does not work for root connections to the mysql server.\nLogon to mysql from a terminal session:\n$sudo mysql\n\nIf you are able to do this then the auth_socket plugin is enabled and the root account is authenticating using this plugin. Note that this is the default setup when installing mysql on ubuntu after having run the secure installation script.\nFirst create a mysql user for your account 'valerie':\nmysql> CREATE USER 'valerie'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_socket;\n\nEnable administrative privileges for the account:\nmysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'valerie'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;\n\nExit the shell:\nmysql> exit\n\nThen in mysql workbench:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new connection\n\n*Select the connection method as Local Socket/Pipe\n\n*Set the Socket/Pipe Path to: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (note that this is the path for a Debian / Ubuntu system and changes for other flavors of Linux)\n\n*Set the username ('valerie' in this example)\n\n\nYou should be able to then connect to the mysql server with this connection.\n\nA: Try this\nselect mysql database\n\nuse mysql;\nUPDATE user set plugin='mysql_native_password' where User='root';\nflush privileges;\nexit;\n\nThen\nsudo service mysql restart\n\n\nA: Open terminal of your ubuntu system and enter below code,\nIn my ubuntu 20.04 os system it works fine, able to enter password and workbeanch working fine.\nsudo snap connect mysql-workbench-community:password-manager-service :password-manager-service\n\n\nA: Works fine for me and I did nothing special.

Currently, whenever I git pull or git push to a http(s) repository, I get the following:\n$ git pull\nUsername for 'https://gitrepos.reposdomain.com': me@mydomain.com\nPassword for 'https://me@mydomain.com@gitrepos.reposdomain.com': \n\nThis is ok for infrequent use, but starts to become really annoying very quickly.  Unfortunately, switching to ssh is not an option in this case.\nI've read that earlier versions of git provided a credential \"store\" and \"cache\", but that this wasn't advised because it stored the password in plaintext.\nBUT \nNewer versions of git apparently store git credentials in the gnome-keyring, but it has to be set up correctly.\nI've tried following other (non-Ubuntu) answers on SO to get this to work (namely this one), but I'm still presented with the username and password prompt.\nWhat is the correct and safest way to store git credentials for http(s) repos and how does one make them work on Ubuntu?\n\nA: You need to setup the git credential helper with Gnome Keyring:\nInstall and compile the Gnome Keyring devel:\nsudo apt-get install libgnome-keyring-dev\nsudo make --directory=/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/gnome-keyring\n\nAnd setup the credential:\ngit config --global credential.helper /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/gnome-keyring/git-credential-gnome-keyring\n\n\nA: This simple approach appears to be sufficient on my Ubuntu 18.04.1 with git 2.17.1:\ngit config --global credential.helper cache\n\nYou can specify a one hour (=3600 seconds) timeout like this:\ngit config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'\n\nFurther reading in the fine manual.\n\nA: gnome-credential-helper is now deprecated.\nInstead, use libsecret. If it's not already pre-installed on your machine, use the following procedure:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure libsecret and its development libraries are installed:\nsudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev\n\n\n\n*Then build the credential helper from the sources shipped with libsecret's development libraries:\nsudo make --directory=/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret\n\n\n\n*Finally, register the freshly compiled binary as a Git credential helper:\ngit config --global credential.helper \\\n   /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret\n\nMore details on https://stackoverflow.com/a/40312117/2017781\n", "Q: Ubuntu misindentifies external monitor - how do create a new monitor definition with a correctly sized viewport?

It wouldn't bother me except that Ubuntu thinks the monitor is bigger than it is, so the controls for a maximized window are just slightly out of reach.\nAny ideas how to troubleshoot this? Or how to create a new monitor definition with a correctly sized viewport? Thanks!\n\nA: You can either set it in some GUI app but I'm not sure about the level of customization or using a command-line tool xrandr:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/man1/xrandr.1.html\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution\n", "Q: How to create a shared partition between Ubuntu and Windows I had read this how-to manual, however, I'm not sure how to proceed with my partitions. Here is a list of my partitions: \nI am using Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7.\n\nA: That huge unallocated space you have is perfect for enlarging your existing extended partition. Since Ubuntu can interact with NTFS (Windows) partitions, but Windows cannot interact with EXT4 (Linux) partitions, your best option is to create an NTFS partition in that free space.\nFirst click /dev/sda4 and drag it to the right, then create another partition inside the free space.\nWindows allows you to change the location of certain user folders, such as Downloads, Documents, Music, etc. You can do that from each folder's Properties. It would help with integration to change their locations to somewhere on the data partition.\nYou can then follow this answer to setup up shortcuts from Ubuntu to the corresponding directories on the data partition.\n\nA: You should be able to access the windows drive from ubuntu (unless windows is only hibernated, then it's locked) therefore the easiest way is simply to store your personal data on the windows partition..\nDownloads folder is configured in Web browser, documents in any office app you use...so it shouldn't require setting anything in the system\n\nA: The easiest way it to just use a file system that both OSes can read natively.  NTFS and fat32 are the two primary choices.  The partition then should be available for mounting in both OSes.\n\nA: As has been said, Ubuntu is able to read your windows (NTFS format) partition just fine, except if it has been locked by windows (windows does that when it hibernates).\nAs of now, your best alternative is to have another NTFS partition for storing files you intend to use on both OSes. That \"unallocated\" space in your hard drive is perfect size for that. Click that, then \"Add\" and GPARTED will guide you through the process. IF you run into a problem (most likely you won't) regarding number of partitions: click on your /dev/sda4 partition, and resize it to the the maximum amount of space. The \"unallocated\" space will now be inside of that \"extended\" partition, and you'll be able to create a NTFS partition in there (following the previous steps).\nI must point out that your Ubuntu installation is very small, and will run out of space quite easily. Considering you have plenty of free space, you should extend you ubuntu partitions a bit (or a lot). This should be done before you use up your unallocated space.\nYour sda5 is where software will be installed, and sda6 is where your personal files are stored (eg. your Download folder - mine tends to get huge in little time). Resizing these partitions is easy and well documented here in askubuntu.\n\nA: It looks like your disk is formatted in MBR mode, and as such can only use 4 partitions, so you can't use your unallocated disk space for a new shared partition. Your Windows partition is large enough, but your Ubuntu partition is tiny. I'd recommend extending your Ubuntu partition to use up all of your unallocated space. In Windows, be sure to turn off FAST BOOT and/or HIBERNATE, or you'll corrupt Windows if/when you mount the Windows partition whilst in Ubuntu. Then edit your Ubuntu FSTAB file to mount the Windows partition when booting Ubuntu, and you'll have your shared disk space. Just place your shared files into your user folder in the Windows partition. Cheers, Al\n\nA: You can easily achieve this on your Linux without doing anything on your Windows. If you have already created the shared partition via Windows before, delete the partition and follow these steps.\n\n*\n\n*On your Linux app list search bar. Type Disks\n\n*Click Disks from the app list\n\n*On the left menu select a storage device (Hard Disk) you want to partition\n\n*On the main page select one of the storage volume you want to resize.\n\n*Click the settings button below the volumes bar\n\n*Click resize...\n\n*Reduce the partition size to create free space\n\n*Click Resize\n\n*On the storage volumes bar, select the new space you just created\n\n*Click the plus button below the volumes bar to create a partition\n\n*Click Next to proceed\n\n*Enter volume name (e.g ShareVolume)\n\n*Select type as For use with all systems and devices (FAT)\n\n*Click Create\n\n*Restart your system and you are done.\n\nFor video reference watch https://youtu.be/NtlXZSHL6NE\n", "Q: Qualcomm Atheros QCA9565 not detected by ubuntu 16.04 According to this page here this driver should work out of the box but not for 16.04.

So I connected the speakers and started to play the song via the Internet. I then returned back to the game at which point the music stopped, as the screen being displayed was not the music, but not the screen. On leaving the game and returning back to the music screen, the music started to play again.\nSo I cannot have music playing through the Bluetooth speakers without having the music page up. This meant that I could only use the tablet for one purpose (playing music from the net). \nIs there a setting I can activate to allow the music to continue to play in the background (via the Bluetooth speakers), whilst I go to different screens on the tablet? If not this would be a really good idea to implement.\n\nA: I guess you are playing the music by using the browser.\nNormally, only that app is being executed which is currently shown at your screen. This is done to bring the best performance to the currently used app and to extend your battery life. \nThis means if you switch from the browser to the game, the browsers stops running and your game continues excecution. If you switch back, the browser continues excecution and the game is stopped, thus you can't get a gameover in game while doing other things like writing some emails.;)\nNevertheless, thus its not possible to listen to music in browser at youtube and playing a game atthe same time.:(\nWhat you coukd do instead: Use the musicplayer to listen to music, because this app is an exception of the above concept. Or switch on the Convergenced Mode on your tablet, because in this mode all aps are running at the same time.:)\n\nA: The only way I have been able to do this is by playing music via the media player and then viewing other screens. This does mean that I do not have the selection of web sites such as YouTube.\nThe idea that you could use one screen to play music and another to play a game is a good one.\n", "Q: Automatically Mount SD card I have a beagleboard running Ubuntu.

However, it seems I cannot make any partition in this stick. I have attached an image. \nPicture: 'New Partition Table' is disabled\nNow I tried to look for other options, like: Can't create partitions on installation, but mke2fs did not do any good or I did not use it properly.\nAlso, looked into this: Why can't I create a partition table on my USB flash drive using GParted?, but palimpsest is not available.\nAny kind of help to create/put a boot loader, root and swap partition on same usb stick would be appreciated.\n\nA: Apparently gparted couldn't format the drive, neither it could create new partition table. However, deleting the stick in gparted does a successful operation. Then, partition can be made during installation.

But I'm not sure about this.\nOccasionally at some random moment one of the monitors turns off. It looks like there is no signal on the monitor. In 2-5 seconds the monitor turns on. This might happen several times in a row with small delays or might not happen for a long time. Both monitors might turn off at the same time or one by one.\nI do not understand why this happens. Either I do not understand what should I do to reproduce the issue. Last time (a moment before I wrote this) this happened when I switch to a different tab in Google Chrome and pause YouTube music video. But when I try to do the same one more time the issue is not reproduced. I kept using the computer all the time looking at the screen and writing this question at the moment when issue happened\nI failed to find any signs of the issue in the logs.\nMy issue looks close to Monitor turning off randomly Ubuntu 13.10 with the differences that only one monitor might turn off instead of two and they turn on automatically.\nBy coincidence I've entered the command xset -q and pressed enter key right at the moment when the monitor turned off.

I had a refresh rate 59.95 Hz and decided to change it to 58 Hz.\nIdentify existing refresh rate\nxrandr -q\n\nCreated parameters for the new mode\n$ cvt 1920 1200 58\n\n\\# 1920x1200 57.93 Hz (CVT) hsync: 72.01 kHz; pclk: 185.50 MHz\nModeline \"1920x1200_58.00\"  185.50  1920 2048 2248 2576  1200 1203 1209 1243 -hsync +vsync\n\nRegistered new mode\n$ xrandr --newmode \"1920x1200_58.00\"  185.50  1920 2048 2248 2576  1200 1203 1209 1243 -hsync +vsync\n\nAdded this new mode to both screens\n$ xrandr --addmode DP1 1920x1200_58.00\n$ xrandr --addmode DP2 1920x1200_58.00\n\nSelected this newly added mode for both screens\n$ xrandr --output DP1 --mode 1920x1200_58.00\n$ xrandr --output DP2 --mode 1920x1200_58.00\n\nAs a result now xrandr -q shows the following output\n$ xrandr --query\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 3840 x 1248, maximum 32767 x 32767\neDP1 connected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n   1920x1080     60.00 +  59.93  \n   1680x1050     59.95    59.88  \n   1600x1024     60.17  \n   1400x1050     59.98  \n   1600x900      60.00  \n   1280x1024     60.02  \n   1440x900      59.89  \n   1280x960      60.00  \n   1368x768      60.00  \n   1360x768      59.80    59.96  \n   1152x864      60.00  \n   1280x720      60.00  \n   1024x768      60.00  \n   1024x576      60.00  \n   960x540       60.00  \n   800x600       60.32    56.25  \n   864x486       60.00  \n   640x480       59.94  \n   720x405       60.00  \n   640x360       60.00  \nDP1 connected 1920x1200+0+48 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200     59.95 +\n   1920x1080     60.00  \n   1600x1200     60.00  \n   1680x1050     59.95  \n   1280x1024     60.02  \n   1280x960      60.00  \n   1024x768      60.00  \n   800x600       60.32  \n   640x480       60.00  \n   720x400       70.08  \n   1920x1200_58.00  57.93* \nDP2 connected primary 1920x1200+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200     59.95 +\n   1920x1080     60.00  \n   1600x1200     60.00  \n   1680x1050     59.95  \n   1280x1024     60.02  \n   1280x960      60.00  \n   1024x768      60.00  \n   800x600       60.32  \n   640x480       60.00  \n   720x400       70.08  \n   1920x1200_58.00  57.93* \nHDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nVIRTUAL1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nI'm checking if the issue repeats or not now. If it does not this means that I've got the solution and I'll mark it as answer.\nI still do not know how to permanently store these settings, I guess I should add a new file to the /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d folder following recommendations in this document. I'm going to study this when I see that the issue is fixed.\n\nA: If your screen is switching off it might be struggling to keep sync with the output signal. \nThere are two main reasons for this , the first is refresh rates being too high for the screen to keep up with and the second is the cables are not good enough. There is an outside chance your graphics card can't cope with multiple screens but most are powerful enough.\nWhich connection method are you using and what resolution are the screens set to ?\nXrandr will allow you set and query the refresh rates.  Sometimes knocking a few hz off the frequency can work around bad cables.\nIf you have other cables you can borrow try them.\nyou xorg logs (in /var/log/ but check the dates of the files) should show the resync attempts and shed some light as well\n\nA: The same has been happening to me intermittently over several months. I use Ubuntu 16.04 and have a Dell Latitude-E7440. There seems to be a pattern here with laptops! Mine seems to be due to the battery not charing properly and the Energy settings getting changed some how. I ran this to turn the Energy features off.\n$ ~ xset -dpms\n\nThis resolved my screen turning off randomly.\n\nA: I had this exact same issue on lenovo thinkpad E550 notebook. \n\n\n*\n\n*one monitor turned off at random moment\n\n*after few seconds it turned itself back on\n\n*it was happening only to monitor connected via VGA\n\n*it was happening only when notebook was on adapter (this took me a looong time to figure out)\nIt turned out that there was a firmware issue on significant number of thinkpad notebooks, fortunately a firmware upgrade was released.\nUnfortunately upgrade can be only performed on Windows (I had dual boot). Instructions here\nIn case the link dies, you have to download this zip file and follow the instructions in the manual inside the zip. \n\nA: I had the same issue with Kubuntu 20.04 and a two monitor setup powered by a cheap Intel UHD Graphics 600 mini-PC.\nI tried all the given solutions here and none worked. What we discovered was that when we unplugged one of the two monitors, the problem went away. We figure the cheap design of this low-cost mini-PC was to blame--it couldn't drive 2 monitors at once reliably.\n\nA: Ok,\nThis may sounds crazy, but that is what I had:\nIf you laptop is near some electric equipment, it may cause this malfunction.\nIn my case I another laptop under this one and he was the one probably causing magnetic interferences. I checked it numerous times to be sure.\n", "Q: apt-get equivalent of this command I'd like to know the equivalent of the  \ndnf remove *nvidia*\n\nwith the apt package manager.\n\nA: That would be:\nsudo apt-get remove '.*nvidia.*'\n\nThis will remove all packages that contain the string nvidia in their names.\nIf you want to remove the configuration files too, use purge:\nsudo apt-get purge '.*nvidia.*'\n\n\nNote that, for this kind of operation, you should do a --dry-run first:\nsudo apt-get --dry-run remove '.*nvidia.*'\n\n", "Q: ath10k driver not working, hence wifi adoptor QCA6164 not recognised no additional drivers found except processor microcode firmware for Intel CPU under additional drivers,software and updates,settings. Hence i am not able to update the ath10k driver through settings. is there any way to update ath10k through terminal? and if updating doesn't work what should i do to make Ubuntu 16.04 recognize the WIFI adopter?\n\nA: Follow the procedure from there: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1436940\nand it will work\nAs a summary, and assuming you are on version 16.04, open a terminal:\n 1. sudo rm -r /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/\n 2. cd /tmp ; wget https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/archive/master.zip\n 3. unzip master.zip ; sudo cp -r ath10k-firmware-master/QCA6174/ /lib/firmware/ath10k/\n 4. cd /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/ ; sudo mv firmware-5.bin_SW_RM.1.1.1-00157-QCARMSWPZ-1 firmware-5.bin\n 5. cd /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/ ; sudo mv\n    firmware-4.bin_WLAN.RM.2.0-00180-QCARMSWPZ-1 firmware-4.bin\n 6. sudo reboot\n\n", "Q: Unable to downgrade Binutils package The Problem\nI'm currently on 16.04 LTS. binutils package of this distro is of version 2.26. But I need 2.25 (binutils of 15.10).\nI'm using PyBDF 0.1.1 python packages which depends on binutils 2.25. Unfortunately that python package isn't getting updated, so I have to downgrade my binutils.\nWhat I've done with no luck:\n\n*\n\n*apt-get install binutils=2.25.1-6ubuntu1\n\n*\"Force Version\" is disabled in Synaptic Package Manager.\n\n*Fooling PyBDF by creating a soft link for the .SO file that ships with binutils 2.25 which points to the .SO file of binutils 2.26.\n\nRelated Questions\n\n*\n\n*PyBFD cannot find Binutils in 16.04\nThe Question\nHow can I downgrade the package?\n\nA: You can add the Wily repositories to your sources.list and use Apt preferences as described here. That question is about upgrading a package, but the exact same idea applies for downgrades. However you will need to initially install the Wily version manually (or give it a priority over 1000) to force the downgrade. After the downgrade is done, a priority of 501 on the Wily package will be enough.\nNote that since binutils contains many important system tools, it would not be surprising if the downgrade caused your system to function incorrectly. In that case you should install a full Wily system.\n", "Q: Could not install GNU Octave I am getting below error while installing ocatve.\nCommand I run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install octave\n\nError:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n\noctave: Depends: libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1) but 1:4.9.3-0ubuntu4 is to be installed\n        Depends: libglpk36 (>= 4.51) but 4.52.1-2build1 is to be installed\n        Depends: liboctave2 (= 3.8.1-1ubuntu1) but 3.8.1-1ubuntu1 is to be installed\n        Depends: libqt4-network (>= 4:4.5.3) but 4:4.8.5+git192-g085f851+dfsg-2ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\n        Depends: libqtcore4 (>= 4:4.7.0~beta1) but 4:4.8.5+git192-g085f851+dfsg-2ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\n        Depends: libqtgui4 (>= 4:4.8.0) but 4:4.8.5+git192-g085f851+dfsg-2ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\n        Depends: libstdc++6 (>= 4.6) but 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.1 is to be installed\n        Depends: octave-common (= 3.8.1-1ubuntu1) but 3.8.1-1ubuntu1 is to be installed\n\nI have already tried solution at this post but it did not worked for me.\nI am naive to ubuntu and clueless what should I try next.\n\nEDIT\n\nCommand 1 : sudo apt-get install octave\nReading package lists...

The accepted answer in the post you linked to yourself has very good information there on how to do that, and particularly what to not do.\nWhen installing software in Ubuntu, a user should always try the easiest solution first: search in the package repositories with \n$ apt search octave in this case. You will see that there are a lot of related packages. Of course you are curious about whether this will be up-to-date enough for your purposes, so you use $ apt show octave which returns:\nPackage: octave\nVersion: 4.0.0-3ubuntu9     <-- The important part, v4.0.0 is pretty new, you get the gui\nPriority: extra\nSection: universe/math\nOrigin: Ubuntu\nMaintainer: Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com>\nOriginal-Maintainer: Debian Octave Group <pkg-octave-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>\nBugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug\nInstalled-Size: 4,817 kB\nDepends: (blah blah blah)\nSuggests: octave-info, octave-doc, octave-htmldoc\nConflicts: octave-java\nBreaks: (blah blah blah)\nReplaces: octave-java\nHomepage: http://www.octave.org/\nDownload-Size: 1,474 kB\nAPT-Manual-Installed: yes\nAPT-Sources: http://mirror.its.sfu.ca/mirror/ubuntu xenial/universe amd64 Packages\nDescription: GNU Octave language for numerical computations\n Octave is a (mostly Matlab (R) compatible) high-level language, primarily\n intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command-line\n interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.\n .\n Octave can be dynamically extended with user-supplied C++ files.\n\nSo, with a v4 Octave available in the repositories, it's pretty reasonable to use a simple $ sudo apt install octave and let the Ubuntu/Debian packaging community solve all the hard problems for you.\n\nRegarding uninstallation, searching through the files in octave-3.8.0/, namely README and INSTALL, there are some helpful tips:\nBasic Installation\n==================\n\n(blah blah blah)\n\n 7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed\n     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that\n     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the\n     GNU Coding Standards.\n\nAfter running $ make uninstall or $ sudo make uninstall (which will be necessary if you used sudo to install the compiled program before), you should be good to try and get your package state in good order with:\n$ sudo apt autoremove\n$ sudo apt install -f\n$ sudo dpkg --configure -a\n$ sudo ldconfig\n\nThese above commands are safe to use, and helpful for correcting weird state of your package installs. After that, for installing octave, go with:\n$ sudo apt update\n$ sudo apt upgrade\n$ sudo apt install octave\n\n", "Q: FFMPEG installed but not found I'm trying to install pHash , but when I execute ./configure this message is returned:\n...\n\n*** Configuring video Hash ***\n\nchecking whether FFmpeg is present... checking for avcodec_alloc_frame in -lavcodec... no\nconfigure: error: \n\n*** libavcodec not found.\nYou need FFmpeg.

Specifically what you are missing here is the libavcodec-dev package. Install it as usual with apt and then run ./configure again. You will likely bump into another error saying you are missing another library.

On Ubuntu 16.04 syndaemon isn't working I want to deactivate the touch-pad while typing.\nI tried this:\nsyndaemon -i 1 -d -t -K\n\nIt should deactivate tapping and scrolling on the touchpad for 1 second and ignore modifier+keys combos but after setting syndaemon like described nothing is changed. The touchpad is always active and it’s very annoying.\nI’m using Ubuntu 16.04 on a Dell Precision 5510.\n\nA: You may have two touchpad drivers running, where syndaemon would then interact with the wrong one. I had the same issue on a Dell XPS 13, and this thread (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2316240) helped me.\nIf you also see two touchpad devices, try to disable one. As you have a different computer, the instructions in the link may or may not be literally applicable for you.\nFrom the post referred to, the procedure is:\nopen the file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/51-synaptics-quirks.conf as root with your text editor\nInsert the following text:\n# Disable generic Synaptics device, as we're using\n# \"DLL0704:01 06CB:76AE Touchpad\"\n# Having multiple touchpad devices running confuses syndaemon\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifier \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\"\n      MatchProduct \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\"\n      MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n      MatchOS \"Linux\"\n      MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n      Option \"Ignore\" \"on\"\nEndSection\n\nEither reboot or restart Xorg with the command sudo systemctl restart lightdm\nCredit goes to ddarling from ubuntuforums.org.\nSince january 2018, Dell has an official page in its Knowledge Base on Ubuntu Touchpad/Mouse Issues. The page describes this fix to disable the \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\", and also suggests to move to libinput rather than synaptics as the mousepad driver.\n\nA: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/atareao\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install touchpad-indicator\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open touch pad indicator and click on the indicator icon.\n\n*You can change preferences (in action tab) to \"disable touch pad on typing\"\n\n\nCheers!\n\nA: After looking at options for 'xinput', I found an effective and easy solution to disable the Synaptics touchpad using Ubuntu 16.04 and Lubuntu 16.04\nIn a terminal window, give yourself administrative access by entering 'sudo -s' and putting in your password.\nUsing your favorite editor, such as leafpad or gedit, create a new script file:\nleafpad /usr/local/bin/tpadoff\n\nand insert the following:\n#!/bin/bash\n#/usr/local/bin/tpadoff - turn off touchpad\nxinput --disable  'SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad'\n\nSave the file and exit the editor. Then enter the command:\nchmod 755 /usr/local/bin/tpadoff\n\nto make the file executable. You can repeat to create a tpadon file, just change the '--disable' to '--enable'.\nWhen done, 'exit' the terminal window to disable the administrator access.\nDesktop entries can be created by opening a new terminal window and use your favorite editor (in this example, I am using leafpad again):\ncd Desktop\nleafpad tpadoff.desktop\n\nand insert the following text:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=TouchPad Off\nComment=Turn-Off Touchpad\nExec=/usr/local/bin/tpadoff\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nSave the file and exit the editor.  Then enter the following command:\n chmod 775 tpadoff.desktop \n\nYou can also repeat to create a tpadon.desktop, changing all 'off' references to 'on'.\nWhen complete, you will have two ways to turn-off (and optionally turn-on) the touchpad by double-clicking a desktop icon or entering 'tpadoff' in a terminal window.\nIf your touchpad is different, you may have to use 'xinput' in a terminal windows to find the exact syntax for your touchpad. Then edit the '/usr/local/bin/tpadoff' file to match what xinput reported.\n\nA: After months of searching for a solution, I decided to write a simple Python program to disable the touchpad while typing. Adding the program to Startup Applications to make it runs every time you start your computer.\nYou need to run xinput list to determine the id of your keyboard, in my case it is 17.\nxinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Microsoft Microsoft® Nano Transceiver v1.0    id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Microsoft Microsoft® Nano Transceiver v1.0    id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ DLL082A:01 06CB:76AF Touchpad             id=14   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=18   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Microsoft Microsoft® Nano Transceiver v1.0    id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Integrated_Webcam_HD                      id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Intel Virtual Button driver               id=15   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Intel HID events                          id=16   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    **↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard                id=17   [slave  keyboard (3)]**\n    ↳ Dell WMI hotkeys                          id=19   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Microsoft Microsoft® Nano Transceiver v1.0    id=20   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nHere is the program\nimport time \nimport subprocess\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    subprocess.call('gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad tap-to-click true', shell=True)\n    p = subprocess.Popen('xinput test 17', shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n    clickTime = [0, 0]\n    def checkTime():\n        keys = [37, 50, 62, 64, 105, 108, 133]\n        while True:\n            out = p.stdout.readline()\n\n            if len(out) < 1:\n                break\n            key = int(out.split()[-1])\n            if key not in keys:\n                clickTime[0] = time.time()\n\n    t = threading.Thread(target=checkTime)\n    t.start()\n\n    lastTime = 0\n    touchpad = True\n    while True:\n        inactive = time.time() - clickTime[0]\n        # print ('inactive for', inactive)\n        if inactive > 1:            \n            if not touchpad:\n                print ('Enable touchpad')\n                subprocess.call('gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad tap-to-click true', shell=True)\n            touchpad = True\n        else:\n            if touchpad:\n                print ('Disable touchpad')\n                subprocess.call('gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad tap-to-click false', shell=True)\n            touchpad = False\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n\n    retval = p.wait()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n\nA: i am using ubuntu 17.10 and tried different solution suggested here mostly does not work. specially touchpad-indicator software when starts in ubuntu 17.10 just disable touchpad and I could not find any way to re-enable it without restarting laptop.\nnow I found this solution I think which still now working pretty well:\njust use this command,\n\nsynclient PalmDetect=1\n\nThis will at least prevent unnecessary tapping of palm on touchpad which in the end gives a better life.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 19.04, I found it was adequate (for my needs) to simply disable the \"Tap to Click\" feature:\n\nHowever, the consequence of this, is that you'll actually have to use the touchpad's buttons (hopefully you have buttons) to do your clicking. For me, that's a fair trade-off.\nIf you don't actual have \"left and right\" click-buttons (separated from your touch-pad) you can instead calibrate the sensitivity of your touchpad. I learned about this from Peter Hutterer, in this bug report.\nI wish Laptop manufacturers, didn't make laptops with non-receded touchpads. These touchpads that are level with the keyboard's keys (instead of receded) are a design flaw.\nPlease let your laptop manufactures know the trouble they've caused you by this bad design, else they'll blindly keep doing this in future models.\n\nA: For the Kubuntu users...\nOn Kubuntu 16.04 - to disable the touchpad while typing I had to clear the checkbox called \"Disable taps and scrolling only\" under settings->input devices-> touchpad-> Enable/disable touchpad.

I'm pretty new in managing space in Ubuntu.\nI attached the screenshot of system monitor from my PC.\nWhat does /dev/sda1 is related to ? I see the space alloted to it by default is very less. Is there a way I can increase the space for that partition to avoid any problems in future?\n\n\nA: /dev/sda1 is your boot partition, you don't have to increase it. Your main partition is /dev/mapper/... and that's lots of space, but in case you need more space you can another HDD and increase the size of it using LVM since you have it enabled.\n\nA: As mentioned, /dev/sda1 is your boot partition, the primary partition that contains the boot loader.\nTo increase space in boot you need to shrink another partition and free space. Use gparted tool on the live cd to do this but please, always backup your data. On gparted decrease the size of / and then increase the size of boot. Try following this guide: How to resize partitions?\nAlternatively, you can free space on /boot following this guide here: \nHow do I free up more space in /boot?\n", "Q: PHP mysqli extension in Ubuntu 16.04 not working after upgrade to version 7.0.6 After update this morning php does not work any more.

As Android is gaining more and more users every day (and Windows losing some), i consider reasonably fair for me to ask: Is there ANY Wine equivalent for Android apps?  I'm not asking for native linux support for apk packages, just for a non-emulator like Wine is.\nTouch-interface hardware is getting cheaper every day, and Android being king there, is just natural that all programmers keep on rushing into making Android apps. In the last year alone i've seen most famous software getting implemented in Android: Photoshop, Autocad, Revit, Pixlr, etc  \nI'm not an Android developer, not looking for an android-sdk, just regular user looking to use certain android apps in Ubuntu. Typical example: Autocad and Photoshop - neither one working properly under wine, but having Android variants. I'm hoping that Android being linux, it could be more easy to adapt Android to Ubuntu code, than adapting Windows to Ubuntu code.\n\nA: EDIT December 29, 2018\nI found something named anbox. From their github : \n\nAnbox is a container-based approach to boot a full Android system on a\n  regular GNU/Linux system like Ubuntu. In other words: Anbox will let\n  you run Android on your Linux system without the slowness of\n  virtualization.\nAnbox uses Linux namespaces (user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc) to run a\n  full Android system in a container and provide Android applications on\n  any GNU/Linux-based platform.\nThe Android inside the container has no direct access to any hardware.\n  All hardware access is going through the anbox daemon on the host.\n  We're reusing what Android implemented within the QEMU-based emulator\n  for OpenGL ES accelerated rendering. The Android system inside the\n  container uses different pipes to communicate with the host system and\n  sends all hardware access commands through these.\n\nThis is interesting. But I haven't tested it yet, but some articles on the net refers to that. You guys may want to take a look. Meanwhile, I'll update this answer later when I've tried them. \n=============================================================\nOriginal answer below.\nYou can either : \n\n\n*\n\n*Run ARChon Runtime for Chrome. It is an android runtime, made for Google Chrome.  More info Click here. (You will need to convert APK to archon package with android phone. Also not all apps are compatible. I guarantee a headache, Prepare your paracetamol.) \n\n*Run android-x86 in a VirtualBox or similar. More information Here. You may hit performance issues because emulated GPU anyway. \n\n*Use Genymotion. More information here.  Basicly something like BlueStacks, but also have multiple device support and most importantly, supports ubuntu. (I can't comment for performance, but in windows, it is great! Also it supports multi touch screens - again on Windows. can't comment on ubuntu.)\n\n\nFor exactly like wine, where you aren't emulating the whole OS, I think ARChon is the most accurate answer. But I'm pretty sure you will hit too much issues and probably just give up like me. \nWe all know Android is based on Linux kernel. But that doesn't mean that's the same thing. Android doesn't use X server like your desktop. \nSo AFAIK, there are no solution so far. Sorry.  \n\nA: The simplest method involves using Genymotion.\nIt is one of several Android emulators that you can install in Linux. When compared to other emulators\nBefore, you install Genymotion, you have to first install Oracle’s VirtualBox. VirtualBox is virtualization software that creates the virtual environment necessary to emulate Android in Linux. To install VirtualBox, download it from Oracle.\nNext, create an account at the Genymotion website and install the application. The application comes as a .debi file so simply double click it to begin installation.\nHere's the video in detail.. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/MHmMDEzsJEY\n\ncopied from : https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-install-Bluestacks-in-Ubuntu\n\nBlockquote\n\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu require us to register an account on Ubuntu website to be able to install a Snap package? Today I wanted to install a Snap Package on Ubuntu Xenial, but it prompted me to register an account on Ubuntu Single Sign-On.\nWhy does Ubuntu ask us for such a thing?\nInstalling a Snap Package:\n\nThis is the reported bug on Launchpad, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-center/+bug/1581713\n\nA: This behavior is consistent with Ubuntu Software Centre. Canonical works with third-party software providers to provide payment and hosting for commericial software in the partner repository. In Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, this is being replaced by the Ubuntu App Store which powers the snap repository's backend.\nWhile the command line tools provide access to free-of-charge snaps without issue, the Ubuntu Software store uses Ubuntu One to handle payment processing and order history (so that previous purchases can be downloaded and installed on any number of systems that you own).\nSo this is an implementation detail that matches the behavior of the software being replaced by Ubuntu Software.\n\nA: There is a technical reason and a design reason for the current behaviour.\nFirstly, snapd requires some form of authentication since it is performing a system-level operation. On the command line you can use sudo, just like when you apt install, so no online account required. When using Software, the only form of authentication currently available is the Snap store. Alternatives are being discussed...\n\nI did an attempt to resolve this by trying to get snapd to generate a Macaroon without store access. But as I understand it getting a Macaroon requires a round trip to the store.\nSo I think the solution to this is to either allow snapd to generate local Macaroons or use some other type of authentication token for local access. (comment 27)\n\nSecondly, SSO authentication was the primary design pattern because Snappy's primary use-case is managing multiple IoT devices. The negative effect on desktop/laptop users was unplanned.\n\nThe net effect is much better security for these devices... look at modern wifi access points, for example. You get a single management\n  account, usually in the cloud, and you manage all devices through that. (comment 25)\n\nIt looks like there is a plan to change the behaviour so that desktop/laptop users aren't required to use an online account to authenticate. You can subscribe to the bug to receive news as changes are made.\n\nHanding out a token to root that provides an authorization to manipulate the system is analogous to allowing root itself to be doing removals without further store information, which we allow... The necessary infrastructure for that is pretty much in place since we already have to maintain the local and remote macaroons separately, and the situation where the remote macaroon is missing or incorrect is already handled. (comment 29)\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to whitlist ip's and block everything else So i'm running ubuntu on my vps. But the problem is that i have kids trying to figure out the password of the FTP connection and the VNC connection. (with succes).\nNow i want to ask is there a way to disable ALL INCOMING connections except my ip and my friends ip?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: \nAllow by specific port and IP address\nsudo ufw allow from <target> to <destination> port <port number>\n\n\nI got this from the UFW help page.\nYou also need to block connections first and then allow a specific one.\n\nA: I think the server firewall will sufficiently do this job but it's pretty risky:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/firewall.html\nThe problem is, if you block all traffic except from your IP address, what happens if your IP address changes? You're locked out from your machine. If you know you have 2 routes into the server both with static IP addresses, you should be fine, but use this with caution and be aware that the only solution might involve reformatting the machine and losing all data should you lock yourself out.\nIt's probably possible using the firewall to only permit traffic through certain ports in certain ways, so you could (for instance) set your SSH port to something completely non standard, and leave that port open to any IP (this will give you a fallback if you lock yourself out). Port scanners will find the open port, but if the people gaining access aren't skilled as per your implication, it will stop them.\n", "Q: How to create a UEFI Ubuntu flash drive I have windows 10 on my PC after switching from Ubuntu MATE but I realized that windows 10 is only good for programming in java and that's it.

to Boot My Ubuntu installation has decided not to work anymore. I suspect it's something graphical or to do with memory. Read on for more.\nBackground.\nI installed Ununtu 14.04 on my laptop a few months ago and have had no problems whatsoever with it up until a few days ago. I had closed the laptop temporarily and it went into Sleep Mode. Then when I opened it again, it awakened. Cool. However, the screen remained completely blank except for when I moved the mouse or pressed a key on the keyboard, which briefly flashed my desktop wallpaper. After rollong my eyes and cursing the previous fifty years of software development, I performed a hard reset, got to GRUB2 and proceeded with loading Ubuntu. Now the boot process stalls shortly after the GRUB screen and I am left with a blank screen and a blinking cursor. \nAttempts at Recovery.\n\n\n*\n\n*Loaded \"Ubuntu with Linux [latest version available on laptop] (Recovery Mode)\" and performed all available tasks. Interesting note: I cannot use the \"failsafeX\" option; selecting this option fails to load Ubuntu with limited graphics. It attempts do so, but fails and reverts back to the Recovery screen. \n\n*Tried to reinstall Ubuntu with the same USB drive I used to install it in the first place. I can get to the first menu, but when I select \"Install Ubuntu\", it quickly crashes with the last line ending \"VFS: failed to mount root fs in unknown block [2, 0]\". This happens every time.\n\n*In Boot Command list, removed \"quiet splash\" and replaced in with \"nomodeset\" because several people in different treads suggested this, without giving an explanation as to why it should be done. So naturally, I gave it a go. It didn't make any difference as far as I could tell.\nSummary.\n\n\n*\n\n*Laptop: Lenovo T410, had Windows 7 previously installed (still exists on a separate partition), Intel CORE vPRO i5, 4ĢB RAM, Intel Graphics.\n\n*Laptop was running fine, sent it to sleep, woke it up, couldn't log in/do anything. Rebooted it.\n\n*Booted to GRUB screen, selected Ubuntu. \n\n*Ubuntu fails to load. I get a flash of \"Loading initial ramdisk\" before I get the blank screen with the blinking cursor.\n\n*Tried a few things. None worked.\n\n*Stumped. Came online for help.\nIf anyone can shed any light over what's going on here, I would be very grateful. \nEDIT:\nResponses.\ndadexix86. \n1. I have never manually performed a filesystem check. \n\n\n*Ubuntu does not boot with an older version of Linux. I get the same result, every time.\n\n*I did not suspend it after an update. I was not running any \"exotic\" processes. By exotic I mean system-critical, or otherwise important to the running of the system-, processes.\n\n*I have no external repositories or software. \n\n*Thanks for getting back me.\nanonymous2.\n1. I can still boot to Windows.\n\n\n*I have not performed a memtest. I will do so now and report back. | Memroy check completed, no errors.\n\n*Thanks for getting back to me.\nAndroid Dev.\n1. No problem, homie.\nComputerGuy.\n1. I don't have Nvidia graphics. \n\n\n*I will try your suggestion and report back. | OK, I tried resetting Unity and it returned \"WARNING: no DISPLAY variable set, setting it to: 0\" and \"ERROR: the reset option is now deprecated.\" So I don't know if that worked. I tried reinstalling LightDM, but I need network connectivity to do that, and I'm not able to enable this. I'm currently looking into that. \n\n\nThanks for the help so far, folks.\n\nA: This happened to a computer I worked on. Try resetting Unity  configuration and resetting LightDM configuration. Sometimes, an NVIdia driver can mess things up, too.\n\n\n*\n\n*On Grub, choose Advanced options for Ubuntu.  \n\n*Choose the lowest version of Linux you can find with recovery mode. This is very important.  \n\n*On the new menu that apears choose Drop to shell prompt.  \n\n*Type sudo unity --reset  \n\n*Type sudo apt-get remove nvidia-*  \n\n*Type sudo apt-get install --reinstall lightdm  \n\n*Type sudo reboot\nNow, if it was the same as mine, it should be able to boot now. If it gives you an error, let me know, as I'm very willing to help.\n", "Q: OpenOffice launcher icon name is \"untitled 1 - OpenOffice Writer\" I locked the icon to the launcher while Writer was running, and ever since it has been called \"untitled 1 -OpenOffice Writer\". \nI think this is going to confuse me when working with several documents. Is there any way to change it to either OpenOffice or OpenOffice Writer?\n\nA: Absolutely.\nSomehow a local .desktop file of must have been created, with a weird naming. The local one will overrule the global one as long as it exists.\nHow to solve\n\n*\n\n*Unlock the current Openoffice-Writer -launcher (icon) from the Unity-Launcher\n\n\n*Remove the local copy of the launcher: Navigate to ~/.local/share/applications (~ stands for your home- directory, .local is a directory in your home directory, hidden by default. To make it visible: in nautilus, press Ctrl+H to make it visible). Remove any reference to OpenOfficeWriter.\n\n\n*Log out/in, open Dash, type \"writer\" and drag the icon from Dash on to the launcher.\nThat should solve it.\n", "Q: Which is the \"correct\"/\"official\" kernel version? (server vs cloud-img installs) I recently used official images to install bare metal servers and VMs (using a cloud image) and found out they install quite different kernels out of the box:\n\n\n*\n\n*14.04.4 server iso (from here) installs \"Wily\" kernel 4.2\n\n*14.04.4 cloud-image (from here, \"daily\" build 20160512) installs original \"Trusty\" kernel 3.13\n\n\nI understand that both are supported as of 14.04.4 (which is great!) and that I can upgrade them but this still begs a couple of questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which should be installed by default?\n\n*Should it be different for the baremetal ISO vs the cloud image?\n\n\nI ran into this because I'm trying to simulate a baremetal environment with VMs for testing purposes and assumed that images listed above would yield a reasonably similar environment...\n(note: although this q relates to 14.04.4, I suppose the question might apply to future point releases, eg: 16.04.x later)\n\nA: I hope this link will help you: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack\n", "Q: How to re-size hard drive partitions I am struggling to divide my hard drive into two or more partitions. Evidently, I made a mistake when installing Ubuntu and now I have only one disk which takes the the whole space. I tried to use GParted but it could only make it 48 Mb less. Is there a way to correct it? Also, why are there two disks with the size of my whole drive? \n\nA: You won't be able to edit your filesystem from a local boot - you'll have to use livecd if this is root hdd, which it appears to be.\nThe reason that there are 2 partitions of the same size is because sda2 is the root partition for sda5.  In other words, just as sda1 and sda2 are subpartions of sda, sda5 is a subpartition of sda2.  sda2 contains sda5.\n\nA: You can't resize a partition while it's mounted. You have to unmount it first. One simple way to do that is to boot from a live USB and use a tool like GParted to resize your partitions.\nThe arrow at the left suggests that sda5 is a child partition of sda2. think of it as a folder inside a folder.\n", "Q: How do I reinstall old Mahjong?

It works just like any other Android except it has two USB ports and connects via HDMI to a display (see above link). It doesn't have volume rockers to get to the recovery menu but it can still go to the recovery menu if you hold down F2 on boot. Due to the fact that it doesn't have a touch screen, I just want to install the normal PC version of Ubuntu from my bootable USB Flash drive. Does anyone know of a possible way to boot from the USB drive? If so, is there a specific way I need to install Ubuntu? Could I get extra drivers, and if so, how many might I need to get everything working (HDMI, Sound, Wifi, Bluetooth, ect.)? And lastly, if I had to install Ubuntu touch, could I still get the same apps and Unity like the desktop version? The system only has 16 gigabytes of space, so I'm still wondering if it would be worth it. Thanks!\n\nA: Seems you cannot install Ubuntu Desktop because the processor is based on ARM architecture and Ubuntu Desktop is meant for x86 processors.\nYou should probably try to install the Ubuntu ARM version meant for Raspberry Pi. Please refer this wiki for the process. \nBasically, it seems to give you the server edition and then you can install packages that give you the Desktop Environment. See the extract below from the wiki.\n\nThis is a small ubuntu-server image. If you want a full desktop, go ahead and do so:\n$ sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop  # or\n$ sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop  # or\n$ sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop  # etc\n\nUbuntu (Unity) and Ubuntu-GNOME just display a blank screen, presumably because they require 3D compositing. Kubuntu works but is slow unless you turn off desktop effects under System Settings. Xubuntu and Lubuntu work fine out of the box.\n", "Q: How to get back lost \"Root CA certificates\" & \"Gnome 2 Key storage\" after accidentally deleting file? On 16.04 and using GNOME Shell not Unity, I wanted to import a *.pem for a custom root cert, but as the \"Passwords & Keys\" (seahorse) app said I had to unlock a locked keyring to which I could not remember the password (perhaps after the last update, or due to the change of shell?).\nFollowing How to recover/reset forgotten Gnome Keyring Password? I have removed rm ~/.local/share/keyrings/login.keyring (which was the right thing to do?) and as that didn't work, it still asked for a password to unlock the keyring (did I just forget to logout/login?), I've then also removed rm ~/.local/share/keyrings/user.keystore (was that dumb?).\nBut now the Import button is greyed out when I try to import the *.pem, saying \"Cannot import because there are no compatible importers\" in a hover.\nAnd in my \"Passwords & Keys\" the \"Root CA certificates\" & \"Gnome 2 Key storage\", visible e.g. here How migrate my keyring (containing ssh passprases, nautilus remote filesystem, pgp passwords) and network manager connections?, are gone:\n\nHow do I get them back, so that I can import that *.pem?\n\nA: I had the same issue after updating to 16.04\nAfter removing the file ~/.local/share/keyrings/user.keystore the Gnome2 Key Storage that had an unknown password on it was no longer available. I had a hard time getting it to recreate itself as many people suggested would happen.\nThis morning I verified that the file was missing and the ability to import keys was non functional. I rebooted the computer and the Gnome2 Key Storage has rebuilt itself.\nWhile in \"Passwords & Keys\" I clicked on the unlock button and presented with the password prompt that has been having issues. I entered my logon password and it presented me with a failed message. After closing out the window I noticed that the folder was now unlocked. I imported a key, locked the folder, and the unlocked it on the first try with my logon password.\nI’m running 16.04 with full disk encryption.

Can it be done by systemback ? If yes, please give me full details . thanks.\n\nA: you don't need to make an iso to install the same packages.\nyou can list your packages and install them on the laptop after you installed ubuntu.\nsee third answer on:\nHow to list all installed packages\ni guess you can try using systemback to create an iso of your system but you will still need to install ubuntu and systemback to restore. i have no idea if that will work, interested to see if its possible without too many errors/problems.\nhttp://www.unixmen.com/systemback-restore-linux-system-previous-state/\n\nA: This tool is maybe helps you: http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: Remastersys can help you make custom iso files\nhttp://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/remastersys.html\n\nA: From the answers above, I thought I would condense them into one, without using links (hmph). First, you can use APTonCD. This is an Ubuntu based software that you can install. With this software you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup\n\n*Transport\n\n*Download\n\n*And share what you backup\n\n\nThe link above will have the download link, but else do the following in terminal after downloading the tar.gz:\n$ tar -xvzf /path/to/download/aptoncd-*.tar.gz\n$ cd aptoncd/\n$ sudo make install\n\nThe next is Remastersys.\nBy default, Remastersys is not listed in the official Ubuntu repositories. We need add it. To add a source, click System > Administration > Software Sources. This will bring up a menu of all currently used sources that Synaptic (the package manager) refers to when searching for new installations and updates. Click on the Third-Party Software tab for more details.\nNext, click Add. This will open another window, where you need to input the new source address. The address that we require is:\ndeb http://www.remastersys.klikit-linux.com/repository remastersys/\n\nRemastersys add sources 2\nAfter you have added the new repository, power up Synaptic, look for Remastersys and install it. Now, start Remastersys. The GUI can be accessed via System > Administration > Remastersys Backup. You have several options to choose from:\n\nBackup allows you to backup your entire installation, along with all the personal data and configurations.\n\nNext is Dist\n\nDist allows you to create a backup, sans your personal data, allowing you to share the \"remastered\" copy with other people.\n\nNext is Modify\n\nModify is useful for configuring the name and the location of the backup file, as well as some other settings. You can also manually edit and change the configurations file - /etc/remastersys.conf. It is advisable to backup the file before making any changes.\n\nFinally is clean\n\nClean is useful only after you have used Remastersys at least once. This function will remove previous builds made by the program and free up the hard disk space. You can also do this manually if you wish. It is always a good idea to run the Clean option before running a new backup.\n\nWe will begin with editing the options, perform a cleanup second and then run the backup. If you're using the software the first time, the cleanup is not necessary. However, you should revise the backup options. This is not strictly necessary, but might be important if you are low on disk space.\ndo a  Clean. This should take a few moments. Then do a Backup. Now comes the really interesting part. Please note that you must close all windows and unmount network shares while running the utility. The GUI will even throw up a warning to inform you about this. If you do not do this, it is possible that your backup could fail. Once you have unmounted network shares and closed all windows, click OK to proceed. The backup will begin. Depending on the size of your distro, this could take some time.After the backup is done, you should burn the created image file (ISO) and test it. Indeed, this is our next step. Then, boot your custom iso in virtualbox. Notice the splash screen is different from the typical Ubuntu logo. Furthermore, notice the surrounding window frame, which belongs to VirtualBox. Indeed, as advised by the backup GUI, we're testing the custom.iso file in a virtual machine, to ensure that it works as desired, and it does. Remastersys is a very handsome application. In a way, it is an on-the-fly imaging software. But it also allows you to boot your image as a live CD, reinstall it on another machine - or give it out to friends (if you have any), as a ready-to-use Linux, with every little hack and trick you like already implemented. Remastersys is powerful - and simple. There's no need to mess up with the command line or figure out what partitions you want to backup and whether they are mounted or not. For most people, the use of Remastersys will be a simple affair, just a few mouse clicks and you're done.\n", "Q: system(\"pause\") for Linux g++ C++ In windows when compiling, system(\"pause\")  works, what is the equivalent in linux?\n\nA: The following works on windows and linux/unix:\nstd::cout << \"Press \\'Return\\' to end.\" << std::endl;\nstd::cin.flush();\nstd::cin.get();\n\nThe first std::cin.flush() clears the input que, the next command waits for an input.\n", "Q: GPG error: http://archive.cronical.com trusty InRelease: Clearsigned file isn valid, got 'NoDATA' I'm getting this error when I try to update ubuntu 14.04:\nGPG error: http://archive.cronical.com trusty InRelease: Clearsigned file isn't valid, got 'NODATA' (does the network require authentication?)\n\nI found out it is due to the Internet connection, but I can't find how to fix it.

Simply purge the package and re-install it:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge ttf-mscorefonts-installer\nsudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n\nA screen will appear, where you will have to accept the license agreement. Then the fonts will be downloaded and installed one by one. \n\nA: Hi all I was trying to install ttf_mscorefonts_installer from synaptic manager,but mine was not working. But i downloaded latest version of ubuntu16.04.2 desktop version and tried to install it.Now it is working for me.I will recommend you to install synaptic manager and install from it.\n\nA: I always install the package ttf-mscorefonts-installer described here via Synaptic Package manager, or via terminal run these commands: \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer\nand the fonts (Andale Mono, Arial Black, Arial (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic), Comic Sans MS (Bold), Courier New (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic), Georgia (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic), Impact, Times New Roman (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic), Trebuchet (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic), Verdana (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic), Webdings) are automatically available to use in LibreOffice. \n", "Q: How to Install standalone Ubuntu while keeping Windows?

To start with, this question isn't really a problem I have but rather a \"why is it like this\". I'm trying to return to Linux after several years in the Windows world, but I have lost so much... So here's to learning anew. :)\nI have a Windows 10 x64 machine acting as file server in my network. I access the shares from Ubuntu Mate 16.04. Main file browser is Caja.\nHere's the good part:\nWhen I browse the network shares on my network and start to copy a file, max speed is around 600 Mbit. But when I mount the share permanently in Fstab with CIFS (according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountWindowsSharesPermanently) I can utilize my full link speed (1 Gbit). I can utilize the full link speed when using smbclient via Terminal as well.\nCan anyone explain to me why this is the case with Caja (and Nautilus from what I can tell) and perhaps give me some links where I can read more about it? Aren't CIFS and SMB basically the same thing?\nThanks!\nUpdate: I'm using an Intel I217-V (rev 04) NIC.\n\nA: SMB is a server Message Block which was invented by IBM to write files across a LAN network. CIFS is a Common Internet File System. CIFS is particular implementation of SMB done by Microsoft. \n1.) The CIFS implementation of SMB is rarely used these days. Most modern storage systems no longer use CIFS, they use SMB 2 or SMB 3. In the Windows world, SMB 2 has been the standard as of Windows Vista (2006) and SMB 3 is part of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.\n2.) SMB 2 and SMB 3 are massive upgrades over the CIFS implementation.\nNow something to keep in mind (TCP window size * 8bits / RTT in milliseconds) = Max TCP throughput in bps. While you might have a Gigabit network a single TCP flow won't likely be able to get that high.\nNow to optimize SMB config: \n[global]\n\nSEE: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=798532\nstrict allocate = Yes\n\nSEE: https://lists.samba.org/archive/samba-technical/2014-July/101304.html\nallocation roundup size = 4096\n\nAllow reado of 65535 bytes in one packet\nread raw = Yes\nServer signing slows things down. \nserver signing = No\n\nSupport RAW write. \nwrite raw = Yes\n\n\"strict locking = auto\" OR \"strict locking = no\" is acceptible.\nstrict locking = No\n\nsocket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY SO_RCVBUF=131072 SO_SNDBUF=131072\n\"min receivefile size\" will be passed directly to the kernel,      recvfile/splice SYSTEM CALL.\nmin receivefile size = 16384\n\nUse more efficient sendfile()system call \nuse sendfile = Yes\n\nSamba musty be built with Asynchronous file support I/O support \naio read size = 16384\naio write size = 16384\n\nAlso in my case i needed to change the order of the name lookups in nsswitch.conf.

How can I install any module in Ubuntu 16.04 without signing or without editing any kernel configurations. Is it possible? Any help will be appreciated.\n\nA: You either disable secure boot or sign the kernel module.\nPersonally, I disable secure boot in the bios.\nSee https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/SecureBoot\nOr to manually sign the kernel module see \nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/module-signing.txt\n\n      ==============================          KERNEL MODULE SIGNING FACILITY\n      ==============================\n\nCONTENTS\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Overview.\n  \n*Configuring module signing.\n  \n*Generating signing keys.\n  \n*Public keys in the kernel.\n  \n*Manually signing modules.\n  \n*Signed modules and stripping.\n  \n*Loading signed modules.\n  \n*Non-valid signatures and unsigned modules.\n  \n*Administering/protecting the private key.\n  \n  \n  ======== OVERVIEW\nThe kernel module signing facility cryptographically signs modules\n  during installation and then checks the signature upon loading the\n  module.  This allows increased kernel security by disallowing the\n  loading of unsigned modules or modules signed with an invalid key. \n  Module signing increases security by making it harder to load a\n  malicious module into the kernel.  The module signature checking is\n  done by the kernel so that it is not necessary to have trusted\n  userspace bits.\nThis facility uses X.509 ITU-T standard certificates to encode the\n  public keys involved.  The signatures are not themselves encoded in\n  any industrial standard type.  The facility currently only supports\n  the RSA public key encryption standard (though it is pluggable and\n  permits others to be used).  The possible hash algorithms that can be\n  used are SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 (the algorithm\n  is selected by data in the signature).\n========================== CONFIGURING MODULE SIGNING\nThe module signing facility is enabled by going to the \"Enable\n  Loadable Module Support\" section of the kernel configuration and\n  turning on\nCONFIG_MODULE_SIG   \"Module signature verification\"\nThis has a number of options available:\n(1) \"Require modules to be validly signed\" (CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE)\n This specifies how the kernel should deal with a module that has a\n signature for which the key is not known or a module that is unsigned.\n\n If this is off (ie. \"permissive\"), then modules for which the key is not\n available and modules that are unsigned are permitted, but the kernel will\n be marked as being tainted, and the concerned modules will be marked as\n tainted, shown with the character 'E'.\n\n If this is on (ie. \"restrictive\"), only modules that have a valid\n signature that can be verified by a public key in the kernel's possession\n will be loaded.  All other modules will generate an error.\n\n Irrespective of the setting here, if the module has a signature block that\n cannot be parsed, it will be rejected out of hand.\n\n(2) \"Automatically sign all modules\" (CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL)\n If this is on then modules will be automatically signed during the\n modules_install phase of a build.  If this is off, then the modules must\n be signed manually using:\n\nscripts/sign-file\n(3) \"Which hash algorithm should modules be signed with?\"\n This presents a choice of which hash algorithm the installation phase will\n sign the modules with:\n\nCONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA1      \"Sign modules with SHA-1\"\n    CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA224    \"Sign modules with SHA-224\"\n    CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA256    \"Sign modules with SHA-256\"\n    CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA384    \"Sign modules with SHA-384\"\n    CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA512    \"Sign modules with SHA-512\"\n The algorithm selected here will also be built into the kernel (rather\n than being a module) so that modules signed with that algorithm can have\n their signatures checked without causing a dependency loop.\n\n(4) \"File name or PKCS#11 URI of module signing key\"\n  (CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY)\n Setting this option to something other than its default of\n \"certs/signing_key.pem\" will disable the autogeneration of signing keys\n and allow the kernel modules to be signed with a key of your choosing.\n The string provided should identify a file containing both a private key\n and its corresponding X.509 certificate in PEM form, or — on systems where\n the OpenSSL ENGINE_pkcs11 is functional — a PKCS#11 URI as defined by\n RFC7512. In the latter case, the PKCS#11 URI should reference both a\n certificate and a private key.\n\n If the PEM file containing the private key is encrypted, or if the\n PKCS#11 token requries a PIN, this can be provided at build time by\n means of the KBUILD_SIGN_PIN variable.\n\n(5) \"Additional X.509 keys for default system keyring\"\n  (CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS)\n This option can be set to the filename of a PEM-encoded file containing\n additional certificates which will be included in the system keyring by\n default.\n\nNote that enabling module signing adds a dependency on the OpenSSL\n  devel packages to the kernel build processes for the tool that does\n  the signing.\n======================= GENERATING SIGNING KEYS\nCryptographic keypairs are required to generate and check signatures. \n  A private key is used to generate a signature and the corresponding\n  public key is used to check it.  The private key is only needed during\n  the build, after which it can be deleted or stored securely.  The\n  public key gets built into the kernel so that it can be used to check\n  the signatures as the modules are loaded.\nUnder normal conditions, when CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY is unchanged from\n  its default, the kernel build will automatically generate a new\n  keypair using openssl if one does not exist in the file:\ncerts/signing_key.pem\nduring the building of vmlinux (the public part of the key needs to be\n  built into vmlinux) using parameters in the:\ncerts/x509.genkey\nfile (which is also generated if it does not already exist).\nIt is strongly recommended that you provide your own x509.genkey file.\nMost notably, in the x509.genkey file, the req_distinguished_name\n  section should be altered from the default:\n[ req_distinguished_name ]  #O = Unspecified company    CN = Build time\n  autogenerated kernel key  #emailAddress =\n  unspecified.user@unspecified.company\nThe generated RSA key size can also be set with:\n[ req ]     default_bits = 4096\nIt is also possible to manually generate the key private/public files\n  using the x509.genkey key generation configuration file in the root\n  node of the Linux kernel sources tree and the openssl command.  The\n  following is an example to generate the public/private key files:\nopenssl req -new -nodes -utf8 -sha256 -days 36500 -batch -x509 \\\n       -config x509.genkey -outform PEM -out kernel_key.pem \\\n       -keyout kernel_key.pem\nThe full pathname for the resulting kernel_key.pem file can then be\n  specified in the CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY option, and the certificate and\n  key therein will be used instead of an autogenerated keypair.\n========================= PUBLIC KEYS IN THE KERNEL\nThe kernel contains a ring of public keys that can be viewed by root. \n  They're in a keyring called \".system_keyring\" that can be seen by:\n[root@deneb ~]# cat /proc/keys  ...     223c7853 I------     1 perm\n  1f030000     0     0 keyring   .system_keyring: 1     302d2d52 I------\n  1 perm 1f010000     0     0 asymmetri Fedora kernel signing key:\n  d69a84e6bce3d216b979e9505b3e3ef9a7118079: X509.RSA a7118079 []    ...\nBeyond the public key generated specifically for module signing,\n  additional trusted certificates can be provided in a PEM-encoded file\n  referenced by the CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS configuration option.\nFurther, the architecture code may take public keys from a hardware\n  store and add those in also (e.g. from the UEFI key database).\nFinally, it is possible to add additional public keys by doing:\nkeyctl padd asymmetric \"\" [.system_keyring-ID] <[key-file]\ne.g.:\nkeyctl padd asymmetric \"\" 0x223c7853 \n  \n  Note, however, that the kernel will only permit keys to be added to\n  .system_keyring if the new key's X.509 wrapper is validly signed by\n  a key that is already resident in the .system_keyring at the time the\n  key was added.\n========================= MANUALLY SIGNING MODULES\nTo manually sign a module, use the scripts/sign-file tool available in\n  the Linux kernel source tree.  The script requires 4 arguments:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The hash algorithm (e.g., sha256)\n  \n*The private key filename or PKCS#11 URI\n  \n*The public key filename\n  \n*The kernel module to be signed\n  \n  \n  The following is an example to sign a kernel module:\nscripts/sign-file sha512 kernel-signkey.priv \\      kernel-signkey.x509\n  module.ko\nThe hash algorithm used does not have to match the one configured, but\n  if it doesn't, you should make sure that hash algorithm is either\n  built into the kernel or can be loaded without requiring itself.\nIf the private key requires a passphrase or PIN, it can be provided in\n  the $KBUILD_SIGN_PIN environment variable.\n============================ SIGNED MODULES AND STRIPPING\nA signed module has a digital signature simply appended at the end. \n  The string \"~Module signature appended~.\" at the end of the module's\n  file confirms that a signature is present but it does not confirm that\n  the signature is valid!\nSigned modules are BRITTLE as the signature is outside of the defined\n  ELF container.  Thus they MAY NOT be stripped once the signature is\n  computed and attached.  Note the entire module is the signed payload,\n  including any and all debug information present at the time of\n  signing.\n====================== LOADING SIGNED MODULES\nModules are loaded with insmod, modprobe, init_module() or\n  finit_module(), exactly as for unsigned modules as no processing is\n  done in userspace.  The signature checking is all done within the\n  kernel.\n========================================= NON-VALID SIGNATURES AND UNSIGNED MODULES\nIf CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE is enabled or module.sig_enforce=1 is\n  supplied on the kernel command line, the kernel will only load validly\n  signed modules for which it has a public key.   Otherwise, it will\n  also load modules that are unsigned.   Any module for which the kernel\n  has a key, but which proves to have a signature mismatch will not be\n  permitted to load.\nAny module that has an unparseable signature will be rejected.\n========================================= ADMINISTERING/PROTECTING THE PRIVATE KEY\nSince the private key is used to sign modules, viruses and malware\n  could use the private key to sign modules and compromise the operating\n  system.  The private key must be either destroyed or moved to a secure\n  location and not kept in the root node of the kernel source tree.\n\n\nA: I had this same driver loading issue. I simply passed module.sig_enforce=0 at my grub linux kernel command line.\nHere are steps:\nPermanently Add a Kernel Boot Parameter\n\n*\n\n*Log in to the system and start a terminal window (Applications → Accessories → Terminal).\n\n\n*At the $ prompt, enter the command:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n\n\n*Enter your password when prompted by [sudo].\nIf the file /etc/default/grub appears to be empty or does not exist, see the instructions for earlier releases above.\n\n*\n\n*In the editor window, use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line beginning with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT then edit that line, adding your parameter(s) to the text inside the double-quotes after the words quiet splash. I added module.sig_enforce=0. (Be sure to add a SPACE after splash before adding your new parameter.)\n\n\n*Click the Save button\n\n\n*Close the editor window.\n\n\n*In the terminal window at the $ prompt, enter:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n\n*Restart the system.\nTry loading your module and it worked for me.\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 supports pci_set_dma_mask instead of pci_dma_supported for building PCI drivers.

I'm a normal user with a backup storage for my important data so I decided to upgrade directly to 16.04 via a bootable usb instead of reverting network-manager version and wait for next fix.\n\nIn my previous experience of upgrading Ubuntu through Internet, I have to switch between multiple releases, and all my applications and configurations in /etc is not removed.\n\nHowever, this upgrade from usb boot remove all my applications and their configurations.\n\nWhat lost is lost. I was going to reduce the effect to me next time by divide a partition for the OS only and the application (with its configuration) is on another partition (It's my pure thinking from my experience with Windows). However, again I recognize that I cannot mount /etc to any partion which means next upgrade will still remove the configuration. Also I'm not sure which partition will be kept untouch by installation since it left only /home directory not being removed.\n\n\nSo my question is: is it possible to upgrade Ubuntu OS only via bootable usb without loosing applications and configurations. If yes, how can I do that?\n\nA: I upgraded my laptop from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 directly without losing anything. You can give it a try.

For example, CTRL+R and then writing steam should give you the command you want. Then, just press Enter to execute it.\nYou can also add a tag to the command to identify it. For example, you can run the program using\nLD_PRELOAD='/usr/$LIB/libstdc++.so.6' steam #mytag\n\nand then CTRL+R, then #mytag should give you this exact command.\n\nIf you still want to use a script, maybe the most immediate way is to execute\necho \"LD_PRELOAD='/usr/$LIB/libstdc++.so.6' steam\" > steam_script.sh\nchmod u+x steam_script.sh\n\nand then launch the file using ./steam_script.sh from the directory in which you have created the file.\n", "Q: PDF font falls back to DejaVu Sans, need a monospace replacement I have a PDF that features code fragments and it references Courier Std (which is not available on my system and I am not planning to buy it either).

The message store type is \"File per folder (MBox)\".\nLater I copied that profile to computer B and used them in parallel.\nSo now both profiles still have the same name and some common data and settings, but e.g. the sent mails are only located on the computer they were written. Received mails are mostly on both computers, because the mail server keeps read messages for another month or so, which means I usually have time to download them from both machines.\nMy question is how to bidirectionally synchronize those two profiles again, so that at least all the data (sent/received mails) is the same on both computers? I don't want to upload the profile folders or mail files anywhere, so please suggest methods that work locally (I could of course transfer the profile folders per pendrive etc.) or over LAN.\nPlease note that I don't really want to migrate all my stuff to IMAP (although it would be supported) - I just want to be able to synchronize the POP3 Thunderbird clients manually, on demand over my local network or using removable storage devices.\nThe question is not about migrating to IMAP to keep the accounts in sync in the future, my main problem is to synchronize the past: mails that got already deleted from the server and are stored only in one local profile, and sent mails which were never stored on the server and are only located in the profile from which I wrote them.\n\nA: The best you can do with pop3 for sync is to make sure that both clients don't delete messages from the server, then they can get both messages but this will obviously not change the past.\nNot deleting messages will eventually end up with your mailbox being too large to use without big slowdowns and or timeouts, especially if its hosted by a third party who will have a specific resource allocations.\nIMAP was invented to solve this problem and there are a variety of import tools depending on the specific servers used. Your service provider should be happier with your using IMAP because above about 6 months worth of email IMAP is more resource efficient and better supports multiple clients. I would ask them for advice as they will almost certainly have an import/export tool they have tested to work with their setup, if they don't then find a new provider that does provide them because without those tools you are effectively locked in.\n\nA: Well, I don't have the time to completely dedicate a total walkthrough for you but you might be able to get away with using NIS(yp), NFS, and configuring AutoFS. Then changing your Thunderbird directory to the AutoFS partition that's mounted on the auto-mounted NFS partition.\nPOP has a limitation of Forward & Delete or Forward & Save... but this setup might work.

Also, I have already disabled automatic checking for updates as I'm doing that manually using apt anyway.\n\nA: How to intercept (kill) only specific notifications, using dbus-monitor\nYou can automatically kill specific messages if you have a specific identifying string, which occurres in the notification's text. In this case, \"update\" will probably do.\nHow to setup\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nstring=$1\nmatch=\"update\"\n\nif [[ $string == *$match* ]]\n  then\n    pkill notify-osd\nfi\n\nSave it as killnot.sh. This will kill notify-osd if a certain string occurres in the notification. Edit the line match=\"update\" to reflect the identifying string in the notification(s) you'd like to kill.

Make the script executable.\n\n*Test-run the setup by the command:\n/path/to/monitor_notifs.sh\n\nTo test, run in another terminal the command:\nnotify-send <identifying_string>\n\nThe mesasage should not appear.\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your Startup applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\n/path/to/monitor_notifs.sh\n\nNotes / explanation\nThe script monitor_notifs.sh uses dbus-monitor in the same way as this answer. Running it in the background means nothing to your system and only triggers notifications.\nThese notifications, when they occur, are passed as an argument to the script killnot.sh, which does nothing, unless the identifying string is in the notification's text. In that case it will kill notify-osd.\nWith a little editing of the first script, you can make the setup kill notifications on multiple keywords at once.\n\nEDIT only run the command until the bubble appears\nIf the notification only appears after log in, as you mention in your question, you can \"smarten\" the solution up to kill itself after it intercepted the update notificalion:\nIf you named the scripts in the setup exactly as indicated, add one line to the killnot.sh sript:\npkill -P \"$( pgrep -f run_intercept )\"\n\nThe script then becomes:\n#!/bin/bash\nstring=$1\n\nmatch=\"update\"\nif [[ $string == *$match* ]]\n  then\n    pkill notify-osd\n    pkill -P \"$( pgrep -f run_intercept )\"\nfi\n\nThe main script, run_intercept, will then be killed after it did its job and you have no background script running anymore.\nCloser to clean you cannot get in this situation imo.\n\nA: According to this Fedoraforum.org post, you could try disabling GNOME Software's automatic downloading of updates:\ngsettings set org.gnome.software download-updates false\n\nThe description of that key reads:\n\nIf enabled, GNOME Software automatically downloads updates in the\n  background and prompts the user to install them when ready.\n\nI don't have any updates on hand to test.\n\nA: I found the file /etc/xdg/autostart/update-notifier.desktop , which autostarts the update-notifier service.

Having updated to version 5.x, that fax driver stopped working – and the spadmin tool had disappeared from LibreOffice.1 Simply copying the psprint.conf file to the new location didn't help (as the linked post1 indicates).\nAs a work-around I currently have to print my faxes and then scan them to the fax printer – which obviously defeats the purpose of a \"paperless office\".\nIs there any (not too difficult) way to restore the direct \"print-to-fax\" functionality in LibreOffice?\nPS: I have a Brother MFC 9120 CN here, the corresponding drivers (LPD, CUPS, FAX) are installed on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine. And before you ask: No discussion please about upgrading to 14.04/16.04, that's not part of this question :)\n\n1: see e.g. spadmin gone from libreoffice\n\nA: On further investigation, several hints led me to a proposed solution1: Brother provides a fax modem driver (brfaxmodem-1.1.3-1.i386.deb) which you can download from their support site (link is for MFC9120CN). Their instructions then say:\n\n\n*\n\n*have your printer connected via USB\n\n*install the driver: sudo dpkg -i brfaxmodem-1.1.3-1.i386.deb2\n\n*install the efax package: sudo apt-get install efax\n\n*open /etc/efax.rc using a text editor and change \"DEV=ttyS1\" into \"DEV=modem\"\n\n\nNow you should be able adding a new printer: \"AppSocket/HP JetDirect\" with Hostname: localhost, Port: 9900, printer typ: Generic -> Raw Queue. Having that done, check that /etc/cups/printers.conf contains socket://localhost:9900. efax doesn't start automatically, so you'll have to do that manually when you need it (or create yourself a startup script to have Ubuntu taking care for that at boot).\nIf LibreOffice/OpenOffice doesn't detect this \"fax printer\" (which according to the change logs it should), Fax4CUPS might be needed:\n\n… So the current LibreOffice version in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is obsolete. I've updated my LO to 5.0.1.2 and the fax integration has changed. spadmin no longer exists, and an external script, fax4CUPS is required.\n\nFax4CUPS is a CUPS backend for efax/hylafax/mgetty-fax. At the URL given you can find a .deb package you again need to install via sudo dpkg -i fax4cups_2.0-1_all.deb. Further instructions then can be found in its man page: man fax4CUPS.\n\n1not yet tested by me due to lack of time – but I don't want to a) lose the notes and b) keep them away from you. I will accept this answer once I've tested it successfully.\n2on a 64bit installation, you'll obviously need the 32bit support for that, unfortunately\n\nA: \nTo send a fax directly from LibreOffice, you need a fax modem and a fax driver that allows applications to communicate with the fax modem.\nSending a Fax Through the Print Dialog\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Print dialog by choosing File - Print and select the fax driver in the Name list box.\n  \n*Clicking OK opens the dialog for your fax driver, where you can select the fax recipient.\n  \n  \n  Configuring LibreOffice a Fax Icon\nYou can configure LibreOffice so that a single click on an icon automatically sends the current document as a fax:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Choose Tools - Options - LibreOffice Writer - Print.\n  \n*Select the fax driver from the Fax list box and click OK.\n  \n*Click the arrow icon at the end of the Standard bar.

My Brother MFC isn't involved in it at all.\nAs I'm using a Fritz!Box to connect my home to the Internet and telephony network, which has fax capabilities integrated, I've set that up there and then used Roger Router – which, among other things, provides a fax interface LibreOffice/OpenOffice can interact with directly. Setup of Roger Router is pretty easy and straight-forward, with each step explained, and your Fritz!Box even detected automatically.\n \nThe Assistant starting up // Fax Settings (source: Ubuntu Wiki)\nAs a side-effect I get a bunch of nice-to-have functionality such as a local protocol (from which one can listen to recorded calls or view incoming/outgoing faxes) and desktop notifications of incoming/outgoing calls. I even can manage my Fritz!Box address book via Roger Router.\nRoger Router is available via a PPA:¹\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/tabos-team:/release/xUbuntu_16.04/ /' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/roger.list\"\nwget -q http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/tabos-team:/release/xUbuntu_16.04/Release.key -O- | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get install roger\n\nMake sure to adjust the first line according to the Ubuntu version you're using. My example has the latest LTS (16.04). For other available versions (and distributions), please see here (in short, and for this site's topic: 14.04, 16.04, 17.04 and 17.10 are available as of this writing).\nOnce Roger Router was installed and configured, just select it as default fax in LibreOffice/OpenOffice as described in Karsten's answer.\n\n¹ it seems the PPA will no longer be updated, though, as the developer has switched to FlatPak; if you can read German, see here.\n", "Q: Script to convert .wma to .mp3 command not found I am using a script called conv-script that I found on AskUbuntu here.

I happened to issue the command set and it seems to \"cat\" a script to the console. Why does this happen?\nThis reference page does not seem to explain it.\n If no options or arguments are supplied, set displays the names\n and values of all shell variables\n\n\nA: set is a shell builtin command. When you issue that on the command line, you see everything in your current environment. That will include any functions you have loaded. Note that most distros will include at least a few helpful functions in the shell profiles, and if you have bash completion installed, you will have scads of them.\nenv is a binary. It is loaded and executed by the shell, just like any other command. Therefore, it only sees any environment variables that you have exported, which should exclude any functions from your shell environment.\n\nA: As Frank Schrijver explained in his comment, the bash builtin set will dump all the shell variables ( variables which only \"exist\" in that runtime ) and all shell functions too, again functions initialised and existing in that particular shell process.\nSo for example you will see functions like \n_tilde () \n{ \n   ...\n}\n\nwhich is a function whose purpose is provide tab completion on the ~ character for your bash line editor.\nIndeed even the bash documentation for set, viewable by running the command \nman bash | less '+/^\\s*set \\[--'\n\ndoesn't mention the fact it prints all shell functions by default, but as you have discovered, and others have pointed it - it does print shell functions too.\n", "Q: Sleep Timer to Suspend in Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS is there a way (best would be with GUI) to suspend my Computer after xx minutes?\nI am using  Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS and tried everything, including Power management.\nThanks, philipp\n\nA: If you're looking for a graphical tool, you may try qshutdown.\n\nA: If you don't mind using a terminal, you can do it this way.\nExecute : sleep 2h 45m 20s && systemctl suspend -i\nIt suspends your system in 2 hours, 45 minutes, 20 seconds.\nI wrote a script for getting a GUI like this:\n\n\nCopy the content of the script below and save it in your home directory as  fast_suspend.sh.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#   Tested on : Ubuntu 16.04 LTS    \n#   Date      : 19-May-2016\n#                                                        \n#   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, \n#   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  \n#   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.            \n\nset -- `zenity --title=\"Scheduled-action\" \\\n    --forms \\\n    --text='<span foreground=\"green\">Enter Relative time</span>'  \\\n    --add-entry=\"hours\" \\\n    --add-entry=\"min\" -\\\n    --add-entry=\"sec\" \\\n    --separator=\".0 \" \\\n    --add-combo=action --combo-values=\"poweroff|restart|suspend|logout\"`\n\nhrs=$1\nmin=$2\nsec=$3\naction=$4\n\ntime=$hrs\\h\\ $min\\m\\ $sec\\s\n\n#Checking validity of the input :\n\nre='^[0-9]*([.][0-9]+)?$'\n\nif !

Which the 960s have much better CPUs and more RAM. \nMy issue with OptiPlex 960s is this: I can boot to disc, where you are asked what language. I choose English. Then I choose install Ubuntu Server. Disc light flashes then goes black and screen goes black. No response from any key on the keyboard. Forcing me to reboot. \nI've tried nomodeset with no success.\nI've tried vga=normal fb=false with no success.\nI've tried vga=normal with no success\nI've tried turning off TPM in BIOS with no success.\nI've tried completely disabling TPM in BIOS with no succeses.\nI've tried Ubuntu Server 12 and 14 and 16 with above variations with no success.\nI've tried hooking up a second monitor to the display port with no success.\nI've tried with internet and without internet with no success.\nI've tried installing minimal system with no success.\nIt always goes to a black screen after the main install menu.\nI'm about to throw in the towel, again. Any suggestions will greatly help. I'm not at all afraid of terminal commands. This has been an ongoing challenge for a few months now, I was praying Ubuntu Server 16.04 would solve the issue.\nUPDATE:\nTried to install Ubuntu Server 16.04 which worked on an old OptiPlex 330, no issues, no hiccups.\nStill no success with every OptiPlex 960 I try.\nWhen its at the black screen, there is no activity lights on the Optical drive, nor on the HDD, nor the Ethernet, only a solid light indicating power.\nI let it hang at the black screen for hours upon hours with no change, no success, requiring a reboot.\nI was able to install Debian using a Net Installer iso. So I'm confused as to why Ubuntu Server wont install.\n\nA: Change the RAID settings in the BIOS to Legacy and it should work.  I just installed 16.04.3 to an optiplex 960.\n", "Q: Remove dollar sign if it is first character of pasted command When giving examples of shell commands people will often prefix each line with the $ to illustrate it should be ran in terminal. Most recently I encountered it on this Github page.\n$ sudo apt-get install curl netcat-openbsd bc pv\n$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neutronth/speedtest-lite/master/speedtest-lite\n\nWhen these lines are triple clicked the dollar sign (being part of that line) is of course part of the selection. Is there a way to set my terminal (I'm using Terminator) so that if $ is the first character of a command, to ignore it?\n\nA: I set out to answer this question, and it turned out to be a little more involved then I thought. With a little bash magic: \n    cat file | while read x; do OUTPUT=$(echo $x | sed 's/^.//'); eval $OUTPUT; done\n\nWhat this does is prints file to standard output, reads each line, removes the first character, and stores the result in $OUTPUT, then runs the line in $OUTPUT as a command with eval. Be careful when using eval, this script will run an entire file as commands.\n", "Q: cannot run software updater on 15.10 I started my Ubuntu 15.10 and am unable to open the software updater app. I keep getting the following error\nSystemError: E:Malformed line 55 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)\n\nI tried purging the app and reinstalling, but still get the same error.

I succeeded in changing the poor default icon of NetBeans (32x32), which appears in window switcher (Alt+Tab), to HD one (128x128) when started from Launcher by clicking it, but still unable to make it when launched from a keyboard shortcut (\"/bin/sh netbeans\") or terminal (just enter \"netbeans\").\nI searched the whole system and replaced every suspicious .png file so I even have no idea where the 32x32 icon comes from. I've also tried modifying \"Icon=...\" line in .desktop file (How can I change the icon of an application in the Unity launcher?), \"xdg-icon-resource install ...\" thing (How to package an application icon properly?), and alacarte (How do I add an application to the dash?), but still fail.\nIs there any possible way of doing it? Or, is there any appropriate command of invoking it as if it were clicked from Launcher? (<=> let .desktop to be considered)?\nI'm on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nThank you.\n\nA: I'm not positive about this, but I think the icon you're referring to is set by the application itself. Therefore, to change the icon you have to either change it in the program settings (if possible) or alter the program's source code.\nI know for a fact that this is how an app I wrote works; I don't know if all are this way, though.\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu 64 bits from 32 bits alongside Windows 10 I have a notebook that came with Windows 10 installed and I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 to dual boot, but I made the mistake of installing Ubuntu 32bits instead of the 64 bits version. Now Windows 10 will not start, apparently because I needed the 64 bits version of Ubuntu.\nI tried reinstalling Ubuntu with a boot-able pen drive but I don't know how to make the system boot from the USB, how can I do that?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Your windows did not boot maybe because grub is missing. Try this in ubuntu and type this in terminal. Then restart your computer. You should be able to see the grub menu to choose between ubuntu and windows.\nsudo update-grub\n\nIf you want to create a bootable usb installer, you can use Startup Disk Creator, an app already installed in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to send alt + f7 key from autokey I want to send alt+f7 keys from autokey.

Maybe its just on my computer.\n\nA: It seems that Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't allow the system wide keyboard shortcuts to be emulated by autokey.\n\nA: Autokey scripts are plain Python files. Autokey uses Python scripting engine.

Your download may have gone wrong, or it may have been while transferring to your DVD/USB.\nI'd recommend that you download the ISO file from Ubuntu again, and give it another try.\nAlso, 32Gbits (4GB) is a good amount of SWAP space, but I'm assuming you meant 32Gbytes, and that would be much bigger than required.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 - system boot waits saying \"Raise network interfaces\" I have an Ubuntu 16.04 system with two interfaces -  eth0 configured with DHCP and eth1 configured with static ip addresses.\nThe /etc/network/interfaces file has the following config\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\n# The Secondary network interface\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 10.10.1.10\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ndns-nameservers 74.82.42.42 4.2.2.2\n\n## Virtual Interfaces for virtual hosts\nauto eth1:11\niface eth1:11 inet static\naddress 10.10.1.11\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\n\nauto eth1:12\niface eth1:12 inet static\naddress 10.10.1.12\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\n\nauto eth1:13\niface eth1:13 inet static\naddress 10.10.1.13\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\n\nThe issue is, when DHCP server is not available on eth0 link or if the eth0 link is down, the system hangs for 5 mins, significantly slowing down the boot process.\nviolet@ubuntu-xenial:~$ systemd-analyze blame\n      5min 241ms networking.service\n          1.529s nmbd.service\n          1.524s winbind.service\n\nI tried reducing the time in /etc/systemd/system/network-online.target.wants/networking.service file which makes the system boot faster without waiting for the network service, however, that fails to load the virtual interfaces on eth1.\nIs there a cleaner way to let the system boot without full network configuration on eth0 interface and still load all the static network configuration on eth1?\n\nA: It seems someone was paranoid about a client not getting it's DHCP in time.\nEdit this file /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf and set timeout to a reasonable value, like\ntimeout 15\n\nThe default value of 300 seconds is way too high.

What am I missing? I'm a real novice here so do I need to download it on a disk or USB drive or can I download it straight to my laptop? \n\nA: You have to create a live installation by either burning the ISO image to a dvd, or creating a bootable USB (some tools for that: rufus, YUMI, multiboot...). After that, you'll have to restart your computer and boot into your live installation. From there you will have to choose where to install Ubuntu on your hard drive. BE CAREFUL not to erase your entire disk (a warning of that does appear). You will need an ext3 or ext4 partition. Click install, restart, and enjoy.\nThese are somewhat vague steps into the matter, here is a tutorial with images on doing it. In case you run into any sort of troubles, a quick search on this forum WILL have the answer. Otherwise, ask away.\n\nA: I recommend Wubi, because you can \"try out\" Ubuntu without actually changing partition, or even create boot USB/DVD. It's a Windows program that let you download Ubuntu installation ISO, and then it walks you through baby steps.\n\n\nA: You can download Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64 bit\nfrom the link above.

But I believe there should be a way to do it automatically inside the container, so if I manually reboot it (the container), I don't have to execute that command each time.\n\nA: Alpine Linux uses OpenRC for its init system. The basic commands to interact with it are\nrc-update add <service> [runlevel]\n\nadds service to the init sequence (similarly to systemd's systemctl enable <service> in Ubuntu 15.04 and forward);\nrc-update del <service> [runlevel]\n\nstops service from starting during system init (similarly to systemd's systemctl disable <service>);\nrc-service <service> [start stop restart]\n\nmanages currently running services (similarly to systemd's systemctl [start stop restart] <service>, or equivalently /etc/init.d/service [start stop restart] which works in both systemd and OpenRC).\nMore information can be found on the Alpine Wiki page I linked to above, and a cheatsheet for OpenRC-systemd translation is available here.\n", "Q: Dependency Is not satisfiable : libstdc++6 (>=4.8.0) When I try to install Chrome through the Ubuntu Software Center, I get the message\n\nDependency Is not satisfiable : libstdc++6 (>=4.8.0)\n\nHow can I fix this?\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: The version of libstdc++6 in Ubuntu 12.04 is 4.6.3.

It's ability to integrate with various other applications makes it favourite candidate. One of the distinct feature is that it provides cross-platform API that enables not only device sharing but also inter-application audio routing. It also shows a very easy learning curve.JACK\n\n*Ardour: It is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), suitable for recording, mixing and mastering. It can be easily integrated with all JACK applications. \nArdour\n\n*Linux Multimedia Studio:  Also know as LMMS, it provides you enough features to get your work done and that too beautifully. It is compatible with MIDI keyboard and hence allows import of MIDI and FruityLoops(FLP) files. \nLMMS\n\n*Rosegarden: This one is for those who like to compose.Rosegarden\n\n*Audacity: Need not mention features for this one. The one of the most famous audio editing software is also available for Ubuntu.Audacity\nThere are many more available but I have mentioned the most famous and with most features. \nAdditionally you can also try Ubuntu Studio is which a flavour of Ubuntu solely customized for Multimedia purpose. It comes with many of above mentioned music/audio softwares pre-installed. Do have a look at it's benefits here: Ubuntu Studio\n\nA: Well, the most ambitious one is the multi-platform paid proprietary DAW called Bitwig Studio, which is quite similar to popular Ableton (in fact, it's built by some Ableton developers). You can also try a more traditional and totally free and open source DAW Ardour (well, you have the \"pay what you want\" price for downloading the binaries, but you can download the sources for free and compile them). And, of course, there is LMMS (Linux Multimedia Studio), which is also free and open source. See this list for more information.\nA popular (and cheap) Windows DAW Reaper doesn't have a Linux version, but is developed with Wine compatibility in mind, so it runs fine.\nYou can also pay attention to Ubuntu Studio. While there is nothing you can't install in your regular Ubuntu, Ubuntu Studio offers you a lot of things just out of the box.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu Server to a iSCSI Drive using IBFT We have to install Ubuntu Server 16.04 on iSCSI Drives and boot from them, because we have no local storage. We have configured the iSCSI capable Network Controllers to log in into the iSCSI Target and boot from them (Actually i can see the targets when i start the Server). But the installer of ubuntu Server is not able to use this information. He does not configure the Network or the Disk Drives using IBFT (iSCSI Boot Firmware Table).

If anyone can explain the cause behind this error in the next couple of days, I'll accept their answer. Otherwise, I'll leave this answer here for anyone else who experiences the same issue (although, having running containers was all that stopped me from rebooting, which would've fixed the issue too--since all ZFS datasets are mounted on startup--so this issue is far from critical).\n\nA: Saw this today on a fresh Xenial install, also after having deleted some containers the day before.\nRemoving the /var/lib/lxd/containername.zfs mount point (rm) and then running zfs mount -a fixed it\nQuite disconcerting that you can't delete a container without worrying about mount points getting screwed up!\n", "Q: Solved.

using Lubuntu 14.04.4.\nI have followed the instructions (found in arch wiki):\n$ ssh-agent\n$ eval $(ssh-agent)\n$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_dsa\n\nBut when I do: \n$ ssh -p 22 jofre@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n\nit

Read man ssh-keygen, and probably mv /home/jofre/.ssh/id_dsa\\{,.hidden\\} to rename it to /home/jofre/.ssh/id_dsa.hidden which will make ssh ignore it, and keep it where you can get it back if.\n", "Q: How do I use fancontrol on HP Elitebook 8560w? I have an HP EliteBook 8560w running on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) that for just running Firefox I get 60 degrees Celsius and when running Eclipse IDE or Blender for example I get around 75 degrees and sometimes over 80. I tried installing lm-sensors and fan control, but it didn't work. I couldn't find anything useful on Google.\nBelow is my sensors output:\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +75.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp2:        +73.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp3:        +61.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp4:        +45.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp5:        +29.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp6:         +0.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nPhysical id 0:  +75.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 0:         +72.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 1:         +75.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 2:         +72.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 3:         +73.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\n\nA: These laptops are known for having noisy fans because they are in the workstation class where performance is more important than noise or comfort. This means that even at the best of times they will make noise and put out often scary amounts of heat. They need to be used on flat smooth surfaces with as much airflow as possible around them and always with the lid up.\nA bit of googling suggests that newer BIOSes and fan control software will have limited effect although it's worth checking if the fan control options in the BIOS are not set to always on.\nThe real issue appears to be bad thermal paste between the CPU and the cooler. This has the effect of preventing heat from escaping as fast as expected and making the fans work harder that they should to make up for the difference.\nHere is a video that shows someone replacing the thermal paste on that laptop. It's a bit fiddly, but these laptops are designed to be reasonably serviceable so it's not insanely difficult, but there are of course risks such as static damage and loosing or breaking tiny parts. At your own risk obviously. See HP Elitebook 8560w/8570w Disassembly and thermal compound paste replacement, разборка (YouTube).\nAnother solution is to get a laptop cooling pad to sit underneath it. These typically have much larger fans at slow speed that make far less noise and vibration, but they can massively improve the air flow to the laptop\nand prevent the heat building up in the first place.\n\nA: If you cannot get fancontrol to work, make sure your kernel is up to date. I had this issue on my laptop, and it immediately began to work after updating the kernel.\n\nA: I also have a Elitebook 8570W with Ubuntu 16.04. To reduce the noise from fans, I follow this steps :\n1.Disable the BIOS option : Fan always on\n2.Clean heatsink and change the thermal paste (choose a good one)\n3.FanControl doesn't work, instead I install nbfc software (https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc)\n4.I setup config file of nbfc to let CPU temperature climb to 78°C (instead of around 55°c by default)\nSo the Fan is running very few when few tasks are running and my left hand is little bit more hot than the right ;-)\nNota : sometimes at startup nbfc doexn't get the han over the bios, so I need to start Psensor software and after a little time all is done.\n\nA: In my experience, if you often experience high CPU temperatures in your notebook, the best approach is to first clean any dust that may have accumulated behind you CPU fan. You wouldn't believe the amounts of dust I found behind the fans of some of my friends' notebooks, who experienced similar problems and whose notebooks I cleaned, to great effect.\nOf course, you can try to use tools like fancontrol to control the fan speed. But then what? Do you want to configure your fan to run at maximum velocity all the time? This will be very loud, and if there is a lot of dust behind your fan, it will hardly improve the temperatures anyway. In fact, with the temperatures that you describe, I suspect your fan may already be spinning at its highest velocity most of the time.\nCleaning your fan will require you to disassemble some of your laptop's interior. Depending on the exact model, this can either be very easy or very tough. Personally, what I first do in this situation is that I go to YouTube and try to find a disassembly video of the model I'm interested in, e.g., search for something like HP Elitebook 8560w disassembly. It will give you a very good idea of what you have to do for your particular model without any hassle.\nA quick search for your model gave me this video, which appears to be ok:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMqUWDR77TI\nUnfortunately, from what I can see, for your particular model, it's a bit of work—you have to take out your keyboard in order to be able to access your fan. If you don't like that video, there were several others—just have a look. Note that these disassembly videos usually show you how to disassemble the entire notebook, but if you're only interested in cleaning the fan, you only have to do a tiny subset of what they do in the video (e.g., you don't have to take out the hard disk). What you definitely should do, though, before you start the disassembly, is to take out the battery.\n", "Q: Selecting files from different folders Is it possible in nautilus to select a bunch of files from a folder, then go to a different folder and add some more files to the selection ?\n\nA: No, unfortunately it is not possible.\n\nA: bafman Begins\nThis is a work in progress answer divided into two posts.\nbafman (Born Again File Manager) was developed this past long weekend (April 14-17, 2017). It is still a work in progress but it will satisfy requirement to select files across many sub-directories.\nThis is ideal in situations where you want to copy files in a project without doing a full system backup. There are other applications such as tagging every system configuration file you've modified across dozens of different directories.\nI'm posting this WIP in hopes of generating interest and gathering suggestions for additional features as I finish bash coding. Yes it's all written in bash (to the shock of many perhaps) and relies on YAD (Yet Another Dialog) for all the GUI.\nInitial data creation\nWhen you invoke bafman for the first time this screen appears after a few moments:\n\nThis is the main screen. You can click on any column heading to sort in ascending then descending order. You can grab the column divider and move it to adjust column width.\nThe list of directories is cut down from > 20,000 (the bafman limit) using this command:\ntree --noreport -danifI \"src*|dev|lib|media|mnt|proc|root|run|sys|tmp|tmpfs|var|usr\" / > \"$bafmanTemp\"\n\nIf you are a programmer you might want to see all the \"src*\" directories and would remove this from the code.\nNotice the file counts and sizes are all zero in our display. That is remedied in the next section.\nUpdate Dirs button - generate file statistics for all directories\nWhen you click on the Update Dirs button you are greeted with this initial warning:\n\n10,000 directories is an extraordinary situation if for example you add the /usr directory and /var directory to bafman list. In our example we have 2,365 directories and it takes about 5 minutes to scan all files in them.\nWhile scanning all files in all directories this progress screen appears:\n\nWhen all is said and done the main screen is updated like this:\n\nOnce again it's important to note you can click on \"File Sizes\" column to sort on ascending order (smallest on top) and click again for descending order (directories with largest file sizes on top).\nSearch on directory name is possible by simply typing the directory you want to advance to. For example type /etc/default and the screen scrolls to that directory.\nHide Dir button - remove directory from bafman list\nI noticed I have a directory called /cdrom2 which I forgot I created during testing the \"fake\" directory /cdrom (which you MUST KEEP). So let's remove /cdrom2 from the bafman list by clicking the Hide Dir button:\n\nThe directory /cdrom2 has already been removed from the drive so the Modified and Owner fields display as Deleted. These and other fields on this screen are described under the Edit comments section.\nFor the time-being select the OK button to hide the sub-directory and then this screen then appears:\n\nIt is possible to hide a directory and keep all the sub-directories under it on the bafman list. Then those individual sub-directories can be hidden or kept individually.\nEdit comments button - enter comments for any directory.\nWhen working with Linux / Ubuntu directories you have to remember lots of details about them so you can enter some important comments here.\nFrom the main screen type /etc/default and the screen scrolls to that directory. Double click on it or hit the Space Bar to the select the directory and then click the Edit comments button:\n\nAppropriate comments have been entered. Note that if you Hide the directory in the future the comments will be lost. The other fields on the screen are auto-generated every time you click the Enter comments button and will be saved on the main screen.\nEven if you don't enter a comment coming to this screen and having directory counts generated counts as one transaction. (More on transaction counts later).\nAdd Dir button - Add directory to bafman list\nYou can add any directory to the bafman list and it will prompt to automatically add sub-directories as well. In this example we'll add the directory /lib which contains hundreds of sub-directories.\nWhen you click the Add Dir button this screen appears with your home directory selected as default:\n\nAs you probably suspected already my real name isn't WinEunuchs2Unix as this screenshot reveals. \n\n\n*\n\n*Click the directory drop down arrow\n\n*Select Other... from the list\n\n*Start typing /lib/systemd/\n\n*Click Open\nAfter selecting the directory to add, the screen reappears and we've typed in an appropriate comment:\n\nClick OK to add the directory and then you are prompted to add sub-directories under it:\n\nFor our example, click Yes.\n\nNote: If you attempt to add the entire /lib directory and all sub-directories you might get an error message \"Unknown button return\n  code\" and if you call bafman from the terminal the following error\n  message appears:\nline 575: /usr/bin/yad: Argument list too long\n\nIf you are running bafman from desktop shortcut you'll see this error\n  in /var/log/syslog. Remember bash has limits on how large arrays\n  can be when passing to GUI Yad.\n\nAfter adding the new directory and sub-directories under it the main screen reappears. Start typing /lib/systemd and the screen scrolls down to this section:\n\nHere's an important note: When adding a new directory it is appended to the bottom of bafman's list. Simply click the Directory Name column heading to resort the list alphabetically.\nAll the statistics of file counts and file sizes are zero. If it were only a single directory we could simply click Edit comments button and those stats are generated for us. But it is easier to click Update Dirs button and go grab a coffee.\nWhen you enter a comment while adding a new directory that comment is inherited by all the sub-directories under it (should you choose to add them at the same time).\nTag files button - Select the files which will be used by Run command\nThis is the heart of bafman and unfortunately incomplete at this time. Tagging files within the directory has been setup but designs need to be formulated for tagging files within sub-directories under the select directory. Hopefully community input helps in the design.\nLet's get started by navigating to the directory /home/rick/.local/share/nautilus/scripts, selecting it with double-click and then clicking the Tag files button:\n\nIf you're like me you've invested a lot of time writing your scripts (or documents) so tagging them for subsequent copying is a good idea. This is a short list and we want everything so let's click the Tag All button:\n\nThe default is regular files only. This is where I need input as to what to do when directories are selected...\nVery quickly to wrap things up click the Untag All button:\n\nThe defaults are to untag ALL file types.\nThanks for staying awake and looking forward to your input.

It's hard to predict what Windows will do...\nBoot frome Live CD, open gnome-disc-utility (it should be in system menu), select your drive, click on a three-lines icon on top right and use \"Create image\" option (of course you need enough free space on your backup media to fit entire first drive).\nIf something will go south, you will be able to easy restore entire drive 1:1 using \"Restore image\" option and maybe try again with different method/approach.\n\nA: Knowing how to setup and reliably restore a backup is something every user should know. Go to the System Settings panel, to Backups (the black safe), and configure a back-up there.\nUsing a removable drive is very easy: plug in your drive, start Backups, choose the \"Storage Location\" panel in the left menu, and use the top drop-down menu to choose the correct storage device, and name your back-up in the field below.\nBacking up will take some time, and when it is complete ensure that your backup is working by trying the Restore button in the \"Overview\" panel. Just by starting the Restore process it will need to open and verify the backup is working. Also, this is how you can access specific folders in the backup using \"Restore Folder\" > \"Other\" and choosing the files or folders you'd like to revert to.\nIf you keep up your good habits and are doing daily or (at least) weekly backups, you can revert to older versions of files directly in Nautilus, providing an integrated TimeMachine-like experience.\n\nIf you are successful with your Windows re-install, and then install 16.04 along-side it, you will be able to recover your data with Backups > Overview > Restore and just acknowledging the little complaints it makes if you have changed computers, username, or computer-name.\n", "Q: Is There A VCS-Like System on Libreoffice Documents I am currently writing my graduation thesis on Libreoffice.

I also thought, maybe I could drag-drop archive contents to a git initialized folder and commit. However, if I finish my work, should I compress them as tar.gz or tar.bz and change extension to odt? I could not be sure.\nWhy I Do Not Use LaTeX\nI do not want to use LaTeX since the LaTeX itself and library needs a quite large disk space and my document will contain lots of images. I am actually writing my thesis on generative grammar and LaTeX has an extension to draw syntax trees, but the development of that extension is (i) either stopped or too slow and (ii) it looks quite ugly and (iii) maybe I cannot apply Minimalist Program of Chomsky in that extension.\nWhy I Do Not Prefer Google Drive Document\nGoogle Drive is a good idea, but it might have some limitations. And I really hesitate using an office-related software in a web platform.\n\nSo, I wondered if there was a way to do this in LibreOffice. The solutions below would answer my question:\n\n\n*\n\n*An easy way (or just a way) to save document as folder and ability to reopen it would be just great since I can track it on git.\n\n*Maybe another online platform or offline feature to do that excluding File > Version option since I can get into earlier versions but not track in that option.\n\n*Any other solution\n\n\nA: Well, I found a solution on saving and reopening it as a directory. When you save it, open it with an archive manager and extract to a folder.\nThen, you can rebuild to reopen it by compressing as zip. Then, rename its extension as odt. Now it works.\nHowever, that will not work if you try to have a README.md like additional files inside directory. So, you will need an extra directory to dump and rebuild.\nThis is one of solutions and will be accepted as valid answer if there does not occur any better one in three days.\n", "Q: How do I correct zfs pool trying to use incorrect device after reboot?

I have to use ACDCLI for the actual copy so I need to remove these first by calling any folder name from /ParentFolder/* and rm -rf /mount/\"FolderName\"\nIf it was one folder easy, but I'm not sure how to say, get all the folder names from X, and delete if they exist in Y.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is what you're after.  But to get all of the folder names in X, you could do:\nfind /some/directory -type d -print\n\nRepeat this in Y.  Of course, if the two directories are:  /ParentFolder/FolderName/Files.mp4 and /Mount/FolderName/Files.mp4, then make sure you cd far enough so that you've moved passed the part of the paths that differ.\nSo, in the first directory, cd into /ParentFolder.  In the second case, cd into /Mount.\nIf you do this in both directories, you will get two lists (let's call them list1.txt and list2.txt), you can concatenate them, sort, and then print unique lines:\ncat list1.txt list2.txt | sort | uniq -u\n\nThese are the directories that exist in only one list.  You can store this in a variable:\nunique_paths=`cat list1.txt list2.txt | sort | uniq -u | xargs`\n\nand then iterate through:\nfor my_path in ${unique_paths} ; do\n  if [ -e \"/ParentFolder/${my_path}\" ] ; then\n    ##  Do something to it\n  else\n    ##  This means it is in /Mount/, so do something else\n  fi\ndone\n\nI haven't tried this myself -- so do test it first.\nAs an alternative, you might want to look into the man pages of rsync.

It went back to normal.\n\nA: This issue is better solved by the next input:\n\n$ ibus-daemon --xim\n\nAnd, also activating this Keyboard input method system in the System preferences - Language Support:\nKeyboard input method system => XIM\nThe reason is that, when a language has complex characters like \"à\", the \"Ibus\" always generates problems, even to the \"very known\" non Gnome applications like Skype and Microsoft Office-PlayOnLinux.

Two websites (The Linux Documentation Project and Computer Hope) suggest the command \"lpr\" but both seem to suggest two different methods, with no obvious reason why they are different or which should be used in different circumstances.\nOption 1:\nlpr <filename>\n\nOption 2:\ncat <filename> | lpr\n\nI understand that option 1 simply prints the file, whereas option 2 uses cat to read the file and pipes it to lpr which then prints it, but why is that useful? In what cases should I use one or the other or are they totally equivalent? (If so, surely option 1 is better as it takes less typing...)\n\nA: [I do realize I'm 6 years late to the party, but there is currently no answer, so I thought I'd give it a try.]\nWith lpr filename, lpr receives the filename, and has the responsibility to open that file and read its content.\nWith cat filename | lpr, lpr receives the content on the file on stdin, in a pipe (and does not even see the filename). This is often nicked as \"useless use of cat\" (UUOC, see e.g. https://porkmail.org/era/unix/award)\nTo avoid the UUOC, some people (myself included) prefer <filename lpr (or equivalently lpr <filename) which connects stdin to the file. It is similar to lpr filename but offers some flexibility, e.g. <filename ssh some-machine lpr for printing to a remote printer.\n\nA: Good this question came up after this long time.\nThere is a serious reason for using the pipe to lpr. The usage with cat can just seen as an example.\nAssume you have some images and want to put 4 images per page to printout. Without the pipe you have to create a temporary file and make sure to delete it afterwards. With the pipe, you can put several command in one line without creating a temporary file.\nFor an example:\nimg2pdf pic1.png pic2.png pic3.png pic4.png | pdftops - - | psnup -4 | ps2pdf  - | lpr\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation shuts down at selection menu I am trying to install Ubuntu 16.04 using USB.

The ClamAV team does not maintain individual packages for every distribution build. If\n  there are no new packages, you have three options:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Wait\n  \n*Build Clam Package\n  \n*Install From Source\n  \n\nIt is OK to wait because clamav is still working even though it's not the latest version. That warning is more FYI. Also, you don't need to manually run freshclam. If you type \ntail -20 /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log\n\nyou should see some more info, telling you that the databases etc have been recently (as in, today) updated. When I do this, I see the same warning as you and the next message is don't panic: see https://github.com/vrtadmin/clamav-faq FAQ page So, don't panic.\nI do not recommend compiling from source, as it will not be updated through APT, but here is the guide\nSummary:\nUninstall the old version sudo apt remove clamav\nDownload the tar file from the ClamAV website\nextract with tar xf clamav* then cd clamav* and then:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nthen run\nsudo freshclam\n\nAs always, see the documentation for more help\n\nA: Zanna's suggestion about installing from source is the correct solution to the problem.\nHowever a more direct answer to the question is to note that 0.99 is the latest version of clamav for Ubuntu 16.04 (the latest version of Ubuntu).  See http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/clamav .\nThe warning from the program indicates there is a new version of clamav upstream (i.e., by the developers of clamav).  The latest version for the latest version of Ubuntu may actually be a bit older.  As the message is just a warning, you can disregard it.  If 0.99 has a \"serious\" security flaw, then a proper patch will most likely be released.\nInstalling from source is one solution, but you will have to keep it up-to-date manually -- something that we often forget to do.\nI don't know much about clamav, but for virus scanners, what you want to keep up-to-date are the virus definitions.  Assuming the version you are using can still have the virus definitions updated, you should be fine.\n", "Q: Problem with dual monitors not presenting the proper resolution i just came from Windows 10 to ubuntu 16.04 and can't find solution or any fix for my problem.\nI'm using dual monitors (both the same models-Samsung S22D300N).Monitor(1) is connected via VGA-VGA cable, Monitor(2) is connected by VGA-VGA-to-DVI adapter.\nOn monitor(2) my ressolution can't pass 1360x768 while monitor(1) is running on 1920x1080.Everything is working okay on Win10, both monitors on 1920x1080.\nI have installed lastest nvidia drivers but resolution problems is still there.\nI'll do my best do provide all the necessery information.\nGPU-Geforce GTS450\nxrandr \n\n> Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 3280 x 1080, maximum 16384 x 16384\nDVI-I-0 connected 1360x768+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm\n   1024x768      60.00 +\n   1360x768      59.96*   59.80  \n   1152x864      60.00  \n   800x600       72.19    60.32    56.25  \n   680x384       59.96    59.80  \n   640x480       59.94  \n   512x384       60.00  \n   400x300       72.19  \n   320x240       60.05  \nVGA-0 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 477mm x 268mm\n   1920x1080     60.00*+\n   1680x1050     59.95  \n   1600x900      60.00  \n   1440x900      59.89  \n   1280x1024     75.02    60.02  \n   1280x800      59.81  \n   1280x720      60.00  \n   1152x864      75.00  \n   1024x768      75.03    70.07    60.00  \n   800x600       75.00    72.19    60.32    56.25  \n   640x480       75.00    72.81    59.94  \nDVI-I-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n  1600x900_60.00 (0x3b6) 118.250MHz -HSync +VSync\n        h: width  1600 start 1696 end 1856 total 2112 skew    0 clock  55.99KHz\n        v: height  900 start  903 end  908 total  934           clock  59.95Hz\n  1920x1080_60.00 (0x3b8)  9.250MHz -HSync +VSync\n        h: width  1920 start 1976 end 2160 total 2400 skew    0 clock   3.85KHz\n        v: height   60 start   63 end   73 total   76           clock  50.71Hz<\n\n\nA: First save any work in case your screen turns off and won't turn on without restarting.

At least until you get under the hood a bit.. \nI am still much the noob with linux for this reason.. \nAt any rate, recently I purchased a vinyl cutter and did a search to see if there were any linux programs that might run it.. \nCame across InkCut, which I gather is an extension for Inkscape. \nAcording to the instructions on the inkcut site, I am supposed to extract the files into the inkscape extensions folder and it gave what the path should look like.. \nWell I spent about a month going through that laptop trying to find that location and just could not locate it.. was about ready to just smash the damn laptop and cursing linux for the constant BS you have to always go thru to set simplest things  up.. \nAfter one last search, I managed to locate a folder under the file system usr\\shared\\inkscape\\extensions.. yay.. I thought I finally was there and could finally enjoy my damn cutter.. but heck no.. linux had other plans.. it would not let me extract to that folder.. said I did not have permissions to extract to that folder.

Far fewer problems.. it just works.. Just push a couple buttons and your software is installed and running in most cases.. Yet linux is still promising and probably where I am headed.. if I can ever get it to work and actually make sense.. \nWith linux my experience has been 50/50.. half the time things install thru the software center just fine.. the other times I have to spend way too much time i terminal typing endless lines  and commands  and searching forums and hoping and praying to get timely responses.. some things get responded and resolved in a few days which really kills the fun and excitement of gaining new software and wanting to use it.. and still times when you dont get responses or solutions and never get to enjoy your software you hoped to enjoy..

It was not located in the .config folder where the inkcut site recommended extracting its files to.. I never did find a .config folder.. So when I finally found inkscape in the usr/shares folder, I just assumed that is where it needed to go and extract the files there.. I am not strong in the ways of linux so where and why linux puts things and how to locate them gets confusing  and frustrating sometimes.. \nWhen I install thru the software center, unlike windows, I have no clue where linux puts stuff.. for the most part.. have to really dig sometimes to find things.. there are a few things I have installed where I got to tell it where I wanted it installed, which I did.. but not inkscape.. it was already there.. \nShould I just uninstall it(inkscape) and try to reinstall it? And then try to extract inkcut again and see if it is where it needs to be?\n\nA: So you wish to install the InkCut as an extension to inkscape ?   \nWithout knowing either I just did :\n\n\n*\n\n*install of inkscape :   go to Launcher bar (move mouse to far left screen and click on that circular Ubuntu icon (Dash) at top of list then type in : Software (click on matching icon) ... then search on inkscape and do install)\n\n*download inkcut :  it downloads to file ~/Downloads/InkCut-1.0.tar.gz \n\n*now to actual install of inkcut ... from terminal (ctrl-alt-t) issue :\n\n\ntar -xzvf ~/Downloads/InkCut-1.0.tar.gz  -C   ~/.config/inkscape/extensions/\nDone !!!!\n\nA: If you like using the GUI which makes things easier, do this in terminal :\nsudo nautilus\n\nand enter your password when prompted. This will make the file browser have root access and you can now copy files into the /usr structure.\nAlternate solution if you're trying to extract a compressed file is\nsudo file-roller\n\nThen open your compressed file and extract.\nNOTE! Make sure you do not edit or create any files in your home folder while using Nautilus or File Roller with sudo!\n", "Q: Scanner / printer firewall My firewall is blocking the scanner from working but the printer works fine.

Is it possible to just create a small bit of data and make it the 90GB extended partition on which I will install the Linux?\n\nA: So, here are some basics on partitioning:\nBut before changing partitions: BACKUP YOUR DATA !!!\nNo joke: BACKUP YOUR DATA !!!\nFor MBR disks I would advise \"Easeus Partition Master\" (freeware; my long time favourite) for Windows – which is far better and flexible than those Windows tools – or GParted for Linux which is (also) approved and robust. But there is a small difference:\nEaseus PM does not care about cylinder boundaries, which is generally OK. But there is a little tricky workaround to manage that. The point on that is, that sometimes when resizing/moving partitions a small piece of unallocated space remains between two neighbour partitions.\nMy experience with GParted is quite small, but as far as I remember, it follows those cylinder boundaries to keep compatibility with some OS's. Nevertheless it accepts partitions that are not placed within these boundaries.\nOn an MBR disk you can simply add a new partition and decide/select whether it shall be a primary or logical partition. Latter one will automatically be embedded into an expanded extended partition – if possible (read on).\nAn MBR disk is only capable of carrying 4 primary partitions. The trick is that one of these (only one!) can be an extended partition which itself just serves as a container for logical partitions. \nWith elder fdisk programs you will have to add an extended partition prior to adding a logical one. But with modern GUI tools like Easeus PM, Windows Volume Manager or GParted you just need to select – while adding – if you want to add a primary (if still available) or logical partition. In latter case the underlying extended partition will ether be added or expanded.\nI would advise to use primary partitions just for boot (marked as active), swap and OS volumes. But OS volumes nowadays (since Win2k) don't need to be on primary partitions as long as there is a boot manager (GRUB/BCD) on a primary one which can be quite tiny (~50-100 MB). \nOn factory-side pre-installed Windows hard disks you most likely already will have such a 100MB partition at the beginning of the disk. Here the Windows boot manager (BCD) and the recovery console resides. \nFor additional Linux installation the GRUB can be put here too but not necessarily. Be aware, that installing GRUB on this partition will overwrite the MBR (the BCD stays intact and will be called from GRUB). The trouble is in this case you cannot edit the BCD any more unless you repair it (overwrite the MBR again which next time overrides GRUB).\nI would recommend to install GRUB to the Linux system partition. But in this case you need to study BCD programming to add Linux to the BCD. This is quite tricky and weird.\nI strongly recommend to thoroughly plan changes on partitions before installing new OS's, because it can be quite dangerous changing Windows system partitions – of course unless you REALLY know what you're doing.\nAnyway, back to partitioning: you cannot split extended partitions. So if you have e.g. a partitions order P-E-P-U (U=unallocated) you cannot go and add an extended partition in the unallocated disk space. In such a case you can\n\n\n*\n\n*(complicated way) IF the E partition contains just one L partition, copy that L partition into the U space as a P partition (if it fits), delete the source E/L, move the second P direct next to the first one, transform the copied P into a L (optional:  expand E to the left, and move L left, next to the second P) and add a new L into the U space. This will (further) expand E.\n\n*(easy way) Transform the last P partition into a L (which again expands E automatically) and add a new L into the U space.\n-- Note: copying partitions can take a lot of time, depending on their data size! \n-- Note: the system (life) partition(s) (= partitions which are in use by the system) cannot be changed while the system is in use. Changes are being stored as jobs which will be executed during the next boot. Therefore (under Windows) the partitioning program needs to be installed.\n-- WARNING: any operation in progress MUST NOT be interrupted or a complete loss of the partition can occur!!!\n-- Note: Moving partitions by copying and deleting the source should not be done in a single session. Do this in two session. If something goes wrong while copying you will still have the original partition.\nIf you want to use new partitions with both Windows and Linux I strongly recommend to format it with NTFS under Windows. Linux is capable of reading and writing NTFS but Windows is not even able to recognize Linux type partitions (reiser, ext2/3/4, etc.) – not even their boundaries. Here you must be careful under Windows: it claims these partitions as (continuously) unallocated space! Do not believe Windows! Windows is mean! [:smirk:]\nIf you have a GPT type disk, be careful: you must not change the boot  partition (at beginning), the mirror/backup partition (at end) and the Windows partition! On the last point I am not really sure, but I once did that on a system with one big continuous partition and after that the system was damaged and had to be low level partitioned! That was more than just embarrassing …\nBut I guess if you already have unallocated space it should work without problems as GPT disks don't have this 4 primary partitions limit.\nHowsoever, for compatibility reasons I recommend MBR disks as GPT disks are quite difficult to handle. M$ just wants to force users to only use (and buy) their products, so they make things as complicated as can be for that no one will understand how to deal with it. On MBR – of course with a piece of skills and a disk editor – you can edit/adjust the MBR itself if needed. But honestly: DON'T DO THAT AT HOME, KIDS !!! ;-)\nAh, one last thing before you start:\nBACKUP YOUR DATA !!!\nYou will wimp like a sissy if you loose them …\n\nA: OK. I could take a lot of confusion from the later comments.\nFirst of all: DON'T DELETE ANY OF YOUR REMAINING PARTITIONS !!!\nIt was already unnecessary to delete the data partition as you will need it back again.\nYour picture shows that you most likely have a legacy/MBR HDD setting. \nThe first partition keeps the Windows recovery copy and hardware tools backup. This is typically for pre-installed Windows systems and you will need it for Windows system repairs and/or re-installations of Windows. You could move this one to the end of the disk (as a logical partition), but Windows is quite grumpy on that and again this step needs more skills to help Windows finding it back (Note: don't just do it without recording its GUID !!! – if needed I can help on that). Actually I think it is really stupid to put this one at the beginning of a HDD because it is nearly never needed and consumes the best performance place on the disk.  The second partition is typically used as boot partition (marked \"active\") with the Windows Boot Manager (BCD) and the recovery console (an emergency Windows repair environment) installed.  And your third partition is of course your Windows OS system partition (always \"C:\"). I presume you moved your data there as it is also unnecessarily huge.\nFor your needs and partition situation you only can add an extended partition with logical ones inside (in this order):\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux Swap (type: SWAP – size of your RAM, but at least 4GB – that should suit most of anybody's needs) \n\n*Linux OS / Lubuntu (type: ext4 – ~10-12 GB)\n\n*if you like you can add an extra ext4 data/programs partition (\"/home\") for security issues (~ 4GB)  This way you can keep personal data and program settings if you have to overwrite Lubuntu.\n\n*additional data partition (type: NTFS – size rest of the disk) This is also needed for security/backup/recovery issues: If something goes wrong with \"C:\" your data are safe here! \n\n\nThe NTFS partitions can also be used by Linux OS's. Unfortunately the SWAP and extX ones will be \"invisible\" for Windows (s.a.)\nTo add those Linux partitions you will need to add them under Linux/Lubuntu (with GParted as described) as Windows – and therefore any Windows tool – is unable to format anything else but M$ partition types (FAT12/FAT16/VFAT/FAT32/NTFS)! On the other hand it is the best way to format these partition under Windows. \n So use your Lubuntu Life CD to configure the partitions (including NTFS – but format it later under Windows 7) as described.\nBut the real pain – after installation of an additional non-Windows OS – is to get the Windows Boot Manager (BCD) back to work! You won't come around to step through 2 (both) boot managers each boot to the \"foreign\" OS!\nAs you have just one HDD AND you have to install Lubuntu into an unbootable logical partition, dual boot becomes quite difficult and you should follow these steps:\nDuring installation of Lubuntu you will be asked where to install GRUB (or what  ever Lubuntu's boot manager is). You will have to install it to the boot partition (your 2nd 100MB one) as your new Lubuntu partition is a logical one and therefore not bootable.\nTrouble is that installing GRUB here overwrites the boot sector so that Windows isn't able to find its BCD which then cannot be modified further more if needed.\nBut during installation of GRUB (and later after kernel updates) it will search your HDD's for other OS's and add them automatically to the boot menu. Here it should find back BCD on the mentioned boot partition and add it.\nNow your first boot manager is GRUB. From here you can select \"Windows 7\" which then (should) start the Windows Boot Manager which then boots Windows 7.\nThere is another way, but this is much more complicated and as long as you do not need to repair Windows it will work. In latter case – to shorten this – use Lubuntu and ask me again ;-)\n", "Q: Is there a way to enable debug inspector on Ubuntu 16.04 (Unity) I would like to know if it's possible to enable the debug inspector for the latest version of Ubuntu.

Please, any idea can be helpful.\n\n\nA: I used to have a similar problem. For the black background problem and the change in Unity theme, this post solve my problem:\n\nI finally figured out what caused this problem. At some point in time,\n  somehow I'd done something wrong with my gtk-3 settings. Remove the\n  folder via\nrm -r ~/.config/gtk-3.0\nand then logging out and in again solved my problem. Now all the themes look fine again.\n\nThen my icons were even larger than yours, but recover the default theme configuration. I know this sounds kind of weird, but I managed to change the size of the icons by open a folder (any folder) with files inside (any type of files) and keep pressing Ctrl + Mouse Scroll, this change the size for all files inside and outside the folder. \nSometimes best solutions are the easiest.\n", "Q: Unable to establish a network connection during installation. Ubuntu 16.04 mini I'm trying to install Ubuntu 16.04 using the mini.iso but I'm having issues connecting to my network.\nI get to the point where it asks to configure the network and it asks me to select an interface.

It fails on key exchange with the router even though all the wpa key is correct.\nI then tried the Ethernet route. I enabled Internet sharing from my iMac (also tried from my macbook) and attempted to establish a connection. It fails on Configuring network with DHCP.\nI've tried multiple cables to no avail.

I had to uncomment force_color_prompt=yes in ~/.bashrc to make the geen colour appear\n\nA: I ran into this issue when I accidentally deleted my ~/.bashrc file. Changing the Profile Preferences as stated in a comment above did not work. Since I completely lost my ~/.bashrc file, I simply copied /etc/skel/.bashrc to ~/.bashrc. After a logout and login, my terminal colors were back to normal.\nOne could also look at /etc/skel/.bashrc to see if anything related to color is missing from their ~/.bashrc file.\nThis may not be the solution to OP's exact problem but I hope it helps somebody.\n\nA: I think you delete your .bashrc file, so you can use this command:\ncp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/\n\n\nA: It might also have to do with color_prompt variable which is defined in the ~/.bashrc file. The block responsible for defining the color scheme is :\nif [ \"$color_prompt\" = yes ]; then\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\nelse\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\nfi\n\nJust try peeking at its value by adding echo $color_prompt before the above block. If it is not \"yes\", then now you can overwrite the value as @plettech has suggested.\nAlso, just running source ~/.bashrc can sometimes help as well.\n\nA: Open up ~/.bashrc\nAnd enter on a line by itself:\ncolor_prompt=yes\n\nworked for me\n", "Q: xenial: remmina unable to connect via rdp to win 10 vdi Remmina (supplied host name, userid, pw, domain, security=rdp) gives the subject response.\nAlso, per other posts, xfreerdp gives the following response:\nexpected PDU_TYPE_DEMAND_ACTIVE 0001, got 0007\nERRINFO_SERVER_INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGES (0x00000009):\nThe user cannot connect to the server due to insufficient access privileges.\nexpected PDU_TYPE_DEMAND_ACTIVE 0001, got 0007\nSSL_read: I/O error: Success (0)\n\nAlso, I tried rdesktop, but that simply hangs with no error report AFAIK.\nAny suggestion for connecting to a Win 10 vdi from xenial appreciated.\n\nA: Below is the script I use to connect to vdiW10 machine, it works for windows 7 as well for me:  \nxfreerdp /v:<remote machine name> /u:<username> /p:$(zenity \\\n--entry \\\n--title=\"Domain Password\" \\\n--text=\"Enter your _password:\" \\\n--hide-text) /d:<domain> /f /cert-ignore /microphone:sys:alsa /sound:sys:alsa +auto-reconnect /g:<gateway address>;  \n\nUpdate your info and paste it in the terminal, it working for 14.04 and 16.04 LTS.\n\nA: Besides updating to the latest version of Remmina and dependents, my sys admin added access to additional resources on the server side.

Since Win2k Windows needs to boot with the BCD or it can't find itself. \nStupid? – Yes … \nAs wtkd said, you will need to repair the MBR with an original installation disc, which then overwrtes the MBR again for booting into BCD.\nAfter that you will not be able to boot into Linux.\nBut you'll have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*fix the MBR for Windows  install a BCD editor  try to add a Linux boot option (this is really complicated but not impossible) – if GRUB is on the system volume, you'll have to select this volume– if not, see next option:\n\n*boot into Linux  install GRUB again but this time install GRUB into the (Linux) system volume  Nevertheless the MBR will be overwritten again, so you will have to fix Windows again as described.\n\n\nIf you have a second HDD you can use a workaround for this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leave the Windows boot volume untouched (after repair!).\n\n*Install GRUB to the second HDD's boot (=active) partition.  This partition can be tiny (~50-100MB) and anywhere on the HDD as long as it is marked \"active\". But for faster booting it should be near the beginning of the disk.\n\n*Go to your BIOS and change the boot disk option to that second HDD.\n\n*Update GRUB.  That way it will add Windows (actually the BCD) to its menu and if selected it just switches back to the first HDD's boot volume, where BCD will be loaded.\n\n\nThe trouble herein is that you cannot edit the BCD unless BIOS boots from this HDD. Thou – if you can manage to add a boot entry in BCD for Linux – you are free to decide from which HDD to boot. Howsoever it is not to avoid to have to boot through two boot managers.\nSo changing something here can really make you nuts. ;-)\n", "Q: Cairo-Dock weather applet not working I have searched high and low for the config file to change the server for the weather applet.

They are conflicting each other most of the times. Unless ALSA is specifically required by an app or hardware I recommend using only Pulse (it's newer and better).\nFirst, remove alsa completely by opening a Terminal window and typing:  \nsudo apt-get remove --purge alsa  \n\nSecondly install Pulse:  \nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\npavucontrol is the graphical interface for Pulse, but it will install Pulse completely (as its dependencies).  \nAnd finally, type:  \ngksu pavucontrol  \n\nA Pulse window should come up with many tabs and options. Make sure the inputs and outputs matches your connection (hdmi, usb, headphones, etc), and make sure Pulse is using the correct audio card (on-board, dedicated, external usb/hdmi device, etc). E.g. When connecting laptop to large screens via hdmi, Pulse might detect the hdmi audio card as external output device with specific brand (not necessary the same as vendor brand). If so, you must choose that external card as output to make audio work.  \nBe aware that Ubuntu doesn't support hdmi hot-plugging! After disconnecting hdmi device, Pulse (or ALSA) will not fall-back to previous settings. You have to change the settings (again) and then restart the Pulse audio service by log out + log in in order to make things work again.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem in Lubuntu. \nOpen volume control and you'll see Playback, Recording, Output Devices, Input Devices and Configuration. Go to Configuration tab and change the built in audio profile to:Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output+Analog Stereo Input. If you can't find that option in there then maybe you need to have Jack retasking of HDA Intel sound cards installed.\nI found it by searching for \"alsa\" in synaptic package manager and then I didn't know what I needed so I thought I'd install everything labeled \"alsa\". After installing all the alsa tools from synaptic you're gonna end up with a bunch of new tools under sound & video in your start menu. I had to use hdajackretask for intel sound cards but you might find the same for other cards. You definitely need alsa-tools-gui to have the hdajackretask tool in sound and video.\n\nA: alsa-utils still needed for keyboard shortcuts.\nAfter removing alsa and installing pulseaudio, the sound was working.\nThe keyboard shortcuts for volume-control were then no longer working. I had to install alsa-utils and then they were working.\n\nA: I had the same problem with a fresh install of Lubuntu 16.04.\nFirst I installed pulseaudio and pavucontrol with 'sudo apt-get install pulseaudio pavucontrol`\nThis didn't seem to help at all although I got the nice pavucontrol app.\nThen it dawned on me to check my groups with the command groups and discovered I wasn't a member of the audio group which means I'm not allowed to use audio. lubuntu doesn't appear to setup that group by default. You can resolve this simply with the command sudo usermod -a -G audio username where username is your username.

So for example, if I was on the login screen and I clicked between my username and the Guest user, the wallpaper would change to either the same wallpaper that was on my Desktop, or the \"default\" wallpaper for guest.\nIn an attempt to disable the Guest user, I ran this command:\necho allow-guest=false | sudo tee -a /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf\n\nHowever, now that I've done this, the Ubuntu login screen no longer matches the wallpaper that's on my Desktop, it's just stuck on the default one.\nI tried going back to this file and removing the \"allow-guest=false\" line altogether, but this hasn't changed anything. The Guest account is re-enabled, but the wallpaper on the login screen still isn't matching my Desktop wallpaper.\nI've found many posts on how to make the Login and Desktop wallpapers different, but I want it to go back to the default behavior where the Login wallpaper matches my Desktop wallpaper. I can't seem to find any posts on this. Is there a conf file somewhere that may have gotten messed up? I'm tempted to just reinstall Ubuntu but surely there's a much simpler fix...\nUPDATE:\nI just wiped and reinstalled Ubuntu, and remounted /home (/home is kept on a separate partition), and now a slightly different version of the issue is happening. If I use one of the built-in Ubuntu wallpapers, everything works as it's supposed to. However, if I use a wallpaper from ~/Pictures, then the issue resurfaces. The login screen changes back to the ugly default one. I feel like there's gotta be a setting or config file somewhere that's causing the problem. Could it be something in /home?\nUPDATE 2:\nSomeone on reddit suggested changing the wallpaper from Firefox. This works, if I change the background from Firefox then both the Desktop and Login wallpapers match like they're supposed to. So that means it's gotta be some sort of permissions and/or groups related thing at this point, right?\nAlso just noticed that this created a file in /home called Firefox_wallpaper.png, so if LightDM has access to that, maybe the problem isn't my /home folder, but with my ~/Pictures or ~/Pictures/Wallpapers folders... hmm...\n\nA: I used a pretty ugly workaround, but it gets the job done. Copy your desktop wallpaper into /usr/share/backgrounds, then change its name to warty-final-ubuntu.png, which should be the name of the current default login wallpaper. (If you want to keep the original, just change its name first to avoid it being overwritten.) Your desktop and login wallpaper should now match.\n", "Q: Help Ubuntu and Windows won't shutdown I've decided to install Ubuntu 16.04 along with Windows 10 on my Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series. Now both OS's can't shut down properly.\nWhat is looks like is that all processes are killed during the process but it never powers off completely unless I long press the power button. Then Ubuntu splash screen freezes at some point and on Windows the screen goes dark as if it had worked but since I can only turn on the laptop again after long pressing, it has the same problem.\nAfter doing some search, a few solutions involved changing the definition of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT on /etc/default/grub.

When part 2 does its computations, it creates a directory for iteration 1, and then stores the first iteration of computations A,B,C, and D in subdirectories.\nI'd like to \"invert\" the second directory structure to be like the first, since rerunning the original script with the directory fix will take too long, and my post-processing code that should otherwise work for part 2 already handles part 1's structure.\nThat is, path/to/second/1/A should become path/to/second/A/1, containing the files that were previously 1/A. Is there a simple way to achieve this?\nTo complicate matters with making temporary directories, while I used [A,B,C,D]  and [1,2,3,4,5] in my example for clarity, the directories for both hierarchies are just numbers and  definitely have name collisions (that is, things like 10/10 exist).\n\nA: The question is actually to rename all dirs named with an integer, by a capital with the corresponding index(+1) from the alphabet, and vice versa:\n1 -> A\n\nwhile e.g.\nC -> 3\n\nAssuming you have no more than 26 folders on a level (number of letters in the alphabet) , the question is not that complicated, but we need to take into account a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*We need to rename the directories from bottom to top, since moving directories inside meanwhile renamed directories will fail.\n\n*Since you mention possible name clashes, we need to do the renaming in two runs:\n\n\n*\n\n*rename the dirs, adding a non-sense, unique string to prevent name clashes\n\n*remove the string after all renaming took place\n\n\n\nThat is exactly what the script below does:\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport string\nimport shutil\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nreorg = sys.argv[1]\n\nchars = list(string.ascii_uppercase)\nnums = [str(i+1) for i, c in enumerate(chars)]\n\ntempstring = \"_temp1234\"\n\n# first step: rename from bottom to top\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(reorg, topdown = False):\n    for dr in dirs:\n        tempname = None\n        if dr in chars:\n            tempname = str(chars.index(dr)+1)+tempstring\n        elif dr in nums:\n            tempname = chars[nums.index(dr)]+tempstring\n        if tempname:\n             print(dr, tempname)\n             shutil.move(root+\"/\"+dr, root+\"/\"+tempname)\n\n# second step: remove the temporary string\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(reorg, topdown = False):\n    for dr in dirs:\n        if tempstring in dr:\n            shutil.move(root+\"/\"+dr, root+\"/\"+dr.replace(tempstring, \"\"))\n\nTo use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as reorg.py\n\n*Run it with the targeted directory as argument:\npython3 /path/to/reorg.py /path/to/second\n\nAs always, please first try on a sample.\n\nA: This should do what you want in bash:\n#!/bin/bash\nmkdir -p /path-to-second-new/{A,B,C,D}\nfor i in [1,2,3,4,5]\ndo \n    for j in [A,B,C,D]\n    do\n        cp -v /path-to-second/\"$i\"/\"$j\" /path-to-second-new/\"$j\"/\"$i\"\n    done\ndone\n\nYour normal structure should then be in /path-to-second-new/ and your initial structure untouched in /path-to-second/.\n\nA: I was facing the same problem recently in a situation where it was not practical to list all folders manually. Wanting to use a bash script, I came up with the following:\nfor a in */; do\n    for b in $a/*/; do\n        dir=${b##*//}\n        mkdir -p $dir$a\n        mv $a$dir* $dir$a\n    done\n    rm -rf $a\ndone\n\nThis dynamically grabs the folder names, creates the new hierarchy, moves all files and removes the old folders.\nExtracting the second-level folder uses a bit of a hack. All directory names $a will end in / (e.g. folder1/). In the second for-loop I append another slash after $a (the first / in $a/*/), so each entry $b will look like folder1//folder2/. This double slash is ignored by Unix, so I can filter out the directory name by cutting away everything up to and including this double slash with dir=${b##*//}.\n", "Q: Installation on a ZFS filesystem missing in the installer There is no ZFS file system option while creating file system but as per release note it supports ZFS.

I've seen other weird stuff like GParted reports 2 of the partitions his guide creates (/dev/sda2 & /dev/sda9) as unknown.   I opened a bug with GParted thinking it might be a problem with it but the GParted Dev's are starting to convince me otherwise.\nI had also found the URL you mentioned \nHOWTO install Ubuntu 16.04 to a Native ZFS Root Filesystem\nI have not tried that one yet.\nThe ONLY official Ubuntu documentation regarding creation of a ZFS striped pool (versus using raidz) is this:\nUbuntu Wiki - ZFS\nHowever, the instructions there for creating a striped pool use commands that are contradicted by the URL you posted:\nUbuntu's Wiki says to used disk ID's  sdX  (ie sda, sdb, sdc, sdd)\nwhereas the Github documentation I followed (reference #1) specifically says in section 2.2:\n\nAlways use the long /dev/disk/by-id/* aliases with ZFS. Using the\n  /dev/sd* device nodes directly can cause sporadic import failures,\n  especially on systems that have more than one storage pool\n\nSo I'm not sure which is correct.  You & I would assume that we should follow Canonical/Ubuntu's own documentation.   Yet the zfsonlinux github guides differ in many ways from what the Ubuntu Documentation states.\nI may go back to BTRFS raid10 until ZFSonlinux & Ubuntu mature a bit more as fighting documentation like this is too time consuming to trial & error everything... when I'd rather just be doing work.

Just prior to this error I got an error \"attempt to read or write outside disk hd0\".\nThe last time I rebooted it there was another error involving disk access which caused the boot process to drop down to the (initramfs) prompt.  That seemed to have been resolved by executing the recommended fsck and accepting all of the fixes it recommended.\nAll of this trouble started after upgrading the system to 16.04 LTS.\nProbably relevant in all this is I'm running zfs mirroring two 3TB hard drives housing the /home content.  However, / is on its own drive along with the boot partition.\nI've been running with this disk set up for several months without any disk errors until the upgrade to 16.04 LTS.\nI was able to use my system again by falling back from 4.4.0-22, to kernel version 4.4.0-21 via the Grub 2 advanced menu option.  It then fell down to (intramfs) prompting me to do the fsck fixes again, which I did.  Upon reboot after fixes I had to, again, fall down to Grub 2's advanced menu option and fall back to 4.4.0-21.  If I tried to boot into the most recent update of the kernel (4.4.0-22) it gave me the \"attempt to read or write outside disk hd0\" again.\nI was still having difficulty with apt, but that went away when I disabled Google's chrome repo.\nI was then able to run the software update successfully.

Just press F2 or move mouse to top menu. But there is no menu on ubuntu 16.04 and press F2 can't change the title. What should I do?\n\nA: A lot of programs will overwrite the title so you can't rely on the title being fixed or not duplicated by other windows. This is especially so with remote ssh sessions in a gnome-terminal. It still helps a lot but its not reliable enough for window managers to do matching against (which is why I think they removed it. (addition by Amias Channer)) so this ability has been taken out with the newest gnome-terminal, however there is still a possibility to change the title, you can do it by command. To achieve this easily edit your ~/.bashrc file and add the following lines:\n# function to set terminal title\nfunction set-title(){\n  if [[ -z \"$ORIG\" ]]; then\n    ORIG=\"$PS1\"\n  fi\n  TITLE=\"\\[\\e]2;$*\\a\\]\"\n  PS1=\"${ORIG}${TITLE}\"\n}\n\nWith this you then can set the title of your terminal window by simply using the command set-title <name you want to set it to>. This is possible due to ANSI escape codes so any program can output them regardless of where the code is run. That's what the \\e and \\a bits do. (addition by Amias Channer).\nThe solution I found here and using it myself since I run on 16.04 LTS.\n\nA: This is the function I use in my ~/.bashrc file:\nfunction termtitle() { PS1=\"${PS1/\\\\u@\\\\h: \\\\w/$@}\"; }\n\nAfter adding it (or changing it) you must resource your file:\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nTo use it type something like:\ntermtitle Special Projects\n\nAfter changing the title once, you must resource to change it again:\n. ~/.bashrc\ntermtitle My new title\n\n\nA: Videonauth's solution is bash-specific, meaning that if you use some other shell (such as korn shell or c shell or mksh or tcsh), it won't work. It also sets title via editing the PS1 prompt ( which for some reason has effect on the title in bash). Here's for example gnome-terminal with mksh:\n\nWhat I personally use is this:\nsetTitle() {\n    echo -e \"\\033]0;$@\\007\" \n}\n\nThis command uses escape sequences and is shell-agnostic , meaning this works in shells other than bash. Small downside is that you will need to know ASCII escape sequences if you want to tweak this. \n", "Q: copy a file from PC to thumb drive I have a question about the Ubuntu file system.\n    copy a file from PC to thumb drive. when file copy process is done(File Operations frame is off) , I unplug the thumb drive. and I found the file is not in the thumb drive, but if  I wait for a couple seconds, and then unplug the thumb drive. the file is in the thumb drive. why is there this status happened?\nwhen File Operations frame is off, does it not mean the coping process finishes?\nthe file format of thumb drive is NTFS.\nThanks,\nDerek\n\nA: Its because nautilus the file manager has some issues with writing data to USB sticks, its a known issue that it takes ages to sync the data to the disk. \nIf you need it faster you can use the command line , if you open a gnome-terminal and type cp then drop the file you want to copy on to the terminal and its fully qualified and quoted name will appear , just type the location you want the file to go to and press enter.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Black Screen when waking from suspend My computer displays a black screen on waking from suspend/hibernate. \nThis problem was present on 14.04, but was solved when I changed to a proprietary driver (NVIDIA).

The black screen used to happen to me, until I decided to sacrifice the necessary hard drive space for Suspend-to-Disk (hibernation).\nYour swap partition needs to be at least as big as your RAM size.\nThis is covered in the The Official Ubuntu Swap FAQ:\n\nHibernation (suspend-to-disk) The hibernation feature (suspend-to-disk) writes out the contents of RAM to the swap partition before turning off the machine. Therefore, your swap partition should be at least as big as your RAM size. The hibernation implementation currently used in Ubuntu, swsusp, needs a swap or suspend partition. It cannot use a swap file on an active file system.\n\nHere's a table of example swap partitions, relative to RAM size, taken from The Official Ubuntu Swap FAQ.

I do not have the rights to install anything on the remote machine.\n\nA: You can use the sshfs protocol. This allows you to mount any remote file system that you have permissions to over the SSH protocol easily.\nsudo apt-get install sshfs\nmkdir ~/Remote\nsshfs user@remotehost:/path/to/remote/folder ~/Remote\n\nIt will ask you for your SSH credentials if you aren't set-up with public-key authentication. Then you can open it up in your local Nautilus or any other file manager, as well as work with the files in the terminal. Also note that the mkdir line is only needed the first time you mount. After the first time mounting, all you need to do is:\nsshfs user@remotehost:/path/to/remote/folder ~/Remote\n\nWhen you are done:\nsudo umount /home/<USER>/Remote\n\nWhile it is mounted, you will have the same permissions as whichever user you connected through SSH as. So, if you mount a folder where your SSH user only has read access, you will only have read access.\n\nA: Two methods worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Solution of steeldriver (see the comment under the question):\n'Connect to Server' in local nautilus to connect to the remote system\n\n*Similar solution but in the terminal:\nOpen the terminal (Alt+Ctrl+T) locally and run: nautilus sftp://username@server:/path/to/folder or even better nohup nautilus sftp://username@server:/path/to/folder & to keep it running even when the terminal is closed.\n\n", "Q: lmsensors doesn't detect my fan.

Like many others users, I need to remove files/kernels to increase space because I'm getting the error message that says I can't update because I have don't have enough space in /boot. I've searched for months, and I've found many answers that are similar to each other, but most are not applicable to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, or the instructions are not beginner-friendly. Ubuntu-tweak is no longer supported by the dev, and I don't know if anyone else is picking that up. I found Synaptic Package Manager, so I'm studying that for now, but I'd like to know if there are any other programs that serve a similar purpose. Is there anything else out there? (I'd welcome updated info for command-line for 14.04 LTS as well.) Thanks for your input.\n\nA: I'd recommend letting apt handle this for you, using the command:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThat should do everything you need. Once the process is complete, it's worthwhile checking the filesystem locations that Zanna has mentioned in her answer.\nOn a sidenote, I prefer to keep at least one old kernel version that I know works, just incase the current kernel suddenly stops working. I'm probably just being paranoid, but it's nice to have one to revert to.\n\nA: I agree with @Arronical that autoremove does everything you want. In the interest of getting to know your system better, you could do all the work that autoremove does yourself. Start by opening a terminal and typing\nuname -r\n\nWrite it down & for whatever you love most, do not hurt anything with that release number, or you will nuke yourself. And in general,  type carefully and check what you entered before sudo rming anything ;)\nI recommend always keeping at least 1 'spare' kernel that I know works well installed, in case of bugs (or just wanting to fiddle around)\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image\n\nto identify kernels currently installed, then purge:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-x.x.x-x-generic\n\nreplacing x with the correct numbers for the release you want to remove\nsudo update-grub\n\nwhich seems to happen automatically when purging anyway.

Is there any way i can flash it back to android if touch is this broken, or is there a way i can reflash a working version back to my phone?\n\nA: If you're able to get to access the preboot menu, you ought to be able to reset your device in either direction.\nIf you were interested in keeping Touch on your device, I've found that reinstalling the OS loads the most recent version with all OTA updates. I had trouble with Touch on my Nexus 7 where attempts to install OTA updates would result in an error upon reboot but continually offer the OTA update and reinstalling fixed that issue.\nSince you can access your preboot menu, you can simply follow the official instructions given at https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/phone/devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices/#install-ubuntu for installing Touch to your device. I don't believe the Nexus 5 has ever been an official device so you've probably gone through this before but just a reminder that you will need to specify the ubuntu-device-flash script with the --server=\"<url>\" and --device=<board name> parameters.\nI'd hope that Ubuntu would keep that information online since it is the offical instructions but, just in case, the steps you ought to go through are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the device to your PC via USB cable and get to the preboot menu.\n\n*Run the command ubuntu-device-flash --server=\"https://system-image.ubports.com\" touch --channel=ubuntu-touch/stable --device=hammerhead --bootstrap from the terminal.\n\n*Wait until the reboot is over.\n\n\nThat should be it; fairly painless.\nIf that doesn't work or you want to reinstall Android, you could follow the below steps (and then go through the steps you took the first time to install Touch, if you wanted to reinstall that):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the factory image you want to install on your device; in general, aim for the one that came on your device when you bought it but installing the most up-to-date version of Android to my Nexus 7 didn't seem to harm it, any.\n\n*Connect the device to your PC via USB cable and get to the preboot menu.\n\n*Extract the factory image you downloaded in step 1 to your computer and go into the extracted folder via a terminal.\n\n*On Windows, run the file “flash-all.bat”; on Mac, run the file “flash-all.sh”; on Linux, run the file “flash-all.sh”.\n\n*Wait until finished; the device should reboot – at the end –, automatically.\n\n", "Q: Key repeat command in 16.04 14.04 commnad:\n\"dconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/keyboard/repeat true\"\n\ndoesn't work in 16.04.\nUnfortuantely in game that I play command\nxset r off\n\nalso doesn't work.\nIs there a command line to disable keyrepeat as it is annoying to have to go to settings menu everytime?\n\nA: You need to set this key to false:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard repeat false\n\nThe same via dconf:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/peripherals/keyboard/repeat false\n\n", "Q: Can't give write permissions to /root?

But for some reason Jenkins is insisting on writing and reading from the roots home directory. If you know immediately why it is doing that and how to stop, I will gladly look at it. But for now, as much as it goes against my better judgement, I need to give jenkins write permissions to /root.\nOn a safety note, there is nothing in /root that I have not put there myself.\nThis is what I am running (initially logged in as root):\n~# chmod o=rwx /root\n~# sudo su jenkins\n/root$ touch test\ntouch: cannot touch 'test': Permission denied\n/root$ cd .pip/\n/root/.pip$ touch test\n/root/.pip$ ls\npip.conf  pip.log  test\n\nSo this is the weird thing.\nI have already given read/write permissions to the subfolders within /root which works fine.

It is annoying since it overlaps the \"X\" to exit from whatever application at full screen.\nThe command\nunity --reset-icons \n\ndoes not solve it.\n\nA: It's a bug. AFAIK, it's caused by a Qt update for 16.04 that doesn't work for 14.04.  In the bug report, a user called awnz proposed a workaround: downgrading to 2.0.2 version (https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/4828#issuecomment-219307594). It works for me.\nTo downgrade the owncloud client, you have to compile the older version from the source. Here are some instructions to do so. Please, let me know if this workaround works for you too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the current client:\n\n\nsudo apt-get remove owncloud-client\n\n\n*Install some dependences:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev doxygen cmake\nsudo apt-get build-dep owncloud-client\n\n\n*Download source of 2.0.2 version:\n\n\nwget https://github.com/owncloud/client/archive/2.0.2.zip\n\n\n*Extract the zip file:\n\n\nmkdir ~/.client-2.0.2\nunzip 2.0.2.zip -d ~/.client-2.0.2\ncd ~/.client-2.0.2\n\n\n*Configure the client build:\n\n\ncmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ../.client-2.0.2\n\n\n*Install:\n\n\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\n*Finally, you have to remove the owncloud repository from your sources to prevent further updates.\n\n\nAs the owncloud developers will fix the bug soon, this should be just a temporary solution. When the fix is released, you have to uninstall the old version and install the new one using the official repo. \nUninstalling:\ncd ~/.client-2.0.2\nsudo make uninstall \n", "Q: FTP account for just one directory Background information:\nI'm using Serverpilot to manage my Ubuntu server which doesn't provide any FTP service. \n\n\n*\n\n*There is a user: serverpilot \n\n*With the home directory: /srv/users/serverpilot/ \n\n*And there is a website running in this directory: /srv/users/serverpilot/apps/website/public/. \n\n\nWhat I want:\nNow I would like to have a FTP account which can only read and write to this directory: /srv/users/serverpilot/apps/website/public/ftpdir/.\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've installed vsftpd: sudo apt-get install vsftpd\n\n*Created a new user with that directory as home: sudo useradd -m -d /srv/users/serverpilot/apps/website/public/ftpdir ftpuser (wich is probably not a good idea to have a home directory of a user in another users home directory)\n\n*I've changed the password with sudo passwd ftpuser\n\n*Edited the default vsftpd configuration with sudo vi /etc/vsftpd.conf\n\n\n*\n\n*local_enable=YES so the ftpuser can be used as ftp login\n\n*write_enable=YES the user is able to write\n\n*chroot_local_user=YES can't access anything outside it's home dir\n\n*pam_service_name=ftp because I was getting a 530 Login incorrect error\n\n\n*And opened my firewall with: sudo ufw allow 21/tcp\nThe problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Other users beside the ftpuser can also be used as FTP login. I just want to have 1 ftp user and not allow other system users to use FTP.\n\n*The ftpuser can also SSH into the server.\n\n*I'm getting a 553 error: could not create file error when trying to upload a file, to fix this I came across this question: https://askubuntu.com/a/320186 but I don't think this is the right way because the file should be owned by the serverpilot user, not the ftpuser user. The website running under the serverpilot user should proces the uploaded files.\n\n\nHow I've solved it before:\nIn the past on another server I've changed the directory ownership and after adding these extra vsftpd configuration options it was finally working:\nfile_open_mode=0775\nlocal_umask=022\nallow_writeable_chroot=YES\npam_service_name=vsftpd\n\nBut on that server I had problems with processing the uploaded files because of the ownership, so there I'm using the file_get_contents() PHP function to get the files over the web instead of direct access them on the server which isn't that nice.\nThe final question:\nHow can I simply have 1 ftp login which can read and write to a directory in a users home directory where the ownership stays on the user where the home directory is from?\n\nA: vsftpd doesn't support limit users but proftpd is more powerfull and has an option in configuration file (proftpd.conf) to limit login to some user like this:\n<Limit LOGIN>\nAllowUser barb\nAllowUser dave\nAllowGroup ftpuser\nDenyAll\n</Limit>\n\nEdit\n\n\n*\n\n*for your first problem the solution is as above.  \n\n*second problem also can solve by adding DenyUsers    ftpuser to /etc/ssh/sshd_config  \n\n*and third problem can solve by adding ftpuser to the group of serverpilot and add serverpilot to the group of ftpuser. also you must change permission of folder /srv/users/serverpilot/apps/website/public/ftpdir to 775.  \n\n\nRemember that folder /srv/users/serverpilot/ must have 755 permission.\n\nA: local_enable=YES is what is enabling the other users to login, you should add your user to the explict user list instead\nfrom the manual:\nlocal_enable\nControls whether local logins are permitted or not. If enabled,       normal user accounts in /etc/passwd (or wherever your PAM config references) may be used to log in. This must be enable for any non-anonymous login to work, including virtual users.\nDefault: NO\n\nuserlist_file\nThis option is the name of the file loaded when the userlist_enable option is active.\nDefault: /etc/vsftpd.user_list\n\nTo sort your permissions issues enable the SITE CHMOD command and get your ftp client to use it \nchmod_enable\nWhen enabled, allows use of the SITE CHMOD command. NOTE! This only applies to local users. Anonymous users never get to use SITE CHMOD.\nDefault: YES\n\n\nA: You can use pure-ftpd 's PureDB function to create a ftp login only for the pure-ftpd service. \n", "Q: How to configure power managment with tlp?

There  are a lot of questions about why shutdown and reboot require root privileges. There are many good answers available too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do we need to be root in terminal for shutdown and restart?\n\n*Why does reboot and poweroff require root privileges?\n\n*How does the power button shut the computer down without root permission?\nBut there is someting I don't understand : If being able to reboot or shutdown without root privileges in a multiuser system is a very bad idea ... then why is this possible in Ubuntu 16.04?\nWhen I type poweroff or reboot in a terminal and hit Enter, it indeed shuts down/reboots!\nIt is okay for me when poweroff and reboot don't require root privileges ... but why does suspend need root privileges? \n When I type suspend in a terminal and hit Enter, it doesn't suspend, instead it gets stuck ... and when I run pm-suspend, It requires sudo.\n\nA: For me, both poweroff nor reboot needs a password on Ubuntu 16.04 .\nHowever, for this to occur, I had to create a user account called \"foo\", for example, and then ssh to localhost as either that user or as myself.  When I do this, I do need to authenticate myself.  It seems to recognize another user is logged in.  \nFor example, I get this message:\nUser foo is logged in on sshd.\nPlease retry operation after closing inhibitors and logging out other users.\nAlternatively, ignore inhibitors and users with 'systemctl reboot -i'.\n\nPresumably, it's \"smart\" enough to realize when there is in fact another user logged in.\n(I agree with you that it would be nice to always authenticate as root.  Sometimes, no other user is logged in, but an important process is running in background performing some kind of calculation.)\nEdit:  Just tried myself.  If I'm logged in as foo, I need to authenticate myself (who is in the sudo group).  If I reboot as myself with foo still logged in, I have to type systemctl reboot -i without a password.  I presume the difference is that the system knows I'm in the sudo group.\nEdit 2:  As noted by Severus Tux, systemctl suspend -i behaved similar to systemctl reboot -i from the previous edit.\n", "Q: How do I test an application in Ubuntu, without affecting the system?

I just got a new laptop that has an Intel Celeron Quad-Core processor of 1.83 GHz. On the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS website, they say the recommended minimum processor requirements are of 2.5 GHz.

Should I install 16.04 or 14.04? Thanks.\n\nA: It depends on what sort of experience you are looking for. 16.04 is the current LTS release. However it has only been live for 3 weeks so it is pretty buggy, particularly if you are using a laptop.\nIf you want all the latest features and dont mind spending hours sorting out issues choose 16.04. If you just want an OS that works choose 14.04\nYour hardware will run either just fine.\n\nA: You will have no performance issues with either version, but 16.04 is the current LTS or Long Term Support version and will be supported for 5 years.  14.04 now has limited hardware, backports, and software support since it doesn't make sense to spend effort writing new stuff for an old version of the operating system.\nGo with the current LTS version, 16.04.\nSince you are running 4GB of RAM, if you do not plan to upgrade beyond that you should consider running the 32bit version.  It doesn't include the PAE extensions that allow the kernel to address larger memory sizes making it a little bit more efficient.  I suggest trying it out first since you seem to be concerned about performance, and you can just reinstall the standard 64bit version later if you want to compare the two.\nYou can get it here.\n", "Q: Where is the shared folder in Remmina?

However, I want to also use a flash drive for extra storage. In that case, what would my terminal command be to access my flash drive (for this example, assume flash drive name is \"MYDRIVE\") \nThank you!\n\nA: It depends, but you can easily find out...\nFrom GUI\n...by right-clicking on any of the files or folders inside the drive, and choose > Properties (\"Eigenschappen\" in Dutch), in nautilus:\n\n\nAs you can see, the directory is\n/media/jacob/My Passport\n\nNote that in commands, you need to fix the (possible) space:\n/media/jacob/'My Passport'\n\nFrom cli\nrun:\nlsblk | grep '<drive_name>' | awk -F'part '  '{ print $2 }'\n\nexample:\n$ lsblk | grep 'My Passport' | awk -F'part ' '{ print $2 }'\n\noutputs:\n/media/jacob/My Passport\n\nAgain, note that in commands, you need to fix the (possible) space.\nCD to the directory in one step\ncd \"$(lsblk | grep '<drive_name>' | awk -F'part ' '{ print $2 }')\"\n\nWhere <drive_name> (of course) is the name of your drive.\n\nA: To figure out where your flash drive is mounted, you can use the command lsblk.  Example output:\ntheone@jakku:~$ lsblk\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 232.9G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0  39.2M  0 part \n├─sda2   8:2    0   753M  0 part \n├─sda3   8:3    0   139G  0 part /media/theone/EE4601124600DD69\n├─sda4   8:4    0     1K  0 part \n└─sda5   8:5    0  93.1G  0 part /\nsr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom  \nloop0    7:0    0  64.7M  0 loop /snap/ubuntu-core/109\nloop1    7:1    0   6.3M  0 loop /snap/hangups/1\n\nAs you can see, it lists all attached devices and their mount points. Then, all you would have to do is cd /your/flash/mountpoint. For example, if I wanted to access my Windows partition for some reason, I could do cd /media/theone/EE4601124600DD69. If your flash drive is listed, but not mounted, you can also do mount -o gid=1000,uid=1000 /dev/sdXY /media/user/mountpoint where X is is the dev letter (sda, sdb, etc) and Y is the partition number.\nIf you're coming from Windows, you might be used to old structure of each disk being assigned a \"drive\". However, everything is a file in Linux. Therefore, even external storage devices can be accessed as \"files\" stemming down from the root directory.\n\nA: Physical disks are named by sd(a,b,c,...) \nsd = Sata disk\na = first disk \nb = second disk\netc...\nI hope you understood up to here now you should know which one is your harddisk\nafter that you should mount your Disk if it is not mounted automatically if it is mounted you can find it's mount point by type \"df -h\" in output search for mountpoint column of your disk you can access or cd to your Disk from it's mount point if it is not mounted you can mount it manually for mounting a disk you should:\nfirst create a directory to mount you disk into that for example I create it on my desktop named as mount\nthen mount your disk in to that by \nsudo mount /dev/sd.. /home/UserName/Desktop/mount\nfirst dot (.) is for your hard disk specification and second dot is for specifying your file system or partition.\n", "Q: Using Microsoft Designer Keyboard and Mouse with ubuntu 16.04 (on a dell xps 13) I have the new developer edition of the Dell XPS 13, which comes with ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Might be that this version's kernel supports the 460 hardware better. You can use a live DVD/USB to try it. (The kernel and the \"X\" server handling input devices of 16.10 will eventually appear in 16.04 as an LTS point release.)\nAlso, I've found installing the Touchpad-Indicator app helps.

Why am I getting this error?\nThank you.\n\nA: chmod u+x program_name. Then execute it.\nIf that does not work, copy the program from the USB device to a native volume on the system. Then chmod u+x program_name on the local copy and execute that.\nUnix and Unix-like systems generally will not execute a program unless it is marked with permission to execute. The way you copied the file from one system to another (or mounted an external volume) may have turned off execute permission (as a safety feature). The command chmod u+x name adds permission for the user that owns the file to execute it.\nThat command only changes the permissions associated with the file; it does not change the security controls associated with the entire volume. If it is security controls on the volume that are interfering with execution, then you can remount the volume with options to allow execution. However, copying the file to a local volume may be a quicker and easier solution.\n", "Q: hard/soft block by rfkill I have a trouble with my wifi hardware.

I currently have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed on my hard disk. However, my biggest issue is with flash drives. I have all of my .cpp files on my flash drive, but when I go to compile them in the terminal, I am presented with:\nbash./ permission denied\nAnd through some research, I have found out that this is because my flash drive has not been manually mounted, leaving me without permission to access these files. Now I have a few questions:\n1) What is the purpose of manually mounting a flash drive\n2) And how can I go about mounting my flash drive so that I have the permission to write new .cpp files, and also compile them.\nThank you!\n\nA: Read this article if you are unfamiliar with mounting filesytems in linux.\nIn Linux, if you, or any other program (CodeBlocks in this case) has to run a file, the file should have executable permissions. These functionalities are not supported by the fat32 filesystem. Normally if it was a filesystem that supports this feature, you could have give the file executable permission by using chmod (do a man chmod to know more about it). \nBut in your case, since it is FAT32, you will have mount the partition manually allowing programs to be run from the flash drives.\nWe need to first unmount the partition:\nsudo umount /path/to/mount/point\n\nThen we remount the partition again:\nsudo mount -t vfat -o rw,auto,user,fmask=0022,dmask=0000 /dev/sdx1 /path/to/mount/point\n\nwhere /dev/sdx1 refers to the partition you want to mount and /path/to/mount/point refers to the folder to which you want to mount it.\nYou can get information about the devices that are currently mounted by typing mount in the terminal. The mount command will give you the path/to/mount/point and also the partition you now have to mount (/dev/sdx1). \nIn the output of mount, a line starting with /dev/sdb1 on /boot ... indicates that the partition /dev/sdb1 is mounted at /boot (mount point). \n", "Q: How do I backup computer that wont let me go on windows from usb hard drive with ubuntu?

You will need to boot to this image instead of your hard drive and use Ubuntu to offload you files to another device like a USB drive.  Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop image here.  You will need to create a bootable USB stick or burn it to a CD.\n\n*Insert your shiny new installer media and fire up your machine.  Chances are it will boot to your media automatically.  If not you need to determine what keystroke is needed to select a boot device.\n\n*Let the Ubuntu Live Installer boot up and select \"Try Ubuntu\" from the menu that pops up.\n\n*Connect the device that you want to copy your data to.  It should show up on the desktop as a hard drive icon.\nClick on the file cabinet on the left hand side.  You should see 3 drive entries.\n\nMine is a VM and doesn't have any additional drives attached,  but it should look like that image.  Yours will have 3 drives listed instead of just one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer:  The live Ubuntu OS that you are looking at.\n\n*USB Drive:  The drive you want to copy your files to.\n\n*Windows Drive:  Your broken install that you want to copy from.\n\n\n*Open your Windows drive by double clicking on it, select the files you need to keep, right click and select copy, Right click on your USB Drive and select paste.  You files should start moving over to the USB drive.\n\n\n\nOnce your files are copied over, go ahead and close those windows, double click the \"Install Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\" icon and follow the instructions to install Ubuntu.  Try it.  You'll like it.

I need to list (not count or install) all pending security updates on an Ubuntu 14.04 system.  I've read the post How to create a list of of only security updates with apt-get? and its accepted answer (apt-show-versions | grep upgradeable | grep security) does indeed give me a list.\nHowever, that command lists 62 pending security updates.  /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check tells me that I have 75 pending security updates, but doesn't seem to have a way to list them.  How can I reconcile these two numbers?  Is one of the two commands doing something other than what I want?\n\nA: there must be a way to request how many packages are updatable and how many security updates right now, but if you settle for asking it once a day you can simply read the file /var/lib/update-notifier/updates-available, which seems to be updated daily by the script /etc/cron.daily/update-notifier-common which belongs to the package update-notifier-common\nExample:\n$ sudo cat /var/lib/update-notifier/updates-available\n\n355 packages can be updated.\n1 update is a security update.\n\nTested in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n\n*Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n\n*Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\n\n\nRegards,\n/Ángel\n\nA: sudo apt-get -s --no-download dist-upgrade -V | grep \"^Inst.*security.*$\" | cut -d \" \" -f 2\n\nWith some help from this question\n\nA: The other answers given here do not all list the same security upgrades.\nUbuntu has two standard policies for upgrading packages: apt-get upgrade is more conservative than apt-get dist-upgrade. The latter will generally upgrade more packages, and it may contain security upgrades that the former ignores.\nThe notification shown (by default) upon login is a cached copy of the output of apt-check:\n$ /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check --human-readable\n92 packages can be updated.\n3 updates are security updates.\n\nThese numbers count packages that will be upgraded by apt-get dist-upgrade; you can list these security upgrades as follows:\nsudo apt-get --no-download -s dist-upgrade -V | awk '/^Inst.*security/ {print $2}'\n\nor\napt-get -s dist-upgrade -V | awk '/^Inst.*security/ {print $2}'\n\nTo see just the security upgrades in an apt-get upgrade, do\napt-get -s upgrade -V | awk '/^Inst.*security/ {print $2}'\n\nor\napt list --upgradable\n\nBy default, unattended-upgrades only runs an upgrade, not dist-upgrade.\nThis explains why unattended-upgrades, even when configured to automatically install security upgrades, doesn't always install all security upgrades reported by apt-check.\nAll of these tools use the local package index - so to check the status on the Ubuntu mirror your host is using, first update it with  sudo apt update.\nA mirror can be out of date in principle, so if you want to check at the source, you need to check on Launchpad - at least for packages distributed by Ubuntu.\n\nA: This worked for me:\nsudo unattended-upgrade --dry-run -d 2> /dev/null | awk '/Checking/ { print $2 }'\n\n\nA: If you are just looking to do this quickly once, instead of creating a separate repository and scripting up some automation and all that.

And here, under the Mounte Pointe label, it says the path is /home/myName/newMount\n2) So when I open my home folder, I see the newMount folder, and inside are all the contents of my flash drive. However, when I try to compile a program, it won't let me.

I am guessing that your drive is getting mounted automatically but when you are trying to compile a file on your flash drive you get permission denied. Seems like you may have copied files with root privileges.

I have a laptop with Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04. I would like a quick process to perform nightly backups of the entire hard drive. The ideal scenario would be to plug laptop into a hard drive, boot from either the laptop or hard drive, and run an application which backs-up all changes since the last backup.\n\nA: A good option might be the built-in backup utility, Deja-Dup.  You will have to do a little configuring to make sure all the folders you care about are included, but it provides a straightforward GUI to do so.  Once you are set up, it will do a full backup.  It will then do incremental backups whenever you like.  Every 90 days or so it will do another full backup.\n\nA: I personally use Grsync, which is a GUI wrapper on rsync, to backup my D: drive. You could create a backup rule for each partition and script them to run nightly.\n\nA: To do multiple partition backup, you can use:\nClonezilla.  Its very reliable and stable.\nAlso you can use Bacula.\nBacula is a set of computer programs that permit managing backup, recovery, and verification of computer data across a network of computers of different kinds. Based on Source Forge downloads, Bacula is the most popular Open Source backup program.Bacula \n\nA: You have several options. Considering the disk for storing backup is of same size (or larger) as the source disk and is mounted, then you can use the following tools in the form on a script which runs periodically using cron. Advantage to such cloning for backup is that, if your source hard-drive fails you can simply use the backup drive and it will retain all partitions as such.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using dd from terminal or script\nThis is used to make a copy/duplicate of the whole disk (meaning full physical disk including partitions). \nPro: It is optimized for such cloning purpose. User can specify block size, and other parameters.\nCons: It is slow and the speed optimization needs trying out different block sizes. Also, blank space is also copied.\ndd if=<input_disk> of=<backup_disk or file> bs=2048\nFor example, input disk= /dev/sdx & output disk = /dev/sdy or . Use lsblk in terminal to get the device id. \nAbove example does not show the progress bar. You can use pv in conjunction with dd to get progress bar. This is available here  Progress bar in dd \nLike ,\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdx | pv -s 2G | dd of=/dev/sdy bs=4096\nExplanation: pv will check for time and transfer after every 2 Gb of data moved and report. (You need to install pv before using the above mentioned command.)\n\n*A bash shell script using dd with backup file check and logging option is available here \n(The user needs to edit the backup file path, and source drive ID to use it. It can be set as cron job. )\nRestoring from such a backup image is by following command where  of=new_disk,\ndd if=/path/to/backup.img of=/dev/sdn \n\n\n\n*Using pv from terminal or script\nMakes duplicate of whole disk including partitions. This is faster then dd and uses maximum possible throughput available to the  disks.\n\n\nAfter installation using sudo apt-get install pv you can simply run as,\nsudo pv < /dev/sdx > /dev/sdy\nThis will  clone the disk /dev/sdx  to /dev/sdy\nPS- It is suggested that you run some command with sudo in the terminal before running this, since it will ask for  permission. Also, this does not show progress, and the terminal will be busy for a while depending how big the backup is.\n\n*A bash script using pv to make backup image is available here. \nUser needs to edit the backup file path. Use cronjob to set it up for periodic run. Use crontab -e to run as root.\nRestoring from such a backup image is by following command where  /dev/sdn is the new disk,\npv  < /path/to/backup.img > /dev/sdn\n\nAnother option  is Clonezilla (mentioned by @Mitch)\n", "Q: why I can't install kernel sources from repository I was trying to install VirtualBox in my machine.

Check the current setting (which defaults to disabled):\ncat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nAnd if it disabled (0) then it can be enabled (non persistent) via:\necho 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nor (still non persistent) via:\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\nFor a persistent setting (after the next re-boot), edit as sudo the file /etc/sysctl.conf and change this line:\n# Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4\n#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\nTo this:\n# Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\n", "Q: mouse focus problem I've just installed Ubuntu Mate 16.04 and am encountering a very annoying problem.\nAfter using the pc for a while:\n\n\n*\n\n*it becomes impossible to change focus to another window by mouse click\n\n*it is still possible to use Alt+Tab to change focus, but the window doesn't react to mouse clicks\n\n*it is not possible to click on desktop buttons (application/places/system) and also it's impossible to move/drag windows  \n\n\nThe really weird thing is that I was previously experiencing the same problems in OpenSuse leap 42 with different desktops (KDE plasma, xfce, icewm). It was very annoying, and that's the main reason why I reinstalled Linux and tried Ubuntu Mate 16. \nI'm starting to suspect that this is bug in recent versions of X.org which is present in any recent distribution.\nI don't think it's a hardware problem (in win7 I have no issue).\nDid anyone see this problem?   Any suggestion or solution?\n\nA: I'm a bit late, but anyway, here's a temporary fix:\nPress CTRL+ALT+F4\nYou should see a terminal - now go back to the graphical environment with CTRL+ALT+F1\n(or F7, depends on your Ubuntu version)\n\nA: I have had an identical problem with mouse focus locked to active window or a part of it. It happened on a fresh install of Xubuntu 18.04. I could not click on top window to set focus to it. Top window remained transparent for mouse pointer so I could highlight the text in window below and click on invisible links. The panel bar became inaccessible, so did the rest of the desktop. Sometimes right clicking would release the focus but it all seemed very random. Changing to TTY and back to GUI wans't helping as other answer suggests. Neither did disabling the touchpad in my laptop. After long research of similar bug reports, I came across this solution and so far so good, it was the fix I was looking for.\nsudo apt install wmctrl\nxfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/click_to_focus -s true \nwmctrl -R WindowName \nxfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/click_to_focus -s false\n\nThe bug report can be found here:\nsource\n\nA: I have had the same issue on Ubuntu 18.04 with a Dell Laptop and a Mad Catz Rat 7 mouse.\nI fixed this issue using the --reassign option of xinput command.\nBeforehands I listed all using xinput --list. This way I got a list of all my input devices and I found the Rat 7 mouse in the tree below the \"Virtual Core Pointer\". In my case the Rat 7 mouse used ID 16 and the Virtual Core Pointer used ID 2.\nThe resulting command to fix the issue for me was:\nxinput --reassign 16 2\n\n", "Q: What happens if you never reboot after a \"reboot required\" and keep \"dist-upgrading\"? This question runs the risk of being silly and I think I know the answer, which is \"nothing\" but I figured I would make extra sure anyway. \nI tend to upgrade my servers doing a dist-upgrade and most of the time I ignore the prompt for rebooting (when a kernel gets upgraded). This happens regardless when you have unattended-upgrades on so I don't see this being a problem.\nQuestion is, \nWhat happens if you never reboot after all these upgrades that prompt you for reboot? \nFurthermore, what happens if one of these upgrades is a security upgrade? Does that mean the system is insecure until a reboot is performed? \n\nA: The reboot is required because the kernel been updated with fixes to security issues.  The fixed kernel can only be loaded on the next boot, hence the reboot is required.   If you don't reboot, your machine will not pick up the kernel security fixes until the next reboot.\n", "Q: Dual GPU (Nvidia + ASPEED) extended desktop configuration help Ubuntu 16.04 I can't seem to find the answer to my configuration problem. \nI have 2 graphic cards, one on the motherboard (aspeed) and one on PCI-E (Nvidia). \nlspci | grep VGA\n04:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM107 [GeForce GTX 750 Ti] (rev a2)\n0a:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ASPEED Technology, Inc.

How to I get Ubuntu to add that GPU to my current X server ?\nThanks!\nPS: I don't have a xorg.conf, I only have xorg.conf.05192016  xorg.conf.nvidia-xconfig-original and xorg.conf.backup, and whenever I make a xorg.conf, it disappears at next reboot.\n\n\n\nA: Here is why:\nAspeed is your onboard GPU, whose driver is not provided by Nvidia. Thus, it not showing up in your Nvidia X server settings should be expected. \n", "Q: How do you use the TTY (without X server) on one screen, and X on the other? While playing around with Ubuntu, I turned off the window manager. Unable to operate the terminal in xserver, I jumped over to a bash command line (Ctrl-Alt-F1), and relaunched lightdm. \nAfter having no results I hit Ctrl-Alt-F1 again, and my two screens (one was turned off) split between xserver and bash! I could put in any command I wanted, and it would affect the xserver as long as I typed DISPLAY=:0 before the command. The only drawback is the keyboard only works for the bash.\nIt got me thinking... Is there a way I could do the above again, but easier and more conventional? (through a command maybe?) It's really neat, and even if it was possibly a glitch, it looked liked it was made to split like this through a setting or something.\nEdit: Here's a solution to the question above:\nDo the above steps (besides closing the window manager XD). This time, the keyboard is actually being shared between X11 and bash! Like the answer says, to turn off the keyboard for the bash, just type Ctrl-Alt-F7 orF8 to go to the display server. In order to use the bash without affecting your desktop,open a text editor so your keystrokes are ignored for the most part. If you are using nano in bash, the shortcut Ctrl-o will trigger \"open\" in gedit.\n\nA: It's probably possible although I never tried.\nIf you have a single video board and that's an NVidia that you use with the NVidia proprietary drivers, then it won't work (and in that case what you saw was just a \"lucky\" side effect of some bug.) This is because they (NVidia) do not \"properly\" divide each video port in a distinct video port.\nHowever, it should be possible with other configurations (2 video boards or 2 ports on a video board with a free driver from Linux) by configuring X11 as one screen per video and/or port. It's actually called a multi-seat configuration. Only that requires having at least two keyboards and two monitors (you probably do not need a second mouse in the console, although it can be nice to have such.)\nBy default the multi-seat will start both systems in lightdm, but you should be able to use Ctrl-Alt-F1 in one or the other. Obviously, I do not think that a standard way of doing things, so it may or may not work as expected. It may very well stop both X11 sessions to consoles... You'll have to play with the settings to see whether you can reach that specific configuration.\nOnce you are done with the console, you can then use Alt-F7 or Alt-F8 to come back to the X11 session.\n", "Q: How to make Network Manager ignore VMware virtual network adapters I'm running Ubuntu 16.04, fully updated.\nThe 2 devices listed that are not being managed didn't show up until I installed VMware Workstation 12.1.1.

The only one remaining is the bridged one, which coincidentally, Network Manager doesn't see or show in the list from the indicator drop-down in the OP.\n", "Q: RDP support in unity Is there any support yet for remote desktop protocol in Ubuntu Desktop yet? - I need to give access to >100 users in an AD domain and I would rather not have to install VNC clients. I know RDP is supported in other desktops but that is not what they want to use.\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 desktop (and several previous versions have as well) comes with Remmina Remote Desktop Client pre-installed, and it supports connecting directly to RDP clients, such as windows. I have used to connect to Windows 7 machines without any difficulty.\nYou could try it out from the livedisk version of Ubuntu Desktop if you want to verify it will work for you.\n", "Q: Provide password to `nmcli con up` in terminal 14.04 I am trying to connect to my VPN using terminal. My VPN password is a TOTP, so cannot save it to the connection conf file. When I try to connect, a dialog appear to enter password. I want to do it in terminal itself as I can generate my TOTP from a script. I just couldn't figure out any way. Is there a way to specify password in command line or send password from command line to the dialog?\n\nA: In case you need to create the password with a script or similar and then pass it to nmcli without storing it on the disk, the following works for me (nmcli 1.30.0) and might be possible to be adapted:\necho vpn.secrets.password:$PW | /usr/bin/nmcli c up $VPN_CON_NAME passwd-file /dev/fd/0\n\nIt unfortunately does not support the standard linux - for standard input...\n\nA: You can set the password using the following command:\nnmcli con mod VPNID vpn.secrets \"password=VPNPASS\"\n\nwhere VPNPASS is the VPN password.\nIn order for this to work, you have to enable the pasword storage option in NetworkManager, as shown in this picture:\n\nI am using Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: You can write-update a password to a seperate file. This works for me:\necho \"vpn.secrets.password:MY_PASSWORD\" > /my/vpn/password\nnmcli con up uuid MY_UUID passwd-file /my/vpn/password\n\n\nA: There is a more elegant and secure way to work around this. Store your password in gnome-keyring:\n~$ sudo apt install libsecret-tools\n~$ secret-tool store --label='vpn' vpn_name your_unique_vpn_name\n\nNow let’s have a script to bring up the vpn. The key to be provided by the way may differ. In my example it is vpn.secrets.cert-pass. The script should be put into ~/bin/.\n#!/bin/sh -e\n\nvpn=your_vpn_connections_name\n\ntmp=$(mktemp)\nchmod 600 $tmp\nprintf \"vpn.secrets.cert-pass:$(secret-tool lookup vpn_name your_unique_vpn_name)\">$tmp\nnmcli c u \"$vpn\" passwd-file $tmp\nrm $tmp\n\n\nA: The latest network-manager in Ubuntu 14.04 is 0.9.8.8 and as you said doesn't support that feature.

It's the per-user configuration file for SSH (and commands based on SSH like scp and sftp). Create it, if it does not exist, and add:\nHost 192.168.0.42\n    User \"User Name Spaces\"\n\nFor example:\nHost localhost\n    User \"foo bar\"\n\nThen:\n$ scp test.txt  localhost:\nfoo bar@localhost's password: \n\n(I don't actually have a user named foo bar, so I couldn't finish the test.)\n\nYou could also create an alias in .ssh/config:\nHost foo\n    Hostname 192.168.0.42\n    User \"User Name Spaces\"\n\nThen you can conveniently do:\nssh foo\nscp file foo:\n\nAnd avoid having to type the whole IP address.\n\nAn alternative, if you have tar available on both ends:\ntar c myfile.txt | ssh \"User Name Spaces\"@192.168.0.42 tar x\n\ntar creates a tar archive, saved to standard output and piped through to SSH, where it becomes the input to tar x, which extracts the archive. You can use options like -C to change the directory (or do so as a shell command before tar: ssh … 'cd foo; tar x). You could also use compression and save a bit on network bandwitdh:\ntar zc myfile.txt | ssh \"User Name Spaces\"@192.168.0.42 tar zx\n\n\nA: I find the -o user= option to be more reliable. It works with spaces and apostrophes. Good to use if the username will be somewhat dynamic.\nFor example:\n\n*\n\n*scp -o user=\"Your Username\" ~/file remote:~/file\n\n*scp -o user=\"O'Neill\" remote:~/file ~/file\n\n*scp -o user=\"${USERNAME_FROM_VARIABLE}\" remote:~/file ~/file\nSource: https://serverfault.com/questions/955058/scp-with-special-username\n", "Q: sudo apt-get update cancelled half way through, now cannot run sudo apt-get update I'm a new user of ubuntu.

But in this special case it seems to be a temporarily problem with the Ubuntu repositories update servers today. When you start the computer, the system searches for updates automatically. When you run sudo apt update manually at the same time you receive this message. Today the reason is different, there seems to be an appstream bug. Even when the update process is not running and you execute sudo apt update the process does not complete successfully and the CPU usage gets stuck on 100%. As a workaround -> disable the xenial-backports repository and run sudo apt update again. Now the error should be gone.

I switched to Ubuntu (64-bit) because I heard it was faster.  So far, it's so much worse.  With autologin it takes 55 seconds.  Without, I get from Grub to my login screen in 35 seconds.  Then after entering my password and hitting ENTER, it takes another 21 seconds to show the desktop.\nAlso should mention that while booting, there is no purple screen at all or Ubuntu splash logo with scrolling dots.\nOnce I'm at my desktop, everything runs fine and fast.  It sleeps and resumes fine etc.  It's just the booting that concerns me.  Since I have a dual-boot system, I tend to reboot into Windows 10 to do certain things.  Booting into Win10 is super fast, but booting back into Ubuntu takes way too long.\nI'm using the exact same partition I was before (which I formatted for a fresh install of Ubuntu).\nI've been using systemd-analyze to figure out what's causing the delays.  So far I've tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updated Kernel to 4.6\n\n*Disabled NetworkManager-wait-online service\n\n*Disabled Samba-ad-dc service\n\n*Disabled smbd service\n\n*Disabled mnbd service\n\n*Disabled and uninstalled apparmor\n\n*Disabled grub-common service\n\n\nHere is the screen I see between the Grub menu and login screen:\n\nI'm aware this is fsck and it pops up pretty much right away after the Grub menu.  I'm also aware that because it comes up right away, that it's not really taking much time.  But that screen is what I see until the login screen comes up.  No splash screen with scolling dots on the bottom, no purple screen.\nHere is a link to my dmesg output\nMy dmesg for some reason only goes to 25 seconds.\nAlso, I plotted my boot with systemd-analyze plot > file.svg and end up with times that don't make sense.  And actually, the chart only goes to 20 seconds, yet it takes much longer for my login screen to come up.  Here's my output (I linked the image instead of posting it because of the size of the image):\nsystemd-analyze output\nOutput of systemd-analyze blame (below)\n\nOutput of systemd-analyze critical-chain (below)\n\nHere is the output of fdisk -l (below)\n\nLike I said before, I'm using the same partitions as before (sdb6 for /, sdb3 for /home, sdb5 for swap).

I do think however now, that this may be a problem with the DM or the DE...  But going through all the logs are getting me nowhere so far.\n\nA: I've abandoned the version I was trying to run after countless attempts to speed it up, and downgraded to Ubuntu Gnome 14.04.  I had stripped away so much of Ubuntu 16.04 that it was starting to cause problems.\nSwitching to Gnome 14.04 made everything boot and run so much faster.  My boot time went from 55 seconds with Unity 16.04 to 20 seconds with Gnome 14.04.\nIn the end, no matter what I did, I could not speed anything up any faster with 16.04.  The solution for me was a downgrade, even running on newer hardware.  \nTo confirm this, I decided to also downgrade my PC from Kubuntu 16.04 to Gnome 14.04.  It's a quad-core i7 @ 4Ghz with 16GB RAM and SSD drives.  My boot time was originally ~8 seconds and it's now ~5 seconds.\n\nA: Updating Drivers fixed the performance issues for me. Look here:\nKubuntu 16.04 Driver Manager broken\n\nA: I dont know if it will solve your issue, but we see that after upgrading to 16.04. Booting time was much longer, and we had some boot issues in which the computer didn't start. This was solved after removing plymouth and all splash screen related.\n", "Q: Installation is retrieving file 56 of 56, for AGES! How long am I going to have to wait for this to finish installing?\n\nA: You might try disabling networking and restarting the installation. \nI experienced the same problem you described while installing Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS (64-bit) in Hyper-V under Windows 10. The installation got to \"Retrieving file 56 of 56\" and nothing further happened. \nThe solution for me was to temporarily disable networking. Since I was installing in Hyper-V, it was just a matter of stopping the VM, disabling networking in Hyper-V Manager's Settings, and restarting the VM. Upon restarting, the Ubuntu installer detected an existing copy of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as being installed (from the prior unfinished attempt), and I selected the option to erase the existing instance of the OS and re-install it. This time the installer successfully completed the installation, ending with the expected message that the system must be restarted. I turned networking back on in Hyper-V Manager settings and restarted. A fully working copy of Ubuntu is now up and running for me. Hope this helps. \n\nA: I had the exact problem while working on a dual boot Windows 7 / Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS (64-bit) installation.  I also resolved the issue by disabling my internet connection and redoing the install. I think it might have been because I had the option to \"check for updates during installation\" checked. when I re-ran the installation (overwriting the prior unfinished installation that the installer detected) without that update box checked, it worked just fine.\n\nA: I was trying a complete install on a desktop.  After reading the previous posts I unplugged the network cable from the machine, which prevented me from selecting the check for updates box. The install went smoothly after that. \n", "Q: How do I uninstall Ubuntu and go back to what I had before I installed it? I bought the book \" The art of exploitation 2nd edition\" and it came with the disk that I loaded onto my computer. I installed it not knowing that I would have this trouble booting windows and all my files back up to what I had previously. Can someone please help??\n\nA: I'm assuming from your silence, that you don't want to admit to a folly, so I'm deleting unnanswered comments, doing a summarization and hopefully closing the case, which is one of those cases of:\n\nDon't try this at home, kids! (or pre-learn how to do it safely)\n\n\nThat \"LiveCD\" from that peculiar \"The art of exploitation\" book actually is fully functional in \"live\" usage and does not require any installations. They are even clearly stating that in f.e. Amazon's description (and presumably multiple times in that book itself):\n\nThe included LiveCD provides a complete Linux programming and debugging environment - all without modifying your current operating system.\n\nWhy would you even want to install that permanently if you just started learning? Personally I would even disconnect all of my media and networks before booting any \"hacker's\" compilations on any of my machines!\nYou have performed Ubuntu 7.04 installation. I know, because out of extreme curiousity I tried it myself on one my virtual M$'s that had volunteered for such experiment after backup-copying it's entire virtual drive.\nEverything looks orderly in that installation. It gives 3 options for partitioning:\n\n\n*\n\n*resize (default, attempt to keep old system & stuff alive)\n\n*use entire disk (would completely crush your status quo)\n\n*manual (you probably wouldn't even make it through that one)\n\n\nIt even has a normal warning \"You cannot undo this operation\". I performed a \"resize\" and it normally installed itself and I can now dual-boot without having need to fix anything (like specially configured boot for my \"Crazy 8\"). Both systems works fine, no files lost and actually no problems at all (at least noticable ones).\nDid you perhaps choose that second, nuclear method? The only rescue after that involves performing \"data recovery\" using specialized not-so-easy-to-use software or paying large amount of money to some even more specialized entity that would do that for you (or asking a bona-fide hacker-friend for a favour). And after such retrieval-attemp, you would get your data mostly fragmented, unusable or even non-existing at all (overwritten). If you have a large drive, then chances for restoring more complete files are higher.\nIf you however choose that other, the only sane method for such cases as yours, I believe that it's still possible to un-do it by removing Linux's partition & extending your M$ one (f.e. by using some other live Linux system). Most trouble would give you restoring original Windows's boot manager (BOOTMGR). I don't even know if that's achievable... easier to just live with GRUB from now on (naturally after properly re-configuring it).\nSorry to say that, but you have \"exploited yourself\"! (and it's as hilarious as that sounds)\nFor a finish, I'll quote you from my first comment:\n\n... I would completely discourage playing a \"hacker\" xD\n\n\nA: Insert the \"exploitation\" livecd, boot it up to desktop, open GParted, erase ext partition and swap partition. Reboot. Insert the Windows instalation cd and choose Repair Windows option. Wait for the process to finish.  Reboot again.

Can't boot Windows I have an HP Pavilion dv 9543 cl. I decided that I wanted to update Win Vista to Win 8 several years ago, but did not know how to remove grub 2, so I naively decided to simply remove the Ubuntu partition and assumed I would be able to recover function of the Master Boot function. My shortsighted approach has left my laptop in limbo.

Is it feasible to search and delete that code? Is there an alternative approach such as physical removal of the second hard drive (Disk 1 which became Disk 0)? Should the CMOS on the motherboard be replaced?\n\nA: You have deleted the Ubuntu partition, but the computer is still booting Grub, which cannot find the necessary boot files on the partition. You should change the boot options so that it boots Windows. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access your BIOS. This is sometimes done by tapping F12, F10, or ESC during boot. Look up instructions for your computer model if you're not sure.\n\n*Change the boot priority so that the Windows Boot Manager is at the top and Ubuntu at the bottom. Or just entirely remove Ubuntu as a boot option.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the Windows Boot Manager is not present, and if I remember right, you will need a Windows repair/install disk to reinstall it, but ask over at a Windows support forum like SuperUser to be sure.\n\n\n\nThe computer should then boot Windows as it did before you installed Ubuntu.\nThen once you can boot Windows you can remove all the traces of Ubuntu.

I am aware that the basic tty TERM has 16 colors, and it's okay to rotate the colors if more than 16 terminals are open. Will the solution also work when I connect through Putty, tmux or screen.\nMy idea is to write a shell script and place it in .bashrc which detects the new terminal session the user has opened and increment a global counter from \\e[0;31m[ to \\e[0;47m[. How to detect the number of opened terminals by the user?\n\nA: If you really need to get the number of terminal you have open, go for counting the files owned by you under /dev/pts (although this might include ones opened by background processes, not by graphical terminal emulators). Alternatively, count the number of child processes of your terminal emulator(s), as shown by Jacob in the first line of his response.\nAvoid relying on who's output, and looking for gnome-pty-helper processes, since these don't work in newer gnome-terminal versions.\nNote that nowadays pretty much all graphical terminal emulators (including putty) and multiplexers (screen, tmux) support 256 colors. You can get really nice colored prompts if you use this palette.\nMy recommendation for a very simple solution is to base the color on the current tty line's number. E.g. process the output of the tty command to take the number only and derive the color from that. A certain tty line number is only given to one terminal at a time, you'd have to close that terminal first before the same line number is reissued by the kernel. This, combined with 256 colors, automatically guarantees that you won't see the same color twice at a given time (and even with 16 colors it'd give a quite even distribution). No need for maintaining a global counter, and no need for counting terminals or processes.\n\nA: In a single user situation, if we take the example of xterm, we can simply count the number of pids of xterm; xterm creates a separate pid for each and every window.\ngnome-terminal however runs a single pid, but the good news is that it creates a child process for each and every window and/or tab. we can retrieve these child processes by the command:\npgrep -P <pid_of_gnome-terminal>\n\nThere are however a few complications to deal with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reading your question, we may assume, that user in this case is actually owner of the x-session. Usually we can simply use the $USER -variable, but this might not match the currently logged in user of $DISPLAY.\n\n*In a multi-user situation, pids belonging to the (either which) terminal application, do not necessarily belong to the current $DISPLAY. We need to split off only the  relevant pids and child-pids.\n\n*On Unity (15.10 or lower), if a second user logs in, an additional process is started (gnome-pty-helper), which appears as a child process in gnome-terminal, but the process (obviously) has no window or tab. On Mate, the process exists anyway.\nIn short\nTo count the number of tabs and/or windows of a terminal application, we need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*See if we run a terminal application which has multiple pids or a single pid on one $DISPLAY (x-session)\n\n*From the running processes, split off only the relevant pids, running on this $DISPLAY\n\n*If the application runs child-processes for its pid (for windows/tabs), see if gnome-pty-helper runs, to correct the number.\n\n\nThis can very well be scripted however, to reliably find the number of currently opened windows and/or tabs. \nThe script\nIn the script below, the targeted terminal application is used as an argument. The script works on many terminals I tested it on. An exception is Tilda at this moment.\nAn example\n\n\n*\n\n*I have two users logged in, one (not the current) with two gnome-terminal windows, one (the one in the image) with three gnome-terminal windows, and two xterm windows.\n\n\n\nThe command: \n/path/to/get_terms.sh gnome-terminal\n\noutputs:\n3\n\nwhile\n/path/to/get_terms.sh xterm\n\noutputs:\n2\n\nThe script\n#!/bin/bash\n\nterminal=$1\n\n# get the user running the current x-session\nusername=$(who | grep $DISPLAY | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')\n# get the pid of the terminal for the current user\nuserpid=$(pgrep -u $username $terminal)\n# check what type the terminal is (multi pid/single pid)\nnpids=\"$(echo \"$userpid\" | wc -w)\"\n# in case of a single pid, count the children\nif [ \"$npids\" -eq 1 ]; then\n  # check if gnome-pty-helper runs (starts when multiple users are logged in)\n  ptpid=$(pgrep gnome-pty-helpe)\n  # get number of child- procs\n  let \"orig = $( pgrep -P $(pgrep -u $username $terminal) | wc -w )\" \n  # if pty-helper runs, correct the number of child procs\n  if [ -n \"$ptpid\" ] && [ -n \"$userpid\" ]; then\n    let \"n_terms = $orig-1\"; else let \"n_terms = $orig\"\n  fi\n  # if no child procs run, n-terminals = n-counted pids (difference Mate <> Unity)\n  if [ \"$n_terms\" -eq 0 ]; then echo $orig; else echo $n_terms; fi\n# in case of multiple pids, count the pids\nelif [ \"$npids\" -gt 1 ]; then echo $npids\nfi\n\nTo use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as get_terms.sh, make it executable and run it by the command:\n/path/to/get_terms.sh <terminal_application>\n\n\nA: An awk way:\nwho | awk 'BEGIN{count=0}{ if(NR!=1){count++} }END{print count}'\n\nExplanation:\nIn above 1 liner command, awk is used to find the count of terminal.\nInside awk program, it is just checking the number of lines return by who command - 1.\n\nA: Simple way may be also just to run System Monitor (if started from Terminal you must write gnome-system-monitor) and under \"Processes\" tab arrange the running processes by Name and than count the number of occurrences of Bash in the listing (they will be all together if you arrange by name, so it's easy to count). \nNote that you must look for Bash and not for Gnome Terminal if you want to see the number of opened terminals by user. Once you open a Terminal Gnome Terminal will also appear in the Processes list but will remain only one even if more Terminals are opened. The \"View\" button in System Monitor allows you to set which processes to see, eg.

I'll let you know if I find a workaround.\nEdit**\nI found this error didn't happen if you uncheck the options to download updates and restricted extras. Hopefully it works for you also.\nI also find that uefi doesn't give me the option to boot into linux. So I choose \"legacy\" from the bios to install ubuntu, and then also choose it from the bios when I want to use ubuntu. I'm sure it's not the recommended way to get dual boot happening, but it works for me. \n\nA: I had the same problem on my very standard desktop pc.(i5 3570k on Gigabyte Z77 motherboard using the cpu integrated graphics with a usb wifi dongle). I tried ensuring that the updates and extras options were not selected, then changing the default server, both without success. The answer for me was to install without any internet connection.

There is no excessive cpu activity though. Can you guys hint me why it happens?\n\nA: It's a bug. Look at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/appstream/+bug/1579712/. The problem is that the bug is affecting the update process, so you can't update. Catch 22. \nSo to solve it you have to manually install the broken packages.\nIf the system tried to do the update, you'll probably have a rogue appstreamcli running --- using 100% of your CPU; it will also have a lock held on the apt database, which will block any upgrade attempt. \nTo solve it, you have to kill the rogue appstreamcli ---  ypu can find its PID by running top, and then \nsudo kill <PID here>\n\nThe second step is to manually update the failing packages as in: (Notice: on a 64-bit system; if you run a 32 bit system you must change the links accordingly, using i386 in lieu of amd64)\ncd /tmp && mkdir asfix\ncd asfix\nwget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/appstream_0.9.4-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb\nwget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libappstream3_0.9.4-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nas posted in comment #24 of the bug report. \nNow you can update your system; once you successfully do that, you can safely remove the downloaded packages. \nNice bug. \nBTW --- this is the same as appstreamcli hanging with 100% CPU usage during update  and apt-get is stuck at \"Fetched XXKb in XXsec\" \n", "Q: Can't find wifi on Ubuntu phone Got my new meizu pro 5 yesterday. I live in an apartment building with a lot of different WiFi access points. Mine isn't listed.\nOn my ubuntu laptop I can find my WiFi access point in a the 'more networks' section. The list simply seems to long. And a 'more networks'  section is not provided in ubuntu phone. The list is not ordened according to signal strength and varies from time to time.\nI tried to make my network hidden and then connect to a hidden network without success.\nI'm sitting right next to my WiFi access point btw.\nAnyone know how to fix this?\nThanks in advance!\nTinus\n\nA: Found the solution myself.\nAs I stated earlier there are a lot of WiFi access points. For that reason I decided to use WiFi channel 13 instead of channel 1, because I figured it must be congested since it is a default channel used by a lot of manufacturers.\nAs you might know channel congestion might cause network collision or lost of WiFi signal.\nApparently Ubuntu orders the WiFi access point according to channel number used, rather then access point name (SSID).\nI switched to channel 1 and sure enough there was my access point listed.\nAfter accessing my network I changed it back to 13. Aaaaaand it's gone! Same with channel 12.\nAfter I changed it to channel 11 it picked up my access point and connected automatically.\nMission success!\n", "Q: How can I set mac address using the command line in Ubuntu 16.04?

Why is it installed? What is it doing? There's another question about AppStream that has —for better or worse— focussed on what seems to be a particular bug in AppStream but that left me realising I don't have a clue what this thing actually is.\nman appstreamcli (the application taking the CPU off the deep end) throws  some technical jargon at the confusion:\n\nappstreamcli is a small helper tool to work with AppStream metadata and access the AppStream component index from the command-line. The AppStream\n         component index contains a list of all available software components for your distribution, matched to their package names. It is generated using\n         AppStream XML or Debian DEP-11 data, which is provided by your distributor.\n\nSo... What is it actually there for? Do all desktop (and their related package managers) use it?  \nBy all of which I actually mean: what will break when I tear this out with my teeth?\n\nA: The AppStream project page adds a little more jargon but does go onto say:\n\nIt provides the foundation to build software-center applications, by providing metadata necessary for an application-centric view on package repositories. AppStream additionally provides specifications for things like an unified software metadata database, screenshot services and various other things needed to create user-friendly application-centers for (Linux) distributions.\n\nSo this is basically what the new software centres are using to get their data from, rather than directly from Apt. appstreamcli refresh (the thing people are freaking out about using all the CPU) is the process that runs after an apt update to regenerate its own data. As mentioned in the question, there appears to be a bug here.\nYou can see what needs it based on the reverse dependencies:\n$ apt rdepends appstream\nappstream\nReverse Depends:\n  Breaks: libapt-pkg5.0 (<< 0.9.0-3~)\n  Depends: plasma-discover\n  Depends: plasma-discover\n  Depends: gnome-software\n  Depends: plasma-discover\n  Depends: isenkram-cli\n  Recommends: check-all-the-things\n  Depends: appstream-index (>= 0.9.4-1)\n  Recommends: libappstreamqt1 (>= 0.9.4-1)\n  Suggests: appstream-doc\n  Depends: gnome-software\n\nSo at a base level to answer \"What will break [...]?\", ^^ that stuff.\nBoth Gnome's and KDE's software tools depend on it today. More may in the future. Most of these indirect package manager are just \"recommends\" so if you only ever use apt or tools that only use Apt's package library directly (too many to list), you can get rid of it without removing the whole desktop environment.\nYou can simulate a removal with apt -s remove appstream:\n$ apt -s remove appstream\nNOTE: This is only a simulation!\n      apt-get needs root privileges for real execution.\n      Keep also in mind that locking is deactivated,\n      so don't depend on the relevance to the real current situation!\nReading package lists...

After reading the other post on this issue, I tried the various suggestions.

The grub rescue prompt is almost immediately displayed after the ASUS splash screen.\nI'm dead in the water now.  Is there any way I can find the grub partition, or boot off the Windows MBR?  Any help is greatly appreciated.\nBTW, this machine was once used primarily as a Linux device but was taken over by a windows user.

I'm reviewing them for future reference.\nIn the meantime, I did get Windows 10 to finally successfully install. The reason the recovery disks were not working was because the boot order had been changed in this machine to search disk before DVD drive and grub rescue was always grabbing control.  I have never had a machine with this ordering so I was surprised that the DVD wasn't being accessed.  Once this ordering was corrected in the boot prom, I was able to use the recommended repairs from the boot-repair-disk discusses here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nAfter running this repair the machine booted directly into Windows and completed the upgrade.  The one disappointment was that even though this was a GRUB repair tool, GRUB seems to be gone now, along with access to the old Ubuntu installation.  I've rebooted a number of times and tried to drop into the GRUB menu during boot using the ESC key, but Windows always boots immediately, so I do not think GRUB is active any longer.  This was fine with me in this case, but it would be a problem for others attempting the upgrade.\nI don't know if this makes a difference, but this was a machine with a native Windows 7 installation which had Linux added later.  Possibly the results would vary on a native Linux machine that was partitioned for Windows.\n", "Q: How to associate a file with a newly installed app on tablet?

These desktop files are also used in the defaults.list, where the format is:\nhandlerType/fileMetaType=desktopentry.desktop\nhandlerType is the type of handler, e.g a binary file will have \"application\" because it will be specific to an application, while a common mp4 file would have \"video\" as the mime type, a text file \"text\", and so on. The fileMetaType is the specific file type, such as a pdf of binary format which would have the fileMetaType of \"pdf\". desktopentry.desktop is simply the desktop entry of the file you're using to open that application.

Eventually you can create a new partition on the bigger SD card ending up with two partitions.\nWhat you should do is to format the bigger SD card with full capacity and copy over the files form the smaller SD card.\n\nA: This appears to be an OS X question due to the disk names, but here is what you need to do:\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk4\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk4 of=/dev/disk2 bs=1m\n\nThe last line should work on Ubuntu and probably works on OS X as well.  I just did something similar a couple weeks ago on a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu Mate to rescue a buddy's Windows HDD data to a new drive.  I don't recall having to unmount on Ubuntu, but it took forever to transfer about 150GB.\nYou can then follow the instructions here to resize your new partition to take advantage of the extra space.\nLet me know if this works for you.\n", "Q: Not able to kill Mysql process I was trying to uninstall  mysql using sudo apt-get --purge remove mysql-server but getting following error\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\nSo I prompted to kill all running mysql processes.For this I did  ps -ef | grep mysql and get\nroot      4473     1  0 17:46 ?        00:00:00 /bin/bash /usr/share/mysql/mysql-systemd-start post\nroot      4636  3783  0 17:46 pts/6    00:00:00 grep --color=auto mysql\nroot@viji-Latitude-E5440:~# sudo kill -9 4473\nroot@viji-Latitude-E5440:~# ps -ef | grep mysql\nroot      4672     1  0 17:47 ?        00:00:00 /bin/bash /usr/share/mysql/mysql-systemd-start post\nroot      4745  3783  0 17:47 pts/6    00:00:00 grep --color=auto mysql\n\nI am trying to kill this mysql process but not able to do.\nWhat should I do now?\n\nA: You are entirely able to kill the process, but it seems to be starting itself again. If you notice, the PID is changing each time that you kill it. Something on your system is automatically starting it on your behalf. You have a couple of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Seek and destroy whatever is starting it (usually some sort of web control panel like XAMPP, probably in this case your service manager)\n\n*Boot into a shell and kill it from there (using recovery mode)\n\n\nI prefer the latter, since I don't know how you installed mysql to begin with, but if you did use something similar to XAMPP, it's worth opening the control panel and trying to stop MySQL from within (even if that means re-installing the control panel software).\nIf you want to go with the former, you can try sudo service mysql-server stop and see if after this you can uninstall it.\n", "Q: wifi network list not showing in ubuntu 16.04 Initially I connected to a wifi network, but after an hour I could not find other wifi networks available.

However, the first step is to isolate the cause of the problem.\n\"Boot failure with Kernel 4.x\" implies that your system boots with 2.x or 3.x. However, you write that your workstation also isn't booting with 3.9x. This suggests that your system doesn't boot regardless of the Kernel.\nIf you want to test this, then try installing a system with 2.x or 3.x again. If these also fail, then the cause probably isn't the kernel.\nPossible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware Failure\n\n\nCould be USB media/CD-DVD Drive/Memory/CPU. etc...\n\n\n*\n\n*Bad Install Media (Check MD5 or SHA Checksum)\n\n*BIOS Setting\n\n\nAnother test is try a non-Linux distribution, something like PC-BSD. If this boots, then this suggests that the problem might be related to the Linux kernel. If it doesn't boot, then this suggests hardware failure.\n", "Q: keep memory usage low Ubuntu 16.04 Server guest VM I have an Host Machine running KVM+QEMU and multiple guests.\nAll Guests are running Ubuntu 16.04 (virtual machine installation).\nMy current problem is, that the host memory consumption (via htop) is at over 90%.\nGuestVM1 has 1 GB Memory available. When loggen in, i can see that it only uses about 50 MB. I run sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3 every hour to keep caches low.\nHowever, when i login to the host and check how much memory GuestVM1 is using on the host, htop returns VIRT 1480 MB   RES 809 MB   SHR 1020 MB.\nIs there a way to tell KVM, to use less memory (on the host) if the guest is not using all memory and dynamically assing the memory when needed ?\n\nA: There is no need to drop caches; Linux will cache data as much as it is allowed to, when memory pressure gets too high it will start to discard pages that are no longer useful and write back dirty pages to free up spare memory.  The Linux philosophy is to keep data cached just in case it needs to be accessed again later, and if memory is required it will discard this data for the memory your processes require\n", "Q: Get the name of installed program Interface Down.\nXubuntu.

Maybe that will restore my internet connection.\n\nA: all you need to do is use \nsudo apt-get remove blueman\n\nThis will remove it .. if you want to remove it and any dependent packages which are no longer needed  use \nsudo apt-get remove --auto-remove blueman\n\nThat will do it for you. \n", "Q: regular expressions / pattern matching on ubuntu command line I notice a lot of bash utilities like ls, cp, mv, grep use regular expressions and pattern matching. For instance symbols like * [] {} etc. \nHowever, I find this to be different in some regard to other regular expression tutorials I find on the Internet. Is there a specific standard that these utilities follow or a comprehensive list of shortcuts somewhere? \nThank you \n\nA: While similar, the wildcard patterns that you’re referring to are not regular expressions; they are glob patterns and in this context, shell patterns. They are expanded by the shell itself – not by commands such as ls, cp, etc. Just to clarify, these commands are not actually “bash utilities”; they are programs that can be executed by any shell.\nWhen a command is typed in a shell, the shell parses the tokens (words) and one of the things it does is expand glob patterns into appropriate filenames. In the most common case, these filenames are then provided by the shell as a list of arguments for the command being invoked.\nStandardisation\nThese shell patterns have been standardised for Unix-like operating systems in the POSIX\nspecification: Pattern Matching Notation.\nSome shells (Bash and the Korn shell) go further and extend these patterns to implement extended globs.

Do you see a \"tmpfs\" that is mounted on either /dev/shm or /run/shm? If so, that is your memory being used for that file system.\nIn the past, I have stored frequently accessed files there (Note:  the files are deleted when you reboot).  I don't remember the details about it, but it supposedly adjusts in size as you use memory.  However, I always wondered if I left a file there, whether it will never reclaim that space.  Thus, I gave up doing this.\nIf you search on this site for words like \"RAM disk\", /dev/shm, or /run/shm (the last one is the location used by older versions of Ubuntu), you will find more information.  See for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are \"/run/lock\" and \"/run/shm\" used for?\n\n*How to resize /run (to make /run/shm bigger) properly - and where is it's' size set?\nOr this from another site:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/what-is-devshm-and-its-practical-usage.html\n(I hope this answers your question about where your memory went.

I execute them from the terminal, and viola, everything runs fine.\nRecently I made some desktop launchers for my applications so I don't have to open the terminal to execute them, but found that my applications don't work properly this way because the environment_setup.sh has not been executed.\nHow should I set these variables, so that I can use my applications without the need for a terminal?\n\nA: You should set the environment variables in your ~/.profile. This file is sourced by display managers such as LightDM which start the X server and the rest of the graphical system.\nIt’s also sourced by Bash (as long as ~/.bash_profile doesn’t exist) – and other POSIX shells – for non-graphical, i.e., network and console logins.\nThe Ubuntu Wiki has lots of good information on environment\nvariables.\n\nA: I was using bash.bashrc because I wanted the setup process to be system wide, so putting it in ~/.profile, as Anthony suggested, was not the best solution for me. Additionally the setup script was located on an NFS, so I made symbolic link in /etc/profile.d that pointed to the location of the setup script on the NFS. Works great now!\n", "Q: Netflix auto play - makes my user log off I'm using 14.04. When I'm watching Netflix and it automatically goes to the next episode, my laptop logs off of my user account. So it goes to the screen that you have to enter your password when you're booting up your computer. It also keeps playing the episode - the sound is still coming out and everything, but it's not on the screen because it's just at the log in screen for the computer. It's very annoying to have to get up and log back into my user account every time. \n\nA: In system settings, click on \"Brightness and Lock\", then turn off the LOCK toggle switch.\nIt's locking because the video comes out of fullscreen for a second while switching episodes, and sets off the timer to automatically lock the screen.\nLong explanation : Normally auto lock is prevented while playing fullscreen videos, but it seems the timer is still running, and as soon as the video comes out of fullscreen, the timer comes into effect (which has been running the whole time).  I think this is a bug, because in my opinion, the timer should only start after the fullscreen exits, and not based on the last user input.\n", "Q: How can I install photoshop CS6 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS?

It just turns out apt-get is easy to use by users so they just use it instead of using the higher level managers like aptitude and synaptic.\naptitude is more user friendly because it adds a layer of abstraction away from apt-get, apt-cache etc.., apt-get is more user friendly than dpkg for the same reason. It's really down to user knowledge and what works best for them. aptitude and apt-get use the same repositories. Let it be clear that aptitude does not itself use apt-get apt-cache etc..

I'm currently stepping through everything via the iPXE command line instead of a script. I made sure to build iPXE w/ NFS enabled, and that seems to be working just fine because I can get to the initrd.gz just fine. But I cannot figure out how to tell iPXE what the kernel is; I assumed that the linux file would be the kernel, but when I try to tell iPXE to use that file it throws Exec format error (http://ipxe.org/2e008081).\nTo go in to more detail, here is how the system is set up:\n\n*\n\n*mini.iso is mounted on a QNAP TurboNAS as a shared folder, with guest access enabled over NFS\n\n*New server PXE boots, chain-loads iPXE via TFTP\n\n*I <Ctrl-B> in to the iPXE command line\n\n*initrd nfs://guest@<nfs ip address>/Ubuntu1604Mini/initrd.gz works just fine\n\n*kernel nfs://guest@<nfs ip address>/Ubuntu1604Mini/linux freaks out with above error\n\nI'm having a hard time Googling this question because everything else seems to assume a non net-boot image so all of those instructions assume the presence of the casper directory and casper/vmlinuz but the mini.iso seems to have a very different structure.\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!\nEdit\nIf it's relevant, all of the NFS guest access is read-only.\nEdit 2:\nIt seems that this is actually a UEFI issue. I found in the documentation where the mini.iso isn't set up for booting in to UEFI environments. So I have switched to trying to get this to work via the Ubuntu 16.04 Server .ISO and I'm still having issues; from some cursory web searches it appears that the vmlinuz on Ubuntu 16.04 is not compiled with the EFI Stubs. I found the EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI file, but when I chainload this w/ iPXE it starts trying to find a Netbook image via TFTP so I'm not 100% sure what that's doing or what arguments I can pass it.\n\nA: I had the same issue in a debian live booting on nfs. The ipxe documentation refers to the booting case with bios but not with efi, the solution, as you mention, is related to efi.\nAdd the parameter initrd=initrd_file_name to the imgargs line.\nThe source of this information is: http://forum.ipxe.org/showthread.php?tid=7522\nAlthough I do not find it in the official documentation, but it works for me on efi.\n", "Q: When I plug in earphones or HDMI, I have to manually change the speaker settings Whenever I plug in my earphones or HDMI cord, the speaker settings don't automatically change to output from them.

In order to fix MBR i will boot from live cd to fix it after finishing the install of the other OSes. i have already squeezed the partitions to make space. Ubuntu runs on a total of 50GB. I am stuck with the partitioning.\n Which partitions do i have to leave intact so i could restore the system?\n\nA: When editing partitions you can only expand partitions in front to absorb un-allocated space behind it. You can move partitions forwards or backgrounds. It's best to back up your files before doing the next part.\nIf you boot Ubuntu from a CD or USB there is an app installed, called GParted (I assume you know that because you know to boot it from a CD or USB, but I'll explain it just in case). Run that. I would suggest leaving the recovery partitions alone (I don't know what these are called, I'm not on a Dell computer--Also, those are the ones you should leave alone). These are used for the computer saving OS's if they stop working properly. You can make partitions larger only if they're in the front, so make sure whichever ones you want to use are moved to the front.\nWhen I did this, it took me doing this two or three times before it actually worked, so try a few times before giving up. Good luck! \n", "Q: Is `dpkg-reconfigure --all` still available in 16.04?

In truth, this issue existed prior to the 16.04 upgrade.  When moving files, say a 500MB folder of MP3s, the transfer rate gets as high as 100 KiB/s and then drops to zero every several seconds.  I need a few leads on how to fix this.

Why then is it installed, seemingly by default, on Ubuntu systems?\n\nA: The package was not installed by default in Ubuntu. You installed the Chromium browser, and it requires that package, so it was also installed. Neither the Chromium browser or the extra codecs package for it are installed by default. Their installation is because you installed them.\n\nA: A package can be automatically installed if another package that you manually install depends on it.\nYou can track packages dependencies with aptitude. I've run this on my computer:\n$ aptitude why chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra\ni   ubuntu-restricted-extras Depends    ubuntu-restricted-addons    \ni A ubuntu-restricted-addons Recommends chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra\n\nubuntu-restricted-extras depends on ubuntu-restricted-addons which recommends chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra.

Probably this is why you have it, too.\n", "Q: Create new partition without removing old ones Im installing ubuntu 16.04 as a duelboot with my windows 7. Im setting the partitions manually because that is recommended. I currently have three partitions, all under the device /dev/sda. The windows partition is dev/sda2. I am installing the ubuntu under dev/sda3. Now, the installer tells me that it needs a swap parition to be most secure. \nHowever, I cannot figure out how to create a new partition. The only time \"new partition\" is available is when im selecting /dev/sda, but then it gives me a new warning: all old partitions will be removed (including windows?) So i cant create the duel boot without swap, but i cant create a new partition for swap without wiping the windows, defeating the purpose of a duel book. Classic catch 22.\nIs there some way i can make a new partition without touching the windows? I suppose i may have to free space by resizing, but i cant find any option to resize anything.\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Ubuntu!  There is a rule that a hard disk with a Master Boot Record (MBR) can only have four \"primary\" partitions, or three primary partitions and an \"extended\" partition (which can contain more partitions).    If you need more than four partitions total, you must create an extended partition.  You probably can't create a swap partition because you have three partitions already, and you'll need one more for Ubuntu and one for the swap partition, which makes five, so you'll need an extended partition.\nThere is a program on the Ubuntu DVD or USB stick called Gparted (which stands for graphical partition editor).  It's a great tool for resizing partitions (and creating and deleting them too).\nThe easiest way to solve the problem is to boot to the Ubuntu DVD or USB stick, run Gparted, and resize the Windows partition as necessary to get some free space.  75 GB is enough space for Ubuntu for starters if you have a small disk.  Leave the free space in a contiguous unallocated block.  Then reboot to Windows so that it can run chkdsk, which it runs after you resize its partition, so that you know Windows is happy.  Then boot to the Ubuntu DVD or USB stick and choose the \"install alongside Windows\" option, which will magically appear if there is enough unallocated space on the hard disk.  \"Install alongside Windows\" will automatically create an extended partition as necessary, and an ext4 partition for Ubuntu and a swap partition.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu fails to boot fsck I have searched and searched, and I cannot seem to find the help I'm looking for.

Basically: don't waste your time.\nAlternatively:\nUse another distribution that does not use Unity as UI.\nI've successfully used Lubuntu 14.04\nNot 16.04, because I did it a couple years back. And I think Lubuntu changed their UI, so be warned.\nAnother option is to switch to Gnome, but that switch has to be done completely, without exception... ( Ubuntu will go back to gnome in 2018 anyway )\nI remember trying something like that back when I had my problems, and it did not work well neither...\nThere SEEMS to be an option to uninstall it via this.\nA friend of me is doing that just that right now. I will let you guys know about it.\nBetter:\nUse an image that comes with a different UI engine. Gnome, KDE, Lubuntu are some examples that should work. Lubuntu works for sure, at least in 14.04.\nEDIT:\nSo my friend tried out and said Lubuntu 16.04 does feel a lot faster and more native than his Ubuntu install. But instead of reinstalling everything on Lubuntu, he tried out switching to gnome and followed this guide (mentioned earlier).\nHe said that after switching to gnome and removing Unity, it feels a lot more native.\n\nA: One for people landing from Google (rather than chronic sufferers):\nI observed very poor performance having \"slept\" the Windows 10 host with the VM running. A VM reboot resolved the issue. Hope this helps someone.\n\nA: Some general troubleshooting...\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Unity can use 3D acceleration - it makes a big difference. Run /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p from the terminal and note whether the last line shows Unity 3D supported: yes. If not, enable it in the VM options.\n\n*Check you have given it enough video memory. The default settings in VirtualBox for guests are pretty low. Give it 64MB at least, and 128MB if you can.\n\n*Check screen resolution. No matter what hardware I try, it just can't seem to power my 4K screen at its native resolution (3840 x 2160). Significantly better experience at 1920 x 1080, scaled.\n\n*Check CPU virtualisation settings. If you have, say, a 4-core CPU don't assign all 4 cores to the VM. If you do that, the VM guest will fight the host for resources and the result is that it will actually run slower. Stick to one or two cores. (There's not much difference between 1 and 2 in my experience, but yours may differ).\n\n*Do the same for RAM as for CPU. Don't assign more RAM than you need - ensure the host has enough left for itself. 4GB for Ubuntu desktop seems fine for practically everything I throw at it.\n\n*I've read that people get better speeds on a mechanical hard disk by using a fixed allocation virtual HDD rather than dynamic. In my experience there's no noticeable difference, but perhaps worth mentioning anyway.\n", "Q: NTP without DNS I have a box running ubuntu 10.04 x86 & it's isolated by necessity from a lot of the network.\nIt is blocked from DNS.\nI'd like it to keep accurate time, so I've configured NTP with several servers, all IP addresses.

It works fine.  The failure appears to be related to the values like #S2Platform-Server1 which do require DNS resolution.  It appears you may have commented out servers in /etc/ntp.conf or /etc/default/ntpdate incorrectly.  The comment needs to be at the beginning of the line. \nThe name resolution issue is likely due to the invalid names rather than lack of DNS.  You can disable DNS resolution in /etc/nsswitch.conf, and it won't be attempted by resolver calls.  \n", "Q: How to configure two servers with two charsets on Irssi I like to connect to some IRC servers with different charsets. For example, IRC-Hispano [still] uses ISO-8859-15, and Freenode uses UTF-8.\nI want to use the right charset in every server. In the case of IRC-Hispano it was not easy to configure:\nIn settings > core:\n/set recode_fallback ISO-8859-15\n/set recode_out_default_charset ISO-8859-15\n/set recode_transliterate ON\n/set recode_autodetect_utf8 ON\n/set recode ON\n\nIn settings > fe-common/core:\n/set term_charset UTF-8\n\nWhere should I specify different settings (UTF-8) for Freenode? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I found the solution in a huge search of irssi setups, so I'm gonna post it here. I'm sure it will help others, as well:\nBefore of the settings, define conversions:\nconversions = {\n    \"Hispano\" = \"ISO-8859-15\";\n    \"Freenode\" = \"UTF-8\";\n};\n\nThen we can the defaults in settings > core: \nrecode_out_default_charset = \"UTF-8\";\nrecode_fallback = \"UTF-8\";\nrecode_autodetect_utf8 = \"yes\";\nrecode_transliterate = \"yes\";\nrecode = \"yes\";\n\nFinally, in settings > fe-common/core:\n/set term_charset UTF-8\n\nThis is the default charset of the terminal. I'm using UTF-8 in my terminal (Konsole).\nThere is no documentation about it in the official irssi web page. I could find a very good explanation on this site. As the author explains, we can use commands to define a different charset for every server, channel... For example:\n/recode add freenode/gee ISO-8859-1\n\nIt will define the charset ISO-8859-1 on channel #gee on Freenode.\n", "Q: SD card Mounting I have a 128 GB SSD, and I was looking into external storage devices.

It doesn't require a desktop environment, just some libraries for ALSA, GTK, and X11 support.\nI find it weird that the firefox package doesn't depend on that if Firefox cannot run without it.

I recently switched to Ubuntu from Debian, and am finding it a nice alternative, but I have one constant problem; because I often use μTox, I wish to pin it to the taskbar. I have written a custom .desktop entry and it shows up in the Unity Dash, but because of the way μTox is written, when I click on it in the Dash, it opens first the actual μTox process, but that then hides itself and opens a different window called μTox (Alpha) (version: 0.8.1), meaning I am unable to pin it to the taskbar as it is a child process of the original utox process my .desktop file runs.\nSo how can I pin μTox to the taskbar?\n\nA: It took me a while before I understood what you actually meant, but here is the answer:\nMissing WM_CLASS\nWhen you say:\n\"when I click on it in the Dash, it opens first the actual μTox process, but that then hides itself and opens a different window called μTox (Alpha) (version: 0.8.1)\"\n...it is a small misinterpretation of what is happening; there is no second process, but the launcher you created and the application do not \"meet\" each other in the Unity Launcher. In other words: the home-made launcher does not recognize the window, μTox is calling, as \"his\".\nHow to solve\nYou can simply solve it by including the WM_CLASS to your launcher, so it will correctly recognize the μTox -window:\nStartupWMClass=utox\n\nA simple launcher that worked fine here:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Some Tox\nExec=/home/jacob/Downloads/utox\nType=Application\nStartupWMClass=utox\n\nOf course you need to replace the path in the line Exec=/home/jacob/Downloads/utox\n...But you might want to include an icon.

I have been trying to find a straight answer for this but I can't find it anywhere. Does unattended upgrades for security patches restart services automatically? If so, any way to prevent it from doing so for some packages where is may be very disruptive like postgresql for example? And, is there anywhere in the logs where you can see when a service was restarted last? \n\nA: To answer this question, it first is important to clarify that unattended-upgrades is a service which basically runs an \"apt upgrade\", automatically, on your behalf. If you've ever upgraded a package, you'll notice that many of them trigger actions as part of the process; for instance, if you upgrade rsync you'll notice that the daemon is restarted:\nSetting up rsync (3.1.0-2ubuntu0.2) ...\n   * Restarting rsync daemon rsync                                 [ OK ]\n\nGenerally, well-written debian packages which contain daemons (in other words, running services) will restart those daemons as part of the upgrade; if it doesn't happen for a package you care about, do file a bug (and if you can, provide a fix).\nThere is an important case where this doesn't happen: when instead of upgrading the service itself, you upgrade a system package which it depends on. One example which comes to mind is openssl, which is used by many services which implement SSL support. For those, a manual restart of the service is required, and if you don't know how many or which ones need to be restarted, a reboot solves the problem.\nTo avoid certain packages from being upgraded, add packages to the Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist config stanza; see the answer to Can I configure Unattended Upgrades to not upgrade packages that require a reboot? for an example of the syntax.\nFinally, on the topic of upgrades, it's worth plugging the canonical-livepatch service which provides free, unattended, live upgrades for critical security fixes to the kernel. If you haven't checked it out, you should.\n", "Q: GRUB nomodeset and purple screen of death I'm on a Macbookpro with Ubuntu 16.04.\nI changed my GRUB settings by editing the file /etc/default/grub and adding nomodeset and acpi_backlight=vendor. \nAfter rebooting I got stuck at a purple screen where I couldn't do anything.

If you need to find out either use gparted or use output from\nsudo blkid\n\nand/or\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nAnd assume your root partition is the biggest one showing type=ext4 (we'll check this later). Your boot partition should show type=vfat or fat32 or be marked as boot partition. If you don't have a boot partition, you don't need to mount it.\nNow mount the partitions.

I'm very new to all this so this is quite bafling.\nthanks in advance\n\nA: First, reboot the system to clear out everything.\nNext, open a terminal (ctrl+alt+f1) and run these commands:\nairmon-ng check kill\nifconfig wlan0 down\niwconfig wlan0 mode monitor\nifconfig wlan0 up\n\nNote that while this does not create a new interface, it still achieves the desired effect, by putting the existing wlan0 interface into monitor mode.\n", "Q: Rearrange the components of filenames for a group of files I have a group of photo files that are named: ddmmyyyyxxxx.jpg (xxxx is just a sequence number) that I am trying to search but sadly no results, is to rename the filename to yyyy-mm-dd-xxxx.jpg.\nAll that I can find on the net is either replacing certain character or changing the letters case.\n\nA: You should be able to do that using capture groups with the perl-based rename command e.g. at its simplest\nrename -vn -- 's/^(\\d{2})(\\d{2})(\\d{4})/$3-$2-$1/' *.jpg\n\n(Note: the -n is a dry-run flag: it won't actually change anything unless you remove that.)\n\nA: You could do this using the following bash script.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor file in $(ls)\ndo\n    date=${file:0:2}\n    month=${file:2:2}\n    year=${file:4:4}\n    sequence=${file:8:4}\n    extension=${file: -3}\n\n    mv $file $year\\-$month\\-$date\\-$sequence.$extension\ndone\necho all files have been renamed\n\nIn order to use this script, open a terminal and type touch script followed by chmod +x script to make it executable. Then run nano script and copy paste the code above into the terminal. save the file by pressing CTRL+X, follwed by Y and then enter. Then move the script to the directory containing these images and execute the script by running ./script.\nThis will rename all the files in the in the directory of the script to the pattern you requested. However it will also rename the script itself so if you want to run the script again, just note it will have a different name( it will end up being pt-ri-sc-.ipt I would recommend you run mv pt-ri-sc-.ipt script before using the script again. Other wise you could replace ls with ls $1 and store the script somewhere else to avoid renaming it by accident.\nAlso this script will only run properly for files that have names in the sequence given in the question(ddmmyyyyxxxx.jpg). For any other files the file will end up with some weird name.\n\nA: For this kind of procedure I use Krename, it has a GUI and is slightly intuitive… Under ubuntu you find it in the Software Center.\n", "Q: does umake update its applications automatically? Will the applications I install through ubuntu-make update themselves automatically? Like when I install something with apt-get or like when I add a repository.\n\nA: No.\nAutomatic update is not supported by umake. You need to reinstall software when a new version becomes available (unless the software package itself has built in update functionality).\nUmake simply downloads the latest version available from the official websites and doesn't give you much option in terms of versioning (besides sometimes having a stable and a beta version).\n", "Q: Can't boot from disk I've just bought a stick to download the latest version of Ubuntu Desktop.

I open the file folder and all files are listed include \"Install\" I click on that file and a mt86plus comes up....\nI am then asked how do you want to open this file, I tried opening it with 7-Zip and nothing...\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: You will need to create a bootable usb media according to these instructions.\n\nA: So i had problem booting ubuntu from USB Stick(Flash Drive) too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Be sure your flash drive is bootable, you can see how to make a\nbootable flash drive here.\n\n*If you still can't boot from flash drive you must do a bootalbe DVD.\nYou can see here\nhow to do.\n", "Q: GRUB - automatically boot Ubuntu, or boot Windows when shift is held (WITHOUT showing the menu)? Before someone marks it as such, this question is not a duplicate: I'm not only asking how to automatically boot Ubuntu and show GRUB's menu when I hold shift during boot. I want to set up GRUB so that, when I hold shift, it boots Windows without displaying the menu.\nI know it can be done: I've seen it on the PC of a friend of mine (albeit the other way around: his PC would automatically boot Windows, or boot Ubuntu if he held shift during boot), unfortunately that person is pretty tech illiterate and I don't want to chase down the person that set up his PC.\n\nA: Workaround i found for Asus laptops:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Edit GRUB's menu with GRUB2 Editor, GRUB Customizer, or even BURG so that Windows option no longer to appear in the list. This will make PC boots directly into Ubuntu.  \n\n*When starting laptop, press Esc key immediately until the UEFI menu comes up and select your desired OS from there. Both Windows and Ubuntu should be available. UEFI menu doesn't splash up automatically on screen at boot time, so the Windows option will remain out of sight and no one will be the wiser.  \nI know it's not exactly automatic, but it's the closest thing to it that i know. My guess is the shift option you described was achieved by means of a grub editor.\n", "Q: How to rename photo filename to include the date? I have a group of photo files that are named with only a sequence number like: Imagexxxx.jpg (xxxx is just a sequence number) what I am trying to search but sadly no results, is to add the date of the file to the filename as the following yyyy-mm-dd-Imagexxxx.jpg.\nAll what I can find on the net is either replacing certain character or changing the letters case.\n\nA: Krename is one possible tool for what you are trying to accomplish.\nInstall with:\nsudo apt-get install krename\n\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the files you want to rename\n\n*Choose rename input files in the destination path\n\n*Enter [creationdate;yyyy-MM-dd]$ in the advanced Filename template.\n\n\nIf creation date (of the file) is not what you want, krename can also use exif data.\n\nA: I use 'pyRenamer' to rename my photo files.  A very friendly GUI software that can abstract EXIF meta-data from image file.\n\nA: A slight modification of this question's answer will do it.\nRun this in a terminal in the directory your photos are in, changing [date] as appropriate (no brackets are needed):\nfor file in *; do mv \"$file\" \"[date]$file\"; done\n\nNote that this will prepend whatever you choose for [date] to all files in that directory.\n", "Q: MongoDB - Unit mongod.service can't found - Ubuntu 16.04 When I try to start MongoDB, I get this error:\n# mongo  \nMongoDB shell version: 3.2.6\nconnecting to: test\n2016-05-21T16:14:31.183+0300 W NETWORK  [thread1] Failed to connect to      127.0.0.1:27017, reason: errno:111 Connection refused\n2016-05-21T16:14:31.183+0300 E QUERY    [thread1] Error: couldn't connect $ to server 127.0.0.1:27017, connection attempt failed :\nconnect@src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:229:14\n@(connect):1:6\n\nexception: connect failed\n\nAfter that I do some research and learned that I firstly need to start MongoDB server with mongod command.

You should run chkdsk.\n\n\nA: \nDisclaimer: I provided an answer to similar questions here and here. This is a summary of those two answers. Moreover, I am the developer of RecuperaBit.\n\nYour NTFS partition is broken. In order to restore the data, you need to make a copy of it (ideally) and then use a NTFS reconstruction software to restore its contents.\nClone the drive\nYou really should clone the drive in a file on an external disk, unless it is so big you can't find another drive than can contain it.\nIf you are really sure the NTFS partition coincides with /dev/sdb2, then use ddrescue to copy only that one:\nsudo ddrescue /dev/sdb2 /media/user/External/copy.img /media/user/External/status.log\n\nIf you are not sure, it is much better to clone the entire /dev/sdb drive. This will take more space, of course:\nsudo ddrescue /dev/sdb /media/user/External/copy.img /media/user/External/status.log\n\nThe status.log file is not mandatory, but it is needed if you want to pause the process and resume later on.\nAnalyze and reconstruct the file system\nIf the file system is only slightly broken, you may have luck with testdisk:\ntestdisk /media/External/copy.img\n\nFollow the step-by-step procedure in the CLI and you will be able to list the contents of the partition with the P key, assuming it is almost intact.\nIf the damage is more serious, you need something else. You can recover (possibly severely) damaged NTFS partitions using RecuperaBit. RecuperaBit attempts to reconstruct file system structures and recover\nfiles. RecuperaBit attempts reconstruction of the directory structure regardless of:\n\n\n*\n\n*missing partition table\n\n*unknown partition boundaries\n\n*partially-overwritten metadata\n\n*quick format\n\n\nCurrently, it does not require installation, you need to download the archive from GitHub and extract it in a directory of your choice.\nAfter that, create a directory for the output and start the program with:\nmkdir /media/user/External/recovered_files\ncd [full path of recuperabit]\npypy main.py /media/user/External/copy.img -o /media/user/External/recovered_files -s /media/user/External/savefile.save\n\nYou might also use python, however pypy is faster. The scanning process will take quite some time. When it's done, type recoverable and find the id of your partition. If it is e.g. 2, type:\nrestore 2 5\nrestore 2 -1\n\n5 means the Root directory and -1 means the Lost Files directory.\nFor additional details, explanations and caveats, see the two links at the top of this post.\n", "Q: I can't figureout how to download youtube videos with the help of uget and flashgot addon I am on ubuntu 14.04 and have installed uget from the official ppa and also installed flashgot addon for firefox.

I upgraded from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 and all of a sudden performance of wifi was horrible. I would try to download a 60MB file and it would stall out after 10-20MB and then the download would fail, it seemed like the connection would just pause for a minute while doing anything. After searching for over a week and finding others having similar issues with little resolutions, I decided to reload drivers and even tried upgrading to Ubuntu 16.10. After still having issues after that I noticed that there was a new listing under \"Software & Updates\" in the \"Additional Drivers\" tab for an Unknown device: \"Using Processor microcode firmware for Intel CPUs from intel-microcode (proprietary)\". I enabled that and rebooted and then everything started working like new again. Not sure if you are still having problems, or maybe others are still coming across this issue and can give that a try.\n\nA: I have the same problem and wrote to Intel, the answer below:\nThank you for contacting Intel Customer Support.

This should be configured in your settings. \nYou can read more about the Operating System compatibility, and the\n  limited support for Linux via this link on the Product Brief:\n  http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/wireless-products/dual-band-wireless-ac-7265-brief.html\nPlease be aware that our products are found in a third party device,\n  therefore they will provide the correct drivers for other components\n  built into there system. Intel only has the generic drivers.   As I\n  cannot provide anymore assistance, I am going to close this case,\n  however should you have any further queries you can reply to this\n  email and the ticket will re-open automatically.\n\nThat means, we should solve the problem as Linux community, they only produce the hardware.\nBest regards,\n", "Q: How can I dual boot Chromium OS alongside Ubuntu?

I noticed sometimes, like with programs such as Google Chrome and Teamviewer, they automatically installed themselves in my /computer/opt directory. However, for programs such as VSCode, I had to manually move the tar.gz file into my /opt directory, and then extract there. Why do some programs do this automatically, while others have to be done manually?\nAlso, when installing programs, what is the best directory to install them in? (i.e. what is the Linux equivalent to Program Files (x86) for Windows?)\nThank you.\n\nA: There is no C:\\Program Files\\ in linux \"per se\". Therefore it doesn't exist one single (default) place where programs where to install. Actually many linux programs installs all over the place, parts of them installs in different folders. That's happening for performance optimization - one of many reasons why linux runs faster than Windows.  \nBest practice is to allow the program to install wherever it wants. Don't worry about volume fragmentation. That's virtually non-existent in linux.  \nThe same thing happens in Windows too, when some big programs are installing files in ProgramData or CommonFiles folders. I've seen programs installing in Program Files (x64) and their respective Licence Key Server installing in Program Files (x86). Many specific user data may install in C:\\Users\\Documents\\.  \nWhen a program uses many per-user options and files, it ussually installs to /usr/share. When it does not, it ussually installs to /opt. You could say that /usr is the equivalent of Users folder from Windows. /opt stands for optional software (that doesn't come bundled with the Ubuntu original disk).  \nFor in-depth details of where and how linux programs are installed, please see this topic: Where are my installed applications\nThere is no single Program Files because of security reasons. Trusted applications (verified by the Software Center) may install in more sensitive places like /bin (=binaries) or even /sbin (=superbinaries), while untrusted (unverified) apps are installed in secure and secluded locations like /opt.\n", "Q: How to compile Ubuntu 16.04 kernel with zfs module I build custom Ubuntu kernel with make localmodconfig at the Ubuntu 16.04 lts server with installing zfs and mounted zfs pool.\nmake localmodconfig\nusing config: '.config'\nzfs config not found!!\nrdma_cm config not found!!\nznvpair config not found!!\nzavl config not found!!\nspl config not found!!\nzunicode config not found!!\nzcommon config not found!!\n\nSo it is not surprise for me to get after reboot with builded kernel system report that zfs mount failed. \nmodprobe: FATAL: Module zfs not found in directory /lib/modules/4.4.8-passthrough\n\nThere is no options related to ZFS in .config file and make menuconfig.\nWhere can I get missed configs for zfs, rdma_cm, znvpair, zavl, spl, zunicode, zcommon or what trick should I do for bulding kernel with ZFS?\nThanks in advanced.\nIgor.\n\nA: I would recommend the following:\nInstall the necessary tools and dependencies:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential git\nsudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\nclone the Xenial Ubuntu linux 4.4 kernel:\ngit clone https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/xenial\n\nand build the kernel:\ncd xenial\nsudo apt-get install kernel-wedge\nfakeroot debian/rules clean\nsudo apt-get install libssl-dev ncurses-dev xz-utils kernel-package\ndebian/rules build\nfaketroot debian/rules binary-headers binary-generic\n\nand you should end up with the necessary linux image and headers\n", "Q: Nvidia GEForce GT 610 installed via additional drivers changed the default color to blue I did a fresh install of Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS - 64 bit along side Windows 10.

As per official website Ubuntu 16.04 system requirements are as below,\n2 GHz dual core processor or better,\n2 GB system memory,\n25 GB of free hard drive space,\nBut my system info is as below,\nProcessor:- Intel(R) Celeron (R) CPUB815@1.60 GHz,\nRAM:- 2GB,\nSystem type:- 32 bit,\nPlease help to check whether my system fulfills all requirement?\n\nA: Those are the recommended system requirements for the system to run at its best.  Recommended requirements vs. minimum requirements are two different things.  \nYour processor is actually a 64bit and capable of running the amd64 release.  That designation amd64 only means that it is for 64bit systems.\nUbuntu actually comes in many different flavors that allow for different types of system configurations.  Ubuntu GNOME is one of the heaviest desktops requiring much more RAM, Video Memory, CPU.  Where Xubuntu and Lubuntu are much more lightweight and require less CPU, RAM, and Video.  I prefer Xubuntu as it is configurable, lightweight and looks good.\nThis answer here might help in deciding which version of Ubuntu Desktop you want to install.\nSo, you should be able to install and run Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: Your RAM and drive space seems a bit low for a default ubuntu install running unity. Sure, you can easily install it with those specs, but actually using on a day-to-day basis might be a problem.\nRAM\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have a dedicated graphics card, the integrated graphics will take up 300-400 MB of your memory. That leaves you with 1.6 GB.\n\n*Upon boot, with no other processes running, a typical ubuntu unity install will use about 600 MB. You will be left with 1.0 - 1.1 GB.\n\n*Using firefox (the default browser) will increase your RAM usage to more than 1 GB, depending on the add-ons installed and tabs opened. Your free RAM will be about 400-500 MB (perhaps even less, if you like to visit sites that requires flash or java).\n\n*With that much free memory left, you can't run another memory intensive application without the system resorting to swapping. Once the system starts swapping, it will be very unresponsive, practically rendering it unusable.\n\n\nDRIVE SPACE\nA default install will take about 4-5 GB of drive space. After installing apps, you will probably end up using 8-12 GB. You will be left with about 13 GB for data. This is not a lot of space considering this is inclusive of cached files (e.g. files stored by apps locally to make them run faster). If you plan to just store simple files (e.g. text files) then no problem. Once you start storing multimedia files...\nYou also need to allocate 1-2 GB for swap space. More if you believe in the rule-of-thumb: swap = RAM * 2. (I don't believe in it).\nSUGGESTION\nIf your intent is to just try out ubuntu, your system specs should be just fine. However, if this is going to be your main OS, I would recommend looking at more lightweight flavors of ubuntu (xubuntu, lubuntu, etc.).\nIf it is feasible to boost your RAM to at least 4GB, then you will be OK with a default ubuntu unity installation. Of course, even with 4GB, you can still use more lightweight flavors if you want. :)\n", "Q: wireshark installing ubuntu14.0.4 error I am trying to install by:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:n-muench/programs-ppa\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install wireshark\n$ sudo apt-get remove wireshark\n\nHowever, I got the below problem when running wireshark:\nwireshark: symbol lookup error: wireshark: undefined symbol: wslua_reload_plugins\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: I had similar problem, the following solution worked for me - delete the following files. \n/usr/local/lib/libwsutil.so.*\n\n/usr/local/lib/libwireshark.so.*\n\n/usr/local/lib/libwiretap.so.*\n\nHope it helps you\n", "Q: Random Mouse Movements Using Ubuntu 15.10 Recently, my mouse cursor has been randomly moving slightly left and right.

I generally have some distrust of the idea of downloading a bunch of scripts to install software on my machine, but I have no idea if that is founded or not.\n\n\nHow much trust should I place in opening the terminal and running sudo apt-get install xyzsoftwarepackage? If I allow the universe and multiverse repositories do I need to be really quite sure of exactly what I am installing? If I only allow the main repository should I generally be able to feel more trustworthy?\n\nA: Using the official repos is making sure that the software you're installing is both tested and configured as it should be, in order to function as it should.  This does not mean that you cannot or shouldn't use several TESTED ppa's.  Most of them are quite ok to use and they are very safe.\napt-get installs software using the repos or ppa's as sources.  This also ensures that whenever new releases appear in those sources, your copy will also be updated during the update process.\nCompiling from source should be your choice only in cases when the software you need does not exist as a precompiled package in the sources mentioned above or the precompiled versions are outdated and new ones do not exist.  Compiling from source makes you and only you responsible for that software and you should check for possible updates to that software manually.\nYou should also know that in order to be able to compile from source, many many more packages will have to be installed on your system, for the compiler to find them and create the compiled version.\n", "Q: fstab defaults not working as expected I want to mount a partition to /media/files so that every user can read, write and execute in it.

Now defaults in fstab solves the problem. \nSo, as a reminder for anybody struggeling: \nchmod a+rwx /media/files\n\nwill do the trick!\nIf anybody as something to add about the rigorous permissions, I am happy to hear.\n\nA: The mount option user resets some other options. From man 8 mount:\nuser   Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem.  The name of the\n       mounting  user  is  written  to  mtab so that he can unmount the\n       filesystem again.

Please suggest some solutions.\n\nA: You can try using watch. watch -10 <YOUR COMMAND>\nThis will try executing your command every 10 second in terminal.\n\nA: Create a script (and chmod +x it):\n#!/bin/bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nfirefox\n\nRun crontab -e and add at the bottom:\n* * * * * /path/to/my/script\n\n..and it'll open Firefox every minute on your user's desktop.\n\nFigured you might also want a feature to automatically close it after some time, instead of incrementing opened windows or tabs. I would suggest creating separate FF profile just for cron. Run firefox -P and create a new profile there. Name it... let's say \"cron\". Then use this script:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nfirefox -P cron &\nsleep 30 # set here any amount of seconds you need\npkill -f \"/usr/lib/firefox/firefox -P cron\"\n\nWorks like charm in my environment.\nOh, you will have to update your everyday links to FF to load your normal profile, for example like this: firefox -P default.\n", "Q: Run computer as root without terminal I have a lamp project and I can't move my project in the file I'm supposed to move unless I do it from terminal as root, and then it doesn't let me open the project and change it, I have a lots of files I have to change and it's very time consuming to open them all from terminal each time I want to change them. How can I run my computer as root without the terminal?( I am new to ubuntu )\n\nA: Do not run as root\nWhile you could simply activate the password for the root user (with passwd), do not do that. It's a very bad practice from a security point of view. Instead, you should handle permissions properly.\nRun a file manager as root\nYou can start Nautilus with sudo privileges in the usual way:\nsudo nautilus\n\nThen you can copy the files that you need to move (I assume under /var/www). You can also open a file in a text editor, but keep in mind that the editor is going to run with elevated privileges as well. Do not run untrusted programs in this setting.\nWhen you are done moving the files, you'll probably want to recursively fix the owner to www-data and its group:\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/*\n\n", "Q: How can I remove Tilda?

The command ip -6 show addr will show any configured IPv6 addreses.  Addresses starting with fe80:: are link local addresses and won't be routed to the internet.  The address(es) you are interested in will end with /128.  The addresses ending /64 are networks you are connected to.\nTo test connectivity try a command like ping6 google.com.  Browsing to http://test-ipv6.com/ will provide addition information on your connectivity.  \nYou may want to read the Linux IPv6 HowTo.  I started with 6to4 tunneling and progressed to 6in4 tunneling documenting some of the changes I did.\nYou will want to firewall some but not all ICMPv6 types, as well as enabling DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, and other services.  It is difficult to hand wire the IPTables rules so I use Shorewall6 to build my rules.  It is available as an Ubuntu package.  It takes a small amount of effort to do the initial setup, but the documentation is good. \nFrom your listing, it does not appear you need to update /etc/network/interfaces.  If you have/want a static IPv6 addres, then add a stanza like the following:\niface enp0s7 inet6 static\n    address xxxx::...\n    gateway xxxx::...\n\nIf Comcast are routing the whole /64 your way, you can pick any static IP you want.  You could also announce that /64 to your LAN if your have one.  However, you should have been given a separate /64, /56, or /48 for that purpose.  A RADV daemon is usually used to do the announcement, and it can be configured for dynamically allocated IPv6 addresses.   \n", "Q: Install ubuntu on meizu Pro5 - ubuntu doesnt boot I've followed the guide from How to install Ubuntu on Meizu Pro 5 that was originally with Android?\nAll worked fine, but at the end the phone stuck at boot logo \"meizu powered by ubuntu\".\nWas also unsure about the comment \"do not flash bootloader and recovery\", does it mean i have to remove them from the archive?

I know that the Flyme recovery mode doesn't really work for some reason. At least it didn't for me.

Alternatively, you could use EasyUEFI in Windows to move the ubuntu entry to the top of the boot order list.\n\nEDIT:\nIf it's resetting to boot straight to Windows when you reboot the computer without booting into Windows, then your EFI is badly broken. Check the manufacturer's site for an update (probably called a \"BIOS upgrade\" or something similar). If that doesn't help, then the best course of action is to return the computer for a refund, assuming you're within the return period. If not, you'll need to employ an ugly hack involving renaming boot loader files. Boot Repair can do this semi-automatically with an option on its Advanced menu, or you can do it manually, as noted here. Either way, if it's a bad EFI, write to the manufacturer to complain! Too many have been delivering junk EFIs for too long!\nIf this happens only after booting to Windows, then chances are Windows is the culprit.

I would like to install the i3 Window Manager and when I tried it with the Unity version, some styles carried over to i3, which didn't look good.

I did a fresh install on the mSATA (sdb) including GRUB. All is fine. But when I remove the SATA the mSATA becomes sda and Ubuntu boots but only only in some maintenance command lines. I tried it the other way around: Installed Ubuntu on mSATA as sda (no SATA connected), all is fine but when I add the SATA this gets the name sda and my mSATA is sdb now and I have the same trouble.

At the same time as this happens, the speed of the connection drops to near zero (it's still connected, but it's slower than dial-up and most requests time out). It remains in this state until I click the network name in the menu to reset the connection, at which point the apparent signal strength drops back down and the speed back up to normal.\nThis happens frequently enough while using the computer that it makes it impractical to use.

Is there a way to open a kdb file on ubuntu 16.04 without having to convert it to kdbx? I want to keep using kdb because that is the only format i can open on a windows computer that i have no admin access to install something else compatible with kdbx\n\nA: For those of you who prefer to compile old or missing packages or who want to have both KeepassX version 2 and 0.4, you may follow this instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the build dependencies (sudo apt-get install build-essential libqt4-dev libxtst-dev qt4-make).\n\n*Download the source code of the last 0.4 version (0.4.4) keepassx-0.4.4.tar.gz\n\n*Decompress it (tar xvf keepassx-0.4.4.tar.gz).\n\n*Get into the directory (cd keepassx-0.4.4/).\n\n*Edit the file src/lib/random.cpp to add the line #include <unistd.h> around line 22 (this is a requiremente to compile with the version of GCC in latest Ubuntu versions).\n\n*Run qmake to create the Makefile (qmake PREFIX=/usr/local).\n\n*Run make to build the executable (make).\n\n*Install the executable (sudo make install). This will put the binary executable in /usr/local/bin/keepassx.\n\n\nNow, you can create a new launcher icon to /usr/local/bin/keepassx to run the 0.4 version. (You may need to edit the old keepassx launcher to point to /usr/bin/keepassx to run version 2).\nThis should work at least for Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) to 17.10 (Artful).\nThis is a screenshot of both versions running side by side in Ubuntu Mate 16.04: \n\nA: I ended up installing an older version of KeePassX from this URL:\nPackage Page: http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/amd64/keepassx/download\nDirect Download Link: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/k/keepassx/keepassx_0.4.3+dfsg-0.1ubuntu1.14.04.1_amd64.deb (it is for Trusty, but works well in Xenial)\nThe newer version (2.X) dropped support for kdb files.\nThe following command will pin the package to the older version so that it doesn't get updated when you do apt-get upgrade:\n# hold package, so that it doesn't get upgraded\necho \"keepassx hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\n# for posterity, same as above\napt-mark hold keepassx\n\n# since aptitude doesn't respect the above\naptitude hold keepassx\n\n", "Q: Fldigi usb to db9 Ubuntu 14.4.4.

I have also turned on bi-directional support.\nNow of the above work, so I'm really stuck and need to copy/paste code from the GitLab page to install it.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Since you as well asked how to do it the cool way (ssh) I'll cover that, only thing for you to find out is how to get ssh on your MAC since I have never touched and never will touch one.\n1. Preparation:\nOpen virtualbox and go into the preferences via menu, go to the network tab and click on the little plus icon under host only networks, this will add an adapter called vboxnet0.\n\n\nAfter you have done that enter the preferences of the VM itself and switch there to the network tab and click on port forwarding on Adapter 1 and enter after a click on the plus sign your credentials like shown in the pictures below.\nNOTE: You can SSH directly from your Mac OS X system to your VM system if it's NAT'd and on the same system; You don't need to configure Port Forwarding unless you want systems outside of the system running VM to reach the system. (included from comment as I never had or will never own a MAC i cant check on that, for an Ubuntu host it is definitively needed).\n\n\n\nAfter that you go to the Adapter 2tab and enable this adapter and set it to be attached to the host only adapter named vboxnet0.\n\n2. Logging in:\nAs i already said I have never touched a max but i assume the commands should be the same or near same so I will put here the commands used on an Ubuntu host to give you a lead on. To log in to your VM you start it in --headless mode in terminal (I leave the Kali-Linux in but you should replace that with your VM's name):\nvboxmanage startvm \"Kali-Linux\" --type headless\n\nNow wait a moment your VM still need to boot up even if it shows no window then log into it with:\nssh -l <user-name> localhost -p 2222\n\nYou will then be prompted for the user password on your VM and after that logged in, now the lines you see in your terminal are lines you see and type in your VM.\nTo shutdown you have two options I prefer mostly the first.\n\n\n*\n\n*shutdown from within the VM\nshutdown -h 1\nlogout\n\n\n*shutdown from terminal\nlogout\nvboxmanage controlvm \"Kali-Linux\" poweroff\n\n\nA: There is no way to use Shared Clipboard functionality as you think between the Mac and the VirtualBox VM directly.\nUbuntu Server does not implement a clipboard function on a default (and I don't know if you even can).  This prohibits your use of the clipboard in the manner you're trying to achieve.\n\nThe only way to achieve this would be to SSH from your Mac OS X to the Ubuntu Server guest OS, using the IP assigned to the virtual guest:\nssh user@x.x.x.x\n\n(where x.x.x.x is the IP assigned to the guest VM, and this whole command is run from Mac OS X's terminal).\n(You could also use PuTTY or a similar SSH client to SSH to the Guest VM.)\nYou can then copy/paste from Mac OS X into the Mac OS X terminal window text.  You can not use this for file transfer, but you will be able to copy/paste commands to run, etc. and execute them that way.\nNote that if you are trying to get a system OTHER than the system running VBox to reach the system, you have to set up port forwarding as detailed in other answers here.  If Mac OS X is running VirtualBox and the VM, then you don't need to do the NAT port forwarding steps.\n", "Q: How to install the richdocuments plugin on Owncloud?

I suspect the issue lies with my Ubuntu server that is running OpenVPN. I suspect the issue is that while the article above gave a step to setup routing from 10.8.0.0 to the internal network, it didn't include a step from the internal network to 10.8.0.0.
