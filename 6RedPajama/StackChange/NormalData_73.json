["Q: MacBook Air Running super slow after Catalina update My MacBook Air(13-inch, Early 2015) 8GB RAM is running macOS Catalina 10.15.2.\nNow the mac is Super Slow and booting time is consistently 90 seconds +.\nEvery app that I open the rainbow cursor comes up. \nI cannot multi-task, open multiple tabs on chrome else it hangs and slows down. The Netflix, YouTube and any video I am playing is running with a slight lag and it is not smooth as it was previously. \nI have done resetting the SMC and PRAM reset and still no improvement.\nHow can I improve the performance? \n\nA: Step one is to open Activity Monitor and check if your drive is IO bound.\n\nNext, once you're sure you're not waiting for storage to do work (by letting Spotlight and iCloud and all the expected programs to finish their work), then look at which programs are taking energy and finally look at the CPU to see what processes are busy.\nAfter a day or two post install and letting the system clean up, it should be substantially faster or you should be able to razor focus on specific apps that are tripping up your Mac. We're seeing excellent performance after upgrading to Mojave and now Catalina across the board on our fleet of Macs. Comment or ask a follow on question if you need more help with pinpointing your blocking process or app.\n\nA: Follow the guidance on this Apple page and start your computer in Safe Mode. Doing so does some behind-the-scene repairs, detailed in the Apple page above. After the computer has started in Safe Mode, and you have logged in to your user account, then restart the computer.\n", "Q: Can I use different Apple ID for Music on Catalina? I just got a new 16\" MBP at work. It runs Catalina of course.\nI use a work based Apple ID for this machine. I have a personal Apple ID that I use on my iPhone which recently just got an Apple Music subscription. Is there a way to have the Catalina music app use a different Apple ID than the (work based) one that the rest of macOS knows about? \n\nA: Yes - you can sign in using different Apple ID for the music app and not share the same AppleID as you do with other items like the App Store, iCloud preferences, FaceTime and Messages. In fact, you could choose a different account for each one of the above if you wanted to be creative or difficult or just had specific needs.\n\n\n*\n\n*I use my work AppleID for Messages and FaceTime and iCloud.\n\n*I use my personal AppleID for the App Store and Music.

I bought an old iPad 4 mini which was somewhere in desk with empty battery for last who-know-how-many years. The result is battery in a bad shape obviously, iPad works great but shuts down when battery shows about 45% left. No big deal, I can live with that, considering how difficult it is to replace. But, I'd expect it to recalibrate after some time, that iPadOS will notice and change its 0%-100% range to match lower capacity of the old battery but that didn't happen. After months of usage, it still behaves the same way. Is there any way how to force the recalibration?\n\nA: As resolved in comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try calibrating the battery by fully charging to 100%, and then draining it to when it crashes. From personal experience, letting it die out slowly overnight is better than sudden crashes due to increased demand while using.  Some users report doing the charge-discharge cycle twice. https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/15568/313842\n\n*If battery is still out of order, do a hard reset.

So, in turn, I can't use 'find my iPhone' or call the iPhone, because I haven't yet assigned a phone number to it. I did sign into the phone, though. Just not iCloud. Is there any way to find my 6s?\n\nA: The only way would be the old-fashioned - go look for it, ask others if they've seen it, etc.\nYou don't specify what you mean by \"signing into the phone\" except that it is not iCloud, you've signed into. If the service you did sign into (for example Facebook Messenger?) does have some kind of location tracking, it might give you a last known position.\nIf you have just misplaced the phone, you can't really report it as stolen with Apple to get it blocked on cell networks.\n", "Q: Why emacs commands work everywhere on macOS? I can use emacs commands everywhere on macOS, which is good.\nBut why?\nFor example, in forms in Safari, I can use ctl-a, ctl-k, etc...\nI can use them in Note.app, too.\nMy guess is they are actually Unix commands and emacs borrowed them?\n\nA: \nI can use emacs commands everywhere on macOS, which is good. But why?\n\nNormally, asking “Why Apple does this, that, or the other thing” would be considered off topic, however, this one actually has an answer based in history.\nThe short answer to this is because the Emacs keybindings support is implemented in the Cocoa Text System.  \n\nMy guess is they are actually Unix commands and emacs borrowed them?\n\nThey are not, however, Unix commands, because already pointed out in another answer, they are not found in the Unix specification. Also, they are not “universal” and cannot be used everywhere.  They can only be used where the application(s) make use of the Cocoa Text System.  For example, they cannot be used in Microsoft Word. \nSo, what does Cocoa have to do with anything?  Well, Cocoa is derived from OpenStep which was a project developed by NeXT and Sun Microsystems to provide a NeXTSTEP like environment to non-NeXTSTEP operating systems.  NeXT produced an OpenStep variation for its own Mach-based Unix.\nNow remember, the macOS Unix kernel is Mach-based.  \nSo, how did Apple get its hands on Mach and OpenStep?  Well, on February 7, 1997 Apple acquired NeXT (along with Steve Jobs).  The derivative products from that purchase was, you guessed it, macOS based on the Mach kernel, OpenStep, and all the other goodies NeXT had in their portfolio.\nSo, why did Apple bring over all those keybindings as they developed Cocoa?  It only made sense for Apple bring over an environment developers (lots and lots of them from the Unix-verse) were already familiar with.  Cocoa, derived from OpenStep, implemented the Emacs functionality already built into OpenStep.\n\nA: Your guess is not really correct, no. These \"commands\" (or keyboard shortcuts) are not Unix-commands. The Unix specification does not say anything about system wide text editing short cuts or similar, so you cannot really say that it is borrowed from there.\nI doubt that the answer from @ankii is correct either. It doesn't make sense that \"for consistent design\" you would have two different short cuts for each of many operations (such as for example Ctrl-A you mentioned having the probably more Mac-ish shortcut Cmd-LeftArrow).\nAnother thought could be that emacs actually borrowed these short cuts from macOS. This is not the case either. Emacs originated in 1976, while the first Macintosh System Software release is from 1984.\nThe most logical explanation would be that some or many macOS system programmers from an early time were users of editors with command short cuts similar to emacs (which would include emacs itself), or that a large enough subset of initial customers were such users - so they added on these extra short cuts for everyone to feel at home.\nIn fact some of these short cuts date back quite a lot. As far as I know, they originate with the \"computer terminals\" that were the way many large computer systems were accessed in the 1970s. In rough terms, terminals are the evolutionary step after \"line printers\" as the main interface, and before \"bitmap displays\" (computer monitors). \nFor example the popular VT100 series of virtual terminals (circa 1978) came with similar short cuts. For example similar to Control-K in macOS, Escape-K deleted to the end of line. Note that in those days, the ESC-key was not located on the keyboard where it is today.\n\nA: One can see most of the shortcuts on macOS at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_keyboard_shortcuts \nAs for why you can use them in emacs, it could be for consistent design, like the four or five tabs in so many iOS apps.\n", "Q: How to remove time from the watch face? I have zero interest in knowing what time it is.\nHow can I remove the current time from the main screen on my Apple Watch?\n\nA: You can’t easily get rid of the clock display unless you enable Voiceover in accessibility settings and also turn on Screen Curtain. \nIf there is anything displayed,  Apple provides no face that hides or eliminates time. If you want to minimize the pixels devoted to the time display - choose Modular faces. \nThe most pixels you can devote to things other than time is the Infograph face, but it has large analog hands displayed, probably not what you want.\nA jailbreak would be needed to make your own face or subtract / color the time to be the same color as the background and basically erase it visually.\n", "Q: Are 82°C to 98°C Temperatures extreme for a MacBook Pro? I've noticed that my 2018 MacBook Pro 15\" with an i7 frequently hits 82°C while using Google Chrome and 98°C while playing video games. As an example, while running Minecraft with maybe 12 mods, Activity Monitor shows it using ~99% CPU with an energy impact of ~1000.\nI got this MacBook in July and the issue started immediately. I contacted Apple Support who was quite unhelpful, telling me to reboot my computer and that they were \"unable to find the safe temperatures\" for my MacBook.\nI haven't run into the MacBook throttling at all or shutting itself down, which leads me to believe something might be wrong with the firmware, or maybe the SMC. I haven't tried resetting the SMC yet, mostly due to concern over what specifically it will reset.\nSince I'm not sure if these are extreme, should I be concerned for my MacBook Pro?\n\nA: I'm assuming you have the Mid 2018 15\" MacBook Pro with the Intel i7-8850H CPU. This CPU has a maximum junction temperature of 100°C.\nThat means that hitting 82°C while browsing or 98°C while gaming isn't a problem in itself. You're within the limits in the specification.\nSo unless you're actually experiencing some other kind of related problem besides that you think it is a high number, then there's really no issue at all - nothing to be worried about.\n", "Q: Logging into apps using Facebook credentials always uses a browser - Is this avoidable? For instance, when trying to login to the Wish app on my Iphone 8, it always opens the Facebook login page on Safari--even though I have the FB app open and logged in. This seems like a waste of time. Is this by design? I would think it would be much more efficient if it would recognize the fact that I'm already authenticated as evidenced by the FB app being on & in.\n\nA: This is by design. Separation of applications and processes on iOS is deliberate.\nInterprocess Communication (IPC) on iOS\nInterprocess-communication between iOS apps is particularly limited. Apple would argue this is a net benefit, as their customers are better protected from malicious behaviours that are difficult to detect during the review process.\nShared Credentials Between Apps\nApps created by the same developer, digitally signed by the same organisation, can share credentials on iOS. This is how the Facebook and Messenger apps can both know you are logged into the Facebook service. But other Facebook connected apps, created by different developers, can not.\n", "Q: Is macOS Mojave (and up?) doing extra network blocking compared to macOS High Sierra? I have two computers on the same LAN:\n\n\n*\n\n*old: macOS High Sierra + Server.app\n\n*new: macOS Mojave + Server.app\nBoth have the Application Firewall turned off\nWhen I run nc -l 8082 on one I can connect to it from the other using a telnet client, both ways. I can also connect from other Macs on the local network.\nBut when connected to from the outside, the High Sierra computer accepts network connections, while the Mojave computer doesn't.\nIn other words, I set router NAT and router firewall to accept port 8082 and route it to old, the old computer is available for connections. I see the traffic (NAT and fw) in the logging on the (Ubiquiti) router (I've set logging active on the NAT rule and the allow firewall rule): \nDec 28 03:48:21 ubntrouter kernel: [WAN_IN-40-A]IN=eth1 OUT=switch0 MAC=24:a4:3c:b3:ae:0a:02:1d:b5:ca:a9:4b:08:00 SRC=[outsideclient] DST=[old:privateip] LEN=60 TOS=0x10 PREC=0x00 TTL=55 ID=18302 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=35900 DPT=8082 WINDOW=29200 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0\nDec 28 03:48:21 ubntrouter kernel: [NAT-2-DNAT] IN=eth1 OUT= MAC=24:a4:3c:b3:ae:0a:02:1d:b5:ca:a9:4b:08:00 SRC=[outsideclient] DST=[publicip] LEN=60 TOS=0x10 PREC=0x00 TTL=56 ID=18302 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=35900 DPT=8082 WINDOW=29200 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0\n\nBut when I do exactly the same with the new computer, I get 'Connection refused'.

Somehow, HighSierra accepts the network traffic, while Mojave blocks it. I suspect Apple security measures, accepting traffic from the local IP range but not when originating from outside that IP range.\nAssuming that is the case. What could be causing this (application firewall is off) and how can I fix it so I can actually provide a service from my Mac to the outside world?\n\nA: A macOS server system provides two and half firewalls:\n\n\n*\n\n*Application Firewall (with a GUI > System Preferences > Security & Privacy)\n\n*pf (only 3rd-party GUIs)\n\n*Adaptive Firewall which is (or at least was) based on ipfw and pf (and thus in parts flawed because Apple botched it by removing ipfw). Partly fixed here: How to setup the adaptive firewall.\n\n\nOnly the last one is exclusive to systems with Server.app installed and configured.\n\nLaunching Server.app for the first time will modify /etc/pf.conf and add an additional pf anchor: /private/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple.server-firewall. This anchor loads additional anchors from /Library/Server/Firewall/Anchors/. \nBy default all firewalls are off and defunct and no substantial rules are defined.\nAs soon as you change in Server.app: Server > hostname > Access > Default Network Access the default setting all networks to something else, the linked anchors are fed with rules depending on your settings and the pf daemon is launched. Changing back to all networks will remove all rules related to default network access but the pf daemon continues to run.\n\n\n*\n\n*all networks will allow NATed traffic from the Internet directed to your server\n\n*private networks will prohibit NATed traffic from the Internet directed to your server based on the propagated rules.\n\n\n\nAFAIR there is no difference between the various Server v5 versions (at least El Capitan - Catalina) regarding the initial setting of Default Network Access which always is and was all networks.\n\nA: The answer is in the Server.app. This app may lock down network traffic in some way (how is unknown to me, I'd be interested to learn).\nThe Server.app in Mojave has the server itself as its first entry on the left, select that, then select the 'Access' tab. There, 'Default Network Access' was set to 'private networks' on Mojave and 'all networks' on High Sierra, with on High Sierra the services per-service locked down unless they had to be available from the outside.\nProbably best to use 'private networks' only and have custom entries for the ports that need to be accessible from the outside.\n", "Q: How important is it for a Mac admin account to be associated with an Apple ID My wife and I have an iMac. We each use standard user accounts associated with our respective Apple IDs. We also have an administrator account that is not associated with an Apple ID.\nWhat problems, if any, could the admin account not using an Apple ID cause? Should we add one of ours to it?\n\nA: This association is purely optional. You don't need an AppleID or an iCloud to manage your Mac and as long as you're the original purchaser and have proof of purchase, you can lock the firmware, iCloud Activation Lock and take your Mac to Apple and they will unlock it for you.\nThe only reason to put your admin account into iCloud is if you want to let that other password for iCloud / AppleID unlock the Mac, store/sync keychain items in iCloud or use other features of the AppleID.\nChoose good admin passwords on your Mac, write them down in a safe place (1Password, bank safe, place where you can get to if you forget a password) and you'll protect the admin password and your Mac.\n", "Q: Mac reboots after some minutes of inactivity I have this strange problem of my Mac rebooting. Everything was normal until I started syncing photos from iCloud (this could be coincidental, maybe not).

I want to know how does my Mac use this disks. What is the difference between this disks (0 and 1) on my Mac?

I don't mean to make it impossible, but a lot of effort might be needed to triage and fix this directly. Even with these logs, I would consider opening a case with Apple Dev or regular support as they have the engineers that designed it and the source code. We only get the log file output. \nThe good news, is anyone can call Apple Support since iCloud is supported and they will go through the usual items - sign out of iCloud (which is the opposite of the above - enabling a profile is a surgeon's scalpel - signing out is like knocking down the room) and then sign back in. Also, wiping the device and starting over - signing in to Files first might be a reasonable thing to try if you have a good backup. It will take 10 minutes to test and then worst case, you confirm it's broken and erase / restore your backup and then engage with debugging yourself or with AppleCare.\nGood luck - something is definitely messed up if this persists for days and everything else works.\n\nA: i untick the iCloud drive and then turned it on again and then Restarted the phone and it solved the issue for me\n", "Q: Process completed after opening terminal I am running a bioinformatics course that gave the following instructions to setup my  previously non-existing bash profile:\n\nYou will need a few lines in your setup files.

I recently migrated to a new Macbook. \nIf I do a $ defaults write ... in my shell, I get an error shaped like defaults[12608:79345] Could not write domain Apple Global Domain; exiting. Using sudo does work, however I have some defaults that are set in my .bashrc file -- these writes did work in my old system's .bashrc, without a sudo.\nQ1: Are defaults saved across reboots? If so, I can removed these from my (cluttered) .bashrc and get on with life.\nQ2: If defaults are not saved across reboots, what file(s) do I need to chown or chmod in order to get the defaults write to work quietly, in my .bashrc file?\nWhat I've done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Read the defaults man page -- only seems to document the API.\n\n*Skimmed around in Apple's developer docs for Preferences. Again, this seems to be higher level API documentation for application developers who are using Cocoa. \n\n\nA: The defaults command normally writes an entry into the relevant .plist file. The whole point of property list files is to retain settings between boots. You should not need to re-apply them after each boot.\nConsequently, you should not need to run the defaults command in a .bashrc file, which runs at the start of every interactive shell session.\nYou should not need sudo for defaults commands such as these:\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleShowScrollBars -string \"Always\"\ndefaults write -g AppleEnableMenuBarTransparency -bool false\ndefaults write -app Safari AutoOpenSafeDownloads -bool false\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture include-date -bool false\n\nIf you're trying to write some other type of default command to a system-level domain, then that might explain why you need sudo. Otherwise, the need for sudo is 'unexpected'. \n", "Q: Merge two APFS containers I want to know if I can merge two APFS containers.\n\nI want to merge Untitled to mac, mac-Data container. \nIf I click - button at the bottom, Untitled container is merged to Workspace. But this is not what I want to do.\nAnyone can help ?\nThis image is diskutil list result.\n\nI am using Mac Mojave now.\n\n\nA: No - there is no merging. The point of APFS is to put all your volumes in one container and not make multiple containers, but you're where you are today.\nLooking at the image you should have more than enough space to move what you can off of the middle container (into the first ideally or into the last if needed. Then you can remove the middle empty container, grow the first container, then complete cleanup\nOf course, just copying the data from the second two containers to another drive and then removing both, growing the first is the simplest way to return to one container with all your space.\nDavid's comment to show the diskutil list will unlock someone giving you the exact commands needed to accomplish the rough sketch idea I've put in words here.\n\nA: I would make sure that I have a current and complete backup (and, knowing me, two separate backups) of all the data from the partitions.\nThen I would erase / remove all 3 partitions and start fresh from scratch.\nI have had issues combining partitions in the past and clearly, based on posts here, so have others.\nStarting fresh from scratch gives me the least worry solution.\n", "Q: QuickTime Player 10 doubles track duration My copy of QuickTime (10.5) on Mojave (10.14.6) is duplicating the duration of (some) tracks I open with it. It isn't modifying the files themselves; it's just the track window that displays twice the time it should. The entire second half is just silence.\n\nQuitting QuickTime Player and reopening it doesn't help. Neither does restarting my computer.\nQuickTime 7.6.6 (of which I have the Pro version) also does this.\nIt seems to happen only with m4a files, but not with all m4a files.\nWhat's going on, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I experienced the exact same issue today and found that AVPlayerItem.seekableTimeRanges seems to return this incorrect duration.\nFix:\nWhat fixed the issue for me was to rename the audio from m4a/mp4to the contained audio format aac.\nE.g. myCoolAudioFile.m4a-> myCoolAudioFile.aac\nEdit:\nWhat seems to be the root problem here is that Apple cant handle all container formats (I had a DASH container which caused this problem), to actually fix the root cause of this issue see here\n", "Q: macOS Music: Keyboard shortcuts: How to exit search? How to view library songs? I'm used to viewing my library songs and hitting command-f to filter the list. \nSince upgrading from iTunes to Music this year, command-f triggers the bizarre new search that gives results as bubbles and grids. And I can't seem to exit it via tab or escape or command-shift-f for \"filter\". \n\n\n*\n\n*What's the keyboard shortcut to exit this new search (is there one)? \n\n*Or, what's the keyboard shortcut to return to viewing my library songs? Apart from my playlists, it's the only view I ever want to see anyway. I don't subscribe to Apple Music or use iCloud to store my songs.\n\n*Or, what text can I enter into system prefs for these actions to create custom shortcuts for them? \n\n\nA: There is no shortcut to get back the functionality Apple changed. Unless the majority of people push back, I'd start looking for another player. I love the cesium player on iOS and hope it comes to MacOS as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.csmusicplayer.com\nIt refines the iTunes design of old and shares the same source library so I can choose how I interact. My guess is the vast majority of people use Siri to queue up music - so if you have playlists and can enable \"hey Siri\" on your Mac or shift to another way of searching / navigating / queuing music due to the change being forced on you. Sorry I don't have better ideas or suggestion - hopefully someone else can suggest a player that fits your needs if my two don't work, but Music is moving away from your setup and towards Siri / Apple Music / iOS / AppleTV / HomePod integration and search/control/discovery. I use the following two items to play audio / video on local storage, but can't see them as a good fit for replacing how iTunes used to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://mpv.io/installation/\n\n*https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html\n", "Q: Copy Time Machine network backup (SMB) to USB dirve I have Time Machine backup on SMB dirve (Synology).

I live in the UK but I'm going to the US during the Christmas holidays and was considering purchasing the phone over there, considering it works out to be about £150 cheaper. However I have concerns over whether there's any issues (anything from minor inconveniences to significant problems) with permanently using the US-bought iPhone 11 in the UK? I read that previous models had slight differences in hardware in different countries and that there were also warranty problems if buying the phone internationally. Are there any differences to be aware of with the iPhone 11 or is it exactly the same across all countries?\n\nA: I don’t recommend purchasing a US phone to be used in the UK. It’s not that it “won’t work” per se, but there are models specific to your region.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 11 Tech Specs US\n\n*iPhone 11 Tech Specs UK\nAt first glance, the Mobile and Wireless specification for the US lists the A2160 and A2161 models of the iPhone where as the UK  version lists the A2215 and A2218 models.  Specifically, there are differences in some of the FDD-LTE bands which could affect things like speed or particular service availability.  \nThe best course of action would be to confirm with your carrier as to what the differences of the US vs. the UK models would be in relation to your services.  \n", "Q: OSX HotCorner behaviour I'd like to know if there is a function that allows a hotcorner to trigger 'minimize current window in focus'.

Operation not permitted I have the following crontab on my mac OS Catalina 10.15.1 :\n* * * * * /Users/username/Desktop/cronjob.sh > /Users/username/Desktop/cronjob.log 2>&1\n\nWithin the command file is:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntouch /tmp/foo\n\nHowever I was left with the following line inside cronjob.log\n/bin/bash: /Users/username/Desktop/cronjob.sh: Operation not permitted\n\n\n\nWhy is operation not permitted event though the permissions for cronjob.sh is set to +x?\n\nA: In your case you have to add cron as \"parent\" app to the user's Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access apps/execs.\nDepending where to read the script from and where to write the log file to, you have to add cron to the Full Disk Access apps. Almost all default folders in the user's home are protected (Documents/Downloads/Desktop - I haven't checked Pictures/Movies/Music but I think they are protected too and obviously the wrong folders to add shell scripts or log files) by Catalina's system policy.\nIf the script and the log reside in user created and thus unprotected folders (e.g. the script in ~/bin and the log file in ~/log) it works without adding cron to the Full Disk Access group.\nTo add the exception:\n\n*\n\n*click the + button\n\n*hit ⌘⇧G\n\n*enter /usr/sbin\n\n*double click the cron file.\n\n\nYou can check this kind of errors by opening Console.app and searching for the shebanged exec in the script (here bash):\nerror   15:19:00.369105+0100    kernel  Sandbox: bash(4556) System Policy: deny(1) file-write-data /Users/user/Desktop/test/cronjob2.log\nerror   15:19:00.379093+0100    kernel  Sandbox: bash(4555) System Policy: deny(1) file-read-data /Users/user/Desktop/cronjob.sh\n\nIn the examples above cron wasn't added to the Full Disk Access group.\ncronjob2 was run from an unprotected folder ~/bin but tries to write the log file to the protected folder ~/Desktop/test/. So no read error but a write error.\ncronjob was run from a protected folder ~/Desktop and tries to write the log file to the protected folder ~/Desktop/. So a read error.\nInterestingly both log files are created - the first one (cronjob2.log) is empty though.\n", "Q: Installation of Win10 on MacBook4,1 I am trying to install Win10 on a MacBook 4,1. The Boot Camp Assistant doesn't download/find any drivers, so I had to choose the other option and download drivers by myself.\nAfter partitioning and booting from the Win10 installation CD, the setup is missing some drivers. But unfortunately the previous downloaded drivers don't help here.\nDo you have any ideas?\n\nA: The simplest answer is to install 32 bit Windows 7 with SP1 and then upgrade to 32 bit Windows 10. I say this because Apple officially supports 32 bit Windows 7 on your model Mac. Although Apple does not officially support Windows 10 for your model Mac, upgrading to 32 bit Windows 10 from 32 bit Windows 7 is should be supported by Microsoft. The Windows Support Software (the drivers) can be found by following the links on the Apple webpage Install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp. I believe the correct link should lead you to Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033. You will probably need the optical drive to be working in order to install Windows 7 by using the Boot Camp Assistant application. If the optical drive is not available, then read the other pertinent options given below.\nWindow 7 can be purchase rather cheaply. For example, this retailer offers Windows 7 Professional 32/64bit Download for 19.50 USD. You may still be able to upgrade to Windows 10 for free. See this article for details.\nYour Mac has a 64 bit processor with 2 cores (Core 2 Duo). If you want 64 bit Windows, then there potential problems you may need to overcome. Some of these problems and possible solutions are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*According to Microsoft, you will need at least 2 GB of memory.\n\n*If your Windows 7 media does not include SP1, then you should get a newer ISO file from the Microsoft website Download Windows 7 Disc Images (ISO Files). The download is free, but you will need to enter your Windows 7 product activation key to enable the download.\n\n*The current version of Windows 10 can found by clicking on this link. Note: the link is dependent on the browser you are using. In other words, Safari will goto a different website than Microsoft Edge goes to. While the download is free, you may still need to buy a license key to continue using Windows 10.\n\n*The Window Support Software may not work with 64 bit Windows. See the question Using Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033 to install 64 bit Windows 7, 8 or 10 for installation instructions.\n\n*Some 64 bit Windows installation configurations can both BIOS and UEFI boot. However, some early Intel Macs can not handle this type of configuration. If you have this problem, then you will need to remove the UEFI boot files. See the question “Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install for instructions. \n\n*The newer versions of macOS automatically install firmware updates. If you are running an older version of macOS (OS X) then you may need to manually install firmware updates. See About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers for more information.\n\n*If you do not have a working optical drive, then you can try installing Widnows by using the rather complex method described in the question No bootable device USB 2.0 MacBook Pro mid 2014.\n\n*User have reported being able to install Windows by using a flash drive. In my opinion, your Mac is to old, but I will include the following link anyway: Bootcamp - No ISO Option.\n\n", "Q: Moving photos to a new Mac from an old one - issues with permissions and iCloud OK here's the story. My wife's old Mac -- a late 2010 MacBook Air currently running Yosemite. We get a new Macbook Air (high end model) running Mojave. \nI use the Migration Assistant to transfer the data, it takes a while but it appears all is well, until we get to the photo library. \n\"Could not repair permissions\" it says. \nOK then. We have some photos on there but not all; it's stuff that was in iCloud storage. I think well, why not put all the photos from the old Mac into icloud and download it to the new one. \nSo I try this - we upgrade to 50GB but it says it isn't enough (even though when we upgraded it said it should hold the whole library). \nAll righty then, I think, I will see if I can't repair permissions on the old Mac and try again. \nBut here is where I am confused. Apple's support says that if I delete anything from iCloud it is \"Not available on any device\" even if I store the originals on the old Mac -- thank God I did a Time Machine backup. Does this mean that when I upload photos to iCLoud I give Apple complete control, and that deleting them removes them from every device? How do I keep the originals then? What happens when I connect the old Mac to the Internet, do all my photos get erased? \nSecondly, I want to just transfer the photo library once I fix the permissions on the old machine and I am unsure how to do that without doing the whole migration process again. If I have to do that fine, but I'd like to know if I can do photos only and save some time. \nThanks for your help, I hope this isn't too similar to what other people have asked, and if you answer pretend I am the dumbest person you ever met. :-) \n\nA: I suggest that you use the export function of photos. \n\n\n*\n\n*from the photos app\n.. be sure you click on the photos tab\n.. command+a to highlight all photos \n.. click on file  \n.. click on export \n.. export ...  [ you can pick either of the first two.  I don't know what you might want. If you have made photo edits in photos, you want the first one. ]\n\n\n\n*\n\n*if you did't export the photos to an external drive, copy the photos to an external drive.\n\n*use the import function on the other machine. \nMy view, in short, is that placing you photos in iCloud is a method for loosing them. I recommend you get your photos out of the Apple ecosystem and store them as one photo per file on multiple external storage devices. For long term storage, don't rely on usb memory sticks nor external ssd drives.  LoC does not have data on the reliability of usb memory sticks.  Apple seems to be saying do not store photos on external ssd drives.  One device should be off site.  Using a cloud service is fine.  Remember a lot of cloud services are sync services.  That is should the file be deleted on the local device, the photo will be deleted in the cloud.  For this reason,  I never install the cloud service software on my computer.  I use only file upload.  For those who complain, my assessment is that the apple Eco-system doesn't match Library of Congress's requirements for digital archiving.\ninformative video:\nhttp://www.digitalpreservation.gov/multimedia/videos/personalarchiving-photos.html\nprinted version\nhttp://www.digitalpreservation.gov/personalarchiving/photos.html\nGeneral information on digital preservation:\nhttp://www.digitalpreservation.gov/personalarchiving/\n", "Q: How to add a device to macOS Server?

Or add .local like you did in the web browser if you are only managing local devices. \nYou can find the local DNS name of any Mac by going to System Preferences > Sharing. And right at the top under the field with \"Computer Name\" it will give you the local network DNS name of that computer.

Thank you so much!! \n\nCurrent situation: \nWhen I start a new terminal session, I get: \nNo home directory: /Users/tori\nmkdir: //.bash_sessions: Permission denied\ntouch: //.bash_sessions/817C7D82-8749-4B96-9AC6-CAA07F9CE1B0.historynew: No such file or directory  \n$USER  / who / w / whoami   output: tori, the right user at least. \n$ finger tori  Outputs: .. Directory: /Users/tori  (note: there is not a Users/tori  when I cd into Users).\n\nCommands I ran leading up to current situation: \n$ sudo ln -s /Applications/tomcat-apache-9.0.30\n--- I did enter password. I realize I did not put the desired name of the link after this, doubt this caused the error. \n$ sudo chown -R tori /Applications/tomcat-apache-9.0.30\n--- I was NOT prompted to enter password\n$ sudo chmod +x /Applications/tomcat-apache-9.0.30/bin/*.sh I was NOT prompted to enter password\n$ sudo chmod +x ./bin/*.sh + I did enter password.

First, run ls -lae /usr/local/tori and verify its output. You should see your regular home directory contents (including Desktop, Documents, etc, and probably a bunch of dotfiles). Make sure they're all owned by your account. Make sure the \".\" entry (the directory itself) is also owned by you. (The parent directory, \"..\", might be owned by root or something; that's ok.) Some of the standard subfolders should have an ACL like \"0: group:everyone deny delete\" on them. (So should the directory itself, but if it had you wouldn't have been able to do this, so it must not be there.)\nIf things aren't all there, aren't owned by you, or anything else looks weird, stop and investigate further before proceeding.\nIf that looks ok, and /Users/tori doesn't exist, then you should be able to fix it with:\nsudo mv /usr/local/tori /Users/tori\n\nNote: in your question, you used a number of absolute-looking paths without the leading \"/\" (e.g. usr/local/tori instead of /usr/local/tori). The difference matters; if you use a path that doesn't start with \"/\" (or \"~\"), it'll be resolved relative to your current location, which might not be what you expect.\nAlso, since we don't know what caused this, I'd take a really close look at the catalina.sh script, to make sure this doesn't happen again. And make sure you have a good backup of your system, in case things do go sideways again.\n\nA: I would recommend restoring a backup of your entire disk from a time before the 'strangeness' happened. Manual methods will only work if you have identified everything that needs to be moved. \n", "Q: Saving macOS Catalina Screen Recordings Cache to External Drive Im macOS Catalina, screen recordings are temporarily stored in ~Library/ScreenRecordings before being saved on the target location. However, on systems with minimal available system storage, this can cause the recording to stop when disk space is full. Is there any way to link ~Library/ScreenRecordings to an external drive such as /Volumes/External\\ Drive/ScreenRecordings? \nI have tried using symbolic links, however the screen recording crashed immediately. Is there any other way to do this?\n\nA: You can try the following option:\n$ cd ~/Library/Containers/\n$ mv com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/ com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.backup/\n$ ln -s /Volumes/<NAME_OF_VOLUME>/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/ .\n\nIf the above option didn't help, then I would suggest you to:\nCheck the first comment on this page shared by bmike. \n", "Q: How can I convert US-format date and time into a date value so I can use the local date format? I am in Australia and use the default date formats here (dd/mm/yyyy). Unfortunately, BandCamp exports sales data using a US date format: \"m/d/yy h:mmpm\". For the most part, Numbers treats this as text since most of the values don't make sense as dates when reading in the local format.\nIs there a way to convert this text to an actual date value in Numbers? \nThe only function I have found that seems close is DATEVALUE, but it interprets the source data as d/m/yy, and so returns an error except where the dates make sense reversed. e.g. it returns an error for 1/18/19, and interprets 2/4/19 as 2 April 2019, when the source data means 4 February 2019.\n\nA: I had the same problem importing a .csv file into Numbers. The date is a string in the format ‘m/d/y h:mmpm’ where m has a length of 1 or 2, d has a length of 1 or 2, and y is a 2 digit year number. Here is the formula that I developed to change this to a date value. It should work for any date with a year in the 2000s (the value is in cell A1):\nDATE(\"20\" & MID($A1,FIND(\"/\",$A1,3)+1,2),LEFT($A1,FIND(\"/\",$A1,1)−1),MID($A1,FIND(\"/\",$A1,1)+1,FIND(\"/\",$A1,3)−1−FIND(\"/\",$A1,1)))\n\nA: *\n\n*Set the documents Language & Region setting to \"Englisch | United States of America\" in the respective dialog (File menu > Advanced > Language & Region).\n\n\nFormatting options for date cells in the Format sidebar should have US formatting now.\n\n\n*Import/paste the date data.\n\n\n*After importing/pasting, set the Language & Region setting (back) to \"English | Australia\". The pasted/imported cells with \"US\" dates will retain US date formatting. All other cells have AUS date formatting, so using DATEVALUE on the US formatted cells \"converts\" them to AUS date formatting.\n\nHope this makes sense, not an English native speaker.\n", "Q: Move Escape key on Touch Bar I keep accidentally hitting the Escape key when I'm typing. I'd like to move to more towards the center of the Touch Bar, or require a double-click to activate it. Is this possible?\n\nA: I have the same problem. You can use Bar None and then you will need to press the fn key in order to enable the Touch Bar, thus the Esc button too.\n\nhttps://shauninman.com/archive/2020/04/12/bar_none\n\n\nA: There’s no native way to move (or adjust the sensitivity of) the escape key on the Touch Bar. \nSome potential solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade to a new MacBook with a physical ESC key\n\n*Use Better Touch Tool to temporarily hide your entire Touch Bar (solutions below)\n\n*Use an external keyboard\n\n\nUsing BTT to hide the Touchbar\nThis solution was posed in a BTT GitHub issue:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Uncheck \"Show MacOS Control Strip\" and \"Show Escape Button\" in general touchbar settings.\n  \n*Create a button with no action and put a bunch of blank spaces in the name and make the button black (this moves the button you'll\n  create in the following step over to the right so your pinky won't hit it).\n  \n*Create a \"Toggle BTT Touchbar\" button with \"Toggle BetterTouchTool Touchbar\" as its action. This let's you get the standard touchbar back if/when you need it.\n  \n\nThis solution is from the Apple discussion board:\n\nClick \"TouchBar\"  Click \"General Touch Bar Settings\"  Check \"Enable\n  Touch Bar Support\"    Uncheck \"Show macOS Control Strip\"  Check Show\n  \"BTT icon in Control Strip\"   All Other items are unchecked   Click\n  Close     14  ￼   Click \"+ TouchBar Button\"   Give the button a Name...I\n  chose \"Unhide the Touch Bar with Satan Spawn ESC key\" For \"Predefined\n  Action:\" choose \"Toggle BTT Touch Bar” ￼    Click \"Advanced\n  Configuration\" for the button and choose where you want it to\n  appear...I chose the right side for \"Item Placement...\"   ￼   Now my\n  Touch Bar looks like this:   ￼   With nothing else on the Touch Bar:\n  ￼\n    This Touch Bar persists across all apps.

Then dedicate a physical key (e.g. CapsLock or backtick1) to ESC.\nMy test shows two layers of tissue can make it completely insensitive.\n", "Q: Mac OS Catalina, uneven battery drain in AirPods I have noticed something about my AirPods, and I want you to help me understand if this problem is due to AirPods or Mac OS.\nInitially, my AirPods were charged to 100%. But After a few hours of usage, I noticed that the left one was at 27% and the right one was at 9%, this got me wondering what causes it, because it's a brand new pair of AirPods.\nSo, I went into Settings -> Bluetooth -> AirPods (clicked the \"Options\" button) here:\n\nthat brought me to this screen:\n\nThe \"Microphone:\" setting has 3 options:\n\nI noticed that when I set it to \"Automatically Switch AirPods\", it only uses the right AirPod's microphone, I checked it by going into the Sounds settings here:\n\nand then when I tapped on my left AirPod, the \"Input level:\" bar didn't budge, and it only moved, when I tapped on the right AirPod.\nCould someone with AirPods and a Mac do the same test and confirm this for me? I'm trying to understand if going to Apple to fix this problem is going to be a waste of time for me or not, this could be a Mac OS issue after all.\n\nA: I noticed last night that my left pod drains faster than my right, and doing your test just now, I can see that (with Automatically Switch AirPods selected) my left pod microphone shows input volume but my right does not.\nUpdate: I have found that my AirPods (2nd Gen) are evenly charged with left and right double-tap turned off, and sound input set to internal microphone. I suspect that selecting AirPods for input source was the main issue.\n", "Q: How to make a bootable partition from scratch?

This might fix the problem as you could possibly work around a possible bug.\nApart from that, the only other possible fix is to copy all your files to a different disk. Then you can format this drive from scratch, and copy your files back.\n", "Q: Keyboard malfunction: Mac always opens in safe mode I am using a MacBook Pro and facing the following problem: \nMy keyboard is not working properly. Some keys don't work and it looks like the Shift key is always pressed because the machine always opens in Safe Mode. When the machine starts up I can work using my external keyboard and disable the internal keyboard but while starting up I can't, or at least don't know of a way to, disable the internal keyboard. \nIs there a way out of it or do I have to take a trip to the Apple Store?\nEdit: By a way out of it I mean is there a way I can change the start-up combination for Safe mode?\n\nA: On the basis of your current issue where you want to bypass Safe Mode, then \n\n\n*\n\n*Hold the Option button down on boot to bypass the Safe Mode ensures a normal boot\n\n\nHowever, you have mentioned that your keyboard is not working as expected. If you can afford it, I would recommend replacing the top case and keyboard. But, as an alternative \n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install KeyRemap4MacBook.\n\n*Use a combination of the functionalities of the Keyboard Viewer and KeyRemap4MacBook to figure out which shift key is the problem. \n\n*Disable the left/right shift key on KeyRemap4MacBook and click on the 'Reload XML' button to make that take effect.\n\n\nIf only one shift key was the problem, then you are done. If both shift keys were shorted, then its likely other keys are too. In which case you should probably just replace the entire thing. If you think other keys are not affected, then you can use KeyRemap4MacBook itself to remap the shift functionality to a lesser-used key like the Left Option key.\n\n\n*Under System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items , add KeyRemap4MacBook as an application that should start on login. This will ensure that you disable/remap of the shift key is active every time you log in.\n\n\nThings to remember\nRemember to hold down the Option key every time the computer boots or reboots to bypass safe mode. The fix above is at the software level. \nThe key is physically still shorted at the hardware level and will affect boot.\n\nA: I had the same issue with stuck left Shift forcing me into safe mode and couldn't fix it in software from macOS as the Shift is processed by the firmware before the operating system (or in fact anything) is loaded from disk.\nI didn't know about the Option trick in @Udhy answer and have now replaced the keyboard but it would be a better workaround than what I did which was to remove the keyboard ribbon cable from the logicboard.  You can see how to do this in step 24 in this iFixit guide but make sure to check the guide for your model.  \nIf you unplug the keyboard though you then have an issue turning the thing on so I therefore removed the battery as well and could then just turn it on by connecting the Magsafe cord but this means the CPU gets throttled in macOS.  In all not a great workaround.\nThe standard solution is to replace the whole top case (with keyboard, trackpad and battery) but this is expensive and you don't need do this if you are reasonably handy with a screwdriver.  You can get a kit with replacement keyboard/backlight and about 200 extremely tiny screws from ebay for around £20 and it is a slow, tedious but fairly easy process to replace just the keyboard.  I followed this YouTube guide and it took me about about 4 hours but I'm slow and had never done such a thing before.\n", "Q: Zip the contents of every sub-folder in a folder in Mac automatically I have this folder/file structure\nparent folder\n--subfolder1\n  -sub-subfolder\n  -file1\n  -file2\n--subfolder2\n  -sub-subfolder\n  -file1\n  -file2\n...\n\nI want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*create zip files from the contents of the subfolders. which means,\nfile1, file2, and sub-subfolder will be zipped, but not the enclosing subfolder.\n\n*name each zip file with the name of the folder, like subfolder1.zip,\nsubfolder2.zip...\nI'd prefer that the zip files remain in the related subfolder so it will be:\nparent folder\n--subfolder1\n  -sub-subfolder\n  -file1\n  -file2\n  -subfolder1.zip\n--subfolder2\n  -sub-subfolder\n  -file1\n  -file2\n  -subfolder2.zip\n...\n\nI am hoping that it would be possible with Automator but had no success till now.\nMy searches resulted in solutions that zip every folder individually with the folder itself, which in this case is not useful for me. I need the contents of the folders to be zipped.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Not sure about Automator, but you can easily accomplish this in Terminal.\nfind \"parent folder\" -type d -depth 1 -execdir sh -c 'cd \"$1\" && zip -r \"$1\" .' _ '{}' \\;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*find \"parent folder\" -type d -depth 1 lists all subdirectories of \"parent folder\" (just run it to see the result)\n\n*-execdir executes the part up to the \\; for each subdirectory found\n\n*sh -c 'cd \"$1\" && zip -r \"$1\" .' _ '{}' starts a subshell to change into the directory to pack and then zip the content there. The {} contains the name of the subdirectory and is the value $1 will be set to within the subshell, _ is syntactically required but the actual content is ignored.\n\n", "Q: How to retrieve photos back after iTunes backup upload in iPhone 7 and iOS 13? I have an iPhone 7 and i installed a backup which belongs to a few days ago. But i had several photos important i took yesterday. But i most probably didn't back them up. Is it still possible to bring them back? \nThanks in any advance.\n\nA: You can check to see if you have any backups of your iPhone on your computer with a tool like iBackup Extractor. You can access and browse the contents of such a backup (free) to see if your photos are there. If you want to extract more than 20 photos, though, you'll need to buy a licence.\n\nA: Unless they somehow made it to the recently deleted photos, they are probably gone.\nJust make sure you don't have an iCloud backup on your phone. \nSettings > tap your name at top > iCloud > iCloud Backups.\n", "Q: What causes my Macbook to spontaneously shut down? Out of the blue today, my Macbook Pro 2015 15\", running macOS Catalina 10.15.2, shut down while I was using it.\nSince then, for the past half hour or so, I haven't been able to keep it on for longer than a minute or so. It either spontaneously shuts down, requiring me to manually turn it back on, or it spontaneously restarts. Now (a day later) it only spontaneously shuts down. It doesn't restart itself.\nThis happens when it is plugged into the charger and when it is simply running on battery. This also happens while only headphones are connected to the MacBook, or while no peripherals are connected.\nApple Diagnostics shows \"No issues found.\"\nI have tried resetting SMC and NVRAM.\nAdditionally, when starting up I notice weird graphical glitches, for example a white bar sometimes appears on the left side of the screen, or the apple logo repeatedly resizes itself, or a regular pattern of white rectangles appears across the whole screen.\nI got a picture of that:\n\nThis flashes onto the screen after the first apple logo appears.\nThe Macbook does not spontaneously shut down or restart when I boot it into Recovery Mode or Safe Mode.\nHowever, there are also graphical glitches in both of these modes; look at the terminal tabs in Recovery Mode:\n\n\nMoving the mouse cursor over the tabs causes them to scintillate randomly, rectangular monochrome patterns. and glitches.\nExactly the same graphical glitch happens to Finder tabs in Safe Mode.\nWhy does my Macbook restart like that after I've booted it normally? How do I resolve this problem?\n\nA: Your symptoms are either a bad driver / os for the video subsystem or a hardware failure. \nIn case of hardware, safe mode will often run since it doesn’t ask as much of the video system which runs in a fail safe / basic mode. Also, it can slow down the rendering so you can easily see the failure modes or grab a screen shot. \nBefore paying for a repair, consider charting how often this happens and back up / erase install to be sure this is the hardware / vram failing. \nAs to the shutdown, unless there’s a severe failure, you should get. A kernel panic, but if the logs show no events and no panics, then that’s another reason to suspect hardware failure. \nSince your mac won’t run more than 5 minutes in normal mode, why not back it up in safe mode and try an erase install. If your Mac can’t reinstall itself, then you know it’s repair time. If it can, you’ll be back in business \n", "Q: Catalina Mail super slow when composing new emails?

Sadly, I haven't found any method of disabling autoplay. If it's possible, how can I disable autoplay? My question\nHow can I disable the YouTube Kids autoplay feature — on iOS, on MacOS, or on any other platform?\nPlease assume:\n\n*\n\n*I own a non-jailbroken iPhone.\n\n*I have administrator rights on my computer.\n\n*I can freely install any desktop browsers, mobile browsers, extensions, and/or userscripts that you want me to install.\n\n*I can also install uBlock Origin on my computer, and can create any custom element-hiding or script-blocking rules that you suggest.\n\nBackground to my question\n\"YouTube Kids\" is YouTube's official interface for kids 12 and under. It isn't 100% safe for kids, but it's still cleaner than regular YouTube.\nChildren can watch YouTube Kids through the iOS app, through the Android app, or directly on the website.\nIt looks like autoplay is always on, and there's no way to shut it off. This means that, after one video finishes, the next one starts automatically. I think this is a suboptimal design, especially for kids. Various sources suggest that autoplay makes the service more addictive and mind-numbing.\nI've looked in the parental settings and the kids' settings, and have found no way to disable autoplay.\nThere's a \"timer\" feature which lets you schedule the app to stop working in a configurable number of minutes from now (e.g. 30 minutes), but setting a timer is not the same as simply disabling autoplay.\nThis article indirectly implies that, on iOS, it may be possible to disable autoplay. But maybe that article is outdated and it's impossible nowadays.\nEdit\nI've made a Reddit post. The post asks about the idea of somehow using uBlock Origin to disable autoplay in the YouTube Kids web app. If that doesn't work, maybe I'll ask some userscripting community.\n\nA: I checked on iOS 12.4, YouTube kids app, there's no feature for autoplay settings. It is \"on\", on web and on app.  Alternatively, I am not very experienced in user scripts, but can suggest a potential, easy algorithm. \nWhen the current video time = (total video time - 1) seconds, pause video. \nI have no idea how to write it, but you can get help from sites like \n\n\n*\n\n*https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/by-site/youtube.com?site=youtube.com&q=autoplay \n\n*Github etc.\n\n\nDo note that some Safari versions might resist installing user scripts, but if you have uBlock origin installed, your version should be good to go. \n\nA: This can be achieved by the Vinegar.app.\nWhat it basically does is that it queries the video as though it was requested onto an iPad with at least 1080p resolution, and once the video finishes, it will simply show video offers based on YouTube's algorithm, but it will not start playing unless it is a playlist you are listening to.\nThe app comes as a package though.\nCons\nTwo shortcoming of this solution are that\n\n*\n\n*the next song and previous song buttons in playlists are not available if in use; and\n\n*1080p is the highest resolution available.\n\nPros\nAdditional advantages include that\n\n*\n\n*it blocks all video ads;\n\n*one no longer has to confirm \"[they are] there\";\n\n*videos won't jump to any random YouTube-choice video;\n\n*the \"replay\" button with same label not only is available after, but throughout playback as well;\n\n*videos can be popped out as a floating window (just like on iPad or on some iPhones); and\n\n*left and right arrows to jump 15 seconds never screw up by increasing or decreasing volume (volume is controlled by the up and down arrow if you hover over the volume virtual button).\n\n", "Q: Finder does not launch from Dock unless I click on the icon and New Finder Window I am using a Mac mini 2010 with MacOS Sierra 10.12.6.\nToday, I deleted and re-created my Finder preferences after the originals became corrupted.\nClicking on Finder (the blue smiley-face square) within the Dock did not work unless I went to Open New Finder Window.\nThe Desktop works, no issue there.\nIs there a way within MacOS Sierra to get it to open automatically by clicking on the icon, like with other apps in Dock, such as Firefox or Terminal?\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\nA: Tick the second option listed in Mission Control Preferences. \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application.\"\n\n", "Q: Apple Photos error: \"The library could not be opened.

Suppose I connect my iPhone (12.4) to a Wi-Fi network and turn on personal hotspot, which requires me to turn on Cellular. Now if I connect the Mac via lightning cable, I see \"1 connection\" in the blue strip.\nHow can I check which one of Wi-Fi and mobile data is being shared? \nHint: I use organizational Wi-Fi. \n\nA: Regardless of how you connect to your iPhone acting a a personal hotspot, whether it be via WiFi or tethered via cable, you are sharing the cellular data connection.\nSo, using your example, where your iPhone is initially connected to the corporate WiFi and then you enable the Personal Hotspot feature, you will disconnect from the corporate WiFi and a private (NAT) network will be created with a gateway configured through your cellular network.  Whether you use WiFi or connect via USB, this network will be created\nFrom Apple Support:\n\nA Personal Hotspot lets you share the cellular data connection of your iPhone or iPad (Wi-Fi + Cellular) when you don't have access to a Wi-Fi network.\n\nWhy is this the case?  Your iPhone can only connect to a single WiFi network at any given time.  The Personal Hotspot is designed to provide a WiFi signal where you don't have one.  This configuration cannot be changed.\n\nFinding your Gateway....\nIf you want to see which connection you’re using (which has priority) for the Internet you just need to get the IP addresses of you adapters and run a trace route to see the path.\n(Values below are from my iMac; en0 is wired, en1 is WiFi connected to hotspot.  Your values will differ.)\n$ ifconfig en0 | egrep -iw inet\ninet 192.168.1.54 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255\n\n$ ifconfig en1 | grep -iw inet\ninet 172.20.10.3 netmask 0xfffffff0 broadcast 172.20.10.15\n\n$ traceroute apple.com | head -n 1\n 1  pfsense (192.168.1.1)  0.481 ms  0.312 ms  0.329 ms\n\nYou will get a output telling you which gateway is being used for Internet traffic.  In my case, it's showing me that I'm going through my en0 or wired network adapter.\nYou could use the netstat -rn command to get your default gateway, but I've found that you can have multiple gateways.\n$ netstat -rn | egrep default\n default            192.168.1.1        UGSc          125      109     en0\n default            172.20.10.1        UGScI           7        0     en1\n\nThis is why I like to use traceroute to actually (and quickly) \"see\" where the traffic is going.\nMeasuring Bandwidth....\nThe only way to measure bandwidth is to use a utility (service) like vnStat.  It's available via MacPorts or Homebrew.  The system, by default is not measuring bandwidth usage so you'll need a service that gets loaded at boot (or at the users request) to begin logging this data.\nA sample output (assuming 2 interfaces) would look like the following:\n(with 2 interfaces)\n$ vnstat\n                      rx      /      tx      /     total    /   estimated\n Internet (eth1):\n       2018-09     31.90 GiB  /   28.05 GiB  /   59.95 GiB\n       2018-10    281.04 MiB  /   99.45 MiB  /  380.49 MiB  /   12.05 GiB\n     yesterday      1.23 GiB  /  473.23 MiB  /    1.69 GiB\n         today    281.04 MiB  /   99.45 MiB  /  380.49 MiB  /     397 MiB\n\n Local (eth0):\n       2018-09     25.13 GiB  /  116.94 GiB  /  142.07 GiB\n       2018-10    234.75 MiB  /    5.03 GiB  /    5.26 GiB  /  170.76 GiB\n     yesterday    520.55 MiB  /    2.21 GiB  /    2.72 GiB\n         today    234.75 MiB  /    5.03 GiB  /    5.26 GiB  /    5.51 GiB\n\n\nA: I thought of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if any intranet webpage is reachable on the Mac. It wouldn't be, that confirms cellular data usage. \n\n*Check \"What is my ip\" on the iPhone once while using cellular, once using Wi-Fi. Then match those with the one on the Mac. It matches with cellular's. One can also use utilities listed in Allan's answer.\n", "Q: How to set up sidecar without giving Apple your account password? Please demonstrate how to set up an iPad using sidecar to both a MacBook Pro and an iMac without giving Apple access to your local computer's account password (which can be used to decrypt all of your files offline if someone is physically seated at your powered-off computer).\nRules:\n\n\n*\n\n*Must have two-factor authentication enabled (because I have an Apple developer account, fml).\n\n*All devices must have only one user account.\n\n*Switching the iPad between the MacBook Pro and iMac must not require resetting your passwords.\n\n*You must not give Apple your correct password in this box*:\n\n\n*If you give Apple a fake or alternate password (and then switch the correct password (for #4)) then you must show that sidecar consistently works after the new correct password (which Apple does not have) is in effect.\n\n\n\n* Why not just give Apple your password?\nApple claims in the screen before the above \"your password cannot be read by Apple\". This is a very weak claim. And Apple (or its agent or compelling party) might still guess and verify your password without technically \"reading\" it. This is how a significant number of password compromises happen in the wild today.\n\nA: If you equate giving apple your password to typing the admin credentials, then you can’t do this without a privilege escalation / security vulnerability. Those usually pay $25,000 to $250,000 so if anyone has one - get your money from apple before posting here how to hack your mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/payouts/\nIf you just need us to confirm you aren’t sending your password off device in the prompt you showed, you are set. Use the admin password and understand that Apple doesn’t send your password off the device, it entangles a local key with a downloaded public key and then stores the results in your keychain.\nApple already has your iCloud password so it doesn’t need to record / steal / transmit your local password for sidecar to work. I understand you would love to have someone show you the way, but as I read it, your intentions are good but your threat model analysis is faulty here.\n", "Q: Does Pages support LaTeX extensions? Is there a location where I can install LaTeX plugins so that I can use the commands in the plugins which are not native to LaTeX in the equation editor in Pages? Or does Pages not support that?\nSpecifically, I have the mhchem package which I'd like to install to write out chemical formulae – a feature not supported natively and is added by the mhchem package. \n(Yes, I'm aware that I can just write the documents in LaTeX directly, but I'd prefer writing it in Pages if at all possible.)\n\nA: Pages does not support loading LaTeX packages (they're not called plugins, but packages in LaTeX terminology). So you cannot just load up for example chemfig from CTAN that you mention.\nApple provides the following page describing the commands that are supported:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202501\nPages does not include a full LaTeX environment, and is only able to render a subset of LaTeX commands.\nFor my own purposes I have used ordinary LaTeX rendered to PDF that I can drag-n-drop to Pages. As it is PDF it can be resized inside Pages without loosing quality.\nIn order to do that you need LaTeX installed. An easy way to get it installed is to install MacTex, which includes LaTeX.\nYou can download MacTeX from here:\nhttp://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html\nOr if you have HomeBrew, you can use that to first install HomeBrew Cask and then install MacTeX using the following commands:\nbrew tap caskroom/cask\n\nbrew cask install mactex\n\nFor rendering to PDF you can use the pdflatex command or a GUI tool such as texpad.\n", "Q: Fixing an LED Home Cinema display caused whistling and a spark, is it salvageable? I was given an LED Cinema Display 1920x1200 from December 2008. I was able to fix a similar one because of a software issue on the owner's computer.\nI was told that\nit was working intermittently, showing the computer screen and turning off soon\naftewards. It stayed in a slightly damp basement for one year: when I opened it\napart, it had a bit of mold on the metal.\nI connected it to my mac computer and the display showed nothing. I took it\napart and inspected the two boards, which seemed fine, although some of the\nmetal on the power supply board had a layer of rust. I tightened the internal\ncable connections, left the cable for sensor-2 disconnected because it was too\nshort to be connected when the screen was loose, and plugged it to power without\na connection to a computer: the logic board whistled, had a spark, and produced\nsmoke for a few seconds until I unplugged the power cable. I checked the logic\nboard again and the damage was not apparent. I plugged the cable again, with no\nwhistling, spark, or smoke this time, and connected the mini-display cable: the\nmonitor displayed nothing but the fan was on high gear. I tried with several setups for the\nsensor-2 cable: disconnected, connected one way, and connected the\nother way. The result was the same: no display on the screen and high speed on the fan.\nDoes the whistling and the spark mean that one of the two boards is fried? If so, Apple has discontinued the product and does not seem to\nsell the parts, so I'd need to buy from a reseller with the risk of\nincompatibility. If so, Apple has discontinued the parts, so the cost and risk of second-hand parts to fix a 10-year old monitor seem large compared to the\nmore modern options available.\nThe display is also missing a glass screen: does it play a role beyond aesthetics, e.g. in filtering UV from the backlit display?\nI read this thread and this\none,\nand I think I have a different problem.\n\nA: \ncaused whistling and a spark, is it salvageable?  Does the whistling and the spark mean that one of the two boards is fried?\n\nThis sounds like you shorted something to ground.  The whistling is most likely from a blown capacitor.  I've intentionally shorted them for demo purposes and some did in fact whistle.  While it could be a different component, my bet is a blown cap.\n\nthe logic board whistled, had a spark, and produced smoke for a few seconds\n\nThis is a classic case of \"you let the magic smoke out.\"  In all seriousness, a spark and the sign/odor of smoke is a clear indication that you shorted something causing it to blow.\nNow, there should be two boards - the power supply and the logic board.  It's entirely possible that the damage is to the logic board but the descriptors used point to the power supply.  Either way, without putting hands and eyes on it, we can only \"best guess\" it at this point.\n\nIt stayed in a slightly damp basement for one year: when I opened it apart, it had a bit of mold on the metal....although some of the metal on the power supply board had a layer of rust\n\nOh, oh.  This is a very good indicator that there are shorted connections.  Water may cause mold which in and of itself is easy to deal with, but moisture causes corrosion which is conductive.  Rust?  That too is conductive and should have at least been removed.\nCan it be salvaged?\nTechnically yes.  But is it worth it?  I doubt it.\nLogic boards and power supply boards can have components replaced quite easily. However, being that there is corrosion and rust with an unknown amount of time \"infecting\" the PCB; it's impossible to tell how much damage and how many layers are workable.\nYou may have to get replacements.  They are available on second hand markets like eBay.  (Apple no longer sells or supports these monitors).  However you're ultimately spending money and time on what amounts a 10 year old FHD monitor.  I have three in my garage right now (19 to 22\") that I can't even give away.\nThis is probably something you want to sell as parts given the likely damage and the missing glass (which protects the LCD, prevents dust and contaminates from getting in, and enhances the colors).

Here's the screenshot:\n\nI've checked through all my folders, and adding all the items in (from the above window) Documents -> File Browser, as well as every other unique item in the sidebar, comes to roughly 445GB. So all my files take up less than half of my storage space, while this Other takes up nearly the rest! I am unable to work productively (recording videos) as I have no room to store them. Where can I find out what this is, and how to delete/remove/edit its contents? This problem didn't occur on my other computer (also running Catalina). \nEdit\nI have tried these solutions from the duplicated question and from the Apple forums, and neither of them have worked, even after restarting multiple times.

It has a free trial so you can use it without buying it.  There is also a free app called Disk Inventory X which does about the same but lists the sizes of everything it \"sees\". It also makes a colored map of you disk. I highly recommend you use these to scan your disk. \nHow can I figure out what's slowly eating my HD space?\n and linked: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/linked/5353\n\nA: I find Apple's breakdown of Storage to be neither reliable nor informative. \nIf you're running out of space and can't explain why, then first thing to do is to boot into Safe Mode. Then Restart normally. This process may let the OS do some housekeeping, deleting temporary files and some caches. \nNext, use an app like OmniDiskSweeper, or DaisyDisk. These will show you the contents of your entire drive, sorted by size. You can then dive into the biggest folder, and see what the biggest sub-folder is, and so on, until you identify what's using up the space. \nNow comes the tricky part: Obviously, you can delete your own large files - documents, videos, etc; but some large files created by the OS or installed by applications may cause problems if removed, depending on what they are. So some caution and checking needs to take place. \nFor that reason, and others, I would not recommend using apps that claim to 'clean', 'purge', or otherwise maintain your Mac.\nAlso, don't try to delete Time Machine local snapshots unless the dates are more than 24 hours old.\nIf you're working with large video files, it's probably best to get a high-speed USB or Thunderbolt external drive and use that as a 'workspace' drive. \n", "Q: What CAD software is depicted in this screenshot? This screenshot (source here) apparently depicts a CAD software (German version) for macOS:\n\nWhat software is it?\n\nA: The software is called SketchUp.

However in the Messages app when I long press on a message and choose “Speak” nothing happens. I’ve noticed this issue with two of my friend's phones as well. Any idea how to fix this?\n\nA: I went into the accessibility settings within the settings in iOS. Under speak selection, I turned the feature off and then turned it back on. And now it works. You might give that a try:\nSettings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > ...\nTurn off “Speak Selection”, and turn it back on.\nThat seemed to do the trick.\n\nA: It seems that the update to iOS 13.4.1 solves the problem with the failure to speak selection.\n", "Q: Is it safe to super glue a broken fan connector back to the logic board? While I was replacing my mid-2010 Macbook's HDD with an SSD, I accidentally dropped a screw and it got stuck somewhere behind the logic board. I removed the fan so I can retrieve the screw through there. I successfully removed the screw, but during the process I ripped the female fan connector from the logic board, leaving only the pads. \nThankfully, the connection still works if I hold the connector there, but once I release it the fan stops working.\nI don't have a soldering iron and I'm currently in a rural area so I can't go to the store to buy one if I order it online it arrives in at least a week and I can't wait that long.\nCan I just super glue it back on? Or would epoxy be better?\n\nA: Epoxy and\\or super glue may be very effective at gluing the connector to the PCB, but there’s no way to ensure you get a proper connection with the pads on the PCB.  It will be a one shot deal - if you don’t get it right the first time, you’ll be out of luck on subsequent tries.\nI need to be clear here...  I understand that you need this laptop now so time is critical.   This avenue of repair is highly likely to fail (though you could get lucky) and will end up costing you much, much more down time than if you took the time to get the right tool for the job.   \nHow might it fail?  You could mis-align the connectors or you could get glue/epoxy between the connector and pad insulating it.  You’ll cause more damage trying to remove the connector to retry the repair\nYou might want to look up TV repair shops in your area as this repair would be something they could do as it’s a very simple job.\n\nA: I would put a piece of foam above it and test if the cover would give enough pressure to make it work then.\nUsing glue could cause more, and more serious, damage when you come to repairing it properly.\n", "Q: How do I burn a movie DVD on MacOS Catalina without additional software? I can burn a data DVD on MacOS Catalina but getting a movie DVD burned is escaping me.  Is this possible without additional software?\nA VIDEO_TS folder is what I am looking to burn... VLC plays this perfectly including displaying the DVD menu.  How can I burn this?\n\nA: No. Sadly, since Apple discontinued iDVD, there is no built-in way to burn a movie DVD. \nBurn is an excellent free utility for creating audio, video and file storage on optical media.\n\nA: iMovie used to have \"Burn to DVD\".  iDVD let you do this and create a menu system.  But sadly those features are all gone.  Most computers no longer have a DVD/Blu-Ray burner/reader anymore.\nRoxio Toast (commercial software ... so this ruins the \"without additional software\" part of your question) still seems to support this.  If you bomb out on no-cost options... this might be a (non-free) solution.\n\nA: I've been trying to use Burn to create save some home videos to DVD, but they won't play in my Samsung player.  I've tried burning to both DVD-R and DVD+R discs...both create discs that play just fine on my Mac using the built-in DVD player application, but when I pop those discs into my Samsung Blu-ray player, it ejects them with an error message saying something like \"Can't play disc.\"\n\nA: \nI can burn a data DVD on MacOS Catalina but getting a movie DVD burned is escaping me. Is this possible without additional software? A VIDEO_TS folder is what I am looking to burn...\n\nYes, it is possible to burn a VIDEO_TS to DVD (that will play in standard DVD players) without the use of any third-party software in Catalina. The following steps were tested under macOS 10.15.7 and Disk Utility 19.0 (1704):\n\n*\n\n*Disk Utility → File → New Image → Image from Folder...\n\n*Select the parent folder of VIDEO_TS (which should not contain anything other than the VIDEO_TS directory) → Choose\n\n*Enter desired filename and location for the new disk image → select \"DVD/CD master\" as the Image Format → Save\n\n*Once the disk image has been saved, right click it in Finder and select \"Burn Disk Image 'foo.cdr' to Disc...\" → Burn\n\nOn a 7.4GB test directory, Disk Utility created a disk image of 8.55GB, while hdiutil created a disk image of just 7.4GB in one step: hdiutil makehybrid -udf -udf-volume-name foo -o foo.iso /path/to/parent/dir/of/VIDEO_TS (as above, the VIDEO_TS parent directory should not contain anything else).\nSources: Apple's Create a disk image using Disk Utility on Mac and UCLA's Burn DVD from VIDEO_TS folder (Mac OS X)\n", "Q: Can I not share external hard drives through my Macbook's standard file sharing system? I'm trying to share an external hard drive through lan file sharing (SMB). The sharing works for folders and file in my Macbook. I have set up a “Sharing” account that I give access to the files I want to share. \nThe problem is that the “plus” button to add a user with access to that folder is greyed out when I select the hard drives, so I cannot add my file sharing account. And the users that already have access cannot be edited, they're also greyed out, as is the minus button. Basically I cannot edit anything. \nI have also tried using my administrator account since that one is already added to the folder's users with access list, but I cannot make SMB work with that account. \nThe hard drives are in ExFat and Fat32 formats. I know I can share them through my WiFi router, but I need to share them through my Macbook.\nI tried adding my Sharing account to the Permissions box on the Get Info dialogue, but PathFinder didn't let me save the changes (it didn't give me a reason), and Finder just says that “You can read and write” but doesn't show me any other options to add, subtract, edit or see other users with access. \nI don't know if this is a sharing issue, a permissions issue or both.\nSo, is sharing an external hard drive possible? If so, what am I missing?\n\nA: To add to @nohillside answer you can share a FAT32 formatted drive but not set  permissions as the filesystem doesn't support it.\n\nIf you want to control access to files on the USB by permissions then format it using a filesystem that supports it (such as HFS) and changes will be avaliable in File Sharing.\n\n\nA: ExFAT/FAT32 don't support file/folder ownership, so you can't assign access rights or users to them (neither for local use nor for sharing).\n", "Q: Calendar Issues while traveling When traveling the calendar shows my appointments in local time, where I am at the moment. If I'm in Tokyo, for example, my 8 PM appointment next week in St Paul will show up as 5 AM. The settings are not the same for Mac and iOS, and there seems to be no way to globally force these applications to simply act as a paper calendar would, nor can I find any apps that will do that. It's crazy, frustrating and incomprehensible. I certainly understand why some people need that feature, but with computers this powerful those of us who don't need an option. This issue has been going on for years. I've dealt with any number of Apple support people both on the phone and at Genius Bars, and there's simply no way to get this to work. \nOn the Mac, there's a feature called \"floating\" which does that, but it has to be engaged for each appointment that I make, and it doesn't exist on iOS, so if I make an appointment on my phone I can't do that...\nThe question is, is there ANYTHING out there that can work as a simple paper calendar? Set it and forget it, what you put in is what you get. If I haven't explained myself clearly, I just want to ignore time zones completely, deal with absolute times. \n\nA: Most third party calendar tools on iOS offer this. I can really recommend fantastical, which offers the option you're looking for. See this site.\n\nTime Zone Override: When enabled, Fantastical will always show dates and times in the selected time zone. When disabled, Fantastical 2 will use the time zone configured in iOS's Settings app. This option is useful if you are traveling but still want to see your schedule in your home time zone.\n\n\nA: Switch to another calendar app if you wish, but you can continue using the iOS Calendar app since Time Zone Override is a function of iOS Settings.\n\n", "Q: In Shortcuts on iPadOS and iOS, where is the Adjust Date action? I found a way to end an event 50 minutes after I started it using Adjust Date.

I am having an issue recently which causes my MacBook Pro 2015, 15\", to spontaneously (and randomly?) shut down.\nThese shut downs do not happen in Recovery Mode or Safe Boot.\nTemporarily, before I am able to identify and fix the root cause, I would like to continue using my laptop.\nI am actually very happy using Safe Boot for now, I can do almost everything I want to do.\nHowever, I can't figure out how to enable audio output while in Safe Boot mode.\nI know it's not really intended, so possible workarounds may be awkward, but how can I hear the sound output from my MacBook while it is in Safe Boot?\nThe only external speakers I have access to are my iPhone 7's (iOS 13.3) and lots of pairs of headphones (although idk if those count as \"external speakers\"). I added this information because I wonder if it's possible to stream the sound output through my iPhone perhaps (network connectivity seems to work fine while in Safe Boot), if it is indeed impossible to play audio on the MacBook while in Safe Boot.\n\nA: I have the exact same problem with my 15\" mid-2010 MacBook Pro.  It does not suddenly reboot when in Safe Boot-- only in the normal boot.  Apple is aware of this problem but will not assign even one engineer to look into this problem as I have been complaining to them for over 6 years about this.\nI was told that possibly the battery needs to be changed-  but Apple stopped making batteries for this model years ago.\nSo, theonlygusti, if you change the battery and it works properly or not, please let me know.

I'm working on a C++ program in Xcode, which opens some files in the project folder, which is in ~/Documents/Xcode Projects. Because it's in my Documents folder, every time I run the program, it asks for permissions to access my documents folder, and I have to click yes every time. I tried explicitly giving the program permission in the settings, and that works for a little bit, but after about 3 runs of the program it asks for permissions again. Can I just disable the document folder protection? How?\n\nA: The easy way is to turn off sandboxing for the app, in Xcode project settings under \"capabilities\". You might not want that though.\nOtherwise you probably need a security-scoped bookmark to the directory. When you get access, create a bookmark from the directory URL using bookmarkData(options:includingResourceValuesForKeys:relativeTo:). Make sure to use .withSecurityScope in the options argument. Save that to user defaults. Then when you want to use the directory,\n\n\n*\n\n*Read the bookmark from user defaults\n\n*Initialize the URL using init(resolvingBookmarkData:options:relativeTo:bookmarkDataIsStale:) with options of [.withSecurityScope, .withoutUI].\n\n*Call .startAccessingSecurityScopedResource() before trying to use the URL.\n\n*Call .stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource() when you're done with the URL.\n\n", "Q: Xcode Build Error: No account for team \"S23Q9DM44M\" Xcode builds a barcode reader app without error for the simulator, however, the build for an iPhone XR returns errors:\n\nERROR MESSAGE\nNo account for team \"S23Q9DM44M\".

Signing is tied to your Apple developer account, so you must be logged in to that account in Xcode in order to sign the app-- even if you're not going to use the app store. You can't build the app and deploy it to an iPhone without signing. The simulator doesn't need signing, which is why it works there.\nS23Q9DM44M is a team ID. It might be a team you belong to, or it might be another team (if you got this project from someone else). Xcode is telling you that it doesn't currently have access to this team, so it can't sign the app.\nYou need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Xcode preferences, in the \"accounts\" section, and log in to your Apple developer account. If you don't have an account, you need to create one first. You can do this at https://developer.apple.com/programs/. It's free if you're not going to use the app store.\n\n*Go to this project's \"signing and capabilities\" settings. In the \"team\" section, make sure the correct developer team is selected. This might just be your name, or it might be a company or group that you work with. Then, check the provisioning profile setting. It might say \"Xcode managed profile\", in which case you're set. If it shows a pop-up menu, use it to select a provisioning profile.\nUpdate: I tried the Github project you linked to. Besides the above, you also need to change the bundle ID for the app. Your question doesn't mention any bundle ID issues but that's because you had something else to fix first.\nThe bundle ID of iOS apps must be unique since it's how iOS identifies the app. Apple checks the bundle ID when compiling and tries to register it with your developer account. If someone else is using the ID then you need to change it. This is also found in the \"signing and capabilities\" page in Xcode. The ID can be anything unique but the normal format is a reverse domain name-style ID. For example your domain were apple.stackexchange.com then you might use com.stackexchange.apple.barcodescanner.\n", "Q: Can I use iOS 13+ without creating a passcode? I was given a hand-me-down iPhone and I just installed the update to 13.3 and upon booting after the update it's prompting me to create a passcode. I do not see any option to skip creating a passcode as I saw previously when I first set up the phone. \nIs there any way to skip creating a passcode entirely, or is it required by newer versions of iOS? Is there any way to bypass the requirement?\nScreenshot. After the update I get the \"Hello\" screen followed by a \"Software Update Complete\" screen with a \"Continue button\" which leads to the \"Create a Passcode\" screen below. If I select \"Passcode Options\" I get only what is displayed here. The phone was factory reset last week and I never created a passcode. Tapping cancel takes me back to the \"Create a Passcode\" text or number entry. I can't seem to bypass this screen in any way and notifications are blocked. I assume that this is a thing in iOS 13 that now requires a passcode full stop, but I couldn't find any confirmation of that in my searches (everything that comes up is nonsense about bypassing a passcode if you forgot it, which is totally irrelevant).\n\n\nA: Cancel passcode options, go back (top-left button) until Touch ID setup, and don’t set up Touch ID (skip). Then when prompted for a passcode, choose Passcode Options and an option will exist for not setting a passcode.\nIf you can’t go back to Touch ID setup, enter a passcode to get through setup, then once the device is set up, go to Settings and disable Touch ID, then you can turn off passcode.\nThe text at the top of the page in your photo is different depending on whether you have enabled Touch ID or not. In this case, you have enabled Touch ID, therefore a passcode is required. If you don’t use Touch ID, you have the option for no passcode.\n", "Q: How to test what my audio output latency is on MacBook? I am trying right now to test my auditory reaction time using a script I wrote at the command line (using the classic echo -ne '\\007' beep).\nI am getting reaction times always greater than 340 ms. When I try this with a visual prompt (echo go) instead, I am getting about 280 ms.\nApparently human audio reaction time should be faster than visual reaction time (according to lots of published studies).\nOf course, it could be that my visual reaction time is faster, but how can I check what my MacBook audio output latency actually is?\n\nA: You really cannot measure the latency \"through\" the OS because of the overhead of queuing and managing the processes.  To be \"more accurate\" you'd need to write a program that could directly access the kernel so that you could evaluate the actual time between events - the beep and the keypress.  \nHowever, you can get fairly close in bash by using the time function. I've created a basic bash script that will prompt the user to press Enter after waiting for a beep to occur after a random period.  \n# generate a random number between 3 and 10 for seconds to wait for beep\nt=$(( ( RANDOM % 10 ) + 3 ))\n\necho \"When you hear the beep, press Enter!\"\necho\necho\n\nsleep $t\n\n# beep the computer and get the time\ntime echo -ne '\\007'\n\n# wait for keypress and get the time\ntime read keypress \n\nYou'll get three time values twice.  They are defined as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Real - the time start to finish of the call measured if you had a stopwatch in hand.  This accounts for all processes running at the time.\n\n*User - this is the time spent in the user space outside the kernel and is the actual CPU time spent executing the task\n\n*Sys - this is the time spent inside the kernel and is also the actual time spent by the CPU.\n\n\nFor more information on this see Real, User and Sys process time statistics.\n\nSo, in order of accuracy, Real is in the ballpark, User is pretty darn close, and Sys is dead on balls accurate, as far as the CPU is concerned.\nSample Output:\nWhen you hear the beep, press Enter!\n\nreal    0m0.000s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m0.000s\n\nreal    0m0.812s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m0.000s\n\nIn the above example it shows that the latency according to the computers \"stopwatch\", there was a .812s difference between when I heard the beep and pressed Enter.  The resolution of the time utility is not granular enough to measure the time elapsed to execute each command so we assume it happened \"immediately.\"\nRunning it again....\nWhen you hear the beep, press Enter!\n\nreal    0m0.003s\nuser    0m0.001s\nsys     0m0.002s\n\nreal    0m0.924s\nuser    0m0.001s\nsys     0m0.002s\n\nFrom this one, we can see that there was some overhead that caused the process to account for more time.  If we subtract the top values from the bottom, we can get pretty close to how much time elapsed.\nBut is it accurate enough?\nNo.  This is why you need a device called an Audiometer that is a purpose built piece of hardware that measures the time between the two events - sound and keypress.  It's much more accurate because it removes the overhead of the CPU management and gives you a truly accurate elapsed time.\n\nA: First off - using echo -ne '\\007' to play audio is not \"low-latency\" audio. I.e. this command in itself could take a (relatively) long while to actually play the audio. Therefore using it to measure response times in units of milliseconds is not going to be precise at all.\nA way of measuring it would be to use an audio recorder of some sort with known low latency combined with another type of output from the computer with known low-latency. If you have the equipment, you could use for example an oscilloscope with a trigger input. In simpler terms, you could use an iPhone with slo-mo video recording. Then make the program trigger the output (could be a digital I/O or in simple terms showing something on the screen) - and then measure the amount of time before you see the audio in the signal (on the oscilloscope or in the audio track of the video recording).\nVarious other ways of measuring the latency exist, but the above mentioned is a simple way of getting a measurement that is precise enough to know if your audio delay is really 60 ms larger than your visual delay.\n", "Q: How are System Preferences categorized in Catalina?

It just means that the LCI didn't come in contact with the liquid. Another part of the phone might have been in contact with water. Also in case of \"moisture\" then slight dampness in the air doesn't necessarily activate an LCI.\nIn regards to 4 -  again no, you cannot infer that.

My theory is that macOS bootmanager doesn't find Windows on a subsequent reboot after I did step 6, it adjusts itself to ignore it. By having the original there, it wont do that - AND - at the end we can restore the copy, overwriting what GRUB did. I haven't tried this yet. I also haven't tried bootrec yet.\nI don't know how, yet, to solve the other problem whereby the option for booting into Ubuntu is not shown in the Apple boot manager.\nMachine: 2016 MacBookPro 15\" touchbar, 2.9GHz Quad-Core Intel i7, AMD 4g graphics, 16Gb RAM, 1Tb SSD.\nRunning: macOS Catalina 10.15.2\nWindows 10 Pro 64bit installed OK with BootCamp\nAttempting to install 3rd operating system, Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS 64bit, to be an option along side macOS and Windows in the standard Apple Boot Manager boot selection screen.

It sounds as if windows was installed in UEFI mode instead of the old MBR bootcamp fashion. Windows requires one or the other. Installing Ubuntu automatically converts the disk to \"mbr hybrid gpt\" and it has to be converted back to true GPT before windows will boot. This can be done with \"gdisk\" which David Anderson explains above. Make sure to change the disk name to match your disk when envoking gdisk (i.e. /dev/sda). To my knowledge gdisk is the only safe way to do this without loosing data.\nNOTE: Ubuntu 22.04 and possibly later versions have \"os prober\" disabled by default which prevents grub2 from booting windows properly. This can be fixed by adding a certain line to the grub configuration and saving the changes. (In Ubuntu not macos)\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nGets you to the file.\nUnder the other parameters add the line:\nGRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false\n\nsave the file with \"ctrl+x\" then \"y\" then \"return\"\nsudo update-grub\n\nALSO NOTE: If windows EFI is indeed corrupted it can be restored from a windows install disk or system repair sector using diskpart in the terminal. This will overwrite grub and possibly the macos efi files. Mac doesn't need efi to boot if you do so from holding \"option\" down. I believe macos firmware update rewrites the files anyway. Ubuntu on system can be booted from a supergrub2disk usb then it's  possible to reinstall grub. I have to work in this AM and shouldn't be up typing so I  won't go into more detail on this but there's plenty of info elsewhere.\nRefind is awesome. There's info on this forum to get it booting from a dedicated partition which has a few advantages.\nFor making the partition read the following thread and only do the command from step 1. of david anderson's answer.

Choose a number that's just 300-550M (MB) smaller than disk1:\nHow to stop macOS updates from taking over the rEFInd boot manager?\nFor getting refind installed look here to david anderson's answer:\nBless error when installing rEFInd\n\nA: Possible Reason Windows Will Not Boot\nThe Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS 64 bit installation software changes the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table on the installation drive to cause hybrid partitioning. This would prevent Windows from booting on 2016 model year Macs. In 2012, Apple started to phase out the need for hybrid partitioning. Evidently, the Ubuntu installer does not check for this. The answer you reference has been changed to add a step where gdisk is used to remove any hybrid partitioning imposed by the Ubuntu installer on the installation drive.\nYou can also remove the hybrid partitioning by booting to the live version of Ubuntu from the installer flash drive. The steps are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest Ubuntu installation ISO file from the Ubuntu Home Page. The file download and used in this answer was named ubuntu-18.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso.\n\n*Use Etcher to create a bootable Ubuntu flash drive installer, then boot from this flash drive. A tutorial can be found at the Ubuntu website Create a bootable USB stick on macOS.\n\n*When the menu below appears, select Try Ubuntu without installing.\n\n\n*When the Ubuntu desktop appears, press the control+option+T key combination to open a terminal window.\n\n*Make sure the drive is not using hybrid partitioning. This can be accomplished by entering the command given below.\nsudo gdisk /dev/nvme0n1p\n\nThis command is interactive. The interactive commands you will need to enter when prompted by gdisk are given below.\nx\nn\nw\ny\n\n\n*Finally, enter the command exit to close the terminal window.\nPossible Reason Ubuntu Will Not Boot\nBelow is a copy of an image you posted as part of your question with respect to steps 15 and 16.\n\nThe image shows the following message.\nWarning: Filesystem is FAT32 according to fat_length and fat32_length fields,\n  but has only 51068 clusters, less than the required minimum of 65525.\n  This may lead to problems on some systems.\n\nThis warning occurred because the drive on your Mac has a sector size of 4096 bytes. However, the answer referenced an example Mac with a sector size of only 512 bytes. In other words, the new EFI partition you created was too small. The instructions have been changed so the new EFI partition is at least as large as the original EFI partition. In your case, this should be about 315 MB.\nTo create a larger new EFI partition, you will have to reinstall Ubuntu.\n", "Q: iOS weather report on lock screen The other day I noticed a little weather report the minute I picked up my phone.

I've noticed the right AirPod produces noise almost like a white noise machine whenever I put it in Transparency Mode. It's distractingly lopsided. Looking on the internet, it looks like people are exchanging AirPods Pro that do that and successfully getting ones that don't do that. Assuming the gift was purchased within Apple's extended gift exchange period, would I be better off exchanging it or using AppleCare to get a replacement? I was trying to figure out if I'll end up with a refurbished one if I go through AppleCare.\n\nA: I would always go through Apple service regardless of what you think the timing is - if you think the product needs repairing, the service wing is the best place to get that service and not returns. \nApple service parts are often of higher quality than the new since some new parts can have manufacturing anomalies and the service parts are tested to a much higher standard - after all, Apple knows that thousands of people are going to get a device that needs exchange immediately (DOA) and they know the service part has to be better than the new in the box experience.\n(Also, Apple service is designed to get you service where Apple sales is designed to Make the sale / take your money. Why seek support from the sales floor when that phase of the transaction is concluded?) \nAs a class - I’ll take a refurb / repair / known good service part over a new in the box one any day if given the choice. I know refurbished has a bad rep from companies that do a crap job of quality.

You’re already bummed you need service and you don’t think Apple hasn’t stacked the deck so they can delight you better from service than new?\n\nA: You wouldn't receive a replacement unit from a refurbished batch.

I'm interested in knowing how to monitor and possibly sandbox an app and its relative background processes in MacOS.

Furthermore, it looks like everyone still thinks Mac OS cannot get malware and it is not helping.\nLet's say I want to install an Android Emulator to play android games on my MacBook. I know that the majority of the emulators are Chinese, therefore I will expect a significant amount of telemetry. \nI decide to go with the app Mumu. During the installation, the app asks me to input my password to allow the creation of a new Helper (anyway, what is it and what does that even entail?). In order to do this and continue with the installation, I have to allow the (initially blocked) execution of a \"system software\", in Security & Privacy >> General (pic).\nIf I ever decided to play along, how could I monitor the effects of this choice?

Training it to respect your preferences can be a bit tedious as it presents a dialog on absolutely everything on the Mac that wants to talk to something on the internet.\nBut with a little perseverance and some intimate knowledge of what certain processes are you can essentially block anything that wants to initiate anything in the way of an outbound network connection. It's not free but worth every penny.\nThere are likely other things out there that might do the trick. I think there is a Docker project for the Mac, but I have no expertise or knowledge of it other than it (may) exist. But Little Snitch is a worthy addition to every Mac user's Mac who enjoys fiddling around with more than email, a web browser and a few apps & games.\n\nA: Deny any app that needs a background helper and elevated access would be the safe way to sandbox and protect your data. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you grant full disk access and your admin password, all of your data is exploitable.\n\n*If the intent of that program is to harvest and exfiltrate the data, it can read everything. Not all apps will do that or even be programmed correctly if the intent is to harvest data, but you’ve opened the gate if you allow that entitlement.\n\n\n(Since you didn’t name a specific app, we can’t weigh in on how secure or like malware it might be - it could be very well designed and not designed to harm your privacy. )\nSounds like the install process is game over for you in this case. Apple ships malware detection and removal tools, and goes to great lengths with these alerts, a framework for code signing, and putting up these restrictions to get most people aware and to say no to apps asking for permissions they have no need to run. \nAs to everyone thinking there is no risk, that’s hyperbole at best.

I am trying to connect my Mac to a USB-cable and a WiFi at the same time. Will this make my network faster and more stable? Or will it just only pick one network to use?\n\n\nA: MacOS can have multiple network connections, via WiFi, Ethernet, Thunderbolt and indeed USB.\nNormally, one network takes preference over another: if the protocol can't be established on one network, it will look at another. In this way, it's possible to have Internet, file sharing, and other network devices like printers all on separate connections and networks.\nYour internet connection will come from only one network. You can't combine two separate network connections and use both simultaneously.\n\nA: \nI am trying to connect my Mac to a USB-cable and a WiFi at the same\n  time.\n\nThis is called link aggregation or simply bonding.  There is a very similar question in which I answer this question - Do LAN transfers use both Ethernet and WiFi by default?\nIn short, no, because you need a smart switch that's capable of handling that function and USB and WiFi are unable to be bonded.\n\n\nOr will it just only pick one network to use?\n\nIt will pick the network that will route your traffic based on destination (there's actually another component - \"cost\" - but it's for another topic because it's more for routing tables in switches, routers, and gateways).  \nThe \"destination\" is easy - it's the network you're trying to get to.  For example, you could have multiple network adapters connected to 3 different networks at once.  Let's use 3 for this example case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ethernet → 192.168.1.0 (Default)\n\n*WiFi → 10.0.0.0\n\n*USB → 172.16.0.0\n\n\nIf you wanted get to a printer with an IP address of 172.16.0.53, your computer would send that traffic through your USB connection.  If you wanted to get to a file server (maybe you're at work) with an IP address of 10.0.0.103, it would route the traffic through WiFi.  Then, if you wanted \"remote control\" your friends Mac that had an IP of 192.168.1.203, your traffic would go through the Ethernet adapter.  \nNow, if you notice, the Ethernet was designated as the \"default\" (any adapter can be the default, I just picked this one).  This means that any traffic going to a network that your computer doesn't know about will go through this interface.  So, the Internet being a massive collection of what seems countless public networks, anything going there (like to http://apple.com with IP address of 17.142.160.59), that traffic will be routed through that interface.\nThe \"priority\" only comes into play when you have two (or more) adapters connected to the same network(s) like your Ethernet and WiFi both connecting to the 192.168.0.0 network.  Normally, the priority will be the one with the lowest latency (quickest to respond, not necessarily the fastest data rate) unless you specify which one should take priority.\n", "Q: Getting warning each time i open browser using Epichrome I am using Epichrome to have multiple Chrome browsers at the same time. I have three browsers that I made with Epichrome, but each time I open one of them, it gives this warning:\n\nI am using MacOS Catalina (10.15.2) on my MacBook Pro, and the browser I made using Epichrome is called 'Duolingo'.\nDoes anyone know a fix for this, if not why it is there? \n\nA: I've occasionally seen this myself, but I've never had it happen every time I launch an Epichrome app. The first thing I'd try is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit all your Epichrome apps.\n\n*Run the main Google Chrome and go to the About Google Chrome page. If it shows an update pending, tell it to update and relaunch.\n\n*Once you have confirmed Chrome is up to date, try relaunching your Epichrome apps.

Can you please help how to get the space back?\n\nA: First, nothing is really missing. An APFS container composed in this manner looks like this in Terminal and Disk Utility.\nA standard boot volume APFS container in Catalina accommodates five volumes:\n\n\n*\n\n*a preboot volume (your disk1s2)\n\n*a recovery volume (your disk1s3)\n\n*a VM volume (your disk1s4)\n\n*a read-only mounted system volume (your disk1s7)\n\n*a read-write mounted data volume (probably your disk1s1)\n\n\nThe last two are combined in one APFS volume group.\n\nYour container disk0s2 houses two additional data volumes  (disk1s5 and disk1s6) though. Both adhere to the standard naming scheme of the default read-write mounted data volume of an APFS boot container: [name_of_main_volume] & [ - Data]. The larger of the two additional data volumes (disk1s6) is not mounted and therefore \"missing\".\nConsidering the size of the various data volumes disk1s6 is probably your former data volume. I assume that it was replaced by the very small disk1s1 data volume in the APFS volume group accidentally.\n\nTo solve your problem additional info (as stated in my comments) is required.\n", "Q: Can't uninstall some MacPort packages: \"Error: port deactivate failed: this entry does not own the given file\" I'm trying to reinstall MacPorts a long time after a system upgrade.

It's always better if one can find a way to do something without resorting to UI Scripting first. \nAs I originally said to you in a comment... Basic vanilla AppleScript does not have a provision to preform a key down and mouse click simultaneously. You could try using a third-party utility like cliclick wrapped in a do shell script command. You'd have to programmatically determine the position of UI element 2 to then click on it with cliclick.\nWithout Pro Tools, I'm going to use Safari as an example, and the Show sidebar UI element on its Toolbar in conjunction with cliclick in a do shell script command.\nThe purpose of following example AppleScript code is to demonstrate how to programmatically get the position and size of the target UI element, in order to calculate where to click. It also assumes that Safari is already running with a standard window opened to, e.g., this question you posted.\nactivate application \"Safari\"\ndelay 1\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    set ps to {position, size} ¬\n        of UI element 2 ¬\n        of toolbar 1 ¬\n        of window 1 ¬\n        of application process \"Safari\"\n\nset p to item 1 of ps\nset s to item 2 of ps\n\nset x to (item 1 of p) + (item 1 of s) / 2 as integer\nset y to (item 2 of p) + (item 2 of s) / 2 as integer\n\ndo shell script \"$HOME/bin/cliclick c:\" & x & \",\" & y\n\n      • Change $HOME/bin/cliclick as appropriate to: /path/to/cliclick\nWhen run in Script Editor, this clicked the Show sidebar UI element on the Toolbar in Safari.\nNow I know you said you want to click with the option key down, however for a practical example I'm going to modify the example AppleScript code, shown above, to control-click to the right of the Show sidebar UI element on the Toolbar in Safari, which will pop-up the Customize Toolbar… menu.\nChange:\nset x to (item 1 of p) + (item 1 of s) / 2 as integer\n\nTo:\nset x to (item 1 of p) + (item 1 of s) * 2 as integer\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of dividing the x axis size by two to get the center of the target UI element on its x axis , we'll multiply its x axis size by two so it will click on the Toolbar itself.\nAlso Change:\ndo shell script \"$HOME/bin/cliclick c:\" & x & \",\" & y\n\nTo:\ndo shell script \"$HOME/bin/cliclick kd:ctrl c:\" & x & \",\" & y & \" ku:ctrl\" \n\nNow when run in Script Editor, this control-clicked to the right of the Show sidebar UI element on the Toolbar in Safari and popped-up the Customize Toolbar… menu.\n\nWith all of this in mind, maybe the following example AppleScript code will work for you, however remember it's untested as I do not have Pro Tools and may require you to rework the tell application \"System Events\" ... statement:\nactivate application \"Pro Tools\"\ndelay 1\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    set ps to {position, size} ¬\n        of UI element 2 ¬\n        of row 2 ¬\n        of table \"Group List\" ¬\n        of (first window whose title contains \"Edit: \") ¬\n        of application process \"Pro Tools\"\n\nset p to item 1 of ps\nset s to item 2 of ps\n\nset x to (item 1 of p) + (item 1 of s) / 2 as integer\nset y to (item 2 of p) + (item 2 of s) / 2 as integer\n\ndo shell script \"$HOME/bin/cliclick -r kd:alt c:\" & x & \",\" & y & \" ku:alt\"\n\n      • Change $HOME/bin/cliclick as appropriate to: /path/to/cliclick\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors.\nNote: The example AppleScript code for use with Safari and cliclick was tested and worked as presented in macOS Catalina.  \nNote: I am not affiliated with the developer of cliclick, just a satisfied user of the product.\n", "Q: \"There is no connected camera\" - Macbook Pro 13\" 2017 Does anybody have any alternative solutions?

You can confirm this by looking at your System Report (from About This Mac) under both headings Camera and USB.  If you don't see anything there, the camera has failed.\nYou've already done excellent diagnostics by attempting to boot into Safe Mode and using a secondary account.  The fact that it's not found in Safe Mode means it's unfortunately non-functional.\nYou could have it repaired, but likely it will require a disassembly of or replacement of the display.  You might be better off using a \"external\" USB webcam as it will be far less expensive than fixing the built in one.\n", "Q: Erase MacBook hard drive without the use of the mouse I want to sell my Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina.\nIt has an unknown issue where the mouse input isn't working properly and I can't click (when using either the trackpad or a USB mouse).\nI have got to the Disk Utility page but I can't click the 'Erase' button to finish the job and there seems to be no way to do this with the keyboard.\nIs there a way I can erase the hard drive without using the mouse? I can access the Terminal when I login.\n\nA: You can use a Keyboard combination to erase your Macbook with VoiceOver's accessibility feature. \n\n\n*\n\n*First, reboot your computer and be in Recovery mode with the combination of ⌘+R. \n\n*At the recovery welcome screen, press ⌘+F5 keys (or ⌘+fn+F5, if you're on an Apple laptop) to enable VoiceOver's accessibility features.\n\n*On the macOS Utilities selection screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Disk Utility, press the Tab button to highlight the Continue button and press ⌃+⌥+Space as instructed by the voice-over display screen.\n\n*Use ⇥ (tab) if needed to be on your Macintosh HD-Data. Once you follow the voice control option, you can be on Erase option, and press ⌃+⌥+Space\n\n*Voila !! it is done without any mouse too. \n\nA: This can be done from macOS Recovery without the use of a mouse and primarily using just the arrow, tab and space keys. The enter key may need to be used on some objects, depending on the selection(s) made:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to macOS Recovery by holding down ⌘R when starting the Mac.\n\n*At the macOS Utilities window, press the down-arrow key four times. This highlights Disk Utility because the table containing it already has focus when booted to macOS Recovery.\n\n*Press the tab key once to highlight the Continue button.\n\n*Press the space key to actuate the highlighted Continue button, which starts Disk Utility.\n\n\nIn Disk Utility:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the up-arrow key to highlight the e.g. Macintosh HD, or whichever volume you want to erase.\n\n*Use the tab key multiple times until the Erase button on the Toolbar is highlighted.\n\n*Press the space key to actuate the highlighted Erase button.\n\n*On the ensuing sheet, e.g. Erase Macintosh HD, use the previously mentioned keystroke methods to navigate, select and actuate the buttons as wanted. You can also actuate the Format: pop-up menu, once selected with the tab key, with the up-arrow or down-arrow keys and press the enter key after making the selection.\n\n\nNote: These steps were tested from macOS Recovery on a system running macOS Catalina and works as described without the use of VoiceOver. \n\nA: In addition to the other answers provided, if at any point you want to access the menus in the menu bar using only the keyboard, you can use control (⌃) + F2 to move your focus to the menu bar, then use your arrow keys to navigate the menus.\nFor example, this would allow you to access the Edit > Erase... option within the Disk Utility menus.\nAdditionally, this would allow you to access the Terminal by selecting Utilities > Terminal in the macOS Recovery menus.\nFrom Terminal, you could run diskutil commands to erase the internal disk.\ndiskutil list will list all the disks the system is aware of. If your goal is to erase the internal disk, there is a good chance that will be listed as /dev/disk0 (internal).\nHere is a sample from my MacBook Pro that shipped with a 512GB drive.\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:             Apple_APFS_ISC ⁨⁩                        524.3 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk3⁩         494.4 GB   disk0s2\n   3:        Apple_APFS_Recovery ⁨⁩                        5.4 GB     disk0s3\n\nYou can then run the diskutil eraseDisk command to erase the internal disk using the HFS+ format, and labeling it as the default \"Macintosh HD\".\ndiskutil eraseDisk HFS+J \"Macintosh HD\" /dev/disk0\n\nThe disk will then be fully erased and ready for a clean installation of macOS.\n\nA: If you can open the Terminal, the command rm -r * will erase the whole disk, we usually avoid telling anyone that because they may accidentally use it - most people here aren't looking to erase their disk drive.  You can type man rm to read the man page for the rm command.\n", "Q: Using public key with OSXFUSE I have been allotted a system-generated password (which is impossible to remember) that I cannot change and every time I mount a folder from the remote machine, I have to enter the password for that account. \nI have set-up a public key based log-in which works fine when I use ssh.

Click Choose library...\n\n*Locate the old .itl file (e.g. Music/iTunes/iTunes Library.itl) and select it\n\n*Input a name for a new library and click Save\n\n*Music.app starts with original library contents within a few seconds. Only a few megabyte large library is created on the disk. Media files and iTunes files are left intact.\n\n*Optional: go to Music.app preferences - Files tab and check the settings, so you know which location is currently used for media files.\n\n\nNote: This didn't work in beta versions of macOS Catalina – first versions of Music.app didn't support multiple libraries or selecting a library.\nGood to know to avoid confusion while working with multiple libraries: double-clicking on .itl file, or .musiclibrary library (folder) from Finder opens Music.app with the last used library. It does NOT switch the library.\n", "Q: Run a command without opening the terminal Is it possible to start a terminal command without opening the terminal first? \nI have some quick commands, and for those I open the terminal window, run the command, and close it again. I generally don’t like my terminal program to be active all the time, because it clutters my dock. \nThen I vaguely remembered, that there is the Alt-F2 thing on some Linux-distributions, where you can start a single command without opening a shell window first. I think I never used this function regularly, but this seems to be the thing I’m looking for. \nIs there something like this on mac os?\n\nA: My solution: I created shell scripts for my commands instead of aliases, and included the folder in the PATH variable. Thereby I could call them from any bash shell on the system. Then I used the recommended tool BitBar to call my commands from the menu bar. I guess it would be possible to create a BitBar-Plugin that lets you enter a command, but for now I didn’t take the time to write such a thing. Thanks to everyone who commented!\nUpdate 2023: I used the solution above for years now. But now I'm actually planning to migrate all my scripts to ScriptKit, which seems to be the perfect solution for my problems. Due to it's framework it seems to be easy to use, and offers easy ways to interact with scripts. So this is a hint for people searching for this in 2023.\n", "Q: Can I run MacBook Pro Retina 13 inch early 2015 without a battery? I have a swollen battery, and want to remove it while waiting for the replacement. \nCan I remove it and safely turn on the Mac only with the power chord?\n\nA: Most Apple laptops will work safely, but slightly less reliably, with the battery removed. They will behave like a desktop computer that possibly has an inadequate power supply for full load conditions: remove the power, and everything goes poof, which is not ideal, given the ease with which a MagSafe or USB-C connector can disconnect. Repeated 'shocks' of this kind to the circuitry may cause damage to the filesystem.  So remember to Shutdown before removing the cable and keep good backups. \nSome people say that the Mac may run at a lower clock speed, to reduce power load, though this may depend on model.\nHowever, removal of the battery in this model is not easy. If you're planning on replacing it yourself, then crack on. Otherwise, you might just want to leave it alone until the repair is carried out.\n", "Q: How to get access to an iPod Touch 3rd gen wich currently is in recovery mode? I have an old iPod stuck in recovery mode. I know it's old, but I can't afford anything new. Is there any way to get it out of recovery mode without losing my music? \nPS: I don't have the original computer I used to use. Some of the music is in the cloud, but half of them are not.\n\nA: There are many tools that might help. However, the following tool was recommended by my colleague, so I thought to share it. I haven't tested or owned any rights for this tool. \nYou need one third party tool and a reference computer to resolve this issue. \n1) Link to Download Recboot > RecBoot for Mac and RecBoot for Windows\n2) Run Recboot, then connect your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch to your computer.\n3) Once your iOS device is recognized, you’ll find two buttons on the Recboot window.\n\n4) The Button on the left is to “Enter Recovery Mode” and the right one is to “Exit Recovery Mode”.\n5) After you make sure your device is connected properly, click the desired button to enter a command to your iPhone from your computer.\nNote: I don't own or advertising this tool. You can use it at your own risk. \n", "Q: Name a phone number without adding to Contacts? On my iPhone I have a well-curated Contacts list of all of my friends and family.\nI also often want to name the phone numbers of more temporary \"contacts\": one-time business deals, recruiters, friends-of-friends for a single weekend, etc.\nI don't really want to add these people to my Contacts forever, but I do want to read their name on Caller ID when/if they call.\nDoes iOS have any concept of \"second-tier\" contacts that are saved but not listed as \"Contacts\" in my address book?\nHow can I save and name phone numbers but keep them separate from my true Contacts?\n\nA: You can use \"groups\" in contacts. I don't know how to create them on the iPhone, but macOS' contacts app allows this. You should check if iCloud allows this. \nhttps://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/03/01/how-to-create-contact-groups-iphone/\nThis blog also features an app \"Contact Groups\". \n I am not associated with either the linked website or the said app.\n", "Q: Lowering keyboard latency I'm on Catalina 10.15.2 on a MacBook Pro 16-inch from '19. I don't have slow keys activated. Is there any way to measure and most importantly lower the latency of keystrokes in the laptop keyboard itself?\nI suspect the default latency is in the order of ms, but still somewhat noticeable if you type fast.\n\nA: The easy way to measure latency is with video and even iPhone 11 can capture 240 frames per second, so you’ll be within 5ms of measurement error. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://danluu.com/input-lag/\nIf you have noticeable lag, it’s going to be likely you can use activity monitor to see what is slowing the processor or perhaps detect you have an issue on the USB bus resetting if there’s no obvious reason why keys are buffering and not going directly to the screen. \n", "Q: Mounted volume not accessible I'm trying to mount an external volume:\n/bin/mkdir -p /Volumes/share\n/sbin/mount -o nosuid,-d=777 -t smbfs //user:pwd@host.local/share /Volumes/share\n\nThe script runs as a Daemon, no error. The share is visible from Console (whith root privileges) and the mounted share has all privileges enabled:\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root  wheel  16384  2 jan 21:19 share\n\nHowever I cannot even list the content ls of the mounted share unless I use root privileges. It's this normal?\nThis problem appeared only after upgrading from High Sierra to Catalina and I wonder if the later is more restrictive and how to make it work.\nEdit 1: this is the result of mount | grep share:\n//user@host.local/share on /Volumes/share (smbfs, nosuid)\n\n\nA: Finally, after many turns, I've found what's going on: \nThe executing shell/app in the script (e.g. zsh, sh, python - in my case /bin/bash) needs to have Full Disk Access privileges. In order to do so I went to Apple Menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy, selected Privacy tab, unlocked the settings and added /bin/bash to the list.\nNow I can read and write the mounted share.\n", "Q: Macbook unexpectedly shuts down programs when I close the lid OSX 10.14.6, late 2013 13\" macbook pro.\nI keep a lot of tabs open on my laptop, and lately I've started noticing that I can't find tabs that I thought were open. Turns out that when I close the macbook's lid, it will sometimes close whatever tab or window is active at the time (equivalent to cmd+w, I think). If, for example, it's an unsaved Word document, when I open the laptop again I'll see the \"do you want to save your work\" dialogue; if I had Chrome or Safari open in the foreground, it'll just close whatever tab was open. \nThis doesn't seem to always happen, making it frustratingly difficult to debug. \nAny idea what could cause this behavior? \n\nA: Interesting. One setting I would check to see if it's enabled is if it's set to log you out after a certain amount of time. You can do this by going to the system preferences, then security & privacy, then click the advanced button on the lower right corner and the option will be shown.\n", "Q: messages stopped working on my iMac computer I have an old iMac running High Sierra. I use the Messages app often throughout the day. Today I received my new iPhone 11 Pro. My phone is set up and seems to be working fine. But on my iMac, my messages quit working if sending to a non-iPhone account.  I don't know if the 2 are related, it could just be a coincidence that messages stopped working when setting up my new iPhone. I have stopped and restarted Messages and I've restarted my computer. Both to no avail. \nDoes anyone know how to troubleshoot/fix Message delivery on macOS?\n\nA: The registration can fail and need to be re-established. Before you contact Apple support, I would open messages on the Mac and sign out of your AppleID. \n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of messages with your AppleID\n\n*Check the date / time in the Mac in system preferences. Within 60 seconds of reality should be fine, closer is better of course, but it’s not sub second critical. \n\n*Sign back in to Messages (quit the app and retry after signing out if it’s stubborn). https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204408\nThe system should log an error to the diagnostics or the screen if your sign in fails. \n\nA: Go to Settings->Messages->Text Message Forwarding on your phone and make sure your iMac is listed.\n", "Q: Add images to existing PDF with Preview Preview allows to add text and shapes to PDFs. But is it possible to add existing images (PNG / JPEG) to a PDF file as well?\nI do know that Preview already has some of image embedding by allowing the user to add signatures drawn on the screen of an i-Device. But I couldn't figure out if this would also work with arbitrary files.\n\nA: Do as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Open the image you want to paste in Preview.app\n\n*Select All (Command-A)\n\n*Copy (Command-C)\n\n*Paste (Command-V)\n\nNow you have a copy of your image pasted above your old image. This is apparently meaningless, but the new copy is not just an image, but an object.\n\n*\n\n*Click on the new image (round blue corners appear, no marching ants)\n\n*Copy (Command-C)\n\n*Paste on your PDF document. The image is an object, moveable and resizable. The original PDF is still a PDF, editable and all.\n\n\nA: Automator includes an action to \"Watermark PDF Documents\", which adds an image file to every page of a PDF.\nSo, you'll need to separate out the target page in Preview (drag the thumbnail of that page to a Finder window), then apply the watermark to that page, then drag the single-page PDF back into the full document.\nArguably, the easiest and best methods may not involve Preview.\n\nA: This is not a solution but still a work around. \n\n\n*\n\n*Convert the PDF document to an image with File » Export .. Choose PNG as the format and change the resolution as desired.\n\n*Open the image file and select the whole image with Edit » Select All (or select just a part of it with the mouse if you wish).\n\n*Copy the selection Edit » Copy.\n\n*Go back to the document (which is now a PNG image) and paste the selection with Edit » Paste and resize it as you wish.\n\n*Save the file as a PDF with File » Export as PDF (and rename it if the original PDF needs to be preserved).\n\n\nNote a PDF made from an image is not searchable, so that is a drawback to this procedure.\n\nA: I spend a lot of time reading the \"solutions\" and no one was able to do what I want: Paste an image or photo in the middle of the content PDF pdf. Not just add a new page in the pdf with an image. And also don't use another app or software.\nSo here is the solution:\n\n*\n\n*Open your PDF where you want to add the image with Preview.\n\n*Export it as a JPG with the highest resolution (That's what I did, not sure if it works with lower resolution)\n\n*Open the image you want to add with Preview\n\n*Open the exported file from PDF which at this moment is in JPG(is that clear?)\n\n*Select the image cmd+a and copy the image cmd+c\n\nAt this moment you have 3 files open the original PDF(1), the exported JPG(2) and the image file (3) all of them with Preview.\n\n\n*Paste the image cmd+v in the exported file JPG\n\nNote: The image is pasted and has a square surrounding the image with dots y the borders to re-size the image.\n\n\n*From the exported file JPG select (click over the image) and copy the image cmd+c\n\nHere is where the magic happens:\n\n\n*Go to the original PDF and paste cmd+v\n\nNow you can erase the exported file.\n\nA: You can export images as PDF and import them as \"page from file\" into the target file. I'm afraid that in-page embedding might not be easy. \n\nA: If you don't mind the inserted image being in its own page, you can do Edit -> Insert -> Page from File... and select your image.\n", "Q: I know the sudo password, can I use sudo and install software without logging out and switching to the admin user?

Is there any way I can just do this by entering the password to the admin acccount?\n\nA: Yes, you can do it. You don't need to logout as both the GUI and the shell allow you to choose a different user to run in a non-admin account.\n\n\n*\n\n*When it pops up for a password in GUI, enter the short echo $USER or long (what it shows in top right corner) admin account and then the admin password. \n\n*In terminal type, su username where username is your admin account name: echo $USER in admin account.

How do I default the shell to always use this .bash_profile file? Thanks!\n\nA: zsh uses different config files, see the 'STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES' section in man zsh. You can run one of\nmv ~/.bash_profile ~/.zprofile\nmv ~/.bash_profile ~/.zshrc\n\nto rename the file, see the man page or https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208050 for the difference between these:\n\nIf you're using a bash profile, such as to set environment variables, aliases, or path variables, you should switch to using a zsh equivalent. For example:\n\n*\n\n*.zprofile is equivalent to .bash_profile and runs at login, including over SSH\n\n*.zshrc is equivalent to .bashrc and runs for each new Terminal session\n\n\n\nA: You can also just add source .bash_profile at the bottom of your ~/.zshrc file\n", "Q: How do I change the image display duration in the Catalina screensavers?

I'm quite experienced in python, java, apple script etc. and know of no solutions to this problem. I've also seen various tutorials that work for Windows but not Mac. Additionally, many tutorials on the subject fake video wallpapers by merely playing a video in the background or requiring an app to be open all the time (e.g. VLC)—and I'd definitely like to avoid apps that must appear in the task bar or occlude my desktop icons. Ideas?\n\nA: You can play any video as a Desktop wallpaper using VLC from the command line if you pass the option --video-wallpaper to the VLC executable. This will play the video behind your Desktop files. The VLC executable is located at /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC. I have that aliased to vlc, using:\nalias vlc='/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC'\nYou can now play any video using:\nvlc --video-wallpaper movie.mp4\nThis will cause the VLC application to be in your Dock.

Is there a way to workaround it? Recently I started browsing USGS Togo Maps which can be downloaded as PDF.

I was going through this macOS Security and Privacy Guide repo, step by step, and found some good privacy tips. However, when I arrived at the Certificate Authorities section I got a little confused. I don't understand certificates that much and it was a little shocking to find Amazon and GoDaddy certs in my Keychain System Roots.\nThe guide recommends that I \"disable certificate authorities through Keychain Access by marking them as Never Trust and closing the window.\" So far I followed the advice and changed the Govt. Root Cert. Authority to \"Never Trust.\" I'm still not sure if I should do the same on the rest.\nI realize asking for an explanation of what certificates are is a huge question, so I want to simplify it: Why are these corporate certificates pre-installed in macOS and is it safe to delete/\"Never Trust\" most/all of them?\n\nA: Basically certificates are used so that you can say \"I got this information from an otherwise untrusted source, but because it has this associated certificate, I'm going to put some trust in it\". This is possible because \"someone\" has done some sort of vetting of these sources.\nIn practice, a lot of times this means for example a company wanting to open a web shop goes to a certificate vendor (such as GoDaddy you mentioned) and buys a certificate. The certificate vendor will then do some kind of checking before they issue the certificate.\nDepending on the type of certificate it might be that they check that the company controls the domain of their web site (such as my-web-shop.com), that they control e-mail addresses (such as postmaster@my-web-shop.com) - or even checking company registration papers, ensuring that the postal address is correct, etc.\nThis makes it possible for ordinary users to visit a web site and be somewhat sure that the data they received comes from the intended source.\nYou might notice that something is missing here - how are the vetters vetted?\nThis is done by operating system and browser vendors such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Mozilla, etc. They basically keep a list of certificate vendors that their software will trust by default.\nApple will for example make changes to that list when you update macOS to ensure that it keeps being valid. In addition, you yourself can make your own decisions on adding or removing vendors from the list by changing the trust levels.\nWhether it is \"safe\" or not to remove the trust is a matter of your preference. If you remove the trust of a specific vendor, you will be prompted when accessing web sites that bought certificates from that vendor - stating that the site is not secure. You can usually override that on a site per site basis, but not always.\nNote: When I say \"bought from a vendor\" it doesn't necessarily mean that money was exchanged. Some certificate issuers do not charge (such as Let's Encrypt) and some service providers provide certificates for free with other services.\n", "Q: How can I get spotlight to search everywhere for any file? I know for a fact that a file named 1A0CFDAF-E43B-49E1-AC88-CD8CC9146947.jpeg exists in my photo library originals/ subdirectory.  But searching for 1A0CFDAF-E43B-49E1-AC88-CD8CC9146947.jpeg using Spotlight returns no results.  \nThis is the kind of thing I look for, because if it were obvious I'd already know where it is.  I want to have confidence spotlight is searching everything, so that when I get \"no result\" I know that means \"the file does not exist on your hard drive.\"  \nIs there a way to expand Spotlight's search domain so that it literally indexes my whole drive and finds any and every file, like it really kind of should?  \n\nA: Spotlight doesn't search hidden & system areas at all, by design.\nThe simplest way to get around this is to use something like EasyFind (freeware) instead. You might need to allow it access to Photos Library, in Privacy and Security preferences. \nIt doesn't index, so it's slower than Spotlight, but it will find anything, anywhere.\n\nA: There are two things that may cause this issue. \n\n\n*\n\n*Some locations / folders are excluded as mentioned by Tetsujin's answer. In addition to that answer, check your System Preferences > Spotlight and see if the file in question is not excluded in the tabs Search Results and Privacy. \n\n*In my experience the Spotlight index goes bad relatively often for some reason.

I found this command: sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0 while googling for this matter, but it is for 2017, not sure if it is still useful and a good idea on macOS Mojave?\nEdit:\nI am using a 2019 Macbook Air, my read speed is 650MB/s using this command:\ntime dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k of=tstfile count=1024\nThat's still 38GB per minute.\nI also tried reformatting the drive to:\nCoreStorage Logical Volume • Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) (not case-sensitive)\nEdit2:\nAfter running: sudo sysctl debug.lowpri\\_throttle_enabled=0 it became much worse... even though I returned it to default enabled=1 , still 6 hours remaining.\n\n\nA: Time Machine backups are limited by three factors, the type of scan selected, the speed of the primary storage, the speed of the destination storage.\nIf your empirical evidence is increasing destination, then that’s not your bottleneck. (Sorry to restate the obvious)\nI would look over the unified log file to see what’s actually happening and also not mess with any defaults (reset them if you changed anything) and use this tool to get some specific data:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2019/12/27/t2m2-further-improves-strategy-data-for-backups-in-catalina/\nIt is a nice graphical wrapper and the author explains very well in their writing how it works, what some gotchas are and even how to read the system logs if you find you need different data than the Time Machine Mechanic utility exposes.\nIn the end, it’s probably more likely you need to exclude whatever data is taking a long time to scan or just live with the backup speeds, but I’d love a follow up question with some specifics if we want to get into if it’s bandwidth or iops that’s constraining your backups.\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine Backups taking too much space?\nAlso, case sensitive is an odd choice and not usual - do you have room to make a second partition and test the defaults journaled / encrypted HFS destination?

Overall, everything looks to be functioning perfectly, well allocating memory to all the programs you have, zero memory pressure, the compression routine is starting to kick in - you have a very balanced amount of wired to application-specific memory.\nI wouldn’t worry a bit and this looks exactly like a normal system running in balance with excess RAM available for you to add significant more programs or data processing.\nAll UNIX type operating systems are designed to keep in RAM all the data it can and minimize the amount of free memory since it can release the allocations instantly when a new use is higher priority than the old cached data that can is there just in case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Isn't Inactive memory a waste of resources?\n\n*https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/12/03/how-much-memory-is-my-process-using-/\nBasically, the memory system has many layers of physical and logical abstractions that let it commit what looks to be a poor allocation on first glance that in practice is efficient, speedy and very well tested in practice.\nWhen you would start to worry about not enough memory, the system will draw the pressure chart in yellow and red. Even running there can be just fine, it only means you can’t add more memory hungry processes, and not that you’re actually being slowed due to pressure.\n\n\n*\n\n*What scale or measure does Mavericks' and Yosemite's \"memory pressure\" adhere to?\nFrom the above link, you can convince yourself how much extra memory you have ready to go by artificially running a command to over-allocate memory until you reach the warning level (or the critical level). Here are screen shots of my MacBook that runs every bit as fast when over-allocated to critical - everything is as snappy in Safari / Photos / whatever as it is with zero memory pressure.\n\nThe above image is everything going back to green after running the critical command and pressing control+C (or closing the terminal window running the memory_pressure diagnostic.\nsudo memory_pressure -l warn\nsudo memory_pressure -l critical\n\nHere are the images after warning and critical - you can see how much allocation was needed to push the system to these thresholds:\n\n\nSo, on my Mac that only has 8 GB of RAM, I needed to allocate another 4.65 GB of memory to reach the \"warning\" state and another 6.46 GB of memory to reach the \"critical\" state where there's no longer an abundance of free memory for the next use. Even then, the system was not slowed any perceptible amount. Pretty amazing for an m3 chip running 1.1 GHz or so that was build 5 years ago.\n\n\nA: My mac is using also quite a lot of memory. I am running just few programs, far from my heavy tasks and I have 32GB and my system is using 22GB. But memory pressure graph is low green line so it looks like that it manage memory differently than e.g. windows. On windows I have a problem to reach over 16GB so I think windows is cleaning ram when possible, MacOS most probably keeps stuff in memory until it is really needed somewhere else.\n", "Q: Two Apple IDs - one for business and one for personal Is it possible to have two apple IDs on one device?

That way the control of the app is with the company, not with the contracted developer.

In practice, the coat tails for running older hardware on newer OS are generous and long and break on CPU architecture boundaries generally as opposed to yearly release cycles.\nSupport means Apple issues security patches, fields support calls, generally makes it run on all hardware or will disable features like graphics to let older hardware run newer OS with some features disabled, but the majority of the system running.\nWarranty and Guarantee and Software Licenses are legal terms, so I'll dodge them since they depend on  which locale you buy the goods and possibly which locale you import / use / seek support after purchase.\nIn the past the Apple Support pages would clearly list each supported OS, but with the newer redesign I can't locate that page but you can read the tea leaves by searching for archived support for older OS and hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/macos\n", "Q: What is \"routined\" and why is it eating my CPU? After my fans started blazing, I checked top and found that a process named routined was using 60-70% cpu. Surprisingly, I found no information about this process via Google, other than a mention of it in relation to a keychain issue which doesn't apply to me. \nAnybody know what this process is doing?\nThe process was owned by my user, but after killing it, it came back running as root. After a minute or so, the cpu usage droped to 0.\nmacOS Catalina 10.15.2 on a MacBook Pro\n\nA: I wondered the same thing! It does have a small but somewhat helpful man page, which you can get via man routined in Terminal.\nNAME\n     routined -- A daemon that learns the historical location patterns of a user.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     routined is a per-user daemon that learns historical location patterns of a user and predicts\n     future visits to locations.\n\n     There are no configurations to routined, and users should not run routined manually.\n\nAs to what it's doing? One way to find this out for (nearly) any process is to take a sample using Activity Monitor:\n\nThat will then produce a fairly verbose report that you can send to Apple using Feedback Assistant: https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/\nIn my sample, it appears to be training a machine learning model:\n +               1440 __44-[RTLearnedLocationEngine trainWithHandler:]_block_invoke  (in libcoreroutine.dylib) + 475  [0x7fff6ff29e85]\n    +                 1440 -[RTLearnedLocationEngine _trainWithHandler:]  (in libcoreroutine.dylib) + 1041  [0x7fff6ff29612]\n    +                   1440 -[RTLearnedLocationEngine _trainWithFromDate:ToDate:forLastLearnedVisit:handler:]  (in libcoreroutine.dylib) + 765  [0x7fff6ff2996a]\n    +                     1440 -[RTLearnedLocationEngine _trainLocationsOfInterestModelWithError:]  (in libcoreroutine.dylib) + 121  [0x7fff6ff2a1f7]\n    +                       1440 -[RTLearnedLocationEngine _relabelWithError:]  (in libcoreroutine.dylib) + 303  [0x7fff6ff2e58e]\n    +                         1440 -[RTLearnedLocationEngine _relabelWithRelabeler:relabelerPersister:error:]  (in libcoreroutine.dylib) + 1619  [0x7fff6ff2ec22]\n    +                           1440 -[RTLearnedLocationStore enumerateStoredLocationsOfInterestWithOptions:enumerationBlock:]  (in libcoreroutine.dylib) \n\nI would expect such activity to eventually complete and stop chewing CPU, but you never know!\n\nA: So just to close this off, it seems like routined has something to do with location tracking. But I don't know why it suddenly started using a lot of CPU.\n\nA: Instead of disabling routined, try this:\nIn your home directory, go look inside ~/Library/Preferences.  Is there a com.apple.routined.plist file there?  Delete this plist file & restart your Mac.\nOne more thing:\nIf you are using a firewall like Little Snitch, be sure routined has outgoing network access.\n\nA: I had the same issue and installing the combo update https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2030 has solved it for me.\nUpdate:\nI have been too optimistic about the combo update because after a few days I noticed it didn't actually solved it for me and ended up completely disabling the service. Do the following:\nsudo mount -rw /\nsudo mv /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.routined.plist /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.routined.plist.disabled\n\nThen reboot the system.\n", "Q: Pages - new paragraph in the same list item? I create a numbered list:\n1. Point 1\n2. Point 2\n\nand so on. Now I realised that the content of 2 requires two paragraphs\n1. Point 1\n2. Point 2, paragraph 1\n   Point 2, paragraph 2\n\nbut pressing enter in a list just creates a new list entry.\nShift-Enter gives a new line but not the extra space you want to separate the paragraphs (c.f., this paragraph and the previous paragraph):\n1. Point 1\n2. Point 2, paragraph 1\n\n   Point 2, paragraph 2\n\n(There is too much space in this example but you hopefully get the point.)\nHow can this be achieved?\n\nA: I solved it myself. Just duplicate the current list style and make the new style without a bullet in the appropriate section of the Format sidebar. Pages is smart enough to continue the numbering on the next paragraph where it left of in the previous paragraph.\n\nA: You can press space-enter twice to create the visual line break between paragraphs, and then change the font size, ⌘- for the line separating the paragraphs to decrease the amount of space between the two paragraphs.\nYou can also press ⇧⌘I to Show Invisibles, or click Pages > View > Show Invisibles, which may makes it easier to select the line to decrease its font size\n", "Q: iMac 21.5 Core i3 mid 2010 optical bay swap SSD I've read a few suggestions that you get worse performance placing the SSD in a caddy in place of the optial drive rather than swapping with the main mechanical.\nIs this true?\nCan I have my boot drive in the old optical bay, and will I still get SATA II speeds for a supported/ or rather a modern SSD?\n\nA: You shouldn't get slower speeds because both SATA ports are SATA II (3Gb/s).\nYou can confirm this by going to About This Mac >> System Report.  Then, go down to SATA/SATA Express and select the chipset controlling your optical drive.\n(I don't have an optical drive for this example, unfortunately, so mine shows my SSD, but the concept is the same)\nLook for Link Speed and Negotiated Link Speed.  Link Speed is what the interface is capable of (SATA II/3Gb/s) and Negotiated Link Speed is what the connected device is capable of delivering (SATA I/1.5Gb/s for SuperDrive).  \n\nProvided that both of your SATA ports are SATA II, then the only factor that could slow down the performance would be the caddy; so ensure that you get one that's SATA II or SATA III.\nAlso, keep in mind that all new SSDs are all SATA III, but they are backward compatible so, even though they are capable of 6Gb/s, the most you'll get is 3Gb/s.\n", "Q: Mac automatically restarts after shutdown I was using Win 10 on my 2017 21.5\" iMac before, but formatted it and installed Mac Mojave again. Here format means I've formatted the data disk as well as system disk, merged all partitions and make only one volume. And installed Mojave.\nNow if I select \"Shutdown\" in the Finder menu the Mac always automatically restarts instead. I am using power button to shutdown the computer. Sometimes, the computer restarts itself - without any action. Weird.\nHow can I fix or diagnose this?\n\nA: I used to work as an Apple technician and I'v had several Macs that describe your issue, but they were only laptops. The issue with them was liquid damaged. Now you thinking how the h'll can an iMac get liquid damaged, but I can tell you, I'v actually seen it myself. So it's possible but maybe not in your case.\nI recommend to let an Apple technician look at it. Water damage causes a fault in the circuitry, but the same fault can happen from other causes or just rare breakage. \n", "Q: Is there an Ubuntu documented build to run on 2018 MacBook Pro? I have a 2018 13\" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports, and I wanted to know where I lie with Ubuntu (or another distro) for dual booting.\nI have successfully booted Ubuntu onto my Mac, from a USB drive and it works with an external keyboard and mouse, but that's not perfect and I'd like it fully working if possible.\nI have come across this and it looks promising, however my Mac is a 15,1 and I can only find a 15,2 there. Strangely, there are two 15,2 MacBook Pros - 15\" 2018 and 15\" 2019. Mine, of course, is neither. I’m basically a little unsure how the marketing / model year numbers are supported for Ubuntu.\nIs there an easy to install (i.e. well documented) distribution of Ubuntu that works on a 2018 MacBook Pro?\n\nA: This is something that must be extrapolated as the 2015 through 2017 MacBook Pro's aren't vastly different than the 2018-2019 MacBook Pros.   The key functions:\n* Audio                   → Not Working\n* Suspend & Hibernation   → Partially Working\n* TouchBar                → Partially Working\n* TouchID                 → Not Working\n* WiFi                    → Working on 13,2; 13,3; 14,2; 14,3\n\nThese will follow with the same statuses as MacBook Pro models 13,2 through 14,3 as noted.\nNow, one very safe bet is to go for the main LTS build of Ubuntu as it is exceptionally well documented and has several dedicated support sites as well as this Q&A site.\nNow, it's entirely possible that nothing works because of the new T2 chip that encrypts and controls the storage meaning you have to disable all boot security unless Apple signs your OS.  Given that, running Ubuntu on a 2018 and beyond MacBook Pro computer will be limited to virtualization - VirtualBox, Parallels, VMWare, etc. (IMO) this is a better path to pursue.\nYou can disable external boot and run externally, but the T2 SSD aren’t available for any OS other than Windows or macOS in 2020 due to secure boot and lack of drivers for the T2.\n\nA: If you don't want to use extra keyboard and mouse drivers you need at least version 5.3 of the Linux kernel (the current stable version is 5.4.8).  As mentioned in your link to State of Linux on the MacBook Pro 2016 & 2017 \n\nKeyboard & Touchpad\nWorks out of the box with Linux 5.3 and above.\nFor earlier Linux versions you can get the driver from\n  https://github.com/roadrunner2/macbook12-spi-driver.\n\nThis would therefore be Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine) which was released in October 2019.  The current LTS will not work as it has Kernel version 5.0.\n\nUbuntu 18.04.3 ships with a v5.0 based Linux kernel updated from the v4.18 based kernel in 18.04.2.\n\nIf you want a LTS release then according to Ubuntu documentation you need to wait.  This kernel will be included in the LTS release 18.04.4 scheduled for February 2020.\nKeep an eye on the Arch Wiki and State of Linux on the MacBook Pro 2016 & 2017 for more up-to date info but in general as recent Macs are poorly supported LTS is not a good choice.  As the link says:\n\nTo state the obvious: The newer the kernel the better. The information below assumes that you run Linux 4.13 or newer. If in doubt which kernel to use, the latest significant improvements are part of Linux 5.3.\n\n", "Q: Toggle default between Imessage and Text for specific recipient? My wife currently has no roaming data available and so I need to text her rather than imessage.  I know I can hold down on the blue imessage and choose Send as Text, but is there a way to toggle my phone to default to sending as a text until she has roaming availability?  And then toggle it back to default for imessage?\nI have XR, she has 7+, both fully updated.\n\nA: \nis there a way to toggle my phone to default to sending as a text\n  until she has roaming availability?\n\nNo.  This is not possible.\nThere is no way for your iPhone, Mac, or even Apple's iMessage servers to know whether your wife's phone is roaming or not.  \nRoaming is a carrier function designed to allow the user to seamlessly use their home carrier services on a different carriers network.  The phone doesn't notify any other phones it's not on its home network.\n\nroaming refers to the ability for a cellular customer to automatically make and receive voice calls, send and receive data, or access other services, including home data services, when traveling outside the geographical coverage area of the home network, by means of using a visited network.\n\nIf roaming is an issue, you should use a 3rd party app like WhatsApp or have your wife turn off roaming altogether.\n", "Q: Connecting to MacBook Air 2017 with usb-c connection I have my work computer that I connect to my dual monitor setup, and my MacBook Air 2017 that I can't since it doesn't have a usb-c port. \nIs there any way I can use the same hub with ubc-c connection for my MacBook?\n\nA: Assuming that you have a USB hub/dock with a USB-C connection....\nThe answer is no because the USB ports on your MBA is USB 3.0 while the USB-C connection is at minimum, 3.1.  USB is backward compatible with downstream devices and in your case, the downstream device (the hub) is a higher spec.\n", "Q: Using iPad as second screen without sidecar I have a MacBook Air 2017 which is not compatible with sidecar, and since I upgraded to Catalina it doesn't work with the third party service I had been using (DeutDisplay). \nDoes anyone know a way to use my iPad Air 2 as a second monitor for my computer?\n\nA: Astropad and their luna display hardware and app are what you want when sidecar isn’t fast enough or doesn’t support your hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://blog.astropad.com/astropad-vs-apples-sidecar/\n\n*https://lunadisplay.com/\nI’ve used Luna since the kickstarter days and you should be able to find one used if you need that specifically instead of the full AstroPad app. The new hardware is excellent as well, so give them a chance if you like what you see.\nI used duet before and the astropad performance and experience on the Mac side were substantially faster, more reliable and used less cpu / energy. \n", "Q: How can I stop the bookmark/reading list from showing up when I hover to the left of the screen in Safari? The bookmark/reading list sidebar shows up when one points their curosor to the left edge of the safari screen. Is there a setting that can prevent the sidebar from showing up?\n\nA: It only does that in fullscreen. I don't know of any switch for it.\nPersonally, I'd just never run it in fullscreen.\n", "Q: How can I evaluate which SSD adapter is functional with 2013 MacBook Air parts? I need to connect my MacBook Air 11\" mid 2013 SSD drive to another Macbook since I have to initialise it in the right format.\nI'm searching for an adapter that has at one side the right connector for the SSD and on the other side a USB port. \nThe problem is that I don't know which one to choose since a normal SATA port would be too big.\nJust to be clear the SSD I'm talking about is this one: \nit's so tiny and I don't know if there's a USB adapter for this one so I can remove the internal storage and mount it to another computer over USB or faster interface. What adapters can read Apple OEM storage from the Air?\n\nA: Apple uses a proprietary connector, which is usually described as a 12+16 pin PCIe connector. Or more simply \"Mac SSD\".\nThere are USB enclosures for these blades, though they tend to be very expensive - $70 to $100. Here's one:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/QNINE-Enclosure-MacBook-External-Adapter/dp/B076KDPZMM/\nHowever, note that this particular one claims not to work with Apple SSDs made by Toshiba or SanDisk.\nYou might be best off putting it back into a Mac and formatting it and installing MacOS using Internet Recovery.

I have a new computer and want to create a guest user whom's all data is not deleted every time it logs out. On my old computer I just created a user called guest and left the password field empty but now, in Catalina, the password field is required (although my other computer's guest account remain passwordless even after upgrading to Catalina).\nAny workarounds? Or can the password somehow be deleted after the account is created?\nPlease note: the built-in guest account functionality doesn't fit my purpose.\n\nA: I'm running macOS Catalina 10.15.2 and guest is a reserved name, so you cannot use it.\nI also just created a new standard account without a password. Just didn't put in a password and followed through with the prompts appropriately.\nNote: My Mac is not encrypted and does not have the T2 chip. Either or both of these may require a password to be assigned.\nOne thing you can try is in Terminal use the passwd command to change the password to a blank password. This worked for me on my system, however keep in mind the note above.\n", "Q: Apple Business Manager. How do we revoke a code or license? We are not using a MDM The small dev company that I work for has been contracted to build an app for client. This client is using Apple Business Manager and wants us to publish to it.\nI have built the app and deployed it for review to the Apple Connect. It passed and I see it is now in the client's Apple Business Manager account.\nHere is where I am confused. Our client DOES NOT have a MDM. How can I use Apple Business Manager in this case?\nInitially I thought I could simply use redemption codes, but now I see that this is not going to work, as redemption codes are similar to \"gift cards\" that we give out to people. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to manage them and revoke them when we need so.\nIt seems that the only way to manage the licenses is to implement a MDM (like Mobile Iron, etc.), but this seems like a lot of work.  There must be another way.   What about contractors that require a corporate app? Surely, there has to be a way to use the Managed Licensing aspect of ABM without using a MDM.\nHow can use ABM to do \"managed licensing\" without our client(s) having a MDM. Is there a way that I can revoke a redemption code once I have issued it?\n\n\nA: The ordinary way to do what you want is to use MDM.\nIf you do not want your client to setup MDM, then the only way to do this is by adding a login system to your app. This way you can have employees of your customer install the app via the App Store using redemption codes, and then be able to stop them from using the app by invalidating their login.\nTo make matters easier, you could implement the initial login in the form of a link for the employee to follow (similar to the link used to redeem the app), it could be a QR-code to scan or a simple username/password.\n\nA: Basically, no. You could put your app on the main App Store, publish it over TestFlight or have your client get going with an MDM.\nThere’s no easy way to side load apps aside from MDM so unless they jump through all the hoops to enterprise sign an app and you hand them the build, they need to get going selecting an MDM to push the VPP codes from the B2B App Store.\nGet them started with Jamf Now - it’s cloud hosted, has amazing support from the vendor and community and is free for the first 3 manaded devices so you can do a proof of concept before paying:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/\nThe company has much larger issues without an MDM than managing your app, IMHO. \n", "Q: My 6S screen has gone black. What do I do? My 6S screen has gone black.\nHow do I reset the display functionally?\n\nA: If the screen stays black after a reboot it's most likely a hardware issue.

After finishing two pictures on it, I can say that it has some kind of a noticeable skew in its color/brightness/contrast for some reason.\nBoth my Android phone and my PC's flatscreen show that what looked like deep and crisp color.  However, the 10.2 screen looks way lighter, more blurry and with far more noticeable brush edges where there were none on the iPad.\nI was drawing in Ibis Paint, but judging by the fact that opening the image in the tablet's gallery app gave me the same results, it looks like the problem is either with the hardware, or with the system settings.\nHow do I make it work without manually tweaking every picture on my PC afterwards?\n\nA: Unless you have accurately calibrated all your screens with a hardware colorimeter, then the chances are the iPad is the most accurate \"out of the box\".\nMost devices' screens tend to be 'punched up' by the manufacturers to look good on the shop floor. If uncorrected after purchase, this can lead to very misleading colour workflows. Apple tends to do this less and instead relies on the deep colour capabilities of the screen itself - which can handle P3 colour, not just the sRGB common to most devices.\nThere's a good blog on how this can be perceived visually on IconFactory - Looking at the Future with some good imagery to test & some hints as to how to manage colour across platforms - something about which entire books have been written.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for Safari stop loading webpage button While a page is loading, I somewant to stop it midway once the important bits have been loaded, and I don't want to continue loading the other unnecessary stuff on the page.

If I partition my external drive into two parts, I'd like to be able to remove the partition at a later time in case I decide Time Machine should take up the whole disk.\nSimilarly, if I'm using Time Machine right after taking the external drive out of the box, I'd like to be able to partition the drive at a later time with the TM backup data still intact.\nWhich of the above two actually work?\n\nA: What I have done with my 1TB external backup drive is to add one additional APFS volume with a reserve size of 400GB that I name \"Files\" so that I can use the same external drive for both Time Machine and general file storage.\nHere are the steps that I used with a new, empty Samsung T5 1TB SSD:\n\n*\n\n*Connect the Samsung T5 drive to the Mac and open Disk Utility.\n\n*Right-click the Samsung T5 drive in the left-hand pane and select \"Erase\".\n\n*In the Erase dialog, set Name to \"TimeMachine\", set Scheme to \"Guid Partition Map\" and Format to \"APFS\".\n\n\n\n*Right-click the TimeMachine volume that was created above and select \"Add APFS Volume\".\n\n*Name the new volume \"Files\" and click the \"Size Options\" button.\n\n*Set the Reserve Size to 400GB (or however much you’d like to reserve) and click OK.\n\n\nOnce you have done this, you can open the Time Machine utility and select the \"TimeMachine\" volume as a backup disk, and still have a separate \"Files\" volume that you can use for general file storage using typical utilities such as Finder.\nThese steps don't necessarily have to be done before configuring Time Machine to use the external drive. I was able to add an additional APFS volume to a drive that only has one volume that had already been set up for use with Time Machine by right-clicking the existing volume in Disk Utility and adding a new one.\n\nA: You can do either, partition now and remove later or add a partition later. It's up to you.\nSome caveats to consider:\n\n*\n\n*Drives are cheap nowadays. If you really need  space for other files (not Time Machine), get another drive.\n\n*Nobody ever said they had too much space for backups, use the whole drive for TM.\n\n*I never liked partitioning drives with live data on  it  without having at least a backup.

These are the \"programmer's defaults\" that can be overridden in the following ways: for the global screenrc file screen searches for  the  environment  variable  $SYS-SCREENRC  (this  override  feature  may  be  disabled at compile-time). The user specific screenrc file is searched in $SCREENRC, then $HOME/.screenrc.  The command line option -c takes precedence over the  above searched in $SCREENRC, then $HOME/.screenrc.

For example, according to man screen Apple packages screen ver 4.0.2 (January 2004 vintage) with macOS 10.14.6; that release was 16 years ago this month.\nIs there a process outside macOS for updating this part of the system that's \"sanctioned\" by Apple? (By \"sanctioned\" I only mean a procedure designated by Apple to maintain system integrity.)\nIf not, has Apple acknowledged this situation? By that I'm only trying to learn if I missed something.\n\nA: The only real issue I see here is the mentioning of /usr/local/etc in the man page. This most probably is just an oversight by Apple when they copied the man page 1:1 from the distribution. On Mojave, screen reads the default configuration from /private/etc/screenrc (which doesn't exist unless you create it).\n$ strings /usr/bin/screen | grep screenrc\n%s/.screenrc\n-c file       Read configuration file instead of '.screenrc'.\nSorry, too late now. Place that in your .screenrc file.\n/private/etc/screenrc\n$ ls /private/etc/screenrc\nls: /private/etc/screenrc: No such file or directory\n\nFor the other items\n\n\n*\n\n*environment variables can be used to point to defaults but they are not mandatory. They just give you the option to read screenrc(the system-wide default usually read from /private/etc/screenrc) or  .screenrc (the user-specific default usually read from ~/.screenrc) from somewhere else (or use a tailored one for specific needs)\n\n*etc/screenrc and etc/etcscreenrc \"are shipped  as  examples  with  your  screen  distribution\", the path is relative to the distribution directory of the source code. They probably are not included in macOS, if required you can get the source code from Apple or GNU (screenrc, etcscreenrc).\n\n\nPS: Man pages are part of the standard macOS installation, there is no separate process to update them.\nPPS: More recent versions of standard Unix/GNU tools can usually be installed via Homebrew.\n\nA: \nIs there a separate update process in macOS required to get updates for the unix tools and system manuals? For example, according to man screen Apple packages screen ver 4.0.2 (January 2004 vintage) with macOS 10.14.6; that release was 16 years ago this month.\n\nNo.  There is no separate process to update Unix tools/utilities.\nIt’s just very unlikely that the Unix tools will be updated past the versions you’re seeing now.\nWhy?  GPL Licensing.\nUsing screen as an example, it will likely remain on version 4.0.2 because that was the last version that used the less restrictive GPLv2 public license.  Version 4.2 (2007) and subsequent releases use the GPLv3 which Apple generally doesn’t want to comply with.\nSee Is macOS mostly closed source? for more info.\nAs to the issues you raised regarding screen:\n\n*\n\n*/usr/local/etc is a BSD directory.  A lot of macOS has BSD underpinnings, but this directory is not used.\n\n*A lot of environment variables are not set by the OS and this is quite common across all OSes; macOS, BSD, and even Linux distros like RedHat.\n\n*Sample config files not being included in the OS is also common\n\n*Apple doesn’t rewrite the man pages for the changes they make (which the GPLv2 license allows them to do)\n\n\nIf not, has Apple acknowledged this situation? By that I'm only trying to learn if I missed something.\n\nThere’s nothing to acknowledge as this was done intentionally by Apple.  If you want to “update” to the latest version of a Unix utility, you either have to compile it from source, use MacPorts or HomeBrew.  You’ll have to manage the updating of them, however.\nAre macOS man pages outdated?\nNo.  They are the correct man pages for the versions of the utilities that ship with macOS.\n", "Q: how to configure shared iPad for Apple Business Manager?

For your Mac, this software can be found at Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033. \n\n*FAT32 format the second flash drive. Be sure to use a MBR partitioning scheme. For example, you could use the macOS Disk Utility application to erase the flash drive using the parameters shown in the image below.\n\n\n*Copy the Windows Support Software to root folder on the second flash drive. For example, you could use the macOS Finder application to copy the files.\n\n*Put a copy of gdisk for windows on second flash drive. \n\n*With both flash drives inserted in USB ports on the Mac, use rEFInd to boot from flash drive created with Rufus.\n\n*Use shift+f10 key combination to open a Command Prompt window. \n\n*Use Method 1 in this answer to convert in internal drive from pure GPT to hybrid partitioned.\n\n*Exit the Command Prompt window and complete the installation of Windows 7.\n\n*Install the Window Support Software.\n\n", "Q: Is the source code for xnu-6153.60.66~39 available? (iOS 13.3 Kernel) I cannot find xnu-6153.60.66~39 at https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/xnu/ ! Does apple still open source the XNU Kernel? \n\nA: Yes, Apple does still open source the XNU kernel. However, there's usually quite a time lag from the time macOS is released for iOS products and until the corresponding XNU kernel source is publicized.\nTherefore you cannot find the exact version you're seeking anywhere. iOS 13.3 is very new, and no public source code has been made available for that kernel version yet.\nUsually Apple makes new releases of the XNU kernel source 2-6 times per year.

It works fine, except that the @ symbol is at the \"L\" key and not on the \"Q\".\nI could not find a way to change the configuration of the Mac to match my needs.\nHow to solve this?\n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources and make sure this is set to \"German Standard\" and not \"German\".\nIf this does not do the trick, or if you do not have the choice of German Standard, then it is pretty easy to make a custom layout to put this character anywhere you like with the app Ukelele.\n", "Q: How can I reset SSD on MacBook Air I changed the motherboard of a MacBook Air A1465 11\" mid 2013 because the previous one had a problem with the RAM. \nI boot the device in recovery mode in order to install the OS but the SSD is not recognised by the disk utility, so I search online and I find that I can see if the terminal recognises the SSD, in fact it does.\nI use the command diskutil list and It appears a list of disks with my SSD in it. \nThen I try to use the commands \"diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ mySSD /dev/disk22\", \"diskutil eraseDisk /dev/disk22\", \"diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk22 GPT JHFS+ New 0b\" and each time the process starts but after a while I receive a Error saying: \"Error: -69877: Couldn't open device\". After this error the disk disappears from the disks list.\nI found out that when I use the command \"diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk22\" I can actually see the disk in the disk utility interface, but when I try to erase it as I did before, the same error occurs. \n\nA: Some disks (like Transcent Jetdrive disks) need specific drivers and do not function under and OS older than 10.12.. Try and boot into the different options for recovery (like Command-R / Option-Command-R / Shift-Option-Command-R) and see if the disk is recognized in any of the versions.\nApple gear boots from external drives easily so you can always get a usb connector to test if the drive will work and do an erase install.

In Catalina (maybe earlier) Installer.app has an option Install just for me (or something like that, my translation from a non-English version) but most of the time it is disabled (in fact, I think I never have seen it enabled).\nI would like to use that option, for example when installing something downloaded from an unknown website, and install in a non-admin user account (or even in the Guest account = everything is deleted when logging out) as a basic security measure against malware.\nCan I somehow force enable this option?\nI see no reason for it to be disabled for most userspace software. Every user has their own Library directory and well written applications should anyway look in the current user's Library before /Library or any other shared area on the drive.\n\nA: The usual reason for using a .pkg is that the app requires support files in specific file locations.\nAn installer package will only allow the option of user-domain installation if the developer has expressly set and catered for that option. \nWith the latest security features in Catalina (and Mojave to a lesser extent), I would suggest that the difference between root level and user level installation (as far as limits on malware go) is minimal.\nHowever, you could try using Pacifist, the third-party installer app, which allows you to browse the contents of installer packages and install to specific locations. Note that doing this may cause problems with pre- and post-install scripts contained in the .pkg file, which may expect files to be in particular places.\n", "Q: How to remotely connect Macs across different networks? I'm trying to connect two Macs that are not in the same Wi-Fi network.\nI'd like to use terminal instead of available Remote Desktop programs.\nMy remote Mac had already all the preferences active in \"sharing\" prefs.\nProblem is... while I can do that from the same network using \nopen vnc://name.IpAddress\n\nBut I have no idea how to do that from different networks. I'd like to be able not only to enter the remote Mac, but also see the screen.\nI do have full control over the hardware and software from beginning to end. The Mac will never have a monitor attached and runs my scripts and my software only. I buy the hardware, install my software, and ship. I am able to have the machine connect to their Wi-Fi so that I have all the system info needed uploaded to the database. Like local IP address... and basically everything I tell the script to do. \nHow can I remotely connect to the Mac from a different network ?\n\nA: Assuming you have a central and stationary management unit (a Mac) and several remote Macs (1:n relationship), I would choose an inverted VPN-approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a VPN-server on your central Mac. The network address of the VPN-net mustn't collide with local network addresses. Port-forward all necessary ports to your Mac on your local router. Depending on your Internet service provider and your Internet connection get a dynamic DNS-address.\n\n*Set up VPN-clients on the remote Macs and connect them to your central VPN-server. The clients mustn't route all traffic via the VPN-connection.\n\n*Enable Screen Sharing on the clients\n\n*Connect \"locally\" with your VNC-app.\n\n\n\nSince the question misses some details (e.g. macOS versions/number of remote Macs/safety rules in the remote networks/24-7 service/Internet & network stability locally and remote etc.), I can't answer the question in all its particulars.\n", "Q: mergerfs or similar on a Mac for combining multiple drives? I want to setup an old Mac Pro as a media server. In my recent setup, I use mergerfs to combine multiple drives into one which I can share. I would like to do the same on the Mac. I have seen, that mergerfs does not support the Mac, and that mhddfs is not maintained anymore. \nIs there an alternative for macOS?\n\nA: The README.md file for the mergefs project on GitHub answers this for you...\n\nmergerfs is a union filesystem geared towards simplifying storage and management of files across numerous commodity storage devices. It is similar to mhddfs, unionfs, and aufs.\n\nEmphasis Mine\nUnionfs is a FUSE project (available on GitHub) that claims to have Mac support.  There hasn’t been much development in the last few years so, how well it works with your version of macOS will be up in the air.  \nThat said, it’s probably a better idea to just standardize the formats over those multiple drives to reduce complexity and ensure reliability.  If these drives are running in different machines with different OSes, NFS might be the direction you want to go.\n", "Q: How to find out if iTerm is installed on a mac from within a shell script?

So even basic interactions with the touch screen are quite impossible. \nI tried to fiddle with the accessibility settings to no avail, but then I don't seem to quite understand what they are doing (because they do not seem to do anything useful). \nSo basically, I am looking for a touchscreen setting that translates a flailing motion into a click. Is there such a thing?\nMy wife cannot speak, either.

However, when I lost it, USB Restricted Mode was enabled.\nis it therefore impossible to brute force it? Because brute forcing such a weak code would be child’s play.\nAlso would it be possible for a hacker/police to just physically remove the hard drive from the phone, then insert it into some other machine and proceed to brute force?\nI know about the fbi case with apple, but that was a while ago. Maybe things have changed? I know the Israelis forensic team and Greykit can unlock up to iOS 12.3. Mine version is 12.3.2\nAlso how does Checkm8 fit into all of this?\nThx in advance!\n\nA: There isn’t a hard drive in iPhones, and Apple has engineered things so that it’s very expensive to get to the leads and snoop or alter the electrical signals to defeat encryption, so there’s no trivial path to decrypt or bring another os to your storage. \nHowever, you should assume that unless you’re very good the police and government can get your data by coercion or brute force - especially if their budget is $25,000 or more (and maybe far less to compromise some devices). Your 4 digit pass phrase is the weakest link so that weakens your protection substantially if iOS is not set to self erase after 10 failed attempts. \nAlso, just because an exploit or jailbreak isn’t out now, doesn’t mean they can’t image or keep your device and crack it later. The iPhone X is way on the “more secure” side so unless you chose a weak pass phrase, you’re probably safe for some time to come if they didn’t get your data from a subpoena / home computer which are far easier to seize and crack and then get to your records by account takeover. \nThere are jailbreaks for your device on both iOS 12 and iOS 13 so I wouldn’t assume you’re safe if they have physical control of the device and time to work it and get USB active:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/escapeplan/guides/jailbreakcharts\n\n*https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/czkyje/meta_latest_jailbreak_release/\n\nA: \nCan police/hackers unlock iPhones?\n\nYes.\nActually, it's more accurate to say that police have access to tools that can access iOS and Android devices.  The company is Cellebrite and for $1,500, police can send in the device to be unlocked.\nFrom a 2018 Forbes article The Feds Can Now (Probably) Unlock Every iPhone Model In Existence\n\n\"With its service offering, Cellebrite can\n  retrieve (without needing to root or jailbreak the device) the full\n  file system to recover downloaded emails, third-party application\n  data, geolocation data and system logs.

I need to change the SSD of my MacBook Air 11\" mid 2013 and I was wondering if the one of a newer MacBook Air 2017 would be compatible.\nI researched online and I think that the ports remain the same (12+16 pins) but I was wondering if there would be any drive issue, and if so if it can be easily solved. \nHow can I research what controllers or compatibility exists between OEM storage on various Mac?\n\nA: I'm the author of the Apple SSD article that klanomath linked to in their comment and I wanted to clarify some things that seem to have been misinterpreted.\nFirst of all, the Mid 2013 release of the MacBook Air 11\" absolutely can use the faster PCIe 3.0 x4 drives from the 2015-2017 MacBook Air 13\", which I refer to in the article as the Gen. 4A SSDs.\nAllan's answer mentions that the 2015-2017 MacBook Air 13\" drives are PCIe 2.0 x4, but they're in fact PCIe 3.0 x4 drives. It's the PCIe interface of the MacBook Airs logic board that is limited to PCIe 2.0 x4.\nAnd the quirky firmware changes that prevent compatibility with earlier MacBook Airs were only present in the 128GB and 256GB PCIe 2.0 x2 drives (referred to as Gen. 4C in the article) found in the Early 2015 release of the MacBook Air 11\". All of the drives found in Early 2015 and later MacBook Air 13\" laptops are 100% compatible with earlier Mid 2013 and Early 2014 MacBook Airs, as is the 512GB drive from the Early 2015 release of the MacBook Air 11\".\nEveryone in this discussion missed this paragraph from the article:\n\nDespite the two channel drive, the 11″ MacBook Air actually supports\n  four channel PCIe connections, and they can be upgraded with the Gen.\n  4A drives found in other devices. In fact, if the 11″ MacBook Air was\n  configured with a 512GB SSD from the factory, it already included the\n  same Gen. 4A drive found in the other Apple computers of the era.\n\nDespite all the good info in that article, it's a bit dense to read in places and I think much of the information could have been conveyed in a better way. I've recently started working on some improvements that should make it easier to quickly grasp the most important details and should be publishing those changes in the next couple weeks.\n\nA: No.  These SSDs are not compatible.\n\n*\n\n*The 2013-2015 MacBook Air 11\" uses a proprietary PCIe 2.0 x2 SSD.\n\n*The 2015-2017 MacBook Air 13\" uses a proprietary PCIe 2.0 x4 SSD.\n\nThe 2015 through 2017 MacBook Air laptops use the exact same interface, so, those are compatible.  Also remember that you're comparing the 11\" to the 13\" model and those are different with respect to space.\nFrom iFixit.com, I was able to find an excellent image showing the difference with the interfaces.  While it implies that the 2013 through 2017 MBA interface is the same (it is physically), one has two channels (2013) while the other has 4 (2017).  They also go on to say that it's possible to use an M.2 SSD with the use of an adapter, however, I can find no test results so YMMV.\n\nThis MacBook Air uses a proprietary storage drive connector, and is\ntherefore not compatible with common M.2 drives without the use of an\nadapter\n\n\nFrom the link provided by klanomath in the comments...\n\nDespite the two channel drive, the 11″ MacBook Air actually supports\nfour channel PCIe connections, and they can be upgraded with the Gen.\n4A drives found in other devices. In fact, if the 11″ MacBook Air was\nconfigured with a 512GB SSD from the factory, it already included the\nsame Gen. 4A drive found in the other Apple computers of the era.\n\nThis implies that the drives from the 13\" 2017 MBA will fit physically into the 2013 11\" MBA, but because of the firmware, they won't work.\n", "Q: iMac Core i3 mid 2010 hard drive removal and fan control I'm thinking of adding an SSD.  I'm getting conflicting advice as to what to do with the sensor cable if swapping the mechanical drive for an SSD.\nI think in these units, there is a sensor cable that runs to the mechanical drive, rather than a sensor probe stuck on the drive.\nI've read that some short this cable, some put a resistor on it, even some saying mover the sensor from the optical to here.  I have no idea if that is sound advice or not.\nSo it made me think, if I just do away with the mechanical drive entirely and unplug the sensor cable.  And swap out the optical for an SSD.  Will the iMac boot fine with this arrangement.  And will it be smart enough to realise that there is no HDD plugged into, let's say the main slot, and therefore not care about fan control at all for that drive?\nFor context, apparently if the sensor cable is not tackled, the fans roar at 100% for this model and similar setups, when doing a swap of the mechanical for an SSD.\n\nA: The usual result of removing the thermal sensor is roaring fans; I suspect that there's little reason for Apple to add some \"if no drive, ignore sensor\" logic, because Apple would want to replace the drive.\nThe best instructions for replacing components on your Mac can be found here:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Search?query=imac%202010\nRemember that your iMac has a SATA II (3 Gbps) controller, so you're not going to see the full benefit of the SSD: though it will probably double your HDD's speed.\nIf your iMac had Thunderbolt, then I would have said avoid the hassle and use an external drive; but it is a 10-year-old Mac!\n", "Q: Can iMovie Projects be stored in iCloud?

Only one potential fix but only works temporarily. Any help is much appreciated.\n-\nDetails\nI just received a 16\" MBP today, and set it up from Migration Assistant as I've done with many Macs successfully over the years. However, it wouldn't connect to WiFi, stating, \"Wi-Fi has the self-assigned IP address 169.254.*. and will not be able to connect to the Internet.\nThis was when I was connecting to previous known networks. However, it WAS able to connect to one open SSID which I'd never used before successfully.\nThe only fix that has mysteriously worked is to change the MAC address. When I run the command line on this forum post, the WiFi successfully connects. However, upon restart, it once again reverts to self-assigned IP. (I believe Catalina doesn't allow MAC address changes).\nCan anyone please help explain how I can resolve this, why the MAC address change works temporarily, and how I can ensure a more permanent solution? It's a custom ordered 16\" MBP that took 5 weeks for delivery, so I'd highly prefer not to send it back.\nHere are a list of things I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting SMC/NVRAM/PRAM\n\n*Renew DHCP Lease\n\n*Remove/delete network\n\n*Delete plist/prefs in the SystemConfiguration\n\n*Tried two different hotspots\n\n*Tried two physically diff networks at home and work\n\n\nA: I see two possible problems here:\nFirst possibility is that your MAC address after reboot is somehow invalid (i.e. for example set to all zeros). That could make your DHCP server (probably in your home router) reject your request for an IP address).\nCheck if that is the case by running the following command in the Terminal:\nifconfig en0\n\nNote the line that starts with \"ether\" - it should have a valid MAC address looking something like f2:23:48:a3:1e:22 or similar.\nSecond possibility is that the problem is really with your WIFi router / DHCP server and not locally with your laptop. This could happen if your router added the new MacBook Pro's MAC address to a block list or similar.\nCheck the router's settings and management interface to ensure that the MAC address of your new MacBook Pro is not listed in any black lists - and if you have white listed your old computer, then white list your new computer as well.\n", "Q: Replacing MacBook Pro Hard Drive?

I have a set of pictures named as hex representation of UUIDs. I want to see them ordered alphabetically as strings, but regardless what I try, the app shows me it differently:\n\nI have these settings about grouping:\n\nand sorting:\n\nI think I figured out the order it represents. It looks like it tries to cut the longest string of decimal digits from the beginning of the name, interprets it as a number, and orders by this number. Albeit it can be convenient in some cases, it is not desired for me.\nIs it possible to switch off this feature in Finder and obtain normal alphabetical sort order?\nEDIT: this question shines a light on the sorting algorithm but does not suggest how to switch it to normal string sorting.\n\nA: Apple's Finder has been using \"natural\" sort order (where strings of digits are ordered as single characters) for file names for nearly 20 years, since OS X 10.0 There's no way to change it as far as I know. If you want the other kind of sort order, you have to use Terminal or a 3rd party app.\n\nA: I recall this happening to me, the problem is the button you are referring to is actually \"group by\" not sort by. I see this as a serious design flaw from Apple, but whatever.\nRight-click somewhere on finder.

But again, I need the authentication user logs for a specific application not the crash logs.\nThanks a lot in advance for your help.\n\nA: If you do not see the log file you need along the crash logs in XCode or Apple Configurator 2, then the log file is not available here.\nIn that case the log file is something proprietary to the app - i.e. for example just a text file that the app writes to during execution. In that case, the text file is within the app's document folder. You can use the \"Files\" app on the iOS device to look inside the app's folder for the log file.\nIf you do not see the log file there, I think you might be mistaken that there should be a log file at all. If you haven't got a manual, support web site or similar stating that there should be a log file, there usually isn't a log file.\nYou could use a program like iDevice Manager or similar to browse the file system on the iOS device to look for a log file within the app's folder.

Should I eject the device first? Or can I just unplug my iPad or iPhone when I am done charging.\n\nA: What is best practice? It is always best to eject removable media (iDevice, external storage, etc.) before disconnecting it.\nIs is 'safe' if you don't eject first? Mostly yes, but not guaranteed. As long as there isn't an active file transfer, or the device isn't otherwise being accessed by your computer, its pretty much fine to do. Though there is a chance for corruption, I don't think I've ever encountered it over the numerous times I've done it - accidentally or not.\nAside: last I checked, the most Apple USB buses supply a measly 0.5 amps, so you'll get much faster charging performance if you use the supplied power adapter with your device.\n\nA: I had an iPhone 6 until 3 days ago. I bought the iPhone 6 new when they were first introduced. I'm retired so I'm home a lot. Just about every day I would plug my iPhone into my charger in the morning and unplug it to take into the bedroom at night. I always just unplugged it so this process went on for over 3-4 years. Based on this I'd say it was safe to just unplug the phone.  I replaced my battery once when Apple had their universal battery replacement program a couple of years ago.

I believe Bluetooth devices can wake MacBooks so I wonder if this is a theft risk. \nIs it possible for thieves to detect sleeping MacBooks in car trunks by using Bluetooth devices or signals?\n\nA: No, it’s not plausible for thieves to scan for Bluetooth signals to detect sleeping Macs.\nFor your MacBook (or any device, for that matter) to respond, it must be in discovery mode.  This is a mode that answers pairing requests and must be initiated by the user.  This is why, in macOS you have to go into Bluetooth settings to do this.\nWhen your MacBook sleeps (lid closed), Bluetooth is turned off.  Even Power Nap, which periodically enables WiFi (networking) to check for emails and such. It would make no sense for your laptop to continually broadcast Bluetooth signals while sleeping as this would drain the battery.\n\nBluetooth is disabled. NOTE: This can be changed in your Bluetooth system preferences, in which you can actually choose to make bluetooth devices power on your computer.\n\nSource:  What Happens When You Put Mac Laptops to Sleep? \nWhile it is possible for Bluetooth devices to wake a computer\n\n*\n\n*your computer would be in listening mode; not transmitting\n\n*The device would need to be already paired to wake it\n\n*It can’t override the closed lid; it won’t go into closed clamshell mode as you need to have power, keyboard and mouse attached.\n\nThieves are more likely to be watching your actions rather than trying to scan for radio signals when they break into vehicles.\n\nA: I want to believe that the answer is no for the reasons that Allan suggested about the Mac having to be in discovery or “pairing” mode.\nHowever, I find myself wondering about the setting “Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer” (System Preferences » Bluetooth » Advanced) which is on by default.\n\nThat seems like might imply the Mac could be open to receive or check for Bluetooth signals.\nOn the other hand, the descriptive text in the small print suggests that this only works with keyboards/mice/trackpads which are already paired with the Mac. So maybe it would not work with a Bluetooth scanner.\nThe biggest problem is that I don't know how these BT scanners really work.\nCan anyone say definitively that there is no tool out there can ever detect a Bluetooth signal from a sleeping Mac?\nThe only way I would feel 100% confident  would be if Bluetooth was actually disabled when the Mac goes to sleep.\nHow would you do that? Well, one way would be with Keyboard Maestro and a macro which triggers when the Mac goes to sleep:\n\nNote that for this to work you must have installed blueutil.\nBy running /usr/local/bin/blueutil --power 0 --discoverable 0 when your Mac goes to sleep, I would feel 100% confident that no Bluetooth scanner would be able to detect it.\nIf you regularly use Bluetooth, you could have another Keyboard Maestro macro that runs on wake and does\n/usr/local/bin/blueutil --power 1\nto turn Bluetooth back on, or\n/usr/local/bin/blueutil --power 1 --discoverable 1\nto turn Bluetooth on and make it discoverable.\nAgain, I think Allan’s argument makes sense, but because I don’t know if there are scanners out there which can detect a device which can receive a Bluetooth signal even if it is not paired with that device, I don’t feel like I can make a definitive statement.\n\nUpdate: Since I wrote this, Allan has expanded his answer with a link to MacEnthusiasts.com which makes it seem even more likely that he is correct. If the Bluetooth really is powered off when the lid is closed, then the Keyboard Maestro macros would be superfluous. However, I know that was not always the case with older versions of macOS and/or Mac hardware, as I used to accidentally have my MacBook wake up in my backpack with the lid closed due to (I believe) a paired Bluetooth device waking it. But maybe my experience is now outdated information.\n", "Q: Deleting Contacts I recently added an iPhone for my daughter to my account.

Additionally, since you have numeric characters in both what you want retained and not, then as currently coded it removes all numeric characters.\nWhile your current code could be reworked, I'm not inclined to do that as from both deleted comments and still existing comments you've left out vital information in the OP. That said, I'll assume for the moment that all target strings will have either , [ ... ] or  [ ... ] that needs to be removed and the following sed command handles the example value of theName variable in your OP and in the comments.\nSo whether you have:\nset theName to \"@junior_cat23, [ID]-[E9B-Z8X-H1V-722]\"\n\nOr:\nset theName to \"@junior_cat23 @james_cat24 [ID]-[E9B-Z8X-H1V-722]\"\n\nThen:\ndo shell script \"sed -E -e 's|\\\\[.*||' -e 's|,||g' -e 's|^[ ]+||' -e 's|[ ]+$||'<<<\" & theName's quoted form\n\n      • Hint: Mouse over and horizontal scroll to see full code.\nReturns:\n@junior_cat23\n\nOr:\n@junior_cat23 @james_cat24\n\nWithout any leading/trailing spaces.\n\nUnderstanding the do shell script and sed commands:\n\n*\n\n*do shell script -- Executes a shell script using the sh shell.\n\n*sed -- Stream Editor.\n\n*-E -- Interpret regular expressions as extended (modern) regular expressions rather than basic regular expressions (BRE’s).

Is there a single Terminal command or menubar application that can do this as well? I'm looking for some kind of single action I can fire off to handle the entire booting-into-Windows scheme.\n\nA: With System Integrity Protection enabled, this is difficult to accomplish.

You can then install scripts which can configure rEFInd to instruct the firmware to boot Windows after restarting the Mac. \n\nNote: I do not know how the new T2 Security Chip will restrict the capabilities of rEFInd.\n\nThe idea is simple.

I only sync Contacts, appointments, and notes [2].\nAccording to https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph3d1110d4/ios, the default calendar in iOS 13 is set via \"Settings > Calendar > Default Calendar\".  In the panel for \"Settings > Calendar\", I have no \"Default Calendar\" field.\nIs there a more updated documentation for setting the default calendar?  I am using iOS 13.3.\nFootnotes:\n[1] While not necessarily relevant to the problem, I use AkrutoSync to interface with Outlook and present an Exchange interface to the iPhone.\n[2] For email, I use Navigator to access a webmail interface.\n\nA: I ran into this problem myself when I switched to iOS 13.3 on an iPhone Max Pro. Try this: In \"Settings,\" tap on your name and photo at the top of the page (the one that says \"Apple ID, Cloud, iTunes and App Store\"). Tap on \"iCloud.\" Under \"Apps Using iCloud,\" activate \"Calendars.\" When you go back to the Calendar app, \"Default Calendar\" should now be an option.

A \"pro\" feature is to make it start at login, which can be done from Users and groups>Login items. However, this app seemingly removes itself from this list upon restart.\nCan this behavior be changed? I feel like it's fairly intrusive that applications can manipulate this list on my behalf.\nEDIT:\nTo elaborate, this is not about not wanting to support developers which I do all the time being one myself. This is more about questioning malware-like behavior of software that, without your permission whatsoever, can modify OS-level settings.\n\nA: Yes, you can change it by buying the Pro version of Matthew Palmer's Vanilla which will allow you to permanently add the app to the Login Items list.\nIf you really do not want to give 4.99$ to a guy giving out free software that he spends his own time making, you could startup the app using launchd or similar that doesn't use Login Items. Or you use a similar method to re-add it to Login Items when it is removed.\n", "Q: How to see all windows of an application within a space? I am a fan of the exposé feature in Mac.

My macbook pro early 2011 has an SSD with 2 partitions (disk0s1 = 50Gb for time machine backups and disk0s2 =206Gb boot and data). \nI have somehow managed to totally fill up my boot partition to over 205GB and the macbook does not boot. Using the diskutility I cannot decrease the 50GB disk0s1 partition and increase the disk0s2 partition. The repair tool ends with an error also.\nWhat can I do to either copy the data from the partition or decrease the partition so that the mac can boot again?\n\nA: I think it's impossible (pre-APFS) to delete the first partition. You can expand a partition 'upwards' into free space, but you can't move down a later partition.\nIf you think that stuff on the boot volume could be deleted until there's sufficient free space, then that might be enough to get you up and running for the time being.\nEasiest would be to boot from an external drive and then explore the internal volume from there. (Or using Target Mode from another Mac.) Alternatively, you could mount the boot volume in Recovery's Terminal and delete files from there, if you're comfortable with that.\nBut most solutions will require you to copy everything off, wipe the disk and then put it all back. A utility like Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! can make disk images easily.\n\nIMPORTANT WARNING\nBefore attempting any adjustment to the disk partition, you need to make a backup of the boot volume on a separate device, in case it goes wrong and you wipe the disk.\nThere is absolutely no value in having a backup partition on the same device as the source data. If the SSD fails or you wipe it; if the laptop gets stolen or catches fire: you've got nothing. \nBackups need to be on a separate physical device.\n", "Q: Catalina, randomly crashes on login screen after sleep Since I updated to macOS Catalina - 10.15.0, I'm experiencing random \"crashes\" on the login screen after I wake my MBP (2019) up.

PRAM (Parameter RAM) stores similar information, and the steps for resetting NVRAM and PRAM are the same.\nSettings that can be stored in NVRAM include sound volume, display resolution, startup disk selection, time zone, and recent kernel panic information. The settings stored in NVRAM depend on your Mac and the devices that you're using with your Mac.\nIf you experience issues related to these settings or others, resetting NVRAM might help.\nHow to reset NVRAM:\nShut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together:\n Opt ⌥   Cmd ⌘  P R\nYou can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart.\nMore detail from the Offical Apple Support page\n\nA: Given that you've tried resetting NVRAM, the only practical next step is to reinstall macOS, before doing this you need to take a backup.\nThere are two ways to go about this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall over the top, this should maintain files and settings and replace the operating system, this may work, if it doesn't then...\n\n*Clean install and re-setup your Mac.\nIf neither of these steps work then you'll need to take it in for hardware service, but it seems unlikely the issue is with hardware.\n", "Q: Calls and messages won't come through when screen is locked iPhone SE I've been having this issue for a while now and even the newest iOS didn't seem to solve it:\nThe problem is that sometimes I just won't receive calls and/or messages.\nI figured it happens completely random, but in most cases it happens when the screen is locked - that means, even if I am passively using phone - listening to music and if the screen is locked, I'd sometimes get missed messages/calls - It doesn't ring, I don't get any alerts until after I wake up my phone. Then I get the notification of a missed call or that of a message that was delivered x minutes ago.\n\n\n*\n\n*'Do not disturb' is off, I've also talked to people who couldn't reach me because of this problem and they said the phone was just ringing until the call was eventually dropped. \n\n*I've sent the list of missed calls to my carrier in case the problem might be on their side, but they've been unable to find anything out of the ordinary.

I've had a 2013 13\" MacBook pro with a small SSD, 8GBs of ram and a i5 since I bought it new. I was always impressed by how I rarely heard the fan turn on at all during normal usage and when I did it was still very quiet. \nI just bought a used 2015 model 13\" MacBook pro with a 2TB SSD, 16GB of ram and an i7. I haven't used it extensively yet, but I've already noticed the fan running much more frequently and loudly. I was just installing Xcode and it sounded like it was on full blast for the entire process. \nIs this to be expected because of the i7? Or due to some other difference in internals? Or is this indicative of some issue?\nThe computer is used but only has 260 battery cycles. \n\nA: There's nothing about i7's in particular the determine that they should always lead to more fan noise than an i5. In many cases, i5's and i7's have similar thermal design power points.\nNote that you're comparing an 2013 MacBook Pro with an i5 with a 2015 MacBook Pro with an i7. They're different in many ways. Therefore you cannot really say anything meaningful about whether it is due to an i7 or some particular other thing.\nHowever, if you're annoyed by the noise, I would suggest cleaning the fans. Your laptop has potentially seen 4 years of use in an environment you do not know. The fans could be very dirty and that could in itself lead to a lot of extra noise. It might also be possible to reduce noise by reapplying cooling paste to the CPU.\n", "Q: PHP not running after upgrading to Catalina I've followed all the tutorials, updated httpd.conf and other files.

Discussion in comments below this answer to improving speed of this numpy-based diffraction calculator suggest that the reason the script in the answer runs slow for me but fast for others (even on earlier versions of NumPy) might be that my late 2012 MacBook Air's processor L1 cache might be smaller than others. It could also be that I am running dangerously low on disk space (I was seeing 40 MB/sec reads and writes while running).\nI'm curious though, what is the size of the on-processor L1 cache for my late 2012 MacBook Air, and how does it compare to new MacBooks?\nMacBook Air:   13-inch, Mid 2012\nProcessor:     1.8 GHz Intel Core i5\nMemory:        4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nHard Drive:    251 GB Flash Storage\n\nI'm not a developer, but I did a small test. Running the script below I see that multiplication of two NumPy arrays is fastest (a few nanoseconds per float multiply) when the array size is about 10^4. Each is about 8 bytes, so I'm estimating that my L1 cache size is about 10^5 Bytes.\nIs that close?\nnote: I estimate time using both time.time() and time.process_time().

So your guess of 10^5 bytes is not far off!\nThe latest MacBook Air has the same amount of L1 cache, so in that respect it is the same. However, other parts of the CPU are vastly different.\nNote that your might see that some of these CPUs are listed as having \"Smart Cache\", which essentially means that some caches are shared among multiple cores. In your case, the L1 cache is never shared - so it is always a private cache for each core. This means that if your code is single threaded, then the actual amount of L1 cache used by that program is actually 64 kB and not 128 kB.\nIn addition to that, the L1 cache is actually not a single cache as such,. It is split into seperate portions for instructions and data. This means that with the 64 kB, you will have cached 32 kB of data and 32 kB of instructions (program code).\nYou might wonder why the new MacBook Air has the same amount of L1 cache and think that it hasn't kept up with the development in the industry - but that's actually not how it is. The size of the L1 has been pretty constant for years and years. 20 years ago you might have seen 32 kB L1 cache per core, the last many years 64 kB L1 cache has been pretty standard.\nFor comparison the latest Mac Pro (desktop computer) with the most expensive CPU option (the Intel Xeon W-3265M 24 core CPU) also has a 64 kB L1 cache per core.\nJust increasing the size of the L1 cache won't really do you any good in terms of increasing overall performance. L1 cache is the most \"expensive\" type of cache in terms of the amount of physical space taken up on the die, and in terms of power usage. In addition, because it is even faster than TLB lookups, the extra benefit of a larger size quickly diminishes. In essence, you'll get more benefit from having a larger L2 or L3 cache than increasing the size of the L1 cache - and it's much \"cheaper\" to increase those.\nAll in all this seems to indicate that different L1 cache sizes isn't the deciding factor that determines that your computer is slow and others are fast.\nI could guess that perhaps a big difference lies in the fact that your old processor does not support the same \"number-crunching\" instruction sets as a new processor does. This small test example doesn't really show it, but from your links it appears that you're really doing some computations with vectors. Specialized CPU instructions exists that really benefit those types of computations - and I know that numpy can take advantage of at least some of them. Your current CPU only supports the older AVX instruction sets, whereas a new MacBook Air supports AVX2 in addition to SSE4.\nYou might for comparison's sake try disabling AVX2/SSE4 support in numpy on the fast machine and rerun the calculation to see if that accounts for the majority of the time difference.\n", "Q: Is OpenGL deprecated or removed in macOS Catalina 10.15? I've read that OpenGL was deprecated in macOS Mojave 10.14 in the favour of Metal, Apple's proprietary low-level graphics API. Has it been completely removed in macOS Catalina? glxinfo appears to be not installed.\nOpenGL is still supported in the latest iMac - supported versions\nIf it has been removed, is there a way to install it?\n\nA: It is still there and located at /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework but it seems glxinfo is missing\nSee comment on original question for information on installing glxinfo\n\nA: OpenGL is officially deprecated by Apple starting with macOS Mojave 10.14. However, Apple is still maintaining the standard.\n\n*\n\n*macOS 10.15 Catalina: The Ars Technica review\n\nOpenGL and OpenCL\nOpenGL and OpenCL were officially deprecated in Mojave last year, though that's a little misleading since it implies that Apple had been actively maintaining and updating its support for those standards. In Catalina, as in every macOS version going all the way back to Mavericks, the macOS OpenGL implementation is stuck at version 4.1 (2010), and the OpenCL version is stuck at 1.2 (2011). This means that apps that still rely on those APIs on macOS will continue to run, provided they've been updated to meet the 64-bit-only requirement. But you shouldn't be developing new Mac apps that rely on OpenGL or CL for anything important.\n\nThe situation can be misleading for OpenGL developers. But Apple is clearly hinting they will not support the technology moving forward in the future.\n", "Q: Double encryption when using encrypted Time Machine on MacOS Extended encrypted?

I would especially love an app where you could customize the percentage at which point the app will send a notification (for example, 80%). I looked at some battery apps I found on AppStore, but none of them had this feature. The reason I'd like to have this feature is I want to unplug the charger before the battery hits 100%. Or at the very least, know when I have hit 100%. I don't want to have the phone plugged any more than necessary since that will cause damage to the battery.\nI read that the optimal range (for the battery in the long run) would be somewhere around 70% and 80%, i.e. you would try to keep the battery percentage in that interval at all times. It would be easier to maintain this if my phone sent me a notification whenever I reached one of the two points, as I can't use all my time checking the battery.\nDoes such an app exist? \nEDIT: I don't have a MacBook. I'm looking for an app for iPhone.\n\nA: There is an app called Coconut Battery that does this but it is hardwired for certain values all less than 50%.  There is also a setting for number of minutes left. Load the app and go to Preferences under the coconutBattery menu item. This opens a panel and one option is Notifications.

Does it have something to do with the remaining lease time?\nIs there a way to create/assign a computer name for each interface?\n\nA: Names aren’t associated to adapters, it’s the hostname of the computer.\nWhy it’s the WiFi and not the LAN is basically which one got assigned first.\nYou only have one entry because, well, you can only have one.  Many routers have a mDNS service (usually attached to DHCP) that manages the resolution of host names to IP addresses.  This is a 1-to-1 relationship.  If you had one name pointing to two different IPs, your computer wouldn’t know where to go.\n", "Q: Is it possible to enroll Apple Developer program without ID verification? I tried to enroll Apple Developer Program with a different name, and I got an email that I should upload an ID to verify my identity. Is it possible to enroll without ID verification?\n\nA: In general, it seems to be a good idea that Apple is asking for your ID when you're trying to enroll with a different name than your own (I guess this is what you meant by a different name - unless you have two names somehow).\nI have never heard of Apple asking for an ID, and then just somehow agreeing to go without ID for no apparent reason. But you could ask Apple to be allowed to enroll without showing an ID - they are afterall the only ones that can determine if you can enroll without it.\nIf you have problems with the ID, you might consider creating a limited liability company and applying for the developer program with that. However, it is usually not possible to create such a company without identifying yourself.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (mid-2012) SSD Problems Ok a few months ago I bought a Macbook Pro 2012 and shortly afterwards I installed a Adata 512GB SSD.  I cloned my existing Mechanical drive to the new internal SSD and everything went fine for a few months.  My Mackbook Pro was booting up in about 11 secs and running like a pro.  Well a few weeks ago I started having problems.  Here are the following problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I close the laptop and put it to sleep it freezes when I wake it up and it becomes unresponsive to the point that I have to completely turn it off.\n\n*Sometimes when I have to power it on it has trouble finding the internal SSD and after a few minutes I get the blinking folder with the question mark.  This tells me it's having problems finding my SSD.  Sometimes I have to turn it off and back on a few times or do the clear NVRAM key combination inorder to get it booted up.  Once it's booted up it works just perfect.  but if I let it go to sleep then its back to problem 1 above.\n\n\nThis has become increasingly frustrating as my Macbook it used for editing pictures from my photography sessions and also editing videos.   And I have tried all the different solutions from the internet/google/forums.  Well the other night I decided to open it up and install my old mechanical drive back in it.  When I turned it on the it found the drive and booted right up.  I put it to sleep and it woke back up with no problem and it didn't freeze.  I also powered it off and back on a few times and it booted with no problem.\nIs it safe to assume that my Adata SSD is dying or could it be something else that's causing this problem?  I also did a erase and restore from a time machine backup and had the same results.\n\nA: I used to work at an Apple certified repair center and would definitely suspect the SSD. Things you could check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reseat the sata connector on the logic board side\n\n*Try a different sata cable\n\n*Try a different ssd\n\n*Put the ssd in a diffent machine and see what happens\n\n\nUnfortunately not everyone has multiple ssd, parts and machines to test with.

Anything at all?)\n\nA: Apple and third-party applications may have a variety of subsidiary files stored in /Library.\nMuch of it will be in /Library/Application Support.\nThird-party fonts may be in the Fonts subfolder. \nBut there may also be Dictionaries, Color Profiles, LaunchAgents, Privileged Helper Tools, system-wide Preferences (including network settings), printer drivers, QuickLook and Spotlight plug-ins, AppleScript Scripting Additions, Frameworks, and so much more, depending on what you've installed. Anything for which there's a named folder!\nMy advice is that you probably won't save much space on a backup disk by excluding /Library, and if something goes wrong, it's easier to restore one file or one folder than have to re-install a whole load of applications and the OS just to be sure.\n", "Q: Apple ID or password is incorrect when restoring purchases from another Apple ID I am having issues with trying to use software I purchased from the Mac App Store. I have two Apple IDs: one personal Apple ID that I've been using for years (an iCloud account) and a new Apple ID that was created when I set up my company-provided Macbook. The \"company\" Apple ID is associated with my work email, and is the primary Apple ID for my OS X user on my work laptop.\nI was using software on the work laptop which I had purchased under my personal Apple ID (because I had paid for it myself; my work Apple ID does not even have a payment method associated with it) and everything was fine until the App Store updated this application.\nAfter the automatic update, the application was back in \"free trial\" mode.

I'm 100% sure the password was correct.\n\n\nYour Apple ID or password is incorrect\n\nWhat's really odd is that *after I click Cancel_ I get a second dialog asking me t sign in, but this time it recognizes that I need to use a second Apple ID.\n\n\nSign in to use this application on this computer\n  \"App name\" was purchased using the app store on another computer.\n  To use \"app name\" on this computer, sign in using the Apple ID and\n  password used to purchase it.\n\nBut even after signing in (and yes, I am sure the Apple ID and password were typed correctly!) I still get (in red)\n\nYour Apple ID or password is incorrect\n\nI am using Mac OS X 10.15.2 Catalina. I have signed in and out of the App store using both Apple IDs and even added my personal Apple ID as an iCloud account on the work MacBook, but nothing seems to resolve this issue.\n\nA: Oddly enough, I was able to resolve this by deleting the application in the Finder (open Finder, Go > Applications menu item, select the App in question, drag to trash) and then allowing the App Store to re-download the application while signed in to my personal Apple ID. So it appears that somehow the Apple ID you are signed in to when you download software is stored or recorded with the actual application package directory inside /Applications, at least under 10.15.\n", "Q: Apple Remote Desktop over internet \"without\" port forwarding Is it possible using Apple Remote Desktop to connect to computers over the internet (so different networks) ** without ** having to tweak the router settings of those devices? \nPS currently using both Mojave and Catalina\n\nA: Unfortunately, not any more.

I'd like to apply a Ken Burns effect to all the stills without affecting the clips. Is there an easy way to select only the stills in the timeline?\n\n\nA: The fastest way I was able to find by fiddling with the UI is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new role called \"Stills\" in the menu bar under Modify > Edit Rolls...\n\n\n*Select everything (both clips and stills) in the main timeline.\n\n*Open the index, click the roles tab and uncheck \"Video\". That way all the stills turn gray and only the videos remain blue (since they contain audio with a role of \"Dialogue\").\n\n\n*That makes it easy to then manually deselect all the videos by holding command and clicking on them in the timeline.\n\n\n*Now, with only the stills selected, right click the selection and choose Assign Video Roles to assign the newly created \"Stills\" role.\n\n*Finally head back to the clips tab of the index, right click in the column header and make sure Video Roles is displayed. Then type \"stills\" in the search box. You can then cmd + a the resulting list to repeatedly select only the stills in the timeline.\n\n", "Q: Can I suppress the dot under an image caption in pages for macOS? When I use the media box to add a photo, I seem to be required to add a caption. Then under the caption, there is a gray dot. These dots show up in the image files I paste into Pages similar to this underline situation, but not the same.\n\nHow can I ditch the dot?  \n\nA: This issue occurs when you choose the \"Image Gallery\" option from one of two places either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Menu Bar > Insert > Image Gallery\n\n*Tool Bar > Media > Image Gallery \n\n\nThe dot underneath is used to support multiple images being in that box similar to an image gallery function on a website.\nThe reason that you do not see this when you copy and paste an image or drag one in is that it inserts the image as an image and not as a single image within an image gallery.\nThe solution is to delete the image gallery and insert the image into the Document by one of the following ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag and Drop from Finder onto the Pages Document\n\n*Copy and Paste the image\n\n*Menu Bar > Insert > Chose ... (Select file)\n\n*Tool Bar > Media > Chose ... (Select file)\n\n\nI have added an image to further illustrate this incase it was not clear.\n\n\nA: You can not remove the dot below a picture inserted via the Image Gallery. The Image Gallery is a special feature of Pages that allows many photographs or pictures to occupy the same space in a document and to be viewed only one a time. It is usually not the preferred way to place a single picture (or multiple pictures that are to be displayed separately) into a Pages document. See this short video if you wish to learn more about how to better use Image Gallery. \nHowever, you can avoid the dot under a picture inserted into a Pages document by adding it to the document without using the Image Gallery feature. \nClick on the Media option on the Pages toolbar at the top and click on Choose instead of Image Gallery. Then locate the image or photo and select it in the window that will appear and click on Insert. The photo or image will be added to your Pages document without the caption and the dot. Once added, you can move or resize the photo or image as you like. \nYou can add a caption yourself below (or above) the picture by adding and writing in a text box below or above the picture. You can add a text box by clicking on the Text option on the Pages Toolbar. To make sure the picture and the caption always appear together, first click on one of them and then press and hold the Command or the Shift button while clicking on the second one. Once both are selected, right click and choose Group.\nYou can also directly paste the photo or image to your Pages document without a caption and the accompanying dot by selecting and copying the file directly from inside a Finder app window after locating it in the Finder. You can again create a caption for the picture using the Text option.\n", "Q: Lightning to 3.5 mm adapters only for “iOS 10.2 and below” I’ve seen quite a few Lightning to 3.5 mm headphone jack adapters that only claim compatibility with iOS 10.2 or lower. I found that very strange, since I generally expect my adapters to keep working even after I update an OS. \nWhat does the iOS version have to do with a simple adapter like this? Does an obvious reason exist for why sellers make this claim?\n\nA: Apple has had a Made for iSomething (MFi) program since 2005, though initially it wasn't strictly enforced.\nAnecdotally, because I can't find any announcement, only user complaints - ref Reddit: [Request] Tweak to enable non Mfi chargers on ios 10.2 & others - with the introduction of iOS 10.2 the requirements became more stringent.\nMFi cables & devices require a certification chip in them, licensed from Apple, otherwise they will be rejected by the iDevice.\nThe implication for cables being sold as 'works up to iOS 10.2' is that these are inferior cables - they are certainly chipless.\nIt's probably impossible to determine at such remove whether they were of sufficient quality to become certified, but made before the chip became compulsory & are now simply old stock, or whether they are just cheap knock-offs that would never gain certification.\nCertification doesn't seem to be that difficult or expensive [It's been described as a 'tax', being a percentage of sale price] & I doubt anyone would even bother to make non-certified cables these days, as they would just be returned by any customer using a recent iOS.\nI found a good blog about it on HowToGeek: What Does Apple MFi-Certified Mean?\n\nA: Lightning to 3.5mm audio jack adapters are not iOS dependent...\nNo matter who makes them.\nThis is a hardware solution to go from a lightning port which has no audio signaling whatsoever, to an analog connector.\n. \nInside the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter is a DAC or digital audio converter that takes digital signals and converts them to analog signals.\n\nTL;DR\nWhat you’re seeing is marketing verbiage that doesn’t belong as this adapter is not tied to the OS.  That said, I cannot warn strenuously enough against getting knock off (uncertified) adapters because they’re cheaper than the original then plugging them into an iPhone or iPad that can cost upwards of $1,000USD\n", "Q: Now that disablelocal is gone, how to stop local (internal drive) TimeMachine backups?

Here are some limitations.\n\n\n*\n\n*If your device is activation locked, you can’t walk away from the old iCloud - you have to recover that account. You will need to prove to Apple using a rigorous process (they will not deviate from the script, some steps will take days) if you can’t provide the security questions, receive a secondary email or remember and enter the password.\n\n*If your new email is associated in any way with the old AppleID / old iCloud you can’t use it for a new account or even associate it with a new account.\n\n\nAssuming all of the above are OK, you would sign out of every iCloud using the old - all mac, PC, iPad, iPhone, iPod, Apple TV.

There's also a lot of opinion surrounding it, much of which doesn't come from sound engineers but from people who are chasing the wrong part of the rainbow ;)\nTo really simplify,  \n\n\n*\n\n*Lossless audio is that which can be uncompressed to produce exactly the same data that was originally encoded.\nYou need this if you are going to be further processing the audio.  \n\n*Lossy audio can be uncompressed to sound almost exactly as it was originally encoded.\nYou need this if you just want to listen to the audio.\n\n\nI'm not going to dig into any math in this, just skim lightly over the basics.\nThe difference in the two has become a matter of public perception, rather than hard fact & analytical data.\nVery few people on an A/B test can tell the difference, so they use tools which they don't understand to give them data that makes no real sense…\n[bear with me, I'm not being insulting, but some of the interweb wisdom on this is way off the mark].\nYou will often see pictures of spectrograms like this\n\nTelling you the one on the right is obviously lossy because it has a lower frequency cut-off. Well, yes, it does imply that, but it doesn't actually prove it, it is a false premise based on a misunderstanding. What it does prove is that it used a lower sampling frequency, causing a lower Nyquist limit & therefore a lower high frequency shelving limit in the resulting audio.\nIf you re-compressed the file on the right into a lossless format it would not magically regain the lost data & yet the file itself would now be completely lossless - but only insomuch as no further data would be lost. I think this is probably what the 'checker' apps are trying to test, but in quite a misleading way.\nGood lossy compression doesn't look 'truncated' like that on a spectrogram. It doesn't look any different to a lossless file - because the differences are far, far too small to show up on such a blunt tool as a spectrogram.\nThe whole point of lossy encoding is that it quite cleverly throws away the bits you can't hear anyway. That's its trick. The higher the bitrate, the less it has to throw out, which is why there is a noticeable difference between a 256kbps [or 320kbps] & a 128kbps file, if your speakers & ears are good enough. If you're going to be listening on earbuds from your phone, or in your car, then 9/10 people can't tell the difference between 128kbps & anything higher - the background noise will effectively bury the difference.\nYou can use a tool that will run the math on an uncompressed lossy file, but how it can decide if any data is missing from the end result without an original to compare to is completely beyond me. Maybe it looks at only the high frequencies, maybe the actual cut off…\nI'm going to pick on one of these received wisdom audio checker sites & pick some holes in it… the poor guy probably doesn't deserve being singled out, but he covers the same tired, misinformed ground that many of them do…\nFrom: Audio Checker – Check the True Quality of Your Audio Files\nIn reference to the above spectrograph…\n\nkHz, a measurement of frequency that greatly affects sound quality, will be displayed on the left. In theory, bitrates work with frequency and higher bitrates preserve higher frequencies, which result in better sound quality. \n\n✔️correct, though things get less confusing if you use the term 'sampling frequency' rather than bit-rate. Bit-rate is really a transmission 'speed' not an accurate gauge of the actual sampling frequency. Only lossy compression formats really have anything to do with bitrates. Completely lossless, uncompress PCM such as WAV of AIF have only a sampling frequency [& bit-depth].\nSee Presonus: Digital Audio Basics: Sample Rate and Bit Depth  for some further info.\n\nLossless FLAC files don’t lose any of their higher frequencies as the left chart shows, yet lossy audio files don’t have higher frequencies \n\n❌ false premise. Lossy files can have just as much high frequency information as lossless - it's based on sampling frequency & Nyquist, as explained above.\n\ndetects upscaling, upsampling and transcoding.\n\n✔️ Ahh… so that's how it does it. It checks to see if someone has cheated by taking a low-grade file & changed the transcoding parameters to make it seem better. All those methods will produce data areas with either 'gaps' or doubled data, which certainly prove the file has been messed with at some point, probably in an attempt to deceive.  \n❌ What it completely & utterly fails to do is test that a file can be uncompressed to give exactly the same data as when it left the 'factory'. It has nothing to compare to.\nOK, let's move away from there & back to your results…  \n\nCDDA with probability of 94%.\n\nWell, that's fine if you consider CDDA [16-bit 44.1kHz PCM] to be the pinnacle of audio storage. It hasn't been in probably a decade or so. [Also bear in mind your checker came to that conclusion with absolutely no reference to the original file at all, it's just a guess].\nBack in the days everybody had CD players, from the mid-80s onwards, then CDDA was the pinnacle of consumer audio storage - once we'd got over the argument about vinyl, which I'm going to ignore entirely for this exercise.\nSince Apple moved to DRM-free AAC in the mid 2000's & introduced iTunes Plus, record companies started to upload their original audio masters to iTunes at 24-bit rather than 16-bit. This coincides with computers getting fast enough that recording studios could start to use higher frequencies in the original recordings - these days going up as far as 24 or even 32-bit 192kHz before downsampling to deliver to the consumer. In a pure numbers game, that's more numbers & it's 'real' because it hasn't been through any process since it left the recording studio/mastering suite. That's the most accurate source available to anyone outside the studio.\nBy the time this has been encoded to AAC at 256 or even 320kbps, the result is actually better than CDDA…\n…& that's where the argument for lossless finally falls down.\nUnless the record companies release lossless data at those sample/bit rates, [which did happen with the recent Beatles remasters, only available on USB stick] the 'best' source to the consumer is the AAC.. which was already lossy, but pretty much invisibly lossy.\n", "Q: Change content's default language in MacOS TV app I'm trying to find a way to set English (my system language is French) as the default audio language for Apple TV+ content.\nOn an Apple TV you can set that in the system's settings.\nOn MacOS, you can change the language from the player itself but it will not be remembered for the next episode.

Guest hardware device is a virtual hardware device presented in the guest. The model was introduced to QEMU audio since 4.2.\nIn the command line you specified Core Audio as host backend, but no hardware device was added, that's why you don't see it in the guest.

Unfortunately every recovery tool I tried gave the same error and denied work in the middle of the process.\nI discovered a windows tool called \"no erase ipsw\", that modifies ipsws up to version 10.3.3 in that way, that it makes the installer think that it does a complete new install, although it replaces only the system files and lets the user files untouched. Unfortunately is the resulting ipsw not accepted by iTunes, because it is \"unsigned\", let's say too old for Apples authentication process. \nMy only hope as far as I see now is to make iTunes think, it is a new ipsw.\nSecond possibility would be to modify a new / signed ipsw in that manner, that it becomes smaller than the original to save installer space, because the iPhone is over full.\nCan anybody out there give a hint? \n\nA: In iTunes hold down shift. A window should come up asking you to select your file. Try selecting it from there.\n", "Q: How to get quicklook working for Microsoft Office files On macOS 10.14.6 and MS Office 16.32 (latest version), quicklook previews only show the icon for .doc and .docx files.\nI have checked qlmanage, and cleared its cache:\n~ qlmanage -r cache\nqlmanage: call reset on cache\n~ qlmanage -r\nqlmanage: resetting quicklookd\n~ qlmanage -m | grep microsoft\n  com.microsoft.powerpoint.pot -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Office.qlgenerator (39 - loaded)\n  com.microsoft.word.doc -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Office.qlgenerator (39 - loaded)\n  com.microsoft.word.dot -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Office.qlgenerator (39 - loaded)\n  ...\n\nBut still no joy.

If you have a good backup, I would perform another erase install (or the first erase install if you just reinstalled the OS. Apple doesn’t define a factory reset, so we have no clue what that means unless you reference a written process you performed).\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nWhat makes an erase install is step 2 - format the disk. Your disk wasn’t formatted correctly. Specifically which of your disk1s1 and disk1s5 contains your user data is in question. You should only have one Macintosh HD - Data per Catalina system volume and not two.\n\nA: To troubleshoot this, here are the questions I’d ask:\nWhat partition is it booting from? If your booting from disk1s6 it's no wonder it giving you the message as it's only 10.9GB in size and the OS will easily fill that up with updates and other stuff. \nAlso, define \"restoring to factory settings\" as this could mean different things. Did you erase the partition that your OS is installed on and reinstalled Catalina on it? \n", "Q: Anyone know what libChineseTokenizer.dylib is?

Apps have to ask formally for this entitlement in code, so Wacom needs to ship a fix so their application or driver asks for permission. \nThey are also correct for some people, once permission has been granted to software that asked properly, you can drag and drop, but that is either a bug or not how newer Apple software works. \nUntil it’s clear, update your Apple software if you feel the drag and drop is a bug that Apple will fix.

Keeps happening for two weeks now and I can't pinpoint what is causing it. But if I leave computer for a while It would be frozen when I'm back. Seem you have tried almost everything without success. \n\nA: I have exactly the same problem, with my A1398. Thank you for the great description of the problem!\nThis is what I have found out so far:\n\n*\n\n*When I unplug the battery inside the computer, it will run using the\npower connector without any problems.\n\n*When I replaced the battery the problem was gone for a while. In my case for about 6 months, when using a non-branded replacement accumulator.\n\n*The freezes become much more frequent when I attach external devices which consume power (a USB HDD, which is powered by USB)\n\nThis is what I think:\n\n*\n\n*It's most likely a power problem. Older computers worked well with either the battery or the power adapter. But in modern laptops both is required for normal operation. The more powerfull resource is the battery - it acts as a buffer between the computer and the power adapter in case of current spikes. Allmost all laptops nowadays will go into a power saving mode (slow down) when you remove the battery. This is to protect the circuit from low voltage problems in case of power spikes.\n\n\n*A malfunction of the battery could cause low voltage problems whenever the computer drains high current. Low voltage problems can cause CPU freezing. When I unplug the internal battery the power saving mode is activated (the whole MBP feels about 10 times slower) which prevents the CPU from high current usage.\nStill the question is what causes this troubles. In my opinion it could be aged Tantal capacitors in one of the many step-up/down converters on the board. I am currently meassuring the ripple of the voltage at all Tantal capacitors (AC to ground).\n", "Q: How to delete APFS Volume I am trying to delete a volume and have one whole disk left, without volumes or partitions.

An obvious use case would be charging an iPhone from a MacBook. Charging cannot be done through the USB-to-Lightning adapter (at least Apple's).\n\n*A Lightning hub that can plug into a MacBook and offers several (at least 2, ideally 3 or more) female Lightning ports.\n\n\nAm I missing something, or do these devices not exist? If so, is there a reason they don't?\nEdit: It seems I missed the obvious fact that the female ports on modern MacBook Pros are in fact USB-C! Yes, I'm an idiot. They're roughly the same size/shape as Lightning ports, but equally quite different. Now, USB-C-to-lightning cables do of course exist, though I'm curious why the USB-C-to-USB-A adapter that I have (with the ordinary USB-A-to-Lightning cable plugged into it) is incapable of charging the iPhone. A limitation of the adapter to data-only only, perhaps? Anyway, I think my second bullet point still stands: I can't find any hubs that offer Lightning ports (at least one charge port) and have a male USB-C cable to plug into the MacBook.\n\nA: \nAm I missing something, or do these devices not exist?\n\nThey exist...\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/HKKP2ZM/A/belkin-lightning-audio-charge-rockstar\n\nIf so, is there a reason they don't?\n\nThey certainly are not popular.  That's because there are few use cases for them.  The Apple iDevices with a Lightning port are not built to handle more than one device at a time.  The Belkin Rockstar only allows a specific pairing of devices, one that provides power input and another that has audio output.  It is in effect emulating a specific kind of peripheral to the iDevice, an audio sink and power source which is a common style of an iPod dock.\n\nI'm curious why the USB-C-to-USB-A adapter that I have (with the ordinary USB-A-to-Lightning cable plugged into it) is incapable of charging the iPhone.\n\nThat sounds like a hardware issue to me.\nPerhaps you are merely concerned that the time it takes to charge is not what you hoped.  Apple computers source only 15 watts from their USB-C ports, and depending on the cable and other factors the computer may source far less power.  That could appear like it's not charging for someone used to a 30 watt or larger charger.\n\nAnyway, I think my second bullet point still stands: I can't find any hubs that offer Lightning ports (at least one charge port) and have a male USB-C cable to plug into the MacBook.\n\nThis is a very narrow use case.  Any Apple computer should be able to provide 12 watts of power to the phone while plugged in with a USB-C cable, it's not 15 watts because every USB-C cable I've seen will use the old USB 2.0 protocol for data and power negotiation with a computer.  The people that will want or need more power than that are few.  The iDevice models that can sink more than 15 watts of power is also few.  Creating a Lightning hub (or whatever such a thing might be called) would be complicated as it would have to \"know\" which port it is supposed to draw power from.  Adding logic to gauge which port can source more power would be complicated, and labelling one port \"data only\" and the other \"power only\" is likely to confuse and frustrate people.\nThere are Lightning \"hubs\" much like you describe but only to provide a specific function, that being for sourcing power and sinking audio.  The market for a \"hub\" that does more than this is small and the complexity, and therefore cost, of them likely high.\n", "Q: How to remove all cell formatting How can all formatting be removed from a sheet in Numbers so each cell only contains the text, with links no longer clickable?\n\nA: If you just want to remove hyperlinks, this post (the first result of this Google search) should help.

Here is how my program looks in Automator:\n\nThe problem I am having is sometimes where the program runs I get this error:\n\nThe program does work so I don't know why this error is popping up. Is there an Automator or AppleScript command that I can use to bypass this error so it does not show up at all?\n\nThis is the AppleScript:\ndelay 5\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    try\n        delete (every item of folder \"TV Show Downloads\" of disk \"Drobo\" whose modification date is less than ((get current date) - 1 * days))\n    end try\nend tell\n\n\nA: I suspect you may be getting this error because you are trashing folders and files in the same action. In other words, if automator tossed out a folder containing a '.mov' file, it will toss out the '.mov' file as well; then (later) when automator tries to toss that '.mov' file, it cannot find it, because it's already in the trash.\nFirst solution to try: move the kind is folder option to the bottom of the list, in the hopes it sorts folders last. \nIf that doesn't work, then you may need to complexify your workflow with a variable, like so:\n\n\nA: A common Automator error is to just get items, forgetting to remove an action added for testing, or that an application or service can already have items passed to the workflow.  This can result in extra or duplicate input items - for example a Filter Finder Items action will apply the filters to the current workflow items, while a Find Finder Items will apply the filters to items from the specified source, adding them to the workflow items.\nYour error is most likely from doubling up some of the file references.  The application will already get items passed to it automatically (the items dropped onto it), and those are being added to the items returned from the Find Finder Items action, resulting in the workflow trying to trash items that have already been moved to the trash.\nAutomator doesn't have any control or conditional actions, so if you are running an application without the intention of dropping items onto it, each action has an Ignore Input option that will prevent the usage of any items passed to it.  By using this option on the initial Find Finder Items action, you won't have to worry about anything extra being added from dropping items onto the application.\nIf what you are wanting to do is make sure you haven't accidentally grouped something in with the items you are wanting to trash, using the Filter Finder Items action instead of Find Finder Items will perform the filters on the items passed to the workflow without getting any others.\n", "Q: WiFi connecting problem in 5GHz networks I have a 2017 13” MacBook Pro Retina, model A1407,  which doesn't even show my 5GHz WiFi connection.

When attempting to check the service and support coverage status, I am presented with a webpage that says that the product’s purchase date can not be validated. I am asked to provide a date of purchase.\n\nThis is a custom configuration and the unit actually got shipped over a couple weeks after originally placing the order. As I understand, this date would be used for 1-year warranty coverage, my question is:\nWhat's the valid date of purchase that I should provide here:\n\n\n*\n\n*The date of placing the order?\n\n*The date of actually receiving the shipment from Apple?\nI want to make sure that I receive the full 1-year long warranty coverage (as promised by Apple).\n\nA: What’s the harm in providing the evidence you have that’s best for you?\nApple typically starts the warranty when you complete the purchase and the authorized seller ships the device. That’s when you “bought it” and you control the shipping costs and times in reality, not Apple.\nAlso, don’t worry about a day or two. If you have issues at the end of the warranty you can arrange service on the last day and then ship it - get another 90 days coverage and even if you present your device a week after expiration, my experience is Apple covers these days / week periods in your favor anyhow.\n\nThis form pops up when the date Apple thinks it sold it is too far in the past. If this left the factory recently, this form just starts your coverage today, so already Apple is a little cautious so I wouldn’t put a date here that you don’t have evidence to corroborate in case when you list the receipt date, they ask you to upload a scan of the delivery confirmation.\nUnless your local law says warranty starts when you receive the gear, the proper transfer of warranty starts when you pay for the goods, not when you receive them.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. Kept writing in the date when I purchased the MacBook Pro 16\". Which, to be fair, is what the page is asking for.\nBut that's not what they want to know\nWhen I changed to the date the package actually arrived, which was 2 months later (thanks, Corona virus) it suddenly worked like a charm.\nWhich begs two questions: \n1.

I haven't installed it\nOS: 10.15.2 Catalina\nIf so. Is it safe to remove by command line?\n\n\nA: OpenPort is a program used to create a tunnel from your machine to the Internet. Essentially allowing your, or others that are given access, to connect to your machine from the Internet to remote control it, copy files, etc.\nIt is normally used in situations where the machine cannot be placed directly on the Internet. For example in home user setups your machine can be stuck behind NAT, home firewalls, etc. that makes it difficult to access it from the Internet. OpenPort connects from your machine to a server to create a tunnel that will easier connection from the Internet.\nYou pay a monthly subscription for the server service for OpenPort, although they have a limited, free plan as well.\nIf you haven't knowingly installed OpenPort.io, I would uninstall right away. It is safe to remove in as so far that it doesn't come standard with the Mac, so it is an optional extra.

In attempts to solve my file sharing issues I have at some point on macOS Mojave + Server, using Directory Utility, bound the Open Directory server to itself using Directory Utility (I was quite desperate). Now, with all the changes I made I was able to get the client machine use authenticated binding to the server machine and now SMB file sharing works. So far so good, but I cannot change the passwords of users anymore. When I try, I get the following error:\nexisting connection is not authenticated and the old password is not present: password change denied\nDNS is ok. What I can find is that in the past one could 'rekerberize' the server but that information is old (Mavericks) so I don't want to try.\nI was looking at removing the local authenticated binding on macOS Mojave Server. But in Directory Utility that is greyed out. And I do not dare to remove/recreate the LDAP server with Directory Utility on a production server yet (very scared).\n\nA: While trying to get this done I accidentally found a way to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the server, in Directory Utility, in Services/LDAPv3 I tried to\nadd another copy of the local server (127.0.0.1). The same name was\nnot accepted so I went manual, created it with the name localhost\nThis was created, but then it turned out that it had overwritten the\nprevious OD. All my users, everything was gone. Panic.\n\n*I stopped OD in Server.app\n\n*Ran \"sudo slapconfig -destroyldapserver\" in Terminal\n\n*Ran \"sudo slapconfig -restoredb 20200112-albus-odbackup.sparseimage\"\n(I did make a backup before I went mucking about)\n\n\nMy OD is now up and running again, the users are back it took Server.app a while to sync with reality) and the authenticated binding between the server and itself is gone. /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1 only shows one computer, so I'll need to reauthenticate the client machine.\nProbably not the way to do it and certainly not for the faint of heart.\n", "Q: How to tell the mode (Transparency, noise cancellation or none) of airpod pro when it connects to the Apple TV? I can connect the audio of my AppleTV to my Airpod Pro.\nHowever there is no obvious which mode the Airpod Pro are in from the Apple TV user interface.\nI tried to use Siri to find it out, but it only says I can use the remote to control volume.\nIs there any way I can find it out, other than playing music loudly from another source so I can tell by taking off the ear bud?\n\nA: Since the AirPods don’t have a mode until they are in your ears there’s no mode before you have them live. \nOnce they are live that data isn’t exposed on AppleTV. I would recommend using the switch control on your AirPods to cycle the mode until you know what mode they are in by listening. \n", "Q: Is there a good email app with text-to-speech for iPhone? I cannot read small text due to eyesight deterioration and want an app that can read email out loud. Is there anything good that has text to speech and possibly also dictation of emails?\n\nA: \nSpeak Screen\nFrom email to books, let your iPhone read to you. If you\nhave a hard time reading the text on your iPhone, use Speak Screen to\nread your email, iMessages, web pages, and books. Turn on Speak Screen\nand swipe down from the top of the screen with two fingers, or just\ntell Siri to Speak Screen and have all the content on the page read\nback to you. You can adjust the voice’s dialect and speaking rate, and\nhave words, sentences, or words within sentences highlighted as\nthey’re being read. And the new Speech Controller provides a Speak\nUnder Finger feature for more precise control.\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/vision/\nFrom the Home screen, go to Settings → General → Accessibility → Speech → Speak Screen. Or simply search using the search bar in Settings. To read screen, imagine bringing down notification centre, but with two fingers.\nFor single words: select them, and find \"Speak\" in the tooltip options that appear.\nRSS reader for iPhone with text-to-speech support?\n\nA: I tried Speaking Email (speaking email website link) and am finding it really great. It's a one by one email reader which keeps it nice and simple. It has commands like \"delete\", \"reply\" and so on which are voice commands, a nice idea - really powerful and no need to wear your eyes out peering at a screen. \nThe reply dictation works well. It is best for reasonably short emails. Although it works much better than Siri, which seemed to only get about half a sentence before thinking I am finished - whereas Speaking Email keeps the dictation going and only stops after something like 10 seconds, when you really are finished.\nPS. I am answering my own question because I got this answer on Quora and thought I should share it here, since I found the app works great (my personal experience). Just in case anyone has the same question (hope that is the right thing to do here!)\n", "Q: Delete Duplicate Users Folder Catalina Due to issues while upgrading to Catalina a duplicate users folder was created on my system. This folder is named \"Users 1\" and is ~85gb. I tried deleting it using sudo rm -rf \"Users 1\" but get Read-only file system. How do I get around this security measure to delete the folder?\n\nA: Went to the genius bar and the genius booted from an external volume and was able to see both Catalina partitions as volumes. From here it was as simple as moving the \"Users 1\" folder to the trash and emptying the trash. This can most likely be accomplish through target disk mode as well.\n", "Q: What does \"Add to Library\" and \"Remove from Library\" mean in Podcasts? They're just podcasts. Episodes should be either downloaded or not downloaded, and podcasts should be either subscribed to not subscribed. But it seems an episode can be \"in your library\" without being downloaded, and a podcast can be \"in your library\" without being subscribed. What does that even mean?\n(I'm referring to Podcasts on both Mac OS and iOS.)\n\nA: \nIf you stop listening to a show for a while, Apple Podcasts might pause your subscription. The shows and downloaded episodes stay in your library, but new episodes might not be updated. To continue getting new episodes, subscribe again.\n\nand \n\nNew episodes won't download to your device, but episodes that are already in your library won’t be deleted.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201859#more\nTo me, this looks like a sweet spot with a collection of all relevant material, since you can search in your library separately(not globally) and it is synced across devices. \nAlso, not verified, but autoplay might be using library too. \n\nA: I believe it acts as merely a 'tag' so that when you are in your 'Library' they are collated in a single place. Episodes that are 'added to the  library' aren't necessarily downloaded, but are located in a supposedly easy to reach, single location - 'The Library'. It is confusing and I personally never use My Library - going straight to the podcast depending on what I want to listen to. \nIf you want 'episodes' recurringly or automatically downloaded, the podcasts (not the episodes)  do have to be in your Library first it would seem. Then you are able to apply general rules like 'Download only new episodes' or 'Download all episodes from this subscription from the very first episode' (via the app settings found in the General Settings>Podcasts section).\nNot that this justifies the existence of a 'library', and Apple have yet again made simple matter complex. Even after a fair bit of research and in-depth look at their user manuals, which didn't help at all, I have only managed to formulated my own opinion - which was mostly thru trial and error anyway. \n", "Q: Gmail Doesn't Respect Dark Mode System Preference on iOS 13 Given Dark Mode can really enhance battery life, I'm keen to implement it.\nAlthough all my other IOS/IPADOS 13.3 Apps seem to respect the \"System Preferences\" > \"Display & Brightness\" > \"Appearance\" > \"Dark\", I noticed gMail didn't for some reason.\nGoogle offered this guidance for configuring Dark Mode:\n\nFor iOS 13: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*On your iPhone or iPad, open the Gmail app \n  \n*In the top left, tap Menu Menu  and then Settings. \n  \n*Tap Theme. \n  \n*Choose Light, Dark or System default.\n  \n\nSince the menu item \"Theme\" was missing in my gMail settings, I gave up trying to configure Dark Mode- wasn't possible to follow the instructions to achieve a correct result.  \nMy gMail settings look as follows:\n\nBy chance I noticed my Wife was using Dark Mode in gMail.  Given we have the same iPad Pros (2019 12.9\"), I decided to try to implement Dark Mode again.\nDoing some comparative analysis, I investigated how our iPad configurations varied. \nBelow are my Wife's gMail settings. When you compare the below graphic of her correct settings with mine in the previous graphic, remark (2) things:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is now a menu item titled \"Theme\" which is not present in my settings\n\n*Version Number: Both the Broken AND Working Dark Modes use same gMail version\n\nHow else did the two iPads vary?\n\n\n*\n\n*My iPad uses both gSuite and a personal gMail accounts\n\n*My Wife's iPad only has a personal gMail account.\nRemarking this difference, I made the following changes to my iPad to mirror the working iPad (my Wife's):\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleted the gSuite gMail account to exclude possibility there was a Domain permissions issue.  This did not resolve the broken Dark Mode issue\n\n*Deleted and reinstalled gMail itself.  This too failed to resolve the fault\nSo both iPad Pro's use the same versions of gMail, but the iPad with working Dark Mode HAS the \"Theme\" menu in settings, the other with broken Dark Mode does NOT.\n\nA: UPDATE:\nWas surprised to see Dark Mode magically working on my iPhone's gMail. I had not fiddled with anything lately, but voila, there it was. However, when I checked my iPads, these did NOT have Dark Mode enabled. Checked the versions on the iPads and these had the same one as the iPhone: v.6.0.200412.  So what was different?  I rebooted the iPhone recently, but NOT my iPads.\nUpon reboot of the iPads, Dark Mode was now working on gMail on all my devices.\nHow to get Dark Mode working: (3) Steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Dark Mode as the system-wide preference in: \"System Preferences\" > \"Display & Brightness\" > \"Appearance\" > \"Dark\"\n\n*As @Lulucmy rightly noted in his answer, Google must enable the feature on their side or Dark Mode ain't happening for you.\n\n*Reboot the device periodically: Google will not notify you they are enabling Dark Mode. I had periodically closed gMail from time to time since I last updated it 01 May, and Dark Mode was still not working in gMail.  Only when I rebooted my iPhone did the change seem to be effective. \n\n\nSo Dark Mode will respect the global System Preference, but only where Google has enabled it on their side. So I guess patience is also required for those eager to extend their battery life using gMail in Dark Mode.\nAnyhoo, my observations on how my own Dark Mode Hell was resolved.  Hope this saves others cycles trying to resolve the issue-\n\nA: The dark mode deployment in Gmail started in September 2019, and as Google states it on the G Suite Updates Blog \"To optimize the user experience, we're rolling it out slowly, and will post an update here when that rollout is complete.\" It is linked to your Gmail account and until Google activates it for you, you won't be able to see it.\nI had the same problem and adding my second Gmail account solved it. You should try to temporarily login with your wife's Gmail account on your iPad and activate the Dark Mode.\n\nA: Google confirmed some time back, this is a server side configuration. If you are not seeing the option, its not rolled out to you yet. Though I don’t know the reason why it has been done. My case is the same.\n", "Q: is there a way to delete all the photos shared to my iPad from my iPhone (done through iCloud), but keep all my original iPad photos? So I just turned on iCloud photos for my iPhone and it shared all my iPhone photos to my iPad camera roll, and I don't want all those photos there, and I don't want the photos from my iPad on my iPhone either.\nis there a way to put it back to the way it was without turning off iCloud?\n\nA: This is trivial to do from the Mac version of Photos. I don’t know of a way to set it up on the iPad or iPhone, but once you have your smart Album, it’s easy to delete all the photos that match the criteria selected for that album. Note, this smart album syncs to your iPad and iPhone so you can take action there in addition to Mac photos. \nOn the mac, once you have your Photos library established (you don’t need the originals - you can optimize storage on the Mac if you prefer) - use the new smart album control and specify all photos taken from iPhone (or you can even select which lens, which model of iPhone, front or back camera, etc..)\n\nUnless you have an import in the albums that contains all the photos you wish to eliminate, go for the computer to do the large curation / collections and deletions.\nSmart albums are my secret photos power, list files not uploaded to iCloud to find errors, list pictures in date ranges or other specifics. Metadata is the key to unlock all sorts of awesome on MacOS and soon iOS with the new scripting being introduced there. \n", "Q: Splitting shared Apple ID While similar to some questions, I think my question has some unique differences.  \nMy family (mult iphones and iPads) with 6 people.  We have been sharing a single apple ID as we started before the family plan was available.  \nFinally time to split out.  We are setting up a new iphone 11.  \n\n\n*\n\n*I believe that the apps will still be shared as long as the new phone has a new apple ID connected to the family plan. (correct?) \n\n*But concerned about contacts, calendar, etc.  How can I properly get this  data over?\nOne thing I've considered is backing up the current phone, installing as is on the new phone with the shared apple ID - and then changing Apple ID on the new phone - but concerned that will then end up with problems.\nAny advice from the community how to handle this?  \n\nA: *\n\n*Apps:\nAll Apps that are eligible for family sharing will be available on a new AppleID that is added to Family Sharing.\nKeep in mind that In-App purchases are not shared. More detailed info is available in the Apple Support Article.\n\n*A desktop computer (preferably a Mac) would probably be the easiest way to properly distribute the content. Set up both the new and old AppleID and then use the appropriate Apps to move/copy the calendars/events/contacts/...\n", "Q: Where are my phone's apps stored on my Mac? A long time ago, when iTunes backed up my iPhone to my Mac, I could then search my Mac and find all the individual app files inside a subfolder of the \"iTunes\" folder in my \"Music\" folder.\nBut that was then and this is 2019 and I can't see anywhere that these individual files are accessible.\nCan they still be found, and if so, where?\n\nA: Apple doesn’t delete the files out of the iTunes library so if you had old apps they are where they were. Going forward, no apps get saved so there is no new place, just the old one waiting for bit rot to set in or for you to delete your no longer used files. \n", "Q: Add colours to output of existing CLI commands I would like to create a function / alias that colorizes the output of another command. Is there a best-practice way to do so?\nFor instance, let's take the alias command, whose output looks something like this:\n\nIn the standard bash/zsh, this is all in the same colour. However, I'd like to adjust the output so that the part before the alias itself (the part before the =) is green, and the aliased command (the part after =) is red, for instance.\nObviously, alias is just an example, as I would like to add colours to other commands. \nMy current solution uses awk:\nalias | awk -F\"=\" '{print \"\\033[1;32m\" $1 \"\\033[0m=\\033[1;31m\"$2\"\\033[0m \"}'\n\n\nI don't find it particularly appealing (especially the colour codes). It also appears that this approach will become much more complicated for more complex commands (e.g. add colour output to top or ps) and also does not seem very maintainable in the long run.\nAny ideas on how to make this better / easier ?\nPS: I guess this is a Unix/Linux terminal question in general, but since I work primarily on OS X, I decided to start asking here...\n\nEDIT: I now found this answer, that proposes using functions to make awk output look prettier. I'm not sure though if I want to have lots of formatting functions ghosting around my terminal. Still hoping for something cleaner...\nHere's their example:\nfunction red(s) {\n    printf \"\\033[1;31m\" s \"\\033[0m \"\n}\n\nfunction green(s) {\n    printf \"\\033[1;32m\" s \"\\033[0m \"\n}\n\n{\n    print red($1), green($2), blue($3)\n}\n\n\nA: Especially since you're already using zsh, I would recommend using the existing highlighter framework (and builtin highlighters) of zsh-syntax-highlighting or fast-syntax-highlighting Based on a preliminary review, both should have sufficient documentation to hopefully allow you to set up your preferred environment.\nHere's a screenshot of zsh-syntax-highlighting's default parser operating on the parsing command you provided (meta, right?)\n\n", "Q: Has my iphone 5 been hacked? \n*\n\n*I've recently noticed that my devices battery life and data limit has been draining at a higher rate than normal.  \n\n*Furthermore, upon a little further investigation, it seems a number of photos have been deleted that I do not remember removing.\n\n*I also noticed a disney plus profile added to my keychain (a service I do not use). \n\n*I pulled the logs multiple times and did not see the lines I'm interested in occurring during the first few attempts.

Then reboot.\nIn my case, I found Logi Options and Logi Options Daemon in Accessibility.\nClick the lock icon\nEnter admin password\nSelect the app to remove\nClick the minus sign (-) button\nRepeat for other related apps\nReboot\nNow, when you log back into macOS, you will be prompted to allow the new permissions. This should add the app to Input Monitoring.\n\n\nA: Open Activity Monitor and stop Logi Options Daemon. This will restart it.\n\nA: For me it happened a single time and I just put the macbook to sleep and wake it up again. The options setting come back!\n[Update] Today it happens again and the sleep-and-wake-up doesn't work this time. I switched off the mouse and switched on again, and the options are back!\n[Final Update] The ultimate solution to this is switch off your laptop once every week. It is a headache and it is not a headache...\n\nA: Open a new terminal and write:\nkill $(ps aux | grep LogiMgrDaemon.app | awk 'FNR == 1 {print $2}')\n\nThis command search the PID of the Logi Options Daemon and kill it's execution, next automatically the daemon will restart and restore the normal behavior.\n\nA: I have been using a M557 for the last ~ 2 year gem of a mouse never an issue. I bought a M590 yesterday (multi device silent mouse). This mouse has the exact same problem you guys explained above. Tried a bunch of options didn't work. As someone suggested above, opening logitech options s/w solves the issue, but do not want to keep doing it. I raised a ticket with logitech. \nThinking if i should return this mouse!!\n\nA: The only stable solution that I found is using Scroll Reverser.\nhttps://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/\nThere are no problems using it together with Logi Options.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. Disabling the application specific settings solved the problem for me. I know it's not a real solution, but it might help someone.\n\nA: I haven't tried all of the suggested solutions, but a quick workaround would be to restart your Mac. Also, ensure that the Logi Options app is in the System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Input Monitoring\nThe issue happened when I remove the mouse from Bluetooth, and reconnected.\n\nA: This works for me:\nkillall LogiMgrDaemon\n\nI need to run this command regularly, especially after the MacBook wakes up from sleep, even briefly, but sometimes even just randomly while using it\nI sure hope they fix it!\nmacOS Monterey 12.0.1\nLogitech Options 9.50.122\n\nA: I found a temporary solution!\nAs mentioned in 7ynk3r answer, if you kill the \"Logi Options Daemon\" process it'll start again and everything will be fine.\nTo avoid doing this all the time I installed SleepWatcher. This command-line tools enables you to run scripts on wake and/or on sleep. So you can create a script to kill \"Logi Options Daemon\" process on every wake.\nIf you guys want a detailed guide about this, please comment.\n\nA: For me, just locking the screen and logging in again fixed the not loading options bug. Might try it the next time it occurs.\n\nA: I am facing the same issue. \nMy solution was to use bash to stop & start the LogiMgrDaemon process. \nI created a bash script called restart_logi.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Kill Logitech Manager Daemon\nps aux| grep  'LogiMgrDaemo[n]'|  awk '{print $2}'| xargs kill\n\n# Start Logitech Manager Daemon\n/Applications/LogiMgrDaemon.app/Contents/MacOS/LogiMgrDaemon\n\nThis script can be run by making the file \"executable\" first:\nchmod +x restart_logi.sh\n\nthen calling script like this(you have to be in same directory as script):\n./restart_logi.sh\n\nI could have just killed the service and clicked on one of the mouse buttons to trigger the LogiMgrDaemon service to begin, however I found this to be glitchy, \nso in my script I started the service by explicitly starting the app.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of Google Duo icon in Menu bar? I just tried to download a bunch of different video apps to see which works best in my country and now I'm stuck with this one at the top. When I click on it, the screen shot shows what comes up. How do I remove it?\n\n\nA: Install Google Duo, go to its settings, disable menu item, uninstall. \nHold command while dragging out the icon from the Menu bar. \n", "Q: How to enable Huawei Health app options for iOS that exist for Android? I bought a Huawei Band 3 Pro some months back, and while using it with my Android phone, all the things I needed were working (using the Android Huawei Health app). \nBut lately, I switched to an iPhone 11 pro, and thus using the iOS version of that app. And it seems that the iOS app lacks in various aspects. But maybe I just didn't find the right place to configure it correctly. \nWhat is missing for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*With Android, I could enable \"notifications\" that go to the band per source. Meaning: I would first enable notifications in general, and then I could select \"I want calendar events and phone calls, but I don't want facebook or WhatsApp\". With iOS: I only found \"notifications\" that can be enabled. And now I get calendar events, phone calls, facebook, whatsapp ... just a lot of things I really don't want to be notified about. Question: is there a way to configure individual sources for notifications?\n\n*Beyond that, the band knows various forms of exercises. Like indoor cycling. Which ... the Huawei health app doesn't show me at all. With Android, I could see past trainings, for all the exercises that the band offers. With iOS, there is only steps, heartbeat, sleep ... and 3 outdoor (GPS based) activities. Question: is there a way to access these \"missing\" activities, like training data for indoor cycling?\n\n\nA: I can't say if I just overlooked that, or if a newer version of the health app improved things: I can now see the my indoor cycling activities, too. They show up in the overview of outdoor cycling. Unfortunately, that overview only sums up distances, so the time spent on the indoor device don't count.  But at least, they all show up.\nI also noticed that the user guide for another new huawei device, the Gt2 watch, explicitly mentions that certain features (such as installing watch faces from the huawei servers) only works with the android app.\nBut I can confirm that it is straight forward to switch the device between different phones, as I used my old android phone to install other watch faces, before connecting it with my iPhone.\nEDIT/Update: things are further improving for iOS users!\nIn 2021, the only thing feature that I see on Android, but not on iOS: the ability to manage tracks manually (as in: modifying \"recorded\" trainings, or adding a training completely after the fact).\n", "Q: Will Catalina stream movies (etc) to a 3rd Generation Apple TV box? I have one of the older, 3rd generation Apple TV boxes, (the sort that came with a clicky remote, not a swipey one). I regularly use it to watch movies and TV shows served up by a Mac currently running High Sierra (I think… might be Mojave), via iTunes with home sharing.\nGiven that iTunes is a thing of the past in Catalina, will this set up still work if I upgrade the Mac to MacOS 10.15?\n\nA: If I'm correct, programs like quicktime player, Apple TV and more, offer airplay in the app itself. I know your movies(if bought on itunes), moved to the Apple tv app on your macbook. If you start playing, see the airplay button on the bottom left corner! \n", "Q: iPhone X has a green line on the screen. What is damaged? After dropping my iPhone X, green lines appeared on the screen (attached image). Searching for the problem online I could not find a satisfying answer. I would like to know if this is clearly a display (or display cable) issue, or if it might be a graphic driver/chip problem; E.g., Can I solve the problem with \"simply\" replacing the display.\nI am assuming that there is no guaranteed answer to this, however, any best guess or with high probability answer would help me deciding the fate of my phone :)\n\n\nNOTE I did a repair myself, solution added as separate answer.\n\nA: In my experience, as a former Apple Authorised Service Provider, this issue often appears together with multi-touch issues on the iPhone X and comes down to the display unit. There is a repair program for iPhone X devices with touch issues.\nI'd suggest a visit to the Apple Store or an Apple Authorised Service Provider and see if they can perform the repair under the program or otherwise perhaps wait a little bit until the issue occurs (again, in my experience, it most likely will do so, if only intermittently) and get it replaced then.\n\nOpinion: I'd advise against replacing the display yourself on an\n  iPhone X (or any (splash-) waterproof iPhone for that matter) unless\n  you really know what you're doing since not only is opening it a pain,\n  but so is resealing it properly. Apart from the fact that it's very\n  hard to get decent replacement parts.\n\n\nA: It looks like a hardware issue, display or cable hard to tell, but I'd guess display itself.\nA quick test to make sure it's not earlier in the structure is take a screenshot & look at it on another machine, phone, pad, computer. The line won't be there in the screenshot if it's a hardware fail after the GPU.\n\nA: I asked this question and here follows my solution:\nI replaced the display myself. Doing so, I noticed why the display got damaged. The battery was swollen up and pressed against the display. So I also replaced the battery. Now (almost) everything works. Since I did (at the time) not find much videos about this topic I made a video of the repair, note: tech videos are not my thing.\nYoutube video of my repair.\n", "Q: Esc button from touchbar has disappeared After a clean reinstall of OSX Catalina 10.15.2 on a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018), Esc button from the touchbar has disappeared.\nI don't have any 3rd party tool or app installed.\nAny idea on how to bring it back ?\n\nA: This option got it back on the Fn key, before following @mehyaa's suggestion.\n\n\nA: After killing Touch Bar server application it will come back.

I have recently tried to iCloud backup and I restored local files. But in doing this, accidently I pressed cancelled and local files were not backed up fully. \nLuckily, I found my local files in iCloud (archives) which is in recents files. But they are located in files not by folders. I can copy and paste, and bring back to the mac, but need to create every folder. Is there any way to bring recents files back to mac with folders?\nThe image below shows the recents file which was backed up by iCloud archives. I want them back to be relocated in folders which I created before iCloud backup. I really cannot create every folder and bring each file back in..\n\n\nA: From what I understand, \"Recents\" are recently accessed files. I have disabled this function on my system. If you have backed up you drive or some folder(s) to iCloud in some way then I would suspect the using \"iCloud Drive\" instead of \"Recents\" could give you the folder structure containing you backed up.\nAt this point these are just semi-educational guesses as I neither use iCloud for file backup or have \"Recents\" active.\n", "Q: Logitech MX Keys: sleep mode keyboard shortcut I am using the Logitech MX Keys which is great.\n\nSince there is no Eject/Power key I miss some shortcuts, specifically Option–Command–Media Eject.\nIs there a way to put my Mac to Sleep mode with this keyboard?\n\nA: As Sleep exists as a menu command, you could make your own…\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\nSelect All Applications, press the  +  button, type Sleep then pick a key command - I'd pick something hard to do by accident, like maybe  Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   Ctrl ⌃   Shift ⇧   S  \n\n I used D in the example image, because I already have S used for Shutdown\n\nA: Not sure why, but on my side, neither the solution above (maybe because I run French OSX?) nor some other options work well for me.\nAnyway, I came with another solution using the Logitech Options application which allows to customize the keys with the actions of your choice. Out of the box, sleep is not available as action in the software of Logitech. But with a very simple Applescript, the magic can happen.\nFull solution:\n\n*\n\n*open the applescript editor\n\n*create a new script with 1 line : do shell script \"pmset sleepnow\"\n\n*export it as an application (File > Export - then select File format = application)\n\n*open Logitech Options and customize the key of your choice to launch the application that you just created\n\nI hope it can help.\n\nA: If you press the \"lock\" button top right on the full keyboard and perhaps \"fn\" + \"lock\" button on the mini keyboard to lock the screen. And then when the screen is locked press \"esc\" top left button I think it's the same thing as putting it to sleep?\n\nA: If you don't want to create a new short cut just for putting your Mac into sleep mode you can also press the Lock and then the ESC button afterwards.

You can use the hash command to manage the remembered paths (from man bash):\nhash [-lr] [-p filename] [-dt] [name]\nFor each name, the full file name of the command is determined by searching the directories\nin $PATH and remembered. If the -p option is supplied, no path search is performed, and filename\nis used as the full file name of the command. The -r option causes the shell to forget all \nremembered locations. The -d option causes the shell to forget the remembered location of each\nname. If the -t option is supplied, the full pathname to which each name corresponds is printed.\nIf multiple name arguments are supplied with -t, the name is printed before the hashed full pathname.\nThe -l option causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input. If no arguments\nare given, or if only -l is supplied, information about remembered commands is printed. The \nreturn status is true unless a name is not found or an invalid option is supplied.\n\nRun hash -r to clear any command paths your shell has cached (or hash -d git to just remove the entry for git).

The laptop is working very well, so I'd rather keep it than replace it, even though it is getting old. Would Apple help at all - I never had anything fixed with them, but ofc the Mac is out of warranty.\nI think the problem may have started around High Sierra upgrade, but it didn't bother me much at the time.\nEDIT\nIt was suggested that this question is relevant. But I don't think so. I did clean the inside, and found no obvious sources of lint. Perhaps applying thermal paste would help, but I cannot see how, if the air is not pushed around by the fan.\n\nA: How are you so sure that there is no air being moved around?\nFurther, when does the throttling apply - right at the start or after some time? Because at some point under high load, you will experience some throttling on basically any laptop.\nThe only thing - depends on how familiar you are with such things - I can think of, is taking the back cover off and literally looking at the parts. Yet, I would not necessarily recommend this.\nBefore doing something like this: Save your data either in a backup or by copying your files.\nApple might be able to help you, but what usually do and recommend is going to a certified repair shop. It's more personal and you usually speak directly to the repair guy. Though, I guess they will probably not be able to do anything different than what you did, @Tetsujin or I suggested.\n", "Q: How to get correct bookmark (webloc) icon to show?

On the notes app, it seems like I have access to the drawing tools, but I can't actually draw anything. I can select the pen, highlighter/marker, pencil, eraser, ruler, and color chooser. I can adjust thickness and opacity on the drawing utensils. However, I can't actually draw anything.\nPossible solutions that I've already tried are:\n\n*\n\n*Checking that this isn't a color issue (i.e. accidentally coloring black on a black background).\n\n*Restarting the app.\n\n*Restarting my entire iPhone.\n\n*Changing the location of my note from my iCloud folder to my iPhone.\n\n*Checking that this problem persists over many notes.\n\nIs there a trick or step to get notes on iPhone to have a finger use the markup drawing tools?\n\nA: Shortly before submitting this question, I found what I believe is my answer. I hope this can help somebody later.\nOn the Notes app, you can't draw in an area with text. This not only means that you can't draw over text, but also that you can't \"make\" a space to draw in by clicking enter/return many times. If you go to the end of your document and open the drawing tools, you will see a horizontal line separating the text-section from the available drawing-section. By default, at the bottom of every document/note there is a drawing section. It is in this drawing-section that you can actually draw.\nIf you would like to insert a drawing in the middle of your note, you can double-tap a blank line where you would like to insert the drawing, and then click \"Insert Drawing\". If you try to double-tap or tap-hold in the middle of a paragraph, you won't see the \"Insert Drawing\" option.\n\nAfter you click \"Insert Drawing\", you will see your new drawing section. Note that if you would like to resize your drawing section, just tap the little circles on the left-side and drag up or down.\n \nWhen you are done drawing, your drawing section will be treated like a picture. You can delete by either tap-holding it and selecting \"Delete\" or \"Cut\", or you can go to the text-section just after it and continue hitting backspace/delete.\n\nA: I has the same problem. The solution was quite simple: Just go to settings and switch off the “Draw with Apple Pencil only” setting.

It uses a python script to read the album field from an mp3's id3 tags and write it to the Finder comment field:\n\nThis worked fine in Mojave, with each file's album being written to its comment. Now with Catalina when I run the service, every comment gets set to the following:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python: can't open file '/Users/thompcha/Documents/Scripts/album.py': [Errno 1] Operation not permitted\n\n\n*\n\n*The script works fine if I run it manually from the terminal\n\n*I granted Automator, Terminal, and Python full disk access in System Preferences\n\n*I installed python via Homebrew as suggested in responses to similar questions\n\n*I made the script chmod 777 and changed the owner to myself\n\nThe answer found here does not work for me because I need to pass the output of the python script to the rest of the shell script for further execution.\nWhat can I do to make automator successfully execute my python script?\n\nA: I ended up in-lining my python script.

I can boot into single user mode. I can boot in safe mode. Booting in verbose mode ends in an error (below). Unfortunately, I can't remember the password for the admin account, and when I tried to reset it (by saying the first boot process wasn't done), it kernel panicked before I could create a user.\nIn wondering if perhaps a cryptographic signature had expired, I set the date back a couple of years on one of them, but that didn't help.\nI just re-installed 10.6 (.3) on one of the units, and the output, in verbose mode, looks very much like it did on the other units. (This photos is from one of the other units; I think it was running 10.6.7 or .8).\n\nAny idea what I can do to get these units back into operation?\n\n\n*\n\n*they won't run Mac OS X 10.7 without more RAM, and I think they are too new for 10.5\n\n*I'd rather not install Linux or Windows on them, although it is not beyond the pale. The software is only experimentally supported under Linux, and I don't have Windows licenses for the machines.\n\n*I don't need them to connect to the internet, and would be happy to disable WiFi (which is implicated in the stack trace). I tried disabling the .kext but couldn't figure out which file it is.\n\n\nA: That photo says the kext (driver) for the Atheros airport card is what's causing the kernel panic.\nThere's a very simple way to disable this kernel extension, although it's terribly hacky: go into /System/Library/Extensions/, and rename IO80211Family.kext to IO80211Family.kext.bak.\nAfterwards, go into the Terminal and run sudo kextcache -system-caches to rebuild the kernel cache.\nOn newer systems, this would require disabling SIP and/or remounting the root partition, but this is Snow Leopard.\n\nSince you don't need the wifi, the above may be enough for you, but I'm at a loss as to the root cause of the problem—why would this kernel extension suddenly begin panicking? Safe mode, recovery mode, and single user mode likely don't load this extension, so the fact that those work makes sense, but how could the problem have suddenly appeared on two different machines?\nThe only other suspicious thing is that the computer kenel panics right after loading the lego mindstorm kext (com.ni.Fantom.nxtfwdl). That kext isn't listed in the backtrace at all, so it shouldn't be the culprit, but... if you upgraded the mindstorm software recently, you might want to try downgrading it. Or, you could try removing the mindstorm software altogether, but it sounds like that would render these machines useless to you.\n", "Q: Forget WiFi network without admin credentials Is there a way to forget a WiFi network on MacOS without knowing the admin credentials?\n\nA: From within macOS, no you can't.\nIf you don't unlock System Preferences you can't add or delete a Wi-Fi access point.  \nAs you can see you can't select a Preferred Network and the +/- is locked.\n\nNeither can you do it from command line.\nYou can add a network with sudo networksetup -addpreferredwirelessnetworkatindex  en0 whateverNetwork 0 WPA2 whateverPassword but if you try to delete it without sudo - for example with networksetup -removepreferredwirelessnetwork en0 whateverNetwork then it will prompt you.\n\nThe reason is that the files updated are these - they are owned by root and can not be modified by a non-admin user.  :\nA1398% ls -la /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/*preferences*\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   9323 Jan 15 15:42 /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   6891 Dec 27 13:35 /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin   6891 Jan 15 15:42 /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist.old\n\nAlso note as an aside that the data that is changed when you add/remove a preferred network is encrypted.  \nFor example com.apple.airport.preferences.plist was updated with wifi.ssid.77686174657665724e6574776f726b when adding and removing access point called whateverNetwork.\nThis means that if you booted from external OS to edit these files you would have to guess which keys to delete although in my limited testing they do appear to be in the same order as shown in System Preferences.\n\nA: It turns out you can forget a network on a Mac without admin privileges.

I alr set the mic input volume in sound in system preferences to max but its still too soft\n\nA: For wired headphones you have a lot of options. Bluetooth literally is a digital signal, so you have no options other than better receiver to power your headphones. Since you can’t change out Mac amplifier to increase the current or voltage you have two choices For analog:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose lower impedance headphones or more efficient headphones (Sealed or noise cancelling) to make more sound from the same output power. \n\n*Choose a headphone amplifier to increase the power out or a 100 W  Bluetooth amplifier to really make some noise. \n\n*USB DAC can be as cheap as you like - this would be a digital amplifier. \n\n\nFor Bluetooth, the max is just like the dial on the amp, it doesn’t turn any more so once you hit max volume, you have to replace the hardware. \nEven if you turn Bluetooth to eleven, max is max. \n", "Q: Finder directory containing latest iCloud Photos I often want to included a recent photo in an email, file upload, or other similar context.\nI want to select this image via the normal macOS file picker.\nI do not want to go through the hassle, each time, of exporting the photo from my Mac Photos library or AirDropping it from my iOS device.\nI'm fine finding and exporting older photos via Photos.

Rather than showing the media widget again, it shows the Finder path source of those images:\n~/⁨Library⁩/Containers⁩/⁨com.apple.MediaLibraryService⁩/Data⁩/Library⁩/Caches⁩/com.apple.iLifeMediaBrowser.ILPhotosTranscodeCache⁩\n\nThis ILPhotosTranscodeCache⁩ seems to be where the source images for that media picker are stored. They are transcoded from .HEIC to a web safe format such as .jpg. It's also a cache, and not related to the masters directory or iCloud Photos database.\nThis caches folder can be pinned to the Finder sidebar and used instead of the media widget for a faster experience.\n\n\nA: How to show all photos from icloud in macos Ventura in 2022\n\n*\n\n*Open The originals Photo Library Package Folder in Finder\n\n*Open Up a Search For All Images in the originals Folder\n\n*Save That Search to Your Sidebar\n\nOpen The originals Photo Library Package Folder in Finder\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Click on the Pictures folder in the sidebar\n\n*Right Click on Photos Library.photoslibrary\n\n*Click \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*enter the originals folder\n\nOpen Up a Search For All Images in the originals Folder\n\n*\n\n*Type ⌘+F\n\n*Where it says Kind is Any change Any to be Image\n\n*You should see all of your images at this point\n\nSave That Search to Your Sidebar\n\n*\n\n*Click Save near the top right of the find menu\n\n*Make sure Add to Sidebar is checked to ensure it gets put in your sidebar\n\nIf you really only want the latest photos\nIf you did only want the latest photos then you could modify the search to only include photos from a specified date and later.

That functionality I would like to keep if possible. So I guess if you can't just do a simple keypress it'd need to check if Youtube or iTunes is the current/last interacted with active app and act accordingly.\nDoes anyone have a possible solution or workaround they can think of?\nThank-you\n\nA: What you probably need is to insert the right key code command using an AppleScript action in your workflow.\nIn this case it's 100.\non run\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        key code 100\n    end tell\nend run\n\nIn this article you can learn more about it:\nhttps://eastmanreference.com/complete-list-of-applescript-key-codes.

Yet, when each of you create a playlist with each other favorite music/whole library, you can play their music. \nI don't really see the use of it though, since you both have access to all of apple musics songs.\nBe careful though, not to mix the following things: Apple Music library (iCloud library) and iTunes library home sharing. The second one only works on your home network with the Remote app and you don't need a family account/any account associated to the owner's account of the library. The first one though only shares your library with devices connected to that Apple Music account, but can also be shared on your home network with home sharing.\n", "Q: How to view Hidden Files in Finder? I have some .m2 files which I need to copy from Finder in Mac but I don't see them there. How can I see the hidden files in Finder.\nOne workaround is to open the folder in terminal and use ls -a command to list all files but I am  looking for a way to view in Finder.\n\nA: To make the hidden files on your Mac visible, you can do so by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, open up your Macintosh HD folder\n\n*Press Command+Shift+Dot \n\n*Your hidden files will become visible. Repeat step 2 to hide them again!\n\n\nThis process will also work elsewhere, including your Documents or Applications folders.\nYou can find other options as well like commond line option at the below link : https://setapp.com/how-to/show-hidden-files-on-mac \n", "Q: iPhone 11 A2111 compatibility with LTE bands in Europe (Portugal) Maybe this is a stupid question, but I'm visiting the States in a few months and I was thinking of buying the iPhone 11 there. I'm aware that there are 3 models because of network compatibilities.\nIn the States, they only sell the model A2111, and according to apple's website (iPhone LTE), my country (Portugal) is not supported. After some research, I found from multiple sources(List of LTE networks in Europe, Frequency Check - Portugal) that all the bands used in my Country are actually supported by this model.\nWhat I'm missing? Why would Apple remove the country from the list if it's actually supported?\n\nA: The modem and antenna setup in recent iPhones can't handle all of the band options at once, so Apple has split its models into devices that work with certain bands needed in the US and Canada, and devices that work with bands needed elsewhere.\nThe hardware of the models is pretty much the same, except that they have different modems that cover different LTE bands. Therefore, the phone you buy overseas or from black markets might not work properly on your current carrier. \niPhone 11 A2111, 11 Pro A2160, and 11 Pro Max A2161 are the US/Canadian models. iPhone 11 A2221, 11 Pro A2215, and 11 Pro Max A2218 are the world models. iPhone 11 A2223, 11 Pro A2217, and 11 Pro Max A2220 are Chinese models.\nEspecially in Europe, the US models will get poorer coverage and speeds than the world models will. \nSo it might work but not up to the expectancy level. I wouldn't suggest going with A2111 as Apple has provided the list of supporting bands. You can look for iPhone 11 A2221. \nhttps://www.apple.com/lae/iphone/LTE/#iphone-11\n", "Q: Google Hangouts on Mac Catalina I know that 32-bit apps will not work on MacOS Catalina. Unfortunately, I use Hangouts very often and the plugin requires the use of a 32-bit app.\nAs far as you know, is there the possibility to make Hangouts work on Catalina?\nThank you so much in advance.\n\nA: As far as i remember (afair), there was native Ggl Hangouts app (with 32bit components) for older macOS, but Ggl discontinued to share those files. Even if it was obtained it will not run in Catalina.\nSo an option that regular or power users can do is, use Wine-project software, it is an emulator type of software, it allows to run Windows app in macOS/Linux/Unix, etc,\n\n*\n\n*and afaik the project & project's users have began to collaborate+work on supporting 64bit-only macOS (Catalina, Big Sur, etc).\nIt is better for this case that Wine is installed by using a package-management type of software, (if Ggl Hangouts was available as stable option, and you were using 32bit supported macOS, then installing Wine directly w/o pkg-mngmt sw would've been fine).\nSee this answer here (Load Wine by using MacPorts).\n( MacPorts is a package-management type of software )\n( Homebrew (is also another package-management software, but it) violates Privacy-Rights and creates risks1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., so i will not suggest to use that, but you are free to choose whatever you want to use )\n\nGH = Google-Hangouts.\nThere was also a native Ggl Hangouts 32bit app for Windows, but Ggl discontinued files for this too, but some caching/wayback site may/can be used, to obtain it, (if you have original file's hash/checksum code known).\nAnd another option is, if GH standalone app was already installed on a PC/Windows computer & you have access to that computer, then you need to copy Hangouts exe (executables), DLLs (lib), etc files, into your macOS computer's one of the folder, & then you can use Wine app to run the exe file in macOS/Catalina.\nI have shown many/Various ways to use Google-Hangouts(GH) web-service (aka: chat network, aka: IM network) on Catalina (and Mojave) in below linked answer's EXTRA-INFO section, if you have time & respect for different choice/preferences, then read this linked answer here:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/400885/133434\n( as i have posted the link, i will not repeat info here again )\n\nA: It’s probably overkill, but you can use virtualisation software such as Parallels to run an older macOS version with 32-bit support in a virtual machine, and then use Hangouts in that VM.\n", "Q: How to disable wifi password sharing on iOS 11? Each time I unlock my iPhone, iOS 11 reminds me to share my wifi password, which is boring.\n\nI've tried this accepted answer, which does not work.\nIt is not feasible to power off someone else's device. Is there a setting on my own device to disable this feature?\n\nA: This happens because someone, that also is in your contact list, tries to enter a password for the WiFi network your device is connected to. If possible, find the MacBook Pro it wants to share the WiFi code with, and check if the MacBook is trying to connect to the WiFi network. If it is, power the MacBook off or type in the WiFi password on the MacBook.\nLet me know if you have any questions or if it worked :)\n", "Q: How to create keyboard shortcut for WiFi toggle?

When I am connected to the company VPN (via the built-in client, no third party VPNs), and my computer goes to sleep, it often freezes for a few minutes when waking up.\nWhen this happens, upon tapping a key or the track pad the screen wakes up, but the mouse cursor is frozen, and the keyboard does not seem to register any input. The touch bar still works (I can adjust volume, brightness, etc), and if I press Esc then the screen immediately turns off, as though it realized \"oh snap, I'm actually still asleep\".

third-party Kernel extensions (kext).\nAppleGFXHDADriver is a driver for audio over HDMI and Displayport (therefore, also Displayport over TB3/USB-C).\nI believe this is a bug which might be caused by using an external monitor. Certainly my experiments point to this because when I unplug my monitor before putting my MacBook to sleep I have yet to come across the issue.\nI am actually doing more experiments e.g is the order devices go to sleep a culprit. So will update this post if I have anymore information.\nAlso I would encourage you to use the feedback assistant app for macOS and post the crash report and any more information regarding your setup. The more people complain and report the more likely Apple will look into the issue further.\n\nA: For anyone here, know that I feel your pain. This was happening to me for a number of months. For me, it was disconnecting from an external monitor. I finally fixed it by resetting the SMC — https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\n", "Q: No sound through HDMI with Mac Mini Connected to Projection TV This is similar to this unanswered question and to this question, but it uses different hardware and can't be solved in the same way as that 2nd question is solved.  The bottom line is that I get sound from my Apple TV, from the BD player, but not from the Apple TV.  I'm using a MacMini 7,1\nHere's a diagram of my layout:\n\nI have three video and sound devices (Apple TV, Mac Mini, and a BD player).  Each has an HDMI cable running from the device to the Metra HDMI switcher.  The Metra switcher also extracts the audio, which goes through a TOSLink digital audio cable to a Sonos Playbar, which is part of a home theater sound system (including a woofer and two rear speakers).  The video from the Metra switcher goes through an HDMI cable to the Sony video projector.\nIt's worth noting that I had a similar problem with the BD Player.  At first I had a Sony BD player, but it would not send sound to the Sony projector.  It took me a while, including over an hour on the phone with the sales guy at Crutchfield to figure out that the Sony BD player and the Sony projector were talking to each other and, basically, the projector was saying, \"I don't have speakers.\"  The Sony BD player got that and decided, since the projector did not handle sound, it would not send audio over the HDMI output to the projector.  We solved that problem by swapping out the Sony BD player for a Panasonic and it works fine.\nThe problem with the Mac Mini is that it is not sending sound out through the HDMI cable.  When I go to the Sound preferences, there is no HDMI device I can pick for output.  (I suspect this is because it recognizes the Sony projector and knows it doesn't have sound.)  I've tried using Airplay to send sound to the Sonos system that way.  It worked once, but with sound lagging behind video 2-3 seconds.  Next time I tried working on it, I could not get Airplay to send audio to Sonos at all.\nOne problem is that the only sound input the Playbar has is the TOSLink jack, so I can't pull sound from the headphone/audio jack on the Mac and get that into the switcher or Playbar without converting the sound to HDMI or to digital - and then I'd need some other switcher.\nI did try using Airplay to use the MacMini through the Apple TV.  It could have been my imagination, but I was pretty sure there was a bit of an audio lag that way, as well.  Just barely noticeable.  (And if I do this, how will that work when playing games?  Won't there be lag with screen updates? And if I do that, is there a way to start the screen sharing with the Apple TV instead of going to the Mac just to start screen sharing, then go to the Apple TV?)\nI'm wondering if there's a way to override and tell sound, \"Just send through the HDMI output.\"  All I see as possible outputs on the Mac sound preferences is the built in speakers and a list of Sonos speakers.  (And, again, that was either not working or had a 2-3 second lag for sound.)  Or maybe there's a way to create a fake HDMI audio device to just make the Mac send audio out through the HDMI cable?\nThe bottom line is I want audio and video synced and and playing through the Sony projector and Sonos sound system.\n\nA: I talked with the company that sold me most of my system (but not the Mac - just everything else) and we couldn't find a solution.  I called Metra, the people who make the HDMI switch and one of them suggested something I could get from Amazon.  It cost me $22.49 and fixed it.\nI don't want to advocate for a particular brand, but what I found seems to not have a clear name yet.  Some are listed as HDMI feeders (the one I got that works is listed as an \"HDMI feeader\" [sic], which makes it easy to find.  Some are called HDMI EDID Emulators.  If you want to see examples, search for HDMI EDID changer (or emulator or anything close to that).\nThis is a small device that runs off the power from the HDMI cable.  Mine has a small post sticking out that looks like the post on a typical potentiometer.  There are 16 different positions and a chart on the back.  I picked \"4k 5.1CH.\"  (The Sony projector is 4K, so the only thing that changed was the audio - which is, as I indicated, non-existent on the Sony projector.)\nWhen I put the feeder in, between the Mac and the Metra HDMI switcher, the screen went blank for about 10-20 seconds, then the Mac display came back up.  Same when I changed the box to the setting I wanted.  It went blank for about 10 seconds, then the display returned.\nI had a video playing on the Mac.  After the display came back on, with 2-3 seconds, the sound changed from being played on the Mac speakers to coming from my Sonos system.  (It may have changed with the display - I can't remember.)\nSo it's working okay.  The solution was the HDMI EDID emulator that edits the EDID from the projector to add the audio specs to it.\n\nA: \nI'm wondering if there's a way to override and tell sound, \"Just send through the HDMI output.\"\n\nNo.  You can’t do this because this is not the way it works.   You’re treating this as if it were an analog audio signal that you’re just going put on the wire and it’s just going to be there.\nHDMI is a digital signal which encapsulates both audio (compressed and uncompressed) as well as a video signal.  Basically, the audio has to be encoded and decoded and to do so, it requires two way communication between the source (Mac mini) and the end device.  Since your Metra ethereal device doesn’t have this capability, your Mac doesn’t \"see\" it as an audio device which means no audio signal will be sent.  In other words, there's nothing telling your Mac \"hey, I'm an audio device.\"\nHDMI Pin Outs\n\nNotice that there are no audio pins; there's basically, data, grounding, clock sync, the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC), shielding and some +5V power.  If you wanted to extract audio, you'd have to pull it out of the data being sent.\nYou need an HDMI endpoint device\nTo be clear, the issue is your Metra device.  It’s not your projector or your Sonus.  The Metra must present itself as an audio device (or at least properly pass the HDMI signal through to another HDMI device).  We know it to be a problem because you experienced the same issue with the Sony BD player...\n\nIt's worth noting that I had a similar problem with the [Sony] BD Player.\n\nTo solve this, you will most likely need a proper HDMI Audio extractor that will not only provide switching capabilities, but will appear as a bona fide audio device to the Mac and/or pass the proper EDID data through to the Mac.\n", "Q: Can I submit an iOS App update to the App Store but hold the release of the update for a later date? I have an app that I have to update to work with the new backend.\nThe new backend will be deployed some time in the next X days. \nIs it possible to submit the update for review, but not have it released immediately after it gets approved, so that I can release the new version of the app after I swap the backend with the new one?\n\nA: \nIs it possible to submit the update for review, but not have it released immediately after it gets approved\n\nYes. It's possible to do so.\nWhen submitting your app for review on App Store Connect, simply select the option to manually release the app instead of automatically release. This way, once the app is approved by Apple, it is kept at hold for release on the App Store until approved by the developer. You are also notified by email by once the app update is approved.\nRefer to the following linked App Store Connect Help documentation pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually release a version\n\nIf you choose to manually release a version when you submit your app for review, you can release the version after it’s approved and the status changes to Pending Developer Release. If you have an app in the Pending Developer Release state for longer than 30 days, you’ll receive an email reminder from Apple.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Submit your app for review\n\n\n  \n*In the Version Release section, select a release option:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Release the app yourself: Select “Manually release this version.” (Later, manually release the version.)\n  \n  \n\n\nA: Yes.  Once Apple approves your app it moves to a “Pending Developer Release” status and stays there until you (the developer)  approves its release.\n", "Q: AppleScript tell Numbers make Pop-Up Menu from Contacts Group names, wait for input, then Email ScreenCapture This is a bit long-winded, but here goes… \nUsing AppleScript (vanilla, please), I want to automate the Numbers spreadsheet I made for my wife’s music lessons Accounts (which she uses four times a year - she’s the sole user).\nThis is my first AppleScript Project.

I already know Google Chrome was using a lot of memory for a badly behaving webpage. The issue was I don't know which webpage was doing that.\nSometimes after a day or two, possibly some webpage on Google Chrome might be using a lot of memory. \n\n\n*\n\n*Some webpage might not be intentionally broken or harmful but it could be the analytics or the ad system having a lot of memory leaks in their code\n\n*Eventually, the Macbook swaps memory to disk and if unchecked, complaints of hard disk space running low arrive. \n\n\nUsing trail-and-error, if I close all tab and wait 2 - 3 minutes or quit entirely, then the hard drive all of a sudden gains back 2GB.\nIs there a way to hunt down which webpage is eating up so much memory, other than by trail-and-error?\n\nA: Chrome has a task manager that will be handy in case you have too many tabs to close them and manually note what memory gets reclaimed.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1385029\n\n\n*\n\n*On your computer, open Chrome.\n\n*At the top right, click the vertical \"dot dot dot\" icon.\n\n*Select More Tools and then Task Manager.\n\n*Click “Memory” to sort tasks by memory usage. - Tip: Look for any items labeled \"Background page.\"\n\n*Select the task you want to close.\n\n*Click End Process. - Note: Any unsaved work in your task will be lost.\n\n\nI would also run vm_stat 1 and watch the OS memory allocations and freeing so you can watch the effects overall as you close tabs and free tasks at the application level.\n\nA: I use Safari on my mac and often i'd get a notice at the top of a web page that this certain webpage is using a lot of memory and that it was causing my computer to be sluggish.  One thing I tried that seemed to work was to restart my computer in safe mode and see if it continued doing that. Mine didn't so I deleted some of my startup items and it seemed to have worked when I restarted back in regular mode.\nYou could also try using safari on the web pages that you think maybe the culprit and see if Safari flags those pages with the messages like I got.\n\nA: Safari webpages, that are not in private mode are shown in Activity Monitor with the URL. It gets less accurate if you have multiple pages of the same website open. This isn't applicable for Chrome, which shows tools it is using to say render the app, GPU intensive tasks, notification handlers etc. If you can pinpoint a website that is using something unique to itself, it can be helpful. For e.g., it shows high GPU-related usage when playing a 4k video in a tab. \n\n\n*\n\n*How to investigate high kernel task memory usage?\n\n*\"Your system has run out of application memory.\" How is that possible?\n", "Q: npm install -g react-native-cli does not work: EACCES: permission denied I'm trying install react-native-cli in My MacBook.

It is not clear to me when this automatically happens in the case where I mainly connect the iPhone to iTunes via Wi-Fi. I don't think I've ever had a backup happen automatically -- not over Wi-Fi nor when connecting over USB.\nWhat I can't figure out by searching is whether a Wi-Fi backup to iTunes  can be done automatically. Is it even supposed to be able to do this?\nThese are additional questions that have come up that might help you understand where I'm standing:\n\n*\n\n*Does an automatic synchronization imply a backup?\n\n*If so, does Synchronize automatically when this iPhone is connected apply to iPhones connected to iTunes over Wi-Fi?\n\n*Is it possible to back up automatically over Wi-Fi at all?\n\n*If so, will it only happen if Wi-Fi sync is enabled?\n\n*If it's possible, then how regularly is this done? In other words, at what point can I tell for sure that something is wrong if no backup has been done?\n\nI'm not necessary trying to find answers to all of these questions. They're just different facets of what I'm asking.\n\nDetails\n\n*\n\n*macOS 10.14\n\n\n*iOS 13\n\n\n*Devices are not prevented from synchronizing automatically in iTunes\nsettings.\n\nA: After consulting with Apple it turns out that \n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic sync should happen every time the phone plugs into the computer while iTunes is running\n\n*None of my the iTunes installations did this on macOS or Windows, which is an error\n\n*To work around this required manually syncing a folder with a photo in it to the phone, on both windows and macOS separately. After that automatic sync starts working. \n\n\nFrom inspection I can conclude that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes\n\n*Yes, when plugged into charger\n\n*Yes\n\n*Haven’t tried yet. Probably, since backup seems to be included as a step in the syncing process. \n\n*Backup should happen within a few seconds of plugging in the charger, five hours from the last backup the same day. Should probably happen every time, regardless of interval. \n\n", "Q: Could removing corrupted files on the MacBook or Mac's hard drive make the file system's health even worse? I tried to move some files from the MacBook's SSD to a network drive (by drag and drop) , and the \"Copy\" window reported the file was corrupted. If I remove the file and empty out the trash can, could it actually further damage the file system (or make the hard drive's health even worse)?\nThis is due to: if the files was occupying some bad sectors (on the SSD), then could releasing the sectors let other apps or even the macOS write to and read from those sectors, and cause big problems due to this, especially if it is macOS using those sectors as virtual memory.\n(so in a way, if we don't delete those files, it is to let the files occupy the bad sectors so that those sectors are never used by other apps or macOS again).\nI think those files were corrupted due to when copying from the external hard drive, the USB plug was a little loose, and so the copying got interrupted in the middle. But the strange thing is, if that's the case, it should be only one file that got corrupted. Right now it was 2 or 3 files (or maybe the USB plug was loose for 2, 3 times, which I can't remember now).\nThe issue maybe further complicated by the MacBook previous using OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and possibly some of Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, and High Sierra during the upgrades in the past, so it was using HPS+ and now APFS (Mojave).\n\nA: Short answer: yes, almost any changes you make on the disk have a possibility of causing further damage. Back up anything important (making minimal changes as you do so), then try to diagnose and fix it.\nLong answer: there are several different levels where you could have data corruption/damage:\n\n\n*\n\n*There might be a hardware problem -- failing drive, bad cable, etc. I'm not familiar enough with the failure modes of SSDs to tell if this might be the problem here, but I wouldn't rule it out.\n\n*The filesystem data structures (which keep track of what files exist on the disk, where their data is stored, which blocks are available for use, etc) might be corrupted. This sort of damage sort-of applies to the entire volume (or container, in the case of APFS), but might only affect some files/folders.\n\n*Some individual files might have damaged/corrupted contents. I don't think that's the problem here, since a Finder copy will just blindly copy the contents, whether or not they make sense.\n\n\nProblems at any of these levels can cause secondary problems at higher levels. Hardware problems can cause volume data and/or file contents to get garbled, and volume problems can cause things like parts of files getting overwritten or lost. So if you see problems at one level, keep in mind that the root cause might be at a lower level.\nConversely, trying to fix (or just change) things at a higher level than the root cause can cause additional damage. If you've got damaged volume data structures, creating, deleting, or even editing files can cause the damage to snowball. If you have a hardware problem, trying to repair the volume data structures (e.g. with Disk Utility's First Aid feature) might just cause additional secondary problems at that level.\nIn your situation, the first thing I'd do is make sure any important files/data is backed up (or as sure as possible under the circumstances). If possible, do this while booted from something else, with the suspect volume mounted read-only to avoid further corruption. (That's probably not possible, so don't worry about it too much. But don't make any unnecessary changes on the disk until the backup's done.)\nThen and only then, try running hardware tests, like Apple Hardware Test (for models introduced before June 2013) or Apple Hardware Diagnostics (for models introduced after June 2013) (more info here), or a third-party test utility.\nIf the hardware tests don't find anything wrong, then start looking at the volume data structures. I don't have any experience repairing APFS yet, but I'd try Disk Utility First Aid first (probably booted in recovery mode). Frankly, if that can't fix it, I'd erase the disk (not just the volume) and reinstall/recover from scratch.\nAfterward, maintain good ongoing backups in case there's some underlying problem that didn't get detected/fixed.\n", "Q: How to show file/window names in Mission Control?

While this isn't strictly a problem (as I set mount points inside the user's home folder, and have volume ownership enabled), I would prefer for the volume to unmount and lock again automatically.\nThis behaviour differs compared to mounting an encrypted disk image, which is mounted as a specific user (when viewing the output of mount) and which then (normally*) unmounts when the user logs out.\nIs it possible to replicate the same behaviour with APFS volumes, i.e- mount automatically for user with the passphrase in their keychain when they login, and then unmount (and lock) automatically when they logout?\n*I say normally, as macOS Catalina appears to have bugs related to cleaning up user processes when a user logs out, resulting in many processes still running for logged out users. This currently includes disk-image-helper, so it no longer unmounts automatically as it did under Mojave. I'm happy to accept any answer that replicates the disk image mounting/unmounting behaviour with the caveat that this currently doesn't always work for Catalina, on the basis that it should work if Apple ever fixes these bugs.\nUpdate: I've tried doing the following in a script triggered by launchd, but launchd's kill signal doesn't appear to reach it:\n#!/bin/bash\nVOLUME=12345678-9012-3456-7890-123456789012\nMOUNT_POINT=/Users/haravikk/Desktop/Foo\n\n[ ! -e \"${MOUNT_POINT}\" ] && { mkdir \"${MOUNT_POINT}\" || exit 1; }\n\nif echo -e \"$(security find-generic-password -wa \"${VOLUME}\" | sed 's/../\\\\x&/g')\" | diskutil apfs unlockVolume \"${VOLUME}\" -stdinpassphrase; then\n    cleanup() {\n        echo 'Unmounting'\n            \n        attempts=5\n        while [[ ${attempts} -gt 0 ]]; do\n            diskutil apfs lockVolume \"${VOLUME}\" && break\n            [[ -n \"${MOUNT_POINT}\" ]] && umount \"${MOUNT_POINT}\" && break\n            attempts=$((${attempts} - 1))\n            sleep 5\n        done\n        if [[ ${attempts} = 0 ]]; then\n            if ! diskutil unmount force \"${VOLUME}\"; then\n                if [[ -z \"${MOUNT_POINT}\" ]] || ! umount -f \"${MOUNT_POINT}\"; then\n                    echo 'All attempts to unmount failed' >&2\n                fi\n            fi\n        fi\n    }\n    trap 'cleanup' SIGINT SIGHUP SIGTERM EXIT\n    while true; do\n        sleep 86400 &\n        wait $!\n    done\nfi\n\nThe idea was that when the user logs out, launchd should send their processes a kill signal (SIGINT) which will trigger the script's trap and allow it to unmount the volume. But this never seems to happen; the trap isn't triggered at all.\nIf anyone is interested in using the basics of this script, note that you will need to have an entry in your keychain for the volume (you can do this by mounting with Disk Utility and choosing to save when prompted for the password), and must make sure that security has permission to access it.\n\nA: You might try using a logout hook. Login and logout hooks are deprecated, but I believe they still function.\nMounting the volume should not be a problem; a user LaunchAgent would handle that nicely. The problem lies in trying to unmount the volume at logout. Have you considered writing a system LaunchDaemon that periodically polls the open APFS volumes and unmounts those that don't have an associated user? The volumes should be automatically locked by system security when they are unmounted, so I don't think you need to make a special effort for that, and it sounds like you're thinking more about cleanup than anything else. If you put the daemon on (say) a 30 second timer, it shouldn't consume too much in the way of resources, and volumes will only persist for an average of 15 second after logout.\n\nA: After much experimentation I've arrived at a scripted solution, with a script that can operate in two modes:\nThe first is as a daemon, usually run as root (as launch daemon), which listens on a given socket for commands identifying the volume you want to mount (must be unmounted), followed by another to confirm that you mounted it (proving you can), and a third to then unmount it, force unmount it, or clear the request. The behaviour is a bit simplistic, but should reasonably establish a client had the ability to mount the volume, and therefore is allowed to request that it then be unmounted, using a simple random credential.\nWhen not run in daemon mode, the script takes a volume identifier (anything supported by diskutil apfs unlockVolume, UUIDs preferred) and attempts to unlock and mount the volume. You need to have the password for the volume in the keychain for the user running the script, and will be prompted to allow security to access it. The script normally attempts to unmount a volume by itself, however I've established that most of the time this won't work, as disk arbitration is usually unloaded before the script attempts to do so (meaning diskutil unmount and umount both fail), as such if you want to use this script with a launch agent that will unmount on logout, you need to have a daemon running on the same system and set the --socket argument to match.\nMountAPFS\nHopefully this is fairly clear in how it's supposed to be used, as it includes examples and options are documented.

Also more and more Apps are stopping to work because the newer version won't run on 9.x OS anymore.\nConsidering the state of the planet on the whole it would be nice to being able to install any sort of alternative OS to such a technological masterpiece in nearly mint condition and likewise give it a few more years of being useful.\nCan anyone advise whether there is any project that would be worth looking at in this regards?\n\nA: As far as I know: Not really.\nThe best you can do is to jailbreak it and nope people have archived / cracked old versions of apps that either entertain you or still work as @Nimesh Neema suggested.\nFor current hardware and software, jailbreaks can add new features and light customization of iOS, it’s not really a new OS. Almost never does a jailbreak allow you to install apps that require a newer iOS, but likely you can install apps outside of the AppStore or ones that are no longer signed or updated or distributed from Apple.\nI am pretty sure though, what you are looking for, does not exist.\n", "Q: Can I use a USB keyboard with an iPad if I use a USB-to-lightning adapter? I know there are bluetooth keyboards and even wired lightning keyboards, but I'd like to get a large mechanical keyboard and it seems the wired ones only come in USB. If I use a USB-to-lightning adapter, should that work with an iPad?\n\nA: In general: Yes, as this article (and others) suggest.\nBut it always depends on the exact keyboard. If you can't find results on google for your exact model, you can only find out by testing it.\nIf you try it, I would recommend using a usb-converter with both a USB & Lightning port, mainly for this reason:\n\nYou’ll want the connection kit I linked above for one main reason – it allows you to both charge your iPad, and supply power to the keyboard you will be using. The majority of USB keyboards draw too much power for the iPad alone to supply, however having the lighting cable plugged into the adapter allows you to use the keyboard as power is supplied to it via the lighting cable.\n\nCheck out the mentioned connecton kit. \nRead the cited article here.\n", "Q: Switch Spaces via Mouse I am using two Spaces on my mojave and I can use Ctrl + Left/Arrow to change the screen. \nBut isn't there a way to use only mouse to change the space instead of using keyboard?\n\nA: If you use a Magic Mouse, then yes!\nHead over to System Preferences > Mouse. You will find an option there to set it to a two finger swipe to the left/right.\nFor other mice, ususally no. Some mice, like Logitech Master support all kinds of stuff though with the Logitech Options.\nA workaround would be to set a Hot Corner (System Preferences > Mission Control > Hot Corners), then you don't need your keyboard, but it'll take longer.\n\nA: I have an iMac with the Logitech G305 Gaming Mouse...

This performs the same action...\nHope this helps someone...\n\n\nA: I read in the comments that you are using Logitech, so with Logitech Options installed (install link here), you can set mouse gestures to switch Spaces left or right.

No camera shows in the system report under Camera, just under USB. My microphone is also not working. I tried resetting the NVRAM but it didn't solve the problem.\n\nWhat should I do to fix it?\n\nA: The T2 chip is involved in running the camera and microphone to a major extent such that the old way to troubleshoot this need an update. \nFirst, consider powering everything off and then disconnecting from power for 15 to 30 seconds to let the SMC and T2 do a complete cold boot. Portables  have a more involved SMC reset but Mac Pro and iMac Pro are easy to reset. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\nNext, consider getting diagnostic run from Apple if you have that option and if not consider connecting to the internet and running a reinstall of macOS to give everything a chance to update. Reinstalling the OS online and not from a saved installer or offline image ensures you have a chance to get caught up on EFI and firmware and bridgeOS updates. \nIn addition to the os, the T2 and the EFI Get updates only when you install the OS. This won’t intentionally erase anything, but I like to back anything important up just in case. \nLastly, take it in for a physical repair. \n", "Q: What version of Logic Pro X works on macOS Sierra?

When I bring the Macbook to the office and it connects to office wifi, it keeps waking up in the bag, draining the battery.\nI tried to reinstall macOS, everything was ok until I signed in with my Apple ID, so I suppose it's due to handoff/continuity (only thing I have installed now is iStat menus and I'm signed to iCloud, nothing else, clean OS.)\nI can lose almost full battery in one day in sleep if I don't turn off wifi and also the Macbook gets very hot and it even reboots itself because of the high temperature.\n\nI use macOS 10.15.2 on both computers.\nHow can I prevent this and still have handoff/continuity enabled?\n\nA: Power Management is the culprit. \nYou should use the pmset command to see what power management has been doing.  In Terminal, the basic command is\npmset -g log\n\nBut that gives you all the power management events since last boot time.  You can reduce this with judicious use of grep.  I have used both of these (with similar results):\npmset -g log | grep -e \"Wake from\" -e \"DarkWake\" -e \"due\"\npmset -g log | egrep \"\\b(Sleep|Wake*|DarkWake|Start)\\s{2,}\"\n\nPower Management has about 20 settings that can be changed by an admin user.  To view the settings (they will be different when on battery and power):\npmset -g\n\nFor my issue, which looks similar to yours, I changed the tcpkeepalive setting.  With this enabled (value = 1), the MacBook will frequently wake up due to network events.  \nTo change turn off tcpkeepalive use the Terminal command:\nsudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0\n\nThe -b is to set for when running on battery.\nI have also tweaked a few other settings like standbydelayhigh, but this is purely tweaking.\nThis is based on my experience with a MacBook which would lose too much (I thought) battery whilst closed overnight.\nYou may find these two links helpful:\nHow to Fix macOS Mojave Battery Draining Issue and \nman pmset.  \nNote that I have not changed hibernatemode from the default value of 3.  Many (including the linked article) discuss changing it to 25 which I do not recommend with recent (last 4 years) hardware and macOS version.\n", "Q: Is there a possibility to run a custom Notes server for iOS? I have notes where I strongly wish to avoid 3rd party cloud storage - even Apple’s\nTo that end, I am trying to set up my own one. iOS supports setting custom CalDAV server, so it is possible to handle Contacts, Reminders and Calendar with my server. Obviously, it is also possible to run own Mail server.\nWhat is left is Notes. My research shows that Notes uses IMAP protocol internally.\nI can see that if I set up an Exchange server account in Settings->Accounts, Notes will sync with that server.\nMy requirements are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use of the native notes app is preferred. Functionality including file attachments, document scanning, Apple Pencil handwriting and drawing are desired. \n\n*Sharing notes with third party is optional and not required\n\n*I would like to self host on Linux hardware using free/opensource software (MS Exchange is not free, plus it requires running Windows Server).\n\n\nIs it possible?\n\nA: So it looks like this is impossible. \nYes, Notes does support IMAP and this can be set up by adding an Email account to iOS (or macOS) and checking \"Notes\" there. \nHowever those kind of Notes are handicapped: you can't draw there with Apple Pencil, can't use any markdown like tables/bullets. Basically it is just Text and (image) attachments, making this app nearly useless (most of the notes I am making are made with Apple Pencil). \nWhat I like about internal Notes.app is that it is automatically launched upon an apple pencil tap on the locked screen - this is why I prefer it over 3rd party apps. But, when I tap on an IMAP-connected note, I am getting an Alert \"Apple Pencil is supported only on iCloud notes\".

I know I could get a flash drive with a lightning jack or with both a lightning jack and a USB jack, but is it feasible to transfer files between an iPhone XR running iOS 13.3 and a USB flash drive using a lightning cable and a female-to-female USB connector as follows?\niPhone  lightning to male USB cable  female-to-female USB adaptor USB flash drive \n\nA: This is not likely to work.  The Lightning port on Apple devices work in many ways like the mini-USB On-The-Go ports from older phones and USB-C ports on newer phones.  This means it can act as a USB host or device, just the means by which an iPhone determines which mode it should be in is different than how devices with USB-OTG ports do.\nIn USB device mode, which happens with a Lightning to USB-A male cable, the iPhone provides no power to the cable.  This means that a female to female adapter which connects the data and power lines will not power the flash drive, and the flash drive will not have power to do anything.  Connecting both to a powered hub so that both the phone and flash drive have power will still leave this USB bus with no host to initiate any communications.\nIt's unlikely any software on the iPhone will resolve this because the hardware on the phone is simply not made to act as a host when the hardware tells it to go into device mode.\nUSB from 1.1 on up was made to allow for host-to-device communications and what you describe is a device-to-device connection.  USB 2.0 allows for ports to be switched into either host or device mode, but this is done in hardware.  If there is a means to override this in software then it is violating the spec and could result in damaged hardware, if someone could find the software for this then you run the risk of damaging your iPhone the next time you try to charge it.  USB 3.0 allows for host-to-host communications with the right kind of cable and software but the flash drive is simply not going to act as a USB host.\nTo make this work will mean violating the USB spec, and running the risk of permanent damage to your phone.  There's going to be at a minimum software checks in the iOS to stop this from working, and quite likely the hardware in the iPhone simply will not enter host mode if it sees a USB-A male cable connected.\n\nA: I was always under the impression you needed the USB camera adapters for this to work. \n\n\n*\n\n*Lightning to USB Camera Adapter - https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MD821AM/A\n\n*Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter - https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MK0W2AM/A\nI can’t seem to find a reference explaining why you need additional chipset to act as a hub or if this is designed into the iOS lightning controller but my hunch is physically connecting as you describe isn’t enough and there isn’t a female to female USB-A part that will work to pass the data correctly. \n", "Q: -bash: /usr/local/bin/nmap: Bad CPU type in executable I recently update my Mac OS to Catalina 10.15.\nI ran nmap I kept getting \n\n-bash: /usr/local/bin/nmap: Bad CPU type in executable\n\n\nI've tried reinstalling it \nbrew uninstall nmap\nbrew install nmap\n\nbut I see no effect, I even try full path\n⚡️  Desktop  which nmap \n/usr/local/bin/nmap\n⚡️  Desktop  /usr/local/bin/nmap\n-bash: /usr/local/bin/nmap: Bad CPU type in executable\n⚡️  Desktop\n\n\nA: I decided to go the site : \nhttps://nmap.org/book/inst-macosx.html\n\nClick on Download\nhttps://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.80.dmg\nI downloaded that .dmg, installed it, now my nmap working again. \n\n\nNote : I will leave this post since, it might help others in the future.\n\n\nA: You may find this to be an x86 (32bit) vs x64 problem, thus a new version will be required.\n", "Q: Could my iPhone 6's 4G possibly be \"broken\" while its 3G still works?

No there aren’t different chips or antennas, but physical damage could alter the antenna length and the chip could be damaged or another frequency leaking which makes reception on the 4G data rate impossible. \nWithout debug logs or a signal tracker or opening the iPhone, you only have empirical testing or trying to erase / reinstall to isolate if it’s software which also is possible, but less likely. \n\nA: There might be a chance that the service provider is enhancing the network due to which their is tempariorly discrepeancy.\n", "Q: Can I connect a Windows 10 machine with USB C to a Thunderbolt display? This question is related to How to connect a USB-C-based MacBook to a Thunderbolt display? and Connect a Thunderbolt Display to windows 8 desktop but not quite the same.\nI have a Thunderbolt monitor and have been using it with using a newer Macbook Pro using a USB C to Thunderbolt adapter.  This setup works fine.\nI am going to be getting a Windows machine using an NVidia RTX 2080 graphics card, which has a USB C port.  Will I be able to connect this machine through the Apple USB C -> Thunderbolt adapter to a Apple Thunderbolt monitor?  If so, should I expect any performance degradation?\n\nA: No.\nTL;DR: Thunderbolt 3 uses the USB-C connector and includes USB 3.2 signaling (including a DisplayPort signal), but a USB-C connector does not necessarily include support for Thunderbolt 3.\nFew things to understand here.\n\n\n*\n\n*USB and Thunderbolt are technology standards, both of which establish their own connectors, communication and connection protocols, power delivery standards, and other specifications. Both USB and Thunderbolt support carrying multiple different types of data/power.\n\n*USB and Thunderbolt both have multiple revisions—1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.2 Gen 1x1, 3.2 Gen 1x2, 3.2 Gen 2x1, 3.2 Gen 2x2, 4.0 (upcoming), and 1, 2, 3 respectively. Don't worry, everyone hates the USB names as much as you do, and yes, they did change it on you.\n\n*USB-C is a specification for a physical connector type (like USB-A, USB-B, mini USB, and micro USB), not a protocol in itself. While the physical connector does allow/limit what can be carried, it does not in itself specify what if carried.\n\n*USB-C can carry (or not carry) USB data (ranging in speeds from 2.0's 380 Mb/s to 4.0's 40 Gb/s (upcoming)), power, or any one of the display-oriented \"Alternate Modes\" (DisplayPort, MHL, HDMI, and confusingly, Thunderbolt Alternate Modes respectively.)\n\n*Thunderbolt 3 uses the USB-C port. USB 3.2 supports it, but does not require it, except for USB 3.2 Gen 2x2, which requires it.\n\n*The upcoming USB 4.0 is effectively identical to Thunderbolt 3, but it's not out yet anyways, so who cares.\n\n*The Thunderbolt display, no matter what, requires a Thunderbolt input, not just a display input, and will not function with just a display input. Basically, the Thunderbolt display is a Thunderbolt dock with a display attached to it, with no way to attach just the display part.\n\n*Although Windows tends not to play nice with Thunderbolt displays (and 2011 and newer iMacs in Target Display Mode), they will work with some finagling.\n\n*The USB-C port on the RTX 2080 implements VirtualLink, a proposed USB-C alternate mode that isn't quite the same as the other standardized Alternate Modes, but from a practical standpoint, is often largely compatible.\n\n\nWhew. Got all that? Let's run through some scenarios.\n\n\n*\n\n*Works (usually): Connecting a Thunderbolt Display to a Thunderbolt 2 enabled Windows computer (including Macintosh in Bootcamp.)\n\n*Works, but only under macOS because the adapter still doesn't work under Windows for reasons that I really don't understand and Apple couldn't seem to explain to me over the phone either, and even then only after updating macOS to... some version of Mojave not sure which: Connecting a Thunderbolt Display to a Thunderbolt 3 enabled computer using Apple's Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 (not USB-C to Thunderbolt 2!) adapter.\n\n*Probably, but might not actually work: Connecting an Apple Cinema Display to your RTX 2080 via it's USB-C port using an adapter.\n\n\nN.b.: Different USB-C ports, as well as cables and devices, can support different parts or levels of the USB specification. Make sure everything in the chain is up to spec!\nStill confused? Understandable. Thunderbolt 3, as frankly a godlike specification as it is, is massively confusing. The split between various individual companies, consortiums, regulatory/specification bodies, implementors, vendors, and most of all, the confusing marketing and specification of USB-C makes this an absolute mess to understand. I don't blame you for thinking this would work, but sadly, it won't.\nSo, my advice? You could go ahead and throw a Thunderbolt card in your motherboard, assuming you have one that supports it (or are willing to switch to one that does.) However, the easier solution is probably just to get a different display.\n", "Q: How can I remove mounted volumes from the list that are no longer attached?

There seems to exist options for keeping MacOS application windows 'Always on Top'. \nBut is it possible via some method (e.g. a third party utility) to set an application window to be 'Always in the Back', having all other windows float on top of it, while still enabling the cursor to be editing/browsing the application in the back?\nFor example in the screenshot below, to edit the Microsoft Word document in this window configuration, I would have to click on its window, and that would hide the TextEdit window.\nNB: I realize that setting TextEdit to 'Always on Top' would achieve the same effect, however the question is if an application can be set to be in the back of all other applications – preferably not to set all other applications to 'Always be on Top'. Also, please note that I'm not asking about splitting the screen real estate between the two apps (that's off topic).\n\n\nA: Without a third party application, I don't think you can make an app invisible to 'bring to front' or 'make active'...\nHowever, An option is the use of the Command Key.\nBy holding down the Command key while in an active application, you can interact with the application behind it without activating it.\nAs you can see in the gif, the Terminal is the active application, but I can still interact with the Browser behind it without losing the focus of the active app.\n", "Q: In iOS: Can my app launch another app and get a response/acknowledgement back? In iOS, is there anyway i can launch another app to do something and then get a response back saying that it’s done.\nFor example: My iOS app APP A launches another app APP B (e.g. Google Pay) to make a payment and then after the payment is made, I would like APP A to receive a response/callback/acknowledgement saying its done.\nBy the way, I'm having zero trouble getting APP A to launch APP B via UIApplication.Shared.Open(…)\n** In android we use Android Intent to launch APP B and get a response back to APP A using OnActivityResult(…)**.\nPS: My App is actually built in React Native using NativeModules.\nThanks\n\nA: Custom URL Schemes\nYou can define and use a custom URL scheme to interact with other apps on iOS:\nDefining a Custom URL Scheme for Your App \n\nCustom URL schemes provide a way to reference resources inside your app. Users tapping a custom URL in an email, for example, launch your app in a specified context.

I am sometimes testing my apps on iPhone/iPad with Charles http PROXY to debug URL calls. I have noticed, that when I lock my iPhone and Charles is still running, I can see various URL connect calls to some sites in regular intervals. For some of the calls I can guess the app that is making the call, but some calls it does not ring a bell.\nOn Linux I have commands to find all open ports/connections and corresponding processes and I seek an equivalent way to do this on iOS/iPadOS. \nHow can I find the originator process or app for these calls?\n\nA: If you have a jailbroken iOS/iPadOS device, you can use the command \"lsof\" to find out which process has that specific port open.\nYou would run it like this:\nlsof -n -iTCP\n\nIt would list ports that the process has open with the mark \"(LISTEN)\" at the end. Outgoing connections would be marked differently depending on their state, typically \"(ESTABLISHED)\", \"(CLOSED)\" or various wait states.\n", "Q: Updating to macOS Catalina gets stuck, when trying to update from OS X Mavericks I'm trying to update a MacBook Air from early 2014 that runs OS X Mavericks (desktop) to the latest macOS (Catalina). I downloaded the installer for macOS Catalina from the App Store and when going through it, it gets stuck at the following screen:\n\nI click 'Install' and the color of that arrow icon turns from black to the grey you can see in the picture above. Then nothing happens. I waited for several hours (thinking it might be slow), but nothing ever happens.\nI also restarted the machine several times and attempted this installation again and again, but I can't seem to get any further.\nAny ideas of what else to try? I would prefer to keep the data that I have on the machine, so just updating the operating system, not doing a clean install. I did make a backup with TimeMachine before attempting to update.\n\nA: The jump from Mavericks to Catalina may be too much of a leap. Try first upgrading to High Sierra. The website How to upgrade to macOS High Sierra has a link you can use to download the High Sierra upgrade. I suggest this because the installation of High Sierra will also upgrade the firmware to recognize and boot from APFS containers. While this is not a requirement for High Sierra, it is for Catalina.\n", "Q: What happens to an in-progress `7-day phased release` on the App Store when a newer version is published? Curious what would happen when version 1.1 is on day 2 out of 7 of a 7-day phased rollout in the App Store, and you publish a 1.2 upgrade.\nWould it:\nA. Immediately release 1.1 to the remaining 80% of users?\nB. Leave the 80% of users on 1.0 until they get 1.2?\n\nA: It would not immediately release 1.1.\nIf your publish 1.2 with immediate availability, then all users will be upgraded to 1.2 the next time the auto-update process on their decice kicks in. This means that both 1.0 and 1.1 users would be updated at the same time.\nIf you publish 1.2 with phased roll-out, then that phased roll out will run independently from the other one. I.e. 1.1 is not released immediate to the remaining users, nor are users left on 1.0 until they get 1.2.\n", "Q: SSH tunnel over VPN I am using a VPN software which, like all VPNs, changes the system configuration in certain ways to make use of their servers.\nSometimes, I need to use an SSH tunnel proxy. I use Sidestep which automatically sets and unsets the proxy settings on the system when I need to use it. And I'm trying to make sure that when I'm using the SSH tunnel proxy, all the connections are still going through via VPN first, then to the SSH tunnel.\nMy fear is that when I turn the proxy on, the settings are overridden and my machine directly connects to the proxy server only.\nSo I connect first to the VPN, then to the proxy server. When I visit a site to check my IP, I see the last IP of the chain (the ssh tunnel proxy).\nHow can I make sure that the local machine is not directly connecting via the SSH tunnel, overriding the VPN settings?\nI tried with say,  the traceroute google.com command, but it returns an unknown host error when using both the VPN and the SSH tunnel (same with other commands such as ping). When using JUST the VPN or the proxy, it works as expected, showing two different routes.\n\nA: The easiest way, right off the bat, is to look at the IP you are connecting from.\nWhen I connect (via SSH) to my Mac or FreeBSD machines, I get a nice little header that looks something like the following:\nLast login:  Fri Jan 16 14:20:43 2020 from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n\nNow, if I'm connecting internally, it will be from my private address space, from public, it will be something else, if via VPN, it will be from my VPN service address space.\nBut that's my last connection.\nTo check what it is currently, you can check your current IP address:\n$ ipconfig getifaddr en0\n\nAgain, check the IP space.  As for your traffic, unless you've created a firewall rule (pf) on your local Mac to route SSH traffic through a different interface, it will be going through your VPN.\nWe know this is the case because of your already good diagnostics:\n\nWhen using JUST the VPN or the proxy, it works as expected, showing two different routes.\n\n", "Q: \"Enter exactly 64 heaxdecimal characters\" for WiFi Password So I was having some issues connecting to a WPA2 WiFi network and a prompt showed up asking for me to \"Enter exactly 64 hexadecimal characters\". I was able to simply hit Cancel and simply reconnect but I was wondering what this was. I have never seen this prompt before and was wondering if anyone could shed some light on how to reproduce it and why it occurred.\n\n\nA: You are connecting to a WPA2 network in WPA-PSK (pre-shared key) mode. In this mode, you'll usually be able to authenticate by entering a password as a string of ASCII characters (up to 63 characters). macOS will generate a 256-bit authentication key from the password using a series of manipulations (known as salting and hashing) that ensures that eavesdroppers cannot easily grab your password midair.\nHowever, it is also possible in this mode to authenticate by having the user directly enter the actual authentication key. This can be used if macOS cannot determine with the WiFi access point exactly how those manipulations described above should be done. The user is then prompted to enter exactly 64 hexadecimal characters that is equivalent to a 256-bit authentication key. This method is not commonly used in a home user setting.\nI would say that some sort of \"glitch\" happened - interference, lack of signal, etc. - that made it impossible for macOS at that moment to use the ordinary password authentication, and then prompted you to allow a key authentication instead. When you reconnected, those temporary conditions that allowed for the glitch were gone, and you could authenticate as usual with your password.\n", "Q: What is sh in the accessibility permissions in Catalina? Not sure what this is, but I upgraded from High Sierra and it asked me to enable it.  This isn't on my Macbook Pro running Catalina.\n\nHow can I tell if this is needed?\n\nA: You don’t need it so remove all things there you don’t positively trust and know you need. Then, wait for a dialog to pop up asking again for permissions so you can scrutinize what and why you’re giving up control of your Mac.\nIn this case, the sh process can run all sorts of scripts so it’s like putting a wedge in the door, anyone that uses the wedge can now get in.

It's definitely something going on with Chrome Remote Desktop)\n\nA: Sorry for posting a comment as an answer to the main question, but unfortunately it appears I do not have enough reputation to leave a comment.\nAnyway, I just wanted to point out that there was indeed an update on Chrome RD side: to be sure, I checked current version (80.0.3987) of /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/ChromeRemoteDesktopHost.app and went into Time Machine to compare with the version I had before a couple of days ago (78.0.3904).\nAlso, I remember that a few days ago that I was asked to enable some Privacy settings in the Preference Pane when the update passed -- and I did so as instructed by some Google-looking GUI that appeared at start-up.

Suppose I have a pdf file (i.e. some file that is not purchased through books).\nIf I add this file to Books, do I need to keep the original file, or does Books make a duplicate copy that it saves somewhere?\nIf the answer is \"it saves a duplicate copy\", is this contingent on cloud services being turned on?\n\nA: It is not easy to extract books out of iOS' Books app once you import them. You can only take out their names, as the app treats them as purchases, not imports. So keeping a copy in Files and then opening it in Books is better.\nIf Mac's Books is being used, the books can be found easily by spotlight or Finder. So sync would be necessary for an easy way out.

I have no interest in iCloud for syncing sizeable data like Voice Memos. It is quickest for me to just connect my iPhone to my Mac via the USB cable and do my syncing that way.\nMany changes have occurred in recent times, with iTunes now completely replaced on the Mac.\nOn Catalina 10.15.2 and iOS 13.3, this is what it currently looks like:\nThere are many Voice memos on my iPhone:\n\nBut on my macOS Finder I do not see a mention anywhere of Voice Memos being present on my iPhone:\n\n\nSimilarly, in my Mac's Music.app there is simply nothing showing up as detected on my iPhone:\n\nAs for Voice Memos.app, there appears to be no connection to the iOS counterpart whatsoever, it is empty:\n\nHas Apple abandoned USB transfer functionality between the iPhone and the Mac?\nHow can I do this? Do we now have to use third party tools like AnyTrans despite these both being Apple devices?\n\nA: If you do have any voice memos stored on your computer whether from backing it up the old way in iTunes or via iCloud, you can go and hunt for the files inside your computer. However, Apple does not recommend messing with them directly. However, if you do want to find them and be able to, for example, drag and drop them onto a hard drive, you need to search for: \"com.apple.voicememos\" in Finder. These files are kept hidden in a Libary under your user name.

I've seen both the glossy and the nano-texture version of Apple Pro Display XDR in real life, and the image quality of both is stunning.\nI did notice that while the glossy version reflected the bright lights in the Apple store, you could see hardly any glare on the nano-texture version of the display. However, the text displayed on the nano-texture version was perhaps a tiny bit less crisp and the colours were not as vivid as on the standard glass version (I did look really close, though, which I wouldn't do under normal circumstances).\nSo I wonder, except for the obvious case where one works in an environment where there's plenty of bright lights, are there any other contexts where the nano-texture is better suited than the standard glass? I.e. video editing, working with text, photography, etc.\nOr is it simply the question of personal preference and whether someone likes to see their reflection in the screen or not?\nIn your answers, please assume that while I have plenty of experience using Apple displays to work with text/code, I have only beginner-level knowledge of video and photo editing, so any observations you share are valuable.\n\nA: You kinda got it all... that's it. It's just an improved matte display that minimizes reflections and glare, at the cost of some saturation and crispness. The only difference is how the matte effect is done: in a standard matte display, it's a coating, while on the Pro Display XDR, it's etched into the glass.\nIn a professional environment, the requirements are really the same as a non-professional one: while the glossy version is better if you can work in a controlled lighting environment, that privilege isn't always available (such as on-location shoots), and the benefits of the matte display can outweigh the downsides. It really does just depend on preference and working environment.\n", "Q: Spotlight is slow in Catalina This isn't your standard \"spotlight is slow\" post due to things taking 5 seconds to react. The clue that something is strange is that on Terminal, if I type \"mdfind name-of-file\" it works in <1 second. If I use Spotlight, it takes 5 seconds. This is using the name of the file, without the extension. I tried it on both images and text files.\nSo, this isn't an indexing questioning, because obviously the index works on the command line. This isn't a \"Spotlight Suggestions\" question, because I tried turning that off, as well as location services.\nThe only thing I can think of is that Spotlight is slow in organizing and presenting the data that mdfind provides. But how do I make it faster?\n\nA: This is not an answer, but rather an addendum to @philipkd's initial question to further demonstrate the weird behavior of Spotlight on Catalina.\nI recorded a video demonstrating \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3dwqbIPFWo\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for the same file, Spotlight (⌘+Space) takes 5 seconds or more. \n\n*However, using Finder search (⌘+⌥+Space) which searches the same Spotlight index built by Spotlight, it is almost instantaneous.\n\n*A force re-indexing using sudo mdutil -E / does not solve the problem either.\n\n\nA: Short Answer:\nThis is a known issue with users complaining about Spotlight AFTER moving to Catalina. So was working correctly PRE-Catalina, WASN'T working correctly POST-Catalina upgrade.  Apple Software Engineers made some material change to the operation of Spotlight in Catalina which introduced the fault, which must be resolved by those same engineers by way of a future patch.\nLonger Answer:\nUnlike mdfind which directly queries the metadata store, a query made in Spotlight is proxied through the \"Spotlight Engine\" which appears to be the corespotlightd I see in Activity Monitor.  \nIndeed, Spotlight does things mdfind doesn't, such as calculations and searching on the web- which means Spotlight can have a dependency on your Internet connection!  mdfind only queries the local metadata store directly and returns the results through stdin.\nYou're far from the only one suffering from slow performance in Spotlight.  Loads of Catalina users are screaming for Apple to fix the problem. First complaint reported 15 Oct 2019 (week after Catalina release) and most recent complaint in link is 08 Jan 2020. The link reveals users complaining of high CPU (amongst other things) when using Spotlight which strongly indicates a bug in the process(es) responsible for proxying the query & returning results.\nTherefore, the Spotlight performance issue appears to be a fault software engineers at Apple will ultimately have to resolve.  This analysis is bolstered by the observation of these users who noted the fault was first observed after the Catalina upgrade.\nDiagnostics\nI'm not suffering this issue on my Macbook (2018 w/ 32GB RAM & 4TB Storage),  but offer some useful tips for investigating it by those who are.  This is not to say you'll be able to resolve the fault, but at least understand where/how things are breaking and (hopefully) tell Apple!:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Internet Searches & Location Services in Spotlight to unhook the Internet dependency which could be affecting speed when testing:\n\n*Use Activity Monitor Diagnostics to analyze Spotlight process corespotlightd:\n\n\nThe following granular diagnostic output is produced: PLEASE NOTE: The file md_stores.txt is just where my cursor was resting when I took the screenshot. Review all the diagnostic files.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Repeat process for and process Spotlight and review output for clues...\n\n\nIf you find how it's broken, TELL APPLE!! ;-) \n\nA: Setting it like this worked for me to make it almost as fast as before.\n\n\nA: Here is a workaround to set the \"Show a finder search widow\" by default:\nGo to System preferences / Keyboard / Spotlight / and deselect \"Show spotlight search\" and chose instead the same shortcut to show a finder search window instead.\n\nThat way you have a fast search + you can refine your searches + you have a long list of results instead of small window with a few results.\nBest solution for me, I hope it helps you too!\nBoby.\n", "Q: Convert image and save to same folder in Automator I'm trying to figure out an Automator workflow (to make as a Service/Quick Action) to convert an images' file type - easy enough with the \"Change Type Of Images\" option.

It's needed for synchronizing different stores on the distributed system. For example, if record 'A' is deleted on one store, when the system tries to sync it may see another copy of record 'A' on a different store, and it won't know that the record was deleted from the first. It might unwittingly sync record 'A' back to the first store, effectively undeleting it. The tombstone tells the system that record 'A' was deleted on the first store, so that the system can sync that deletion to the other stores appropriately.\n", "Q: What is the command to copy a file from a directory to another directory in macOS?

I will suggest a more command-line way to accomplish this large change in port access for the built-in pf firewall (no need for extra software).\nHere is a simple rule set that will block all traffic except for ports 80 and 443 (http and https).  I don't advise saving it in your /etc/pf.conf in case things go sideways - a simple reboot (if you have pf set to load at boot) will fix things.  I used the filename ~/pf_rules01.conf, you can call it what you like.\nCreate the rule file\n# Set the interface to be used\nif=\"en0\"\n\n# Default Deny Policy\nblock all\n\n# Skip the loop back interface\nset skip on lo\n\n# Set http(80) & https (443) ports #\nweb_ports = \"{80 443}\"\n\n# Pass in only web traffic\npass in quick on $if proto tcp to any port $web_ports keep state\npass out quick on $if proto tcp to any port $web_ports keep state\n\n\nTest the file\nBefore you enable the new rule set (keep in mind that you specifically asked for all protocols to be blocked except 443), you can check for syntax errors with the command:\n$ sudo pfctl -n -f /path/to/rulefile\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The -n tells pfctl to just parse the rules\n\n*The -f specifies what file to load; the default is /etc/pf.conf\n\nEnable pf\nIf all is good, enable the rule set with the -e flag\n$ sudo pfctl -e -f /path/to/rulefile\n\nTesting...\nFrom another machine, issue the command telnet <machinename || IPaddress> 80 of the host running your web server.  If everything works, you'll receive something similar to the following:\nTrying 192.168.1.123...\nConnected to testmachine.home.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n\nSuccess!  You can also try pointing your browser to the address and if you get a response from the server, it works.\n\nCaveats\n\n\n*\n\n*This blocks all traffic with the exception of 80 and 443 (http and https).  If you are SSHing into this box, you will lose your connection because it's not passing SSH (port 22) in or out (maybe pass 22 as well?).\n\n*en0 is my network adapter (wired).  Yours may be different.  To get a listing of your network interfaces, use the ifconfig command.  They are usually at the top of the output starting with en0, en1 etc.\n\n*This was tested on a FreeBSD server running dhttpd (not Apache). You can't test unless you have something listening and responding on the ports you're interested in.  \nI typically don't run any sort of web server on my Mac, but in VMs\nfor the sake of portability, security, and stability.  However, pf\nis based on BSD and the rules and commands are identical.\n\n*If you want to turn this off just issue the command sudo pfctl -d and it will disable the pf firewall.\n", "Q: How to stop Xcode downloading iOS support package of my iPhone?

First off, let´s set the scene. I am trying to make a small applet (.app) to include in a DMG-file for distribution. The .app file will only activate when a user drags a folder with my product-files onto it. Then the folder is supposed to be copied into the current user´s /Music/MY CUSTOM PATH/. Any user on any system, that happens to be logged in.\nThis is similar to having a relative symlink/alias to the /Applications folder, like when you install google chrome or any app that comes in a dmg. \nSo, by using the Automator action \"copy finder items\" I dragged the pre-defined variable \"variables > Locations > Music\" to the action and that works well on any system, by copying any file you drag onto my .app into the users ~/Music folder. \nGreat. But my app goes into the folder ~/Music/Audio Music Apps/Patches/my-folder.

I want to remove the Skype status icons from the menu bar of my MacBook, when the app is running. I see that Microsoft has been ignoring the same question from many user, for years. MS Forum. There is no such toggle in preferences either.\nSo I looked for the relevant .tiff, .png, .icn, .icns files in various places, including inside the Skype.app, hoping that removing those (or replacing them with blanks) would do the job. But nothing came up.\nCan I eliminate the visible icon from the menu bar while running Skype on macOS Catalina?\n\nA: If you want Skype installed and control over the menu bar, you need an app to mediate between Microsoft and Apple.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.macbartender.com/\nThe Skype app clearly thinks it belongs in the menu bar, changing the icon when program state changes, so unless Microsoft changes the design or adds a preference, someone clever hot patches the app or Apple changes, we’re lucky to have a flexible and powerful mediator.\n\nA: Since Skype 8 is an Electron app you can modify its source code. Run this command in Terminal:\nLC_ALL=C sed -i '' -e \"s/_initTray(){.\\{7\\}/_initTray(){return;/\" -e \"s/initTrayMenu(){.\\{7\\}/initTrayMenu(){return;/\" /Applications/Skype.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar\n\nIt will prevent the menu bar icon from being created.\n\nA: You can't.\nThese icons appear to be rendered (on the fly) as they are animated. This indicates that there is no static icon file that you can edit or delete.   I use both OneDrive and Skype, both have animated icons and neither can be removed from the Menu Bar.\nIt appears (IMO) that this is a design decision by Microsoft because their Menu Bar does more than just give you access to sub-menu items; the icon(s) displays status like \"Away\", \"Do Not Disturb\" or \"Invisible\".  More importantly, it shows whether you have connectivity or not.\nSpeaking from a perspective of been a Product Manager for both hardware and software, it's entirely plausible there were folks who removed the icons from the status bar only to complain to Microsoft that they needed a way to know if they were \"Away\" when they didn't mean to be.  I don't know that this happened, but I've seen similar in my own experience.\n\nI see that Microsoft has been ignoring the same question from many\n  user, for years. MS Forum.\n\nPutting on my pragmatic hat here for a moment, since the 23rd of Nov. 2017 when the thread was created, there's only 183 people that identified they had the same question.\n\nThere are approximately 1.67 billion Skype users world wide*.  To put that into perspective, that's a percentage of 1.01 x 10-7 or 0.000000002%.  This is a very small population over approximately a (roughly) 26 month period!\nIf we compare it to the outstanding feature requests the top request at this time has 1,250 votes and that's only the 1st one.  If I tabulate all the requests greater than 183, you're looking at 4,750.  This issue is just 4% of that total.  \nKeep in mind that this is not considered a bug or a problem (as nothing is broken) but a feature request (yes, it's a \"problem\" to you).\nWhat does all this mean?  \nIt's an annoyance and you'd like it gone, but given where it ranks in the grand scheme of things, it's not likely to get implemented.  The squeaky wheels get the grease and this issue barely has any squeak.\n\n*https://www.statista.com/statistics/820384/estimated-number-skype-users-worldwide/\n", "Q: What should I do with the X11 Security folder after upgrade to Catalina?

The problem is screen sharing is just abysmally slow and I don't want to use 3rd party screen sharing utilities.  I prefer to do this in Terminal (SSH) as it's much more efficient for me.  \nIs there a way to upgrade VirtualBox from the command line?\n\nA: How to upgrade VirtualBox via the Command Line in macOS - 5 steps!\nThis is a quick guide on how to upgrade (install) VirtualBox from the command line.   It will involve mounting a .dmg, installing a .pkg, and finally upgrading (installing) the Extension Pack.  \nPrerequisites\nThis guide assumes you have already downloaded the required files found on https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and have sudo privileges.\nYou also need the names or UUIDS of the running VMs. You can get that by using the VBoxManage list runningvms command.  Remember if you use the VM name and it has spaces, you must encapsulate it in quotes.  Example: VBoxManage showvminfo \"My VM\"\n\n1.  Shutdown all running VMs and VirtualBox Application\nShutting down VMs is as simple as logging in and powering down the VM.  However, since this is \"Terminal only\" solution, we need to look at the savestate function in VBoxManage.\nVBoxManage controlvm <vmname|UUID> savestate\n\nIssue that command for each VM by name or UUID and it will automatically save the \"position\" of the running VM and then close it.  This is equivalent to selecting the Close item in Machine Menu of the VirtualBox GUI. \nNote:  This is not like \"pulling the plug\"  This will save the machine state so that when you power back on, it will pick up right where it left off. \nNext, we need to make sure the VirtualBox GUI (management console) isn't running.  To kill the VirtualBox GUI, just issue the command:\nkillall VirtualBox\n\n\n2.  Mount the VirtualBox Installation .dmg1\nhdiutil attach ~/Downloads/VirtualBox-Version.dmg\n\nYou will see several \"Checksumming\" messages and when finished, you will see the disks and mount point that the image was attached to similar to below (these device identifiers and names will differ from yours):\n/dev/disk5              GUID_partition_scheme\n/dev/disk5s1            Apple_HFS                       /Volumes/VirtualBox\n\nThe important piece is /Volumes/VirtualBox.  This is where the installer will be located.\n\n3. Install the .pkg2\nNext, we're going to run the installer to install the .pkg file. Located on the volume we just mounted.\nsudo installer -pkg /Volumes/VirtualBox/VirtualBox.pkg -target /\n\nIf you get the following message, go back to step 1\ninstaller: Error - The installer has detected running virtual machines. Please shut down all running VirtualBox machines and then restart the installation\n\nIf all goes well, you should see the following message:\ninstaller: Package name is Oracle VM VirtualBox\ninstaller: Upgrading at base path /\ninstaller: The upgrade was successful.  \n\nYou can verify that the new version was installed by issuing the command:\nVBoxManage --version\n\n\n4. Install the Extension Pack\nTo upgrade the Extension Pack, you need to remove the old one and install the new one.  You can use the VirtualBoxManage extpack uninstall [--force] { name } and VBoxManage extpack install {tarball} commands, but luckily, Oracle provided us with a --replace option to do it in one step:\nsudo VBoxManage extpack install --replace ~/Downloads/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-version.vbox-extpack\n\nThere will be some license terms, simply enter \"Y\" to accept.  If successful, you will see the following message:\nSuccessfully installed \"Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack\".\n\n\n5. Restart your VMs and Eject Your Volume\nSuccess!  You're all done.  Restart your VMs as needed\nVBoxManage startvm <vmname|UUID> [--type headless|GUI|seperate]\n\nMost of my VMs are headless boxes so I issue the command with the --type headless option\nVBoxManage startvm \"FreeBSD\" --type headless\n\nDon't forget to eject the installation media volume.  You won't want unsuspecting users coming in and finding attached volumes!\nhdiutil eject /Volumes/VirtualBox\n\n\nReferences and further reading\n1Is there a command to install a dmg\n2Installing .pkg with terminal ?\nVBManage Reference Manual\n", "Q: How could I replace Mathtype in a mathematic document with Catalina? I think I'm not the only one with this problem on Mac.\nI have to buy a new MacBook with Catalina 10.15 (64 bits).\nBeing a math teacher, I need Mathtype to edit equations in my docs. I have a lot of old (and actual) docs made with Mathtype. The big advantage with Mathtype is that I can change my equation's font (arial, franklin, etc.). This is what I'm searching for.\nBut Mathtype (Wiris) doesn't plan a new version for Catalina (see https://lp.wiris.com/catalina/ or others forums). If I change my mac, I couldn't use Mathtype anymore.\nI do not know what to do with this problem... \nI can use Pages or Word for editing.\nI could use Latex : not easy to use different font. Not easy to insert graph or other geogebra images, etc. I tried this solution last year, but I'm really too perfectionist to get what I need.\nI could use Word 2016 equation editor : only 2 or 3 fonts availables on the web...\nI could use Page 8.2.1 equation editor : the Blahtex fonts are limited. This is impossible to find a ttf who matches with possibles fonts.\nI don't understand why I seem to be te only person with this problem on internet... It's impossible. Probably because others don't care about the font. \nCould you help please? Some suggestions?\n(Sorry for my bad english)\n\nA: I had the same dilemma with Adobe CS5 and CS6. Ended up buying a refurbished 2018 Mac Mini directly from Apple. Came with Catalina preinstalled. Used the following steps to install Mojave.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Mojave from the link on the Apple website How to upgrade to macOS Mojave.\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application to create a new APFS volume in the existing APFS container.\n\n*Boot to macOS Recovery to allow booting from external media. You will only need to perform this step, if your Mac has the new T2 chip.\n\n*Used a flash drive to install Mojave to the new APFS volume. The instructions are given on the Apple website How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\n\n\nYou can now install your 32 bit applications. Basically, you will have a dual boot arrangement. When MathType 8 is released, you can install to the preinstalled Catalina. Mojave can be removed by using the Disk Utility to delete the APFS volume containing Mojave.\nBefore purchasing a refurbished Mac, you should confirm that the model was early enough to run Mojave. The website everyman.com is a good place to get this information. If for some reason the purchased model can not be downgraded to Mojave, Apple does have a 14 day return policy.\nI should note that under Mojave I do get a error message when quitting an Adobe CS5 or CS6 application. Other than the message, the applications appear to function properly.\n\nA: I have a similar issue: I need to use MathType for one specialized project, so I'm not upgrading from Mojave to Catalina. As klanomath says, Wiris (the publishers of MathType) claims that they'll have an interim MathType for Catalina available. I emailed them about this, and they replied,\n\nUnfortunately, though we have been months working around the clock on\n  an interim MathType version for Catalina, we regret to inform you that\n  this version will not be ready for a few months. We will keep you\n  informed of the progress of this version promptly via e-mail.\nIf you would like to keep on using MathType, we would strongly advise\n  not to update your macOS to Catalina until we release our MathType\n  Catalina version.\n\nThis was back on October 9th, so I'm not sure what to expect. I will note that it took MathType something like 6 years to upgrade from v. 6 to v. 7 so that MathType would work on Word 16 for Mac. I had to use Word 11 for years because of this. Also, every developer has known about the transition to 64 bit apps for many years, but Wiris appears to have been caught off guard, or at least they were unable to make the transition in the several years they had. So why would we expect them to be able to do it in the next few months?\nI mostly write equation-heavy documents in LaTeX, but, as I said, there's this one project I have which needs Word and MathType.\n\nA: Typically there are many old Windows machines available in a university setting.  Therefore, another possibility is to request one that is no longer in use and configure it so that you can log into it from your new MacBook machine using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).  Run Microsoft Word on both your MacBook and Windows machines with MathType included on the Windows machine.  RDP will open a \"window\" on your MacBook showing Word with MathType running on the Windows machine.  You can write your equations in the Windows \"window\" and simply copy and paste into Word running on your MacBook.  \n\nA: I recently purchased M1 chip(Catalina/BigSur).I also found that I could not edit my old MS word documents. Then I discovered that MathType was working on docx files but would not work on doc files. In docx files you could delete the old equation and write a new one in its place but you still wouldn't be able to edit those equations. So whenever I need to make changes tonally old document I have to change the document to docx. Hope this works for you too.\n\nA: According to https://store.wiris.com/en/products/mathtype/download/mac MathType still isn't compatible with the latest versions of macOS, Catalina (10.15) and Big Sur (11.00).\nThe best solution for me has been using Mathematica from Wólfram.  They have accessible academic licenses, and it is an excellent software for numerous mathematical applications.\nIn Mathematica, we can write our equations nicely and professionally and, in principle, display them in their environment.\nBut that is not all; one can select a nicely formatted equation in Mathematica, and under the \"Copy As\" option of the Edit bar, one can copy it as \"LaTex\" or \"MathML\" inputs. Then, one can paste this input directly as an equation in Word and forget about \"MathType\" for once and forever.\nUnfortunately, the LaTeX option for Word only works for Windows, so if LaTeX quality is desired, this should be done through a virtual machine.  But the  MathML option works fine for the Mac, not as nice as LaTeX, but quite acceptable.\n", "Q: Does google drive work with Finder integration?

Now I want to make that app for iPad. So can I make the same app for iPad or do I need to create the separate app on AppStore Connect for that?\nAs I remember 4 years ago, I got this problem in one of my application due to which I was not able to make my app for iPad. And I had to create the separate iPad app at that time.\n\nA: The answer depends on what you mean by \"making the same app for iPad\".\nIf you mean that you're going to take the app (its source code) and make it compatible with both the iPhone and the iPad at the same time - and then publish that on the App Store for both platforms - then yes, you can do that. When you change your Info.plist to indicate that you support both iPhone and iPad as targets and submit your app update, the App Store will automatically list the app for both types of devices.\nIf you mean that you're going to create a separate app (new project) that will support the iPad only, and you want to publish that under the same name as the iPhone-only app - then no, you cannot do that.

The headset stays connected an still appear when I check my bluetooth settings. Reselecting the headset in 'Sound' settings doesn't change a thing. \nWhen I turn them off and on again then it will work for a certain time again. \nRestarting doesn't change a thing and the following fix that I found for other problems also doesn't fix it:\n sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext \n sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\n\nAnyone have an idea how to solve this?\n\nA: This is not necessarily a macOS or Apple problem.  My thought is that you have an issue with the Bluetooth device itself.  \nThe BT device being connected isn’t a big factor here (well, you obviously need to be connected to transmit data, but that’s not what I’m referring to, here).  The radio signals BT uses isn’t that much different than two way radios used way back when (think of CB radios back in the day)...\n\n\n*\n\n*Theres a frequency the two devices negotiate to communicate on (breaker one-nine, breaker one-nine)\n\n*There’s a broadcast, a handshake and an acknowledgement to communicate (got your ears on, good buddy?  I’m broadcasting in the clear, come on back!)\n\n*Then there’s is an exchange of data (there’s a Smokey on your six, be careful.  I’m looking for some go-go juice and to put some groceries down my neck)\n\n\nIn a BT audio device, there’s a DAC, or digital audio converter that translates the digital data to audio.  Think of it as a translator sitting next to converting CB lingo to normal speech (Smokey = police; go-go juice = fuel; groceries down neck = food)\nWhat I believe is happening is this DAC portion of your BT device is crashing.  The connection is still there, but there’s nothing to translate digital to analog and then amplify it so you can hear.  \nWe can confirm this because nothing you do to the Mac has any effect, however, if you restart the BT device, it works again.  You need to replace the BT device with a new one.\n\nA: I have exactly the same issue.

I am trying to use OneCast to control 10 Xboxes, I have successfully got up to 6 that I can control, I can view all 10, but can't control all 10. The issue I am having is that when I load the app multiple times it loads it under the same User ID, and due to license limitations of the app I can only connect up to 3 Xboxes under a license.\nI was able to load 3 more copies of OneCast as a root user giving me access to a total of 6 Xboxes. When I load as another user other than the root user I cannot control the apps with a controller as the bluetooth does not recognize the apps under a different user as the bluetooth connection is ran as a root user which gives it access so far to at least 2 user accounts, the root user and the one that I am currently logged in as. I need to boot up Onecast as the current User I am using but need to have it boot from scratch so I can enter in multiple License keys, giving me access to control all 10 Xboxes.\nHere are the commands I have used.\n\n\n*\n\n*This command lets me view the connected Xboxes but not control them\necho \"Password\" | sudo -S -u User2/Applications/OneCast#2.app/Contents/MacOS/OneCast\n\n\n*This lets me control up to an additional 3 Xboxes for a total of 6\necho \"Password\" | sudo -S /Applications/OneCast#2.app/Contents/MacOS/OneCast\n\nIs there a way I can edit the .plist file to adjust how OneCast Loads? How do I find where the app's code verifies which user is loading it?\n\nA: This is a clear violation of their licensing terms.\n\n\nOur single-user licenses provide access to the software on one or more\n  personally owned machines. Each user needs just one single-user\n  license, regardless of how many machines the software will be used on.\n  Please note that there is also a limit of how many different Xbox One\n  consoles may be used with each license key, so don’t share your\n  license key with others.

You can install it on as many Macs as you like, but if the users are different, you're in violation.\nI don't advise trying to circumvent this restriction as they seem to imply the ability to disable the software.

The degrees delta has a noticable impact on fan noise and is making me consider returning the machine.\nIs it normal for MacBook to be running so much hotter when plugged in? Idles at 60 degrees on a charger and just 50 on battery.\n\nA: The new Macbook Pro 16\" has problems with external displays connected to it, sometimes even just external hdd's or other thunderbolt devices.\nDo you have external displays connected? \nBasically the GPU will get pinned at 18watt+ and produce max heat on the right side of the laptop where it is located.\nThis will cause the laptop to go at 60 degrees C at idle and 3k~ rpm fans, and spike to 100+ degrees under CPU load.\nApple has not responded officially to this, even though I am in multiple forums that have people mentioning they contact Apple support that have them go trough random tests that does nothing.\nPlease call Apple and report this issue so we get as many people reporting it as possible.\nI have scheduled calls with them, that they keep postponing.\nIf you want to see for yourself istat menus can show you the information, it should have a trial so you can see it.\nShort video of me having laptop unplugged and plugged with istat menus open:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3vV1-CWMQg\nI have installed Turbo Boost Switcher, and turned off Turbo Boost for the time being or my Macbook will go into thermal shutdown on intense cpu tasks. \nYay for getting an i9 cpu locked to 2.4Ghz the performance is terrible. \nHoping Apple will eventually let me return it for money back, I'm over my no questions asked return days.\n\nA: Check \"activity monitor\" for CPU-usage.  \nYou may have a busy webpage somewhere hidden on a tab in Chrome or Safari, using as much CPU as it can (and being allowed to as the machine is not on battery).\n\nA: Ended up solving this issue by installing Macs Fan Control app and setting the fan speed myself to 3000.\nAt idle now the CPU is at 65 degrees average at 3000RPM, without this the CPU would be at 60 degrees at 5500RPM. Fair trade until Apple figures out its thermal issues, this is almost certainly a bug in their thermal management (potentially a turboboost feedback loop?).\nMy workload requires bursts of performance (compiling code, etc) and I typically like to have a youtube video playing in the background, and now I can do both with the CPU turboboosting for short periods and 4k videos playing without having to turn the volume up to drown out the sounds of the fans going nuts.\n\nA: Sounds very normal to me. The 16  is designed to drive massive GPU and CPU wattage for maximum performance as opposed to maximum thermal economy. It’s the polar opposite of the MacBook One / iPad Pro design. \nThis is almost certainly the design since Apple controls the thermal and power envelopes strictly when on and off charger. I would avoid the delay of a return by getting a system scan remotely via AppleCare and then ask if they think it’s worth an exchange. Your MacBook Pro is designed to run for hours and days with the cpu at or near 100C. It’s designed to detect any reason to accelerate and push more pixels at a higher refresh rate or juice the CPU to run a benchmark fractionally faster than before.  A small difference at low power makes great sense to be the baseline settings for a lightly loaded system idling. \nI expect we will see more control soon than we have today as well to both suppress wattage and engage it even earlier than you are seeing. \nIf you want a cool, low power unit, this isn’t the Mac designed for you.  \n\n\n*\n\n*https://marco.org/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode-redux\n", "Q: Batch rename files replacing non-alphanumeric characters with underscore I would like to recursively rename several files located in all subdirectories of a parent folder.

I recently bought Massdrop Alt High Profile keyboard. It's pretty heavy at 43oz or 1.3Kg (the weight equal two or three normal mechanical keyboards).\nMy question is, can I put it on the MacBook Pro so that I can use it with Magic Trackpad (not put on the screen)? Will it damage MacBook pro? \n\nA: The weight of the keyboard is one thing.  I have seen students put a stack of textbooks on top of their MacBook laptops without any damage.  I can't tell you what the weight was nor do I want to embark on a testing procedure to find out what its weight tolerance is.\nHowever, what I have found is that it's not so much the weight, but the activity that impacts the MacBook.  I have seen MacBook laptops used as everything from a cafeteria tray to a seat cushion to even a mirror for putting on makeup.  These machines were returned to our depot for repair because of what they was done to them, not what was placed on them.\nIn your case, you want to use this as a keyboard stand for a mechanical keyboard (gaming perhaps?) so you will be \"pounding\" on this keyboard for any length of time. \nThe (rethorical) question is - is this worth it?  Is a damaged top case worth this activity?  I can tell you that these assemblies (keyboard, case, track pad, etc.)  are not covered under Apple warranty when damaged and it's quite expensive to repair.  I'd find another solution.\n\nA: I can't see the case for this being good, since most of the time you want the keyboard on a surface lower than the screen - I'd prop the Mac on something behind the keyboard and get a Magic Trackpad or mouse of your choosing so your hands can be all on a lower plane than the Mac. (get the Twelve South curve if you can)\n\nAlso, you'll want to control for any case where the lid shuts - since I've seen all sorts of damage where no-one intended for the lid to shut, yet it does. That keyboard will damage the hinge or crack the glass in a fraction of a heartbeat due to the leverage the screen will exert on the part that pinches by the hinges.\nDamage due to rubbing / pressure on the case is the last of your worries in my experience. The unibody construction is very solid and if you truly want the keyboard on top of the Mac, you could easily make shims on the left and right to attack to your solid keyboard so they press on the same surface as the Mac and not use the Mac top case as the surface to press.\n", "Q: Why would a python3 script not find a module when run in Automator?

Is there a guide to command line plus Automator ?\n\nA: Another option for running in automator without having to reinstall the module is to provide the path to the instance of python that you want used.\ne.g. I used Homebrew to install python3\nso I use the following in Automator to run that instance of python\n/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/bin/python3\n\nSource: VikingOSX reply here\n\nA: Solved:\nI'm not sure why it worked, but running pip3 install pyperclip in the automator window installed it in the correct location for it to be used.\n", "Q: Can't delete Alex voice from the iOS simulator I'm working with iOS voices for accessibility reasons. In iOS simulator I've tried to install Alex voice which is one of the most popular English voices. To choose it I downloaded it first. However, after that, the voice looks like something between enabled and disabled.\nE.g. for Allison I see that it's not downloaded hence it's not available for me. On the other hand, Samantha is downloaded, so I can navigate further and edit the voice, for example I can delete it. But for Alex I can't neither delete it nor select it to use later.\nWhen I try to press Erase All Content and Settings... for the simulator, sometimes it doesn't change anything, but sometimes it erases Alex voice, but situation returns after downloading this voice. Is there any other way how it Alex can be installed on the simulator?\n\n\nA: The only way to fix this bug is a factory reset, which erases everything \n", "Q: Creating a New TXT Document within a Newly-Created Folder I'm building an Applescript that currently creates a new finder folder inside a certain folder:\ntell application \"Finder\"\nactivate\nmake new folder at folder \"RecUp Memos\" of folder \"Dropbox\" of folder \"Jimmbo\" of folder \"Users\" of startup disk\nend tell\n\nI don't name the folder because I want the result to be \"untitled folder [x+1]\".\nNext step is to create, name, and save a new blank TXT document inside that new folder.

From what you posted it looks like some background daemon is loading a notification extension into the system. That's a bit of code that lurks in the background and posts notifications on the screen if you get text messages. That extension, in turn, is checking in with the Messages app, which is why 'Madrid' is popping up in your logs.

You will in general then be using a server that is near you - i.e. if you're in France, you could be using a German server while if you're in New York you might be communicating with a server in Washington D.C.\nThere are multiple ways of achieving such a system up. A simple one, which is the one you're have come across here, is to use the DNS (domain name system). The DNS system is responsible for (amongst other things) to resolve a name (such as  init-p01md.apple.com) into an IP (such as 219.88.192.83). Akamai simply makes their DNS server reply with different IP addresses according to who asks it. That way they can redirect traffic intended for the same service to various servers across the globe.\n", "Q: How to create a read-only RAM disk on macOS from the command line?

Help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: This is easy to isolate.\nSign out of Messages and make sure no other app or system is causing the slowdowns. The more you get freezes, the quicker you can know that it’s just messages causing the slowdown as opposed to being impacted. YOu might open Activity Monitor and show all processes to see which are using a lot of CPU.\nThen you can make a new user account. In that account - only sign in to messages - see if the slowdown is there (assuming you concluded it was the cause above).\nIf so - then you might check with Apple Support to be sure you don’t have an issue server side and possibly consider backing up and restoring your Mac to make sure it’s not part of the system that’s stuck or causing the slowdown.\nKeep in mind, for physical hard disks - the first sign you get of imminent failure can be slow apps, so maybe make a good backup first and then test to isolate what’s slow.\n\nA: I found the problem by killing one running app/service by another:\nI had activated the Accessibilty Keyboard to appear/disappear when in lower left corner for 1 sec with the cursor and also to fade away after 0.25s.\nI think that fading caused the system trouble.\nThere was actually no way I could have realized that (except maybe through the Console, but I don't know how to filter the given information to finde the neadel in the haystak)\n", "Q: Can't start tftpd because port is already in use by launchd Enabling tftpd\nsudo launchctl load -F /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist\n\nStart:\nsudo launchctl start com.apple.tftpd\n\nSee logs syslog -w\ncom.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.tftpd[30687]) <Warning>: Service exited with abnormal code: 1\n\nOr with log stream --process tftp --level debug\nFiltering the log data using \"process BEGINSWITH[cd] \"tftp\"\"\nTimestamp                       Thread     Type        Activity             PID    TTL\n2020-01-21 12:35:44.903240+0200 0x5292a    Activity    0x6afa0              31479  0    tftpd: (libsystem_info.dylib) Retrieve User by Name\n2020-01-21 12:35:44.903949+0200 0x5292a    Default     0x0                  31479  0    tftpd: recvfrom: Resource temporarily unavailable\n\nI also tried to run tftpd directly without launchctl sudo /usr/libexec/tftpd -d -i /private/tftpboot/ with the same results.\nEarlier I used this configuration and it worked fine.

This is basically because you've just told it to do so in the plist file, you've quoted in your question. If you're not used to launchd or similar programs on Unix-systems, it might seem counterintuitive - but this is how things are supposed to work.\nBasically launchd does not start the tftpd server program at boot or when you login. Instead it opens port 69 and waits for someone to actually contact the tftp service - only when it is actually going to be used by someone, launchd starts the tftpd server program and hands over the traffic to that program.\nTherefore it is as intended that port 69 is in use by launchd.\n", "Q: How to deal with \"Your Apple ID currently has two-step verification turned on, but two-factor authentication is required.\" on developer.apple.com? \nhttps://developer.apple.com/apple-id/\n\nYour Apple ID currently has two-step verification turned on, but\n  two-factor authentication is required.

These are documented in Chapter 6 of the VirtualBox documentation \n\n\n*\n\n*NAT with port forwarding\n\n*Host Only\n\n*Bridged\n\n\nNAT with port forwarding is most similar to what we use every day behind our routers.  In VBox, you can create this NAT network at setup port forwarding from the Preferences Pane.  You can configure port forwarding the same way you would configure it on a router.  In your case, you could forward port 2222 (or whatever free port you like) to 22 on the guest\n\nHost Only Networks is a network in which the Host and the Guests \"live\" on their own little subnet with their own IP addresses.  VBox creates a software interface on your Mac that allows your machine to see it, but that internal network cannot see anything beyond your host.  Use this when you need to isolate your testing area from your production area.\nA Bridged Network is functionally easier to setup, but not ideal if you're working in a secured network environment (like a corporate network).  It uses your host physical network adapter to filter traffic for itself.  It appears on your network as a separate host as if it's not even running as a VM.  While easy to implement, the downside is that if your network admin has policies and procedures against new hardware appearing on the network, there's going to be a lot of hurdles you'll have to jump through to make it work.\nEach one has their pluses and minuses.  Since your ultimate goal is to automate processes on an Amazon EC2 instance, which will have a software defined firewall and port forwarding configured, you may want to emulate this setup with NAT and port forwarding.  This way, you can flush out any issues as they arise.\n", "Q: Mac Pro 2020 upgradability - DDR5, ARM, Neural Engine? Can the Mac Pro 2020 in the future be upgraded to replace/add these:\n\n\n*\n\n*DDR4 -> DDR5\n\n*Intel -> Arm\n\n*... -> Apple Neural Engine\n\n\nOr are they not compatible with the current Mac Pro design?\nThey are all technologies that could potentially be available for Mac products within a year or two.\n\nA: The short answer is no, the Mac Pro isn’t upgradeable to any if those technologies.\n\n\n*\n\n*DDR5 RAM, is a low power, but double bandwidth compared to DDR4.  Its a standard that hasn’t been released yet, and must be supported by the CPU.  in order to support this, you would need to redesign the logic board to accept the new requirements and since it’s a non-finalized standard, nobody has adopted the tech yet.\n\n*ARM vs Intel.  This is two completely different CPU architectures.  To use an automotive analogy, this is like asking if your car with a big block V8 can use an electric motor from a Tesla.  Unless you remove all the drive train and what supports it so you can put in this new tech, it’s not upgradeable.  The same holds true for Intel to ARM; you’d have to replace the logic board (at minimum) to support it and that’s not “an upgrade”\n\n*Apple Neural Engine is a technology that comes on their ARM SoC (System on Chip), it’s not application software that you can just install and suddenly have.  This is their CPU, and to support it, you’d need a whole new architecture.  See the previous point.\n\n\nHowever, I think you said it best in your question:\n\nThey are all technologies that could potentially be available for Mac products within a year or two.\n\nThey are potentially available which means the standards by which they inter-operate with other technologies haven’t been finalized and thusly, not implemented.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro: \"Zero bytes left on iCloud\" even after upgrading storage plan I am facing an issue with my iCloud Drive.

I've created an automator app to find all the csv files on a flash drive, then modify and copy those files to a directory on the hard disk of my MAC. The automator app uses a shell script to compare the files found on the flash drive to those already on the hard disk, and it only copies the files that do not already exist in the destination directory.\nFor the first 21 files (they are numbered) this worked just fine, but now files 22-30 do not get copied over to the hdd. After some debug, I found that automator is not seeing the complete list of csv files that exist on the flash drive.\nThe way things are supposed to work is, I insert the flash drive into the MAC SD card slot. Then I drag the icon for the flash drive on top of the icon for the automator app. The automator app steps are:\n    “Get Folder Contents” (‘Repeat for each subfolder found’ is checked), followed by\n    “Filter Finder Items” (which looks for files with the extension “.csv”).\n    Then that list of files passes to my Shell Script (which compares the names of the files it receives to the names of the files in the destination directory, and acts on those files that do not exist in the destination directory).\nWith debug I have found the problem happens before the Shell Script, the list of files passed from “Filter Finder Items” does not include the newest files on the flash drive.\nThrough another step of debug I found that if I open one of the csv files using Numbers (while the csv file is still on the flash drive), then close the file (no editing or saving involved), then when I drag the Flash Drive icon onto the automator app icon, THAT csv file which I have just opened DOES get passed to the script and the file ends up in the destination directory.\nWhen I was developing this automator app the first 21 files already existed on the flash drive. Everything worked fine. A week later, the new files were added to the flash drive (by an external, non-MAC device), and now for some reason the MAC files system (or at least automator) does not “see” the new files.\nI have some ideas as to how to fix this, but I am wondering if there is some caching feature of the Flash Drive that might be intervening, or some other MAC OS idiosyncrasy that I am missing.\nPower-down and rebooting the MAC did not fix it.\nAny thoughts on this?\nthanks,\nmichael.\n\nA: \"The Filter Finder Items action uses Spotlight. Having success after using an item with Numbers.app would suggest that the (newer) external files have not been indexed (yet).\"\nThanks!!  I modified the Automator app to remove the \"Filter Finder Items\" action (I put this functionality into the Shell Script)\nso now I have:\n   “Get Folder Contents” (‘Repeat for each subfolder found’ is checked),\n    followed by a Shell Script (which compares the names of the files on the flash drive to the names of the files in the destination directory, and acts on those files that do not exist in the destination directory).\nAnd this works just fine, no files are left out.\n", "Q: how to change the day output from 2 days to lets say 50 days I read this:\nSee website visit time in Safari history\nIn this article, there is something like this\n sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 'select visit_time,title from history_visits order by visit_time desc;' \\\n     | while read i; do d=\"${i%%.*}\"; echo \"$(date -r $((d+978307200))) | ${i#*|}\"; done \\\n     | head -n 30\n\nMy question:\nhow could I extend this script from 2 days to 50 days\nthanks for answering\n\nA: There is nothing in the one-liner which limits by days.

It designates the partition as a Windows Recovery Environment, which is the ugly stepsibling of macOS' recovery partition. Changing the GUID of a partition doesn't modify the volume format! A wrong GUID usually renders a partition unbootable though.\nIt's rather unclear how and why the GUID has been modified.\nDepending on your (former) macOS system version it should be either the GUID of an APFS, a CoreStorage or an HFS+ partition instead. To detect the proper GUID for disk0s2, use the method described here. If you remember the system version the steps to detect the partition type outlined there are usually not required.\nHere, the system of the broken boot volume is known (macOS 10.5 Catalina). Catalina's boot partition type exclusively is APFS.\n\nThen the standard procedure would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to another boot device (either Internet Recovery/macOS Recovery (alt-cmd-R), another Mac (with the broken Mac attached in Target Disk Mode) or a thumb drive. Preferred system version: the same as the \"broken\" one.

Am I using grep incorrectly or is there another way to do this?\n\nA: It's not working as expected because Macs use a BSD version of grep while the answers you're seeing are for GNU grep as found on Linux. They're very similar but not identical, and they handle -m differently. BSD grep treats -m as covering the full output, while GNU's version is per-file.\nOne way to get the result you describe is like this:\nfind . -type f -exec grep -H -m1 library '{}' \\;\n\nThis uses find to get the path to every file in . (recursively, so it gets all sub-directories) an then runs grep -m1 on each of them. The -type f tells find to only get regular files, not directories and other things. The -H tells grep to print the names of matching files, not just the matching text.\nAnother way would be to install GNU grep, using Homebrew.\n", "Q: Files and Folders services do not appear I'm running macOS Catalina 10.15.2.\nI enabled \"Files and Folders\" in Services under Shortcuts in the Keyboard tab and I enabled all services under Files and Folders. \nThe services do not appear in the Finder's Services menu.

Regardless, I make sure there are no OS-incompatibility issues, namely: run same version of OS on each MacBook and that the copied OS is supported by the target MacBook.\n\nA: I cloned my old Mac Mini 2012 onto my new 2018 Mini (with a T2). \nTrying to remember exactly how I did it (in terms of what volume booted and how they were connected) but there are two important points:\n\n\n*\n\n*After cloning, the OS would not boot, and I had to reinstall the OS on top of newly cloned disk. (Keeping all my data, apps and settings.)\n\n*The Admin user on the disk does not have a 'Secure Token', and can't be used to change Secure Boot settings. Follow Peter Thorn's excellent answer in this question. \nI've previously cloned a succession of my Macs over the last 15 years or so, and never had a problem before.\n\nA: It should. I mean it was one of the major usecases of CCC before the T2 arrived. What exactly is it that you want to do?\n", "Q: Will reinstall macOS delete the current OS? Will the current OS be deleted after I reinstall the new version OS by command+option+R?\n\nA: Yes and no \nThe update will install new things and modify existing ones. Your data and all your programs should stay the same though, but depending on your update some programs (for example 32-bit) will stop working.\nYou can't just downgrade to/simultaneously use the older OS if thats what you'd be trying to do after upgrading.\nYet, with a TimeMachine backup or a clean install you can get the older OS or the OS your computer shipped with.\n", "Q: How do I change the speed in my timelapse intervals? I've looked everywhere online for this answer, but I could only find a 503k words blog on what a time-lapse is on Google. \nI want to be able to slow certain parts of a time lapse down to regular recording speed, post or during the filming. \nI've tried with Splice, but since a timelapse itself is just a load of photos, it just shows me the photos one by one. \nDoes anybody have a soloution?\n\nA: There is - as far as I know - no option to do exactly what you want to achieve.\n\nHow the iPhone camera app makes a time-lapse and what it means for you:\nI will quote from an apple community thread since this explanation is very good I think: \n\nThe iPhone's time lapse camera will condense to about 20-40 seconds regardless of how long you record your time-lapse. If you record for less than 10 minutes then the frame capture is 2fps, after 10 minutes it reduces to 1fps, and reduces further at 40 minutes, 80 minutes, and so on. \n\nIn that process, all the images in between get lost. You end up with a 30fps video and no frames in between (which you would need for smoothly slowing it back down to real-time) are saved. Therefore, when slowing down your video, it will get choppy until you can see every single frame.\nPossible workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Record a normal video, then quickly change to time-lapse mode \nIf you do this, you can put the clips together later on. Depending of the length of your time-lapse (which determines how fast real-time has been sped-up) you might not notice the missing part. \nExample: Record a normal clip. Quickly change to time-lapse and start recording for more than 40 minutes. As explained above, the iPhone will take 1fp2s, meaning your transition time from switching recording modes could be up to 2 seconds and you would not notice (on iPhone 6s 4K 30fps should be 350mb/min)\n\n*Take a normal video and speed the parts up in post \nThis is possible and somewhat suitable for shorter clips, but you create huge files, filling up your smartphone very quickly. \n(Suitable) Example: Take a 10 min 4K 30fps video (already about 3,5GB!) . In post adapt your speed as you wish. If you don't need the flexibility of changing something afterwards, I highly suggest you export the new file and then delete the original 10 min video.\n\n\nOther than that, I haven't heard of any app that does what you want.\nAs a note: There are apps though, where you can adjust the frame rate of video recording exactly how you want it and not make the phone decide.\n", "Q: prevent Microsoft Remote Desktop from starting in full screen mode I have an iMac (always newest OS which now is Catalina) with a big monitor and a second external monitor, i.e. I have two big monitors on my desk.\nIn the settings of Mission Control I have chosen that my monitors shall NOT use different spaces. (I want to spread spreadsheets and other apps across both monitors to have a wide view on them, this is only possible when both monitors share the same space).\nMy version of Microsoft Remote Desktop is 10.3.7 which also is the newest version. Everything works fine, but MRD always starts in full screen mode. This means it covers one screen entirely while the other screen completely turns into black. But I want to see my mac Desktop on the other screen, because I sometimes want to drag and drop files between the two systems (which btw. works perfect).\nI always have to switch MRD into windows mode and then have to drag this windows corners until the window covers one of my two monitors, and the I can work in both systems.\nBut It would be much more convenient if MRD would already start in windows mode instead of full screen mode. But I didn't find a matching switch in the settings.\nHow can I tell Microsoft Remote Desktop to always open in windows mode on my mac?\nbtw: I don't need full screen mode on my Mac for any app. So, I also would be very happy if there was a way to disable full screen mode on my Mac completely for all apps.\n\nA: Check the display settings - right click your saved session & Edit or click the small pencil icon bottom right of it…\n\nI don't recall what the defaults are - I've had this set up too long to remember - but the above settings work well for me, to open maximised* but not fullscreen on my second monitor, which I have set as you do, not using separate spaces.\n*or rather 'the same as I last used it'.\n", "Q: Should I protect (encrypt) my app's database or is it automatically protected from other apps? My app asks the user several questions then stores all the answers in a local sqlite database file (e.g. answers.db). No data is transmitted outside the phone but answers are stored to let the user reflect on her old/previous answers on a monthly/yearly basis. Some answers may include highly confidential / sensitive information (e.g. religion, health, etc.) and I am worried this file may pose a risk. \nCan other apps installed in the same iPhone read this sqlite file? And can a file explorer copy/paste this file if the user connects the iPhone to her computer?\nIn summary: should I manually encrypt my app files or is Apple automatically taking care of this? I have browsed Apple security documentation and this information is difficult to find (for me).\nAnyone knows?\n\nA: You must actively encrypt sensitive data. This is the only way you can reliably manage the risk involved.\nEvery iOS application's data is stored within a container. In theory only your application and the operating system can access the contents of this container.\nYou can opt for the operating system to handle the encryption for your app:\n\nEncrypting Your App’s Files\nProtect the user’s data in iOS by encrypting it on disk.\nOverview\nData protection is an iOS feature that you use to secure your app’s files and prevent unauthorized access to them. Data protection is enabled automatically when the user sets an active passcode for the device. You read and write your files normally, but the system encrypts and decrypts your content behind the scenes. The encryption and decryption processes are automatic and hardware accelerated.\n…\nFiles containing personal information about the user, or files created directly by the user, always warrant the strongest level of protection. Assign the complete protection level to user data files and manage access to those files using the app delegate methods. The app delegate methods give you time to close the files before they become inaccessible to your app.\n\n", "Q: Can't route specified site traffic to direct WiFi connection, to avoid VPN macOS Catalina 10.15.2\nWiFi on en0 (MAC xx:xx:xx:xx:85:80)\nVPN — Wireguard CLI (utun2)\nI have a permanent VPN connection and all traffic is going through it.

But I need to use the network interface instead of the gateway IP, because it usually changes from time to time.\nHow can I set proper redirection?\n\nA: Your usage of the -interface option is faulty. As the router's man page man routerdescribes: \n\nIf the destination is directly reachable via an interface requiring no\n  intermediary system to act as a gateway, the -interface modifier should\n  be specified; the gateway given is the address of this host on the common\n  network, indicating the interface to be used for transmission.\n\nThe host music.yandex.ru (213.180.204.186) is no destination directly reachable via en0. It requires at least one intermediary system (your Wi-Fi router) to reach this host.\nCompare this with your router:\n192.168.43.63      0:a:f5:12:f9:98    UHLWIir        en0   1200\n\nThe router's Wi-Fi interface is \"directly connected\" to your Mac's Wi-Fi interface. 0:a:f5:12:f9:98 is your router's MAC-address (some Airgo/Qualcomm device).\nAdditional background: The MAC address is an address of a node on the data link layer (layer 2). Layer 2 has no routing capability. Routing is done on the network layer (layer 3) - nodes of the network layer have IP addresses!\n\nIf your VPN app doesn't provide the feature to route single IP-addresses to the system's default gateway (the IP address of your Wi-Fi router), you indeed have to create static routes.\nTo deal with changing networks (and thus changing default gateways) simply create different locations in System Preferences > Network > Location.\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable dragging (drag-n-drop) in a read-write dmg file? I´m creating a dmg image that should be able to use drag-n-drop of a folder onto an application. \nThe user installs my app by dragging a folder onto an application (.app) that is made by Automator and installs the folder by copying it to the correct location. It does not install into the Applications folder, it´s in the User´s own directories. So not something one can use an Alias or symlink for. \nThe only problem is that the DMG converted to read-only (compressed, in Disk Utility) does not allow one to drop anything into anything, not even onto my little install app. (! :/)\nOne solution is to use a read-write DMG file. Not a good alternative. The user will mess up the order or positioning of the folders and files before installing and come back to a messed up installer app later on, for next time around. Also, it does not auto-open on double-clicking on the .dmg. That´s why you make them read-only.\nSo, can I disable dragging and essentially \"lock\" the file´s location in the read-write enabled DMG file format?\nFor solutions, any way is interesting, by terminal or any app.\n\nA: It is not possible to disable drag-n-dropping of icons in Finder for a specific read-write DMG from within the DMG.\nYou should consider creating your installer in a different manner. For example consider using a read-only DMG with an app inside that the user needs to double click. When double clicked it will present a window allowing the user to drag-n-drop onto that area and doing whatever you wanted doing initially.\n", "Q: Is it safe to stack Mac minis on top of each other? I am thinking of purchasing another Mac mini - I already have an older one - and I am planning to keep them on top of each other as I have limited space on my desk. \nI was wondering if it is safe? I am concerned about ventilation. If this is not a good practice then is there any solution that would allow me to keep my new Mac minis on top of each other on my desk? \n\nA: It depends on the workloads you subject it to. Except for extreme scenarios, you should be fine. Create a little clearance between the units and allow room for convection, don't put them in a cupboard.\nIf you are building a render farm out of new Mac mini's (don't), you're probably using them in a professional capacity. And you're probably planning to phase them out after 3-5 years. These are the kinds of scenarios where heat may be problematic.\nIf you plan to regularly max out the CPU and/or GPU of the unit (rendering, transcoding, gaming, heavy server loads), then two effects come into play:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thermal Throttling: Suboptimal performance, the CPU reduces its clock speed if it gets hotter.\n\n\nThe degree to which occurs depends on the design of the Mac mini's cooling solution. Some reviews indicate that the current model throttles during benchmarks and highly CPU-intensive workloads. Others indicate that it's not much of an issue.\n\n\n*Reduced Lifespan: A Mac mini may die a little sooner if it is running hot continuously.\n\n\nAs stated by @lx07, the Mac mini will shut down if it gets too hot. However, this thermal protection only prevents the computer from burning out. Well before that point, the increase in temperature is likely to reduce both lifespan and reliability of electrical components.\nApple designs the thermal solution accordingly and buys sufficiently high-quality components that this should not generally be an issue. The fan in a MacBook Pro often does not kick in before it reaches 70c/158f. This is deliberate.\nDo note that HDDs are more susceptible to heat. HDDs produce more heat than SSDs and are (in theory) more severely affected than other components because they rely on specific mechanical tolerances. BackBlaze keeps their drives very cool: mostly below 30c/86f. I'd expect the effect to be exacerbated above 50c/122f, but I can't find a good source. Drops and vibration are likely bigger contributors to HDD failure.\n\nA: In How to position your Mac mini, Apple, perhaps being overcautious, say not to:\n\nDon't put anything on top of your Mac mini or stack Mac minis on top of each other either. If your Mac mini is configured with AirPort or Bluetooth, you could hamper the signal strength since the antennas are located in the top of the computer.\n\nIf you only connect with Ethernet the connectivity issues are moot and even if you do use a Bluetooth keyboard or Wi-Fi you may well find it it works well enough for your situation.\nAlthough not mentioned in the support article the Mac mini dissipates a large amount of heat through the case and insufficient ventilation will cause an increased temperature particularly in the lower mini if the hot air is trapped and can not escape.\nIt will certainly not harm anything to test stacking them as they will shut down if they get dangerously hot. Prior to a temperature related shutdown however you may find reduced CPU performance as there is less thermal head-room to Turbo the CPU clock, and it may also possibly shorten the lifetime of components due to running near the upper end of their safe temperature range for extended periods. \nSo while it can't hurt to try you should watch the temperatures. As @IconDemon mentions in their answer with sufficient ventilation this will not be an issue.  As they mentioned in their answer ventilation may be improved by putting rubber feet or other spacers to increase the size of the air gap between them.\nIf you try it and find it is causing a problem either with heat (and thus fan noise) or connectivity, you could perhaps put them both on their sides with a gap between. As mentioned in the support doc above and in this question Is it safe to run a Mac Mini (i5) on its side? you can safely do this. \nThis vertical configuration would allow air heated by the cases to easily rise and escape rather than be trapped under the mini above.\n\nA: I use an IKEA 7-inch trivet underneath my Mac mini to improve ventilation. That might help between stacked Mac minis :\n\n\nA: I wish I had a picture for absolute proof, but at one point we stacked up 5 Mac minis for several years running two FirstClass email servers, an OD server, and two file servers. They were in a well air-conditioned systems room with superlative ventilation.\nTo improve the air-flow between the Mac minis, I did stick 1/2\" rubber feet at each corner of the chassis.\n\nA: Lots of great answers already but I have recently tried this and while heating etc., were not a problem, bluetooth connectivity was.  It is hard to imagine not using bluetooth for something so be aware that covering the mini with something metallic and hence shielding can cause problems.  I reshuffled my stack with the mini on top of two hard drives, with an Apple CD/DVD reader on the very top (Apple requires these drives to be connected directly to the computer).  As long as I position the Apple CD/DVD reader just so, I get good bluetooth again. (-:\n", "Q: How to disable clamshell mode behaviour?

I am working with them on what I believe is an identical issue of iCloud files not syncing from my Mac (macOS Catalina) to iCloud since the last few days. \nGo to https://support.apple.com/icloud and scroll to the bottom and click on the \"Get support\" link and choose \"Update, Backup, and Restore\". \nI have spent perhaps 3 hours with 3 different support people as the issue gets escalated to the support engineers. \nI don't know about you, but some files do sync up and back just fine, like those associated in iCloud Drive with certain applications (eg, Drafts, MindNode). I can create a text file at the top level of iCloud Drive and it syncs. But not for folder that I create manually. \nI have gone through a macOS Catalina re-install (via Recovery Mode) and that did not solve my problem. I am now awaiting the support engineers to review diagnostics information from my computer. When I have a definitive answer, I will report back on what hopefully solves my issue. \nI had wanted to comment on your post, rather than answer it, but I don't have sufficient reputation points to do that. \nCheers, David\n", "Q: Creating Rsync script to copy files for multiple users and the shared directory I want to copy files to an external drive to use as a backup using RSync. I have installed OpenMediaVault to serve as NAS. I installed RSyncOsX to have a GUI to set parameters for Rsync to execute. Trying to set up the backup script I got confused.\nThe RSyncOSX manual https://rsyncosx.github.io/RsyncGUIfirststart says one has to give RsyncOSX permission on the root of the home catalog. This seems to suggest that I have to set up a script for all users on my Mac. Previously I used TimeMachine and I didn’t need to set this up for every user. I would like my backup script to work for all users including the shared directory.\nI also want all file permissions to stay in place so user files are still protected from viewing by other users after they have been copied.\nHow am I to proceed?\n\nA: Well after some more searching I found the answer here: https://superuser.com/questions/270911/run-rsync-with-root-permission-on-remote-machine. So what I have to do is create a script and then have it executed as root. The script can either be run from the NAS pulling data from the Mac or the other way around. Which I will probably do, because then I can run the script at shutdown.\n", "Q: Where does the huge amount of \"\" iCloud Keychain items come from and what is their purpose? I just discovered that there is a huge amount (hundreds) of items in my iCloud Keychain that I can not explain. They were all created starting from 7th of January up until 13th January. \n\nWhen I right-click them to see detailed information, \nthere isn't any information visible. When I click on \"access\", under access groups \"com.apple.security.octagon\" shows up. However I couldn't find anything mentioning that particular URL through googling.\nCan anyone explain what purpose those keychains items serve and where they come from?\n\nA: Messages and FaceTime does per device encryption, so these would map to key pairs generated for device to cloud encrypted devices.\nThe com.apple is simply a naming convention for the subsystem that claims the entry - and not an actual dns name.\nI wouldn’t worry about them till you have tens of thousands and you can always sign out of messaging on all your devices and then try and clean things, but in my experience these self regulate and don’t impair performance if you just focus on the items you know and interact with.\n", "Q: Activity Monitor columns missing My Activity Monitor does not have any columns that show more details about each process.\nI've already ensured that under \"View\" in the menu bar, the relevant columns are enabled.\n\nA: You can reset your Activity Monitor settings by quitting Activity Monitor, and then  deleting the preferences file, and any preferences lock files, and then re-opening the app.\nOpen Terminal and paste in the following command:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ActivityMonitor.plist*\n\n(Note the * at the end to delete com.apple.ActivityMonitor.plist.lock and com.apple.ActivityMonitor.plist.)\nHit enter, and reopen Activity monitor - the columns should now be present.\n\nA: The \"Process Name\" column is too big, causing it to crowd out the other columns pushing them to the right side. You can manually resize the \"Process Name\" column by enlarging the Activity Monitor window, scrolling far to the right, and then dragging the column separator between \"Process Name\" and the next column back to the left so that the column is standard size again. \nThis problem happened to me after a Catalina update. For whatever reason, the default size of that column was changed by the update causing this to occur.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install the GNU mt tape drive command in OSX? I would like to use GNU mt, the tape drive commands in OSX. Is this something I can get or are the architectures incompatible?\n\nA: macOS does not come with mt - neither the BSD nor the GNU variant.\nmt requires your system to have, amongst other things, the magtape I/O-controls. The specification of those controls are made available by the system to developers via a file named mtio.h. That particular file was included with OS X before Snow Leopard, but all versions of OS X and macOS since 2009 has not included that file. \nIn addition to the magtape ioctls, you'll also need a driver for your actual tape drive. This is the part of the system that will set up a device for you that the magtape ioctls can be used on. This typically shows up as /dev/rstX on Unix-systems. However, such a driver has never shipped with any version of OS X or macOS.\nIf you want to use a tape driver according to Apple's recommendations, you'll need to use a driver and user software that uses Apple's own SCSI API.\nHowever, third party developers have created a project for macOS to create a device driver that shows up as a /dev/rst0 device that is compatible with mt - alongside the actual mt program. Even though lots of work has been done, it is still listed as not being of \"production quality\" - nor does it seem to have been worked on for the some years now. You can find the project and download the software here:\nhttps://github.com/jessepeterson/IOSCSITape\nYou do not list what your intentions are in getting mt working on macOS. In some cases you'll probably be better off by running FreeBSD or Linux on top of macOS using a virtualisation system (such as VMware, Parallels, VirtualBox or similar). Depending on your specific type of tape drive and SCSI interface, it could be possible to use a FreeBSD or Linux mt command along with their drivers for your tape drive.\n", "Q: Can I make Xcode app icon with 512x512 icon instead of recommended 1024x1024? I'm following this tutorial on making icons for a React Native app using Xcode. It recommends using Icon Set Creator to make the set of icons of various sizes for iOS, and Android Asset Studio for Android. In both of these, they instruct you to drag and drop your original icon, which the apps will convert into icons of the sizes you need. The problem is that they both say to use an original image of at least 1024x1024 pixels, but mine is 512x512.\nOne of the icons the apps generate is 1024x1024, so I know for this one the  image quality will suffer. What I want to know is, will this be a problem in practice? Does anyone know where that 1024x1024 image gets used, and will it be a problem that the image quality is cut in half for that icon?\n\nA: \nYour app icon is displayed in many places, including in Finder, the Dock, Launchpad, and the App Store. To ensure that your app icon looks great everywhere people see it, provide it in the following sizes.\n\n*\n\n*512px × 512px (512pt × 512pt @1x)\n\n*1024px × 1024px (512pt × 512pt @2x)\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/icons-and-images/app-icon/\n\nTechnical Q&A QA1686 lists the specific uses of each icon size in iOS, but I can't find an equivalent resource for macOS.\nYou should use an actual 1024px image if at all possible. An upscaled icon may be rejected by App Store Review.\n\nA: For best quality, you will want to use a 1024x1024 original image.  Apple usually downscales those for display on its various App stores (unless your app is featured)\nIn practice, I've (re)submitted to the App Store old 512x512 icon images and even older 114x114 icons that I just upscaled to the required 1024x1024 size using Preview, and Apple has approved those submissions.\n", "Q: Cron job not exiting in Catalina; leaving zombie processes I just upgraded to catalina a few days ago.

Rest is Keychain. \n\nIt can be done on iOS in Settings → Notes → Password.\n\n\nA: As this has not been resolved.\nI'm having the same problem.\nI was sure I knew my password but I must have mistyped it because it doesn't accept it.\nPlease let me know how I can prove to you that it is my Phone and Mac so that you can help me?\nThank you and best\nn7nii\n", "Q: Unable to mount a SSD hard drive on macOS Catalina I attached a brand new Seagate USB SSD drive (Backup Plus Slim) to a MacBook Pro running 10.15.2. It mounted the first time, I could see it in Finder, and was able to run the Mac start up program on the drive. However this did not seem to work, so I disconnected the drive. I thought I ejected it properly but not absolutely sure.\nThen when I plugged it in again, I could not see it in Finder.  I also tried on a Mac mini running 10.14.6 but could not see it in Finder either.  Back on the MacBook Pro, I tried Disk Utility. It found the disk, but it was greyed out and not mounted. When I tried to mount it, I saw the following error:\nCould not mount “disk2s2”. (com.apple.DiskManagement.disenter error -119930868.)\n\nDoing a search on Google, I found this discussion, which indicates it is a Catalina problem. I could not see any useful answer.\nI have tried waiting for hours for it to fix itself and rebooting my machine, but it appears that the disk has become damaged. How do I fix this?\n\nA: Exactly my issue, but luckily, the solution was simple! Take a coffee and wait. Seems like Catalina does a thorough disk check whenever you try to mount some sort of disk. For example, my HDD had around 500GB of data and it took around 5 minutes before it was automatically mounted and working as expected. In the meantime, I was unable to mount and to eject the disk (the error was the same, the disk was in use by another process). Simply plug in the disk and let the OS do the check it needs (some other users might know more about what is going on in the background and feel free to edit my comment to extend the knowledge). Patience, it will mount itself automatically after it finished all the background checks :)\n", "Q: In macOS Activity Monitor, why is \"Applications in last 12 hours\" grayed out / disabled? Any idea why the \"Applications in last 12 hours\" is disabled in the \"Activity Monitor\"?\nAt one point it appeared briefly -- but after days of using it, it has since disappeared. \nUsing macOS 10.15.2.

I can open the UI and input files etc but when it comes to writing a destination file it gives an error without giving much explanation. \nMy guess is that it has something to do with Catalina's increased per operation access rights but I am not sure. \nI tried to give write access to Time Lapse Assembler on ~/Downloads, I tried to write on a SD card, tried to create a file with (chmod 777) everybody but no luck either. \nI wonder if there is a trick to explicitly disable checks or if there is any other trick to make Time Lapse Assembler work on Catalina. \nExact error message on the pop up dialog is: \"Error encoding file: There was an error accessing the destination file. File may already exist and be opened in another application. Close other applications and try again.\n\nA: Have you tried with, for example, macOS High Sierra? If it works then it's not because of the APFS.\nWhat changed with Catalina is that a part of the file system is mounted as write only.\nFirst of all you can try giving full disk access on privacy and security preference.\nIf that doesn't help try disabling the SIP from recovery mode with csrutil disable and after reboot try sudo mount -uw /; killall Finder to mount everything as read and write.\n", "Q: Can I safely uncheck the Optimise Mac Storage check box on the Apple ID - iCloud page? On this screen, the Optimise Mac Storage box is √ checked. If I uncheck it, do I lose all my files or do they eventually end up in the cloud?\nI see a lot of advice about this, but none mention this checkbox option that I can see.\nI can't work out if all files will be stored in the cloud, or all files will be stored on my computer?\n\n\nA: Yes, it is perfectly safe to uncheck that box.\nWhen you uncheck it, the computer will start downloading your files from your iCloud Drive (if you have any files there, that are not already stored on your computer).\nUnchecking usually means that more space will be taken up on your computers disk drive, but that is fully safe and does not make your computer slower or anything like that.\nIf you decide against it later, you can always check the box again to let the system automatically manage disk space.\n\nA: Since you use iCloud Drive (as iCloud Drive is checked at the top), it is absolutely safe to uncheck the Optimise Mac storage option. No matter what you select, your data is definitely stored on iCloud, therefore it is absolutely safe to check or uncheck this option. You will not lose any data.\nWhen you \"check\" optimize Mac storage it will offload the files in iCloud from your local hard drive, which means every time you want to use a non-recent file it has to be downloaded again from iCloud.\nWhen it is \"unchecked\", all your iCloud Data will be stored in iCloud and on your local hard drive. Therefore, you can work offline with those files and later they will be synced.\nNote: If the system detects two file versions during sync, depending on the file type, it will either ask you which version to keep or take the newer edit. \nExample: You work on a pages document locally on machine A (offline). After that you make some changes to the old document online from computer B. When computer A reconnects to the Internet iCloud has two file versions. Upon reopening this file, pages will ask you what version to keep.\n\nA: Use the ? icon when in doubt :) \nOptimise Mac Storage works very similar to that in Photos. What is in iCloud remains in iCloud, is synced across devices and is not affected by your choice of keeping documents offline on your devices all the time or downloading them on demand. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205703\n", "Q: Is it possible to rename default directories in the users home folder? Can default folders such as Documents, Downloads, Music, etc be renamed to something else? Like how on a Linux system you could edit user-dirs.dirs?\nThe capitalisation of these direction bugs me as it interferes with my naming convention of everything being lowercase.\n\nA: Basically you can't. If you mainly work with Terminal you can just set symlinks to make the folders also reachable via the names you are used to (ln -s ~/Documents ~/doc etc). This also works for Finder of course, your home directory may just look a bit cluttered then.\n", "Q: Mac OS Catalina 10.15.2 AMPDevicesAgent using 100% CPU Today AMPDevicesAgent started using 100% of my CPU. This is causing the fan to run all the time. \nWhat is AMP Devices Agent\nHow can I stop this\n\nA: I still had this nagging problem on Big Sur, so it does not appear to be fixed (thoroughly). The iPhone entry in my Finder was permanently stuck at about one third and AMPDevicesAgent permanently took more than 99% of one CPU. Although the system remained responsive I noticed the fan blowing and more activity than I expected in the monitor.\nI ended up force quitting AMPDevicesAgent in the activity monitor which removed the iPhone entry from my finder and the activity returned to normal. However I wanted my iPhone to be backed up so I also restarted the finder. This ended up in similarly high CPU usage as before, but AMPDevicesAgent never reached the levels it used to have. After a fairly long period of time (about 20 minutes) and several iPhone unlocks when it appeared to be stuck the process eventually settled down and finished the backup.\nNow my iPhone is backed up and it appears in the finder with the usual information. AMPDevicesAgent is back at 0.1% where it is supposed to be. So all appears to be normal again and I keep my fingers crossed. I only found little info on the subject in the \"usual places\" like StackOverflow an Apple community forums.\n", "Q: My Mac is opening new tabs with different ad sites It all started with the installation of software from mac-torrent but probably it was Adobe Flash Player.

I'm in the process of trying to sell my Macbook Pro (15-inch w/ touch bar, 2018). I found a buyer who gave me a decent offer. I sent the computer to them and upon inspection, said that, and I quote: \n\n\"We have found keyboard paint wear on the screen. This occurs when the\n  screen is still rather hot, and closed. When the keyboard and the\n  screen meets, it causes the screen to wear/burn-in in the shape of the\n  keyboard, thus, leaving a keyboard like imprint on the screen.\"\n\nAs a result, they want to drop the offering price by $150, which seems steep to me.\nNow it's true that I've seen keyboard imprints appear on my screen sometimes after lots of use + travel, but I've always been able to wipe them off with some solution and a cloth. I've never heard of \"keyboard paint wear\", nor can I find anything about it anywhere online. \nSo I can consider if this an actual problem that they're describing, I’d like to ask: is “keyboard paint wear on a screen” a real thing? \n\nA: I would say three things.\n\n\n*\n\n*The most likely cause of any discoloration would be hand grease that transfers via physical contact. That can happen when you have it closed and something is weighted (book or hand) holding the screen glass on the keyboard. Backpacks and briefcases also are excellent ways to compress the gap between glass and keyboards.\n\n*Wear is more likely over many commute sessions than one time “hot” contact, but I probability wouldn’t tell Your buyer they’re “dead wrong” if you want them to negotiate.\n\n*There is an anti glare coating that will wear due to cleaning with solvents and not water as well as with wear over time.\n\n\nTotally your call on if you cleaned it - some people can’t care less about minor scratches and imperfections - others feel they need a brand new machine when they buy used. I have seen this to be very excessive where the $150 is basically you splitting the $300 repair to get new glass installed and others where you can’t even tell this unless you have special lighting, look carefully from an off angle.\nTaking good cell phone photos of the display when lit and black would be a good thing before you send out the mac for inspection if you think the buyer might care about this. Also, you might ask the buyer - hey, how hot do you think the glass got for this? The physics here has nothing to do with heat and all to do with bending and friction and wear patterns.\n", "Q: Problem cloning the startup disk of a MacBook Pro running OS X 10.11.6 El Capitan Before putting my question in detail, see Problem section below, I'd like to sketch the context in which it appears. \nHardware-Software-Environment\nMacBook Pro Early 2015 running OS X 10.11.6 El Capitan.\nThe internal HD is actually a 250 GB SSD comprising partitions EFI,                    Macintosh HD and Recovery HD.\nExternal 2 TB HD connected via USB 3.0 Bus; later on called target disk.\nTask\nCreate a bootable clone of the startup partition and, in addition, of the associated recovery partition.

Select the icon corresponding to the newly created startup partition and initiate the boot process by double-click.\nNow, without any word of consolation, the system boots from the internal Macintosh HD. Obviously the system does not recognize the newly created startup partition as bootable.\nQuestion: What is wrong with the above procedure trying to create a bootable clone? Any advices and suggestions are welcome.\nTest and Fixing Attempts\n\n\n*\n\n*Check and Repair Partitions\nWhen checking the new startup partition diskutil verifyvolume reported:  \nChecking volume information\nInvalid volume free block count\n(It should be 25379769 instead of 23010379)\nVolume header needs minor repair\nThe volume my_mbp2015_macintosh_hd_osx10.11.6_200106 was found corrupt and needs to be repaired\nFile system check exit code is 8\nError: -69845: File system verify or repair failed\nUnderlying error: 8: POSIX reports: Exec format error\n\nThe associated recovery partition, however, is considered OK. \nSubsequent \"repair\" of the startup partition via diskutil repairVolume appears to be successful, at least in the sense that diskutil verifyVolume does not complain any longer. \nUnfortunately this repair attempt finally was not successful because the system still does not recognize the \"repaired\" startup partition as bootable.\n\n*Disk Utility Restore\nWhen we employ the \"Restore\" feature of the GUI Disk Utility with processing step #2 above instead of asr restore, the startup partition and the associated recovery partition appear to be cloned correctly, at least diskutil verifyvolume does not complain and on subsequent start or restart, the system boots from the newly created startup partition if told to do so.\nI'm pretty sure that with Disk Utility \"Restore\"  the command asr restore will be invoked under the hood to do the job. The question then is what else may happen. I guess some additional attribute might be set using the somewhat opaque \"adjust\" option documented like this:\nasr adjust --target <partition> [--settype <partType>]\n\n*External HD\nThe external target HD itself is not considered suspicious because there reside several bootable partitions on the disk from which the system boots  without problems.  \n\n*Start from \"logical\" Macintosh HD Volume\nAs we learned from @klanomath, see below, in our case where the Macintosh HD is a CoreStorage volume, we should take the corresponding logical volume as argument for asr restore --source.    \nSo we run in Recovery Mode:\nasr restore --source /dev/disk2 --target /dev/disk16s6 --erase\n    Validating target...done\n    Validating source...done\n    Erase contents of /dev/disk16s6 \n(/Volumes/my_mbp2015_macintosh_hd_osx10.11.6_200106)? [ny]: y\n\nSource volume is read-write and cannot be unmounted, so it can't be block copied.\n\nIn such cases, some other process may keep the volume Macintosh HD volume busy. Try to address the problem, unmount the volume running diskutil unmount and rerun asr restore with the same parameter settings as before.  \n\n*Side Trip: Figuring out the Logical Startup Volume\nA reliable, while not „scriptable“, way: Immediately after logging in to      an account start the GUI Disk Utilitiy. You will find the startup volume highlighted. Enter ⌘I to see the same volume information as otherwise displayed by the diskutil info command.  \nIn this particular case where the startup volume is actually a (mounted) CoreStorage partition, we can determine the corresponding logical volume from the diskutil coreStorage list output: \nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 9344A028-DD9F-454C-89C0-8E2866E5FBB6\n=========================================================\nName:         Macintosh HD\nStatus:       Online\nSize:         250140434432 B (250.1 GB)\nFree Space:   8921088 B (8.9 MB)\n|\n+-< Physical Volume EC0BB005-738C-4F32-8B27-BA8801EBC34D\n|   ----------------------------------------------------\n|   Index:    0\n|   Disk:     disk0s2\n|   Status:   Online\n|   Size:     250140434432 B (250.1 GB)\n|\n+-> Logical Volume Family A20BC6DA-C477-44B4-82C9-C88B2CB41658\n    ----------------------------------------------------------\n    Encryption Type:         None\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume 73C52081-F8CF-4C86-93F9-4BBA68602854\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        Disk:                  disk1\n        Status:                Online\n        Size (Total):          249779191808 B (249.8 GB)\n        Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)\n        LV Name:               Macintosh HD\n        Volume Name:           Macintosh HD\n        Content Hint:          Apple_HFS  \n\nSurprisingly, the most obvious method failed: bless --getBoot --verbose (--verbose option just added to have somewhat more information)\nEFI found at IODeviceTree:/efi\nCurrent EFI boot device string is: '<array><dict><key>IOMatch</key><dict><key>IOProviderClass</key><string>IOMedia</string><key>IOPropertyMatch</key><dict><key>UUID</key><string>56173D2D-142D-4425-AA07-DC6762337E8C</string></dict></dict><key>BLLastBSDName</key><string>disk10s3</string></dict></array>'\nBoot option is 8BE4DF61-93CA-11D2-AA0D-00E098032B8C:Boot0080\nProcessing boot option 'Mac OS X'\nBoot device path incorrect\nBoot option does not match XML representation\nXML representation doesn't match true boot preference\n\nResetting the NVRAM fixed the problem.

Only the innermost objects (logical volumes) export to additional device nodes. Further reading: CoreStorage.\nIf you asr --source ... a CS partition (in your case disk0s2) to a target partition, you will not get a proper bootable file system (e.g. a bootable HFS+ volume). The simple reason: a CS partition has no traditional file system and a different internal structure compared to an HFS+ boot volume.\nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of asr --sourcing a disk slice simply use the exported logical volume.\nThere is no easy way to get the device node of the mounted logical volume of the SSD automatically (i.e. to use it in a shell script). diskutil list or diskutil cs list list it, but it's difficult to extract the device node with tools available in Recovery Mode (with e.g. awk ... or sed ...) - at least for me with limited shell scripting capability. The best I have found is bless --getBoot. The default boot volume has to be the internal SSD before booting to Recovery Mode (with the option key or cmd-R) - compellingly! You can also set the start volume to the internal SSD in Recovery Mode.\nOn the command line (in Recovery Mode) the asr command would look like this then:\nCSB=$(bless --getBoot); asr restore --source $CSB --target target_device_node --erase\n\nIf you get the error Source volume is read-write and cannot be unmounted after executing the asr ... command, try to unmount $CSB after defining the variable CSB: diskutil umount $CSB.\nYou will get a bootable HFS+ volume on a type HFS+ partition on the target disk finally.  \n\n*If method 1 fails you can also use the mountpoint of the SSD's system volume (e.g. Macintosh HD):\nasr restore --source /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD --target target_device_node --erase\n\n\nI tried to asr blockcopy the CoreStorage source partition (disk0s2) to a target partition with the same size using different methods but all fail with a checksum error. These methods require to modify the partition type of the target partition with gpt afterwards.\n\nA: Here I just put a re-worked version of the Basic Procedure section in the original question.

I have a MacBook 10.1 with a shot battery. The screen is broken so I am using it strictly as a media/AirPlay server to my TV and have no plans to fix the battery whatsoever. I would really like to recover the performance on this.\nI have tried the remedies in other posts and the problem is there is no plist file with my MacBook model. One user mentioned letting the computer go into \"default power saving mode naturally\". But what does this mean? Can it be made into a script?\nFinally – I heard that w/o the battery GPU is also curtailed. Is that true and can there be a holistic fix for all of this?\n\nA: The CPU throttling due to battery is triggered by the firmware and it doesn't make any difference what version of macOS (or other OS) you are running.\nHowever it is easy to override the throttling on a MacBook if you use Windows as a OS but not if you run macOS.  If you don't want to replace the battery and the programs you want to run are available on Windows that would be the easiest/cheapest option.\n\nI have a late 2012 MacBook Pro with a i5-3210 CPU which has a base clock of 2.5 GHz and max Turbo of 3.2 GHz.  It has no battery as it swelled too much to fit in the case so I removed it.  Like you I've no intention of getting a replacement and so in macOS the CPU is now throttled to 1.2 GHz.  \nWith Intel Power Gadget you can easily see it.\n\nThe reason for this is that the EFI firmware sets on BD PROCHOT which is a CPU register (msr 0x1FC) usually used to tell the CPU that some other component (GPU or whatever) is overheating.  This will cause the CPU to throttle even though it is not itself overheating.  This is described in Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 4: Model-Specific Registers\nAlthough there are various macOS utilities to change other MSR (such as Turbo Boost Switcher) I can find no way to turn this one off in macOS.  This is quite surprising as people facing throttling due to removed batteries is a fairly common issue.  I tried to write an EFI program to do this myself but could not get it to work - see Stack Overflow question How to make changes to msr 0x199 from EFI stick?. \n\nOn Windows however there is a program called ThrottleStop which easily lets you turn off BD PROCHOT. As you can see with it set on (as it is by the MacBook firmware) the clock is limited to 1.2 GHz.\n\nIf you turn off BD PROCHOT and set the multiplier to 25 you can get the 2.5 GHz.\n\nIn theory it is possible that at peak load you could take more power than the power adapter alone can supply resulting in a shutdown.  This is perhaps the reason Apple set this register on.  However this has never happened to me and I've been running it like this almost 24*7 for the last couple of years.  \nIf you did find it was shutting down you can set the multiplier to a lower number to reduce peak power draw.  You can even set a higher multiplier for increased performance if you wish but I never felt the need.\n\nA: This solved it for me on a MacBook Pro mid-2014, macOS Catalina 10.15.3:\nBefore using it, I removed IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext from /System/Library/Extensions (moved it to my user folder). So I don't know if only the NoBatteryNoProblem should solve it. Also, I don't know if it needs to be run at every boot (haven't rebooted yet).\nhttps://github.com/bernardowilson/NoBatteryNoProblem.kext\nI did a fork in case the repo is removed:\nhttps://github.com/luismramirezr/NoBatteryNoProblem.kext\nIt appears that this also disables TurboBoost, so your CPU will consume more power (doesn't matter as there is no battery) and produce more heat (watch out for actual ThermalThrottling from inside CPU to be activated).\n\nA: I have done a blogpot here on how to solve this https://portugnole.blogspot.com/2020/05/running-macbook-without-battery-lets-go.html \nI added the code to remove the PROCHOT signal into CPUTune. You can find the project on github here: https://github.com/syscl/CPUTune\nAll this works on Catalina.\n\nA: Changing BD PROCHOT did not seem to work for me on an early 2015 MacBook Air with a missing battery. What did work though was requesting a different Target Performance State Value using the IA32_PERF_CTL (0x199) MSR as suggested in this GitHub comment.\nThe exact value you need to write does not seem to be officially documented. The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manual states that:\n\nThe 16-bit encoding that defines valid operating points is model-specific. Applications and performance tools are\nnot expected to use either IA32_PERF_CTL or IA32_PERF_STATUS and should treat both as reserved.\n\nHowever, from what I found online, it seems that the first byte is usually the requested CPU multiplier, and the second byte is always 0. You may want to verify that this matches what your machine does before proceeding.\nIf you want to change this value yourself, follow these steps. Confirmed to work on Big Sur.\nDisclaimer: Changing settings like these, especially using interfaces as low-level as directly writing MSR registers has a potential to damage your computer. Proceed at your own risk.\n\n*\n\n*Download VoltageShift from https://github.com/sicreative/VoltageShift.

I don't think it will let you exceed the range of valid values, but I never tested it.\n\n\n\nThe changes are reverted after a reboot, so you shouldn't need to be too worried about changing anything permanently. Figuring out how to apply them on boot is left as an exercise to the reader (mostly because I didn't bother to do it myself yet)\nNote that I did not yet figure out if and how is the GPU throttled.\n\nA: I made a KEXT which writes to the IA32_HWP_REQUEST MSR to fix this exact issue.\nLink to the TurboMac repository on GitHub.\nAs of writing this it's still in a pre-release state so if there are any issues please report them.\n\nA: I rewrote NoBatteryNoProblem.kext and made it auto load at boot time.  I don't have to do something more dangerous as instructed in this article.  It seems CPU/GPU will still be throttled again after wake-up from system sleep/hibernation or when it becomes really hot, but I think a hard limit like this is good.  To prevent system sleep you can run launchctl submit -l caffeinate -- caffeinate -s to keep caffeinate running in the background, and stop it by launchctl remove caffeinate.  Of course this only works on some Intel Core CPUs.\n", "Q: Pool multiple drives into a single network share in macOS 10.14 or later I have a mac fileserver with multiple drives that I'd like to combine into a single pool (such that the filesystems appear to be combined together) and then have accessible as a network share, preferably using SMB.\nThe sort of drive pooling I'm after is similar to what's possible with filesystems like UnionFS, mergerfs, or mhddfs in Linux, or what can be accomplished specifically as a network share with something like Greyhole.\nEdit: I should note that I need the drives to remain accessible as separate volumes so that I can protect their data using snapraid.\nI've already found this question from earlier: Pool Multiple Hard Drives in ONE network Share\n...but its answers are over five years old now and don't work in modern versions of macOS.

Otherwise occasionally moving folders around in the share would trigger strange errors in the Finder.\nI did also discover that it's possible to build, install and utilize unionfs-fuse on macOS with FUSE for macOS. However I certain operations in the Finder would fail with it, and I wasn't able to find a way to fix that. However read operations seemed to work fine, so it might be a better solution for people that just want a read-only union of several drives since it doesn't require a virtual machine.\nEdit April 14, 2022:\nSince writing this answer, unionfs-fuse has improved its mac support considerably. I've started using it and it's working great, including sharing its mount point using macOS's built in smb server. I consider this to be a superior solution to my original one as it doesn't require running a virtual machine, and performs far better, especially when interacting with folders containing a large number of files.\n", "Q: environment variable not showing after set I am trying to set permanent environmental variable in my mac machine\nI have tried following steps till now - \n\n\n*\n\n*vi ~/.bash_profile\n\n*adding my variable \nexport JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home\nexport ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-sdk\nexport ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/usr/local/share/android-sdk\n\n\n*restarted the bash\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nFor current terminal its loaded the variable, but if I open another terminal \nits not showing newly added variable if I check with printenv.\nHow can I make bash set the variables?\n\nA: For newly created accounts Catalina uses zsh instead of bash, so you need to add the lines to the appropriate file (probably ~/.zshenv to make sure it's read in all cases).\n", "Q: How to edit m4b audiobook metadata in Catalina?

My safari is consistently shown using significant energy on my menu. In my activity monitor, I noticed there are many apps running behind my safari despite only opening 4 tabs: mailbox, youtube, google and apple stack exchange. Is there any way to remove the apps shown running as shown in the screenshot and to prevent safari from using significant energy? \n\nA: First off, the high number is the average energy impact, not the current.\nThis is in line with what you say you currently have open: merely 4 tabs.\nSince I don't know what you have been doing before, I can't tell you exactly what might have caused this energy impact. But there is quite some cached Safari web content (Safari is using too much RAM. How can I reduce its memory footprint?, quite old though).\nProbably the easiest way to solve the issue is to (force) quit Safari (Activity Monitor → Safari → in the left upper corner X → Quit/Force Quit) and restart your MacBook Pro.\nIf the problem persists try to delete web page cache with Safari → Preferences → Privacy → Advanced → Show Develop menu in menu bar, then in the menu bar at the top Develop -> Empty Caches. \nYou can also follow this guide, it also explains how to delete cookies:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/clear-safari-cache-3496193/\nNote: Flash Player is a notoriously bad extension (slow and unsecure).

You need to move into the repo that you want to act on, i.e. cd ~/Desktop/Tools/Git/MyFolder, or a subdirectory of this, and then run git status.\nYou've created the home.html file in ~.\nYou must have run git init on your home directory or a parent of it, i.e. /Users/adam, /Users, or /.

So I’ve owned the MacBook Pro for about a year or so, upon looking at a list of ways to keep a a laptop healthy; was this operation in particular that stood out. To manufacture reset annually. I then circle around to my question(s), what if I were to reset my MacBook and not for selling? Would I still need to sign out of all accounts, being that I would be logging right back in after doing so? Also being this early in stages of ownership, should this be in option?\nI have been really neurotic about keeping it clean and healthy since I’ve tarnished many PCs and traumatized by the aftermath. \nAny glimpse of help of info pointing me in the right direction of approaching this would help! Thanks you in all in advance \n\nA: Resetting your MacBook Pro to factory settings each year definitely should not be necessary. I do not personally experience any performance problems or functionality problems even though I haven't \"reset\" in a decade (i.e. I migrate my existing system over when I buy new hardware).\nIf you do chose to factory reset, which I wouldn't recommend, you would need to sign into iCloud again after reinstalling. If you have your Keychain synced to iCloud, you don't need to start from scratch in amassing passwords and logins. However, you would probably need to login into various stuff once again (like for example login to Adobe subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, mail subscriptions, etc.).\n\nA: MacOS does not need any user 'maintenance', under normal operation. You don't need to clean, restore, reset, wipe or purge anything. No oil change required after 10,000 miles.\nThere are two main reasons why your Mac might start to slow down or crash, etc: Running out of disk space; and third-party software that is no longer compatible with newer OS versions. \nMake sure you keep around 15-20% of your disk as free space; and keep everything up-to-date and be slightly conservative about what you install.\n", "Q: Which version of iOS causes Messages.app to combine message threads with a single contact with multiple different phone numbers into one?

Now, however, iOS appears to combine the conversations from both numbers into a single message thread because it recognises that despite being separate physical phone numbers, the contact is still the same person.\nSo - my question. Would somebody be able to clarify which version of iOS introduced the new behaviour described above?\n\nA: The merging of message-threads with the same contact was introduced in iOS 12.

Looking at a web page, a high definition (5K) painting and a text editor, I couldn't see much difference.  Both look pretty good.  Should I expect any difference?.  Does the CPU/GPU need to do any extra work to accommodate one port over the other?  I should probably check with Total War Warhammer 2 too, as that's a pretty demanding game graphically.\nNo intent to do monitor chaining, btw.\n\nA: No\nFreesync sometimes isn't supported over HDMI, but this monitor supports it.

So I want the script to complete once, pop up a choice of \"Repeat?\" or \"Done!\", and then repeat, including the pop-up, until the user chooses \"Done\".\nI don't know how to code the repeat.

BBEdit has a full scripting dictionary designed for working with text; I've modified your code to use it.\nAll you need is a repeat loop, and then a conditional exit repeat, as follows:\n-- first find or create a text doc called 'Transcription.txt,' and select it\ntell application \"BBEdit\"\n    set target_doc_list to every document whose name is \"Transcription.txt\"\n    if (count of target_doc_list) is 0 then\n        set target_doc to make new text document with properties {name:\"Transcription.txt\"}\n    else\n        set target_doc to item 1 of target_doc_list\n    end if\n    select target_doc\nend tell\n\n-- repeat loop to run through Safari pages\nrepeat\n    tell application \"Safari\"\n        set page_title to (name of current tab of front window)\n        set page_text to (text of current tab of front window)\n        close current tab of front window without saving\n    end tell\n    tell application \"BBEdit\"\n        tell window 1\n            set end of contents of first text document to return & return & page_text & return & return\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\n    tell application \"Safari\"\n        set next_page_title to (name of current tab of front window)\n    end tell\n\n    set theAlertText to \"Finished with page \" & page_title & \".

It then asks if you want to repeat with the next tab, exiting the loop if you say 'Quit'\nYou could modify this easily enough to skip over tabs, or to select the tabs to process in advance. Let me know if you want variations of that sort.\n\nA: You can just put everything into a repeat statement, which will continually loop unless you specify otherwise - quitting the dialog will cancel it and the script.

So it may be a good step to check if your company can get a D-U-N-S number assigned (you can learn more about D-U-N-S by searching the Web).\nIt goes without saying that you should be legally able to incorporate and run the business of your company from the said territory, and from the business point of view, all Apple would see is the territory where the company is incorporate and operated from.\nSo, while I am not a lawyer, but if things can be taken care of within regulations, and Apple does business in the territory, you'd be fine.\n\nBetter can I have a company account without being a company?\n\nThis is neither possible nor an advisable thing to think towards. Apple has a strict verification process in place, and using any loopholes may lead to Apple revoking the developer program membership.\n\nThe app is for free and I probably will not make any money with it anyway.\n\nApparently it's the kind of app which requires a company to be incorporated and can't be \"sold\" on the App Store by an individual. You need to pay the program membership fee even if you \"sell\" the app for free. The fee is charged towards the cost incurred by Apple for maintaining the entire App Store infrastructure.\n", "Q: How to replace icon view with list view on an iPhone's home page? I dislike selecting programs or other files from a grid of icons (\"icon view\"), even if their titles are shown beneath the icons.

The charger is new and 85 Watt.\nI have two issues. When I first connected the charger, there was 54% charge on the laptop and for only 1 second the green light of the magsafe turned on. I have seen no more light [orange/green] after that ever.\nAnd, the pc is not receiving any charge when the power cable is connected.  I have different brightness set for battery/power. When I connect the adapter, the brightness changes, the charging sign in the battery shows.

It seems to me the connection is okay [as brightness changes]. But somehow laptop doesnt take the charge. Not sure what to do. And, do not know why the green light turned only once and never again in the MagSafe.\n\n\nA: The first thing you should do is examine and clean the MagSafe connector, both on the cord and on the machine. MagSafe's have five spring loaded pins; if one of the pins is stuck, or grime is blocking a connection, that can cut the power output of the cord, meaning the computer will run but the battery won't charge. Apple says:\n\nTo clean the MagSafe connector and pin area, disconnect the adapter\n  from the wall outlet and from the computer. Remove debris gently with\n  a cotton swab or a soft bristle toothbrush. Be careful not to get any\n  cotton fibers stuck in the pin receptacle and to not bend or otherwise\n  damage any of the pins. (see: MagSafe Troubleshooting)\n\nFailing that, this likely needs repair.\nThe MagSafe board is inexpensive and relatively quick to replace. Next is the battery and all cables, most expensive and difficult to exchange is the logic board.\nYou would want to replace parts one by one until the hardware issue is resolved. \nResetting the SMC is a once every 6 months thing, if you do that more often it’s hardware repair that’s needed.\n", "Q: How to change the main user name of a used MacBook on macOS 10.13?

Performance will be different though.\nFor example with bindfs, you can easily provide an extra read-only mount point for you RAM-disk like this:\nbindfs --perms=a-w MyMountPoint MyReadOnlyMountPoint.\n\n\nA: Theoretical answer! - I will update this answer if I find an appropriate tool...or some hidden option in diskutil or apfs.util.\nIn theory it's very easy to create such a read-only shadow: use the snapshot feature of APFS and mount the snapshot read-only:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an APFS RAMDisk:\ndiskutil partitionDisk $(hdiutil attach -nomount ram://1048576) 1 GPTFormat APFS 'RAMDisk' '100%'\n\n\n*Create an APFS snapshot of the current state of the RAMDisk\n\n*Get the name of this APFS snapshot\n\n*Mount this APFS snapshot read-only\n\n\nHowever, the tools to create such a snapshot are missing; or better: only some tools like tmutil or ccc (and probably some forensic apps) can create APFS snapshots.\n", "Q: What is the best method of locking a kids ipad to a particular app? I would like my children to have unlimited access to a Sonos device in their room so as to listen to Pandora or Audible audiobooks or whatever.\nHowever, controlling Sonos requires a device with an app and I don't want my children on the web or using apps, etc.  I would like to lock the tablet to only the Sonos app.\nI see two methods of doing this - Guided Access and Single App Mode.\nGuided Access appears to be just what I am looking for - and further, is described by Sonos as the correct way to do this:\nhttps://support.sonos.com/s/article/3167?language=en_US\n... however, all you have to do to jump out of guided access is force reboot the ipad with power+home for 15 seconds and you get a freshly rebooted ipad, and are not locked in the guided access app.  It is my understanding that the latest versions of iOS behave that way ... and my kids will figure that out in an hour.\nWhat about \"single app mode\" ?  I think this is also known as \"kiosk mode\" ?\nI think you need to have a MDM account and a controller system and ... that's not something I'm going to setup for my two kids at home, right ?  Should I just ignore \"single app mode\" and pretend it doesn't exist ?\nAll this to ask:\nHow can I lock the ipad to a particular app and not have it trivially (laughably) easy to break out ?\nThanks.\n\nA: The Guided Access method is the one that is usually suitable for home usage. It is, as you describe, easy to break out of if you want.\nIf you want to protect against reboot breaking out of Guided Access, then \"Single App Mode\" is the way to go. In contrary to what you write, it is not necessary to have an MDM system for that to work.\nAll you need to do is download the free app \"Apple Configurator 2\" from the App Store on a Mac. Connect the iPad with a cable, and select the iPad in Apple Configurator 2.\nIf this is the first time you use Apple Configurator 2 with the iPad, you'll  want to click the \"Prepare\" button in the top bar. You'll want to choose to prepare with \"Manual Configuration\". Do not add to device enrollment program or add MDM. Choose also that you want to \"Supervise devices\".\nNOTE: THIS WILL ERASE ALL CONTENT AND SETTINGS ON YOUR DEVICE.\nWhen this step is done, your iPad will behave like a new app. You'll want to connect to the WiFi again and install the Sonos app. When everything is ready, connect the iPad to the Mac again and start up Apple Configurator 2.\nFrom the menu bar choose Actions, then Advanced and then \"Start Single App Mode\". You'll then be presented with a list, where you need to choose the Sonos app.\nThis will keep the iPad in the Sonos app even after reboots. You'll need to connect the iPad to the Mac and use Apple Configurator 2 again to disable Single App Mode again. The option is again found in the Actions menu under Advanced.\n", "Q: How to create a custom iPhone ringtone using MacOS 10.15 Catalina? How can I create and upload a custom iPhone ringtone using MacOS 10.15 Catalina?\nI have tried to follow the advice given for uploading ringtones applicable to older versions of MacOS, where iTunes was available, substituting the replacement Music program instead, but I don't seem to be able to drag or open the .m4r file that I have created into Music, nor drag it onto my iPhone in the Finder.\nIs there still some way to convert other audio files into ringtones and upload them to iPhones when using MacOS 10.15 Catalina?\n\nA: 'Create ringtone' part for Catalina (and older macos versions as well) is pretty simple and straightforward if you are comfortable with terminal. \nMacOs comes with built-in afconvert. For example, to convert mp3 file 'mysound.mp3' to ringtone (.m4r file) mysoundringtone.m4r:\nafconvert -f m4af -d aac mysound.mp3 mysoundringtone.m4r\n\nNeed to be in same directory with source file or pass path along with filename(s).\n'Upload part': one can connect iPhone to computer and drag-and-drop ringtone file to iTunes while it's on iPhone 'General' tab. After that locate newly created ringtone on iPhone in Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Ringtone (above built-in ringtones, separated by line). \n", "Q: Brightness up/F2 button stopped working on my 2014 rMBP Sometime in the last week or two, the F2 button stopped working.. F1 (decrease screen brightness) still works, but not F2.\nIs there any kind of fix for this, or is the button broken for good?\n\nA: Are you 100% certain that this is a hardware fault?\nThe best way to verify this is to find an application that allows you to set a keyboard shortcut and try pressing the fn + F1 key if this works then try setting it again with the broken key fn + F2.\nIf this doesn't work it strongly suggests your keyboard button is actually broken, in which case you would need to take it in to a repair center for diagnosis.\nCould you tell us more about the exact model you have so we could advise if there are any open repair programs, all MacBooks with the new style butterfly keyboard are under a keyboard repair programme, if you have one of these it might be a free repair.\n", "Q: Can Mac Preview be set to default to save image as JPEG Preview defaults to saving as PNG.  I can change PNG to JPEG, but I have to do it every time.\nIs there a way to change the default behaviour?\nIs there a way to change the default save/export format in Preview? basically doesn't answer the question, but says that Preview saves it in the form it came in.  Well, sort of.  If I'm browsing google images, and right-click copy image, even though it's a jpeg image originally, when you past as new selection, it will default to save as PNG.\nHow can the default save format be changed for OS X Preview app? gives two solutions for someone who wants to save as PDF -- one using a python script, and two using a shortcut key mapped to export as PDF.\nNeither of these solutions is workable.\nA:  In many cases I have a bunch of intermediate steps, editing the image in Preview.  Most images will have a crop, a resize, and an annotate.  I suppose in principle the python script could be modified to save the current buffer in preview as a jpeg after I've done the others, but I don't yet speak python.\nB:  The command shortcut doesn't work, as there is no menu command for \"Save as JPEG\"  Instead the Save menu item opens a modal dialog that requires the input of a name (since New->From Clipboard makes a file with the name \"untitled-N\") and every time a click on the ribbon control at the bottom of the dialog box to move to JPEG\n\nA: No easy preference or key is known to change the defaults. Barring a new discovery, plan to use a different app or script image conversion with automation. \nYou probably already know you could make a keyboard shortcut if an Apple menu to save as JPEG existed, but that’s the crux here. Other questions here have useful details on automation and using python to process the clipboard instead of preview. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to change the default save/export format in Preview?\n\n*How can the default save format be changed for OS X Preview app?\n\nA: As a workaround, the following example AppleScript code, shown further below, will do a Save As… and select JPEG and can be used in an Automator Service with a Run AppleScript action and a keyboard shortcut assigned to it in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nFor testing purposes, in macOS High Sierra, I used: ⇧⌘J \nNOTE: This may also require giving Preview accessibility privileges for this to work properly.\ntell application \"Preview\" to activate\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Preview\"\n    click menu item \"Save As…\" of menu \"File\" of menu bar item \"File\" of menu bar 1\n    click pop up button 2 of sheet 1 of window 1\n    click menu item \"JPEG\" of menu 1 of pop up button 2 of sheet 1 of window 1\n    set value of value indicator 1 of slider 1 of sheet 1 of window 1 to 0.9\n    click button \"Save\" of sheet 1 of window 1\nend tell\n\n    • The value of value indicator 1 is a decimal value from 0.0 to 1.0.\n    • You may need to use some delay commands, e.g. delay 0.2 between lines as needed.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

I have my phone connected to a Bluetooth auxiliary adapter in my vehicle. Sometimes I have the audio source set to something else like CD or FM radio. The problem with this then is I hear no audio output when I need to use Siri. Is there a way to force Siri to use iPhone speaker by default even when connected to Bluetooth? I have an iPhone X. \n\nA: No, you can't direct Siri to a different output than the default output.\nIf your iPhone is connected via bluetooth to your car stereo then that's where sounds will be directed.\nYour options are to disconnect bluetooth from your car stereo or upgrade to a CarPlay-enabled head unit.\n", "Q: Can you hide/disable the internal SDD blade in an iMac (originally Fusion)? The 128GB SSD internal to my mid 2015 iMac's original fusion drive setup died, and can not be acted upon by Disk Utility (can't mount, repair, etc). The original setup has already been split into two separate drives, so all files are on the larger internal. Unfortunately, the dead drive appears to periodically cause random reboots, with an error saying I shut down my computer because of a problem. How can I stop the computer from seeing this drive entirely?\nOther information:\n• I looked at a similar question here, but I can not reformat the drive as free space as recommended. Simply setting hard drives to sleep when possible did not work\n• I don't believe I can use fstabs because I can't get a UUID from diskutil. Although, I have seen usage of the LABEL identifier in the fstabs file. Could this help?\n• I'm currently running Catalina, but I might be open to others.\n\nA: I'd suggest this a hardware problem: you'd be best served by finding a local independent Apple repair company, and asking them to replace the SSD with a new/secondhand Apple unit.  \nThey'd be experienced at taking it apart and would charge a reasonable price. An Apple Store might say it's too old, or charge a lot.\nThe same modules are used across Apple's hardware of a similar age, so you should be able to get a larger size -- 512; 1Tb. (Don't Fuse with the HDD!) \nIf your OS is on the HDD, that's massively limiting the performance of your iMac.\n", "Q: Wrong keys on internal Swedish keyboard A few weeks ago I had a problem with the § and < keys being \"mixed up in software\" on my external Windows keyboard, (the keys are in the right locations physically).

I am running macOS Mojave 10.14.6 and I want to run an application which was made only for Catalina. I have downloaded “Noto” from the Mac App Store on another Mac (Running Catalina) and copied it on my flash drive. I did it using MY AppleID. \nWhen I run it on Mojave it doesn’t start. It says that I have an incompatible macOS version. \n\n\n*\n\n*I tried to edit .plst file in the package contents\n\n*I tried to run it through terminal\n\n\nThe app is not so popular so I can’t just download a .dmg .\n\nA: In a word, No\nThere are differences in macOS versions, and if an app says \"macOS Catalina or later\" it means that it requires something that is specific to, introduced in and not in earlier versions of macOS.\nFor example if you have an app that requires macOS High Sierra or greater it will also (likely) work on Mojave and Catalina too, but not on Sierra.\nSo, sorry, but that app was written to use a feature of Catalina that is just not there in previous versions of macOS.\nYou could contact the developer and ask if it is possible but I would bet no.\n\nA: You're in luck. The \"Noto\" app is open-source and available outside the Mac App Store in a version compatible with your Mojave system.\nYou can download the DMG here:\nhttps://www.brunophilipe.com/software/noto/releases/noto-1.2.dmg\nUPDATE: In the comments I learn that you're not looking for the app named \"Noto\", but rather an app named \"Noto - Elegant Note\" on the App Store, and \"Noto.ink\" elsewhere. That particular app is not made from the ground up for macOS - instead it is their iOS app that they have converted to macOS using Catalyst. Catalyst is only available on Catalina or later, so you have no way of running that app on Mojave unfortunately.\n\nA: You could use something like Parallels to run a Catalina or Big Sur virtual machine on your Mac, and run the app in the virtual machine.\nVirtualize got an older “guest” OS on a newer “host” OS often works to reach very far into the past. Often, you can also virtualize a newer “guest” on an older “host” but that sometimes works for one or two versions instead of tens of jumps.\n\nA: An Operating System is (crudely) a set of features for developers to use in their applications. The apps use these features when they are executed. \nNew OS versions introduce new features that devs can take advantage of in new apps.\nIf the feature isn't in the OS, the app can't use it, and so can't run. \n", "Q: dyld: Library not loaded: on OSX I just got a new MacBook Pro, installed Catalina, and used the Migration Assistant to transfer my files over to the new machine.

(Without restoring it to another iPhone.) \nThe backup is encrypted, and I know the password.\nThe backup is of an iPhone 5s. \n\nA: iExplorer, which runs on macOS and Windows, can open iPhone backups. You need to know the password if the backup has been encrypted. \nDisclaimer: I’m a satisfied customer of MacroPlant LLC, and have no financial or other ties. \n\nA: iBackup Extractor is another solution which can access encrypted backups (you'll need to enter your encryption password). You can browse your backup content and extract 20 items with the free trial (further extractions require a purchased licence).\nThe extracted files are copied out to your Mac, so you don't need to restore the backup to your iPhone.\n", "Q: If a photo is imported to Aperture via Photo Stream, is it safe to delete it from iCloud?

Same problem. DI hangs at a certain point and that's it. \nI boot into single user mode.\nUsing df -h I see that the MacIntosh HD Data volume is /dev/disk2s1.\nI try to type:\nfsck_apfs -y /dev/disk2s1\n\nand I get this:\n\nerror: device is unreadable because you are in single user mode.\n\nI try the same command from normal boot and I get\n\nerror: container /dev/rdisk1 is mounted with write access.\n\nI have done this thousands of times before, from single user mode. This is some Catalina crap.\nHow do I do that now on Catalina?\n\nA: Correction\nApple's official word is that the traditional single-user mode which one enters by booting whilst holding ⌘S is deprecated on macOS Mojave (10.14) and later. This is due to the presence of the Apple T2 security chip in Macs which initially went to market with Mojave or later.\nFrom Mac startup key combinations:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Command-S: Start up in single-user mode. Disabled in macOS Mojave or later, or when using a firmware password.\n  \n\nAnd from the small print on the linked \"single-user mode\" page, Start up your Mac in single-user mode or verbose mode:\n\nThese steps replace the Command-S method, which doesn't work with the recommended settings on current Mac computers.\n\nThe linked page \"current Mac computers\" refers to those which have a T2 chip.\nDespite the claim that the traditional single-user mode is outright disabled on Mojave and later, you can still boot into it using ⌘S on devices which don't have a T2 chip, even if you attempt to do so on a system running Mojave or later. However, this single-user mode will require access to the data and VM volumes of the APFS container that contains the OS, and you will find that you are unable to unmount these volumes in order to run fsck_apfs -y on that container. This is because umount will refuse to unmount the volumes due to them being actively used, and you cannot forcibly unmount them using diskutil since the DiskManagement framework required by diskutil is not loaded/present in this mode — and even if this were possible in some other way, it is unadvisable to forcibly unmount elements of a filesystem that you are trying to repair!\nHaving said that, macOS still technically has a single-user mode in Mojave and later: the Terminal in macOS Recovery. After actually trying to use fsck_apfs -y in this environment, it turns out that it is possible, but you will first need to unmount any mounted APFS volumes belonging to the APFS container that contains the OS; macOS Recovery will automatically mount the data and VM volumes by default. Because macOS Recovery isn't as stripped down as the traditional single-user mode, you can do this simply with e.g. diskutil unmountDisk disk2. You can use mount and diskutil apfs list to determine the device nodes.\n\nOriginal answer\nThis isn't a Catalina thing, but an APFS thing. You cannot perform reparatory actions on an APFS container (or any of its volumes, since this requires acting on the container) when that container is mounted. If any volume in that container is mounted, then the container itself is necessarily also mounted.\nAs such, you cannot use fsck_apfs -y on the APFS partition that you have booted from, whether that's in a regular environment, in single-user mode, in recovery mode, or however else. You can still run fsck_apfs -nl when booted normally to inspect the APFS partition for errors, but this will not repair any such errors.\nTo run fsck_apfs -y on your Catalina APFS partition, you must access could also try accessing the disk another way, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*booting into Catalina Internet Recovery (which also requires you to unmount the automatically mounted volumes).\n\n*booting from a Catalina USB installer.\n\n*booting your Mac in Target Disk Mode and connecting it to a secondary Mac running Catalina, then running fsck_apfs from the secondary Mac on the affected disk.\n\n*physically removing the disk from your Mac and connecting it to a secondary Mac running Catalina, then running fsck_apfs from the secondary Mac on the affected disk.\n\n\nSince new, significant APFS features were introduced in Catalina (\"volume groups\" in particular), avoid using any fsck_apfs belonging to an older macOS version, particularly if you are trying to repair incorrectly allocated disk space. fsck_apfs(8) states for the -o option:\n\n-o — Repair overallocations; please do not run an older fsck_apfs on newer systems with this option.\n\n\nA: In addition to what else has been said, when working with an encrypted volume, you'd have to unlock the volume without mounting it.\nFind the drive / volume:\n# diskutil apfs list\n...\n      Volume diskXsY\n      FileVault:    Yes (Locked)\n...\n\nUnlock without mounting:\n# diskutil apfs unlockVolume /dev/diskXsY -nomount\n...\nUnlocked but did not mount APFS Volume\n\nVerify that unlocking succeeded for all volumes:\n# diskutil apfs list\n...\n      Volume diskXsY\n      FileVault:    Yes (Unlocked)\n...\n\n", "Q: Don't see the option to select my mobile number in 'Send & Receive' option of iMessage [iOS 13.3 iPhone 11] I recently got a new iPhone 11 and have inserted the sim as part of the setup. Whenever I send text messages to a person, they see my email ID instead of my phone number.\nI went to Settings > iMessage > Send & Receive but I do not see my phone number there and just see my apple Id. Same for my FaceTime settings. No one is able to FaceTime me using my number and they can do it through only email Id. \nI have also verified my phone number under Settings > iCloud > Name, Phone Numbers & Email and I do see my phone number added there.\nI checked this similar question but as the answer suggests, I have already waited for more than 24 hours. Also checked Apple's support article but still no luck: https://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT201422\nI can see that a good number of people have faced this issue and can see posts across the internet but nothing seems to be working for me. I have also verified that my carrier does let me send and receive SMS.\n\nA: Turns out that for activating iMessage and FaceTime, Apple sends a text message to an international number and my phone plan did not not include international texts.

These are iPhone 11s, running iOS 13.3, managed via a MDM solution that pushes VPP device licences to DEP managed devices that are enrolled into the MDM.\nAll sets up well and fine, and the user can take a fully deployed iPhone and sign into the MDM solution's management app, and then the Apple App Store works just fine. All the apps we push appear as expected and the iPhones work as expected.\nHowever, some users are prompted daily for their (managed company) Apple ID if any application updates are pending for the apps that were pushed to their phone using VPP (Just to be clear, the user is being asked for their own managed Apple ID, not another person's Apple ID or the VPP token details).\nIt looks like this is related to automatic app updates, as these prompts cease if this is turned off in iPhone Settings app → iCloud → iTunes & App Store → Automatic Downloads → App Updates.\nExpected behaviour should be to update the apps without the user having to sign in again.\nNote that the VPP apps are correctly licenced to the device, and its possible to deploy a device, hand it to a user who does not sign in to the App Store, and app updates are pushed just fine.\n\nA: If anyone else experiences a similar issue, I've just had a discussion with Apple and they have confirmed this is an issue in iOS 13 and that it is fixed in iOS 13.3.1\n", "Q: How to download iPadOS 13 simulator for Xcode?

Is there any way to achieve this?\n\nA: If anyone is still finding it difficult, when you download simulator, from Devices and Simulators option, you select an iOS version (say iOS 14.4). Once the download is finished and installed, you will have all the iPhone device simulators and iPad device simulators of OS version 14.4 available to be used as target device.\nThere isn't anything specific for iPad OS.\n\nA: \nXcode 11.3 supports developing apps for iOS 13.3, iPadOS 13.3, tvOS 13.3, watchOS 6.1, and macOS Catalina 10.15.2.\n\nSo make sure you have Xcode 11.3, which is available for \n\na Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_11_3_release_notes?language=objc\nAlso, make a simulator if not already there in Window menu →  Devices and Simulators window.

I'm preparing to release an open source Swift package with two companion MacOS applications: CLI and GUI.  I'm expecting the GUI application to be available via the MacOS App Store.  I'd also like to get the CLI application notarized.\nI'd like the naming to be like this for the applications:\nCLI: applicationname\nGUI: ApplicationName.app\n\nIs having the same name, other than capitalization and the .app file extension, going to cause trouble with how users access the tools?  Will there be some sort of path resolution conflict given the case-insensitive magic Apple does with the filesystem?\nClarification:\nApplicationName.app has executable ApplicationName inside its package-contents -> Contents -> MacOS directory. But that’s all related to the GUI version. I will also release a separate CLI version, not included in the app bundle, called applicationname.\n\nA: Not sure how to understand how there could be a conflict in such cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*foo.app is a directory (usually within /Applications) which contains all the files relevant for the application to run (including any resources, translated texts etc)\n\n*foo is a binary installed within foo.app which can be called from a shell by specificing the path, symlinking it from /usr/local/bin, or using any other way available in shells\n\n\nSo this are differently named things of different types, there shouldn’t be a conflict as far as macOS is concerned. We can‘t know what the App Store Review will make of it. \n\nA: Nothing of Concern\nAs long as the application's binary and the command line binary are not stored in the same folder, there are no problems with your naming scheme.\nWe ship command line tools within the application bundle's name.app/Contents/Tools/ folder. This has worked well for our customers and is acceptable within Apple's Mac App Store.\nCommand line tools and the PATH\nYour customers, or the installer, may want to place the applicationname CLI binary within the PATH, so it can be trivially used from the command line.\nBy default, the application bundles within the /Applications folder are not in the PATH.\n", "Q: Synology as Time Capsule Replacement I need to find a replacement for our current network based Time Machine solution.  Currently we are using WD My Cloud devices plugged into the network, but they are small, getting full, and are scattered.  I'd like to deploy a rackmount solution.\nSynology has a number of rackmount NAS's that claim to be good for MacOS backups.  Has anyone here used those?  When choosing your time machine backup drive does it show up as a choice?  When launching Migration Assistant, does it show up as a choice?\nJust curious what others have found with Synology.  I am also open to any other good suggestions. Thanks!\n\nA: I think Synology works very well as a Time Machine solution. It works as any other, and the Mac doesn't really know that its a Synology. You simply enable the Time Machine function of Synology, set up a Time Machine Folder, and then connect Time Machine on your Mac to that folder.\nI have had issues with my Mac losing connection to the Synology from time to time, and there seems to be no particular reason for this, but disabling the power saving features on the Synology seemed to help. (keep it from sleeping)\nYou can migrate your data: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202380\nSet up Synology: https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Backup/How_to_back_up_files_from_Mac_to_Synology_NAS_with_Time_Machine\nWhile the Synology is good, I found, it, just like nearly all such solutions seem to eventually get lost, especially with wifi-based backups. This often corrupts the backup. For systems that are always on and connected via ethernet, I have never had any issues with any device, but laptops, which get abruptly disconnected, seem to cause Time Machine issues over time.\nOpinion: Cloud-based backups seem to handle these interruptions in stride and therefore I have migrated fully to a cloud solution. More expensive? yes, in the long run, but stable and dependable.

And it also claims that it supports 2 video outputs in extended mode simultaneously. Giving the fact that Macbook also claims that it supports 2 video outputs from a single thunderbolt (on each side of the laptop) I rely on that this station supports my Mac. \nBut when I attach both ports together I get mirrored output to both of my external displays (I mean both of them work, but the image is exactly the same). Nevertheless, they are still extended from Macbook's integrated one. If I get to Display arrangement settings in macOS I see that it only detects both displays as a single one. here's the image the display with white border is my integrated one, and the right one is actually both of my external displays.\n\nI use HDMI->HDMI cable and FDP->FDP (Full-size display port). So there are no intermediate parts. The both external monitors run at 1920x1080@60Ghz (Acer v226hql (HDMI) + MSI optix g24c (Display port). \nI'm running MacOS Catalina 10.15.2, which I updated yesterday, so all drivers are up to date. I'm not sure if they're some official Azdome driver because I haven't found any.\nThe interesting part that this exact adapter outputs both displays in extended mode ok for my MSI laptop which runs Archlinux. So the adapter is definitely working. The issue is probably with drivers. I also asked apple support they say that they guarantee that their software drivers only work on official adapters that I can only buy on apple.com. \nAll of the other things work ok (ethernet/USB/power delivery/ audio). I also tried to plug off every other thing from the adapter and tried to run only with HDMI+DP connected but it just doesn't matter. \nI also have another cheap adapter usb-c->hdmi+usbc+usb which when I connect to the same side to the same external monitor works.\nWell, that thing described above only works like that only ~50% of the time. Another 50% MacBook just doesn't detect both screens at all. (I mean display arrangement tab is missing from display settings, and they are both black). In all 100% cases all other interfaces from this dock station work.\n\nA: The setup you with that hardware is not going to work - and cannot be made to work.\nThe USB-C dock station you've got works as a MST (Multi-Stream Transport) hub. MST is a part of the DisplayPort 1.2 standard, which makes it possible for monitors and computers to support \"daisy-chaining\".\nDaisy-chaining is most often seen where the monitor has both an input and output DisplayPort adapter, allowing you to connect the first monitor to the computer, and the second monitor to the first monitor. If both monitor and computer support MST daisy-chaining the two displays will act as seperate displays, exactly like if they had been plugged in directly to the computer. \nIn this case MST daisy-chaining is used within the dock to allow dual monitor outputs. Note that because the monitors share bandwidth, it is not possible to connect them at the same resolutions and refresh rates as possible when using seperate cables connected to the computer. With your monitors it shouldn't be a problem though (they're relatively low res).\nThe problem for you is that macOS does not support MST daisy-chaining. This is a software limitation and not a hardware limitation. Instead macOS supports daisy-chaining Thunderbolt monitors (such as with the Apple Thunderbolt Monitor).\nYou've got it working on your ArchLinux laptop because Linux supports MST. In fact you should be able to run Linux on your MacBook Pro and drive both displays via MST that way.\nTo get a setup like this working with  macOS, you'll need a Thunderbolt 3 dock instead of a USB-C dock. Or you could individually connect the displays to the MacBook Pro. For example one display connected to the dock, and the other connected via a USB-C to DisplayPort cable.\n", "Q: In APFS two boot containers (10.15.x on one and 10.14.x on the other) that share a common data container? On an APFS volume, can I have two boot containers (beta 10.15.x on one and 10.14.x on the other) that share a common data container so that I can switch between startup disks while keeping the same home folder & data?\nOr is there a better way to accomplish the same goal?\nSorry. I used \"container\" incorrectly. I should have said:\n...can I have two boot volumes (beta 10.15.x on one and 10.14.x on the other) that share a common data volume so that I can switch between startup disks while keeping the same home folder & data volume? \n\nA: I would say you need 2 systems and one third volume to do this the right way. It’s long been possible and sometimes preferred to have your user home folder apart from the boot system.\n\n\n*\n\n*10.14 has a combined default user data and system - add your main user with a home folder outside that, but shared with APFS so that all the free space combines.\n\n*10.15 has a read only system and a paired user data volume with firm links. Add the same main user outside these volumes.\n\n\nYou will certainly have some breakage and possibly much breakage when you use things like Photo Library, podcasts, music and more when the 10.15 system reads the data structure and modifies / migrates then in the user folder on disk to a newer structure. When the OS boots back to 10.14 this breakage will show and depending on your needs, you might need to keep two parallel home systems, so I would make a good backup of the 10.14 side before you boot to 10.15 and open anything more complicated than isolated documents.\n\nA: It seems a volume group cannot be rebind after creation.\ndiskutil apfs addVolume disk1 apfs “Test-Data” -role D\ndiskuitl apfs addVolume disk1 apfs “Test” -role S -groupwith disk1s[X]\ndiskutil apfs listvolumegroups\n\nAlso Mojave might not understand volume group at all.\n", "Q: What happens to an iOS app when a provisioning profile expires? Question.  What happens to an app when the provisioning profile used to build it expires?  Does the app still launch on the device? Dos the app ever \"call home\" every few days/weeks to Apple to see if it is still valid?\nI would assume that it would not (once its installed, its there), but if the phone was ever lost, and needed to be restored from backup, I would assume that the app would no longer work in this case, as when it calls back to apple, it is deemed not valid.\nForgive my simple question, but is my assumption correct?\n\nA: The answer is you won't be able to build new versions of the app until you update the provisioning profile, but anything distributed through the App Store will still operate. \nSource: I'm doing an update on an app where all of it's provisioning profiles expired a year and half ago, and it's still being successfully distributed on the App Store.\n\nA: If you're talking about an app that was released to the App Store, users will still be able to download and use it just fine. The fact that the profile has expired will not affect that. It really just means you won't be able to build a new version of the app with the expired profile.\nI currently have an app on the App Store with a profile that expired several months ago. I can still download it and use it, but I cannot build a new version for release until I renew the profile.\nBe careful, there seems to be a lot of misinformation about this subject where people say that if you let the profile expire the app will stop working. Maybe that's true for other scenarios, I'm not sure, but it's not the case for apps already uploaded to the App Store.\nSee Proper way to renew distribution certificate for iOS for more info.\n\nA: The Stack Overflow question \"What happens when provision profile expires?\" might be related this one.\nThe app will fail to launch due to the expired profile. The profile expires on its own, so I'd expect that the app does not \"call home\".\nThe same should be true when restoring from a backup.\n\nA: If it's an enterprise in-house app, the app will fail to launch and crash because the app is on your company's or some other server (that's not Apple's servers) and Apple can't confirm your identity without the provisioning profile, so it will fail to launch.\nvs.\nIf it's Apple's App Store app, then it will still launch because it went through the extensive review process by Apple before being uploaded to the App Store. So even if your provisioning profile expires, the app is still deemed credible because Apple has reviewed it before uploading to Apple's servers.\n", "Q: Install a new SSD but keep all the files and everything I bought a new SSD for my Macbook Pro Retina 2014. I want to be able to insert the new SSD but keep all my files, setting and etc. I am not sure what to do how can I clone my existing SSD to the new SSD?\n\nA: You need to make a complete duplicate (\"clone\") of your existing internal SSD module onto the new SSD.\nYou can do this with Disk Utility, but the third-party apps  SuperDuper! and Carbon Copy Cloner are actually better at it.\nHowever, the real problem is having both SSDs attached at the same time to make the transfer. You either need to buy a USB enclosure for one of them, or you need to have an additional USB drive to copy the clone to as an intermediary. You also need to have MacOS on this USB drive, because you'll need to boot up to it. \n(Having a standard USB drive may be more use to you in the long-run,; or you may already have one.) \nFirst step is to copy the clone onto the USB drive. You can either make the entire disk a clone, or copy the clone as a disk image (file) onto the USB.\nNext, you need to install the new SSD in your Mac so you can copy the clone back onto it, but of course you need to be booted to another volume in order to run the cloning app! \nBoot to the USB drive, and then run the cloning software in the other direction.\n\nA: Connect the SSD externally and install a clean os on it. Then run migration assistant to restore files to it from the internal drive (or from backup). \nOnce yours sure the SSD is viable and tested, then do the installation. \nThis was the opposite when drive swap was easy SATA and batteries were removable with a coin. Now you want to delay things that open the Mac until you’re sure your install is good. \n", "Q: What makes Catalina make a shell script quarantined? I am routinely editing shell scripts (bash).

Are they identical? \nI probably know the answers to this questions, but I want to be sure.\nHow does filevault 2 work?\n\nA: The general principle used by FileVault is the same as for any encryption scheme which allows more than one password to access the data (such as LUKS, which is commonly used in Linux environments). To summarise:\n\n\n*\n\n*A key called the MEK (media encryption key) is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.\n\n*A key called the KEK (key encryption key) is used to generate a ciphertext version of the MEK, which we'll call X. The value of X is stored alongside the data, e.g. in a filesystem header.\n\n*A series of passwords (such as your user password and a recovery password), e.g P₁ and P₂, are passed to a standardised key derivation function to generate corresponding encryption keys that are used to generate ciphertext versions of the KEK. Let's say that the ciphertext version of the KEK generated using P₁ is C₁, and likewise, P₂ yields C₂. The values C₁ and C₂ are stored alongside X.\n\n\nNow, if you know one of the passwords, you can provide it to decrypt the data. For example, if you know P₂, you can decrypt C₂ to find out the KEK. Once you know the KEK, you can decrypt X to find out the MEK. Once you know the MEK, you can decrypt the data.\nThis scheme allows easy addition, removal, and alteration of passwords used to access the data, since this simply requires altering the set of stored Cᵢ values. No re-encrypting of the data itself is necessary, since the MEK being used doesn't change.\n\nIn LUKS, these places to store a Cᵢ value are called \"keyslots\", and LUKS provides eight such keyslots.\nIn APFS, all such Cᵢ values are stored together in a data block called a \"keybag\" — in principle, the size of this keybag is unbounded, but in current practice, it's typically large enough for 7 keys. When you set up authorised users and passwords in FileVault preferences, one of these slots is used to store a Cᵢ which can be decrypted using the recovery password that is displayed to you.\n\nA: \nFileVault uses the user's login password as the encryption pass\nphrase. It uses the AES-XTS mode of AES with 128 bit blocks and a 256\nbit key to encrypt the disk, as recommended by NIST.[12][13] Only\nunlock-enabled users can start or unlock the drive. Once unlocked,\nother users may also use the computer until it is shut down.[3]\n\n...\n\nMaster passwords and recovery keys\nWhen FileVault 2 is enabled while the system is running, the system creates and displays a recovery key for the computer, and optionally offers the user to store the key with Apple. The 120 bit recovery key is encoded with all letters and numbers 1 through 9, and read from /dev/random, and therefore relies on the security of the PRNG used in macOS. During a cryptanalysis in 2012, this mechanism was found safe.[15]\nChanging the recovery key is not possible without re-encrypting the\nFile Vault volume.[3]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault#FileVault_2\n\nA: https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/374.pdf\nAll the answers you've needed. It's a full explanation of work. ☝☝☝\nI found the link on this site:\nhttps://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2012/08/06/analysis-of-filevault-2-apples-full-disk-encryption/\nMy explanation (Maybe something is wrong in it, but the hole idea is understandable):\n\n\n*\n\n*You turn on FileVault.\n\n*macOS provides a Recovery Key.\n\n*macOS takes your login password and somehow creates an \"encryption key\". (Presumably it takes your login password, \"salts\" it, runs it through some fancy algorithm, and produces a hashed value which serves as your \"encryption key\".)\n\n*macOS uses this \"encryption key\" to encrypt your entire hard-drive.\n\n*macOS also stores this \"encryption key\" somewhere on your hard-drive.\n\n*Later on when you start up your Mac, and log in, macOS takes your login password, runs it through the same process it used earlier (e.g. salting + some algorithm) and creates a hashed value.\n\n*macOS then compares this hashed value against the stored \"encryption key\" on your hard-drive.\n\n*If the hashed value matches yours \"encyption key\" then macOS unlocks (i.e. decrypts) your hard-drive.\n\n*If the hashed value doesn't match, then you cannot access your hard-drive or the data on it.\n\n\nMAYBE FileVault 2 is not storing encryption key on a hard drive it self. Probably FileVault is destroying the key after successful encryption. And then when you ask for access, it takes your password (which you typed as pass to system), runs through algorithms, salting and hashing it. And THEN FileVault trying to access hard drive using this key, recently generated from your password. Basically, if you type the right login password which was used for generating encryption key - the system will get the exact same key and will get access to hard drive data.\nIT IS MINE UNDERSTANDING.

Therefore the private key must not have a passphrase in order to be used with this tool.\nOrdinarily you would recommend that you create a private key protected by a pass phrase, and then temporarily strip out the password to use the script, and then delete the stripped key again - in order to safe guard the private key.\nHowever, you seem to have created a private key without entering a passphrase at all. Therefore you just need to skip this specific step in the guide - there's simply to passphrase to skip.\nI would still recommend that you do actually use a passphrase with your private key, as this is the step protecting you from exposure if the key file is leaked to a third party. \n", "Q: How can I send logs to the main screen of OSX Console?

Here's what I want to do: Every week I have a new batch of files that I process through Apple's Automator to complete various functions such as copying/moving, etc. An example file name is:\nexample_20200128.mov\nI would like to remove the last 9 characters, preserving the extension:\nexample.mov\nSince I'm already working in Automator, I'd like to also rename in Automator, as opposed to using a separate renaming software. It seems like there should be a simple solution, however, I do not \"speak code\", so I'm a bit lost. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: The following AppleScript should do the job. It removes only an underscore followed by eight digits, e.g. _2020012, at the end of a filename without changing the extension. I don't know how familiar you are with using AppleScripts but you should be okay if you carefully follow the directions below. Sorry that I can't make its creation simpler but, once created, it is simple to use.\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    repeat with thisFile in input\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            set {theName, theExtension} to {name, name extension} of thisFile\n            if theExtension is not in {missing value, \"\"} then\n                set theExtension to \".\" & theExtension\n                set theName to text 1 thru -((count theExtension) + 1) of theName -- the name part\n                set theName to do shell script \"/usr/bin/sed -E 's/_[0-9]{8}$//' <<< \" & theName's quoted form -- strip consecutive trailing numbers\n                set name of thisFile to theName & theExtension\n            end if\n        end tell\n    end repeat\n\nend run\n\nTo place this code on your Mac, select File->New->Service inside Automator and then double click on \"Run AppleScript\" among the \"Library\" options. Select the \"files or folders\" option in the \"Service receives selected\" menu at the top of the newly opened window. Paste the code inside the window and save it through File->Save inside Automator. Make sure you select all of the code above before copying it from here as a few lines of the code run quite a bit to the right outside the highlighted window here.\nYou can give this AppleScript a name such as \"Remove_Number\" while saving it inside Automator. The first attached picture shows how things should look like in Automator after the code is pasted and saved. You can quit Automator after the code is saved (but it does not actually matter).\nWhen completed, you should be able to change the names of any number of files you might select through Finder. After selecting the files to be changed in Finder, right click on the selected files and you should see an option with the name you have given the AppleScript towards the bottom of the right-click menu. (The 2nd attached picture shows how things look like in Finder at this stage.) Any selected file with an underscore followed by eight digits at the end of its name should have that underscore and the digits removed immediately after you select the AppleScript from the right-click menu.\n\n\n", "Q: Recommended disk format for external SSD running as system drive for a 2019 iMac I'm setting up a new 2019 iMac with an internal Fusion drive. I have an external 1TB Samsung T5 SSD drive that I'd like to use velcroed to the back of the iMac as the main system drive in order to improve performance. \nShould I format the SSD to APFS or HFS+?\nThe iMac has MacOS 10.15 Catalina installed by default. \n(I've read some stories of 2 minute wait times after restarts using APFS on external system drives, but I'd like to use the most up to date system if it's right to do so).\n\nA: Only APFS is supported for running Catalina. There may be some weird workaround for running Catalina on HFS+, but I don't know of any.\n\nA: Pedro has already correctly answered your question. This answer addresses your statement of improved performance. The internal fusion drive is basically a SATA HDD and a PCIe SDD. While your 1TB Samsung T5 SSD drive will be faster than the internal HDD, it will not be faster than the internal SDD. The reason for this is the T5 uses a USB 3.1 Gen 2 interface through a USB type C connector. \nTo compete with the PCIe SDD, you would have to step up to a Samsung X5 SSD drive. This has a Thunderbolt 3 interface though a USB type C connector. This Thunderbolt 3 interface is 4 times faster than a USB 3.1 Gen 2 interface. Both interfaces use the same USB type C ports on the back of your 2019 iMac.\nI realize the cost of a X5 is significantly higher than a T5. There are cheaper Thunderbolt 3 SDDs, but the lower price usually means less performance. Some comparisons are given below.\n$170 Samsung T5 1 TB USB 3.1 Gen 2 SDD with speeds up to 540 MB/s\n$200 VisionTek 1 TB Thunderbolt 3 SSD with speeds up to 1800 MB/s\n$409 Samsung X5 1 TB Thunderbolt 3 SSD with speeds up to 2800 MB/s read, 2300 MB/s write\nThe other issue with a USB SSD is whether or not UASP mode can be enabled on a Mac. Note, the link for the T5 has a disclaimer which states the 540 MB/s is dependent on the ability of the computer enable UASP mode. This issue does not seem to occur when a Thunderbolt 3 interface is used.\n", "Q: Target Disc Mode from 2009 Mac mini to 2019 iMac I need to transfer some large files from an Early 2009 Mac mini to a 2019 iMac.

Would you risk using Migration Assistant for this, or just transfer the files you need (mostly photos).\nFireWire 800 cable --> Apple FireWire 800 to Thunderbolt adaptor --> Apple Thunderbolt to USB-C adaptor\n\nA: You should be able to connect the two machines directly with an Ethernet cable (if you do not have cabling already) and then enable file sharing on one machine, and locate that machine on the other so it shows up in Finder as a mounted disk.\nThen you can just drag and drop the files.\n\nA: \nFireWire 800 cable --> Apple FireWire 800 to Thunderbolt adaptor --> Apple Thunderbolt to USB-C adaptor\n\nThat should work for you, it worked for me with similar vintage hardware.  When comparing the speeds of 800 Mbps Firewire to 1000 Mbps Ethernet (or even either compared to 480 Mbps USB 2.0 using an appropriate cable) it's possible you won't see much of a difference.\nOne difference is that you can keep the FireWire connection in place and keep your Ethernet port free for your network.

You'll want to open System Preferences => Security & Privacy and give \"Files and Folders\" permissions and/or \"Full Disk Access\" permissions to the Terminal.app and rsync programs.\n", "Q: Simulate app update I am aware of this link:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12468180/simulating-app-upgrade-in-ios\nHere is my scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*I uploaded the 2.38.0 version in TestFlight.\n\n*I installed the app via TestFlight app.\n\n*I put the newer version 3.2.0 in TestFlight.\n\n*TestFlight signal an update for my app.\n\n*I updated the app.\n\n*All app data from 2.38.0 was deleted.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this normal? (to erase all data from the older app when updating from TestFlight)\n\n*How can I simulate app update?\n\nA: Q1: No, it's not normal for an update from TestFlight to delete all data in an app. I regularly update apps via TestFlight, and have never experienced having data deleted.\nMost likely you either (a) changed the bundle-ID in your app between the two versions, or (b) saved your data in a non-allowed, non-standard location.\nQ2: You can simulate an app update by publishing multiple versions in TestFlight and changing between them.\nAnother method is to install the app on the device, and then open Settings => General => iPhone Storage. Select your app and press \"Offload App\". This will delete the app, but keep documents and data - exactly as happens during an update. Afterwards tap the app icon on the home screen again to re-install the app.\n", "Q: How to delete system file in Mac OS Catalina 10.15.3? Can't use sudo command in Terminal for destroy some unused system files. How can I do this? Who have a working answer for this?\n\nA: I would boot to Recovery HD and use terminal (it is in the Utility menu) to remove the files you want to delete. SIP doesn’t need to be disabled on your system, just use a different system to do the delete and then restart back in the now modified system. \nKeep in mind, deleting the file is easy to understand and execute. Making persistent changes (across updates or if Apple recreated the file you chose to delete) or effecting \npermission changes is significantly harder on Catalina due to the system / data split. \n\n\n*\n\n*Catalina not allowing to change read/write permissions despite having SIP disabled\n\nA: *\n\n*Disable csrutil & restart\n\n*Hold Opt, boot from an external bootable partition in recovery mode. Not active partition(eg. High Sierra install on USB or another partition)\n\n*Run Terminal.\n\n*Locate your drive and delete or modify what you want. (Catalina and higher OS there will be 2 partitions.. but both will be able to modify, even read-only.\n\n*Re-enable csrutil immediately after.\n\nEnjoy! Use to also delete IOPlatformPluginfamily.

Our development environment is entirely Windows.\nWe've got very close to being able to debug the iPad using this webkit adapter on a Windows 10 machine but it is far from ideal. As a result we are considering investing in a Mac purely for debugging purposes. \nBefore we splash out on an expensive piece of kit please can I check that a MacBook is suitable for debugging an iPad Pro and if so would a MacBook Air do the job or would it need to be a MacBook Pro?\n\nA: There's no requirement that you must use a \"Pro\" model in order to use the debugging tools in Safari. The MacBook Air has the exact same functionality. In fact there's no specific hardware requirement for this - it might as well be macOS running in a virtual machine on a computer running Windows.\nOfcourse there are other differences between the Pro and Air machines regarding performance, screen size, weight, etc.\nDepending on your needs, you might be able to get by with renting a remote Mac online. Several services exists (Such as MacStadium) that allows you to rent Mac for a month or even by the hour. The Mac is accessed with remote desktop software. You could use remote USB software such as VirtualHere to access your iPad over USB from the remote Mac.\nIn order to do remote debugging of the web site on the iPad, you'll need to first enable it on the iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings => Safari => Advanced\n\n*Toggle \"Web Inspector\" to on\nThen plugin the iPad with a USB cable to the computer, and then do the following in Safari:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Safari menu => Preferences => Advanced\n\n*Make sure \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" is checked\nNow you have the web inspector (what you call debugger) setup.\nAfter opening your web site on the iPad, then open Safari on the computer and access the Develop menu.

Even the slider on my screen also won't work.\nOnly the volume slider on the touch-bar will work.\n\nA: Reset NVRAM or PRAM on your Mac\nNVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory) is a small amount of memory that your Mac uses to store certain settings and access them quickly. PRAM (Parameter RAM) stores similar information, and the steps for resetting NVRAM and PRAM are the same.\nSettings that can be stored in NVRAM include sound volume, display resolution, startup disk selection, time zone, and recent kernel panic information. The settings stored in NVRAM depend on your Mac and the devices that you're using with your Mac.\nIf you experience issues related to these settings or others, resetting NVRAM might help.\nHow to reset NVRAM:\nShut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command,P, and R. You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart.\nMore detail from the Offical Apple Support page\n", "Q: Why is Audacity 2.3.X not recording audio input on macOS Catalina, plus workaround Audacity has stated that they do not support macOS Catalina, 10.15.X. Given the permissions and app sandboxing schemes have changed for the latest version of macOS, simply starting Audacity will not prompt users for granting the permissions it needs to use the built-in audio device or other audio input devices. So even though you can start recording, the software will never receive any input. You'll notice this looking at the waveform visualization during your recording.\n\nA: There is a work-around for this, and I wanted to share it here as yet another avenue to seeking this information.\n1) Go to Applications > Utilities\n2) Launch Terminal.app\n3) in the Terminal dialog type the following command following command:\nopen /Applications/Audacity.app/Contents/MacOS/Audacity\nThis will open Audacity and then Terminal will actually ask for the correct permissions.\nthis assume that Audacity is stored in your Applications folder. If it is somewhere else, you will need to change the path in the above command:\nopen /*location of audacity*/Audacity.app/Contents/MacOS/Audacity\nSince microphone access permissions granted in Mojave do not pass through to Catalina. Once you have granted this access in Catalina you should not be asked for it again when relaunching Audacity with this workaround method.\n", "Q: How to Format exFAT on Mac with custom block size (Read only problem!)

But I got this from the System Information section. Why does it say fully charged and shows 100% mark when the actual remaining charge is 95%? \n\n\nA: This is completely normal.\nThe numbers you see here should not be treated exact values - it is impossible to get exact values for the battery. The full charge capacity varies slightly with various factors - including, for example, the ambient temperature in your room.\nThe battery will ofcourse report a specific number to the operating system, but it would be a bad idea to expect the numbers to match up exactly. I.e. if you just charged until \"Charge Remaining\" matched exactly with \"Full Charge Capacity\" that wouldn't be a good strategy. This is why you see that systems from all manufacturers charge to somewhere \"near 100%\" - for example 95%.\n", "Q: Use Screencapture command to record screen -- How to get the audio source id? I want to write a scheduled script to use the screencapture command to record the screen automatically in the background, just like this:\n$ screencapture -v -V 60 output.mov -A xxxx\n\n'xxxx' is the id of the audio source.

10.13.x, I was able to double-click the image file and mount it. This is because older versions of macOS do not support APFS.\nThanks to all who assisted, or attempted to assist me in this matter.\n\nAdditionally, for those out there looking for an alternate answer:\nOn Linux:\nTo mount an APFS image file on Linux, use apfs-fuse:\n$ losetup /dev/loopX {image_file}\n\n$ apfs-fuse /dev/loopX {mount_point}\n\nThis will allow you to navigate the APFS file system.\n", "Q: Problem logging into Gmail from Thunderbird My wife has a problem with her gmail account, and as a security measure changed her password.\nShe has successfully logged in from her iPad and iPhone but Thunderbird on her MacBook seems to be caught in an authentication loop - we have signed on to google a dozen times.\nI managed to enter her gmail account in Mail, so I am assuming there is some problem with Thunderbird.\nAll devices are using IMAP.\nCan anyone suggest how we could reset Thunderbird - preferably without losing email on other accounts?\nI deleted the account and created a new Account - unfortunately this failed with error Username or password wrong.\n\nA: To simply reset the account, go to Tools > Account Settings. Choose the account, go to the bottom left of the screen (Account Actions) and click \"Remove Account.\"  \nThen re-add the account from scratch.\nIf you are using the IMAP protocol, you will not have lost any emails.\nThough to be safe, you can navigate to where the data is stored and back this up first (usually in /Users/[username]/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/)\nIf pop3, do the same as above but you will have to put the backed up pop3 emails back when you are done.  \n\nA: You should set up an App password in your Google Account:\nhttps://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en\nThis is what I had to do to get it working on Thunderbird.\n", "Q: Finder file dialogue very restricted - any way to enhance it? I am referring to a finder dialogue which opens e.g. when you chose to open / save a file in another application. \nThe context menu items that finder exposes are quite limited (you cannot open a file, etc.) compared to the regular finder.\n\nThis is kind of a silly restriction that I cannot see on any other OS. One of my regular workflows is to open a file from one of the dialogues, copy another file into it, etc.\nAny way to change this behavior?\n\nA: You indicate in comments that you need a free solution.\nThere's no free solution to do what you want currently. macOS does not come with a preference settings that enhanced that specific context menu.\nIf you're able to program yourself, it should be possible to add extra menu items to the menu. This should be possible free of cost, but will ofcourse take time.\nAs others have recommend, there's commercial solution such as \"Default Folder X\" available.\nIn your comments you also express that you find not only the file picker dialog, but also the standard Finder to be very limiting for you. In this case, you could consider using an alternative to Finder.\nSome good examples of alternatives are \"Path Finder 9\" and \"Commander One\". The first costs a bit, while the latter is free in the standard version. \n", "Q: iPhone XR stuck on update Apple iPhone XR gets stuck on update.

I am thinking about buying this logic board and putting into into my Early 2014 11\" Macbook Air, which has much lower specs.\nWill it work?\n\nA: For these models the answer seems to be yes. \nAccording to an iFixit thread you can even exchange it with the 2013 model.\nIn general though, you have to be careful since Apple tends to make minor changes, making the models incompatible. \nFor example: They changed the battery connector in the iPhone 6s from its predecessor, the battery itself was basically the same.\n", "Q: How to install FaceApp to mac? How do I install FaceApp in macOS?

Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.\n\nBased on that, I'd say no.\n", "Q: iPhone XS Max - went into disabled mode I accidentally dropped my iPhone and part of the screen wasn't functioning. So I entered the incorrect passcode several times (Maybe around 10) and the phone got disabled.\nNow, I have replaced the screen but my data is lost. I have some very sentimental pictures taken from this phone which is not backed. How can I recover these pictures ?\nI used Dr.Fone and PhoneRescue, it recovered almost all the pictures except for the ones taken on the day I dropped the phone. I am not able to recover these images. Can someone please help me out? \n\nA: I suggest using iMazing, as I've found that it has worked in multiple similar situations (water damage, dead screen, etc.\nI'm afraid that iMazing is a paid app, but comes with a 30 day trial, but in my experience this trial can be reset  by uninstalling and reinstalling iMazing.\n", "Q: Launch application from the touchbar Is it possible to add an icon on the touchbar that would launch a custom application (to the right section that is always shown)? I want to add iterm2.\n\nA: Beside BTT, there is some free option that let you customize your Touch Bar as you like (with the customize widget they provide) and can make iterm2 appear thanks to the dock widget : Pock & EnergyBar \nTouchSwitcher  & Rocket are also a good call as they are only about quick launching an app.\nThere is also My TouchBar My Rules who claims to be just like BTT, but free ! However it's looks like it's not very user friendly (but never had the chance to try it so far)\n\nA: Apple provides some simple modifications for the TouchBar — go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard and click the 'Customize Touch Bar...' button to see the available options — but none of them will accomplish what you want.  You can get BetterTouchTool which will allow you to create custom touch bar items, but it is not a free app, and not (so far as I know) available in the App Store.\nTo set up a touch bar item that opens an application using BetterTouchTool,:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download, install, and then Open BetterTouchTool\n\n*Select All Apps on the left, and select Touch Bar from the pull down menu at the top\n\n*Click the '+' button to add a button/widget\n\n*From the Select Trigger popover that appears, choose Touch Bar Button\n\n*Give the button an icon and/or title, then click the '+' button to add an action\n\n*Click the button labeled 'no action' to open the popover, then scroll down and open the 'controlling other apps section\n\n*Choose 'Launch Application/...' and select the application you want to open\n\n\nYou should now have a touch bar item in the control item area that will open the app in question.\nIt may be possible to work something out with scripting for free; I'll look into it.\n", "Q: Raise maximum connection limit for Internet Sharing? I’m using Internet Sharing (USB 10/100/1000 LAN → Wi-Fi) to give a tech demo of a web site, running locally on my machine, to multiple phones.\nI want to connect 15 phones to the shared network, but upon connecting the 6th phone, the phone reported “Access point temporarily full”.\nIs there a way to configure how many devices can connect to Internet Sharing? I’m fine with delving into the Terminal.\n\nA: The limit seems to be hard-coded into macOS and cannot be modified by setting properties or similar. \nHowever, if it is an option to use additional hardware, you may put a router in between. That way, only the router would connect via Internet sharing, while the other devices would connect to the router. \n\nA: Unfortunately there's no setting to configure the maximum number of stations that can connect to the access point at a time.\n", "Q: Can Wineskin work with Catalina?

Like, is it the files you see when you open the Photos.app, or does it include all images (e.g., jpgs)?\nAsking because my Photos shows 7GB and my photos.app is literally empty\n\nA: On my machine it only counts the photos in any photos library on the drive or one opened from an external drive (which looks weird, when it shows 800GB of photos/videos on the system drive with 250GB capacity, while it's actually on the external one).\nThis being said you should be able to find the pictures somewhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*You either have some pictures left in the recently deleted album (as @Ankii pointed out)\n\n*They could also be in a different library, which isn't opened\nautomatically. To open a different library either look for it in\nFinder or launch the photos app and immediately hold down the\noption key.\n\n*If you shared images in a shared album from the mac, they are saved on your mac.

I tried a script but it gets confused by the quotes in the html code itself. Please advise. Thanks!\n\nA: Create a 'service' in Automator.\nGive it the following settings: \nService receives 'no input' in 'any application'\nCheck 'Output replaces selected text'\nAdd the following 'Actions'\nGet Specified Text - insert your clip here\nCopy to Clipboard\nRun AppleScript - replace the (* your script *) with 'the clipboard'\nClick the 'Run' button to test the workflow. If there are no issues here, save the service.\nTo test whether the service works, put the cursor in a text doc of some sort (any place that you can paste multi-line text) and right-click… you should see the service's name in the menu. Click it and see what happens. Hopefully, it will paste your clipping into the text area which the cursor is in.\nIf it works well, go to the System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and click Services. Scroll through the resulting list on the right to find the name of your newly created service (should be in the Text section). Give it a keyboard shortcut (hopefully one that doesn't conflict with any other), and you're done.\nSo what does the service do? You specify the text for the clipping, it copies that to the clipboard. The applescript pastes the clipboard wherever you trigger the service.\nAs an aside, you don't mention what text editor you're using which might make it easier to devise a solution. BBedit was mentioned in the comments but the are other apps such as Coda that also offer some variation of a clippings feature. And as a further aside, I am unable to include a screenshot with my post.\n", "Q: How to ignore warning for program that connects to VPN I have to click accept/allow on this dialog everytime I launch a process that goes out to the web via the VPN..is there some env var I can set which can ignore the warning?\n\n\n\n\nA: The dialog box tells you how to solve the problem.\n\n\nThis setting can be changed in the firewall pane of the Security & Privacy Settings\n\nThere are excellent guides provided by Apple that can walk you through the process\n\n\n*\n\n*Change Firewall preferences on Mac\n\n*Use a firewall to prevent unwanted connections on Mac\nBut basically, what you're going to do is add your application, cm_api to your firewall and allow it incoming and outgoing connections.

I've been looking into methods to turn wifi power off when I login, and I've created a .plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>com.username.wifi_off</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/Users/username/.wifi_off.sh</string>\n  </array>\n  <key>Nice</key>\n  <integer>1</integer>\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n  <string>/tmp/wifi_off.err</string>\n  <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n  <string>/tmp/wifi_off.out</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nwhich is placed in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and the file .wifi_off.sh is:\n#!/bin/sh\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\n\nIs this quickest and/or most efficient way to disable wifi at login? How can this be extended to disable wifi at boot, so that wifi is disconnected at the login screen, before anyone has logged in?\n\nA: You may be asking two different things, but in the last paragraph you said: \n\nThe ultimate goal is to prevent the system from automatically logging into a network\n\nPrevent System From Automatically Logging Into a Network:\nI think the way to accomplish that is to un-check (disable) the Auto-Join feature for each WiFi network name/SSID that's stored. System Preferences, Network, Advanced.... Uncheck all checked boxes in the \"Preferred Networks\" list. \nAlso note that there are a couple of other options here that may be of interest: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can uncheck the option to \"Remember networks this computer has joined\" \n\n*You can check the box to \"Require administrator authorization to: Turn Wi-Fi on or off. \n\n\nTo Disconnect WiFi Power at Boot Time:\nTo disconnect wifi power at boot time, you can use cron. It's certainly simpler than building a .plist, and it's invoked at boot instead of login. In my testing, it survives a login, but of course it could be \"overruled\" by other system settings -- YMMV. It can be re-started from the WiFi icon in the menu bar after login when you wish. Here's how to do this from the CLI: \ncrontab -e \n\nThis will start your designated crontab editor, and open your current crontab. If you don't have a crontab (haven't used it previously), you'll be prompted to select from one of three choices for default editor. I'd suggest you choose pico or nano. That done, the default crontab will be opened in the editor of your choice.\nOnce the editor has started, make the following entry on the first empty line at the \"bottom\" the file: \n@reboot /usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportpower en0 off\n\nSave and exit the editor, and your new crontab becomes active. This command will now execute aach time your system boots, and (subject to the exception mentioned) your WiFi interface will be \"OFF\" until you turn it on.\n\nA: So I'm now using a combination of the crontab and the logouthook:\nThe crontab:\n@reboot /usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportpower en0 off\n\nThe logout hook was generated like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nsudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook ~/.logouthook\necho '#!/bin/sh\\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off' > ~/.logouthook\nchmod +x ~/.logouthook\n\nI have not found a way to always display wifi status at the login screen, but it seems to show wifi connectivity if it is connected to a network, and not show any status at all if it is not.\nI think these two items (crontab and logouthook) in combination may be a complete solution here, but I will also test global /Library/LaunchAgents so that I would not have to repeat any procedures if I want this new feature to automatically be applied to any new user that is created.\n", "Q: How to update Python which download from official website?

I want to clone my internal drive to an external one, byte for byte, partition table to partition table. My MBP is using GPT with APFS, the standard now-a-days. I do not have a T2 chip, but I do have a T1 chip. My internal drive is 500GB as is the external drive. Though, I think the issue may lie in the fact that my internal drive has a sector size of 4086 bytes and my external drive has a sector size of 512 bytes.\nI tried to use dd in recovery mode using the command dd if=/dev/disk0 of=/dev/disk4 bs=100m but it was going super slow at 18 - 19 MB/s. (USB 3.1 SSD). \nI booted into Linux and did a copy of the drive (using dd if=/dev/nvme01 of=/dev/sdb) and it was much faster at 270 MB/s. I also was able to test within a virtual machine and got the same 270 MB/s speed. I confirmed that the first 100 MB between the drives were the same (used dd and md5sum). \nI also confirmed the same way in recovery using dd and md5. But the drive didn’t have a partition table and macOS just read the drive as having something like 65 GB and refused to mount it.\nSo I recreated the partition map using parted and then restored the partitions. But macOS still refused to do anything with it. I’m guessing I need to dd the synthesized disk from macOS but there is obviously something wrong with the USB driver since it’s writing so slowly.\nI also tried copying the partition tables using sfdisk but it failed because “first lba specified by script is out of range”.\nI've also tried using cat (cat /dev/disk0 > /dev/disk4) and that didn't change the speed at all, so it's not dd.\nHere is the output of diskutil list:\n-bash-3.2# diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2         500.0 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +2.1 GB     disk1\n   1:                  Apple_HFS macOS Base System       2.0 GB     disk1s1\n\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -

If no one can help, worst case is to restore from a backup and use asr rather than dd the data destroyer. \nI partially joke about dd - it’s more useful than just destroying disks, but on several macOS filesystems, you don’t want a perfect clone of the drive identifiers in almost all cases - you want the data moved and not the entire structure and instantiation of what was designed as a unique filesystem identifier and the associated data that you do want to move.\n\nA: You can absolutely use dd to clone your MacOS disk that has an APFS partition. The issue is that your source and target do not share the same sector size. This isn't a huge issue, though, as the only thing that matters is that the partitions are aligned to the sectors, not the data within them. So if you erase the target disk in Disk Utility selecting GUID and APFS as the scheme and format, then the partitions will be aligned. Then use dd to clone the individual partitions. That's it!\nAlso, regarding the slow copy, you need to use /dev/rdisk0 and not /dev/disk0.\n\nA: Best solution I found is to use Paragon Hard Disk Manager 17 Advanced in Windows. Simply clone to new drive. It does require a Windows boot partition or putting the source and destination drives in external cases but not really deal.\n", "Q: Lightweight HTML viewer I'd like to write an HTML app for my own use that works offline.

But then is there any way to type in the correct word on Chinese and Japanese keyboards?\n\nA: If you are talking about the form of the characters not being correct, so you are seeing the Korean character variants instead of the Chinese ones, these are in fact by default determined by which language is highest on the list in Settings > General > Language.  You would have to make Chinese higher than Korean in that list to get the Chinese forms displayed.\nBelow are some images of those characters Japanese, Chinese, and Korean forms (Korean at the bottom).\n\nWhile you may be seeing Korean forms on your device, people you send text to will see the forms dictated by the settings on their own machine.  So a recipient of your email or text who is using a Chinese system will see the Chinese forms.\nOf course if you are using an app where you can choose the font independently of the system, such as Pages, then you can make sure you choose a Chinese or Japanese font instead of a Korean one to get the forms you want.\n", "Q: My Macbook Pro is acting as if the SHIFT key were pressed when it absolutely isn't This started happening suddenly yesterday, and it's annoying/making my life impossible, to say the least.\nI've tried searching for a solution but every solution given points toward a hardware issue. However, I'm sure I don't have any. I've checked in pages such as http://keyboardchecker.com and http://whatkeyamipressing.com and the SHIFT key doesn't appear as pressed—unless I actually press it, and when I release it, it shows as no longer pressed. However, my MBP still acts as if I were holding on to that key for dear life!\nI use a USB keyboard, and have done so for a long time; nothing has changed in that respect, so I don't know what could be going on. I will say it's a Logitech MX Keys and, if you know that product, you'll now it's the buggiest thing in the world! So I disconnected it to see if perhaps a happy firmware update was culprit, but the issue continues with the USB keyboard off and/or disconnected.\nBecause this only leaves the internal keyboard as the possible culprit, I've tried disabling it to see what happens but apparently in MacOS Sierra 10.12.6 you can't do this. I've tried disabling it following instructions given in this forum. I've entered the following into Terminal: \nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext\nAll I get is: \n\n(kernel) Kext com.apple.driver.AppleUSBTCKeyboard not found for unload request. Failed to unload com.apple.driver.AppleUSBTCKeyboard - (libkern/kext) not found.\n\nAnd although it says you probably get an error but the keyboard is disabled anyway, I'm not seeing that: my internal keyboard still works fine and the issue persists.\nElsewhere I also read the workaround/solution for when this happens was to press SHIFT and, simultaneously, press CAPS LOCK several times (5-10 times). But this doesn't work either.\nI've also checked, and Sticky Keys isn't enable. I've enabled it, pressed SHIFT 5 times, pressed SHIFT 5 times again, disable it again, etc., and the issue persists.\nThe only thing that's changed in my setup is that a week ago I added an external monitor connected to my MBP through the HDMI port. However, this was a week ago and the issue I speak of started yesterday.\nWhat solves it? Well, clearing my Mac's cache folder and rebooting it seems to be the only way to fix it. That is, until it comes back late run the day.\nHas anyone run into something similar? ANY input will be highly appreciated!\nP.S. As you can see, this text has been written in normal sentence form, i.e. not entirely in Caps, which is weird, right? Because I'm having the issue right now, as I'm writing this message. So how do I know that my MBP thinks the SHIFT key is pressed? Well, when I click on a link it sends it into my reading List instead of opening it (to send stuff to your RL you click holding down SHIFT, of course); when I click somewhere on this text, for instance, it paints the text from the last place the cursor was to the place I've clicked, as if SHIFT were pressed; when I click on 2 or more files on my desktop it selects them, as if I were group-selecting them pressing SHIFT; etc. \nP.S.S. Nor does my computer boot in Safe Mode when restarting. When I restart it starts out fine; it's later on it become wacky.\n\nA: In your case, when you reboot and if it has a shift button press then it should boot in SAFE mode. As you are not facing this, I am sure this is not a full hardware issue. So NVRAM reset should help because temporarily you are able to fix by a quick reboot.\nReset NVRAM or PRAM on your Mac\nNVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory) is a small amount of memory that your Mac uses to store certain settings and access them quickly. PRAM (Parameter RAM) stores similar information, and the steps for resetting NVRAM and PRAM are the same.\nSettings that can be stored in NVRAM include sound volume, display resolution, startup disk selection, time zone, and recent kernel panic information. The settings stored in NVRAM depend on your Mac and the devices that you're using with your Mac.\nIf you experience issues related to these settings or others, resetting NVRAM might help.\nHow to reset NVRAM:\nShut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command,P, and R. You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart.\nMore detail from the Offical Apple Support page\n\nA: This happened to me. I solved it by turning on sticky keys on the mac under the Accessibility -> Keyboard -> Hardware. Not sure why turning it on fixed it but it worked.\n\nA: i got the same problem and searched google and see your question, and i see no solution on the internet, after struggling myself to find the solution for probably an hour, i found a solution myself\nbasically you go to system preference accessibility and then keyboard, enable sticky keys and the problem is pretty much fixed fixed!! except if you turn that off the same problem appear again. but who cares sticky keys is not annoying\ni was so scared that i have to waste money to repair the computer at first\n\nA: Are you using any graphic tablet with your Mac and, when this happens, is that graphic tablet connected to the system?\nIt is mostly happening with Shift or Alt because the graphic driver uses this key as a speed key. In more than three different cases, it was the case. Just my 2 cents.\n", "Q: Quickly create screenshot, add border and cut & paste I often need to do screenshots of regions of the screen and paste them into mails, Jira, Confluence etc. On another OS, I use a screenshot tool which lets me select the region, add a nice border with one click, and put it into the clipboard with a second click.\nI know how to take a screenshot, but I didn't find an onboard utility which puts a sleek border around it with a single (or very few) clicks, routinely.\n(As an added bonus: ⇧ + ⌃ + ⌘ + 4 does not show a loupe while selecting the rectangle; if there is a tool or workflow which would include this in addition to the border, that would be great...).\nWhat would be an easy way to achieve this?\nI am technically inclined and not averse to scripting something with some tool... any solution based on that would be fine as well. \n\nA: You should look at the App Store first: there are a number of screenshot apps available, some of which may have the features exactly as you want. Type 'screenshot' in the search field, and start poking around.\nIf you want something free and native, then it's easy enough to script this. You won't be able to get a loupe that way; Apple doesn't provide that option (though you can get exact pixel dimensions from the drag cursor). \nStep 1: Copy this script into the script editor and save it as \"Screenshot Padding.scpt\" (or whatever, as long as it has the 'scpt' extension).

Now whenever you take a screenshot, it will deposit it in that folder and automatically give it a border.\nIf you are on an earlier system, then you will have to do something more. There are three choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually or programmatically drag screenshots onto the Screenshot Folder so they are processed\n\n*Attach the folder action to the desktop folder, and add code so that it only processes items with titles that contain the word 'screenshot'\n\n*Script the unix 'screenshot' utility, which has the option to save screenshots in locations of your choice.\n\n\nI'll provide details on those if you need them, otherwise I'll assume your OS is up to date.\n\nA: To take a screenshot of the whole screen, with a white border and shadow, after you enter the command-Shift-4 press the space bar, wait for your cursor to turn into a camera, then press your mouse button.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina beachball appears when I use TextEdit or Preview apps I have a MacBook with macOS Catalina 10.15.3 installed.\nI'm now noticing that whenever I open an image file with the Preview app, a beachball appears right about when I quit the app.\nAlso, a beachball appears whenever I open a text file using the TextEdit app.\nIs there any way I can reset things to fix these problems?\n\nA: Hi I did some more Google searching, and so the answer for this bug I was facing is to Disable the \"Dropbox Finder Extensions\" in the \"Extensions\" section in System Preference. \nIt seems the Finder features of Dropbox (like green dot next to filename in finder etc.) was causing beachballs in using TextEdit & Preview.

The MacBook ask for a pin code, the keyboard is working and it works without any problems.\nAs soon as I power off the keyboard just one time, or put the MacBook to sleep, the keyboard stops working.  However, it still shows as connected in the Bluetooth device list. \n\nSome informations :\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard works perfectly on another PC\n\n*Macbook is on Catarina, last available update.\n\n*Catarina is an update, not preinstalled\n\n*Keyboard worked before, can't remember if on catalina or not\n\n*Tried a SMC reset\n\n*Tried reinit Bluetooth module (shit+option on Bluetooth icon > Debug)\n\n\nA: I faced exact same problem.

Rinse and repeat.\n\n\nThis, along with the useless and annoying macro keys, really makes me wish I went with something else for my wireless keyboard.\n\nA: I had the exact same issue, combined with the fact that the Logitech G Hub for Mac would never recognize that the keyboard was connected to the system.\nThe solution I found works if you have a docking station or other connector with a regular USB port.  In the battery compartment of the keyboard is a USB dongle already paired with this keyboard, and it works better than a plain Bluetooth connection.\n\n*\n\n*Go to the System Preferences -> Bluetooth and make sure the keyboard is not connected. If it is listed in the devices, click the little \"x\" icon to remove it.\n\n*Plug the dongle in to your docking station.\n\n*Press the button on the keyboard that looks like a Wifi signal. The keyboard should connect. If you have G Hub installed, it should show up there, and you will be able to configure the keyboard as well.\n\nThe only problem I've had with this is that I had to use the System Preferences -> Keyboard to re-map Command and Option so that \"Alt\" becomes the Command key and Windows becomes Option.

For the first 2 years, I didn't know that the best way to preserve the battery was to keep it plugged in if you can, and I unplugged it each time it got to 100%.\nI'm considering replacing the battery, or buying a new MacBook. I'll probably go with the former because this MacBook still runs really well, and my specs are nice, I think. How did you guys decide whether to purchase a new MacBook or replace the battery? \nIs it possible for me to install the battery myself?

Would it damage the macbook in any way? \n\nA: There are a few things going on here:\nBest way to look after the battery\nNeither the action of unplugging when it reaches 100%, nor the action of keeping it charged all the time are the right way to look after the battery.\nThere are a lot of best practices detailed on Apple's Battery website.\nIn summary however as you can now see doing nothing actually would have been better which is why I usually advise people:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use it however you want.\n\n*Avoid leaving it plugged in all the time.\n\n*Never leave it for extended periods at or near 0%.\n\n*If you don't use it for 30 days, make sure to cycle the battery.\n\n\nBattery service versus device replacement\nI think you've already answered the question yourself here, however in summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*The cost of battery replacement isn't going to be more than the cost of a new laptop, and the laptop was already bought at a significant discount.\n\n*The performance of the laptop is still more than adequate for the tasks you have so there is no need to upgrade.\n\n*Ignoring the financial reasons, environmentally replacing a laptop because the battery has failed is not great.\nSo, replace the battery and revisit this question in another 2-3 years, if you want something a bit more fresh in the mean time, reinstall macOS, set a new wallpaper, or buy a new case.\nShould I replace the battery myself?\nReplacing the battery yourself is definitely an option, it depends on whether you want to save money, how easy it is to get to an Apple Service Provider, etc...\nIf you go with battery replacement I would go with a reputable battery supplier like iFixIt as suggested in the comments above.\nPersonally I'd suggest that if you are already considering replacing the laptop then cost probably isn't the major consideration and maybe getting Apple or an Apple Authorised Service Provider to do it might be preferable for you.\nApple's Battery Service Price List\nWhat if I keep using the battery?\nIn order of most to least likely:\n\n\n*\n\n*Likely - The laptop won't stay switched on at all when the battery is unplugged.\n\n*Possible - The battery begins to expand bending the chasis.\n\n*Unlikely - The battery expansion damages internal components breaking the laptop.\n\n*Extremely unlikely - The battery is damaged and begins runaway overheating that causes a fire that destorys the computer and risks a house fire, major injury or death(s).\n\n\nAgain I can't understate how unlikely the battery fire is from this but it can and does happen with this type of battery technology.\nIf you plan to continue using the laptop you should replace the battery, but I'd not worry about it too much, just keep an eye out for battery expansion causing the battery to bend the chasis as that will be an expensive repair.\n", "Q: How to determine what is causing Mac Pro to automatically log out and where to find logs of logout events? For the last week or so, I've been coming in to the office every morning to find my Mac Pro has logged itself out. \nMac Pro Late 2013\nmacOS Catalina Version 10.15.3 (19D76)\nI have been randomly trying to disable/uninstall things that I thought might be causing the issue but so far no luck. \nThis morning, I thought that I had finally nailed it as when the screen came  up, it was just asking for the password as opposed to username and password as it has started doing since it started logging itself out. Turns out I had started working on a Microsoft Word document which I hadn't saved when I left for the day so that stopped the logout process in its tracks and I was greeted with:\n\nAll of the usual suspects are not the issue. E.g. I do NOT have 'automatically log out after x minutes' set. I do not have any energy saver settings that would log me out:\n\nThe user account settings also don't seem to have anything that would cause a logout:\n\nIn security and privacy, the \"Require password after sleep or screen saver\" is set to \"immediately\", and \"Disable automatic login\" is checked. \nMost frustratingly about this whole endeavor is that after searching and grepping for longer than I'd care to admin, I absolutely can NOT find logs indicating who or what is causing the logout. Console.app is not helpful; searching though /var/log/ and /private/var/log both as regular user and root (via sudo -i) for things like \"log out\", \"logged out\", \"logout\" along with many variations thereof have yielded no help. \nIt seems like there should be a straightforward term and/or location where this info would be logged and I'm hoping I just can't figure out what it is. \nI'm also certain that this is a logout and not a sleep/wake deal because the last 3 or so mornings when it has happened, all of the applications I had opened when I left for the day are closed and gone. \nThere have been no notable new software installations of note; but there was an OS update within the last week or so. Unfortunately I can not for sure be certain if this issue started immediately after running that update. \nWhere can I find out what is causing my machine to log itself out sometime between when I leave around 5pm EST and when I get back in the next morning around 9am EST? There should be logs that detail this basic info shouldn't there? In addition to where I might look, what would be good search terms to use to find these types of events?

My idea is to prompt the user to select a Reminders list first and then use that list in the loop that adds the items to that specific list.\nI see that in the \"Add to list\" thingie, I can have it \"ask every time\" to select the list, and that works, but that asks for each item being added, which is too repetitive and laborious.\nI cannot figure out how to create a list variable which has the user's reminders lists in it so I can prompt them to make a selection from that list and then save that selection in a variable to be used in the \"Add to list\" thingie.\nI tried \"Show reminders list\" and selected \"ask every time\", but there's no way to save their selection in a variable to use later in \"Add to list\".\n\nA: This is a very hacky solution with annoying drawbacks.  I hope someone else comes up with something better.\nThe only way I found to set a variable to a user-selected list from the Reminders app is to add a dummy reminder that allows the user to set the list (and alert), from which you can extract the list (and alert) and store them for re-use into variables.  Then you just immediately delete the new dummy reminder.\nThe steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Static text with the (unique) value \"Dummy reminder\"\n\n*Add New Reminder (Reminder: \"your selected items\", List: Ask Each Time, Alert: Ask Each Time)\n\n*Set variable \"Selected reminders list\" to (List from #2).  To do this, you have to tap the \"List\" and set \"Get\" to \"List\"\n\n*Set variable \"Dummy reminder\" to select magic variable: \\New Reminder\\\n\n*Set variable \"The alert\" to select magic variable: \\Dummy Reminder\\ and change \"Get\" to \"Has Alarms\"\n\n*Remove (select magic variable) \\Dummy Reminder\\\n\n\nThen you can use these variables however you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Selected reminders list\n\n*The alert\n\n\nThe drawbacks:\n\n\n*\n\n*While I entered a variable name \"your selected items\" to try and suggest that something will happen with the text you're running this shortcut on, the prompt to set the list and the alert is not very intuitive.  It reads \"Add \\your selected items\\ to \\default reminders list\\ with \\No Alert\\\".  You have to tap your default reminders list name in the text of the prompt to change it (as you do for the alert).\n\n*The user gets a non-specific warning that a reminder will be deleted and that it can't be undone, but they have no idea what it is.  It states \"Remove 1 Reminder? This is a permanent action. Are you sure you want to remove this item? \\Cancel\\ \\Remove\\\".\n\n*If the user doesn't tap or taps \"No Alert\" but doesn't enter a time (even though a grayed out default time is displayed), they will get an error that states \"The alert time provided was invalid. Please check for spelling errors and ensure you provide a time of day.\"\nAlternatively, you can do something similar using the \"Find Reminders\" method, but the prompt is even less clear/intuitive.\n\nA: I would just use shortcuts. Example:\nFirst make reminder list for the selection like what chores you want done and call that chores.\nSecond make another list like child chores.\nThen go into shortcuts and make a new one and call it “add chores to child”.\nThen search for “find reminders”.\nWhere it says filter you need to click that and add the list you made called chores. Then where it limit or sort by and you add those if needed.\nI selected limit of 5 from a list of 100. Sorted randomly.\nThe search for repeat with each and add that. Select reminders.\nThen search for add reminders and select it and drag it in the middle of repeat each and end repeat.\nDon’t forget to select the repeat item in that after the drag to the middle. Once that’s done you can select the child’s list. At the end you could show the child list.\nI hope this helps.

From there it can be used to capture users's password which leads to essentially root privileges on the machine.\nIs there anything which can make this process safer?\n\nA: \nIs there anything which can make this process safer?\n\nYes.  The user.\n90% of hacking is social engineering.  It's not what people think it is; some bleary eyed geek sitting in a dark basement surrounded by high caffeine content energy drinks and a seeming endless supply of Hot Pockets tapping out cryptic code on a keyboard as they somehow overcome whatever defenses you thought you had.\nThere are the vulnerabilities and the exploits that hackers do take advantage of and some of them are really cool (for instance, I can take control of a domain connected Windows machine simply by making the on screen keyboard launch command prompt as an admin, but that's another story for another day).  However most of the hacking is how we can get people to give up the goods.\nWhere this applies is to be cognizant about what you're doing.  The \"knee-jerk reaction\" to seeing a dialog box with a password is to do exactly what you are thinking right now:  type in your password.  What you need to do is get the habit of doing is taking a pause and asking yourself why.\n\n*\n\n*If you're doing what you've always done and suddenly out of the blue you get a password request...ask why it's showing up now.\n\n\n*If you're installing something, ask why does it needs admin rights - it's probably legitimate, but a quick pause to mentally verify is always good (I do this when shopping too...\"do I really need this thing?\")\n\n\n*If you're on a website and you see a pop-up, ask why would they need that?\nThe key here is to take a moment and rationalize why you're entering your credentials.  *You can always hit \"cancel,\" you won't break anything, if you're not sure.\nSomething to consider...\nRemember, most hacking is social engineering.  Hackers know that most people don't want to go through the hassle of remembering different passwords for different accounts.  If they can get your email address by examining cookies and then trick you into revealing a password, they now can try virtually every service (Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, etc.) to see what can be compromised.\nSomething more to consider...\nHacking is not about taking complete control of your system to make the mouse do crazy things or move files and folders.  It's about lateral jumps, or in layman's terms:  what access can I get on computer A that will give me access to computer B or system C?  Hosing up your system only alerts you to their pretense which means you'll likely shut the door.  They don't want that.\n\nA: Theoretically: nothing. I can create a dialog to mimic the authentication dialog in a few lines.\nLuckily, owning root is not what it was, and there is still much that an admin user can't do: this is why Apple has implemented SIP and read-only System volumes, and authenticated permissions for apps; plus certificates and all the rest of it.\n", "Q: Now that I have iCloud, what benefit does Time Machine provide? For a normal Mac laptop user, it would seem that almost everything important (Documents, Desktop, photos) are backed up on iCloud. Most apps needs to get downloaded again anyway.  \nDoes iCloud retain versions?\nWhat would you lose if your hard drive died?\n\nA: iCloud is sync service.  Time Machine is a backup tool. \nThey're both important and not interchangeable.\nYou use iCloud to sync content across all your devices.  This way, you can access the most current version of a file, document, or photo, from any device where you're signed-in with the same Apple ID.\nTime Machine is designed to create and store backups, including versions.  This is only accessible from a device that locate and mount the TM backup.  Nothing stays in sync across your devices.\nIf your local hard drive fails, you can use your Time Machine backup to restore your files and retain your version.  iCloud will only allow you to sync the most-recent version of your files back to your drive, without version history.\nI recommend using both of these but use, and understand, them appropriately.\n\nA: iCloud may retain versions for those applications that use Apple's Auto-save and Versioning paradigm, but you won't have the same 'snapshot' archive that a TM backup gives you. \nTM backups everything: not just Desktop and Documents, Photos; but preferences, applications, system files. You can restore an entire volume from a TM backup. Over the years, I thought I could rely on the internet to archive stuff and just download it again - installer pkgs, applications, documentation - but I've found that things can often be withdrawn, disappear or be changed.\nTM also keeps files you've deleted. That's not the case for iCloud Drive.\nMost of all, a TM disk connected to your Mac is much faster than downloading from the internet, particularly if you have to recover everything. Don't forget that internet outages are a thing.\nA backup is a very particular thing. TM is a backup. iCloud is not.\n\nA: iCloud is no protection for unintentionally deleted or corrupted data. Yes, could re-install the OS and your apps and get your data back, but not that file you accidentally deleted three months ago.\nThis is the real difference between a sync service and a backup service .\n", "Q: Bulk printing on macOS I have a bunch of files that i want to print, they are all separate PDFs. \nWhat is the best way to print them without having to print them one by one, or combine them into a merged PDF using 3rd party software? \nI've tried dragging them into the print dialog of my printer, which works, but it only prints out the page at the default paper size, it does not give me any print options.\nI'm running macOS 10.14 and have a range of different printers, from HP, Canon, and Epson.\n\nA: \nWhat is the best way to print them without having to print them one by one, or combine them into a merged PDF using 3rd party software...it only prints out the page at the default paper size, it does not give me any print options.\n\nYou have to set your print options in the document itself so you shouldn't have to specify any options.  For example, if you wanted this particular job to be in color on the card stock found in Tray 2, you would have defined in the Page Setup that it was on \"card stock.\"  In the printer setting, you define that tray 2 has card stock in it, so when the print job is called, it will automatically \"know\" that its to pull paper from Tray 2.\nUse CUPS\nWell, macOS uses CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) to handle it's printing tasks.  Part of CUPS is lp where you can submit jobs to be printed.  This gives us a few options here:\n\n*\n\n*You can specify options for each or a batch of similar jobs\n\n*You can create a queue with predefined options and just send a job to that queue.\n\nA couple of examples:\nTo print out all of the PDFs in a directory formatted landscape, you could just issue the command\n$ lp  -o landscape *.pdf\n\nTo print out a doc file on A4 media, you could issue the command\n$ lp -o media=A4 MyPaper.doc\n\nSee Command-Line Printing and Options for more details.\nThe other option is queues (filters) that allow you to specify a predetermined set of options and send your print jobs to them.  The beauty is, you can have any number of filters for a single printer.  The downside is there's a lot more work up front to set these up, but the pay off is if you have lots of jobs, it will be much more efficient.\nYou can review the CUPS documentation on how to set up filters, but I've found the FreeBSD tutorial on setting up filters a bit easier to follow.\n\nA: Is the problem that the default paper size and print options are not what you want, or is it that you want to change the print options mid-way through this one big job?\nThe macOS print system is designed to process each job with separate parameters. If you want to print several files as one job, then the job must have the same parameters. You can't change paper sizes and settings halfway through.\nIt' easy enough to change the default print settings, if that helps.\nIt would be possible to create a script that merges the files and sends them to the print queue 'on-the-fly'.\n", "Q: How do I jailbreak my iPhone 11 so that it’s not carrier locked? I bought an iPhone 11 from Sprint and also bought their unlimited data plan. I have been making my monthly payments for my services and my phone.  The thing is Sprint is so full of red tape and ridiculous charges that I am sick of it. Basically they're just stealing money from me and using the red tape for charges that are just ridiculous.  Is there a way for me to just break away from Sprint using this phone on another carrier?\n\nA: Unlocking a phone is not the same as jail breaking.  Unlocking has to do with how your phone communicates on the carrier's network (and won’t on others), whereas jail breaking removes the iOS restrictions Apple has placed to secure your device.  They are mutually exclusive: you can have an unlocked phone that isn’t jail broken and vice versa. \nIn the US you can unlock your phone from the carrier once you’ve satisfied your contractual obligations, for free.  For instance, with AT&T, I was able to unlock an iPhone so that it could be moved to Verizon.  All I did was via the AT&T website, request an unlock code and within minutes, I received it, put it in the phone and “released” its carrier restriction.\nFrom what you describe, you may not have satisfied your contractual obligation meaning the carrier has no incentive to unlock the phone.\n", "Q: Why don't new contacts created on my iPhone sync to my desktop Mac? On my iPhone running iOS 13.3, I can create a new contact in the Contacts app. However, the contacts do not end up in the Contacts app on my desktop Mac (which is running 10.13.6).  I have iCloud on the Mac configured to share contacts, as can be see in the following screenshot:\n\nSimilarly, my iPhone is configured to share contacts too, based on the iCloud configuration in Settings ➜ my Apple ID, as can be seen in the following screenshot:\n\nBoth the iPhone and my Mac use the same Apple ID.  Neither device is out of disk space, nor is iCloud out of space.  The contacts that are missing from the Mac were created last week, so I think enough time has passed that it's not a time lag issue.\nWhat can cause this problem, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Solution 1: Verify new contact default account location\nIt is likely that while Sync is working, that the contacts aren't syncing because you are not creating those contacts in your iCloud account.\nThe contacts app has the concept of different places to store Contacts, indeed all iCloud services do this, a more relatable example would be in Apple Mail where you have multiple mailboxes within each email account.\nOne of the options in both of these Apple applciations is to create things 'On My Mac'.\nIn this case it's likely you are creating contacts on your Mac or iPhone and not in iCloud.\nYou can check and fix this by:\nmacOS\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Contacts.app\n\n*Click \"Contacts\" in the Menu Bar, then \"Preferences\".\n\n*Choose the \"General\" tab.\n\n*At the bottom look for \"Default Account\"\n\n\nIt should be your iCloud account.\niPhone OS\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Settings\n\n*Tap on \"Contact\"\n\n*At the bottom look for \"Default Account\"\n\n\nIt should also be your iCloud account.\nSolution 2: Signing out of iCloud and back in again\nIf the above doesn't fix the issue, or is already correctly set to your iCloud account, I would suggest signing out of and back into your iCloud account.\n\nWarning: As there is unsyncronised data there is the possibility of data loss, you need to manually backup the missing contacts.\n\nmacOS\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch System Preferences.app\n\n*Choose \"Internet Accounts\"\n\n*Select your iCloud account\n\n*Click the - (minus) symbol to remove the account.\n\n*Click the + (plus) symbol to add the iCloud account again.\n\n\niPhone OS\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Tap on your profile at the top with your avatar.\n\n*Select \"Sign Out\" at the bottom\n\n*If prompted choose \"Sign out of iCloud\"\n\n\nTip: Don't sign out of both at once as it will make login with two-factor authentication difficult to impossible.\n", "Q: High resting CPU usage and Idle Wake Ups The idle wake ups on my MacBook Activity Monitor are staggering.

This is not that same question, but is related.\nI don't want to disable WiFi, but I would like to stop it from \"Looking for Networks...\" on my Macbook Pro while I am connected to a network. \n\"Looking for Networks...\" strikes me as wasted effort much of the time. The exception being when you take a laptop into a new place. I certainly don't want to switch from my chosen network when I'm home. Yet, according the GUI, the system is \"Looking for Networks...\" every 2-3 seconds in a mostly pointless expenditure of resources. \nI've searched for data to corroborate my feelings that this is a waste of resources. I was unable to find anything for MacOs specifically. In fact, I found nothing that appeared to be definitive explaining exactly what \"Looking for Networks...\" actually means.\nAre any data available that document what and how many resources are being used in \"Looking for Networks...\"? Is there any way to stop the system from \"Looking for Networks...\" when WiFi is on and connected to a functional AP?\n\nI don't think \"Looking for Networks...\" is a \"channel scan\" as discussed here and here, but I'm not certain.\n\nA: First off, you are correct that Looking for Networks is not a channel scan.  The difference is, the first is looking for broadcast SSIDs where the latter is looking for a non-crowded channel within the 2.4GHz or 5GHz frequencies that it can use for maximum speed and reliability.  When you enable \"Auto Channel Selection\" (default on most routers) it will automatically look for the least congested channel - that's what the discussion is referring to when talking about a channel scan.\nAs for Looking for Networks you're right that it would be a pointless expenditure of resources, however, this is only activated when you open the GUI.  macOS will automatically start looking for networks when you click on the WiFi icon in the menu bar because, it's assuming (technically, the developers assumed) that you'd want to see all the available networks.  Thus it does a scan.   Once you close the GUI, it no longer scans.\nHow WiFi scanning works\nIt's important to note that your Mac (or any other computer/OS) isn't doing anything actively to look for your SSID.  It's not sending out any signal that asking for the AP to respond back.  It's actually the opposite.\nBeacon Frame\nEvery AP (by default) sends out management frames that, for a lack of a better descriptor, help manage the functions of a WiFi network.  One of those frames is a Beacon frame and within it, there is key information about the WiFi network, but most importantly, the SSID.  This is being broadcast no matter what and has nothing to do with the client operating system (in this case macOS, but it could be Windows, BSD, or Linux) as it's being transmitted by the WAP (wireless access point).\nWhen you scan for wireless networks, you tell the WiFi chip (Broadcom BCM43xx for example) to listen for these frames.  When you find an AP you'd like to communicate with, it sends a \"probe request\" to the WAP for it to begin the authentication process.\nIs it always scanning?\nWell, yes and no.  Those management packets including the beacon frame are in the air and the WiFi chip will receive it.  It obviously doesn't need beacon frames from SSIDs it's not attached to (if already attached) and will discard them.  However, it does need the other management frames and will process them accordingly.\nSo, is it actually scanning?  No.  It's listening.  It's just that when you open the GUI it's actively listening.  When the GUI isn't open it's passively listening.  In other words, it's a guy watching football as his significant other is trying to have a conversation.\n", "Q: Restore directory under ~/Library from TimeMachine I want to restore a directory from TimeMachine backup.\nUnfortunately the folder I want to restore is under ~/Library which is not shown when I enter TimeMachine.\nIt is simple enough to access ~/Library but I can't figure how to do it in TimeMachine - any ideas?\n\nA: I found a kludge, which enabled me to restore the file, although I am not entirely comfortable with this.\nI added ~/Library to the Sidebar, it then showed in TimeMachine.\n\nA: ~ is an alias (shortcut) to your home folder, within a macOS environment it refers to: /Users/{username}.\nSo for me it would be /Users/tom/ and the Library folder would be /Users/tom/Library.\nYou can launch Time Machine, navigate to the time that you are looking for then using the shortcut you usually use ⌘⇧G to get the \"Go to folder:\" dialog. Then use the above path format to navigate to the Library folder.\nTip: You can autocomplete the path by pressing tab, in the above example if you alredy typed /Us and press ⇥ you'll get either /Users typed for you or a pop up with a list of options. This is useful when trying to figure out your username for the first time!\n\nA: To show invisible files and folders in Finder and in Time Machine, just press ⇧⌘.. That will let you restore files in ~/Library and any other hidden folder.\n\nA: The Time Machine app is just like the Finder: everything you can do in Finder, you can do there. So whatever it is you do to get to the user Library in the Finder: do that in TM.\nAlso, the TM app normally opens to the Finder window that is in the foreground when you launch it. So if you have your user Library in a Finder window, and then launch the TM app from the menulet, you should be there.\n", "Q: Cannot reinstall macos with internet recovery Bought an old macbook off ebay no harddrive, installed one now cannot renstall lion, item not available.\n\nA: You need to buy Lion [& Mountain Lion] - they're the last ones you actually had to pay for, all since then have been free.\nhttps://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/D6106ZM/A/os-x-lion  or\nhttps://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/D6377ZM/A/os-x-mountain-lion\nThe links don't have a universal translator to your own country's Apple Store, unlike most Apple links, so you may have to search your local store instead.\nFrom comments\nIt seems you can manually edit your own country code into the above links to find your correct Store.

Here is a simple sequence of actions in TextEdit in macOS 10.13.6 that produces an unexpected side-effect. I don’t understand why, and would like to know how to prevent it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new document in TextEdit (using ⌘-n or menu item File ➜ New).\n\n*Look at the style bar at the top, and note the font & font size. The font that TextEdit uses at this point is what I set in my TextEdit preferences for \"Rich Text Font\". (In my case, Roboto 14pt.)\n\n\n*Capture an image to the clipboard, e.g., using the standard macOS facility for capturing a portion of the screen as an image to the clipboard. (Any image will do.)\n\n*Paste the image in the document (using ⌘-v or menu item Edit ➜ Paste).\n\n*Look at the style bar again: the font & font size have changed to Helvetica 12pt.\n\nThis affects text that you type in the document: if you type text before you paste in an image, the text will be in the font and font size you set in your preferences; once you paste in an image, any text that you type in the document after the location of the image will use a different font & font size. (It is not merely a glitch in the style displayed in the style bar.)\nWhy does the font change? What controls this behavior? And how can I make it stop changing, so that text typed after step #4 continues to be the font set in my “Rich Text & Note Font” preference instead of being switched to Helvetica 12pt?\nIn case it is relevant, here is an image of my TextEdit Preferences panel:\n\n\nA: I can consistently reproduce this behaviour in TextEdit.app and Notes.app on macOS Catalina 10.15.3 (19D76). This happens with any kind of image insertion (eg. clipboard, drag & drop).\nI don't know how to prevent it from happening when you're appending an image to text, but maybe you'll get what you want by inserting an image into the middle of formatted text; then the before/after text preserves original formatting. One thing that worked well for me is typing a space, then tapping the left arrow ◀️ key once before pasting an image.\nI'll go into more detail below about what else I learned.\n\nThe font always reverts to Helvetica 12 pt after pasting an image, regardless of any settings I tried. This seems to be a hardcoded, unchangeable system default. Although I haven't yet tried using TinkerTool to change system-wide font settings.\nPeeking into RTFD files\nI'm not sure how to peek at the in-memory state of NSTextView but if we save the file to disk then we can inspect the content of the RTF file. We're looking for a font-size directive like \\fs12 or \\fs24. Actually the original RTF file format doesn't support images, so we're really talking about .rtfd (RTF Directory) bundles here. \nAt first I compared two files, one where no image had yet been pasted, and another where the image was pasted and then removed. Interestingly, the file contents were identical! This suggests that there is no intentional change of text format settings, and that reverting to Helvetica 12 pt is directly connected to the presence of the image.\nThen I inspected a file where I had appended the same image multiple times. The same image directive occurs in repeat without any text formatting directives. In particular, \\fs12 never appears in the file.\n\\f0\\fs48 \\cf0 Hello World\n\\fs24 {{\\NeXTGraphic Pasted Graphic.png \\width500 \\height520 \\appleattachmentpadding0 \\appleembedtype0 \\appleaqc}}\n{{\\NeXTGraphic Pasted Graphic.png \\width500 \\height520 \\appleattachmentpadding0 \\appleembedtype0 \\appleaqc}}\n{{\\NeXTGraphic Pasted Graphic.png \\width500 \\height520 \\appleattachmentpadding0 \\appleembedtype0 \\appleaqc}}\n\nBased on this, I can quite conclusively determine that this pasting behaviour is related to in-memory handling of formatted text. In other words, this seems to be a peculiarity of Apple's implementation of NSTextView.\nIt seems unlikely to me that this is the behaviour that Apple's software engineers intended to create. If it was intentional, then it would be off-topic to speculate about why. But since it does appear to be a bug, instead I would direct you to Apple's page where you can write feedback for macOS.\nPossible leads for future investigation\nHow can we directly inspect the contents of the clipboard? Is there any text formatting information associated with an image in the clipboard?\nWe could probably identify a smaller case to reproduce this issue by directly manipulating an NSMutableAttributedString. It's been a while since I did Mac development, but I would probably focus my attention on appendAttributedString: or insertAttributedString:atIndex:.\n\nA: If you copied the image from another text app, like Word or Pages, then you may also be copying the text formatting at the position of the image in that document.\nTo ensure that this doesn't happen, use Paste and Match Style, which is Shift Alt Command V\nHowever, you are right that this occurs even when no text formatting exists. The most likely answer is that it's a bug -- an undesirable and overlooked aspect of the code. \n", "Q: Create gigabit bond from 2x100Mbps ethernet I followed the instructions from: Combine Ethernet ports into a virtual port on Mac to create a bind between two 100Mbps Ethernet interfaces. \nHowever the bond itself is only a 100Mbps interface. It there a way to make a Gigabit bonded interface to get 200Mbps out of the two interfaces at once?\n\nA: This is called link aggregation.\nFirst off, to bond two Ethernet ports together, your switch must also support this and have the ports configured to do so.  From your description of things, it appears this part was overlooked because you still only have a 100MB connection.\nSecondly, you can’t get a gigabit link (1Gb) from two 100MB connections. 1Gb = 1000Mb.  Two 100Mb links aggregated is 200Mb.\n", "Q: Mac: DRM removal for Apple TV-purchased movies? I have the latest macOS (Catalina). Are there any DRM removal software that will work with the Apple TV app on my Mac? The most popular software (DVDFab, TunesKit, etc.) work with iTunes only, but iTunes only exists on iPhones. I downloaded my Apple TV-purchased movie to my Mac, which has a .movpkg file extension. I tried using TunesKit, but it won't even open the downloaded movie. I'm just looking to convert the file extension and play in VLC so I can take a screenshot from a movie scene.\nI understand that Apple blanks DRM from screen recording and I still want to snap occasional still frames. \nIs this technically possible?\n\nA: This is going to be hard to accomplish using Apple SDK and tools. I’ll be setting aside any reason why Apple made it technically hard, as why Apple does things is off topic here.\nWhat is not technically hard is using HDMI capture hardware to make your grabs. Or better, find a like-minded community that is sharing the burden and cost of getting high quality still frames for educational and legitimate and legal uses.

It is supposed to be there, and it is not the cause of your problems with high CPU usage and fading battery.\nI would suggest using Activity Monitor to identify which process or processes are actively using your CPU. These would be the causes of high CPU usage.\nAs you have already reinstalled, you might find that the CPU heat is not a by-product of high CPU usage, but rather a hardware problem (such as a cooling issue).\n", "Q: How to make Little Snitch only block the upload traffic, but not the download traffic？ I didn't find a way to do that, please help!\n\nA: Both uploads and downloads consists of data packets going both in and out of your computer. Therefore you cannot block only one direction and still have a working data transfer.\nIn rough terms a download works by your computer sending a data packet to the server letting it know you want to download such and such a file. The server will reply with a small part of the data, whereafter it expects your computer to acknowledge that it received that data. If it does not receive the acknowledgement, it assumes the data was lost and tries retransmitting, eventually considering the connection broken.\nLittle Snitch works (by default) by blocking new connections that are initiated by programs on your computer (i.e. a new connection is when the first data packet is sent from your computer to the remote server). You will be prompted the first time, so that you can allow similar connections in the future. Even though the connection is initiated locally, it can be be either an upload or a download or a mix of both - you cannot determine that by looking only at the first packet sent.\nNewer versions of Little Snitch similarly control incoming connections to your computer. Here you'll get the advance prompt only for TCP connections, whereas UDP connections will just be blocked by default, allowing you to remove the block later (for future packets only). Incoming connection filtering like this is not that commonly used, compared to the traditional workings of Little Snitch described above, which is very popular amongst Mac users.\n", "Q: Create encrypted partition for Time Machine from command line using diskutil or gpt, instead of Disk Utility?

Apple has decided to push this on everyone for various reasons. There should be good defaults for everything. Home keys should work, PS1 should be reasonable. Old .bashrc and .profile translations should be automatically generated. Not doing this is stealing from users. We are bailing them out for their \"bad\" decision to use bash or equivalents bash's decision to change license.\nHow to make everything \"just work\" like for bash?\nI use iTerm 2 like a normal person. Not sure if that is related.\n\nA: Bash is included in macOS 10.15 Catalina still however it is not the default login shell for new accounts.\nThis was done as Apple has increasingly been removing dependencies from the core OS for security reasons.\nIn this particular case since version 4 bash switched from the GPLv2 to the GPLv3 license which is not compatible with how Apple distribution their OS. This has prevented Apple from distributing updates beyond version 3.2 of bash.\nZsh was selected by Apple specifically for compatibility reasons and because it's license is compatible with Apple's distribution method.  \nThe good news is you can switch back to bash 3.2, there are two ways to access it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type bash into your terminal application.\n\n*Modify the default (login) shell in iTerm or Terminal to bash \nHow to install bash v5\nYou can install the latest bash using homebrew:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install homebrew: https://brew.sh/\n\n*Run brew install bash\n\n*Switch to bash by running bash or editing the default (login) shell in iTerm or Terminal.\n\n\nHow to change the default (login) shell\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the path to your desired shell in a terminal application which bash it'll be something like /usr/local/bin/bash\n\n*Launch System Preferences\n\n*Go to 'Users & Groups'\n\n*Right click on your username.\n\n*Select 'Advance Options...'\n\n*Paste your new shell in the 'Login shell:' field\n\n*Press 'OK'\n\n*Relaunch your terminal applications.\n\n\nA: To get fn-left (Home) and fn-right (End) working, add these two lines to ~/.zshrc (for your user only), or /etc/zshrc (for everybody)\nbindkey \"^[[H\" beginning-of-line\nbindkey \"^[[F\" end-of-line\n\n\nA: The core of the problem is that bash is using the readline library and zsh has its own keybindings and is not using readline. See Make zsh use readline instead of rle.\nIf you are at ease with the emacs key bindings (this is the one zsh is using by default), then you could use ctrl+a and ctrl+e to get the functions you are looking for within zsh.\nIf on the other hand, you are at ease with the vi key bindings, then you could enter within your ~/.zshrc:\nbindkey -A viins main\n\nand then you would be able to use 0 and $ to get the functions you are looking for within zsh. You can display all these bindings with:\nbindkey\n\nIf you are interested to continue with zsh, read man zshzle to discover the functions zsh provides at the line editing level.\n<ad section>\nAfter many years of use of many ≠ shells, I feel that zsh has better time saving functions than bash.\n</ad section>\n", "Q: How to reorder highlights in Preview according to page numbers?

I'm uploading a 4.88 GB video to YouTube, using the YouTube Studio web interface in Google Chrome 79. My MacBook Pro is connected to my 5 Ghz SSID on my TP-Link EAP245 (Generation 1) access point, which is connected via gigabit ethernet to my Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X, which connects to my Netgear CM1000 cable modem. I don't have any VLANs or special routing rules configured.\nAccording to the Network tab of Activity Monitor, I'm uploading data at roughly 10 megabytes per second (MB/sec). However, my Internet service is only supposed to support 35 megabits per second (Mb/sec), which comes out to about 3.5 megabytes per second.\n\nI'm reasonably confident that there is no other major data transfer occurring in parallel with my YouTube video upload.\nI can use the Python-based glances utility to observe that only a single network interface (my en0 Wi-Fi adapter) is pushing out approximately ~80 Mb/sec, which roughly matches the 10 MB/sec. that I'm seeing in Activity Monitor. When I'm not uploading a video, the idle utilization of the en0 network interface is only a few KB/sec.\nMy MacBook's en0 network interface is using the default MTU of 1500, according to ifconfig. All my other network devices use the default MTU.\n\nIn addition, according to my router's traffic monitor, I'm actually pushing out 44 Mbps (35 Mbps slightly over-provisioned).\n\nQuestion: How can I explain the discrepancy between a 3.5 MB/sec. Internet service, versus the ~10 MB/sec being indicated by Activity Monitor in MacOS?\n\nA: The main reason is that Activity Monitor shows the sum of data sent/received on all network interfaces, whereas your router only shows the data actually routed through it.\nThis means that there is traffic that your router does not see, and thus does not count into its statistics. This could for example local area network traffic directly between your MacBook Pro and other devices on the local area network reachable without routing. Another very common example is the loopback network interface, found on all Macs, which offers communication internally within the same computer (i.e. between different processes/programs running on your Mac).\nThis means basically that you cannot equate a number from the sum in Activity Monitor and any sort of \"my internet connection is used at this speed\".\nIf you want to figure out what exactly is the cause of the discrepancy - i.e. even if you say that you're \"reasonably confident\" that there's no other data transfers, there actually must be other data transfers - you can identify them by measuring or sniffing the traffic on all your network interfaces seperately. An easy to use tool for this could be \"Wireshark\", which will allow you to sniff, dump and do statistics on data transfers on all network interfaces, including WiFi, cabled ethernet, VPN virtual interfaces and loopback interfaces.\nThe only explanations that can fit your observations, if you're correct that there are no other data transfers, are that either (1) Activity Monitor is flawed and does not display the correct values, or (2) your data transfer comes with an extreme amount of overhead. Both explanations seem very unlikely.\n", "Q: MacBook External Display Black I have a 2018 MacBook 15inch using two HDMI to USB-C connectors.\nOnly one display ever shows an image, the other was black. What can I do?\n(I found the solution myself and tried to reply to this thread - MacBook Pro detects external monitor but shows black screen. Unfortunately I don't have reputation to do so, so see my own answer below.)\n\nA: If you are having troubles with a black display it could be that your Mac has onboard graphics and a dedicated graphics card.\nMy specific model is one of those and as soon as I turned off Automatic Graphics switching (Apple Icon > System Preferences > Energy Saver > Tick Box for Automatic Graphics Switching) the problem immediately ceased.\nEnsure you do this for the relevant mode of use.

I realize that the process may be arduous, I just wanted to find out if it's even compatible.\nThanks!\n\nA: Out of the box, definable you not.  The 2013 MacBook Pro laptops use a proprietary PCIe interface whereas the 2012 used a SATA III interface.  \nThere may be a PCIe to SATA adapter, but I haven seen any that are compatible with the Mac’s proprietary interface.  Even so, SATA SSDs are very cost effective right now, so it’s not practical to add that extra layer of complexity by putting an adapter into the mix.\n\nA: mbp 2012: sata interface.\nmbp early 2013: also sata interface, so switch is easy.\nmbp late 2013 PCLE interface, thus impossible to switch, and then:\nPrice of a sata SSD 500GB lower that 100$, so buy a new one, format the new SSD and then clone the old 2012 disk to the new SSD while it is still outside, then the switch the SSDs could be easy.\n", "Q: Need printer driver for samsung ML-1210 compatible with Mac OS X 10.11.6 I use Mac OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan) and I would like to find and install a printer driver for an old samsung ML-1210 printer.  Can anyone help?  If yes, please tell me in simple terms, because I am not computer savvy!\n\nA: It’s unlikely you will find a printer driver for this model printer.\n\n\n*\n\n*It’s not listed anywhere on Samsung’s support site\n\n*I found a review of the printer from 2001 making it about 20 years old\n\n*A service manual I found online confirms that as it’s copyrighted in 2001 (page 79)\n\n*The specs found on C|Net lists Mac OS 8 as a supported OS and the latest release was 1999.\n\n*The most recent Mac printer driver I was able to find was for Snow Leopard (10.6.8) for the PowerPC Mac; you have an Intel Mac.\n\n\nHowever, there may be some hope...\n\n\n*\n\n*Though the printer specifications list the only emulation as “PrintThru” (I’ve personally never heard of it) it was quite common for printers to emulate “HP LaserJet”.  It can’t hurt to try that generic driver.\n\n*Since it supports Linux, You can try a generic CUPS driver.  I found this article How to install the Samsung ML-1210 printer on Mac OS X Lion (and higher). It uses an open source driver (not supported/provided by Samsung).\nKeep in mind this article is from 2011 making it 9 years old. It is technical, so you’ll want to get someone local to assist.  It's not feasible for us to test since we don't have access to that printer.\nBottom line... I’ll be the first to applaud your efforts to continue using “useful” equipment, but there comes a point of diminishing returns and if getting a printer working will cost more in time, labor and lost productivity than the price of new one, it’s time to go shopping.\nAs a buying tip, I suggest you stick with familiar names like HP, Lexmark, Xerox, etc. because you ensure the widest range of compatibility for the longest time.  For instance, I have a HP 2025dn (from 2008) that not only has current drivers, but emulates HP (obviously), PCL and PostScript.  If your printer can emulate any of these, you can get it to work.  Look in either the printer specifications page or in the user manual for confirmation.\n\nA: I have the same exact printer and I use it with multiple OSs.\nWith Linux and Windows it gets recognized instantly and you can print without problems.\nWith Mac (Big Sur) there is NO WAY to get it working (even GutenPrint does not provide drivers for ML-1210 but only for ML-1250).\nSo you have 2 solutions, and I've tried both of them:\n\n*\n\n*install a WinXP/7/10 virtual machine on your macbook and print from there (a clean installation will boot in few seconds from OSX)\n\n*set up a local Linux server with CUPS that will allow you to print from literally any device. I've tried with Mac, Win, Android and iOS, and printed flawlessly.\n\nCurrently I am using the 2nd solution as I've finally decided to have a local/home server.\n\nA: Should be availabe, right here:\nhttps://samsung-driver.net/samsung-ml-1210-driver-download/\n\nA: The advice by Allan to use a generic Samsung diver is a solution, but also I agree with his post to buy a new printer. Can you even find the cartridges for your prehistoric printer?\nPersonally I would not bother and buy a new printer, cost about 50-100 bucks.\n", "Q: How to disable xpc items from launchd? I sometimes encounter various tasks for com.apple.xpc.launchd in the system logs that give errors like Service only ran for 0 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 10 seconds. or Service exited with abnormal code: 78, etc.\nHow can I find and remove these services? It seems that they are not listed by traditional tools that I've seen and used so I'm not sure where they may be enumerated to the system to try to initialize and thus how to disable them...\n\nA: XPC Services\nXPC services are low level components within applications. They are not designed to be managed by the user and can not be individually disabled without breaking applications:\n\nThe XPC Services API, part of libSystem, provides a lightweight mechanism for basic interprocess communication integrated with Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) and launchd. The XPC Services API allows you to create lightweight helper tools, called XPC services, that perform work on behalf of your application.\n\nAs an example, Safari.app's XPC services are stored within:\n /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/XPCServices\n\nReport problems to the developer\nIn many cases, an XPC service behaviour is controlled by Apple's launchd implementation. Expect different behaviours for the exact same service between major macOS versions.\nIf there are specific XPC services causing serious problems, please tell the associated developer, be that Apple or a third party developer.\n", "Q: Subscription management with iTunes id (restrict the user from creating multiple subscription on same iTunes ID) I am working on an Auto-renewable subscription based application. We are using In-App purchase (StoreKit) option for the payment.\nI have 2 subscription plans.\n\n\n*\n\n*Monthly subscription\n\n*Yearly subscription\nAt the time of registration, the user should purchase any of the subscriptions mentioned above.\nThe problem I am facing can be stated as follows:\n-> The Apple device is logged in using an iTunes id itunesone@gmail.com\n-> One user say, userone@gmail.com creates an account in my app, and purchase a monthly subscription plan. \n-> Now the purchased subscription is associated with iTunes id itunesone@gmail.com\n-> Now, suppose if a second user say, usertwo@gmail.com tries to create another account with the same iTunes id itunesone@gmail.com\n-> My requirement is that I should not allow the user to create a second account with the same iTunes id. How can I accomplish this?\n-> If I allow the user to proceed and if the user tries to buy the same Monthly plan, apple store will return something like You are already subscribed to this plan. But if the user tries to purchase the second plan, that is the Yearly plan, An upgrade will happen which will completely mess up my backend.\n-> Is there any way to get some data which will uniquely represent each iTunes id? So, using this I can solve my issue. Or else what I can do to stop the user from creating another account when there is already a subscription exists with the same iTunes id? \nNote: Restore purchase was one option(not a good option, still). But it will confuse the user when there is a fresh registration happens and I don't think that is a good approach. \n\nA: The user's iTunes ID differs from their Apple ID.  It is easy to 'share' your iTunes ID but hard to share your Apple ID.  \nYour concern is a valid one but for a different reason.  No need to be concerned about two different users purchasing two different subscriptions.  But you could be concerned that two different users will share their iTunes ID and both benefit from a single purchase.  \nOne approach is to forget about it; it's a theft but not necessarily a loss of a real sale.  Another approach is to associate each purchase with the user's Apple ID using their iCloud key-value file.  Use that key-value file to implement your own restoreCompletedTransactions.  Do not allow a repurchase for free.  \n", "Q: Finder icons without thumbnail preview and a cross? Today I imported (MacOS Catalina, 10.15.3) some RAW and JPG images from my Canon EOS R camera using ImageCapture. They are 3 CR3 bracketed (AEB) images and the JPG HDR created by the camera. Strangely, some icons are not visible in the Finder, and have a 'cross' on the upper left corner:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The images are there: all can be opened in Preview, and Adobe DNG converter may convert them to DNG. The view option \"Show Icon Preview\" is enabled\n\n*I tried to create a thumbnail using a newly created 'quick action' in Automator, and to drag that thumbnail to the icon shown in the 'Info' window for the IMR_0138.CR3 file; nothing happened. And, yes, I have write permission on the file.\n\n*This is not related to the file type: JPG files in other folders have their icon, and one out of 3 CR3 files here has its icon.\n\n\nHow can I have my files with their thumbnails displayed?  Thank you in advance for any help!\n\nA: Although it looks 99.9% complete, I think the Mac still thinks they are being copied over.\nThe 'thermometer' at the bottom of the icon would suggest this; the x at the top is so you can cancel before the operation is complete.\n\nI'd try a reboot & see if that fixes it, otherwise try copy over again, maybe to a different folder.\nIf you were to look at them in List View, then the thermometer would be to the right of the file name, as either the same type of icon or as a 'pie chart', depending on version of macOS\nTwo views of a partially copied file, Icon & List.\n \n These were done with Apple Remote Desktop, so the X is in that app's interface, not on the icon.\n", "Q: Removing data without formatting the iPhone Suppose I have a very simply notes app that does not use iCloud. All it does is simply save strings of plain text to files and retrieve them.\nHow securely is the data associated to the app (the text files) on the actual phone disk deleted when deleting the app? For example: by holding on the app icon and deleting it vs. formatting the whole iPhone.\nCan it be recovered with special software/hardware?\n\nA: Assuming you're not talking about a very old iPhone (i.e. iPhone 5 or older), then every file created by any app is actually encrypted on disk. The plain text content is not stored on disk at any time.\nIn addition, every file is encrypted with a unique key - i.e. there's a seperate key for each file. The key for the file is stored alongside the encrypted file contents, but encrypted with a so called \"class key\" (depending on the settings in the app). This is the foundation of the key hierarchy in Apple's \"Data Protection\" scheme.\nWhen you delete an app manually, all the files stored locally by that app are deleted. This deletion of each individual file is actually done by simply deleting the per-file key. This makes it possible to delete even very large files quickly and securely at the same time.\n", "Q: How can I format my disk to APFS if I can’t boot in Recovery Mode? I am trying to upgrade my 2012 MacBook Pro from Mojave to Catalina. I swapped out the hard drive a few months ago for an SSD. \nWhen I try to go through the updater, I get the warning “This volume is not formatted as APFS.” \nI have seen online you can change the partition of the disk by booting into Recovery Mode. But when I do that, I get a spinning globe which then asks me to log into the Wi-Fi. I don’t know why, but it rejects the Wi-Fi password I put in, even though it works on my iPhone.\nIs there any way to format the disk as APFS, without going into Recovery Mode? Can I just wipe the whole disk or something and start from scratch, somehow?\n\nA: If you see the spinning globe icon at boot, and are prompted for an Internet connection, then technically you're in Internet Recovery Mode, which doesn't rely upon any local partition to boot.\nIf you can get your device connected to your network, either by using an Ethernet adapter or temporarily using a different or open wireless network, you'll be able to format the internal drive to APFS.\nYou may also wish to investigate using Mac Deploy Stick to create a bootable USB installer.\n", "Q: How to invoke character selection instead instead of key repeat? In most Mac applications I can hold down a key on the keyboard and get a popup to select the special character I need, such as the French accented vowels etc.\n\nUnfortunately when I hold down a key in OpenOffice, it seems to repeat the key.\nIs there a way to have OpenOffice offer me the normal MacOs special key selection?  If not, what is the way to get all the special characters from a qwerty keyboard?\nI found the following dialog, but the dialog is blocking.   I.e., when I bring it up, I cannot type anything in the OO window.  So I can just leave it up and click on the proper character when I need it.\n\nI am using OpenOffice: AOO417m1(Build:9800)  -  Rev. 46059c9192\n2019-09-05 10:18:25 (Thu, 05 Sep 2019) - Darwin x86_64\non macOS Catalina Version 10.15.3 (19D76)\nIn the meantime I found the following very obscure non-obvious key combinations which seem to work, even though the graphic itself is also confusing. \nPressing Option (or Alt) e followed e gives the é,  Alt-i e gives ê, and Alt-` e gives è.   I really wonder who came up with these.\n\nA: In case you are unable to somehow enable the feature you are looking for inside OpenOffice, you can use macOS's Character Viewer or the combining characters (diacritical marks), which you can get with dead keys, to get accented characters. A regular (keyboard) key that gives a combining character when pressed along with a modifier key such as the Alt ⌥ or Shift ⇧ key is called a dead key.\nThe keyboard shortcut for the Character Viewer (Kntrl ⌃+Command ⌘+Space ␣) does not seem to work inside OpenOffice's macOS version but,  when enabled, you can access it by clicking on the Input menu to the right of the menu bar at the top of your screen. You can enable the viewer via System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Show Keyboard & Emoji Viewers. \nTo get an accented character using a combining character instead, first put down a combining character such as ` ' \" ~ ^ and, quickly after that, the letter to be modified. For example, putting down the combining character ~ and the character a right after that would give you ã. You may have to press the Alt ⌥ or Shift ⇧ key along with one of the regular keys on your keyboard designated as a dead key to get a certain combining character depending on how your keyboard is configured. \nThe dead key yielding a certain combining character may be different than the key or key combination you press for a similar-looking punctuation mark. Because dead keys differ among different keyboard configurations (US and non-US QWERTY), you might either use the Keyboard Viewer or do some trial and error, i.e. press the Alt ⌥ or Shift ⇧ key and each one of the regular keys on your keyboard at the same time, to discover all the key combinations with the dead keys on your keyboard.\nTo find the key combinations through the Keyboard Viewer rather than trial&error, you should first enable the Keyboard Viewer via System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Show Keyboard & Emoji Viewers (same sequence as the Character Viewer). Then open the Keyboard Viewer from the Input menu to the right of the menu bar at the top of your screen (similar to the Character Viewer again). Once the Keyboard Viewer is opened, press and hold the Alt ⌥ or Shift ⇧ key and the dead keys are keys highlighted in orange. To utilize a designated key as a dead key in OpenOffice and elsewhere, you need to press the dead key along with whichever key (Alt ⌥ or Shift ⇧) you used to expose it in the Keyboard Viewer.\n\nA: I think OpenOffice does not support the popup accent menu.  But you should certainly be able use all the normal option key shortcuts and the Character Viewer and Keyboard Viewer.\n", "Q: Startup disk doesn't show my windows partition Macbook Pro late 2011 running High Sierra (10.13.6). I have swapped my HDD for an SSD and placed my HDD instead of my optical drive. \nI would like to install a Windows 7 partition on my SSD using bootcamp assistant. For that I have booted a windows 7.ISO on a USB (External physical volume), and successfully created a windows partition with bootcamp assist.

How can I get my macbook to force restart on my Windows Partition and read my usb stick?\nPS: I downloaded my bootcamp drivers and have them on a separate USB + on my OS desktop\n\n\n\n\nA: A previous answer, which will get Windows 7 installed on your Mac, can be found at Installing Windows 7 or 10 Pro 64 bit without DVD or Flash Drive.\nIf you have the Windows 7 product key, then you should make sure you have the latest Windows 7 iso download. You can get this from Download Windows 7 Disc Images (ISO Files).\nI will point out that the Windows 7 product key can also be used to install Windows 10 for free. The latest Windows 10 can be found at Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File). Instruction for installing Windows 10 can be found at How to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools?.\nAddendum\nYou could also probably install Windows 7 by first booting from a Windows 10 USB installer. This would then require using the CLI to install Windows 7 to an internal drive. The instructions would be similar to this answer. If interested, I could include updated instructions.\n", "Q: Detecting theft of data - folder / files transfered from MacBook to USB I know this is similar to another question posted here a while ago: \nDid someone copy files from my Mac?\nbut the problem is slightly different and the answers don't help in my case.\nI need to know with a 100% certainty whether data from a MacBook laptop has been copied onto a USB key. I suspect that sensitive folders and files were copied. The question is would forensics be able to know whether copies were made and exactly what folders and files were copied?Assume also that the time it was done for appx. 1 month ago.\nSurely there must be some sort of way to know what files / folder and how large it was was copied?\n\nA: TL;DR: With a standard install of macOS it isn't possible to determine with any certainty whether data has been copied from the Mac onto an USB or network device\n\nThis is one of those questions where it's \"a duplicate but not a duplicate because the answer doesn't work for me.\"\nHere's a quick summary that addresses your question of whether or not you can detect if someone copied your files (to a USB):\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't actually know if the file was copied. The problem with the answer from the linked question (and what makes this not a dupe) is that it only tells you if the file was accessed, not if it was copied to another location.  To elaborate, if the person double clicked on the file and closed it it would show it was accessed.  This is why you can't have your \"100% certainty\" (or even 50% certainty) as you state.\n\n*The logs don't record this activity.  There will be nothing in the logs because even if you look through all the system logs, it will only show that a USB device was attached/detached.  It doesn't tell you what was done with that USB device.\nTo do this and to have proof positive that this activity occurred, you need to enable Auditing and this is accomplished with OpenBSM.  Understand, it's not turned on by default because it would generate tons of log entries using up system resources as it monitors activities. From a system resource perspective, auditing is an \"expensive\" function to perform.\nThe problem with this and the linked question is that you're looking for an audit trail post hoc.  This is like wanting to have security camera footage of a break in when the security cameras weren't installed and operating prior to the breach.\n", "Q: Why erase a stolen iPad? I recently had my iPad stolen. I immediately marked it as lost in case it ever connected to the internet again (it is cellular enabled, so there is a favorably good chance). I clicked \"erase iPad\" but stopped when the prompt said \"An erased iPad cannot be located or tracked any longer.\"\nI began to wonder: how secure is my iPad's data? Is there any risk that the device may be hacked and its contents exposed? Passwords, credit cards, emails, etc.?\nA simple google search found that iPads are very secure by virtue of the passcode (https://www.macworld.com/article/1160313/iPad_security.html). So, if left unerased, what risk remains? Certainly, I want to be able to track the iPad if it does ever come back online. But by not opting to erase the iPad, am I leaving myself potentially exposed?\n\n\nA: In short, you erase it if -  & only if - the data on it would be more costly to lose than the price of a new iDevice. Some businesses consider their data to be worth far more to a 'spy' than the device itself.\nIf you're a 'regular guy' your best bet would probably be to leave it locked & registered actively with FindMy, just in case it ever shows up again. To all intents & purposes, any other 'regular guy' who took it now owns a very shiny brick.\nIf you're an international terrorist, business owner with a new patent, scientist with the formula to a cure for the common cold, or a government employee with national secrets on there - then you may consider total deletion a better bet - just in case another business/government agency considers it worth half a million bucks to hack into it.\niDevices are very secure - but nothing is impenetrable.\n", "Q: Can't remote login after startup I have an iMac running Catalina (10.15.2) that I don't have a keyboard or mouse plugged into. I just want to use it via screen sharing and SSH.\nThe problem is that often when I want to use it I can't. SSH hangs, screen sharing won't connect. I've tried restarting it via the power button, but even when it gets to the login screen I can't use SSH or screen sharing.\nThe only thing that seems to work is plugging in a keyboard and mouse, and logging in the normal way. Then SSH and screen sharing start working. They continue to work for a while. Eventually I come back and it's back in a bad state.\nIn Energy Saver settings I checked \"Prevent computer from sleeping\" and \"Wake for network access\" as well as \"Start up automatically after power failure\", power nap and hard disk sleep are unchecked.\n\nA: This is caused by having FileVault enabled in the security settings. The disk won't decrypt until someone logs in, so services like remote desktop and sshd won't start until then.\n", "Q: iPod Touch 1st Gen songs stuck on repeat My iPod touch (1st gen) is stuck on repeat.

I clicked on \"Now Playing\" After which I clicked on the \"Play\" button to start the song. Staying in portrait mode I touched the screen once (where the default song icon is) and the song time along with the shuffle and repeat option slid down.

Neither is it milliseconds since there  are only 2 digits. It's 75 hundredths of a second.\nPicture showing longer-running processes, more clearly indicating hh:mm:ss.ss/100\n\n\nA: Respectfully, I am not sure this was answered. You wrote:\n\"....more clearly indicating hh:mm:ss.ss/100\", and your logic is understandable. But, on my view of Activity Monitor, it is clearly showing values longer that the amount of time a particular app (or process) has been active.

There is no obvious cause.\nI'm using an Apple Magic Keyboard With Numeric Pad, with a 2018 Mac Mini running macOS 10.15.3, but the issue began under 10.15.2 (I had hoped the update/restart would fix it).\nOther things I've already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've checked the behaviour under System Preferences -> Keyboard (it doesn't seem to be a function key issue, as the media keys don't work either pressing the Fn key or not).\n\n*Reset NVRAM\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n\nThe fact that this is only affecting one specific account is the part that has me confused; of all my accounts it's the one I would least expect to have a problem, but the one in which it is most annoying, as it's the one I use for watching TV shows/movies (i.e- minimal running programs, no distractions etc.).\nAlso it's strange that the issue is affecting both the media keys and volume keys; I've noticed all kinds of annoyances with macOS' bonkers media key behaviour with apps fighting for focus so in any given moment I have no idea what play/pause will actually do, but I've never had any issue with the volume control keys, which also do not work for this user account.\nIve also checked my keyboard shortcuts; but I only have shortcuts for other keys (F5 and F6, and F13, F14 and F15, i.e- all the \"blank\" function keys on my keyboard that do not have special behaviours).\nNow, if there's no other way to resolve this issue, I'll of course have to remove and recreate the user account; not the end of the world, but I'd very much like to avoid having to do this if I can.\nDoes anyone know of any likely reasons why a single user account would have non-functioning media and volume keys, when all others are functioning normally, and how I would go about fixing it?\n\nA: So I typed this whole thing out and the culprit presented itself right after I posted it!\nI have a trackball by Elecom, love it, but apparently there was a problem with their Elecom Mouse Assistant software; an error message popped up, so I force quit it, trashed its settings and relaunched it, and now my media keys are fine again.\nIt must have something to do with the ability to remap the mouse buttons to various functions (volume and media functions being some of them).\nFor anyone that experiences the same problem, and has Elecom Mouse Assistant installed, you may wish to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Relaunch the app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open mouse assistant (from System Preferences)\n\n*Make a minor change (e.g- assign a mouse wheel click function), and click Apply.\n\n*Check your media keys, this may have resolved your issue.\n\n*If necessary, re-open mouse assistant and change your settings back to the way you wanted them.\n\n\n*If that doesn't work, you may try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate your settings file and delete it. This appears to be a hidden XML file stored under your user directory, so it will most easily be found using Terminal:\n\n*Open Terminal.app\n\n*Enter the following command and hit enter: ls -al\n\n*Look for a strangely named file with the .xml extension. I'm not sure of the naming convention, it may be model specific, but mine is: .VID056e_PID00fc.xml\n\n*Remove the file using the rm command, substituting in the correct name for the file, like so: rm ~/.VID056e_PID00fc.xml\n\n*Logout of the user account, and then log back in again\n\n\n\nUsing either option your normal use of your media and volume keys should be restored without having to uninstall mouse assistant.\nI won't mark this as the right answer, but may leave the question in place in case anyone else has the same issue, or has other causes they would like to document for others.\n", "Q: How to fix the App Store after upgrading to macOS Catalina? Cannot open the App Store, after upgrading to macOS Catalina 10.15.3.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalled macOS Catalina.\n\n*Clearing cache and removing all the related folders as given at : How to fix / Reset App Store app on Mac OSX - El Capitan\n\nA: What I have done is delete the App Store key chain entry in Finder, Application, Utilities, Keychain Access and the search for appstore.

Preview always opens the document to page 1. Adobe Acrobat Mac/Win will open the document on the specified page. Does Preview support this functionality?\n\nA: No. Preview does not respect the PDF Initial View metadata. Other Readers, such as Skim and PDFPen Pro, also do not. Instead, all of these apps open at page 1 and then remember the last page viewed for the next time the document is opened. Foxit Reader does respect the Initial View.\nYour best solution is to provide a Table of Contents (aka Bookmarks, Outlines), so that users can easily click to the desired page.\nIt's worth noting that Preview's own 'Bookmarks' are not PDF-standard, and will not be displayed by any other PDF Viewer.\n\nA: Yes indirectly. Go to the page you wish to open your file to next time you open it in Preview. Once there go to the File menu and select save. Then close the file. Next time you open the file in Preview it will open to that spot.\n", "Q: Regarding AppleScript, is it possible to change \"page layout\" export option when exporting Numbers documents to PDF? A little while ago I cobbled together a short AppleScript for exporting multiple Pages documents to PDF at one time, and now I want to do the same with Numbers. The basic principle is the same and the script basically just carries over EXCEPT the actual exporting to PDF part.\nhere is an excerpt:\ntell application \"Numbers\"\n    export front document to file exportFile as PDF with properties {image quality:Best}\nend tell\n\nThis succeeds in exporting a PDF, but the problem I have is that the above command uses the \"fit each sheet to a single page\" setting by default for whatever reason. I would rather it \"use print settings\" and export multiple pages for a single large sheet just like when printing (you know, the useful format).\nThese options are presented in the Export to PDF dialog box alongside \"Image Quality\" and \"Require password to open\" but not as export options in the script dictionary for Numbers. And the script command defaults to a different setting than the dialog box. I've tried to guess / search what I can do to change the setting automatically, but obviously with no such luck.\nI am hoping, beyond all reason, that there is someway I can access this setting / property via AppleScript. And hopefully without using SystemEvents in any way. Any ideas?\nmuch appreciated in advance...\nEDIT with my final solution:\nMy original goal was to automatically export multiple Numbers files in different locations to PDF. Several hurdles I had were saving to any arbitrary location (including network mounted volumes) this requires a complete POSIX path, extracting the file location as alias (?) type and converting to POSIX, and sequencing the Finder -> Numbers operation so that the script slowed down enough and did enough checking that the document was open so that it didn't just crash every time. This is what I ended up with (please forgive my probably bad process confirmation and lack of error handling):\ntell application \"Finder\"\nset theSelection to selection\nrepeat with oneItem in theSelection     (*repeat the entire export process for 1 document at a time*)\n    set finderLocation to oneItem as text\n    set nameOfDocument to name of oneItem\n    open oneItem\n\n    tell application \"Numbers\"\n        set idx to 0     (*wait until Numbers is open with a document*)\n        repeat until (exists document nameOfDocument)\n            delay 0.1\n            set idx to idx + 1\n            if idx > 1000 then quit\n        end repeat\n\n        set idx to 0     (*wait target document is at the front*)\n        set pagesLocation to file of front document as text\n        repeat until finderLocation = pagesLocation\n            delay 0.1\n            set pagesLocation to file of front document as text\n            set idx to idx + 1\n            if idx > 1000 then quit\n        end repeat\n\n        set exportFile to file of front document     (*get file location of document as file type*)\n    end tell\n\n    (*change file path for use when saving: convert file type to POSIX type, replace .numbers ext with .pdf, remove leading '/'*)\n    set exportFile to POSIX path of exportFile\n    set exportFile to text 1 thru -8 of exportFile\n    set exportFile to exportFile & \"pdf\"\n    set exportFileCharCount to count characters of exportFile\n    set exportFile to text 2 thru exportFileCharCount of exportFile\n\n    activate application \"Numbers\"\n\n    delay 0.2\n\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Numbers\"\n\n        (*export whole document to pdf with settings*)\n        click menu item 1 of menu 1 of menu item \"Export To\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"File\" of menu bar 1\n\n        tell sheet 1 of window 1\n            click radio button \"Use print settings\" of radio group 1\n            click pop up button 1\n            click menu item \"Best\" of menu 1 of pop up button 1\n            click button \"Next…\"\n            delay 1\n            tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"/\"     (*type leading '/' in order to trigger the ability to type any arbitrary location to save to*)\n            delay 1\n            tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke exportFile & return     (*type the rest of the target file location in POSIX and accept entry*)\n            delay 0.5\n            click button \"Export\"\n        end tell\n\n    end tell\n    tell application \"Numbers\" to close front document without saving\nend repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: As I mentioned in a comment to the OP... If the properties do not exist in the dictionary then you'll probably have to use System Events.\nThe following example AppleScript code can be used to implement a UI Scripting solution even though that is not your first choice:\nactivate application \"Numbers\"\n\ndelay 0.2\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Numbers\"\n    click menu item 1 of menu 1 of menu item \"Export To\" of ¬\n        menu 1 of menu bar item \"File\" of menu bar 1\n    tell sheet 1 of window 1\n        click radio button \"Use print settings\" of radio group 1\n        click pop up button 1\n        click menu item \"Best\" of menu 1 of pop up button 1\n        click button \"Next…\"\n        delay 0.5\n        click pop up button 1\n        click menu item \"Documents\" of menu 1 of pop up button 1\n        click button \"Export\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nNote that as currently coded it assumes you have a document already opened in Numbers and will trigger this using a keyboard shortcut by one of the many means available, which includes third-party apps.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between some events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 15\" turns black after opening past vertical Im using a MacBook Pro 15\" 2017 Touch Bar which is different than this other MacBook screen goes black when opened past vertical.\nTried all the NVRAM and SMC recommended fixes, but neither have fixed it. Seems like hardware issue and it seems to be getting worse...\nIn order to use it, i need to open the screen slowly. After it passes ~45 degrees each ~15 degrees the screen brightness drops by a little. Then right around 90 degrees (vertical), it goes black. To bring it back I have to close it again and open slowly.\nWhen screen first went black on me and problem started (one week ago) I was still able to open to just past 90, now it’s gone down to just under 90 and making it hard to work...\n\nA: It is an hardware issue. I had the same issue with my MacBookPro 2016, 15 inch touchbar. I took it to a technician and  he fixed it for $180. The problem was with cable which connects board with screen. To technician, apple installed it tight in certain mac models so that it broke when close and open the lid after certain time.

How can I connect my mid 2011 iMac to a second monitor to extend my screen? The monitor is an HP L1950. The ports my mac has can be seen here: \n\n\nA: Your iMac has a Thunderbolt 2 connector which also acts as a Mini DisplayPort. \nSince your Monitor supports (15-Pin D-Sub) VGA or DVI-D you either need a Mini-DisplayPort to VGA or to DVI-D cable. I would recommend getting a DVI-D (e.g from Amazon, your local store might have one of the mentioned options as well), since it is the newer and slightly better standard, though VGA is (for old) equipment more common.\nIn general though, this is old Hardware and HDMI is more or less standard now.\n", "Q: How to mount EXT4 disk on 10.15? Since I have osxfuse installed it would be nice if I could use it. There are a lot of (heavily) outdated articles here, saying that it is not possible. Is this still the case?\n\nA: \nUpdate: According to this document in homebrew-core from November 2020, Homebrew maintainers no longer update or support macFUSE formulae, and Homebrew's continuous integration doesn't test them. macFUSE formulae will eventually be removed in the indeterminate future.\nSpecifically, ext4fuse (mentioned below in the post) is disabled:\nbrew install ext4fuse\nError: ext4fuse has been disabled because it requires closed-source macFUSE!\n\nThe reason for this is that FUSE for macOS does not have a license that is compatible with Homebrew.\n\nMac does not support ext4 file system. If you plug in a hard drive, Mac won't recognize it. Fortunately, there are several ways to handle this situation.\n1. Temporary options: Use VM\nJust install a version of Ubuntu, or whatever your Linux distribution of choice is, in a virtual machine host like VirtualBox, then mount the drive as you would any other and read away.\n2. Add ext4 support for macOS\nIf you regularly use ext4 formatted drives and / or need to copy multiple files from there to the macOS drive, you need a better option.\nYou need to install macFUSE (osxfuse has been succeeded by macfuse as of version 4.0.0) and ext4fuse. The easiest way to install ext4fuse is to use Homebrew. Note that ext4fuse us a read-only implementation of ext4 for FUSE to browse ext4 volumes and it cannot be used to write into ext4 volumes.\nFirst, download and install macFUSE from their releases page or install it using Homebrew.\nbrew install --cask macfuse\n\nThen use Homebrew to install ext4fuse.\nbrew install ext4fuse\n\nAfter installing the ext4 support software, you now need to determine the hard drive you want to mount. To do this, run the following command:\ndiskutil list \n\nSave the partition ID (will look like /dev/disk3s1). Then, run the following command to mount the hard drive:\nsudo ext4fuse /dev/disk3s1 ~/tmp/ext4_support_PARTITION -o allow_other\n\next4_support above can be any name you choose. Now, navigate to the '/ tmp /' directory in the Finder and you will see the contents of the partition listed. If your drive has multiple partitions, you can mount them using the same steps as above. Just make sure to use different directory names to mount them.\nUpdate\nAttempting to install ext4fuse with brew results in an error. (See issue #66 on GitHub), so instead use the following commands to install it:\ncurl -s -o ext4fuse.rb https://gist.githubusercontent.com/n-stone/413e407c8fd73683e7e926e10e27dd4e/raw/12b463eb0be3421bdda5db8ef967bfafbaa915c5/ext4fuse.rb\nbrew install --formula --build-from-source ./ext4fuse.rb\nrm ./ext4fuse.rb\n\nWarning\nAlthough these tools can help you read ext4 formatted hard drives, they are not stable. As long as you are mounting read-only drives, as what is being done in this solution, you will not have many risks. If you try to use these tools to write to an ext4 drive, you may lose data.\nIf you need to move files back and forth on a shared drive with Linux, this method is not recommended. Instead, use another file system like ExFAT or try the commercial option listed below\n3. Use Paid Software\nSoftware such as Paragon offers a free trial version, but to be safe, you should back up your hard drive first, in case there is a problem. If you want to buy software, it is available for 40$\nNote: I haven't used this tool and can't say anything about what they have promised.\nAlthough reading ext4 format on macOS is no longer an impossible task, it is frustrating when Apple does not support this format.\nTry it on your own risk but I strongly recommend the first solution which is easy and convenient.\n\nA: For newer macs, e.g. Catalina, brew install macfuse instead of brew install osxfuse will work\n\nA: With regards to the prior answer by @Udhy only the VM option has any chance of working but with a major caveat that it is VERY slow (I never got better than 30mb/sec).\nParagon simply does not work, refuses to mount any of my EXT4 disks.  Not sure why, maybe a Catalina issue?  However I'm not going to pay them so they can tell me we're SOL.\next4fuse is a waste of time, it has not supported the last 3 versions of OSX so unless you're pre-Sierra this is not an option.  There's an open issue in the Github: https://github.com/gerard/ext4fuse/issues/36\nIt's five year's old and his last reply was 3 years ago, so don't get your hopes up.\n\nA: The only way I have been able to read/write ext4 is by using a virtual machine such as Virtual Box, running Linux (e.g., Linuxmint). It's odd that Paragon doesn't work in Catalina. Ext4fuse only gave me errors.\n", "Q: How to add keyboard shortcut for \"Move to Predicted Mailbox\" in Apple Mail? In Apple Mail (under macOS Catalina, 10.15.3) there is a menu item \"Move to Predicted Mailbox\" .\nIt already has a keyboard shortcut ^ CMD M.\nI would like to change that to something else.\nNow, the problem is that this menu item changes every time I select a different message, depending on the folder Mail predicts.

Please could anybody suggest a cure?\nPath:                  /usr/local/McAfee/fmp/bin/fmpd\nIdentifier:            fmpd\nVersion:               ???\nCode Type:             X86 (Native)\nParent Process:        launchd [1]\nResponsible:           fmpd [85698]\nUser ID:               0\n\nDate/Time:             2020-02-04 [redacted]\nOS Version:            Mac OS X 10.14.5 (18F132)\nReport Version:        12\nAnonymous UUID:        [redacted]\n\nSleep/Wake UUID:       [redacted]\nTime Awake Since Boot: 180000 seconds\nTime Since Wake:       9400 seconds\n\nSystem Integrity Protection: enabled\n\nCrashed Thread:        0\n\nException Type:        EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)\nException Codes:       0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000\nException Note:        EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY\n\nTermination Reason:    DYLD, [0x1] Library missing\n\nApplication Specific Information:\ndyld: launch, loading dependent libraries\nDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/McAfee/fmp/lib\n\nDyld Error Message:\n  Library not loaded: /Library/McAfee/*/libeventwriter.4.dylib\n  Referenced from: /usr/local/McAfee/fmp/bin/fmpd\n  Reason: image not found```\n\n\nA: Two solutions are offered by this page in the McAfee documentation: https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB88461. The first solution is similar to the one in the link in IconDaemon's comment, and it didn't work for me. I have tried the second solution (boot in safe mode, and remove the listed McAfee files) and will post a comment if I continue to have the problem.\n", "Q: How do I export a Pages document on my iPad to PDF and save it in Files? On the Apple Pages iPad app, you can export a document to PDF. When it creates the PDF, it gives you the option to “Share” it. There are many apps you can share it to, including Gmail, Notes, and Books, but you cannot just share it directly to Files. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: When I save a file as a PDF a panel opens as shown below. there you can save it to files. What version of iPadOS are you running?\n\n", "Q: Running perl shell script from AppleScript on Mojave I have a simple AppleScript that calls a perl shell script to replace a string with another string (here one with two) in files with specified file extensions (here .txt and .xyz). \nIt used to work exactly as I have it below, but no longer does (possibly since updating to Mojave last year).\nset CleanFiles to \"\n    s/one/two/g;\n    \"\n\nset myFolder to choose folder with prompt \"Choose a folder with files to be cleaned up:\"\nset theFolder to POSIX path of myFolder\n\ndo shell script \"find \" & theFolder & \" \\\\( -name \\\\*.txt -o -name \\\\*.xyz \\\\) -print0 | xargs -0 perl -i -pe '\" & CleanFiles & \"'\"\n\nThere is no error message, it seems to run but doesn't do anything. \nWhat could be wrong? \n\nA: The issue is that you need to quote file paths for unix, using the quoted form of command in AppleScript.  In other words, line three should read:\nset theFolder to quoted form of (POSIX path of myFolder)\n\nThe problem happens because Mac variables can legally contain special characters — like spaces and single quotes — that the unix system uses. So, if you were to choose a folder named \"My Test Folder\", AppleScript would return its posix path as /Users/username/My Test Folder, but the command line invoked by do shell script would read that as three separate arguments, not one single file path. The quoted form of command quotes and escapes any unix special characters in the line of text so that they are not interpreted as special characters by the shell.\n", "Q: How to recover an accidentally deleted new pages document I accidentally clicked \"delete\" (clicked too fast thinking it was cancel) on the save new document prompt when exiting Pages. After one bad click, the file is completely gone, with no clear way to undo the mistake.\nHow can I recover (some version) of this lost document?\n\nA: For anyone else that might have done this, here is my solution:\nI created another new document with a unique string and searched spotlight to find the directory where autosaved Pages files live. With that directory open in Finder, I could use Time Machine to find the old autosaved file (\"Unsaved Pages Document.pages\") from an hour ago.\nFor me the directory was: \n\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iWork.Pages/Data/Library/Autosave\n  Information\n\n", "Q: Windows key does not work on Amazon WorkSpaces Client with external USB keyboard I'm using Amazon WorkSpaces Client 2.5.11.120 on macOS 10.15.3 with an external USB keyboard. The Windows key ⊞ Win doesn't work. All other keys work except the Windows key; is there any solution or workaround to get Windows key working?\n\nA: By default the WorkSpaces client remaps the ⌘ Cmd on the Mac to Ctrl in Windows. You can disable this behaviour with this hidden preference for the WorkSpaces client:\ndefaults write \"com.amazon.Amazon WorkSpaces Client\" remap_cmd_to_ctrl 0\n\nAfter running this command, quit the WorkSpaces client then start it up again. When you log into your WorkSpace now, the ⌘ Cmd key on your Mac will map to the ⊞ Win key in your Windows VM.\nOne caveat: if you switch out to another Mac app using ⌘ Cmd + Tab, you'll notice that the Start menu in Windows has popped up when you return to the VM. This seems to be unavoidable.\nAfter making this change, you'll have to use the Windows keyboard shortcuts for clipboard operations like copy Ctrl+C and paste Ctrl+V, rather than the familiar Mac shortcuts. Presumably Amazon changes the default behaviour to make it easier for Mac users to use the clipboard.\nI tested with an external USB keyboard (the Apple A1243 MB110LL/B) and observed exactly the same behaviour, so it doesn't seem to be a problem with external keyboards.\nConfirmed with WorkSpaces Client 3.0.5.1024.\n\nA: I too had the same issue. Even after disconnecting and reconnecting, the same problem continued to exist.\nAfter some time, it was working.\nI did restart by closing the AWS window and then re-logged in, and it worked then.\nI don't know the exact solution, but it worked.\n", "Q: Can Find My Mac locate laptops that have been wiped? Can the new Find My service from Apple locate laptops even if the disk is wiped?\nI had a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) running macOS 10.15 Catalina that was linked to an iCloud account and had Find My Mac enabled. This laptop recently went missing; it's still connected to my iCloud account and still shows up in the list of all devices, but only as Offline.\nAccording to news articles, a Mac running 10.15 will periodically emit a locator beacon using Bluetooth Low Energy when it's awake or sleeping (but not while powered off, I assume).\n\nIn upcoming versions of iOS and macOS, the new Find My feature will broadcast Bluetooth signals from Apple devices even when they're offline, allowing nearby Apple devices to relay their location to the cloud. Wired\n\nWould the laptop still emit a Bluetooth locator beacon that could be picked up by other macOS/iOS devices, even if the disk has been wiped?\n\nA: If you use the Find My application to remote wipe your Mac you will no longer be able to track it.\n\nAll content and settings will be erased when this Mac connects to the Internet.  An erased Mac cannot be located or tracked any longer.\n\nFor further details see the Apple Support document If your Mac is lost or stolen.\nBottom line...if your Mac is wiped, whether remote or done locally, it will no longer be tracked.  Most likely it’s been sold for parts if the security cannot be bypassed.\n", "Q: Not sure whats happening here (cant update past 10.15.1 - late 2012 mac mini) Consider the image\n\nSo I downloaded the delta and combo 10.15.2 update for mac osx. I first started noticing something odd when I re-installed catalina on my mac mini 2012 - which is supported. \nAs you can see I have over 900 gigs of space on this SSHD - it is a hybryd drive, never had an issue with updates previously, never had an issue till today.\nFor context, I did reinstall, what did that entail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erasing the HDD that contained the OS (the one highlighted).\n\n*Installing the OS to that HDD\n\n\nI am not on beta preview or anything like that and the regular software update states:\n\nI tried installing in safe mode, wouldn't let me. For the reason described above in the first image.\nAs far as I know there should be nothing wrong with the HDD or no \"compatibility issues\" with the HDD, previously I was on beta for the last OSX installation High Sierra and all the updates came through including the beta catalina updates and so on and so forth, the reason I decided to reinstall after so long was Catalina beta updates felt like windows vista - nothing would work properly.\nI do use home brew and home brew cask to install things but out side of PHP, MYSQL, Atom, Imigmagick and a few other things related to web development I have not installed any software that would be \"incompatible\" with future updates.\nI did originally try to go from 10.15.1 to 10.15.3 but someone on another stack question said no, go in order 10.x.1, 10.x.2 and so on.\nSo can some one tell me whats going on?\nPlease tell me this will not require me to erase and reinstall I would be very sad. While it wont take me long to get up and going again I would rather avoid that situation if at all possible.\nPS: I don't know enough about bootable USB's when it comes to macs, and while I do back everything up.  I would also like to avoid that route as from other stack questions it seemed dangerous or could fail. If reformatting is the only option is there any steps I need to take to make sure the disk is compatible with future updates? \n\nA: I found a solution:\nSo as unknown domain pointed out, I did originally after reinstalling catalina enroll in beta program only because my backups were in the beta installation.\nBut after realizing I could indeed get the info I needed from my backup disk with out having to be in the beta I unenrolled by clicking detail and restore to default.\nAs the internet points out that doesnt restore you back to non beta catalina. So what I did was redownload the catalina installation from the mac store and reinstall. I did not loose any data, it just installs it over top the beta version with out any data loss.\nThis solved my issue and now I am at 10.15.3 as we speak.\nI can accept this answer in two days. I hope it helps others who might be in a similar situation.\n", "Q: Can MacBook 2018 output to a 4k external display? I've got a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can a MacBook Pro 2018 output 4K?\n\n*What options are there?\n\n*What kind of budget am I looking at?\n\n\nI am obviously not gaming I do some media production, also looking to get some kind of docking station. A decent refresh rate would be nice! \nMy computer specs:\n\n\nA: Q1: Can a MacBook Pro 2018 output 4K?\nApple has a technical specifications page for almost every product they sell burried in their knowledge base.\nThis is the one for your computer, it states:\n\nVideo Support\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display at millions of colors and:\n\n*\n\n*Up to two displays with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\n\n*Up to four displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\n\n\nSo yes your computer can output consumer 4K (UHD/Quad HD/2160p) 3840x2160, but also  4096×2160 (DCI 4K) on up to 4 displays at once.\nThere will be performance limitations when running like this.\nQ2: What options are there?\nThere are a wide range of monitors on the market it would be impossible to really answer this, sites like YouTube provide a broad range of reviews for displays, I have one in mind that I would recommend but don't feel it approriate to do so on this type of website.\nQ3: What kind of budget am I looking at?\nThis is also hard to address as prices in your country will be different from mine, but 4K monitors are very affordable now, however stick to known brands and be careful to ensure you get ones with modern connectivity like USB-C which are going to work well with your laptop, and that possibly having charging integrated.\n", "Q: Installing an older version of macOS onto an external drive So I’ve got an oddly specific question.\nI’m trying to install macOS Sierra onto a hard drive that I’m planning on installing into an old (potentially broken) 2011 iMac that currently does not have a hard drive. The problem is that the app from Apple’s installer can only be run on a Mac running Sierra (or earlier), which I do not possess.\nIs there any way to install it onto the drive directly without an older Mac?\nEDIT:\nI realize that more details of my scenario and what I have tried may be helpful.\nMy exact drive scenario is that I know the 2011 iMac does not have a drive inside of it. I have a 3.5\" hard drive that I'm planning on installing, and an external SATA to USB enclosure. I want to install macOS on the drive first, because it's possible that something else is broken on the Mac, and I want to isolate it to not be something with a boot drive problem.\nI have a 2018 MacBook Pro and access to a 2014 MacBook Pro (both running Catalina). I downloaded macOS Sierra from the support page I linked earlier, and ran the .pkg installer to get the Install macOS Sierra app (this only worked on the 2014 MBP, presumably because the 2018 shipped with  Mojave).\nThen, when attempting to open the Install app on either computer, I got the following error: This copy of the \"Install macOS\" application is too old to be opened on this version of macOS.\nAs such, not having access to a Mac running Sierra or earlier, I attempted to create a bootable drive, but that errored out with the following error:\nTerminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Couldn't posix_spawn: error 35'\nI don't exactly know where to go from here.\n\nA: I’m assuming your ultimate goal is to get that 2011 iMac up and running, but you’re experiencing trepidation about the prospect of replacing the internal disk drive because it’s behind a large glass screen.\nYou don’t need to install macOS onto an external drive to get things working. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a USB installer. This model iMac supports Internet Recovery as well so this may be an option.  I personally prefer to have and use offline USB installers. \n\n*Replace the broken drive.  The 2011 iMac’s glass screen is held in place with magnets and the display is secured with Torx screws.  It’s actually an easy fix as described in this post (see TL;DR section)\n\n*You may need the in-line temperature sensor to prevent your fans from spinning up to full speed because the sensor came with the hard drive in these models.\n\n\nYou will then be able to boot your 2011 iMac, install your OS with the USB installer or Internet Recovery and ultimately have a fully operational iMac.\n", "Q: Could not access apple developer resource (Certificates, IDs & Profiles) I joined a paid Apple Developer Enterprise Program last two years with admin access, recently I found I don't have the certificate & provisioning profiles page permissions anymore.

In this case, your model MacBook - 2017 13 inch MacBook Pro - has enough bandwidth to support two monitors at 4K or less or just one monitor at 5K.\nThe Thunderbolt information page gives you a generalized perspective of Thunderbolt’s capabilities.\n\nA: According to the technical specification of your model:\n\nVideo Support\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display at millions of colors and:\n\n*\n\n*One display with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\n\n\n*Up to two displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at millions of colors\n\n\n*Up to two displays with 3840-by-2160 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\nThunderbolt 3 digital video output\n\n*\n\n*Native DisplayPort output over USB‑C\n\n*VGA, HDMI, DVI, and Thunderbolt 2 output supported using adapters (sold separately)\n\n\ntherefore you can have 3 active screens including the screen of your MacBook.\nThe 2 connected monitor can have a resolution up to 4K.\nIf you wish to connect a monitor with higher resolution than 4K (e.g. 5K), you will be able to connect only 1 additional monitor (i.e. 2 active screen configuration).\nIn general, to be able to connect even more monitors you need to have a dedicated GPU. A similar question was addressed here.\n\nA: I have tried plugging in an Apple thunderbolt display using Apple's own USB-C to thunderbolt adapter (purchased from the apple store) - works great. - I can also connect a Dell 1080p, USB-C monitor -- but not both at the same time. - I am considering trying with a diff monitor.\n", "Q: Monitor & restart SecurityAgent Process We are running Mac Pro's with 64GB & 10.12 as VDI-Servers.\nWe have problems with the SecurityAgent. The process will take more than 100% CPU (how can this be?) after 6 hours of work according to top. \nAt this point no user can login anymore. We have to reboot or kill one or more SecurityAgent instances (Sometimes there are more then 5 instances running)\nI would like to monitor this and restart the Service when the CPU load exeeds a given limit.\nMy questions are :\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I determine the CPU load for this process and their instances with a shell-script?\n\n*Since simply killing the process seems to be a bad idea, I would like to restart (kickstart?) the process instead. How can I achieve this?\n\n\nA: Security Agent\nThe Security Agent is a separate process that provides the user interface for the Security Server in macOS (not iOS). Its primary purpose is to request authentication whenever an app requests additional privileges.\nTest by running in Safe Mode. \nBoot into safe mode then restart normally. This clears out a number of caches that may stop the process from eating up so much CPU time. Safe mode is much slower than a normal startup, so be patient.\nHow to boot macOS in Safe Mode \n\n\n*\n\n*Start or restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key. The Apple logo appears on your display.\n\n*Release the Shift key when you see the login window.

I am aware of the Emacs shortcut CMD-E (see this answer) - but this behaves differently: it will select the text till the next \"line break character\", not till the end of a visible line. I.e., if there is an \"automatic\" line break in the browser which is not because of a corresponding line break in the HTML source code, the Emacs-like command will select the whole block, typically until the end of the current paragraph, not only the text till the \"visible line break\".\nIn contrast, in-text editors or MS Word, SHIFT-CMD-RIGHTARROW will select text only till the end of the \"visible line\". It also works in text boxes in the browser (like the one you use to create a question or answer here), but unfortunately not in \"normal web pages\".\n\nA: Actually you can.

This is on a Macbook Pro with a 250 GB disk that was originally split into two partitions, roughly 90 (Macintosh HD) and 160 GB (disk2). The machine is now on Catalina with the first partition being APFS and the second staying HFS. There is not enough space on the first partition and I am trying to add more space from the second to the first by following this guide:\nhttps://www.macobserver.com/tips/deep-dive/resize-your-apfs-container/\nAfter splitting the second partition into 2 with Disk Utility, I have an empty partition of 20GB that I convert to empty space by doing\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume \"Free Space\" %noformat% /dev/disk0sX\n\nas shown in the guide (on my system X is 5, not 3 as in the guide but this should not make any difference).

The only thing that I noticed is that the high-level folders in disk2 are owned by root after copying them back, but that doesn't seem to be an issue.\nAs always, make sure that you have reliable backup of your system before doing this\n\nA: If you shrunk the second (visible) partition to create free space. The free space is directly below this partition. You can not add this space to the APFS container, because the free space is not adjacent to the APFS container. In other words, the partition with the HFS volume is between the APFS container and the free space. This prevents adding the free space to the APFS container.\nOne possible solution would be the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move all the files from the HFS volume to an external drive.\n\n*Convert the partition containing the HFS volume to free space.\n\n*Add all the free space to the APFS container.\n\n*Shrink the APFS container and add a new HFS volume.\n\n*Move the files from the external drive to the HFS volume.\n\n\nAnother possibly better solution would be to replace partition with the HFS volume with a new APFS volume inside the existing APFS container. The steps are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move all the files from the HFS volume to an external drive.\n\n*Convert the partition containing the HFS volume to free space.\n\n*Add all the free space to the APFS container.\n\n*Add a new APFS volume to the APFS container.\n\n*Move the files from the external drive to the new APFS volume.\n\n\nThe external drive would not have to be a HDD or SSD.

Player plugin in Safari on macOS? The issue is when I'm watching any video that uses flash player, it is showing abnormal behaviour.\nAny ideas on how to check whether or not Safari is using Flash Player?\nIf not, then how to enable Flash Player plugin in Safari?\n\nA: I'd start by uninstalling Flash completely - very few web sites use it any more. If you don't have it you will see a clear indication if it's required.\nGet the uninstaller from Adobe - Uninstall Flash Player | Mac OS\nWarning: Do not fall for any pop up telling you Flash is needed or out of date - they're scams, malware. If Flash is legitimately needed for a video, the placeholder for the video will say that Flash is required; usually quite simply, \"plugin missing\" or similar, possibly with a 'jigsaw puzzle piece' icon.\nIt will not offer to go get it for you.\nIf you ascertain Flash is actually required, make sure to fetch it directly from Adobe, don't click through any links you cannot see clearly.\nhttps://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\nThen to make sure it's enabled in Safari, go to Preferences > Websites. Scroll down the list on the left until you find Adobe Flash; select, then to the right, decide whether you want behaviour on, off or ask by default & for any specific sites. \nFull instructions at Adobe: Enable for Safari\nNote that Flash is very nearly end-of-life & most browsers are going to start actively blocking it over the next year. If you're not certain whether you currently still need it, work without it.\n\nA: First, install FlashPlayer from the official site of Adobe. \n\nOnce you have the tool install, \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Safari, and choose Safari > Preferences.\n\n*Click the Websites tab and scroll down to the Plug-ins section. Locate the Adobe Flash Player entry.\n\n*Click the checkbox to enable Flash Player.\n\n*Select a setting to use for Flash Player when you visit other websites.\n\n\n*You can configure Flash for individual websites (domains). Select a website listed in this window, and choose to Ask, Off, or On.\nNote: Site will appear once you try to browse it in Safari and then you can put Always ON as per your preferences.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Download the video and see if it is behaving the same. \n\n*Otherwise switch browsers at least. Safari doesn't support say webm and there could be other formats too. \n\n*If the website has really old infrastructure, still there is another alternative to Flash Player. Develop menu → User Agent. It helps me use some sites which require say internet explorer. \n\n*Flash player, if supported in Catalina, would appear in Safari Preferences → Websites, in the sidebar. Also, you can see a separate entry for it in macOS Preferences. \n", "Q: Is it possible to set an individual sound volume for each program on a Mac? I would like to be able to lower the volume of certain software without lowering the overall volume, I know that we can do this very easily on a PC, but on my Macbook Pro (2012) (Catalina) I can't do it.\nwould there be a possibility to do this on Mac ?\n\nA: This is not functionality built into macOS. Windows audio was miles behind Mac for many years, but they got this ability natively first. There are only two apps I know can do this, both by the same company, Rogue Amoeba.\nThe cheaper & simpler one is SoundSource - $35. There is a more complex/expensive one which can also record any sound source to disk as well, called Audio Hijack - $70.\nSoundSource can do all you asked & more.\n\nA: I finally find a way to do it for free with the app Background Music:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically pause/unpause your music player when other audio sources are playing/stopped\n\n*Per-application volume control\n\n*Record system audio\n\n*No restart required to install\n\n\n", "Q: Does macOS need antivirus protection? Are Mac systems immune to viruses and malware?\nDo I need to install software to protect macOS just like we do for Windows?\n\nA: Most, but not all, Mac virus protection is there to stop Windows viruses being spread further.\nThat doesn't mean Macs are immune - there are viruses/trojans/malware targeted specifically at Mac users.\nShlayer is a recent example, but not the ony one - check the table on the linked page.\nThere are also fly-by attacks & social engineering/phishing attacks that you always need to be aware of. Shlayer's attack vector is usually a simple \"Your Flash Player is out of date! Click to update.\" Click to download, click to install & you just invited it in.\nAfter comments…\nThere is no single authority on which antivirus is best, but there are sites which test [for a fee] various competitors in this field. If you just Google it yourself, you will get a thousand hits pretending to be advice, but actually just sock-puppets selling their own 'solution' with no authority but their own.   \nThe only authority I know to be 'trusted' is AV-TEST who keep tables of current antivirus products by OS, for business & home users. The most current Mac page is always at https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-macos/.\n", "Q: Why can I not have the date and time in one cell I want to start at a date and at 12:00:00 am and I want each cell to increase by 1 hour. I put =a2+time(1,0,0) but I keep getting \"The formula’s arguments can only include one date value.\" What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different. To get both date and time in a column, click on the column you wany this in, as in A or B or... After that make sure the Format button in top right of the sheet is selected. Then go to the sidebar on the right and select CELL. Near the top of the sidebar is a pull-down under the label Data Format.  Select Date and Time from the pulldown menu. Once you've selected this a date and time appear in a single cell. See figure below from numbers. I entered the date as 2/5/20 1pm and i got the number displayed in the image.\n\nTo change the value in the next cell add 1. This changes the day by 1, + 365 changes the year by 1. Fractions change the time. The value 0.000012 will change the time by 1 sec. And 60 times that, or 0.000694, changes the time by 1 minute.\n\nA: You don't need a formula to display a date and a time together in Numbers but a formula would make life easier if you also wanted to have a list of cells with incrementally increased times on an hourly basis. \nFirst, select (click on) the cell where your initial date is. Then, select the \"Format\" icon on the Numbers toolbar at the top and then select the \"Cell\" tab. In the Cell tab, choose \"Date & Time\" as the Data Format and then choose one of the Date format options in addition to one of the Time format options in the separate drop-down menus for Date and Time. The cell you just formatted should appear similar to\n\n5/10/18 12:00 AM\n\nafter these actions.\nIn order to display in another cell the time and date in the cell A2 as increased by one hour, you can use the following formula which utilizes the hour specification allowed in formulas. If the cell A2 has the starting date and time, put down the formula\n\n= a2 + \"1h\"\n\n, for example, into the cell right below (the cell A3) to get a date and time one hour later than the one in the cell a2. Assuming the cell A2 has the date and the time I used as an example previously, the cell A3 would appear similar to\n\n5/10/18 1:00 AM\n\nafter entering the formula and pressing return.\nYou can have the further incrementally increased hours as a list of dates & times if you copy and paste the formula in A3 to the cells below it.\n", "Q: How to conveniently restart pgAdmin 4? I have pgAdmin on my dock, and can open it when the process isn't already running (ie. after a restart, or if I manually kill it).\nIf I open pgAdmin, close the window, then later try to open it from the dock, the app doesn't respond.\nThis dock behavior is similar to MySQL Workbench, except that MySQL has the \"running process indicator\" (little circle on dock below the icon), while pgAdmin does not, which means that right clicking on the pgAdmin icon does not give me the option to quit.\nI tried using a bash function, which for MySQL would look like this:\nkillall MySQLWorkbench && open /Applications/MySQLWorkbench.app\n\nThis works fine for MySQL Workbench, but isn't necessary since I can restart it from the dock.\nFor some reason, with pgAdmin, the process doesn't get killed, so the app never opens:\n>> killall pgAdmin\\ 4\nNo matching processes were found\n\nThe app is clearly visible in Activity Monitor with the name pgAdmin 4\nThe only solution I have currently is to manually kill the process from Activity Monitor, but this is quite redundant.\n\nHow can I conveniently restart pgAdmin 4?\n\nI would prefer a solution that allows me to restart it from the dock, but a bash script would also suffice.\nSoftware:\n\n\n*\n\n*pgAdmin 4 : 4.17\n\n*macOS Catalina : 10.15\n\nA: pgAdmin 4 (/Applications/PostgreSQL 12/pgAdmin 4.app) is a simple launcher for /Library/PostgreSQL/12/pgAdmin 4.app which itself is some kind of a service wrapper.\nBesides launching a small web server, it also starts the menulet \"pgAdmin 4\" (the black elephant) and probably does some other things too.\nThe recommended way to restart pgAdmin 4 is to quit the menulet pgAdmin 4 (\"Shut down server\") and launch pgAdmin 4 again from the Dock.\nIf you insist to use the shell or a shell script, the best you can get is probably something like:\nkill -s TERM $(ps aux | grep '[p]gAdmin4' | awk '{print $2 }') && open -a \"pgAdmin 4\"\n\nYou have to clean up (i.e. close) the now defunct browser window of the previous session manually.\n\nIf you just want to re-visit the pgAdmin PostgreSQL management page (after accidentally exiting the browser or closing the browser window/tab or if you want to use another browser) you don't have to quit and relaunch pgAdmin.\nThe formerly displayed url (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:49211/browser/) won't work anymore but a file in your home folder contains a working url with an auth key:\ncat ~/.pgA*.addr\nhttp://127.0.0.1:49211/?key=c1b4f6c8-fa99-4af2-9ebd-06d71586c266 #example\n\nEnter this url in your browser and you can visit the page without authorization error .\nIn the shell this is: open $(cat .pgA*.addr). This will launch your standard web browser and open the management page.\n", "Q: No package manager on brand new macOS Catalina I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but I've been searching for days with no results.\nWhat is the default package manager for macOS Catalina terminal? \n% brew\nzsh: command not found: brew\n\nI've tried others (apt, apt-get, yum, etc.) but none of them are pre-installed. Any help is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: The only package manager that’s somewhat default is /usr/bin/easy_install  for python.

I have an iPad 7th gen 10.2\" and I've been looking for apple smart keyboards for a few days now. I came across one on ebay which was cheaper than usual but the thing is, it says that it's for the iPad 10.5\".\nHow can I know if this works only in a 10.5\" air or pro model, or it doesn't really matter?\n\nA: In general, no. The contacts and physical size of keyboards make it very unlikely you can swap parts. Make sure the return policy is good or use the Apple Store app on your iPad and link your device so it shows which parts are compatible with your device. \n\n", "Q: How can I swap the Cmd + Option keys on my external keyboard when using Ulysses for iPad? I have an external Bluetooth keyboard, the Filco Majestouch MINILA Air.\nI'd like to use it to write documents in Ulysses on my iPad Pro, but it's confusing because the Option and Cmd keys are in the wrong position. They need to be swapped.\nI haven't been able to find a global iPad setting which can do this even though there does seem to be a lot of options for accessibility.\nThe keyboard has dipswitches for swapping all sorts of things, but they didn't include one for this pretty obvious need!\nThe app I use for ssh, Blink, allows for remapping of all the special keys, but I couldn't find anything in Ulysses for this.\ntl;dr is there a way to swap Cmd and Option on iPadOS generally or even just in Ulysses?\n\nA: Searched around on this because I was looking at a keyboard where this was the main flaw and came across your question.

Screenshot is where I keyed in 4 * 3 and an Enter, I get output of 3 instead of 12 and neither can I read what I keyed in nor scroll arrow-up for any previous result.  I thought I had some sort of mental blockage so I actually read the Calculator User Guide for Mac - still didn't find what I did wrong with the Calculator. I regret upgrading to Catalina, everything is just a disaster. I have to use Terminal for basic calculation, if someone can show me how to use Calculator like we used to on the Dashboard or on normal physical calculator... \n\n \n\nA: RPN Mode\nThe problem most probably stems from the calculator being in the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) mode. Things should go back to normal if you simply turn the RPN mode off by pressing ⌘+R.\n", "Q: Password for locking Noted When I try to lock’Notes’ it says ‘wrong password’, although my password unlocks normally. How can I update the password. \n\nA: If you know your old password, then it is quite straight forward to change your password. \nIn addition, you can reset your password, but this won’t give you access to your old notes. It will, however, let you password protect any notes that you create from that point forward with the new password. This could lead to you having multiple notes with different passwords.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iOS device, tap Settings\n\n\n\n*Tap Notes\n \n\n*Tap Password\n\n\n*You will see a Changed Password option.

It's very annoying and I don't know how to stop it. Viber is probably the worst, updates without permission and I have no idea how to stop it from opening their website.\nIs it possible to block apps from opening Chrome/Safari or whatever my browser is?\n\nA: For Google Chrome:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Google Chrome.\n\n*With Finder selected, hit the Shift-⌘-G and enter the folder address\n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome.\n\n*Select the Default folder, and open the Preferences file in a text editor like Text Editor.\n\n*Search for the phrase “excluded_schemes,” which houses your list of protocol handler preferences in the text file.\n\n*Search for the offending protocol (like “itmss” for iTunes, or “slack” for Slack) and change its state from “true” to “false,” taking care not to remove any punctuation.\n\n*Save the file, and re-open Chrome.\n\n\nFor Safari:\n\n\n*\n\n*I recommend for a tool NoMoreiTunes, a free Safari extension that stops iTunes or the App Store app from launching automatically when you visit a store page online.\n\n*To use the NoMoreiTunes extension, simply head over to the extension’s website and download the latest version. \n\n*Once downloaded, double-click on the extension file and Safari will detect and install it (you’ll need to verify the installation by telling Safari that you “trust” the extension).\n\n*With NoMoreiTunes installed, any time you navigate to an iTunes or App Store page in Safari, you’ll see a notification bar at the top of the window letting you know that the extension prevented the iTunes or App Store apps from launching.

I have burned the image to a DVD and successfully installed El Capitan in the past. Now that my DVD drive is broken, I would like to create a bootable USB Drive out of it. Can this be achieved? If yes, I'd like to know how.\n\nA: All I did was wrote the image to USB Drive with dd command from the terminal and it booted like a charm.

However I live in Europe with 50Hz mains frequency. When I am filming old CRTs, I get a bunch of flicker either way. It would be optimal to record at 50 FPS. Is there a way to enforce this? Maybe a 3rd party app? I haven't found  one yet.\n\nA: Without 3rd party apps: No, iOS doesn't allow you to choose the fps.\nYet, there are 3rd party apps that can give you much more control over photo and video settings.

Sudo merely removes protective restrictions, putting the burden of running safe code on you, rather than protecting you behind the scenes. Sudo can be dangerous when, for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*You make a coding mistake which has unintended consequences: e.g., if you intend to run:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm -Rf /Users/yourname/something/something/\nbut instead you type: \n\n*sudo rm -Rf /Users/yourname/ something/something/ \n(with an accidental space after 'yourname') \nthe second script (with the erroneous space) will delete all of the data for user 'yourname' without warning.\n\n*You run someone else's code which happens to be malicious. Malicious code run without sudo can do some damage, but malicious code run with sudo can compromise your system entirely.\n\n\nAs long as you're careful, sudo is safe enough. Just be aware of the potentials for harm.\n\nA: sudo Being Dangerous\nThere are no dangerous commands, per se.  It's what you do with them that can cause problems.  For instance, the harmless command yes which will output a string repeatedly until you kill it, can be used nefariously to bring a machine to a crawl:\necho \"Spawning 1000 yesses\"\nfor i in {1..1000} ;\ndo\n  ( /usr/bin/yes & )\n; done\n\nNothing in there is dangerous.  It's how it's used that causes the problem.\nsudo doesn't give or remove permissions/restrictions on your account.  It allows you to run a command as another user.  This is usually the super user (aka root), thus the command - su \"do\" (su = Substitute User Identity)\nThe key to remember is that when you issue a command prefixed with sudo you are running it as root and not as \"you.\"\nFixing your Script\nHere are some tips...\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the script itself (not the individual commands) with sudo.  \n\n*Before running the \"meat\" of the script, check for root privileges, first:\n# Validates that user is root; exits if not\necho \"Checking Root Priviliges\"\nif [ $(id -u) -ne 0 ]\nthen \n  echo \"User is not root\"\n  exit 1;\nelse \n  echo \"User is root.  Continuing\";\nfi\n\n\n*Don't use tilde (~) expansion for your path.  Use the whole path instead.  This will ensure you're affecting the directory you want to affect.  The home directory for you is very different from the root home directory.\nrm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*                  ← Don't do this!!!\nrm -rf /Users/FooBarUser/Library/Caches/*  ← Do this instead!\n\n\n*If you plan on automating this (it sounds like you do), you'll need to save it as a script (bash or zsh) and then I suggest using launchd and not Automator for this.  See the post launchd plist format for running a command at a specific time on a weekday for details on how to accomplish this.\n", "Q: Can a website access Apple Health data? Apps on the phone can.

Permissions for the disk and file & folders were set (but rather unclear to me).\nThe basic problem/bug could't be found, because time was short (and I was lazy).\n\nMy proposal was: building everything from scratch\n\n\n*\n\n*Add an admin to each sharing group (if not done already)\n\n*Disable sharing for the drive (or the shared folders)\n\n*Copy all shared folders to a second external drive, remove all ACLs and use (sudo) chown ... -R ... to reset all major folders and their content to adminuser:admin\n\n*Format the external drive to JHFS+\n\n*Create as adminuser a main folder Shared on the drive: \nmkdir /Volumes/ExternalDrive/Shared\nls -ale /Volumes/ExternalDrive/Shared\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 adminuser  admin   68 Feb 11 18:55 .\ndrwxrwxr-x  10 root       admin  408 Feb 11 18:55 ..\n\n\n*Copy all major subfolders back to /Volumes/ExternalDrive/Shared\nExample/Result:\nls -ale /Volumes/ExternalDrive/Shared    \ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 adminuser  admin  136 Feb 11 19:10 .\ndrwxrwxr-x  10 root       admin  408 Feb 11 18:55 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 adminuser  admin   68 Feb 11 19:10 develop\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 adminuser  admin   68 Feb 11 19:10 finance\n\n\n*Apply chmod 750 to the main subfolders:\nchmod 750 /Volumes/ExternalDrive/Shared/develop\nchmod 750 /Volumes/ExternalDrive/Shared/finance\n\n\n*Apply group ACLs (I named the dev group develop and the fin group finance - like the folders)\nExamples (the example ACL allows full access to all sub-subfolders - every user of the respective group can really do anything, so be aware/fine tune it):\nchmod -R +a \"group:develop allow readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,list,search,add_file,add_subdirectory,delete_child,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" /Volumes/ExternalDrive/Shared/develop\nchmod -R +a \"group:finance allow readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,list,search,add_file,add_subdirectory,delete_child,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" /Volumes/ExternalDrive/Shared/finance\n\nResult:\nls -ale /Volumes/ExternalDrive/Shared\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 adminuser  admin  136 Feb 11 19:10 .\ndrwxrwxr-x  10 root       admin  408 Feb 11 18:55 ..\ndrwxr-x---+  2 adminuser  admin   68 Feb 11 19:10 develop\n 0: group:develop allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\ndrwxr-x---+  2 adminuser  admin   68 Feb 11 19:10 finance\n 0: group:finance allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\n\n\n*Enable (AFP) sharing for the Shared folder or share each main subfolder (i.e. develop, finance etc.)\nIn the first case all users can access the Shared but have no or restricted access to subfolders. Example (member of the develop group opens the share - other groups' members have no access at all, except if a user is member of several groups and develop is one of it)\n\nIn the second case (e.g. sharing develop and logging in as member of the develop group)\n \n\n*If you need to have personalized sub-subfolders (access for one user of the group only), you have to stop the \"global\" group ACL and add a new user ACL.\n\n\n\nAFP-Sharing worked again afterwards.\n", "Q: How to use my iMac 2017 as a second monitor for my MacBook Pro mid 2012?

Wi-Fi is the first in the Service Order in Network Preferences. There are some hostnames in the wired LAN that don't exist on the Wi-Fi.\nHow can I make it so that hostnames which don't exist on the Wi-Fi network, are \"looked up\" in the wired LAN network?\n\nI am connected to a Wi-Fi network (which has an internet connection), and I am using a USB Ethernet adapter to connect to a second LAN (from which I can't figure out how to access the internet).\nI changed my System Preferences > Network ordering so that the Wi-Fi takes precedence over the wired LAN. If I don't do this, then it seems I can't access the internet.\nTrying to access the internet with the Service Order the other way round looks like this:\n$ ping google.com\nPING google.com (172.217.169.78): 56 data bytes\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 0\n36 bytes from vlan...(lots of stuff, not sure how sensitive).myuni.co.uk (129.??.??.?): Communication prohibited by filter\nVr HL TOS  Len   ID Flg  off TTL Pro  cks      Src      Dst\n 4  5  00 5400 58db   0 0000  3d  01 a4f5 192.168.??.??  172.217.169.78 \n\n16 bytes from ....myuni.co.uk (192.168.???.???): Router Advertisement\n\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 1\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 2\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 3\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 4\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 5\n36 bytes from vlan.....myuni.co.uk (129.???.??.??): Communication prohibited by filter\nVr HL TOS  Len   ID Flg  off TTL Pro  cks      Src      Dst\n 4  5  00 5400 6cc8   0 0000  3d  01 9108 192.168.??.???  172.217.169.78 \n\nI've never seen this kind of ping response before and don't know what it means. It was easy enough for me to infer however that it's going to be more difficult for me to access the internet through the wired LAN.\nSo I rearranged the Service Order and put wifi first. Now my internet access works as usual.\nHowever, that means that the custom hostnames from the wired LAN aren't available:\n$ ping customhostname\nping: cannot resolve customhostname: Unknown host\n\nIf I turn Wi-Fi off then it works:\n$ ping customhostname\nPING customhostname.myuni.co.uk (192.168.100.200): 56 data bytes\n\nAdditionally, I can leave Wi-Fi turned on and still access that computer via the IP:\n$ ping customhostname\nping: cannot resolve customhostname: Unknown host\n$ ping 192.168.100.200\nPING 192.168.100.200 (192.168.100.200): 56 data bytes\n\nBut how can I make it so that hostnames which aren't recognised (in this case, customhostname) by the Wi-Fi interface, are \"looked up\" in the wired LAN interface?\nI don't want to have to memorise the IP address, and manually update my own records whenever it changes.\n\nA: To solve your problem you need to install a local DNS server. \nThe DNS server should then simply be setup to use your current DNS server for all lookups, except those that belong to the \"custom hostnames\" (*.myuni.co.uk for example) that you want to force to be looked up via the alternative DNS server.\nFor example here's the way to set it up with the the very popular \"bind\" DNS-server software:\nYou install \"bind\" by using HomeBrew. If you have HomeBrew installed already, you can open the Terminal and use this command to install it:\nbrew install bind\n\nTo configure bind, you need to edit the named.conf configuration file. First you need to define your local IPs (your own computers). This ensures that only you can do DNS lookups using your computer:\n  acl mycomputers {\n    localhost;\n    localnets;\n  }\n\nThis is a simple configuration that just allows your own computer to do lookups. If you have other devices that you want to use this computer for DNS as well, you can add their IPs or a whole subnet to the list as well.\nThen in the existing \"options\" block, you make it look like this:\noptions {\n  [...]\n  recursion yes;\n  allow-query { mycomputers };\n  zone \"myuni.co.uk\" in { type forward; forward only; forwarders { 1.1.1.1; 2.2.2.2; }; };\n  forwarders {\n      8.8.8.8;\n      8.8.4.4;\n  }\n\n}\n\nRecursion means that you allow clients to lookup \"other people's domains\" - i.e. not just host names and IP addresses defined on your computer, but by looking other domain names up on the internet.\nAllow-query restricts access to only your own computers.\nThe zone line means that the specific domain myuni.co.uk is going to be handled by a specific set of DNS-servers. I.e. all queries for *.myuni.co.uk is forwarded to these servers. You need to replace 1.1.1.1/2.2.2.2 with the IP addresses of your Uni's DNS servers.\nThe next line \"forwarders\" means that all other queries are forwarded to other DNS servers. In this case I just put in the IP addresses for Google's DNS service, but you can your existing DNS server IPs here.\nNote that \"bind\" does come with lots of options and configuration possibilities - it might be a bit hard to grasp at first.\nAnother option would be install the more limited, but easier to setup \"dnsmasq\" software. It is also available from HomeBrew with brew install dnsmasq.\nWith dnsmasq you can essentially keep defaults to use your ordinary DNS servers, and then use the following option:\n--server=/myuni.co.uk/1.1.1.1\n\nto forward queries for *.myuni.co.uk to your Uni's DNS server (replace that IP for 1.1.1.1).\nNote that dnsmasq also does other things than just DNS - like for example being a DHCP server. This functionality you do not want, so keep it disabled.\n\nA: What you have is something called a multihomed network where you have more than one network attached to your computer.  For this particular question, we're assuming that it's two different networks with different IP addressing schemes.\nYour service order doesn't really matter in this case.  Your computer knows that it can get to the 192.168.100.0 network via your Ethernet.  It knows it can get to the other network (you didn't say) and the Internet via WiFi.\nThe reason you can't find the hostname you're looking for when WiFi is active is because DNS for WiFi takes priority and it knows nothing about the Ethernet side of things.\nHow do you solve this?\n\n\n*\n\n*Your DNS server(s) must also be multihomed and \"see\" the other network\n\n*You have to manually add these hosts to your /etc/hosts file so your computer can manually look up the address.\n\n", "Q: App Store Promo Codes - What happens if used after a new version is released App Store Promo Codes - What happens if one is used after a new version is released? \nFor example, if I give out promo codes for app version 1.4.

However, every other source I check says they still have the butterfly keyboards until mid-2020.\nCan I get a definitive answer about whether a new MacBook purchase in the US would have the previous butterfly style keyboard or the newly planned scissor-switch keyboard?\n\n\nA: The 2019 MacBook Air uses the third-generation Butterfly keyboard.\nThis is also clearly stated on Apple's marketing page for the 2019 MacBook Air: \n\n\"The latest-generation MacBook Air keyboard features our butterfly mechanism [...]\"\n\nThe new scissor-switch style keyboard debuted on the 16\" MacBook Pro, which was released in November of 2019. The 2019 MacBook Air is from July of 2019.\nIt doesn't matter which country you buy your MacBook Air in. Different countries obviously have different keyboard in terms of number of keys and the letters on them - but they're all made in the same way. I.e. a Mid 2019 MacBook Air is going to have the same style of keyboard in every country.\nThere's no such thing as a \"Mid 2020 MacBook Air\" (yet). You can only speculate whether it will have a scissor-switch key, or the butterfly keyboard.

When the handler is called, if the file path is valid, it should return an AppleScript list that contains the page label of every page, ordered by page index.  However, bear in mind that PDF pages are indexed from zero, while AppleScript lists are indexed from one.

There are guidelines that Apple lays out for developers to follow, and thankfully, most are conscientious and make sure their software reports information about the main UI elements, which, at a minimum, is meant to include the elements' name, description, object class, its purpose (or role), its position in the hierarchy, and a few other basic bits.\nBesides being nice for those who script the UI to death, they actually serve a greater purpose, in aiding users with special needs to be able to interface with software that they otherwise wouldn't be able to use (for example, a blind person cannot see the value displayed for a page index, but voice over software would use accessibility hooks to retrieve the information and read it aloud to the user...provided the information has been exposed).\nIt appears Skim developers are just lazy or don't wish blind people to be using their software.\n\n\nI've found out that the text field can be accessed with:\n\n\n\ntext field \"Page\" of group 2 of toolbar 1 of window \"程元敏 - 2013 - 尚書學史.pdf (page 1150 of 1696)\" of application process \"Skim\" of application \"System Events\"\n\n\n\n\nHence, the following attempt to get its value:\n\n\n\ntell application \"Skim\"\n    activate\n    set theDoc to front document\n    get value of text field \"Page\" of group 2 of toolbar 1 of theDoc\nend tell\n\n\n\n\nThe above script resulted in this syntax error:\n\n\n\nExpected end of line, etc. but found “\"”\n\n\nThe information you gleaned from the first snippet are class objects that all belong to the application System Events.  So when you then try to get application Skim to reference these objects, it can't: it's never heard of a text field.  It does, however, recognise text as the name of a class object (the class of all AppleScript strings), and then tentatively assumes that field is an identifier for a variable that it will need to look up and read the value from.  That's where it would ordinarily then complain that you never declared a variable with that identifier, but the word \"Page\" that immediately follows is a bigger concern, as this makes no sense to it in any context.\nThat's when the compiler categorises this as being a syntax error, reports the double quote as the definitively-illegal character that makes the entire expression impossible to evaluate.\nThat said, even if it wasn't a syntactical error, it would have led to a runtime error because your reference stops at toolbar 1, having completely omitted the parent object of toolbar 1, which is window \"程元敏 - 2013 - 尚書學史.pdf (page 1150 of 1696)\" (which you could also refer to as window 1 for convenience), and its parent object, which is process \"Skim\", and its parent object, which is application \"System Events\".\nWhat you needed to do is to take the snippet you were given, and use that with one tiny adjustment: the topmost object--which is the one at the end of the reference--is always going to be an application object, which in this case is \"System Events\".  This is the object that owns all of the other objects that the reference contains, and is therefore the thing you need to be tell-ing:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    value of text field \"Page\" of ¬\n        group 2 of toolbar 1 of ¬\n        window 1 of process \"Skim\"\nend tell\n\nHowever, do not--as you have done--put your tell application \"System Events\" block inside a tell application \"Skim\" block.  Although you don't see it, AppleScript bitches about this, generates an error (quietly), figures out what you do mean, then thankfully gets on with it.  But it slows things down, which is the best case scenario, but in other situations, it can cause overlapping object classes or terminology to clash.  If you're lucky, it'll just cause the script to terminate in a runtime error.  If you're unlucky, things get overwritten and data gets lost.\nUnless there's a specific reason to, and you know precisely what you're doing when doing it, don't ever put one application tell block (or clause) inside another.  Generally speaking, since most languages only carry out one operation at a time anyway (this isn't true, but pretend it is, because it is for AppleScript), you will only ever be getting AppleScript to talk to one application at any particularly point in your script, so try and make sure that this is the case when you review what you've written.\n\nA: Here's my final code that worked: \ntell application \"Skim\"\n    activate\n    set theDoc to front document\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Skim\"\n        set metaPage to (get value of text field \"Page\" of group 2 of toolbar 1 of window 1)\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nHope some of you could answer my other questions indicated above. \n\nTaking the advice from @CJK's answer above, I have amended my code as follows: \ntell application \"Skim\"\n    activate\n    set theDoc to front document\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Skim\"\n     set metaPage to (get value of text field \"Page\" of group 2 of toolbar 1 of window 1)\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Unable to start firefox profile manager on MacOS I am trying to start the profile manager for Firefox running the following command in a terminal:\n/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin --ProfileManager\n\nBut this opens just Firefox.

How can I check that all the parts in a Mac mini late 2014 are genuine or not?\nI have found that we can change the About this Mac details from system.\nHow can I know that Details shown in About this Mac is right and not a cheat?\n\nA: There is only four components that can be interchanged in the 2014 Mac mini:\n\n\n*\n\n*AirPort card\n\n*PCIe SSD\n\n*5400 RPM Hard Disk Drive\n\n*CPU Fan\n\n\nOther than those four items (maybe the modular power supply, but it’s proprietary to Apple) everything is physically integrated into the logic board.\nOf the four items I listed, none are “genuine” Apple to begin with\n\n\n*\n\n*AirPort card is a PCIe, Broadcom network adapter made for Apple.  Technically, you could use a different PCIe adapter, but why?  Apple always put the latest 802.1x product available at the time.  They are “too inexpensive” to swap with another.\n\n*The SSD is a Samsung with a proprietary PCIe Interface.  There are adapters out there to interface standard PCIe SSDs with Apple’s interface, but again why?  This is a Fusion Drive setup and it’s much easier to upgrade the spinning drive which....\n\n*The Hard Disk is an OEM from Seagate.  It’s very common to change this out, even for another SSD.  So, if it's not the original, there's really no harm/no foul here.\n\n*The fan is a standard fan that you would find in any off the shelf laptop, albeit, it’s one of the higher quality ones.  However, it makes no sense to to not use Apple OEM, because these are so inexpensive.  It would cost more (much, much, more) in time and labor to change out with a lessor model than the profit you'd make doing so.\n\n\nModifying System Report. \nCan you modify the System Report?  Technically yes, you can.  \nFor instance, by editing ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SystemProfiler.plist with a utility like TextWrangler, I can change the \"About This Mac\" model info.\nBut again why? Of the components I listed, none are genuine Apple and the fan doesn’t even report.  If the memory was user serviceable like previous models, you could add any compatible 3rd party memory.  The memory today, like back then isn’t made by Apple so System Report info here would be moot.  \nAs for the Model or even the CPU info, that info can be easily cross checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU Info can be obtained using sysctl.  See this answer for more details.  \n\n*Cross reference your model with a SN# lookup:\n\n\n*\n\n*via Apple Check Coverage Site\n\n*via EveryMac.com\nKeep in mind that the SN# is printed on the back or bottom of Mac products.  Even if \"About this Mac\" information were to be spoofed, it's very easy to use another avenue to verify what you have.\n\nA: It's not possible for someone to make the Mac show different information in About This Mac or System Information from the actual data that the OS reports. \nOf course, if you're looking at a photo/screenshot, it could have been digitally altered, or it could be from another computer.\nHowever, a 2014 Mini does not really have many interchangeable parts that could be swapped for \"non-genuine\" (i.e. not-Apple OEM) parts. The RAM is soldered to the logic board, for starters.\nIf you are buying something on eBay or similar, then usually you can return it if it does not meet the agreed specification, and get a refund.\n", "Q: Hotkey for automator service without giving permissions to all applications I have created an automator workflow; then I have created a keyboard shortcut in the Keyboard Settings to run this as a Quick Action on a keypress.\nAll of this works. But the workflow seems to run in the security context of the application which was active when I pressed the hotkey. \nThe activity inside the service has nothing to do with the current application (it takes a screenshot and then does something with it); it doesn't access the \"current\" application in any way.\nIt needs to access the System Events, and thus security kicks in. I then have to enable access to those features for any application which happened to be in the foreground when I hit the hotkey.\nIs it possible to avoid this - i.e. run my service in a context of its own?    \nEDIT for clarification: The workflow clicks menus of applications, and sends keystrokes.\n... take a screenshot ...\n... startup GIMP ...\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"GIMP-2.10\"\n\n...\n        click menu item \"From Clipboard\" of menu 1 of menu item \"Create\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"File\" of menu bar 1\n\n...\n        keystroke \" \"\n...\n\nAs an example, say I press the hotkey while Emacs is in front. I then get a security prompt asking me to allow some security aspects for Emacs. I neither want do give Emacs any permissions, nor do I want to repeat this for any other application which might be in focus when I take a screenshot later. \n\nA: I had the same issue. What worked for me: \n1: Saving the automator workflow as an application (File > Convert To > Application. Save > File Format = Application). \n2: Then creating a separate Automator Quick Action with the sole purpose of launching the application created in 1 (File > New > Quick Action. Save normally as a workflow.). \nThe application containing the target workflow (1) will then need to be given Accessibility permissions via the usual (Security and Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility) and the key shortcut should be bound to the workflow (2) as you described. \nThis successfully bypasses the security settings of the currently active application by running the workflow in a self-contained app (with its own Accessibility preferences) negating the need for multiple permissions. \n", "Q: macOS Catalina Homebrew mariadb Installation Issues Edit 2020-10-12:\nI'm on macOS 10.15.7, the versions in brew formulas is 10.5.6 for mariadb and 8.0.21 for mysql.

What does this accomplish? \nI then have to reformat the internal drive as APFS, will this somehow be more possible once I have rebooted from the external (yet cloned internal) drive?\nWhy is it more possible to format the internal drive as APFS once it is cloned to an external drive? And, when they say \"reformat the internal drive as APFS\", do they mean the clone of the internal drive that now resides on the external drive, or the actual internal drive that was left behind when the original internal was sent to the external?\n\nA: \nWhy do I have to clone the internal drive to an external drive and then reboot from the external drive? What does this accomplish? \n\nTechnically, it allows you to re-partition and format your internal drive as APFS because you can't be mounted to the drive/partition you want to modify.  Booting from the external drive allows you to modify the internal drive.\nRealistically speaking this is not necessary because...\n\n\n*\n\n*The install of Mojave/Catalina will auto convert your SSD from JHFS+ to APFS \"on the fly\" during the install process\n\n*You can accomplish the exact same thing by simply booting from Recovery ⌘ CommandR or the USB installer of Mojave/Catalina (I prefer this method).\nIn terms of backing up your drive, having a clone of your drive isn't a bad thing, but Time Machine will get the job done better.\nAs a side note... you don't need SuperDuper or CCC (Carbon Copy Cloner). You can use the built in command dd\n$ dd if=diskX of=diskY bs=1M\n\nWhere diskX = your source (internal) disk and diskY = the target (external) disk.

Here is a screenshot of what I get :\n\n\nA: First, have you force quit the camera app and restarted your phone?\nThis could be one of two things both are prompted by the Camera app being unable to start the camera properly.\nThe first is that the physical camera isn't working some or all of the time, depending on the phone model it might be that one of the back cameras works but not the front.

It works perfectly as long as I keep it down but shuts off within a minute or so after I release it. I’ve reset the SMC and NVRAM, to no avail.\nThis is not just a power on/boot issue (Google hits are all about Macs not powering on unless the power key is held down for several seconds, but then stay on).\nI don’t think it’s a software issue, but I installed the 10.15.3 update a few days ago.\nThe only clue I have is a very brief “Do you want to shut down/sleep” dialog that popped up once before the random shutdown but hasn’t since.

This is very similar to the question/answer:  Keyboard key stuck or not being recognized; how to fix  but different in that we're dealing with the power button and not an individual key.\nThe keyboard is connected via USB and the power button functions through the USB as well.  If you disassemble your MBP and remove the top case assembly, you'll find there's only one cable connecting it to the logic board and that cable is a USB cable.\nMore than likely, it's a short and not a dirty contact because the power button isn't a latching switch; it's a momentary switch like your keyboard keys.  If the contact were dirty, you wouldn't be able to turn it on.  In this case, you can turn it on but you have to hold it because there's a short in the circuit somewhere.  How do we know this?\n\nThe only clue I have is a very brief “Do you want to shut down/sleep” dialog that popped up once before the random shutdown but hasn’t since.\n\nThat pop up happens when you press the power button.  Thing is, it's happening too fast and acting like you're holding the power button for the \"5 second power off no matter what.\" \nWe also know it's not a software issue because it happens from a powered off state.

Now I'm back in Disk Utility in order to restore this disk image to the very same source disk it was created from. I thought it would be a simple operation, but I can't seem to wrap my head around it.\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restoring to the drive in Disk Utility and selecting the .dmg as source. I get an error every time: Image needs to be scanned. Will restore as mounted disk image. Operation failed… No definition of \"scanned\" is provided. I have verified the image successfully.\n\n*Mounting the .dmg and restoring using its device as the source. Now I get another error: The operation couldn’t be completed. (OSStatus error 6.) Operation failed… It also mentions that some volumes are not Apple_HFS or Apple_UFS, which seems entirely irrelevant to me since I'm not trying to restore a specific volume.\n\n\nWhat makes me even more confused is when I then read an Apple's support article, which states:\n\nTo restore a disk image with multiple volumes to a disk, you must partition the destination disk, then restore each volume individually\n\nThis makes no sense to me. I'm working under the assumption that a \"disk image\" is, well, a disk image. The partition table — a piece of data that resides on the disk — has to be recreated in order to restore a disk image? That's a contradiction to me. What is going on here?\nAnyway, I tried what the article suggested as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erased the destination device and created a new APFS volume. Selected this empty volume and restored to it from the mounted dmg's APFS volume. It looks like it's working, but I return later to some error \"OSStatus -119930872\". I don't know how to interpret that.\n\n\nAt this point I felt like I've misunderstood something fundamental, so I ask here. \nHow am I supposed to restore a disk image to the very disk it is an image of?

It worked fine, but after using it for a few days, it suddenly froze and crashed. I tried to restart it, got at the login screen but it would just try to sign in and freeze again on a white screen. I also have red horizontal lines in my screen. I have tried going to recovery mode, doing a SMC, doing a NRAM reset, going into safe mode, but nothing seems to work. I also tried the hardware test which told me there was no trouble.

Even trying to use an installer USB get's till the point whether I would like to start from my Macintosh HD or USB, but after loading, it just freezes again.\nI went to a even worse path by resetting the SSD, because I found some posts telling that the SSD might be corrupted. This means I have no backup unfortunately. \nWhat can I do to resolve this issue?\nEDIT:\nThe comments suggested to record it.

My AirPods have been paired to my AppleTV long time ago.  But typically, I use them with my iPhone or iPad.\nEvery once in a while, usually at night, I want to watch a show on AppleTV using my AirPods.  However, the process of having to go deep into AppleTV's menus just to get the AirPods connected is a cumbersome process.\nI asked Siri for help, but she had no idea what I was talking about when I used the Siri Remote to say \"Hey Siri, connect to my AirPods\".  And I did this when the AirPods are in my ear and have already played me the \"I am ON\" DING sound.\nSo, the question becomes:\nCan I use any automated way to get the AirPods to connect to my AppleTV as \"lazily\" as possible?\n\nA: Usually (sometimes I do have to go deep into the menu’s) you should be able to swipe down from the top, using your Apple TV remote (works in most apps - not all), and then select your audio device by selecting the “Audio” tab, going down to “Speaker”, and selecting your Bluetooth device.\nAlternatively, you can hold the “play/pause” button on your remote when in the “TV” or “Menu” views and select the audio output in a pop up menu.\nRelated answer (my own) about how to use AirPods easily with multiple devices.\n", "Q: Using AppleScript to change text color in Keynote I am tired of clicking through the color wheel to get custom colors and I would like to use AppleScript to automate with BTT a simple button to change the selected text color to a set of company standards.

The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: Keynote has scripting support to change the colour (and size and font) of text, so you can make changes without relying upon UI scripting. \nIt uses an RGB model where you provide a 16-bit number for each colour. These values can be derived by multiplying the RGB value by 257. For example, Blueberry has values of {0, 0, 255}; multiply by 257 and you get the {0, 0, 65535} below. Conversely, if you divide each of the 'added text' colours of {25441, 10793, 42404} by 257, you end up with 99/42/165 (or #632AA5).\ntell application \"Keynote\"\n    tell slide 1 of document 1\n        --Title\n        set the color of object text of the default title item to {0, 0, 65535}\n        set the font of object text of the default title item to \"Impact\"\n        set size of the object text of default title item to 54\n\n        --Body\n        set the color of object text of the default body item to {8481, 32896, 16704}\n        set the font of object text of the default body item to \"Impact\"\n        set size of the object text of default body item to 36\n\n        --Added text\n        set color of the object text of text item 3 to {25441, 10793, 42404}\n        set the font of object text of the text item 3 to \"Impact\"\n        set size of the object text of text item 3 to 24\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How can I restore the persistent data for Mac's native Stickies app? I use the native Stickies app a lot. I've been using it on this Mac for like 5 years.\nI don't know why, but when I upgraded to the latest MacOS (to 10.15.2, from whatever was the big release before it), all my sticky notes disappeared. It was like none had ever existed.\nIt appears that data isn't actually lost. The web tells me Stickies stores that data in a file at ~/Library/StickiesDatabase. That file exists, and both TextEdit and bash strings reveal that my note data is in there. It's embedded in an illegible binary file, whose format I know nothing about. I have way too many notes for it to be practical to manually copy-and-paste from that format, and I'm not even sure I can read it properly myself. Maybe if I could read it using bash or node, but I don't know anything about the file format.\nAnyway, for whatever reason, when I run the Stickies app, it doesn't show that data in any of its notes. Simply putting the file in the location expected by the app is not sufficient, evidently. I don't know what is lacking, though.\nI tried Stickies' File > Import Text, but that just loaded the raw binary format for all my old notes into a single new note, instead of really grokking the database and restoring the notes inside. After closing and re-opening Stickies with that one crazy one, all my notes were gone again. (I kept a backup of the original file.)\nIs there any way to restore the data in that file? It's already in the proper location, and I certainly haven't hand edited. Or failing that, are there any good tools for parsing it?\n\nA: \nSearch for Stickies from the uppermost directory of your Mac (by navigating to Finder - Go - Computer or entering ⇧+⌘+C as a keyboard shortcut from Finder) and choose the directory Stickies at the bottom of the list from the screenshot.\n\nIn this directory there are rtfd files, from which you can view possibly all the contents that had been in the Stickies notes even though they have now disappeared when the Stickies App is opened. You can simply double-click them and typically they are opened in Rich Text Format by TextEdit App.\n", "Q: How can I search for meeting invites in Microsoft Outlook for Mac I occasionally want to search through my Outlook inbox for emails containing Outlook calendar meeting invites (and updates).  There is no obvious search option for this, even under the advanced search options.\nI do see that it is possible to set up a rule for new incoming mail (\"Kind\" is \"Meeting Request\"), but that doesn't help me search through existing mail, nor does it help if my intent isn't one of the rule trigger options.  There does not appear to be an analogous \"kind\" option for email search.\nHow can I search through existing mail messages for meeting invites and updates?\n\nA: The \"Raw Query\" search option can be used for this purpose.  Just search use the following raw query:\ncom_microsoft_outlook_has_reminder == 1\n\n\nNote that the \"Raw Query\" option does not appear to be available in New Outlook mode.\nFrom what I have been able to determine, the raw query field uses the Spotlight file metadata query expression syntax.  I haven't found an authoritative source that states this, but various online posts and manual testing confirms this to be the case.\nAs mentioned in this gist, it looks like the list of raw query options can be found in the following file within the Microsoft Outlook app:\n/Applications/Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/Library/Spotlight/Microsoft Outlook Spotlight Importer.mdimporter/Contents/Resources/schema.xml\nBased on the name and list of attributes, it looks like the com.microsoft.outlook15.message type is the one that applies to email messages.\n<type name=\"com.microsoft.outlook15.message\">\n    <allattrs>\n        kMDItemTitle\n        com_microsoft_outlook_recordID\n        kMDItemContentCreationDate\n        com_microsoft_outlook_messageSent\n        com_microsoft_outlook_messageReceived\n        com_microsoft_outlook_priority\n        com_microsoft_outlook_flag\n        com_microsoft_outlook_unread\n        kMDItemContentModificationDate\n        kMDItemCoverage\n        kMDItemKeywords\n        kMDItemProjects\n        com_microsoft_outlook_has_text_content\n        kMDItemTextContent\n        kMDItemAuthors\n        kMDItemRecipients\n        com_microsoft_outlook_folderID\n        com_microsoft_outlook_junkLikelihood\n        com_microsoft_outlook_size\n        com_microsoft_outlook_newsAccountID\n        com_microsoft_outlook_accountID\n        com_microsoft_outlook_repliedTo\n        com_microsoft_outlook_forwarded\n        com_microsoft_outlook_redirected\n        com_microsoft_outlook_toRecipients\n        com_microsoft_outlook_toEmailAddresses\n        com_microsoft_outlook_ccRecipients\n        com_microsoft_outlook_ccEmailAddresses\n        com_microsoft_outlook_bccRecipients\n        com_microsoft_outlook_bccEmailAddresses\n        com_microsoft_outlook_attachments\n        com_microsoft_outlook_has_attachments\n        com_microsoft_outlook_has_mentioned_me\n        com_microsoft_outlook_projects\n        com_microsoft_outlook_categories\n        com_microsoft_outlook_primaryCategory\n        com_microsoft_outlook_flagged\n        com_microsoft_outlook_author_email_addresses            \n        com_microsoft_outlook_recpient_email_addresses\n        com_microsoft_outlook_isFromMailingList\n        \n        com_microsoft_outlook_hasStartDate\n        com_microsoft_outlook_startDate\n        com_microsoft_outlook_hasDueDate\n        kMDItemDueDate\n        com_microsoft_outlook_has_reminder\n        com_microsoft_outlook_completed\n        com_microsoft_outlook_completedDate\n\n    </allattrs>\n    <displayattrs>\n        kMDItemContentCreationDate\n        kMDItemAuthors\n        kMDItemRecipients\n        kMDItemCoverage\n        kMDItemContentModificationDate\n    </displayattrs>\n</type>\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro starts with \"Installing onto SSD\" MacBook Pro Retina mid 2014 13\" macOS catalina 10.15.2 I believe. Suddenly during startup it goes into some grey mode and says \"Installing onto SSD\". \nI've not seen this mode before. Will it erase my files? I have shut it down using the power button because I didn't want to overwrite personal stuff... Any idea why this mode comes up? \nI have used Windows 10 Bootcamp on an external drive, which I have disconnected, and also another external drive, now disconnected. Maybe it's related.

I am running MacOS 10.14.5. I used symbolic links a lot to free up my internal drive. My internal drive is almost full and I need to free up some spaces again. Normally, the symbolic links solution work very well even for many apps. But there is one app which can not recognize the symbolic link I created. So I am wondering how to workaround this issue? I have to move this app's library directory to external ssd drive, it uses 50% of my internal drive. \nBtw, the path I plan to move is at ~/Library/Containers/xxxx.\nThanks a lot.\nPS: I am wondering if I can create a .sparseimage file and then put it at external drive. And add it somehow to /etc/fstab to mount it at a specific location. Not sure if this will work. I am checking this way now.\n\nA: OK, finally I solved this problem. My solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Disk Utility.app to create a new blank image with sparseimage type and save it at the external ssd drive.\n\n*Then mount the sparse image at the target location, such as hdiutil attach /Volumes/<externalssd>/file.sparseimage -mountpoint ~/Library/Containers/<target_path>\n\n*move all the original files to the mounted point. \n\n\nThat's all. By the way, you need to quit the app first and rename the target directory to something else before mounting the image obviously. \nOne more tip: you should make sure the target directory you want to move will not have any broken symbolic links after this workaround by running find . -type l -ls command. \n", "Q: How to prevent process / daemon from running on macOS? I installed an app called \"ShadowsocksX-NG\" and then whenever I restart my computer, /Users/admin/Library/Application Support/ShadowsocksX-NG/ss-local -c ss-local-config.json will be running in the background. This is undesirable. Obviously this process is not in my Login Items. Where and how does macOS handle daemons?\n\nA: First, Shadowsocks has an active GitHub site where you can ask this question directly to the people working on the project. They're likely to know a lot more about it than anyone here.\nThat being said, Shadowsocks (from our discussion, above) creates these launchd plist files programmatically, so there is no easy way — short of going to GitHub and becoming a project contributor — to stop it from doing so. I assume you want ss-local to be running while Shadowsocks is running, you just don't want it to be running the rest of the time. You can do this manually through terminal using the launchctl utility. First you need to get the Label of the launchd job, so open the plist files that Shadowsocks creates in a text editor and look for something like this:\n<key>Label</key>\n<string>com.Shadowsocks.something.whatever</string>\n\nThe bit between the <string> tags is the launchd job label, so if you run the following command in terminal (once for each plist file):\nlaunchctl remove com.Shadowsocks.something.whatever\n\nIt will remove the job from launchd, which shuts down whatever processes those jobs are running. I assume that Shadowsocks will restart the jobs when you launch it again, but if not, you can do that manually as well, using:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<filename>.plist\n\nYou could script this in a couple of different ways, I think, but I don't know what scripting languages you're familiar with (if any), and it would be better to go to GitHub and ask for a developer solution regardless.\n\nEDIT:\nPer comments... OSX used to have a system for creating logout hooks through the Window Server, but that was deprecated back in 10.4, and I don't know if it still works. So instead, I'm going to tell you how to create a background script app that should do what you want.\nHere's the script, follow the instructions below:\n(*\n  add the job labels for the plist files Shadowsocks creates to the following \n  list. This assumes that they follow the normal convention where the file name\n  is the job label with '.plist' attached.

It will do the same thing when it quits, at logout, restart, or shutdown.\nI've set the idle time to 15 minutes, which seems reasonable (on average, ss-local will only run for 7.5 minutes after you quit Shadowsocks)\nOnce you're sure it works the way you want, you can turn it into a proper background app. Quit the app and open its info.plist file - right-click on the app and choose \"Show Package Contents\"; info.plist will be down in the 'contents' folder — and add in the following key-value pair (being careful not to mess up the other key-value pairs):\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<true/>\n\nThis keeps the app from becoming visible (no dock icon, and it never becomes frontmost or takes over the menu). It can still display alerts (useful for error debugging) but that's it. You can quit it manually by double-clicking on the icon again; that's what the reopen handler is for.\n", "Q: Batch removing part of filenames using Automator I'm trying to create an Automator script that removes portion of a filename after a delimeter while preserving the extension. \nFiles are usually called like 1-cropped_DSC5888.jpg, 2-cropped_Whatsapp75.png etc. I want to remove everything after _ and keep only the part with number and '-cropped' so like: 1-cropped.jpg\nI tried it with this script\non run {input, parameters}\ntry\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\"_\"}\n    set theFileNameList to {}\n    repeat with thisItem in input\n        set the end of theFileNameList to text item 2 of (thisItem as text)\n    end repeat\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {}\n    return theFileNameList\non error eStr number eNum\n    display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n        default button 1 with icon caution\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {}\n    return\nend try\n\nend run\nBut this removes the part I want to keep and keeps the part I want to delete.

Your Mac is probably just a year to early.\nThe industry switched to EFI booting of Windows in 2011. Apple did not catch up until around 2012/2013. This is also the time Apple starting to eliminate the optical drives from Mac models. However, since Windows 7 required a BIOS boot, Apple started adding the ability to BIOS boot from USB. This continued through at least the 2014 model year. In 2015, Apple started to eliminate the ability to BIOS boot entirely, which effectively ended the ability to install Windows 7.\nSo your model probably can not BIOS boot from USB. However, some (if not all) of the very next year MacBook Pro models can BIOS boot from USB. For example, see the question Bootcamp “Missing Operating System” on external drive.\nOne possible way to come close to having Windows on an USB drive would be to put the System partition on the internal drive and Windows partition on the USB drive. The System and Windows partitions are described in the Microsoft document BIOS/MBR-based hard drive partitions. I have never tested such an arrangement to see if it would work with any Mac model. You would have to try this on your Mac to see if it would work.\nAnother option would be the following. Since you have Windows already installed on the internal drive, try rebuilding the BCD on the internal drive. Windows on the USB drive may be detected and included in a Windows boot manager.\nA final note. Your question included the command which is repeated below.\nsudo bless --device /dev/disk3s1 --setBoot --legacy\n\nI believe the --device /dev/disk3s1 is a dummy option which is ignored. In other words, when specifying the the legacy boot option, the firmware tries to BIOS boot. There is no way to select the boot drive.\n\nA: \nCan I actually boot from USB with the MBR bootloader on Mac or not?\n\nYes.\nI have a Macbook Pro 8,1 that can boot Ubuntu live USB, which uses MBR.\nMoreover the bless is not necessary.\n", "Q: Is latest 16\" MacBook Pro powerful enough to stream 4k video from Plex to AppleTV without buffering issues?

After a few seconds the error message disappears and the movie resumes at full quality.\nThe problem can be eliminated by telling the Plex client to play the content at 1080p instead of 4k but I much prefer the visual quality of 4k.\nQuestion:\nWill upgrading to the latest 2020-era 16\" fully spec'd MacBook Pro (2TB SSD + 32GB RAM) eliminate the buffering issue when delivering 4k content from Plex Server to AppleTV? Is there a way for novice consumers like me to figure this out on their own by looking at the more modern Mac's specs? It feels like my current 2015 machine is almost powerful enough to do it, but not quite. I'm hoping a Mac upgrade would solve the problem.\nUPDATE:\nThe CPU specs for my 2015 Mac are: 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7\nThe CPU specs for the current model Mac I'm considering for purchase are: 2.4GHz 8‑core Intel Core i9, Turbo Boost up to 5.0GHz, with 16MB shared L3 cache\n\nA: I eventually ended up getting that new 2020 16\" MacBook Pro and can conclusively say the answer is Yes.\n4K .mkv files stream from the Plex Server running on the Mac to the Plex client running on an AppleTV box with no buffering/delays.

In older releases of macOS one could create .metadata_never_index in any folder to prevent it and its children from being indexed. This seems to have stopped working at some point. Does this or another similar method work in Catalina and Mojave?\nNote: I am not interested in adding .noindex to file/folder names.\n\nA: Your suspicion is correct. Apple has (criminally) went ahead and removed support for not indexing an entire folder. While I pray they add this back, its unlikely, as they have made the same change in the file indexer for iCloud Documents and Data Sync (.nosync files in folders no longer work, you need .nosync in the file name).\nYou said you don't want to change file names, so unfortunately there is nothing you can do.\nIf you could settle for the illusion of unchanged file names, you could rename the files to be hidden (start with a .), and end with .noindex, and then create a symlink to this hidden file from a link with the originally desired file name.\nThis answer regarding the equivalent issue for iCloud Sync is along the lines of what you'd need to do (note the accepted answer on the linked question is outdated and no longer correct)\n\nA: Please see my recent post about problems with folders (or volumes) with file \".metadata_never_index_unless_rootfs\").

I have encountered mixed reviews about what will work with Boot Camp. I am willing to sacrifice display quality for speed as I will be using various types of statistical software and ArcGIS. \n\nA: You have to check with the manufacturer to ensure it works with the OS on the Bootcamp partition.\nThere is no Bootcamp “compatible” hardware because Bootcamp isn’t an operating system, it’s  functionality built into your Mac.\nSo, you have to check to see if the dock, displays, and any other ancillary devices are compatible with macOS and Windows 10 (for example).\nThat said, docks and displays rarely have specific OS drivers.  Get quality ones of each and you should be fine.\n\nA: This kind of depends on the monitors. For example, if you need the traditional Mac displayports, you would buy a Thunderbolt 3 Dual \nDisplayPort Adapter. \n\nA: No wait, you can't use bootcamp like that.\nBootcamp is designed to allow you to change your operating system while the computer boots.\nNothing allows you to swap purely between operating systems that way. you can use software that runs Windows in OS X with hardware virtualization, a huge step up from the software virtual machines of old.\nThere are three good options: \nParallels, VMWare Fusion, and VirtualBox, \nthe last of which has the advantage of being free.\n", "Q: How to (and should I) put a path to user-installed python ahead of system-installed python?

I found a similar question, but it's a few years old, and the answer wasn't definitive. Here's the question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Did the 64GB iPhone SE ever ship with iOS 10 installed?\nI need an iOS 9 device (for access to some old apps) since my iPhone 6 got caught in an Activation Error loop. I was gonna buy a sealed iPhone SE, since those originally shipped with iOS 9.3, but wanna be sure they never left the factory with anything higher, and if they did, how I can tell which is which.\n\nA: While the iPhone SE originally shipped with iOS 9.3, you'd most likely not find find a recently manufactured one coming pre-installed with iOS 9.3 (or a later version of iOS 9.x).\niPhone SE models was discontinued on March 21, 2017 (16 and 64 GB variants) and September 12, 2018 (32 and 128 GB variants). Either one of these models, which you'd most likely find with a reseller who is still selling them, would most likely come pre-installed with either iOS 10 or later (but still below iOS 13).\nIf iOS 9.x is what you are looking for to access iOS 9 exclusive apps, here's the list of iOS devices that can't be upgraded past iOS 9.x. Getting access to one of them could serve your purpose:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 4S (latest operating system: iOS 9.3.6).\n\n*iPod Touch 5th generation (latest operating system: iOS 9.3.5).\n\n*iPad 2 (latest operating system: iOS 9.3.6 (Wi-Fi + cellular (CDMA)), iOS 9.3.5 (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + cellular (GSM))).\n\n*iPad 3rd generation (latest operating system: iOS 9.3.6 (Wi-Fi + cellular), iOS 9.3.5 (Wi-Fi).\n\n*iPad mini (latest operating system: iOS 9.3.6 (Wi-Fi + cellular), iOS 9.3.5 (Wi-Fi).\nSource: List of iOS devices\n\nA: The iPhone SE originally shipped with iOS 9.3. However, if you pick up a model that was manufactured more recently, it will come with a newer version of iOS preinstalled. For example, I bought an iPhone SE in early 2019 which came with iOS 10. This phenomenon is not exclusive to the SE—an iPhone 6S I bought in 2017 also came with iOS 10.\nLuckily, you can use the serial number on the box of an older iOS device to predict which OS it will have preinstalled, to a reasonably high degree of accuracy. Just enter the specified digits of the serial number on this website: https://repo.bearlike.net. Note that for newer devices, Apple has announced they will transition to randomized serial numbers in mid-2020.\nUnfortunately, you're going to run into a different problem after acquiring a device. According to an FAQ in the Jailbreak subreddit (Jailbreakers have reason to keep track of these things!), as of this writing Apple's servers will refuse to activate an iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S+ or iPad Air 2 that's running iOS 9.\nYou might have more luck with an iPhone 6 or iPhone 5S. These devices aren't listed in the FAQ, which could mean that they work, but could also mean that no one has tried them and documented the result.\nThe other option is to buy a device that can't be upgraded past iOS 9, although as I'm sure you're aware, these models will run more slowly.\nLastly, the checkm8 exploit may eventually allow iPhone X and older devices to be downgraded to any compatible iOS version. However, no one has actually built software to do it as of this writing. And, any future tool that does will break touch ID, and require you to connect to your computer in order to boot your phone.\n\nA: In case anyone else comes looking, I still don't have a definitive buying guide, but here's a little more info. Any phones manufactured before September 2016 are more likely to have iOS 9 pre-installed. If you're able to get someone to provide you serial numbers from a sealed box, you can decode the manufacture date with the 4th and 5th characters. This website breaks down the code:\nhttps://beetstech.com/blog/decode-meaning-behind-apple-serial-number\n\nA: iPhone SE support latest iOS version till now, and it's 13.x is running currently.

My concern is with the integrity / security of the data on them. \nI don't have a large external HD / server to dump all the data onto, so my plan was to take out and keep the HDDs from each Mac mini, and put in a brand new SSD prior to sale. \nOther than doing the above, is there any steps I should taken to ensure integrity / security of the data? E.g. will anything be saved to the RAM or CPU / GPU or other components? \n\nA: RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its data when powered off.   \nThe same for the other components, and they don't really 'store' data, and it's likely to be in a form that doesn't lend itself to useful 'human' level data.\nIf you're wiping or replacing the storage device with a new/clean volume, then that won't contain any info associated with your AppleID. However, you'll need to remove the Mac from your ID's list of known (and therefore trusted) devices.\nAll the serial number records are tied at Apple - and Apple is designed to let a new owner “claim” that serial number but not snitch on who had it last. There’s never any reason for Apple to disclose who had gear other than a legal proceeding - they just register the gear to the new owner and that’s who “owns” that serial for now.\nYou could just perform a Secure Erase on the disks, though at their age that might be the final straw.\n", "Q: To where is the Catalina installer saved?

Is there a command that performs an undo or resets all the settings?\n\nA: The delete command will remove that setting. However, you would need to know if it existed and was true. What you did was write a false value to a true false setting. If your mac was already false, the command did nothing and there’s nothing to undo. \nIf the default state is false, deleting it won’t matter either. Here’s how to delete a variable:\ndefaults delete -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled\n\nAll settings would be hard to accomplish. You could erase everything and restore from backup. Or just reinstall the OS. I would focus on just looking at things you have and want to change unless you really have written tons and tons of things and an erase install would be good.

I have a Mac mini that runs a Samba server through the \"file sharing\" option in settings.\nI can create files on it and my clients can access it.

I tried going into properties and unchecking the \"read only\" option on the file but it gets checked again when I hit \"apply.\" My clients are Android and Windows.\n\nA: This is the reason why companies set up shared directories - to allow or deny group read / write permissions to files.\nYou will want to think about how you wish to have people authenticate and whether all shares can default to everyone can write.\nOn the Mac - files like this typically are homed in /Users/Shared so you could move those files to a place that’s naturally open to all accounts or change the permissions on the files you chose to share from the sharing panes.\nAnother last bit of advice, spend a little time thinking if you can use POSIX group / ID based permissions or want to layer on Access Control Lists (abbreviated ACL) that are more granular and can do things like add a group and then deny one member of that group from files and folders.\n", "Q: Sign in with Apple I'm a bit ashamed to ask this but is there a work around for Mac.com AppleID and Sign in with Apple?\nI can't use Sign in with Apple as my AppleID is Mac.com, I did setup a secondary email address for invoices etc but Sign in with Apple is stuck with Mac.com and obviously, give me an error every time I try ...\n\nA: It is possible to choose which mail to use in Sign in with Apple :\n\n\n*\n\n*First go to Settings > Your Apple ID > Name, Phone Number, Emails > Make sure the email you want to use is added.\n\n*Open the app and click Sign in with Apple and then click on Share my Mail.\n\n*It will then propose you which mail associated with you Apple ID you want to use.\n\nNote that it doesn't work with the Hide my Mail feature, and you'll have to change your mail Apple ID if you want to use it.\n", "Q: Why is Python version set with PyEnv global not picked up a default one?

On Windows there is this method exists: you create a backup image of the whole system (for example install all updates, tweak system parameters, harden the os, install some basic software and utilities).\nThis image comes with .vhd format, then you can easily convert it to .wim format and inject (in fact simply copy & paste with replace install.wim file) into Windows Install usb or disk. As the result next time you can quickly install already tweaked ready for work system.\nSorry for the long preamble. So is there a such thing for macOS? I found that installESD.dmg has the big compressed 5.hfs file. I guess the whole system contains there. But I couldn't open it. \nMy intention is to clone my macOS into bootable 16GB flash drive, so the clone should be compressed.\nIs there a way to make a compressed bootable clone of macOS?\n\nA: The concept of a registry or binding to AD means that all Macs are in the sysprep state always. There’s really no analog to needing to prepare a clone since any backup will work to drop a restored image. You can use asr or Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper or Time machine or APFS snapshots to make clonable images of macos including the apps, accounts, settings.\nThe installESD is more like the windows ISO than something that contains user date or settings.\nApple has tons of documents now on the automated install scripts to reinstall the OS - and in the past NetBoot could be used to clone and image, but macOS is now designed to do a clean install and then restore user files / apps / settings rather than slip streaming a new OS. Both get you to the same end point, automated, but the tools needed are different since you just install macOS and then run a migration script to get the data in and upgraded to the new OS if the migration is also an upgrade.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208020 Install for Catalina and newer macOS versions\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205054 NetBoot for older macOS versions\n\n", "Q: Can't Remove \"Previous System\" I upgraded Yosemite to Catalina.\nDeleted \"Previous System\" folder.\nWhen emptying Trash the OS complains \"item 'xxx' is in use\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooting doesn't help\n\n*sudo rm -rf doesn't help\n\n*rm -rf in Recovery Mode doesn't help\n\n*Disabling SIP doesn't help\n\n*Trash it doesn't help\n\n\nPlease help.\n\nA: It looks like you jumped ahead to some steps that aren’t needed. Apple recommends these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit any programs you know were using the file, then try emptying the trash.\n\n*If that doesn't work, restart your computer to kill off background processes, then try emptying the trash.\n\n*If that doesn't work, restart your computer in safe mode by holding down the shift key as it boots to prevent login items and automatically launched programs from running, then try emptying the trash.\n\n*If that doesn't work, restart your computer in Recovery mode by holding down ⌘-R, and when it boots, select \"Disk Utility\". In Disk Utility, use the \"First Aid\" feature to repair the disk containing the file you wish to delete. Then reboot your computer and empty the trash.\n\n\nThat is the end of the advice in the linked article from Apple, but if all that fails, make a Time Machine backup, erase the drive and reload your data. If Disk Utility and Safe Mode don’t clear things, it’s usually more hassle for trained mac admin to diagnose and fix than erase and reinstall.\n\nA: The message \"Item ____ is in use\" is an indicator to a possible solution that you don't appear to have tried, which is finding out what is using this file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Trash.\n\n*Find the folder and right click.\n\n*Select 'Put Back'\n\n*Clear the Trash to ensure it was actually the Previous System folder.\n\n*Go to the 'Previous System' folder\n\n\nIf there is a lot in this folder you'll need to do the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete something.\n\n*Try emptying the trash.\n\n\nKeep doing this until you find the thing(s) that are blocking you from emptying the trash, try to associate them with an application that is running on your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit that application using the application interface or Activity Monitor.\n\n*Try emptying the trash again.\n\n\nIf this works, great, if not you should contact the software vendor, or come back here with a follow up or new question.\nTips\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder you can quickly delete something to the trash using ⌘ + ⌫.\n\n*In Finder you can quickly empty the Trash using ⇧ ⌘ ⌫.\n\nA: @bmike Many thanks, you are right eventually!\nI mounted the drive to another system and ran fsck_apfs on the whole APFS container - after that I was able to empty Trash!\n", "Q: How can I check how often I have used my new MacBook? I am a new Mac user and I want to check how often I have used my Mac since I bought it? On Windows I would check the Event-Logs but I am lost on MacOs.\nI hope someone can help me with this.\n\nA: In the Utilities folder in Applications is the console tool.

On my Mac that command brings up an array of icons whose instances are still running. \nIt's quite annoying. How do I remove it from this array of icons? \nI don't know the right term for this \"array\", but it's like the horizontal bar that shows up midscreen when you press Control + Tab on Windows (I've remapped my Mac keys so I don't know the Mac specific command for it).\n\nA: It sounds like the issue you are facing is converting from Windows to Mac.\nIn macOS most applications are disassociated from the closing of windows, an example would be in the Safari web browser. If you close all the windows the application remains open because you only closed the windows, you didn't quit the application.\nThis is signifciantly different from Windows where closing a window typically quit the application.\nIn some applications on macOS closing the last window will quit the application but it isn't standard or default behaviour.\nThere is no option to make this happen. You can quit the application using ⌘ + Q (Command + Q), the shortcut you mentioned you forgot is  Command + W.\nEssentially Command + W is not the same as Alt + F4 and there is no way to make macOS behave this way as unlike Windows you cannot easily make macOS open multiple applications from the same link, i.e. clicking Chrome twice doesn't open two Chrome windows, it opens Chrome then brings it to the front on the second click.\n", "Q: How do I permanently turn off updates?

This opens a panel where you can change or turn off updates. This is for High Sierra. It may be different in Catalina but I thought it was worth the effort to check.\n\nA: I'm posting this as an answer in the hope that this will solve someone elses problems.\nScenario: every time I left my backups to run or downloads running in the background I would leave my machine alone and prevent the machine going to sleep using the Energy Saver settings. I would almost always come back to find the computer turned off and then find that an Software Update had been applied but my backups had been killed and I was either switched off or the machine was back at the login screen having restarted.\nI spent a huge amount of time looking through the system logs and tracing events and found that the constant logging out and restarting was down to a setting deep in the system:\nSystem Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > (unlock the lock at the bottom) > Advanced \nYou will now see a little checkbox called \"Logout after 60 mins of inactivity\"\nIt took me weeks to find this, and a lot of sanity and paranoia.

In other words, the answer assumes the Windows NTFS partitions are not encrypted.\n\nBelow is an example which closely (but not exactly) matches your situation.\nHere, I have already setup two Windows 10 installations where the boot manager, shown below, is used to choose which Windows to boot.\n\nThe drive, used in this example, contains your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 11th partitions, albeit the sizes might be different. Also, note the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*My equivalent to your 3rd partition has the label BOOTCAMP.\n\n*My equivalent to your 7th partition is a unformatted and of type Microsoft Basic Data.\n\n\nFor simplicity, I did not include separate recovery partitions. However, creating these partitions for both Windows installations is possible. If using the Boot Camp Assistant to create the first Windows installation, then you probably will need to create and initialize the recovery partition after Windows finishes installing.\n\nNote: A good new question would be how to create the second Windows installation without making such a mess of the partitioning.\n\nHere I will assume you correctly built the Windows USB installer.\n\nBelow is the procedure I used to separate the booting of the two Windows installations.\n\nBoot from the Windows 10 USB installer. Proceed until you reach the screen shown below.\n\n\nAt this point, any drivers that may be required to access disk0 have been loaded.\n\nNext, enter the shift+F10 key combination to open a Command Prompt window, as shown below.\n\nNext, use the diskpart, ren and bcdboot commands to separate the booting of the two Windows installations.

See here for the current list of Apple products considered as vintage or obsolete by Apple. \nBased on those definitions and the current lists for vintage and obsolete products, it looks to me like the Mac mini 2014 may get an OS update at least for another year.\n\nA: It's impossible to say what Apple's future plans might be. However, you can of course continue to use a Mac perfectly well without upgrading.\nBut: if I still had a 2014 Mini, I'd be saving up for a better Mac. ;-)\n", "Q: New user owns old apps in Mac I just created a second user in my computer so guests can use my Mac without the need of using my account. I did this through the GUI (Settings → Users → New User).\nWhile trying to set up permissions and restrictions. I can see that this new user is shown as owner of some of the Applications in my Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is this happening?\n\n*Should it be happening at all?\n\n*Is this Unix related, or macOS related?\n\n\nA: Apps that are dragged into the /Applications folder by a user will be owned by that user - e.g. the Unix owner attribute will be that of the user that did the dragging. Apps from the Mac App Store and apps that were delivered via an installer package tend to have root as their owner.\ndrwxrwxr-x@  13 root  admin    416 28 Nov  2012 Adobe Photoshop CS6\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 root  wheel     96  8 Oct 12:31 Affinity Designer.app\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 root  wheel     96  8 Oct 12:31 Affinity Photo.app\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 Ben   admin     96 31 Oct 13:03 Affinity Publisher.app\ndrwxr-xr-x@   3 root  wheel     96 23 Jul  2019 App Store.app\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 Ben   staff     96  3 Oct  2012 Art Directors Toolkit 5i.app\n\nThe apps here with owner \"Ben\" were downloaded and dragged into the /Applications folder. The root-owned apps are OS-bundled, from the Mac App Store, or installed via a .pkg.\nThe group varies, but is largely irrelevant.\nShould it be happening at all?\nNo. Creating a new user account should not change the ownership of these apps. \nIs this Unix related, or macOS related?\nMacOS is Unix™. But yes, it's happening at the Unix/POSIX level of file attributes.\nWhy is this happening?\nWithout more information, this is unknown. \nThe only reason I can think of relates to User ID numbers. Every user has a unique ID number. The first user created is number 501. Subsequent accounts will be numbered 502, 503, etc. \nIt may be that the original account used to move these apps to the /Applications folder was deleted, and the new user account has been given the same user ID number, thus inheriting its ownerships.\nYou can determine the UID of a user with id -u <username>.  \nAs long as the app has the read and execute flags set for all users, then everyone can launch the app. The ownership only matters for deleting the app.\n\nA: Obviously, you should set up the new user so that it can't \"manage your computer.\"\nAnd I would go on to say that \"the account which you use every day\" should not be able to do that, either.\nNevertheless, users do not \"own\" applications.\n", "Q: How to install Python on macOS Catalina using homebrew?

When I go to https://apps.apple.com/ it only says \"This app is available only on the App Store for iPhone and iPad.\"\nThanks!\n\nA: You can’t gift iOS apps from your computer. You can do simply from an iPhone or iPad that supports iOS. \nHowever, another alternative that you can use is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Business Manager and MDM Tool.\nOnce you purchase the license for the app/tool, you can push it for the user from MDM Tool which will synchronize with ABM. ABM is free but should be associated with the company with valid registration from the Apple support team and you need to purchase the MDM tool for it. You can deploy on-premises or in the cloud. This is a solution for big corporate companies who want to have a proper inventory of their Apple Devices too. \nJust a reference to show you how ABM Apps distribution looks like: \n\nNote: The above solution is expensive and needs a proper plan.

Even though you remain connected to your WiFi network (which eliminates any problems with your Mac ...), traffic destined for the Internet isn't consistently being delivered for some \"upstream\" reason.\n\nIf you happen to be curious about how it all works, console commands like traceroute can actually show you exactly how a packet \"bounces\" from one server to another to another within the Internet as it magically gets to where it needs to go ... sometimes taking a different path each time.\n\n", "Q: How to install a second Win10 on a Macbook Pro 2019 with Catalina and Windows 10 already installed?

On Linux,on GitHub, in bash on iTerm2, and generally by convention most everywhere else, the following files would have the following order:\n_01_file\n_03_file\n_2_file\n\nIn Mac® Finder, however, they have this order:\n_01_file\n_2_file\n_03_file\n\nCan this behavior be changed?  If so, how?\nLikewise, is it possible to have directories appear at the top of a list of files in Finder, as is common in Nemo/Nautilus?\nTo be redundant:\n$ ls\n_01_file  _03_file  _2_file\n\nand:\n\nRe: Allan's comment:\n\nis there an option somewhere else that can change ascii precedence?\n\nA: Is there a way to change the order in which the finder alphabetizes?\nUnfortunately, no.\nSince Mac OS X 10.0 \"Cheetah\", when sorting items by filename in Finder, files are sorted using the Unicode Collation Algorithm, with an additional specification that numeric substrings are sorted by numeric value, i.e. if multiple files exist whose filenames are of the form xny, where x is a susbtring that does not end with a digit, n is a substring which only consists of digits, and y is a substring that does not begin with a digit, then each such n is treated as a numeric value rather than a sequence of bytes, and the files are sorted accordingly. There is no option to disable this \"natural canonical sorting\", as some refer to it. This is stated officially in Apple's File System Programming Guide for macOS (§ File System Details):\n\nThe Finder\nBecause the Finder is the user’s main access to the file system in macOS, it helps to understand a little about how the Finder presents and works with files.\nFilename Sorting Rules\nThe Finder’s sort order for file and directory names is based on the Unicode Collation Algorithm (Technical Standard UTS #10) defined by the Unicode Consortium. That standard provides a complete and unambiguous sort ordering for all Unicode characters and is available on the Unicode Consortium website (http://www.unicode.org). The Finder alters the default sorting behavior of this algorithm slightly by taking advantage of some sanctioned alternatives, specifically:\n\n*\n\n*Punctuation and symbols are significant for sorting.\n\n*Substrings of digits are sorted according to their numeric value, as opposed to sorting the actual characters in the number.\n\n*Case is not considered during sorting.\n\n\nNote that this behaviour is only exhibited by Finder itself. Other programs, such as the plain old BSD ls that comes packaged with macOS, behave in their own ways; typically, such BSD utilities abide by the Unix-style convention of sorting \"lexicographically\", i.e. by character encoding value.\nIs it possible to have directories appear at the top of a list of files in Finder?\nThis can be done using the \"Arrange/Group by Kind\" option, but this then applies to other categories of files as well (e.g. media, documents), not just folders. Note that this does not group them by file extension, but rather into a set of groups defined by Apple.\nIf you just want folders first, but don't want everything else put into those other groups, then you should set \"Group by\" to \"None\", \"Sort by\" to \"Name\", and enable the following Finder preference:\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder.\n\n*Press ⌘+,; or go to [Finder] in the menu bar, then [Preferences...].\n\n*Go to [Advanced] and Enable \"Keep folder on top: in windows when sorting by name\". (This setting has slightly different names in various versions of macOS, e.g. \"Keep folders on top when sorting by name\" in macOS Sierra.)\n\nThere is no way to sort/group the files by their file extension; setting \"Sort by\" to \"Kind\" sorts them according to the same groups that are used if you set \"Group by\" to \"Kind\", just without showing the group headings.\n\nAs a workaround to both of these issues, you can use an alternative file browser such as Path Finder, which was partially designed to cater to these specific use cases.\n", "Q: is thre a way to find recent files with locate OR automatically update the database each time a file is created I am on MacOS Catalina. locate is a great command but unfortunately, I have difficulties to find files which have been created for example one hour ago or ten minutes ago.\nIt seems that I could circumvent this issue by updating the database with a higher frequency than every 24 hours.\nBut the other problem is that, when I launch the command /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb in root, it lasts much time before this command ends. \nSo I conclude that update rebuilds completly the database and doesn't update only the new files created from last locate.updateb execution : indeed, this would be a big gain of time if the command was not rebuilding all the database with all the files of the system.\nFinally, I think about a simple strategy : modidy \n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plistto force it to update for example the database every 5 minutes. But if the command /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb rebuilds all the database every 5 minutes, this doesn't make sense.\nSo, I would like to get feedback from people who have this kind of problem and how they solved it. I prefer to avoid using the command mdfind but if there is not available solution with locate and not the possibility not to have to rebuild all content each time (in my case, this would be each five minutes), I would be obliged to switch to mdfind.\nBy the way, a simple crontab launching every 5 minutes the command /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb is also allowed, isn't it ?\nYou could also advise me to use find with -mtime flag but find is very slow (associated with parallel, it might be an alternative, I don't know, actually, I am a locate fan since I have used it a lot on Linux). \nAny clue/remark/feedback are welcome, \nRegards\n\nA: \nI prefer to avoid using the command mdfind\n\nWhy is that? It solves your problem with no additional work. Getting locate to do update constantly is going to keep your Mac busy scanning the entire hard drive almost all the time. In the meantime,\nmdfind -name filename.txt\n\nWill produce the same result with no extra work by you or by your Mac. Since macOS keeps Spotlight up to date automatically, this will find files immediately after they're created. You could even use a really short shell script like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ \"$1\" ==  \"\" ]; then\n    echo What files do you want to find?\nelse\n    mdfind -name $1\nfi\n\nThen alias locate or some other command to call the script.\n\nA: You seem to prefer a CLI solution. I'm a frequent user of the CLI in MacOS, but we must all live with the fact that Apple does not update many of their command line tools. For example, on my Macbook Pro running Mojave, the locate tool doesn't support the --version argument, but man locate has a date at the bottom that was about 14 years ago. So - the locate tool in Catalina is not the same locate you've used on Linux. \nThat said, my \"answer\" is more along the lines of a suggestion that you consider using the \"smart folder\" feature in Finder. It allows you to filter a variety of file and folder types, and show them in Finder's sidebar. This may suit your needs, or it may not. In either case, you now know that Catalina's locate tool is fairly old now. \nSince my answer is off-topic I won't elaborate further, but there are some decent \"How-To\" guides for using smart folders available online if you're interested.\n\nA: Built in utilities are not all things to all people.  Rather than trying to force locate(1) into something it wasn't designed for, why not investigate something like fd or fzf?\n", "Q: Which part of iPhone is responsible for radiation I wonder what part of the iPhone is responsible for the radiation? Is it battery?\n\nA: By radiation, I'm assuming you mean the creation of electromagnetic waves and not the movement of sub-atomic particles like X-Rays.\nIn that case, it would be the transmitter (technically the transceiver since it's an all in one device).  It's the transmitter that generates the electromagnetic waves at their respective frequencies with embedded data through the antennas that creates this radiation.\nHow a Transmitter Works\n\nThere's three components to a transmitter\n\n*\n\n*Oscillator creates the \"carrier wave\" at a specified frequency.  This is the LTE, GSM or PCS frequencies that your carrier (AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, etc.) uses.\n\n\n*Modulator embeds all of the data onto the wave signal generated by the oscillator\n\n\n*Amplifier (with antenna) takes that signal and increases it's power so that it's strong enough to reach the closest receiver.\nParticle Radiation\nIf you're referring to the movement of sub-atomic particles from your iPhone, there isn't any.  There's no component (like the battery you mentioned) with any degree of radioactivity (This is the \"dangerous radiation\").  It would be illegal to sell that to the general public.\n\nA: Your question is ambiguous. There are many different types of radiation, but you didn't specify which type. @MikeScott has indicated the iPhone's primary sources of radio frequency radiation in his answer, but these are not the only ones. \n\n\n*\n\n*the screen radiates electromagnetic radiation in the form of light\n\n*the battery radiates heat which is also a form of electromagnetic radiation\n\n*all of the circuitry in the iPhone radiates electromagnetic radiation in the form of radio waves and heat\n\n*the speakers radiate acoustic waves  \nSo there are many components in an iPhone responsible for radiation.\n\nA: It’s the radio antennas. It has to radiate in order to communicate with mobile phone networks, wifi networks, Bluetooth devices, and so on. \n\nA: The only form of radiation emitted by a phone which has any significant amount of energy is the radio transmitter which talks to the tower.  It is a very weak signal, but there are those who suggest that it is unhealthy to hold your phone up next to your brain.\nI don't worry about that, personally, with my phone, but when I'm using my HAM radio \"HT,\" I do always use a microphone since the power of that transmitter might be as high as five watts.\n", "Q: How much storage does iOS 12 require?

I am afraid I will not have any storage left for apps and data.\n\nA: After installing iOS 12, and then restoring my device to factory default I see that the iOS take 5.1 GB.\n\n\nA: To me it seems like iOS 12 is consuming up to 7 GB of the disk on a relatively clean install.\nBelow are my details (same iPad model as original poster with iOS 12.4.8):\nAfter doing a factory reset and importing a very modest iCloud backup:\n\nAfter doing a factory reset and not doing any iCloud backup:\n\nA few days after the factory reset while doing practically nothing on the iPad:\n\nI also have an iPod with iOS 12 (not a fresh install), this is what it reports:\n\nTo me that looks roughly consistent with the numbers for the iPad.\nFinally, this is what Apple states for iOS 14:\n\nAvailable space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 10GB to 13GB of space (including iPadOS and preinstalled apps) depending on the model and settings. Preinstalled apps use about 4GB, and you can delete these apps and restore them. Storage capacity subject to change based on software version and may vary by device.\n\n\nA: iOS 12 is around 2-3GB in size, (2.77GB according to CNET), however this isn't something you particularly need to worry about, your iPad will not allow you to update the device if there is not enough free space for the update.\nThat said you should take a backup first and be prepared for a difference in performance as new versions add new features that require more system resources, but the hardware doesn't change.\nSo go ahead and upgrade.\n", "Q: AppleScript app not responding force close I have a simple script:\ncaffeinate -di \nthat I saved as an app.  When I click on the app it runs the process and stays in the dock.

In this case an NSTask can be used, since it runs in the background, and the application is just used to start and stop it.\nThe following needs to be saved as a stay-open application - the shell script is launched and terminated with the app:\nuse AppleScript version \"2.4\" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse scripting additions\n\nproperty task : missing value -- keep track of the NSTask\n\non run -- example\n    tell current application's NSTask's alloc()'s init()\n        set my task to it\n        its setLaunchPath:\"/bin/sh\"\n        its setArguments:{\"-c\", \"/usr/bin/caffeinate -di\"}\n        tell it to |launch|()\n    end tell\nend run\n\non quit\n    if task's isRunning then tell task to terminate()\n    continue quit\nend quit\n\n", "Q: Google Backup and Sync super slow and 100% CPU usage for days I recently copied a lot of files into a synced folder to be back them up. The total file size was about 30GB, I have 10MB up/100MB down internet connection. So in a perfect world 8 hours should have been enough to sync. \nGoogle Backup and Sync kicked in and was at 100% CPU with the fan on hair dryer mode for nearly 2 weeks. Unfortunately there were 1000s of extremely small source code files which Google Backup can not handle efficiently. See https://support.google.com/drive/thread/5381381?hl=en\nSetup:\n2018 MacBook Air \nInternet: 100MB download and 10MB upload\nCatalina 10.15.3 (19D76)\nGoogle Backup and Sync\nVersion 3.48.8668.1939\nWhat can be done to speed things up and avoid this?\n\nA: I thought it would be more efficient to leave it on but I noticed that the number of files synced was increasing more slowly as time went on. Possibly due to an inefficiency as the back app was continuously scanning unsynced files. After a few days it was managing just 1000 files a day. When I restarted it would manage 500+ in the first half an hour.\nRather than constantly restarting the app here is an Apple Script which helped speed things up. It restarts Google Backup and Sync every half an hours which really helped.\nOpen the apple Script Editor. Copy the text into the script editor and hit “Run\"\nrepeat\n    log \"About to start Google backup and sync\"\n    tell application \"Backup and Sync\" to activate\n    log \"Starting for 30 minutes...\"\n    delay 1800\n    log \"About to quit Google backup and sync\"\n    tell application \"Backup and Sync\" to quit\n    log \"Application Closed\"\n    delay 60\nend repeat\n\n", "Q: How to Sync Books from Mac on Catalina I upgraded to macOS 10.15.3 and am having trouble syncing books from my Mac to iPad.\nIn the documentation I only see reference to iCloud. This would not be satisfactory to me.  \nIs there a way to sync my books like it was done through iTunes/Music?\n\nA: You can directly access the sync settings by opening Finder, then selecting the mobile device.\nAdditionally, the Books sync page is in iTunes/Music under sync settings.\n\n", "Q: Can I use an iMac 2014 as a display for a Mac mini I would like to use my iMac 2014 as a display for a Mac mini that I intend to buy. \nWill this work?\n\nA: First of all, your 2014 iMac has to be a mid year model. The late models do not have target display mode.\nYou do realize you will need two keyboards for this to work. One for the Mac mini and one to put the iMac in target display mode. \nI assume the Mac mini is a 2018 year model. This model does not have any Thunderbolt 1 or 2 ports. There are USB-C ports where Thunderbolt 3 devices can be attached.\nSo, if this is going to work, you will need an adaptor. Apple sells a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter for 49 USD. Next, you will need a thunderbolt 2 cable. Apple sells an Apple Thunderbolt Cable (0.5 m) - White for 29 USD. This is rather short, so you might want the Apple Thunderbolt Cable (2.0 m) - White for 39 USD.\nSo, 49 USD + 29 USD = 78 USD. You can buy a new 21.5\" 1920 x 1080 monitor for 70 USD. Granted, this monitor does not come with a  HDMI cable, so you might need to buy one.\n\nThe point is, you can buy a new monitor with the same size and resolution for about the same cost as the adaptor plus cable needed to use your old iMac as a display.\n\nNote: the 2018 mac mini does have a internal speaker.\n\nA: Yes, I believe you can use the iMac 2014 with Target Display, to do this you need to use a Thunderbolt 2 cable.\nI would suggest given this is untested you buy the computer from a store with a flexible return policy.\nAlso worth noting that the computer doesn't turn off when you use is as a display so you will have a computer powered on doing nothing.\nNote: You can toggle Target Display mode on the iMac using the keyboard command ⌘ + F2 on the iMac, not the Mac mini\n\nA: Target Display Mode requires two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A supported iMac - your 2014 iMac falls in that category\n\n*High Sierra or earlier.  It does not work on Mojave or later.  If you've upgraded, it will not work\n\n\nThere is no OS requirement for the source computer.\nYou can get full details from the Apple Support Document Use your iMac as a display with target display mode\n", "Q: Command line program to show contents of memory location? I want to inspect memory. In Linux I can probably just browse through /dev/mem, but how to view system memory at a specific location on the Mac though?\n\nA: Contrary to your assumption you cannot actually just browse through /dev/mem on a default Linux. A few years ago, the device was made restricted by default on Linux so that only very limited areas of memory are available this way. You can remove the restriction only by recompiling the kernel.\nOn macOS the device is completely restricted by default for similar security reasons. You can however enable it using a boot time parameter.\nExplicitly enable this by rebooting your Mac, holding the Command and R keys to start up in Recovery Mode. Then open the Utilities menu and select Terminal. From the Terminal you need to run the following command:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"kmem=1\"\n\nAfter rebooting you'll find that you have new /dev/mem and /dev/kmem (kernel memory) device files. \nYou'll need to use sudo or be root to access the devices. The /dev/mem device is addressed by physical memory address, and /dev/kmem by virtual memory address.\n", "Q: MBP 2016 + iMac 21 (mid 2011) using a thunderbolt 2->HDMI cable and an HDMI->type C adapter? I was wondering if that would work? I've found out this to be the cheapest option for me, albeit an awkward one.\n\nA: Both of these adaptors are design to output to a HDMI TV or monitor. The idea of going backwards and have the HDMI converted as input to a Mac is invalid.\nAlso, there is more going here than just using the Mac as a display. Each Mac gets access to the to the drives on the other Mac. You can also share the screen on the Mac being used as a display. For example, below is a image of what is was shown on the display of a 2013 iMac. This Mac was in Target Display mode. In other words, the 2013 Mac was being used as a second monitor connected to a another Mac. In the image, you can see the other Mac was using the Screen Sharing application. The Screen Sharing application window is showing the desktop of the 2013 iMac.\n\nP.S. Before you run out an buy the correct adaptors and cables, you might want to read my answer to the question Can I use an iMac 2014 as a display for a Mac mini.\n", "Q: iPhone photos still stuck on \"Restoring from iCloud\" I'm on the second day of processing and it still shows under all my photos \"Restoring from iCloud\". Should it also show at the iCloud backup that its restoring?  Thinking about resetting my phone and do the back up or maybe I should just wait.\nI have about 13k items altogether with pictures and videos. I think nothing is happening because the blue progress bar is not moving. I do notice when I unplug the power it will ask if I'd like to resume for an hour without power.  \n\nA: When syncing data from iCloud, you should remember that iOS syncs large data only when on Wi-Fi and charging. Please try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out from iCloud, then sign back in.\n\n*Put your device charging overnight with a good Wi-Fi connection.\n\n\nBe patient and keep in mind that download speed also depends on your Wi-Fi. If it's slow, downloading will take longer.\n", "Q: Edit outgoing IP packets How can I edit outgoing IP packets on the fly? \nI believe NetfilterQueue would allow me to do this on Linux, so I am looking for macOS alternatives.\nOverall, I want to be able to capture a packet sent from my machine to a specific IP address, edit some information in the IP header and send the packet on its way.\nEdit\nI have just skimmed through iptables man page and realized that mangle table would work perfectly for my usecase. As I understand, macOS's alternative to iptables is some variant of OpenBSD PF. I can't seem to find anything about altering packets in PF documentation. Is it possible to set some rules for altering packets using macOS PF?\n\nA: You can do one of two things:\n(a) Configure macOS's native packet filter, PF, to forward packets to a \"divert socket\" (akin to a Unix socket on Linux; see divert(4)). An application running in userspace can then listen on this divert socket and inspect packets, followed by dropping them or handing them back to the kernel (with or without modification) for sendoff. See this blog post for an example config, and pfctl(8), pf.conf(5), and the PF User's Guide for comprehensive info on PF's capabilities and how to configure it.\n(b) Deploy a kernel extension which uses the native IP filter interface, IPF (akin to Linux's Netfilter), to inspect, modify, and drop packets. See Jonathan Levin's Mac OS X and iOS Internals for details; the 1st edition describes this interface in §17.7.4 IP Filters (page 698).\nI don't know of any general-purpose daemons that work on principle (a) or kexts that use principle (b) that allow you to write config files that specify rules for modifying and dropping packets in transit, so it seems like you'd need to write your own daemon or kext for your specific use case.\n", "Q: Selectively delete Messages on macOS Is is possible to selectively delete Messages on Catalina?\nI currently have Keep messages: \"Forever\" enabled.\nMy daughter is a inveterate Messenger, and I want to keep some of her messages for sentimental reasons but I don't need the hundreds of \"Yay. Thank you.\" or similar.\nI have deleted all on my iPhone5S (running iOS12.4) but even there I would like the option to keep selected messages.\nAlternatively is it possible to export selected messages? I can copy, but this loses timestamps.\n\nA: It is possible to delete individual messages also in the Messages app on macOS. I don't know if exporting is possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Messages on your Mac computer.\n\n*Open the conversation which includes the messages you wish to delete.\n\n*Find and click on the specific text bubble (message) that you wish to remove. Make sure you select the entire message bubble, not just the text within it. (Easier to do this by clicking somewhere close to the corners of the message bubble. Your selection grays out a bit once selected.)\n\n*Press Command+Click to add additional message selections.\n\n*Once completed selecting, Control-Click or Right-Click and select Delete from the drop-down menu. (If you don’t see the Delete option, you probably selected the text rather than the message bubble. Control-Click or Right-Click after selecting multiple messages is a bit tricky. You may use the Edit -> Delete menu from Messages' menu at the top instead in either case.)\n\n\nThese directions mostly come from this source. You can take a look at it if you like a bit more detail on selective deletion and directions for other Messages related actions on your Mac. The official help page for Messages on macOS is also here.\n", "Q: Possible to have WinKey + Number equivalent in Mac for faster app switching In windows we can easily switch/open an app in the taskbar by doing WinKey + <order of the app in the taskbar> (e.g. WinKey+1 will open/switch the 1st app)\nJust to provide more context.

Rather than  I seek information   to authenticate these. \nWhat is the process to register and notarize for macOS?\nUpdate:\nI'm asking from the developer's perspective .. not as a user.\n\nA: Limited Options\nAs a developer wanting to distribute unsigned and unnotarized applications, your options are increasingly limited on macOS. You would not be alone disliking this trend.\nIf your users are technical, the advice from Apple can be referenced in your documentation. This will help a few potential users but will dramatically limit your audience.\nApple's Advice to Users\nApple provide Safely open apps on your Mac for users wishing to open unsigned and unnotarized applications on the latest versions of macOS.\nAlternative Certificate Authority\nIn theory, you could code sign your application using another certificate authority that has an appropriate root certificate pre-installed in macOS. This assumes you wish to avoid dealing with Apple, rather than wishing to avoid code signing.\nIs an Apple Developer Account Mandatory?\nI suspect an Apple Developer Account is not mandatory, but not having an account will make some tasks difficult.\nGiven you have a code signing certificate from Comodo (Sectigo), you could try using codesign with it. \nThe manual for codesign does not obviously state a requirement for an Apple issued certificate. A code signing certificate with a trusted root certificate in macOS should be useable.\nYou will need to create a new Keychain containing the certificate and private key. Then pass the absolute path of the keychain file to codesign via --keychain.\nOne possible problem you may run into is macOS's spctl, aka Gatekeeper. spctl's rules may state the signing certificate must have a root Apple certificate. Investigate the spctl tool on macOS.\nI recommending trying codesign with your certificate and then ask more questions as specific problems arise.\n", "Q: pdfsplit fails to start pdfsplit returns the

Would the iPhone upload the originals to iCloud and also keep them in its local drive? Would that allow me to connect it to my mac and import the photos?\n\nA: You have three questions here and I'll try to answer them, as they are intertwined, but in general it is better to ask one question at a time:\n\nisn't there a one-way syncing? \n\nSort of. There is Photo Stream which allows you to upload the iPhone's images from the last 30 days, which you can then import into your photos library. In your case, you'd have to enable iCloud Photos and My Photo Stream on the iPhone and only enable My Photo Stream on the mac. It would mean though, you have to import your photos/videos at least every 30 days to stay up to date. The support site is quite clear and even explains the differences.\n\nmaybe the Optimize iPhone Storage might be preventing this\n\nYes. That is exactly whats happening. Only actually downloaded photos/videos will show up on your mac. You could (if its just a very little amount oh media you want to import) manually download them before connecting to the Mac and afterwards import them.\n\nWhat would be the workflow, if I turn off the Storage Optimization?\n\nTurning off storage optimization would mean your iPhone would redownload all previous media and save them locally and also keep them on iCloud. Future photos/videos would be saved on iCloud and on your iPhone. This would allow you to import any media on your Mac. \nI hope this helps.\n\nA: iCloud is a sync tool with the idea to keep same updated data on multiple devices. If \"Keep originals\" setting for iCloud photos doesn't work for you, it's better to check for other services with more control over the data flow (Google Photos as an example).\n", "Q: How do I recover the Apple Developer Account Holder role? My organization’s account holder left the company. He used a private email address from his private domain when enrolling, so we don’t have how to take control of the email.\nHe is not denying transfer the account holder role to another employee, but he is taking a long time (more than a month now) to do that, which is weird.\nDo we have another course of action?\n\nA: The best course of action is to contact Apple directly and let them know the details of your situation. They should be able to transfer the account holder role, if they want. They would probably require a signed document from your CEO or similar.\n\nA: I've gone through this before. The answer from jksoegaard is correct: you need to reach out to Apple Developer Support and request that the Account Holder (previously named Team Agent) role be transferred to a different Apple ID. The target Apple ID must satisfy all of the following criteria:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be a member of the developer organization.\n\n*Have two-factor-authentication enabled.\n\n*Be a named person, not a generic role; john.smith@my-org is okay. admin@my-org is not.\nAdditionally here are some good practices to follow on the Apple ID for your Account Holder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use an email address issued and managed by the company.\n\n*Make sure you can login at https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin. This page has more stringent checks (prompting for security questions if they're set on the account) than logging into iCloud, for example.\n\n*Associate two (or more) modern Apple devices with the account for routine access. I think the new iPod Touch is a perfect backup device for developers on a budget.\n\n*Add two trusted phone numbers to the account for emergency access. Write a document that includes the full phone numbers and the people associated with them, then file it away somewhere safe. Apple won't tell you the numbers when you really want them.\n\n\nYou should also consider verifying an additional phone number you can access, such as a home phone, or a number used by a family member or close friend. You can use this number if you temporarily can't access your primary number or your own devices.\n\nAnd for anyone who ends up with the same problem I had -- an Account Holder that forgot answers to security questions -- don't bother trying to contact Apple to regain access to that account. They'll lead you in circles but never, ever help you regain access to it. Forgetting answers to the security questions means the account is burnt forever and cannot be recovered. Thankfully Apple is doing away with security questions.\n", "Q: How to mount a .dmg file with JXA? I made the below AppleScript\ntell application \"DiskImageMounter\"\n    try\n        open alias imagePath\n    on error errText\n        display dialog \"Could not mount\" & errText\n    end try\nend tell    \n\nI would like to remake it in JavaScript.  I tried to find the current API in the Script Editor library, but could not find how to control Disk Utility with JavaScript. \nWhat is the syntax or reference to interface with Disk Utility or otherwise mount a disk image file from the JXA framework?\n\nA: One wouldn't use DiskImageMounter to do this because, despite it giving the illusion that it's scriptable and loaded with commands in its AppleScript dictionary, it never returns a valid reference to any image that it opens; therefore AppleScript never gets informed it's done the job; and  DiskImageMounter sacks it off, quits, and invalidates the connection with AppleScript thus throwing an error.  And it does this every.  Single.  Time.  So, it is reliably balls.\nThe way to mount a disk image with AppleScript is to use an application I very rarely endorse using but for very few specific tasks, which is Finder.  DiskImageMounter is the only application less reliable than Finder, but Finder is a trier, and it does succeed with mounting volumes without causing too much of a stink:\nset f to POSIX file \"/path/to/diskimage.dmg\" as alias\ntell application id \"com.apple.Finder\" to open f\n\nIt, too, doesn't return a reference to the mounted volume, but you can get Finder to enumerate the disks already mounted beforehand, then enumerate them again afterwards, and the new one that appears will be your mounted volume:\nset f to POSIX file \"/path/to/diskImage.dmg\" as alias\ntell application id \"com.apple.Finder\"\n    set ejectables to disks\n\n    open f\n\n    repeat until disks ≠ ejectables\n        delay 1\n    end repeat\n\n    return the POSIX path of last item of (disks as alias list)\nend tell\n\n\nFinally...

Only iMac (27-inch, Late 2009), iMac (27-inch, Mid 2010), and iMac (Mid 2011 to Mid 2014) support Target Display Mode.\n\nApple Community states it as well.\n", "Q: Keyboard: how to enforce option-X system shortcuts when a program intercepts these shortcuts? I’m entering some less-used characters using option-key combination, eg option-o for ø on US layout (or ó on Polish layout). Unfortunately, some programs (namely IntelliJ/Android Studio) interpret such shortcuts on their own: in the \"Find in Path\" window, option-o toggles \"Words\" and so the character under option-o cannot be entered into search query (it can be typed in some other editor and pasted, but that's a short term solution). Unlike many other in IntelliJ, this shortcut is hardcoded and can not be turned off in preferences.\nCan I make the system handle such key combinations and prevent rogue programs from hijacking this valid input?\n/edit: I am not asking about alternative ways of getting those characters. For Polish layout users, option-(A,C,E,L,N,O,S,Z,X) are inherent part of the keyboard, as natural as Q, W or E being where they are.\n\nA: A alternative would be to create a custom keyboard layout where the characters that cause a problem are remapped to other convenient keys with Ukelele.\nYou can also try a keyboard shortcut for the problem characters via: System Preferences > Keyboard > Text > Replace With\n\nA: Option 1\nThere is no way that I am aware to directly resolve this that I am aware of however using the option keyboard entry is not the only way to do this...\nFor example all oolout characters ö, ï, ë etc. can be entered by entering ⌥ + U then you'll get this symbol:\n\nYou can then press the key you'd like i.e. o, i or e and you get the accented version, this also works for:\n\n\n*\n\n*U = Oomlout ¨\n\n*I = Caret ^\n\n*E = Acute ´\n\n*N = Tilda ~\nI've not got InteliJ enabled but this certainly always worked for me.\nOption 2\nAn alternative solution would be to create an App Shortcut that overrides the original, this may or may not work depending on how the application implemented the original shortcuts... It will only work for menubar shortcuts too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences.\n\n*Keyboard.\n\n*Shortcuts\n\n*App Shortcuts\n\n*Click +\n\n*Choose InteliJ as the 'Application'\n\n*Set the 'Menu Title' to be identical to that in the menu item of the problematic shortcut you are trying to replace\n\n*Click 'Keyboard Shortcut' and enter any other shortcut that isn't used.\n\n*Press 'Add'\n\n\nThis should remap the menu item that was blocking this shortcut, however if there was no menu item, just a hotkey this won't resolve the issue.\nOption 3\nContact the developer of IntelliJ and point out the issue and see if they can fix this for a future release.\n", "Q: How to find replacements for Dashboard widgets in macOS Notficiation Center I have been hesitating \"upgrading\" to macOS Catalina from Mojave because of its loss of the Dashboard.  I know that the Notification Center's \"Today\" view is supposed to replace the functionality of the Dashboard, and I'm willing to adapt to a new workflow if it's possible to recreate it in the newer OS version, but thus far I haven't found the same set of widgets that I use in the Dashboard. \nNotification Center seems to have a different set of working assumptions than Dashboard.  That is, instead of installing widgets, you have to install an application that supports a Notification Center extension.  Apps produced these days are mostly trying to grab your attention (hence \"Notification\" Center) rather than providing useful functions.\nSpecifically, there are a couple of dictionaries, including the built-in dictionary app and a 3rd party foreign language dictionary, that I frequently use in the Dashboard.  There is also a general-purpose web clipper tool that you can use to create a new widget out of a website.\nIs there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some secret rich repository of Notification Center widgets I don't know about where I might find a replacement for the dictionaries I use?\n\n*A way to search the Apple App Store for applications that offer widgets?\n\n*Some magic I can do with Script Editor to expose a widget from a current app like the macOS Dictionary?\n\n\nA: For the record, I've updated to macOS Catalina now.  The Notification center now has an \"App Store\" button that takes you to Apple's AppStore, where there is a section for Notification Center Widgets.  Although the selection is somewhat limited, it's nice to see a small collection of widgets.\n\nAlthough there is no widget to replace the dictionaries I described in the original post, it is not hard to use ⌘-Space to quickly get Apple's Dictionary App.  It is pretty straightforward to add various foreign language dictionaries to that application.\nAll in all, it has been possible to replace the features I liked in the discontinued Dashboard with Notification Center Widgets and other applications.\n", "Q: How do I access LastPass Passwords on iOS/iPadOS from web browser? Unlike macOS, there are no browser extensions to integrate LastPass on iOS or iPadOS in the web browser.\nAlthough I've installed the LastPass app on my iPhone & iPad, How do I access my passwords from a web browser?!?!?\n\nA: \nChrome Users:  Please note that LastPass has problems in iOS/iPadOS and as of 13.3.1, the fault is still present. All is not lost however as LastPass in the below example is tested and known to work correctly with Firefox as of iOS/iPadOS 13.3.1.\n\niOS/iPadOS Settings\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Choose Passwords & Accounts\n\n*Select AutoFill Passwords\n\n*Check the box next to LastPass\n\n*Uncheck the box next to iCloud Keychain.\n\n\n\nLastPass App\nBefore you can access any passwords, you must have the LasstPass app installed on your iPhone/iPad and be logged-into the App with your LastPass Master Password\n\nWeb Browser\nAlthough this example uses Firefox, the process is almost the same for Chrome users.\nStep 1\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the password field.\n\n*Open the share dialog by tapping on the 3 dots (Chrome users tap the share icon).\n\n*Choose \"Share Page With...\" I did say the process was counter-intuitive...\n\nStep 2\nTap LastPass\n\nStep 3\nTap the password offered in the LastPass dialog.\nThat's it.\n\nConclusion\nAlthough not a very intuitive process, using LastPass with a browser on iOS/iPadOS it's still pretty easy to use.\n", "Q: Which macOS processes handle iMessage network communications? I am trying to identify the macOS Catalina processes which handle network communication with Apple's iMessage servers. \nIf you have iMessage enabled and quit the Messages app, incoming messages are still delivered to your computer. \nI've tried killing the imagent and IMDPersistenceAgent processes because they sounded related to messaging, but the former seems to be related to FaceTime only and killing the latter did not stop incoming iMessages.\nTo be clear: I am not simply trying to disable iMessage. I am trying to identify the processes that handle communication with iMessage. This is for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The termination of these processes needs to be able to be executed in an automated bash script using pkill or something similar, and deactivation of iMessage cannot be done in such a way.\n\n*The computer needs to remain activated with the iMessage service so that when the processes are restarted (or the computer is restarted and the processes are launched on their own), any pending incoming iMessages are delivered. If iMessage were to be deactivated and then later activated, any messages during the period of time which it was deactivated would not be delivered.\n\n\nA: iMessage message delivery is not as such handled seperately in a specific process for that single purpose.\nInstead the generic apsd (Apple Push Notification Service Daemon) process handles the network communication. apsd handles Apple's push notification service in general.\nThe imagent process that you have already identified is indeed involved in iMessage, and not only Facetime. It is there to receive the notifications forwarded by the apsd process.\nIn addition there's a special case for iMessage attachments (i.e. very large iMessage messages in general). Their content is not transferred using push notificcations via apsd, but are rather downloaded from iCloud. That process is initiated via a notification from apsd however.\nAll in all this means that you can kill the apsd process, and keep it from restarting, and thereby stop iMessage messages from coming in (without \"deactivating\"). However it would also stop any other push notification from arriving at your computer.\n", "Q: Adding \"popup menu\" to an input method that doesn't support it I've recently seen several mentions of \"the popup menu of accented characters produced by press/hold\" that seem to say it exists in macOS.\nIt doesn't work with some input methods, unfortunately.  My favorite is \"Unicode Hex Input\" and it doesn't work there.\nI have in the past successfully changed input methods, but that was before this feature existed.  Is there a way to dump an input method to a human-editable format and copy/imitate how this pop-up trick is done?\n\nA: With Ukelele I was able to make a copy of the Unicode Hex input source and add the \"en\" language to the bundle format.  This seems to have created a version of Unicode Hex with a working popup, as shown below.  Modifying the popup would be a separate operation with the pressandhold.app.\nThe image shows the input source used both for Option 1234 (= U+1234, Ethiopic SEE) and the press/hold letter a.  I have not tested it in more detail.  A copy can be obtained here .\n \n", "Q: How do I delete email files on my mac so that it retrieves them again? The email on my mac is not working. I have tried several things.\nIs there a way to delete the email files (files where mac stores the emails) on my mac book pro so that it downloads all my mail again. (I will leave it to download overnight).\n\nA: You may need to rebuild a mailbox to update the list of messages it contains. For example, if messages appear to be missing or garbled, or if you can’t find all relevant messages when you search using the Entire Message search option.\nIn the Mail app on your Mac, select a mailbox in the sidebar.\nChoose Mailbox > Rebuild.\nWhen you rebuild mailboxes for IMAP or Exchange accounts, messages and attachments stored on your computer are discarded, and then downloaded again from the mail server to your Mac. Your mailbox appears empty until the download is complete.\n\nA: Delete only work in some cases, check your email configuration before you act: if you're using POP3 or your IMAP settings are MOVING messages from the server into your local computer, deleting messages or attachments will result in loss of data.\nI would recommend trying with the mailbox rebuild procedure suggested above.\n", "Q: How to prevent VLC from setting as default player?

I currently have 200GB on iCloud.\nIs it possible to use the 200GB on my Mac via the \"Optimize Storage\" option ?\nLet me give you an example: having 200GB of files on your Mac (as references), half of them only on the cloud and the other half actually on disk.\nOr is the total 128GB count done even if the files are only present on the iCloud?\n\nA: You can do this for iOS and macOS. The iCloud controls will tell you that there’s not enough space to download all the files and that you’ll have everything in the cloud, but only some files cached locally. \nSo, you can enable save space / optimize photos which will resample images with lossy compression or just store thumbnails locally. For actual files, you will download them from the cloud when needed and only have a subset of them in local storage. \nYou don’t need to have as much local storage as your full files stored in iCloud. \n", "Q: iPhone case material for best heat dissipation? What case material for iPhone is most effective at dissipating heat. With my current case, my iPhone 11 often feels hot at the bottom of the screen but cools down when I take the case off, so I am confident that the case causes some heat to linger around. I was wondering which material will be best at dissipating heat and if you have any recommendations? TPU, rubber, plastic, metal, silicone, etc?\nThis is not a shopping recommendation question, rather a material specific question.\n\nA: You can simply take a physics data book and lookup various materials to see how conductive they are.\nOf the ones you list, metal is going to be the most efficient. For example in computers, heat sinks are often made of aluminium.\nNote that there usually other properties to take into account when buying a phone case. For example it's hard to find transparent and very flexible metal (i.e. something that will allow you to bend the case slightly to allow you to put in the phone, but won't permanently deform the case).\nIn some cases those properties can mean that the phone won't be usable for you. For example, I know that you can buy cases with backs made of brushed steel. They are good at heat dissipation, they're flexible for you to put the phone into them easily - but the problem is they also block cell reception and WiFi signals.\n\nA: The best material for heat dissipation is going to be copper.  The problem is, it’s a soft metal that’s very malleable meaning it’ll deform quite easily.\nNext in line is aluminum, but it too, is a malleable material that will deform quite easily.\nThe down side to these conductive materials is that it conducts heat from all sources.  In other words, leave your aluminum encased phone out in the sun and it will cook.\nYour phone is going to generate heat, both from the chemical reaction within the battery and the fact you’re moving electrons around the circuitry.  \nLithium ion batteries have an operating threshold of between -20C and 65C (-4F and 140F). In other words, it functions in environments most humans can’t survive in.  Your iPhone doesn’t operate in anywhere near this environment - 0C to 35C (32F to 95F).  It will thermally shut down to protect itself if it gets too hot.\nIf you can hold it, it’s fine.  If it’s hot enough that you suffer actual burns, there’s a problem and you need to take it in for service.  As far as a case goes, get one that protects your phone and is aesthetically pleasing to you.\n", "Q: Offsite Backup Strategy for Multiple Macs I have 4 Macs in my household that have a decent local backup strategy.  I am preparing an offsite backup disk and wondering about the best strategy for structuring the offsite backup disk.\nI want to protect:\n\n\n*\n\n*4 Macs with a total of 3.75 TB of internal storage.  Approx. 80% usage of capacity\n\n*2 external drives connected to two of those Macs\n\n\n*\n\n*5 TB capacity, 50% used\n\n*4 TB capacity, 25% used\n\n\n\nPotential capacity to be backed up is 12.75 TB, but current data size is 6.5 TB.  I have purchased a single 8TB external drive to be taken offsite.  Yes 12.75 TB cannot fit in 8 TB, but 6.5 TB can.  I don't foresee the external drive usage to increase more than 1 TB in the next year.\nCaveats\nBacking up to the cloud is out of the question, as I am working with a 100 GB per month data budget.\nRequirements\n\n\n*\n\n*All of the data on the external drives is vital data and large, such as my photography.  That alone comprises 2.2 TB\n\n*Everyone in the household makes their living from their Macs.  If a big disaster happens, I need to purchase new Macs and get them back to fully functioning in the shortest time possible\n\n\nBackup format\nEach Mac is currently backed up locally by both Time Machine and a bootable backup via Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) to separate disks.  Since I have these set up already, I'd prefer to stick with these options, but am open to suggestions.\nCCC would require partitioning the backup drive into 6 partitions, locking in the amount of data I can backup up for each source.  Time Machine (TM) on a single 8 TB partition would allow the free space to \"float\" to where it is needed as the external drive usage increases. Because of this, I am leaning towards TM vs. CCC simply because of the amount of data to back up.\nBackup Procedure\nI would be storing this 8TB disk offsite and bringing it to my house occasionally.  I would then connect the drive to each computer, let TM do its job, then take the disk off-site again.  I may put a second disk in rotation so that there is never a time when all disks are on-site.  See my answer to a similar question https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/381886/146721 for the details of how the rotation works.\nEncryption\nEncryption is a must since I cannot guarantee the physical security of the offsite drive.  If I go with the TM route for backup, I can encrypt the entire drive with a single password or allow each machine's backup to be encrypted with a separate password.  Since these are family backups, I am not terribly concerned with intra-user security, so I am leaning towards a single encryption password.\nRestoration Scenario\nMy existing in-house backup strategy (TM + CCC) should take care of most mundane restoration situations.  The scenario I am attempting to cover here is complete disaster, such as the house burning to the ground.  In this case, all computers and on-site backups are assumed to be destroyed.  In this scenario, new hardware would have to be purchased and restored from the TM backups\nDoes this seem like a reasonable strategy?\n\nA: I think you're making this too complex.\nThe very first thing you need to do is decide what's more important - an image of your entire system or your data.  For all of the clients I've worked for, data was the most important factor.\nYour settings and applications are important, don't get me wrong, but I'm sure you're much more concerned about your tax documents than you are about your custom shortcuts you've created.\nGiven that your Internet connection is metered, you can still use the cloud, you're just going to use it differently.  Here's what I suggest:\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine\n\n*Cloud Service\n\n*NAS (with USB based backup)\n\nTime Machine.\nUse Time Machine for your whole system backup.  You can rotate disks if you like, but I've found this unnecessary over the last decade.\nCloud Service\nI personally use OneDrive, but this will work well with DropBox or other similar services.  In my Documents folder, I put symlinks to various folders in my OneDrive folder (it's the one that gets synced).  I don't copy over Pictures (they're automatically uploaded from the phone) or Downloads, but you can if you want.\nNAS or Network Attached Storage\nI personally use a Synology NAS with a several USB drives attached to back up the NAS - one for music, another for documents, and one that backs up the whole NAS.  The beauty with a NAS is that all of your Macs can attach the NAS and benefit from it's features.\nNow, here's where the magic happens...  The Synology NAS syncs with OneDrive.  The NAS backs up to at least two places (i.e. Documents and whole system).\nSo, what does this accomplish?  Let's look at that tax document...\nDocument \n  → Backed up via Time Machine\n  → Sync to One Drive\n    → Sync to NAS\n    → Backed up to USB (Documents)\n         → Backed up to USB (Whole NAS)\n\nWith a setup like this, you have your data in 6 different places including off site.  By not backing up your entire system to the cloud, you're minimizing the data transfer as it will only sync the changes not the entire data directory and certainly not the entire drive.\nYou said you had a 100GB data cap on your Internet connection.  Once this is setup, I highly doubt you will transfer 10GB of documents and data per month.  I work from home with three other people in the house and don't hit that level.\nHere's a similar answer where I didn't use OneDrive in the equation.  I backup my VMs to my NAS, but I don't sync them to OneDrive.  What this allowed me to do when my Mac crashed was to bring up my dev servers on an inexpensive Dell running FreeBSD (it could have been Windows) and VirtualBox and get back to work immediately.\nFinally, the NAS setup allows you to centralize all of your backups for Macs because it acts as a Time Machine server, you'll just need to size it appropriately.\n", "Q: Mirror some displays but not others I have my Macbook Pro 13\" (2017) connected to two external 27\" monitors. \nI'm going to be getting a new iPad Pro today and intend to use it with the new sidecar functionality. My goal is to get rid of my 27\" monitors and roll with the Macbook screen + sidecar. But first, I want to make sure everything is working okay with my daily workflow. \nSo, what I am hoping to do is mirror my Mac's screen to one of the 27\" monitors, and the extended sidecar screen to the other 27\" monitor. \nI found these instructions, but they reference using the Alt key to accomplish mirroring some displays but not others. The 2017 MacBook has no Alt key. Are these instructions out of date, or am I just missing something obvious?\n\nA: The Alt key is a Windows term for the alternate function key, in this case macOS calls this the option key, with the symbol ⌥.\nIt sits on most keyboard layouts between the control and command keys to the left of the space bar, and between the arrow keys and the command key on the right of the space bar.\n\n\nNote: On a Windows keyboard connected to a Mac it is likely the Windows key will act as option as these two keys are swapped in most layouts.\n\nI can confirm the steps mentioned do work for mixed mirroring and extending of displays, although I am unsure if this works with Sidecar.\n", "Q: Partition Type: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF appeared when tried to remove Linux(UBUNTU 18.04) from dual boot from Mac I earlier had dual-booted my MacBook Pro(2013), Catalina OS with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

I have an extensive history of SMS messages going back to early 2013. However, it's taking up nearly half of my iPhone's storage space and counting. I understand that there's a feature that automatically deletes old messages after a specified period of time, but I'm somewhat put off by the implication that messages deleted in this way won't be recoverable even from iTunes backups. Frankly, I'm sentimental about this (not to mention that I occasionally need to dredge up years-old messages if discussing an old project). \nMy question is this: is there a way to permanently transfer my huge backlog of text messages onto my Mac, while keeping messages from the last (say) six months on my iPhone for portability's sake? This way, I'd be able to access old messages as needed, while minimizing the amount of iPhone storage space they take up.\nI've tried a few third-party utilities (iExplorer, iMazing), but they don't seem to be able to do this kind of thing specifically. I'm working with an iPhone 5S, 14.91 GB, iOS 12.4.5, and an older MacBook Pro running Sierra. Thanks!\n\nA: Well, if this is not just a spam question for promoting some app then you have not many options without jailbreak I'm afraid. \niOS allows setting the timer to 1 year, so basically making a backup every 6 month and moving it to a safe location on an external drive should allow you to access messages from it with a free version of any backup extractor.\nBut I would still stick to the following flow (should be the easiest and most realistic):\n\n\n*\n\n*Move all old texts in PDF or CSV with iMazing, iExplorer, or any other on your choice (personally prefer iMazing ;) );\n\n*Sort them by folders (Work, Private, etc.);\n\n*Delete texts from your phone, manually or just set expiration to 30 days (1 year if needed);\n\n*Repeat this once a year by adding new conversations to a folder named by year.\n\n", "Q: Installing Python 3.5.6.1: python contains a recursive dependency on itself: I am trying to install Python 3.5.6.1 with:\n$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/f2a764ef944b1080be64bd88dca9a1d80130c558/Formula/python.rb\n$ brew switch python 3.6.5_1\n\nBut this gives the following error:\n==> Consider using `brew extract python ...`!\nThis will extract your desired python version to a stable tap instead of\ninstalling from an unstable URL!\n\n######################################################################## 100.0%\nError: python contains a recursive dependency on itself:\n  python depends on sphinx-doc\n  sphinx-doc depends on python\n\nHow can I install it ? \n\nA: You can download any python version directly from the python website and install it manually.

After installing some other operating system like Linux, I would use some version of the sudo bless --mount command like\n$ sudo bless --mount /Volumes/EFI --setboot --file /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\n\nto make macOS the default boot system again.\nWhile the command still works, I was wondering if the sudo bless --mount command has been deprecated like some articles say it has.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://krypted.com/mac-security/dont-use-bless-to-change-startup-disks-any-more-in-os-x/\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7740130\nIf it has, then what should I be using as a replacement command for making macOS the default boot method again?\n\nA: No.  There is nothing (that I could find) from Apple indicating that bless has been deprecated.\nThe two articles you posted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don’t Use bless To Change Startup Disks Any More In OS X\n\n*Setboot? Formerly bless?

Needless to say, they are woefully out of date.\nThis does serve as a opportunity, however to highlight an important factor:  Apple won't deprecate something (especially as critical as bless) without notifying the public about it (i.e. in the release notes, updated man pages, etc.)\nWhy?

The Dock continues to show the three question mark icons. The apps aren't even on my Mac that I can find so I don't know why the default Dock would even have them.\n\nA: Ther should be a file in ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/either called desktoppicture.db or with a garbled name .db. You can try to delete that file with rm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db and afterwards restart the dock with killall Dock. This should fix the issue, as the com.apple.dock.plist does not contain all the launchpad settings.\n", "Q: iTerm: How to make options (e.g. -r) after filenames work? How can I make iTerm accept options (e.g. -r) after filenames?\nFor example, I often delete folders and forget the -r option.\niTerm will accept rm -r folder but not rm folder -r. Any way to make this work?\nI think I have seen this work on ubuntu.\nI am on macos 10.15.3 with iTerm 3.3.9 and zsh 5.7.1.\n\nA: It's not up to iTerm, it's up to each individual command program (like rm, ls, etc) how to parse its arguments. The traditional convention in unix commands is to require options to come first (before positional parameters), but the GNU project has adopted a convention where they can come in any order (except that -- indicates the end of options). macOS avoids GNU software as much as possible (for licensing reasons), and uses mostly bsd versions of commands... which (mostly) follow the traditional options-first convention.\nYou can install GNU versions of commands if you want (e.g. with homebrew). But there's a problem: because the GNU versions are different, you risk breaking scripts that assume the macOS-standard commands. To avoid this conflict, GNU versions are usually prefixed with \"g\" (e.g. gawk instead of awk), so you'd have to get used to that instead.\nSo, my advice is to get used to putting options first. It's the way most of the commands on macOS work, and if you try to change it you're just going to create other problems.\n", "Q: sudo chown \"Operation not permitted\" - how to resolve permissions to allow chown by admin or root users?

There has been a change in configuration of the network that will require FQDNs. \nRather than recreating all my remote system names (stored in terminal and shown when pressing shift-command-k ) \nCan I edit the stored data to add the domain information to the existing entries?\n\nA: The host names are stored in the Terminal settings .plist  in the users /Library/Preferences folder:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist\n\n\nEdit the .plist\nThe easiest way to edit a batch of these is by editing the plist with a tool like VSCode (free) with the Binary Plist Extension or your favorite text editor with plist support.1  You can also convert the plist to XML (and back to binary) using plutil.2 This will allow you to use any text editor like TextEdit that doesn't natively support plist formats.\nImportant:  I suggest making a backup copy of the plist before you start editing in case you want to revert back to the original.\nYou can find all of your servers in the array under the PermanentServers key as shown below.  Simply go in and fix the FDQN as needed.  If the domain suffixes are all the same, a simple Find/Replace should speed through the task.\n\nSave the file and reload Terminal.  For this example, I added the FQDN .newFQDN to each entry and restarted Terminal.  Here's the result:\n\nAlternate Method using defaults read/write\nYou can get the names of the server with the defaults read command:\n$ defaults read -app Terminal PermanentServers\n\n(\n    \"host1.FQDN\",\n    \"host2.FQDN\",\n    \"host3.FQDN\",\n    \"host4.FQDN\"\n)\n\nYou can set your new servers by overwriting that array with a new one as follows:\n$ defaults write -app Terminal PermanentServers -array '(host1.newFQDN, host2.newFQDN, host3.newFQDN, host4.newFQDN)'\n\nYou can then reissue the defaults read command to check the results.  The upside to this is that you don't need TextWrangler and you can script it.  However, it's difficult to do a large number on the command line so, you'll want to edit it first in a text editor to make sure you have no mistakes.\n\n1 In the first version of this answer, I originally referred to TextWrangler as it was a tool I originally used to view/edit plist files.  However, I've been transitioning to VSCode as it's cross platform - macOS, Windows, and even FreeBSD, I discovered a plist plugin that allowed me to finally get rid of TextWrangler, not that it's \"bad\" in any way; I'm just trying to streamline my dev tools.  \n\n2 To convert a binary plist to XML for editing, issue the command plutil -convert xml1 foobar.plist.  Once you're finished editing, save it then convert it back to binary with the command plutil -convert binary1 foobar.plist\n\n\nA: If all you're worried about is being able to ssh in, you might not need to change how you connect at all.\nYou can make aliases in ~/.ssh/config which refer to other hosts. For example, if you want to be able to do ssh shortie instead of ssh somehostname.plus.fqdn you would use this in ~/.ssh/config:\nHost shortie\n    HostName somehostname.plus.fqdn\n    HostKeyAlias somehostname.plus.fqdn\n\nThe HostKeyAlias tells ssh which hostname to use in ~/.ssh/known_hosts for verifying this connection, so you might want to use the FQDN for that.\nI would try that with one of your hosts and see if it works for you. If it does, editing ~/.ssh/config is certainly the easiest fix, and you can copy it to other computers if you want/need.\nYou can also assign multiple aliases, too.\nThe nice thing about doing this as the ssh level is that it will work for Terminal.app, iTerm, and any other tools that use ssh.\n", "Q: Can we move lines in TextEdit? Using TextEdit is there a key board shortcut to move the current line up/down? (similar to how code editors like Sublime Text works)\n\nA: According to @IconDaemon there is no key combination to do this.

An SMC rest seems to work for a little while, so could it really be a hardware malfunction? And why would I have not seen any symptoms sooner?\nHere's the detailed list of bugs I'm experiencing: \n\n\n*\n\n*The haptic feedback on my trackpad comes and goes. It's working correctly most of the time though.\n\n*Occasionally the mouse cursor will continue to move itself after I stop pushing it, like it was lagging or something.\n\n*Today, for the first time, the cursor was completely unresponsive. Haptic feedback, however, was still happening.\n\n*After rebooting the OS failed to connect to either the keyboard or trackpad.\n\n*There was a slight flickering/shimmering in the lower right corner of the screen that took about 20 seconds to settle down.\n\n*I performed an SMC reset, and everything was back to normal for a couple of hours. But now the mouse cursor and/or haptic feedback is intermittently coming and going again.\n\n\nAny suggestions? I'm quite frustrated at the moment, and worried that something worse is coming down the pike...\n\nA: You have a hardware issue - possibly two - and you should take it in (back) for service.\nThe two issues: flickering on the screen and trackpad/keyboard issues are most likely coincidental and have nothing to do with each other.  Given that you just had it in for service on the screen and it's showing issues, I would've taken it back already.  \nThe SMC reset really has nothing to do with any of this.  The SMC is just Apple's name for the what the rest of the industry calls the PMU or Power Management Unit.  Resetting it just sets the sensors, counters, watchdogs etc. back to \"zero.\"  The SMC just regulates where power goes and how fast to spin fans based on data it gets back from the rest of the system.  \nThe fact that you have intermittent failing haptic feedback, an unresponsive cursor and a failure to connect to either the keyboard/trackpad, indicates there's a hardware issue.\nIf it appears  SMC reset \"fixes\" your problem for a little while but then it returns, there's a good chance there's a power issue like a faulty component (resistor, capacitor, etc.) but in the end, the item needs to be serviced.  Chances are, you'll need a new top case assembly.\n", "Q: How do I sync the Visual Studio Code (vscode) theme to use my OS light/dark color scheme?

I bought the Watch new in November 2018.\nPrior to updating to updating to 6.1.2 (Jan 28, 2020), I had no problems with the battery.  On a typical day using v6.1.1 I would use ~30% by the end of the day.  I use the Watch often and keep it on during exercise and sleep.\nAfter updating to 6.1.2, I noticed my Watch would often lose 50% or more of its charge by the end of the work day.  This would cause me to have to charge it more than once a day, something I've never had to do prior to the upgrade.\nTo troubleshoot the problem, I did a reset and unpaired the Watch from my iPhone.  I set it up as a new Watch (not a restore from my iCloud backup).  Without adding any of my apps back to the Watch, the battery performance was still terrible so it's not an app that's causing the battery drain.\nSimilar problems are reported on this site and the Apple forums.  The only answer provided is to do what I've already done (reset and setup again). \nOn iOS you can see the battery usage of specific apps in Settings.  watchOS doesn't offer this feature, all you can see is storage space and time since last full charge.\nIs there any way to see what's killing my battery?  I have Xcode so I think I can see the device logs but I wouldn't know what to look for.  I'm open to install any apps that would show the same info (I don't want to jailbreak).\nUpdate: Updating to watchOS 6.1.3 hasn't fixed this problem.  It hasn't made the problem worse, which is something, I guess.\n\nA: You can try to log Battery Life using these instructions and this profile - you need an Apple Developer account to do so.\nIt's long to do and you may not get many results (I've never tried with this kind log), but if you have the time to try. If you need help analyzing the results you can post them here.\n\nA: If is checking for heart rate often it will drain your battery in a matter of hours. If you have a watch face that shows the heart rate, that means it will take your heart rate more often than usual.\n", "Q: Can the number given to the Cellular version of the Apple Watch be reached over the PSTN? From previous experience, my understanding is that if a Cellular Apple Watch is purchased and then a plan added to the Watch from a supporting carrier, the watch is given its own mobile number. Can this number be reached via the PSTN, or is it only an identifier that the Watch uses internally and not accessible from the outside?\n\nA: Are you perhaps confusing an eSIM with a telco technology PSTN?\n\n\n*\n\n*An eSIM is an Electronic Subscriber Identity Module.  It's the digital version of the \"old fashioned\" SIM or the plastic card that you put into the phone to get onto the cellular network. It's not tied to a phone number per se.  It's tied to an account that allows you access to the cellular network.  \n\n*The PSTN is the Public Switched Telephone Network. It's the aggregate of all the switched circuit telco systems including cellular.\n\n*A phone number is just a sequence of digits assigned to an account so that another telco device can connect to it.  It's just a \"pointer\" to an account - you dial the digits and the phone company can make a single phone ring or multiple phones around the planet ring simultaneously (and a number of variations in between).\nAs far as how the iWatch's eSIM works, it is attached to your cellular account and for all intents and purposes, shares your existing phone number.  It's not given it's own unique phone number.\nIt's important to note that an eSIM or plain SIM do not have to have a phone number - any mobile hotspot that you can't make calls to won't have a phone number as the plans for these devices are data only.   \n\nA: You can call the Apple Watch using the same phone numbers as your iPhone.

Issue occurs also in safe mode. The OS has been reinstalled 3 times from scratch and the issue persists.\n\nA: Apple's laptops with discrete graphics units do not have a great track record. However, it may be that the OS you updated to has different drivers, or makes more demands on the GPU, which causes some kind of problem (a GPU panic in this case).\nIf one clean install doesn't fix it, then don't do another. You could try reinstalling the previous OS: if everything works, then stay on that OS for the remainder of this laptop's life. If it doesn't, then you know it's not the software, and age or misfortune has caused some hardware problem.\nFixing hardware problems will not be cheap, and I would recommend putting that money towards a newer Mac instead. 8 years is not a bad innings for a laptop.\n", "Q: Water damaged mid 2014 Macbook Pro - SSD question My laptop got wet in my bag, and I want to try to retrieve the data from the hard drive. My old Mac computers used SATA II drives, and I have a cable that can plug right in. \nIs there something similar for this generation Mac? If the SSD isn't damaged, I have some important things on there I need. \nThe model is a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014).\n\nA: Yes, there is.  OWC makes a USB3 to PCIe Enclosure that will allow you to hook your drive up to a USB port so you can mount the drive and copy over your data.  These are a bit pricey (thanks to Apple's proprietary PCIe interface), but even the cheaper no-name ones are only a few dollars less - go with a trusted brand like OWC.\nAnother option, is where ever you take your MacBook to get repaired, they should be able to offer this service to you for free or even for a nominal fee.  Rossman Repair Group has the ability to save your data even if it's one of the SSDs that are soldered to the logic board.  (I'm not affiliated; just a very happy customer). \n", "Q: Does PressAndHold automatically combine region with general language? The .plists in PressAndHold.app for en and en_US have different sets of <key< definitions with no overlap.  Some have a different naming style.  Do they get combined if a US locale is selected?\nOR where is there any Apple documentation to explain the gory details of how this thing works?  (searching developer.apple.com found nothing useful)\nThere are a lot of things here in Apple.SE and elsewhere that talk about specific edits, but I haven't found anything that explains some of the odd differences between the two files.\nThe biggest reason I'm interested is that all the pop-ups I can find a key for are specified as &lt;key&lt;Roman-Accent-[key]&lt;/key&lt; but I'd like to find a way to get the pop-ups specified with UI.\n   <key>UI-Currency-$</key>\n   <dict>\n      <key>Direction</key>\n      <string>right</string>\n      <key>Keycaps</key>\n      <string>$ ¢</string>\n      <key>Strings</key>\n      <string>$ ¢</string>\n   </dict>\n   <key>UI-TopLevelDomain</key>\n   <dict>\n      <key>Direction</key>\n      <string>left</string>\n      <key>Keycaps</key>\n      <string>.com .net .edu .org .us</string>\n      <key>Strings</key>\n      <string>.com .net .edu .org .us</string>\n   </dict>\n\n\nA: I can’t be sure, but I suspect the answer is NO.\nI finally found some pages about how “firmlinks” can be created. One said I would have to specify them in /usr/share/firmlinks. Another said that file is only for directories from Apple and users must specify them in /etc/synthetic.conf.\nNeither method worked, using the syntax in the pages’ examples.\nBut then I learned that the file I should modify is not actually in the read-only area.  So I made the changes I wanted and tried it out.  Didn’t work!\nA little more investigation revealed that Apple put an identical file in the read-only area which overrides the one in the data area.  Copied the one I had edited into the read-only area, and the pop-ups I had added worked.  Unfortunately, the next software update restored the factory default.\n", "Q: Can we override SIP protection with a symlink? Suppose I have a .plist that I cannot edit without disabling SIP.\nCan I disable SIP once, copy the .plist to a rw-r--r-- file in ~,\nreplace the original with a symlink to the copy, re-enable SIP and then be able to update the item whenever I want?\n\nA: Partial answer:  If the symlinked file is one of the PressAndHold plists, it does not work.\nWith `…/Keyboard-en*.plist moved to a subdirectory, and copied to a non-SIP directory, I replaced what was moved-and-copied with symlinks to the copies.  Press And Hold popups were no longer available.  Removing the soft links and copying the originals back up restored the feature without even needing a log-out.\nThe copies linked were root:wheel with mode rw-r--r--, same as the originals.  Changing the link modes to lrw-r--r-- did not restore the feature.  \nAccording to https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/system-integrity-protection-adding-another-layer-to-apples-security-model/ all directory trees protected by SIP are listed in /System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf which does NOT list /System/Library or /System/Library/Input\\ Methods.  Nevertheless, the files I am currently wanting to work on are below /System/Library/Input\\ Methods and are protected. \n\nA: To respond to your example about relocating a file in a SIP-protected area such as /System and replacing it with a symlink to the relocated file: Yes, in principle, that would work — the symlink will be able to be dereferenced and the intended data will be readable from the user-writable target file. However, there is the potential caveat that whatever generates the specific file may just remove your symlink and replace it with a regular file, thereby undoing your efforts, or whatever reads the file may expect a regular file rather than a symlink, thereby impacting functionality.\nTo answer your question directly as you've worded it, however: You wouldn't really be \"overriding\" SIP. The purpose of SIP is to only allow certain tasks to be performed by the kernel, such as writing to certain filesystem locations. By replacing such a file with a symlink to a file that doesn't reside in such a region, you are circumventing the need to be the kernel in order to write data to a place where another process will then read it; but as mentioned before, that process may be designed so that such circumvention doesn't work as you intend.\nUltimately, you should just try it for whatever specific application you're trying to affect and find out the results for yourself.\n", "Q: Where can I find public domain images of the latest Apple products for commercial use? I would like to use the images from Apple websites and don’t know how to contact and get permission to use some images from Apple. \nAre there ways to get written permission to use these images commercially?\n\nA: Generally, you should be able to find Apple product images on the official website along with applicable license and applicable usage guidelines/restrictions. However, they are all copyrighted and trademark protected, so you want a lawyer to advise you and not people on the internet, no matter how reasonable we seem. \nMost comprehensive information is on Apple’s legal page covering Apple Intellectual Property: https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/\nOnce you are set on trademark, copyright and permitted uses, other places to look are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Newsroom Archive: Search for the product announcement news item for the product you are looking for (e.g. here's the link to the news item for the recently announced 16\" MacBook Pro), and you'd find the images made available by Apple.\n\n*App Store Marketing Resources and Identity Guidelines Webpage: You can find the product image templates here, with blank screens. The images can be used as per the terms of license for marketing your own software.\nThe contact information for Apple PR personnel is also generally made available with the Newsroom item. You can also find the relevant contact information on the Apple Contact Us webpage.\n", "Q: macOS/iMac - LG UltraFine controls For seemingly no reason, the macOS hotkey to control the brightness (control + F1/F2) of my LG UltraFine secondary display has stopped working.\nAlso, the Sound Preferences do not show LG UltraFine speakers anymore, so I cannot set the sound output to that display.\nWhen I try to open LG Screen Manager, it quits immediately.\nCan anyone else using LG UltraFine (23.7\" 4K, specifically) confirm facing this issue? Any suggestions on how to fix this?\n\nThis Apple bug/personal oversight has become a nuisance on my home setup. Not only can I not control the display and sound on my UltraFine monitor through the iMac, I am unable to send the sound output from my iPad to the monitor. All this was earlier working without any problem.\nWhen going to Apple > About This Mac > Displays, the UltraFine display shows up, implying that the monitor is being identified. But the sound and brightness controls are not working.\nI have tried three different devices, an iMac, an iPad, a MBP. Neither worked, leading me to believe that the issue is with macOS/iPadOS.\n\nA: Summary\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your device and completely take the plug out of the socket, to kill its power supply;\n\n*Disconnect the power supply of your LG UltraFine monitor as well, by pulling the plug out of socket;\n\n*Reconnect(/Power on) everything after ~15 seconds;\n\n*The controls should come back to life.\n\nFully unplugging resets a few things in the UltraFine monitor as well as in the iMac.\n\nDetailed\nI spoke with Apple Support and the representative tried to help me solve this problem, but to no avail.\nThe only thing that session managed to get done was have my iMac restarted in Safe Mode. It did not solve the problem, but in the process my UltraFine's display's orientation changed. (I use it in portrait; It got reset to landscape.)\nSince it changed something, try that first.\n\nNext, while moving my desk I had to disconnect my UltraFine and iMac. When I plugged them back to another place, I started the iMac first without the display connected to it. Then I plugged in the power cord of UltraFine. And then I plugged the display's cable to iMac.\nI understood that disconnecting an iMac off its power supply for ~15 seconds is how you reset its SMC. I think when I disconnected my machine to move it, I accidentally reset the SMC and that fixed the problem.\n\nA: To restart the brightness controller, in Terminal do sudo killall corebrightnessd (you'll be prompted for your password). Or Force Quit it a couple of times in Activity Monitor, where you can check that it has restarted by looking in \"CPU Time\" column which should now be near zero. \n\nI use an old Apple Cinema Display and have to do this every so often.\n\nFor your other issues, you may wish to re-plug the monitor connection. This range of monitors have known issues with macOS.\n\nA: For my UltraFine 27\", the display brightness stopped working and was not even shown in Display Settings - no slider bar.\nThe only thing I found to work was this custom app:\nhttps://github.com/fnesveda/ExternalDisplayBrightness\nIt worked for me anyways!\n", "Q: I just changed my single user home directory to \"/\", can I return back? While deleting another user account on System Preferences, I changed the home directory for the primary user (System Preferences>Users and Groups>Users>Advanced Settings) to \"/\", because I already have done in the past two partitions of the same disk for two users, to separate applications and documents for both users, then I updated the second user to Catalina, and I moved both users to only one partition. Now after deleting the other user account (older version) while moving the applications back to the other partition applications folder and setting up the home directory to the actual partition (system preferences>user advanced settings) I realized that the apps I been recently moving to the dock didn't show-up (it was routed to the other partition I guess), so Instead of routing the home directory of the user to the actual partition I choosed \"/\" thinking that the directory routing flow could be actualized by the computer, instead of realizing that in this way the user was left out of both partitions.\n\n\nA: Unless you have very specific technical reasons for doing so, then modifying MacOS's installation is unnecessary and may cause problems. There's no need to make separate partitions for users, or to move the default location of User accounts. \nAs you have found out, the root level is read only in Catalina, and any non-OS files and folders will be moved to /Users/Shared when the OS is installed. \nIf I were you, I would backup your data, boot to Recovery, remove any partitions, reinstall the OS, create a new user account, and then restore your data and apps to the correct intended locations. \n", "Q: How can I find the source of a Mac desktop notification? I installed a trial software, NTFS for Mac, and then uninstalled it (via AppZapper). However, I am still getting occasional desktop notifications and I don't know how to get rid of these. Any suggestions?\nThanks\nOren\n\nA: I may have found the solution, which involves manually deleting a record from an SQL database.\nUsing Ralf Westphal's answer here and Oscar Zhang's answer here to solve my issue by editing the db file in the db2 folder. I found the app_id in the app table and then deleted it (which causes the 'app_deleted' trigger to delete the app from all the other tables). This is for Mojave. I used an SQLite editor for this (DB Browser for SQLite].\nI will have to wait a while to confirm this works.\n", "Q: How to make ''sudo launchctl limit' change permanent? I have a background job that failed due to too many open files error.\nTo fix it, I  have to kill the job, then run the following\nsudo launchctl limit maxfiles 10240 10240\n\nbefore restarting it.\nIs there any way I can make the launchctl limit maxfiles change permanent?\n\nA: You can create a launch daemon to run that command on every startup. Create /Library/LaunchDaemons/private.maxfiles.plist with the following contents:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>private.maxfiles</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>launchctl</string>\n            <string>limit</string>\n            <string>maxfiles</string>\n            <string>10240</string>\n            <string>10240</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <true/>\n    </dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: Launchd has two keys — HardResourceLimits and SoftResourceLimits —  that can be used to place limits on the resources of jobs. They take a dictionary of integers, so you can add something like the following to your launchd plist to get a permanent solution:\n<key>HardResourceLimits</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>NumberOfFiles</key>\n    <integer>500</integer>\n</dict>\n\nThis should cap out the number of files that process has open at 500. \nI'm not really certain what the difference between 'soft' and 'hard' limits are, though the man page for launchd.plist says (cryptically):\n\nNumberOfFiles \nThe maximum number of open files for this process.  Setting this value\n  in a system wide daemon will set the sysctl(3) kern.maxfiles\n  (SoftResourceLimits) or kern.maxfilesperproc (HardResourceLimits)\n  value in addition to the setrlimit(2) values.\n\nsysctl(3) has no man page on my machine, and it's too early in the morning for me to go do a google search. I'll suggest, though, that what you're really looking at is a coding error, and you should fix this in the daemon, not rely on launchd. launchd likes to have flexible control over things, and would rather that users avoid dictating too much.\n", "Q: A single keyboard shortcut to toggle between different shortcuts I'll start from my end goal so it will be clearer - I have a mouse with buttons that can be assigned to output keyboard shortcuts.

This is a question about after installing more than one version of macOS in a dual/multi-boot scenario, all installed in the same APFS container/partition.\nIn the answer to APFS - Is it possible to install 2 macOS versions inside one APFS container? by @\"David Anderson\" there is a comment that states:\n\nI can boot to one of the three macOS Recoveries stored on disk2s3 by holding down the ⌘+R key combination at startup. If the default startup disk is a APFS volume containing macOS, then the corresponding macOS recovery will startup. For example, if the startup disk is set to the APFS volume Machintosh HD 2, then holding down the ⌘+R key combination at startup will result in the Mac booting to High Sierra macOS Recovery on APFS Volume My Recovery.\nNote: macOS Recovery no longer appears in the Mac Startup Manager. However, macOS Recovery, for a given macOS installation, can be booted using the rEFInd Boot Manager.\n\nThe question is how can you be sure which Recovery actually boots up? Is there a way to tell them apart to confirm you are in the desired Recovery tool actually corresponding to the current default startup volume (without having to resort to using rEFInd to select the desired one)?\n(context is High Sierra and Mojave...not sure if this can apply to Catalina)\n\nA: This is 2013 iMac with High Sierra and Catalina installed in the same APFS container.

It wants to update you from what you have to what's current, and it doesn't show other updates that might have happened in between.\nIf you want to download past versions of Xcode, you should go to Apple's developer site, where every version of Xcode since version 3.0 in 2007 is available.

I recently updated to macOS Catalina (10.15.3), and the \"volume adjust\" bezel that pops up in the center of my screen when I adjust the volume via touch bar no longer looks correct.  Specifically, it is missing the ticks that demarcate the volume level, instead just showing an empty bar.  Other similar bezels (e.g., display brightness) have the same issue.\nI have already tried restarting, as well as disabling the bezels entirely and then re-enabling them.  Any other ideas how to fix this?\n\n\nA: I think we're facing similar issues.

(Has weird icon) Anyone recognize icon on the App Store download dialog in inline pic below? \nOn macOS Catalina, I am regularly getting a pop-up requesting I enter my Apple ID and password to download from the App Store.  But I'm concerned because the password prompt dialog doesn't have the App Store app icon, and I don't recognize the icon showing in the upper-left corner of dialog. \nI can't think of any other app that might legitimately request the password. When I click the dialog title bar, the foremost running app does not change in the title bar. For example, if it was \"Finder\" was the forefront app, the menu bar still says \"Finder\" when I click the dialog title bar, and Safari is the forefront app, the menubar still stays Safari.  \nI tried googling around for images to discover what the Catalina pop-up should look like but I can't find corroborating pics or evidence, and couldn't get a visual conformation. I did notice on older macOS releases that the App Store app icon (the blue icon that looks like an \"A\") appears in the App Store password prompt dialogs, so not sure why that would change. So this has raised my suspicions.\n\n\nA: The icon is for \"Paste - Clipboard Manager\". \nI would open the App Store app separate and check the \"Updates\" tab and the account tab to see if you have indeed requested the download of that app yourself.\n", "Q: Mac - Output different audio streams to two separate devices On MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6, I want to output two separate Chrome browser tab applications to two separate devices from my single macbook pro.\n1) Chrome tab 1: browser game --> outputs to headphones\n2) Chrome tab 2: youtube video --> outputs to HDMI-connected TV audio\nI'm struggling to set this up in AudioMIDI setup.\nTo set up the input, which is the logitech headset microhpone, I set the aggregate device as input:\n\nAnd the display port (TV via HDMI) and Headset as output in the Multi-output Device:\n\nThe problem is, the same audio streams are aggregated from all sources (youtube video, and browser game) to output to both the TV and headset.\nWhat I need is two separate audio streams going to two separate devices.\n\nA: I wrote all this before realising you want two routings from one app - that's not going to be possible.

There is a more complex/expensive one which can also record any sound source to disk as well, called Audio Hijack - $70.\nSoundSource can do all you asked & more.\nThere is a late third - Boom2 & the newer Boom3D - but it's a notorious crasher & speaker destroyer unless you switch off everything except the routing [judging by the many questions we've seen in here about it.

Does anybody know how to help with this?\n\nA: That is a strange, because pressing the return button in Messages on macOS 10.14.6 sends the message as you expected it to do. \nAre you using the return key on a numeric keypad? That might be the reason? \nThe other option is to press ⌘+return which should send the message. Other than that, you can try signing in and out of Messages app on the Mac, and ensure message forwarding is enabled in the iPhone's messaging settings. I'll keep you posted if I find out any other setting to change it. \nEdit\nI just found that you can potentially make the return key act as send message by creating an app specific shortcut in Keyboard Settings. I'm not 100% sure it will work but give it a try?\nGo to System Preferences->Keyboard->Shortcuts->App Shortcuts then add a new shortcut and select the Messages App from the Application Dropdown menu. Enter the exact menu command name Send Message. Now in the keyboard shortcut box it won't let you just press the return key, so you will need to press fn+return but it should display just return in the box. \nNow go back to the Messages app and see if it will require you to press the fn key before pressing return or without the fn key?

Is it possible to use as an external monitor 2013 iMac 21.5 late edition from MacBook Pro 2015 Early Edition?\n\nA: Yes. You will need a Thunderbolt 2 cable. You will also need a keyboard and/or mouse for the 2013 iMac. This is required so you can enter the Command + F2 key combination to put the iMac is target display mode. Also, you will have to have installed a version for MacOS on the iMac that works with target display mode. Basically, High Sierra or an earlier version of macOS compatible with the the 2013 iMac. The 2015 MacBook Pro can have macOS unto the current version (Cataline) installed.\nNote: It is possible to install a AppleScript application on the MacBook Pro, that will eliminate the need for the keyboard and/or mouse to be connected to the iMac. Basically, the AppleScript sends the Command + F2 key combination to the iMac over the Thunderbolt 2 cable.\nOne possible source for a Thunderbolt 2 cable is OWC.\n", "Q: What's causing inadvertent \"leave page\" commands when typing in browser window? An annoying thing mostly, but occasionally results in data loss. It happens when I am typing - as I am now - in a browser window in Firefox on my MacBook Pro (2016, Mojave 10.14.6). \nWhen I'm typing on a SE site, I get a warning, asking for confirmation that I want to leave the page: \n\nThis is the same warning you'll get if you hit the \"Back\" button in Firefox after typing in a form that you've not yet posted. If I get the warning, obviously I select Stay on Page, and return to my work. But sometimes, I don't get the warning (or it happens in a flash); this is when I lose my data. The tab I'm typing in 'backs up' to the previous page instantly. When I go forward, the work/data I've entered is gone. \nI've checked my touchpad settings & find nothing other than Swipe between pages that seems suspect. I disabled Swipe between pages over a year ago with no apparent effect. \nFirefox also has some built-in shortcuts, but they don't look like suspects either: \n\nI'm not a touch typist. The heels of my hands rest on either side of the touchpad while typing. I don't believe I am accidentally typing command + ←. \nWhat is causing this? More importantly, how do I stop it? Is there any way to recover the data, or is it truly \"lost\"?\n\nA: It's been nearly 2.5 years since I asked this question, and I have just now found the answer.\nThe \"culprit\" was the Touch Bar - more specifically, the setting on my touch bar. And full disclosure: this probably has something to do with my awful 4-finger typing style (evolved from 2-finger).\nI never use the Touch Bar, except to change display & keyboard lighting. I never pay attention to it as I've long-regarded it as brain~dead masquerding as innovation. But I finally noticed that there was an odd array of controls displayed while typing in a comment box on SE, and the control on the left looked like this: <; i.e. the browser's \"back button\". The ring finger on my left hand will brush against this control occasionally, and I am suddenly on the previous (or 2-5 previous) pages.\nOne \"solution\" is illustrated in the ss below: From the System Preferences Panel, Keyboard widget, change the Touch Bar Display from App Controls to Fn Controls. A far better solution IMHO is to disable the Touch Bar entirely, but unfortunately - as with Siri - Apple refuses their customers the ability to disable their skanky innovations :P\n\n", "Q: How does Google now I'm subscribe to Hulu? New level of Google creepy for me. Was searching a show and somehow it knew I'm subscribed to Hulu. Check out the pic. It says subscribed under Hulu. I have no idea how I've never used Hulu on my phone or on chrome browser.!\n\nA: Probably because you signed into Hulu using a Gmail, or more likely Google found some connection between your Google account and Hulu account, because finding things are what they do for a business (totally not because of  some backdoor stuff that we are not supposed to know).

The photo is gone from my devices, but the created link still shows the photo.\n\nA: If you shared the picture in an album (Photo Stream), you can learn how to do it here.\nIf you shared the picture alone (by clicking \"Copy iCloud link\"), you have to :\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the link on a computer, while logged in to the iCloud account from which the image was shared. \n\n\nFor example https://www.icloud.com/photos/#XXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXX\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the three dots (upper right) > Stop sharing \n\n\n\nNote that every picture will expire 30 days after being shared. Also, if someone made an offline copy of the photo and/or saved it to their library, removing the share link does not claw that copy back - it only prevents new viewing. \n", "Q: What cables do I need to power 2 external displays? I have a late 2015 macbook pro and 2 external monitors. The monitors have usb-c input. Is it possible to use my monitor to power my laptop with a usb-c to thunderbolt 2 cable? If not, what is the most efficient way to power 2 external displays?\n\nA: Your MBP is a 2015 model, which means it only uses the MagSafe 2 connector for power. It does not have USB-C and can't take power in over Thunderbolt from the monitors (assuming that they can supply power out via USB-C, which is not known at this point).\nHowever, your question is how to power the displays. You'll need to read the manual to see what power inputs they have. I think it's unlikely that they take power in over USB.\nIf you want to know how to connect both displays to the Mac: your Mac seems to support 2 displays via Thunderbolt only. So don't use the HDMI port: get a Thunderbolt 2 to USB-C cable/adaptor (or other port on your display).\n", "Q: Access iCloud on my Mac without my phone? I left my phone at home, I'm on my Mac.

This ends up being extremely annoying. I unlock the phone, set it on the table, hands are mostly full, screen fades out, I spring to touch the screen but am 0.00001 seconds late. Phone is now locked and I have to put the stuff I'm holding down and physically pick up the phone so that it can see my face just to continue what I was doing.\nSimilar annoyances happen when wearing a face mask either beacuse it's cold or to avoid spreading/catching a cold (I live in Japan where face masks are common). Mask needs to be off to unlock with Face Id, if the phone locks there's no buffer off a few moments before I have to either take off the mask or else type in the code. Have this happen a few times in a row and I'm ready to smash the phone into a million pieces.\nIs there a way to set a 1-5 second delay until the phone actually locks after the screen fads out or even accidentally tapping the side button? Touch Id had (has?) an option to keep the phone unlocked for a brief amount of time which was so much more user friendly in this area. Does the same option exist for Face Id?\n\nA: In the Face ID & Passcode settings, you could set it to lock after 1, 5, 15 minutes or 1, 4 hours after the screen goes black. \nAdditionally, you should be able to create an alternative appearance for Face ID to include your Face when you have your mask on? I've set 2 appearances, one with glasses and one without. You may have to reset the Face ID to set up additional appearances though. \nHope this helps.\nEdit\nHere's the screenshots in the Face ID & Passcode settings where you can set the time it locks after the screen goes black.\n\n\n", "Q: How to prevent the keyboard layout from changing?

I was wondering if it delete’s all the photo’s from my photo’s or just the old pictures that aren’t in my photo’s that are saved in ICloud? Turning on the disable and delete option fixed the problem but i stressed myself out about it and i’m just stressed at the moment cuz i dont want to lose all my photo’s (i use an Ipad)\n\nA: Welcome to AskDifferent!\n\"Disable & Delete\" deletes only the photos and videos on iCloud. However, you would lose the originals of your photos and videos if \"Optimize iPad Storage\" were selected instead of \"Download and Keep Originals\" in your iPad's “Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Photos” settings prior to your selecting \"Disable & Delete\". \nIn addition, if your iPad has had little free storage left recently and \"Optimize iPad Storage\" were selected instead of \"Download and Keep Originals\", then you might also have lost some of the photos and videos you have been accessing the least in addition to originals of all your photos and videos. The number of photos and videos you might have lost in such a scenario (in addition to all of the originals of all photos and videos) would depend on how little free storage your iPad has had (if that were the case) recently.  \nIn summary, if “Download and Keep Originals” were selected in your iPad's “Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Photos” settings prior to your selecting “Disable & Delete” (and you have had no trouble with the storage space on your iPad recently), you should not have lost anything at all. However, if “Optimize iPad Storage” were selected prior to “Disable & Delete”, it depends.

I was opening a document on my computer and double tapped the file below it; A (more than probable, malicious) Skype.dmg file, likely downloaded from a popup.

Are you instead running Mountain Lion or older then you could have been automatically infected, as these versions did indeed have a problem with DMGs being able to auto-start programs.\nBitDefender, like any other product, can only alert about so many types of malware. It is not a guarantee that it will alert against this specific type of malware/virus, if it is indeed malicious.\nThe reason I write \"ordinarily\" and \"normally\" above is that there's a very slight risk that the file has exploited a problem with the metadata parsing that macOS does of the DMG. I.e. macOS uses information from within the DMG to display images, potentially display license information, etc. It is possible for malware to exploit a security hole within the image decoding library for example to infect your computer just by double-clicking the DMG. However, this seems to be quite unlikely given the information you have presented.\nIf you want to be really sure what happened, I would suggest comparing the most recent backup from before you downloaded the DMG with the backup taken just after. If no system files have been altered during that time frame, you should be good.\n", "Q: Is it possible to schedule send an email using the default Mail OS app? Most of the questions here are asked for the OS 2016 and before.

You can check what numbers or email addresses she can use in Settings > Messages > Send & Receive.\n\n*Check your wife's mobile data connectivity/data roaming. She won't be able to access iMessage if she has no internet.

Disk File system is OK.  I can open the files (Canon raw images) from the HDD using applications on the Mac so the Mac talks to the HDD.  \nCopy files with Finder to the Mac HDD fails silently. No copy dialogue - filenames appear in destination folder initially showing file-sizes but they are zero byte.  \nI can copy these same files with Finder from the external HDD to an attached Pen Drive and then copy from the Pen Drive to the Mac HDD but I cannot copy directly from the external HDD to the Mac hard drive.  \nI am using an up-to-date Catalina and up-to-date Paragon NTFS - but that should not be needed to read NTFS. Machine is a late 2012 iMac. Tried multiple remounts (physical disconnection) HDD and restarted iMac. \nIn hours of searching I have only found one near identical report of this behaviour - on here asked March 28 2013.  \nMy workaround using a second connected disk and copying twice works but I am mystified. No permission errors. As well as running Time Machine I have always kept a manual backup of my photos to an external HDD. I use NTFS and Paragon because I was using a PC before I switched to Mac.  \n\nA: I've just been experiencing the same issue you're describing here and have a couple of workarounds that might be useful.\nOption 1\nUse the command line, the cp command seems to copy the files over just fine.\nOption 2\nMount the drive in read-only mode. This is an option within the paragon NTFS for Mac application. After you've connected the drive and it shows up in the application you can opt to mount it in read-only mode.\nYou will have to re-mount the drive after for the change to take effect, this can be easily done using the unmount and mount buttons in the app. You won't, of course, be able to make any changes to any of the files in this mode.\n", "Q: “Memory Trace Upload was successful” message randomly appeared on iPhone While in the Facebook app, a grey box with light grey text appeared randomly at the top of the screen, saying “Memory Trace Upload was successful”. I don’t have a jail broken iPhone and did not do anything to ‘ask’ for a memory trace to be uploaded.\n\nIf it’s a standard debugging thing, how do I turn off this level of access for app developers and/or Apple?\n\nA: Apple and iOS do not have that as a standard dialog or feature - Apple crash reports and memory traces are logged and controlled much differently than how the Facebook App is designed. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202100\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/414/\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2151/_index.html\nApart from the link above on whether you have Apple share analytics you report back to the developer, you can inspect your iOS device in settings to see what the Facebook app is logging to Apple and possibly through them to Facebook when you opt in to Apple’s analytics sharing process. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.omnigroup.com/ios-crash-log/\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.app.\n\n*Tap Privacy, then scroll down and tap Analytics.\n\n*Tap Analytics Data.\n\n*Locate the log for the app that crashed. The filename will use this format: <AppName>_<DateTime>_<DeviceName>\n\n*Tap the crash log to open it.\n\n\n\nAssuming you have discovered this message is in-app diagnostics and not iOS / Apple diagnostics and opting out from Apple collection, uninstall the Facebook app as a quick fix to remove the memory upload message that it is sharing with users when it it letting you know a trace has left your device. \nYou would of course need to use Safari to access your feed until the app developer either explains to you why they are letting you know a trace is uploaded or opt out of analytic / memory trace collection within the Facebook app. \n", "Q: Audio echoes for a few seconds Every so often, sometimes once a day, sometimes two or three times in ten minutes, my audio will reverb at 100% for about 3 seconds. It's very random, with no clues it's about to happen.\nThis has happened while watching youtube, while using Reason, and while using Logic Pro X, so I don't think it's the applications. It didn't start until Catalina.\nThe system, an iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014), is running macOS 10.15.3, the sound is going through a Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 (first edition), which I've been using for years now with little problem. I don't have any other devices, virtual or physical. All inputs and outputs go through the focusrite, and the microphone is selected off, and nothing is registering on meters.\nDoes anyone have any insights? It's not the end of the world, but it certainly is annoying.\n\nA: The tool I would start with is MicroSnitch if no one has a hunch or guess what would enable intermittent sound input. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://obdev.at/products/microsnitch/index.html (Free trial and more details here)\n\n\nAnother thing that's quick to check is Siri. That could trigger a short and intermittent mic active event (and doesn't show in the Microphone section/tab of Security & Privacy). Other apps should show in system preferences for all other apps entitled to mic input before you redo or tear down the main sound processing setup. \n\n", "Q: Is it possible to download an app and install it on iPhone/iPad by using Finder Actually, after updating to Catalina iTunes is divided into Music macOS application and Finder abilities. So for backup and etc, we should use Finder, now I want to know:\nIs it possible to download an app from App Store and install it on iPhone/iPad by using Finder?\n\nA: No.\nFirstly, you can't access the iOS App Store on MacOS, so you can't download iOS apps onto your Mac. You can of course download apps from the Mac App Store, but they won't work on iOS.\nSecondly, there's no general mechanism to 'side-load' apps onto iOS (well, there might be, but not without jail-breaking your iPad). \nThere may be methods that require the co-operation of the developer, or Enterprise device management tools.\n\nA: If you send your iOS device’s UUID to an app’s developer, and they send you an Ad Hoc signed version of the app, then you can install that version of the app on that device via drag-and-drop using the Finder.\nIf you install (or update) an app on the iOS device using Apple’s Configurator 2, and keep a copy of that app before it is auto-deleted from your Mac, then you can (re)install that app on that device via Finder drag and drop.\nThe Finder alone has no connection to Apple’s iOS App Store (AFAIK). So, strictly, using the macOS Finder only, on Catalina, no.\n", "Q: Re-mapping tilde ~ to escape with hidutil, hex code is wrong on technical note?

From what I can tell, this is a Safari feature and is not a part of the webpage.\n\n\nIs there anyway to disable this? I have all Safari autofill settings turned off as I use a third-party password manager. It is super annoying to wait several seconds for this window to be displayed and then have to click \"cancel\" before I can log in. \nEDIT\nIt appears there is no way to disable this behavior. I have opened an issue in Feedback Assistant (FB7582188). Feel free to dupe it. https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5003428010917888\n\nA: This is a new feature with safari on macOS and Catalina when you are signed in to your iCloud / AppleID on trusted and keychain synchronized devices when communicating to some Apple secure services online. \nYour local admin password unlocks they key store and sends a secure token rather than your iCloud password to authenticate you through Safari to Apple’s web site. \nWays to opt out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of iCloud on that Mac. \n\n*Use a different browser. \n\n", "Q: Booting to Recovery Mode won't work anymore I have an upgraded MacPro 5.1. I recently installed Catalina and had to use a patch from dosdude.\nI had to disable SIP using crsutil disable command. I successfully installed macOS Catalina and the system runs great.\nSince I did this I am having problems getting back in to Recovery Mode using the usual boot shortcut ⌘ CommandR key combo.\nI have an RTX 580 graphics card in though. I don’t see the full boot screen but I am pressing both keys as soon as I hear the boot chime. Can anyone offer any advice?\n\nA: On Dosdudes's website, they make a note that if you use APFS, you will not have a bootable Recovery partition:\n\n\n\n*Select the disk or partition you want to install on, and erase it, ensuring to use either Mac OS Extended (Journaled), or APFS as the filesystem type. If formatting an entire drive, ensure GUID is selected.\n-- Please note that if you use APFS, you will not have a bootable Recovery partition.\n\nEmphasis mine\nGranted, the install document is from the \"High Sierra\" page, but APFS implementation between High Sierra and Catalina isn't so different that Recovery will work in one and not the other.\nAs for your graphics card, I highly suggest flashing (IMO, this should have been done prior to installing your Catalina patch so you could diagnose issue if/when they arose).  See this answer for some links on how to do this procedure.\nIf you need a Recovery Partition, try Internet Recovery or boot from a USB installer.\n\nA: If you are looking for a way to enable or disable SIP, then you could try installing rEFInd to boot from the EFI/boot folder in the EFI partition. (Basically, include the --usedefault option when issuing the refind-install command.) You can then select to boot rEFInd from the Startup Menu. The rEFInd Boot Manager has options to enable/disable SIP and to run the gdisk partitioning tool. The rEFInd Boot Manager also has a driver which allows rEFInd to access APFS formatted partitions for the purpose of booting both macOS and macOS recovery. However, I do not know if this would be compatible with modifications made by the patches.\n\nA: I have Catalina on a Mac Pro 5,1 and Recovery mode works fine.\nI do have an EFI enabled video card, you could try booting into recovery using stock GPU. Another thing is if you are using a wireless keyboard, you have to press command + R after the chime, or it won't work.\n\nA: #2\n\nI have found a solution, a dumb solution, but a solution.

I tried to power off the MacBook by holding down the touch ID/power button but that doesn't work.\nI also let the battery run out hoping that that would power down the machine but it appears to only go to sleep.\nSo how can I fix finder on this new touch ID MacBook pro that I can't seem to shutdown.\n..and of course I can't shut it down via the apple logo in the upper left.\n\nA: When you relaunch Finder, are you doing this from the Force Quit Applications menu? If you haven't done this, try pressing command+option+esc keys and the Force Quit Applications menu should pop up, then relaunch Finder from there.\nIf this fails, you can also try force a reboot by pressing Control+Command+Touch ID/Power button keys.\nIf this also fails, and you have access to Spotlight, search for the Terminal app. Once in Terminal, you can force a reboot by typing sudo reboot. It will prompt you with your password, but it won't show in the terminal window as you type it. Just hit the return key when you've finished typing your password and it should force your MacBook to reboot. \nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Is it possible to set a different ringtone for each line of a dual SIM iPhone? I have an iPhone 11 with a nano-SIM and an e-SIM. I've searched the internet but haven't found anything yet. I didn't see any setting about it, and it would seem normal to me to have two different ringtones - one for work and one for personal calls.\nIs it possible to have a different ringtone for the two phone lines that I have?\n\nA: This is currently not supported in iOS 13, as an alternative, if you call a contact primarily through a specific SIM, you can set that contact a specific ringtone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to contacts\n\n*Go to the contact\n\n*Click Edit\n\n*Choose the ring tone\nAt the moment no alternative solution exists.\n\nA: It is currently not possible to have two SIMs active at the same time.

However, after doing that I found out that my disk is kind of unusable. I couldn't format it nor could I erase it since it would give me the error\nError: -69888: Couldn't unmount disk\n\nBelow is the information of my usb drive right now, what should I do to make this usb usable again?\n\nA: You needed to recreate a filesystem. You tried diskutil eraseVolume disk2 but this is invalid. See man diskutil or diskutil eraseVolume --help for details.\nFirstly you need to tell diskutil what filesystem (if any) to use and secondly while in some odd cases (RAID for example) you create a filesystem on the whole physical disk normally it is on the partition. From your picture disk2 is the physical disk and disk2s2 is the partition so you want something like this:\ndiskutil eraseVolume JHFS+ WhateverName disk2s2 where :\n\n*\n\n*JHFS+ is the filesystem you want (in this case journalled HFS+).  Valid values can be seen by entering diskutil listFilesystems but from your picture it seems you had a HFS filesystem before.\n\n*WhateverName is the volume name you want (can be any valid characters, quoted if necessary)\n\n*disk2s2 is the partition you want to create the filesystem on.\n\n\nWhat probably happened\nFrom your picture disk2 is your physical USB drive.  When you format a drive in Disk Utility macOS creates a small file called a partition table at the start (and if a GPT disk the end) of the disk.  This file holds information showing where partitions are on the disk and their type.  It will then normally create a small (invisible) 200MiB EFI partition (disk2s1) followed by one or more other partitions (disk2s2, disk2s3 etc) that you request.\nIn your case the second partition was a 256GB HFS partition.  This was probably journalled HFS as it is the default, but not necessarily - the filesystem type code AF00 doesn't distinguish journalling.  You can see from this support doc Apple recommends it in many cases.\nWhen you started writing zeros to disk2s2 it destroyed the filesystem by overwriting it with zeros.  The partition table entry showing the start, end and type (AF00) remained.  Therefore creating a filesystem in the partition fixed it.\n\nNote on cleaning\nOverwriting 7 times with zeros is a massive overkill.  Once is enough and more than that is a waste of time.\nSee this stackoverflow question: How does a 7- or 35-pass erase work? Why would one use these methods?\nor this askubuntu question: Possibility of recovering files from a dd zero-filled hard disk\n\nA: I had a similar issue myself. In the tickets I read, they all resulted in someone saying to force quit and the hardware being damaged.\nThe resource lx07 referenced, man diskutil, was very useful, particularly  in troubleshooting the damaged hardware. The most effective solution I found was diskutil zeroDisk [device] (note that devices with a space in the name require \\ to be placed before the space, to be recognized), which– unlike the Disk Utility GUI– shows the progress toward completion in a percentage with a simulated spinning motion (cycling – \\ | / pattern) to indicate activity, as well as an estimated time remaining.\n", "Q: Etrecheck says performance is poor. Any way to find out whats wrong? My 10-year-old iMac, running High Sierra, has been beach balling a lot while using Safari and other applications. I ran Etrecheck on my computer and it said my performance was poor. When I look up what that meant it gave me the following:\n\nPoor: Your machine is critically sick. You should make a backup or\n  otherwise save critical documents immediately. Your machine likely\n  needs hardware repair.\n\nI have run it several times and keep getting performance is poor. Is Etrecheck considered good and if so, is there any way to tell what in particular it was referring to\n\nA: Etrecheck is usually pretty reliable.\nYour iMac is running on one of the latest software versions on a 10 year-old machine. \nYour iMac is too old to handle the latest software and to support peak performance therefore Etrecheck is displaying that message.\nIf you can I recommend downgrading your OS to an older version, one that your iMac can handle better. You can see how to downgrade in this article. \nIf you don’t want to downgrade I still recommend creating a backup for your files. \nAn additional test you can run is an Apple Hardware Test, by holding the D key on startup which might detect any other issues.\n", "Q: Is it worth upgrading Macbook mid 2010 I own a Macbook Pro Mid 2010 (Macbook 7,1) which has gone through several upgrades. Before any of the upgrades, the CPU fan was constantly noisy whenever running any application, making it impossible to use. You would need to close all other applications just to make it possible to do a video call, and it still lagged even after that.\nI have done the following upgrades so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*early 2013: added 2GB RAM (4GB + 2GB = 6GB), at the time, this was the maximum, installing 4GB + 4GB didn't work for me\n\n*early 2015: replaced the hard drive with SSD 256GB\n\n*replaced battery and MagSafe\n\n\nAfter each upgrade, it has always worked a bit better, but only until the next OSX version came out and then it would become impossible to use again. I purchased a desktop PC in early 2016 and hasn't been using the Macbook since then. \nRecently I found out that OWC has tested that Macbook mid 2010 would work with 16GB, it gave me an idea to try another upgrade. I've always loved my Macbook and hate to leave it collecting dust in the cabinet or even toss it. I'm just not sure if it worths to spend another 100euro just to find out that the whole thing is just not good enough anymore for the current software, regardless of the 16GB. Obviously the bottleneck would be the Core2duo processor which you can't really do anything about it. \nSo what do you think? Anyone did the same upgrade, can you share if it gave the MacBook a new life?\n\nA: In the corner of the world where I live there are still plenty of MacBooks Pro 2010 in circulation. But you have already done the main upgrade that I do for my clients: swapped the spinning HD with an SSD.\nI get the impression that you really want there to be a path to a good upgrade. But the reality is as you say that it has a C2D CPU which just doesn't cut it anymore.\nAlso it can only run macOS 10.13.6 max, so software wise it will always be stuck in 2017, and apps and upgrades will slowly leave it in the dust.\nI do not personally think it is wort spending much more money on. But, it has a SSD and therefore it should run reasonably ok as it is. Its 6GB of RAM isn't hopelessly little, especially not if you keep at least 20GB free on the SSD so it can swap nicely (it's an SSD, so the swapping will be quite snappy). \nIts loud fans do not jive with my experience of everyday use though. Why don't you, if you want to give it another look, try to address just that. I would do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall it cleanly with macOS 10.13.6, making sure you leave any old OS cruft out of the installation. Note that if it currenlty has a\nvery old version of macOS, you might have to two-step it through\n  10.11, as it is sometimes impossible to upgrade direclty to 10.13. Also note that you might have to backdate the Mac's clock a few years\nwhile the installation is ongoing to allow it. \n\n*Open it, check for dust in the fan duct and remove and reapply the thermal grease between CPU and heat sink.\nAnd then in use, make sure you keep at least 20GB free on the SSD so you keep macOS happy and non space-constrained\n", "Q: deleted the backups folder from time machine \nI recently deleted the backups folder from my time machine. Before realizing what may be the problem I tried deleting the stick files from my trash with a number of methods like rf -Rm, sudo, trash it!, And a few others. \nNone of these worked. I think it might have to do with the backups folder being in the trash. I can't seem to recover the folder from the trash so I'm in a bind. I need hard drive space for the work I'm trying to do and cannot get this stuff out of my trash. \nPlease help, someone! \n\nA: I had this problem, in my case I simply dismounted the backup drive. Apparently although these appear to be in the trash they are still connected to the drive (at least that is how I understand it) I needed a new backup drive anyway so just replaced it.

The dimensions that get reported back (for example 2650x1400) are still reported back.  It has no idea it's now only (making up a resolution here) 2300x1400.  And even if you were able to tell the driver that was your resolution, it would be centered, not shifted left/right.\nYour best bet is, if you must use the machine until you can take it in, to get an external monitor.  They're inexpensive and fairly reliable. Also, an iPad, iPhone, Windows, Unix or Mac computer can screen share very well using several apps.\nThere’s no harm in running a Mac with this display damage and using another display - especially if it’s stationary or running closed clamshell.\n", "Q: Can I preview iPhone photos on my MacBook display before actually importing?

I can't seem to find any reference to this scenario. I have the iPhone wiped, updated, and set-up with a new apple ID. But I would prefer not to activate it as that would require a dedicated plan. I use an Android phone. The iPhone is a device that my wife has abandoned that I am attempting to set up with an Apple watch which, in my opinion, is the best smart watch. I'm aware that I won't be able to see, respond to, or make phone calls, but to have the rest would be great. Who knows, I might even become a convert if things go well. :) I bow to those who have an educated answer. Thank you.\n\nA: The answer is...yes, but you need to activate it first.\nFrom a hardware perspective, if you have an Apple Watch 4 with watchOS 5 and an iPhone 6 running 12.x, you meet the bare minimum of requirements.\nThe short answer is you need a SIM card to activate and upgrade the phone.  However, you don't need cellular service (well, maybe for a month).  If your phone is \"free and clear\" meaning you don't have a carrier obligation on it, you are free to take it to whatever carrier you want.\nIn this case, to activate your iPhone, it needs to communicate over the cellular network once.  After it's been activated you can disconnect your cellular plan and use it as an iPod Touch.  Everything on with iPhone with the exception of both cellular and WiFi calling will be functional.  In other words, you can use it to browse the web, but you can't make calls (including Skype).  However as long as you have WiFi, the rest of the functionality that requires data will work; including your Apple Watch.\nCan you do this without activating?\nSure.  If the person giving you the phone doesn't restore it to factory defaults and you don't upgrade it at all, you possibly can use it without activating it but this seems like more trouble than it's worth.  You basically need a SIM to operate the phone.\n", "Q: No backlight on Macbook Pro 2015 and backlight fuse is burned out My Macbook pro has no backlight (you can see a dim image).

What can open it? We recently had a meltdown of a Tomcat server, that produced an 82.7 GB \"catalina.out\" log file, which I saved for forensic analysis.\nWhat macOS editors can open monster text files without consuming 80 GB of RAM or causing 15 minute freezes?\n\nA: less filename \nFrom the command line, it lets you view files straightaway without loading the full file into memory.\n\nA: With disk based text editors, the file is not loaded entirely into memory - what you see on the UI is a peek into the contents the editor has loaded into memory. I have used UltraEdit successfully in the past to do large log file analysis. Its regex based search tools and location bookmarks are especially useful. It loads the file snappily, and you can do regular expression based searches. The url takes you to a download page where you can download a 30 day trial version. There are other disk based text editors as well.\nSince it has been a few years, I installed UltraEdit and opened the largest file I had. It was a 64 GB binary file and it opened instantly. Ran a search for a term and that took about 90 seconds. I have highlighted the file size with a red rectangle in the bottom right. The mac is an MBP 2018 with 8 GB RAM running Mojave.\n\n\nA: Try Glogg. There is a MacOs build on the download page:\nhttps://glogg.bonnefon.org/download.html\nI don't know about 80 GB files, but I regularly used it (on Windos) to open log files up to 5 GB, and it works great on those (memory footprint after indexing is about 100-150MB, and searching is very fast).\nOne note though - it's read-only analyzer, not an editor.\n\nA: I would not try to open it... I'd rather do:\n\n\n*\n\n*grep - look for some text\n\n*split - chop the file into say 10Mb chunks.\n\n\nSomething like:\ngrep \"crash\" My80GbFile.txt | more \n\nIf the big file is not \"Line delimited\" \nsplit -b 10M My80GbFile.txt\n\nBut if the big file is just a load of lines, then (as was posted), split by line (100,000 per sub-file) in this case.\n split -l 100000 My80GbFile.txt\n\n\nA: You wouldn't\nEven a Tolkien fan doesnt want 82.7GB of anything.   You only want certain bits out of that; you'll know it when you see it.  \nAnd even contemplating a tool that analyzes the whole file is a waste of time, literally; it's going to spend 15 minutes just reading through the file assuming 100MB/sec. A lot slower if it's doing analysis of any complexity.  \nTerminal is your friend\nThe lifesaver here is that OS X is built on top of Unix.  That was a big part of Apple buying NeXT and Steve Jobs coming back.  That means you can use the entire suite of Unix tools, which are extremely well-honed,  and very well supported here. \nThere are dozens of ways to do it without perl, but since perl is built into MacOS and is infinitely extensible, I prefer to start there (rather than do it in a simpler tool, want to improve the query somewhat, hit the limits of that tool, and have to re-craft it in a different tool).  So something like this in a file called, say \"xx\":\n $len = -s \"filename.log\";            # variable becomes length of file\n open ($IN,  \"<\", \"filename.log\"); \n seek ($IN, $len - 10_000_000, 0);    # perl allows _ in numbers for readability\n\n while (<$IN>) {         # <> reads a line.  Default variable is metavariable $_\n   print;                # with no argument, default is metavariable $_\n }\n\nThat won't read the whole file, just seek to the specified location (10MB from the end), then read and print everything to the end.  It will just print it to the screen, so to send it to the file, do this when you call it: \n perl xx > tailfile.txt\n\nNow you have a 10MB tailfile.txt that you can open with something else.  \nThere are simpler ways to do just that, but suppose you realize \"Wait, I want to do more.  I only want errors and warnings.” So you change the print command to \n print if /error/i or /warning/i;    # // matches text, defaults to $_ \n\nThat too can be accomplished in simpler tools if you spend enough time rooting through docs. But then, you decide you need to see the three lines after the error.  Just like that... you've outgrown the simpler tools, but this is trivial in Perl.  You can just keep shimming Perl pretty much forever.   There's a full programming language in there. Object oriented and everything. \n\nA: A file that large is probably 99.999999% redundant (literally), so the key is to remove lines that occur a zillion times, to some degree of similarity, and examine what's left over.\nOn Linux there's a utility called petit, designed for analyzing huge log files, that does this. An example usage is petit --hash /var/log/kern.log. The utility can probably be found or built for Mac.\nIt processes each line of the file to remove things that make the line unique; for example, strip the date from each line, and substitute all strings of digits with a single # character. Each generic line is then hashed to become a fingerprint for detection of similar lines.\nThe result is that it outputs each line only once with a count of occurrences, vastly reducing the size of the data. Anything out of the ordinary is likely to show up clearly, and then one can search for that specifically, using utilities from some of the other answers here.\nI don't know if this particular utility is performant enough for something that size. I would bet yes, because it has options for plotting graphs on the order of months or years of input, and wouldn't need to store much besides a small number of fingerprints. In the worst case you could write your own: for each input line, genericize it to a fingerprint, hash it, and add it to a database of hash+fingerprint+count, indexed by hash.\nEDIT: petit seems to use more CPU and memory than desired, so I wrote my own simple implementation: https://github.com/curtmcd/hashlog. It makes one pass through the log file; it processes at about 6.5 sec/GB on my home Ubuntu server.\n\nA: In terms of your immediate needs, the best free visual editor for macOS is BBEdit (linked to the Mac App Store download) and it does so much - a true powerhouse.

Also, a pager like less or more or bat is also very friendly to get started and navigate around massive files. (And bat gives you wings awesome colors and syntax awareness).\nbrew install bat\n\nIn your case, the console app that comes with macOS might also be worth looking at if you can use the search functionality there. Launch the app from spotlight and drag your monster file on the window to have a peek.\n\nA: Definitely Hex Fiend. It opens files WITHOUT using RAM. It simply reads from the disk. Performance is absolutely incredible. I've examined 500gb password dumps with it before.\nhttps://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/\n\nA: Just don't (open it as ONE file)\nIs there any specific reason that you can not simply break it into about 1GB chunks with a script?\nYes, searching and similar functionality will suffer but that will already be the case with a 80GB file.\nIf you have specific break points in the script (days in the timestamp, startup / shutdown messages) you could also split it up for that. That way you would probably even get additional meaning into the file.\nAlso: once split up any decent IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or any other) will give you search functionality over the text back.\n[Beware: This comes from a programmer so might not be your approach or overkill, I can only say that it WOULD work in the end, you'll have to know if its worth it]\n\nA: *\n\n*Use less in a terminal window. It will show you one page at a time of the file, will only load about that much in memory, so you can navigate multi-TB files with it if you want.\nYou probably should add the -n option to prevent less from trying to compute line numbers. So:\nless -n /path/to/file\n\nRemember you can type less -n (don't forget the final space) and drag-and-drop the file from the Finder to the Terminal window to add the path to that file.\n\n*Once you are viewing the file in less, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*navigate using up/down arrows, space (one page down), b (one page back)...\n\n*search using /. You can also search for lines not containing a pattern with /!. Reverse search uses ?. But all searches will scan the whole file. Better have it on an SSD if you do that a lot.\n\n*navigate to a specific line in the file using <number> followed by G (capital G)\n\n*navigate to a specific part of the file using <number> followed by %. So 50% will get you to the middle of the file, 90% to the last 10%, etc.\n\n\n\nIf your log file has timestamps and you know when you want to look, the quickest approach is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*open the file\n\n*Use a \"binary search\" to find the rough part of the file you are interested in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type 50%, which will show you the middle of the file\n\n*If the part you want is after, go to 75%, otherwise 25%\n\n*Repeat until you have narrowed down to the relevant part\n\n\n*Use a regular search (using / to go forward or ? to go backwards) to find the exact line you're looking for (based on either the exact timestamp, or a specific word you know shows the issue).\nThis should allow you to navigate quickly quickly to the relevant part of the file.\n\nIf you think you'll have a lot of searching within a subset of the file, you could alternatively use grep with a specific date or date-time combination (in the right format) to first extract that subset to another smaller file. For instance, if you know the crash occurred today a bit after noon while your log covers months, you could\ngrep '2020-02-17 12:' /path/to/file > extracted-log.txt\n\nThis would give you all lines which contain a timestamp between 12:00:00 and 12:59:59 inclusive. Of course, the exact format will depend on the actual format used for timestamps.\ngrep will scan the whole file once to find all the relevant lines, which will take a little while on a very large file, but you'll then have a much more manageable file.\n\nAn alternative may be to use dd to \"extract\" a part of the original file, using offsets and lengths found in less (Ctrl-G to get the current offset). dd is a very powerful tool but can be very dangerous to use, so use with caution (and most definitely not as root or with sudo if you are not 100% sure of what you're doing):\ndd if=/path/to/original/file of=destination_file.txt bs=1 skip=<start offset> count=<length>\n\nNote that this is not very efficient, it's better to use a larger block size (bs), ideally a power of 2 such as 1024, and divide skip and count by that block size.\nI'm pretty sure there must be other tools that do the same, though I'm drawing a blank. I think some versions of cat can do it, but not the one on macOS apparently.\n\nA: \"joe\", aka Joe's Own Editor, was designed to only load parts of the file as needed.

Then hit enter.\nTo quit vim (without editing):\n:q!\n\n\nA: I would recommend using Sublime Text. Although it requires a license it can be downloaded and evaluated for free without time or functionality limitations. That means that you or your company can have the chance to try it out as much and however you want. I personally use it for investigating logs of maybe even 3-4GB in most cases, or SQL dumps of even 12GB. On initial openning it does go through the entire file in order to perform 1st level indexing etc, but it comes with a progress bar indicating the whole process's progress.\n", "Q: RAID storage drive failed - what to do? I have a macOS Server setup which is connected to two RAID (0, I think) systems. One of them does not work anymore. \nDisk Utility shows that one drive is missing/damaged. It is not missing, thus it must be damaged.\nThis RAID system was used for Backups, which we currently are doing somewhere else and therefore it is not necessary to get the data back, but welcome.\nThe drives are two Seagate Barracuda with 3000GB storage each. Taking the drives out of the case and plugging only one of them into the Mac produces the following behaviour:\nWith both drives macOS shows this error prompt:\n (The inserted media could not be read from this computer; Initialize/Ignore/Eject) \n\n*\n\n*Powering up the drive makes a weird chirping noise.

Does this have to be a Seagate Barracuda 3TB or would something else work as well?\n\nIf you have read through all this: thank you so much!\n\nA: \nWhat steps should I take next, to investigate this issue without\n  harming the failed drive further?\n\nStop using, manipulating, testing, whatever you're doing to the drive immediately.\nAt this point, all you know is that your RAID array failed.  You don't know what in your RAID failed and it could be one of two components:\n\n\n*\n\n*The enclosure\n\n*The drives\n\n\nIf it's the enclosure, your drives are likely fine.  Continued use of them, even if interrogating them for diagnostics could compromise the RAID table sending your data into oblivion.  You can test the enclosure by putting in two more drives; cheap, used ones are fine and they don't have to be large capacity as you're just testing functionality.  If things fail again, it's the enclosure.\nIf it is the drive, you don't want to keep testing them out or attempting data recovery, you could further damage them making recovery impossible.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the drives are somewhat operational and if possible, make a bit-for-bit clone of your drive to a file.  You can use dd for this task and you will do it for each drive:\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/rdiskX of=/path/do/imagefileY.img\n\nYou will end up with two image files, one for each disk.  rdiskX is the disk identifier of the disk you're copying.  You can then write those images to good disks to attempt to reconstruct your array as many times as you want without the risk of further data loss.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the drives are physically damaged, you may still be able to recover them by sending them out to a shop that specializes in this type of recovery.  Many times, it's the PCB, the drive motor (the one that spins the platters) or the stepper motor (the one that moves the heads).  This company will replace the broken components so that you (or them) will be able to extract the data.\n\n\nRAID Recovery Software\nYou mentioned that you don't know what RAID Level you were using.\n\nI have a macOS Server setup which is connected to two RAID (0, I think) systems.\n\nThis is not entirely critical.  If the drives can be remounted, the RAID table which holds the configuration can be read and recovery can proceed.  I have recovered RAID arrays in Windows several times using software made by Stellar Phoenix with excellent results.  There are a couple of RAID recovery vendors for Mac, though I haven't used them (because I changed my backup strategy long ago) - take a look at Prosoft Engineering and Easus.  I have heard (anecdotally) good things about each.\nThis brings us to the final point that needs mentioning...\nRAID is not a backup!\nRAID is for performance and/or redundancy, not for backups.  RAID 0, is striping data across at least 2 drives meaning the two drives are \"combined\" to serve as one big drive and both drives working in tandem means you get twice the performance (two drives reading one file).  RAID 1 is mirroring which is great for redundancy and uptime.  If a drive fails you continue to function lessening the impact of downtime.\nPC Magazine has an excellent write up on the different RAID levels.\nBackup Strategy\nGoing back to what I said about changing my backup strategy a long time ago, I architect everything (in my server rooms) for redundancy.  Multiple servers would connect to two mirrored disk arrays that was either RAID 5, RAID 10, or RAID 0+1.  Then we had two backups - one that did a differential every day and another that imaged the whole array weekly.  \nThis is overkill for your purposes, but it illustrates the point of not relying on RAID for your backups.\nIn your case, you can use your RAID enclosure for backup.  However, I would also have a cheap USB drive (a second backup)  that backed up your system as well.  The chances of both failing are much smaller now.  I've written several answers on backup strategies:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to backup Time Machine's backup to a cloud?\n\n*Offsite Backup Strategy for Multiple Macs\n\n*How to backup data from one external drive to another (one-way)\n\nA: If it's a striped RAID setup (e.g. RAID 0), then failure of one drive means you lose the whole thing. If one drive isn't working, you'll only have half of every file. \nYou should be able to install any pair of compatible drives, e.g. 3.5\" SATA or whatever.\n\nA: Early in your question you mention that you think it was a RAID-0. It is very important to know what kind of RAID it was.\nIf it was a RAID-0 there is no parity, fault-tolerance or redundancy so if one of the drives failed, which your description suggests, and it truly was a RAID-0 then your data is gone.\nIt is possible that you can ship the drives off to a data recovery company and they may be able to recover some or all of the files on the drives, for a fee.\nReally the only reason to use a RAID-0 is so you get increased throughput and disk/SSD write speed. If you are looking for a RAID as a safe and redundant way to store valuable data then you need to look at (at least) a RAID-1 (usually referred to as a \"mirror\") so that if one drive fails the other has the data on it or the data is stored in such a way that you can easily recover the data (such as RAID-5, 10, etc.).\nSo in summary if it is RAID-0 and the drive died your data is gone. Recovery will be expensive, if at all possible.\n", "Q: Customize Lock Screen to show Sleep button or allow BTT shortcuts to work in Lock Screen Use case: I am logged in, at one point I locked the machine, and the Lock Screen is being displayed, prompting for a password.\nMacOS catalina - 10.15.3\n\n\n*\n\n*I am looking for a way to Sleep the machine without having to put the password to unlock.

Modern WAPs (WiFi access points) often have 2 different radios and can be set to use either different SSIDs for each radio, or the same SSID for both bands. If your WAP is 2.4Ghz/5Ghz capable and uses the same SSID for both bands, be sure the authentication settings and keys (WPA2 Personal + wifi passwords) are exactly the same for both bands.\nIf they are not the same your Mac may connect to only one of them, but periodically try to \"upgrade\" to the other SSID in hopes of getting higher speed. (E.g. your mac may be joining the 2.4Ghz network and periodically attempting to move to the 5Ghz network, but failing to join the 5Ghz network because it has different security settings/password from the 2.4Ghz. The \"attempted join\" lasts a few seconds, but fails -- and during this time your ping stops responding.\n2) DHCP-related conflicts between identical SSID 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks.

I have a MacbookPro16,1 (2019) configured in dual-boot (MacOS Catalina 10.15.3 and Windows 10).

Although you may have to disable SIP to do so. Additional steps may be required if you are on macOS Catalina 10.15, since the system files are now protected on a separate disk volume. I'm not sure about these steps as I'm still on macOS Mojave 10.14.6.  \nTo change the icon, select the hard drive and press cmd+i keys and select the icon in the top left corner and drag or paste a new icon. Pasting/dragging the new icon must be in icns format I believe. You can convert a png to icns format by changing the extension of the file from .png to .icns. \nNote, I've only done this with my macOS hard drive and not my Windows partition.

This is obviously problematic, so I’d like to get all the out-of-date local files up to date.\nThe best way I can think of to do this is to download the entire public folder as it is and compare each file with my local copy, going manually through files with differences (by comparing them in Visual Studio Code).

I'm on macOS High Sierra with no interest in updating further at this time.\nIn Skype, I regularly get notifications of updates being available, which I ignore unless I have a personal issue that would be resolved in the update.  Too many times I've been burned by updating Skype only to have a new version be a disaster.  I'm currently running version 8.55.0.141.\nToday, I noticed a new message for the first time... rather than an update being available, I'm being told essentially that I must update:\n\nGet the latest update to continue using Skype\n\nIt's like MSFT is trying to scare people into updating.  Is my version of Skype going to stop working by April 2020?\n\nA: Are you required to update Skype or it will stop working?  Yes.\nFrom their Support FAQ\n\nDo I have to update to the latest version?\n  Yes. Support for Skype version 7 and below will end on November 1, 2018 on desktop devices and November 15, 2018 on mobile and tablet devices. When support ends, we’ll begin requiring updates to the latest version\n\nI know this first hand as I had a VM with an old snap shot that had an out of date Skype client - 8.1, I believe. It didn’t connect until I updated it.  Additionally, I ran across this thread on the Microsoft Forums.\n\nWhy does Skype stop working after MINOR update?\n  For example, several days ago I updated Skype to version 8.27 at several computers.  Today Skype stops running at those computers because version 8.28 was releasing.\n\nGenerally speaking, Microsoft has changed its update policy to make sure everyone is running the latest and greatest.   Most of the time it works, but I still prefer to be in control.  I can’t tell you how many times I updated my laptop the night before a presentation only to be presented with an updating screen just as I was about to present or demo.\n", "Q: Add facebook event to MacOS Catalina calendar On older MacOS version I used to have a Facebook account so all the events I participated or was interested into appeared in the Calendar application.\nWhat is the best way to achieve this now that the Facebook account disappeared?\n\nA: Have you tried this :\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Facebook.com on your Mac\n\n*Go to Events > Calendar\n\n*On the right side, click on \"Upcoming Events\" :\n\n\n*A .ics file will be downloaded, and you just need to open it in the Calendar.app\n\n", "Q: Paste image from the clipboard into a PDF in Preview The question title describes what should be a common/simple operation?  But I can not find the options to do it : After having copied an image to the clipboard -even from Preview itself - when right-clicking _nothing happens- ie. no context menu. And in Edit  we only see these options:\n\nIs it the case that one can not  paste images atop an existing Preview window? What are simple alternatives?\n\nA: You CAN do it. At least this is what worked for me on MacOS Catalina and Preview Version 11.\n\n*\n\n*Copy onto the Clipboard, the image that you want to paste on your PDF page.\n\n*Go to Preview -> File -> New from Clipboard.\n\n*This will basically create a new Preview document with your image in it. Now click anywhere on the image, press Cmd+A to select the entire image, press Cmd+C to copy and then (this is the crucial part!!) press Delete to delete the image.\n\n*You will see a blank screen in Preview since you have deleted the image. Press Cmd+V and your image will reappear, but now, in a different format that can be copy-pasted across Preview documents.\n\n*Finally, select this 'new format' image using Cmd+A, copy it using Cmd+C and navigate to your PDF document and paste using Cmd+V.\n\n*In some cases if the document you are trying to paste into is still not allowing the paste, then repeat above but start with the other document (the document you are trying to paste into), do Cmd-A (select all) in that document, copy it (Cmd-C), paste it into a new document (File => New from clipboard), and now try again to paste your other document into this new one.\n\nVoila! You can paste the image anywhere in your PDF document and on any page and you can resize and edit it just like you can with shapes. I think Apple didn't intend this to happen and I hope they don't read this and change this feature :P\n\nA: Based on @Allan's comment that Preview does not support PDF's.  Preview does support some basic image editing facilities: so I am making image copies of the pdf pages and then super-imposing the other images on top of those images. This is working for my present needs.\n\nA: You can open a new file with that image in it. Copy your image to the clipboard and go to the File menu.  Under that, you'll see the option \"Open from clipboard\". This opens a new pdf with that image in it. You can then edit the image and include text by going to Tools/Annotate. You can't add this image to an existing pdf but you can merge 2 or more pdf by using the free app PDFSam, which stands for PDF split and merge. So if I had a large PDF and i wanted to add an image i'd split the large PDF at the location I wanted to add the image. Then I'd merge the 3 in the correct order.\n\nA: You need a PDF Creator/Editor.\nPreview does have some annotation capabilities, but you cannot edit. It's like drawing or writing on a pre-published form - you can mark it up, but you cant change it.\nThere are several PDF creators/editors available on the market.  In no particular order...  \n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe Acrobat ($12.99/month)\n\n*PDFPenPro ($75 USD)\n\n*Formulate Pro (Free)\n\n*Libre Office Draw (Free)\n\n*PFDescape (Free and Online only) \n\n\nPersonally, I used Adobe Acrobat X for my complex PDF creation and editing needs (when \"Save As PDF\" just wasn't enough).  This was before Adobe went Create Cloud and it means I'll be sticking with Mojave for as long as possible.\nI've used other PDF creators in different environments and most \"got the job done\" but I always went back to Adobe.  \n\nA: One way to place an image onto a PDF page (using bundled MacOS tools only) is to use Automator's Watermark PDF Documents action. You add the image file as the 'watermark', and then set the opacity, angle, size, position, etc.\n\nA: Preview allows you to add the image to the PDF as a new page via drag and drop:\n\n*\n\n*Open the target PDF in Preview.\n\n*Open the image in a new Preview window via File > New from Clipboard.\n\n*In both windows, click View > Contact Sheet.\n\n*Drag the image thumbnail from one window into the PDF thumbnails in the other window; the image will be added to the PDF as a new page.\n\nThis method also works if you want to add pages from one PDF into another.\n\nA: Adding additional method to Shikhin's answer:\nThe exact sequence specified didn't work for me, however this did work for me:\nSteps 1-4: As is.\nStep 5: Instead of using ⌘-A, I used the \"Grabber\" hand to select the re-pasted image.\nStep 6: I then hit ⌘-C.\nStep 6: I was then able to ⌘-V into the PDF\n", "Q: How to add BlockComment extension for Xcode 11? I'm new at the excode editor. I want to be able to add block comments (/* \n */), so I found an extension.\nBut I can't seem to be able to add it to xcode. \nEverything leads me to Xcode -> Preferences -> Extensions but there's nothing there!\n\nElsewhere, apparently BlockComment should be in the Key Binding section, but it isn't.\nSome other research says that I should see BlockComment in the editor drop-down menu and that's not there.\nCan this be done?\n\nA: I found this link to app support at the bottom of the app store page you linked.

Tried everything. Are they just horrible quality? Have an external USB SuperDrive from 2012, most expensive version with DVD writer (says Model: GX40N on the inside).\nIt stopped accepting discs and stopped reading them. I have searched for info and tried absolutely everything.\nThe thing is, it's barely been used, only a handful of times. There is zero dust in it. It used to work just fine. Then it stopped accepting discs, but would still read them. Then all of a sudden it stopped reading them too.\nWhen it stopped accepting discs, I have been using a trick to hold the disc in, and perform the eject command, and it will try to push it out, and then suck it in.\nNo idea why this started happening... But at least it would read the discs.\nThen one day it just decided to refuse to read the discs. Now, when I try to read them, it just spits it out immediately, doesn't even attempt to start spinning.\nI have tried pushing all kinds of thick and thin, mint condition, CD's and DVD's in it.\nI have opened it and blown out any speck of dust.\nI have cleaned the lens with Isopropyl alcohol.\nIt makes all the right noises, everything seems to move/glide perfectly; arms, rotating thing, lens rail.\nI have tried it on multiple machines, Macbooks, Mac Mini, Thinkpad+Windows 10, so it's not like it's a driver problem.\nMeanwhile, my 20 year old, $20, who-knows-what-brand, DVD writer, in my home PC is chugging along every so happily, not a care in the world. That portable CD player from the 90's works fine too, because why wouldn't it?\nWhen googling I find endless amounts of people having these kind of issues with SuperDrives from various production years, but no real solutions, just \"replace it\".\nAre there any actual solutions that I have missed? Or is the only conclusion that these devices are just absolute trash quality at luxury prices, because Apple?\n\nA: Everything you described is a physical issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*the load/eject mechanism failed somehow to not accept disks.  Your work around was to manually hold them in.\n\n*The disks no longer being read could be the laser, the optical sensor or any of the electronic components that support these functions.  It could be a blown capacitor, resistor or fuse.  Maybe a bad IC chip or a broken trace.  Without putting hands on, it’s only a guess at this point.\n\n\nThere is no fix for it other than dissembling it and repairing it.  If this is not feasible the solution you stumbled upon is the correct one: replace it.\nYou don’t need a SuperDrive to work with your a Mac.  (IMO) They are over complicated with their loading mechanisms and I dreaded getting disks stuck in the drives.  I personally use a plain USB Plextor DVD/CD writer; it’s slow being USB 2, but it’s reliable and gets the job done.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2014 doesn't recognize internal display I have a Macbook Pro mid-2014 running macOS Catalina 10.15.3\nA few years ago, I dropped it, and broke the screen, then bought a replacement screen and repaired it myself.  Until today, I had no problems with it (except for a minor bug, which I asked about in this question).\nToday when I turned my mac on, the internal display does not turn on, but the two external monitors I use work fine.  The internal display is not shown in the display settings, nor in system information -> hardware.\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*NVRAM reset\n\n*disconnecting the battery from the motherboard, and all cables that are connected to the internal display, then reconnecting\n\n*a full reinstall of the OS\n\n\nI've also tried a plethora of other suggestions, but I don't think they are relevant.\nAfter a bit of research, I suspect the \"logic board\" might be damaged, but I don't want to spend the money for replacement parts without being certain.\n\nWhat can I do to diagnose this problem? Is there anything else I can try?\n\n\nA: The fact that your internal display failed, but not your external ones says that the GPU is working.  It suggests that your display is bad, however, it's doesn't rule out the logic board as it could be the video mux chip.\nThe only way to positively diagnose this issue is to try a known working display on your Mac or connect your display to a known working logic board.  \nSince I doubt you have spare MacBook computers laying around, it's best that you take it to a repair shop for diagnosis.\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect two iMacs via Thunderbolt 3 cable? Is it possible to connect two iMacs via Thunderbolt 3 cable and what capabilities does that provide if so?\nI've three things in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Very fast file transfers between the systems\n\n*Very fast screensharing/remote control of either system (not to be confused with using one iMac as a second display)\n\n*Access other web services running on the second iMac from the first\n\n\nIs this possible?  I know all of those are possible via 1Gbps ethernet, but Thunderbolt 3 is much faster.  I don't yet have a second iMac to evaluate whether or not Thunderbolt 3 can be used in this way.\n\nA: I just found information about how to network via Thunderbolt for two Macbooks.  I've yet to verify that it works for iMacs, but it seems reasonable to assume it will, and will perform significantly faster than ethernet networking.\nSee: https://9to5mac.com/2016/11/22/macbook-pro-thunderbolt-3-bridge-network-video/\n\nA: Yes it is, transferring files between two Mac’s is possible using target disk mode as documented on Apple’s website.\n", "Q: A key combination inserts invisible and festy character in Xcode Xcode inserts an invisible character whenever I press Ctrl+X, Ctrl+S (was trying to save the code but then realised that I am not using Emacs and should use command+S instead, and went back to delete the festy character.) Deleting something that is invisible is not fun, so.\nIs there a way I can disable this \"feature\"? And by that I mean make Xcode stop inserting the character and essentially does nothing when I press the key combination. I am not looking for a full Emacs key binding setting for Xcode.\n\nA: I don't think this is possible in Xcode.\nThis happens because ctrl+x indicates to Xcode that you want to type one of the ASCII control characters. The next thing you type tells it which one. Pressing ctrl+s inserts an ASCII 19, \"device control 3\". Different letters insert different control characters-- see the chart at that link for a full list. Control characters are not printable, so it's invisible. Unfortunately Xcode's option to show invisibles (Edit menu --> Invisibles) doesn't show ASCII control characters, so you end up with something Xcode doesn't like but that you can't see.\nYou might be able to use Karabiner to deal with this, I'm not sure though.\n\nA: Karabiner is free, but it is a little complicated to add a per-application rule. You need to create an entry for a \"Complex Modification\" written in JSON, in ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json. See karabiner.json Reference Manual\nAnother option is BetterTouchTool. It's not free, but is easier to configure, and has many other features. In the preferences, you would do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add Xcode in the application sidebar\n\n*Click the Keyboard tab\n\n*Click \"Add New Shortcut or Key Sequence\"\n\n*Press control-X in the Shortcut box\n\n*Leave the \"Trigger Predefined Action\" at \"No Action\".\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Thunderbolt networking and regular ethernet networking simultaneously? I'm considering purchasing a new iMac and recently learned that Thunderbolt 3 can be used to create a Thunderbolt network bridge between two Macs.  I assume that connection over Thunderbolt will be many times faster than an ethernet connection.  \nI also want both iMac's to be connected to my LAN via their ethernet adapters.  Is it possible for both of these connections to run independently, simultaneously, so that each Mac can still \"talk\" to the internet and other devices on the LAN, but \"talk\" to each other at Thunderbolt speeds?\n\nA: Yes, that is definitely possible - indeed this is what happens if you hook them up like this.\nThunderbolt 3 enables transfer rates up to a theoretically high of 40 Gbps.\nThe relative speed depends on the type of Ethernet connection you're comparing it with. If you're using 10-gigabit ethernet - then you're probably not going to see any practical benefit from the Thunderbolt 3 connection (if you're not transferring stuff from disk, you might get huge benefits though). If you're using gigabit or slow ethernet, you're going to see a massive improvement in transfer speeds.\n", "Q: Older versions of Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS Catalina I have a project that requires the Command Line Tools from macOS\nHigh Sierra. The specific installer I’m running is Command Line Tools (macOS High Sierra version 10.13).pkg.\nWhen I run it, I get:\n\n“This package is incompatible with this version of macOS. The package is trying to install content to the system volume. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance.”\n\nI haven’t contacted Apple about this yet.

So you probably need to find or create a volume (external drive or partition) with OS X High Sierra on it for the install to complete.\nI usually partition my SSDs so that I can keep multiple bootable macOS versions on it for running such older tooling and apps.\n\nA: I can answer the first and third part.\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes! \n\n\nFrom man installer: \n\nA device parameter for the target is any one of the following:\n 1) Any of the values returned by -dominfo\n 2) The device node entry.

Where could all my music have gone?  I haven't changed systems or done anything like that recently. I'm running High Sierra.\n\nA: While searching elsewhere for my music I decided to check my iPad Pro. My music appears to have gotten transferred to my iPad. I feel confident I didn't intentionally do this so some settings on my iPad or iMac must have triggered moving my music to my iPad. My iMac hard drive is about full and my iPad has 200 GB free. I don't know if that matters.\n", "Q: Is there a way to configure Finder to move files to external drives by default, rather than copying them? I was recently helping somebody move their Mac's information to Google Drive, and the best solution turned out to be using the Google Drive client for Mac. I moved the relevant files to their Google Drive volume in Finder, then created a few aliases from some folders inside Drive back to the Desktop.\nWe discovered a small issue when attempting to drag files into the folder aliases: Files will copy, as opposed to move to the destination. The person that I was helping is accustomed to the behavior of a real folder, where files move into a folder when they're dragged on top of it. I believe that this is because the alias refers to a folder on a (technically) removable volume, so the alias is treated the same way as a removable USB drive would be.\nIs there a way to configure Finder so that it will prefer to move files when dragging them to external volumes, as opposed to creating a copy? I specifically want to find a way to make this happen automatically, as opposed to using keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: No, there is no way to change the default option from “copy” to “move”.\nEven the option to “move” with a keyboard shortcut is a fairly new feature.\n", "Q: iPhone calendar: How do you set up an event for next year?

If so, why is this happening?  \nI am running High Sierra on my iMac.\n\nA: Apple has gotten ever-more-aggressive about activating iCloud-on-by-default as the years pass.\nThe most likely cause is that Desktop & Documents iCloud syncing is enabled in System Preferences --> iCloud.\nHere are some screen shots, note that in my example I do not have Desktop & Documents syncing turned on. \n\n\n\n", "Q: Mac App Store: View global reviews and ratings The Mac App Store app shows only the reviews and ratings from my home country on the App Store. For instance, Logic Pro X only has 9 ratings, and GarageBand only has 21 ratings.\nI am pretty sure that these two apps get way more reviews and ratings. How can I see the overall global reviews and ratings?\n\n\n\nA: It's not possible to view the overall global reviews and ratings for apps on the App Store. And this is by design.\nFrom the App Store - Ratings, Reviews, and Responses webpage:\n\nIndividual ratings inform your app’s summary rating, which is displayed on your product page and in search results. This summary rating is specific to each territory on the App Store and you can reset it when you release a new version of your app.\n\nApp Store only shows the ratings and reviews for your set home country (i.e. country your Apple ID is linked to).\nAnd, not only are the ratings and reviews displayed only for the country currently set for your App Store, they can also be reset with the release of a new update for an app. That could possibly explain the lower count of ratings and reviews displayed on the App Store.\nThe same is true for all the various digital stores that Apple runs (Apple Books Store, iTunes Store etc.).\nHowever, the developer/publisher of app/content can see the ratings and reviews for all the various countries they offer the content.\n", "Q: Can I select United States if my country is not listed? apparently my country is not listed so I'm unable to finish my registration\nfor the apple ID thing.

So my question is what might happen if I put my friend's US address and phone there? Will it work? or will i face backlash from apple and they're going to disable my device permanently? Thanks\n\nA: You can put United States as the country for your Apple ID and, if necessary, use your friend’s US address (or any US address at all) as yours. Apple does not try to verify that you are actually from the US or, by any means, you or someone else is associated with that address. However, Apple will ask for a US-based credit or debit card or a US-based PayPal account whenever you want to buy anything from Apple such as music, videos, an app or a service like iCloud. \nOr you might keep buying US iTunes gift cards off of the internet (or you may buy them yourself if you are visiting the US frequently or your friend may buy them for you and send them to you once in a while) but the first option is a bit costly and slightly risky and it is up to you to decide about the sustainability of the latter two. \nIn addition, if you would like or need to change your Apple ID country in the future, you might eventually lose some of the stuff you have bought from Apple until then under that Apple ID. \nYou can find here at Apple’s support site payment options accepted by Apple.\nP.S. You shouldn't need a phone number to create an Apple ID.

If so, how? I'm interested in having two users on my MacBook, but restrict some apps from being used by one of them. Is there a way to block apps from being used by another user of the same Mac? Or maybe whitelist some apps that can be used and restrict all others? (Which would have the same end result.)\nI'm a remote worker and I don't have strict hours, it's incredibly easy to get distracted while working. Procrastination is a real issue, and I would like to create one user that could only access work-related apps.\nI imagine I can sort of improvise a solution to this using Screen Time restrictions on my main user, but that's a bit too finicky. The ideal solution would be for me to have a Work user and be really strict about which apps this user can and can't access.\nIs this possible? If so, how?\nI'm also open to using any kind of 3rd-party software that can help me achieve something close to this.\n\nA: You can consider moving all non-work related apps away from the /Applications directory, which are automatically made available to all the users on the computer.\nA common approach is to create an Applications directory in a user's home home directory. This way, the apps installed in ~/Applications are only accessible to the user and not system wide.\nThe apps residing in ~/Applications would work in the exact same way as if they were residing on /Applications. There would be no difference in using them whatsoever. macOS apps are generally distributed as .app bundles. You can execute a .app bundle from any location in macOS. So, the exact location of where a bundle is located doesn't generally matter when it comes to using the app.\nThis approach works on any release of macOS, not just macOS Catalina.\n", "Q: Properly edit the location in Calendar events on the Mac It is kind of frustrating what Apple says that about adding a location for Calendar events:\n\nIf you select a location from the list, a map and weather info are added to the event. If you just use the location you entered, map and weather info might not appear.\nIf the event info window includes a map, an alert is set so you’re notified when to leave to arrive on time at your destination.\n\nSo if I use a drop down option but want to add a room number or floor in the building, this event will lose integration with Maps.\n\nHowever, I found a workaround using iOS devices. That is, type the location as you would on iOS Calendar app, then both Mac and iOS will recognize the location, and tell you about weather info, and remind you on the Maps app.\nBut do you guys have a smarter way?\n\nA: \nBut do you guys have a smarter way?\n\nNot to sound flippant, but I use Outlook App.  I've used this exact feature extensively (today in fact) where I have to add floor or room numbers and the App doesn't complain.  It still links the Maps data to the event.\nThe App handles mail and calendar.  It gets very high reviews and some features I now can't do without like the Focused Inbox.\n", "Q: How to disable powerchime in macOS Catalina?

When I echo my $PATH variable, I see the binaries of some programs that I have previously uninstalled, and conversely, I do not see the path to some of the binaries that I can use, such as code.\nI am using the default zsh that comes pre-installed with macOS Catalina, and from my understanding, $PATH must be set in either one of its \"main\" start-up files in /etc/ or a user configured override commonly found in the users home directory.\nYet, there has to be more because when I run:\ncat /etc/zsh* ~/.zshrc /etc/profile /etc/bash* | grep PATH\n\n## only ~/.zshrc is included because it's the only one in my home directory\n\nThe only result that is returned is the PATH variable I exported in my ~/.zshrc file. This definition does not contain the uninstalled binaries that are still there when I echo $PATH or the \"hidden\" binaries that are not there when I echo $PATH but can still be executed anywhere from the command line.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*There must be some other file that I am not seeing that is updating the $PATH variable before my own user-configured file does. Where can this file be, if not the start-up files caught by my previous cat command?\n\n*I guess you don't have to update the $PATH variable with a binary's location to be able to run it anywhere in the terminal. If that is the case, how is this done?\n\nA: You can check the content of /etc/paths and the files in /etc/paths.d which gets added to PATH by\nif [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then\n    eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\nfi\n\nin /etc/profile (or /etc/zprofile).

I would like to use it with a headset that includes a microphone for making phone calls or recording audio. I'm not sure if it's compatible and have not found details from the technical specifications.\nCan I speak and hear a phone call on an iPhone 4S with a headset that includes a microphone through the jack 3.5mm line?\n\nA: It does work for the standard earphones which are included when you bought an iPhone 4S so it's safe to assume that it works for other headsets as well, at least if their use of the audio jack is the same (which it should be, actually).\nPS: See this product listing on apple.com for an example.\n\nA: Yes, you can use the audio jack on your iPhone 4S as a regular line-in port, but only with a special TRRS four-pole adapter! This great answer is about the MacBook Pro but it also applies to the iPhone audio port. Apple's wired EarPods don't need a special adapter because they already have the four-pole connector that allows both headphones and microphone line-in simultaneously.\n", "Q: Filtering out mailing lists on the server Apple Mail is good at filtering mailing-list email into my junk folder, and my iPhone is good at recognizing email from a list.  I'd like to move this capability to some server-side filter rules and unburden my phone. Unfortunately I don't know what it is that Apple Mail looks at to make its decision.\nCan somebody please explain, in simple terms, what to look for?  I've tried 'from address contains' and 'subject contains' and 'mailing list contains' without much luck. Truthfully, I'm not sure what to put in 'mailing list contains' except that my email address isn't it. I am aware that I'll have to accept the lists I want before purging the ones I don't.\nLooking for any help or advice on getting this set up.  My email server is Cox.\n\nA: To implement server side rules, your server must support it.  \nThere’s nothing in Apple Mail that can enable something on the server if the server doesn’t support that feature. \nI searched Cox’s Support site for “server side rules” and found nothing.  Additionally, I found this message\n\nCox Email is a free service that was included with all Cox High Speed Internet packages. As of August 15, 2019, Cox Email is no longer available to new users.\n\nThis pretty much means that while the service isn’t discontinued yet, there’s no further development.  So, if you’d like server side rules, you will need to find another provider.  I personally like Outlook.com as you get the Exchange like server features along with a OneDrive account and free online versions Office.\n", "Q: Your iPhone could not be activated because the activation server cannot be reached So yesterday I went to sleep and I saw an update. I didn't update since I couldn't be bothered, but when I woke up and turned on my iPhone it said update completed. But when I tried to activate it I get that message. I have an iPhone 7 plus and I've been using it for around 3.3 years. P.S the update I downloaded was IOS 13.3.1\n\nA: Since you have an iPhone 7/Plus i immidiately suspect one of the many chip problems plauging those two models (actually the problem is with the motherboard substrate itself, I think).\nIf it is this one problem, you can find out by jumping to the initial \"Hello\" screen after the update, if you have that, and selecting the info i in a small circle in the bottom right corner. It will show you various hardware parameters of your phone, such as the serial number. It should also show the IMEI and a few others it gets from the mobile network chip (as far as I understand).\nIf it is unable to retrieve one or more of these parameters from the hardware, which is a common affliction of the iPhone 7 series, you will not see them in that info screen and it will not be able to activate, and you might get the error you are reporting, despite it managing to reach the activation server. The problem is rather that it doesn't manage to give the activation server the info it is requesting. \nIf you find that this is indeed the case, nobody is able to fix your phone but Apple, but you might be able to get a free service if you can convince them that it is the same problem essentially (which it is), as the one they have a free program for: https://support.apple.com/iphone-7-no-service\n\nA: Solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait For Sometime\n\n*Restart\n\n*Check your Wi-Fi / Network\n\n*If you're using a cellular data connection, connect to a reliable Wi-Fi network instead. \nOR \nFix iPhone Activation Errors using iTunes\nIf you still can't activate, here's how to activate your iPhone through iTunes instead:\n• Make sure that you have the latest version of iTunes.\n• Check that your computer has an Internet connection.\n• Connect your iPhone to your computer via the USB cable. Turn it off and reboot.\n• Open iTunes on your computer.\n• Wait while iTunes detects and activates your iPhone:\n• If iTunes shows, \"Set up as New\" or \"Restore from Backup,\" it means that iTunes activated your iPhone.\n• If an error in iTunes says that the SIM card isn't compatible, contact your carrier.\n\nA: I just encountered this issue after I did a full reset (Settings -> General -> Reset -> Erase All Content and Settings) on an iPhone 6s.\nAfter restarting, I couldn't get past the Activation screen, the phone was always claiming that the Activation Server could not be reached.\nI tried different Wifi Networks, used just the Mobile Data connection, checked the status of Apple's Activation servers - nothing helped.\nThen I read somewhere that your iPhone should have the latest iOS version - I installed the Apple Configurator app on my Mac (available from the Apple Mac Store for free), connected the iPhone to the Mac, and updated to the latest iOS version:\n\nAfter the iOS update completed I tried the activation again - still no luck.\nI then tried to connect the iPhone to iTunes (now called \"Music\") - iTunes detected the device and asked me to \"Click to open Finder\" - it then started the activation process...and gave me this error:\nThe iPhone “iPhone” cannot be synced. Received an unexpected response from the device.\nSo now I am stuck with a perfectly good phone that I reset to start afresh - which has essentially turned into a brick. Genius Bar time :-(\nAnd sorry, this is not really an answer to the question, just an attempt in adding some things that did NOT work for me...\n\nA: This is actually very simple...On the IPhone you have already, turn on hotspot. From there, connect your new phone (from hard reset) to the hotspot via WiFi option. From there, somehow magically the two phones bypass the cellular data issue and are able to connect like usual. iTunes usually has nothing to do with the equation if you do this correctly.\n\nA: My answer is very similar to that of Devyn.\nI tried to activate via the Wi-Fi of my university, but I guess that the \"activation server\" is using a non standard (HTTP?) port that my university has blocked.\nSo instead of connecting to my university Wi-Fi:\n\n*\n\n*I used my Android phone tethering (Settings > Tethering > Allow Tethering)\n\n*logged into the Wi-Fi tethering of my Android phone, and allocation proceeded without any hitch.\n\n", "Q: \"Announce the time\" in Date & Time preference pane does not work I have enabled \"Announce the time\" In the Date & Time Preference Pane.

I'm pretty sure the rear shell hasn't been replaced.\nHas anyone else ever seen a 128K without any signatures in it?\n\nA: It appears that the signatures were only on the initial run of the 128K Macs.\nI dug this up from DigiBarn Weird Stuff\n\nThese signatures were molded into the case and included here\n  (gradually disappearing) for several generations of Macs through to\n  the SE\n\nAnd from the Obsolete Computer Museum..\n\nThe first Macs had only 128k RAM and used single-sided, 400k floppy\n  drives.

I imagine this should be possible by syncing one or more files from ~/.gnupg\nFor the sync mechanism, I will be using Resilio Sync (not a public cloud). However, that should be mostly irrelevant; I imagine one could use git, Syncthing, or even Dropbox (risks of storing private keys on a public cloud notwithstanding!)\nCan anyone tell me if this is possible, and how to do it?\n\nA: Yes, it is certainly possible. The files in ~/.gnupg are just ordinary text files - there's nothing that \"binds\" them to one specific machine as such.\nYou can do it either by adding the files to an already-synced folder, and then linking them into ~/.gnupg - or by choosing ~/.gnupg as the folder where you want data synced to (you can choose that individually for each folder that you sync from Resilio).\n\nA: This is how I ended up doing it.

You will have to use iBooks Author for .ibooks.  For .epub you can use iBA, Pages, or various other apps.\n\n*If you intend to have a wider distribution outside of iBooks, then they must be in a different format than iBooks like PDF or EPUB.

I have a Plantronics C5220 USB-C headset and when I use it on Skype I can hear myself in the headset speakers, that's what they call \"sidetone\" (or voice feedback).\nApparently there is a native option on Windows OS to disable it, I wonder if there is any way to achieve that in macOS ?\nI have already been through sound settings and midi/audio settings.\n\nA: I got an answer from the Plantronics (Poly) support team, all their products have sidetone enabled.\nOn macOS, the driver (Plantronics Hub) they provide is not that good and doesn't allow to disable sidetone which is probably firmware enabled.\nI've also tested the headset with the 3.5mm jack on my smartphone and the sidetone is not present that why I tend to think that the sidetone is handled by either Plantronics Hub or headset firmware.\n", "Q: Unable to mount an SMB share from cron I have a script to temporarily mount an SMB share and copy some files that get generated for my team.\nIt works find locally, but fails to mount the remote share when run from cron.

I am running script manually when I need it, but would prefer to have it run periodically on its own. \nSomething is different in the cron environment from my interactive environment, but I have not been able to discern what. Google searches for answers come up with lots of \"How to mount a share from the command line\", but not from cron. Ideas and insight welcome.\n\nA: Yes, some things are different in the cron environment from your gtarsa environment. You can check the cron user environment for yourself using this \"recipe\". \nSince you can run your script manually, it seems likely you've set up your Samba passwords and permissions appropriately. \nYou've chosen not to share your crontab entry, but I've mounted and umounted my Samba shares from a cron script with lines in my crontab like this: \n25 * * * * /sbin/mount -t smbfs //user:password@SambaServer/sharename /Users/seamus/SmbSrv01 \n\n35 * * * * /sbin/umount /Users/seamus/SmbSrv01\n\nThis assumes a mountpoint declared (mkdir) at /Users/seamus/SmbSrv01\nSince the cron user's path is not the same as gtarsa, you should check that you're using full path specifications to everything that's not in the cron user's PATH... or just everything if you're not sure.\nAlso NOTE: Putting userid and password in a script or a crontab as I've done here is something you should not do. Less insecure is putting the userid and password in ~/.bash_profile; e.g.:\nexport MOUNTUSERID=\"some_user\" # where \"some_user\" is you, or a userid with Samba privileges \nexport MOUNTUSERPWD=\"some_passwd\" # \"some_passwd\" is \"some_user\" Samba password\n\nAdd these lines to the bottom of ~/.bash_profile, and use these environment vars with the mount command in your script. Before you run the script, reload ~/.bash_profile to pick up the environment variables you've just declared:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\n<redundant>You've chosen not to share your crontab entry</redundant>, but if you've not already done so you could help yourself by directing stderr from your script to a file for post-mortem analysis. In your crontab: \n* * * * * /full/path/to/script >> copy.log 2>&1  \n\nwill capture anything output to stderr in the file copy.log\nFinally, if you're running your script under the @reboot spec, you should probably put a sleep command before you try to mount.\nIf none of this helps, please edit your Q to add your crontab entries, and as much of your script as possible and relevant.\n", "Q: Reading large .mbox email files without importing to Mail? I have some very large .mbox files exported from Mail and other applications (unix mail, Eudora, Thunderbird, etc.) over the years/decades.  Is there any way, on macOS Catalina (e.g. 64-bit), of directly reading the mail in these .mbox files without importing them to Mail? (as these archives can be larger than the available storage space on my local User account partition)?\n\nA: You have to use a third-party app, on MacOS I haven't found any free ones (on Windows you have some free).\nThis one for example: \nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/mbox-office-viewer-migration/id829623734\nAll messages in an .mbox mailbox are stored as plain text so you can also open it with any text editor.\n", "Q: macOS: App icon shows up in app switcher even if instance is closed On macOS, when I invoke the app switcher by using the keyboard shortcut Cmd + Tab, I see an array of app instances. If I select an instance and release the keys, sometimes the instance doesn't open up.\nThis is super frustrating. Not only do these empty instances make the app switcher more cluttered, but it's just plain annoying that the instance doesn't open up.\nPresumably it was already closed but for some weird reason the app icon still shows up in the app switcher.\nHow do I fix/avoid this?\n\nA: \nIf I select an instance and release the keys, sometimes the instance doesn't open up.\n\nIf an app's icon is shown in the app switcher (invoked by using the keyboard shortcut Cmd + Tab), it indicates that the app is indeed running. However, selecting the icon from the list using the Tab key, and releasing the Cmd key wouldn't always show an app window(s). This could happen in following cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*All the open app window(s) are minimized: If all the app window(s) are minimized into Dock, using the app switcher to switch to the app won't automatically un-minimize the app window(s). If this is the case, just follow the procedure described below to also un-minimize an app window in addition to switching to it.\nAfter you have selected the desired app from the app switcher using the Tab key, continue holding the Cmd key after you let go of the Tab key, and press and hold the Opt key. Now with the Opt key held, release the Cmd key. If the app has one or more of its windows minimized, this key sequence would un-minimize a window.\n\n*No app window is open: It's possible for some apps (based on how it's programmed by its developer) to not have any visible/open app window even if it's running. In such cases, the trick discussed in the first case won't work as there in no app window to un-minimize. You can either click on the app icon in the Dock, or use one of the commands in the app's menu in the Menu bar at the top of the screen to show an app window.\nHere's a quick way to quit an app shown in the app switcher. After you have selected the desired app from the app switcher using the Tab key, continue holding the Cmd key after you let go of the Tab key. Now with the Cmd key held, press and release the Q key once to immediately quit the app. The app would also get removed from the app switcher instantly.\n", "Q: Phone calls on iPhone doesn't ring on Bluetooth headphones I recently started using Bluetooth headphones. Today I received my first phone call since I started using the Bluetooth headphones, and to my surprise my iPhone rang out loud instead of playing the ringtone into the headphones I had connected.\nI'd like my iPhone to be silent for the people around me, and only ring into my headphones. How can I do that? I'm using an iPhone XR with iOS 13.3.1 and Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.\nI'm puzzled that this was my experience, because somebody else said their experience was that incoming calls ring on the Bluetooth headphones.\n\nA: When a pair of headphones are connected to an iPhone (whether wired or wireless), it's normal for the ring to be played both on the iPhone, as well as in the connected headphones. This is by design.\nIf you are not hearing the ringtone play via your Bluetooth headphones, make sure they are connected (not just paired) to your iPhone when you receive the call.\nIf you wish your iPhone to not ring when around people, and want the ringtone to play just via the Bluetooth headphones:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your iPhone is set to silent mode by using the Ring/Silent switch on the left side of your iPhone.\n\n*Make sure your Bluetooth headphones are connected to your iPhone. To ensure if the headphones are indeed connected, go to Settings app → Bluetooth, and check if your headphone listed under My Devices shows Connected in front of it. If it shows Not Connected instead, turn on your Bluetooth headphones and tap on it's entry here on your iPhone.\nFrom the Apple Support document:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to put your iPhone on vibrate, ring, or silent mode:\n\n\n\nPut your iPhone in Ring/Silent mode\nWhen your iPhone is set to ring, ringtones, alerts, and sounds play through your iPhone speakers.\nWhen your iPhone is set to silent, you won't hear ringtones or alerts, but other sounds will play through your iPhone speakers and your iPhone will vibrate.\nThese settings affect only your iPhone speaker. If you use a headset, sounds play through your headset, even if your iPhone is on silent.\n\n", "Q: Is my Fusion Drive set up on my iMac correct? or is there a fix? I have a 2013 iMac previously running Mojave, now running Catalina. I thought on Catalina, that when in Internet Disk Recovery Mode, you should be able to select the Fusion Drive and be able to erase it. However ERASE is greyed out in Disk Utility when I select the Fusion Drive and is not accessible.Is this the way it is suppose to be? \nI do have access to erase both the Container, the Macintosh HD and the Macintosh HD - Data, just not the physical drive or \"Fusion Drive\". Is this iMac still functional and/or is there a way to fix it so the Fusion Drive itself can be erased? \n\nA: Klanomath and all - \nObjective: Properly erase an iMac running Catalina built in 2013\nA functional computer should be able to be erased. I was trying to determine the viability of the computer>\nBackground: I needed to erase my iMac (running Catalina) with a Fusion Drive and was told that ERASE should be accessible while in Disk Utilities in Internet Recovery Mode. ERASE was not accessible on my iMac.\nRESOLUTION:  My understanding is now that ERASE will NOT be accessible if a Mac has a Fusion Drive and is running Catalina in Disk Utilities in Internet Recovery Mode. \nIn the end, I could not use Apple's How to erase a disk (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496) documentation, but I can use the directions in Apple's How to split a Fusion Drive (using the Terminal) https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207584. My understanding is the latter splits or fixes a split, erases and re-fuses the Fusion Drive. \nAs I can now erase the iMac using the How to split a fusion drive documentation, I have been told the computer is useable. \nSide note:  I found and so did the people I was working with, the Apple Documentation to be confusing - it can be interpreted in a variety of ways and is not clear with respect to Fusion Drives and how to erase them.   \nIf anyone sees an issue with what I wrote, please feel free to chime in. \n", "Q: A downloaded webp image from a website could not be opened When I try to preview a downloaded image, I get an error:\nThe file “file-name.jpeg” could not be opened.\nIt may be damaged or use a file format that Preview doesn’t recognize.\n\nHowever Chrome browser can display the downloaded image just fine.\nHow can I preview such images?\nHere is an example image in this location.

Since it is rather big, I downloaded the PDF and am willing to edit the form offline / outside the browser. This seems to work fine with the Preview app, but Acrobat DC only lets me edit fields that I previously filled with the Preview app, Acrobat does not let me edit empty fields. \nAm I doing something wrong or might the \"official\" Adobe App be buggy? Any similar experiences on Mac? I updated to the newest Acrobat (2020.006.20034) without any changes. MacOS version is 10.15.3. \n\nA: Without seeing the PDF, it's impossible to give an assessment. However:\nThe irony of PDFs is that the format was designed to enable standardized documents; but the flexibility of the format means that PDFs can be created in lots of different ways. Sometimes the syntax can be incorrect, or the various elements unsuited to their intended task. \nWhile bugs do exist in Acrobat, Adobe are the creators and custodians of the PDF format, so in the absence of other information, I would assume the PDF document is at fault. \nIt's also possible that 'rinsing' the PDF through Preview may cause problems, as MacOS's Quartz framework can only write a subset of the PDF language. \nIn Acrobat, you should be able to Preflight the PDF (Command Shift X) and check that its syntax is correct and that it's suitable for the job required: you can also Fix any problems found. \nAcrobat should also let you create new form fields, or at least, write text in the correct position. If you can't do those things, then something is very wrong indeed. Try creating new forms or text in another PDF document.\n", "Q: Can be iPhone used to burn CD/DVD? Is it possible to burn CD/DVD with iPhone and USB CD/DVD Writer?\nI have a camera module for the iPhone to make it as if it has USB female socket instead of lightning one.\nI’ve verified it works for my portable keyboard (musical instrument) to send signals to GarageBand nicely. The module also includes another port for a power supply!\nIt was once a problem for iPhone to transfer any data to different device before the Files app became available, but it is not now, I assume.\nThat being the case, is it possible to transfer data stored on an iPhone to a CD/DVD using the camera module and CD/DVD writer?\n\nA: The Apple Lightning to USB adapter is not powered, so the trivial answer is no. As you've already realized, many powered pass through USB devices exist and some surely have enough power For most USB bus powered devices - even a motor and optical drive.\nThe slightly more complicated answer is also no. The software interface and software drivers to recognize a burnable media device isn't programmed into iOS (or iPadOS).\nAll your good work connecting the device will be for naught without software changes. I bet someone with a jail broken phone and skills could cobble together open source drivers and attempt to load them, so I'm not saying that this isn't theoretically possible, just that it's not plug and play due to software issues and potential power issues.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to burn CD/DVD with iPhone and USB CD/DVD Writer?\n\nIt's unlikely you can burn a DVD since I doubt that is a process an iPhone would support.  What might work though is DVD-RAM.\nDVD-RAM is not as popular as DVD-RW and DVD+RW, likely because the media costs more.  Or maybe it costs more because it's not as popular.  Either way there is a big difference in DVD-RAM in that it does not have a spiral cut track like other formats, it has sectors and blocks in concentric tracks like a hard drive.  Because of this it acts very much like a hard drive to a computer, as in files aren't \"burned\" they are just copied over to the file system.  Because DVD-RAM shares so many features with other DVD formats most devices with a DVD drive can read them.\nI have two \"newish\" USB optical drives, one of which supports DVD-RAM, so shop carefully if you want to experiment with this.  One drive is the Apple USB Superdrive that Apple has been selling as an accessory for quite some time now.  Plugging it into my MacBook and looking at it's supported media in System Information I see that DVD-RAM is not supported.  With my other USB DVD drive, bought from Other World Computing years ago, I see that this drive does support DVD-RAM.  The drive in the case is listed in System Information as model HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GH24NSB0 if that helps.\nI can't find my DVD-RAM discs right now to experiment with this myself.  The comments on looking out for the power draw is something I have concerns over also.  You will want the powered Lightning to USB 3 adapter and a drive that does not rely on USB for power.  Even though the drive won't take power from the USB port the USB adapter in the drive might, and it could be more than an iPhone can provide without being plugged in to a power brick.\nWhile I have not tried DVD-RAM discs with my iPhone yet I will mention this as something that I believe has high chances of allowing file transfer into and out of an iPhone.  If I can find all the parts I need soon then I'll come back to report on if my experiment was a success.\nAs far as I know there is no CD equivalent to the DVD-RAM.  There are combinations of CD drives and software that can mimic this behavior but that's outside of the standardized specifications for the compact disc, and therefore unlikely something an iPhone would support.\n", "Q: How to remove old iOS device backup (mobile backup) files in macOS Catalina Before migrating to macOS Catalina, if I had old iOS device backups, I was able to remove them via the Preference window of the iTunes app. Now, the iTunes app is gone.\nThe backup files still reside in ~/Library/Application Support/MoibleSync and are eating up a huge amount of disk space (200GB+ in my case, since I have multiple devices).\nIn macOS Catalina, where can I access the UI which allows me to see available device backups, so that I can safely and selectively remove them?\n\nA: There is a way to delete old backups in Catalina, it's just in a really weird area. From the  menu go to \"About This Mac\", then to the \"Storage\" tab, click on the \"Manage ...\" button and then click on the \"iOS Files\" item in the sidebar.

This is happening in macOS Sierra and macOS Catalina. After reboot it still stays over there for few minutes. I guess it is a screen/monitor defect?\n\n\n\nWhat may be causing this? Is it possible to resolve it? And if yes, how?\n\nA: The MacBook screen is experiencing what's called a burn in effect image persistence. This problem is an electric charge build up on the LCD. (Correction by @Allan)\nIt's a hardware issue and is generally resolved by screen replacement. There is no software fix for this issue.\n(P.S.: Apparently, this issue was widely faced by a lot of Mid 2012 Retina MacBook Pro users.

A colleague of mine has macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and complained about the following thing: He uses the search bar in Mail and searches for something. Then in Xcode he presses CMD+F and sees the same email address there as the search input. We have checked and that is not in the system clipboard.\nThis synchronization of search strings might be a helpful idea, but in practice it does not make sense to search for things across applications. Is there some way to disable this behavior?\n\nA: Search input uses the same 'hidden' copy buffer that unix uses in Terminal, called the 'kill ring'. The 'kill' command has a second part, called 'yank'\nThese are used on text editors/terminals/emacs etc using  Ctrl ⌃   K  &  Ctrl ⌃   Y \nIn effect they are copy & paste, they just save to a different buffer than the regular. As far as I'm aware you cannot disable them, only replace the content with the next 'kill', the same as the regular  Cmd ⌘   C  &  Cmd ⌘   V  copy/paste.\nHow to Geek has a good explanation of how to use it, though not hot to disable it.\nHow to Use macOS’ Built-In “Kill and Yank” as an Alternative Cut and Paste\n", "Q: Synchronise or share .zshrc between accounts I have a standard user account (in Mojave using zsh shell) and based on Gentoo Wiki I have added this to my .zshrc to show a prompt like [user@computer] ~ $\nif [[ $UID == 0 ]]; then\n   PS1=\"[%n@%M] %~ # \"\nelse\n   PS1=\"[%n@%M] %~ $ \"\nfi\n\nI changed root shell to zsh with sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh but sudo su gives an incorrect (presumably default) prompt unless I re-source my .zshrc:\n[hali@A1398] ~ $ sudo su\nA1398# echo $PS1\n%m%#\nA1398# source .zshrc\n[root@A1398] /Users/hali #\n\nBased on sourcing bash profile for root users and What are the practical differences between Bash and Zsh I copied my .zshrc for root to use with cp ~/.zshrc /var/root/ \nSimilarly I also have a hidden admin account set up according to this Apple doc and so su admin also shows its' default prompt unless I also do cp ~/.zshrc /var/admin/\nIf I copy both it then works as I want - the user(%n) is shown before the computer name(%M):\n[hali@A1398] ~ $ sudo cp .zshrc /var/root/\n[hali@A1398] ~ $ sudo cp .zshrc /var/admin/\n[hali@A1398] ~ $ sudo su\n[root@A1398] /Users/hali # su admin\n[admin@A1398] /Users/hali $ exit\n[root@A1398] /Users/hali # exit\n[hali@A1398] ~ $\n\nIs there any way to use one copy of .zshrc for these three accounts to share or somehow automatically keep them in sync as I make further changes to this file?\n\nA: Use a symlink.

Some times, some of the instances cannot be switched to anymore. When I right-click on the Icon in the dock I will see all instances, but with some of them nothing happens when selecting. Even in Mission Control the app instances are shown on the right monitor with the right state, but some of them just cannot be selected (they animate to kind of full screen and then disappear).\nI am not sure what causes this behavior, maybe disconnecting the Mac from the dock and then reconnecting. Might the window(s) land off-screen?\nIn Windows this kind of stuff sometimes happened in multi-screen environments and you could do some trick to get the focus on the app and move it with the keyboard / mouse. In Mac I don't seem to find a way to recover these apps without killing them.\nIn my particular case killing the app has also the disadvantage that I only see one process in the Activity monitor, so I would have to kill all my running instances every time this happens. \nIs this a bug with Mac / DisplayLink Manager with multiple monitors? Is there any way to recover the apps?\n\nA: So, I don't know if this will work always, but I found one workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to the non-showing instance of the app.\n\n*Switch to another instance of the app that shows.\n\n*Put this app in full screen\n\n*Switch to the non-showing instance of the app -> now it worked for me.\n\n\nI am not sure if 1-3 have to happen on the same monitor, I will keep trying this out in the next days... \n\nA: When I encounter this situation (or one similar) I quit Mission Control, which is a subprocess of the Dock, so really I quit the Dock\nkillAll Dock\nThe Dock and Mission Control and other children are immediately respawned and I have access to all my application again.\nFor me this occurs occasionally after I have changed the configuration of the displays attached to the computer, such as unplugging displays or plugging them in.\n", "Q: Want to add keyboard shortcut to open selected file with specific mac app I want to select a file and press a key combo to open the selected file with a specific application that's installed on my mac running Catalina. I don't want to always open this file type with this program so I can't create default settings.\nIs there any way to map keyboard shortcut like the above? Please advise. Thanks!\n\nA: I have seen similar mappings done in Karabiner - a more flexible system for mapping keys. It allows even funny mappings - like on the right shift key, or functions that happen if you hold a key.\nBut they require some scripting and while it's easy to get something that works on my machine only its hard to figure out something sharable. I will outline what I think needs to be done.\nKarabiner a feature called \"Complex modifications\" that allows this. I find the documentation sparse but it's simple enough to figure out.\nThere is a number of pre-made mappings where the code can be inspected at comples_modifications (use the \"show JSON\" that reveals when you click the triangle next to \"import\"). \nCustom mappings can be just put under ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications and can then be imported.\nThe launch app mappings all have a line like this:\n\"shell_command\": \"open '/Applications/TextEdit.app'\"\n\nAll that's missing is the selected file.\noh-my-zsh has a function that does this. \nIt's rather short, here in full:\npfs () {\n    osascript 2> /dev/null <<EOF\n    set output to \"\"\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set the_selection to selection\n    set item_count to count the_selection\n    repeat with item_index from 1 to count the_selection\n      if item_index is less than item_count then set the_delimiter to \"\\n\"\n      if item_index is item_count then set the_delimiter to \"\"\n      set output to output & ((item item_index of the_selection as alias)'s POSIX path) & the_delimiter\n    end repeat\nEOF\n\nFrom the command line a command like this works:\nopen -a TextEdit $(pfs)\n\nAll that would be left is to figure out how to get the pfs definition into Karabiner...\nI will leave that as exercise to the interested reader \n", "Q: What is the default META key for Irssi (IRC) on macOS?

I need to restart the MacBook Pro to let me access the region with my mouse cursor.\nThe cursor just won't pass this region, just as if the screen has ended there. I have added a screenshot below and drawn the region.\nI read about applications that might behave weird and cause such an issue, but the problem persists even when all apps are closed.\nWhat could this be?\nAre there any known issues? Or yet better, known solutions? ...\nUpdate 1:\n\n*\n\n*I have appended a screenshot of my arrangement and drawn a yellow box of the area which is not accessible.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\n*\n\n*The cursor is blocked from reaching the region in the third screenshot (I cannot reach the Files folder for example).\n\nUpdate 3:\n\n*\n\n*Today (2020/05/25, using Mac OS 10.15.4), the problem re-occured, but the non-accessible area has changed to the top-left, with the available height only being as much as the system menu and a width of 90%. (For example, I have a window in full height/width and I can no longer move the mouse cursor to the 'minimize' or 'close' window buttons).\n\nUpdate 4:\n\n*\n\n*2020/10/30, (using macOS 10.15.7) I returned my 15\" MacBook Pro, because I thought the problem only appears on them. I encountered the same problem on a 13\" MacBook with completely different apps installed. I suspect more and more that it's a very rare (race) condition / scaling bug in the OSX core that handles multiple display screens. The problem also happens on macOS 11.1 Big Sur.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: In the linked question, someone has posted a video screenshot of what happens.\n\nA: Move the white bar at the top of the smaller display to the larger display.  I had the exact same issue (27\" monitor and 24\" monitor).  I was able to move the \"box\" up and down the right side of my \"primary\" monitor, by sliding one display up and down on the arrangement tab.\nThen I Googled how to select your primary display on macOS:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202351\nThe invisible box is gone now.  I think the issue is when you set a smaller display as the primary monitor, there is some gap created near one corner that basically equals the number of mixing pixels between the two monitors.  But only at one particular corner, not all of the mixing pixels.  I would have had a nice long invisible rectangle + an invisible box if that were the case (2560x1440 > 1920x1080).\n\nA: I had this same problem and it has been driving me crazy. While I still don’t fully understand the cause of the bug I finally found a way to fix it.\nFirst a note, I think this problem only happens when the zoom accessibility mode is enabled, though it occurs even when not zoomed in. And further, it might be related exclusively to full screen zoom.\nI have a keyboard shortcut that turns full screen zoom on and off (⌘⌥8 by default), configured in accessibility settings. Whenever a region of one of my displays becomes inaccessible, I just zoom in and right back out and the inaccessible regions are gone.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: I was having this same issue. It turned out to be an invisible iTerm2 window. Closing iTerm2 solved it. I only figured it out when I copied multiple lines and clicking in the invisible area generated the iTerm2 warning for pasting multiple lines.\n", "Q: What is the proper way to change Macintosh HD icon used on Mac Startup Manager with FileVault2 enabled? I have macOS Catalina 10.15.3 (FileVault2 is enabled) installed with Windows 10 in dual-boot and I was able to sucessfully change the Windows icon, but I can't figure out how to modify the icon for my Macintosh HD drive. \nI tried with SIP disabled : \n- to replace \".VolumeIcon.icns\" inside /System/Volume/Data/ by a custom one\n- To use the Get-Info box from the Finder and changing the icon from here\n\nThe changes are working inside the Finder but not when holding \"Alt\" and using the Mac Startup Manager..\nIs there a proper way to achieve this?\n\nA: \nNote: Not all icns files are compatible with the firmware installed in your Mac. You may need to convert an icns file to a different format before the file will be recognized by the firmware.\n\nYou first need to determined the identifier for the APFS Preboot volume from the output of the command diskutil list. Below is an example.\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +898.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Muskie                  32.2 GB    disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 120.5 MB   disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                1.0 GB     disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      8.6 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume Snapper - Data          741.9 GB   disk1s5\n   6:                APFS Volume Snapper                 11.2 GB    disk1s6\n\nFrom the above output, the identifier for the APFS Preboot volume is disk1s2. If you have a different identifier, then make the appropriate substitutions. Enter the following commands to copy the icns file to the Preboot volume.\ndiskutil mount disk1s2\nsudo cp /Users/admin/Desktop/icon.icns /Volumes/Preboot/.VolumeIcon.icns\ndiskutil unmount disk1s2\n\nIn the above example, there are two versions of macOS installed in the container. The Muskie volume has High Sierra installed. The Snapper and Snapper - Data volumes have Catalina installed.  When booted to the Mac Startup Manager, the .VolumeIcon.icns file, stored in the root of the Preboot volume, is used to display the same image for both operating systems.\nIf you wanted different images in the Mac Startup Manager for each version of macOS, then you could install both versions of MacOS in different containers. Or, the same container could be used, but I am not sure if this would work when encryption is employed. An example is given below.\nThe previous example used the /Users/admin/Desktop/icon.icns file. In this example, this file is replaced by the two files High Sierra.icns and Catalina.icns stored in the Desktop folder of your Catalina account. Images of both files are shown below.\n \nThe following steps could be used to install the icns files.\n\nNote: You do not have to disable SIP.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Catalina and enter the commands given below to remove any existing .VolumeIcon.icns file from the root of the Preboot volume.\ndiskutil mount disk1s2\nsudo rm /Volumes/Preboot/.VolumeIcon.icns\ndiskutil unmount disk1s2\n\n \n\n\n*Enter the following command to install the image for High Sierra.\nsudo cp \"$HOME/Desktop/HighSierra.icns /Volumes/Muskie/.VolumeIcon.icns\n\n \n\n\n*Boot to High Sierra and enter the command given below to install the image of Catalina.\nsudo cp \"/Volumes/Snapper - Data/Users/$USER/Desktop/Catalina.icns\" /Volumes/Snapper/.VolumeIcon.icns\n\n \nUpdate for Big Sur\nThe Preboot volume is already mounted at /System/Volumes/Preboot. To change this volume while using macOS Big Sur, first you will have to disable SIP.\n\nA: I fixed it in Big Sur by booting to Recovery Mode, mounting the (encrypted) macOS - Data partition in Terminal, and then running the above commands (Copying from my mounted main partition). This does not require deactivating SIP.\n", "Q: Why is Google Chrome not seen in the Screen Recording Options in Security and Privacy settings I recently upgraded to Catalina(which I regret now). I have been facing lot of weird issues after upgrading one of which being not able to share the screen on Google Hangout Meet. I followed a few of the approaches mentioned in other forums. \nThe fix was simple where I have to go the System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Screen Recording and make sure Google Chrome is checked. \nThe issue for me, though, is that I am not seeing \"Google Chrome\" on the list when I go to the Screen Recording section and I have no idea how to make Google Chrome seen on the list. Can anyone help with this? \n\nA: Visit https://meet.google.com/\nStart a meeting, then cast your screen\nThen you'll prompt the permission window.\n\nAfter that, it'll appear in the Screen Recording section.\n\n\nA: Chrome must first ask for the access.  At that time it will show up here unchecked, unless you selected \"allow\" at the time that it asked.\nAs @ankii mentioned tccutil will allow you to reset your permissions, but you will require the bundle id of the app in question.\nTo get the bundle id\n% osascript -e 'id of app \"Google Chrome\"'\ncom.google.Chrome\n%\n\nFrom there you can reset Chrome's permissions using tccutil\nReset permissions\n% tccutil reset ALL com.google.Chrome\n%\n\nAt this point, if Chrome wants to do anything that would require explicit permission from you, it will have to ask again.  It has the permissions as though you had installed it for the first time.\n\nA: I had this issue where Google Chrome was not showing up on the list at all. Turns out that there was a pending request from another app that was in the background, still waiting for me to \"Open System Preferences\" or \"Deny\". Once I cleared that out, the system prompt for Google Chrome showed up.\n\nA: I had this issue, where \"Cast...\" was not correctly asking for the \"Screen Recording\" permission. Rebooting, tccutil, and other tricks did not work for me - instead, I installed a Screen Recorder extension which asked for the permission. Once it was granted, \"Cast...\" worked fine and I was able to uninstall the extension.\nEdit - I filed a bug in Chromium's bug tracker, and it looks like it wasn't correctly requesting the permission. A fix has been committed so should be fixed soon!\n\nA: For if you find this problem through Google, I found another solution:\nMake sure you start the application from finder and not a third party program.\nApplications started showing up in System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Screen Recording again but only when I used finder to start the application\n10.15.7 Catalina\n", "Q: Installing RAM - 27 inch late 2013 iMac My iMac is running slow and I am hoping to get a few more years out of it. I figure I have two options: \n\n\n*\n\n*add memory \n\n*replace my current hard drive with one that is solid state.  \n\n\nSo I am tackling the memory option first.

Also, can someone provide a link to a company so this newbie can purchase the correct modules?  For example:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Single-PC3-12800-Unbuffered-204-Pin/dp/B006YG8X9Y?th=1\n\nA: I'd suggest you look at your RAM usage in Activity Monitor first. 16 Gb is plenty for most tasks. If you're seeing low memory pressure (Green on the graph), then you might be better off with the SSD first.\nHere's an example of very low RAM usage: tiny amount of Green; no Swap, no Compressed memory. If you've been running for a long time, you can expect some swap.\n\nHere's a similar setup using 8Gb of RAM, which is coping, but could benefit from more RAM:\n\nPressure is still green, but higher. It's not Yellow or Red, though; but it's having to compress some memory to cope.\nDon't forget that MacOS tries to use as much memory as possible, so simply using lots of RAM is not an indicator that you need more.\nAn SSD will be a much more noticeable improvement, with app launches, document loading and other disk-related activities all being orders of magnitude faster.\n\nA: You can check memory requirements & max RAM using Everymac & search for your exact model.\nAssuming I got it right, this is yours - https://everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-i5-3.2-27-inch-aluminum-late-2013-specs.html\nRAM is 1600 MHz PC3-12800 DDR3 SDRAM SO-DIMMs (204-pin) max 32GB.\nThey also list sponsors & direct links to stores around the world who sell matching memory. Everymac will presumably get some reciprocation for these links, but as the information repository they have is available for free, I personally would not begrudge them this.\nAlternatively, search for \"online memory configurator\" for other resources.\nFrom personal experience, you won't see the full benefit of the additional RAM until you put a nice big SSD in there too.\n\nA: You can put 8 GB ram in each of the remaining slots to give you 32 GB.  I suggest Other World Computing, OWC. Crucial used to be the most reliable or so I read somewhere so Amazon should be fine as well.\nThe OWC site has a DIY video to instruct you on installing the memory.\n", "Q: iCloud log in requires old phone number i neither have nor remember I recently got rid of my iPhone & tried to log in via icloud on my laptop so I could get some contacts.\nI know my Apple ID  & my password well.

In previous desktop-based browsers that I've used, when activating their built-in Private Browsing mode I'm used to the fact that as soon as the Private Browsing window is closed, all of the tabs that were open during that session are immediately closed and cannot be re-opened. In iOS, however, the behaviour of Private Browsing in Safari seems slightly different in that even if Safari.app is killed from within the App Switcher and even after a full device reboot, the tabs previously opened within Private Browsing are still there.\nSo - my question. Is any data entered/saved during a Private Browsing session from within Safari saved to the iOS filesystem? Examples of data that I was thinking of would include form history, saved cookies, and visited links. Is this data then cleared when toggling Private Browsing off and then back on?\n\nA: Safari on iOS uses Private Browsing per tab, meaning the \"Private\" button just shows you the mode. When you open a new tab your browser will create a session isolated from the non-private mode (containing cookies, history...). \nThis session is temporary and will be deleted when you close the tab - not when you click on \"Private\".\n", "Q: on iOS, will reinstalling Skype delete my chat history?

I did, however, find out how to add just the folders from\n  iCloud drive that I manually added. It's a bit of a workaround, but\n  this is how I did it.\n  - In finder you have to use go to folder (CMD+SHIFT+G) and navigate to ~/Library/\n  - Scroll down to Mobile Documents (This folders seems empty, but actually all your iCloud folders are hidden here)\n  - Drag Mobile Documents to your dock (Once added to your dock you can see it's contents).\n  - Look for the iCloud Drive folder via your new dock folder and drag this one to your dock again (yes it's possible to drag a subfolder,\n  opened via dock, back to your dock)\n  - Now you have a Folder called iCloud Drive in your dock.

I want to be able to use cloud-based TTS services (like AWS Polly or Google Cloud Text-to-Speech) as if they were locally-installed voices. I've found the native voices to be inadequate for some accessibility needs and the cloud-based TTS services appear to offer the most pleasing and affordable way of addressing these. However, I can't find any tools that can help with this (e.g. creating a system voice that connects to a service on a cloud platform and facilitates the functionality). How might I be able to do this? \n\nA: https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/quickstart-protocol\nThis article lists all the steps required.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enabling the service's trial in Google Account.\n\n*Installing SDK\n^ This is one time setup.

Another option would be to copy paste text in an Automator's app's popup.\nNext, put that text variable in the shell script. \nThen make a dedicated folder for all the text and audio files that will be made in an action. Save the received JSON response there. The command to decode it will be fixed, since the file location and name is the same. \n\nAll of this can be put in an Automator app which displays a popup that has a text field and a Submit/ Play button. \n", "Q: Is it possible to remove or at least hide the “Family Sharing” Preference Pane from Catalina?

My issue is that it keeps disconnecting the audio output I'm using. This has been occurring ever since I bought the mac 3 weeks ago, rendering it useless to play music.\nIf I plug in my headset with minijack, I'll get to play music for about 1-5 minutes, before the Mac goes into some form of epilepsy mode, where I can observe in the audio settings that the audio output (in this case external headset) is removed and added very rapidly, sometimes naming the source \"unknown\", like every half second for about 2-3 minutes, before resuming to play music. \nIf I physically take out the mini jack during this epilepsy mode, the Mac will play music from the internal speakers, which is now named \"unknown\". During this time I'm not able to change the volume, having to quit iTunes/Spotify to make the music stop. \nThis occurs suddenly and without any obvious triggers. Its been happening 2 times while writing this post. It seems to happens regardless of external monitors, what programs are running, and happens on 2 different headsets with minijack and even with my bluetooth connected Airpods. \nAny ideas? \n\nA: This is happening to me, you need to unplug the jack and put it back in.\n", "Q: How to import photos/videos from iPhone 7 on Windows when moving fails with \"A Device attached to the system is not functioning\"?

I'm trying to be more privacy aware now by using free software instead of pirating paid ones (GIMP and DaVinci Resolve instead of pirated copies of Adobe Photoshop and Premiere etc.).\nFor years I've been downloading pirated and cracked software and giving them permissions to do whatever they want on my MacBook Pro.\nI have now uninstalled all those software, but I feel that it's not enough. I gave so many permissions that I wouldn't be surprised if some malicious files or code were still active on my MacBook.\nWhat can I do to fix that?\n\nA: A recommended course of action would be to backup your user data (data files that you have created, not the apps and their settings) onto a different (external) drive, wipe your Mac clean and start over. This could be the most sure-shot way to ensure that your computer is free of any/all malicious apps/permissions/plug-ins.\nWhen backing up the data, make sure you backup all the crucial files as well as app and system configurations (such as browser bookmarks, info about any installed plugins, contacts etc.)  and don't miss anything. Files can be copied onto a different external volume, browser bookmarks and any similar data from apps exported (for later import), user data such as Notes, Contacts, Reminders synced via iCloud etc. However, do not backup any apps/plug-ins etc.\nAnother important tip is to not use any data backup service such as Apple's Time Machine or something similar from a 3rd party that backs up and restore the entire system. Doing this wouldn't serve the purpose you are looking for. It's crucial to handpick and selectively backup only the user data files. Any apps that you are using, and wish to use should be re-installed after the fresh install of macOS, from the Mac App Store or from the vendor's original distribution source.\nOnce all the backup is done, and you are sure you have everything that you'd be needing, you should go ahead and create a bootable macOS installer. A working Mac is required to create a bootable macOS installer. So we'd be doing this before wiping the disk clean. This would ensure that we have a bootable installer handy if needed after we have wiped the disk clean and have lost access to an installed copy of macOS.\nThe step by step instructions to create a bootable macOS can be found here:\n\n*\n\n*How to create a bootable installer for macOS\nYou should also sign out of iCloud (after making sure any data that backs up to iCloud is successfully synced) and turn-off Find My Mac. Doing so would disassociate your Mac from your Apple ID. For a comprehensive list of actions to take, you can refer to the following Apple Support document:\n\n*\n\n*What to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your Mac\nNow the data backup is taken care of, we are ready to wipe the disk clean. Be doubly sure about backing up any necessary data as wiping the disk clean would make you lose access to the entire installation and any data on your MacBook's disk.\nProceed ahead to erase your Mac's disk to wipe it clean. You can find the step by step instructions here:\n\n*\n\n*How to erase a disk for Mac\nAlternatively, you can also boot your Mac using the bootable USB installer that we created earlier, access the Disk Utility and wipe the internal drive.\nOnce you are done erasing the disk, proceed ahead to reinstall macOS afresh. You can use the bootable installer that we created earlier on.\nAlternatively, if you have a decent Internet connection, and if your Mac supports it, an Internet Recovery can be attempted too. (I would personally recommend going with the bootable USB installer.) To learn more about Internet Recovery, refer to the Apple Support document:\n\n*\n\n*About macOS Recovery.\n\nOnce you are done installing macOS, signing-in with your Apple ID and setting up your Mac, you can start by installing the required apps. Two reliable sources to obtain Apps are:\n\n*\n\n*Mac App Store (built into macOS).\n\n\n*Homebrew and Homebrew Cask (A community developed package manager for macOS, which lets you easily install and manage UNIX command-line tools, and popular 3rd-party GUI apps respectively).\nYou can now start restoring your data:\n\n*\n\n*Once iCloud is enabled, any data that syncs to iCloud would get restored onto the system. Go to System Preferences app → Apple ID → iCloud (On macOS Catalina) or System Preferences app → iCloud (On earlier releases of macOS) and check what apps you wish to sync with iCloud. The checked apps would sync their data to the system.\n\n\n*Restore by importing, any app data that you previously backed up by exporting (such as browser bookmarks).\n\n\n*Any app and their plugins that can be obtained from the developer's website/source of distribution should be installed from the original source.\nIf an app that you use doesn't have a free alternative available, prefer purchasing from the vendor and installing a non-pirated version to ensure that your computer doesn't get compromised and you have a complete peace of mind.\nP.S.: If you are concerned about rouge apps getting unintended access to your personal data and wish to guard your self against it, consider installing macOS Catalina, the current latest release of macOS. macOS Catalina has improved security and a permission-based system for apps to access user data and files (kinda similar to iOS).\nOne major downside of using macOS Catalina could be that it has completely dropped support for 32-bit apps. While a majority of supported apps are 64-bit now, you may still wish to consult with app vendors to see if they offer a 64-bit version of their app that you wish to use, and there's no alternative available for the same. If such becomes the case, you may consider sticking with the last stable release of the previous version of macOS, i.e. macOS Mojave 10.14.6 which is well supported too.\nBut since you are concerned about the safety of your data and rogue apps, you should give serious thought to go with macOS Catalina. This article on WIRED sheds some light:\n\n*\n\n*The MacOS Catalina Privacy and Security Features You Should Know\n\nA: To compliment what has been already said, in the future you could also use network monitor software like LuLu to prevent internet access to apps (legitimate or not) on your system. That way your data doesn't leave your computer, or less of it, at least.\n\nA: I personally recommend Malware Bytes: https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/\nYou do not need the paid version, you don't even need the trial of the paid version. Download the software and decline the trial. You just want to run a scan of your computer. It will give you instructions to resolve any issues, in most cases automatically.\n\n", "Q: Enable SIP without reboot? Some time ago, I read somewhere that Apple had decided to provide a way to enable SIP without a recovery reboot.  If that’s true, how?  It isn’t csrutil enable (at least not on my system).\nIt would be an obvious security risk to allow disable in normal use.  But when I need to edit something “special,” it would be nice to do it with two reboots instead of four.\nOf course, it may be that what I read was neither from Apple nor accurate.  But I definitely read it, and my possibly faulty memory says it was in release notes for one of the updates.\nNo matter how much I try to make \"enable\" mandatory, web search gives me tons of hits on \"disable.\"\n\nA: Generally, you can use sudo csrutil clear, follow by a reboot, to enable SIP. So the command enables SIP without a reboot, however this does not go into effect until the next reboot. This get it down to 3 reboots to enable/disable SIP.\nYou can get it down to two reboot by using rEFInd.\nIf you want to disable SIP with a single reboot, then install rEFInd. If you specify the --usedefault option when installing rEFInd, then rEFInd will be installed to the /EFI/BOOT folder in the EFI volume. This will allow rEFInd to appear in the Startup Manager. A boot to rEFInd is almost instantaneous, as opposed to macOS Recovery which is not. Once rEFInd is properly installed, changing the status of SIP can be done by the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and hold down the option key to boot to the Startup Manager.\n\n*Select to boot to rEFInd.\n\n*From the rEFInd menu, select to enable or disable SIP.\n\n*From the rEFInd menu, select to boot to macOS.\n\n\nIf you have Windows or another Linux installed which uses the /EFI/BOOT folder in the EFI partition, then you will need to create another small partition for rEFInd to boot from. This can be another EFI partition, a FAT32 formatted or ExFAT formatted partition. You can even put rEFInd on a flash drive, if you do not rEFInd installed on your internal drive.\nI also should note that rEFInd now includes gdisk, which is a command that is easier to use than the gpt command included with macOS. So, if you need SIP temporarily disabled to edit the partitioning on disk0, you can do this in only 1 boot.\n", "Q: Disable \"natural\" scrolling on MacBook with High Sierra I've just updated my 2010 MBP to High Sierra, and I'm struggling to turn off the natural scroll feature for the touchpad (I prefer the old fashioned way).\nWhenever I look in system preferences, there appears to be nothing relevant when I search for it:\n\nIf I try the Mouse or Trackpad sections, it just tells me that neither are connected:\n\nI've also looked under the 'Mouse & Trackpad' section under 'Accessibility' and tried 'Mouse Options', but still no option for it.\n\nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nA: System Preferences >  Trackpad > Scroll & Zoom \n", "Q: How to create certain two-character items with the Unicode Hex keyboard? With Unicode Hex Input, I can put glyphs with Unicode values of more than two bytes into my documents by entering four bytes with leading zeroes.\nFlag emoji (and other things) are defined as the proper rendering of two adjacent five-nibble codes.

I have a lot of new files and the CPU is quite busy. When I just add a new file, the command mdfind won't find it immediately.

Thanks.\n\nA: Something is messed up. Other than when your system has no index, spotlight indexes as the file is written - literally its part of the process writing the data. \nThe only exception I’m aware of is you can purge spotlight or have a new install and the system queues an index of all files. My recollection is that index only lags for files that were on the drive and new files are indexed immediately. \nI don’t thing there’s a setting to change this so instead of wondering how to speed it up, run mddiagnose and work with support to see why your system isn’t caught up.

For instance, if there is a picture of a boat, I want to copy (not move) this picture to \"categories/boat\".\nCurrently I have two finder windows open, one with \"pictures\" and one with \"categories\" and I drag&drop every single picture one by one, while holding the Option key (to copy instead of moving).\nDoing this with a mouse or trackpad becomes tedious very quickly and is slow and error-prone. I am open to any suggestions, even indirect ones leading to an identical outcome.\nThe absolute ideal would be that I could assign keys 0..9 to each destination folder, then I select a picture in the Finder, hit \"5\" and it goes to the destination folder assigned to 5.

Just doing a little bit of math, if each photo applied to just 3 categories, storing them in your method, the number of photos you would have goes up to 45,000.  \nWhat you need is Photo (or image) management software which is just a very specific content management system.  The way this software works is by embedding meta data into the photo (or in Lightroom's case, they create a library of meta data that gets associated with the file, never touching the file directly).  So, if you had a photo that fell into 5 different categories, you wouldn't have 5 identical copies of the photo, you'd have one with 5 different ways of finding it.  Several of these applications have \"dupe finders\" which is a feature designed to solve the problem of the same file in multiple places!\nHere's a list of some popular Photo Management products.

I'm still using El Capitan, for a number of reasons.\nSo in Mac Mail, I have a choice of six different colored flags. I want to be able to flag emails more than once - that is, with multiple colors.\nActual use case - I run an online literary magazine, and I'm flagging emails as Orange (to read), Green (accepted) and Red (rejected). BUT I would love to be able to add a Gray tag to accepted and rejected emails (eg, Green and Gray - accepted and published, Red and Gray - rejected and recipient notified). Anyway, there are multiple cases where this would be useful.\nIs it possible?\nStrangely enough, when I've sent emails back and forth to other folks, I have seen multiple flags! But they're not in the usual spot (left side of user's email, top email) but to the right of the user's email (bottom email, green and gray!) I have no idea how this happened and have not been able to replicate it, but it's exactly what I want.\nThanks!\n\n\nA: Mac Mail doesn't allow you to do that, but the Outlook client for macOS does.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to have two computers that save to iCloud independently with the same Apple ID? I have a MacBook Air 8GB, 128GB and I just bought a MacBook Pro 16GB, 1TB which I have signed into with the same Apple ID.\nI have Air dropped two files to the Pro but everything from the Air seems to have transferred to the Pro.\nI set the Pro up as a clean start but didn't realise that they were linked until I sent things to the bin and found they disappeared from the Air too.\nI wanted to keep the two desktops different. Is this possible? If so, can you please tell me what I missed when I set the Pro up as a new without backing up.\n\nA: The answer to your question is \"no\". It's not possible to have two computers, both using the same Apple ID, to save files or data to two independent instances of iCloud storage.\nHowever, there may be more to your question. \"iCloud\" consists of several different features, including iCloud Drive, iCloud Photos, Contacts and Calendar sync, etc. You noted that \"everything from the Air seems to have transferred to the Pro\" and \"I wanted to keep the two desktops different\". It sounds like you are talking about the \"Desktop and Documents\" feature of iCloud. This syncs your Documents folder and your Desktop between devices, and it can be controlled independently of the other iCloud features. To turn it off:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > iCloud\n\n*Click the \"Options\" button next to \"iCloud Drive\"\n\n*Uncheck the \"Desktop & Documents Folders\" box\n\n*Optionally, uncheck any other app that you don't want to use or sync with iCloud\n\n\nIn this way, you can still have benefits of iCloud, such as Calendar and Contact sync, Mac App Store purchases, and a shared iCloud Drive space for files and selected apps, without having your Documents and Desktop folders synced. If you don't want any of those things, just sign out of iCloud on your new device, create a separate Apple ID, and sign in with that.\n\nA: I think you can only do that (keep separate copies of the files of different computers in the cloud using the same iCloud account) if you sign your computers in with different Apple IDs and use family sharing. In the description of family sharing Apple says\n\nOne adult in your household — the organizer — chooses the features your family will share and invites up to five family members to join. Your family can share Apple Books, and App Store purchases, an Apple Music family subscription, a single iCloud storage plan, and more. Once family members join, Family Sharing is set up on everyone’s devices automatically.\n\n", "Q: 15.4\" Retina MacBook Pro (Mid 2012): Broken metal pieces from connector on the motherboard Yesterday I was replacing the housing on my 15.4\" Retina MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) (A1398). When I was removing the Logic-board, I broke this little metal parts from one connector. I don't actually know what is that connector for (MagSafe 2 charging port maybe?). Is it important? Is that maybe grounding/earthing? Should I be worried about that and fix it?\nMacBook is Working normally but it seems to me that it has some static electrical charge right now. I was reading little bit about that - and it says on forums that electrical charge may appear once the laptop is disassembled.\n\n\nA: If it is the connector for the part you have circled in red in the left picture on the bottom row, that is a microphone assembly, containing two microphones. So if i understand you correctly in that the connector where the flat cable contact for this assembly slides into, on the motherboard, partially broke, you will now probably not get any mic input registered on your Mac, although I am uncertain if this model also has a mic in the lid next to the camera.\n\nA: They look like the pins from the SD Card Reader; you can see the solder on the ends of the joint.  However, without close inspection it's  impossible to know for sure, but they look pretty close.  \nAre they important?  Yes.  Especially so if you intend to use the SD Card reader.  What's more important is that they are falling out!\nAlso, much like a car, it’s critical to diagnose the failure after finding bits of metal inside the critical areas.  Small bits of metal indicate not just a failure but can cause catastrophic damage to the whole.  \n", "Q: Automator recipe to speed up backups in Time Machine Backups on my MacBook Pro (15-inch Late 2016) with macOS Catalina 10.15.3 are ridiculously slow. If I disable the low priority for my backups from the terminal with sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0, the speed of this service turns to be more reasonable. However, I do not want to harm the performance of the CPU while I am not doing backups nor I want to have to run that command every time I want to do a backup.\nIn fact, I scheduled a daily backup with TimeMachineEditor at night when my laptop is asleep, so I was wondering if it would be possible to create a recipe for Automator to launch this command just before TimeMachineEditor run Time Machine and also do a sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=1 when the backup is finished. Of course, user permission should be included in the recipe to avoid to enter the sudo password in the middle of the night. If so, how would this recipe look like? Thx.\n\nA: launchd\nUse launchd to run your two commands at specific times. By placing a launchd job in /Library/LaunchDaemons you can avoid needing sudo as the command can be run as root with this location.\nSee a launchd tutorial for getting started with launchd and step by step guides.\nDetermining whether Time Machine has finished must be handled by a script. The simplest solution is to re-enable low priority throttling at a specific time.\nThird Party Tools\nAlternatively, you can use a wide range of third party scheduling tools on macOS. These include the one I work on, Power Manager, which can run scripts at set times each day as root.\n", "Q: How can I take a screenshot of the app switcher in macOS?

As lowendmac in February 2018 reported, the Thunderstrike Mac Malware had been patched in 10.10.2, but it effectively has to be checked as some users and Macbook (Pro) models \"never had the protective EFI updates installed\". I am wondering which other best-practices are there to check for EFI infection and other Malware on OSX.\nI am specifically searching for self-verifiable things (not third party program), such as lists of known malware, EFI checksums and shell scripts.\nIs there actually some USB-ISO to test if the EFI is okay?\n\nA: There are several tools available from Howard Oakley’s site that I would recommend that you look at.\nSilentKnight – a new generation with fully automatic security checks\n\n[C]heck whether your Mac is up to date automatically. Checks EFI firmware, security settings and data files, and has both a summary Help page and a detailed reference. Update handles firmware checks in Sierra more leniently now it is unsupported.\n\nsilnite – a command tool which performs the same checks as SilentKnight\n\nIf you’re managing Macs on a network, this is an invaluable way of checking EFI firmware, security settings including SIP and FileVault, and security data file updates. A choice of two levels of detail, which can include checks against my database of current versions, and reports to stdout in either text or JSONised XML. Can also download and install waiting updates. Update improves firmware checking.\n\nLockRattler – a quick check of your security systems\n\nLockRattler checks your Mac’s basic security systems are active, reports version numbers of security configuration files which are active, the latest updates installed, and makes it easy to check for and install updates. Ideal for checking that SIP is enabled, and it has Apple’s latest silent security updates.\n\nThose three tools can be found at https://eclecticlight.co/lockrattler-systhist/.\nAll are available for free.\nHe has other free tools which can all be found linked to https://eclecticlight.co/downloads/.\nI realize these are 3rd-party tools, but they are also the best ways that I know of to actual accomplish your goal of checking to make sure things are up-to-date.\n\nA: It's not clear what you are wanting that the origianal article and it's links don't already provide.\n\nI am specifically searching for self-verifiable things (not third\n  party program), such as lists of known malware, EFI checksums and\n  shell scripts.\n\n\nKnown Malware.\nThere isn't any.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge there are no Mac firmware bootkits in the\n  wild and Thunderstrike is only a proof-of-concept that does not have\n  any malicious payload.\n\n\nEFI Checksums\nAny checksums, to be of any use must come from Apple.  Would you trust it from another source (even from this site which is quite reliable)?  Apple doesn't post checksums on their download page:\n\nAs you can see, there's no checksum details.  So, to be certain that you're getting genuine Apple firmware, download it directly from Apple.\nSelf Verifiable Things\nUpdate your macOS\nThe easiest way to ensure you have the latest firmware is to keep macOS **updated! The update will automatically download and install the latest firmware.\nTests\n\n\n*\n\n*Since this was only a Proof of Concept threat and was fixed by Apple in the 2015-001 Security Update, there's nothing to test for.\n\n*High Sierra actually tests your Firmware weekly already.\nBottom Line\nThis was a threat that was discovered and patched in 2015.  There's no known uses of this exploit in the wild and the best prevention is keeping your Mac updated.  \n", "Q: Does Homebrew install use SSL/TLS? I recently installed Homebrew on my Mac using the UNIX command from the Homebrew homepage \n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nWhen the command downloads the Ruby script, does it secure the connection to the GitHub server using TLS or SSL? In other words, is there any chance that I could have downloaded a malicious script if someone intercepted my connection? \nAlso, can someone please explain each of the options, flags, switches, etc. included in the command above?\n\nA: You can't know for sure, at least not based on the information you shared in the question:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's a https connection so it should be secure\n\n*Nevertheless you could connect through a network which tricked/forced you to accept a new certificate and then performed a man-in-the-middle attack\n\n*Somebody could have tampered with the script on Github, resulting in an attack within the script you've downloaded\n\n\nA: In addition to the answer by @nohillside:\n\ncan someone please explain each of the options, flags, switches, etc. included in the command above?\n\nHere's the install command-line:\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nHere's the breakdown of the various options (from the respective man pages):\nruby flags:\n\n\n*\n\n*-e: Specifies script from command-line while telling Ruby not to search the rest of the arguments for a script file name.\n\n\ncurl flags:\n\n\n*\n\n*-f: (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors. This is mostly done to better enable scripts etc to better deal with failed attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating so (which often also describes why and more). This flag will prevent curl from outputting that and return error 22.\n\n*-s: Silent or quiet mode. Don't show progress meter or error messages. Makes Curl mute. It will still output the data you ask for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you redirect it.\n\n*-S: When used with -s, --silent, it makes curl show an error message if it fails.\n\n*-L: (HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX  response code), this option will make curl redo the request on the new place.\n\nA: In my opinion with the details given you can't tell anything except:\nIf the connection used a secure line, it was for sure TLS:\nraw.githubusercontent.com supports TLS only and more specific TLS 1.0-1.2 (Report) but no SSL (2|3) variant.\n\nIt's rather unclear (or I don't know it?) whether cURL falls back to unsecure HTTP (the brew install script is also available via HTTP) if you do not force an SSL/TLS connection (e.g. --tlsv1.0). This might also depend on your cURL and system version.\n\nA: Yes, the connection is made using https, which uses TLS. Nothing is 100% secure, but it's as secure as online banking sites, etc. The file is fetched using curl. Type man curl to see all the parameters. In this case:\n\n\n*\n\n*-f : fail - do not show server errors\n\n*-s : silent - don't show progress meter etc.\n\n*-S : show-error - show an error on failure (other than server errors)\n\n*-L : allow redirect to another URL\n\n", "Q: Clipboard paste hangs application for 30s I'm on MacOS Catalina 10.15.3 (Darwin 19.3.0).

I get an email notifying me about a suspicious activity, which I mark as safe, but the mail still cannot verify the account (password is certainly correct). The only solution until now was to completely remove and add the account, but I cannot do this every single time I travel. It is getting ridiculous.\nI understand that this is a security feature for my own benefit, but most of the time lately I don't have access to the mails. Is there any way to disable this feature? Or some other workaround?\n\nA: Per Microsoft:\n\nMicrosoft prioritizes account security and works to prevent people from signing in without your permission. When we notice a sign-in attempt from a new location or device, we help protect the account by sending you an email message and an SMS alert. If your phone number or email changes, it's important to promptly update the security contact info on the Security basics page so we can work with you to keep your account secure and active.\nIf you sign in to your account while traveling or if you install a new app that signs in with your account, you may get an alert. We just need you to provide a security code so we know it was you, and that your account is safe.\n\nI added the bold part.  It appears that MS notices the IP or access location is new or different than usual and requires the additional security login measures.\nCatalina does not control your email access, it simply sends the credentials to the mail server.  It's possible that it takes time for MS's mail servers to validate your response to their security challenge.\nI also have a Hotmail account and I use Spark as my email client on Catalina.  This happens to me when I travel but I find when I wait 10-15 min I can login again.  Strangely, this doesn't happen to my Yahoo or gMail accounts, only Hotmail (and Outlook but it's the same system).\n\nA: I think that is not Apple's fault, so you need to contact hotmail for a solution because the mail client works as expected.\nThe mail provider send you such mails in most cases in order to notify about this kind of suspicious logins, so may they are also able to turn it off.\n[EDIT]\nMaybe the web client offers some settings for disabling such notifications.\n", "Q: Is it safe to update to OS Catalina while running Logic Pro X version 10.4.6?

Does anyone know if it would be safe for me to update now?\n\nA: All the negative reports I could find center around Catalina's lack of support for 32-bit code and heightened security that may affect 3rd party FX, plugins, and other software and hardware some folks use to supplement Logic Pro X.\nIf you use 3rd party software or hardware, check with the developer or manufacturer to make sure it is compatible.\nProToolsExpert has a searchable Ultimate Pro Audio Guide to macOS Catalina Compatibility chart with 152 developers listed.\n", "Q: My iCloud account was infected with a ransomware virus thru in a Windows Desktop Do I have to pay the ransom or there is a software I can use? The fies were encrypted and a .ooss extension was added. Thanks in advance for all your input. \n\nA: It depends.\nThey didn’t infect your iCloud rather they encrypted the files on the local Windows machine in the synced directory.\nIf you have a backup of the files taken before they encrypted your files, then no, you don’t have to pay.  Simply restore your data.  If you don’t have a back up, you will probably have to pay.  The good news is this is very likely to work.  These scams don’t work if people know that paying doesn’t get your data back.\nWhether you restore your data from backup or pay the ransom, make sure you do the following\n\n\n*\n\n*Change your iCloud password from a non-infected machine in case the virus had a keylogger\n\n*Wipe that machine (format and reinstall)\n\n*Change the passwords on other accounts you may have visited.\n\n*If any of the documents contained banking or sensitive info, contact those institutions and change logins/passwords.

If you are spilling water or dropping the notebook it might be a problem to recover the data, as the SSDs are proprietary (find the Ultimate Guide to Apple’s Proprietary SSDs here).\nThe T1 and T2 based models differ significantly on how data is recovered (see macrumors).  \nAs i have a water-damaged 2016 MacBook Pro, i was wondering if anyone can direct me to a detailed way of how to extract the data from this model with a T1 chip.\nThis is the Customer Data Migration Tool connector as seen in the 2016 MacBook Pro. (Source: MacRumors)\n\nThere is an Apple part #076-00236 and it has been discussed on iFixit already. Apple Gazette has a deeper investigation and concludes, that \"For A Tool That Apparently Does Not Exist, It Is Popular\". There is an actual video of someone opening this apple tool.\nIt-tech.com.au has even more info on this matter, and more importantly, a circuit diagram for the \"LifeBoat\".\n\nAnyone tried this successfully at home already? Can you point me to more information and give advice: i want to know if the data extraction is feasible and doable for a person with reasonable DIY and soldering skills. \n\nA: If you have the Customer Data Migration Tool, it is actually very simple to use. It does not require any soldering or \"DIY\" skills. You basically just need a P5 pentalobe screw driver, andto  be able to remove the six screws that secures the the lower case.\nNote that you say that you're thinking of using it on a water damaged computer. In that case you would want to use a multi-meter to first check that the power lines used by SSD power management IC (and the \"Life boat\" connector itself) haven't been shorted by the damage.\n\nA: This company sells the tool:\nhttps://www.thebookyard.com/product.php?manufacturers_id=29&products_id=18467 Ones on eBay are more expensive, as this is a refurb. \n", "Q: Faster language/keyboard swapping I like making a habit to use the different languages I study, to keep that knowledge fresh. So I like typing in those languages when I get the chance. But swapping keyboards under OSX is just a little too cumbersome.\nFor example, I was just typing the name of one of my co-workers in its original 汉子 form instead of as an English transliteration. It's nice. It reminds me to pronounce her name properly, with tone, etc., which otherwise doesn't come naturally. The transliteration of her name is especially misleading. Everyone at the company is pronouncing it wrong. \nBut to swap into writing 汉子 I have to mouse up to the top menu bar, select a new keyboard, type, mouse back up to the top bar, and then select back into English. I know there's a keyboard shortcut, but with 5 different keyboards active in my menu, cycling through 5 to get to the one I want feels just as cumbersome.\nIs there a way to attach a hotkey to a specific keyboard, or some other way to make swapping character sets lighter?\n\nA: Try Kawa.\nIt’s an open source (free) language switcher for macOS.  You can use custom shortcuts or the menu bar to switch languages.\n\n", "Q: What is the power input to the iPhone 7 and where is the spec page?

You cannot use the iOS Distribution certificate for signing anything without the private key.\nYou (or someone else on your team) have generated that private key at some point. If you have the private key on a different computer, in a backup, or can get it from someone else, you'll just need to export the key from that other computer and import it on this computer. Then you can proceed with automatic signing or manual signing like you have already done.\nIf you cannot recover the private key, you'll run into the message that you have seen saying that you cannot generate yet another iOS Distribution certificate as you have already reached your limit. You can overcome that by revoking your existing certificate(s). You do that on the developer web site in \"Certificate, Identifiers & Profiles\".

In my case, I can hear my external backup drive rattling along, so I know it's doing something.\nYou can check on progress by opening the latest backup log. Look for the directory with a name ending in .inProgress on your backup drive. Within it, open the log file with the most recent timestamp:\n$ sudo less +F \"/Volumes/MacBackup/Backups.backupdb/MacBook Pro/2020-08-05-163227.inProgress/.Backup.618330747.626060.log\"\n\nSubstitute MacBackup, MacBook Pro and the backup/log path.

Looking at the amount of free space on your backup disk should give you an idea of how far along it is.\n\nA: I would recommend that you do not limit your log show by this predicate, which leaves just one subsystem, but rather - use predicate specifying the Process name (or path) instead. (Don't know which process does the backup - but simple inspection in Activity Monitor will tell you.\nWhy? because then you see log messages not just by the backup daemon itself, but also from all the Cocoa frameworks and other sub-systems it makes use of.\nThis is immensely more helpful, and you can quite easily see where things go wrong / slow  and if there were retries.\n", "Q: Make iOS App Store search stop “helping” Apple’s App Store search function sucks.  Example: I thought (wrongly) an iOS app existed called “cookie” that helps us reduce tracking.  But I can’t tell whether I’m wrong or right, because Apple’s search logic appears to be “cookie is related to candy, so let’s show him everything that mentions candy.  And candy crush is a game, so let’s also show him every other game in the store.”\n“Cookie” is not the only search that has been hopeless due to this kind of idiocy, so I wonder if there is a way to filter to what I actually asked for.\n\nA: I tried a webmaster tool search term site:https://abc.com for cookie app. Found the app for Mac, https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cookie/id1473091386?mt=12. Went to its developer page via the link at the bottom: https://cookieapp.com\nEven if this is not the app you're looking for, it's good to have some idea about the developer to find an app quickly.

The best solution is to use another search engine.\nFilter by Site\nUse a site specific filter with your preferred search engine. Add site:itunes.apple.com to your searches.

If Apple replies to your problem report via email, that email can contain a return email address for the particular Mac App Store problem you are reporting.\nEach app developer is also required to have a support link for that app listed in the App Store.\nFor general support, Apple recommends using their Support App. See:\nhttps://support.apple.com/contact\nThere are also Apple community support forums: https://discussions.apple.com/welcome \nand https://discussions.apple.com/community/app_store/using_app_store \n", "Q: My Mac is beeping 3 times every couple of seconds when it starts Here is what happens, I have 5-10 seconds to do stuff on my computer, then it turns off, turns back on again and attempts to load or something, then turns off. then eventually after enough on and offs, it goes to a white screen and beeps 3 times every couple of seconds, I searched it up, and it definitely doesn’t beep every 5 seconds but a little less than that.

See if there's a local guy who does Apple repair work. (The Apple Store may say it's too old, but it's worth a try.) \nIt may just need the existing RAM to be reseated or replaced.

The charging speed should be exactly the same in the former case, and almost the same in the latter case.\nThe two chargers are both USB-C, while the 2016 MacBook Pro charger tops out at 87W - the 2019 charger tops out at 96W. The computer and charger will automatically make sure that the correct charge is applied.\n\nA: The wattage requirement of the 2019 MacBook Pro (96W) is greater than the capability of the 2016 charger (87W), so it will either charge slowly, hold its charge level, or continue to lose charge slowly, depending on usage.\nAnalogy time: imagine a bath half full of water (the battery). The plug is removed, and water leaves the bath (energy used by the laptop). You add water by turning on the tap (Recharging).\nIf the tap can't supply water fast enough to match the water going out, then the bath level (battery) will continue to fall, but at a slower rate than no water going in at all. \nIf the tap can supply only a little bit more than the water going out, then the level will rise, but slowly.\nWith the laptop shut, it should still gain charge, but a bit slower than usual.\n", "Q: No sound with Bose QuitComfort 35 ii I had trouble getting sound in my Bose QC35 ii headphones connected by Bluetooth to my Macbook Pro 2015 running Mojave 10.14.6.

(in year 2020) All Apple questions are stale after one year. Why? Because iTunes is gone and other big changes this year. So I am re-asking. \nI have a new phone and backed up my old phone with Finder. Now when the new phone is restored, none of the apps are there. I know how to install the apps and set them up. But this would require considerable time for dozens of apps, so I am seeing other options.\n\nA: The backup with Finder is the same as with iTunes, same is for restore. When you restore an iTunes backup, app data is restored from the backup and apps are downloaded from the AppStore. If you don't see any apps, make sure that you are logged in to your Apple ID and that you are connected to a good Wi-Fi.\n", "Q: How to unmute headphones by default when plugged into MacBook Pro? Each time the mac is turned on, and the headphones are plugged in, they are muted by default on my MacBook Pro. I need to unmute them every time in System Preference-> Sound -> Output. I have thus two questions:\n1) Do you know any way to automatically unmute the headphones when plugged into the mac ? A terminal command or any other manipulation ? \n2) Is the behavior of my Mac normal ?\nThanks for your help !\n\nA: 1) \nYou can use a third-party app like Keyboard Maestro or EventScripts to trigger a volume setting script whenever you plug your headphone.\nFor exemple, with EventScript:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Open Folder from EventScripts menu in order to open the scripts folder.\n\n*Add the script you want to be triggered, in your case something like do shell script \"osascript -e 'set volume 1'\" (note that set volume function works from 0 to 7, 0 being mute and 7 maximum volume).\n\n*Click on Choose Script from EventScripts menu and select the script to be used.\n\n*Add the event Headphone connected.\n\n\nSee my own setup as exemple to quit or launch Boom whenever my headphone or my bluetooth device is found:\n\n2) I don't think this behavior is normal, your Mac should remenber the last volume setup you had with headphone...

I was trying to make fonts on external non-retina display look good and I was playing with setting CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled as many advices on the internet said. But nothing helped me and I declined an idea of using an external display.\nBut now I wonder what this setting actually does? I was playing with CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) with Catalina and without external display and it seems to me that this setting does not change how the fonts are rendered on built-in dislay. No noticeable difference.\nCan somebody please explain what setting CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled is supposed to do? Maybe I use it wrong or not able to see the difference.\n\nA: CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled is used to enable/disable subpixel antialiasing.

Right after the project is created, there are multiple errors. The first one is:\n\nFailed to create provisioning profile. There are no devices registered in your account on the developer website. Plug in and select a device to have Xcode register it.\n\nI found many similar issues, but the given solutions didn't work in my case, or the issues where slightly different than mine, so I couldn't use them.\nIf there's any information needed for anyone to help, tell me and I'll provide it.\n\n\nA: The solution for this error is emptying the field at the Code Signing Identity at Build Settings.\n\nI thought it didn't help since there are still multiple errors. I now realize that those errors are not related to the one this question deals with.\n\nA: Xcode is named Xcode - not xCODE. It is not an emulator.\nWith that out of the way, the solution to your problem is - as it is also stated in your screenshot - to plug in your iOS device to the computer in order to get it registered with Apple's system. It is required before you can create a meaningful provisioning profile.\nNote that you do not have to do any of the above if you only want to run your program in the simulator. In that case, select to build for one of the installed simulator in the Xcode top bar.\nIn case you haven't got an iOS device to add to your provisioning profile, and you want to only use the simulator, you can simply forego signing completely.

I need to encrypt my disk with FileVault. It's a MacBookPo (2014), 8GB with 128GB SSD, 80% full.\nI would like to understand if I could run into trouble because of low space available, if after encryption I will have less space and if my Mac will run slower...\nAlso how long will it take to encrypt? can I use it while encrypting?\n\nA: There's no extra risk associated with converting a 80% full disk. That should work fine without any problems.\nAfter encryption you'll have about the same amount of disk space available. It is not going to result in any kind of noticeable drop in available disk space.\nThe Mac will run a tiny bit slower compared to before. I doubt that you will be able to notice it at all.\nYou can keep using the computer while it encrypts. It is impossible for us to predict how long the encryption process will take - but expect a considerably number of hours, perhaps a full day. It runs in the background allowing you to keep using the computer - and it supports you putting the laptop to sleep or even turning the power fully off.

If I have IMPORTANT-RESOURCE.jpg and important-resource.jpg on a case-sensitive file system, I do a Time Machine backup, then wipe boot volume, and create a case-insensitive volume, then restore from Time Machine, what will happen to the duplicate file?\n\nA: Time Machine by defaults formats the backup disk as case-sensitive, even when the original source disk is case-insensitive. This means that in any case, the file names are preserved when backing up.\nIf you when restore files from a backup made from a case-sensitive file system to a disk with a case-insensitive file system, Time Machine detects conflicts. The first of the two (or more) conflicting files will be copied over as normal. For the rest of the conflicted files, you'll get a popup stating that the destination disk already contains a file of that name. The popup allows you to either keep only the first file, keep only the second file - or keep both, where it automatically renames the second file to include \"copy\" in the name.\nIn general I would say that you should never do this with a complete system backup. Always restore a case-sensitive backup to a case-sensitive file system. If you have a limited number of files and expect a low number of conflicts, it could be done ofcourse - but it probably more work than justified.\nIn fact by default, if you wipe the volume completely and let Time Machine do a full restore, it will create a file system with the same case-sensitivity setting as the original source volume. I.e. if the backup was created from a case-sensitive disk, it will format the volume as case-sensitive during restore.\nYou can change by altering the com.apple.backupd.VolumeIsCaseSensitive\"extended attribute on the top folder matching the name of your source volume. below your computer name in Backups.backupdb.\n", "Q: Numbers formula for rolling 12 month sum I have a table with income data over a 2 year period showing columns: date, description, job1, job2, job3, (the income shown is for 3 different work jobs over a period of time).\nIn a separate table I would like to calculate my income over a rolling 12 month period but can't work our how to do it. \nCould someone help me please?\n\nhere are the simplified tables, so with this basic data I can do the basic sum (as sown). but in the complete table 1 there are hundreds of entries so I need a formula to calculate the figures in table 2 please. needs to be a rolling 12 months figure for each heading. thank you\n\nA: You can do this using the SUMIFS() function in Numbers. The SUMIFS() function allows us to conditionally add up a group of numbers with multiple criteria.\nThe picture below shows how to do it using this function based on the samples of the input data table and the outcome table you have given. Pls pay attention to the absolute references in the formula, i.e. the \"$\" signs; they are necessary for the formula to work correctly when you copy & paste it to other cells.\nIf you have any difficulty in creating the formula in cell E5 based on the picture below alone, you can recreate it by typing its following form (or copy & pasting it from this post) into an appropriate cell. \n= SUMIFS(Table 1::E$2:E$7,Table 1::$A$2:$A$7,\">=\"&$A5,Table 1::$A$2:$A$7,\"<=\"&$B5)\n\nNote, however, if your actual input data table is placed differently (the one in the example I gave, including the header row, starts from A1) or bigger than the one in the example I gave, you would need to change some or all of the cell references in the example formula I give here. \n\n", "Q: If I shut down my MacBook and don't wait 60 seconds have I stopped it saving to iCloud? I was working on a project yesterday and when I finished I decided to shut my MacBook down without waiting 60 seconds.\nI had just assumed everything was saved to iCloud already but when I turned it back on today, all the work I did was missing!\nDoesn't everything save to iCloud instantly?\nI am so frustrated and don't want this happening again.\nHow can I avoid this?\n\nA: There's no need to wait 60 seconds before using the \"Shut Down\" feature in the top menu.\nWhen you save documents and close programs, the data is saved to disk. When you use \"Shut Down\" the system ensures that everything is written to the disk and properly saved before turning off.\nFor iCloud stored data, everything is stored locally on your own disk first - and only synced to iCloud later (although \"later\" could be a split second later).\nIn total: If you have experienced data loss, it wasn't because you shut down the Mac. It is either a case of (a) you have actually saved the data, but can't find it, or (b) a mal-functioning program.\nIf you have Time Machine backups set up, you might be able to find a recent copy of your project in the backup.\n", "Q: iTunes Library - Help with transition to new computer - Backup Catch 22 Situation:\nOld version of iTunes\nOld version of Windows Operating System.\nCannot backup library because I cannot access my account without updating iTunes and iTunes will not update until I update my Windows operating system.\nIs there a way to backup the library to an external disk drive, purchase a new computer and restore from that drive?\nAlternate:  How do I get iTunes to backup my existing library?\n\nA: There is a third party solution to this and it's freeware. But what it does is backup your entire user profile and then restore it on another PC.\nI have been using the ForensIT TransWiz to migrate people from one computer to another. I did a whole bunch of Windows 7 to Window 10 migrations and as long as all you need is located in your user profile folder (iTunes library is) this works a treat.\nBasically you log onto your PC as an admin user but not as the person you want to copy. Run the program and save the created file to an external drive. When you have the new PC log on as an Admin user (don't create the user you intend to copy to) and run TransWiz again, point it to your previously backed up file and it will restore to the new PC.\nOnce you have done all of that install a new copy of iTunes and it should find your old iTunes files and update them for the new version.\n", "Q: Changing country or region without spending the remaining apple balance from gift card What will happen if i change my country or region to another country without spending the remaining balance i have in my apple id which i redeemed from gift card?\nCan i still buy subscription from another country using that remaining balance?\n\nA: You can’t use credit from your Apple ID’s previous country’s iTunes store in its new country. Because of this, you have to fully deplete the credit on your Apple ID before changing its country by purchasing stuff or giving it out as a gift to someone with an Apple ID with the same country. If the amount is too small to purchase anything or to give it out as a gift, you can contact Apple support. \n", "Q: detaching a chrome tab on catalina causes a jump to a different workspace It is my habit to have dozens of chrome tabs open across a dozen workspaces in macOS.\nOften I want to to re-organize these tabs.\nFor example, I may have an instance of chrome on workspace 5 with 10 tabs.\nLet's say that I want to detach 3 of these to a separate instance of chrome on the same workspace. \nThis has worked fine for years. However, after the upgrade to macOS Catalina, when I detach the first tab, I and the tab are forced to a completely different workspace containing a completely different instance of chrome.\nThis is extremely disorienting and annoying and it happens every single time that I detach a single tab from an instance of chrome.\nI've tried these commands in the terminal as suggested here:\n $ defaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool YES\n $ killall Dock\n\nBut when I detach a tab now, the tab just seems to disappear.\nIt is actually transported to one of my 12 workspaces but I am not.\nNow I have to go searching for it.\nThis is driving me insane.\nAnyone have a work-around?\nUPDATE: I've confirmed this is a bug in chrome not macOS mission control\nThis is so annoying that I switched to firefox and firefox does NOT experience the same issue. \n\nA: Actually, I do get \"teleported\" with my tab, but that is also super annoying.

How could I see that?\nIs there any other information I can get about the whereabouts of the phone?\nI would be interested in the IP because it might help the police.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to see the IP address of the stolen phone? How could I\n  see that?\n\nYes.\nIf you want to get it from Apple, you'll have to subpoena them for it.  To get the address and owner info of that IP, you'll need to subpoena the ISP or carrier.  \nApple will tell you where your phone is, but they will not tell you give you the details of who who owns those things without sufficient a sufficient legal basis to do so.\nHowever.... \nYou can get your IP from different services, like gmail, dropbox, etc. When these services periodically check in, they can tell you from what IP address it checked in with.\nFor instance, I use Outlook.com and using their Activity feature, I can get the IP of my last sign in:\n\nIt will not, however, tell you the actual address, to get that, you'll need to subpoena the ISP.  The location data that they give you is not the actual location of your phone, it's the location of NOC that handed out that IP.  \nBottom Line\nAll of this information is obtainable.  Police departments can (quite easily) obtain IP, GPS coordinates, cell tower identification, etc.  However, the costs of doing so often outstrip the value of the device. Other peoples identifying information is protected (even if they did steal your phone) and you (or the police) need to go through the legal process to obtain this info (lawyers cost money even if they work for the city).\nI'm not saying all is lost, if you can help them with location info and enough probable cause for the police to search (assuming you're in the US) and you can actively ping the device that points them to location (i.e. you sharing Find My Phone data with them real time), they can execute a search.  The \"Make a Sound\" feature can help them \"proof positively\" identify your device for further action.  \nIt's far better to use the Find My... geo location data than an IP because you don't need to process any legal paperwork to (accurately) find out where you or your device is or has been.\nGet this data and file a police report. \n", "Q: Why does macOS not assign unique identifiers to files? I want to preface this question by disclosing I know next to nothing about computer architecture, storage and operating systems.\nFor a personal project, I'm trying to make a roadmap for how to make a small helper program that will enable linking to annotations in PDFs.\nI have hit a small roadblock, though. Say I have a PDF called Doc. I'm reading and I make an annotation called Annot. Because the Annot is contained in Doc, I would first have to link to Doc's path:\nPath > Doc > Annot\n\nThis could work by linking to the doc's path. There is one problem with this, though. I often reorganize my PDFs as my collection grows, so a link like that would soon break. Which leads to my question:\nWhy do macOS by default not assign each file on your harddrive a UUID for easy recall? In such a way, I would be able to link like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Link to Doc path with UUID as argument\n\n*If path doesn't contain a document with Doc's UUID, search for a document with that UUID and go to path\n\n*Return Doc\n\n\nI think I might be able to make a similar solution by assigning a UUID to a documents metadata.\nSo to sum up: Is there any reason this wouldn't be included by default? Is there any reason this would be a bad idea?\n\nA: Bookmark remains persistent across reboots. \"File reference URL\" (file:///.file/id=367.27/) is not reboot safe.\nIf user relocates a file, both \"String-based path\" (/Users/me/a.txt) and \"Path-based URL\" (file://localhost/Users/me/a.txt) break too.\n\nLocating Files Using Bookmarks\nIf you want to save the location of a file persistently, use the bookmark capabilities of NSURL. A bookmark is an opaque data structure, enclosed in an NSData object, that describes the location of a file. Whereas path- and file reference URLs are potentially fragile between launches of your app, a bookmark can usually be used to re-create a URL to a file even in cases where the file was moved or renamed.\nTo create a bookmark for an existing URL, use the bookmarkDataWithOptions:includingResourceValuesForKeys:relativeToURL:error: method of NSURL. Specifying the NSURLBookmarkCreationSuitableForBookmarkFile option creates an NSData object suitable for saving to disk. Listing 2-3 shows a simple example implementation that uses this method to create a bookmark data object.\n\nsource\n", "Q: How to remove duplicate files from the Photos app library I am running OSX 10.12.6 and sorting a large number of mostly not native digital pictures (scans from negatives).\nUsing the command:\nfdupes -r -A  \"/Users/yves/Pictures/Photothèque.photoslibrary/Masters\" \n\nI get many results of duplicates like below, same files but in different subfolders:\n/Users/yves/Pictures/Photothèque.photoslibrary/Masters/2019/12/27/20191227-174527/_NIK3130.tif\n/Users/yves/Pictures/Photothèque.photoslibrary/Masters/2019/12/31/20191231-081818/_NIK3130.tif\n/Users/yves/Pictures/Photothèque.photoslibrary/Masters/2020/01/02/20200102-183407/_NIK3130.tif\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this normal behavior ?

No software can distinguish the difference between “Oops” and “I meant to do that”\n\n*Cloud storage isn’t back up, it’s file synchronization for availability everywhere.  That saved file was synced to all of your devices when it changed.\n\n*Time machine would be the best way to protect your data.

I hope someone could help :)\n\nA: I will give a general answer about what you may and may not store on iCloud, since you didn't specify what data is important to you.\n\nWhat you can store in iCloud:\nPhotos \nIf iCloud Photo Library is activated you can check the option to optimize phone storage, which will offload your photos and store them on iCloud. Therefore, when you want to view them in full resolution you need a internet connection (be careful with cellular data, especially for videos).\nDocuments \nYou can save documents (e.g. pdfs, pages/word docs,...) in iCloud Drive, with the Files app (requires iOS 11). \nMusic \nIf you use a streaming service (e.g. Apple Music, Spotify,...) the music files themselves can be streamed (as the name implies) and therefore don't need to be stored locally.\n\nWhat you can't store in iCloud:\nApps \nYou can't store the app on iCloud. The same is true for most app data (exception to this are e.g. pages/numbers/... documents)\nSystem \nQuite obviously, iOS itself needs to be stored locally.\n\nTo get an overview of what is using your memory head over to preferences -> general -> iPhone-storage.\nNote that some apps (e.g. WhatsApp) store their data in the app and all your chats and their media will be shown as app data.\n\nA: On iOS, it’s the other way around. You can’t have all your iCloud files stored on the phone as well; it will download them as and when they’re needed. (Photos are an exception to this; iCloud Photo Library will keep all your photos on the phone unless you tell it not to.)\n", "Q: Why would native Mac filesystem performance be MUCH worse than various virtualized disks on the same mac? I was attempting to profile a php application when I noticed it was running MUCH slower on my mac vs docker vs virtualbox (all on the same hardware). I started narrowing down possible issues, but now I'm not sure where to go. It seems to be related to the filesystem or core utilities itself, but I'm not sure.\nSo I started simplifying the problem and the running some tests. I dumped a large number of files from the app (~7.5K files, 74MB total size) as a sample set to perform operations on into a single dir, and then copied the dir to the container, and the vm.\nTest 1: time -p find . -type f -exec md5sum {}  \\; > /dev/null\nNative | Docker | VirtualBox \n  27s  |   6s   |    5s\n\nTest 2: time -p find . -type f -exec cp {} /dev/null  \\; > /dev/null\nNative | Docker | VirtualBox\n  16s  |   9s   |    7s\n\nTest 3: time -p { dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/delme bs=4k count=100000 && sync; }\nNative | Docker | VirtualBox\n  0.7s |   0.8s |    0.4s\n\nWith the first 2 tests, I was trying to test reading and operating on many files using native utils. OSX was significantly worse. I was trying to test raw disk speed with the 3rd test.\nI know this methodology may be flawed or there may be more accurate way to test, but this is just what I came up with and seemed representative enough for troubleshooting. (More details - I ran each test on each env sequentially, repeated the process 3 times, and took the average. Mac is Catlina 10.15.3 encrypted APFS (no errors reported on the drive). Docker container is debian:latest. VB VM is Ubuntu 16.04.\nSo what's possibly going on here? Am I overlooking something obvious? Is it likely the differences in filesystem performance? I also ran these test on a linux cloud container running on AWS, and had numbers aligned with the Docker/VB VM. Does it have something to do with how virtualized files are typically stored/read? Does the encryption on the native disk matter (since they are all ultimately on this disk)? Could it be some corporate endpoint security process intercepting native read/writes? (I'm unaware of any, but it's a company laptop, and I don't know everything installed, but when I run sudo htop, I'm not seeing anything unusual to me.)\nAny ideas for further troubleshooting? Using a virtualized layer on top of the native hardware to get a 2-4x improvement just seems wrong.\nEdit 1: Results with disk cache clearing\nSo after reading this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28845524/echo-3-proc-sys-vm-drop-caches-on-mac-osx\nI re-ran the tests with a flushed disk cache and noted the change (∆) between the first and 2nd run.\nFor Native:\nsync && sudo purge; run test; run test immediately again;\nFor Docker and VB:\necho 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; run test; run test immediately again;\nNative | Docker | VirtualBox\n  ∆5s  |   ∆3s  |    ∆3s\n\nThere was a clear difference between first and second run, but they all improved with disk caching, and the timings from my original tests indicate a primed a cache for all the original runs that I noted, and the performance difference still remains.\nEdit 2: Sharing a script for others to test/verify\nI wrote a short script to create some sample data files, simulate a workload similar to what I described, and print the results. Then I ran it on an older 2015 Macbook that I recently reset and installed Catalina on (so no unknown corporate apps, no encrypted APFS, etc.) I tested it natively and using Docker for Mac on that machine. Once again for the limited testing, the linux VM (running docker) on the Mac significantly outperformed OSX. I then tried with my original php app. Same result.\nIf you try the script and notice significantly different results, please let me know. If anyone has suggestions to improve the script/tests, please do, but otherwise there are certain scenarios/workloads that I just won't be using OSX for from now on and will be using a vm/docker on the Mac instead.\n\nA: What you are seeing is the consequence of your hypervisor lying to you about disk write flushing, presumably because you have disk writeback caching enabled in the VM configuration. Disable the write caching, and you will find the performance is going to be much more similar (probably worse than bare metal).\nAs a secondary test, you can try on your host by LD_PRELOAD-ing libeatmydata and you should see that your bare metal performance reaches or surpasses the performance in VMs.\n", "Q: Clear \"Other\" data on iPhone I know very similar questions have been asked on Stack Overflow.\nYet, 8/9 years and a couple of iOS updates later, I am wondering if there is any new solution to this problem. I currently have 14.07GB occupied on my iPhone which is more than half of its total capacity (andere = other):\n\nI know of the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*restore iPhone from Backup after wiping it\n\n*use a third party app like iPhone cleaner, iExplorer or DiskAid to dig into the files\n\n\nI have deleted Safari caches, deleted music files (I am using Apple Music, so I only stream), offloaded most of my photos/videos and activated offloading unused apps. Yet, this wouldn't help much with the \"other\" data anyway...\nIf the mentioned options are the only ones I have, what would you advise me to do and why?\n\nA: First of all, are you sure you need to clear this data? iPhones manage the \"Others\" category alone and should \"release\" the cache when space is low. \n\nIf the mentioned options are the only ones I have, what would you advise me to do and why?\n\nI would choose the backup & reset option so you don't have to dig into the files and the cache will be the smallest possible.\n", "Q: How does the Boot Camp Assistant force the Windows installer to prompt the user to choose an edition of Windows to install?

I am interested in knowing whether the \"ping\" utility shipped with Mojave 10.14.6 sources are open.\nman ping ends with BSD March 29, 2013 BSD, but it seems that FreeBSD's version of ping is not the same as the one I use locally:\nhttps://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/sbin/ping/ping.c\n\nA: Apple puts all opensource content on https://opensource.apple.com.\nI didn't find the 10.14.6-related sources there but ping version included in 10.14.5 is available here. At first glance Apple seems to have added some stuff, but you may need to run a diff to see all the changes.\n\nA: Yes, the sources are open, but based on @nohillside's answer it seems that Apple has not published the sources for 10.14.6. I don't know why this is. I'd be surprised if there were any difference in the source for 10.14.5 and 10.14.6 because it seems Apple has not updated ping.c since the version that shipped with 10.12 in June 2016. Apple does not publish a History as is done on GitHub, but you can run a diff (or use BBEdit as I did) to compare the ping.c sources from different releases. \nWrt your point that man ping ends with BSD March 29, 2013 BSD, two points: \n\n\n*\n\n*The reference to BSD in man ping is due to the fact that substantial portions of the MacOS code base were adopted from the BSD sources. Apparently ping is one example of this, based on Apple's declarations and licensing language in the comments of ping.c. \n\n*The date at the bottom of  man ping  does not reflect the revision date of the manual, nor of the ping utility itself. I'll show this below, but to see the source of the date stamp (BSD March 29, 2013 BSD), refer to the source file ping.8. Find the line beginning with .Dd, and note the date matches. I suspect the BSD references in the date stamp have to do with the troff markup; i.e. .Dd is a troff macro for BSD man pages according to this source.  I do not know why Apple doesn't use this macro to set the actual date the man page was last revised.  \n\nAs further verification, you can download the ping.8 source file and read it as follows:   \n\nman ./ping.8  # in the directory where ping.8 is located\nThe source code for the manual (ping.8) was revised sometime between the release of MacOS 10.12 and 10.14. This can be verified by doing a diff on the man source files for those releases. Consequently, the revision occurred sometime after 10.12 was released in June 13, 2016, more than 3 years after the date stamp of BSD March 29, 2013 BSD. \nYour observation that \"FreeBSD's version of ping is not the same as the one I use locally\" is correct (assuming locally means on your Mac). You can verify that there are numerous diffs between the FreeBSD's ping.c on GitHub, and Apple's ping.c in their source repository. \nI think your question is interesting. Like you, I see references to BSD and old-ish dates in the manuals. And I've wondered why an organization with Apple's resources packages older software and manuals with MacOS. I asked a related question recently. The answer I accepted stated that the reason Apple has not updated the Unix tools in MacOS is \"GPL licensing\". \nHowever, in attempting to answer your question, I now wonder if that answer was entirely correct. I'll try to be specific here as my original answer generated some controversy in the comments: \n\n\n*\n\n*According to diffs in Apple's ping.c source files, the ping utility was last updated sometime prior to the release of 10.12. That's been over 3.5 years as of this writing. \n\n*ping was covered under the permissive BSD license when Apple adopted it. In fact, the BSD license was so permissive that it allowed Apple to make modifications, and change the terms of the license for the modified software! All of that means only that there are no licensing issues that would discourage Apple from keeping ping current. \n\n*ping is not cutting edge software, and for that reason I wouldn't expect it would require frequent revisions. However, the History tab on FreeBSD's ping.c source shows that there were 28 commits between Jan 2017 and Nov 2019. I won't try to analyze them, but something is motivating FreeBSD to expend resources to make frequent updates to this utility that's been around since 1983. \n\n*Based on the above, I believe the situation is this: while \"GPL Licensing\" may deter Apple from maintaining some of the Unix tools included in MacOS, \"BSD licensing\" doesn't mean that the code will be updated frequently. That said, I won't argue that the \"BSD licensed\" utilities aren't generally more current than the \"GPL licensed\" utilities. It's a matter of \"degree\", not \"absolutes\". Also, as of this writing, ping is the only BSD-licensed Unix utility in MacOS I've tried to analyze. \n\n\nI feel I should make one other clarification in an effort to quell the controversy my original answer generated. I have not made any judgments on the quality of Apple's software, their processes for maintaining it or their licensing practices. Like most participants here, I've made an investment of time and money because I favor some of Apple's products. But I'm not sycophantic about Apple, and I feel that it's only rational to question practices that raise concern: caveat emptor \n", "Q: Other Data on Apple - How do I clean cache and other unused data on Mac How do I clean cache and other unused data on Mac?\n\n\n\nA: Normally, you should not need to 'clean' caches. You will not recover much space, and the OS will immediately try to re-populate the caches, so the space will be filled again.\nApple's utility for Managing Storage is not always accurate in its categories (nor is the Storage display in About This Mac).\nUsually, most stuff on your storage is yours. User data. Stuff you've created or downloaded. Click on File Browser on that window you've shown. That will give you a list of things on your disk, sorted by size. Then you can see what's taking the most space.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) Freezes & Crashes too much My MacBook Pro keeps freezing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Graphics: Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB\n\n*Processor: 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\n\n*OS: Mojave 10.14.6\n\n\nI tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ran Apple Diagnostics => No issues\n\n*Changed setting: System Preferences => Energy Saver => uncheck Put hard disks to sleep when possible\n\n*Reset NVRAM\nBut all of it does not work.

I would like to get an email or equivalent as soon as a new version is published in the app store. I need to track the version available in the app store for several applications at once. \n\nA: No, there's no way to do this from the App Store.  Developers do not have access to any Apple API to notify users when a new version is available within the App Store.  \nDevelopers can notify users within their own app that a new version is available.  For example, I have several apps that send me a popup message about a new version but I must open an older version of that app first, before I can see the notification.\n\nA: maybe this would provide a solution:\nhttps://ifttt.com/applets/C24NsQMa\nBut only for single app, and cannot duplicate IFTTT applet:\nhttps://help.ifttt.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001421514-Can-I-duplicate-an-Applet-\n", "Q: Is it okay to rely on CocoaPods when deploying an app? Can I deploy my app to AppStore with 5-10 cocoapods?

However, whether or not you should be using that many packages is an entirely different question.\nAlso, your point about the MIT license is a good one.  You should also be acknowledging all these package creators within your app somewhere.  For example, in my app's Settings page I have a tableview row that lists the packages my app uses.  App Store review will not check for that but it I think it's required with the MIT license.\n", "Q: How Can I Recover My Data From a Failed Fusion Drive Using TestDisk? I have a 2017 iMac (version 18,3) with Mojave on a 2TB Fusion Ddrive. The volume is not encrypted, no Bootcamp, I created no extra partitions. Aside from the migrated data from my old MB Pro, it looked like a regular factory installation of Mojave on a Fusion Drive.\nWhile re-compressing some large jpg's, my iMac spontaneously rebooted leaving me with nothing more than the flashing-question-mark-folder icon.\nI do have Time Machine but, for various, completely unjustifiable reasons, I have not had TM running for a couple of months. Obviously my fault and intensely stupid. But, since self-recrimination somehow doesn't restore lost data, I have had to resort to other methods.\nLong story short involving many spontaneous reboots and kernel panics, The Fusion Drive does not show up as a possible boot drive. Repair is not possible in Disk Utility (First Aid on Apple HDD ST2000DM001 Media (disk0) returns OK. First Aid on APFS Physical Store disk0s2 returns First Aid process has failed. If possible back up the data on this volume.)\nI used the internet OS install feature to install Mojave on a Thunderbolt external drive so that I could try to recover data from the dead Fusion Drive. N.B. the system will now boot to the external drive but, even though the external is selected as the boot drive, the system panics at about 60% on the progress bar, spontaneously reboots, then successfully gets to the log in screen on this second go-round. This is consistent behaviour. Once booted, the machine runs normally—perhaps marginally slower as it's off of an external drive.\nI installed  DDRescue-GUI on the external Thunderbolt drive to image Disk0 to an empty 5TB external drive. This succeeded, returning 0 unreadable data and 0 bad sectors. Well, I think it succeeded. The truth is, I don't really know what a good image of a Fusion Drive constitutes. Noodling around on the internet does not return many positive sounding results.\nMight be pertinent: the 2TB image now seems to take up the entire 5TB external drive and in Disk Utility, the drive is listed as uninitialised, 5TB. I'm assuming this is because it's a raw image or something to that effect.\nI then installed TestDisk and ran it on the image, I got these results:\nFirst:\n    TestDisk 7.1, Data Recovery Utility, July 2019  \n    Christophe GRENIER <grenier@cgsecurity.org>  \n    https://www.cgsecurity.org\n\n    Disk /dev/disk3 - 5000 GB / 4657 GiB - 9767475200 sectors\n\n    The harddisk (5000 GB / 4657 GiB) seems too small!

Looking at those results, things are a bit sliced up. \nMy question is this: how do I interpret these results and what are my next moves? Imaging the 2TB and scanning for results were fairly time consuming so I'd rather not 'just try something' and have to start over again. While I do have a good image of the bad Fusion Drive (what I think is a good image), if I take the iMac in for service or replacement (it's under warranty) and then also manage to mangle the image, then I'm left with nothing.\nI'd like to be able to recover as much as possible before taking the machine in since, no matter how Apple decides to deal with it, I highly doubt that they'll try to recover my data.\nThanks in advance for your time and efforts.\nEdit\nAs requested, I ran diskutil corestorage list.\nIt returned No CoreStorage logical volume groups found.\nAlso, if it will help,

I already have it set up to run with iterm2 when I double-click. I don't really care if it uses iterm2 or Terminal, I can easily switch that if needed. I really am just interested in getting it to run in a non-login prompt.\nI have my script set to run by dash (!#/usr/bin/env dash) but because it first starts up a zsh login prompt it sometimes prompts me things I don't want it to bother with (e.g., starting my ssh agent and asking if I want to update oh-my-zsh).\nMy guess (I might be wrong) is that if it started as a non-login prompt it wouldn't try to do these things. If it turns out that zsh non-login prompt still does this then I can probably set it up to run straight in dash in a similar way.\n\nA: The Automator application can be used to create an application that will run a shell script.

On my phone (iPhoneSE running iOS 12.x) I rarely ever receive any legitimate phone calls, but I get loads of spam.\nI would like to silence all calls except for my one Emergency Contact, but without impacting any other notifications at all.\nThis means I can't use Do Not Disturb because it silences all notifications.\nIs there any way to silence all phone rings except for one person, but without using DND mode or otherwise silencing notifications?\n\nA: Immediately upon posting this question, I had a flash of insight as to a possible solution.  Turns out it works perfectly!  Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a \"silent\" ringtone to your phone (instructions at https://www.wikihow.tech/Set-a-Silent-Ringtone-on-an-iPhone or just Google \"silent ringtone on iOS\")\n\n*Set this silent tone as your default ringtone under Settings > Sounds\n\n*Enable a custom ringtone for all contacts that you actually do want the phone to ring for.\n\n\nNote that the caller must not have their caller ID blocked for their custom ringtone to work.\nNow your phone will only ring on calls from those specific contacts, and nobody else, all without using DND mode or disrupting any other notifications on your device.

The Toolbar is singularly unhelpful in that regard: hovering over the new Textbox does not give a balloon reporting what is the shortcut. Bad on Apple there..\n\nAny hints here?\n\nA: ⌃⌘T (control-command-T) is the shortcut for text annotation (Tools → Annotate → Text).\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to decrease playback speed on YouTube doesn't work with Chrome (on german keyboard layout?) The playback speed on youtube.com can be manipulated by using keyboard shortcuts < and >.\nHowever, on my MacBook only the > for increasing playback speed seems to work while < does nothing.\nWhat do I have to do, to make < work as well?\nIs there a way to decrease playback speed with another key?\nEdit: According to the keyboard shortcut list on YouTube Shift+, and Shift+. should increase/decrease playback speed as well. Both combinations do not work either.\nEdit2: As @Tir Dy pointed out, it works in Firefox.\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem and found a solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Preferences > Keyboards > Input Sources\n(Systemeinstellungen > Tastatur > Eingabequellen) and add another\nkeyboard layout, e.g. \"English\".\n\n*Activate the keyboard input in the menu bar (checkbox below called\n\"Eingabequellen in der Menüleiste anzeigen\" in German).\n\n*Now you can switch the keyboard layout to English and then\nShift-press \",\" or \".\" on YouTube in order to slow down or speed up.\n\n\n\nBackground information:\nOn US/UK keyboards the < and > symbols are on two different\n  physical keys next to the m key and both of them have to be\n  shift-pressed.\nOn a German keyboard the < and > symbols are both on the same\n  physical(!) key (right next to the left shift key).\nProbably this is the cause problem, so the < does not get detected,\n  because YouTube thinks both functions (speed up, speed down) need the\n  shift qualifier pressed simultaneously.\n\n\nA: I have the same problem.\nMy computer is an iMac (mid 2017) with Spanish-ISO keyboard and Mojave. I can't find any working keyboard shortcut to reduce the playing speed in Youtube.\nI've tried with different browsers (Safari, Chrome, Opera and Edge) with the same bad result in all of them.\nCuriously, Firefox and Tor browsers seem to work well. With Firefox I can use the combination Shift+ and Shift+ without problems to change the playing speed. With Tor Browser, just using the < key and the combination Shift+< (>) works.\nI've also tried in a virtual machine with Windows 10 in the same computer and keyboard without any issues. So, definitely, there's something wrong between Youtube, macOS and some browsers.\nChanging the keyboard language in preferences and choosing English works correctly, but of course is not the ideal solution. I would like to find a better solution to do this with Safari and continue using the Spanish-ISO configuration of the keyboard.\n\nA: I found a temporary solution using Keyboard Maestro software.\nI have created a macro with this software that executes 3 different actions with a custom keyboard shortcut. The three actions that it performs are: 1. It changes the keyboard language to English. 2. Simulates the keyboard shortcut “Shift+,” (which works on YouTube with the English keyboard configuration). 3. Change the keyboard language back to Spanish.\nKeyboard Maestro executes this actions just in a few tenths of a second, so it is practically instantaneous. Maybe it is not the ideal solution, but it works fast for me.\n\nA: The Chrome extension \"Playspeed\" now works for me really well. It provides only three keys:\nOne to speed up, one to slow down and one to reset to normal.\nIt would actually already improve the situation a lot if YouTube would provide a speed reset shortcut. But unfortunately there isn't one.\n", "Q: Why Mac Handoff shows the model of my iPhone so weirdly?

Below are screen shots - 1 from the calendar screen, look at the AA 1455 flight that shows the correct time of 2048 then the Today View that's 2 hours off, 1848.  Does the Today View get its time from a different source than the calendar ?  How can I get the Today View to show the correct time?  This seems to happen when im traveling....  iOS 13.3\n\n\n\nA: I suspect there's a time zone issue if you're travelling a lot between time zones. \nDoes it help to go into the Calendar settings in iOS and set Time Zone Override? I'm not sure how it works, but worth having a look at it. Additionally, you can also set the time zone for individual events for particular time zones. \nI've attached a screenshot of the Time Zone Override screen in the Calendar settings on iOS. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro: DNS works but not ping, http, or https Approximately twenty hours ago, I shut down my MacBook Pro and got on a plane.  At home, everything was working.  Now, at my sister’s house, I cannot get anything in Safari nor by ping.  \nPing gets “no route to host” for any name or IP address, even when I ping the IP address of the DNS server that successfully resolved the other host names.  \nTo make sure the DNS wasn’t cached, I rebooted, and tried a hostname I knew hadn’t been used in months.  The name was resolved, but still, “no route to host.”\nIt’s not my sister’s router, because I get the same thing when I switch to my iPhone’s hotspot.  \nIt’s not any of the remote hosts, because they are working for the iPad and for my sister.\nWhen I use Fing (a network scanner) on the iPad to examine the network, I see that everything is on 10.0.0.x including a Cisco router.\nMy iPad and iPhone and her Android and Windows are working fine on the same SSID.\n???\nCould it be that TCP on the laptop somehow broke in transit while UDP still works?\nUPDATE: Totally weird.  ifconfig get packet en1 had absolutely no output.  tcpdump -s 500 -v -I en1 also did nothing for about a minute, even though I tried a ping in another window (which also did nothing).  But then tcpdump started rolling, and it was fairly plain that both sides were trying to do lots of IPv6.  Going back to the settings, it had changed itself back to manual.  I kept changing it to DHCP, but every time I did anything, it changed back to manual.  Eventually, without knowing what I had done differently, it stayed on manual and then everything worked.  And the router is definitely 10.0.0.1.  SMH.\n\nA: Edit: based on your edit above, I recommend following the steps below, but removing the wireless connection and re-adding it before going to \"Advanced\" settings. I've broken up step 1 into three parts, below.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac go to System Preferences > Network\na. Click your Wireless Connection > Minus Symbol (-)\nb. Click the Plus Symbol (+) and re-add the wireless connection\nb. Click your (new) Wireless Connection > Advanced\n\n*On the TCP/IP tab ensure \"Using DHCP\" is selected, Configure IPv6 is\nset to \"Automatically\".\n\n*On the DNS tab, remove any entries that do not appear in grey text.\nThose would be overrides you've added at some point (knowingly or\nnot)\n\n*On the Proxies tab, uncheck any checked boxes.\n\n*On the Hardware tab, make sure \"Configure:\" is set to\n\"Automatically\"\n\n*Ignore the other tabs.\n\n*Click the OK button. Reboot the machine.\nIf this does not resolve your issue, look to the router config for some kind of MAC or device-type whitelisting settings in the admin.\nAlso - compare your DNS and IP Address, and router address information to that of the iPad or phone and ensure it is the same.\n\nA: This is more of a guess than an answer, but perhaps having a static 192.168.1.x connect to a 10.0.0.1 confused everything, including having it refuse to accept being set to DHCP.  But how it was able to serve DNS in spite of everything else failing is still a puzzle.  Maybe the DNS worked through IPv6.\nThe reason the iPhone worked (apparently) is that it was on DHCP (even though I know I put all my devices on static 192.168.1.x addresses.\n\nA: If DNS is served from your router, then DNS working means the physical transport from the host to the router is set.\nIf things the router needs to route fail from the host, and you change nothing on the host, and then the router starts routing, then that's a pretty large smoking gun pointing you at a router issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*What do the router logs show?\n\n*Does the router / switch have port-fast or BDPU or spanning tree configuration you can safely change to test if that's causing the blockage?\n\n\nUnless your Mac has containers, virtual machines, multiple synthetic / virtual network interfaces, or is acting like a router, there's not much chance macOS is causing or even related to the problem. To test this you could boot to recovery and use the Utilities menu to run your tests with the same router, same hardware and a thinned macOS runtime / OS.\n", "Q: Auto start an application using a script what I would like to do is a script which 1st checks whether a list of applications is running (e.g. Spotify, Thunderbird, Rocket Chat) and 2nd launch the apps from this list which are not already running.

fact that its file was present.\nIn development I use nodemon and npm run dev in two Terminal tabs — both were running Sunday night, before stopping them and then sleeping the Mac.\nI was wondering if a permission had been altered.\nI tried Homebrew, which installed Node but not NPM, so I had to remove that.\nI tried the official Node installer for Mac, but it's an old version that caused problems, so I had to remove that.\nI went down the nuclear path, and removed Node wherever it could be found:\nbrew uninstall node;\nwhich node;\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/node;\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/\nbrew doctor;\nbrew cleanup --prune-prefix\n\nI then tried the official instruction to install Node via the command line:\ncurl \"https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-${VERSION:-$(wget -qO- https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/ | sed -nE 's|.*>node-(.*)\\.pkg</a>.*|\\1|p')}.pkg\" > \"$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg\" && sudo installer -store -pkg \"$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg\" -target \"/\"\n\n… which failed:\n-bash: wget: command not found\n… and when I attempted to install wget:\nbrew install wget\n… I got more errors:\n\nError: The brew link step did not complete successfully The formula\n  built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local Could not symlink\n  share/locale/cs/LC_MESSAGES/libidn2.mo\n  /usr/local/share/locale/cs/LC_MESSAGES is not writable.\nYou can try again using:   brew link libidn2\n\n… and:\n\nError: The brew link step did not complete successfully The formula\n  built, but is

similar problems with Homebrew before the weekend, and I think this is a continuation of that.\nWhen I run brew doctor I get:\nUnexpected header files:\n  /usr/local/include/node/...\n\n… and there are hundreds of files associated with Node, in spite of having uninstalled it.\nI've since found a few different approaches to fix the possible permissions issue:\nsudo chown -Rwhoami:admin /usr/local/\n… and:\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*\n… but since I have no idea what the possible consequences of running either of these would be, some expert advice would be much welcome!\n\nA: I just solved this same error. What worked for me was:\nbrew install node\nsudo chmod 776 /usr/local/lib\nbrew link --overwrite node\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/local/lib\n\nWhen I ran npm -v I got the same error:\ninternal/modules/cjs/loader.js:983\n  throw err;\n\nTo solve it I ran brew reinstall node and everything is running as expected now. \n", "Q: iPhone 6 location services only update location every 20 minutes or so I have an iPhone 6 (iOS 12.4.5) that struggles with finding its location. When it's not on WiFi, it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thinks I'm thousands of feet away from where I actually am\n\n*Has a giant \"radius\" where it thinks I could be in\n\n*Can only update my position about every 20 minutes, and still gets it wrong\n\n\nCellular data and location services are enabled, and this happens on every app. There doesn't seem to be a problem with cellular data; it can download things just fine. The device is a bit over 5 years old (Sept. 2014)\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toggle Location Services\n\n*Toggle Airplane Mode\n\n*Soft- and Hard-Reboot iPhone\n\n*Uninstalled apps that I thought might be interfering\n\n*Reset my location settings\n\n*Reset my network settings\n\n\nHow can I get location services to work correctly again?\n\nA: From a page at Quora:\n\nThe phone uses three methods to determine your location, depending on what it can access at any time. First, it uses a GPS that triangulates to satellites in the sky to determine your location within a few feet. But you must have a reasonably unobstructed view of the sky. Second, if you are not in airplane mode, and can reach a cell tower, the phone triangulates to available cell phones towers and estimates where you are based on the signal strength of the various towers it can reach. This is the least accurate method, but it covers a lot of ground and can be surprisingly good. Third, and finally, if your phone can pick up on wi-fi signals from local homes and businesses. these have been cataloged to allow Apple to tell about where you are, even if the wi-fi signal is encrypted. (I THINK this still works, but I’m less sure.)\nSome combination of these can nail your location very accurately most of the time.\nBut sometimes my phone still thinks I’m maybe a mile from where I am, usually if I’m in a building and my wi-fi is turned off.\n\nFrom a Support Page at Apple:\n\nWith your permission, Location Services allows apps and websites (including Maps, Camera, Weather, and other apps) to use information from cellular, Wi-Fi, Global Positioning System (GPS) networks, and Bluetooth to determine your approximate location.\nApps that can show your location on the screen, including Maps, show your current (approximate) location using a blue marker. In Maps, if your location can’t be determined precisely, you’ll see a blue circle around the marker. The size of the circle shows how precisely your location can be determined—the smaller the circle, the greater the precision. When Location Services is active, a black or white arrow icon appears in the status bar.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to make sure Location Services is finding you in the correct location is to have a clear, unblocked connection to GPS satellites, which isn't always possible.\n\nA: I think you need to consider that this could be a hardware error. Somehow the GPS IC or the antenna used for GPS could be damaged.\nTo rule out hardware error, I would take a full backup of the device, and then use the Settings > General > Reset menu to 'Erase all content and settings'. Set the phone up as a new phone, and test if GPS starts working. You can then restore your backup later to get your data back.\n", "Q: How to control volume of music based on \"Now Playing\"? I'd like the Mac to mute itself when there's an ad on Spotify. It comes in a pair, 30 seconds each. I now have to hit mute button, then guess if a minute is over yet and then unmute it. Solid distraction. \nI think that this info: \"Advertisement\" in music title could be used. But I don't know if it is accessible by any means in AppleScript. \nSome task/ process/ job which I turn on while opening Spotify, which would be monitoring the Song title and then trigger mute and unmute after 60 seconds would do.\nPlease get me started on this. \n\n\nA: I figured a simple solution.

The keyboard is connected through USB C to the dock.\nIf I had the keyboard working and then unplugged the mac from the dock, when I plug it back in, it works fine.  UNLESS I had opened the laptop and used the built-in keyboard in the meantime.  Then when I plug it in, the keyboard does a slow flash and the mac shows no evidence that it can connect.\nSome arbitrary, looong amount of time later, maybe 20-30 minutes, it finally gets around to connecting, taking no action on my part as far as I can tell.  Attempting to manually pairing it in the bluetooth settings doesn't do anything, nor does pressing the button to connect on the keyboard (referring to the source-1, source-2, source-3 buttons to the right of the F-keys).  The keyboard has only ever been used with this machine.\nMy guess is that it's only connecting through Bluetooth.  Is it not designed to actually be able to connect through USB-C to the computer itself?  Like, is that cord JUST for power?  That feels like a pretty moronic design choice.  But if that's so, is there anything I need to do to make the keyboard reconnect quickly and automatically?\n\nA: The Logitech MX Keys is a wireless keyboard that uses either Bluetooth LE (low energy) or the Logitech Unifying wireless receiver. The USB cable is for charging only. \nSo, excluding the USB connection from your question, this comes down to the following possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth Issue\n\n*Defective Keyboard\n\n\nYou might have interference issues with your BT (AirPort card) on your Mac. To isolate, remove the dock and try pairing. If that doesn’t work, try pairing with the USB receiver. But to get a solid diagnosis of your BT adapter, try a different device to ensure it connects as it should \nAs for your keyboard, try pairing with another computer. If the symptoms persist, it’s the keyboard and it should be returned.   If they don’t, then you’ve definitely narrowed it down to your Mac. \n", "Q: How come the Podcast app is hogging so much GPU? I have a 15 inch 2015 MacBook Pro with Catalina installed, and I was wondering why my fans go nuts when I play a podcast with the Podcasts app. Htop didn’t show any unusual CPU activity, but then I noticed from iStats that the GPU was blasting pretty high.\nJust wondering is this how it should work? I was in the impression that it’s the CPU that handles audio playback. I don’t remember this happening in iTunes.\nYou see the sharp valley in the graph when I paused the pod:\n\n\nA: Not an answer, but I was looking for an answer to the same question when I found switching workspaces away from the one with podcasts up dropped GPU utilization. So even with a podcast still playing, GPU usage goes back to ~0 if you aren't looking at the actual app. So it might be the app visualization is the real culprit.

Then restore your data from your backup, but not any apps or Library folders.\n\nA: Hacking is not what you think it is; it social engineering.\nThere's no hacker that's going to spend time on your computer making it do \"things\" to interfere with your workflow.  They are after information that will allow them to get to the next \"hop\" or system that you're connected to.

Basically, your system will wake periodically to do some maintenance tasks.\nAs far as your logs go, it looks fine, but there's simply not enough to paint a clear picture - your sample size is too small and does not indicate any nefarious activity.\nUnless you were installing software from unsigned developers and just putting in your admin password willy-nilly, there's really no reason to believe you're hacked. \nWith all that said, one of the best defenses against being hacked from a common threat - ransomware - is to have a backup.  In this case, where you are actually the target, having a backup of all your data renders their attack moot. Yes they encrypt your files and ruin your day, but you're not out any money and back up and running in the time it takes to wipe your disk, re-install macOS and restore your data.\n", "Q: Switching SIM cards or switching to a secret 2nd number What would show up in my router logs if i was switching SIM cards or switching to a secret 2nd number .

Both connections are on a different network.\nIs there any way where I can use the internet service from Wi-Fi connection and local file transfer using from the Ethernet cable?\n\nA: *\n\n*On your Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, then click Network.\n\n*Click the Action pop-up menu , then choose Set Service Order.\n\n*Drag services into the order you want.\n\n*Click OK, then click Apply to make the new settings active.\n", "Q: Does WhatsApp duplicate files when I share them with different contacts If I share the same file (say, an image or a video) across multiple contacts in WhatsApp, does the app create multiple copies of the same file (increasing the storage use)? Or is it smart enough to link always to the same file, from each different chat?\n\nA: Only the developer of the iOS client app can answer this. Basically, the answer depends on how the WhatsApp iOS client manage the files locally.\nThe most reasonable approach would be to avoid duplication by using some kind of mechanism to identify a media file's identify and maintain a single on-disk copy.\nWhile this could be attested to based on empirical evidence, only the actual developer of the app can give an affirmative answer to this.\n", "Q: Does Little Little Snitch 4 block connections during login? I have been using Little Snitch for some time now.\nI think the version I've started to use the program with, was 3.5.\nAnyway, I remember seeing notifications from Little Snitch about connection attempts during login, and then these appeared as 'Suggested rules' in the configuration.\nRecently I had to reinstall OS and all the programs on my Mac mini.\nI have installed the latest Little Snitch (4.4.3 that is), but after reboot I have not seen notification about connection attempts during login, nor was there a 'Suggested rules' section in the configuration.\nIn release notes for Little Snitch 3.*, it is mentioned (bold is mine):\n\nLittle Snitch offers rule suggestions based on Silent Mode\n  connections, former, already expired temporary rules, login\n  connections and more.\n\nThough, no mention of login connections in release notes for Little Snitch 4.*. I have found an old thread on official forum, but again - it is about Little Snitch 3.*\nThe question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Little Snitch 4.* 'inherit' the functionality of blocking connections during login from it's predecessor (i.e. Little Snitch 3.*)?\n\n\n*\n\n*If yes, does it have to be enabled in any special way?\n\n\n\n\nP.S.: I do realize that this question would be more appropriate at the official forum of the Little Snitch developers, but registration there is closed (for like a year now).\n\nA: From Little Snitch itself…\n\nLogin Connections\nWhile no user is logged in or a login is in progress, Little Snitch\ncannot display Connection Alerts. It therefore creates suggestions for\nall connection attempts that occur during that time.\nSee the Little Snitch Help, chapter Rule suggestions for more\ninformation.\n\n\n& detail from just the first entry in that table…\n\nOn 27 10 2019, ARDAgent tried to establish a connection to\n100.102.5.131. The request was denied automatically during login.\n\nSo, yes, it will block attempts by default until you edit the suggestions into actual approved rules.\n", "Q: Is there any way to downgrade my Mac mini to Mojave 10.14.3?

What is the problem? so I am assuming the following problems are all connected as they all appeared more or less at the same time, so please allow me to quickly recap: I have a Macbook mid 2012, 10.13.6 High Sierra.\nHalf a year ago my Macbook wouldn't start (\"prohibitory\"-signal). Went to repair shop. Told me it was the internal hard drive cable, which after some time can get too hot, apparently a common issue for this model. Changed it, everything runs fine again.\nSome months later (this week): Macbook is starting to behave slowly, gets stuck, with a spinning wait cursor which I can still move but it would not react when clicking on stuff. Then, after a while it would allow me to do something again, before going back into spinning wait cursor. Silly me was thinking, mh, let's restart, but hey, there is anyhow this system update waiting! So in one moment of control, I clicked to update: it downloaded and restarted. After restarting the update would be stuck after like half a centimeter progress. I waited more than half a hour. No progress, so I forced a shutdown. After restart, new problem: it would simply freeze when I enter my login information and not start the system.\nAgain, I went to the repair shop. Eventually he would try again replacing the internal hard drive cable. That solved the issue again. I told him that the one cable I got recently was not old. He said, it's because FileVault can cause this which he recommended me to deactivate. Back at home I try exactly that. \nProblem 1: Filevault decryption is stuck and wouldn't progress, it always says \"two hours remaining\". Also after \"restart\" (see 2.), it stays the same saying two hours remaining.\nProblem 2: A clean restart is impossible. When trying to shut down or restart, it would stay forever at this black screen where you only see this rotating loading icon. So, I always have to force shutdown, then start again.\nProblem 3: Another thing which is new, that suddenly I cannot login to my iCloud sometimes (weirdly it worked in the Appstore, but never in Mail)\nProblem 4: also appeared just now. When I am in the university using their Wlan, I have to re-enter my login information every time after the macbook was in standby mode. This seems unrelated, but it never happened before.\nProblem 5: Maybe also unrelated, but only occurred now, so probably not. A program (ableton) would suddenly not start anymore and simply say that it cannot be opened. I also cannot find it under applications anymore which never happened before.\nDisk Utility says it could not deactivate starting volume but found errors that would have to be repaired by disk utility in recovery mode.\nOther than that it said (excerpt):\n\"\n...\nChecking the APFS suberblock.\nChecking the object map.\nwarning: omap (oid 0x9a2c3): invalid om_flags (0x4)\nerror: om: btn: invalid o_oid (0x8f422)\nObject map is invalid.\nThe volume /dev/rdisk1s1 could not be verified completely.\n...\n\"\nOne thing that kinda bothers me is, I am still not sure if the beforementioned update was installed after all. In the app store it does not show up under \"recently installed updates\", it is simply gone.\nI will probably try to do as disk utility says, and repair from recovery mode, however I am a bit hesitant as I am new to Macbooks, and not familiar with these recovery routines, what it entails, whether data loss is possible etc. So before I wanted to ask if it's maybe a known issue.\nLast thing: I have a TimeMachine backup basically from one day before this whole mess (before the thing with the update happened). Does this help? I feel the issue is somehow deeper.\nAny ideas? Thanks in advance\n\nA: I think you have received some bad advice from the repair shop, unfortunately.\nIt is correct that the 13\" MacBook Pro 2012 model have issues with the internal hard drive cable. It hasn't got anything to do with overheating though. It is also incorrect that FileVault have anything at all to do with the cable problem.\nThe cable problems comes from the fact that the original cable was designed slightly too thin, while the inside of the casing is not completely smooth. Over time the friction between the two can cause the cable to fail.\nYou can replace the cable with another cable of the same type, which you indicate the repair shop did. The problem will just occur again. \nThe permanent way to fix it is to replace the cable with a new type of cable that is slightly thicker. This is what Apple does if you take the computer to them. Another way to fix it is simply to add a piece of smooth tape to the case where the cable runs, so that friction is reduced.\n\nYou can find detailed instructions on how to apply the tape here:\nhttps://beetstech.com/blog/prevent-a1278-mid-2012-hard-drive-cable-failure\nYou currently have issues with the file system on disk. This could be caused by problems with that cable - but it could also be the disk itself failing.\nI would recommend fixing the cable issue as described above, and then restoring the known good backup you have. Make sure to do disk checks to make sure the disk is OK - if you get disk errors again, it's reasonable to assume the disk is broken and needs replacement.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi indicator disappearing when iPad connects to Macbook over usb When I connect my iPad Pro to my Macbook Pro using a usb cable, for some reason the iPad loses its wifi connection.\nWhy does this happen and how do I fix it?\nI tried to setup shared internet to fix this issue, but it does not help.\n\n\nA: The settings you show will indeed shut off networking on the iPad when you connect it since the Mac is telling the iPad to get network over the USB cable.\nYou would disable the iPad USB check box or disable internet sharing altogether so that the iPad doesn’t change network settings next time you plug it in to that specific mac.\n", "Q: Where is battery data stored on macbooks? Apps like CoconutBattery can display various data on a MacBook battery like\n\n\n*\n\n*Manufacturing date\n\n*Design capacity\n\n*Current capacity\n\n*Wear level\n\n\nOnce you swap a battery the application can instantly detect and get data from the new battery. This makes me believe that the data is stored on the battery itself.\nWhere is all this (MacBook) battery data stored? On the battery itself?\n\nA: That info is stored on the battery itself.  With the exception of current capacity which is calculated, everything else is stored on the battery’s control chip.\nUsually, on the same PCB as the battery protection circuit there’s a control chip that balances the voltage, measures capacity etc.  It’s on this chip that things like the serial number, cycle count, etc, are stored.  This is why when changing out a battery this info is “reset” without having to do anything on your Mac.\nAs for utilities like Coconut Battery, they’re good, but you can get the same info for free with built in commands.\n", "Q: Disable iPhone location prompts For my work, I have to use an application that needs \"Always On\" location on my iPhone (latest iOS 13), but every day (sometimes twice a day) I have the \"X is tracking your location.\" prompt. I answer \"Always on\" every time, but every day they ask me again...\nIs there a way to see these pop-ups less often, or to completely deactivate them ?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there’s no “don’t ask me again” option. iOS 13 will keep asking you about the apps using your location in the background unless you tap “Change to Only While Using.” iOS won’t warn you about apps that can only access your location while you’re using them.\n", "Q: MBP Late 2011 macOS Sierra - First Time Kernel Panic - Looking to see if anyone knows the cause based on the log I woke up this morning to find my Macbook pro (running macOS 10.12.6 [16G2136], 13inch, late 2011, 2.8 GHz i7, 8GB of 1067 MHz DDR3 RAM) had rebooted.

Right now I am doing a clean install of Catalina. I have erased the Macintosh HD and the Macintosh HD -Data. When I tried to install the OS it gave me these two choices again. I couldn’t find anything on apple’s website on this choice of drives. I chose now the Macintosh HD because it is defined as the system drive but I am not sure. I would be happy if you provide some information or a reference about this.\n\nA: What worked for me was erasing the parent volume of these partitions as \"Macintosh HD\", leaving one partition.\nAnother option, as per lx08's comment, is to delete \"Macintosh HD - Data\" and erase \"Macintosh HD\".\n", "Q: How to compile OSS binaries to replace the versions shipped with OS X? I want to compile new versions of openssl, bash, and similar unix tools in the same way that Apple would. I want to link against the OS's built-in libraries where possible, and I want to copy the resulting binaries into /usr/bin, replacing what Apple ships with OS X. \nI am aware that this is usually a terrible idea, for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*An OS X update might reinstate Apple's binaries, undoing your work and leaving your system in an unknown state.\n\n*Some software may depend on the specific behavior of Apple's binaries.\n\n\nInstead, it is generally recommended that mac users install custom binaries alongside Apple's system binaries. Both homebrew and MacPorts operate under this principle.\nHowever, I'm running Mavericks, which will never receive another software update from Apple. The Apple binaries on my system have known security vulnerabilities, which IMO outweighs theoretical compatibility concerns.\nIs there a standard way to go about this, or would it be different for every program? Can I somehow leverage parts of e.g. the MacPorts project to make the process easier, or do I need to install all compilation dependencies from scratch?\nIf this just isn't realistically feasible, I'd like to know that too.\n\nA: You will need to individually check and build every program, although the process for most programs is fairly similar.\nYou might be able to take some inspiration from MacPorts/Homebrew in their recipes, but I doubt that you can use them 1:1 as they typically feature versions that differ greatly from the Apple supplied utilities. For example by offering GNU versions of supplied BSD utilities, or by offering something that is a completely different major version.\nAs an example of this, I saw that you received a comment on your question recommending you to install \"openssl\" for example. This can be quite tricky, as if you install \"openssl\", you actually get something substantially different than what Apple actually supplies with macOS today. If you run the command \"openssl\" on a modern Mac, you'll actually be running something called LibreSSL. You'll have to make an individual choice for each and every software package such as this to determine if you want to go with Apple's choice (LibreSSL), or a new major version of OpenSSL. \nI think the most feasible route is to go to Apple's open source web site:\nhttps://opensource.apple.com\nHere'll you find the source for the utilities that came with your 10.9 system. Using that list, I would go through the sources for 10.15 and find the same programs.\nThis will often give you security patched versions of the same major version or at least very similar programs to the ones that came with your 10.9 system. If you're lucky, they compile without problems. In some cases, you'll run into stuff that is only supported on newer operating systems, and then you'll have to work around it by modifying the program, or going back to an older version.\nAll in all, it is going to be a lot of work!\n", "Q: How to use Node.js without admin rights on a mac?

I'm wondering how I can install Node.js on mac without having admin rights.\nI found a tutorial, which is for Windows but still has been helpful. But, I'm stuck at the \"Configure the PATH\" step where I have to add to the $PATH variable.

It should be\nPATH=\"a/b/c\":\"$PATH\"\n\nIn this window, this PATH will be used. verify using echo $PATH\n\nA: I ended up using nvm to install node because you don't need admin rights to do that.

The components involved are a Mac Mini (Late 2012) running 10.13.6 and a Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 USB audio interface.\nStarting two days ago, audio output would stop after some amount of playback, ranging from a few seconds to 10 minutes.  While playback is broken, recording has been working correctly.  The system has had no software upgrades or installations in the past few weeks.\nSwitching the Scarlett to a different USB port caused everything to start working again temporarily.  When it failed on the new port, switching back to the original also worked temporarily.\nSuggested fixes such as trashing audio preferences and doing a SMC reset have had no effect.\nAttaching the Scarlett to an obsolete MacBook Pro (Mid 2009) running 10.11.6 doesn't seem to produce any problems.\nEDIT:\nI was able to update to Mojave (thereby avoiding the Catalina trauma) but it resulted in no change to the symptoms.\n\nA: I had a similar issue on High Sierra with a Line6 interface; slightly different as the audio would fail if I left the machine alone for a while. It didn't sleep, my machines never do, but after some unknown period of time the audio would fail.\nWhen it did this it would also cause any video to fail too - endlessly spinning pizza wheel when on VLC or YouTube etc.\nMy temporary fix at the time was to toggle my output's output frequency in Audio MIDI Setup, 44.1 to 48 & back again [or vice versa] which would be fine for another day or so.\nThe issue went away with Mojave [as did many other issues High Sierra was plagued with].\n\nA: I had the same experience with High Sierra, where a USB audio interface (not the same one) also would stop working after a while. Switching USB ports and/or rebooting would fix it - temporarily. The problem appeared seemingly out of nowhere, and wouldn't go away.\nI fixed it by upgrading to Mojave, and haven't seen it since.\n", "Q: How to delete a word, which was typed mistakenly, from Safari autocomplete recommendations?

By default the back camera should produce images at 4032×3024 pixels.\nI would suggest the following to ensure that you're grabbing a correct picture:\n\n*\n\n*Use the built-in camera app\n\n\n*Ensure that no other apps are running at the same time (especially nothing should be used the camera for video)\n\n\n*Ensure that the dial at the bottom of the camera view is set to \"Photo\"\n\n\n*Ensure that you're using the back camera of the iPhone (i.e. not \"selfie mode\")\nTake a photo and check its resolution using this method:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Photos app and find your photo\n\n\n*Press the Share button in the lower left corner\n\n\n*Choose \"Saves to Files\" and save it on iCloud Drive or on the phone\n\n\n*Open the Files app\n\n\n*Find the photo in the list\n\n\n*Long-press the photo to get a popup menu\n\n\n*Choose \"Info\" in the popup menu\nYou can now see the actual resolution of the photo listed.\nI have a suspicion that you might be sending the photo to someone else or a computer or similar using MMS, Messenger or similar, and that program is altering the resolution before you check it.\nTherefore it is important that you transfer the photo using a method that preserves its full resolution.\nThat could be for example using iCloud Photo Library to sync it with your computer, or it could be using AirDrop to transfer the photo.\n", "Q: No iMovie Main Window All of a sudden, starting up iMovie doesn't give me a main editing window.

Just because you can squeeze Mojave onto an old Mac doesn't mean you should.\nMojave needs a Metal-capable GPU & iMovie is very probably using Metal.\nEven a 5.1 can't run Mojave without one, let alone a 3,1. \nThe 3,1 isn't supposed to be able to run anything newer than El Cap, so why not try going back to that?\n", "Q: Is there any way to use my old Logitech Quickcam Express on Catalina? I have an old Logitech Quickcam Express - the one that looks like this:\n\nI have a 2018 MacBook Pro running Catalina, and I'd like (if possible) to use the webcam with it.  If I plug it in, I can see it in System Information:\n\n...but I can't use it in Photo Booth nor in Google Meets in Chrome (which is where I'd actually like to use it).  Is there anything I can do so that I can use the webcam with my Mac?\n\nA: Generally speaking as long as the webcam is a standard USB video device, it will work as those drivers are included with macOS.\nHowever, those vintage webcams required Logitech drivers to be installed as it was a DSC WIA device per C|Net so it needed a Mac specific driver.  What you’re seeing is that the webcam is detected and identified, it just doesn’t have the proper drivers to work. \n\nA: Not trying to be flippant, but I haven't seen that camera since the waning years of the 20th century. (It was released in 1999, BTW.) According to this FAQ page at Logitech, it is unsupported 'on the Macintosh platform'. It will not work on a USB3 port, and there are no macOS drivers.

MacBook Pro mid 2010 system reports 2 disks (320G and SSD) while About this Mac-> Storage only shows one disk. This Mac -> Storage shows only one disk: 320G. I have tried to use diskutil list, it shows two disks as well.\nWonder what causes the different disk configurations?  MBP runs normally. Should I care about the difference?\nFurthermore occasionally the Storage shows two disks, (not sure when), including 320G and the SSD, then the MacBook Pro crashed very often, say, every 15 minutes. \n\n\n\nPlease help and thanks a million.\n\nA: You clearly have two separate devices: one a 5400rpm rotational hard drive, and the other an 'after-market' Intel SSD of 160 Gb.\nThere's limited space in an MBP, so is it possible that your optical (DVD) drive has been replaced with a housing for an SSD?\nIf you set Finder preferences to show hard disks on the Desktop, does the SSD show up?\nCrashes could be caused by a defective SATA connector, either to the SSD or to your hard drive. These parts are known to fail: you can buy replacements very cheaply. If the connector to the SSD is failing, that might also explain why it's missing.\nWith a 10-year-old mechanical drive and a possibly failing connector to a third-party SSD installed in the optical drive bay, you might want to open it up, replace the hard drive with a new, large-capacity SSD, and investigate any physical problems with the existing SSD and housing.\n", "Q: Running iMac 2009 on external screen due to Broken LCD So I would like to know if it is possible to diagnose and install new OSX using blank SSD in an iMac that has broken LCD and no hard drive?\nI bought this iMac out of auction where you cant test anything and buy as-is, and looks like I'm in deep trouble as the display doesn't work and it has no hard drive. The iMac chimes with Apple sound when turned on so that tells me motherboard is working.\n\nA: Yes it is possible to diagnose and install macOS on an iMac with a broken LCD and missing hard drive.\nThe iMac all-in-ones from that vintage has a mini Display Port for a second display.  It supports Leopard through El Capitan.  Here’s what you’ll need at a minimum:\n\n\n*\n\n*A mini display port to VGA, DVI, or HDMI adapter, depending on the monitor you’re hooking up to.\n\n*A bootable USB - either an installer or a USB with a full installation on it.  You can create an installer by following one of the many guides found online.  If you want to use the full install, you’ll need to install macOS to a USB flash (64GB is sufficient) or a USB hard drive.\n\n\nAs for a keyboard, I’m assuming it comes with one, but if it doesn’t, you don’t need an Apple one; a cheap USB keyboard will work fine.

If I type hostname at the terminal I still get the proper name but it keeps changing the name that would appear on the network.\nIs there any progress or fix on this front or will this always be a bug in Mac OS?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a terminal.\n\n*Type the following command to change the primary hostname of your Mac:\n\nThis is your fully qualified hostname, for example, myMac.domain.com\n\n sudo scutil --set HostName <new host name>\n\n\n\n*Type the following command to change the Bonjour hostname of your Mac:\n\n\n\nThis is the name usable on the local network, for example myMac.local.\n\nsudo scutil --set LocalHostName <new host name>\n\n\n\n*If you also want to change the computer name, type the following command:\n\n\n\nThis is the user-friendly computer name you see in Finder, for example\n  myMac.\n\n sudo scutil --set ComputerName <new name>\n\n\n\n*Flush the DNS cache by typing:\ndscacheutil -flushcache\n\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\nA: Had this issue for a long time with our 500+ Macs.  Our setup was the Meraki Wifi with about 60 AP's on 3 floors and all dhcp/routing handled by the Fortigate firewalls.\nUsers were floating about the office plugging into both wifi and ethernet simultaneously.  Tried pretty much everything from flattening the network, reducing VLANS, reducing the scope so that there wasn't an abundance of unused IP addresses available, and a lot of onboard Mac configuration trials with the hostname and static IP trials.  Still the overall feeling is that it had to be related to the MDNSResponder, maybe being too slow to switch networks and update DNS.  But finally it was a simple change for us.  Our Network vendors (we had actually 2 working on the same issue for us) directed us to try Disabling Bonjour Forwarding.\nWe went into the Meraki Console and Disabled Bonjour Forwarding.  Instant fix.  I hope the picture below shows it, but its basically\nConsole > Wireless > SSIDS > Edit the SSID in question (we did all of them) then scroll down like in the picture to \"Disable Bonjour Forwarding\".\nHope that helps.\n\n", "Q: Apple Coverage theft and loss I am planning to buy iPhone 11 Pro in US and move to India.\nIf I buy the iPhone and add AppleCare+ with theft and loss coverage, would I be covered in India?\n\nA: Apple legal agreements are at https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/\nThe theft plan is specific to each US state, so you might have to read the entire document so you are comfortable with it.\nJust as in the past, the plan may not cover you outside the country of purchase per the contract wording for the state of Minnesota plan.\n\n4.1 Coverage Area\nWe may restrict your coverage benefit to the country where the Covered Device was originally purchased subject to section 6.2.\n\nAssuming you have any coverage event other than loss, the new coverage looks the same as in the past.

I want to terminate multiple processes from the list in one go. \nI've tried highlighting the processes but nothing shows up when I double click the highlighted block. \nIs there another way to terminate a highlighted block of processes via Activity Monitor?\n\nA: Activity Monitor does not allow you select multiple processes to kill them simultaneously. You would need a different application to take that design goal into account and implement it.\nThe only exception would be if your selection happened to be all part of the same process tree where you could kill the parent process and expect all children to receive the termination signal. But that’s how the OS works and not about Activity Monitor’s design.\nNow, workarounds to do what you ask in other ways:\nKilling Multiple Processes with same name\nUsing Terminal, you can kill several processes at once:\npgrep -i <process name> | xargs kill\n\nThis has the benefit of killing all the processes of, say, Firefox (I have multiple instances of Firefox running all the time) and can kill them with one command.\nThe -i flag tells pgrep to ignore case so, \"Firefox\" = \"firefox\" = \"fireFox\", etc.\nKilling Multiple Different Processes\nUse the OR operator to kill multiple processes with different names:\npgrep -i \"<process name 1>|<process name 2>\" | xargs kill\n\nIt's very, very rare that all the identically named, but discrete process have hung up simultaneously, so I prefer to address each on individually to see where the issue manifests.  So, I don't recommend it as a regular \"go to\", but it will get the job done.\n\nA: I would suggest you to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal\n\n*When Terminal has launched, type \"top\" into the Terminal window. You'll see a list of currently running processes. At the top of the list is an overview of the processes that are running and the resources they're consuming.\n\n*When you identify a process that's causing a problem or consuming too many resources, take note of the number in the PID column next to the name of the process. To kill the process, type \"kill -9\" followed by the PID number. Press Enter. The problem process will now quit.\n\n\nA: Highlight/select them and go to View menu > Quit Process.\nThis works in 10.15+ macOS versions.\n", "Q: How to Enable QuickPath (Swipe) keyboard on iPad iOS 13 delivered a a new “swipe to type” keyboard called QuickPath.  New features available with iOS 13.  This is similar to the Word Flow on Windows Phones and the Swipe Keyboard for Android.\n\nIt’s enabled by default on the iPhone, but not on the iPad. How can I enable this useful feature?\n\nA: This requires the floating keyboard.\nTo use the floating keyboard, simply use the “pinch” gesture on the keyboard as if you were “pinching to zoom out.” The floating keyboard will appear.  You can then use the QuickPath (swipe) keyboard functionality.\nIf you need to move the keyboard, simply drag it by holding the grey bar at the bottom and dragging it to your desired location.\nTo restore the keyboard back to full size, either drag it to the bottom of the screen or use the \"pinch out\" gesture.\n", "Q: Catalina - find: .: Operation not permitted from launchAgent I've created a launch agent that uses the find command to look in the downloads folder of a user\nfiles_to_remove=(`cd ~/Downloads/ && find . \\( -name \"*.csv\" -or -name \"*.pdf\" -or -name \"*.sav\" -or -name \"*.tsv\" -or -name \"*.zip\" -or -name \"*.qsf\" \\) -mtime +5`)\n\nHere is the plist file I've added to the LaunchAgents folder with a 10-second interval to help debug.\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>local.downloadsCleanup</string>\n        <key>Program</key>\n        <string>/Library/Application Support/downloadsCleanup/downloadsCleanup.sh</string>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n        <string>/tmp/downloadsCleanup.err</string>\n        <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n        <string>/tmp/downloadsCleanup.out</string>\n        <key>StartInterval</key>\n        <integer>10</integer>\n    </dict>\n</plist>\n\nEverytime the LaunchAgent runs is get the error\nfind: .: Operation not permitted\n\nHowever, running the /Library/Application Support/downloadsCleanup/downloadsCleanup.sh script from the terminal prompts me to give permission to the terminal to access the downloads folder.

(disk connected via USB 3)\n\n*When I selected the disk for Time Machine, Time Machine itself formatted it to Mac OS Extended (journaled, encrypted). It then ran a successful backup, after that it encrypts the disk - what logic is that? Did it first write the files unencrypted, then it encrypts the files? Really?\n\nA: Regarding your first question, it is hard to say exactly \"why\" it is slow. There's multiple factors involved - obviously reading in and writing out 6 TB of data from an external hard drive is going to take some time. If we say your drive does 100 MB/s (which might be very optimistic for some drives if we're looking at small transfers), then that alone takes approx. 18 hours.\nAdd to that the time needed to encrypt and validate the data as well as overhead. I doubt that the process is optimized for taking the shortest time - rather it is optimized to affect the rest of the system the least, so that you can keep working on your computer while it runs.\nRegarding your second question: No, it does not first write the files unencrypted and then encrypts them afterwards. The files are written to disk in encrypted form.  However, you should note that when you encrypt the drive, you're not only encrypting the files you transfer to it right now, but all the blocks on the drive (used or non-used for your data).\n", "Q: AppleScript 'choose from list'. How can I run a different command if multiple sections are chosen? I have an AppleScript which manages my home made After Effects render farm. The farm is made up of three render machines.\nThe script asks the user to make a selection of what machine(s) they want to render on. It takes their choice(s) and runs an external AppleScript app depending on what choice(s) they made.\nEach external AppleScript app runs a command which starts an After Effects render using ExtendScript like this…\nset scriptfile to (POSIX file (\"/Applications/Render Farm/Scripts/jsx/render_1.jsx\"))\ntell application \"Adobe After Effects 2020\"\n    DoScriptFile scriptfile\nend tell\n\nThe JSX file referenced above tells After Effects to start a render on Render Machine 1. The idea of the master script is that the user can select multiple render machines and start them all rendering at once.\n   set Options to {\"Render Node 1\", \"Render Node 2\", \"Render Node 3\"}\n\n        set ListA to (choose from list Options with prompt \"Choose items\" with title \"Select Stuff\" with multiple selections allowed)\n\n   if (ListA contains \"Render Node 1\") then\n        tell application \"Render Node 1 App\" to activate\n    end if\n\n    if (ListA contains \"Render Node 2\") then\n        tell application \"Render Node 2 App\" to activate\n    end if\n\n    if (ListA contains \"Render Node 3\") then\n        tell application \"Render Node 3 App\" to activate\n    end if\n\nMy script allows multiple choices to accomplish this, but I hate how sequential it is. After Effects has to receive the first AppleScript command, then run the JSX command which ssh's into the render machine, then it opens the aerender command line program multiple times per machine (each instance can take about 10-15 seconds to open). Only after the last aerender instance has opened is After Effects finally ready to listen for another AppleScript command and do it all over again for the second machine.\nHowever, I have a different JSX command that can start a render on all render machines at the same time from within After Effects with no waiting around. I also have other ones that can start a render on Render Node 1 & 2, Render Node 1 & 3, and Render Node 2 & 3 (basically a different script for each combination.\nI would like to do the same thing within my AppleScript master script. But I don't want to display a list of every possible combination, I want something that works more elegantly.\nWhat I would like is to modify the master script so that if, for example, two selections are detected then it doesn't run two scripts, it just runs a different script.\nSomething like this, but with working syntax…\n   if (ListA contains \"Render Node 1\" and \"Render Node 2\") then\n        tell application \"Render Node 1 & 2 App\" to activate\n    end if\n\nWhen I run that, I get the error \"Can’t make \"Render Node 2\" into type boolean.\" But surely there's a way to accomplish this?\nIt also has to work intelligently.

With that said though, you could add a line of code that would create the necessary hierarchal directory structure first, as in the example below:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor d in *; do\n    [[ -d $d ]] || continue\n    if [[ $d =~ ^([A-Z])([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})$ ]]; then\n        mkdir -p \"./Documents/Archive/${BASH_REMATCH[1]}/${BASH_REMATCH[3]}\"\n        mv -n -v \"$d\" \"./Documents/Archive/${BASH_REMATCH[1]}/${BASH_REMATCH[3]}/\"\n    fi\ndone\n\n\nThe one-liner compound command would be:\nfor d in *; do [[ -d $d ]] || continue; if [[ $d =~ ^([A-Z])([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})$ ]]; then mkdir -p \"./Documents/Archive/${BASH_REMATCH[1]}/${BASH_REMATCH[3]}\"; mv -n -v \"$d\" \"./Documents/Archive/${BASH_REMATCH[1]}/${BASH_REMATCH[3]}/\"; fi; done\n\n\nI'd use this version of the compound command and or bash script.\n\nNote: Using the -p option with the mkdir command will create the hierarchal directory structure as needed without erring out if it already exists. This would be that way I'd go just to make sure you do not try moving a source directory to a nonexistent destination directory.\n", "Q: I can't set a HTTP-Proxy on my wifi anymore Anyone have an idea how to fix this?\nI press save but still it isn't saved.. or being used?\n\n\nA: You should try to :\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on \"Forget this network\", search for this wifi, enter the password and try to set your proxy again\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network settings and try again\n\n", "Q: How do I export Notes from iphone to PC with images? I have keeping track of my expenses within the notes app on my iPhone. It consists of a series of headings and pictures of receipts for the entire month. How can I get this on my PC in some format with pictures included?\n\nA: If you do not require your notes to be in Notes format on your PC as well, you can email each note to yourself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Notes app on your iPhone,\n\n*Get into the note you want to transfer to your PC,\n\n*Tap the share button (top right),\n\n*Choose Mail and input your email address,\n\n*Check the mail on your PC.\n\n\nYou can then copy the contents of the note in the email and paste them into a document for further use or download the attachments to your computer. Some attachments, like photos, may not show in the mail correctly. If that happens, you need to click the show image option (depending on which email service you use) to view the pictures. \nThese directions have been excerpted from easeus.com. Hope they help.\n\nA: There is an app named Note2txt that will very quickly convert all your notes from the Notes app to text files, but it doesn't include images. The app lets you choose a folder to put all the text files. Then you can copy or email all you wish to a new destination.\nIf you have images I suggest you look under the file menu item in Notes.

I use a 200MB Ram disk to write some throwaway files that I use repeatedly but can forget from run to run and don't mind losing on a shutdown.

There's no need for a RAM disk to have partitions, or a partitioning table, or an EFI boot partition. (Go ahead, try booting from a RAM disk! I'll wait.)\nAll that's needed here is a partitionless disk image, formatted in APFS and consisting of a single APFS container, enclosing a single APFS volume. That's easy with the \"diskutil apfs create\" verb. Furthermore, we should add a tweak to prevent macOS from wasting cycles trying to Spotlight-index that volume. Putting those two things together yields the following single command line (note that I'm using \"SIZE\" as a placeholder):\n diskutil apfs create $(hdiutil attach -nomount ram://SIZE) RAMDisk && touch /Volumes/RAMDisk/.metadata_never_index\n\nThat's it. \"SIZE\" will be the integer number of 512-byte blocks you want the RAM disk to comprise. For example, a RAM disk of 1GiB (1,073,741,824 bytes) would be specified with the number \"2097152\" (without the quote marks).\n", "Q: Does iPhone need to be Unlocked GSM to work in Cuba? My sister who lives in Cuba, wants me to bring her an iPhone on my next trip.  I am looking at ones that are unlocked, open box as they are less expensive, but I need to know if it has to say \"GSM unlocked.\"  \nThanks for any help. I just don't want to take one that won't work on Cuba's cellular network.\n\nA: As far as I can tell, any iPhone should be compatible with GSM. But the sticker on the back of the box is supposed to explicitly say what it's compatible with, so you can see that.\nNote that phones provided by some carriers might support slightly different bands than phones from other carriers. I believe Cuba uses 900 MHz, and I would imagine all iPhones support that, but I did not check all models. But if there is a specific one you are going to get, you can check a website like WhistleOut to double-check that the phone supports this. You can google something like 'WhistleOut will my iPhone 8 work on another carrier', and the article will go over the variants of the phone coming from the different carriers and show what frequencies they support, so you can double-check.\nIf it's open box though, you do want to ensure that it will actually work, that it's not activated and associated with someone else's Apple ID, that kind of thing. If it's a fresh installation and it would work when you pop in your own SIM card (it does have to be the right size SIM card, probably a nano-SIM), then it should be fine for your sister too.\n\nA: An unlocked phone - it doesn't matter if it's iPhone or some other brand - basically means that the IMEI or MEID number isn't restricted to a particular carrier - it will work everywhere.  Simply put, these are fancy equipment ID and serial numbers the carriers use to authenticate the device whether it's allowed onto the network or not.\nSo, as far as unlocked goes, any unlocked phone should work on Cuba's cellular network.\nThe bigger concern is compatibility\nAccording the GSM Arena, Cuba uses \n\n\n*\n\n*GSM 900 for 2G networks\n\n*UMTS 900, UMTS 2100 (1) for 3G\n\n*No support for 4G\n\n\nWhat you have to do next, is look at the Technical Specifications for the iPhone you're interested in.  Using the iPhone 7 as an example, under Cellular & Wireless, we see that both of those frequencies are supported, so you should be fine.\n", "Q: Audio out of sync after exporting from iMovie I recorded a vlog on my iPhone 8+ and edited it in iMovie. When I play the video in iMovie, the audio is perfectly fine and in sync with the video. However, when I export it and upload it to YouTube, the audio is completely out of sync and always starts at a certain time. I’ve done everything I could find to fix this issue yet it persists. I’m extremely desperate and I’m looking for a solution that does not include re-editing the entire clip.\n\nA: I think I have a solution to your problem. I too was seeing this in iMovie and it turns out that if your audio track was sampled at 44.1 KHz, the export will likely mess up the audio sync. Fixing is quick and easy. Just take your audio track and resample it at 48 KHz. You can do this in a free tool like VLC. Then, bring in the new audio file, export your iMovie and it will work correctly.\n", "Q: What is macOS Server Good For? Apple have removed a number of services from macOS Server and moved other services, such as content caching, to the “normal” macOS.\nThat doesn’t leave much. So, what do I get for my purchase? What are the added features/benefits of macOS Server versus regular macOS?  Am I missing something important?\nEdit\nI have accepted an answer which basically says it’s no longer the same product.\nA few years ago I actually paid for the product for the features they removed. It’s not a hardship as my main server runs Linux.\nHowever, when I saw MacOS server in use in an office I thought it was an ideal alternative Linux to manage internal DNS, mail, file server, etc.\n\nA: macOS Server is now basically an MDM server, powerful in its own right, but all the traditional things we used to associate with Server, like network services, Open Directory, file serving, caching update server, i.e. the good old days, is gone.\nServer is geared now for education and business customers to maintain, administer and provision macOS and iOS devices. It scales down to providing much finer control of provisioning and administering iDevices and macOS machines for a large Apple-centric family with kids of several ages, for example.\n", "Q: What to do about a bad video card in a 2010 Mac? It seems it was just 2013 when Yan asked a question about a Mac showing a strange display. I'm now getting exactly that display, on a Mac that seems to me to be around the same vintage as Yan's, 2010.\nThe responses to Yan's question talked about plugging in an external monitor. But if the video card is bad, won't the image in the external monitor be just the same one Yan photographed? In other words, doesn't the video signal to every monitor emerge from the same bad video card?\nWhat can I do to retrieve the files from my Mac without allowing anyone else access to these files? I would be willing to replace the Mac if that would somehow facilitate. Is there really a way to just plug in another monitor, or some other new hardware, into the old Mac? If I have to take the Mac to the shop to replace the video card, will that allow the repair shop access to my files? Is there a way to get the files from the Mac without replacing the video card? What are my options?\n\nA: This answer is based on the assumption that you've got an iMac, however, the general solutions (not anything iMac specific) presented here will work for virtually any Mac model.\nUse Target Disk Mode\nIf you can boot your computer (even if the screen is dead) put it into Target Disk Mode by booting it while simultaneously holding the T key.  The computers need to be connected by a Thunderbolt or FireWire cable.  The iMacs from this vintage (through late 2011) all came with a FireWire port.  Thunderbolt didn't come onto the scene until 2012.\n\n\n*\n\n*FireWire Cable\n\n*Thunderbolt to Firewire Adapter - Only necessary if using a newer Mac with Thunderbolt ports\n\n\nOnce connected, you can boot the computers and copy the files over.\nRemove the Hard Drive\nSince your graphic card has died and they are quite expensive on the secondary market, it makes sense to simply extract the drive and connect it to a USB adapter to copy the files over.\nThe iMacs through late 2011 all came with the removable glass where you could simply use a couple of suction cups to pull the glass off.  The display panel was held in with 12 Torx screws.  Once removed, you have access to all of the components.  Ifixit has an excellent step-by-step guide to do this.\n\n\n\n\n* Source:  iFixit.com. Photo credit: Sam Goldheart and licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.\n\nRemove the HDD and connect it to another Mac with a USB to SATA Adapter with Power.  The drives in the iMac are 3.5\" so they need a 12V supply - more than what a USB port can provide by itself.  If you have a spare 3.5\" drive enclosure, that will work as well.\nAgain, once connected, you can copy your files over from the drive to your connected computer.\n\nA: You can get the year by going to About This Mac under the Apple Menu. If you know where on your computer the images are stored you can copy them to another external drive or onto a flash drive and once your sure they have copied properly you can delete them from your internal drive. If you do this the Apple repair person will have to use a data recovery tool to try and get your files back. In other words, it will require a deliberate act to recover them. If that's not secure enough then erasing your disk and overwriting it may be your only option. Or replace your internal drive. If you decide to copy them to a flash drive or external disk be sure not to take it with you to repair site. There are maybe other ways to do this. Future answers may offer a better solution. But this way will work.\n", "Q: FileVault encryption slow when idle: opposite expected I have been encrypting a number of external disk using FileVault and have noticed puzzling behavior.  The disks are external USB 3.0 disks.  \nWhen the process starts, I can see that the disk access proceeds at a reasonably snappy speed of ~35 MB/s using Activity Monitor.\nIf the computer is not touched for a while, the disk speed drops to a paltry ~5 MB/sec and will stay that way.  As soon as I touch the mouse or press a key, it jumps back to the ~35 MB/sec speed and will stay that way until it goes idle again.\nI would have expected just the opposite behavior.  Keeping the disk accesses low while the user is active provides a snappy UI experience.  Once the user is inactive, full bore access would seem to be the thing to do.  Can anyone explain this behavior?\nAn example is shown here.  Active disk while interacting with the computer, then slow disk after no interaction.  As soon as the mouse was wiggled, the speed went back up.\n\n\nA: There could be several reasons for this type of behaviour.\nIf you're on a battery-powered laptop, it might be that the system was designed to optimize run time on the battery. It could be that the 5 MB/sec mode is more power efficient than the 35 MB/sec mode.\nAnother reason could be that the encryption process needs good quality random numbers. It is often seen (across vendors, products and operating systems) that good quality random numbers require some form of user input or other external input to the system. Thus when the system is completely idle, the source of random numbers is slow (or runs out) - while just wiggling the mouse around can make the process much faster. It's not fully clear to me which part of the FileVault process you're working with, but I think you should be over the phase where random number generation is needed.\n", "Q: iCloud email bounce message: \"user is overquota\" Whenever I email a particular iCloud email address, I get a bounce message in return.\n\nSending to the @iCloud.com address from Gmail:\n\nDelivery incomplete\nMail Delivery Subsystem <mailer-daemon@googlemail.com>\nThere was a temporary problem delivering your message to example@icloud.com. Gmail will retry for 44 more hours.

Once that space is filled up, there's no more room to accept any more, including email.\nThe solution to this is for the user to \"clean up\" their mailbox and/or files they've stored on their account.  Most of the time, this is caused by someone never deleting email.  It can be remedied by deleting old obsolete mail.\nUnfortunately, you as the sender can't do anything, but contact the recipient by other means (phone call, text message, etc.) and let them know of the issue.\n", "Q: Why is this custom Mac Keyboard Shortcut not working? This is probably a very simple question by someone that has just started using custom keyboard shortcuts on Mac. I want to set up a shortcut for opening a terminal window in a given folder that's being reached by Finder. So I set up the following keyboard shortcut in the Settings app:\n\nI have even set it up both for the Apple Terminal and for iTerm to see if anything changes. However, even after setting the commands, I cannot make them work. I believe that, after browsing to a given folder through Finder, executing the shortcut should bring the terminal window, shouldn't it? Thanks a lot in advance!\n\nA: It seems you need to have a folder selected in Finder to make it work, it won't if you've got an empty selection or a file selected. \nAlso make sure that your keyboard shortcut is not used by any other function, it doesn't warn about it. (I tried CMD+CTRL+X, which seemed to work, but had trouble with many other combinations.)\n", "Q: iCloud for Windows 10: Unable to change location of Shared Photos folder I've recently moved my Pictures folder into a OneDrive folder on Windows. Within the Pictures folder I had my iCloud Photo folders; this required me to update the location of the various iCloud Photo folders in the iCloud settings. This works fine for the Download and Upload folders, but when I try to update the location for the Photo Sharing folder, it always resets to the previous location.\nHere's what it looks like before I've set it:\n\nNote the filepath for iCloud Photo Sharing is %USER%\\Pictures\\iCloud Photos\\Shared.\nHere's what it looks like after I click the change button and set it to the desired new location:\n\nNote that the iCloud Photo Sharing path is now %USER%\\OneDrive\\Pictures\\iCloud Photos\\Shared.\nIf I then click \"Done\" to exit to the main options panel, \"Apply\" to apply the changes, and re-enter the Photos Options panel, I see that the change didn't go through (though it noticeably has for the Download and Upload folders):\n\nHow can I move the folder and make it stick? It doesn't seem to be a conflict with OneDrive, since even if I direct it to a folder that's not archived by OneDrive, it won't keep the change for the Shared Photos location.\n\nA: After digging through the registry, I found the key that sets this location in Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Apple Inc.\\Internet Services\\iCloud Photos\\Settings. The way to fix this is to change the value of SharingPath to the desired location.\n", "Q: How can the check point on startup for macOS's T2 chip authentication be bypassed for securely signed OS's like RedHat? How can the checkpoint on startup for macOS's T2 chip authentication be bypassed for securely signed OS's like RedHat?\nI know after both drives within, say macOS Catalina for example, are mounted while in the root bash of a recovery partition, you can edit almost anything in either volume, but how does one get to the \"watchOS\" prefs/executions, to add to or modify the list of \"secure signed OS's\" you can boot with, even after the OS Security pref has been set in that recovery window to allow external drive booting?\nApple keeps claiming on all official documentation and forums that you can install Linux to a T2 enabled machine, but it doesn't appear this is true of booting (post install, even if UEFI equipped).\n\nA: You can set the security level for the T2 chip to allow the installation of Linux. However, if the Mac has internal drive (onboard PCIe-based SSD storage) which requires a driver that the version of Linux being installed does not have, then you will have to install to an external drive.\nApple has supplied a driver for Windows 10. This is included in the Windows Support Software which can be downloaded by using the Boot Camp Assistant.

I am using iMovie to import miniDV videos. The tapes are pretty old (~20 years) and there are numerous errors on them. As a result, iMovie creates lots of individual clips. When I try to recombine them, iMovie makes the volume fade in and fade out between each clip, and it's horrible. Is there any way to get iMovie to get the sound to line up?\nI've also tried using QuickTime Player to record the video. That works pretty well for most of my video, but not for all of my video.\n\nA: This could have two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transition between clips \n\n If you can see that symbol between your clips you have a transition between the individual clips.

Hence am posting here:\nWhat happened (verbose b/c I am not sure which is relevant):\nI was doing \"git push\" when I was prompted to fix the author name and user email. I copied the command and did it. The command opened an editor (vi), but I didn't know how to close the editor's window. So I closed the Terminal window (w/o editing). \nAt some point, I was prompted to switch to zsh from bash. I copied the prompt and did it.\nProblem is: the prompt became myName@MacBook-Pro % (used to be My-MacBook-Pro $). To remove the % and set the prompt back to default, I read some and followed a tip and did export PS1=\"\\W \\$\" which resulted in my prompt becoming \\W \\$. So I did export PS1=\"$\", thinking at least I could get rid of the clutter. But whatever I did, it didn't stick. When I open a new window, the same myName@MacBook-Pro % reappeared.\nSet aside what git wants me to do regarding username, how do I get my prompt to get back to default, with username (or MacBook-Pro) and current working directory--most importantly, ending in $ (and not %, which is driving me bananas)?\n\nA: So you're using zsh now not bash?\nThe following applies to zsh:\nTo make your change persistent you have to include the export PS1 line in your ~/.zshrc file. If you already have such a file, open it and check for an export PS1 line and edit it to suit your needs. \nIf not, run:\necho 'export PS1=\"%M $ \"' >> ~/.zshrc\n\nwhich will change your prompt to include the full machine host name followed by $ as requested (see here for more details).\nTo see the effects of this change you either need to open a new terminal window or source the .zshrc file (in every terminal that was open when you made the change):\nsource ~/.zshrc\n\nYou can achieve the same results in bash but using either the ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc files (and not forgetting to source them).\n\nA little aside:\nI'm sure you've done your research by now but if you get stuck in vim again, the following key combination will help: ESC : q <CR> (where <CR> is the enter key). If you've made changes though this won't work. You can either discard the changes:\nESC : q! <CR>\n\nor write the changes to file:\nESC : wq <CR>\n\nIf your experience didn't scare you off from vim, here's a great cheat sheet I'd recommend: https://vim.rtorr.com/\n", "Q: AppleScript 'choose from list' - I'm having trouble with Multiple Selections I have a series of AppleScripts which are saved as apps.

The DiskExpert Utility shows 74 GB of disk space allocated to user \"Guest\", yet Finder only shows less than one GB. \nCan I reclaim the space, or is DiskExpert \"lying\"?\n\nA: Disk Expert may be giving you the spaced used by \"Users\" which will include your stuff as well as Guest Users. If this is the case then erasing stuff under \"Guest\" will not buy you much. When I run Disk Expert I get space used by \"Users\" and the space used by me. Did you get a space for your user account? You should have unless you are the guest user. I also got a space labeled as \"Files of user: Guest - Size 13.4 GB\" so you should have similar spaces from Disk Expert. That is you should have a space for User that is bigger than the space for your account and the space for the Guest account. You should also have a space for both Guest and your home directory. By space I mean a section of the mapping for Disk Utility. See image below.\n\nIf you are sure the 78 GB are from guest users you should contact them and see if they need any of the info on the Guest Users account. If not you can delete the files under the guest user account. Be careful not to erase other directories and make sure there is nothing under guest user that you want to keep.

The command's executable is located in /usr/local/bin/ and it accepts files as command line arguments. It's a PDF reader named zathura.\nWhile investigating this topic I learned that an Applescript can be saved as an application. I've managed to do that and I've also managed to make Finder use it primarily as my PDF reader.\nI tried writing the following script:\non run argv\n    do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/zathura \" & (item 1 of argv)\nend run\n\nIf I run this script from the applescript editor, using the play button, the program opens without any file, but that's understandable since I have no way with this interface to specify a file argument.\nHowever, if I save it as an application, put it in the applications folder and click it, I get the error:\n\nCan't make item 1 into type Unicode text (-1700)\n\nMoreover, when I select a file in Finder and try to open it with the new application I just created, nothing happens.\nI don't understand why does the script act differently if saved as an application and what are the variables (as argv) that hold the information on the file that Finder would like to open.\n\nA: Using the argv parameter with the run handler is designed for arguments passed to the script when using it with osascript from the command line.  In a regular AppleScript application, an open handler is passed a list of aliases (HFS paths), for example:\non open fileItems\n    repeat with anItem in fileItems\n        # do something with anItem\n    end repeat\nend open\n\nFrom your snippet, you would do something like:\non open fileItems\n    do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/zathura \" & quoted form of POSIX path of item 1 of fileItems\nend open\n\nNote that you should use the POSIX path of items when using them with the shell, and the paths should also be quoted or have characters special to the shell escaped.\nSee the AppleScript Language Guide for more information.\n", "Q: apfs snapshot changing after creation?

If you're running on pre-Catalina macOS version, you probably have /Users as a symbolic link. If you're running on Catalina, /Users is a firmlink.\nThis means that when you run ls /private/tmp/snap/Users/dmd/foo to check for the file, you're actually not looking at a file inside the snapshot, but rather the system will traverse the link inside the snapshot and onto your ordinary volume for the actual file.\nIf you're on Catalina and want to redo your commands without the link interferring with you, you will need to instead use the following command to check for existence of the file inside the snapshot:\nls /private/tmp/snap/System/Volumes/Data/Users/dmd/foo\n\n", "Q: What is the source of air pollution data in the Weather app?

As you can see below when setting PROMPT='%~X the X is deleted on pressing tab on dir in 5.7.1 but not 5.8.\n\nThe NEWS file supplied with 5.8 source says changes were made to completion functions which may explain this but in any case this bug appears to be fixed.\n\nSeveral changes have been made to the way completion functions track\n'precommands' (such as `command` and `env`) and determine whether the\ncommand being completed for is a shell builtin. Developers of completion\nfunctions may wish to familiarise themselves with `_normal -p` and\n`_pick_variant -b`.\n\n\nThere is also this CVE included in version 5.8 so perhaps Apple will provide an update at some point if you don't wish to compile your own.\n\nCVE-2019-20044: When unsetting the PRIVILEGED option, the shell sets its\neffective user and group IDs to match their respective real IDs. On some\nplatforms (including Linux and macOS, but not FreeBSD), when the RUID and\nEUID were both non-zero, it was possible to regain the shell's former\nprivileges\n\n\n", "Q: Is there an alternative iOS to macOS music and photo sync tool? With macOS Catalina iOS sync has moved to Finder and became very unreliable, very slow, and even adding a single song starts a very long loop of syncing:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/df2o4g/ios_sync_is_completely_broken_in_catalina/\nAlso when you have 20-40 GB photos and videos, you are looking for something better than iCloud Photo library or Photo stream. Like a better UX of deciding what is uploaded to icloud, what is on the mac (where space is possibly limited) and what is on the iPhone, and where it's clear, that \"delete\" button deletes from which of the three in the end of the day. \nBut slowness and not showing a progress status is also a huge issue with both Music/Finder sync and Photos app.\nIs there a 3rd party project out there, who got these sync tools right between iOS, macOS and icloud? I'd be happy to support them.\n\nA: It is hard to answer your question, as it has multiple elements to it. You're both asking about syncing between an iOS device and a Mac (over USB or WiFi), and you're asking about syncing between a Mac and iCloud Photos. In addition, the conditions for the answer is really subjective - even though I might think that somebody got sync tools  \"just right\", you might think that they're not \"right\" for you.\nFor syncing between the iOS device and the Mac, I can recommend this third party project:\nhttp://www.libimobiledevice.org\nIt works perfectly well for syncing. I think it's \"just right\" for my purposes, where the built-in syncing in macOS isn't enough.\nFor syncing between the Mac and iCloud Photos, there doesn't exist any 3rd party program that allows you to decide exactly what is uploaded to the Photo Library, and what stays on the Mac (outside of the ordinary controls provided to you by Apple Photos).\n\nA: A few thoughts. First, you could definitely use Google photos to store all of this. It's free (with slightly lower quality) and it auto-syncs everything. I never import my photos into my computer because they're all on Google Photos.\nSecond, for deletion, image capture (a native app) is incredibly effective. You can do a lot of manipulation and (believe) can mass delete once you've synced up with Google Photos.\nI'm sure you can work iCloud cleanly, but I prefer using Google Photos.\n", "Q: GateKeeper Blocking Audio Plugin I'm an audio producer although I have also worked as a C/C++ programmer so I'm reasonably technical!\nI bought a Mac Mini about a year ago and it recently developed a fault and had to be replaced so I'm currently in the process of setting up a new Mac Mini running Catalina (10.15.3).\nOne of the audio programs I use is Presonus Studio One. A big part of how it's used is via third-party plug-ins which come in a variety of formats - AU, VST2, VST3, etc. The plug-ins are installed in different ways - some via a \"control centre\" app, some by an installer, others by drag-and-drop to the appropriate folder. \nI've run into a problem with one VST3 plug-in. I dropped the plug-in into the folder (/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3). Then I ran Studio One which does a plug-in scan at startup. An error message popped up (can't remember exactly what it was) saying that the software was from an unidentified developer and couldn't be run. Ever since then, the plug-in won't load. I suspect the plug-in has been \"blacklisted\".\nI've tried the following in order to fix the problem but so far nothing's worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-installing the plug-in with an installer \n\n*Disabling GateKeeper with: spctl --master-disable  \n\n*Resetting GateKeeper with: spctl --reset-default\n\n\nOther plug-ins are loading fine.\nNow I'm stuck. Any suggestions as to what I should try next?\nCheers,\nChris\n\nA: From the man pages of spctl:\nTo allow Frobozz.app to run on the local system:\n       spctl --add --label \"My Stuff\" /Applications/Frobozz.app\n\nLabels are optional as well, it seems strange even after a master-disable that you were still unable to run the plug in.\n"]
