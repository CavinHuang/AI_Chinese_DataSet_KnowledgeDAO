["Q: Can I uninstall Gnome? I have Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity as DE installed on my PC. But I recently found out that Gnome DE is installed, too. I don't need Gnome, never use it, so I wannt to remove it. Can I do this without causing damage to Unity? Are there any packages that belong to Gnome but are used by Unity as well?\n\nA: Just do:\n\nsudo apt-get remove ubuntu-gnome-desktop gnome-shell gdm\n\nand gnome shell shall be removed(I had to say it like that). Don't worry, unity will work fine.\nIn case you want to uninstall all the unneeded software gnome-ubnutu installs check out: Remove ubuntu-gnome-desktop?\nEdit1: to remove gnome flashback, do: \n\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-session-flashback\n\n\nA: Unity is based off of gnome 3, so you can't safely remove it. Unity is basically like a skin on top of gnome, but integrated VERY tightly. Don't remove it unless you switch to another non-gnome based or gnome 2 based DE that has it integrated.\n", "Q: Joining and authenticated by Windiws Active Directory in Ubuntu 14.04 client Is there a easy GUI based tool to join Windows Active Directory?\nI have read about \"LikeWise\" but does it work with Ubuntu 14.04?\nIt is not showing in my software centre. \nAlso in their website 14.04 is not listed!\nRef: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/likewise-open-gui/\nDo we have similar alternative to \"LikeWise\"?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: now called PBIS Open 8.0.1\nthe same \"LikeWise\" . u can download it form here  and the same installation and GUI.\nhttp://download1.beyondtrust.com/Technical-Support/Downloads/PowerBroker-Identity-Services-Open-Edition/?Pass=True&elq=1b2b5c66eaa3407fa00dfd5b7673ebcc&elqCampaignId=\n", "Q: How can I install nvidia-331-updates without automatically installing a full-fledged unity desktop?

I want to set up my machine with a static IP address. I've done it before and it worked.\nIt's been a long time so, once again, I researched how to do it before starting. It looked pretty familiar and I could remember the process from before ... so I got started ...\nI should mention that this is a new installation. The only thing I did before attempting this was to do an update and install ssh.\nThe first thing that I thought was odd was the contents of /etc/network/interfaces.  It looked like this:\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nWhere's the stuff I usually find (and the walk through pages all seemed indicate that I would find) for eth0? I was expecting to see:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nFunny thing is, it did pick up an IP address - 192.169.1.100 - which is a bit odd because IPs are usually assigned on a sequential basis and I would have expected it to pick up 192.168.1.7 because this was the next available IP.\nAnyway, all this oddness aside, I ploughed on. I added the following to /etc/network/interfaces\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n        address 192.168.1.201\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        network 192.168.1.0\n        broadcast 192.168.1.255\n        gateway 192.168.1.1\n\nThen the next dose of oddness ... I issued the following command: /etc/init.d/networking restart ... nothing happened. No error messages, nothing at all. So, I tried this: service networking restart ... this is what happened:\nstop: Job failed while stopping\nstart: Job is already running: networking\n\nSo I rebooted. The network configuration looked just great. I could ssh into the machine from inside my internal network. At this moment I thought I'd done it and I could forget the odd stuff. But no, the next thing I did was run apt-get update ... it failed ... I tried to ping a couple of websites and nothing would resolve so I'm guessing it's not finding a DNS server.\nBut it's just a guess and it doesn't help me because I don't know what to try next.\n\nA: The default /etc/network/interfaces file only contains the loopback interface definition because desktop versions of Ubuntu use the NetworkManager service instead.\nYour current configuration is missing a dns-nameservers specification, so it cannot resolve names to IP addresses.\nYou could add one or more dns-nameservers, however unless you have a particular reason to use the networking service, it would probably be better to revert your changes and then set up a static interface via NetworkManager's nm-applet (from the menu bar) or by invoking nm-connection-editor from a terminal - navigate to the IPV4 Settings tab and change the drop-down Method: from DHCP to Manual and then enter your desired network parameters there.\n", "Q: Is distribution of raring packages officially ended? I don't see raring on http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/. Is it a temporary thing or people are expected to move to next versions of Ubuntu ?\nThanks.\n\nA: Raring went End of Life some time ago.  All releases of Ubuntu have specific End of Life dates.  The wiki contains a page of all Releases, both current releases and releases that have gone End of Life, where they are no longer supported, and no longer should be used.  It is infinitely important that you use a version of Ubuntu that is still supported so that you do not put yourself and your data at risk.\nThe \"repositories\" for older releases of Ubuntu are under this location but never receive updates or security fixes.  Continuing to use an older release that has gone End of Life puts you and your data at risk. \n", "Q: Error installing scrapy in virtualenv using pip pip install scrapy\nDownloading/unpacking scrapy\n  Downloading Scrapy-0.24.2-py2-none-any.whl (502kB): 502kB downloaded\nDownloading/unpacking pyOpenSSL (from scrapy)\n  Downloading pyOpenSSL-0.14.tar.gz (128kB): 128kB downloaded\n  Running setup.py (path:/home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/build/pyOpenSSL/setup.py) egg_info for package pyOpenSSL\n\n    warning: no previously-included files matching '*.pyc' found anywhere in distribution\n    no previously-included directories found matching 'doc/_build'\nRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): six>=1.5.2 in /home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from scrapy)\nDownloading/unpacking queuelib (from scrapy)\n  Downloading queuelib-1.1.1.tar.gz\n  Running setup.py (path:/home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/build/queuelib/setup.py) egg_info for package queuelib\n\nRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): lxml in /home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from scrapy)\nDownloading/unpacking w3lib>=1.2 (from scrapy)\n  Downloading w3lib-1.6.tar.gz\n  Running setup.py (path:/home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/build/w3lib/setup.py) egg_info for package w3lib\n\nRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): cssselect>=0.9 in /home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from scrapy)\nDownloading/unpacking Twisted>=10.0.0 (from scrapy)\n  Downloading Twisted-14.0.0.tar.bz2 (4.3MB): 4.3MB downloaded\n  Running setup.py (path:/home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/build/Twisted/setup.py) egg_info for package Twisted\n\nDownloading/unpacking cryptography>=0.2.1 (from pyOpenSSL->scrapy)\n  Downloading cryptography-0.5.2.tar.gz (319kB): 319kB downloaded\n  Running setup.py (path:/home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/build/cryptography/setup.py) egg_info for package cryptography\n    Package libffi was not found in the pkg-config search path.\n    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libffi.pc'\n    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\n    No package 'libffi' found\n    Package libffi was not found in the pkg-config search path.\n    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libffi.pc'\n    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\n    No package 'libffi' found\n    Package libffi was not found in the pkg-config search path.\n    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libffi.pc'\n    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\n    No package 'libffi' found\n    Package libffi was not found in the pkg-config search path.\n    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libffi.pc'\n    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\n    No package 'libffi' found\n    Package libffi was not found in the pkg-config search path.\n    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libffi.pc'\n    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\n    No package 'libffi' found\n    c/_cffi_backend.c:13:17: fatal error: ffi.h: No such file or directory\n     #include <ffi.h>\n                     ^\n    compilation terminated.\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"<string>\", line 17, in <module>\n      File \"/home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/build/cryptography/setup.py\", line 174, in <module>\n        \"test\": PyTest,\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/distutils/core.py\", line 111, in setup\n        _setup_distribution = dist = klass(attrs)\n      File \"/home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools/dist.py\", line 239, in __init__\n        self.fetch_build_eggs(attrs.pop('setup_requires'))\n      File \"/home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools/dist.py\", line 263, in fetch_build_eggs\n        parse_requirements(requires), installer=self.fetch_build_egg\n      File \"/home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 564, in resolve\n        dist = best[req.key] = env.best_match(req, self, installer)\n      File \"/home/elie/.virtualenvs/stat/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 802, in best_match\n        return self.obtain(req, installer) #

I found that rtcwake would serve my purpose. However putting it in the crontab does nothing. Following is my crontab entry for \"root\" user\n0 1 * * * rtcwake -m disk -s 25200\n\nI added it using 'sudo crontab -e'. The syslog shows that it executed the command, but the computer does not sleep. If I run the command on terminal directly, the computer is put to sleep immediately as expected. So I don't think there is any problem with ACPI.\nDoes anyone have a clue? I am on Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: I know this is two years too late, but I had the same problem and want to give my solution to anyone who might have this problem in the future. \nTo wake my machine up every day at 06:00, I set up a cronjob using rtcwake. My problem was, however, that even though the cronjob ran, it didn't set the alarm. I did edit the root user's crontab with sudo crontab -e. \nThe solution was to use the full path of rtcwakein the crontab, not just the command. To do this, first use which rtcwake which'll return the full path of the command (in my case that was /usr/sbin/rtcwake) and use that in the cronjob.\nMy cronjob now looks like this:\n0 12 * * * /usr/sbin/rtcwake -m no -t $(date +\\%s -d 'tomorrow 0600')\n \nAs a side note, if you're using date like me, you have to escape the percentage sign. \n\nA: Okay, I think I've found the solution. Adding a sudo before rtcwake solves the problem.\nI now however have following question: Why does a root's crontab need sudo to run a command. Isn't it already running under root?\n\nA: I did some investigation on this, if your did \"sudo crontab -e\" with rtcwake inside the table without sudo, you will get the error message:\n/home/leo/autojob: line 4: rtcwake: command not found\n\nit seems that although \"sudo crontab -e\" is executed under root account, it cannot find the right command path. There are some other post says you shall put PATH in front of crontab etc. As long as you put sudo in front of your rtcwake command, it seems be able to find the command again.\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n40 14 * * * sudo /home/leo/autojob >> /home/leo/cron_log 2>&1\n\nthe above config in sudo crontab now works, the \"autojob\" is the script contains the rtcwake.\n", "Q: Problems after installing the “New Hardware Support is Available” Problem started July 11th 2014 when I got the update.

The relevant part is the following:\nHow to enable kernel options on the livecd (before install)\nIf you boot ubuntu from a livecd (or USB stick), right after the bios splash screen you will get a purple screen with a keyboard logo at the bottom:\n\nPress any key at that moment to access a menu. Select your language with the arrow keys, press enter and you will a menu.\nIf you press the F6 key, a menu at the bottom will open allowing you to set kernel options with the space bar or enter key. \nIf you need to add kernel options not provided by the F6 menu, you can just type them in at the end of the boot options line.\nImportant: if you select a kernel boot option from the F6 menu and proceed to boot and later install ubuntu, those boot options will NOT be applied to your installation.

vesrion>\n\nBut your system will have broken packages.\nThus you should rebuild the packages in this case.\nThe process is as following:\n1) Get the repository from the Nautilus 3.4 version (you can get it from launchpad).\n2) Rebuild this on 14.04.\nIn the sources directory.\n$dpkg-source -x nautilus-3.4xxx.dsc\n$cd nautilus-3.4xxx\n$debian/rules build\n$dpkg-build package\n\n3) After then you can install nautilus rebuilt from the local directory.\n$dpkg -i nautilus-3.4xxx.deb\n\n", "Q: Not able to install software on Ubuntu 12.10 I am newbie with Ubuntu.I am trying to download Okular pdf

You either need to update to a more recent version of Ubuntu (i.e. 14.04), or find an alternative repository. The alternative repository for 12.10 is released here (thanks @rubo77 for finding it). More information on upgrading can be found here.\n\nA: As 12.10 is EOL, the repos for it have moved. Upgrade to a newer version of ubuntu (or downgrade to 12.04, though that is really not recommended) to access the normal repos. If you absolutely need to use that version of ubuntu, consider adding the archive repos, google for instructions on how to do that. In the end my answer is upgrade to 14.04, it's more stable and has support\n", "Q: Replacing os, boot loader not showing I know many have asked this before but their problem is either: it directly boot to windows or does not boot at all.

I have tried this many times over but I can't seem to get this to work for my situation. Basically, I used to work with Linux but now I just use it to edit videos and photos in Ubuntu Studio. Therefore, as it is no longer my primary OS, I no longer want to have to use GRUB to choose which OS to boot into.\nIn other words, because I don't use Ubuntu very often it is aggravating to have to choose the OS every time I start my system. I have been able to modify GRUB to where it will boot into Windows 8.1 by default and lowered the timer, but the fact that GRUB starts in the first place is annoying and I know there must be a workaround. Right now my workaround is to run it as a virtual machine, but when rendering my YouTube videos I'm just not getting as much processing power and it doesn't seem to recognize and therefore properly utilize my graphics card. I would much rather use it as a true OS and not a VM.\nSo, on a UEFI system, how do I make it to where if I want to load Ubuntu Studio I just have to choose the HDD it is installed to as the boot device from BIOS/UEFI?\nLet me know if you need any info I may have accidentally left out\n\nA: First, throw away your BIOS assumptions! Under EFI, the unit of bootability is a boot loader file, not a hard disk. That is, you don't \"choose the HDD it is installed to as the boot device\"; you choose the boot loader file for an OS. This may seem like a subtle nit-picky issue, but it's fundamental to understanding -- and therefore properly manipulating -- the EFI boot process.\nThe first thing you should do is to read your computer's manual, scrutinize its boot-time prompts, or just plain experiment to figure out how you can access the computer's built-in boot manager. Typically, this is done by hitting a particular function key at boot time, although sometimes it's Esc or some other key. (Sadly, there's absolutely no standardization on this.) A few computers don't really have useful boot-time boot menus, but most do. Your boot menu will probably include one option called ubuntu, another called Windows boot manager or something similar (I don't recall the precise name offhand), and probably some other entries. Verify that selecting the Windows item boots straight to Windows without booting Ubuntu. If selecting Windows boots GRUB, or if there is no Windows option, things get complex, so let's put that off....\nIf the firmware's boot manager lets you boot Windows, then you should boot to Ubuntu and type sudo efibootmgr to see a list of the boot programs that are registered with the EFI. This list should include more-or-less the entries that the boot manager shows you. The output will also include a line called BootOrder that shows the order in which various boot programs are used. Here's an example from one of my computers:\n$ sudo efibootmgr \nBootCurrent: 0005\nTimeout: 0 seconds\nBootOrder: 0005,0004,0000,0006,0001,0002\nBoot0000* rEFInd (via shim)\nBoot0001* P1: WDC WD10EARS-00MVWB0      \nBoot0002* P5: ASUS    DRW-2014S1T       \nBoot0004* UEFI OS\nBoot0005* rEFInd Boot Manager\nBoot0006* UEFI: ADATA USB Flash Drive\n\nWindows isn't installed here, and I'm using my own rEFInd boot manager rather than GRUB, so there's no ubuntu entry; but the point is that you can see that the BootOrder causes Boot0005 (rEFInd Boot Manager) to be tried first, followed by Boot0004 (UEFI OS), etc. In your case, you should identify the Windows boot manager and set it first, followed by your ubuntu entry, and optionally followed by anything else. You can set the BootOrder with the -o option to efibootmgr, as in:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 7,4,5\n\nThis example would set the system to try item #7 first (which isn't present on my system; but just pretend it's a Windows entry), followed by #4, followed by #5. When you reboot, you should see Windows appear automatically. To boot Ubuntu, you can hold the key you use to get to your firmware's boot manager and use that to boot Ubuntu.\nI said earlier that things get complex if you can't get to that menu or if selecting the Windows entry boots to GRUB. The latter case is caused by certain options in the Boot Repair tool, which rename GRUB so that it takes on the name normally taken by the Windows boot loader. This is necessary on some systems to work around EFI bugs, but this option is sometimes applied unnecessarily. (This was common a year or so ago, when it was the default for Boot Repair.) You can do similar renaming manually or via other tools, too. The solution is to undo those actions. In Boot Repair, select the Advanced menu and use the option to restore backed-up files to their original names. If you need more help, ask.\nIf you can't find your firmware's built-in boot manager, you may need to do something else entirely. I believe there's an option in GRUB to set the timeout very low and hide the menu unless a key is pressed. You could do that, in conjunction with making Windows the default boot option. I don't know offhand precisely how to achieve this effect, though. Another solution is to install my rEFInd boot manager and then edit /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf, uncommenting the timeout line and setting it to -1; and uncommenting and adjusting the default_selection option to boot Windows by default.\n\nA: If your second hard disk is seen as a \"removable media\" like a USB, it can have its own EFI partition, and uses the default bootloader /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.  For non-secure boot, copy the unsigned grubx64.efi as the bootx64.efi.  For secure boot, copy shimx64.efi to bootx64.efi, and put a copy of the signed grubx64 into /EFI/Boot too.  Have the grub.cfg file in /EFI/ubuntu, and you should have a working UEFI boot device.  Put it after the Windows Boot in the boot order, and you will have to select it via the efi boot menu.  The grub install to a USB disk will probably fail even if given the EFI partition as the location for the bootloader, but you can just make the directories and copy the files yourself, or rely on boot-repair to do that.\n", "Q: how to uninstall viber completely from Ubuntu 14.04? How can i uninstall viber completely from Ubuntu 14.04? I did not find any option.\n\nA: If you want to uninstall Viber but keep the configuration files in case you will install it again in the near future, use :\nsudo apt-get remove viber\nIn case you want to uninstall Viber and DO NOT keep the configuration files, use : \nsudo apt-get purge viber\n\nA: Viber is available as a .deb package and also as tarball. If you installed viber through the .deb package, then you can easily uninstall it using sudo apt-get remove viber\nBut instead, if you installed through the tarball, then you must have extracted the viber files into a single folder such as /opt/Viber. Just delete that folder and any .desktop files (shortcuts) that you created for it.\nIn addition, Viber user configurations are stored in ~/.ViberPC. You can choose to delete that as well. Note that if you do this, the next time you install viber, you would have to make any customization you made this time , again.\n\nA: 1- Installed by apt-get:\nsudo su\napt-get remove --purge viber\n\n2- Installed by dpkg\nsudo su \ndpkg --purge viber\n\n3- Installed compiled, \nsudo su\ncd <uncompressed directory>\nmake clean\nmake uninstall\n\n", "Q: Remove optional ubuntu packages for speeding up release-upgrade I have to update ubuntu 13 to ubuntu 14. When I issued release-upgrade it is showing that about 700 MB data is to be downloaded from internet. I have slow internet connection now. So it will take hours to complete. I believe if I remove some optional packages then it will ignore their updates. Hence I can reduce the amount of data downloaded from internet. How can I do it easily? \n\nA: The term \"optional\" will have specific meaning for you and for others. So in general to make the download size smaller, you could follow these steps:\n1) I noticed that the maximum space is occupied by the \"debug\" symbol packages. They are used to help developers find out crash points easily. \nYou can uninstall these safely without any risks. They usually have a \"-dbg\" at the end of their name, e.g., python2.7 package has a corresponding debug symbol package \"python2.7-dbg\" \nThis process of selecting dbg packages should be done manually by you and it will save the maximum space.\n2) Remove any unwanted softwares that you don't use. We usually have multiple browsers, multimedia apps etc. Go the \"1 app per utility\" way to reduce space.\n", "Q: Network manager ubuntu I am using Ubuntu in Virtualbox and not able to setup network connection to host windows7 machine. its showing wired network disconnected.\npreviously it was networkconnection1. \n\nA: Shutdown virtualbox and go into settings then click on network and usually the settings in the screenshot that I am attaching are all you need.\nYou do not need to do anything in network manager in ubuntu.\n\nIf for some reason it does not work here is an image of the advanced settings.\n\n", "Q: Dual Boot Ubuntu 14.04 and windows 8.1 issue I have installed window 8.1 after cleaning my hard disk..and then installed ubuntu 14.04 with the help of ubuntu forum directions..\nBut after installing both, window 8.1 sometimes start and sometimes not. Even if this starts it automatically restarts after sometime.\nMy system does not support UEFI. \nGrub is showing both ubuntu and windows.\n\nA: I would verify that the disk is good first as disk sectors going bad could cause the Windows to fail intermittently. Also, I would check that all RAM is good -- same reason. A bad spot in high RAM could crash the Windows but only when enough Windows are open that high RAM gets used.\nThen I would boot the Windows install, delete all partitions, let Windows create a partition from the first half of the disk (leave the rest of the disk for Linux later).

On a nexus device, it's always empty - so you see Unnamed Device. For other kinds of Android device, you may see a meaningful value here (I think Samsung set it). It's actually possible to set from the PC side using MTP but there's no way to expose this in Nautilus - as you see, none of the things you can click on have this name - the 'Nexus 5' you see comes from the USB identifier - I couldn't tell you why Nautilus uses different information in different places.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server AUTOSTART How do I configure the server to restart automatically when the power comes back (after it has been shut down due to outage of power>?\n\nA: Some BIOSes have a Wake on Power facility.

I am a recent convert to Ubuntu (14.04) and still quite a novice. Looking for a DVD writing software, and dissatisfied with both Brasero and K3b, I downloaded Nero Linux 4. This works pretty well except in one respect: it cannot do multisession writing. I gathered from the Internet that Nero Linux 3 has no such issue, so I downloaded it. But Nero Linux 3 requires installation via command line, with which I am all at sea.\nThe instruction that accompanies it says:\nINSTALLATION NERO LINUX 3.0.5.1\n===============================\n\nOPEN TERMINAL IN THIS FOLDER\n============================\nbecome root (su or sudo depending on your distro)\n\ntar xzvf nerolinux-3.5.1.0.tgz -C /\nnero\n\nThis I am unable to execute.  I cannot even make out what is meant by \"Open Terminal in this folder/ become root\" etc. I just tried typing sudo apt-get and then pasting the rest in Terminal, but this was rejected. I would be immensely grateful if someone could provide a step-by-step how-to-do, preferably with specific reference to the above installation instruction, assuming zero knowledge on my part.\n\nA: Fairly importantly, I think you might not have an official copy of this and that could make what you're about to do pretty dangerous. The documentation for Nero 3 only talks about RPM and DEB installers.\nIf you're confident your copy isn't going to destroy your life, carry on... Otherwise try to get hold of the DEB installer. It'll make things much easier.\n\n\"Becoming root\" translated to \"prefix it with sudo\" in Ubuntu-ese (so it becomes sudo tar ...) but there might be a better way of handling this. Alien can convert binary tgz packages like this into a DEB. This simply makes it easy to remove. Alien will also install the package at the same time as creating it.\nsudo apt-get install alien\nsudo alien -di nerolinux-3.5.1.0.tgz\n\nAnd then you should be able to run nero (I'm not sure if it installs launchers; the documentation claims /usr/share/applications/nerolinux.desktop will be created).\nBecause we've used alien removing it should be as simple as looking for nerolinux in your favourite package manager, or just running sudo apt-get remove nerolinux from a command line.\nThough I'm not sure that Nero 4 doesn't do multi-session. There are a lot of people saying they've had problems and a similar number of posts suggesting an update fixed it (this is back around 2010). In my experience this is as much to do with the media and hardware as it is the software.\n", "Q: Can I mix sources from different ubuntu versions? As we know that we are using Repositories for installing packages and repositories configuration file located at /etc/apt/sources.list.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) which reaches End of Life. That means no updates or support. So, the question is, can I use sources.list file from another version, say Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and will it negatively affect the system.\n\nA: 12.10 is already beyond end of life.\nBut to answer your question, in general, unless you have a great deal of experience with apt, it is a bad idea to mix repositories. In your case, the packages in 12.04 are almost certainly going to be older then the packages in 12.10, and so it will do you no good.\nIn theory you can mix repositories using pinning, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto\nHowever, when pinning one generally installs a few packages.\nIn your situation, rather then mixing repositories, you would upgrade.\nBecause 13.04 is also at EOL I suggest a fresh install of 14.04.

If you're running on a Virtual machine then it is always going to install to the virtual disk.\n\nA: Assuming you are installing on a virtual machine that is running on your host OSX system, the VM has no access to your host's hardware.

This has been working great and has been set up exactly how I wanted it until a recent dist-upgrade.\nFor some reason now my refind boot menu shows an option to boot fallback from EFI with an unknown_os icon.  Selecting this option takes me into grub.\nI've looked in my EFI directory which contains /EFI/bootx64.efi as well as bootx64.efi.grb.  It also has the standard ubuntu and APPLE subdirectories containing the firmware.scap, grub, skim and mokmanager files.\nIs there a safe way to remove the fallback entry from my boot menu as it was before? \nThanks.\n\nA: For sure, there is a safe way to hide an entry from rEFInd boot menu.\nI would suggest you to use \"dont_scan_files\" or \"don't_scan_files\" parameter in \"refind.conf\".\nTo add the EFI file to hide in addition to the default ones, you may use the following:\ndont_scan_files + NameOfTheEFILoaderToHide.efi\n\nFor more details about the configuration of rEFInd Boot Manager, don't hesitate to take a look at the official documentation.\nTo identify the EFI file(s) you wish to keep or hide, efibootmgr may help you to get a list of the EFI menu entries with the corresponding EFI file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Under Ubuntu, open a terminal and install \"efibootmgr\", if it is not already installed, by using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install efibootmgr\n\n*Retrieve EFI boot order and entries with the command:\nsudo efibootmgr -v\nNotes:\nBootCurrent: 0002 (indicates the UEFI boot entry used for booting).\nBootOrder: 0002,0003,0001,0000 (indicates the UEFI boot order defined).\nBoot000x* (represents one boot entry.

It is 4 years old and very slow on windows 7. I want to install ubuntu on it. I tried it out on the live cd and it is great! So I click install. Question If I install ubuntu will it delete other partitions like my recovery drive and my system and hp-tools drive it came with? Or will it just touch my C: Drive?\n\nA: it deals with the entire disk and all partitions, try opening gparted while inside the live environment and resizing the windows 7 partition, then open the installer, and on the prompt where is asks if you want to erase disk and use entire disk for ubuntu, or install alongside, select \"something else\", go get a cup of coffee, then select the partition in the list that says \"free space\" and corresponds in name to the empty area on the diagram, click the change button, select \"exxt4\", \"format\" and use as \"/\", then just follow the prompts\n\nA: To avoid having problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*BACKUP YOUR IMPORTANT FILES! You never know what might happen (power failure, etc.)\n\n*For the safest of ways, in Windows, resize the windows partition leaving 50Gb free (just a guideline). Alternatively resize the Windows partition in step 5 below.\n\n*Launch the Installer\n\n*Choose \"something else\" option\n\n*In gparted create two partitions: a big one (all the freed up space - 4Gb) and choose ext4 and mount point /, and a small one (4Gb Swap)\n\n*This should leave your windows and recovery partitions intact.\n\n*Enjoy Ubuntu.\n\n", "Q: How do package files .deb files that are installed outside the package tree get put into the normal package tree? So, I've installed .deb files through double click or through dpkg, and I was wondering how do they get into the normal package tree structure you can get from apt-get synaptic etc.\nI mean, if you install on purpose an older or newer version of a package, or a package that is not yet in the repositories but may soon be, what consequences and behavior to expect?\n\nA: No difference really compared to the packages you install from various repositories.\nYou can list such packages from Synaptic by selecting Origin -> Local.\n\nA: For the record, the \"package tree\" your refer to are typically called repositories (repos). If it is from Launchpad, it is called a PPA.\nIf you install an older version of a package manually (download a .deb file and install it with sudo dpkg -i), then the high-level package managers (apt-get, aptitude, Synaptic, the system update manager, etc.) will prompt you to update to the latest version of the package.\nIf you install a newer version of a package not in the repos, nothing (else) will happen. Since the version installed is higher than the highest version in any repo, the high-level package managers will consider it \"up-to-date\". When a version higher than the one you installed becomes available, the package managers will prompt you to update to the latest version. Note that if the version in the repos gets a security update and the version number is still less than the version you have installed, you will not be notified of it in any way, since your version is higher than the existing version.\nIf you install a package not in the repos at all, then there won't be much of an impact, except that you can manage it from a package manager. (In this case, \"manage it\" would mean that you can remove/purge it, since that the only action available for such packages.)\n", "Q: Unable to boot ubuntu 12.04 \nI have my hp probook 445 g1 ubuntu installed factory state.\nI was running out of boot space on my PC so I installed ubuntu-tweak to clean it.But it didn't worked.

I have a Toshiba Chromebook. I had a friend install the latest version of Ubuntu on it for me. For a while, the audio in Ubuntu was working fine, but now I can't hear any audio whatsoever.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Hope this helps other Linux users on their Chromebooks with the BayTrail hardware.\nI bought a new FHD Toshiba Chromebook, installed Mint 17.3 Xfce4 on it straight away (modified the BIOS & conductive sticker).\nEverything rocked except for the sound.... my symptom was that I only had the HDMI outputs, no speakers, no analog.\nTo fix this I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update the kernel version from 3. something to 4.2.0-23 by using the update manager. (start the gui version of the update manager, click View > Linux Kernels, click at least the 4.2.0-23 version)\n\n*Update / install the linux-firmware package:\nsudo apt-get install linux-firmware\n\n\n*Download this Intel blob (click the link to download)\nhttps://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware/+/refs/heads/master/intel/fw_sst_0f28.bin-48kHz_i2s_master\nStore it here:\n/lib/firmware/intel \n\n\n*Download the modified sound config file (asound.state) from https://gist.github.com/n1trux/3751a87f374a8af5f611\nOpen a terminal window and type \nsudo alsa force-unload \n\nThis temporarily kills the audio services.\nReplace the system’s sound config file with the downloaded version:\nsudo cp ~/Downloads/asound.state /var/lib/alsa\n\n\n*Reboot, open pavucontrol and unmute your analog speakers, also perhaps check alsamixer: speaker should be enabled or allowed to be enabled.\n\nA: I had the similar problem recently after updating my Toshiba chromebook which runs Ubuntu 14.10 using crouton. The sound stopped working (although it did detect an output device \"cras\"). An update to crouton (instructions here) solved the issue for me.\n\nA: Check sounds in the system settings to ensure that your computer is not trying to play through an HDMI device.  The computer I am using has only a single audio capable device, but my other computer has both, and the HDMI output is silent (unless plugged into something).\n\n", "Q: Why do these xte commands work in terminal, but not when bound with xbindkeys? This xte command, when I run it in a terminal, triggers Expo mode:\nxte 'keydown Super_L' 'key S' 'keyup Super_L'\n\nHowever, when I put this in my .xbindkeysrc file:\n\"xte 'keydown Super_L' 'key S' 'keyup Super_L'\"\n  b:11\n\nNothing happens when I click the button. The following binding makes the letter X appear in my console when I press button 11:\n\"xte 'key X'\"\n  b:11\n\nSo why doesn't the Expo binding work?\n\nThis is the verbose output of xbindkeys -n -v when clicking button 11:\nButton press !\ne.xbutton.button=11\ne.xbutton.state=16\n\"xte 'keydown Super_L' 'key W' 'keyup Super_L'\"\n    m:0x0 + b:11   (mouse)\ngot screen 0 for window 2bb\nStart program with fork+exec call\nButton release !\ne.xbutton.button=11\ne.xbutton.state=16\nAnd nothing happens. Does this have anything to do with the way xbindkeys executes the command? (fork+exec call)\n\nAttempt number two.\nexpo.sh:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nxte 'keydown Super_L' 'key S' 'keyup Super_L'\n\nExecuting this script from the command line activates Expo.

It turns out that if my mouse button is still pressed (not yet released) when the Super+W keystroke is simulated, nothing happens. I don't know who to blame for that (perhaps Cinnamon?). I have worked around it though, by adding a short delay to the xte command:\nxte 'usleep 100000' 'keydown Super_L' 'key S' 'keyup Super_L'\n\nIt now waits 0.1 seconds before simulating Super+S. If I press and hold the mouse button more than 0.1 seconds, nothing happens.\nThis is a workaround answer. I'd much prefer a proper answer.\n\nA: I faced the same problem. \n\"xte 'key b'\"\n\nwas working in the console but not in the xbindkeys parameter file. \nI changed b by his keysym code, using the \"xev\" command to obtain it : \n\"xte 'key Ox62'\"\n\nIt worked for me\n\nA: Another simpler solution: instead of using just \"b:11\" in the xbindkeys definition, use \"b:11 + release\". It will wait until you release the button to fire the command.\nExample:\n\"sh ~/expo.sh\"\n  b:11 + release\n\n\nA: Try with +Release\n\"xte 'keydown Super_L' 'key S' 'keyup Super_L'\"\nb:11 + Release\n\nThat may help. \n\nA: Have similar issue while using sxhkcd keymapper. \nIt turns out your actual shortcut keys are detected as still being pressed. \nThere are some semi-workarounds:   \n\n\n*\n\n*look for the release event   \n\n*add sleep 0.2 in front of your command   \n\n*use shortcut with leader-key   \n\n*release your shortcut modifiers in front of your xte sequence   \n\n\nHowever you cant get realtime actions with that =)\n", "Q: Install on VirtualBox seems stuck on \"Running post install\" The install on VirtualBox 4.3.14 seems stuck on \"Running post-install triggers software-center\".\nIt has been at this screen for over an hour.

Answer expecting as both Windows7 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n\nA: First of all Back Up Your Data Before Making Changes to Your Partitions.\nSince you have windows 7 I am assuming you have a typical partition scheme with a standard MBR and old school typical BIOS and none of that fancy new mBIOS stuff (or whatever it is).\nWith that said, I would recommend you download the Ubuntu iso, make a live DVD or USB following the instructions provided by the Ubuntu site. Change the boot order in your BIOS to load the DVD and USB drives BEFORE your hard disk so that the live image will boot when you turn on your computer with the disk or USB loaded and ready to go when you do.\nWhen you boot, choose the language and then select to \"try Ubuntu without installing\" here you can set up your wireless connection or wired internet connection if you need to. \nClick on the icon in the upper right hand corner of your screen or press the \"super\" or \"windows key\" on your keyboard. \nNow, search for an application called \"gparted\" and select the application from the results given.\nGparted will load and will show your current partition scheme and should show 2 partitions, one for each windows 7. If these partitions are not listed you have a problem and you need to find assistance before you do anything else.\nIf both partitions are listed and they are recognized as NTFS partitions, take note of the size of the partitions and select one of the partitions to resize so you can free up some space to install Ubuntu on. \nRight click on the partition you would like to resize. Select \"Resize/Move\". You can set the size manually using a number or you can use the mouse to resize the partition using the arrows FROM the bar on the RIGHT side, you want to move the bar TO the LEFT to shrink the existing windows partition. This way, you will leave the used portion of the partition untouched as you can see these two examples.\n\n\nclick on resize and then you have to click on the check mark icon to apply the changes. Click to verify the changes to be made and then right click on the \"Unused\" partition and select \"New\". \nSelect \"ext4\" filesystem. Lable it Ubuntu if you want to and shrink the size of the partition to leave 2-4GB of extra space that you will need later in the installation.\nAgain click to create the new partition, click the check mark icon to apply the changes etc . . . \n\n\n*\n\n*When you are done, are connected to the internet and plugged in to\nan AC outlet you can now select the \"install Ubuntu\" icon.\n\n*Go through the steps of the installation and when you reach the step\nthat will ask you if you would like to install Ubuntu \"along side\"\nWindows, select \"something else\" instead. Here you will be taken to a partition editor similar to Gparted.\n\n*Now, right click the \"Ubuntu\" partition (ext4) you created earlier\nand select the mount point \" / \" and click to confirm.\n\n*After you have done that, right-click on the 2-4GB of unallocated\nspace and select \"swap\" or \"linux swap\" as the type.\n\n*Review your selections to make sure you have selected the correct\npartitions and not the windows 7 ones and click to apply the changes\non the lower right hand corner of the window.\n\n*Click to verify to make the changes and proceed with the remainder\nof the installation and you will be finished.

Put another way, you could be running both of them simultaneously.\nProviding a step-by-step procedure would be long and boring. But, if you have any familiarity with installing Windows based software then the steps are simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install VirtualBox\n\n*Download Ubuntu ISO\n\n*Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox\n\n*Start your new virtual machine and connect it to the downloaded Ubuntu ISO file\n\n\nBeyond that, the steps are simple as installing Ubuntu is very simple.\nIf you want detailed steps then this link may help: http://navet.ics.hawaii.edu/~casanova/VirtualBoxUbuntuHowTo.html\nOne more advantage of this virtual machine approach: you can create as many virtual machines as you want to try out other Linux distros, if you are into that sort of thing.\nFinally, I would STRONGLY recommend that you try out Xubuntu. I feel it is FAR, FAR better than the original Ubuntu, but that is just my opinion.\nHTH!\n", "Q: strange update notice Is this normal?

I have dual boot PC laptop with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04. My PC has two hard drivers:\n/dev/sda - that is SSD drive containing Windows C: NTFS partition and Ubuntu / and swap filesystems.\n/dev/sdb - that is traditional hard disk drive containing Windows D: NTFS partition\nI want to have both of my NTFS partitions mounted automatically and read-only.\nUbuntu 14.04 automatically mounts both NTFS partitions, but read-write, which is not exactly what I want. So I created mount directories under /media and added the following lines to my /etc/fstab:\n# Windows C: /dev/sda1\nUUID=2EF64975F6493DF9   /media/win_c    ntfs    defaults,umask=222      0  0\n# Windows D: /dev/sdb1\nUUID=50C40C08C40BEED2   /media/win_d    ntfs    defaults,umask=222      0  0\n\nNow both NTFS partition are mounted automatically and read-only. However, I observed a strange behavior in Nautilus, that I want to correct.\nFirst, the C: partition has different icon than D: partition; moreover, C: partition is attached to Launcher, while D: is not. Why?\nSecond, I can unmount C: partition by clicking on eject icon, but if I want to unmount D: partition the same way, I am asked of password. I like the password check here, so I want to have the same for C:. Why there is a difference between C: and D: partition behavior? What should I put into my /etc/fstab to have Nautilus ask of password when unmounting C: partition as well?\n\nA: Well, I have found explanation myself. It turned out that Ubuntu does some voodoo magic around file systems mounted in the /media directory. So in the /etc/fstab file I changed mount points from /media to /mnt as follows:\n# Windows C: /dev/sda1\nUUID=2EF64975F6493DF9   /mnt/win_c    ntfs    auto,ro      0  0\n# Windows D: /dev/sdb1\nUUID=50C40C08C40BEED2   /mnt/win_d    ntfs    auto,ro      0  0\n\nNow both NTFS partitions are mounted automatically and read-only on system boot, and both require administrator password to unmount, which is exactly what I wanted to have.\nHowever, there is no any quick access icons for them in the Nautilus, but this is rather unimportant detail than real problem.\n", "Q: Ambiance theme git repository Does the default theme for Ubuntu (Ambiance) have an official git repository?\nI want to modify it adding my tweaks, and it already has a git repository I choose to take it as start repository.\n\nA: The Ambiance theme is maintained in the light-themes package.\nYou can find the source of the package in launchpad.\nNote: it's not a git repo but a bzr repo; you can branch the project this way:\nsudo apt-get install bzr\nbzr branch lp:ubuntu-themes\n\nAlternatively a quick way to get the source is:\napt-get source light-themes\n\n\nUpdate: How to convert the ubuntu-themes bzr repo into git\nThere's probably several ways to do this, but here is mine.

Both the times I could not use apt-get upgrade and thus could not install any applications. \nUpon the second installation I turned the terminal mode on while setup was happening and noticed that Glibc had not set up properly for some reason both the times (could this be the problem??). \ni have tried all the possible things i could find off other questions. some other things i can think would be important are-\n\n\n*\n\n*during both the downloads the internet connection was lost in the middle and then the download was recovered\n\n*i have just attached a new switch into my connection, this has been giving me some DSL problems on my PC but not on WIFI so i dont think this is the cause\n\n*i can browse webpages and do virtaully anthing related to the internet on ubuntu but when i try to send an error report or a bug report the the update fails due to no internet connectivity! also when i try to select the best server it gives the same error\n\n*ping to 8.8.8.8 gives back a 0% loss\n\n*for some reason when i try to select my mirror and chose the regional one (in.ubuntu.archive.com/ubuntu) it selects that mirror but upon reboot resets to the main one. this happens even if i change it in the sources.list\n\n*upon installation of the latest 13.04 on my nexus 7, i am asked to upgrade to the more stable 13.10 but i am not able to do this in termianl since it says i have no internet connectivity and when i do it through the update manager, the confirmation window is too big for my screen and i cannot select accept so i am still using the 13.04\n\n*apart from the Glibc error displayed on setup i do not beleive there was any other error during installation. i used the Multirom instructions step by step.\n\n*the error messages vary everytime from, something wicked has happened to some files failed to install and sometimes both \ni have been trying to test this on my old nexus 7 as a test before putting it on my new one, but dont think that i will unless this problem is solved.\nany help is appreaciated! :)\nplease tell me if you want to see my sources.list, resolv.conf or installation logs\nI have removed http:// so it doesn't show links \nroot@pranay-finaltest:/home/pranay# apt-get update\nIgn archive.ubuntu.com raring Release.gpg\nIgn archive.ubuntu.com raring Release\nErr archive.ubuntu.com raring/main Sources\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nErr archive.ubuntu.com raring/restricted Sources\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nErr archive.ubuntu.com raring/universe Sources\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nErr archive.ubuntu.com raring/multiverse Sources\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nErr archive.ubuntu.com raring/main armhf Packages\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nErr archive.ubuntu.com raring/restricted armhf Packages\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nErr archive.ubuntu.com raring/universe armhf Packages\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nErr archive.ubuntu.com raring/multiverse armhf Packages\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nIgn archive.ubuntu.com raring/main Translation-en_IN\nIgn archive.ubuntu.com raring/main Translation-en\nIgn archive.ubuntu.com raring/multiverse Translation-en_IN\nIgn archive.ubuntu.com raring/multiverse Translation-en\nIgn archive.ubuntu.com raring/restricted Translation-en_IN\nIgn archive.ubuntu.com raring/restricted Translation-en\nIgn archive.ubuntu.com raring/universe Translation-en_IN\nIgn archive.ubuntu.com raring/universe Translation-en\nW: Failed to fetch\narchive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring/main/source/Sources  404  Not\nFound [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch\narchive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring/restricted/source/Sources\n404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch\narchive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring/universe/source/Sources  404\nNot Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch\narchive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring/multiverse/source/Sources\n404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch\narchive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring/main/binary-armhf/Packages\n404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch\narchive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring/restricted/binary-armhf/Packages\n404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch\narchive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring/universe/binary-armhf/Packages\n404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch\narchive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring/multiverse/binary-armhf/Packages\n404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

I see the header files in /usr/include are inside a directory gtk-2.0 (/usr/include/gtk-2.0) instead of the root include directory.  The umbrella header gtk.h includes lots of other headers by path assuming it is in the root.  Therefore, all the references to header files are broken.  If I include the gtk.h by including gtk-2.0/gtk/gtk.h then I get file not found for all the includes inside gtk.h.\nWhat is the best way to handle this?  Obviously I can move all the headers into the root include directory and into folders as the files expect them (seems like this should have been done by install).  Or, I can edit all the header files manually to fix the paths (seems like a real pain).  What is the best practice for working with these files?  Should I make a local copy and add local paths to my include path? \nI'm sure there was a reason for this file layout by the install, but I can't think of what it might be?  Any guidance about best practice here would be appreciated.\n\nA: The proper way to solve this would be to add in -I/usr/include/gtk-2.0 as part of the compile command. However, ideally, this isn't directly included. Instead, the pkg-config tool can provide the CFLAGS to add and the libraries to link to (in the ld command) for the required libraries.\nThe libgtk2.0-dev package ships with 5 different pkg-config files: gtk+-x11-2.0.pc, gtk+-unix-print-2.0.pc, gtk+-2.0.pc, gdk-2.0.pc, and gdk-x11-2.0.pc.

The commands that you tried redirected only stdout.  Under bash, you can redirect the output from both streams at once using:\ncommand &>test.txt &\n\nOr \ncommand &>/dev/null &\n\nIf you are using a POSIX shell, then you need to do the redirection in steps:\ncommand >test.txt 2>&1 &\n\n>test.txt redirects stdout to the file test.txt.  Because stderr is file handle 2, the effect of 2>&1 is to redirect stderr to wherever stdout, denoted by &1 is currently going.\n\nA: It looks like the output is going to the error stream, stderr - so redirect that instead of stdout: \ncommand 2> errors.txt\nOr redirect both together to the same file:\ncommand > errors.txt 2>&1\nIn case you want to know the whole thing - \"jump into the rabbit hole\" - see Illustrated Redirection Tutorial\nSee also nohup - it's useful if you want to keep the command running after closing the terminal:\nnohup command\n(man nohup for details)\n", "Q: Can't connect to one wifi network, keeps asking for password Here's the relevant syslog stuff: http://pastie.org/9405812\nHere's the output from the wireless-info script: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7821949/\nMy wifi works well in general, I only have problems with this network.

I saw tons of threads explaining how to create a 32 bit prefix, but I want to check if the prefix I'm using is 32 bit or 64 bit. The reason I'm asking is that I'm using PlayOnLinux, and I've created a 32 bit virtual drive (for example X). Now when I open winetricks in the folder ~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix, wineprefix gives me the message\n\nYou are using a 64-bit WINEPREFIX. If you encounter problems, please retest in a clean 32-bit WINEPREFIX before reporting a bug.\n\nBut, when I opened wineprefix in ~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/X, the message didn't appear. \nHow can I check if the prefix is 32 vs 64 bit?\n\nA: I needed something similar in a script so made this script based on @wilf's answer:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n## Wine can spam stderr\nERRLOG=/tmp/dllerrlog.log\n\nWINESYSDIR=$( winepath -u c:\\\\windows\\\\system32 2> $ERRLOG )    \nif [[ ${WINESYSDIR} == *\"/system32\" ]]; then\n  echo \"Prefix is 32 bit\"\n  # do 32 bit stuff here...\nelif [[ ${WINESYSDIR} == *\"/syswow64\"* ]]; then\n  echo \"Prefix is 64 bit\"\n  # do 64 bit stuff here...\nelse\n  echo \"Unknown wine architecture\"\nfi\n\nAnd here is some output:\n$ ./winearch.sh \nPrefix is 64 bit\n\nAnd on a 32 bit wine prefix I have:\n$ WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 ./winearch.sh \nPrefix is 32 bit\n\n\nA: If you are using PlayOnLinux, you can check which version using the GUI - open PlayOnLinux, click 'Configure' on the relevant program, and look at the pane on the left:\n\nAlternatively, you can do what winetricks does (in version 20140817, circa line 3600), which is check the wineprefix for the presence of the directory WINEPREFIX/drive_c/windows/syswow64, which should be found in 64bit windows/wineprefix, but not 32bit versions. This should work for ordinary wineprefixes and those under PlayOnLinux.\n\nA: \nThanks to @wilf's for 'WINEPREFIX/drive_c/windows/syswow64' (it works)..\nbut i have been editing the wine registry to find any entry that reveals\nwhat winearch the system is using (win32 or win64), and i have found it in:\ncat /root/.wine/system.reg | grep -m 1 '#arch' | cut -d '=' -f2\n\nThis command displays: win32 (32 bit) or win64 (64 bit)\n\n\nBellow its one example how to use this in scripting:\n  #!/bin/sh\n  HkLm=$(cat /root/.wine/system.reg | grep -m 1 '#arch' | cut -d '=' -f2) > /dev/null 2>&1 # winearch (regedit)\n  if [ \"$HkLm\" = \"win64\" ]; then\n    echo \"[x] winearch config: $HkLm (64 bits)\"\n    echo \"[i] Please run:$IPATH/bin/enable_x32bits_wine.sh\"\n    exit\n  fi\n\nFinal notes: i have tested this on kali linux..\nif WINEPREFIX=/root/.wine32 then cat command must contain that directory  to be able to read inside folder for regedit winearch settings.\n\nA: All you have to do is, Browse the PlayonLinux's Virtual Drives. Go to the WINEPREFIX/drive_c/ folder and look for Program Files folder. \nIf you only see the Program Files and no ProgramFiles(x86) Then you are using 32 bit Wine Prefix. If you see both then you are using 64 Bit Wine Prefix.\nHope this helps !!\n\nA: You could install winetricks, and type this in the terminal:\n sudo apt-get install winetricks\n\nand then run winetricks, and then you can see it in preference.\n", "Q: Running a .sh to execute multiple commands I was curious how I would go about running multiple commands via shell script.\nFor example, just to try it out, I'd like to be able to connect a .desktop to a .sh that will run all the update codes so I don't have to type it out. I know how to execute a single command via a .sh, not multiple.\nAny way?\n\nA: Simple really - you need to separate the commands. For instance this:\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nwill update the package lists, and then the packages. Another possibility is this (probably better, as the && will only allow the upgrade command to run if the update exits successfully):\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThis should run the commands for updating the list of packages and then the package themselves. This would need to be saved into a text file (e.g. updatescript in the home directory). You can then make it executable by running:\n chmod +x ./updatescript\n\nor by right clicking on the file and making it executable in its properties:\n\nand run it with this in terminal:\n ./updatescript\n\nNote(s):\nThere is an option (-y) available that can be used with the upgrade command so it does not prompt before upgrading the packages. It is a good idea to check what apt-get is doing before it upgrades the packages, as it may/will do something stupid or something you don't want it do. More info on options like this can be found by running man apt-get.\nThis also means it is more ideal to use the terminal to run the script, as you can check what it is updating, and then run it. If you want a GUI way to run the updates, use the software-center as that it is what it is for.\n\nA: Just to add a few points to the excellent answer by @Wilf,\nyou can run commands in paralell if you want for any reason, for example, an autostart script for OpenBox might look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nnitrogen --restore &\ntint2 &\ntilda\n\nThis will set a background image using nitrogen, start the panel tint2 and start the Quake3-style dropdown console tilda, all at the same time. This is useful if you don't need a program to finish before you launch the next one. Not the case for apt-get update and apt-get upgrade though!\nNotice the & sign at the end of each line. This will cause the shell to fork that process into the background and continue execution. Note how it's different from &&, which is basically an and sign, command_1 && command_2 will executecommand_1 and if it exits with success, only then run command_2, while command_1 & command_2 will start the second right after the first.\n\nAlso, you could just stack commands to have them executed serially, like so:\n#!/bin/bash\n\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\n\nThis will run apt-get upgrade after apt-get update is finished, but regardless of the result. So even if, for example, the update quits with a network error, the upgrade will still be run.\nYou can also do this in one line, using the ; sign: apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade. Again, this solution is not optimal for these particular commands, but it might come in handy in other situations.\n\nOne quick final point, you can also break lines containing && as such:\ncommand_1 &&\ncommand_2\n\nThis will be the same as command_1 && command_2.\n", "Q: How can I configure multiple MaaS environments for juju? i've realized a vMaaS with 3 vnodes where i deployed juju-gui (node1) and openstack in the other 2 nodes (node2,node3).

I'm facing a hard time with Linux 3.13 from Trusty but, it is another topic (http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-server@lists.ubuntu.com/msg06775.html), so, I decided to backport the Linux 3.16 from Utopic.\nAlso, I'll need to sign my Linux version with my GPG key and upload it to my PPA later but, first, I am unable to bump +1 to Linux revision version... Can someone help me with that?!\nHere is the procedure to manually backport it (which works, as-is, without bumping +1 to revision version):\nInstructions from: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel\n1- Add Utopic's deb-src to Trusty's sources.list:\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ utopic main restricted universe multiverse\n\n2- Run the following commands:\nmkdir ~/linux/source -p\ncd ~/linux/source\nsudo apt-get install fakeroot\nsudo apt-get build-dep linux\napt-get source linux\ncd linux-3.16.0/\ndebuild -uc -us\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.16.0-4_3.16.0-4.9_all.deb linux-headers-3.16.0-4-generic_3.16.0-4.9_amd64.deb linux-image-3.16.0-4-generic_3.16.0-4.9_amd64.deb linux-image-extra-3.16.0-4-generic_3.16.0-4.9_amd64.deb\n\n3- Done!

Some things are bothering me, and maybe if I can understand why they are a certain way, I can rest my mind a bit.\nIn Windows, about 95% of folder and file names make sense. They clearly describe their purpose.\nOn linux, the official User Manual, states the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*/bin and /sbin: Stores many essential system applications\n\n*/etc: Stores System-wide configuration files.\nMy question is, Why are folder names so silly / stupid / weird / unrelated to their purpose?\nWhy would \"essential system applications\" be placed in a folder named after a thing that is used to hold unwanted things? (bin)\nWhy would \"system-wide configuration files\" be stored in a folder called \"etc\"?\n\nA: Most of the directory names are not unrelated, but simply too short to be comprehensible without further knowledge. But this is not just a Linux issue. Other Unix-like systems as Apple's OS X for example or Solaris use the same weird names. And since you mentioned Windows... You just have to dig deeper. For example the hosts file for windows has this weird path: \nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\n\nThere you have your unrelated \"etc\" again ;-)\nFor a quick overview over the role of the different Linux directory names take a look to this Wikipedia article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard\n\nA: bin first of all means binary, and despite it is also the different word bin nobody associated it to any bin but binary. It was always clean in the context of Unix. Also they were needed to use really shorts, preferably three-lettered words, when they were always typing a lot. As a compliance it is still there.\n\nA: *\n\n*/bin stands for binaries, /sbin stands for system binaries\n\n*etc stands for etcetera (this directory historically held everything that did not belong elsewhere)\n\n\nYou  can read more here and here; and on Wikipedia.\n", "Q: Failed to load package lists error I get a 'Failed to load package lists' - this didn't work:\nsudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf\nsudo apt-get update\n\nHere is a screenshot\n  \nI am using the live cd\n\nA: Answered by OP in comments:\n\naah never mind i loged out and in and it worked.\n\nHowever, they were using the Live CD, so this question probably won't apply to anyone.\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 with windows 7 dual boot problem I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 using Live USB.

I (@KazWolfe) have moved it to Community Wiki status to actually have it in the right section.

Upon running \"check disk errors\" from the Ubuntu ISO, my system worked again.\n\nA: I am not sure, if you created/moved/extended some other partitions that now claim the space that previously was your windows partition.\nIf you did not do such a thing, then the good news is, that your data is still there, but the operating system does not know it.\nTherefore, you may have a chance (not a guarantee) to recover your data by following this procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new partition /dev/sda1 on the location where the windows partition should be. In your case, the best guess would be to claim all the free space shown by gparted at the beginning of your hard drive. Do not format the partition!\n\n*Set the partition type to NTFS. Apparently, this cannot be done in gparted, but the following may help:\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\nCommand (m for help): t\nPartition number (1-7): 1\nHex code (type L to list codes): 7\nCommand (m for help): w\n\n\n*Reboot your machine. Hopefully, the lost data on the partition will reappear.\n\n*Backup your windows data!\n\n\nDo not format the newly created partition! Formatting would basically tell the system to remove all information about where to find the files on the resurrected partition.\nEdit:\nThe partition code 7 is NTFS. If the partition was FAT32, then the code would be c instead of 7. If you enter an uppercase L instead of a partition number, then fdisk will show you the list of possible codes.\n", "Q: How to properly quote piped command for \"watch\"?

I use awk because I don't need other stuff, just the file size.\nBut I'm unable to use this with watch command, because if I try\nwatch ls -hal ./file |awk '{print $5}'\n\nthen watch only accepts ls -hal ./file and then pipes it to awk, giving no output.\nIf I try\nwatch \"ls -hal ./file |awk '{print $5}'\"\n\nthen it gets weird showing wrong command and whole output.\nEvery 2.0s: ls -hal ./file |awk '{print }'              Sun Jul 20 15:52:18 2014\n\n-rw-rw---- 1 aditya aditya 1.7K Jul 20 15:52 ./file\n\nYou can see there is no $5 in the awk command.\nFurther quoting creates various similar errors.\nSo what is the right way to quote this command?\n\nA: One option would be to escape the $ in your awk expression\nwatch \"ls -hal ./file |awk '{print \\$5}'\"\n\nAlternatively, you could avoid the issue altogether by using stat instead of parsing the output of ls\nwatch stat -c '%s' ./file\n\n\nA: Use following command :\nwatch 'ls -hal ./file|cut -d \" \" -f 5'\n\nAnd if you want to highlight difference than,\nwatch -d 'ls -hal ./file|cut -d \" \" -f 5'\n\nThis will give work as you want!\n", "Q: Audio input prompt not updated I am currently running 14.04 on a dell xps 13.

After the installation of Ubuntu (from live-usb) on a new partion my computer (HP Elitebook 8570W) only booted windows 8.1 without letting me choose. Therefore, I decided to run Boot Repair by using the ubuntu live-usb. See Boot Repair boot info summary. However, when starting up my computer it gives an error saying \"BootDevice Not Found\" and \"Hard Disk - (3F0)\". I'm quite new to ubuntu and don't know a lot about bootdevices etc. Any help is very much appreciated.\n\nA: It is not the smartest answer, but you may solve it with Easy BCD. It's a tool used to modify the booting options. Download it to Windows 8, install it and there you will get the option to modify Windows boot by adding Ubuntu to boot list. Despite It worked for me, later on I decided to uninstall Windows 8.1 cause It made Ubuntu to boot unproperly (in my case).\n", "Q: Virus infection in Ubuntu 14.04 I am using Ubuntu 14.04.My computer is infected by viruses or malicious software installed without my knowledge during web surfing.

Secondly, the reason you're receiving the error with Google is most likely not due to the fact that you have a virus on your Ubuntu install (Linux and GNU user-space works a whole lot differently than Windows (unimportant)), but rather that you have another infected computer on your local network, are using an infected VPN to connect, or your IP was recently changed by your ISP to a previously-malicious address that Google is blocking.\n\nA: You might want to change your IP, as it may have previously used to host a malicious address that websites will block. If you don't know how to change your IP, look at this guide, How to change your IP in Ubuntu, while that guide is for an older version, it should still work. If that doesn't work, call your ISP and ask them to change it for you.\n", "Q: Does Virtual Box supports 64 bit of Ubuntu I am trying to install Ubuntu 14 as a guest OS using Virtual Box. The host is Windows 8.1. \nVirtualization is enabled. Still the Virtual Box shows only the 32-bit option for installing Ubuntu (see Virtual Box screenshot). \nProcessor used is AMD A10 Processsor and Virtualization is enabled in BIOS (see Task Manager screenshot).\nI have checked other posts related to this one and they all say that Virtual Box supports guest OS to be Ubuntu 64 bit, what else do I need to do ?\n\n\n\nA: Found that Hyper-V needs to be disabled/uninstalled. You can disable Hyper-V without uninstalling it. Start a command prompt with administrator rights and execute the following command:\n// to disable hyper-v\nbcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off\n\n// to enable hyper-v\nbcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto\n\nBoth Operations require restarting your computer.\nSo once you disable Hyper-V and restart, 64 versions start coming in the list.\n\nA: VirtualBox supports 64-bit guest operating systems, even on 32-bit host operating systems, provided that the following conditions are met:\nYou need a 64-bit processor with hardware virtualization support (see Section 10.3, “Hardware vs. software virtualization”).\nYou must enable hardware virtualization for the particular VM for which you want 64-bit support; software virtualization is not supported for 64-bit VMs.\nIf you want to use 64-bit guest support on a 32-bit host operating system, you must also select a 64-bit operating system for the particular VM. Since supporting 64 bits on 32-bit hosts incurs additional overhead, VirtualBox only enables this support upon explicit request.\nOn 64-bit hosts (which typically come with hardware virtualization support), 64-bit guest operating systems are always supported regardless of settings, so you can simply install a 64-bit operating system in the guest.\nWarning\nOn any host, you should enable the I/O APIC for virtual machines that you intend to use in 64-bit mode. This is especially true for 64-bit Windows VMs. See Section 3.3.2, “\"Advanced\" tab”. In addition, for 64-bit Windows guests, you should make sure that the VM uses the Intel networking device, since there is no 64-bit driver support for the AMD PCNet card; see Section 6.1, “Virtual networking hardware”.\nIf you use the \"Create VM\" wizard of the VirtualBox graphical user interface (see Section 1.7, “Creating your first virtual machine”), VirtualBox will automatically use the correct settings for each selected 64-bit operating system type.\nSource\n", "Q: No internet connection OK so I installed 14.04 from a usb.

I am usually running backintime-kde on ubuntu in the following way:\nsudo su\nssh-agent bash\nbackintime-kde4 --config /root/.config/backintime/config --profile-id 1\n\nThis is the only way I found which was working on my system. In particular \nsudo backintime-kde4\n\nand \nkdesudo backintime-kde4 \n\nwill not work.\nI would like to allow ordinary users who do not have permissions to run sudo su to execute backintime as well. Can I somehow create a shell-script from the commands which can be executed by any user such that he has to enter at most his own password (and maybe that of the ssh-key).\nPlease do not suggest alternate ways of running backintime. I merely search a method equivalent to the one described above (such that backintime operates in the same tested way). However the user should be able to run it without being able to obtain general root privileges.\n\nA: There seems to be more than one issue:\n1. Bug #1276348\nssh-agent is missing in backintime-kde in versions <= 1.0.34.

Make various users able to run BackInTime as root\nFirst of all: this is very dangerous and I will NOT recommend doing this!\nYour users will have write access to the whole system. They can change every configuration, spy on other users home folders and break the whole system. This will undermine every security concept of Linux.\nYou should rather configure BackInTime for every single user so they will just backup their own home. This way they don't need root permissions at all and you and I can sleep well again ;-)\nIf you still want to do so you could create a new group sudo addgroup backintime and add your users as members sudo adduser <USER> backintime. Then add this line to /etc/sudoers\n%backintime ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/backintime-kde4\n\nLog out and log in with <USER> to activate the group membership and you should be able to run kdesudo -c /usr/bin/backintime-kde4 without being asked for a password.

I've been using English as my system language, but Greek for regional formats.\nThe thing is I want the date and time to appear in English too, while preserving the rest of my settings in the regional format settings (e.g. euro sign for the currency, metric system etc etc).\nThe reason is clearly aesthetic, although I assume that for some other languages (e.g. Arabic, etc) it should be also a practical reason since the date and time in terminal would not appear correct.\n\nA: Open your ~/.profile file for editing, add this line:\nexport LC_TIME=en_DK.UTF-8\n\nand relogin. That will result in date and time formats in accordance with ISO 8601. If you like those ambiguous American date formats, set en_US.UTF-8 instead, etc.\n", "Q: When deleting a file in Nautilus, what's the difference between `del` and `shift+del`?

I guess as the root password is default user account password (if i am wrong correct me) in terminal when I type su it asks me password when I enter my password it says Authentication failure why is it happening?? \n\nA: By default Ubuntu does not set up a root password and therefore you don't get the ability to log in as root.  Instead you are given the ability to perform tasks with superuser privileges using sudo.\nI've answered a similar question before.\nWhile you can create a password for the root account allowing you to log in as root with su, this isn't the typical \"Ubuntu\" way of doing things.\nSudo is an alternative to giving people a root password in order to perform superuser duties.  In a default Ubuntu install the person who installed the OS is given \"sudo\" permission by default.\nAnybody with \"sudo\" permission may perform something \"as a superuser\" by pre-pending sudo to their command.  For instance, to run apt-get dist-upgrade as a superuser, you could use:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nYou will see this usage of sudo pretty much anywhere you read a tutorial about Ubuntu on the web.  It's an alternative to doing this.\nsu\napt-get dist-upgrade\nexit\n\nWith sudo, you choose in advance which users have sudo access. There is no need for them to remember a root password, as they use their own password.  If you have multiple users, you can revoke one's superuser access just by removing their sudo permission, without needing to change the root password and notify everyone of a new password.  You can even choose which commands a user is allowed to perform using sudo and which commands are forbidden for that user.  And lastly, if there is a security breach it can in some cases leave a better audit trail showing which user account was compromised.\nSudo makes it easier to perform a single command with superuser privileges.  With su, you permanently drop to a superuser shell which must be exited using exit or logout.  This can lead to people staying in the superuser shell for longer than necessary just because it's more convenient than logging out and in again later.\nWith sudo, you still have the option of opening a permanent (interactive) superuser shell with the command:\nsudo su\n\n... and this can still be done without any root password, because sudo gives superuser privileges to the su command.\nAnd similarly, instead of su - for a login shell you can use sudo su - or even sudo -i.\nHowever when doing so you just need to be aware that you are acting as a superuser for every command.  It's a good security principle not to stay as a superuser for longer than necessary, just to lessen the possibility of accidentally causing some damage to the system (without it, you can only damage files your user owns).\nJust to clarify, you can, if you choose, give the root user a password allowing logins as root, if you specifically want to do things this way instead.  I just wanted to let you know about the Ubuntu convention of preferring sudo instead and let you know that there is an alternative.\n", "Q: Komodo Edit does not show correct file association icons the main problem which I'm tring to resolve is that my Komodo Edit text editor all of a sudden began to show Mathematica icon for every file (yesterday I just had installed Mathematica 10). This is very annoying, and I will be very grateful to anyone who will be able to solve this. \n\nWhat I have found for now is that this is somehow related to the global settings, because when I forbid any access to a directory where Mathematica is installed, that is Komodo has no way to get an icon from this directory, but still shows it for every file.\nAlso I tried to remove the profile directory for Komodo - no result.\nSo the question is:\ndoes anyone know where Komodo-Edit or other program can get this icons? They are not stored in its installation directory and the access to the mathematica directory is forbidden completely (000).\nCould anyone help me with this? How can I get rid of these Mathematica icons?\nThank you.\n\nA: Finally, after intermittently being struggling for five month with this, I've figured this out.\nIn short: one need to delete a hidden file ~/.local/share/icons/.png which is created by a Mathematica installation script.\nWith a bit more explanation: after I gave up to find the reason for this problem from a Komodo side, I tried to find how icons for mime types are managed in Ubuntu. So, with the help of Google, stackexchange and danjjl's answer I decided to search in the .local/share/icons directory, where I immediately spotted this hidden file.\n", "Q: What does host% mean in command line? I see this a lot in terminal commands and didn't understand what does it mean. also the terminal doesn't recognize it.\n\nA: I assume you're seeing this host% in documentation.  It stands for the shell prompt.  (\"Shell\" is the program that reads the commands you type; \"prompt\" is the little bit of text that this program displays on your screen to say that it's ready to read your next command.)\nIf you look at a terminal window on your computer you'll probably see something like\nmy-computer-name%\non the last line, where \"my-computer-name\" is of course your computer's name.  This is prompting you (i.e., inviting you) to type a command.  So now you go and type ls and carriage return, and the shell prints some output.  \nLinux documentation typically uses host% to indicate the prompt (\"host\" is another name for \"computer\").\nThis host%  It's not meant to be typed: it just indicates that what follows in the document is to be typed.  \n\nA: I open this question because it is got me interested. I did't know what is host%. But the answer is more easier then I was thinking.\nI'v google it and found this tutorial, where we can see this magically host%.\nThis is so called Shell Prompt. Thing that usually appear before each command in terminal emulator. It is usually provide some information to user. Previously it has been used to show host name, that's why you can see host% it some documentation and tutorials. Imagine that you have opened a few terminal sessions to a different hosts. There is a chance that you get confused and type some command to the wrong terminal. I think that's why Prompt is exists.\nIn Ubuntu it is usually look like this:\nusername@hostname:path $\n\nWhere:\n\nusername - Currently logged in user login\nhostname - This host's name\npath     - Showing path to the folder. The  current  working  directory,  with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde\n$     - End of prompt, and start of new command\n\nYou can customize Bash Prompt if you want. Here is my prompt:\n22:33:16 - (~/Downloads)$\n\ncurrent_time - (path)$\n\nHere is nice tutorial for customizing it\n\nA: Host% is nothing but a prompt with host name (your computer name) saying that the shell is ready to accept commands. This prompt can be set to username or it can show time or date etc.  \n", "Q: Booting ubuntu iso file from grub menu I follow Grub2 ISO boot guide\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot\nhere is my menu for iso booting\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu 14.04 Live\" {\n     set isofile=\"/lilw/os/ubuntu.iso\"\n     loopback loop (hd0,10)$isofile\n     linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz.efi boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile noprompt noeject\n     initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz\n}\n\nbut I failed to boot from iso file, it always make my system reboot.No message giving out so I don't know what happen.\nIf I get into grub menu and then using command at\ngrub >\n\ntyping these follow command:\ngrub > loopback loop (hd0,10)/lilw/os/ubuntu.iso\ngrub > linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz.efi boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile noprompt noeject\ngrub > initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz\n\nand then\ngrub > boot\n\nit will boot to the iso normally.\nI don't want to boot this way.

Luckily some commands are similar to DOS and batch code.  \nI use a router and have no issues with other wireless devices at the moment, including another laptop running 14.04, but it is an older Aspire One.\nHere is the info from the wireless_script that I found on the forum:\n======== Wireless-Info START ========\n\nSystem-Info ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSatellite-C655D 3.13.0-32-generic x86_64,  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, trusty\n\nCPU    : AMD C-50 Processor\nMemory : 2606 MB\nUptime : 11:38:53 up  2:59,  2 users,  load average: 0.53, 0.67, 0.69\n\nlspci ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

best.\nThird set your wireless channel in the router to 1 or 11 then save the router configuration and reboot it.\nFourth go into network manager at top right corner of the screen and click on edit connections>wireless tab and set IPV6 to ignore.  \nNow open the terminal CTRL+ALT+_T then copy and paste the following code one line at a time for accuracy:\necho \"options rtl8192ce swenc=1 ips=0\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8192ce.conf\nsudo modprobe -rfv rtl8192ce\nsudo modprobe -v rtl8192ce\n\n\nA: I had the same problem - I was lazy so I did only No. 4\n\"go into network manager at top

Thanks\n", "Q: Need good example of .vimrc file I wanted to start using Vim, and need to create .vimrc configuration file for it.

It interprets that whole string as the name of a command!  Try this instead: -e \"bash -c 'command ; bash'\".  This way what gets run on your terminal window is  command, and after that runs, you're given a daughter shell, which I assume is what you want.  Incidentally, you can also say 'command & bash'; this will run the command on the background and give you the daughter shell right away. \n\nA: Try this:\noptions+=($tab --title=\"${titles[i]}\"  -e \"bash -c \\\"${cmds[i]} ; bash\\\"\" ) \n\notherwise the whole expression after -e will be interpreted as the command.\nTo include aliases from .bashrc use -ic instead of c\n", "Q: ''EFI boot partition'' and ''biosgrub'' partition Why do I need these? I have installed Ubuntu under a non UEFI (master boot record) and have installed Ubuntu with no 'biosgrub' and it works fine, whereas other times I am asked to make a 'biosgrub' partition.  I have no idea why sometimes I need it and others I don't (these have both been on the same system).\nAnd the same thing happens when I use UEFI (GUID Partition Table).  The only difference is I am asked to make a 'EFI boot partition', but as with the 'biosgrub', sometimes I am asked to make it and sometimes I am not asked to make it.\nFor my current install I was asked to make one but I didn't and my system is fine. There is no change in the system, same hardware, BIOS etc... Could anyone shed light on this?\n\nA: You need to create a biosgrub partition on a GPT partitioned disk when setting up legacy booting or an EFI boot partition (for both GPT or MBR partitioned disk) when setting up UEFI booting.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*GRUB requires a BIOS Boot Partition (2 MiB, no filesystem, EF02 type code in gdisk or bios_grub flag in GNU Parted) in BIOS systems to embed its core.img file due to lack of post-MBR embed gap in GPT disks. [...]\n  \n  \n  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPT#Bootloader_Support\n\n\nA: I will give one extra point/motive for having both, EFI and BIOS grub.\nUSB stick to boot a Live SystemRescueCD.iso loop from Grub2.\nWhy? Simple answer: it will boot on a lot of PCs, some has UEFI some has only 32 bit old BIOS, etc.\nReal complex motive: use advanced hardware (UEFI) if possible.\nReal live use sample:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB stick (formated on GPT mode) with four partitions\n\n*First partition (able to be seen from Windows 7 and up) on NTFS with the rest of the size of the USB stick\n\n*Second partition for Grub2 and SystemRescueCD.iso file with at least 1GiB (better if 2GiB so you can carry two versions of SystemRescueCD.iso at same time, just for testing the new version prior to replace the old one), i normally use Ext4 filesystem for it\n\n*Third partition for EFI (what windows call ESP) formatted as Fat32 with at least 512MiB (i have seen some PCs that if using less they do not show USB stick as a bootable media)\n\n*Fourth partition for BIOS_Grub (no format, but cleared when created)\n\n\nOne important thing: I have seen a 8GiB LG USB stric (one i own) that refuses to be listed on an physical UEFI PC boot if partitions are not aligned to cylinders, but be seen on other UEFI PCs and also on VirtualBOX with UEFI boot mode activated... when partitioning it if aligned to MiB it does used all space, no near 1MiB unpartitioned space at end, but when aligned to cylinders the last incomplete MiB is not used... if i do MiB partitioning having that in mind (in other words i do a manual cylinder align) it works, but as i am saying it is still cylinder aligned (i am doing it manually instead of letting the partitioning tool to do it for you).\nHow to get such great USB recovery stick (it has two tricks):\n\n\n*\n\n*Align partitions to Cylinders (better compatibility to just align to MiB)\n\n*Do a grub-install --target=i386-pc and then do another grub-install --target=x86_64-efi on the same grub partition, so you use only one grub.cfg for both boot modes\n\n\nHow it boots:\n\n\n*\n\n*a) booting form old BIOS, will load MBR, then Stage2 of grub form BIOS_grub partition, then core.img from Grub2 partition\n\n*b) booting form UEFI compatible, will load .efi file from ESP partition\n\n*grub.cfg is readed (if exists on grub2 partition)\n\n*then grub2 menu is shown\n\n*then i select to boot from loop SystemRescueCD.iso (with dochace parameter), i have set two options set on grub.cfg, one for 32Bits, one for 64Bits (i have really four options, since i set on two a dostartx parameter to boot directly on GUI).\n\n*after boot i can eject the usb stick (the whole Live Linux is in ramdrive thanks to such docache), no need to type any command, pendrive is not mounted (again thanks to docache parameter).\n\n\nWith this stick i can boot old PC (if they let to boot from USB) in 32 bits or also 64 bits (if they have extension etend on procesor), but booting in BIOS mode.\nWith this stick i can also boot new PC (if they let to boot from USB) in 32 bits and 64 bits, but booting in UEFI mode (ah, yes it can boot in UEFI mode and then just boot Linux Live SystemRescueCD in 32 bit mode as well as in 64 bit mode).\nSo i have all in one usb stick recovery boot media, capable of booting in near all PCs, modern or old (only need USB boot support), no matter if 32bits or 64 bits, BIOS or UEFI, etc... and i can select what i want to run 32bits or 64bits.\nAlso more, i had tested on a PC that refuses to install Windows 64Bits (old 32Bits procesor), but be able to run a 64bit Linux Live (because PAE capability exists on that processor).\nSide note: Such first partition as NTFS is for holding data that can be shared with Windows 7 and up (XP will not see it since does not support GPT partitioning)... it must be the first one, no need to be on initial part of the disc, can be wherever you want, but mush reside as first entry on partition table, this is caused by hateable windows mode to mount partitions on removable, it has code specificaly programmed to avoid accessing more than the first partition, so you can not mount the others at the same time.\nExtra for Windows and USB partitions: If you swap partitions entries on partitiong table, in other words you put the partition you want to access as the first one in the table, windows will let you to access it (if its format is understand, fat32 and NTFS directly, ext2 with special drivers, etc), but will only let access to the one that is located on first entry of the partition table... there is a tool (called BootICEx86.exe) that can do such work on Windows without even need to unplug the usb stick.\nSuper extra: there is also some pendrives (i am very lucky to own one, a Sony 16GiB) than can be bit changed with special tools (mine with a tool from lexar) so they appear to Windows as an USB HDD instead a USB stick, after that change, all windows will let you delete, create and manage partitions on it, also more than one at same time can be mounted, each one with its own letter.\nLinux users does not worry with that, since Linux see it as a partitionable block device and does not implement special code to block mounting partitions, etc, as windows has.\nOh, yes this last paragraphs are written just in case some one on M$ read them, so their face drop down to floor, i am trying (will not get it never, i know it is a lost objetive) to them to remove such ugly code from Windows and let users have partitions on usb stick in a native manner.\n\nA: There are four conditions (BIOS vs. EFI and MBR vs. GPT), but two of them have identical needs (and one of those is exceedingly rare):\n\n\n*\n\n*On a traditional BIOS-based computer with a traditional MBR partition table, GRUB's executable code gets spread around like spaghetti thrown by a baby. Some of it's in the boot-code section of the MBR, some of it's in post-MBR sectors that are officially unallocated, and some of it's in the Linux /boot partition. This is a real mess, and it works only because developers have had literally decades to create clever hacks and work out (almost) all the kinks.\n\n*On a traditional BIOS-based computer with a new GUID Partition Table (GPT), the GRUB code is similar to that in the preceding case; however, the sectors immediately following the MBR are not unallocated; they're used by the GPT itself. GPT offers no analogous place for GRUB to hijack, so GRUB's developers settled on the BIOS Boot Partition (which GParted and parted identify by a bios_grub flag) to hold the code that would go in the post-MBR sectors on an MBR disk. This is actually safer and cleaner than the MBR approach, since it serves to protect the GRUB code from other programs that might try to use that unallocated space.\n\n*On a computer with a newer EFI rather than a BIOS, boot loaders are not stored in the MBR, in officially-unallocated post-MBR sectors, or in BIOS Boot Partitions; instead, boot loaders reside as ordinary files on a FAT partition known as the EFI System Partition (ESP). (Confusingly, Debian and Ubuntu installers refer to the ESP by the name \"EFI boot partition,\" but this name is non-standard. GParted and parted identify the ESP as having its \"boot flag\" set, although that terminology means something completely different on MBR disks.) An ESP can exist on either a GPT disk or an MBR disk, but the former is much more common on EFI-based computers. The EFI approach is much safer and much more flexible than the BIOS approach, since it doesn't tuck raw code away in weird places; boot loaders reside in files, just like OS-level programs. This makes them easier to identify and manipulate. (OTOH, EFI also stores data on boot loaders in NVRAM, which creates a second point of failure in the boot process. EFI's newness also means it's not as well-tested, which accounts for a host of EFI-specific problems.)\n\n\nGhostMotleyX, your comment to LiveWireBT's response opined that the \"best\" way to install is BIOS/MBR. This is subjective, of course, but I disagree with that assessment. The BIOS/MBR approach is the least safe and the most clumsy of the three approaches I've just outlined. The EFI approach is the safest and most flexible approach. I suspect you're getting hung up on the fact that separate partitions are required for the GRUB/GPT and EFI approaches, but that's not a big deal. Aside from when setting up the system or doing partition maintenance, those partitions will be pretty much invisible to you, and they give you a lot of flexibility. Unlike MBR, GPT is not limited to four primary partitions, so you needn't hoard your primary partitions like a leprechaun hoarding his gold.\n", "Q: My wireless does not work on rtl8723ae I have Ubuntu 14.04.

One messy workspace will basically ruin the workspaces next to it. Also if a window  sitting more than 50% over the workspace is maximized it will maximize on the other workspace causing it to disappear from the current workspace.\nHow can I stop this from happening?\n\nA: I had the same question. Apparently there is only a partial solution. Answer from : How to stop windows from moving past the edge of a workspace?\n\nThis is currently a defect in Unity/Compiz. The best you can do is to\n  enable edge stickiness. In ccsm (not installed by default because it's\n  unstable as all get out), go to Window Management and enable \"Snapping\n  windows\".\n\nInstall ccsm by sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nMake sure all 4 check boxes are checked and set resistance to 60 and\n  attraction to 20.\nThis should help you keep your windows on a workstation.\nHowever this is one of those taste things. Some people want things to\n  span like this, others hate it. I personally am in the hate it group.\n  I hope I am wrong, and that someone has a magic answer, but this is\n  the best I have been able to find.\nJust to make it clear, this won't stop the behavior, but it will make\n  it a bit easier to manage.\n\n", "Q: Help booting from disk I already have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installed on my computer, but I would like to get Windows back onto it. The only problem is that I can't boot from any CD/USB/SD, all I get is the GRUB boot menu, without an option for the Windows 7 install CD. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I have had this in the past, I had to manually boot from the Disk/USB by going into the 'Boot Menu' when your PC boots you will see at the bottom of the screen something like 'F12 Boot Menu' it is usually F12, F4, F7 and I think I once saw Backspace. From here manually select the Windows 7 media and press Enter, from here you should be fine. If you have a really old PC it might not have a 'Boot Menu' so you will have to go into the BIOS (when the PC is booting hit the corresponding 'F' kry to get into the BIOS [Usually F2] and change the boot order so the Windows Media is the first priority, your PC will most likely have a boot menu. \n", "Q: How to hide unity launcher border line I'm on 14.04. I have my launcher on full transparency and I've hidden the containing boxes, and to complete the picture and have the icons completely hovering, it'd be nice to hide the border line or change the colour. Is that possible? \n\n\nA: As far as I know, that is not configurable.\nIf you go to the Unity Plugin options under Compiz Config Manager, you will not see any option regarding to that separation line.\nAn option should be added to the Compiz plugin in order to control that. Otherwise, download the code, modify it and compile your own Unity package without the line :-/\n", "Q: How to get partially localized system? My Ubuntu 14.04 is in Polish and this translation is quite low quality. How to set up Ubuntu so that it is displayed in English, but keep calendar and date format Polish-like (i.e. week starting from Monday, not Sunday)?\n\nA: Go to System Settings -> Language Support. Change the language, but let the regional formats setting remain Polish.\n\nA: If you have an Installed version: Go to System Settings -> Language Support and under Language tab choose English as the language for menus and windows.

I just added an SSL certificate to Apache. The problem is that Apache runs on system startup and after my server turns on, Apache runs but doesn't run. I put in the IP address of my computer and my browser just keeps trying to connect. I see a spinning circle.\nThen I get on my server, kill all Apache-related processes, and run sudo service apache2 restart. Because of the sudo I am prompted for my super-user password, but after I put it in, Apache asks for the password for the .key file. I put it in and then Apache works fine. The SSL even works.\nSo why does Apache not work until I restart it? Is it because it wants me to put in the password every startup? If so, how do I do that on my Xubuntu server? Can I make it so I won't have to put it in every time?\n\nA: It appears that the private key for your SSL certificate is password-protected. To test whether this is really the case, examine the beginning of your keyfile using the command head -3 your.key. This private key is encrypted:\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nProc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED\nDEK-Info: AES-128-CBC,C251E8A1254B933D763703EE1C364AB7\n\nThis file is not encrypted:\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEowIBAAKCAQEAvbeWtO9nQP4cFFuhGrOM/WQ73oTQHU7mzZB9CaA3R2iwjDNz\nwwlDtT9tfo0tCC2ib9STfeM6AYrdI3wauzCu7AV4CFGSMP3HLX8DJuk8zzbdQHHv\n\nTo remove the password from a RSA private key, use the following command:\numask 077\nmv your.key old-with-pass.key\nopenssl rsa -in old-with-pass.key -out your.key\n\nThe umask 077 command is necessary to ensure that the new key is not created with overly relaxed permissions. Alternatively, you can manually change the mode of the file with chmod 400 new.key. Depending on the location of the key, you might have to prefix the openssl, mv and chmod commands with sudo.\n\nA: Answer on http://serverfault.com by @JamesSneeringer.\n\nI've been guilty of removing the passphrase from my own key files in\n  the past, because it's the simplest solution, but security-wise, it's\n  not the best idea. An alternative is to feed the passphrase to Apache.\n  You can do this with the SSLPassPhraseDialog option in your\n  httpd.conf (or another file that it includes).\nIf you only have one SSL site on your server, the simplest form of\n  this would be:\n# either of these will work\nSSLPassPhraseDialog |/path/to/passphrase-script\nSSLPassPhraseDialog exec:/path/to/passphrase-script\n\nYou would then create a very simple script called\n  /path/to/passphrase-script that contains something like the\n  following:\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"put the passphrase here\"\n\nWhen starting up, Apache will take the output of this script and use\n  it as the passphrase for your SSL key. If you have multiple SSL sites,\n  SSLPassPhraseDialog has additional ways in which it can be\n  used, so you can either have a single script for all of your keys, or\n  a separate script for each, or however you want to do it.\n\n", "Q: How To Install Cinnamon on Ubuntu I've read some things in some forums however they usually tell me to add a PPA third, to update and run the command apt to install the cinnamon, but it never works.

To find a solution, I have searched and read many posts about slow/intermittent wireless connections, and tried the suggestions with partial success. Now I have got it working but every time I reboot my system, the wireless speed goes down significantly. I can test this by the command iwconfig. So after each reboot I have to remove the driver and install it again to get my wireless speed back.

I was wondering if anybody can tell me why this is happening. What process gets in the way of wireless that after reboot it becomes so slow?!\n\nA: If your slowdown is heavily linked with reboots, you might want to see if there's a startup application that is hampering your wireless card. See if there's anything suspicious in \"Startup Applications\". (open from Dash)\nOr instead, run another OS on your computer and see if the same problem occurs. If not, then we'd know the issue is Ubuntu-specific, which would narrow down our scope of possible error sources.\nAlso have your computer scanned.

Ideally I would like:\nconnected to vpn: all traffic on my laptop goes through vpn\nnot connected to vpn: all traffic goes through my whatever network I'm on\nAny idea?\n\nA: To have both VPN and internet, traffic has to be forwarded out of the VPN server’s public network interface.

I've installed LAMP and I believe a DNS program and a mail server. Since my ISP is dynamic IP I am using noip.com's free dynamic DNS service (which I know works because the host name redirected to my router until I did port forwarding). The problem is that my server is accessible by using that host name however only on something connected to my network. (I tested it by turning my wifi off on my phone.)\nI think the problem might have something to do with my apache2 settings, because when I restart the server it gives me this message:\nRestarting web server apache2                                                \nAH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1. \nSet the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message.\n\nI've added this line: ServerName erikstagg.ddns.net to my apache2.conf file and that got rid of that message, but it didn't help with accessing my website from the web.\nI think that's all the information I can supply. I don't even know what to look up at this point.\nThanks in advance for the help!\n\nA: You need to look at the configuration of your internet router and figure out how to do \"Port Forwarding\".\nOutside requests - say for web pages - get to your router, it doesn't know what to do with them and just drops them. You need to tell it to forward the received requests - say to TCP port 80 - to the internal IP address of your actual server (and most likely the same port).\nYou also would want to make sure that your WLAN server has a static IP address within your local network.\nEDIT\nWhen I wrote WLAN server has a static IP address I meant the IP address of your server on the local network - i.e. 192.168.X.Y or 10.X.Y.Z. This address is normally handed over by the DHCP server built into your wireless router. You will need to get into the DHCP settings of your router, see what range of IP addresses it is handing over and configure a static internal one - on the same network - in your server.\nThen you need to use the same internal static address in your port forwarding.\n", "Q: unable install google earth in ubuntu 14.04 lts When i try to install google earth with gdebi or another software manager i' ve a dependency issue with ia32-libs.

There are a number of questions that address holding back packages with apt or dpkg to prevent upgrades when doing a normal 'apt-get upgrade'. Will any of these methods work across a release upgrade? I'm finally upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04, and there are some packages (e.g., MySQL server) that I'd like to prevent from being upgraded.\n\nA: Assuming such constraints were enforces by the upgrade manager, there's a good chance that you'll have broken dependencies and will have to hold back other packages to avoid the broken dependencies. If any of those other packages are critical/core packages, the upgrade manager will refuse to continue.\nIn the case of MySQL, this might be less likely based on the dependencies and reverse-dependencies of the mysql-server-5.5 package in Trusty.\n", "Q: Should I enable my Mobo Raid controller or leave it at AHCI?

What do I have to configure in order to allow local, networkless, resolution?\nI was trying to develop without having internet connection and could not hit my local servers using local /etc/hosts domain resolution to local (loopback) ip address.\n\nA: It looks like your resolv.conf settings are causing your hosts file to ignored. \nRecent ubuntu's have used resolveconf to manage resolv.conf because its better at working out scenarios where there are multiple connections.\nGeneral resolvconf documentation\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/resolvconf.8.html\nUse the technique in the accepted answer here to regenerate your resolv.conf settings \nHow do I get resolvconf to regenerate resolv.conf after I change /etc/network/interfaces?\n\nA: There is another thing to look at - /etc/nsswitch.conf. You can specify the priority of hostname lookups. I have in my nsswitch.conf file the following line:\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\n\nThis is how to interpret it:\nThe hosts: line specifies the order in which various name resolution services will be tried. The default is to:\n\n*\n\n*Begin by checking the /etc/hosts file. If that file provides an IP address for the host name in question, it is used.\n\n\n*Otherwise try mdns4_minimal, which will attempt to resolve the name via multicast DNS only if it ends with .local. If it does but no such mDNS host is located, mdns4_minimal will return NOTFOUND. The default name service switch response to NOTFOUND would be to try the next listed service, but the [NOTFOUND=return] entry overrides that and stops the search with the name unresolved.\n\n\n*Then try the specified DNS servers. This will happen more-or-less immediately if the name does not end in .local, or not at all if it does. If you remove the [NOTFOUND=return] entry, nsswitch would try to locate unresolved .local hosts via unicast DNS. This would generally be a bad thing , as it would send many such requests to Internet DNS servers that would never resolve them. Apparently, that happens a lot.\n\n\n*The final mdns4 entry indicates mDNS will be tried for names that don't end in .local if your specified DNS servers aren't able to resolve them. I thought this was meant to catch mDNS hosts when you don't specifiy the .local TLD, but I just tried it and it doesn't work. Guess I will look into it.\nSource: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=971693\nBy changing order in this line you can change the order of how hostnames are resolved. That might explain the fact that localhost cannot be resolved.\n\nA: You have to edit the /etc/apache2/apache2.conf file and add your domains in the global configuration section. \n\nA: Your apache configuration looks okay. And these will work just fine as a fallback if you have an internet connection. \nBut what you're missing is a local dns resolver, which can transfer your request to a local server, rather than making it resolve at the global internet dns. There is a mini dns server for that called DNSMASQ.\nYou can configure it to resolve all the .dev domains to your loopback address without consulting with the internet's dns server. \nsudo apt-get install dnsmasq\n\nYou can find the necessary configuration by looking at its docs. \nYou have an another option to make it happen via a PAC file. Though I suggest you to stick with dnsmasq as it is much popular and easier to get this done.\n", "Q: unable to retrieve files from u1 fie system just been reminded too recover my files from the u1 cloud service. when i follow all instructions given on the installation faqs i get this line \nbash: ./u1_downloader: cannot execute binary files: Exec format error\ncan some one please help\n\nA: Perhaps you're trying to run the 64-bit version on a 32-bit computer.

We just installed 32 bit version of Ubuntu 14.04 on our old Dell Dimensions 2400. Everything seemed to load ok but Ubuntu is super slow. Several of the different threads I've read about this focus on the graphics card and/or its drivers.\nDepending on how I go to read the system settings, either through the launcher or through the session indicator, I get different info. about the graphics card. Through the launcher I get i845Gx86/MMX/SSE2 which is what is actually installed. When I go through the session indicator I get Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe(LLVM 3.4, 128bits) instead. Is this a problem and if so, is it what's making Ubuntu run so slowly?\nSystem info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Memory: 2.0GiB\n\n*Processor: Pentium 4 2.8 GHz\n\n\nA: Because there is no hardware driver support for running the Unity desktop with GPU-acceleration. That's why it uses llvmpipe to still be able to display Unity. Other desktop environments might run faster, but these machines are over 10 years old, you should replace them if possbile.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 - no internet after wakeup, wifi/lan connected, but reaching only local network I have a strange problem on Toshiba Satellite NB and Ubuntu 12.04 on it. This system is working flawlessly a couple of months now already, but since last week I am getting a strange problem. \nI put my NB to sleep/hibernate > Wake up > Wifi/LAN connects to network again > IP is assigned > no internet.\nAfter wakeup I can ping only local IPs like the gateway IP 192.168.1.1 or other PCs in my local network, but I can't ping servers like 8.8.8.8 or other public IPs. The only solution is to reboot the system. Afterwards internet works. With the same IP assigned.\nOne week ago it worked, I am sure. I suspect some latest updates which I did install on wednesday 16.7. I didn't do any dramatic software changes in the recent days. How can I list all the recent updates I have installed? Can I roll back to test the \"last working state\"?\nAs for the investigation I have done a bit x-testing with following results:\n\n\n*\n\n*disabled networking before putting to sleep and enabling after wakeup > same thing\n\n*connecting to either a WiFi or LAN cable > same on both\n\n*just disabling networking without sleep > enabling networking > same thing\n\n*sudo service networking restart > same as No. 3\n\n*made custom script in /etc/pm/sleep.d/ with different commands to stop networking on sleep|hibernate and start upon wakeup > same as 3.\n\n*sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi > then modprobe iwlwifi > same\n\n*boot into windows 7 on 2nd partition > connect to wifi > sleep > wake > internet works\n\n*compared ifconfig before and after sleep > same\n\n\nIt is ridiculous, that local lan works. If a networking kernel module would be \"dead\" i wouldn't ping anything, or I wouldn't connect to a network at all, or not? On Windows I would try to do something like\nipconfig -release / -renew / -flushdns\n\nIs there any similar function in Ubuntu ?\nThere is definitely something to restart to get it working, because a complete system restart helps, but I wasn't able to identify what. Maybe somebody could help?\nI fount another thread on askubuntu with exact the same questions, but nobody answered..\nWhat's weird, it's a Satellite there as well.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/454370/12-04-wireless-is-connected-but-is-not-functional-after-suspend\n\nA: I should feel bad..\nAfter digging into another similar threads I found an advise to try traceroute. This is where I found my problem. After a fresh reboot i did traceroute google.com and I clearly recognized the first IP after my GW as that of my home's ISP (i am abroad now) and I quickly found out, that I am \"auto\"connected to my VPN, which I have set up a week ago. whatsmyip.org proved it.\nAs for the fact, that OpenVPN autoconnects every entry found in /etc/openvpn/xyz.conf I was very supprised, because I have configured it via network-manager and the checkbox \"Autoconnect\" there is UN-CHECKED!\nBut /etc/default/openvpn says different.\n# Start only these VPNs automatically via init script.\n# Allowed values are \"all\", \"none\" or space separated list of\n# names of the VPNs. If empty, \"all\" is assumed.\n# The VPN name refers to the VPN configutation file name.\n# i.e. \"home\" would be /etc/openvpn/home.conf\n#\n#AUTOSTART=\"all\"\n#AUTOSTART=\"none\"\n#AUTOSTART=\"home office\"\n\n..argh.. There is definitely a possible point of confusion for other Ubuntu users in this config file vs. network-manager setting.\nOK. SOLUTION.\nuncomment\nAUTOSTART=\"none\"\n\nand reboot\nI assume that when a system is connected to vpn and put to sleep/hibernate it won't disconnect correctly and reconnect after resume. Instead the connection turns into an dead end. That is what caused \"no internet\" probably.\nNow SUSPEND and RESUME > internet works!\n\nA: You can try with this \nsudo systemctl restart network-manager.service\n\nIf works, you can add the script in \n/etc/systemd/system/wifi-resume.service\n\nas \n#/etc/systemd/system/wifi-resume.service\n#sudo systemctl enable wifi-resume.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Restart networkmanager at resume\nAfter=suspend.target\nAfter=hibernate.target\nAfter=hybrid-sleep.target\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/bin/systemctl restart network-manager.service\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=suspend.target\nWantedBy=hibernate.target\nWantedBy=hybrid-sleep.target\n\nThis works for me after update update ubuntu 16.04 LTS on March 17\n", "Q: Setting persistent readahead buffer other than in rc.local? My MongoDB servers need a custom readahead setting for the devices that contain the database files.  I've added the following to /etc/rc.local:\nblockdev --setra 32 /dev/md127\n\nThis works, but since /etc/rc.local is executed late in the boot process (specifically, after mongod starts), mongod complains about readahead being too high.  Is there another \"correct\" place to set this?\n\nA: Since this is specifically for the database, just set the readahead as part of the upstart script by adding the blockdev command to /etc/init/mongodb.conf - then you can be sure it is set before each start of the database (which avoids confusion if you are changing it elsewhere for some reason in the meantime). \n", "Q: Not able to install dropbox Ubuntu 12.04 My terminal emulator shows the following error while trying to install Dropbox.

The flash drive had NTFS file system so I thought there will be no problems. But at some point an error had occurred that I didn't noticed and after some time I removed the flash drive without seeing the error. Now the flash drive is unusable. In Windows I get a Drive is write protected error, so I tried with Ubuntu.\nI have run GParted as superuser, with the partition not mounted.\nThis is how GParted recognizes the drive: \n\nAnd in the Information tab it is said\nUnable to detect file system! Possible reasons are\n - The file system is damaged\n - The file system is unknown to GParted\n - There is no file system available (un-formatted)\n - The device entry /dev/sdd1 is missing\n\nUltimately, when I try to format (simply format, or delete partition then make a new partition), I get the following errors:\nInput/output error during write on /dev/sdd\nError fsyncing/closing /dev/sdd: Input/output error\n\nI tried using dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdd bs=512 count=1 to clear all data, then\nmkfs -t vfat /dev/sdd1 to format to FAT32, but this has no effect.

I used Photorec http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec and recovered my files and then re-formated the usb drive.  It works okay now and I got the files that I wanted.\n\nA: Go to Device -> Create Partition Table. If it asks you which type, use the default (MS-DOS). That will destroy the data on the USB drive.

It's not much older than the initial 3.0 release so I doubt there's much that relies on 3.0-only APIs.\nThe core Linux developers still maintain one 2.6 kernel (currently at 2.6.32.63) although in the .58 release notes it was said that the maintenance will slow down and will, one day, eventually stop.\n2.6.32.* is also still being built for Lucid (10.04 LTS). You can find the packages for this in the Kernel PPA but if you're reading this answer any significant time after it was posted, check the listings. You will need to manually download the packages for your architecture and install them.\nYou will also need to monitor 2.6 releases and upgrade under your own volition. Ubuntu won't automatically update these packages for you so you'll have to go back to the PPA.\nLucid support will in April 2015 so I expect these builds to end. After that your remaining options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download from kernel.org and compile it yourself, though I expect maintenance to tail off after Lucid dies.\n\n*Pay your hardware vendor to upgrade their driver for 3.* kernels.\n\n*Replace the hardware with a version that is still supported.\n\n*If the vendor doesn't exist any more and there isn't replacement hardware out there, you could probably pay somebody to port the driver.\n\n\nAnd you have to keep in mind that this might all come to nothing. There simply might be things in 12.04 that rely on 3.* features.\n\nIn terms of your auxiliary questions, yes it should be possible to install alongside older kernels and yes, that will result in being offered a choice at the Grub screen. That said the newest kernel will, by default, always be the first choice.\nYou could probably hardwire around that by editing the grub configuration.\n", "Q: How to refresh launcher icon application menu in ubuntu 12.04? After modifying a desktop file in /usr/share/applications, I need to refresh the launcher icon application menu so that my modification shows up.\nFor the sake of clarity, the menu that should get modified is the one that appears with a right click when the pointer is on an icon of the launcher (the big bar full of icon on the left side of the screen).\nBest answer would be a simple command line.\nI am not using ubuntu-2d and I don't want to logout/login. \nI'm aware of some partial solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*unity --replace reloads everything (window decoration, notification area, ...)\n\n*killall ubuntu-2d-launcher is ubuntu-2d only, but if a similar one-line command exists for unity, that would be a good solution.\n\n*logging out then logging back in works also, but I can't afford loosing all my session just to update the menu.\n\n*on ubuntu 14.04 I don't have this issue: any changes made to \"*.desktop\" files seems to be repercuted live.\n\n\nAny suggestions ? Is there a way thanks to ccsm ?\n\nA: The most elegant way is to \"restart\" the icon; to remove the icon from its position in the launcher and replace it on the same position. The script below does the job. It is in python2, since 12.04 does not come with python3 by default. However, it can be used in python3 as well, only change the shebang in that case. The script can also be useful (on later Ubuntu versions as well) to immediately apply a changed icon for example.\nYou can simply use it by calling the script, with the edited desktop file as an argument (see further below).\nNote: in 12.04, if a refreshed icon represents a running application, the application in question will crash, as described in this question, so if you use it, make sure the application is not running. In 14.04, the icon will simply not refresh in case of a running application.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\ndesktopfile = sys.argv[-1]\n\ndef read_currentlauncher():\n    # reads the current launcher contents\n    get_launcheritems = subprocess.Popen([\n        \"gsettings\", \"get\", \"com.canonical.Unity.Launcher\", \"favorites\"\n        ], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n    return get_launcheritems.communicate()[0].decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef set_launcher(llist):\n    # sets a defined unity launcher list\n    current_launcher = str(llist).replace(\", \", \",\")\n    subprocess.Popen([\n        \"gsettings\", \"set\", \"com.canonical.Unity.Launcher\", \"favorites\",\n        current_launcher,\n        ])\n\ndef refresh_icon(desktopfile):\n    current_launcher = read_currentlauncher()\n    current_launcher_temp = eval(current_launcher)\n    item = [item for item in current_launcher_temp if desktopfile in item][0]\n    index = current_launcher_temp.index(item)\n    current_launcher_temp.pop(index)\n    set_launcher(current_launcher_temp)\n    time.sleep(2)\n    set_launcher(current_launcher)\n\nrefresh_icon(desktopfile)\n\nHow to use it\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script above into an empty file and safe it as refresh.py\n\n*For convenience reasons, make it executable\n\n*Refresh the icon by the command:\n/path/to/script/refresh.py name_of_edited_desktopfile (e.g. 'firefox.desktop')\n\nIf you really want to make it smooth\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the script executable, remove the .py extension, save it in ~/bin. After log out/in, you can run it by the command:\nrefresh firefox.desktop (as an example)\n\n", "Q: How to combine multiple hard drives in ubuntu server?

I am a newbie on this subject, and I was told to connect to a VPN from my computer, which is running Kubuntu 13.10. I was also given the server to connect to (vpn.server_x.com:81), a user and its password. The last data I have is that this is a openconnect on Linux.\nI read several tutorials and I tried with vpnc, openvpn and pptp-linux, because I do not know which I have to use. I always get errors, and reading /var/log/syslog is not being very useful because I do not know if I am doing stupid things.\nFor example, at the beginning I supposed that I had to use vpnc, so I installed it and then created a new connection via the Network settings, but it asks me for Gateway, User name, User password, Group name and Group password. In gateway I wrote vpn.server_x.com:81, but I do not have enough data to fill in the rest.\nAm I creating the right VPN connection?\n\nA: I managed the solution, I did not have to install neither vpnc nor openvpn nor pptp.\nI had to install openconnect. Then, the process is similar to others, add the VPN in the connection editor but selecting openconnect instead of the other ones.

I was used to remove the battery of my laptop whenever I worked with my computer plugged to AC power and to load the battery with the computer switched off so as to save the lifetime of the battery.   But on modern laptops it is not possible to remove the battery. \nI recently purchased a Toshiba Satellite L50-B-18C laptop and installed Ubuntu 14.04 on it.  \nI would like to know if there is any battery management software to work with Ubuntu which allows to stop battery charging before it reaches its 100% capacity and to make it charge again before it reaches a threshold.

I have a desktop with Windows XP running on it. Now I want to set up a multi boot.\nI have two hard disk drives. One 60 GB with Windows XP (we call it A). The second drive has 500 GB (lets call this B) and just data on it.\nA has 3 partitions (plus bootsector), and B has 2 partitions.\nI want to install Ubuntu on the second partition (40 GB) of drive B. (The first partition I use for my (windows) data files). I have reserved a 2 GB partition on drive A for the Ubuntu Swap-file (and also an empty 12GB (FAT32) partition without a current purpose, but I thought it might be useful sometime perhaps).\nNow I have not started to install yet, because I have two problems. I can't boot from my DVD-drive, so it won't autorun the installation DVD. (Booting from another CD-ROM drive is possible). But I found a way around this by first running an IDE drive diagnostic. By accident I found, that after the diagnostic process, the PC does boot from the DVD drive.\nMy second (unsolved) problem -the reason why I'm posting my question here- is that I can't find the drive B in the setting of my bootsequence. It's just not showing! While in the  IDE drive diagnostic it does show, as well as in the running OS.\n[edit: not showing means: when I enter the boot setup (using F2 at startup), I can alter the boot sequence. But the only options shown are 1. Diskette Drive; 2. IDE CD-ROM device; 3. Hard Disk Drive C:. I wish to select my WDC-500GB-Hard-Drive here, but I don't know how].\nI've read that the drive that has Ubuntu on it, must be first in the bootsequence, in order for GRUB to make the desired multiboot selector thing.\nI see three options (but I not sure how and if possible):\n1. Find a way to get drive B to appear in the boot sequence setting menu (my prefference, but clueless on how to do it).\n2. Set Ubuntu on the drive B, but set GRUB on the drive A (can this be done?)\n3. Switch the drives A and B physically (I'm very affraid to lose data or functionality).\nCan someone help me out?\n\nA: Step 1: Backup\nBackup your data in your Windows and second hard drive to an external source, such as an external hard drive, USB drive, or DVD. This is very important. We will do things that cannot be changed back. If you make a mistake, your data will be gone forever.\nStep 2: Test and verify\nTest that your computer can run Ubuntu without any problems, and all the parts are recognized. To do this, boot from the Ubuntu DVD and choose the option Try without installing... This will boot Ubuntu directly from the DVD. It will run slowly, so give it some time to come up. Test that sound, wifi or wired Internet, etc. are all working correctly. \nVerify the drive names. Ubuntu uses a different naming convention. There is not C:\\ and D:\\ drives etc in Ubuntu. The two physical drives will probably be called /dev/hda and /dev/hdb (or /dev/sda and /dev/sdb). Verify that C:\\ is in /dev/hda or in /dev/hdb. To do this open gparted from Dash, the gray icon on top left bar. \nGparted will show /dev/hda initially. See if you can identify all the partitions, such as 'C:\\'. The partitions are numbered. For example, the first partition in /dev/hda is /dev/hda1. Write down the name of the partition you plan to use for Ubuntu. For example if /dev/hda is your drive A, then identify the new name of the partition you want to use for swap and write it down. Make sure you don't write down the name of the wrong partition. Choosing the wrong partition will result in data loss. If you have already formatted this partition in one of the Windows formats, this is a good time to delete the partition and make the space unallocated. Ubuntu will use a special format for Swap.\nWithin gparted, look at /dev/hdb next, by selecting it at the top right corner. Verify that this is your Drive B. Identify the partition you have created to install Ubuntu in and write its name down. It may be /dev/hdb1 or /dev/hdb2 etc. Make sure you don't write down the name of the wrong partition. Choosing the wrong partition will result in data loss. If you have already formatted this partition in one of the Windows formats, this is a good time to delete the partition and make the space unallocated. Ubuntu will use format ext4.\nStep 3: Install\nWhen you are ready to install Ubuntu, proceed with the Install Ubuntu icon.\nFollow the prompts will you come to the Installation Type page.\n \nSelect Something Else\nThe next page will be very similar to the Gparted  and show /dev/hda by default. If this is your Drive A, select the Unallocated Space you have identified for Swap and mark it to be used as Swap. Also make sure that Device for boot loader (GRUB) installation is /dev/hda (assuming that this is your Drive A). Do not install GRUB in any specific partition such as /dev/hda1.\nNow switch to /dev/hdb (your Drive B). Assign the Unallocated Space you had created before to be formatted ext4. Assign it a mount point of / from the drop down menu. Select format partition option.\nProceed through the installation and follow the instructions from Step 6 onward in the official Ubuntu page.\nSpecial Note on GRUB\nNormally I would put GRUB on the same drive as Ubuntu, /dev/hdb. Since in this case, you can't boot from the second drive, we put it in /dev/hda. \nKeeping GRUB in the same drive as Ubuntu keeps things simple, particularly for those who don't want to \"mess with\" the drive with Windows. Reinstalling Windows will overwrite GRUB in the MBR (Master Boot Record) of /dev/hda. Then you will have to put GRUB back there to boot Ubuntu again. See How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?) \nHope this helps\n", "Q: mariadb new install : Checking for corrupt, not cleanly closed and upgrade needing tables I installed mariadb-server.\nnever installed before mysql.\n/var/lib/mysql was empty.\n# apt-get install mariadb-server\n\nblah~blah~\n\n# service mysql restart\n* Stopping MariaDB database server mysqld                                                                                     [ OK ] \n* Starting MariaDB database server mysqld                                                                                     [ OK ] \n* Checking for corrupt, not cleanly closed and upgrade needing tables.\n\n* Checking for corrupt, not cleanly closed and upgrade needing tables. *\nthis is problem.\nI try rm -Rf /var/lib/mysql\nmysql_install_db\nmysql_upgrade -p\nI can't remove this corrupt message.\nhow can I?\nthank you.\n\nA: What are you panicking about?

I have apps on tomcat onto this address: tomcat.domain.com:8080/app1 ; tomcat.domain.com:8080/app2 and so on, even for jboss apps..\nWith reverse proxy I have this output: proxy.domain.com/app1 proxy.domain.com/app2 and so on, so I don't have to specify neither the port number not the belonging to a specified server.\nBut I would use subdomains in this way: app1.domain.com, app2.domain.com and so on.\nSo, my configuration of Nginx , the one that works and used just for reverse proxy is that (i will report the lines about tomcat only, for simplicity):\nupstream tomcat_server {\n\n    server tomcat.domain.com:8080;\n}\nserver {\n     listen 80;\n     location /app1 {\n                  proxy_pass http://tomcat_server;\n                  proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n                }\n    }\n\nFor subdomain configuration I modified the part about server definition like this:\nserver {\n     listen 80;\n     server_name app1.domain.com;\n     location / {\n                  proxy_pass http://tomcat_server/app1;\n                  proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n                }\n    }\n\nas suggested in some forums , but it doesn't work.\nI specify that, on the server that manage DNS app1.domain.com points to the proxy.domain.com server.\nI saw logs, but there wasn't any.\nWhat should I do?\nThanks\nLuciana\n\nA: You may want to check your DNS setup.\nI also use multiple subdomains which I create on the fly for various applications using web frameworks such as Python Django or Ruby on Rails.\nA typical example is at mydomain.com I may want to have myapp.mydomain.com where myapp is a framework served at my_server_IP:some_port.\nIn order to achieve such thing (many subdomains on the fly at the same OR different ports) I delegate the decision from the DNS to the Web server with a Wildcard DNS record see Wikipedia. As the name suggests, such record produces a catch all domain which can be easily managed from the web server with the use of virtual hosts - domain proxys, etc.\nAn A wildcard record at GoDaddy's DNS management tool looks like this:\nHost    Points To           TTL\n*    YOUR_SERVER_IP        1 Hour\nAnd an Nginx configuration file which passes all requests for app.mydomain.com to otherserver.com:9000/index.html\nThe result: you type in browser http://app.mydomain.com and Nginx serves content from otherserver.com:9000/index.html which can be another server or application, etc\nserver {\n    listen   80;\n\n    server_name app.mydomain.com www.app.mydomain.com;\n\n    access_log  /var/log/nginx/app_mydomain_com_access.log;\n    error_log   /var/log/nginx/pp_mydomain_com_error.log;\n\n    error_page 404 /404.html;\n\n    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://otherserver.com:9000/index.html;\n    }\n\n}\n\n\nA: DNS were all rights, I was doing some trial in local domain before putting them on production.. I solved the issue more easier (I don't have index.html or any other files, I have only folder name).. Finally, I think this would be helpful for someone, the configuration is:\nupstream tomcat_server {\n    server tomcat.domain.com:8080;\n}\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name app1.domain.com;\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://tomcat_server/app1/;\n        sub_filter /app1/  /;\n    }\n}\n\nThe \" /\" at the end of proxy_pass is necessary ... \nsub_filter is needed to avoid that the result would be something like\n   app1.domain.com/app1\n\nThat's all..

Now my menus are completely messed up, so I want FF28 back and I'm not interested in opinions how newer versions are better (there are plenty of those in Mozilla support forums instead of actual answers).\nAlso, downloading firefox-mozilla-build_28.0-0ubuntu1_i386.deb and trying to use it apparently doesn't work, Ubuntu software center says:\nBreaks existing package 'firefox' that conflict: 'firefox'.\n\nA: Run\napt-cache show firefox | grep Version\n\nto get a list of available Firefox versions.

So in essence, after installing vnstat packet, you should start to see metrics 5 minutes later.\nAppears to sometimes be a problem with the install package however. It sometimes seems to create /var/lib/vnstat directory in such a way that it isn't writable by user vnstat so vnstat program only works when run as root (the daemon runs as user vnstat).\nYou can check if this is your problem by running this:\nll /var/lib | grep vnstat\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root        root        4096 Oct 25  2014 vnstat\n\nIf it is owned by root (as it is in this example), then that may be your problem.

To create the database you can use the update switch, which create new database in the base of no database. Create DB: sudo vnstat -i eth0  -u where eth0 is the name of the network interface.  If you are unsure update for all interfaces by sudo vnstat -u. After sometime (1  minute) you can view the details vnstat -i eth0 or simply vnstat .  \nUpdate\nIt seems vnstat not running ! .

A user can trivially circumvent this by copying the\n   desired command to a different name and then executing that.  For\n   example:\n\n       bill        ALL = ALL, !SU, !SHELLS\n\n   Doesn’t really prevent bill from running the commands listed in SU or\n   SHELLS since he can simply copy those commands to a different name, or\n   use a shell escape from an editor or other program.  Therefore, these\n   kind of restrictions should be considered advisory at best (and\n   reinforced by policy).\n\nThis is why your sudoers policy doesn't work.\nIf you would like to prevent user to gain root permission and change its password, try this procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Assuming your sudoers contains this directive:\n root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n\n*Assuming your user name is foo, his groups are foo and sudo. groups command output is:\nfoo sudo\n\n\n*Remove user foo from sudo group: gpasswd -d foo sudo after this, user foo can not run any command with sudo.\n\n*Edit sudoers file. Use this command:\nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/foo\n\n\n*Define user foo permission, for example:\nfoo ALL=/usr/bin, !/usr/bin/passwd, !/usr/bin/su\n\nThis means that user foo may run any commands in the directory /usr/bin/ except passwd and su command.\nNote: If the user foo wants to change his password, can run passwd command without sudo.\n\n*Another example of user foo permission:\nfoo ALL =/usr/bin, /usr/bin/passwd [A-Za-z]*, !/usr/bin/passwd root\n\nThis means that user foo may run any commands in the directory /usr/bin/ and is allowed to change anyone’s password except for root on ALL machines.\nYou can define groups of command by define Cmnd_Aliases and create \"levels of permissions\".

The juju-gui is designed to be deployed on the bootstrap node without issue so you don't need new machines for the GUI.\n", "Q: How can I make it so I can run a specific program, just by typing its name in the console? I have just recently installed Light Table downloading it from the git repository, and followed the instructions on this website to create a desktop launcher. \nNow I want to run the program by directly typing in the terminal\nLightTable\n\nand not\n./opt/LightTable/deploy/LightTable\n\n\nA: This isn't an elementary question, the best way to do this is to make an alias, Ill use netbeans as an example\nOpen Terminal Ctrl+Alt+T\nnano ~/.bashrc\n\nwrite this at the bottom of the file:\nalias netbeans='/home/john/netbeans-7.0.1/bin/netbeans'\n\nCtrl + x\n\nY\n\nEnter\n\nThe netbeans word is the command you will use to start the program, you can change it to whatever you need. Inside the quotes is the command you want to run when netbeans alias is called.\nIn order this command to be active you have to re-open the Terminal\n\nA: You can try to copy the executable to /usr/bin if its a simple executable program and doesn't depend on any other file. if it does depend of other files, the best to do is create a shortcut command to the program.\nWhere you create the alias is by yourself (.bashrc, .profile, etc). However I personally let all my enviroment variables in my .bash_aliases file (you need to create it at first stance).\nCreate the file .bash_aliases in your HOME folder and edit it anyway you like.\nThen to create the shortcut, you can do:\nalias LightTable='path_to_opt/LightTable/deploy/LightTable'\n\nSave the file and that's it. \nps: you can also put the alias as lighttable and LIGHTTABLE in case forget to uppercase the L or if capslock is active by accident, so you don't have to type the command again. \n\nA: I'm not sure why other answerers have not suggested this, but as the OP actually pointed out, prepending to the $PATH variable would have been the way I would have achieved this:\necho 'PATH=/opt/LightTable/deploy:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nThen run with:\nLightTable\n\n\nA: This can be crudely accomplished with an alias. You can create a permanent bash alias by adding a single line to your .bashrc file.\nIn the terminal run nano ~/.bashrc\nAdd the the following line at the bottom:\nalias LightTable='/full/path/opt/LightTable/deploy/LightTable'\n\nnotice I added thee full path instead of the . so this will work in any working directory. Close and reopen the terminal or run source ~/.bashrc to reload the bashrc file.\n\nA: Better to create a symbolic link than an alias I think. An alias might make substitutions on your command line when you didn't want one; creating a symlink will allow you to run the program as you want:\nsudo ln -s full_path_to_opt/LightTable/deploy/LightTable  /usr/local/bin\n\nThis will create a shortcut in /usr/local/bin (which should be in your PATH already!) to where LightTable actually is. Note also that you can rename the symlink as well if you don't like the capital letters in \"LightTable\":\nsudo ln -s full_path_to_opt/LightTable/deploy/LightTable  /usr/local/bin/lighttable\n\nJust for reference, if the program is awkwardly designed, i.e. complains about not finding configuration files or libraries or whatever, then another solution that might be more useful is creating a wrapper script. To do this just create a file (wherever you like for the time being) called \"LightTable\" (or whatever else you like) with this in it:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Simple script to run LightTable\nif ! cd full_path_to_opt/LightTable/deploy/LightTable ; then\n    echo \"$0: error: LightTable directory not found.\" >&2\n    exit 1\nfi\nexec ./LightTable\n\nChange the permissions of this file:\nchmod 755 <wrapper_script>\n\nand try executing it just to see if it works, and if so then move it to /usr/local/bin:\nsudo mv -i <wrapper_script> /usr/local/bin\n\n\nA: I tried to do this , when I started in Ubuntu. When you put LightTable in terminal\nIt searches for a file named LightTable in $PATH directories. you can put echo $PATH to get the directories.\nIf you want to execute your LightTable program in ./opt/LightTable/deploy/LightTable, then what you have to do is,\nplace your Light Table file in /usr/games or /usr/bin. But that requires Super User Permissions\nopen the terminal by Ctrl+Alt+T\nthen put\nI prefer to create a shortcut of LightTable using\nsudo ln -s path/to/LightTable  /usr/games/LightTable\n\nThen put the SU password. Then, you can access your program by using LightTable in the terminal\nYou can put /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin instead of /usr/games, anything that is a $PATH directory,  It doesn't need to be like that, but I recommend you to place it in /usr/local/bin\nI also recommend you to change the output file as lightpath instead of LightPath\n", "Q: VirtualBox: USB Sticks not recognized (Windows XP as guest; Ubuntu 14.04 as host) I have installed virtualbox on ubuntu 14.04 and installed windows xp as a guest.\ni have a usb stick and an external drive (western digital) that i want to mount in win xp. the mounting itself works, but windows xp displays: \"USB device not recognized\" and of course i cannot access it.\nhere is what I have already done:\n\n\n*\n\n*(got windows xp updates) \n\n*installed guest additions\n\n*installed the extension pack\n\n*added user to virtualbox group\n\n*enabled usb controller + usb 2.0 (EHCI) controller\n\n*added filters for both, my usb stick and my wd extenal harddrive\n\n*set it to use only 1 cpu (settings -> system -> processor)\n\n\nA: Had the same problem\n- I tried to uncheck the entire usb (1.1 and 2.0) before starting the guest.\nThen XP recognized the usb \n\n\n*\n\n*When XP booted and completed USB Driver install, you have to put the usb device through by selecting it in the  \"devices\" tab in the machine menu which can be integrated when in the C View mode or center-down when Full view.\n\n\nA: (I can't seem to add a comment to the previous answer.)\nI believe that turning off both EHCI and USB will actually automatically turn USB back on, but not EHCI.  I noticed that if I simply turn off EHCI, then it works with MSWin XP.  I haven't yet checked to see what kind of performance hit that may cause.\nMy guess is that the VirtualBox USB EHCI emulation changed and is no longer supported by the XP USB driver.\nEdit:\nI'm running VirtualBox 4.3.10, but extensions 4.3.14.  I downgraded the extensions to 4.3.10, and now EHCI works.  I did not try version 4.3.12 of the extensions.\nTo find the old extensions in my web browser, I used the normal download link, but removed the last two path components, then followed 4.3.10 instead of 4.3.14.  In other words, browse to http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.10/ and download from there.\n", "Q: LAPTOP battery draining faster without overheating issue I have a hp laptop with an AMD graphics card and I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 alongside my window 8.1. Under Ubuntu the laptop is quiet silent and smooth (no overheating) but the battery is draining very fast.\nIt only last for one hour max.\nIn windows it lasts for ~2.5 hours.\n\nA: You can use powertop (sudo powertop) to see your biggest energy consumers, and to check (under \"Tunables\") if laptop-mode-tools/TLP are working properly - most parameters are supposed to switch to \"Good\" once the laptop is unplugged. \nSome minor parameters (like VM writeback timeout, swappiness etc.) which are not auto-adjusted can be adjusted manually. Google will help you to find out how.\nHowever, if your laptop has AMD/Nvidia graphics, power drainage is probably caused by the opensource X graphic driver. In which case, as much as we all like opensource, you have no option but to install proprietary video drivers (fglrx/bumblebee respectively). You will easily find the how-to's on the web.\n\nA: There are various tweaks that you can apply to your laptop to save battery power, but many of them depend on the hardware, Linux distribution, some are outdated or too hard to apply for regular users and so on. TLP is an advanced power management command line tool for Linux that tries to apply these settings / tweaks for you automatically, depending on your Linux distribution and hardware.\nFor more info on the same, you may refer TLP page.\nHope that will help.\n\nA: I will usually edit my /etc/fstab file to include \"noatime\" on my partitions. This will disable the recording of last access time on files/folders, so less writes to your HDD/SSD and thus less battery used. I also found using an SSD will get you some extra battery time due to the lack of physical moving parts within.\n", "Q: HDMI TV Issues with Acer V3-571 laptop Im a complete Linux novice. Iv installed Mint today on my laptop.

Guys am having a mysterious doubt in diff. b/w arping and arp. When my senior asked me i was speechless. Pls. help me am confused.\n\nA: The Address Resolution Protocol - arp is a protocol. Its operation is usually implicit in other network activities, transparent to users. Among other things the arp protocol maintains a table of IP-to-ethernet address mappings derived from its operation. There is a related command that's also named arp. Its focus is the table, and it is a tool whereby maintenance of the arp table can be done manually. \nAnother command of interest is arping. It is to explicitly trigger the arp protocol to action, emitting arp packets.\nSource and more about: \n\n\n*\n\n*exercising the \"arp\" and \"arping\" commands\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Address Resolution Protocol\n\n*arping\n", "Q: No desktop only blank screen I started my Laptop this morning and after login there is only a black screen.

I had a question regarding how Ubuntu processes DNS requests after doing some research (and after the mailing list and google have not provided definate answers.)\nI only have 2 ports open to outside traffic - both blocked in IP Tables and on my router - a non-standard SSH port is one of the main ones I use. Through this I am able to remotely access numerous services - Apache HTTPD, Tomcat, Stanbol, Monitorix, CUPS, etc etc etc. \nThe question I had here is inbound DNS is blocked and filtered out in my IP Tables configuration. For some reason, the outbound DNS requests my computer sends keeps increasing in a steady fashion - about a week ago my Inbound DNS was about 425 bytes/second, and right now it is around 700 bytes/second, and increasing.\nA screenshot of the Monitorix page I am observing this is below. I do not believe this to be a bug in Monitorix as it appears valid based off IP Tables and packets hitting rules for Monitorix in IP Tables. \n\nI was wondering if there is any logical reasoning for this to be occuring - as from what I have read Ubuntu does not do DNS caching, or maybe it does and I need to flush DNS cache or something.\n\nA: I fixed the problem by disabling DNSMasq using this guide\nEdit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf, for example\nsudoedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nand comment out the line\ndns=dnsmasq\n\nso it says\n#dns=dnsmasq\n\nSave and exit the file and restart NetworkManager\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n", "Q: Recover ext2 filesystem after reformat?

If I copy a certain vector or \"curve\" graphic or drawing from, say, GIMP to a blank page of Inkscape, then in the meanwhile, what information is stored in the clipboard?\n\nA: An image is nothing but a matrix, with each value representing the colour of a respective pixel. When you copy one image (or layer from GIMP, Photoshop, etc.), basically you are copying the matrix to your destination. That's what the clipboard stores.\nIn cases where you have more complex objects copied (eg real vectors, like the ones you can manipulate on Adobe Illustrator), they're still a matrix, but the operation is just applied on a determined member of the vector/matrix, and not on it's whole.\n\nA: Geo's answer is spot-on, but I wanted to add some clarifications... The clipboard store can hold all sorts of information...from raw binary data to (most commonly), user-readable text. It is up to the application to decide what data should be sent and received from the store and what this data means. One file manager (i.e. nautilus) preforms copy-paste operations of all files by scanning the clipboard store for \"file:///\" links, while another might preform the same copy action on files by reading the name and data of the selected file and putting it in the store-stack during a \"copy\" operation, and writing the name and data from the store to a new file during a \"paste\" operation. The same goes for image manipulation programs; one might store RGB matrix values of the selection on the clipboard while another image program might store it on the clipboard in a proprietary format, there may be standards, but it's all up to the application.\nEdit: I forgot to mention that most Graphical toolkits and even some display servers come with built-in clipboard handling functions that allow generic copy-paste functions to work on a programs various widgets (such as a text box or file upload box) that don't have these interfaces explicitly defined by the programmer.\n", "Q: Running a python script at startup I am trying to get a simple python code that I have to run in the background at startup, and stay running.\nThe best option that I have found so far is to use Upstart.

If some user (or daemon) fills the disk then a login couldn't be possible anymore. So even root couldn't login anymore to fix it. Therefore ext3 reserves an amount of 5% (default) of the filesystem for the root user to prevent it (it doesn't work if root fills the disk).\nAvailable space is now the total free space including the reserved space for root.\n    Free space is the free space that you as a user can fill :)\nIt is possible to change this with tune2fs (PLEASE consult the manpage before using this tool).\n\n\nI suspect this also true for ext4 filesystems.

They're Dells, so perhaps conveniently they report their service tag with dmidecode -s system-serial-number. We're thinking of using Clonezilla to easily deploy images across them all, but they each need to be set with a specific hostname and static IP address. So, combining the two seems straightforward using a lookup something like:\ndeclare -A tags\ntags=([\"HKX321K\"]=\"ws1name 10.32.54.10\"\n      [\"HBZ321G\"]=\"ws2name 10.32.54.11\"\n)\ntag=$(sudo dmidecode -s system-serial-number)\nread -a nameip <<< \"${tags[$tag]}\"\nwsname=${nameip[0]}\nwsip=${nameip[1]}\n\nsed or the like could then make a /etc/hosts, hostname, and network/interfaces files from some templates.  However, is modifying those files sufficient, and how do I execute the \"personalization\" script very early in boot before Ubuntu starts setting stuff up?\nIs my plan bad for another unforeseen reason; what hidden pitfalls might await?\n\nA: Yes, changing those files is sufficient. You can use the hostnamectl command to change the hostname easily. These changes need to be made only once. So you can make the changes via rc.local or something similar to run once, remove itself from whatever caused it to run at boot and then reboot one before going on to do other things.\nIf a reboot is too much extra work, you can try scheduling an Upstart job. An Upstart job which has a start on startup condition will run this as early as possible.

I like to use ubuntu by terminal but i know barely all its commands so how can I get them all\n\nA: In unix terminology, the short answer is that\n\n\n*\n\n*terminal = tty = text input/output environment\n\n*console = physical terminal\n\n\nConsole, terminal and tty are closely related. Originally, they meant a piece of equipment through which you could interact with a computer: in the early days of unix, that meant a teleprinter-style device resembling a typewriter, sometimes called a teletypewriter, or “tty” in shorthand. The name “terminal” came from the electronic point of view, and the name “console” from the furniture point of view. Very early in unix history, electronic keyboards and displays became the norm for terminals.\nIn unix terminology, a tty is a particular kind of device file which implements a number of additional commands (ioctls) beyond read and write. In its most common meaning, terminal is synonymous with tty. Some ttys are provided by the kernel on behalf of a hardware device, for example with the input coming from the keyboard and the output going to a text mode screen, or with the input and output transmitted over a serial line. Other ttys, sometimes called pseudo-ttys, are provided (through a thin kernel layer) by programs called terminal emulators, such as Xterm (running in the X Window System), Screen (which provides a layer of isolation between a program and another terminal), Ssh (which connects a terminal on one machine with programs on another machine), Expect (for scripting terminal interactions), etc.\nThe word terminal can also have a more traditional meaning of a device through which one interacts with a computer, typically with a keyboard and display. For example an X terminal is a kind of thin client, a special-purpose computer whose only purpose is to drive a keyboard, display, mouse and occasionally other human interaction peripherals, with the actual applications running on another, more powerful computer.\nA console is generally a terminal in the physical sense that is by some definition the primary terminal directly connected to a machine. The console appears to the operating system as a (kernel-implemented) tty. On some systems, such as Linux and FreeBSD, the console appears as several ttys (special key combinations switch between these ttys); just to confuse matters, the name given to each particular tty can be “console”, ”virtual console”, ”virtual terminal”, and other variations.\nSee also Why is a Virtual Terminal “virtual”, and what/why/where is the “real” Terminal?.\n============================================\nA terminal or a console is a piece of hardware, using which a user can interact with a host. Basically a keyboard coupled with a text screen.\nNowadays nearly all terminals and consoles represent \"virtual\" ones.\nThe file that represents a terminal is, traditionally, called a tty file. If you look under the \"/dev\" directory of a UNIX system, you'll find a lot of tty files connected to virtual consoles (e.g. tty1 on linux), virtual terminals (e.g. pts/0) or physically connected hardware (e.g. ttyS0 is the physical serial terminal, if any, attached on first serial port of the host).\nA console must be a piece of hardware physically connected to (or part of) the host. It has a special role in the system: it is the main point to access a system for maintenance and some special operation can be done only from a console (e.g. see single user mode). A terminal can be, and usually is, a remote piece of hardware.\nA terminal emulator is a program that emulates a physical terminal (e.g. xterm, gnome-terminal, minicom).\nSo when you look to a \"text window\" on your linux system (under X11) you are looking to: a terminal emulator, connected to a virtual terminal, identified by a tty file, inside which runs a shell.\nThanks to Gilles and Ankoz for their answers on this thread.\n", "Q: Installation of Heroku returns errors with json Like the title says, I've been trying to install Heroku.

When I type localhost or my IP address in the browser, it is displaying the Apache page. Instead of that page, I need to list the contents (folder/files) in /var/www directory. How do I configure it?\n\nA: The simplest way is to move the welcome page. Two things: \n\n\n*\n\n*Apache on Ubuntu 14.04 uses /var/www/html/ directory by default, so you can either start using that directory or change the Apache configuration to use /var/www. \n\n*The default page is /var/www/html/index.html. Rename it to something else, like /var/www/html/apache-welcome.html.\n\n\nA: According to Apache documentation:\n\nWhen a directory is requested, Apache may be configured to send a\n  particular file within that directory automatically. This is\n  configured with the DirectoryIndex directive. It can list one or more\n  files that Apache should search for in the directory, with the first\n  existing file being returned to the client. For example:\nDirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.php welcome.html\n\nIf request point to directory that doesn't have file form DirectoryIndex, Apache use mod_autoindex and can returns a list of directory contents. \nmod_autoindex can be enabled/disabled using Options directive. For example:\n   <Directory /var/www>\n      Options +Indexes\n   </Directory>\n\nallow Apache to return directory contents of /var/www if it doesn't contains DirectoryIndex file.\n\nTo prevent directory listings (for security purposes, for example),\n  you should remove the Indexes keyword from every Options directive in\n  your configuration file. Or to prevent them only for a single\n  directory, you can use:\n\n    <Directory /var/www/images>  \n        Options -Indexes \n    </Directory>\n\nSo, you should check your apache configuration file and choose which Options you want to use and on which directory.\n\nA: You have to delete all files that have an index in der name. For example index.html or index.php. Because the webserver looks for this files and when it finds some he displays the site instead of the folder.\nAnd I think in the newer versions of Apache the main site is in /var/www/html. So delete the file /var/www/html/index.html.\nI hope this helps..\n\nA: Often there is /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf file and override your configuration about index file to open .

I know what x-terminal-emulator is and does, but I don't understand why there isn't exist a special manual page for it instead to be redirected to the manual page of gnome-terminal. I would like to see a manual page explaining what x-terminal-emulator exactly does and in that page a reference to man gnome-terminal.\nIs this correct (if yes, then why, for example, the output of man dir doesn't return the output of man ls)? It is there a good motivation behind this fact?\n\nA: x-terminal-emulator is a virtual package. The terminal emulator is configured by Debian's alternative system.\nOn Ubuntu you can easily follow this symlink construction, e.g. for gnome-terminal:\n$ which x-terminal-emulator\n/usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator\n$ ls -lF /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator\n/usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator -> /etc/alternatives/x-terminal-emulator*\n$ ls -al /etc/alternatives/x-terminal-emulator\n/etc/alternatives/x-terminal-emulator -> /usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper*\n\nNow regarding the man pages, update-alternatives also links the man page of gnome-terminal to x-terminal-emulator as explained in the update-alternatives manual:\n\n   It is often useful for a number of alternatives to be synchronized,  so\n   that they are changed as a group; for example, when several versions of\n   the  vi(1)  editor  are  installed,  the   man   page   referenced   by\n   /usr/share/man/man1/vi.1 should correspond to the executable referenced\n   by /usr/bin/vi.  update-alternatives handles this by  means  of  master\n   and  slave links; when the master is changed, any associated slaves are\n   changed too.  A master link and its associated slaves make  up  a  link\n   group.\n\n\nSource\n\nA: You could run in bash, to follow the link:\n$ readlink -f $(command -v x-terminal-emulator)\n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper\n\nand/or:\n$ update-alternatives --display x-terminal-emulator\nx-terminal-emulator - auto mode\n  link currently points to /usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper\n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper - priority 40\n  slave x-terminal-emulator.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/gnome-terminal.1.gz\n/usr/bin/lxterm - priority 30\n  slave x-terminal-emulator.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/lxterm.1.gz\n/usr/bin/uxterm - priority 20\n  slave x-terminal-emulator.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/uxterm.1.gz\n/usr/bin/xterm - priority 20\n  slave x-terminal-emulator.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/xterm.1.gz\nCurrent 'best' version is '/usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper'.\n\nNotice: the man page is also linked to gnome-terminal.1.gz.\n", "Q: vmware tools installation problem I just installed XUbuntu on my Vmware Workstation.\nAfter I saw, that I can't change display settings (resolution), I try to install VMware Tools.

The cause of your error is that Apache can't bind to port 80 because something else is already listening there.\nRun sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :80 and look for the name of the process that's listening on port 80.

I had also forwarded the port in my router so I could not understand how to solve the error.\nI know Nginx was not running so port 80 should have been fine except for chrome which I assume was also running on port 80\nSo in frustration not knowing what will happen I proceeded the command with sudo like this:\nsudo  /etc/init.d/apache2 start  \n\nand I got:\n * Starting Apache httpd web server apache2                                                                              \n *\n\nBy proceeding the start command with sudo, Apache2 has authority to run.

How do I delete selected text in the nano editor?\nI came across this issue while needing to delete the virtual host file and replace its content completely by other content. But the problem is that I can't select and delete the entire text at once. And if I delete it character by character, it won't be a computer thing. \n\nA: You can't select with mouse and delete text using nano editor. For faster delete you can use Ctrl + K to delete(cut) the present line of text. \nNote : Ctrl + K will cut the line of text. Using Ctrl + U you can paste it. \nEDIT: Additional Info from steeldriver\nYou can select and cut something other than the current line using Ctrl-^ to mark the start of the text, then advancing the cursor e.g. using Ctrl-F (forward one character) and/or Ctrl-Space (forward one word) and/or arrow keys, and then pressing Ctrl-K\n", "Q: how i can poweroff all the computers in lan from single computer I have 5 desktops, all running Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.\nAll are connecting to the Internet through the LAN (using a dlink switch), \ni want to shutdown all the computers from a single computer,is it possible ?\nif yes how it is possible ?\n\nA: If you can SSH into each computer —which I think is going to be a basic requirement for any answer here— you can ping off a dbus command to shut down each desktop machine. You might need to tweak permissions (also shown in that question and its answers).\nAll we need to do then is loop that for each computer. Here's an example.\nfor ip in 192.168.0.{10,15,52,62,12}; do ssh user@$ip 'dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit\" /org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Manager org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Manager.Stop' done\n\nUnless you've set up SSH-key authentication, you're going to have to provide a password for each iteration. Take my advice, set up key-based authentication.\nAnd finally just in case you don't understand the syntax, 192.168.0.{10,15,52,62,12} is a Bash expansion which will expand to:\n192.168.0.10\n192.168.0.15\n192.168.0.52\n192.168.0.62\n192.168.0.12\n\nYou could list full IPs if you wanted to instead.

I didn't test, of course, the Oculus Rift with this tool. But the program helped in cases when Ubuntu didn't allow achieving desired configuration by inbuilt stuff\nsudo apt-get install arandr\n", "Q: Why locate is faster than find? I was looking for a file in my source and tried both locate and find.\nSurprisingly locate was searching in entire machine and was faster than find, which was searching only in current directory and sub directories.  \nHere are my shell commands for both:\nfind . -name vendorsetup.sh # takes 50 seconds to search all files in curren -sub directories.\n\nlocate vendorsetup.sh # takes 20 seconds to search file in whole machine.\n\nWhy this?\n\nA: About Locate :\n\nLocate uses an index that stores  in /var/lib/slocate/, that is\n  updated by a nightly Cron job. This nightly job typically runs at\n  about 1AM  or 2AM of local time, and completely scans your entire system\n  (including all connected drives). The resulting index is simply a list\n  of filenames.Search will be so fast because of already indexing done to every element in filesystem\n\nBut find is not like so,\neverytime it will consider the search as fresh search and no storing of any cache of file location.\nso it will take time to find.\nhope that helps.\n\nA: locate uses a database and periodically does an inventory of your file system. The database is optimized for searching. find needs to traverse the whole subdirectory, which is pretty fast, but not as fast as locate.\n", "Q: Xubuntu - open whisker with Super button issue I set the Super button to open whisker menu.\nBut, for example when I press Super + F it also opens.\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: Sorry i am a bit late but you can go to xfce setting manager ->keyboard ->shortcuts\n\n\nA: First of all Whisker menu is a third party application not developed by XFCE team or Xubuntu. And coming to your issue, Whisker Menu doesn't have ability to bind shortcuts to \"Release\". That means when you try to initiate other shortcuts involving Super Key, then Whisker Menu also pops up. Hopefully developer of this menu integrates this ability. However there is a workaround though. Create shell script to launch both application and whisker menu. Then bind shortcuts to that script.\n\nA: You can try using https://github.com/hanschen/ksuperkey to solve this issue. The underlying problem is that keys are set on keypress rather than keyrelease. https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/libxfce4ui/-/issues/1\n", "Q: find mac address of all connected systems How can I find out how many system are connected to the local network and how can I get all IP and mac address of these systems.\nIs their any command/package to show the IP details?\nCan I use this command/package in our Firewall(IP Corp onLinux OS) to block unauthorized systems?  \n\nA: I don't know a way to actively scan a network for live systems, although I'm sure such tools exist.\nHowever if you just want to know what systems are connected and which MAC address they have I would just have a look at the list of active clients on your router/DHCP server.\nYou can then enable MAC filtering on your firewall and white list the MAC addresses that you want.\n\nA: There's a command called arp-scan that might do the trick for you, you will need to install it first:\nsudo apt-get install arp-scan\n\nHere's a link to the man pages that will outline how to use it: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/arp-scan.1.html\nAs an example though, you could do this:\nsudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet\n\nWhere eth0 is your local ethernet device. You can find out what yours is called via ifconfig\n", "Q: Disabling ++ shortcut I have recently disabled the Ubuntu shortcut for CtrlSuperDown using the Ubuntu Keyboard -> Shortcuts menu since I wanted to rebind the shortcut using the program, Autokey, to be a Page Down. However, even after disabling the shortcut I'm still getting strange behaviour for the binding. \nThe binding now does two things; it always performs Page Down as expected, but if the window has recently been moved then it restores it (the old binding for the key combination). Is there another place where this shortcuts could still be defined (I looked in compizconfig but I couldn't find anything)?  \n\nA: Yes, Ctrl+Super+↓ is a Compiz shortcut,:\nOpen ccsm → Grid plugin (Window Management category) → Binding tab → Restore.\n", "Q: Dual boot Windows stuck at logging off Recently I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my DELL Inspiron N4050 laptop, Windows 7 was already installed.\nFor some days, when I tried to open Windows 7 it was stuck at Logging off and now in the boot menu, I can see WINDOWS 7 and UBUNTU.\nBut I can start only Ubuntu but not Windows 7. How can I start or delete Windows7?\n\nA: It sounds like your Windows installation is crashed, though it might be salvageable.  This is probably not the correct forum for help fixing windows.  \nHowever, if the problem is somehow linked to the dual boot aspect you MIGHT find the boot repair utility helpful.  Please note, I've discovered the hard way to always use self booting media for running the boot repair utility.  The one and only time I ever tried installing the utility on an otherwise healthy Ubuntu installation, it trashed it.\n", "Q: Mounting the windows drives and external usb drives I am new to Ubuntu 14.04.\nI installed ubuntu on a windows laptop as the second OS.\nAs I am new user, I created two mounting points in /mnt/..  and /media..\nI tried to remove one, but I couldn't, it's confusing me while working.\nHow can I remove both mounting points and how to create new mounting points for external usb and windows drives?\nMy hard disk has three Windows partitions (C,D,E). On E, I took only some space of the available 100GB to install Ubuntu.\n\nA: The procedure is that you first unmount any disks that may still be mounted:\nsudo umount /mnt/... \n(that is not a typo, the command is umount)\nThen the directory /mnt/... is empty and can be removed: \nsudo rmdir /mnt/...\nThen you can make a new mount point elsewhere:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/newmountpoint\nand mount the disk there:\nsudo mount -t auto /dev/[devicename] /mnt/newmountpoint\nIf that works, you can edit /etc/fstab so the disk will be mounted at the next reboot.\n\nA: Here is an approach how to make Windows partitions auto mounted in Ubuntu. \nRun:\nsudo blkid\nYou will see UUIDs of your partitions, the next is just an example:\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"Recovery\" UUID=\"B23613F43613B875\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"Windows\" UUID=\"38CE9483CE943AD8\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda3: LABEL=\"Data\" UUID=\"519CB82E5888AD0F\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"00d7d951-2a35-40fd-8e5d-411bb824ff3b\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sda6: LABEL=\"Ubuntu\" UUID=\"6044b1d0-208e-4ab3-850d-03a92e1516fc\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nYou shall take a UUID from your output which is corresponding to the partition you are going to automount:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\nFor a general-purpose read-write mount, add this line to the end of /etc/fstab:\nUUID=519CB82E5888AD0F  /media/Data  ntfs-3g  defaults,windows_names,locale=en_US.utf8  0 0\n\nbut change UUID to yours.\n", "Q: error in bcache I used bcache to cache my 24GB SSD using this tutorial.

This is already deeply at odds with the tutorial. It's just not going to work like that.\nBut from its comments, somebody points out g2p which appears to claim to be able to convert existing sytems. I haven't used it so I honestly can't speak for it but seriously, make sure you've backed up before you do anything else. There does seem to be a very real risk here that you'll have to reinstall at some point.\n", "Q: File manager doesn't remember list preference On my Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine (on VMWare Player), I have set my preference in the file manager to \"View items as a list\" (click image to enlarge):\n\nBut every time if I start up my virtual machine and open my file manager, I get the grid and not the list.\nHow can I make sure that Ubuntu remembers my preference and always shows the list?\n\nA: Open the file manager go to preferences and set View new folders using to List View.\nThis will change the default view, which should stick after a reboot.\n", "Q: Upgrade from 12.10 to 14.04 directly from ubuntu or clean Install? I am currently using Ubuntu 12.10 i386. \nI was disappointed when I was unable to install any software, get updates,  or upgrade. \nIn another question here, I was told to install Ubuntu 14.04. And I am currently downloading the Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 via Transmission. \nI've used Windows for a long time and I know I can't upgrade from 32 bit to 64 bit.\nThe Ubuntu installation that I use now is 32 bit 12.10, so can I upgrade directly to Ubuntu 14.04 from 12.10 or do I have to clean install it?\nIf i can upgrade without losing files, can someone please tell me how?\n\nA: You have to do a clean install for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*As you have noted, 32-bit cannot be upgraded to 64-bit.\n\n*Ubuntu releases can be upgraded in two ways: from any release to the immediate next release, or from one LTS release to another. You can't jump from a normal release to an LTS release which came a couple of versions later.\n\n\nIf you have the free space, create a new partition and install.\nIf you don't have the free space, you have two options - do a step-by-step upgradation of 12.10 to 14.04 - from 12.10 to 13.04, from 13.04 to 13.10 and 13.10 to 14.04. This can be done - the question is, is the time and effort worth it?\nOn last way would be avoid formatting the partition when you are installing 14.04, which may let you save your home directory and a few other things.\n\nA: Quick Warning: I can't promise you that this will work, but this is how you are suppose to do it. Always make sure you backup before you do a fresh install just incase you lose your data.\nThe best thing to do is do a clean install. If you don't want to lose your data, this can be easily solved during the install stage when it asks you what installation type you want to carry out (found in step 4 here).\nSimply pick something else from the list, and click Continue.\nOn the next screen, you'll be presented with something like this:\n\nFrom your description you should only have one partition, so select that one and then click the Change button.\nChange the Use as: option to be the same type as your partition. So in my example this is ext4. And select the mount point to be /. Make sure the Format the partition: option is not ticked - this is how you will protect your /home directories/files/settings. You should have something like this:\n\nClick OK and then click Install Now. Then follow the rest of the install steps as usual.\n", "Q: Unable to remove domain name from 14.04 I have a domain called \"csez.testcorp.com\".

This is a good website to see. Basically you edit your .bashrc and at the end, put export PS1=THIS IS MY TERMINAL:. Obviously change THIS IS MY TERMINAL: to something you like (look at the page linked above). You terminal would look like this:\nTHIS IS MY TERMINAL:echo yes\nyes\nTHIS IS MY TERMINAL:echo no\nno\nTHIS IS MY TERMINAL:\n\nIf you are wanting to actually change your hostname, modify /etc/hosts and /etc/hostnames to your liking using a sudoed text editor.\n", "Q: Command pg_dump not found?

I do not think that it is possible with apt-get or aptitude.\n\nA: For 14.04 you can just install postgresql-client (as it depends on postgresql-client-common):\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-client\n\nTo quickly know which package contains a command/binary missing on your system, just use package.ubuntu.com (Search the contents of packages). \n\nA: For those of you who get the same issue with PostgreSQL 10, you don't need to install additional packages; pg_dump is already there in postgres's bin directory. So you just need to append that bin path (e.g. /opt/PostgreSQL/10/bin) manually to the PATH environment variable.\n", "Q: Cannot install any packages Whenever I try to install any new package, for instance:\n    sudo apt-get install gnome-system-monitor\n\nI get the same error:\nReading package lists...

There are several dedicated tag editors that work in Ubuntu.\nHowever, if you're specifically interested in album art, things are a bit different.  Banshee does not have the option to embed album art into the files themselves. Instead, Banshee saves album art in ~/cache/media-art, according to the Media Art Storage Spec.\nIt would be helpful to know what exactly you're trying to do, though. Generally the easiest way to organize covers in your media player is simply to edit the track in question and drag-and-drop your preferred album artwork onto the editor, replacing any existing cover.\n\nA: If you're looking to embed art directly into the id3 tag, you can use EasyTAG.\nInstallation is pretty easy.

The Common Name with my wild card in it is completely ignored. The Subject Alternative Name doesn't provide the alternative or additional names, it must provide ALL identifying names.\nThus put all the domain names including the wild card into the SAN.\n", "Q: How to perform a CPU/disk intensive operation without drastically affecting other processes? I am running a server on Ubuntu 12.04. The operation I'm trying to perform is a git clone, as part of a new backup system I'm implementing.

However, each time I attempt it, it locks up the server and kicks everyone off despite my best efforts to limit the impact on resource usage.\nHere's the command which I was sure would work: \nnice -n 19 ionice -c 3 git clone bukkit backup\n\nFrom what I've read, this should give the process lowest CPU priority and \"idle only\" disk priority. However, it still has the same effect of locking up and timing out everyone connected to the Minecraft server. To be clear, the git repository is not in the active server folder, so there isn't any kind of file-access conflict.\nI can give details on hardware specs if necessary. Thanks.\n\nA: Mainly  we don't try to run the processes parallel, but we see at wich time the usage of the system is as small as possible\nSo at first you'll have to find the time, when no (or maybe only a few ) are on your server, e.g monday at 2 o'clock.\nTo run the command a single time in future you use the atd (at-daemon):\n$ at 0200 monday\n     /home/your_home/name_of_the_script.sh\n<Ctrl-D>\n\nfor more information read man at and man atd, be sure to exit the input using Ctrl+D\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your script is valid + executable!\n\n\nA: If you are running on an Amazon EC2 instance where you can only use 100% CPU for short instances of time (bursts) with an enforced average utilization (e.g. 20% of the virtual CPU), you should also limit the total CPU usage of your process with cpulimit.

How do I set up a global locale for the computer?\nI have recently installed Kubuntu 14.04LTS in english but since I am in Spain, I chose Spain as a country and then changed locale options so that I get all country specific configuration such as digit grouping, decimal separator, date format, etc. I also added the spanish language.\nNow all applications complain that locale is wrong. check-language-support tells me I'm using en_ES.UTF-8 as system's locale, and that locale is indeed wrong, there is no locale for english language in Spain.\nI tried using Kubuntu's country/region & language settings but it doesn't fix it. I tried using export LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 and export LC_ALL=en_GB.UTF-8 and then sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales and that caused check-language-support to say that I now have a correct configuration but if it is, it's only in that konsole session. This problem also prevents konsole from showing unicode characters and I cannot use dead keys or enter any 'international character' such as ñ or ç (those work on other applications such as Firefox, that I'm using to post this question).\nSo the question is: How do I set up a global locale for the computer?\nThis is not a bug report, I will probably reinstall my computer eventually if I can't fix it.

I've been studying how locales work and the different configuration sets between some distributions (Debian Based originally).\nI use Linux Mint as my primary system distribution and Debian as my system servers.\nDespite the fact Ubuntu is derived from Debian, the locale settings are slightly different.\n1) Verify which locales are installed and generated in your system:\nsudo locale -a\n\n2) remove undesired locales using the following command:\nsudo localedef --delete-from-archive <YOUR DESIRED LOCALE HERE>\n\nfor example:\nsudo localedef --delete-from-archive en_AG\n\nThe default configuration located in /etc/default/locale is overriden by the personal (local user only) settings generated by the System Language App. These settings are located in $HOME/.pam_environment ($HOME = The location of your home folder).\nEmpty this file and write the configurations you may need.\nMy .pam_environment file:\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_NUMERIC=pt_BR.UTF-8\nLC_TIME=pt_BR.UTF-8\nLC_MONETARY=pt_BR.UTF-8\nLC_PAPER=pt_BR.UTF-8\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=pt_BR.UTF-8\nLC_NAME=pt_BR.UTF-8\nLC_ADDRESS=pt_BR.UTF-8\nLC_TELEPHONE=pt_BR.UTF-8\nLC_MEASUREMENT=pt_BR.UTF-8\nLC_CTYPE=pt_BR.UTF-8\n\nThe LANG variable sets the non configured LC_* to the value set configured there. For example: \nIf the system makes a lookup for the LC_TIME variable, and it is not set, it will use the LANG value as default for that variable (LC_TIME in this case).\nMy .pam_environment basically says:\nset almost all variables to pt_BR.UTF-8 and the system language to english.\nI hope this information may be userful.\n\nA: Another solution is to alias English (Spain) to English (US):\necho en_ES.UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8 >> /etc/locale.aliases\n\nA: You will want to use the update-locale command. Visit that page on how to use it. You basically run it (with sudo) with arguments setting the locale how you wish it to be. This \"Modif[ies] global locale settings\" to your requirements.\nEdit 1: You may also look into locale-gen if the previous does not work for you.\n\nA: Like Freddy Vulto commented in his answer, this is a known bug reported here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kde-runtime/+bug/1322968\nPlease take a look at it that bug report if you need to fix it manually. It can be fixed calling ~/.kde/env/setlocale.sh (possibly after modifying), among other possible fixes.\n\nA: I managed to temporarily fix the issue by changing the system language from American English to British English as suggested above. I did it via the KDE System Settings > Locale > Languages dialog. Amusingly, it displayed an error message saying that replacing the current language was not permitted, but in practice it was since the new settings were applied when I hit the \"apply\" button, and restarted the machine.\n\nA: I had same problem in my system: Kubuntu 16.04 LTS (kernel:4.4.0-31-generic(x86_64)).\nBut I solved it in very simple way:\nin \"system settings\" under \"personalization\" tab, click on \"regional settings\". choose \"Formats\" from right menu. In the left check \"detailed settings\" and change every detail such as Numbers or Time to your desired language and region.\n(system settings > regional settings > formats > detailed settings)\nI know it is elementary but can be useful for someone.\n\nA: Guys guys why are you going crazy?? All you need is to go to Search bar or Unity Lens (if Ubuntu)  type \"Language\" you will find \"Country/Region & Language\" Application.\nIn the \"Country\" Tab Choose your desired locale language.\nIf you want to keep current locale and change some other options like date format, or imperial to metric measurements, just use the other tabs! :)\nThis is available in Ubuntu distro 14.04 LTS and later.\n", "Q: How to tell cron to find paths to tools? Is there a way to indicate to cron how/where to find (paths to)  tools such as python, nmap, php and so on?\nI ask this because when I schedule a job using crontab -e, I always need to specify the full path of python, nmap and whatever other tool I want to use.\n\nA: This is from man 5 crontab:\n\n   Several environment variables are set up automatically by  the  cron(8)\n   daemon.  SHELL is set to /bin/sh, and LOGNAME and HOME are set from the\n   /etc/passwd  line  of   the   crontab's   owner.   PATH   is   set   to\n   \"/usr/bin:/bin\".   HOME,  SHELL, and PATH may be overridden by settings\n   in the crontab; LOGNAME is the user that the job is running  from,  and\n   may not be changed.\n\n\nSo, PATH is set by cron to \"/usr/bin:/bin\". Now, to add more paths to the PATH to be used by cron, just edit the crontab file (using crontab -e command) and add, for example the following line somewhere at the beginning:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\nSee also this Q&A from StackOverflow: crontab PATH and USER.\n", "Q: Ralink rt3290 Bluetooth not working I was trying to install Ralink rt3290 bluetooth driver which I downloaded from http://s3.amazonaws.com/mtk.cfs/Downloads/linux/-2012_0508_RT3290_Linux_STA_v2.6.0.0.bz2\nWhen I run the make command I get the following error:-\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.13.0-32-generic'\nmake: * [LINUX] Error 2\nI have 64 bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installed.\n\nA: That does not have the bluetooth drivers yet, only the wireless drivers are working (Barely working.

There is also a question regarding this issue in Ralink RT 3290 Bluetooth Problem on Ubuntu 14.04\nUpdating Kernel\nYou can also (This is risky and can have a lot of issues) update to the 3.15 or 3.16 Kernel.

I don't have a thumb drive, and my computer doesn't have a CD drive, but I have an external hard drive.\nI already went through the instructions at Ubuntu's site and when I got to the restart and hit F12 part, it gave me weird error messages like No Texts!.  \nI decided to delete what I put on the hard drive and re-download it.\nThat time it actually brought up a screen asking if I wanted to try Ubuntu or install, or other options.\nBut when I selected Install Ubuntu it just gave me a black screen with a blinking underscore in the upper left.\nI'm assuming the problem must be the hard drive since I'm pretty sure I downloaded the right things and took all the right steps that would apply to a USB drive.\nSo since the only discrepancy is the fact that I'm using an external hard drive, that has to be the problem, right?\nIs there anything I need to do to my hard drive to make it work, maybe reformat it?\n\nA: If it is OK to overwrite the external drive, you can use several tools, that normally are used to work with USB pendrives, and make the external drive a live drive and it will be seen like it were a USB pendrive by the system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by backing up whatever data you want to keep from the external drive to another drive or to an internet cloud service.\n\n*In Ubuntu: mkusb-dus might notice that it is a hard disk drive (or SSD), and ask if you really want to install into that drive. After confirming things will work the same way as if it were a USB pendrive.\n\n\n\n*In Windows: After checking the md5sum you can clone the Ubuntu iso file with Win32 Disk Imager to the external drive.\nCheck and double-check, that you have selected the correct target drive. Otherwise you might overwrite valuable data. Format the external drive with a file system, that Windows can see, for example NTFS, FAT 32 or exFAT. Use the available tools in Windows to identify and select the correct drive. See the following picture,\n\nYou can also use Rufus. It can also find  a hard disk drive (or SSD), as illustrated with the following picture.\n\n\nA: Try making a bootable hard disk using pendrive linux. There is also other software that can do similar things. If your hard disk doesn't show up, try formatting to FAT32. Also, make sure that there is nothing else on the disk. Use this page for more help. If you do need to re-format, be careful. This can wipe everything on the disk.

My motherboard is Asus P5K. After downloading the drivers, I messed up the installation somehow (don't remember the details) and now I don't have sound at all!\nI'm new to Ubuntu and I don't have a clue how driver setup works. \nCan you tell me how to bring back the old drivers or how to install this driver? And the first driver worked perfectly, but I was curious about the new driver so I messed up :(\nP.S, Ubuntu 14.4\n\nA: If you installed the audio drivers, you most likely installed the ALSA package. When ALSA installs, it is set to \"global Mute\" and you have to open ALSA and take it off mute before your audio can be used. In a terminal type \nalsamixer\n\nif command not found, type \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install alsa-utils\n\nand then \nalsamixer\n\nand take it off mute. \n\nA: \nthe first driver worked perfectly, but I was curious about the new driver\n\nI don't see a new driver on the support page.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Description: Realtek ALC883 Audio Driver for Linux.\n  \n*File Size: 37.21 MBytes - update 2007/05/07\n  \n*Download from: http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/socket775/P5K/Audio_L.rar\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore from your last system backup.\n\n*Uninstall the old drivers from the ASUS site, e.g. run make uninstall where you ran make install in the instructions to install the drivers (have a look at the corresponding makefiles if uninstall fails), reinstall the corresponsing alsa packages from the repository and probably run update-initramfs -k all -u to be sure that there are no old drivers in the initramfs image.\n\n\nRemember:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\n*Have up to date backups. Verify them.\n\n*Be careful, especially when using root permissions.\n\n*\n\n*When installing software/drivers manually: read changelogs and release notes; verify version numbers, timestamps and hashes; read the installation instructions entirely before attempting to install.\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Use your brain!

Some type of transfer of drivers \n\nA: It is possible but it is not advisable. In order for this to work, both Ubuntu installs would have to have exactly the same kernel version, and same architecture (x86 32-bit or 64-bit). You would have to identify the installed .ko module files that are used by the driver, and any other scripts installed by the driver, and manually copy them across. Unless you are an expert you will probably spend more time figuring this out than just installing the driver properly. And you are likely to run in to problems updating - the kernel module packaging system (DKMS) automatically rebuilds modules when the kernel is updated. Unless your system is aware of the copied driver, it will not be rebuilt when your kernel is updated, and so will stop working.\n", "Q: Can I use Ubuntu or should I use a lower version like Xubuntu? I used to use Ubuntu Hardy on my old laptop. But haven't used it since then. My desktop is really old. It is Dell with Intel(R) Pentium(R) D CPU 2.66 GHz with 1.00gb Ram, 140gb hard-drive. Since Microsoft isn't supporting Windows XP anymore, which Ubuntu version can I use with these computer specs. Also, I need to be able to use some type of media library that is friendly with a iPod so I can sync my mom's playlists and so on.\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu on a similar laptop without any problems. I think you should give it a shot - if it turns out that for some reason it's not working properly/snappy, you can install another desktop environment alongside the one currently installed (which is Unity by default for Ubuntu). \nPackage names are postfixed with -desktop (e.g. xubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop). As for LXDE (Lubuntu), there is lxde package as well. You'd install them like normal packages (using sudo apt-get [package name]). After that you can choose which one you want to use at login screen. Keep in mind that LXDE should be the most lightweight, followed by XFCE (Xubuntu).\n--\nAs a side note *ubuntus aren't lower versions, they just ship with different desktop environment and utilities.\n\nA: I don't know, personally I've found XFCE to be the quickest and fastest on pentium based computers built for XP. Amazingly Ubuntu studio runs lightning fast and has all kinds of audio applications and photo editing software pre-installed. Ubuntustudio uses XFCE and the website is here. http://ubuntustudio.org/ I suggest at least checking it out. . You can download the live iso of each version and test each one out without installing to see wich one runs best and which one best fits your tastes.\n\nA: You could run Xubuntu or Lubuntu on that with ease.  Unity might not play nice as something that old likely does not have a good enough graphics card, forcing all rendering to the CPU.  Although you could probably use KDE with a bare minimum of effects.\n", "Q: Running Dropbox at startup Please excuse a simple question from a new Linux user.\nRunning Ubuntu 12.04 on a Dell Pentium(R) Dual-Core CPU E5800 @ 3.20GHz × 2.\nI installed Dropbox OK with the command:\n   cd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86\" | tar xzf -\n\nas suggested by the Dropbox web site, which worked fine.\nThen the Dropbox daemon was run with the command:\n  ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\n\nAgain this worked well, Dropbox runs in the background giving easy access to my cloud data.\nThe Problem\nHow can I automatically run the dropbox daemon when the session is restarted? Current workaround is to open a terminal and enter the command:\n  ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\n\nMany thanks\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem and solve it by installing dropbox following these instructions, but substituting nautilus-dropbox by dropbox.

On ebay there are some $100 hp and dell blade server units that I've seen in action in data center tours. My question is, would a single one with 32gb ram, 4 intel xeon 3ghz processors and NO graphics card be able to run ubuntu? And would ubuntu be able to actually use the entire system? I won't be using it for \"big data\" per se, but I am thinking of compiling my own custom android builds and building/compiling my own custom build of ubuntu (kind of just for the fun of it, maybe a little for the fact that I'll be able to show off computer prowess). Also, I want to know if a full desktop environment would even run right due to the lack of a graphics card. I might be able to get a graphics card, but if I can avoid it I will at all costs (except for if it exceeds the price of a card).\n\nA: It will run, but it is hard to install any os without a graphics card for use during the installation.\nIt can be done so long as you boot an ubuntu image with ssh-server installed.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/OverSSH\nIf you are not running X, IMO, it is pointless to run a desktop, just do a minimal install or perhaps a server install.\nYou can get a Linux compatible graphics card for cheap, certainly does not need to be the latest greatest of cards. Perhaps you could pull one from most any other box just for the install. \n\nA: Blade hardware is just a standard PC and should work out-of-the-box with Ubuntu, but the question here is really whether or not the onboard GPU has enough power to run Ubuntu.

Is this a deliberate change, or a bug?\n\nA: You probably have to turn off \"ubuntu integration\" go to settings, click addons, and select extensions and disable the integration and modification extensions like in this example:\n\ngo to your firefox settings, click preferences and change the homepage from there you can set it to \"Mozilla Firefox Start Page\" or select whatever you want.\n\n", "Q: Why does the login screen in 14.04 only change when I set a picture background, but not when I use a solid color? When I set a solid color as desktop background (like black), which I like far better, then the login screen shows the default purplish picture (warty-final-ubuntu.png). How to I make it also show a simple black screen?\nBtw, I educated myself about lightdm settings and access rights to pictures in /usr/share/backgrounds, so I specifically ask for an answer that does not involve any picture files, since I want a simple, single color, no gradient.\nIn response to first comment, I think I still need more specific knowledge about lightdm.\nFirst of all, im using Ubuntu 14.04 and the configuration files I am looking at are in this directory:\n/usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/\n\nIs it supposed to work in a way that all these files are always read, when lightdm starts (maybe in lexical order)?\nIs there something else I would have to look at?\nI specifically tried setting this: \nbackground='#000000'\n\nbut it had no effect whatsoever (still showing warty-final-ubuntu.png), that's why I came here.\nEdit:\n@kenn Actually, in my case that file does not exist.\nthomas@thomas-laptop:~$ ls /etc/lightdm/\nusers.conf\n\n\nA: The easiest way that I know of to change the background on the lightdm login screen is to use Ubuntu-Tweak. If you don't have it, install it from the software-center, or the terminal, by typing \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nOpen Ubuntu-Tweak and go to Tweaks>Login Settings. Click 'unlock' at the top of the window and enter your password, then click the icon for changing the login screen background. Select the picture you want and click 'open'. Of course, this selects an image from /usr/share/backgrounds.\nGo to the internet and find a black image and save it to /usr/share/backgrounds. Select that image from Ubuntu-Tweak. \nSaving to /usr/share/backgrounds will require you to save the image somewhere else first, and then copy it to there. Open the Terminal or press Alt+F2, and type \ngksudo nautilus \nand enter your password. This will open nautilus as root and allow you to navigate and copy to /usr/share/backgrounds.\nHope this is helpful.\n", "Q: How to fix empty folders in an NFS export?

So if you have an export /exp and mount some devices on /exp/mnt1, /exp/mnt2, etc., then each of those directories need to be exported, and mounted on the client. So your /etc/exports will look like:\n/data 192.168.2.0/24(rw,insecure,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=100)\n/data/video 192.168.2.0/24(rw,insecure,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=100)\n\nAnd you will have to add entries to the client /etc/fstab for both exports. \nThere's also a typo in your /etc/fstab, where /dev/sdc should be /dev/sdc1 (or whatever the partition actually is).

I just installed ubuntu 12.04 (it still has windows 7 on it but I can't access it I don't think) on my moms older and pretty beat up laptop. the thing has a few problems like needing the keyboard replaced because our bird picked off the arrow keys and a couple others they don't work anymore (which is why I don't think I can access the windows 7, but I'm ordering another keyboard) and the headphone jack is broken. It was dropped while headphones were plugged in and now it thinks theres head phones in all the time, even though if I plug some in it doesnt work because its broken inside.\nso can I disable the headphone jack? I tried looking up how to do it but i'm not getting anywhere. so ... what can I do?\nI also though I could just buy some usb speakers and plug those in and maybe that would work as a temporary thing? I dunno. I just need to do something about it.\n\nA: I haven't seen a way to change which device to use for sound output, but there is a way to make sound output through both speakers and headphones simultaneously. In command line (to open it press Ctrl + \nAlt + T) run alsamixer and then using arrow keys move all the way to Auto-Mute option, press arrow keys up or down to disable it. Then you can use other options to configure the master audio. And if it says MM below a vertical bar, it means that audio option is muted, which you can unmute using m key. Let me know if that helps\n\nOn the hardware side of things, there's another solution - USB. There's plenty of USB speakers, headphones, and sound cards. For instance,  I have Toshiba Satellite A215, which has a dead internal sound card and touchpad. The solution I came up with is USB sound card, which has two bays for speaker and microphone jacks, which I use with a set of old desktop speakers. Among other things, there are bluetooth dongles. So if you don't mind to skip a lunch and save up for a usb device like that, then it's the simplest \"repair\" possible\n", "Q: Overheating issue after installing 14.04 I'm new to the ubuntu and Linux thing. I recently downloaded and booted up ubuntu. I made the switch from Windows Vista to ubuntu, and I really like it. Unfortunately, I started getting an overheating issue. My laptop( HP Probook 4510s with 1Gb RAM Celeron processor) overheats until it shuts down. I won't even be using it, but as long as it's on it gets hot. I cleaned the fan out, but it's still overheating. Could you guys point me in the right direction to diagnose and correct the problem? I'm pretty new to the OS, so I may not know a lot of the things or where to actually look. Any help is appreciated!\n\nA: First, welcome to the new world of Ubuntu. There are a couple of reasons for your overheating issue. \nOne of the reasons is the over usage of CPU.\nRefer here for Solving the overheating of CPU\n\nThe Dual graphics problem issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify whether you have hybrid graphics in your laptop. (Something like Nvidia + Intel 4000) or (ATI + intel)\n\n*If you have nvidia + intel, see some open source projects Bumblebee or Nvidia-Prime. I suggest the Nvidia-Prime since it is newer and stable + many benefits (Try googling)\n\n*If you have ATI + Intel, I'm probably not sure (My laptop has nvidia + intel). But do take a look at Hybrid Graphics Section for ATI of ubuntu\nNote \nAlways do some research before you install new stuffs in Ubuntu as you are a newbie. Playing with graphics drivers and installing unsupported software may lead to breaking of Graphics which may lead you to re-install the entire OS again (It happened like 10 times in my case). \nHope this gives you idea for your Over heating issue. All the best.

I want this command to run automatically right after login in with startup application program. Please tell me how to.\n\nA: The sudo command expects you to enter your password via a command prompt. Use gksudo instead, and you will be shown a GUI prompt to type your password in. \nSo the command to add to your startup applications would be: \ngksu service network-manager restart\n\nYou might also want to delay that command from running right away, to give your desktop a chance to load:\nsleep 15s; gksu service network-manager restart\n\n\nA: Hi everyone thanks for trying to answer my question.

The easiest way to do this is to go to \"Settings\" and under \"System\" click on the \"Details\" icon.\nYou should see your CPU and GPU chipsets referenced here listed over on the right hand side of the window.\nIf you see something like \"Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe\" listed here and you are not using this chipset . . . you have found the problem and you need to install the proper drivers for your hardware.\nUbuntu and other like distros usually end up with the Gallium driver as a fallback when either the hardware is not properly detected or the proper drivers are not available, loaded, or installed. This usually causes all kinds of visual shuddering and display issues. \n", "Q: Can I Dual Boot Ubuntu from a Virtual CD drive? My Computer Sciences professor told me to dual boot Ubuntu on my computer, to get some experience with the Linux operating system. However, my DVD drive is broken and my BIOS will not boot from a USB drive. My professor is telling me that I can dual boot from a virtual CD drive, like Daemon Tools, but from all the research I have been doing I haven't seen anything stating that this can be done. Which would make sense since the Virtual CD drive would not be detected on boot up as it is run on the Windows OS.\nCan anyone confirm or deny this for me?\n\nA: This post says it's not possible, but it is very well possible to run Ubuntu with Virtual Box in a virtual machine. It's probably best to install i386 for performance reasons.\nDownload Virtual Box here:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads \nAfter starting Virtual Box, you can place the iso file in the virtual drive for the installation of the Ubuntu OS. After you are done installing, remove the iso before you reboot the virtual machine.\nYour Virtual machine connects to virtual ethernet regardless of if your host machine uses WiFi or not.\n", "Q: Computer becoming unresponsive when changing display I just had a weird issue come up today.  I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 on a Toshiba Satellite laptop with an external monitor.  Until today, everything was working fine, but I started having a problem.  Normally I boot up my computer, plug in the monitor, and hit Fn + F5 a bunch until I get the external-only display with native resolution (the resolution of my external monitor is much higher than my laptop's native resolution).  However, today, instead of migrating the display to the external monitor, instead, the external monitor went blank and I got an unresponsive command prompt on my laptop's main display (i.e. a black screen with the flashing white bar, but I can't type anything and none of the keys do anything).  I'm wondering how I can fix this and go back to using Fn + F5 to set up my display.\nI have done some debugging, and here's what I've found:\n1) When I go into Display Settings and manually switch the display to external monitor only, it works fine (in fact, that's how I'm writing this post).\n2) When I do not have my power cable plugged in, sometimes Fn + F5 will work as before and alternate the display properly, but sometimes it fails.\n3) I have tested multiple monitors, and experienced this problem in multiple settings.\nCan someone help me debug this issue?  Thanks.\n\nA: I have had similar problems in the past with my Toshiba Laptop which was resolved by installing the proprietary nVidia driver as my laptop had an nVidia GEForce graphic card.\n", "Q: Are all apt-get packages available on 64 bit ubuntu version available on the ARM version? I'm going to be traveling for 4 months and want to get a $200 chromebook and out Ubuntu server on it rather than risk loosing my macbook pro. \nI'm developer and use apt-get all the time, so wanted to know if all 32/64bit packages are made available for the ARM version or if only a subset. \nSome of the stuff I use often are Apache, node, mongodb, mysql, ruby, php etc.\n\nA: In the vast majority of cases any package would be available on ARM.\nOne of the requirements for a package to be accepted into a Debian release is that it has to compile on all of the Debian architectures, not just x86/x64.  This includes ARM.\nSo, this will pretty much guarantee that the vast majority of Ubuntu's packages will at least be able to be compiled on ARM.\nThat said, Ubuntu is not Debian and may have a slightly less strict policy regarding inclusion of package that fail to build on ARM.  While most of their code is inherited from Debian, an increasing amount of it is Ubuntu-specific.\nUbuntu devs do keep track of build failures per architecture, and this includes ARMHF and ARM64.\nThey also treat failure to build on ARM as a bug.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installer overwriting Windows 8 bootloader on disk to which it wasn't installed This all started when I went to install Ubuntu on a partition on my external HDD. In the Ubuntu LiveUSB's installer, the configuration was to create an ext4 partition in empty space on the external HDD (/dev/sdc3) and write the bootloader to /dev/sdc. The install completed nicely and I was able to boot fine into the new Ubuntu partition- with one catch.\nUpon restarting, I had been greeted with a complaint from Secure Boot (Secure Boot Violation - Invalid signature), which was odd, given that I had not told the installer to touch the original bootloader (or anything, for that matter) on /dev/sda. I got prompted with GRUB after dismissing the complaint, also strange seeing as I had not gotten to the point where I could choose the boot order. I rebooted without the external HDD to verify that it was on the main drive and not the external one, at which point GRUB gave me a terminal rather than a menu. Typing 'exit' brought me back into Windows 8.\nI've attempted to erase GRUB by booting into Windows in command prompt mode and using bootrec /fixmbr and bootrec /fixboot, but it had no effect and GRUB remains.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why did Ubuntu's installer decide to write GRUB to both /dev/sda and /dev/sdc when I specified /dev/sdc as the bootloader partition and /dev/sdc3 as the Ubuntu install partition?\n\n*How can I get rid of GRUB with something other than Windows in recovery mode?\n\n\nA: Please forget everything you ever knew about boot loader installation, at least with respect to the computer under discussion. You're trying to apply BIOS assumptions to an EFI (non-BIOS) computer, and they don't apply. (Yes, I know that most people, and even manufacturers, refer to EFIs as BIOSes, but that just causes confusion. See Adam Williamson's blog post on this subject for more details.) The Windows bootrec /fixmbr command is intended for dealing with BIOS-mode booting, and so is inapplicable to you. I don't know about bootrec /fixboot; it might or might not be useful on an EFI-based computer.\nUnder EFI, all boot loaders and related programs reside in the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a FAT partition whose purpose is to hold boot loaders and related files. Ordinarily, a computer will have just one ESP, although it is legal for a computer to have multiple ESPs. A two-disk computer might have one, two, three, or more ESPs. In the case of a multi-ESP computer, it's unclear which one the Ubuntu installer will use. In theory, the Ubuntu installer should use the one identified as the \"EFI boot partition\" (their own non-standard name for the ESP) in the installer; however, I have my doubts about whether Ubuntu does this consistently. (I haven't had the chance to look at this in depth.) In any event, the Ubuntu installer retains a BIOS-mode prompt for where to install the boot loader when installing in EFI mode, but it's completely useless! I think there's a bug report about that on Launchpad, but a quick search didn't turn it up.\nIn theory, then, an EFI-based computer can have dozens of boot loaders installed. Which one does the firmware actually use? This is determined by a set of NVRAM entries, which identify the boot loaders and list the order in which they should be tried. The NVRAM entries identify boot loaders by partition and filename.\nIt's unclear whether you've got one, two, or more ESPs; however, because the NVRAM entries identify boot loaders by partition and filename, that detail is essentially irrelevant. Chances are that what happened is that Ubuntu added GRUB to an ESP and added an entry to the computer's NVRAM telling it to use GRUB by default. (In fact, it would point to Shim, which is one of Linux's tools for dealing with Secure Boot. Shim will then launch GRUB.) I'm not sure why you're getting a Secure Boot warning followed by GRUB. Maybe you've got an NVRAM entry that points directly to GRUB without going through Shim followed by an entry that points to Shim. That would explain it, but AFAIK the Ubuntu installer doesn't set things up this way.\nUnder EFI, you can edit the NVRAM entries to control the boot order. In Linux, the efibootmgr utility does this job. In Windows, you can use bcdedit or a third-party tool like EasyUEFI. Using efibootmgr, type the command alone to see a list of boot entries, then use the -o option to set the boot order, as in efibootmgr -o 5,3,8 to have the firmware try Boot0005 first, then to launch Boot0003 if that fails, and finally to try Boot0008. (Of course, you'll need to set the order for your system, based on the output of efibootmgr without any options.) Most EFIs have their own boot manager to enable you to select a boot loader. Details vary greatly from one computer to another, though. You must typically press a function key early in the boot process to get to this boot manager.\n\nA: *\n\n*I think you would have to tell it to NOT install to /dev/sda as that's where it installs by default.\n\n*Using a Windows repair disk follow these instructions http://www.fixedbyvonnie.com/2013/12/how-to-repair-the-efi-bootloader-in-windows-8/ I believe you still need to recreate the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store to fix your issue (/fixmbr bootrec /fixboot is not enough).\n", "Q: Shell scripting add slashes in file name with space I am a newbee and want to write a shell script in which I will look up in a certain directory for zip file and unzip it to certain directory.\nFile name can have spaces like this \"Harry's 20 july.zip\"\nI am getting error when I am trying to unzip using below command:-\nunzip \"$source_file\" -P$password -d $destination_directory\n\nI already enclosed in double quotes but dont know how to add slashes in $source_file.\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: It was related to ordering of params.\nAs assisted by @Muru ordering should be\n unzip -P$password \"$source_file\" -d \"$destination_directory\"\n\nThanks.\n", "Q: Guest Wireless/Ubuntu 14.04 At work i have to connect to a guest wireless network.

What I did:  \n\n\n*\n\n*reinstalled Ubuntu 14.04        \n\n*run boot-repair  \n\n*create the EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi file on the EDI partition\n\n\nbut I still can't boot. \nHere is my boot-repair log.\n\nA: It looks like you installed Ubuntu 14.04 in BIOS mode, but your previous installation was in EFI mode. Your Boot Repair log is odd, so I suspect some other weirdness, too -- maybe you manually converted the disk from GPT to MBR form, for instance.\nIn any event, if you have no user data on the disk, or if you've got good backups of your user data, I recommend you start again, but this time, read a good guide on installing on an EFI-based system. (Sturgeon's law applies to guides to EFI-based installation, with a vengeance!) Two sites with good information are:\n\n\n*\n\n*My page on EFI-mode installations\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki on the subject\nYou could do a BIOS-mode installation, but I don't know of a good site that describes how to ensure that's what you're doing.\nIf you have user data that's not backed up and you don't want to do a backup-restore dance, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your user data. The odds of your losing it if you fail to do this are just too high.\n\n*Download and prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Launch gdisk on the disk. Change the type code of partition #1 to EF00 and then save your changes (via w).\n\n*Insert the rEFInd media in the computer and reboot to rEFInd. (You may need to use your firmware's built-in boot manager to select the rEFInd medium.)\n\n*Using rEFInd, boot Ubuntu. (There will probably be several Ubuntu or Linux options. Some might not work. Don't worry about that.)\n\n*In Ubuntu, type sudo mkdir /boot/efi && sudo mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi, then delete the /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft directory tree. Since you don't have a Windows installation, the presence of the Windows boot loader on your ESP (/dev/sda1) is pointless and will simply clutter your boot manager menu.\n\n*In Ubuntu, do one of two things:\n\n*\n\n*Re-install GRUB. The easiest way to do this is via Boot Repair, but you can use the grub-install command if you prefer.\n\n*Install the Debian-package version of rEFInd.\n\n\n\nThere are alternative ways to achieve the same results. For instance, your computer might boot to Ubuntu without rEFInd once you've converted the disk to GPT form, but that's not certain. You could also try doing it without an MBR-to-GPT conversion, although that's very unusual for an EFI installation and isn't guaranteed to work.\nIt's also probably possible to get the system booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, which is (mostly) how it's set up now; but your description provides no clue as to what it's actually doing, so it's hard to say what's wrong or how to fix it.\n\nA: Ubuntu works well now.\nHere is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable secure boot (didn't do it the first time)\n\n*Standard install (no customization) from live USB\n\n*Run boot repair + create dir /boot/efi/ and renamed grubx64.efi into bootx64.efi\n\n*At reboot, I got the grub but then fall into the initramfs prompt\n\n*I reboot and chose the recovery mode, check the system up and got into the session screen\n\n*I updated the system\n\n*At the next reboot, it tooks a long time but finaly launch the session screen.\n\n\nI didn't try to reboot for now...\n\nA: I realize that this is old but I landed as the result of a search.  Perhaps this will help someone else:\nMy solution to this problem (though I'm sure my repair logs may be different) was to burn my .iso to CD or USB with software that was not from Pendrive.  I gave LiLi USB installer a shot and it worked.\nThe moral of this story is that if you're stuck with this problem and don't know what to try next, try re-burning your boot .iso using software different than what was used initially.\n", "Q: How to boot back into Android from Ubuntu Touch?

It turns out that I could ping them, but I could not log into the PC.  This was for two reasons:\n1.) First was that I had not set static IPs for the PCs in the office workplace.  So each time the office PC was rebooted, it was assigned a new IP address.  Once this was fixed I could at least make sure that the PC I was trying to sign into was indeed the correct PC\n2.)

Nothing happened.\nOkay, I decided to boot the internal HDD from the notebook. Then a purple window from Ubuntu appeared asking if I wanna start Ubuntu or Windows Vista.\nI choose Ubuntu and it worked. After that I did the same and chose Windows. It worked as well.\nBUT now I can't boot the internal HDD without having the external HDD connected to the notebook. It says something like error grub rescue. That is problem one.  \nProblem two is that I wanna use my HDD in the hard-drive enclosure also without this notebook. I wanna connect it to other computers.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Your grub seems has been installed on the external drive, so you need to repair it. Yes you can use the external hard drive on other machines. \nTo repair grub:\nWhen you install Windows, Windows assumes it's the only OS on the machine--or at least it doesn't account for Linux. So, it replaces grub with its own boot loader. What you have to do is replace the Windows boot loader with grub. I've seen various instructions for replacing grub by mucking around with grub commands or some such, but to me the easiest way is to simply chroot into your install and run update-grub. chroot is great because it allows you to work on your actual install, instead of trying to redirect things here and there. It's really clean.\nHere's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the live CD.\n\n*Determine the partition number of your main partition. GParted can help you here. I'm going to assume in this answer that it's /dev/sda2, but make sure you use the correct partition number for your system!\n\n*Mount your partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt  # make sure that sda2 is correct!\n\n\n*Bind mount some other necessary stuff:\nfor i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt$i\"; done\n\n\n*chroot into your Ubuntu install:\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n\n*At this point, you're in your install, not the live CD, and running as root. Update grub:\nupdate-grub\n\nIf you get errors, go to step 7. (Otherwise, it is optional.)\n\n*Depending on your situation, you might have to reinstall grub:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nupdate-grub # I'm not sure if this is necessary, but it doesn't hurt.\n\n\n*If everything worked without errors, then you're all set:\nexit\nsudo reboot\n\n\n*At this point, you should be able to boot normally.\nIf you cannot boot normally, and didn't do step 7 because there were no error messages, try again with step 7.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes giving GRUB2 the correct configuration for your partitions is not enough, and you must actually install it (or reinstall it) to the Master Boot Record, which step 7 does. Experience helping users in chat has shown that step 7 is sometimes necessary even when no error messages are shown.\n\n\n===================================================\nThe windows installer doesn't care about other OS in the system. So it writes own code over the master boot record. Its not a problem of windows installer, its intended. If you reinstall, upgrade windows you will face the issue. Fortunately the solution is easy too. \nYou need to repair the mbr. Do the following\nBoot using a live usb/cd of ubuntu. \nUse boot-repair to fix the problem.\nAfter booting with live usb/cd ,Run following command in terminal,\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nUse Recomended Repair.\n\nMore info - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nThese answers were given originally here.\n", "Q: Desktop not working Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I'm using Unity for quite some time now but for the past few days now I do not see anything on my Desktop, Unity itself seems to be working fine, my Launcher still works and my top-bar works fine as well.\nHowever nothing from my home/Desktop folder appears on my Desktop and the Background image is the same as my lock screen image and I am not able to change it. \nI tried using the Gnome desktop environment but the problem preexists.\nI also tried to reinstall unity, ubuntu-desktop and my graphics card driver, nothing has worked so far.\n\nA: Obviously you have to boot other (presumably new) $HOME folder after you was reinstalled twice your system.

Each time I attempt an install I received an  \"[Errno 5] Input/output error\", followed by the following message before the installer exits:\n\"The installer encountered an error copying files to the hard disk: [Errno 5] Input/output error This is often due to a faulty CD/DVD disk or drive, or a faulty hard disk. It may help to clean the CD/DVD, to burn the CD/DVD at a lower speed, to clean the CD/DVD drive lens (cleaning kits are often available from electronics suppliers), to check whether the hard disk is old and in need of replacement, or to move the system to a cooler environment.\"\nIn order to attempt to remedy this I have so far tried installing Ubuntu to two different hard disks, one of which is brand new, and each time I have received the same error \"Errno 5\" message. I have also tried installing from 3 different USB sticks using torrent and Ubuntu site iso images burned using both Unetbootin and Startup Disk Creator.  Again, these measures have proved fruitless.\nThe installation process varies depending of the iso I use, with the Ubuntu download page iso exiting at an earlier stage compared to the torrented iso.  The later torrent iso returns an error and exits when I am prompted for my name, computer's ID and password.\nI've never experienced anything like this when installing previous versions of Ubuntu.  I'm absolutely stumped!  Does anyone have any more ideas?\n\nA: I was getting the same exact \"errno 5\" error when trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop. What fixed it for me was burning the iso to a DVD at a very slow rate. For example, I used the \"Free ISO Burner\" software and used a burn rate of 2x instead of max. Perhaps you can try this method instead of a USB stick? Also, before burning the DVD, do make sure that you get the MD5 Checksum of the downloaded iso and compare it to the value here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes\nThis is just to verify the integrity of the iso in case you downloaded it from some untrustworthy mirror.\nIf using a DVD doesn't work either, then others facing similar issues in the past have recommended testing your RAM using the memtest86+ utility. You can use it from the Ubuntu LiveCD/DVD itself. For my laptop, I pressed Shift during bootup and launched memtest86+ from the GRUB menu.\n\nA: I tried to install Ubuntu Studio x64 for a month and repeatedly encountered this problem. It was also losing hard drive data and throwing dpkg errors... Running the system from a usb drive and encountering several other issues was becoming frustrating so I resolved to resolve the issue!\nI purchased a new HD... not a solution.\nI disconnected the CD drive... nope.\nI pulled one memory stick and then the other ~ no love...  \nAfter reading that someone had used a USB stick to do a memory test(in the present post) I got on that track and I did find a problem with my motherboard reading the RAM. ... but it wasn't the RAM that was at issue....\nLooking at the MB manufacturer's website I found that there were 2 bios updates that were aimed at improving compatibility with the memory.  \nSo I flashed the bios and Voila ~ it fixed all the issues with this system.  \nUbuntu Studio is a great system for running my media center.  Awesome!\nTo be clear: one should not simply read this and go download a bios update!!! Do the research and see if this might be the issue. If the bios is related to your issue(memory, ide/sata, clock issues) then you might want to do more research..  but don't shoot from the hip with bios flashing.  \nUnless you like bricks.  \nSo, though it was a solution for me it may or not fix your issue or even be a good idea. \n\nA: I had a similar problem: Error during installation of Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.\nThe error msg and cause was very puzzling, because I used exactly the same USB-stick to install on other systems.\nEventually I ran memtest 86, and 1 of the 4 modules came out bad.\nWould be nice if the error msg were more informative, and suggest test of more elements, not just CD/DVD and HD. As it came out, my RAM was bad.\n\nA: I had the same problem, so I created a bootable USB stick using Rufus USB installer, following these instructions\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nbut you must write image using DD image option.\n", "Q: How to get rid of multiple duplicate menus in Firefox bookmarks library? In my Firefox bookmarks in Ubuntu 14.04, every single folder in my library is duplicated, and I can't delete these duplicates. The duplicates are also linked, so if I change one, it changes the other.\nThis is a little hard to explain, so I have also posted a screenshot.\n\n\nA: This can be caused by a corrupted places.sqlite or by importing a HTML backup that created those extra, normal, folders instead of placing the bookmarks in the existing root bookmark folders that have the special icons.\nCheck this link for more info.\nAlso take a look on this addon: it will run some maintenance tasks on your browser and reindex the sqlite file.\nThis link (\"kb.mozillazine.org/Places.sqlite\") explains what is sqlite and what it has to do with Firefox.

When I connect the microphone and try to record, all I can hear is noise.

Most people doing these \"prove netflix is being throttled\" tests online use a vpn of some sort to mask the connection to netflix.\nIs there an easy way to do this using ubuntu so I can determine if my ISP is ripping me off or if the emulation is just bad and I need to look for another solution?\nNetflix is running using the pipelight plugin for linux on chrome, which uses user agent switcher to make Netflix think I'm running firefox on Windows.\nIt's a pretty standard way of doing this, but I really would like for there to be an easier way.\n\nA: Apart from VPN solution, you can use some tools such as the \"Glasnost test\" to compare your download speeds for different protocols. If no throttling activities are occurring, your download speeds should be comparable, if not identical, for HTTP apps, P2P apps and on demand video streaming services. If not, it means that the server you are accessing is slow, or that your ISP is throttling those particular types of content. \nHowever, modern networking is complicated. Something like Netflix will have lots of servers, in many countries. You may turn out to be accessing a server that's overloaded for some reason, for instance. Big content delivery services are very likely to be geographically distributed, so things may be different in different countries.\nIn general I think it's safe to say that most ISP throttling should be constant and predictable. If it's not constant then probably something else is going on.\n", "Q: last -t [date] not filtering results by date If I run:\nlast -t 20150101010101\n\nI still get logins displayed (even though the date is in the future)\nIf I run \nlast -t 20140723123000\n\nI still get logins displayed from months back. \nI would expect to only see logins from earlier on today.

On boot, I am seeing errors (in windows only; Unity and X.org still work fine as far as I know) that say that programs have crashed and to report it, and that a \"System problem detected\" or something similar, or \"Ubuntu 14.04 has experienced an internal error\".\nHow do I fix this without having to bring my swappiness up to 60, or can I not solve it in another way? Are these problems bugs or is this what happens when you change swappiness?\n\nA: I will take a guess here, taking the OP's remark as granted that the problem can be reverted by changing swappiness back to 60.\nThe Linux kernel will usually overcommit memory availability. If you reduce swappiness, you tell it to use the swap space to a lesser extent for RAM which programs need, as balanced against using the RAM for cached file data. If you set swappiness to 0, you request that your swap space should not be used at all.\nHowever, even with a swappiness of 0, the Linux kernel will change its behaviour once it estimates that it is close to an \"out of memory\" condition. Before that, it will simply not cache any file data in RAM. But once it figures that it is running out of memory, it will change its strategy and use any available swap area despite the swappiness setting (unless certain special conditions apply).\nYou report that you see this phenomenon during boot. This is a situation where many processes are started in parallel, start to analyse their config, allocate memory on demand, etc.\nWhile changing swappiness from 60 tp 30 does not change the total space for execution, maybe it does change the amount of memory which the kernel reports to be available. Or it could change the behaviour regarding the point in time when the OOM condition is determined.\nSo if you happen to have only just about enough RAM and swap for everything that is going to start, the effect you see might be an unfortunate behaviour when the kernel transitions from overreporting to actually providing memeory, or when it starts to believe that an out of memory condition is becoming more likely. The code in vmscan.c for example (responsible for freeing memory in RAM) will abruptly change its behaviour depending on such drastic change of conditions. \n", "Q: live cd installation I downloaded ubuntu-12.04.4-dvd-i386.iso from Ubuntu website, and I burn an image on a dvd.\nnow when I insert the dvd and restart my computer and booted it from the dvd I got a massage said: bootmngr missing press ctrl+alt+del to restart.\npleas any help.\n\nA: The Ubuntu DVD image you have downloaded must be corrupted.

Is there any custom repository related  solution for \"click\" packages?\n\nA: Click packages are the new packaging format used in Ubuntu Touch, and by Ubuntu 14.10, on the desktop version of Ubuntu as well.\nSome of the features they provide are:\nSimplified packaging for the developer. The Ubuntu SDK can automatically create Click packages of your Ubuntu Touch apps. If you want to create your own, the format is very simple, consisting of two files, manifest.json and <app-name>.json.\nThe manifiest.json file is the actual package definition and looks like this:\n{                                                     \n    \"description\": \"Your tasks, every device, everywhere. Create and synchronize tasks using Ubuntu One, and connect to your boards in Trello.\",\n    \"framework\": \"ubuntu-sdk-13.10\",\n    \"hooks\": {\n        \"ubuntu-tasks\": {\n            \"apparmor\": \"ubuntu-tasks.json\",\n            \"desktop\": \"ubuntu-tasks.desktop\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"maintainer\": \"John Doe <john.doe@gmail.com>\",\n    \"name\": \"com.ubuntu.developer.johndoe.ubuntu-tasks\",\n    \"title\": \"Ubuntu Tasks\",\n    \"version\": \"0.5\"\n}\n\nThe <app.name>.json file is the security profile for your app and looks like this:\n{\n    \"policy_groups\": [\n        \"networking\"\n    ],\n    \"policy_version\": 1\n}\n\nTo build your package, you can either use the Ubuntu SDK or by running\nclick build\n\nThe ability to run under confinement. What this means is that the app is prevented from doing bad things. It can only access its own private directory and access features that the user allows the app to use. This means that Click packages are very safe and the review process for publishing them is much simpler.\nOnce you've packaged your app, you can submit your application to the Click App Store. The review process is very simple and will be completed usually within a few hours. Once reviewed, your app will be available for installation from any device running Ubuntu Touch.\nWould they make Debian packaging easier?\nYes and no. Debian packaging is completely different. However, if your app is made with the Ubuntu SDK, you don't need to use Debian packaging and can instead use Click packaging, which is much easier to use and much safer for the end user.\n\nA: There is at least one other:\nhttps://open.uappexplorer.com/apps\nBut basically you can just download and install click packages from wherever.\nA click package has only one dependency, the ubuntu framework it was created against.\nWhatever extra libs it needs it has to hold them inside the package so there is really no need for repositories that will hold whole hierarchies of packages.\n", "Q: Error on installing downloaded Chrome .deb I have downloaded Chrome on 14.04 as .deb package.

To figure out how the attacker is gaining access, you will need to actively monitor the network from a system that has not been compromised, using some software like snort.\nIf your Ubuntu system has been hacked then you will need to do a complete re-install, and change all user passwords and disable any trusted remote access methods (e.g. ssh trusted keys), and reset all user accounts. Otherwise you run the risk that a backdoor may be hidden in the operating system, filesystem or home directories.\nDoing a proper post-compromise cleanup can be a lot of work. Whether it is worth doing depends on how much you value your security. I know one company where the management decided that they did not want to dedicate any resources to investigating a successful hack, even though they had no idea how the hackers got in, or how far they had compromised the network. The reality is that many companies end up in that situation.\n", "Q: Upgrading from 10.04 Server to 14.04 I have an Ubuntu dedicated server hosted at GoDaddy.\nI wish to make an upgrade from 10.04 to 14.04, however each time I login over SSH, I get the notice to be careful if I upgrade because I have RAID.\nSo, I wish to know where I need to be careful.\nI presume that is on installation of GRUB or kernel, but I don't know what I need to do for RAID hard disks.\nCan someone please tell me more about this specification?\nThanks\n(I haven't tried anything)\n\nA: The problem is that software RAID only replicates the partitions, not the MBR, so if you re-install grub you need to make sure that you install it to both drives.

The Ubuntu installer will allow you to do this very easily. See if it actually installs with this error when you boot from the Ubuntu partition.\n\n*If you don't see the problem,  just reinstall onto the whole disk and you'll be fine.  If you do,  make sure you have a good live disk (since you've tried installing drivers). Re-download it,  check the md5 checksum,  and try it again. \nIf neither of those work, only then would I go back and take a closer look at drivers and make sure I have the right ones installed. You'll need to install Ubuntu on your disk before installing drivers though. Installing them to a live disk won't do much good. \nI hope that helps! \n-Ryan \n", "Q: Unity3d & Unity WebPlayer Can't get these working I'm trying to get Unity3d work on Ubuntu 14.04 and also Unity Webplayer.\nAs a young Game developer, its very important I have Unity (Game Engine) so I can continue to make games.

The latest seems a more simpler choice for users who come from Windows, but Lubuntu 14.04.1 has already been released.\nI am not an expert, but if the method in the link of the first reply did not work, it might be a screen resolution problem and the most voted answer in this topic might solve the problem:\nHow do I safely change grub2 screen resolution?\nYou should be aware that a system called Grub is loaded before Linux and then you can prevent Linux from being loaded in order to change its loading way.\nAnd you can also open a text terminal when Linux has finished loading. In a terminal you can run command to change the screen resolution and edit files to vary the default screen resolution. Press and hold Ctrl+Alt+F1 to open to a text terminal and Ctrl+Alt+F7 to go back to the usual graphic terminal. \nThat most voted answer describe how to change the screen resolution before Linux starts being loaded and a reply by @user01 to this most voted tells how to do the same after Linux has finished loading. \nAnyway I do not know if this can be a screen resolution problem, but I wanted to note the information about terminals and grub and suggest this other option.\nYou can download Lubuntu 14.04.1 from www.lubuntu.net.\nGoodbye\n", "Q: Which niceness to give to prevent freezing? If I wanted to give my main system, desktop cinnamon, the highest priority, which PID should I set this for?  \nThe reason is because I have a program that runs for days and would hog up all the resources to a point where I can't even move my mouse.  It calls several programs on demand so its difficult to set which program to lower priority.  When it runs I can't do anything else.   Thus I'm wonder if I can just give my window the highest priority instead?  thanks! \nAhdee  \n\nA: The process that eats up the most CPU in normal usage is probably the X server. First, find the pid (Process ID) of your X process:\nps aux | grep /usr/bin/X\n\nThis will give you a line starting with root [pid] ....\nNow, let's increase the priority:\nsudo renice -5 [pid]\nThis sets the priority to 20 (the default priority) minus 5 (the nice value), resulting in a total priority of 15. The lower the priority number, the more often the process will be scheduled for processing. You can check the priority with the top command. Experiment until you are satisfied. However, renice is a dangerous command and may make your system unusable (until a reboot).\n", "Q: How do I make the Suspend Option Appear in 14.04 with Cinnamon 2.2 I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 13.10 with Cinnamon 2 to Ubuntu 14.04 with Cinnamon 2.2 I no longer have the option to Suspend from the shutdown menu.

When accessing this server with my authenticated username from my iPhone webdav client and uploading files, the files are owned by www-data:www-data which is what I expect, since that's the user that runs Apache.\nHowever when I access the share with my laptop (Running Ubuntu Gnome) through the Nautilus file browser, the files I create end up with my username and group for my laptop's user (mordecai:mordecai) which doesn't make sense to me, since I'm using the same protocol and user-password credentials on both systems.

This is only locally, these permissions are not carried over to the webDAV server. As per the man page of davfs2:\n   FILE OWNER AND PERMISSIONS\n\n   davfs2  implements  Unix  permissions  for access control. But changing\n   owner and permissions of a file is only local.

This means that you can substitute $3 for another value if it is not displaying the correct part (i.e $1,$2,$all).\n", "Q: lightdm failed to start session; user folder requesting Gnome We're migrating some old 10.10 users on Gnome to 14.04 using Unity.

Does anyone know of any such software for the Ubuntu system?\n\nA: There are several options, depending on what and how you are trying to filter.\n1 -If you simply wish to filter most \"adult content\" sites you can use opendns . Opendsn is easy to set up and they will do most of the work for you (maintaining blacklists)\nhttp://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/parental-controls/opendns-home/\n2 - You can download a blacklist of ip addresses from the internet and use iptables or your hosts file to block ip. This is sort of difficult in that you have to update the list from time to time.\n3 - If you want to filter content, you can use a proxy. My favorites are privoxy and squid.\nSee http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/6-of-the-best-content-filters-for-linux-698307#articleContent for ideas.\n4 - You can use addins or plugins, adblock for firefox for example.\n", "Q: What is ubuntu 14.04 doing while showing \"stopping early crypto disks\"?

After successful installation, it restarted as usual. But after showing message of below, it hangs. Actually, I created virtual machines to install ubuntu at Virtual Box successfully several times. It's very easy. The installed ubuntu versions ranged from 9.10, 13.04 and even 14.04 before. I don't know why this time it hangs at restarting after successful installation.

Is this possible? Do I need to buy something else to play them? I thought the Chromecast was going to be the answer but I can't find any working software.\n\nA: While there isn't any support for casting the desktop to Chromecast (yet), you could instead try playing the video files on the Raspberry Pi itself. This could be achieved by using sshfs, which displays the contents of a folder on your computer on the Raspberry Pi by using SSH.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you have openssh-client and sshfs installed on the Raspberry Pi, and openssh-server installed on your computer. The following steps will be on the Raspberry Pi only.\n\n*Run sudo usermod -aG fuse pi, where pi is the username on your Raspberry Pi, and log in and out of your account for the changes to take effect.\n\n*Create a folder that will display the files in your computer. (For example, mkdir computerVideos).\n\n*Run sshfs captainjamie@192.168.1.101:/home/captainjamie/Videos computerVideos, where captainjamie is the username on your computer, 192.168.1.101 is the local IP address of your computer, /home/captainjamie/Videos is the folder on your computer containing the videos, and computerVideos is the folder you created in the previous step.\n\n*The files in your computer will display in the computerVideos folder. Run any videos you want.\nNote that this could be extended to any other files as well.\nAs noted by @Jos above in the comments, you can use XBMC to get a nice media player interface with support for plugins.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS stops at start I've installed the updates, and at the end it asked me to restart the computer.

If that is working you can start log in there and type startx. If that fail you can try sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop \n\nA: First things first: the current LTS version of Ubuntu is 14.04.

When choosing what direction the antenna should be directed it would be very useful to get some sort of measure for the signal strength for each direction. The modem it self just gives 3 levels with different led colors, and I suspect that is not enough for me.\nI found many questions about getting the signal strength for a USB stick modem, but how about a real modem that is connected to the laptop through an ethernet cabel.\nI tried Ixconn, but could not get it working. It just says \"Modem not responding\".\nI'm using 12.04\n\nA: Hmm... the answer might depend a lot on the modem type, all are \"real\" ;-)\nHere is a google search for \"Fastrack\" modem manuals,\nhttps://www.google.se/?gfe_rd=cr&safe=off#q=fastrack+modem+manual&safe=off\nIf you look through them you eventually find \"AT+CSQ\" in there, The prepended \"+\" followed by \"CSQ\" is short for \"Cellular, Signal Quality\" (edit: see comment below). \nA modem of this type may me accessed through a serial port where you 'type' AT-commands and get them executed.

I managed to successfully update my system to 14.04 about a month ago using update manager, but was left with many unresolved bugs that I could not work around. So, defeated, I decided to reset everything and do a fresh install.\nOn attempting to update 12.04 to 12.10, I get errors in both update manager and terminal indicating a \"failure to fetch\" due to network problems.

Then paste generated list into /etc/apt/sources.list (better backup first). Then run sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade -y then run do-release-upgrade. It's highly possible that you also have to repair grub after that. And to do that you will need bootable CD or USB, so you simply can run your update from Live CD. And that is the second option.\n\nA: You should set source.list to EOL repositories as described here: End of Life Upgrades\ni.e. to something like\nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ CODENAME main restricted universe multiverse\n\nmaybe you need additionally change value of \"Notify me of a new Ubuntu version\" from  \"For long-term support version\" to \"For any new version\".

How do I switch the java that I use to Oracle's version?\n\nA: If you do not want to use openjdk, I suggest you remove the openjdk completely. One easy way is to install synaptic which is a nice tool listing all available and installed packages and write in the quick filter openjdk select everything that is installed and remove it.\n(You have to wait a bit until it is finished indexing. It takes a lot of time only the first time you run synaptic)\nIf you want to keep openjdk as well then you should remove only the icedtea-plugin which is the plugin for the browsers. You should also type the command \"which java\", and from there follow the links which will lead you to the executable. Find the last link to the executable and change that to point to your preffered java. I think the links go like this: \"which java\"-> /usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java/-> .\nthe links from one file to another are shown if you use the command \"ls -Alh\" or its alias \"ll\" (that is two L's). if you want to list the first link to the  java executable just write \"ll /usr/bin/java\".  \n", "Q: Boot to Ubuntu if specific USB is inserted I have a Windows desktop machine that I share with my wife.

I imagine that I have to install grub to the USB drive?\nHow can I do this? Thanx for any advice!\n\nA: I would try to just set up your boot priorities in the BIOS. Set it to boot from a USB as the first option and then set your HDD with the Windows OS as the second option. That way when the computer is first turned on it will run through that sequence. If the USB is inserted it will go to that, if its not it will default to windows.

It does not matter to them what OS they are on, all and everything is new.\n\n*Guides are written by and for adults. They won't understand them. Whenever they look up things (e.g. how to install Minecraft mods) they exclusively use video tutorials.\n\n*Kids love to experiment. We need to makes sure that we can reset the system any time. Automated backups in the background are a good means for quick repair if all went wrong.\n\n*We should only grant them sudo permissions if we were happy with frequent reinstallations.\n\n*They get on very well with the desktop, and how to use their applications. They learn by doing, trying, clicking here, clicking there. At the end of the day they manage to do whatever they need without any guide.\n\n*In case they get stuck, it may be a good idea to have access to that machine (e.g. physically or remotely with VNC or SSH). This helps to reduce frustration.\n\n*Don't over-protect them. A locked down restricted machine is bad for experimenting. In the long run it is better to not leave them alone.\n\n*Install an Internet site rating tool for the browser and educate them why there are warnings for some sites.\n\n*Complaints about their friend's Windows to be so much better will come.

But I've also found many tutorials of how to install and run bumblebee on this very same distribution.\nSo my question is... is bumblebee still required in order to properly use and alternate between my laptop's discrete and dedicated graphics cards or I should expect them to work as intended out-of-the-box? \nWhat exactly do they mean by \"native support\"?\n\nA: It is in the NVIDIA Settings which is installing with the nonfree driver, but I don't switch often to compare performance. \n", "Q: Wifi Adapter can see AP, but cannot connect My wifi card is: Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR928X Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express) (rev 01)\nMy problem is that when I attempt to connect to a wifi network it refuses the connection and requests I input the correct password.

Once you've download about seventeen packages on another computer, transfer them with a USB stick to the desktop of the computer with Ubuntu on it. Then do:\ncd ~/Desktop\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nThen:\nGo here and download the driver 3.15-rc1-1 to your computer then place the file on your desktop and right click and extract here.\nThen compile the driver using the directions below.\ncd ~/Desktop/backports-3.15-rc1-1\nmake defconfig-ath9k\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe -rv ath9k \nsudo modprobe -v ath9k\n\nWhen you have an upgrade to the kernel you will need to do:\ncd ~/Desktop/backports-3.15-rc1-1\nmake clean\nmake defconfig-ath9k\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe -rv ath9k \nsudo modprobe -v ath9k\n\n", "Q: How to use a sources list generator I've been trying to install packages using terminal but I keep getting errors and it turns out my sources.list file is really messed up.\nSo I found this webstite that generates a sources.list file for you\nI know my country and my release but I have no idea what other boxes are supposed to be ticked or not because I don't know what they mean.\nMy overall goal is just to have an up-to-date version of Ubuntu that is able to have Player, Stage and ROS installed on it.\n\nA: Since what you want is, essentially, simple, the sane thing to do is just revert all your changes instead of using third parties which can be too complicated. Just copy the /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list file to /etc/apt/ and remove the files in your /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory. Or, in simple commands:\nsudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list{,.bk}\nsudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list.d{,.bk}\nsudo mkdir /etc/apt/sources.list.d\nsudo cp /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThat will restore the original sources.list file, without complications.\n\nA: The most basic system will just have the:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Main  \n\n*Updates  \n\n*Security Updates  \nrepositories, but I recommend following the \"normal\" route below.\n\njust a working system..\nIf you just want to get back to a working system then check:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Main  \n\n*Restricted  \n\n*Universe  \n\n*Multiverse  \n\n*Security (under the \"Ubuntu Updates\" section)\n\n*Updates (under the \"Ubuntu Updates\" section)  \nThese are the most common repos that people use.  \nI, personally, would also enable the:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Canonical Partner \n\n*Extras\nrepositories, but those are entirely optional.  \n3rd party repos..\nIf you aren't sure or just want a working system, leave these alone. You won't need them. Otherwise, go ahead and check any software you will want to use. These repositories are good for getting software that isn't in any of the other repos or software newer than those in the repos.  \nThe one exception to this might be the \"Oracle Java (JDK) Installer PPA\" repository, which is the best (IMO) way to get the Oracle Java JDK on Ubuntu. If you aren't going to develop Java apps or do anything else that requires the Java JDK, then the above applies here: skip it. If you need it later, it isn't hard to get.  \nNote that you will have to install the software to actually \"get\" it. This just adds the software to your sources so it is possible to install it.  \nWhen you're done, click \"Generate List\". You'll need to put the generated list in the /etc/apt/sources.list file, replacing anything already present in the file. If you selected any 3rd party repos you will need to add the GPG keys. Follow the directions in the \"Getting the GPG keys\" box.\n\nA: If you have a private mirror, you can use\nhttps://gist.github.com/JonasGroeger/6dc444411301ca467cc2\n", "Q: What is wrong with my ~./profile? I'm pretty new to Linux.  I have been trying to install ant, java, and the android sdk.  In the process have been messing with my ~/.profile and also with my /etc/.profile (dangerous, I know).  Well I did something wrong and restarted my computer and when I would try to login, it would kick me back to the login screen.  I eventually used a tty to rename my ~/.profile and made a new ~/.profile where I just deleted the last part of the profile.  Here is the original file that messed me up which I renamed .profile.copy: \n# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.\n# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login\n# exists.\n# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.\n# the files are located in the bash-doc package.\n\n# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask\n# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.\n#umask 022\n\n# if running bash\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n    . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin\" # Add RVM to PATH for scripting\n\nPATH=\"$PATH:~/adt/sdk/tools:~/adt/sdk/platform-tools\"\n\nANT_HOME=/home/computeruser/\n\nPATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/bin\nPATH=${PATH}:${ANT_HOME}/bin\n\nPATH=\"$+PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/bin:~/adt/sdk/:/usr/bin/ant\" \nPATH=\"$+PATH:/usr/bin:/bin:/home/computeruser:/home/computeruser/apache-ant-1.9.4:/home/computeruser/apache-ant-1.9.4/bin:/home/computeruser/adt/sdk/tools:/home/computeruser/adt/sdk/platform-tools\"\n\nIn the ~/.profile that actually works now, I just deleted the line \nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin\" # Add RVM to PATH for scripting\n\nand all the lines below it.

Every time I use the software updater and restart the system, the page scrolling breaks. No matter what windows has the keyboard/input focus, the mouse scroll would scroll through the desktop screens\ninstead of the in focus folder-manager or web browser, or any other in-focus application.\n\n*I also lose host-to-guest drag and drop which I use a lot, and I'm pretty sure I lose all the other features that require Guest Additions to work.\n\n*So every time I install software updates through the GUI app, the Guest Additions break. I have to reinstall the Guest Addition every time to get these fixes back. I have a feeling I am going in circles. \n\n*Why does the Guest Additions fix these annoyances? Why doesn't the standard OS fix the scroll bug? It doesn't make sense because a bug fix should not be an add-on.\nHonestly, why is it so hard to get things to be permanent. xrandr requires writing a dangerous config file to make the resolution permanent. Guest additions also don't seem to permanent either.\nI use these instructions to install the guest additions and they work every time.\n\nA: You need the dkms package installed in the guest and the host or every time there is a kernel update it will break the guest additions and virtual box will not load and you will have to run:\nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup  \n\nThe VirtualBox kernel module is automatically installed on your system when you install VirtualBox. To maintain it with future kernel updates, for those Linux distributions which provide it -- most current ones -- we recommend installing Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS). This framework helps with building and upgrading kernel modules.\nBe sure to install DKMS before installing the Linux Guest Additions. If DKMS is not available or not installed, the guest kernel modules will need to be recreated manually whenever the guest kernel is updated.\nIf DKMS is not already installed, execute the following:\nsudo apt-get install dkms\n\ndkms \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 used too much processor after latest updatest after updating ubuntu 14.04 it uses 25-50% of my processor continuously causing my laptop turnoff automatically by overheating. i have no problem before the updates. graphic driver is not a problem, i installed proprietary driver successfully. \nMy processor is i5 for laptop so i believe i should not having a problem. \nThe main cause of overheating my laptop is Ubuntu latest update. please help us resolve this. \nThanks.\n\nA: I had a similar issue in my laptop.

Probably you'll also resolve your overheating. 2 things to solve your issue.\n\nNote that while I didn't encounter any issues on my laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 with intel_pstate enabled and from what I've read, it works for others as well, it might not work properly for you so use it at your own risk and only enable it if you know how to disable it in case something goes wrong!\n\n1. Enable Intel P-state:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type in the terminal sudo gedit /etc/default/grub \n\n*Find the Line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" and modify\nit as GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash intel_pstate=enable\"\n\n*Save and exit gedit. Now type sudo update-grub in terminal and wait the grub to update\n\n*Reboot and test\nTo test:\nTry running cpupower frequency-info and you'll get some output similar to\nanalyzing CPU 0:\n  driver: intel_pstate\n  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0\n  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0\n  maximum transition latency: 0.97 ms.\n  hardware limits: 1.20 GHz - 3.30 GHz\n  available cpufreq governors: performance, powersave\n  current policy: frequency should be within 1.20 GHz and 3.30 GHz.\n                  The governor \"performance\" may decide which speed to use\n                  within this range.\n  boost state support:\n    Supported: no\n    Active: no\n    25500 MHz max turbo 4 active cores\n    25500 MHz max turbo 3 active cores\n    25500 MHz max turbo 2 active cores\n    25500 MHz max turbo 1 active cores\n\nTo change the profile of CPU running run this: sudo cpupower frequency-set -g powersave\nReplace powersave with performance if you require more performance. (There is no performance issue for me. I am in power save mode)\n2. Install Thermald\njust run the command sudo apt-get install thermald\nThis will start automatically\nAlways google the stuffs before you install to know more about it\nHope this solves your issue.

It runs and consumes battery. You have hybrid graphics so battery will last longer, \nbut for this\nyou should install graphics drivers. \n\nA: I have an Asus laptop that had a usable battery in it, with windows I could get 35-40 minutes from it.\nWith Ubuntu I can get about 35-40 seconds(12.04 LTS, running a tab in Chromium and Libreoffice)\nHere is my take on it:\nUbuntu does not have drivers for the various power supply optimizers that windows has.\nIf you have ever disassembled a Lion battery pack, you can see that each cell has its own terminals that connect to the computer.\nHowever, I think that Ubuntu is utilizing one of those cells, which as a result has become severely overdrained(and damaged). \nIt fails to detect the other cells and therefore does not use the bat pack's full capacity.\nI read this thread:\nBattery life starts at 2:30 hrs (99%), but less than 1 minute later is only 1:30 hrs (99%)\nand it may be a similar issue.\nI am no tech nut.

At the next login, allow up to a couple of minutes for the applications to show up again.\nPlease note that this is not the same as reinstalling Zeitgeist, which in this case is useless, IMHO.\n\nA: As it is only constrained to your user account, it must have something to do with your user.\nMaybe one of the .desktop files in your home folder is tripping the launcher up? Can you try moving the files in these folders all somewhere else:\n\n\n*\n\n*/home/<youruser>/.gnome/apps/\n\n*/home/<youruser>/.local/usr/share/applications/\ne.g.\n$ mkdir backup_local\n$ mkdir backup_gnome\n$ mv .local/share/applications/*.desktop backup_local/\n$ mv .gnome/apps/*.desktop backup_gnome/\n\nThen logout, login and see if it changed anything? You can always move them back in if it didn't help. If it did help, try moving them in one by one to which file was the culprit.\nEDIT: You can find out which one was malformed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the desktop-file-utils package:\nsudo apt-get install desktop-file-utils \n\n\n*Check each of the .desktop files for validity using desktop-file-validate:\ndesktop-file-validate .local/share/applications/*.desktop\ndesktop-file-validate .gnome/apps/*.desktop\n\nOr of course at the different location if you already moved it. It will print nothing if all files are OK. If any of the files are malformed, it will print one error message per line.\nYou might also want to check the other desktop files for good measure:\ndesktop-file-validate /usr/share/applications/*.desktop\n\n\nA: Notice that there is no Applications under the Types or Categories in your case (see attched picture for contrast). I had the same problem after upgrading from 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS. The solution worked for me is\nDash (from Unity) does not showing Applications\nI copy the answer here:\nsudo apt-get purge unity-lens-applications    \nsudo apt-get install unity-lens-applications \n\nthen log off & login. \n\n\nA: At somepoint during my session in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS the application search stopped responding, showing the same error. The solution that I've found is to open the terminal (CtrlAltT) and kill the home scope\n$ kill $(pgrep -f unity-scope-home/unity-scope-home) \n\nThe scope has restarted and the application search has resumed its capabilities\n\nA: If its only about applications, but other files can be well researched in Dash, you might try this, and re-login after:\nrm ~/.cache/software-center -R\n\n\nA: I faced the same problem today, under Ubuntu 14.10. Rebooted, and suddenly no more apps in the dash, and none of the proposed solutions (delete the cache, reinstall the lenses, delete the zeitgeist data) worked for me.\nFortunately, I remembered the one system change I'd applied a few hours earlier: I had changed my locale from de_DE.UTF-8 to just de_DE via:\nsudo update-locale LANG=de_DE\n\nSo if none of the solutions work, try changing your locale to a unicode-aware one. For me, this was:\nsudo update-locale LANG=de_DE.UTF-8\n\nfollowed by a reboot. Everything works as expected now.\n\nA: This may or may not help in your case, but in my case I was running out of space on the root partition of my hard drive.  I kept on getting messages about having less than a Gig of available space.  This issue started to happen around then.  So clearing some space and restarting did the magic.\nAlso keep an eye out for any issues that happened around the same time that could have caused it.  i.e. applications you may have installed, new hardware you added, drivers you updated etc.\n\nA: The answer for me was the comment by Sary:\n\n... the \"Applications\" dashboard plugin was somehow deactivated.\n\n", "Q: After update, dell e5440 enable wireless option is missing After system update wireless connection is completely ruined.

And it sounds natural, it's easy to understand and it recognizes units (m, °C,kg, ...).\nHere is my first post about pico2wave.\nAll you have to do is: Go to Ubuntu Software Center and search for \"pico\". You'll find 4 or 5 entries with \"Small Footprint Ling...\". Install them.\nA possible use of pico2wave is described in my first posting (follow the link above).\n\nA: And yet another espeak gui: gespeaker. It uses both espeak and mbrola engines. Also, it has more options than espeak-gui.\n\nA: The following is not a FLOSS solution, but you may find it worthwhile. (it is a wine solution),    \nI'm personally very keen on TTS, I use it quite often... eg. listening to a rambling discourse which I would never bother to stick with otherise (because I need to get another cup of coffee...  :)  \nA few things I've discovered along the way.. or should I say, things I haven't discovered along the way...  To put it bluntly: Every piece of FOSS TTS voice software I've tried  is under par and therefore unsuitable for any semi-protracted listening...   \nI currently use ATnT's NaturalVoices. It is only available for Windows (maybe the Mac), but it does run under wine in Ubuntu .. (it has minor glytch, where I sometimes need to click on the panel when I move away from the reader... It is a minor issue when compared to the advantage gained by quality of speech from NatualVoices.  \nSome other things I've found to be virtually essential for a half-sensible listening experience, are;...  \n\n\n*\n\n*These TTS progamas are not intelligent (well maybe as intelligent as a young baboon) .. so they need every bit of help they can get. and there is one (and only one Reader program I've found which helps greatly in this..  The app is called ReadPlease (2003 Pro)...  It allowd you to specially modify words and groups of word to be pronounced as you want them... It is by no means perfect, but for me, it made the difference between the entire process being usable and not usable... \n\n*The speech in Natural Voices is \"okay\", but it is a bit boring. There are other good products too, but they are all for Windows, unfortunately)..\nIt infeclts surprisingl well sometimes .. but OMG, initially it is a pain! .. so #2 is *patience... and lots of updating of your \"special words\" list ... By patience, I mean you(I) actually became accustomed to my particular baboon's speech patterns :)... and by the way, I currently have about 3000 words that now sound \"Human\" enough that I no longer cringe when I hear them. \n3.. \"Follow the Bouncing Ball\" ... Again because the voice is never as good as a real speaker, things sometimes need to be clarified .. . The Reader program I use has one feature for which I even put up with its clunky looking interface....  Is has a \"select the currently being read\" word option..  Many readers have this, but ReadPlease keeps the current line bang on center of the screen .. This is invaluable to be able to see ahead and behind to quickly re-read what you just missed (so auto-centering the curent line is good)... \nWell that's my experience.. I'm going to make a coffee now, and while I'm doing it, I'll be listening to this, to see how it \"reads\"....

I might be wrong, but I've spent a lot of time googling and there seems to be almost no information. And I am definitely frustrated with what I could find...\nLong Story: It is very hard to find much details on the net. From what I understand, when the ubuntu folk wanted to take menubars out of the applications they did the right thing: they sat down, talked to people and wrote a spec for exporting menus over dbus --- the dbusmenu. Then they implemented a gtk patch and paid a guy to implement a kde solution. The kde solution was accepted upstream but the gtk one remained as a downstream patch. I assume it was because the GNOME folk just weren't interested in global menubars, but I couldn't find any info on this. \nSome time later, the GNOME folk suddenly decided that they wanted their applications to better blend with MAC OS, which has a global menu bar too. \n(<rant>yay for compatibility with a closed source os and ignoring compatibility with an open source os</rant>). But instead of working with everyone else, they decided to go their own route and invent a new way to export menus over dbus. This of course broke the menubar integration of gtk apps in KDE. But not only this, they also declared the dbus protocol an implementation detail thus making it impossible for the kde folk to support it. Moreover, they weren't interested in any discussion at all. A bug was filed in their bugzilla [1]. This bug was closed as WONTFIX and the reporter was directed to the gtk-devel-list. The message [2] posted there got no response. And from reading the comments on the bugreport I got the idea that the GNOME folk are not interested in compatibility with other DE's at all.\nOh, and, btw, the CANONICAL folk, who everyone loves to hate for inventing their own stuff, are trying to fix this by working on a qt solution (qmenumodel)... When that will be available for kde, though, is not clear. Probably not for Trusty (as kde 4.12 is feature frozen and no new releases are planned in the kde 4.* series).\nLinks\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=711504\n\n*https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2013-November/msg00006.html\n\nA: You can set it by following command in terminal:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity integrated-menus false\n\n\nA: According to this topic on ubuntuforums.org, appmenu can be enabled on GTK2 applications by installing the unofficially patched GTK2 libraries from PPA.\n\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:joe-yasi/appmenu\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install appmenu-gtk\n\nUnfortunately, there is no working fix for GTK3.\n\nA: While this is not about Kubuntu 14.04, it might still be useful for the future readers.\nPlasma officially supports GTK applications for the global menu since Plasma 5.14 released in October 2018 (search for \"global menu\" in the announcement).\nFull details in the developer blog.\n", "Q: keyboard layout switching doesn't work properly in gnome 3.

I tried many solutions, but I only managed to enable 2.1 settings with subwoofer, but when I check the sound I can only hear some noises from the laptop, not the subwoofer.\nI have added this at the end of the file:\n\n/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\noptions snd-hda-intel model=asus-mode4\n\nbut it doesn't change anything.\nAlso, adding\n\n[Mapping analog-surround-21]\ndevice-strings = surround40:%f\nchannel-map = front-left,front-right,lfe,lfe\npaths-output = analog-output analog-output-speaker\npriority = 7\ndirection = output\n\nto the file:\n\n/usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets/extra-hdmi.conf\n\ndoesn't help.\nOf course I changed the line in\n\n/etc/pulse/daemon.conf\n\nto\n\nenable-lfe-remixing = yes\n\nbut all in all, it leads to nothing. I managed to enable 2.1 by adding the line:\n\nload-module module-combine channels=3 channel_map=front-left,front-right,lfe\n\nto the file:\n\n/etc/pulse/default.pa\n\nbut, as I said, during the subwoofer check in Sound Settings I only heard some noises from the laptop.\nHave you got any idea how to get it working? Thanks for any help. :)\n\nA: Although the solution given by Mike works for many people, some models have different pins. If you're using ASUS N56JR you'll follow the following as arch's documentations say:\nInstall alsa-tools-gui if you haven't already.\nsudo apt-get install alsa-tools-gui\n\nThen open hdajackretask (you might have to open it with sudo privileges to make the changes take effect):\nhdajackretask\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the codec: Realtek ALC663\n\n*Check Options -> Show unconnected pins\n\n*Find Pin ID: 0x16\n\n*Check Override and select Internal speaker (LFE)\n\n*Click on Apply now\n\n*Open sound settings and change your sound mode to Analog Surround 4.0 Output\n\nTest your subwoofer and if it worked, click on install boot override at hdajackretask and reboot your computer.\n\nA: I found the solution to your problem!\n\n\n*\n\n*Install alsa-tools-gui (sudo apt-get install alsa-tools-gui)\n\n*Start hdajackretask (either enter that in the terminal or find it in Unity)\n\n*Select the codec: Realtek ALC668\n\n*Check Options -> Show unconnected pins\n\n*find Pin ID: 0x1a\n\n*check Override and select Internal speaker (LFE)\n\n*press Apply now\nIf it works fine, select Install boot override and reboot.\nHave fun with your subwoofer!\n", "Q: why skype installs only older version on ubuntu 12.04?

I have two external drives--one is NTFS and one is ext4. Right now I am waiting for the contents of the slightly older NTFS drive to copy over to the ext4 drive. I'll use these drives at different times; NTFS for copying files from Windows, and ext4 for copying from Ubuntu, which means that the drives will have slightly different contents, but they'll both be equally as important as one as another. There will be no master copy that can just overwrite the other.\nWithout simply using Ubuntu to copy the drive contents across to the other drive every time I change something, how can I keep the two drives in sync?\n\nA: I use Grsync to do just that.\nI copy the contents of Dropbox to my WD 1TB NAS then copy the contents of the NAS to an attached USB 1TB external drive.\nThe first time it runs it takes an age to complete, but thereafter it only copies changed files so runs in a flash (no pun intended).\nGrsync is a graphical frontend to rsync.

I get the installed files in /usr/include or sometimes in /usr/lib folder when I install using the above command written.\nHow to do it in case of source code?\n\nA: The recommended way to install a library which was downloaded in its source code form is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Assuming you are in the home folder, extract the .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.xz file using,\ntar xf source_filename\n\n*Go to the folder /home/some_user/libxxx/ (the folder into which the previous tar command extracted the files)\n\n*Run,\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local\nmake\nsudo make install\nThis installs the library in '/usr/local' which is the recommended path according to the convention when you are not installing a software via any package manager. Also, this will not pollute the existing libraries in '/usr/lib' which makes maintenance easy in case you wish to uninstall the library in future.\n", "Q: Change Terminator title command How to change temporarily the name of one of the subterminals in Terminator from the command line of that specific subterminal?\nI have tried for example this:\necho -ne \"\\033]0;SOME TITLE HERE\\007\"\n\nbut without success\n\nA: I just hit the same problem and think its a bug/feature.\nI'm using 'terminator 0.97' and for me the following only works if you have not already set a title for your terminator terminal using '--title' or '-T':\necho -ne \"\\033]0;SOME TITLE HERE\\007\"\n\n\nA: I'm on Ubuntu 15.04, using BASH in Terminator.

The gateway tells the system how to route to any IP address not in any of the subnets to which it is directly connected. Normally this is the route to \"the Internet\", so should not be present for a connection to an internal network unless the route to the Internet is on a host on that network.

Is there anyway to extract iso or convert it to zip, rar, or tar file?\nI have a big .iso file on my remote server and I just want a file from it, not all of that; unfortunately I do not have root access, so it's my problem.\n\nA: You are mixing things up: an ISO is a data dump (often from a dvd/cd/bd). You mount ISO's as you would mount a hard disk. And when mounted you can \"cd\" into the directories and copy files from it.\nIf you are unsure about command line install software that can mount ISOs.

There is a command line method in there too. If you mount it in your own /home/$USER/ folder there is no need for sudo. Example:\nmount -o loop file.iso /home/$USER/Downloads/\n\nwill mount file.iso in your ~Downloads.\n\nA: Without root access you'll have to grab the entire file, move it to a box where you have root access, and then mount the iso to pull just a single file out of it.\n\nA: You can can convert an Iso file into a rar, tar or zip or any other compression file format using an online file converter, such as ISO to RAR, ISO to tar , and ISO to Zip.\nYou can format your file if its size is up to 300MiB.\n\nA: If you want only to extract a few files from an .iso file, you can just open it using the \"Archives\" application.\n", "Q: I'm trying to do a sudo apt-get upgrade, but there are some packages that are no longer required.

I tried boot-repair but that didn't fix the problem in the BIOS there are can see entries for the UEFI but when you select it it doesn't boot.\njust to clarify this machine has only UBUNTU 14.04 in LVM partition... no Windows\nThanks in advance\n\nA: I recommend you read up a bit on how EFI works, since your question reveals a number of common misunderstandings, largely caused by applying BIOS assumptions to the EFI world. Adam Williamson posted a useful blog post on this subject, so that's a good start. The introduction to my page on EFI boot loaders for Linux is another site that can be a useful starting point.\nThe most critical point to understand is that under EFI, disks are not bootable in the same sense that they are under BIOS. EFI boot loaders are stored as files on a FAT partition known as the EFI System Partition (ESP). A single ESP can house any number of boot loaders. The computer decides which boot loader to use based on its own boot manager's entries, which are stored in NVRAM. You can manipulate those entries in any number of ways, such as by using the bcfg command in an EFI shell or the efibootmgr utility in Linux. The better EFIs also provide a user interface so that you can make changes from their setup tools.\nChances are your firmware update erased or re-ordered your NVRAM entries. Thus, you may need to re-create a working entry or at least change the boot order. See here or here for some basic information on how to do this with efibootmgr. In theory, the Boot Repair program you've tried should be able to do this; but it sometimes doesn't work. Also, Boot Repair must be run from an EFI-mode boot in order to do this properly. This is one of the hurdles that can be difficult to overcome, since many users accidentally boot in BIOS mode rather than in EFI mode.\nMy rEFInd boot manager can be helpful because it works only in EFI mode. If you download the USB flash drive or CD-R image and boot with it, you'll be guaranteed of booting rEFInd in EFI mode (or not at all). It should then detect your Linux installation -- but since you use LVM, you may need to either boot via the GRUB option or hit F2 or Insert twice and enter a correct root= option to boot a Linux kernel directly. Once you've booted Linux, you can use efibootmgr to re-enable GRUB or you can install the Debian-package version of rEFInd to use it from your hard disk.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Randomly Freezes I tried Ubuntu and Kubuntu but both are freezing on my desktop PC.\nI can still move my mouse pointer but nothing reacts.

Both mount and cat /proc/mounts do not give me all the options I specified in the 'options' field in /etc/fstab.\nFor example, this is in my /etc/fstab:\n# <file system>                                 <mount point>   <type>  <options>                                       <dump>  <pass>\nUUID=1afaad96-8aa3-4283-95a4-20510e5b3fbb      /               ext4    rw,async,exec,nouser,suid,errors=remount-ro     0       1\n\nBut the output of mount just gives me this (mount -v doesn't work either):\n/dev/sda6 on / type ext4 (rw)\n\nAnd `cat /proc/mounts:\nrootfs / rootfs rw 0 0\n\nHow can I check with what options my file systems are mounted?\n\nA: The /proc/mounts file should indeed contain the options (including default options for each filesystem), however the rootfs entry that you picked out is just a ramfs over which the actual root block device gets mounted - there should be another entry for the real device e.g.\n$ mount | grep ' / '\n/dev/mapper/t60p-root on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n$ grep ' / ' /proc/mounts\nrootfs / rootfs rw 0 0\n/dev/mapper/t60p-root / ext4 rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,user_xattr,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are not understanding what \"rootfs\" means.\nIf you cat /proc/mounts, or filter the output with grep or awk, you do indeed get a list of all them mounts and the options as indicated by @steeldriver.\nThe first line, rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0 is not your root partition, it is used by the kernel.\n\nWhat is rootfs?\nRootfs is a special instance of ramfs (or tmpfs, if that's enabled), which is\n  always present in 2.6 systems.  You can't unmount rootfs for approximately the\n  same reason you can't kill the init process; rather than having special code\n  to check for and handle an empty list, it's smaller and simpler for the kernel\n  to just make sure certain lists can't become empty.\nMost systems just mount another filesystem over rootfs and ignore it.  The\n  amount of space an empty instance of ramfs takes up is tiny.\nIf CONFIG_TMPFS is enabled, rootfs will use tmpfs instead of ramfs by\n  default.  To force ramfs, add \"rootfstype=ramfs\" to the kernel command\n  line.\n\nSee https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt\nLook closer at the output, or filter the results with grep or awk\ngrep '/dev' /proc/mounts\n\n", "Q: How to installed ubuntu 12.04 lts alongside windows 7? .\nI am using windows 7 64 bit and want to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS alongside windows 7 \nPlease tell me how I can do that.\n\nA: So easy!\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows 7, 64 Bit, don't use the entire hard disk let us say from 500GB, make a new partition with the win7 installer's partition manager and choose the 250GB partition and install. Let the rest of it untouched, that will handle linux!\n\n*After installation of Windows7 had been done, take the ubuntu cd inside, make sure you have internet connectivity (best through router via DHCP) and put the linux cd inside. \n\n*Ubuntu will ask you questions like keyboard, language and at the certain point ubuntu will ask you to start the installation \"default\". \nI personally advise making the partition myself.\nOn a standard system (without EFI) you have 4 primary partitions... Windows reserved one primary partition so you still have 3 left. \n\n*create one primary partition for /boot with 1 GB, and one more for virtual partition. \nInside the virtual partition, you create partitions for linux folders!\nMost imporant are:\n/tmp (5GB)\n/opt (50GB)\n/usr/local (10 GB)\n/home (20GB)\nswap partition (doube the memory, but 8GB would do it fine, and more is not necessary)\n/ (the rest of space -> 250 - 93 = 157GB)\nduring the installation ubuntu will fetch the packages too.\nAfter the installation had been done, ubuntu writes the boot manager with grub    automaticly so that you can choose between win and linux which system you like to boot.\nDoes it have to be 12.04 ?!

Now this command went through and changed those two files in my directory, but I had to break it to stop since it went on. Now I'm afraid it has gone and changed the permissions on other files and folders, since it didn't terminate. \n\nA: By using {.,}*, you included both ./ and ../. Along with the -R option, your chown call was about to browse your entire filesystem (and others, possibly mounted), going through ../. With other commands, this little mistake can be quite deadly, but believe me, you're not the first, and you won't be the last...\nSince this operation is quite heavy, your chown call hanged a while, as it had a lot of files to process. I'd suggest you go back to the directory where you made the call, and go back progressively to / to see what changes were made. You might be able to apply a quick fix doing:\nchown root:root /* # Set ownership to root for all directories in /.\nchown you:yourgroup /home/you -R # Take your home back.\n\nOn Ubuntu, the /home directory is given to the first (admin/sudo) user registered on the system. If you're the only user, you might want to do:\nchown you:yourgroup /home -R\n\nHowever, a simple chmod 755 on /home is enough, even if it belongs to root.\nHaving a quick look directly at / (including the root permissions themselves, ls -ld /) would also be a nice place to start. I suggest you make sure that / belongs to root, with a 755 permissions set.\nIf you used chown to set a very specific ownership (a user other than you or root, a rare group, ...), you may want to use find to look for chown-ed files.\nfind / -user {username}\nfind / -group {groupname}\n\nUnfortunately, there is no such thing as undo for what your did. Linux doesn't naturally keep tracks of these \"casual\" operations.\nFor more information on what you were trying to achieve, have a look at this SuperUser question.\n", "Q: sshfs You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of mounted directory Hello I am pretty new to using sshfs and I can view my mounted directory when I use root under the terminal.

If anyone has any insight to this it would be greatly appreciated\nThanks.\n\nA: Don't be root, and don't use sudo -i when using SSH or sshfs.\nIt may be that you're not in the fuse group, and so you don't have the permissions to use FUSE mounting. Do sudo usermod -aG fuse username, where username is your username, to add yourself into the group. Then, log out and log back in, and use SSH and/or sshfs under your user account.\n", "Q: How to set primary monitor with AMD Catalyst Control Center installed when I run xrandr, I get a list of my connected monitors (which are DFP5 and DFP6)\nDFP5 is an HDMI connected TV which I want to be my secondary monitor as it is smaller,\nand DFP6 is a DVI connected monitor which I want to be my primary monitor as it is the bigger of the two.\nHowever, when I run xrandr --output DFP6 --primary Nothing happens, and the windows keep opening first of all on my smaller TV Monitor.\nI have also edited my ~/.config/monitors.xml file and set the primary tag to yes for my big monitor, and no for my small TV monitor, and it has not made a difference. \nI have the AMD catalyst control centre installed, and it is showing that my TV monitor is monitor 1 (and therefore primary), but I don't want it to be the primary, I want it to be secondary.\nIf you can help me get this sorted, I would greatly appreciate it, thanks!\nHere's a screenshot of amdcccle showing my monitor config.

No function to mount or whatsoever to do with that HDD.

First, pick a directory you want to mount it on (like /home/marius/internal, where marius is your username. Make sure the directory exists (make a new one if you need to). Then, do:\ncat <<EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\n/dev/sdb1 /home/marius/internal ntfs-3g rw,exec,uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -u),umask=022 0 0\nEOF\n\nThis will add an entry to /etc/fstab giving you proper read/write permissions.\nThen, do:\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1\n\nThe first command will undo the previous mount, then the second will mount it with the new settings.\n\nIf it is a new hard disk, you can format it afresh, and start using it. Open the Disks program, select your new hard disk from the right hand pane, click on the gear icon in the top right corner, and choose Format. \n\nUse the default option (both GPT and MBR work fine). Once it creates a new partition table, click on the +, choose a size. For the type, if you wish to use it on Windows as well, select \"Compatible with most systems (NTFS)\" instead of the default (ext4).  Give a nice label. Click on the play icon to mount it.

This passage, at the end, explains it:\n\nFor these reasons and others, including the Bitcoin software in any stable,\n  no-updates release is not a good thing for Ubuntu users nor for the bitcoin\n  network as a whole. There is already a PPA, maintained by Matt Corallo, one\n  of the core developers, and linked to from http://bitcoin.org/en/download.\n  Said PPA provides both the Bitcoin software and the BDB 4.8 packages needed\n  for wallet compatibility with the software on other platforms. Over at\n  Debian, their Bitcoin Packaging Team has been maintaining the package,\n  keeping it in the unstable branch (sid) only, where it is allowed to be\n  updated with new releases of the software. It is not included in the stable\n  repository (wheezy), nor in testing (jessie). If I understand correctly,\n  Ubuntu doesn't have that kind of release. It is my opinion that, given\n  Ubuntu's methods of managing its software, it would be better to not\n  include Bitcoin in the Ubuntu repositories, unless exceptions to the\n  policies could be made, allowing all supported Ubuntu versions to get the\n  latest updates as they come down from upstream. As a first step, the\n  Bitcoin software should be removed from Trusty's repositories, assuming no\n  exception can be made. Ideally, it would also be removed from the older\n  repositories (Precise, Quantal, Raring, Saucy) if it can't be updated,\n  though I'm told that's significantly harder from the perspective of the\n  standard workflows.\n\nThe PPA mentioned is https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoin.\nAs for cgminer and bfgminer, from what I understand, bitcoind is the daemon behind the Bitcoin wallet (and the CLI interface), and not a miner by itself. And cgminer is one of the more popular mining software out there.\n", "Q: Casio fx-9750GII calculator file transfer I've got a Casio fx-9750GII calculator, which has a USB connection. When I connect it to my computer the system does not mount it as a storage device.

You could try running this in WINE but this of course isn't an ideal solution since it's not a native application.\nAlternatively, there's a project written by Andreas Bertheussen called xfer9860. I found this didn't work out of the box with my CASIO fx-9860GII calculator - my understanding is that CASIO changed how the communication protocol worked with the \"GII\" calculators which causes the xfer9860 utility to not work with the newer calculator models since it was designed for a fx-9860G model.\nI searched around and found some forum posts with information on what parts of the code needed changing. After modifying the code given in the forum posts I was able to get the project to compile and transferring files in both directions worked without any issues.\nI have a fork of the original project on GitHub which includes the patch\nI talked about above. Whilst I've only tested this with a 9860GII calculator, I'm optimistic it will work with a 9750GII as long as you're not trying to transfer G1A files (add-in applications), since the 9750GII's software doesn't support running user-supplied add-in applications.\nIt's worth noting you can upgrade the 9750GII's firmware to the 9860GII's in some cases since the 9750 is essentially a 9860 with dumbed-down software and a lower price point (though this will void the warranty) so this might be a good idea if you don't have any luck at first with the transfer application.\n", "Q: My touch screen doesn't work on Xubuntu 14.04 I installed Xubuntu (14.04) on a Sam4s machine.

Sites can be whitelisted, so that the trackers only on those sites. Many settings are available in options panel (the URI for it is resource://firefox-at-ghostery-dot-com/ghostery/data/options.html), which allows the changing of various settings. Most of these settings are shown when you first add Ghostery, and can be used to set it up.\nA paranoid more effective appraoch to block everything is to disable GhostRank (sends data to Ghostery???), block all trackers and cookies (the ones needed for some sites to work can be unblocked easily later when needed), and enable 'Block new elements by default'.\nGhostery should also block things from using cookies - Flash/Silverlight cookies can also be removed if enabled in settings.\n???It is worth noting that Ghostery is supported by Evidon, a ad company that sells the data from GhostRank. Those that don't want this may want to make sure GhostRank is disabled\nNoScript Security Suite\n                                                                         \nThis is a much simpler, and in someways more effective addon, as it blocks JavaScript and other features unless told not to. This is a rather effective way to prevent ads and trackers from loading.\nThe problem with this addon is that it is so effective, many sites won't work unless it is told not to block them. This can be done by 'allowing' (or temporarily allowing for this session) the site's domain (and others it needs - e.g. askubuntu.com needs sstatic.net, stackexchange.com and ajax.googleapis.com). You can also set what to block in the Options:\n                       \nFor instance, @font-face is now used by many sites and can mostly be trusted, so that can be unblocked (it is blocked by default). Also Video/Audio need to be enabled if you want to watch HTMl5 videos, etc.\nN.B. I have found on systems the menu seems to open with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+S - handy if you can't be bothered to move the mouse.\nBoth of these addons work very well together, and can be used stop nearly every single annoying ad and tracker in site. Both also integrate fairly well into Firefox 30's new menu, meaning there are less icons to clutter the panel\n                                                                   \n                                                  Also note the stupidly large amount of trackers Ghostery is blocking...\nOther addons are also available, including Adblock Plus.\n", "Q: Weird behavior of Copyq top panel icon?

I have an acer aspire 7560 that on windows supported (through acer proprietary software) boosting the cpu from 1.9ghz to up to 2.5ghz for long periods of time so long as there was adequate cooling. On ubuntu, I get a top speed of 1.9ghz no matter what I do. I am not trying to overclock past what it is supposed to go, but basically how would I go about doing this? I have googled everywhere and everyone recommends using the bios and that if there isn't an option there it can't be done. I know it can, I know it can be done and still be stable on this computer, and I know that it is possible to do through simple software. My processor is an AMD Fusion A8-3520M quad-core 64 bit processor with integrated radeon graphics and 4gb of ram. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: [Update 2015]\nStarting with Linux 3.16:\n\n\n*\n\n*The value for bapm can be provided as a module parameter (see here).\n\n*The value of bapm is set to 1 by default for Kaveri, Kabini and desktop Trinity, Richland systems (see here), resulting in Turbo Core being enabled.\nWhich means that with Kernel 3.16 or later, Turbo Core should work right out of the box with radeon in many cases.\nIf you run Debian, or if you run Ubuntu and the above is not true for you, please refer to How to set up a Debian system (focus on 2D or console/server) with an AMD Turbo Core APU for maximum energy and computing efficiency?\n[Update 2014-Aug-07]\nI published a detailed analysis over at unix-stackexchange.com which contains (at least for me) a few surprises. Such as the ondemand governor potentially being worse than performance (at least with the Richland A10-6700) and fglrx apparently using some questionable tricks to improve short-term boosts, abruptly having to compensate for that in the long run. I'm glad I had a closer look at this.\n[Original Answer]\nAMD Turbo Core is supposed to be enabled by default in all current Linux versions.\nTurbo Core, however, is a feature available on AMD CPUs with and without integrated GPU. And there seem to be two issues regarding those with an integrated GPU. Your A8 falls into this category.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the kernel does not have the ATI/AMD 'fglrx' module loaded, the APUs appear to stick to the non-boost/regular frequencies. I presume that the reason is that Turbo Core is a decision made by the APU itself, based on several criteria such as power dissipation/TDP. It seems that the GPU on the chip will not contribute to the decision unless it gets initialised properly. And properly here means that you must use the official dirver; not even the free radeonwill do the trick. I have filed a bug report over at kernel.org but the question remains whether it will be easy to have the kernel initialise the GPU just for the sake of the boost (if my assumption about the root cause is correct).\n\n*However, even with fglrx, there appears to be a bug if you intend to use Dynamic Power Management.\n\n\nFor a bit more of explanation e.g. about which tools correctly identify boosts, see here.\n", "Q: Using unattended-upgrades or cron for automatically updating packages from different sources? I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 + XBMC on a HTPC and now I want to setup automatic updates on this machine.\nOn top of the normal Ubuntu sources, I have also 3 other sources installed, of which I want to receive automatic updates:\n1) The XBMC ppa (http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu/)\n2) The Steam source (http://repo.steampowered.com precise/steam)\n3) The Flirc source (http://apt.flirc.tv binary/)\nI have already read about the unattended-upgrades package, but I don't know how to modify this package to also download updates for XBMC, Steam & Flirc (I've read something about reading the lists file in /var/lib/apt/lists, but unfortunately, I couldn't find Source and Origin defined in these lists).\nOr is it better for me to go the cron route for this?\n\nA: In case you can't find the Release file in /var/lib/apt/lists even after sudo apt-get upgrade, you can take a look at the file at the repository itself. In this case, they are:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release for XBMC\n\n*http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/dists/precise/Release for Steam and\n\n*Unfortunately, the Flirc repository doesn't do directory listing, so I can't locate it without more information.\n\n\nThe Origin values are present for both XBMC and Steam (LP-PPA-team-xbmc and Valve Software LLC respectively). The Suite in this case would be which ever folder under the dists section of the repository you are using (http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/dists or http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu/dists) - should be precise for for Steam and and trusty for XBMC PPA.\n", "Q: Is the command `sudo rm /Desktop/filename` safe? Is this safe to use?\nsudo rm /Desktop/FILENAME\n\nThe reason for wanting to use sudo is I can't see the file.\nI accidentally typed in sudo rm /Desktop/index.html.  It didn't find it but could something still have been deleted?\n\nA: Use ~/Desktop as the path as /Desktop does not exist, the former is the path to your desktop. If it is a single file using sudo rm ~/Desktop/filename is absolutely fine. Just make ABSOLUTELY SURE you want to delete the file, if it is in your desktop folder and has sudo permissions, ask yourself if it needs to be deleted and if it does, whether you need to make a copy.\n\nA: \"Safe\" is an interesting description for anything with sudo. Doing sudo rm /Desktop/filename will only be \"safe\" if you wish to delete filename. It will not delete /Desktop. Be careful though. I think you mean to use sudo rm Desktop/filename. This will delete filename under Desktop from the directory you are currently in. By default there is no Desktop in your root (/) drectory. Doing sudo rm Desktop will even not delete Desktop since it is a directory. If you wish to remove a directory, do sudo rm -r Desktop. So in a sense, yes, that would be safe. You may not need to use sudo in the first place if it is a file you own (or can access). Be careful with sudo.\n\nA: No. It most emphatically is not safe. Here's the thing: You can delete files you own without sudo. If you don't own the file, and you are here asking this question, then you need to ask yourself: \"Do I need to delete this file?\"\nOveruse and consequent misuse of sudo is one of the banes of Ubuntu.\n\nA: The slash at the start of /Desktop would have caused it to look for a Desktop folder in the root of the filesystem, which almost certainly does not exist, therefore nothing would have been deleted.\nIn future, keep in mind that both sudo and rm have the ability to be dangerous.  You should never need sudo just to manipulate your own files, and if you do need sudo to delete a file, it's generally a file you shouldn't be deleting unless you know what you're doing (there are exceptions, for example it's safe to modify/delete whatever you want in /var/www or /srv, etc if you run a server, or /usr/local if you compile and install your own software, but that's more advanced than general use).\nAs for rm, well it doesn't move things into a \"Trash\" bin for you, so in that sense it's not all that safe, in that it's easy to irrecoverably lose something.\nIt sounds most likely you were looking in the wrong place, right?  index.html isn't a hidden file (hidden files begin with a dot) so you should be able to see it in your file browser.\n\nA: Never use sudo rm and an absolute url or wildcard if you can help it.  \nOne day you'll have a typo and hate yourself.\n\nA: The 'rm' command, with or without sudo, is completely safe if you know what you are doing and are careful.  If you delete something by accident, it is irrecoverable.  (Not entirely true, deleted files sometimes can be retrieved, but I would not rely on it.)\nAs long as you run exactly that command and that is the file you mean to delete, it is safe.  If you use rm (even without root) and you get something wrong (usually with the * wildcard) you could delete all your files. (Of course, you do regular backups, right?)\nThe real question is why you have a /Desktop folder.  You probably mean ~/Desktop.\nAnyway, the command is safe.  commands like sudo and rm are not inherently dangerous, they just allow you to do stupid things if you type a command wrong.  Also, on a single user system, rm is about as dangerous even without sudo, since you probably care more about your personal files than system files.\n\nA: About your inability to see the file, maybe it's because the filename begins with a '.' and hence is treated as a hidden file. In Ubuntu, you can go Ctrl+h to show hidden files. In the terminal you can type\nls -a\n\nto show hidden files.\nAs for the issues with 'sudo' listed above, they are right. Be careful with it. It's better to just delete it, or make it so that you can delete it (chmod/chown) and then just delete it normally. Better safe than sorry :)\n", "Q: Unity command runner I'm searching for command runner for Unity. I known that there is default runner under shortcut ALT + F2.

Once upon a time (2008 - ????) Ubuntu had a Hall of Fame page (then located at http://hall-of-fame.ubuntu.com) in which it would give credits to contributors such as developers who patched a bug in the One Hundred Papercuts project or the top weekly contributors right here on Ask Ubuntu. You can see Jono Bacon's blog post about it here.\nSome time since the last contribution to its Launchpad repository in 2011 and now it was removed from the website completely (DNS record for hall-of-fame.ubuntu.com removed). Extensive Googling has yielded no answers in any form. The the last snapshot of the site by web.archive.org reveals no clues, either (it looks perfectly normal, and then there are no more snapshots).\nSo I'm curious- why was it removed?\n\nA: Ubuntu Hall of Fame has been unmaintained since 2011 and was planned to be rewritten entirely. While the plan seems to have been approved, the blueprint on Launchpad had noted that implementation is making slow progress.\nThe plan and progress\nAccording to this dated Wiki, the codebase of Ubuntu Hall of Fame is not maintainable and the plan was to make it open source.\n\nThe codebase of the Hall of Fame is not open-source right now and is not really maitainable, also does it contain password and all kinds of other horrible things. The only good thing about it is the theming.\nThe plan is to rewrite it in Django and make it more easily extensible and modifiable. Also make it open source.\n\nGiven that the Wiki was created in mid-2010, the project may have been left unmaintained much earlier than the last snapshot in 2011 on Internet Archive Wayback Machine.\nIn early 2011, the blueprint was registered in Ubuntu Launchpad. While some features have already been implemented, most of the work items are noted as \"postponed\".\nSupporting facts\nIn mid-2011, one Ubuntu member has published a blog post on \"UDS-O Budapest: Day 5\", which mentioned the state of Ubuntu Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Ubuntu Hall of Fame is a site hosted by Canonical but largely unmaintainable, and thus, unmaintained. They are working to moving it to Django and in this session they re-identified the current blockers and a new project lead took the helm [...]\n\nFinally in late-2011, the designer of Ubuntu Hall of Fame has mentioned about the project on his blog in this post that is part of discussing the findings in the \"Ubuntu Community Survey Report\".\n\n[...] Some will remember when we built the Ubuntu Hall Of Fame; this project was designed to highlight many of the great contributions to Ubuntu, but it had two unintended side effects:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*It didn’t really achieve the goal of a community feeling a personal sense of thanks from someone who benefited from their contribution.\n  \n*For those who did not make it to one of the Top 10 lists on the site, some felt like their contributions were not as valuable or appreciated.\n\nSo what happened and why\nThe reason Ubuntu Hall of Fame was being removed, is largely due to lack of maintenance. However, the last quoted source may suggest that the project implementation may have been improperly done for recognizing contributors' works. More relevant sources as follows.\nFrom this dated Wiki on UDS Jaunty report (partially quoted):\n\nDebian / Ubuntu Relations\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*...\n  \n*Why aren't Debian contributors on the Ubuntu Hall of Fame? \n  \n*...\n  \n\nFrom the first post, a comment raised by one of the readers:\n\n...on November 21, 2008 at 3:29 am \n[...] see comment 3… how would you go about extending this to appropriately give credit to Debian contributors? Would the entirely of Debian’s community process have to be driven through Launchpad to be recorded for the HOF to list? Debian is just one of many upstream groups whose effort can’t be represented by a shallow dive into Launchpad’s data pool [...]\n\nFrom the later post, another comment raised by one of the readers:\n\n...on October 26, 2011 at 4:12 pm \n[...] Singling out top contributors is exactly what Jono wants to avoid [...] What’s needed is a recognition framework that has the ability to scale beyond launchpad as a data source beyond Canonical as a source of windfall and beyond Ubuntu in scope [...]\n\nFrom this related post on Community Leadership Forum:\n\n[...] One thing I discovered years back when we ran the Ubuntu Hall Of Fame project (we aggregated the top performers in the community) is that the social recognition of some was seen as ignoring others. It ended up become rather demotivating for some.\n\nBased on above findings, we may understand why Ubuntu Hall of Fame was being removed and has been making slow progress for the past few years.\nDisclaimer: This answer was written based on information that were found via Google Search, Internet Archive and few other sites.

The solution is to disable Fast Startup in Windows. Note that the Windows Fast Startup feature is entirely separate from a feature that probably has a similar name in the firmware.

I got this error you got too, and I have secure boot and fast boot enabled in my BIOS/UEFI settings. My fix was to simply use gparted to delete that 100 MB partition and then when I did the Ubuntu 18 install I chose \"Something else\" and at that point dedicated the 100 MB partition for the UEFI boot stuff. It then formatted it for me and it worked!\nSummary for me: don't have it pre-formatted as ext4. Instead, leave the empty 100 MB or so there for the UEFI boot partition, but let the Ubuntu installer partition and format it.\nFor all other partitions it was ok to have manually done them before-hand via gparted, and I did not have to turn off fast boot or secure boot in the BIOS/UEFI settings. Note, however, that I do NOT have Windows installed on this machine: it is Ubuntu 18 only.\n\nA: In the 'try ubuntu' desktop, open the command line and run the command :\nsudo mkfs.vfat /dev/X where X is the name of the efi partition.\nYou can get the name of the partition using: sudo fdisk -l (the word 'efi' appears before the partition name).\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem today while installing Ubuntu Server on a UEFI machine. I received the following message:\nThe attempt to mount a file system with type vfat in SCSI1 (0,0,0), partition #2 (sda) at /boot/efi failed.\n\nI created an EFI partition and a normal linux partition on a USB disk with the gdisk command. fdisk -l gave the following result for the disk:\nDevice       Start     End Sectors  Size Type\n/dev/sdc1     2048 1050623 1048576  512M EFI System\n/dev/sdc2  1050624 7831518 6780895  3.2G Linux filesystem\n\nI then tried to mount the EFI partition with mount /dev/sdc1 /test/, but got the following response:\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdc1,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail or so.\n\nI also tried mount -t vfat /dev/sdc1 /test/, but received the same response. I then formatted the EFI partition with mkfs.vfat /dev/sdc1. I then tried to mount the EFI partition again with mount /dev/sdc1 /test/. It worked perfectly.\nMy conclusion is therefore that the Ubuntu Server installer needs the EFI partition to be formatted when it tries to mount it to /boot/efi.\n\nA: I reformatted my main partition as ext4.\nWent into terminal with ctrl alt f1\nThen formatted the partition \nsudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda2\n\n\nA: Building on Arian S's answer:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Try Ubuntu Live.\n\n*Go to GParted with Live Ubuntu.\n\n*Delete all partitions and click Apply.\n\n*Close GParted, and click the Install Ubuntu icon on your desktop.\n\nThe above did the trick for me.\n\nA: it sounds like you are getting a read error on either the hard disk or the cd, if you are confident the hard drive is fine then you can try burning another dvd and if that does not work it means you probably have a bad hard disk. If you can rule out either of those please report the bug on launchpad\n\nA: This happens apparently because the alternative server installer doesn't try to format the EFI partition for you.  If you go BACK a couple times, then look at the bottom of the list of install actions you can drop to command line.  Do so.\nCheck that your device is the one you think it is (mine was /Dev/sda1 for EFI and /Dev/sda2 for data).  You can test mounting them in empty folders with:\nmkdir test\nmount /dev/sda1 test\nls -al test\numount test\nThe broken one won't mount at all.  Fix it with:\nmkfs.fat16 /dev/sdX1       (substitute proper device here)\nThen type 'exit' and continue the install.\n\nA: the solution is very simple..\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to GPARTED with Live Ubuntu.\n\n*Look at Your Partition on Your USB Drive.\n\n*There must be EXT 4 on some part on Your Partition.\n\n*Format that part into FAT 32.\n\n*Close the GPARTED, and Click Install Ubuntu icon on Your desktop.\n-PROBLEM SOLVED. \n\nA: In my case not selecting LVM just worked\n\nA: All above solutions cannot solve the same problem to me.\nFinally I have found that the HDD disk (machine contains two disks: Sata and HDD) is still remaining files of Windows OS. So I suspect it is the raeson of warning accurance. And then I use the command dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX  bs=512  count=1 (X means the given letter represents HDD) to clean the data.\nAt last I follow the Zana's answer using mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1 to format efi partition, it eventually worked.\n\nA: Here's what worked for me (with much thanks to all the other answers):\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a live USB Linux session, such as the \"Try Ubuntu\" option that comes with the Linux installation package.  I used Boot-Repair-Disk live USB.\n\n\n*Open a utility such as Gparted, KDE Partition Manager, or other partition manager.  I used Gparted.\n\n\n*Identify the EFI boot partition.  On my computer this partition was named dev/sda1, it was 100MB, and it was NTFS.  It was labeled \"System Reserved\" and flagged \"boot,esp\"\n\n\n*Use partition manager to reformat the efi boot partition to a Fat 16 or 32 system and set flags to \"boot,esp\".\n\n\n*Shut off computer.\n\n\n*Install Ubuntu no problem.\n", "Q: BitTorrent programs killing networking - Broadcom wireless This started happening after I did a fresh install of 14.04 (previously I was on 13.04). When ever I launch a BitTorrent client my DNS very quickly stops responding, and then the network connection itself stops working completely (to the point of disconnecting and failing to see the network again).\nIt works just fine on my wired connection, but with wireless (which is a Broadcom; I followed the steps here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2218898 to get it working) then it craps out.\nEdit: I have verified that I have the correct drivers installed.

The easy solution is to reduce the number of maximum connections your bittorrent software uses in the software itself.  Try various numbers but less than 400 is a reasonable number that should work - as a troubleshooting measure you can try less than 128 in a pinch but that may hurt download speed.\n(Good routers allow ~4000 or more simultaneous connections, often ~16000 or more, bad/cheap routers may limit to ~500 or even ~128 in extreme cases - and that is shared by all users of your network, even cellphones on your wifi).\nThat said, the multiple connections that a bittorrent client uses should not put stress on a DNS server.  It is possible that the DNS problems you are experiencing may just be a side effect of problems with your router handling that many connections, in which case this isn't a DNS issue but DNS problems is just a symptom.  For example, DNS uses a connectionless protocol and such protocols suffer when there is packet loss, which may occur in a router that is overloaded in other ways.\nAnother strange issue is that you say it works fine over a wired connection but not wireless.  If they are going through the same router either way (eg. the access point and the router is the same device, or if it's a separate access point it has NAT disabled / doesn't use the WAN port) then it should work the same.  Have you done any other testing to see whether there are general problems with wifi on that same PC?\n", "Q: External HDD working on Ubuntu Live CD but not Ubuntu server I have an external USB 3.0 drive that works when plugged into a Windows 8 machine and when running an Ubuntu live CD.

I have it hooked up to 2 Dell P2815Q (4K), 1 Dell U2713HM (2560x1440) and one Dell E2414Hr (1920x1080) on ubuntu 12.04.  I have the two P2815Q daisy chained on DP, the U2713HM on the DVI-D and the E2414Hr on the DVI-I.  For now, you cannot daisy chain with the open source drivers, but I did manage to get it working with the AMD catalyst driver.  It is not easy and, if you try to boot with all 4 monitors connected, not all of them will work.  I have found this sequence to work most of the time: boot and login with only the two displayport 4K monitors hooked up, then plug in the other two.  Also, this messes up compwiz a little so you may need to mess around with virtual desktops and viewports, and you need to reset any background as it goes black.\nDavid Airlie is working on some MST support (see other questions in this forum) and it is supposed to come in kernel 3.17.  I recently tried 3.17 r7, but it either isn't working, or doesn't work with AMD.  That kernel will not be in ubuntu for a while, so you're best to work with the catalyst drivers for now.\nNote: the daisy chain could support the U2713HM (on the end of the chain) too as it has DP imput but, because the two P2815Q need a lot of bandwidth, Displayport 1.2 bandwidth then limits to only two of them working at once.  Displayport 1.3 will increase bandwidth and may allow it to work.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall a click package?

I have been having problems left and right, but I finally ran into one that I can't figure out.\nI put Ubuntu on a USB drive using UNetbootIn and booted (in CSM Mode - UEFI didn't work) into the live session. I ran the installer, which failed. I traced the problem to the hard drive, which had a magnet dropped on it over a year ago, and I reformatted it the long way. I ran the installer again, successfully. Then, I shut down, removed the USB drive, and started my computer (boot sequence: USB, HDD, ...) - and my computer tells me there is no bootable device. I force shut down my computer and reinserted the USB, booted into the live session, and ran Boot Repair. Still can't boot from the HDD.\nComing from a Windows background, I'm a newbie to all things Linux. I don't know what is causing my problem (the hard drive??), and don't know what to look for to help me find out.\nComputer: 64 bit Toshiba Satellite C855D Laptop - came with Windows 8 preinstalled, but I removed that hard drive and put in the 500 GB one.\nHard Drive: 500 GB Toshiba MK5065GSX\nBoot Repair URL (Maybe irrelevant - can't hurt): http://paste.ubuntu.com/7847577\nI took a look at this page (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI) and thought that maybe my installation would work if I converted it to EFI mode (Ubuntu was installed in CSM Mode, because if I tried in UEFI mode, all I got after selecting an option on the boot menu was a blank/black screen). Would that make a difference? If so, how would I go about it? The page says I need to create an EFI partition, which I don't know how to do, and the requirements of mount point and flag mean nothing to me.\nSo, the short version of my question: Why won't my hard drive boot?\nUpdate: I looked through the folders on my hard drive, and found that the \"boot\" and \"sys\" folders were empty! Like I said above, I am new to Linux/Ubuntu, but I assume that these folders are important. I ran the installer again, and now the \"boot\" folder has some stuff in it (grub folder and a few other files), but the \"sys\" folder is still empty. I think this is part if not all of my problem; what should I do about it?\n\nA: Begin by going into your firmware setup utility. You typically do this by hitting Esc or a function key soon after turning on the computer (before GRUB or any Ubuntu boot messages appear). Unfortunately, details vary from one computer to another. Look for options related to boot mode and boot order. They're usually present on a page called \"Boot.\" Ensure that BIOS/CSM/legacy support is enabled and ensure that the option to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode from your hard disk is listed first in the boot order (or perhaps just after an option to boot from a CD-R or external USB drives generically). As with entering the firmware setup utility, the details vary greatly from one computer to another, so I can't be more precise about what you need to do.\nIf that doesn't work, you may need to try an EFI-mode installation. To do this, disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support in your firmware and boot your Ubuntu medium again. The \"black screen\" problem you encountered is common, but there are multiple causes and cures, so it's difficult to offer advice on this; but there are many questions and answers about it on this site, so start by browsing them. Don't worry too much about the EFI System Partition (ESP); the Ubuntu installer will create it automatically, unless you choose to partition manually.\n\nA: Someone else may have a better answer, but do you know if the cmos battery is good?  I recently had a similar problem.  My cmos battery died, corrupted my bios and corrupted my boot files.

On my previous Dell XPS 17, the touchpad had excellent response even when moving my finger slightly -- by moving my finger a very short distance, I was able to move the mouse a pixel at a time, which was very helpful for, e.g., grabbing narrow window borders.

@MichaelTingley, but in my case they were set to 28. Setting them to zero removed the need to move the finger a little before the mouse actually moves.\nThese settings can be set permanently by adding this to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"touchpad\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    Option \"HorizHysteresis\" \"0\"\n    Option \"VertHysteresis\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\nAnd thanks to the thorough answer of @Inactivist which pointed me in the right direction.\n\nA: My Lenovo t540p exhibited the same symptoms with the default acceleration profile = 1 (device dependent).\nThis appears to be related to XOrg's pointer acceleration and related \"acceleration profile\".  If you set the device acceleration profile to -1 (none), the dead spot symptom seems to disappear though the mouse cursor moves very small distances on the display, making it very precise but fairly useless.\nI switched to a linear device acceleration profile (AccelerationProfile 6) and saw immediate improvement.  The initial movement hesitation is still there but the cursor doesn't jump as it did previously.\nFurther research into the cause of the 'dead spot' is warranted, but it may be due to firmware behavior.  The synaptics man page mentions firmware noise cancellation that may be difficult or impossible to control at present:\n\nNoise cancellation\nThe synaptics has a built-in noise cancellation based on hysteresis. This means that incoming coordinates actually shift a box of predefined dimensions such that it covers the incoming coordinate, and only the boxes own center is used as input. Obviously, the smaller the box the better, but the likelyhood of noise motion coming through also increases.\n\nTweaking the acceleration profile and related config\nHere's a script I use to tweak settings on my system:\n#!/bin/bash\nDEVICE=\"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\"\nxinput --set-prop \"$DEVICE\" \"Device Accel Profile\" 6\nxinput --set-prop \"$DEVICE\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 12\nxinput --set-prop \"$DEVICE\" \"Device Accel Velocity Scaling\" 20\n\nOnce you find settings you like, you may choose to add them to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/51-synaptics-quirks.conf file (copied from /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d) or create a new, separate .conf file there with a name like 99-your-config-file-name.conf.\nOption \"AccelerationProfile\" \"6\"\n# May want to set \"ConstantDeceleration\" and \"VelocityScale\" or other \n# values here as well\n\n", "Q: Illustrator cc file in ubuntu?

It was due to the fact that the machine goes into 'deep-sleep' mode after exactly 3 hours.\nAnd while it had done this sometimes, for which I was glad, it sometimes somehow did not manage to 'deep-sleep' correctly.\nI disabled this function entirely in the BIOS, and initial empirical analysis shows that it works :)\nQuote from http://forums.lenovo.com:\n\nAs for the Intel hibernation scheme, as you noted, it requires a\n  dedicated partition on your SSD that can't be used for any other\n  purpose.  The only setting in Windows is inside the Lenovo Settings\n  application, in the Power section.  Lenovo calls this feature \"30 day\n  standby\".  The only thing you can do is turn it on or off.  Here's how\n  \"30 day standby\" works:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*when you close the lid or otherwise put the system into sleep mode, the system sleeps for 3 hours.\n  \n*after 3 hours, the system will wake and check some things, such as AC not attached, wake-on-LAN not enabled, USB device not attached,\n  etc.  If the conditions allow, then the system will enter the 30-day\n  standby state e.g. deep sleep.  Otherwise the system goes back into\n  normal sleep mode.\n  \n*Deep sleep means that the contents of memory are written to the special hibernation partition on the SSD.  it is very similar to\n  traditional hibernation except that it happens faster by using BIOS\n  methods instead of Windows methods.  But it's not anywhere near as\n  fast as normal sleep/resume.\n  \n*The system comes out of deep sleep mode when the lid is opened, or when the power button is pressed.\nYou found the BIOS settings but actually they are ignored whenever\n  Lenovo Settings (and Lenovo Settings Dependency Package) are installed\n  on the system.  I really don't know why this design choice was made.\nPersonally I don't see value in 30 day standby, at least not enough\n  value to want to give up 8GB of my expensive SSD.  I use sleep/resume\n  exclusively.  The battery will last several days.  And if I'm going to\n  be away from the computer for an extended time then I'll just shut it\n  down.\n\n\nA: I see this in my pm_suspend.log:\nRunning hook /etc/pm/sleep.d/10_unattended-upgrades-hibernate resume suspend:\n/etc/pm/sleep.d/10_unattended-upgrades-hibernate resume suspend: success.\nThis is very uncool. My Windows machine used to wake up on me by itself and I could never figure out why. It used to drive me crazy as I searched the culprit. Found it very unconfigurable and annoying.\nOn Ubuntu, please make this a very visible and easy to configure option. I was a bit mystified when I saw that my computer had woken up without my permission. \nWas about to give it 30 lashes with a wet noodle, when I saw that it was most likely due to this 'unattended-upgrades' gremlin.\nIn the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic , \nI first tried setting just APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade from \"1\" to \"0\". Then, within a day, my computer woke up by itself.\nSo, then I tried setting all four values in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic to \"0\"\n\n\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"0\";\nAPT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages \"0\";\nAPT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval \"0\";\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"0\";\n\n\nSo far, it's been a couple days and I haven't experienced any spontaneous wakeups by my computer. \nGino\n", "Q: Windows 8 and Ubuntu Dual Boot Issues I know tons of people have issues dual booting Linux with Windows 8 machines because of all the UEFI garbage.

I was finally able to run boot-repair using this:\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nI get a warning about UEFI being turned on (after I've done everything I know how to make sure it's disabled) and then the boot repair errors out. Here's the message it generates:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/7852448/\nI noticed I can boot to Ubuntu if I stop the normal boot process and select ubuntu from the boot menu but that's the best I have.\nI also tried running this command from Windows:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nI'm dying here. Any help you guys can provide would be superb. Thanks!\n\nA: Try with Boot Repair you can get it from here - http://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/files/ install it on CD/DVD/USB boot from it and when it ask you for 32/64-bit session chose 32-bit if your PC is 32-bit if it is 64-bit chose 64-bit, then if it ask you for updates click No, then when it finish with scanning click Recommended repair\n\nA: Based on your Boot Repair output, and in particular the efibootmgr output it shows, it should be working now. (One caveat: There's no evidence of any EFI boot loaders on your ESP; but the fact that Windows is booting means that this must be a Boot Repair omission, so I'm discounting that evidence.) The fact that it's not working strongly suggests you've got a badly broken firmware. Your earlier question states that you've got an HP laptop, and many HPs are known to have such badly-broken EFIs. My first suggestion is therefore to check with HP to see if there's a firmware update. If there is, apply it and try again with the bcdedit command in Windows; that's the most likely to work.\nAlso, note that specifying grubx64.efi with bcdedit is appropriate if you've disabled Secure Boot. If Secure Boot is active, you must specify shimx64.efi, not grubx64.efi. Specifying shimx64.efi will work if Secure Boot is inactive, too, provided the file is installed, as it normally is even on non-Secure-Boot systems.\nOne more point: If you haven't already done so, you must disable the Windows Fast Startup feature, as described here (among other places). If that feature is left enabled, it can result in file corruption on shared partitions, including the ESP where your boot loaders reside. This may be why Boot Repair didn't detect any boot loaders on the ESP, and it's conceivable that it's contributing to your problems.\nIf following this advice doesn't work, then you have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sell your laptop to somebody who wants to run nothing but Windows and use the money to buy something that's not broken. At this point in time, this is my first recommendation; manufacturers have had more than enough time to fix their broken EFIs, and the fact that many haven't is a sign of disrespect to you, their customer. Some, like ASUS and Lenovo, have EFIs that are more likely to work. Newer models are also more likely to work than older ones.\n\n*Rename your Ubuntu boot loader (EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi or EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi on the ESP; or you can rename another EFI boot loader appropriately) to take the place of Microsoft's boot loader (EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi) and adjust your boot loader configuration. This is tricky to do by hand with GRUB, but there is an option in Boot Repair to do the job. It's among the Advanced options and it's called something like \"back up and replace EFI boot loader files.\" (I don't recall the precise wording.) This was the default a year or two ago, but it's overkill in most cases and can cause a host of new problems on computers with non-broken EFIs, so it's no longer the default. You may need to use it and live with the consequences, or install some other boot loader in this way.\n\n\nA: Okay, believe it or not I fixed it. I re-ran boot-repair several times until it actually worked... There's a few lines that boot-repair has you copy and paste and one of those lines was failing. I separated the commands into individual lines rather than strung together and it errored out less... and then Grub loaded just fine...\nThanks for all the help!\n\nA: Here are the key steps and information bits to get an HP laptop to dual boot between Windows 8/8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04.02.  This laptop is a pretty modern Pavilion g7-2215dx.\n\n\n*\n\n*The BIOS of this laptop (and probably most modern HP laptops) has a UEFI boot menu that you can access by pressing ESC and then F9 when that menu shows up.  This menu DOES PROPERLY WORK if the stanzas are properly setup in the EFI partition and the disk is properly laid out.  (ie: if you have allowed Ubuntu to load the correct changes to the EFI partition, or if you have run boot-repair, and if the partition is in the right place)  Unfortunately, the Ubuntu installer ASSUMES that if UEFI is present that the system has a single Windows partition and no boot menu.  The reality is that these HP machines have a hidden recovery partition that is listed in the UEFI boot store and the reason the Windows boot menu does not appear is that HP factory-set the timeout on the boot menu to 0.  (cheap trick)  The Ubuntu installer doesn't appear to understand multi-boot configs that already exist so it does not properly create the entries.\n\n*This BIOS shortcuts to {bootmgr} on boot instead of {fwbootmgr}.  However, the F9 command DOES properly go to {fwbootmgr}  This is why the common hack of modifying {bootmgr} works.\n\n*HP did put the keys that allow the secure grub bootloader to work into the BIOS so it is possible to leave secure boot turned on and install Ubuntu.  Unfortunately, due to a bug in grub you cannot leave secure boot on and dual boot, because in secure boot mode when grub transfers control to the Windows boot loader, that loader's keys don't appear to match.  You can leave secure boot on and install only Ubuntu.  OR you can leave secure boot on and use the F9 key to manually select grub or Windows and forget about getting it to boot directly into grub.\n\n*You must NOT allow Ubuntu's default installer to install grub to /dev/sda.  It must install the bootloader to /dev/sda2  (or whatever the EFI partition is)  It is also probably a good idea to create logical partitions not primary partitions for the Ubuntu install.\n\n*Another key is that if you change the boot priority of anything, it will interfere with the booting.  Meaning if before installation you change the BIOS to boot off a USB key or off a CDROM then install, when Ubuntu is creating the UEFI entries it will do so based on that boot order. If you finish installation then change BIOS to boot off the hard disk, it messes things up. When you make changes in the BIOS boot order, the BIOS makes changes in the UEFI boot store on the EFI partition. These changes are generally incorrect.\n\n*After you finish installing Ubuntu and the laptop reboots into Windows, go into an admin command prompt and run the commands:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\Ubuntu\\shimx64.efi  \nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu no  \n\n\n*EasyBCD 2.2 is broken with the EFI partition on these machines - the author or EasyBCD apparently did not have one of these machines to test and his software makes some incorrect assumptions, and it cannot properly interpret the UEFI store on the EFI partition.  I have completely scotched a dual boot disk multiple times with this utility, during testing.  I DO NOT recommend using it under ANY circumstances!!!  Also, note that the Windows Recovery DVDs will NOT fix dual boot UEFI systems if the EFI partition gets scotched - you will have to reformat - they DO NOT touch that partition!!!!  I don't even think Windows Backup does.  A block backup utility might like Macrium Reflect.\n\n*The best tool so far to muck around with the EFI partition I have found is bcdedit under Windows.  Run bcdedit /? and bcdedit /enum ALL /v and bcdedit /enum /? and so on - basically run /? off of all the options of bcdedit and you will learn a great deal about how booting works.\n\n*If you load a Windows upgrade later (ie: going from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1) the newer Windows installer will muck around with EFI and disable dual-boot again.  You may not be able to get dual boot back.  One error I got after doing this was from boot-repair that said that grub was too far away from the beginning of the disk.  Apparently the Windows 8.1 update moved the EFI partition.  I was never able to get that machine to boot into grub until I reformatted it.\n\n*These machines have \"smart\" BIOSes - how are they smart?  They are smart because they read the EFI store, try to execute the boot menu, and if that fails they are hard coded to boot Windows.  So the upshot is if you make a mistake in the EFI store you won't get a useful error message (like it can't find an incorrectly named file or something) it will just boot into Windows.  They are designed to reduce support calls from users who screw up their PC.  And, if they detect what they think is an incorrect entry in the EFI store they will sometimes just wipe it out and replace it with what they think is a correct entry during POST.\nIncidentally, the factory recovery DVDs may NOT give you a chance to partition up your disk all nice and pretty for dual boot.  They generally hard-code the partition locations.\nIn summary, the EFI partition is a huge advancement over prior booting schemes and it will be used going forward so you better get used to it, and learn about it.  The HP machines all have HP recovery partitions and Windows recovery partitions that are accessed with various combinations of F keys and selections from Windows 8 and later, this is part of Microsoft's \"Zero installation media\" initiative where they are trying to get all PC manufacturers to NOT supply recovery CDs with their machines.  (mainly as an anti-piracy measure)  These bootable partitions are all properly setup in the EFI partition and the problem is that the BIOSs of machines are all taking different approaches to reading EFI, and many of the utility programs (like EasyBCD, and the Ubuntu installer itself, and the HP BIOS) do not properly interpret multi-boot setups in EFI and when they make changes they muck things up.  You can, however, usually fix things with bcdedit under Windows, but you must understand EFI so do the reading needed.\n", "Q: Problem unistalling ubuntu 13.10 from bootloader(windows 8) I installed ubuntu 13.10 on my usb.

So, as far as I know, you cannot do it in an easy way.\nIn spite of that there is a simple workaround, consisting in making realize your text editor what kind of file is opening. For example, let's say that your grep output have some bash components, so the bash highlights works for you (by the way, these are often the colors that you see in a colored output in the terminal). So the trick is to save the text output in a file with the proper extension. Instead of doing something like:\nls | grep something > output\n\nyou may go for\nls | grep something > output.sh\n\nWhich will make gedit (or any decent text editor) automatically recognize that you're talking about bash code, and will highlight it accordingly. You don't need to color the output, the program will do it for you if it recognizes the type of code that it's opening. If you are working with other type of formats, just adapt the extension to that adjusting better for what you are greping on (e.g.  > output.xml,   > output.html ,   > output.py ...etc).\nGood luck! :)\nHighlighting the some words in the output file\nSo, if I got it, you want to highlight the words you searched for. Again, that cannot be done in a plain text file just because is a plain text. However you can add some format to it in a very easy way such as using some html coding. This will transform your output in an html code, and when you open it with a program able to interpret html (libreoffice writer, firefox, and 10000 etceteras) you will see some words highlited.\nTo do so, let's say this is your grep, exported to html:\nls | grep keytext > output.html\n\nAnd now you want to highlight keytext in your output. You can use sed to do it, like:\nsed -i 's/keytext/<font color=\"red\">keytext<\\/font>/g' output.html\n\nAnd violà, now your keytext is highlited in red.\n\nA: Depending on what you're wanting to do with the output file, it's possible to add colors to a normal text file because the colors simply come from some special characters. Grep seems to not want to print them when you redirect it to a file, so you need to force it to:\ngrep --color=always \"stuff\" input.txt > output.txt\n\nNow, when you print the file to the console it will be printed with the colors, because Bash interprets those characters as \"use this color\".\ncat output.txt\n\nHowever, if you open it in an editor like vim, you'll get some strange characters. For example, when I use the commands\necho \"A sentence. A red sentence. Another sentence.\" \\\n  | grep --color=always \"A red sentence\" > output.txt\n\nThe output looks right when I print it using cat but when I open it in vim I get\nA sentence. ^[[01;31m^[[KA red sentence^[[m^[[K. Another sentence.\n\nSo if you're wanting to use an editor this probably isn't what you want.\n\nA: select the contents of the terminal and right click inside the terminal. In the options you can find \"copy as HTML\". Select the option and paste the copied contents to a file and save it as as an html file. opening the html file using any html renderers (eg. browser). You will be presented with the same contents and colours as your terminal has. tested and verified in ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\n", "Q: Remove text that I don't want I have a big html file on my desktop that looks like\nsrc=\"http://images.alaablubnan.com/images/Balls/20.jpg\"\nalt=\"http://images.alaablubnan.com/images/Balls/20.jpg\"/></a></td><td><a\nhref=\"http://images.alaablubnan.com/images/Balls/32.jpg\"\ntarget=\"_blank\"><img\nsrc=\"http://images.alaablubnan.com/images/Balls/32.jpg\"\nalt=\"http://images.alaablubnan.com/images/Balls/32.jpg\"/></a></td><td><a\nhref=\"http://images.alaablubnan.com/images/Balls/30.jpg\"\ntarget=\"_blank\"><img\nsrc=\"http://images.alaablubnan.com/images/Balls/30.jpg\"\nalt=\"http://images.alaablubnan.com/images/Balls/30.jpg\"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><table><tr><td>webpage/url</td><td>http://www.playlebanon.com/webservices/website/lotto/PopUps/HistoryDetail.aspx?t=1405536730503&FromDraw=1&ToDraw=1213&Draw=0</td></tr></table></td><td>2</td><td>complete\nlotto results</td><td>complete lotto results</td><td>2</td><td><a\nhref=\"http://www.playlebanon.com/webservices/website/lotto/PopUps/HistoryDetail.\n\nIf possible, I want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*get all the .jpg files, remove all the html code (it's  1.jpg, 2.jpg... to 42.jpg)\n\n*I want to remove the .jpg extenstion\n\n*I want each row of numbers to have 7 numbers only, then insert new line\n\n\nA: I assume you're trying to scrape some sort of result. In this example there are only three balls and we can extract them by searching for Balls/<one-or-many-digits> and grouping (the \\(..\\) construct) around the number and then replacing the whole lot with that group (the \\1 is a reference to the first group).\n$ sed -n 's/.*Balls\\/\\([0-9]\\+\\).*/\\1/gp' htmlfile | uniq | xargs -n7 echo\n20 32 30\n\nsed is going through this line by line. I'm asking it to match and replace everything on the line (which is why we cap each end with .* — \"any amount of anything\") with whatever it matches in the group. The -n and /p are used together to not print unless the line was a match and the /g means it'll keep matching until it hits the end of the file.\nIt's a fairly complicated example if you're new to regular expressions.\nI'm passing it through uniq because there's a lot of duplication going on there.\nAnd I'm using | xargs -n7 echo on the end to group 7 arguments together and pass them all onto echo. There aren't 7 balls here so it's only showing 3.\n\nIt probably slows it down but you can have a slightly more readable expression if you use the -r extended syntax for sed:\nsed -nr 's/.*Balls\\/([0-9]+).*/\\1/gp' htmlfile | ...\n\nDoes the same thing, just without some of the confusing looking escaping.\nProbably ever-so-slightly slower.\n\nA: This is not actually a particularly good job for sed but here goes:\nsed -nr 's#.*/([^\"]+).jpg.*#\\1#p' file \n\nThe above will get you a list of numbers, one per line:\n20\n20\n32\n32\n32\n30\n30\n30\n\nNow, it is actually possible to get all these on the same line with 7 numbers per line using sed but it is really not worth the effort. Just use standard *nix tools instead:\n$ echo $(sed -nr 's#.*/([^\"]+).jpg.*#\\1#p' file | tr $'\\n' ' ') | fold -sw 21\n20 20 32 32 32 30 30 \n30\n\nOr, if you want to remove duplicates:\necho $(sed -nr 's#.*/([^\"]+).jpg.*#\\1#p' file | sort -u | tr $'\\n' ' ')\n20 30 32\n\nExplanation\nThe sed command uses a few tricks:\n\n\n*\n\n*-n: don't print any lines by default.\n\n*-r: enable extended regular expressions, this lets us use ( ) to capture groups without needing to escape the parentheses and + for \"one or more\".\n\n*s#from#to# : while the standard substitution operator in sed and other, similar tools, is s/from/to/, you can a non standard delimiter so that you can include / in the pattern. In this case I am using # but you could use something else like s|from|to| as well.\n\n*s#.*/([^\"]+).jpg.*#\\1#p : this will match everything from the beginning of the line \nuntil a / and then captures the longest stretch of non-\" characters until .jpg. This is the filename minus extension. The filename is captured in the parenthesis and the whole line (because of the .* on either side) will be replaced with the captured patter (\\1). The p at the end means that it will print the lines where the substitution was successful. \n\n\n\nPersonally though, I would have done all of this with perl in the first place:\n$ perl -e '@k=grep(s/.*\\/([^\"]+).jpg.*/$1/s,<>); print \"@k[0..6]\\n@k[7..$#k]\\n\"' file \n20 20 32 32 32 30 30\n30\n\nOr, for a larger file:\n$ perl -e '@k=grep(s/.*\\/([^\"]+).jpg.*/$1/s,<>); for($i=0;$i<=$#k;$i+=7){print \"@k[$i..$i+7]\\n\"}' file \n20 20 32 32 32 30 30 30\n30       \n\nOr grep even:\n$ echo $(grep -oP '[^/]+(?=.jpg)' file | tr $'\\n' ' ' ) | fold -w 21\n20 20 32 32 32 30 30 \n30\n\nOr, stealing @Olli's clever xargs idea:\n$ grep -oP '[^/]+(?=.jpg)' file |  xargs -n7 echo\n20 20 32 32 32 30 30\n30\n\n", "Q: How can I shrink a volume In my desktop all hard disk is taken as Ubuntu partition.

If not, what are the options available? I can think of customising the image, or somehow using preseeding with Ubiquity.\nThe annoying thing is that I am booting live Ubuntu over the network (via PXE booting), so the network connectivity is assumed. This causes Ubiquity to try to fetch some things from the mirror, even though, by its admission, it doesn't have \"internet connectivity\", since we are behind a campus proxy.

One of the ongoing problems that has been absolutely maddening is that GRUB has been acting really strangely. \nFor the past few days, I've been trying to get an alternative install of 14.04 in place so I could work on the primary one. (Primary is /dev/sda6, alt is /dev/sda3.) I would make the partition, copy files over or sometimes get a USB install to work or in one case put a (different) drive in a different machine to get the installation in place and then dropping it back into this box. Then, booting into the /sda6, I'd run update-grub, which would CLAIM that it saw both installations. \nBut when I rebooted, the alternative install wasn't available on the menu. \nSo I'd edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg by hand, and reboot. The menu wouldn't change. I would look at it again; my edits were still there, but grub was ignoring the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file on /sda6. Nor was it using /sda3's /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Sometimes there was another drive in the system, but it didn't have any grub.cfg files. \nThat was a few days ago. I managed to get the /sda6 install booting with everything except the GUI (because, as has become abundantly clear, Ubuntu 14.04's drivers for my ATI video are completely screwed up, but that's a different issue). I put an .iso file for Mythbuntu on my alternative partition, prepped it with grml-rescueboot, and ran update-grub. It counted through the usual vz and init files on the boot, the two mem-tests, and then said it found the grml .iso. Okay. \nReboot. Do I get the GRUB menu? Nope. It just went right into the /sda6 installation. I made change after change to grub.cfg and to /etc/default/grub (changing the default number, and many other things, and running update-grub after doing so). No change. I tried booting off my USB stick; it still went right into /sda6. I tried to change the boot order to get the USB stick to go first, and found that the machine's BIOS didn't recognize it as bootable. \nSo I took the USB stick back over to the other Ubuntu machine (running 12.04), and used Unetbootin to copy the 64-bit server .iso back onto it. \nI stick it back into the machine I'm trying to upgrade, and boot. THIS time, I get a grub menu. But, I get the grub menu that's on /sda6! WTF??? When the hard drive (/sda) is the 'first' boot device, grub completely ignores the files on /sda6, but when I boot with the USB stick, THEN it uses the hard drive's /boot files?\nFine. I choose the Mythbuntu .iso off the menu. It boots into that. Which does me no good, because the screen started flashing and blinking, and after ten minutes, went totally black. That would be the broken video driver screwing things up. \nI reboot again. Either grub or the Mythbuntu installer has destroyed the USB's boot records, because once again, I was not shown a grub boot menu, but instead watched it boot right back onto /sda6. (At the moment, that consists of seeing a Lubuntu startup screen for about five seconds, and then the screen goes black. The end.)\nThe machine does have a DVD drive. It's almost certainly malfunctioning; booting off CD/DVD is not an option. Nor can I move /sda to my other computer. /dev/sda is a hardware RAID5 array with five drives. \nI've run update-grub more times than I can count, I've run grub-install, and grub-bios-install, I've worked with fdisk, parted, and gdisk, and even used the firmware on the RAID card to completely wipe a secondary drive so that I could try a totally clean-from-scratch install of grub onto that. I don't think grub has ever booted this system correctly. \nI'm now seriously considering just calling Ubuntu 14.04 an unmitigated disaster, restoring 10.04 from my backups, and leaving it alone, since 10.04 ran without major issues on this box for four years, unless somebody can shed some light on how to get grub to do its job correctly, or point me at something besides grub that would work. \nThoughts? \n\nA: if you are using Grub2, and all of your OS are installed (no live usb with iso) you can always get Grub Customizer. \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\nI have Ubuntu 14.04 on my main computer, Ubuntu and mint on my external hard, and mint on a flash drive (all fully installed) and when I connected all of them and then ran grub customizer it detected every single one, no problems.\nAn alternative solution would be to maybe use plop boot manager or super grub2. They will detect the OS on your computer and run them. Again, super grub2 will not detect live ISO.\n", "Q: Locking down windows drive Im new to these forums but have been getting into Linux lately after years of windows which I only use for gaming now and I see Linux as a superior alternative for everyday use.  \nIm running the LXDE desktop since I really don't like the other alternatives.\nI've managed to allow other login through GUI at bootup so I can login as root.\nI'm dual booting Win 8.1 with Ubuntu, and I would like to totally lock down the Windows partition for security reasons.

The first thing you should do is not login as root if you do not need to. This is pretty much the biggest security risk you can have.\nHaving said that, the easiest way to 'lock' your windows partition is probably not to mount it in the first place (or mount it read-only). You can change this by editing /etc/fstab and comment out the line that is your windows partition by placing a # in front of it. You do need to use sudo to edit /etc/fstab, so be carefull.

I have this system that has a basic Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS installation on it, but no network access. I have this set of deb packages which have been copied to some location on said machine. How do I get dpkg and/or apt to recognise these packages as available?\nI thought $ sudo dpkg --recursive --record-avail would do it, and it does see each package and reports \"Recorded info about …\" for each one, but later attempts to $ sudo apt-get install or $ sudo dpkg -i fail just as before the 'record-avail'. I think I'm close but missing something.\n\nA: It turns out one must first copy the repository descriptors (Packages, Sources, Release, Release.gpg, Index, Translation-en) to /var/lib/apt/lists. Start by installing apt-offline, which has very few dependencies (I was starting from a command-line Ubuntu installation). Once the repository descriptors are in place, both apt-offline and apt become workable.\n", "Q: Cannot boot from USB, need help I wanted to format my w7 drive and install Ubuntu, so I have made an Ubuntu 14. 04 bootable USB, but when I try to boot from that USB it gives this message:\nAttempting boot from USB \nNormally it should boot after this message, but it does not go any further.\nI also have made a Lubuntu 14.04 bootable USB after that, which did not boot same as Ubuntu 14. 04.\nThere is no problem with USB disk, since the same USB disk can boot with w7 installation.\n\nA: To create a USB installation device, you will need: \n\n\n*\n\n*a 2 GB USB flash device/drive/stick.

For this reason we want to establish that the next LTS release is stable before its made available.\nThis happens with the first point i.e. When we release Ubuntu 14.04.1\nThis happened today 25 July 2014 as you can see from this release announcement on the fridge.\nIn the next few days you will start seeing an option to upgrade when you run the Update Manager.\nThere is no urgent need for you to update yet however.  Ubuntu 12.04 is supported till April 2017 and you can upgrade any time from when the Update manger first offers you 14.01 (some time in the next few days) till just before the current LTS release goes EOL.\n\nA: I just repeat my answer from HERE ;)\nI got the same problem 3 days ago and you have two options (considering your network connection is fine).\nFirst option is go HERE choose your country etc. and mark your version of Ubuntu as 14.04. Then paste generated list into /etc/apt/sources.list (better backup first). Then run sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade -y then run do-release-upgrade. It's highly possible that you also have to repair grub after that. And to do that you will need bootable CD or USB, so you simply can run your update from Live CD. And that is the second option.\n\nA: To get Ubuntu 14.04.1\n   sudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\n", "Q: Uninstall then install makes vstpd service unrecognized, vsftpd: unrecognized service I installed vsftpd on my server using this and this link.

Historically, gcc used an external assembler, as, which was \nincluded in binutils. Several years ago, gcc changed its implementation to have  functionality of 'as' in gcc itself. The time past.

You can force it's use in SDL1 based games with:\n SDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE=/dev/input/js0;export SDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE\n\nbut since even SDL1 games are getting kind of old that will be of limited use as well.\nFor SDL2 based games there is the SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG environment variable which allows you to remap the joystick directly. If you are using Steam you can configure your controller in Big Picture Mode and it will automatically set that variable for you.\n", "Q: Wireless connection drops on Intel Centrino 6235 I am in a wifi network at school which has secure access and I have been using it for months now, but the problem started a few days ago.

I know I can install different desktop UIs on Ubuntu, but I am concerned because I read that there are sometimes risks like when the config files for one desktop environment are corrupted or modified by the secondary (I think it was xfce and unity ). \nI've considered installing two OSes in my VM, the latest Ubuntu Studio and Ubuntu desktop 12.04 for performance reasons. This one looks like the most stable alternative but there would be a problem with having two workspaces. Honestly, I like both Unity and Xfce, and I need only one instance of my project files.\nThe second option is to install Ubuntu Studio which comes with Xfce and then install Unity 2D. However, I'm concerned if one will break the other. \nWhat do you guys know about having  drastically different desktop UI installed on one system? What experiences and risks should I be concerned about?\n\nA: The risk is that stuff will randomly not work, and you will have no idea why. \nHypothetically desktops should be able to share a system, and developers should ensure that having one desktop installed does not interfere with another. The problems appear when desktops rely on different software to implement the same services, and the developers of both desktops just say \"well, it works on our desktop, you should just remove the other desktop\".\nOne example: bug #984230 - the packages xfce4-notifyd (from XFCE) and notify-osd (from Gnome/Unity) are incompatible, and if you install XFCE and Unity at the same time, you will find that notifications in XFCE do not work as expected, because the notification service is activated by DBUS, and notify-osd always gets run instead of the XFCE version. notify-osd developers do not consider this a bug in notify-osd, and xfce4-notifyd developers do not consider this a bug in xfce4-notifyd, since both work fine when the other is not installed!\nAnother example: bug #889394 - having gnome-screensaver, xscreensaver and xfce4-power-manager installed at the same time. They both had the same timeout. The result of this was that after some time, one screensaver kicked in and turned off the monitor (dpms), but the other would just black the screen (no power off). So depending what order they got run, which was essentially random, the monitors would either stay on or turn off.  One of the confusing thing about this situation was that both screensaver applications have different settings, so  changing settings can result in no effect on what is actually happening. \nAnother confusing thing is that XFCE will try to lock the screen using xflock4, but it will always use xscreensaver if it is present, never gnome-screensaver, and you have no way of knowing this unless you look at the source code. And xubuntu-desktop depends on both xscreensaver and xfce4-power-manager, even though they conflict. \nSo, that is why I try to avoid installing more than one desktop, and instead install each desktop with its own full install on a different partition. You can install more than one desktop on the same system, but the developers of each desktop are less likely to care or fix bugs that only occur when two or more desktops are installed.\nSome more incompatibilities to watch out for:\n\n\n*\n\n*When running lightDM user switching doesn't work  (Gnome uses GDM DBUS service, GDM is the \"one and only supported display manager\" for GNOME, patches for lightdm are rejected) \n\n*Gnome Keyring incompatibilities (Gnome Keyring uses Gnome Session DBUS service which is not available on other desktops) \n", "Q: Openoffice headless I want to install Openoffice headless in Ubuntu 14.04.

According to the Gnumeric manual available at http://www.fifi.org/doc/gnumeric-doc/html/C/, Latex 2e is one of the supported file formats, available via the Save as... dialog.  \nUsing Ubuntu 14.04 and having installed Gnumeric from the Ubuntu Software Center, I do not see the option to save as Latex in the File Type drop-down menu. \n\nA: This is not anymore in File/Save as, you need to use Data/Export Data/Export into Other Format...\n\nA: Here's a screenshot showing the location of 'export' in the menu system. Note the keyboard shortcut for repeating exports in the same format, Ctrl + e].\n \nThe option to export to Latex 2e produces a standalone .tex file of the 'report' class, incorporating the packages longtable and multirow, which is too large to reproduce here.\nThis can be somewhat unwieldy, so if the final output is going to be .tex I have found it simplest to keep the formatting of the gnumeric table to a minimum (e.g. ignore column alignment, although date formatting is useful, as above) and export as Latex 2e table fragment, as below, which is rather 'bare bones'. Editing the .tex manually allows for the use of additional niceties like the package booktabs. \nA better choice might be to export the table from Calc, using Calc2LaTeX or similar. This should result in less work formatting the table correctly in .tex. \n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%                                                                  %%\n%%  This is a LaTeX2e table fragment exported from Gnumeric.        %%\n%%                                                                  %%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n    &b  &c  &d\\\\\n1   &ab &1  &1-Jan-2000\\\\\n2   &cd &2  &1-Jan-2010\\\\\n3   &ef &3  &1-Jan-2020\\\\\n\n", "Q: Disable and enable certain websites automatically As some sites like facebook are distracting to me, I have decited to edit /etc/hosts file in order to block (temporarily) those sites as an extra way to avoid these sites.

The reason is run-parts will not pickup the files that do not follow this rule.\nhttp://voidtech.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/cron-a-script-in-cron-daily-folder-is-not-executed-fix/\nhttp://justcheckingonall.wordpress.com/2009/06/28/cron-does-not-run-scripts/\n\nA: The user crontabs, as given by crontab -e or crontab -l, are NOT system crontabs. User crontabs are stored as files within /var/spool/, typically /var/spool/cron/crontab/username\nThe only safe/clean way to edit these is using crontab -e, as it automatically validates the syntax and complains if you make a mistake, thereby not allowing you to mess up too badly.\nHowever, the OP's query is regarding system cron scripts as at /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly, and so forth. Typically these scripts are called due to their being within the crontab file at /etc/crontab. Another set of crontabs are also at /etc/cron.d/*. These, along with the scripts in /etc/cron.{daily,weekly,...} are considered the \"system\" crons.\nThese system crons are run regardless of the content of root's crontab, even if root's crontab is completely empty. These crontabs (the crontabs, not the scripts) are also a little different in that there is an extra column (column 6) where you have to specify the username that the entry is to run as. This column is of course unnecessary in the \"user\" crons.\n\nA: You say that with sudo the scripts run. Check if the scripts are registered at root's crontab list using sudo crontab -l to list root's jobs. \nIf the scripts are registered in root's crontab, then the most probable errors may be:\n\n\n*\n\n*The path to the script may be relative and not absolute which is the prefered solution\n\n*The script itself is noted chmoded\n\n*Various environment variables are not loaded by cron during the execution of the jobs\n\n\nIf the scripts are not registered in root's crontab here is an example on how to register them:\nSay I have a backup script named backup.sh located at /root/bin `that I want to run on my machine every 10 days and is a system (root's) job. To register it at root's crontab:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo crontab -e to open the root's crontab for edit\n\n*In a new line enter:\n\n\n08 22 */10 * * /root/bin/backup.sh packages directories dbs remote email &>/dev/null\nTo run the cron job as root at 22:08 every 10 days with arguments: packages directories dbs remote email and send any output to /dev/null.\nThe result is that the backup script will start executing at the specific time by root and will do it's job to backup various directories, apt sources, databases, scp to remote server the tar backup archive and send email to the administrator. As you can see a complex cron job run as system task successfully.\n", "Q: How can i Use BMG CS-09 EVDO Modem in ubuntu 14.04? Bus 003 Device 004: ID 05c6:1000 Qualcomm, Inc.

What was the reasoning behind using Thunar as the default file manager in Xubuntu (compared to Ubuntu's default of Nautilus). Unless I have mistakenly installed it (if so, likely as another application's dependency), Nautilus seems to be installed on Xubuntu by default, but is unused.\nIs Thunar more performance friendly than Nautilus? Or is Thunar simply continuing to be used because it has been the default for Xubuntu since 6.06 release?\n\nA: This answer is based on historical sources on the Web.\nAccording to this release note, Xubuntu 6.06 had included Xfce 4.4beta1 and Thunar. This release of Xfce is also the first release to include Thunar as the default file manager, replacing the original Xfce file manager Xffm (now code named 'Rodent').\nThis dated project site has noted the release of Thunar as part of Xfce at that time.\n\n16 Apr 06\nThe first beta release of Thunar was released today, as part of Xfce 4.4BETA1. \n\nRegarding how Thunar becomes the default in Xfce, this can be read from the history that has been written in the Rodent user guide.\n\n[...] To distinguish Xffm as a part of Xfce, the first release was tagged 4.0.\nThen came 4.2 and the love/hate story started. Those new to Xfce could not understand why Xffm had such a steep learning curve, while those familiar to Xftree expected the nerdy behaviour they had become used to.\nAnyways, it was decided that Xfce would no longer distribute a filemanager: this way users could choose the new Thunar filemanager (which, as an independent software, would no longer follow the Xfce version numbers).\n\nThe short story: It seems that the original file manager was unfriendly to new users of Xfce. You can see for yourself the file managers in Xfce 3 and Xfce 4.4 on Wikimedia Commons.\n\nUnless I have mistakenly installed it (if so, likely as another application's dependency), Nautilus seems to be installed on XUbuntu by default, but is unused.\n\nNautilus itself is not installed by default. Prior to 16.04 release, Xubuntu had included nautilus-data which was required by the archive manager of GNOME file-roller. The dependency has since changed in newer releases, and Xubuntu does no longer rely on such package.\n\nIs Thunar more performance friendly than Nautilus? Or is Thunar simply continuing to be used because it has been the default for XUbuntu since 6.06?\n\nBased on the history, Thunar becomes the default mainly because Xffm was unfriendly to new users. Another supporting reason is that the memory usage of Thunar was significantly lower than other file managers at that time.\nThis legacy wiki page, which was last accessible and archived in 2012, reported the memory usage of Thunar compared to Nautilus, ROX, Konqueror and Xffm.\nFile manager  Virtual size  Stack size  Data size  Executable/Library size\nXffm                 16568         128       4188                    12248\nKonqueror            34660         128       7884                    26644\nROX                  20980         128       5544                    15304\nNautilus             27812         128       7780                    19900\nThunar               17172         128       2900                    14140\n\nIn above table, you should look at the Data size for comparison (the reasoning for this can be read in the quoted link of legacy wiki). Note that the author had disclaimed this is \"by no means 100% exact\" and \"just a rough measurement\".\nTL;DR Thunar is the default file manager in Xfce, before being the default in Xubuntu. The legacy wiki had proven that Thunar uses less memory; Thunar is generally more responsive than Nautilus.\n", "Q: \"invalid pixel format string\" when encoding a sequence of .pngs with avconv I have a sequence of .pngs and I want to encode them into a video using the h264 codec.\nAfter a bit of googling I found that the proper incantation for doing this is\navconv -f image2 -i frame_%08d.png -c:v h264 -crf 1 -r 24 out.mov\n\nbut if I try this I get the following error:\n[buffer @ 0x1919a40] Invalid pixel format string '-1'\nError opening filters!\n\nDo I need to add extra options to get the .pngs to encode?

Is there a work around this?\n\nA: No. For apt-get the one installing applications was the user root since he's the only one that can write on the entire filesystem.

This is done to report errors and give developers an idea of how their system could scale. With that in mind and knowing this is NOT a benchmark tool, the correct stress level depends on your hardware.\nOn your case -c 2 & -m 2 is enough for the CPU you are using. I normally don't like stressing the hard drive with the -d option since it takes away life from it (Leech king style). you could however add the -i option for the I/O and lower the -t paremeter to 10 to 20 seconds.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on unbootable XP I hope you can help me because I'm getting really frustrated here. I've decided to turn to Ubuntu since I'm fed up with a BSOD my XP is giving me for a few days now, but I can't get through the install process. That BSOD I'm speaking of is happening during the Windows XP loading screen so I can't even get to the point where I type the password to access my PC. The only way I can get access to my computer is through safe mode and that's where I'm writing from right now. \n1st I must say that my CD/DVD drive is broken, so I can't go that way. 2nd I've tried booting Ubuntu from USB pendrive, first by Unetbootin then by Universal USB Installer, but in both cases nothing happens - when I press boot from USB in BIOS, my PC is stuck on second loading screen (the one you have just before Windows XP logo loading screen). \nSo here's my question. Can I install Ubuntu from XP safe mode without using USB or CD? I know about the Live CD option and it would work perfectly fine but as I said before I can only work on safe mode and Live CD requests PC restart. And when I do that, I get BSOD before my current OS logs on. Please help me if you can, because I got to the point where I want to throw my computer out the window. \ne/ sorry for any possible language mistakes \n\nA: It's clear that your image on the USB is not installed/created correctly. I recommend doing that on another machine and testing it on that other machine.\nFor the part about installing Ubuntu through the Windows XP safe mode, even if it is possible, I can only see so many bad things coming from installing Ubuntu from inside Windows, even more from safe mode since it does not offer all hardware correctly detected or optimized with the drivers when loading Windows normally.\nI recommendation is to do one thing at the time. First create the USB Ubuntu on another computer and test it that it boots correctly.\nMake sure that on your PC, the Bios is correctly configured not only to boot from an USB as 1st choice but also that it allows booting from USB (Some BIOS give the option to boot from USB but have the option to actually boot from it somewhere else).\nIf you actually boot from the USB, simply follow instructions to be able to create a dual boot with Ubuntu and Windows. From this point on, you can fix Windows through the Ubuntu desktop by checking it with fsck, looking for corrupted files, etc.\n", "Q: Where to install the bootloader?

When is loads directly to Windows, to get to Ubuntu you can also go to Update and Recovery screen and then select Restart Now.  This brings up menu of ways to restart.  One of them is Use Device.   Besides USB, the Ubuntu distribution comes up as an option.  We have been using this as work-around (before we did re-stall and chose EFI Partition, which seems to have fixed the problem.)

I just spent the last half hour looking up ways to automount, but none of them was woking with xubuntu. Any help?\n\nA: From Ubuntu 12.10 onwards, the steps in this answer applies for automounting partitions. The Disks utility (formerly palimpsest) (which is already installed on Ubuntu, but perhaps not on Xubuntu) should be enough.

Screenshots are available in the linked answer.\n\nA: First you need to make the directory to mount to (e.g.) /mnt/2tb and then you can edit /etc/fstab to create the mount. Fstab will then automatically mount your drive/partition to the directory created at boot.\n\nA: All info above is good - but this is the EASIEST\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the \"Disks\" application.

I've ran into a host of problems and I'm extremely frustrated at this. I'm using xboxdrv and nothing is happening. The system is recognizing there is a controller attached. I get the following when I'm running it with detach-kernel-driver.\nController:        PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller\nVendor/Product:    054c:0268\nUSB Path:          001:028\nController Type:   Playstation 3 USB\nStarting without uinput\n\nYour Xbox/Xbox360 controller should now be available as:\n  /dev/input/js0\n  /dev/input/event4\n\nPress Ctrl-c to quit, use '--silent' to suppress the event output\n\nNothing happens when I'm using the controller. I press the PS button before I run xboxdrv, and the controller skips a blink and continues blinking. \nI'm running Elementary OS, which is Ubuntu 12.04. I found that there was a kernel issue with supporting the PS3 controller so I installed the latest Kernel (3.14). I thought this would solve the issue but nothing. \nI tried running the controller over Bluetooth, but I'm also having issues with it. This is due to the on-board bluetooth also not being supported by the kernel, and it is conflicting with a Bluetooth USB dongle that I got. \nThe is a perfect fake of the PS one. I asked another person that bought it and he said it worked perfectly with his PS3. I don't think this is the issue plaguing me. I will try and get an original one to try it out. I also ran Ubuntu 14.04 in virtual machine, and nothing as well. \nUp for suggestions and help!\n\nA: Chances are fairly high that the kernel version of Elementary OS is out-of-date. Updating to a more stable version of Ubuntu, such as 14.04, would be advisable. Once you've done that, have a look at the recommendations provided by Game Imps. They suggest running the xboxdrv command as such:\nsudo xboxdrv --detach-kernel-driver\n\nIf this does not work, try removing your Bluetooth dongle and utilizing bluez with the 14.04 installation's kernel installed.\nYour other, more costly, option, is to purchase a controller that supports Linux natively, such as the Logitech F710. This controller has out-of-the-box wireless support for most Linux distros, especially Ubuntu distributions, as it pairs not with Bluetooth, but with a dedicated USB 2.0 dongle (included with the controller).\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the Playstation button on the controller\n\n*Plug controller in via USB\n\n*Pair with bluetooth whilst USB is plugged in\n\n*Start xboxdrv whilst USB is plugged in\n\n*Unplug USB whilst xboxdrv is running\n\n\nI know it seems weird, but it's the only way it worked for me.\nAlso, the buttons change when on bluetooth, so run evtest and find what the /dev/input/event__ is for your controller. Then edit this to include the correct /dev/input/event__ and run it:\nsudo xboxdrv --evdev /dev/input/event__ KEY_#300=y,KEY_#302=a,KEY_#301=b,BTN_DEAD=x,BTN_TOP=start,BTN_TRIGGER=back,KEY_#704=guide,BTN_BASE6=rb,BTN_BASE5=lb,BTN_TOP2=du,BTN_BASE2=dl,BTN_BASE=dd,BTN_PINKIE=dr,BTN_THUMB=tl,BTN_THUMB2=tr --evdev-absmap ABS_#49=rt,ABS_#48=lt,ABS_X=x1,ABS_Y=y1,ABS_Z=x2,ABS_RZ=y2 --axismap -Y1=Y1,-Y2=Y2 --calibration RT=0:127:255,LT=0:127:255 --mimic-xpad-wireless\n\n", "Q: How to give Ubuntu 14.04 more disk space My original OS was / is W7 and whenever I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS it gave me 17GB of space but now I want to expand it for certain applications.\n\nI kinda am new to the whole disk and partitioning thing so GOOD help would be appreciated.\nI also installed Ubuntu alongside W7.\n\nA: To give more space to Ubuntu, you'll need to do a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink /dev/sda2\n\n*Resize the extended partition (/dev/sda3) to include the space freed up by the previous step.\n\n*Decide whether the space is for system applications (those installed by apt-get, Software Centre, etc.) or user applications (those installed by you from source, precompiled binaries, etc.\n\n*If the former, resize root (/dev/sda5); if the latter, make a partition in the free space and mount it somewhere convenient. I'll cover the former for now, and the latter if anybody requests it.\n\n\nTo accomplish the first step, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink using GParted or \n\n*Shrink using the Disk Management section in Windows' Computer Management. \n\n\nWith GParted, you can shrink to free up as much space as available, but the operation will be slow. With Windows, shrinking will be very fast, but you may not be able to free up as much space as is shown to be unused. This is because the Windows utility only shrinks upto the last used sector, whereas GParted moves around files. I recommend that you see how much Windows is willing to free up, and if it is satisfactory, use it, or else use GParted. And if you do choose to use GParted, use a live CD/USB to do so. I'll assume a live environment for any Linux operations henceforth.\n\n\n*\n\n*To shrink in Windows, right click My Computer and select Manage. Go to the Disk Management section, select the C: partition, right click it and choose Shrink Volume:\n\n\n*To do so in GParted: Unmount the partition first if it is mounted (the key icon shows it is mounted) by right clicking /dev/sda2 and selecting Unmount. Choose Resize/Move, and drag the right end of the slider (or enter in values manually) until enough free space is shown at the end of the partition.\n\n*Right click the root partition and select Information. You'll get a window that looks like this:\n\nCopy the UUID to somewhere (open a file in gedit and paste it there, if you will).\n\n*Repeat the above step with the extended partition and the root partition, but this time dragging the slider to fill up the free space at the beginning.\n\n*Click on the green tick to apply.\n\n\nOnce the operations have finished, you'll probably have to change the UUID values of the partitions (as used in /etc/fstab, GRUB, etc.).  For this, we will set up a chroot. But first, repeat step 2 to get the new UUID of the root partition. If they are the same, no worries, skip the next section. You are done. If not:\nNow open a terminal and do the following steps:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\nsudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount -t devpts none /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo mount -t proc none /mnt/proc\nsudo mount -t sysfs none /mnt/sysfs\n\nsudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash -l\n\nNow, you will be inside a chroot environment in your installed Ubuntu, as opposed to the live Ubuntu used to get there. We must replace the UUID value for root in /etc/fstab, so use your choice of editor to open it and change the value to the one you copied a few steps ago (if you aren't familiar with vi, use nano):\nvi /etc/fstab\n\n(You are root within the chroot, so you don't need sudo.)\nOr use the sed command:\nsed -i 's/OLD_UUID/NEW_UUID/' /etc/fstab\n\n(Replace OLD_UUID and NEW_UUID with the appropriate values.)\nFinally, update GRUB:\nupdate-grub\n\nIf this finished without errors, you can exit the chroot (exit) and reboot. Done!\n", "Q: Fix XPad Driver I followed the first answer here: How do I get an XBOX 360 controller working?, and ended up screwing with my XPad drivers.

Reboot the system and see if xpad is working again. If not, run sudo apt-get purge xbox* to remove all xboxdrv-related packages from your system. Once again, reboot and test xpad.\n", "Q: Dual-display solution (other than ARandR) on Lubuntu/Xubuntu? What I want to achieve is an elegant way to use my two screens on Lubuntu or Xubuntu. Being elegant means: 1) Working in the same extended-display mode as in ubuntu-desktop (the common Unity Ubuntu) or Windows, or 2) Some other workaround that limit my LXDE or XFCE desktop on one screen and see something else (e.g. TTY or xterm) on the other screen.\nThe story comes below...\n\nThis is on an old DELL LATITUDE D600 laptop. It has a 1024x768 LCD and a VGA output.\nI installed Xubuntu 12.04 LTS on this laptop and later changed to LXDE by installing lubuntu-desktop and removing most of XFCE packages.Now it has lightdm (with unity-greeter) and LXDE.\nWhen I attached a secondary screen to the laptop's VGA output, the two screens were working in mirror mode, whether I was in TTY, unity-greeter, or LXDE desktop.This behavior was different from my previous experience on some other laptop. On that other laptop, I have ever had Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 13.10, and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed. TTY is usually displayed only on the external screen, and unity-greeter should work in extended mode, where the login dialog is only displayed on one of the screens, leaving the other screen nothing but an Ubuntu icon as well as the greeter's wallpaper.\nLet alone the different behavior here, I found that neither of XFCE or LXDE has built-in support for extended mode. Thus I was wondering if the behavior I observed above is laptop-dependent or actually distribution-dependent.\nHaving read lots of articles I found on Google, I got to know ARandR. However ARandR worked inelegantly, and also appeared different from dual-screen solutions in Ubuntu ubuntu-desktop or Windows. When I use the Print Screen key for screen-shot I got this:\n\nLooks normal? Not at all. Since my external display was 1024x1280 (a vertically placed 1280x1024 LCD), the two screens didn't really form a rectangle shape when placed together. If I had two windows maximized on the two screens the screen-shot would look like this:\n\nThe upper right corner was not seen on any screen. This was why I said ARandR was inelegant and behaved differently from the extended mode in Ubuntu ubuntu-desktop and that in Windows. If you've never seen the extended mode in ubuntu-desktop or Windows I could post an image for them later.\nThe biggest problem was that, though I cannot move my cursor into the non-existing region of the ARandR desktop (e.g. the upper right corner in my screen-shots), the desktop was rendered on the entire rectangle region. This means, if the bottom line of my two screens are not of the same vertical coordinate (i.e. if my screens are not aligned to bottom), I will lose half of my task bar (depending on which screen is placed higher)!\nAnd also, I found everything displayed extremely slowly on the vertical external screen. For example, when I open Firefox, first the frame of the window and the blank page is flashed up to down, then the contents of the new-tab page the same way... But things appeared OK on the laptop screen.\n\nStory ends. Please refer to the first paragraph for my objectives. Achieving one of the two objectives will be good enough.\nI've read this article: https://superuser.com/questions/562657/x-on-one-monitor-a-bare-tty-terminal-on-another-linux for using xterm on one display while running the desktop on the other. However, xsetroot -display :0.1 -solid darkblue failed because it \"cannot open display :0.1\".\nOutput of xrandr --query:\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 2048 x 1280, maximum 4096 x 4096\nVGA-0 connected 1024x1280+0+0 left (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 376mm x 301mm\n   1280x1024      60.0*+   75.0  \n   1152x864       75.0  \n   1024x768       75.1     60.0  \n   800x600        75.0     60.3  \n   640x480        75.0     60.0  \n   720x400        70.1  \nDVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nLVDS connected 1024x768+1024+512 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm\n   1024x768       60.0*+\n   800x600        59.9  \n   848x480        59.7  \n   720x480        59.7  \n   640x480        59.4  \nS-video disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nI don't really know how to identify my two screens using the numbers like :0 or :0.0, etc.\n\nA: What you are asking is fully reasonable and sensible, and I wish I knew all details about X configuration to just tell you how. Basically, what you have is one Screen in one X display server, and what you want is either two servers or two \"Screens\" in one server. In either case, it'll require you to set up the X server configuration(s); the so named /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\nIn X land, you have names of format \"host:display.screen\" that refer to the software structuring for how programs make their output, whereas the actual physical outputs are known as \"Monitors\", that are tied to screens through \"Heads\". Thus, in your case, you have a single screen \"localhost:0.0\" with two monitors (VGA-0 and LVDS). Most often there is singularity in monitors and heads and screens and displays and hosts, and everything is easy, but this is not your case.\nI'm afraid there is no short cut for this, by you need to learn about configuring X. Essentially: firstly, you obtain the default configuration that your X server is using in the absence of an /etc/X11/xorg.conf, by entering console mode, killing X, then starting X with a special command line that writes the configuration to a file. Next, you edit that file by adding a Screen stanza, and bind each screen to its own head.\nMaybe that very, very brief outline helps you move forward. I'm out of time.\n", "Q: So I built a new rig and put ubuntu 14 64bit on it as only Os, i have 2 xfx radeon 6870 cards in one is dual dis and the other is not I have the Cd for the non dual dis but I have no idea how to install the drivers, im sooo noob to ubuntu but i rly like it...\nI want to dual boot windows also just because I am way more familiar with it but I have no idea first off howto install the graphic card drivers and I do not have any idea how to partition the 240 ssd to even begin to put any of my win os's on....I guess first question is the amd drivers fopr my graphic cards and then how to partition the drive to install a windows boot.....also if you dont mind i have a usb drive with xbuntu kubuntu and xbmc for ubuntu which id also LOVE to have on my rig in ubuntu....would ne of them be handy to have on and why? My ultimate goal with the rig is to run several monitors for work and some play. I will not be gaming nething that will need the cards to much. mainly for the multiple display.\n\nA: Install windows first to its own partition then once windows has drivers and updates then boot ubuntu and install that secondly. Ubuntu will walk you thru its dual boot setup easily at that point. There are other ways but this is by far the most straightforward since your new to ubuntu.\nKeep in mind how many total partitions you will want before you start windows setup. so you can divide a single HDD capacity by that number during windows setup to leave enough room for the other 3 operating systems later.\nBtw I recommend SSD over HDD always if you have some budget left in your build and you dont need a ton of space 250GB SSD will not dissapoint per dollar.\n", "Q: Cant install or download anything I just bought a new computer and it has Ubuntu already on it, and I want to get rid of it and install windows 7.

It seems to be working fine with either version, so to remove 12.04 leaving just 14.04 should I remove the partition containing 12.04 and run upgrade-grub before rebooting? Or is there a better way?\n\nA: Make sure your boot partition isn't the one containing the Ubuntu 12.04 boot. If it is, it's better to move the boot partition to another one.\nAfter that (or if you are sure it isn't the same partition), you can normally delete the partition (or using GParted which I recommend) and assign the free space to whatever you'd like. \nTry doing those on your installed Ubuntu 14.04 (except moving the /boot because it's mounted), because that way GParted won't let you mess up with Ubuntu 14.04 mounted partitions. \nThen you can run repair-boot to delete and update your grub2 settings.\n", "Q: StarCraft II Ubuntu 14.04 installation for a noob I followed some online instructions for installing StarCraft II from Installing StarCraft II on Ubuntu 14.04 and then it was trying to download eurofixi.exe from an FTP site and not getting any response and having to repeat itself over and over with no success. \nThe game seems to have downloaded, but there's no executable file to run with Wine.\nWhen I try to redownload the game to play it on Ubuntu 14.04, it gives me the option press play, and when I do this it loads the game in part, asks me to login to Battle.net (not giving me the option to play offline) and then goes pear-shaped.\nIn the last paragraph in the  Installing StarCraft II on Ubuntu 14.04 tutorial it said.\n\nIf you encounter any other issues, check out the blog posts I mentioned previously for some tips.

I finally got the game to run when I figured out that my graphics card drivers weren't doing me any favors (literally) kill and or remove all your video card drivers and reinstall ones you're absolutely sure are correct. All the other workarounds that I tried wouldn't get me passed the launcher. For example going into wine to mess with dbhelp, running windowed at different resolutions, installing windows fonts and winetricks. After all of those it was my drivers. Something I thought was fine. When nothing works... start looking at what you only assumed was working.\nFor me, after installing drivers the game launches and plays, but there are block text bugs and blacked out portions of the screen. Now i'm trying all of those other things to get it working smoothly. I haven't tried play on linux yet and I'm going to check youtube. There was a good video on getting hearthstone/SC2 working.

Don't uninstall any packages.)\nYou may need to logout after installing ibus-libpinyin before the intelligent pinyin option shows up.\n", "Q: Should `arm-none-eabi-gcc` include a `stdio.h`?

I am using Windows8 and now I am trying to install Ubuntu alongside my Windows8 .My professor has warned that i might lose all my data in the hard disk.Will I lose the data ? \n\nA: Installing Ubuntu as a dual-boot option alongside Windows requires your hard drive to be re-partitioned. Re-partitioning a drive is a potential risk for your data (this is not related to Ubuntu, it is always risky!). In case you are not familiar with disk partitioning this risk will be considerable.\n\nPlease backup all your data before you install any other OS\n\nOnly after that you will be able to recover in case anything goes wrong accidentally.\nThen you may be able to install Ubuntu as outlined here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (UEFI Supported)\nThe default installer should take care to make space for Ubuntu in your partition layout. In case you feel more comfortable in partitioning from Windows it is recommended to leave an unpartitioned space on your drive to hold Ubuntu. The installer will then create at least two new partitions on installing Ubuntu there.\nIn any case as soon as you told the installer to \"replace\" an OS or \"erase\" a disk it will inevitably repartition your hard drive(s) to remove all the content there. Then only those parts that were not overwritten may be recovered using forensic tools.\nPlease also note:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu can't read an encrypted drive\n\n*Ubuntu can't read Windows dynamic disks\n\n*Do not hibernate Windows before installing (this includes the Windows fast-boot option!)\n\n*If in doubt or anything appears weird: don't continue. Ask somebody for help.\n\n\nLast not least: don't worry too much. In the usual case nothing bad happens. Ubuntu just installs fine as dual-boot without any issues in the very most cases.\n\nA: You may lose your data indeed. But if you are careful enough, you will not. \nFirst of all back everything up. Then, if you have enough free space, allocate partitions for Ubuntu OS. If you don't, try shrinking existing partitions using GParted or some other tool(there are plenty of those for windows too, google it), and allocate Ubuntu partitions there. I usually did this step during installation of Ubuntu. In the end I had all my windows data safe and Ubuntu running.

I've EOL release of Ubuntu 13.10. Now I want to upgrade to next release. For this I read many sites. So herein I would like to clarify & confirm ways for the same.\n1) This site of ubuntu mentions how to upgrade from 8.10 to 9.04.\nIt says to make sure the sources.list (/etc/apt/sources.list) has the following:\n## EOL upgrade sources.list\n # Required\n deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid main restricted universe multiverse\n deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid-updates main restricted universe multiverse\n deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid-security main restricted universe multiverse\n\n # Optional\n #deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid-backports main restricted universe multiverse\n #deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid-proposed main restricted universe multiverse\n\nNow my sources.list in 13.10 has the following. It doesn't have the words \"universe multiverse\" as is mentioned above.\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release i386 (20131016.1)]/ saucy main restricted\n\n# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to\n# newer versions of the distribution.\ndeb http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy main restricted\ndeb-src http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy main restricted\n\n## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the\n## distribution.\ndeb http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy-updates main restricted\ndeb-src http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy-updates main restricted\n\n## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu\n## team.

Please clarify the codename of 14.04 to be used in the sources.list, is it \"trusty\" (I feel so) or \"trusty tahr\". If the code name to be used is \"trusty\", then I don't know why this Ubuntu site mentions it's codename as \"trusty tahr\"!!!! Also as the 1st link explains, is it O.K. that I delete all lines from my sources.list (in 13.10) & only include the stated 8 sentences (obviously by replacing with the relevant codename) as mentioned in the 1st code of this Q?\n2) Now that 1st link says to run the below commands.\n sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade\n sudo do-release-upgrade\n\nThat's all! But this link of Ubuntu also states of installing some meta-packages/dependencies. Please clarify what's these dependencies & is it reqd. to install these? If reqd. then why that link (1st link of upgrading from 8.10 to 9.04) doesn't mention this?\n3) Also, one more point I would like to clarify. See rather than doing via cli, I'm getting a way to do via GUI. See if I only replace archive.ubuntu.com to old-releases.ubuntu.com then when I run \"software updater\", it has option to upgrade as shown below.\n\nSo, can my system be upgraded this way even? I'm asking this because I couldn't find this method mentioned for upgrading EOL.\n4) This is my last point to ask. (Sorry for extending this thread) Once I run the command to upgrade sudo do-release-upgrade via cli or if I click the \"Upgrade\" button on the GUI of the updater, is it possible that it doesn't require my intervention or input anymore (assuming no error occurs) to complete the upgrade so that I can run the upgrade process in the night before going to sleep & when I get up it should be done?\n\nA: The safest way to upgrade from 13.10 to 14.04 is by doing the following in a Terminal, thus:\na) do a CTRL + ALT + T to open a Terminal\nb) type the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nto update your packages lists\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nto make sure your system is fully up-to-date before proceeding to the release upgrade\nfinally:\nsudo update-manager -d\n\nnon-graphical alternative (all within the Terminal):\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nc) The update manager will show a button to do the upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04. Click on it and follow the instructions.\nWARNING! BEFORE UPGRADING! Please do a backup of your data... just in case!\n", "Q: 14.04 - Old Firefox Version won't install, can't use profile manager I'm new to Ubuntu. (14.04)\nFirefox comes default as version 31.x, but I need to use 29.0.1.\nI've tried following multiple instructions, whereby copying an old firefox (old v29) to the usr/bin directory after unzippping it, thus overwriting the default version (v31). I can't seem to get everything working though.\nThe default version (v31) and old version (v29) run side by side, but opening the profile manager via the command line (firefox -p) just opens it via the new version (v31).\nI need to completely remove the new version (v31) of firefox and just have the old version (v29), which I can then access the profile manager from the command line (so it's all v29).\nRemoving the new firefox installed by default (v31) via sudo apt-get remove firefox will stop 'firefox' being accessable in the terminal, despite the old version (v29) existing in usr/bin\nI'm very confused and need some guidance.\n\nA: Simply download the Firefox Linux binary, unzip somewhere of your choice, give execute permissions to the binary file and launch it in a terminal.\nYou may create a .desktop file pointing to the chosen Firefox version giving it a different name (ex. Firefox 29) and save the file in ~/.local/share/applications/\nThus you can run both versions of Firefox.\nBe aware that they will share the profile folder unless you tweak the defaults.\n", "Q: Having problem with installing apt-fast I'm trying to install apt-fast, and I use bellow commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:apt-fast/stable\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAfter updating my sources I receive following warnings:\n.\n.\n.\nIgn http://ubuntu.unitedcolo.de trusty/main Translation-en_US                  \nIgn http://ubuntu.unitedcolo.de trusty/multiverse Translation-en_US\nIgn http://ubuntu.unitedcolo.de trusty/restricted Translation-en_US\nIgn http://ubuntu.unitedcolo.de trusty/universe Translation-en_US\nIgn http://ubuntu.unitedcolo.de trusty-updates/main Translation-en_US\nIgn http://ubuntu.unitedcolo.de trusty-updates/multiverse Translation-en_US\nIgn http://ubuntu.unitedcolo.de trusty-updates/restricted Translation-en_US\nIgn http://ubuntu.unitedcolo.de trusty-updates/universe Translation-en_US\nFetched 21.2 MB in 13min 19s (26.5 kB/s)\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/apt-fast/stable/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/apt-fast/stable/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/apt-fast/stable/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

In Power management I have it unchecked. There is another option \"Enable light locker\" in the \"Light locker settings\". I also have this unchecked but I still see black screen after 10 minutes and when I move the mouse I have to provide a password.\nI hate this behaviour in all ubuntus, but usually I can just disable it in system settings. Well not here.\nSo lubuntu has these settings in two places and is ignoring both.\nI found this question:\nStop Xscreensaver from locking screen once screensaver starts\nAccording to this, I tried to remove \"xscreensaver\" package, but didn't have it installed at all. So this solves \nEDIT:\nWhat I learned so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*this is not magic. it affects other people as well\n\n*it is caused by a bug in Xfce power manager:\n\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-power-manager/+bug/1193716\n\nA: This solution is a combination of @Jeroen's solution and @A lubuntu user solution.\nThe root cause, I believe, is that the user-specific light-locker.desktop file doesn't override the system-wide one.  So, even if the user configures light-locker to not start at all, it still runs with the default configuration parameters.\nWarning: This will disable system-wide default screen locking.  If you want to enable locking for a specific user, you'll need to edit the Exec= line in the ~/.config/autostart/light-locker.desktop file for each user.  Configuring this through \"Preferences >> Light Locker Settings\" may do this (once the system-wide file is moved out of the way), but I haven't tried this.\nStep 1: Disable system-wide startup of light-locker.  This will allow the per-user .desktop file to be executed instead.\n\nsudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/light-locker.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/light-locker.desktop.bak\n\nTo re-enable this, you would just rename the file so it no longer has the .bak extension.\nStep 2: Edit the user-specific light-locker.desktop file\nOpen ~/.config/autostart/light-locker.desktop in a text editor.\nEdit the line that begins Exec= so it is only Exec=. That is, there is no command specified which means light-locker won't be started.\nStep 3: Reboot.\n\nA: I have found what seems a folder for autostart applications: ~/.config/autostart. In my computer, there is a .desktop file for the screen locker (light-locker.desktop). It is a sort of shortcut. If you want to know more about .desktop files and how to create  entries for the applications menu, read this article of the wiki of LXDE which is the Desktop of Lubuntu.\nThe .desktop files put in the right folder create entries for the applications menu and I suspect in this folder they start applications when the user logs in. I am not sure, but users with different autostart programs have different \"shorcuts\" in this folder.\nI think it is worth checking your light-locker.desktop file in case the problem was that your Lubuntu installation was not able to modified it when you use the light-locker settings app.\nI have also found out that users with different configurations of Light locker have different light-locker.desktop files. As sensible, the only difference is the \"exec\" line, which determines which app or command is executed and its arguments or options. I mean clicking on an application menu entry is similar to run its \"exec\" line in a shell or terminal. It is quite easy to create a new app entry for a program in the menu. I have done this task several times.\nThe .desktop files can be edited by opening them with leafpad which is the default plain text editor in Lunbuntu. If you do not save any change, nothing will be modified.\nThe \"exec\" line is something like this:\nExec=light-locker --lock-after-screensaver=0 --lock-on-suspend --no-late-locking.\nIf you want to know what arguments light-locker has got, you can open a shell and run info light-locker. I must note there are not all of its arguments. From my point of view, that information should be improved if the developers have the chance.\nHowever, there are several users in my Lubuntu installation and they have different Light-locker settings. I can confirm you that the following options are right:\n1) If you want Light-locker to lock the screen when you suspend the computer:\nExec=light-locker --lock-after-screensaver=0 --lock-on-suspend --no-late-locking. \n2) It you do not want the previous option:\nExec=light-locker --lock-after-screensaver=0 --no-lock-on-suspend --no-late-locking. \nA \"exec\" line without --lock-after-screensaver=0 or --no-late-locking can cause the functionality you have described in your computer. You can check it by running info light-locker as I said before.\nOtherwise, you could move the light-locker.desktop onto other folder and reboot to try. Before doing this latest suggestion, you'd better ask in the Lubuntu mailing list. There are people with a deeper knowledge of this OS.\n\nA: This solved the problem for me:\nsudo apt-get purge light-locker light-locker-settings\n\nthe answer as been modified as suggested from kbuilds and muru\n\nA: Do you know the autostart applications are selected in \"default application for LXSession\" in preferences sub-menu (for Lubuntu 14.04)? I can see the screensaver and \"screenlocker\" applications checked there, but I have never tried disabling it.\n\nA: I got it to work properly based on this answer, but in newer versions of Lubuntu (15.10 in my case) there is another option that needs to be included.\nMy Exec line is:\nExec=light-locker --lock-after-screensaver=0 --lock-on-suspend --no-late-locking --no-lock-on-lid\n\nNow the options in \"power manager\" work properly.\n\nA: This solved the problem for me:\nsudo rm /etc/xdg/autostart/light-locker.desktop\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu server 14.04 can't update internet problem I recently installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu server 14.04.

In brief, help me to understand the use of the above commands.\n\nA: APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) is a management system for software packages. Usually used as root/sudo user. The usual command is apt-get, but with Ubuntu 14.04, there's also the apt tool: What is the difference between apt and apt-get?\n1. sudo apt-get update:\n\n\n*\n\n*\n  update\n       update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources. The indexes of available packages are\n       fetched from the location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list. For example, when using a Debian archive, this\n       command retrieves and scans the Packages.gz files, so that information about new and updated packages is available.\n       An update should always be performed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade. Please be aware that the overall progress\n       meter will be incorrect as the size of the package files cannot be known in advance.\n\n\n*After changing /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/preferences or adding/removing repositories, you have to run this command to make apt aware of your changes.\n\n*Run this command periodically to make sure your source list is up-to-date. This is the equivalent of \"Reload\" in Synaptic.\n\n*apt update is equivalent.\n\n\n2. sudo apt-get upgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n* upgrade\n       upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources\n       enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and\n       upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed\n       retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the\n       install status of another package will be left at their current version. An update must be performed first so that\n       apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.\n\n\n*This command upgrades all installed packages. This is the equivalent of \"Mark all upgrades\" in Synaptic.\n3. sudo apt-get dist-upgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*\ndist-upgrade\n       dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with\n       new versions of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most\n       important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade command may therefore remove\n       some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package\n       files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual packages.\n\n\n*It tells APT to use \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary.\n\n*apt-get dist-upgrade does not perform distribution upgrade. visit this for upgrading.\n\n*apt full-upgrade is equivalent.\n\n\n4. sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*\ndselect-upgrade\n       dselect-upgrade is used in conjunction with the traditional Debian packaging front-end, dselect(1).  dselect-upgrade\n       follows the changes made by dselect(1) to the Status field of available packages, and performs the actions necessary\n       to realize that state (for instance, the removal of old and the installation of new packages).\n\n\n*Visit man-page of dpkg in order to get information through --get-selections, --set-selections and --clear-selections.\n\n\n5. sudo do-release-upgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nUpgrade  the  operating system to the **latest release** from the command-line.  This is the preferred command if the machine\n   has no graphic environment or if the machine is to be upgraded over a remote connection.\n\n\n*Use -d, --devel-release to check if upgrading to the latest devel release is possible\n\n*Recommended to visit Community Upgrade Help.\n\n\n\nNote: All Information is provided with use of manpages, and community help as a reference/source.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 / Unity- onboard utility (on-screen keyboard) - desktop icon I would like to have some easier way to launch \"onboard\" (on-screen keyboard utility).\nOnce onboard is launched it conveniently sits on a service bar (would be nice to have some improvements there too) but before it is activated one needs to search for it in installed applications every time ubuntu is started.\nI would like to place onboard launcher on the desktop (as it never appears in launcher bar so onboard cannot be locked to it)\nI have tried various recipes (including making symbolic links) but none is working for me.\nIs it somehow possible to create a desktop icon to start onboard when it is not started?\n\nA: You can Find \"On Board\" Desktop file form following location:\n/usr/share/applications/:\n$ cat /usr/share/applications/onboard.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Onboard\nGenericName=Onboard onscreen keyboard\nComment=Flexible onscreen keyboard for GNOME\nExec=onboard\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Utility;Accessibility;\n#NotShowIn=GNOME;\n#NotShowIn=GNOME;Unity;\nNoDisplay=false\nMimeType=application/x-onboard;\nIcon=onboard\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=onboard\n\nDrag It to Launcher!\n\n", "Q: What to do so that issue.net shows readable banner characters to chinese russian french ssh users I set up my ssh server and added custom issue.net config. when loggin, it shows \\320\\237\\320\\264\\321.... for characters other than ascii-7\nIs it a client side issue or do I manage this at server side?\n\nA: It is not possible for the banner to have non-ASCII characters. ssh filters non-ascii characters and prints them as octal text.

Unfortunatly I can not make it work with my Ubuntu 14.04 Laptop.\nWhat I have done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Bluetooth on my Laptop\n\n*Run the bluetooth-wizard command\n\n*Select the Mini JamBox device\n\n\nAfter one minute, the wizard display an error message:\n\nFailed to connect to the device...\n\nI also have the following log:\n(bluetooth-wizard:18445): Bluetooth-WARNING **: CreateDevice failed: GDBus.Error:org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed: Page Timeout\n\n** (bluetooth-wizard:18445): WARNING **: Setting up 'MINIJAMBOX by Jawbone' failed: GDBus.Error:org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed: Page Timeout\n\nAny idea ? \n\nA: I had the same issue with Ubuntu 14.04, and I found that these steps were necessary with a fully updated system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add Disable = Media in the [general] section to /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf (sudo vim /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf)\n\n*And make sure bluez-tools is installed (sudo apt-get install bluez-tools)\n\n*Also make sure to restart the bluetooth service, just in case (sudo service bluetooth restart)\n\n*Then connect your Jawbone device, it should now pair successfully.\n\n*Now, the change to audio.conf we made earlier seems to prevent the device to show up in the list of audio devices. What you need to do it to remove the line we added (Disable = Media), then restart the bluetooth service, and your device should now show up in the list of audio devices! Make sure it's turned on in the Bluetooth manager, it might be off after restarting the service.\n\n*One last note, you have to change the audio setting from HSP/HFP to A2DP, otherwise the sound might be crappy ...\n\n\nYour mileage may vary, good luck!\n\nA: Download the Synaptic Package Manager and look for additional bluetooth libraries to download.\nIt worked with my minijambox.\n", "Q: Shell script not working For a suggested solution in another topic I tried to write my first shell script.

Before, everything worked just fine, but as soon as I opened a mkv-Video in VLC, the audio for the whole system stopped working.\nAfter that I removed VLC and any plugins that have been installed with it, rebooted, but nothing changed.\nNeither my monitor speakers nor my headset is working anymore, so I think it might be a problem with pulseaudio.\nEDIT\nHere is a screenshot of my sound settings. Also to mention, my monitor speakers are hooked up to my nvidia graphics card via HDMI. (Newest graphics drivers are installed).\n\nANOTHER EDIT\nI just noticed that YouTube videos also won't play anymore, neither video nor sound. It just freezes at the first frame, continues buffering but doesn't play.\nI recently installed flashplayer, but removed it again because it was causing problems. So I'm using the native HTML5-Player of YouTube. I tried both Firefox and Chrome.\n\nA: I just solved the problem by myself.\nI once edited /etc/pulse/default.pa to disable the module-suspend-on-idle, because the first 0.5-1 second of each sound output was cut off. Guess I rather accept that than no sound.\nAs it turned out, I did this just before I launched VLC for the first time. Sorry for blaming you VLC ;)\nYouTube now works again as well.\n", "Q: How to correctly restore factory condition on ACER laptop? I have installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 (dual-boot).

The only problem I'm facing now is to configure the bootloader. I'm quite familiar with Ubuntu, but not with grub or bootloaders in general. This system has UEFI, and Windows 8.1 is still installed on the harddisk. Ubuntu is installed on partition sda9, but it does not boot. When I remove the usb stick with the live install, Windows boots. \nI followed these two guides:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Linux Mint 17 from USB on Flex 10?: Cigydd answers his own question with 11 steps. I succeeded to step 7.\n\n*Ubuntu (or other Linux) on the Asus Transformer Book T100: I started at step 4, and got stuck here.\n\n\nSee the Ubuntu Pastebin for Root-repair\nBounty\nI've put a 50 point bounty on this question, but haven't awarded it because the answers didn't help me any further. I will award 50 points again if an answer here helps me get this working. \nEFI firmware\n\n\n*\n\n*The Flex 10 has a 32-bit efi firmware, which complicates things a bit.\n\n*Following above guides, I've downloaded bootia32.efi and put it on the ubuntu stick in /EFI/BOOT.\n\n*In the same folder I see two other files: BOOTx64.EFI and grubx64.efi.\n\n\nProblem\nI'm stuck in the second guide, step 4, with the following line: \nlinux (hd2,gpt5)/boot/vmlinuz-3.13-xxxx root=/dev/mmcblk0p5 video=VGA-1:1368x768e reboot=pci,force\n\nThe partition is hd2, gpt9 if I'm correct. Strangely enough, it seems I need to leave a space after the comma: \nlinux (hd2, gpt9)/boot/...\n\nUsing the live system, I found the vmlinuz version: \n/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-32-generic\n/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-32-generic.efi.signed\n\nI don't know what to do with the root=/dev/... setting.

I misunderstand, but I read I should copy bootia32.efi to the disk. To what folder? I don't see an EFI folder in the root of the installed system. \n\n\nA: Ugh, first order of business problably would be finding the root device. I've never seen the naming you seem to be having. Can you give the output of\n\ncat /proc/partitions\n\nand\n\nmount\n\nThat will probably help getting the root partition's name.\nSince EFI boot comes with its own bag of troubles, would you accept a solution wherein you install the grub bootloader on your linux partition (so not MBR or anything) and chainboot from the Windows Loader into grub via Windows Loader Menu? If so, what you'd need to do is install grub into the current linux root partition, copy the first 512 bytes out via dd into a file and copy that file over to Windows' system drive. From there it's a few commands for the bcd (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc721886%28v=ws.10%29.aspx ) to add the grub bootloader now in a file to the Windows startup list, although I've never done it on an EFI system.\n", "Q: How to launch interactive shell script in bash hourly with cron? I put this line in the crontab:\n1 * * * * DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/gnome-terminal -e /home/user/Desktop/mltpl\n\nThe script is executable.\nIf paste that command in the terminal--that is, the string without stars, it works perfectly:\nDISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/gnome-terminal -e /home/user/Desktop/mltpl\n\nI tried:\nsudo service cron restart\n\nBut the problem persists. How can I get cron to run that command hourly?\n\nUpdate. Got it working with ROOT crontab:\n1 * * * * DISPLAY=:0 XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 XAUTHORITY=/home/user/.Xauthority /usr/bin/gnome-terminal -e /home/user/Desktop/mltpl\n\n\nA: I guess my first guess about the way the DISPLAY variable is handled is wrong. I think the problem somehow related to cron using a non-interactive shell. A test script using an infinite read loop failed to run. However, when I tested by opening a new tab:\n* * * * * DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/gnome-terminal --tab -e /home/murukesh/test.sh\n\nit worked fine.\n\nAccording to this SU question and this Ubuntu Forums post, you may have to either export the $DISPLAY variable or use env:\n1 * * * * env DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/gnome-terminal -e /home/user/Desktop/mltpl\n\n(or)\n1 * * * * export DISPLAY=:0.0 && /usr/bin/gnome-terminal -e /home/user/Desktop/mltpl\n\nThis maybe due to the shell used by cron being sh and not bash (see What's the difference between set, export and env and when should I use each?).\nAlso have a look at Script doesn't run via crontab but works fine standalone.\n", "Q: How can I make my WiFi hotspot secure? I just created a wifi hotspot with an adaptor, and it says that it uses WEP security.\n\nI may be mistaken, but isn't WEP security not really secure? How can I make it more secure, such as WPA or WPA2? I'm quite concerned that someone could access my computer(s).\n\nEdit\nI don't want an answer that is a cure rather than a prevention. I would like stronger encryption, not to individually block people who intrude - by then they may have my data.\nIt would be acceptable to only allow certain mac address, but I would need an approval process, so that guests could connect to the WiFi without finding their mac addresses.\n\nA: First of all : \nIn security terms, in the absolute : Wifi or any wireless data system cannot be secured. This is due to the fact that anyone can \"ear\" you and then \"decypher\" you.\nIt means that, if the hacker want to and have the knowledge : he will always win in a short time.\nThe only thing that you can get is getting the work of hacking you harder.\nThat being said, Here is the recommendations without being too specific :\nYou are actually connected via WEP and I assume that you use TKIP. Those settings have to be changed directly with the device that provides you Wifi. This must be done first to be able to use something else.\nMost of those devices are the Wifi of the DSL box of your provider and mostly only have those settings available. If it's the case : you must purchase a modern Wifi Access Point that you will wire connect to this box in order to shutdown the wifi of the box and use the wifi of the access point you set.\nIf you can change your wifi settings or purchased a new wifi access point :\nWARNING : Any modification in the wifi device will cause disconnection.

I have a laptop with 14.04 installed on it, and I've had Ubuntu on this machine since 12.04. I notice that I have \"duplicates\" (old versions) of some programs, namely update manager, belonging to both the older versions and the new. Is there a good way to clean these out of here?\n\nA: Unfortunately I can't give you an answer to your problem, but I can give you some tips to try to understand what's happening.\nWhen you upgraded your system all the applications installed with apt-get/Software Center had to be also upgraded, and when a package is upgraded it replaces the previous version, so I really don't know how you can have 2 versions of Update Manager.\nIf any of those apps where manually installed, then you may have two versions (the one you manually installed and one managed by the system). In this case just remove one and use the other.\nRegarding the duplicate launchers: they are stored in /usr/share/applications (system-wide) and ~/.local/share/applications (only visible to your user). You can check those two locations and see if there are no duplicated launchers.\nIf you have problems identifying which launcher belongs to each application, you can launch each duplicated item and run the following command in a terminal:\n$ xprop | grep DESKTOP_FILE\n\nYour cursor will change to a cross. Then click in the window of that application. You may get (not all applications give you this information) an output similar the following:\n$ xprop | grep DESKTOP_FILE\n_NET_WM_DESKTOP_FILE(STRING) = \"/usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop\"\n\nIn my case I clicked in the terminal window.

I've created a bootable backup of my Ubuntu to an external USB hard drive.  I can now boot to my external backup from grub when grub is loaded from my internal hard drive, but I cannot boot to grub on the external hard drive.  After telling my PC BIOS to boot from USB, I just get the message \"Reboot and select proper boot device\".  The external USB hard drive is a \"WD My Passport Ultra 1TB drive\".\nHere's the steps I've taken to get this far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleted and recreated the msdos partition table on the external drive.\n\n*Created partitions as follows..\nModel: WD My Passport 0820 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sdb: 1000GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size   Type     File system  Flags\n 1      1049kB  483GB   483GB  primary  ext3         boot\n 2      483GB   698GB   215GB  primary  fat32\n 3      698GB   1000GB  302GB  primary  ntfs\n\nwhich results in this:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 1000.2 GB, 1000170586112 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121597 cylinders, total 1953458176 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00019d8c\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *        2048   943720447   471859200   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb2       943720448  1363150847   209715200    b  W95 FAT32\n/dev/sdb3      1363150848  1953458175   295153664    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nThe second and third partitions are for other, non-Linux, backups.\n\n*Used rsync to copy my entire Ubuntu, from the root on down, to the external drive on /dev/hdb1 (my Ubuntu backup partition), largely using this as my guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Full_system_backup_with_rsync\n\n*Modified the backup's /etc/fstab (i.e. /media/LinuxBackup/etc/fstab where /media/LinuxBackup is the mount point for /dev/sdb1) to have just two entries:\nproc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0\nUUID=ba0ad23c-1625-4dbf-ae50-0e4e68f469a6 /               ext3    relatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\nwhere the above UUID is the UUID of /dev/sdb1.\n\n*In the internal drive's Ubuntu partition (/dev/hda7), I modified /boot/grub/menu.lst to include the following entry:\ntitle       USB BOOT, Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS, kernel 3.2.0-67-generic\nuuid        ba0ad23c-1625-4dbf-ae50-0e4e68f469a6\nkernel      /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-67-generic root=UUID=ba0ad23c-1625-4dbf-ae50-0e4e68f469a6 ro quiet splash \ninitrd      /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-67-generic\nquiet\n\n\n*I rebooted and selected the above entry and successfully booted into Ubuntu off of the external hard drive.  I confirmed this by checking that /dev/sdb1 is mounted as / (rather than /dev/sda7, as it is when booting from the internal drive).\n\n*I attempted to load grub into the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the external hard drive by running:\n# sudo grub-install /dev/sdb\n\nThis ran successfully.\n\n*I rebooted, changed my PC BIOS to boot only from USB, expecting grub to appear, but instead got \"Reboot and select proper boot device\", making it seem as though grub is not on the external drive.\nI'm now at a bit of a loss.  Could this be a problem with my motherboard's BIOS or with My Passport Ultra?\n\nA: In step 8 in my question I indicated that I \"changed my PC BIOS to boot only from USB\".  That is, I went into my BIOS setup, made the USB device my first boot device, and disabled all others.\nAfter much head scratching and experimenting with Ubuntu and grub in order to understand why this wasn't working, I eventually tried pressing F8 at initial boot to get my PC's Boot Selection Popup.  From there, I selected the USB hard drive and voila!.. the grub menu I configured on the USB drive appeared and I could use the Ubuntu on my external drive, ignoring the internal drive completely.\nI still don't understand why this works when using my BIOS' Boot Selection Popup but it does not work when selecting the USB device as the first boot device in my BIOS setup.  However, that is clearly not a Ubuntu or grub issue, but rather something wrong with my motherboard's BIOS (I'm using an ASUS P5KPL-CM).\n", "Q: Deleted Ubuntu, can't boot anything The Ubuntu (14.04) partition was deleted, and now I can't boot Windows.

Try restarting to see if the GUI works.\n\nTo copy files, first we will identify your USB drive and mount it, if it wasn't automounted. Do:\nlsblk\n\nThis will list connected drives in a tree form, listing sizes and mount points. Your USB drive is likely to be sdb (and the partition on it sdb1). If there is no mount point listed next to it (it's a path like /media/My Drive), we will mount it manually:\nsudo mount -o rw,uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -u),umask=022 -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt \n\n(I am assuming your hard drive is using the NTFS filesystem - if not remove everything between mount and /dev/sdb1.)\nNow, the real trouble is locating your files. I am pretty sure they are in your home directory, and your home directory is not on a separate partition. (If it is, copying stuff from home directory won't help with the low space issue.)\nFirst make a directory to hold your backups (not necessary, but good for organizing):\nmkdir /mnt/backup\n\nNow you can move stuff from a folder in your home directory (say Documents):\nmv ~/Documents /mnt/backup\n\n", "Q: juju add a unit to a pending agent I do have a service with a unit pending because theres no machines to add that unit.\nAfter I add a machine, how to assign the pending unit to that machine?\nI've searched under google and in the official documentations, but with no success.\n\nA: It sounds like you're using a manual registration process. \nIt might be easier to add the machine first, THEN add the service with --to <machine>.

I have some functional scripts and I want to copy to /usr/bin I want to use them as normal terminal commands. Is it a good practice to use them with the .sh extension or can I save them without extension? \n\nA: No, it is not a good practice, you should keep your scripts without extension. Note, that scripts being part of packages doesn't have a .sh extension, i.e. update-grub, not update-grub.sh. If you are still not convinced, then be advised, that Google Shell Style Guide says:\n\nExecutables should have no extension (strongly preferred) or a .sh extension. Libraries must have a .sh extension and should not be executable.\n\nPS You don't have to put your script into /bin. You can create directory ~/bin and put your script there. Directory ~/bin is included in $PATH by default, so scripts put there can be run as any other shell command.\n\nA: Just put following line at top of file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSo-that file will be automatically type : Shell Script without any extension!\nRemember to give execution permission to file.\nFor putting script so-that can be run by direct command, visit: Where should I put my script so that I can run it by a direct command?\n\nA: I second the recommendation to use ~/bin which gets automatically added to your $PATH,as Sergey said. Or /usr/local/bin, which may already be on the PATH.\nHowever:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are doing this for yourself. Use whatever you feel comfortable with. Indeed, I'd say keep the extension so that you'll be reminded it's your script you are running, since -\n\n*Extensions are uncommon in /usr/bin. In my system, I can find only two:\n$ dpkg -S `ls /usr/bin/*.sh`\nmtools: /usr/bin/amuFormat.sh\ngettext-base: /usr/bin/gettext.sh\n\nSo if you are packaging, definitely leave out the extension.\n\nA: Your scripts and the commands that run them don't need to have the same name\nI agree with the opinions and advice in other answers here, in that typed commands shouldn't have an extension (mycmd, not mycmd.sh), and that editors should be able to identify the file contents from the shebang line (e.g. #!/bin/bash).\nHowever, if the scripts are part of a larger project, I find it useful to have file name extensions on them to remind myself whether the files in the repo are editable (e.g. scripts, source code), or compiled binary files.\nTo achieve both aims, you can symlink your scripts from the directory on your PATH. E.g. if ~/.local/bin is on your PATH:\ncd ~/.local/bin\nln -s ../../path/to/code/project/src/mycmd.sh mycmd\n\n# now mycmd is on the PATH, and calling mycmd runs the script mycmd.sh\ncd somewhere/else\nmycmd\n\nThis also allows you to do version control from ~/path/to/code/project/, without then having to copy the files into a directory on your PATH when you do a \"release\".\n", "Q: Can't connect to wifi14.04 I recently moved back home, and for some reason my laptop can't connect to my wifi.It used to connect to it after some time, but now it just stopped.

I installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS to the HDD. I was recently playing with the motherboard settings, which included Disabling Secure Boot, Enabling Fast Boot Mode, And running ASUS Optimal Tuning. But after doing all of that, Ubuntu Failed to start. Sometimes I was stuck looking at the Ubuntu splash screen, sometimes I was looking at a blank screen, and Sometimes my monitor would turn off saying that there was no video signal. I discovered later that restoring my motherboard to factory settings (excluding Secure Boot) made Ubuntu work again. Is there any way for me to take advantage of using all of the goodies this motherboard has to offer without it breaking my system?\n\nA: I have the same motherboard and I would recommend to:\n\n\n*\n\n*First learn the impact the change on the Motherboard settings will have. This is not only affecting Ubuntu but also any other operating system because you are literally changing how the hardware will behave.\n\n*There are changes that can not be done AFTER you have install an operating system. For example disabling Secure Boot or EFI settings after an operating system was installed will confuse the OS since it thinks that \"Wait a minute, I was installed with secure boot... What happened to it?? Am I crazy???!!\"\n\n*In the case of Ubuntu stuck on the boot process is because the motherboard told Ubuntu when you did the installation what type of environment it would have, what type of settings it should set by default and how it should behave to have a correct boot process. Changing that will simply make the boot process fail because the settings that it had do not correlate with the ones of the motherboard.\n\n*Fast Boot disables several things (Depending how faster you want to boot). It could have disabled USB, FLoppy or even Sata connections not in use, but it could also disabled critical ACPI o APIC settings needed for the correct boot.\n\n*The Asus Optimal Tuning is NOT recommended for systems that have already being installed. It changes so many variables. From memory clock frequency to sleep states, to cpu clock rates and more. If the system already had a fix setting for this, or even a dynamic one, the tuning would make a chaos of it. The same case happens with Windows 7 or 8 systems that the user wants to tweak but does not know the whole scenario of outcomes it can lead, some of which are literally burning the CPU, blowing a capacitor on the motherboard or damaging the memory (All cases I have seen first hand, the worst was the CPU on fire).\nYou do not need to tweak that many settings. You can change the fast boot to a moderate setting and do a firmware update which can about 2 weeks ago: http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Z97A/HelpDesk_Download/\nwhich offer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Improve system stability\n\n*Improve System performance\n\n*Enhance accuracy for DRAM frequency\n\n*And more...\n\n\nBut other than that, if you love the motherboard, don't try tuning it to have more power, because if something I had learned from that is that you can actually get more power, but you pay with lifetime. So the motherboard instead of lasting 5, 6 or 6 years in top shape. It would last 1 or 2 years, afterwards you would wonder why it resets or turns itself off randomly.\n", "Q: How to remove Windows bootoption that results in 'wubildr.mbr'/0xc000007b error message? At one point I tried to install Ubuntu onto my hard drive without a USB or a CD. It is a Windows 8 computer. It didn't work, so I eventually gave up and did it with a USB.

(I don't see how UNetBootin is involved here until this point.) \nSo you seem to have two Ubuntu installations and the Wubi one does not boot (due to relying on legacy booting were UEFI booting is done - but I don't know much about this topic and am just guessing here).\nIf that is the case, which means that you can confirm that you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can boot Windows without errors.\n\n*Can boot Ubuntu without errors.\n\n\nThen you should continue with:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I remove wubi?\nRelated question that explains more than necessary and troubleshoots issues that you already solved yourself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nFor more details see the tag info page of the Wubi tag.\n", "Q: Is there a diff. or inc. backup with universal viewability Is there such a thing as a differential or incremental backup where you don't need a specific program - just a file browser - to view (the most recent/the least recent/any version of) backed-up files?\nAlso, is there any list of backup software/methods online where each entry says whether it saves the backup in a way that it can be easily viewed in a file browser? (or how specifically it saves the backup)\n\nA: Two good references for different backup methods:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/jmburgess/Backup\nHow to backup settings and list of installed packages\nI use the 'rsync' method myself, because I can simply view the backup files in a file browser.\nThe script I use for backup is as follows:\n#!/bin/bash\ndpkg --get-selections > ~/backupData/Package.list\nsudo cp -R /etc/apt/sources.list* ~/backupData/\nsudo apt-key exportall > ~/backupData/Repo.keys\nrsync --progress --delete -a /home/chick/ /media/chick/Lbck/backup\n\nThis has the possibly questionable advantage of also backing up the list of installed packages, and everything in my home directory, onto a USB HDD.\nPlease note that this is not an exclusive list of how to do backups, but a pretty good list of inexpensive methods.  What is important here is that you have a backup to prevent those little times in life when everything goes south.\nIf you have the resources available, multiple backups using different backup methods is a great idea.\n", "Q: Does nvidia-prime do automatic switching in 14.04?

If you do click on the \"Technical details about this PPA\" link you see:\nSigning key:\n4096R/7BB9C367\n\nFingerprint:\n6125E2A8C77F2818FB7BD15B93C4A3FD7BB9C367\n\nIf you try to add that software without adding the key you get\nW: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net trusty Release: The following signatures couldn't\nbe verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 93C4A3FD7BB9C367\n\nWhen I do apt-key list I see 4096R/7BB9C367. To add the key I need to do:\napt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 93C4A3FD7BB9C367\n\nAnd the fingerprint doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere. What is the difference between all these values?\nWhy do I not need to do apt-key ... --recv-keys if adding the PPA but I need to if manually adding the line to /etc/apt/sources.list.d? How does PPA know that 93C4A3FD7BB9C367 is what it needs to use, where does it find this?\nBonus round:\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between using a PPA vs just adding a line to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/?\n\n*Where is this PPA thing 'hosted' that just adding ppa:ansible/ansible is enough to add that line to sources.list.d?\n\n\nA: I'll start with your last question.\nppa:ansible/ansible is a special format that refers to Launchpad PPAs and can be used in Ubuntu and Ubuntu derivatives (at least). In terms of functionality, a PPA is just a regular repo. However, this exact format can't just be added into /etc/apt/sources.list, since apt doesn't recognize this format. Therefore, the URL to the repo has to be added. For example, the URL for ppa:teamName/archiveName is http://ppa.launchpad.net/teamName/archiveName/ubuntu.\nTypically, either Software Updater or the terminal is used to add a PPA. Software Updater recognizes the PPA syntax. In terminal, apt-add-repository recognizes the format and is typically used to add a PPA. This also gets the public key that is used to sign the repo. If, for some reason, it isn't able to, you'll get a similar warning that you got when running sudo apt-get update.\nAs for the fingerprint, the full fingerprint of a public-key is a 40-character alphanumeric representation of the public key. Launchpad shows the full 40 characters. However, typing or remembering 40 characters is difficult, especially when there are multiple public keys. Therefore, typically the last 8 or 16 characters are shown. apt is showing the last 16 characters of the fingerprint, and apt-key list (which uses gpg behind the scenes) is showing the last 8. The format to show in gpg can be configured.\n", "Q: How to extend/increase ubuntu disk space on a dual boot win7/ubuntu 12.4 I have installed Windows 7 and ubuntu 12.04 as dual boot on my 320 GB laptop. \nI have three partitions. \n200 GB - Window's 7 is installed in it. \n100 GB - NTFS partition (un used). \n20 GB - Ubuntu 12.04.\nI can access 100 GB (new volume) both in windows and ubuntu 12.04.\nI am running out of ubuntu disk space.

I would like to run a desktop Ubuntu VM on top of (desktop or server) Ubuntu host; all the while looking like it is running on the bare metal. The reason for this is I would like to relegate critical processes to the host machine; where I can not disrupt their operation (I could, but I would have to specifically log in to the host system to do that; and most of the time I will be working in the VM instead) and where they won't be troubled by such things as system restarts.\nI'd like to use KVM virtualization, as that's what I'm familiar on the server.\nI think I'll need VGA passthrough for near-native performance? Can I do that on a laptop with just an integrated Intel graphics card?\nI prefer command-line solutions that can be automated.\n\nA: You are looking for Linux Containers:\n\nContainers are a lightweight virtualization technology. They are more akin to an enhanced chroot than to full virtualization like Qemu or VMware, both because they do not emulate hardware and because containers share the same operating system as the host. Therefore containers are better compared to Solaris zones or BSD jails.\n\nLXC is very lightweight, so it's most common application is to have a container for each service. This means you can save up on a lot of space and other resources, since nothing is allocated unless needed. However, that doesn't mean it's the only way to use it.  For example, Docker is a service built on LXC, for packaging and deploying complete apps.\nLXc can be used for running GUI apps, or even X itself. This Unix & Linux answer has a guide. Essentially:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install any requisite drivers on both host and container systems.\n\n*Make the device nodes available to the container, creating them via mknod if necessary.\n\n*Configure them (the OP did it manually, since udev isn't available in the container).\n\n*Start X on an unused VT.\n\n\nHowever, in your case, where you want things to Just Work and don't mind using the VM for everything X, you can use KVM with libvirt. Check the official Server Guide.\n\nA: The VM's are intended to appear as bare metal machines.  You shouldn't notice any difference except for the restrictions that you actually place on your VM.\nYou might consider running your VM and posting questions of how to resolve any issue you might encounter.  Most likely there will be a resolution to provide specifically what you might need, such as more video memory, lower level access to the hardware, etc.\nTo boot full screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*While in your VM OS, of virtual box, select the full screen\noption.\n\n*Right click on the Virtual box profile of your preferred OS and\nclick \"Create Desktop Launcher\".\n\n*Grab the exec command from the created launch and make a batch\nfile such indicated below\n\n*Add the created created batch file your Ubuntu startup\napplications.\n\n*Configure (from Ubuntu's user's manager) to boot the Ubuntu with\nthe Automatic Login activated.\n\n\nBatch file for Startup Applications (mystartvm.sh):\n#!/bin/bash                                                                     \n\nsleep 20                                                                        \n/usr/lib/virtualbox/VirtualBox --startvm \"ec9329a2-d86a-45ba-9dbe-cdd0d8e5c74b\"\n\nYou can fine tune any step for your preference.

I wanted to install a dual boot with Ubuntu, but the Ubuntu installer did not give me the option to \"Install alongside Windows\". I continued the installation and I lost Windows 8 (a little evil). Then I decided I wanted to start over and do a dual boot with Windows 7. When I rebooted the computer to start Windows 7, the computer gave me an error saying that the security settings did not allow to start the disk.\nSo I entered the UEFI firmware and I removed the safety lock; however, the computer would not let me install Windows 7. So I changed the BIOS mode in Legacy (I was right) and I finally installed Windows. Then I restarted the computer to install Ubuntu 14.04.1 with the exact same problem starting (I did not check for the next Windows install). Finally I opened the GParted live which gave me an error message saying that probably the GPT partition was erased or corrupted.\nWhat should I do? I only would like to be able to install and use these two operating systems, nothing else. Thank you!\n\nA: When the installer asks whether you’d like to Install Ubuntu alongside another operating system, OR delete your existing operating system and replace it with Ubuntu, choose the Something else option.\nCreate partitions using the Ubuntu Installer\nDual Boot Partioning Guide\n\nIn general, a Windows 'should' be installed first, because it tends to\n  ignore other operating systems and does not include them in it's\n  boot-menu. Also Windows installers tend to overwrite the entire\n  hard-drive (potentially wiping out any other data stored on it).\n\nHere's my dual boot setup. Though I've never had a reason to install Windows.\n\n\nA: You've made one change after another, each of which fixed one problem and created a new one. At the moment, you've probably got a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode installation of Windows on an MBR disk, but with leftover GPT data because the Windows partitioning software does not completely erase GPT data when doing a GPT-to-MBR conversion. This setup confuses libparted (upon which the Ubuntu installer's partitioner is based), leading to the symptom you're seeing. The solution is to erase the leftover GPT data. The easiest and safest way to do this is to use FixParts, which is included in the Ubuntu gdisk package. (There's also a Windows version available, in case you want to run it from there.) In brief, when you run the program, it will note the presence of leftover GPT data and ask if you want to remove it. Respond in the affirmative and then exit.\nNote that once this is done, you must boot the Ubuntu installer in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, rather than in the EFI/UEFI mode you probably used before. Typically, if you can get to the firmware's built-in boot manager, you should select the option to boot your medium that lacks the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI.\" If you accidentally boot in EFI mode, the Ubuntu installer may refuse to install, may overwrite Windows again, or may install in EFI mode on your MBR disk. (I don't know offhand what it actually does; but none of those three options will be helpful to you.)\n", "Q: Duplicity does not run via anacron in 14.04 Since the implementation of the lockfile option I cannot run duplicity via anacron (https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1320641).

Encrypted swap typically shows up as Unkown in GParted, so if it didn't, something went wrong somewhere.

Is it still in 14.04 or will I have to download the sound? Then how can I make it play? Here's the sound I'm talking about.\nHow can I also get the shutdown sound too?\n\nA: Seems the old sound is not there any longer, I could not find it in all of *.ogg, *.wav files.\nYou can change the sound yourself:\ncd /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/    \nsudo cp desktop-login.ogg desktop-login.ogg.sav    \nsudo cp ~/Downloads/desired-sound.ogg desktop-login.ogg\n\n\nA: You can download the zipped sounds from my dropbox.\nThe startup sound is a .wav, you can convert it to a .ogg using VLC or Audacity.

Alright, I have an Ubuntu server on which I couldn't connect to my WPA2 secured Wi-Fi network.\nApparently I need wpa-supplicant to be able to connect to it\n(see How do I connect to a WPA wifi network using the command line?), but ironically I can't download it being offline. So, how can I download wpa-supplicant, get it on a USB device and install it on the server? I have no idea so far...\nPS: I only have a Mac as a primary machine, so I can't download it from another Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can doownload most/all packages from the main Ubuntu repositories from http://packages.ubuntu.com. You can search for it from this page, find it from here, and download it from one of these pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*32bit: http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/i386/wpasupplicant/download\n\n*64bit: http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/amd64/wpasupplicant/download\nThe problem here is that some packages it needs may to be downloaded as well - you can test that by trying to install it, and seeing if it exits with any errors.\nAnother way of doing it would be to run apt-get install --print-uris wpasupplicant[1] on the server, and downloading it with the machine that has internet access, and transferring the deb file(s). This will likely be better as it will list other packages it needs as dependencies.\nFor example, it might give on a Ubuntu 14.04 64bit machine http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/w/wpa/wpasupplicant_2.1-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb.\nOnce you have managed to get the needed deb files, you can install it with dpkg -i /PATH/TO/FILE(S).deb. \n1: this will likely only work if the machine has had access to the internet to update the package lists - the print-uris just tells it to print what was going to download instead of downloading it \n\nA: I did run into this problem today. I needed to download the following packages:\nwpasupplicant_2.9-1ubuntu4.3_amd64.deb\nlibnl-route-3-200_3.4.0-1_amd64.deb\nlibpcsclite1_1.8.26-3_amd64.deb\nlibssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb\nI did download it from https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/ . After installation I'm able to connect to internet via WiFi. The server wasn't connected to internet before, its brand new install. It's possible to check what exact package you need to install if you check logs with command grep wpa /var/log/syslog.

Windows 8 uses GPT, so no need to worry about it.\n\nA: Your screen shot mostly obscures the partition table list, but it's clear that you've already got at least partitions 2, 3, and 4, and probably partition 1. On an MBR disk, that means that you either can't create more partitions (if they're all primary) or that you'll be able to create nothing but logical partitions (if one of the existing partitions is an extended partition). My suspicion is that this is the cause of the issue. If so, it's not a problem. Linux can install just fine in logical partitions, so unless you run into another problem (say, if you can't create a partition that's large enough for your needs), you should just ignore this issue.\nMore broadly, keep in mind that installation guides are necessarily written with reference to a limited range of computers. Screen shots, in particular, come from a single computer, and so may reflect details of that computer that are different from what you'll see.

All my music programs and players work fine in XP, but those I loaded into Ubuntu  won't work.

Thanks.\nI found the fix among previous threads: a muted item on the sound card. I can now play an audio disc in VLC from the tray. So far so good.\nI want to establish a library of music in Ubuntu, starting with ripping from my favorite discs,and then downloading from the internet as I have done in Windows XP. I have Brasero and Sound Juicer installed in the Software Centre, but can't figure out how to open either of them.\n\nA: I use KDE, so it works a bit differently than what you have, but I sometimes have the same problems. Sometimes a program gets installed that doesn't place its entry in your menu system where you expect it to be (or, for manual installs, sometimes doesn't get added to the menus at all.)\nNeither of these packages are installed by default on my system, so you may need to open your package manager and install them if they are not already installed. That should automatically add them to your menus as part of the install process.\nThe next thing to do is see if your start menu has any kind of search option and use that to find your application. The two apps you mention are established ones and should be in the menu in a category called something like Multimedia.\nFor your two applications, you shouldn't need to do this, but you can always edit your start menu and add entries for any application you want, even for something as simple as a shell script (which you may learn to write in the future). I do this all the time, but I can't give you the specifics because what I do in KDE won't match your desktop.\nHate to keep bringing up the command system, but regardless of what's going on in your menu system, if you open a terminal and just type\nbrasero &\nOR\nsound-juicer &\nThat's all you need to start it (gui and all) if it's installed correctly (and, if it isn't, you'll get some error messages that are invisible from the gui - which you can use to search the web for a solution or to post to a forum like this to get help for your specific issue.)\nThe \"&\" at the end of the command isn't strictly necessary, but it does free up the terminal so you can use it for something else without first closing brasero or whatever other program you are running.\nAs for music libraries, I would strongly recommend reading up on how the various music players like Amarok, Clementine, Rhythmbox manage your collections. Or, just try them out with a very small collection and make sure everything works as desired before adding a lot more material.\nIf you figure out a good way to organize all your music folders and all the id3 or other tags in your music files before you start building a large collection, it will save you a ton of time from having to reorganize or re-tag the collection later. I learned this one the hard way.\nYou should also check this out with regard to any standalone music players like mp3 players you may have. The ones I use primarily organize everything using the id3 tags and when those are messed up, you can end up with a bunch of tracks from multiple albums listed as by Unknown Artist playing in alphabetical order instead of in the original order.\nOne other note (IMHO): If possible, store your music (and, especially video) files somewhere other than in your root or home partition.\nThese things use a lot of storage and tend to keep growing as you add more content. If they get too big, they can fill up the partition they're stored on. If it's root, then Linux can run out of room and become non-functional. If it's home (and home isn't on the same partition as root), then your applications and some of the system programs may not have room to work and that's almost as bad.\nI make my root and (separate) home partitions relatively small (around 30GB each) and take all the space that's left and make it a partition just for data. If that fills up, it fills up, but it doesn't stop anything else from working.\n", "Q: How to Install QT3 Runtime Library? I was trying to install the driver for my USB modem on Ubuntu 14.04.

Shall I expect some problems when using Qt Creator with Ubuntu intead of Kubuntu?\n\nA: *\n\n*The manual method links to a specific version of Qt Creator. Installing from a PPA would install whatever version it currently provides, and the Ubuntu SDK PPA offers updates - so it might be have some bug fixes (which may in turn create more bugs).\n\n*Installing using apt, which you would if you use a PPA, automatically selects the version for your architecture, so you should get 64-bit by default, unless you specifically call for 32-bit.\n\n*Well, a manually installed program updates itself only if the program supports it. So taking care of updates is easier with PPAs than manually installed apps, in general.

I'm buying a new laptop august 13th, the Asus X551MAV-RCLN06 is the front runner. It has the Intel Celeron N2830 dual core processor, 4 gb ram. The two options with the Live DVD are to use the whole disc or load beside Windows. It says all files will be erased if the whole disc is used. Is the whole disc reformatted in this process, or is it just given a new index? I prefer that the whole drive is returned to zeroes and ones so that there's no chance that Windows can interfere with my computer's functioning. Do I need to do something special for that, or does the Live DVD take care of it? I'm getting the latest Ubuntu, the 14.04LTS. The reason I ask this is that once I reformatted a 500 GB HDD, and it took 36 hours. I know loading Ubuntu only takes an hour or so, and that doesn't seem like enough time to return a HDD to a blank condition before loading the new OS. Thanks!\nPS If there is a good reason for me to load Ubuntu beside Windows, I will entertain doing that. Is there?\n\nA: If you choose to use the whole disk, Ubuntu will use the ext4 filesystem everywhere, meaning anything in NTFS partitions is lost to all but professional recovery tools. Actually zeroing the disk isn't necessary, but if you want to do that, simply run:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda\nWhere /dev/sda is the ID of the disk (check using the lsblk command).\n", "Q: How to compile a SH file so it can be uploaded to PPA Launchpad I want to make a few installation scripts via .SH files, and then upload them to http://launchpad.net? How would I do that?\n\nA: Firstly, you don't compile a .sh file.  What you need to do is create a Debian package for your program to upload to Launchpad PPAs.\nThe packaging guide details all the steps in creating a package.  You ultimately have to create the package from scratch and follow the guide to make sure you meet all the requirements.  There may be simpler how-tos for everything in this question on Ask Ubuntu, it has my two (VERY BASIC) how-tos, which will walk you through creation of the package, but it does violate a lot of the packaging requirements, including manpages, etc.\nHowever.  As someone who has made administration scripts myself, it may be more prudent to just provide users the .sh scripts and run them themselves from wherever they want, rather than install them as if they were an executable, either in a bzr repository or a git repository somewhere.\n", "Q: External monitor horizontal lines problem I got problem with my external monitor (Dell U2312HM) connected to my laptop (Radeon HD4570).

Most all the instructions I've come across don't seem to mention anything other than when I reboot I should be given the option to choose to run it or windows...not sure if this is before or after the installer should be done or how it is to be done. A little help & guidance will be appreciated, thank you.\n\nA: You most likely downloaded an .iso file.  This is a disc image intended for burning to a writable DVD using DVD burning software, most of which is capable of burning in image mode from an .iso file.  Note: you don't just copy the .iso file to a DVD, you burn the .iso in image mode to a DVD.\nIf you do not have a DVD burner, you can alternatively write it to a USB stick either directly (may be difficult on Windows) or using UNetBootin.\nBurning to DVD is a slightly easier route if you can do it.\nOnce you have your DVD or USB stick with bootable Ubuntu on it, you need to just figure out how to get your computer to boot from that.  Then the installer will run.\n", "Q: No Sound After Upgrade to 12.04 HWE Recently I have upgraded my Asus B43s from 12.04 to 12.04 HWE and have lost all audio upon start up.

A lot of commands in Linux take options that are usually specified by a hyphen and then a character, for example -l, -i, or -h.

It never asked for my password when I first used it and I never made one. Every time I try to add or download stuff it always asks for my password that I never made.\nPlease help me.\n\nA: Try this method:  \nFrom this source: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/linux/reset-your-ubuntu-password-easily-from-the-live-cd/\nYou’ll want to boot from your Ubuntu Live CD, choosing “Try Ubuntu without any change to your computer” from the boot menu.\nOnce the system boots, open up a new Terminal window from Applications \\ Accessories and then type in the following command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThis command is used to tell what device name the hard drive is using, which in most cases should be /dev/sda1, but could be different on your system.  \nNow you’ll need to create a directory to mount the hard drive on. Since we’re actually booting off the live cd, the directory doesn’t really get created anywhere.\nsudo mkdir /media/sda\n\nThe next command will mount the hard drive in the /media/sda1 folder.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/sda1\n\nNow it’s time for the command that actually does the magic: chroot. This command is used to open up a shell with a different root directory than the current shell is using, and we’ll pass in the folder where we mounted the hard drive.\nsudo chroot /media/sda1\n\nNow you should be able to use the passwd command to change your user account’s password, and it will be applied to the hard drive since we are using chroot.\npasswd geek\n\nNote that you’ll have to type your username after the passwd command in order to change the right password.\nNow you should be able to reboot your system and log yourself in with your new password.\nIt's worked for me.\n\nA: You could try opening a terminal window by Ctrl+ Alt+ T and run following command:\npasswd\n\nAnd for root:\nsudo passwd\n\nIf there was no password set, you can enter a new one.\nBut I think it is not possible to setup Ubuntu without a password, maybe autologin is enabled, or factory setup was not finished successfully.\n", "Q: Unable to use \"pip install scp\" command in ubuntu 12.04 I am new to the ubuntu/linux world.\nWhile try to run my python script I get the following error:\n    root@ubuntu:/home/haris/Downloads/# python install.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"install.py\", line 35, in <module>\nimport scp\nImportError: No module named scp\n\nSO I tried to run the following command:\nroot@ubuntu:/home/haris/Downloads/ee-scale/tools/os-installer# pip install python-scp\nDownloading/unpacking python-scp\nCannot fetch index base URL http://pypi.python.org/simple/\nCould not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement scp\nNo distributions at all found for scp\nStoring complete log in /root/.pip/pip.log\n\nHow do I install scp on ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: It's just the name - it's called \"scp\", not \"python-scp\":\nUse pip install scp\n\nA: Aah! it turned out to be PROXY issue! disabled it, ran, pip install scp enabled it again Alternatively I could have done: pip install --proxy=\"user:password@server:port\" scp\n", "Q: How to install a Cisco valet connector without internet?

I tried ctrl-alt-shift and back but it isn't working now.\nBill\n\nA: Crouton doesn't give you your typical duel-boot environment, but instead creates a \"chroot\" environment that allows you to run both Chrome OS + Ubuntu (or another distro) simultaneously, without rebooting your computer.\nYou should be able to switch between the two environments via a keyboard shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chrome OS <-> Ubuntu\nPress Ctrl + Alt + Back\n\n*If this fails, try:\nCtrl + Alt + Forward, followed by Ctrl + Alt + Refresh\n\n*For Chromebooks running on an ARM processor, to swap between the two environments use:\nCtrl + Alt + Shift + Back and Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Forward\nIf the keyboard shortcut still fails, you can try opening a Chrome OS terminal, then typing shell into the command line, followed by sudo startunity.\n", "Q: How do I add zero padding to filenames that already have numbers in them? I used Sound Juicer to rip a CD of audio for a language learning book so that I could listen to them on my Android. However, Sound Juicer seems to only have the option of numbering files without leading zeros. Like this:\ntrack_1.mp3\ntrack_10.mp3\ntrack_11.mp3\n\nThis leads to some confused ordering on my music player. So, I want to add some zeros to the name, so that they're ordered properly, like this:\ntrack_01.mp3\ntrack_02.mp3\ntrack_03.mp3\n\nHow do I accomplish this? I tried using GPRename, but while it has the ability to add numbers, it doesn't seem to have any options for adding leading zeros.\nIs there a better program or something I can do at the command line?\n\nA: The script below wil rename files is given directory. It calculates the number of leading zeros needed, no matter the number of files (if >100, more zeros are needed), and renames the files automatically.\nTo use it\ncopy the script below into an empty file, in the headsection, set the sourcedirectory, the prefix (\"track-\" in this case) and the file extension of the files you want to rename. Save it as rename.py and run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/script.py\n\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport shutil\nimport os\n\nsourcedir = \"/path/to/sourcedir\"\nprefix = \"track_\"\nextension = \"mp3\"\n\nfiles = [(f, f[f.rfind(\".\"):], f[:f.rfind(\".\")].replace(prefix, \"\")) for f in os.listdir(sourcedir) if f.endswith(extension)]\nmaxlen = len(max([f[2] for f in files], key = len))\n\nfor item in files:\n    zeros = maxlen - len(item[2])\n    shutil.move(sourcedir+\"/\"+item[0], sourcedir+\"/\"+prefix+str(zeros*\"0\"+item[2])+item[1])\n\n\nA: I'm assuming that you just need to rename the files 1-9, since those are the ones that need padding. There are multiple ways of doing this.\nYou can execute the below command:\nfor n in $(seq 9); do mv track_$n.mp3 track_0$n.mp3; done;\n\nThis will rename tracks track_1.mp3 - track_9.mp3 to track_01.mp3 - track_09.mp3.\n\nTo break it down, it looks like this:\nfor n in $(seq 9)\ndo\n    mv track_$n.mp3 track_0$n.mp3\ndone\n\n\n\n*\n\n*for n in $(seq 9): for every number in the output of the command seq 9, which is a command that just lists numbers 1 to 9, do,\n\n*mv track_$n.mp3 track_0$n.mp3: this is the actual command that renames the files. It substitutes the value of n iterating through all numbers. So it does mv track_1.mp3 track_01.mp3, mv track_2.mp3 track_02.mp3, until that last number which is 9.\n\n\nA: Of course there are many ways of doing it.  You can, for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Separate the parts\n\n*pad the part that has the number\n\n*concatenate the individual part back to the new name\n\n\nPut this into a loop:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nitem=\"track_1.mp3\"\n\npart1=`echo $item | awk -F_ '{print $1}'`\npart2=`echo $item | awk -F_ '{print $2}'`\npart2a=`echo $part2 | awk -F.

'{print $2}'`\n    number=`printf \"%02d\" $part2a`\n    seperator=\"_\"\n    newname=\"$part1$seperator$number.$part2b\"\n    echo \"Renaming $item -> $newname\"\n    mv $item $newname\ndone\nenter code here\n\n\nA: Make a script that will work like a command.\nMake this file on the directory where you track file exist. \n\n\n*\n\n*Do like this\ntouch change\nchmod +x change\nvim change\n\n\n*In it write\n#!/bin/bash\nn=0\nfor m in {00 .. 99}\ndo\n   mv track_$n.mp3 track_$m\n   n=`expr $n + 1``\ndone\n\n\nA: GPRename will automatically insert a zero if you are renaming 10 or more files (two if you are renaming 100 or more, etc.) when using the numerical function. Just make sure Zero auto-fill is turned on in the Options menu.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Install Error with Windows 7 Install Inside I am using Windows 7 64 bit on my PC and installed Ubuntu 12.10 version with the \"install inside\" option.

In this case the requested password is about root.\nWhen you type:\n sudo su\n\nyou are running su as root user, sudo ask your password and su does not. So you can become root without knowing the password. \nCaution: It is strongly recommended to not use this command unless you really know very well what you are doing\nIf you want exec command as another user login shell environment:\n sudo su - <user> -c <command>\n\nor\n sudo -u <user> -i <command>\n\nHere is useful link\n\nA: Hi Why not open a terminal Ctrl + Alt + T and type man su? That will explain what the su command does.\nSimilarly with bash.\nman = manual and it gives a list of arguments that can be used with the command.\n", "Q: System failed to boot after upgradng EOL Ubuntu 13.10 to 14.04 Today I upgraded my EOL (end of life) system Ubuntu 13.10 to 14.04. It downloaded 738 MB. Then while upgrading or installing, it messaged something like this: \"finishing the installation (& stopping to install further) as many errors are detected. Press 'ENTER' to continue\"\nI pressed 'ENTER' key. Then immediately the '$' (prompt) returned back. I confirmed that the system was upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04. Then the system failed to reboot. I checked before rebooting that 'print screen' button wasn't functioning. Also while upgrading, I read at one point it was written that there is high possibility that the system would be broken.\nAs the system failed to reboot, I installed back my previous distribution Ubuntu 13.10 using bootable pen drive.\nPlease look below to know what all I did to upgrade:\n\nFirst I edited the /etc/apt/sources.lst file by replacing\n  archive.ubuntu.com with old-releases.ubuntu.com\nThen I ran:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade (this command didn't do anything; simply had output \"0 upgraded, 0 installed ..........\")\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\n\nThen it downloaded 738 MB of data but the system couldn't boot after the upgradation. Having no other option, I reinstalled the previous distro Ubuntu 13.10.\nI feel the only solution left for me is to download the iso image of the new distro & install preparing bootable pen drive.\nAlso, I can not experiment upgrading many times as it will increase my monetary expense as each upgradation requires 738 MB of data to download.\nIs it O.K. or any other way also!!\n\nA: I feel the only solution left for me is to download the iso image of the new distro & install preparing bootable pen drive.\nThis is the appropriate solution regarding 13.10. Remember; 13.10 was not a LTS; In many respects, it should be considered a test platform, preparing the way to the next lts. If you have however 12.04; Upgrading this to 14.04 is officially supported, and should upgrade without consequence. If a consequence arises, then a bug report is greatly appreciated.\nFrom my own experience; it is always preferable to do fresh installs, particularly on machines that have seen a lot of use and customization. \n", "Q: Organize desktop by name in Nemo I'm using Nemo as my file manager and when I press the right mouse button the only option to sort my Desktop is by Name.\n\nIs it possible to sort by other values, like Date Modified?\n\nA: This is probably not possible.\nNemo is a fork of nautilus.\nWhen I right click on my desktop, I can't see a sort by anything else either:\n\nHave a look at this answer.\n", "Q: Synergy setup problem I have one desktop and one laptop at home and want to combine them using synergy.

Both connections come from the same home router. I tried QuickSynergy as well but that didn't work either. \n\nA: Find out the machines' ip address and configure them in /etc/hosts.  Then use the name you assign to the ip's as for your configuration.\nSynergy searching for an /etc/synergy.conf file first and will use this by default if it fines it.

Unfortunately, the machine contains GBs worth of data that I must backup to the office's shared network drive before I can reinstall Windows 7 a fresh again. Therefore, I decided to use Ubuntu live CD and run it through the \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" option to connect to the office's wireless LAN and then copy all the relevant folders that contain important data to the network drive.\nI could easily track down the folders/files that I needed from the Windows source directory by starting from Ubuntu's Devices section then navigating through this location: /media/Windows7_OS (I assumed this is how Ubuntu sees the drive C labeled with the same name).\nAnd then, I could just as easily find my network destination after successfully connecting to the wireless LAN and finding it under Ubuntu's Network section by navigating through this location: Browse Network > Then opening the drive > NAS-KKM(FTP) (I picked FTP since I figured file transfer was my objective).\nAfter successfully logging into the file server, I simply tried copying and pasting my directories of interest from the source, to the destination - though unfortunately, I kept getting this error message almost immediately:\nError while copying \".docx\".\nThere was an error copying the file into ftp://nas-kkm.local/...\nError reading from file: Permission denied\nSo I tried finding an alternate way to my backing up problem, and I found a post that recommended I try using \"sudo cp\" to copy my files through the terminal. However, I still cannot copy my files. I used this command:\nsudo cp /media/Windows7_OS/Users/Profile One/Desktop ftp://nas-kkm.local/MyOffice/T430_Laptop/Profile%One/Desktop\nNotice I placed \"%\" in place of a space in one of the destination sub-directories since it seemed as though the command didn't want any spaces in my directories for the destination.\nUnfortunately, this still didn't work. (As you can see, I'm trying to back up the entire desktop from the user \"Profile One\".)\nThe command cannot find my destination directory - even when I tried renaming it without spaces.\nAs I'd mentioned earlier, I've never used the terminal to run any commands before - this is my first time and I'm  only familiar with the Ubuntu GUI interface since it's intuitive to use.\nAny assistance will greatly be appreciated.\nKind regards,\nRama\n\nA: The copy command for REMOTE copy is rcp not cp. A more secure version is scp (scp will ask for a passwords or a passphrase if needed). It takes the form of\nscp files* {user}@{ip-address}:/dir/to/place/files/\n\nYou can put the directories in between \"'s if you have spaces somewhere:\nscp files* {user}@{ip-address}:\"/dir 2/to 3/place 5/files/\" \n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu help on file transfer.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu server 14.04 vsftpd connection problem I recently installed vsftpd according to this tutorial: http://www.krizna.com/ubuntu/setup-ftp-server-on-ubuntu-14-04-vsftpd/.

Booting and installation both work fine, with the installation able to access the network. Within the live session, the default LAN network interface is set to manual in /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\n\nThat wouldn't be a problem. The problem is that installed system also has this configuration, and since there's an entry for eth0 (or whatever the name of the interface happens to be) in /etc/network/interfaces, NetworkManager ignores it, leading users to think that their \"LAN isn't working in Ubuntu\".\nThere are plenty of things that Ubuntu can copy over from a live session to an installation, such as packages, repository sources, GUI preferences. It doesn't do so for any of those. Why, though, does it retain this network configuration, of all things? How do I stop it from doing so?\n\nA: This is a known bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/388060 (about 5 years old).

It's not completely non-responsive: I can still Ctrl+Alt+F1 into a virtual terminal to restart the lightdm service and everything is alright.

I wanted to create an Ubuntu derivative and distribute it.\nI have read this post. It says no permission is required for creating a derivative and using it. \nBut if it is given to organizations under a separate name (saying it is a derivative of ubuntu), does this not require permission from Ubuntu or Canonical?\nIf not, when is permission required for creating and distributing a derivative?\nWill availing permission mean that it is a recognized derivative?\n\nA: Ubuntu is open source, it is free to modify it, with no permission from Canonical, or Ubuntu. As long as you don't claim it to be your own work or an official derivative, you're fine.\nWhat would this separate name be?\n\nA: You are free to do whatever you want with the source code. The images depicting Ubuntu and Canonical are copyrighted and have to be removed (that includes images in packages itself). Those should all be marked with a (c). \nYou are even allowed to use the Ubuntu repositories to fetch your release. \n\n\nBut if it is given to organizations under a separate name (saying it is a derivative of ubuntu), does this not require permission from Ubuntu or Canonical?\n\nNo, but you are not allowed to leave an impression that you are related to Canonical or Ubuntu and/or that this release is in any way related to Ubuntu. You are also not allowed to mimick the name Ubuntu. Claiming a derivative of Ubuntu without also expressing it is unofficial might raise eyebrowses (I am not a lawyer but that to me might cross a border).\n\nYour system most likely will NOT be officially endorsed. The Ubuntu derivatives that are there now cover each a large audience either by language (chinese) or a specific desktop evironment (kde, lxde) each with their own niche (feature-rich, or mainly about supporting older hardware and speed). \n\nUpdate:\nTo become an official member of the Ubuntu family you need approval from the members of the Ubuntu Technical Board.\n\nThe Ubuntu Technical Board is responsible for the technical direction that Ubuntu takes. The Technical Board makes final decisions over package selection, packaging policy, installation system and process, toolchain, kernel, X server, library versions and dependencies, and any other matter which requires technical supervision in Ubuntu. \n\nUbuntu MATE seems to become the newest member in the Ubuntu family.\n", "Q: bash script to back up file I have a few files to be backed up.

Now either the computer freezes or I go into a low graphic mode similar to the Terminal. I believe this is because I have an old Nvidia FX5600 graphic card. If I run 3.13.0-32-generic in recovery mode I can use my computer. My question is can I reverse out the HWE upgrade or will I have to reinstall the OS from scratch using the original CD?\n\nA: NB: This does not answer your question but rather tells you how to fix your problem while still using the new HWE. \nOpen a terminal (hold in CTRL and ALT while pressing T)\nAdd xorg-edgers PPA and update\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nYou'll have to supply your password when prompted.

To confirm that you are indeed using Nvidia drivers you may open System settings in the menu on top right and choose Additional Drivers from the Hardware section. It takes some time for it to start up but when it's there it will tell you if you are using Nvidia driver. It might be that you could in fact activate your driver from this view after sudo add-get update but I didn't do that so I'm not 100% sure. Before the HWE update I had several choices here but now I only have the one I have installed.\nThere is a bug report on this issue and it can happen this problem will be solved upstream. To stop using the PPA:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/xorg-edgers-ppa-precise.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-304 \n\n\nA: The core problem is that the HWE update doesn't install the headers for the new kernel. These headers are necessary for the NVidia driver to build its kernel module. To fix it, simply install the linux headers and then reinstall whatever nvidia driver you're using:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-lts-trusty\n\nNote: this is for Ubuntu 12.04.5, if you're using a later release, it's going to be linux-headers-generic-lts-RELEASENAME.\nThen when you reinstall the nvidia driver and reboot, you should be fine once again.\n\nA: I just had this same issue while upgrading my HWE on 12.04.\nAfter upgrading, everything worked fine for a few minutes and then the screen went distorted and pixelated. \nWhat I had to do was hard restart the PC and enter into recovery mode on reboot. I enabled networking and then dropped to the root shell. There I apt-get updated/upgraded and then rebooted again into normal mode. No icons loaded this time and I rebooted again. Another reboot appeared to fix the problem.\nIt looks like it was caused by a NVIDIA driver Bug Screen freeze and garbled after resume from suspend\nHope this helps someone.\n\nA: I had the same issue: after upgrade I could only boot into the tty screen.  After trying numerous fixes, I happened to notice that the Nvidia kernel was using driver 173, while the rest of the conf was 304.

Here is a community tutorial on Linux Mint about doing so .\nThe caveat is that you may have problems depending on the level of customization you had, as well as package conflicts and other such problems. The comments on those articles suggest that the procedure mostly works, with some known definite issues.\nThe procedure, in this case, is simply to update entries in /etc/apt/sources.list to use the newer release (perhaps from a newer version of the derived distro), and run:\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nOddly enough, the tutorial lists sudo apt-get upgrade as a step again after the dist-upgrade (to what end I do not know).\nThis really depends on how much customization the derivative does.

On those, you may have to play games with renaming the bootloader, like boot-repair does, or just use the efi boot menu to select the boot device each time. ---\n\nI don't think wubi is a working option anymore, so avoid it. What machine do you have, they all have individual quirks.  When you say you cannot select USB, what do you mean?  Do you get the efi menu of devices to boot, and don't see usb in the list?  How did you create the USB?  Did you md5sum hashcheck the downloaded iso file, and did you burn the CD as slowly as possible, and media check it afterward?\n\nA: I hope this helps.  On some computers with some flash drives, the flash drive is recognized as another hard drive.  Go back into the BIOS and look at the boot order.

The problem: after installation Kubuntu on external SSD (Transcend ESD400 512Gb) on UEFI computer I can't use it on another one. I made some attempts but all of them were unsuccessful.\nMy computer: UEFI, Core i7 - 4 cores, Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit, 2 internal drives with GPT, external SSD with GPT.\nKubuntu distro: LiveUSB, created with Universal USB Installer 1.9.5.4, Kubuntu 14.04 LTS\nExternal SSD was partitioned with GParted, partitions are alligned.\nAfter each installation SSD was formatted and repartitioned. GRUB was checked: version 2.02, EFI (not grub-pc).\n\nAttempt 1: with plugged internal drives.\nI booted from LiveUSB. Perform usual installation. My partition table:\n512Mb - EFI - fat32\n30Gb - / - ext4\n100Gb - /home - ext4\n50Gb - /usr - ext4\n50Gb - /opt - ext4\n\nBootloader was installed on External SSD (/dev/sdc). \nAfter rebooting I found 2 boot entries ubuntu in UEFI. If my external SSD is plugged and I choose every of this 2 entries - everything works well: Kubuntu starts and works. If the external SSD is off - a black screen Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported appeared. If I choose UEFI TS512... (boot entry with label of the external SSD), it seems that the next entry works (Windows Boot Manager). \nAttempt 2: with unpluged internal drives.\nInstallation procedure was the same. After rebooting system started and worked. But after plugging the internal drives, on booting from external (both ubuntu and UEFI TS512... entries) a black screen with blinking text cursor appears and nothing wants to start. If I choose Windows Boot Manager Windows starts well.\nAttempt 3: tried to modify efi files.\nCopied grubx64.efi from /dev/sda1 to dev/sdc1 and renamed to bootx64.efi. Nothing new - it goes down the list of entries until Windows Boot Manager.\nAttempt 4: tried to modify grub.cfg and fstab.\nIn /boot/grub/grub.cfg replaces all hd2 with hd0. And in fstab I changed the UUID of EFI partition: before it pointed to /dev/sda1, now it points to /dev/sdc1.\n\nSo how can I make a portable system on external SSD, that will boot on every UEFI computer, but not only on mine?\n\nA: Your problem is that the EFI boot process stores data on the boot loader's location in NVRAM, so when you install on one computer and then move the disk to another computer, the second computer doesn't know where to look to find the boot loader. The usual way around this problem is to use the default/fallback boot loader filename, EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi, on the EFI System Partition (ESP; that's your FAT32 partition). The firmware looks for this filename on removable disks. The big caveat is that you may need to use the firmware's built-in boot manager to select that disk, and the details of how to access that boot manager vary from one computer to another.\nYou can copy the boot loader to that location manually. The way that's most likely to work, from a working Ubuntu installation, is:\ncd /boot/efi/EFI\nsudo mkdir -p BOOT\nsudo cp ubuntu/shimx64.efi BOOT/bootx64.efi\nsudo cp ubuntu/grubx64.efi BOOT/grubx64.efi\n\nNote that these commands will overwrite any existing EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi boot loader. You probably don't have one on your external disk right now, but you might want to double-check this. Also, this assumes that the ESP on the external disk is mounted at /boot/efi. You should definitely double-check that with df before you proceed. You don't want to overwrite the boot loader on your internal disk by accident!\nIf you're sure that you'll be booting with Secure Boot disabled, you could copy EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi, but that won't work if the target computer has Secure Boot enabled.\n", "Q: Infinite login loop - Signature not found in user keyring I am using Ubuntu 13.10, which I installed almost 6 months back. While installation I selected HOME folder encryption. However, being a newbie I did not note mount passphrase(I thought how important this could be ! apparently that is all I need right now). Everything worked fine until 3 days back. I changed my login password, locked the screen and unlocked it using new password to make sure everything is fine. A few seconds later the computer shut down due to power supply cut-off (yes, battery is dead , hence the machine is directly powered by cable).  I restarted the laptop and I was not able to login, the login screen was being thrown back after correct password entry(so basically there was a login loop). However, I was able to login to tty1 with the error message:\n\" Signature not found in user keyring.\nPerhaps try the interactive 'ecryptfs-mount-private' \"\nI tried solutions this , this and this.

I only remember last 2 passwords i.e. the one which is throwing login loop and one previous to that.\nCould you please tell me if something can be done to recover data ?\n\nA: I had this problem too. From TTY1, you have to change the password to the previous one that was not giving you the problem. Then you should log out and log back in with the old password.

However, there are no SSH keys related to backup-user on the server. Therefore, no one (remotely) can log in as backups-user.\nYou will need to either temporarily allow password authentication or copy the public-key file to your home directory and use sudo cp id_rsa.pub ~backups-user/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server to copy the public key to that user's home directory.\n", "Q: Tourble submitting desktop app for review \"payment details are required before any application can be reviewed\" I am trying to submit an app (ubuntu desktop) in the software center through here:\nhttps://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/\nAfter filling in all the required fields and clicking the button \"Submit for review\", I receive the following message:\n\"Payment details are required before any application can be reviewed\"\nHow could this issue be resolved?\nThank you,\n-Nikos\n\nA: as stated here (step 5), you must provide details of your PayPal account (email), Phone number and Postal address (ZIP code).\nClick on Update my account details and then Submit to review.\nRemember: The minimum price you can charge is $2.99\n", "Q: Tweak macbook pro touchpad on ubuntu I am using macbook pro with Ubuntu.

I would like to set up Ubuntu in headless mode - configured to operate without a monitor, keyboard, and mouse; probably without access to graphics hardware altogether. The rationale for this is: I will have a KVM virtual machine running that would have graphics hardware to itself.\nHow do I do it? Which Ubuntu distribution could I be using and why? The options that come to my mind are desktop and server, but both don't offer an option to be installed in headless mode by default, or do they?\nI am going to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS x86_64 on a ThinkPad X Series (intel integrated graphics).\n\nA: Your question is a bit ambigous. If you want to install ubuntu without any keyboard/monitor present, then you need to automate the installation. You'll generally find a lot of information about that if you look for \"preseed\" file and netinstallation. Please be aware that this may require some pre-existing infrastructure, depending on the exact method chosen (such as DHCP, TFTP services). You also want to do this with ubuntu server.\nHowever please note that even KVM guests generally do have (virtualized) keyboard, mouse and monitor outputs and the KVM host on which the KVM guests run on generally have the ability to give you access to those via VNC connection. The end result is that you have a \"headless\" server but still console control over it remotely via VNC and you can perform the installation as if you had a monitor and keyboard on a real physical server.\nUnless you really want to learn to automate an ubuntu server installation with no questions asked I strongly suggest investing time to see how you can get the console of KVM guests to appear whereever it is you are working from.\n", "Q: No Sound In Ubuntu Studio 14.04.1 When playing video and audio files, or on Youtube, there is not sound output.\nAny solution?\n\nA: The problem was causes by the Volume Control configuration.

Download speeds are unaffected and HTTP download stays at a constant 50 MB/s, however uploads start at 2 MB/s and drop down to kilobits per second (on a 1 gbps network). This includes both TX out of the network and TX between virtual machines.\nSetup:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenStack Icehouse with neutron networking\n\n*GRE tunneled network under ml2 plugin via openvswitch\n\n*GRO is disabled on all physical interfaces, which are on igb 2.0.5 driver\n\n*data interfaces are connected via 1gbit ports/switch\n\n*single dedicated network node with several compute nodes\n\n*all servers running 14.04 (also tried 14.10 on one compute node but issue persists)\n\n\nOnce driver is switched to e1000, the network performance returns to expected speed (but e1000 yields worse performance than virtio; around 16 MB/s upload). Additionally, on another node still running 3.13 kernel, the upload speed is > 50 MB/s (and transfer from VM on 3.13 node to VM on 3.14 node is fine, while transfer in opposite direction has this choppy upload issue).\nIn SSH on the guest, simply running cat on a 2000-line file shows the issue, with freezes every 2 seconds. On normal guest it prints within half a second.\nNote that only compute node is affected by this issue -- with two compute nodes in the same cluster, one node running 3.13 and the other running 3.14, and neutron network node running something else (shouldn't matter but I think it's on 3.16 at the moment), the 3.13 is still fine while guests on 3.14 node have the problem.\nI noticed bug report in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74851. However\n\n\n*\n\n*a) it's my understanding that IP forwarding is not needed on compute node (after disabling it via \"echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\" the guest network still runs) and\n\n*b) after upgrading to newest 3.14, newest 3.15, and newest 3.16 from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ the issue persists.\n\n\nA: It looks like this wasn't actually kernel related, but instead for some reason upgrading to the 3.14 mainline kernel caused TSO to be enabled on the bridge, tap, and other interfaces that OpenStack automatically create.\nAfter running ethtool -K [interface] gro off tso off on each qbr, qvb, qvo, and tap interface, virtio driver returns to good performance.\nSince I need 3.14 for some other changes related to bcache, I ended up patching OpenStack nova in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/network/linux_net.py to run the ethtool command (via utils.execute with run_as_root=True) each time one of these interfaces is created.

If it returns immediately, then either your program is not correctly bound on the ubuntu server or a firewall rejects your request.\nNote: You wrote you have allowed firewall port 80, yet write your program sits at 8080. Thus you would be firewalling your program away from everyone.\nCheck netstat on the server to see where your program is bound to:\n\nnetstat -tulpen\n\nThis lists all programs with open listening sockets along their processid/names (if you are root or owner of them).

As far as I know, the only partition that is not encrypted is the /boot partition because it has the boot loader unencrypted. When I use TrueCrypt to encrypt Windows, I am asked to move the mouse cursor inside the window to create a pool to improve the level of entropy.\nAs Ubuntu does not offer something like that, how can I be sure the keys, salts etc. are secure enough?\n\nA: While you might not be asked to move your mouse, it will still help build entropy/feed your random number generator.\nIn Linux, /dev/random is your PRNG.  /dev/urandom is fed by /dev/random, but provides more raw data to use.\nAccessing data on HDDs, moving the mouse and typing are all actions that will help feed your random number generator.\nUnfortunately, when you're in Ubuntu's LiveCD mode, you most likely will not have many things to do that might cause increases in entropy generation.\nYou can, however, rest easy and know that random number generation in Linux has been under peer review and should be safe.

You can now check the status of minidlna by accessing localhost:8200 from your Ubuntu machine's web browser.\n\nIf you connect your media player to your network, you should be able to see a DLNA Server called \"My supercool DLNA Server\", or whatever you specified in friendly_name. You can access it and all video files should be available there. If you select one, it should start playing it. \n", "Q: where is \"killer gegls from outer space\" source code I want to modify the game Killer gegls from outer space.

I don't have physical access to the machine, but I have had someone change the CPU clock speed in the BIOS for me.\nUnfortunately, the OS doesn't respect this and throttles the CPU back up to full speed when needed.\nI cannot install any software through apt-get nor can I upload any software to the machine; I need to work with the system in its current state due to security limitations.\nWhat I need to do is either (1) lock the machine in its lowest CPU speed or (2) have it respect the BIOS-specified CPU speed.\n\nA: If you have the cpupower command available (part of linux-tools-common package, I think included by default), you can use a powersaving CPU governor to limit the speed - you can list the available governors with:\ncpupower frequency-info --governors\n\nExample output:\nanalyzing CPU 0:\nconservative ondemand userspace powersave performance\n\nAnd set it with this (as root):\ncpupower frequency-set -g GOVERNOR\n\ne.g. \nsudo cpupower frequency-set -g conservative\n\nYou can then view the current state by running sudo cpupower frequency-info - example output:\nanalyzing CPU 0:\n  driver: acpi-cpufreq\n  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0\n  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0\n  maximum transition latency: 10.0 us.\n  hardware limits: 800 MHz - 2.50 GHz\n  available frequency steps: 2.50 GHz, 2.50 GHz, 2.00 GHz, 1.80 GHz, 1.60 GHz, 1.40 GHz, 1.20 GHz, 1000 MHz, 800 MHz\n  available cpufreq governors: conservative, userspace, powersave, ondemand, performance\n  current policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 2.50 GHz.\n                  The governor \"ondemand\" may decide which speed to use\n                  within this range.\n  current CPU frequency is 800 MHz (asserted by call to hardware).\n  boost state support:\n    Supported: yes\n    Active: yes\n2900 MHz max turbo 4 active cores\n2900 MHz max turbo 3 active cores\n2900 MHz max turbo 2 active cores\n3100 MHz max turbo 1 active cores\n\nDocumentation on what each governor does cna be found here - here is a summary (you probably want the powersave one):\n\n2.1 Performance\nThe CPUfreq governor \"performance\" sets the CPU statically to the\n  highest frequency within the borders of scaling_min_freq and\n  scaling_max_freq.\n2.2 Powersave\nThe CPUfreq governor \"powersave\" sets the CPU statically to the lowest\n  frequency within the borders of scaling_min_freq and scaling_max_freq.\n2.3 Userspace\nThe CPUfreq governor \"userspace\" allows the user, or any userspace\n  program running with UID \"root\", to set the CPU to a specific\n  frequency by making a sysfs file \"scaling_setspeed\" available in the\n  CPU-device directory.\n2.4 Ondemand\nThe CPUfreq governor \"ondemand\" sets the CPU depending on the current\n  usage. To do this the CPU must have the capability to switch the\n  frequency very quickly. ...\n2.5 Conservative\nThe CPUfreq governor \"conservative\", much like the \"ondemand\"\n  governor, sets the CPU depending on the current usage.  It differs in\n  behaviour in that it gracefully increases and decreases the CPU speed\n  rather than jumping to max speed the moment there is any load on the\n  CPU.  This behaviour more suitable in a battery powered environment. ...\n\nThis governors can be set to be used fairly easily (there's even a Unity extension that can be used so it can be done from a desktop user's panel), and can save a fair amount of power when used (extra hour/half hour batter life for a laptop, etc)\n", "Q: Python3 modules I've recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 and have been a python enthusiast for several years, since I used python in grad school for (text) data analysis.\nI've noticed that 14.04 comes with both python 2.7 and 3.4.  However, the repository only installs python modules for python 2.7.  I was wondering if someone could walk me through the steps for installing modules for python 3.4 (specifically numpy and matplotlib) when the default \"python\" gives python 2.7.\nThanks.  No rush on an answer.\n\nA: Python 3 packages are prefixed with \"python3\". For numpy and matplotlib, install python3-numpy and python3-matplotlib.\n\nA: As bain points out, you'll find that the python3.x modules have the a prefix of python3-<pkgname> .   You can see this by searching the package cache (which includes packages available and not installed).\nHere are a couple of relevant commands: \napt-cache search numpy | egrep ^python3  # search for numpy, python3\napt-cache search -n ^python3             # search only package names for python3\n\nThe ^python3 expression limits to packages that start with 'python3', and the '-n' limits the search to names (not long descriptions).  You can remove those for more general searches. \nHere's some sample output:\n$ apt-cache search numpy | egrep ^python3\npython3-numpy - Fast array facility to the Python 3 language\npython3-numpy-dbg - Fast array facility to the Python 3 language (debug extension)\npython3-h5py - h5py is a general-purpose Python interface to hdf5\npython3-mpi4py - bindings of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard\npython3-mpi4py-dbg - bindings of the MPI standard -- debug symbols\npython3-numexpr - Fast numerical array expression evaluator for Python 3 and NumPy\npython3-numexpr-dbg - Fast numerical array expression evaluator for Python 3 and NumPy (debug ext)\npython3-pyproj - Python 3 interface to PROJ.4 library\npython3-scipy - scientific tools for Python 3\npython3-scipy-dbg - scientific tools for Python 3 - debugging symbols\npython3-tables - hierarchical database for Python3 based on HDF5\npython3-tables-dbg - hierarchical database for Python 3 based on HDF5 (debug extension)\npython3-tables-lib - hierarchical database for Python3 based on HDF5 (extension)\n\n \n$ apt-cache search -n ^python3\npython3 - interactive high-level object-oriented language (default python3 version)\npython3-all - package depending on all supported Python 3 runtime versions\npython3-all-dbg - package depending on all supported Python 3 debugging packages\npython3-all-dev - package depending on all supported Python 3 development packages\npython3-amqp - Low-level AMQP client (Python3 version)\npython3-apparmor - AppArmor Python3 utility library\npython3-apparmor-click - Click manifest to AppArmor easyprof conversion tools\npython3-apport - Python 3 library for Apport crash report handling\npython3-apt - Python 3 interface to libapt-pkg\npython3-apt-dbg - Python 3 interface to libapt-pkg (debug extension)\npython3-aptdaemon - Python 3 m[...]\n\n", "Q: unsure of owncloud mysql password and database I've recently attempted to make my pc an owncloud server. I attempted to logon on the same machine I am hosting it on. However, I first need to enter a mysql password, database name, etc., and I don't know any details. how can I find this out?\n\nA: The ownCloud installation requires access to a database such as MySQL on the server it is running on, in your case this is your PC.\nWhen you install MySQL, you become the MySQL root and have to create a new database, which you give the name and password to be used by ownCloud.\nThis should get you started:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nAs far as I remember, this will let you set a password for your MySQL root user. Then log on to MySQL like so:\nmysql -u root -p\n\nWhich will ask you for the password you've given in the first step. On the MySQL prompt, create a database (I named it owncloud) and switch to using it\nCREATE DATABASE owncloud;\nUSE owncloud;\n\nThen create a user and password to access the owncloud database and exit MySQL:\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON owncloud.* TO myocuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'mysupersecretpassword';\nEXIT\n\nUsing this example, the user and password for the MySQL database you have to enter at the ownCloud installation are myocuser and mysupersecretpassword, respectively (which you should change for your installation, of course).\n", "Q: Where is NumLock in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ I want to modify NumLock functionality by editing a file in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/.

Further research showed that somehow wifi had gotten hard blocked. There IS a button on the keyboard for wifi and at first I figured I had accidentally hit it but 1) hitting it again does not unblock wifi and 2) ever since I have been hyper-conscious of not hitting it and wifi still randomly gets blocked.\nSometimes I can use the internet for hours and hours with no issue and sometimes after wifi freezes/crashes it will freeze/crash again within minutes of rebooting. It has been at least a week of this happening at least once a day and try as I might I have been unable to figure out any guess as to what is causing or triggering the freezes/crashes.\nFixes I have tried that have not solved the problem:\n-restoring BIOS back to defaults\n-all manner of rfkill unblocking\n-reinstalling wifi drivers\n-switching from network-manager to wicd\n-unloading & reloading wifi module (brcmsmac)\nnotably, brcmsmac does not reload once I have sudo modprobe -r 'd it, running sudo modprobe brcmsmac after that yields nothing and at that point running lshw shows the wireless adaptor as \"unclaimed.\" Again, only a reboot fixes this.\nother info/details:\nThe fact that this began within the past week or so seems to me to indicate some kind of update triggered this, but I've been running 14.04 since it was released in April so it would have to have been a more recent, smaller / more minor update that caused this issue if I'm correct in assuming that is what caused

procedure is different even if it did work, which as I said in my comment it did not for me.\nsearching based on error messages found in /var/log/syslog I found this thread from a couple months ago where someone using the same 14e4:4727 Broadcomm as me had similar problems which were never solved: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2212368&page=4\nIn response to the post my issue is currently allegedly a duplicate of, which itself redirects to a Broadcomm driver installation guide - that Broadcom installation guide was one of the first posts I found when I began researching this issue. According to that guide my Broadcom card is \"Special Case #1 - This device uses the driver combination bcma and brcmsmac. It shouldn't be necessary to install anything at all. Required firmware is installed by default in the package linux-firmware.\" Despite that, I tried reinstalling the drivers and trying every combination of blacklisting all to no avail as mentioned in my original posting. \nAs I have said before, my wireless had been working fine for 6 - 8 months since I bought the computer so I know I had the driver configuration right until something somehow messed it up a week or so ago. My only guess as to what could have caused this issue is a change in a recent minor update since I hadn't made any adjustments to any wireless or networking settings since I initially set-up the computer back when I bought it and have been running 14.04 since it was released in April. Nevertheless as I already said one of the first fixes I tried before even posting here was reinstalling / blacklisting drivers as per the very instructions my post is currently marked as a duplicate of and it did NOT resolve the issue.\n\nA: Copy and paste this command in the terminal CTRL+ALT+T:\necho \"options asus_nb_wmi wapf=1\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/asus_nb_wmi.conf\n\nReboot and wifi should work.\nYou may have to toggle your fn keys to remove the hard block after rebooting.\nHere is the link with full details by varun and chili555.\n", "Q: Nautilus how filter every files by extension I want to filter every mp3 files in certain folder and its sub-folders.

Someone I know said he had put spyware on my computer. Is he talking crap? I've been using Ubuntu 12.04 for nearly 3 years now and I've never seen any type of spyware, remote keyloggers or RATS (remote access tools) and likewise, backdoors. I've searched several Ubuntu forums and nothing. Other than that Amazon thing. If they even exist, are there  antivirus scanners to find, identify and remove them?\n\nA: If your friend is familiar with programming, it is possible that he has written a custom spyware script. That is quite easy under Linux, and a common prank to play on unsuspecting friends. Because it is custom, no antivirus program may be able to find it.\nSome common places to hide such scripts are the startup files in your home directory, ~/.bashrc etc.\nThe most straight-forward and reliable way to find such a script would be to run a compare against your latest backup before the incident.\n\nA: Spyware also exists in browser apps (like those for chrome) so even if you are absolutely sure you have nothing local installed that contains spyware, if you use untrusted webapps, you can be exposed.\n\nA: There is spyware for every operating system. It is more prevalent for windows than any other operating system because it is used more. There are around 40 known spyware applications for Linux. It is not common but it can happen. As for antivirus this is a list that may help you. Best of luck! \nhttp://opensource-sidh.blogspot.com/2011/10/top-5-anti-virus-for-ubuntu-free.html?m=1\n\nA: Yes, there is spyware-like behavior in several Unix applications. \nI worry most about all the applications sending auto-update and metadata lookup requests, often with information about your computer and network activity.\nYou can use a tool like Wireshark to detect any suspicious network activity and track it down to which applications are sending information.  If the upload is not encrypted, Wireshark will even show you the content.\n\nA: If you are using a desktop computer and have a keyboard attached to it, then you should check if there is a key logger put between your keyboard and your computer.\nObviously such a key logger will not care what OS you run. \n\nA: Any system can have virus.\nIf your friend, had direct acess at your ubuntu or know the root password, will be easy to put some keylogger in it.\nLook up if he put logkeys https://code.google.com/p/logkeys/\n", "Q: I can´t install Cinammon on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I'm new on linux and I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 lts.

I am not able to know if I am connected to the internet without this. I ought to enter my browser and search for google or something to know if I am connected. So need help here! \nPS:- BTW I see that there aren't many icons on my top bar. Is this normal? Am I missing any other default icons? If yes can you tell how to get those? BTW I have libappindicator 1 and libappindicator 3-1 installed. So, that shouldn't be a problem. Also I tried this but it didn't work. Let me also add that I changed to a different icon theme too but that also didn't help(presently using numix-circle theme). The default tweak tool also doesn't seem to have any options to solve this issue of mine.\n\nA: This was by design: Debian Bug #708966 \n\nFor machines that are permanently connected to a wired connection, that icon is\n  mostly noise. In most cases you are always connected, and the status never\n  changes. The icon is uninteresting and gets in the way of the information that\n  has utility.\nThere are many cases where a wired connection comes very close to being a\n  physical part of the machine itself (eg. computer labs, etc).\nWith the new model, every icon in the top bar has an associated submenu with\n  options. However, in the case of wired, there are no options that are of use to\n  the vast majority of users. The proportion of people needing to turn off their\n  wired connection is very small indeed.\n\nEven in newer versions, the icon is showed only if some action can be taken on the wired connection (for example, multiple profiles are present).\n\nA: This extension may be a satisfying workaround. \nIt is the only one that works (as I have found so far).\n", "Q: my wifi blinking light (gedit:19011): Gtk-WARNING **: Calling Inhibit failed:\nGDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by any .service files\n\nI have a hp compaq notebook 6530b and i have ubuntu 14.04 and my wifi keeps blinking. when i save this options iwlcore led_mode=1 i get this message\n\nA: I had the same problem (flashing wifi) on a Dell Inspiron and found this answer helped, but I needed to use iwlegacy in lieu of iwlcore.\n", "Q: Question regarding a domain name ending with \"ubuntu\" I'm building a website like OMG!Ubuntu.

These two entries show the same name: Ubuntu:XXXXXXX.  \nI can't find any difference between them, are they the same or is there a difference?\n\nA: In an Ubuntu terminal window, type:\nsudo efibootmgr -v\n\nThis will show you details for all the boot entries in your EFI's boot manager. Examine the details for the two ubuntu entries to see if they differ. If they don't, it's safe to remove one of them via the -b # -B option, as in:\nsudo efibootmgr -b 4 -B\n\nThis example deletes the Boot0004 entry. I recommend deleting the entry that comes later (or not at all) in the BootOrder list (which is also shown by efibootmgr -v).\nIt's also safe to delete an entry if it refers to a non-existent file, partition, or disk. Unfortunately, the partition and disk identification is done via long strings that are difficult for humans to parse. You might have such an old entry if you installed Ubuntu twice.\nNote that there are certain bugs that can cause these entries to multiply. In particular, an interaction of a buggy EFI and a buggy version of Shim can cause this problem. If you run into this condition, I recommend disabling Secure Boot and bypassing Shim. The former requires entering your firmware setup utility, finding the Secure Boot option (its location and name varies, unfortunately), and disabling it. The latter requires creating a new NVRAM entry that points directly at GRUB, rather than at shim:\nsudo efibootmgr -c -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grubx64.efi -L \"GRUB direct\"\n\nIIRC, the buggy version of shim is distributed with Fedora, and Ubuntu's version is unaffected, so chances are you should not see this problem if you're using Ubuntu's Shim.\n", "Q: How to install virtual TI-85 I was learning some physics stuff Khan Academy in which I saw they are using TI-85 complex calculator.

In fact, they were:\nappmenu-gtk\nappmenu-gtk3\nasymptote\nindicator-appmenu\nlibfltk-cairo1.3\nlibfltk-gl1.3\nlibgc1c2\nlibgsl0ldbl\nliboverlay-scrollbar-0.2-0\nliboverlay-scrollbar3-0.2-0\nlibsigsegv2\nlibubuntuoneui-3.0-1\n\nThen I did the same to install old packages (here I realized invoking apt-get install per package is too slow, so I did them all together):\n# take packages marked as install\n$ awk '/\\tinstall/{ print $1 }' < packagespackages > install\n# and install them\n$ xargs sudo apt-get install -y < install\n\nHowever, before doing that, I removed the packages that started with X, to make sure it doesn't do anything with X.\nDoing this, it still told me some X related packages would be removed, but at the same time it said some other X related packages would be installed, so I let it do it.\nFinally, what happened is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*On restart, X didn't run.  Trying FailsafeX said that /usr/bin/X does not exist. Following its suggestions, I did:\n$ cd /usr/bin; ln -s Xorg X\n\n\n*On restart, X ran ok and everything is ok.\n\n*When I do something with apt-get, it tells me that:\nThe following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:\n  x11-apps libwayland-ltss-server0 xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse\n  x11-session-utils appmenu-qt xserver-xorg-input-evdev x11-xfs-utils\n  libxrandr-ltss2 xserver-xorg-input-wacom xinit xserver-xorg-input-mouse\n  libxcb-xfixes0 libwayland-ltss-client0 xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\n  libllvm3.3\n\nSo here's my question. should I remove those packages? How can I make sure I have alternative packages so everything would work ok on restart? If I shouldn't remove these packages, how can I make apt understand that the system depends on them?\n\nA: As muru correctly suggested, ubuntu-desktop had somehow got uninstalled. It looks like somehow I had managed to replace X with wayland (maybe).\nInstalling ubuntu-desktop complained about broken packages xserver-xorg and xorg. Installing them, ubuntu-desktop was installed alright (and /usr/bin/X wad replaced). Apt still said some wayland packages are no longer needed, which I just autoremoved.\n\nA: You could do the following steps next time the issue appears (Which are a bit excessive) but are used for cases where packages become annoying:\nsudo apt-get check\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nWith that the packages should all be correct. There are worst cases where you would need to call upon the powers of dkpg and it's --force-remove-reinstreq or --force-overwrite parameters in order to \"fix\" the package.\n", "Q: How to install gmp 4.3.2 on ubuntu 14.04 I want to install gcc-4.4.3,for which I have to install gmp 4.3.2.\nWhen I run:\n./configure\nmake\n\nI get this error.

It allows you to use one mouse/keyboard across all three computers. That way you can still take advantage of the cpu power on the laptops instead of just using them as a remote display. Imagine running a torrent client on a laptop along with a browser to display stuff while coding/writing papers while keeping the cpu of your main machine free to do other things. It is also useful to have one laptop running windows for programs that don't play nice with wine. Sure you could use virtualbox, but a physical windows machine can be nice to have at times.\n\nA: Yes it is possible, BUT only with a lot of configuration and setting up servers. I tried it myself some time ago but it didn't work out. \nI found a good alternative called Synergy.\nWith synergy you could use one mouse and keyboard (including copy-and-paste) on all of your PC's.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu from ISO on virtual Windows drive instead of burning a DVD?

That means, once you shutdown Windows, the ISO will be unmounted automatically.\nYou will have to burn a DVD or create a bootable USB stick.\nHOW TO CREATE A BOOTABLE USB STICK USING WINDOWS\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Universal USB Installer and run it.\n\n*Read the license and click I Agree\n\n*From the dropdown list, select Ubuntu under the --- Ubuntu 32/64 Bit --- section.\n\n*Select the Ubuntu 14.04.1 ISO file you downloaded earlier (Click Browse)\n\n*Plug in your USB stick and look up it's drive letter.

How am I supposed to proceed?\nI remember seeing a post that said I should get an option like this, which allows me to install ubuntu with windows 7 but I never got it.\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: This is now kinda tricky because your windows installation was not recognized correctly. Make sure you fully shut windows down before installing Ubuntu (no Hybernate mode etc. (!)). You could start from the DVD again and run the live session and try installing Ubuntu from there. \nThe only problem I see is that you don't have any left over (empty) harddrive or partition so you can't install Ubuntu into it's own space.\nAnother option is installing Ubuntu on a (fast!) USB stick or switch completely which means backing up all your files and then click on \n\nErase disk and install Ubuntu\n\n\nA: You could shrink some space on your hard drive used by C: or D: \nIn Windows press WinKey+R, input diskmgmt.msc, press Enter. It will open Disk Management where you can right-click on C: or D: and choose Shrink volume. You will see a window where you can specify space to shrink.\nIt will give you an unallocated area, which you can format in ubuntu installation and use for Ubuntu. It will not make you erase anything.\n\nA: This is a guide for Windows 8.1 but I found it very helpful. I think it will work for Windows 7 + Ubuntu dualboot.

I am trying to find out how software upgrade works in Ubuntu LTS version.\nLet's say I am using Ubuntu LTS xx.xx. At the time of release, user can install PHP 5.3 and Python 2.6 (this is just an example). After 2 years, the available stable Major release of PHP and Python are 5.5 and 2.7 respectively (this is also an example only).\nLet's say I run these commands in Ubuntu LTS:\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\n\nWill it upgrade the PHP and Python version to the latest available stable Major release, i.e. 5.5 and 2.7? Or it will only upgrade to the new Minor release, e.g. 5.3.2 and 2.6.3?\n\nA: Basically, versions from Ubuntu's main package sources will always stay the same save for some exceptions like Firefox.\nSecurity- (and sometimes bug-) fixes will get backported into those versions, though.\nIf you want to use more recent versions of any kind of software, you can always add a PPA (personal package archive) as a package source that makes minor or major updates available, depending on what you want.\n\nA: Version numbers of the software are only used for determining the version to be installed, taking pinning and other preferences into account. Some software don't even have a version number in the major.minor form (e.g., ca-certificates), so I doubt apt will ever do the form of checking you describe. So, if the users do an apt-get upgrade, they will get the current version of PHP and Python (5.5, 2.7).\n", "Q: Intel Graphics Installer for Linux ends with an error in Ubuntu 14.04 Everytime I try to install the Intel Graphics Installer for Linux it always end up with this 2 screens looking like this.\n\nand\n\nI hope anyone here can help me.\n\nA: Open a Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.

I've googled about this for a while but to no avail. I have a huge amount of photos stored in several media and backed up in a cloud. Shotwell generates pretty large thumbnails which are quite good for getting an idea of both subject and quality of a photo. The thumbnails are organized in groups based on timestamps and original folders. I'd like to be able to browse a complete collection of the thumbnails even when the program has no access to a complete collection of the real photos (as a matter of fact, I don't have a complete collection of the photos in a single storage device). This would be very convenient to me for several reasons; I could browse them from several PCs with differently named home folders, I could tag them according to their storage location etc. The whole collection of the thumbnails would be reasonably light and I could easily update it with rsync. However, if Shotwell doesn't find the actual photos, it automatically moves the corresponding thumbs under a missing pictures heading and their structure is lost.\nI have tried to directly import the thumbs into Shotwell, but the original timestamps and tags are gone. A possible way out would be, to automate a process of thumbnail generation and of folder structure generation based on timestamps, but before getting entangled in that I thought I better ask a question here.\nDo you know any tricks or tweaks -- or can you recommend any specific programs -- that would allow me to browse a (huge) collection of thumbnails without having access to the originals? I have a sense that programs of this kind must be in use somewhere but, as I said, I couldn't find out any.\nThanks!\n\nA: Ok, I solved the problem with a script that generates a thumbnail database. ImageMagick must be installed for the script to run. The script requires two arguments specifying a Source photo path and a Target path. It recursively searches Source for JPG files and generates correctly oriented thumbnails with user-defined width and quality (just change JPG to something else if you wish; it handles all the file formats handled by IM). It generates two thumbnail databases:\n(1) db in Target: thumbnails are arranged in a YYYY/MM/DD folder structure based on the original EXIF dates.\n(2) db in Target.Mirror: thumbs are organized in a folder structure that precisely mirrors the structure of their source.\nYou can easily change the script to generate just one db. I paste here only the core of the script leaving out path checking and manipulation, arguments handling, echo messages, comments, etc. Source, Target and Mirror paths must have a trailing \"/\".\n#!/bin/bash\n# The following variables have to be initialized\n# Source=<path_to_source/>\n# Target=<path_to_target/>\n# Mirror=<Target.mirror/>\n# Width=<Thumbnail width> (experiment with 368, 416, 512, 1024)\n# Quality=<Thumbnail quality> (0% to 100%: 95% is fine, try 75%)\n\n   shopt -s globstar\n   cd \"$Source\"\n   for f in **\n   do\n      if ! ([[ -d \"$f\" ]]) && ([[ \"$f\" == *\"JPG\" ]] || [[ \"$f\" == *\"jpg\" ]])\n      then\n        echo -e \"           ${\\e[0;32m}\" $Source$f${\\e[0m}\n        Date=$(identify -format \"%[EXIF:DateTimeOriginal]\" $f)\n        FolderName=\"$Target${Date:0:4}/${Date:5:2}/${Date:8:2}\"                     \n        if ! [[ -d $FolderName ]]\n        then\n          mkdir -p \"$FolderName\"\n        fi\n        Filename=\"${f##*/}\"\n        convert \"$Source$f\" -thumbnail $Width -quality $Quality -auto-orient \\\n        \"$FolderName/$Filename\"\n # to preserve profiles such as EXIF data, replace line above with the following:\n #\n # convert \"$Source$f\" -resize $Width -quality $Quality -auto-orient\n # \"$FolderName/$Filename\"\n #\n # it takes a bit longer and thumbnails are bigger in size -- profiles use up\n # to 60K\n        if ! [[ \"${f%/*}\" == \"$f\" ]]\n        then\n          if ! [[ -d \"$Mirror\"\"${f%/*}\" ]]\n          then\n            mkdir -p \"$Mirror${f%/*}\"\n          fi\n        fi\n        cp \"$FolderName/$Filename\" \"$Mirror$f\"\n      fi\n   done\n\nThe db is really lightweight (with Width set to 416 and a Quality of 95% the db size is about 1% of the original); copies of it can easily be kept in a notebook or in an android phone and Shotwell browses it lightning fast. If the script is run again with a new source (but with the same target and mirror) the existing dbs are updated.\nWhat can I say -- thank you, Gnu and Linux!\n\nA: F-Spot is a good tool for image retrieval - though maybe just like Shot well.\nI have a version of Ubuntu called Ubuntu Studio along side a normal Ubuntu distro.\nWith Ubuntu Studio, you have improved catalog of image, sound, and video programs, without forgetting what makes Ubuntu a great OS.\nLook into that option - a dual-boot of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Studio (unless you want to install Ubuntu Studio into a VirtualBox or via Live-CD to try it out before installing.\nYou might be pleasantly surprised.\nSteve\n", "Q: Refused connection of ssh I installed openssh on my new Ubuntu14.04 server, turned on ssh, and enjoyed it after I finished installation. Every thing was fine; however, after just one night, I was blocked when using putty as usual. I got the message: connection refused.\nI rebooted the server, and I were again able to connect my server through ssh. But, after half a day, it happened again: my connection through ssh is refused.\nI thought some important settings might be accidentally modified, so I re-installed Ubuntu 14.04 on the server. It worked at that moment but failed at the next day.\nI wondered if there was anything wrong on the firewall, but the firewall manager said that another server, which is one of the new servers in our lab, under the same firewall policy does not have this problem, so there should be some problems on our machine.\nThere is no physical problem on internet, because the engineer showed me that he can ping this server through port 80.\nThis is confusing because the problem exists even though I re-installed the OS. There is no physical problem on the internet, and the firewall policy does not block other servers from my IP. Are there any ssh variables or system settings that I should check?\n\nA: I was simply locked fully out of my machine and getting connection refused.\nPurging and reinstalling openssh-server + client seems to have fixed it for me.\n", "Q: Will I be able to use my NTFS data partition in Ubuntu? My machine is currently running Windows 7. I have 2 partitions: OS (C:) and DATA (D:). I intend to do a native Ubuntu 14.04 install. Assuming I format my Windows OS partition, will I have full access to my D partition in Ubuntu ?\n\nA: Yes, out of the box. However, I would advise to avoid a lot of writing to it, sinse Ubuntu will allow you to create files with names that Windows can't read - names with symbols and weird characters. You will be able to rename them from Ubuntu later. \nNext, NTFS does not support Linux access rights, so you will not be able to place root or /home folder on it. \nNTFS driver is yet not 100% good. \n\nA: Others have posted good information; however, there's one other critical detail: Ubuntu lacks a useful NTFS repair utility. Filesystems occasionally become damaged. Power outages, bugs, system crashes, and other conditions can cause this to happen. When Ubuntu encounters a damaged NTFS volume, Ubuntu will refuse to mount it. Thus, on an Ubuntu-only system, using NTFS on an internal disk is a problem waiting to happen. As soon as that NTFS volume becomes damaged (and it will), you'll have to move the disk to another computer or use a Windows emergency disk to repair it. Either action is a hassle and even creates new risks.\nThus, if you intend to have an Ubuntu-only system, as it sounds like you do, I strongly recommend converting that data partition from NTFS to a Linux-native format. You can do that by backing up, converting, and then restoring the data; or by creating Linux-native storage, copying the data, and then converting the NTFS to Linux-native for use in some other way. (You could also copy the data and then resize the Linux filesystem, but that creates new risks, so I only recommend doing that if you've got a good backup.) The best approach really depends on how much data you're talking about, how much unused disk space you've got, and how much backup capacity you've got.\nI'll take this opportunity to step onto a soap box and say that if you don't have good backups, you should make them, even if it means buying external storage for backup purposes. Every few days, I see a tale of woe from somebody who doesn't have good backups and who's lost irreplaceable data as a result. Please don't become one of those people! If a conversion from NTFS to a Linux-native format helps convince you to buy necessary backup hardware, then that's another advantage to doing the conversion.\n\nA: Ubuntu can certainly read and write files in an NTFS partition.  The data partition needs to be mounted.  This can be done automatically on bootup by modifying the file system table (/etc/fstab).  See, for example, Mounting Windows Partitions in Ubuntu \n", "Q: Wireless Connection Repeatedly disconnects, strong signal The wireless connection on my Dell Inspiron 9100 repeatedly disconnects, especially when I try to access a weblink.\nhttp://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7894056/\n\nA: If StarJammers is a router over which you have administrative control, I suggest you check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, I have better luck with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. After making these changes, reboot the router.\nNext, I suggest we try a couple of driver parameters; from a terminal:\nsudo -i\necho \"options b43 nohwcrypt=1 qos=0\"  >  /etc/modprobe.d/b43.conf\nmodprobe -r ssb\nmodprobe b43\nexit\n\nAny improvement? It may take a reboot.\n", "Q: Can't type caret ('^') in Konsole I can obviously type it my browser and even in Xterm, but not in Konsole.  I'm using Kubuntu, 13.10. To be thorough, I am using a German keyboard (which is already a pain), but I don't see why that should matter.  In Konsole, I can type the other character ('°') on the same key.\nI use this all the time in vim and it's annoying to copy and paste it.  I saw something similar here, but it wasn't solved.  One of the answers asked if the problem was reproduced in kate; it is.\nI could use another terminal emulator, I guess, but it would be nice to use Konsole. \n\nA: There have been many discussions about dead keys, how they should be used to be able to generate accented characters, etc. The behaviour of characters such as ~ and ^ may depend on your system's locale settings and the input method of the specific program.\nI personally find this bug report interesting.\nIf you hit a special character's key and nothing happens, chances are that the system is waiting whether you mean to input an accented character. Hitting  (space) should usually get you the character itself.\n", "Q: Change installation path / move programs I am using a 120GB SSD and a 1TB HDD.\nI created Ubuntu (home directory, etc.) on the SSD and stored some data (music, photos) on the HDD. Sadly the SSD is now full because of my games and programs.\nI searched to change the installation path of games or programs or to move some of them to the HDD but this seems to be impossible (without slowing it or some programs not working because they look for a specific library path).\nI know that I can move my whole home folder to the HDD but this will slow my system.\nI read that Ubuntu doesn't have a C:/Programs folder like Windows and in Ubuntu the files are splitted on their purpose (all libraries in one folder, all executable in another.. etc.). So is there a way to free up space beneath uninstalling programs? \nMaybe the mount process described here could help? I am fairly new to Ubuntu, so which folder could I mount and how to do this? What exactly does it do?\nAdditional:\nIf I try to add another directory for Steam (for my games) only the SSD gets shown and I can't toggle the view to get my HDD shown. Beneath that I could change the directory Spotify downloaded its music to the HDD.\n\nA: Create a folder on your HDD e.g. \"my_games\". Then copy all the contents from /home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/share/Steam to \"my_games\" on your HDD.\nThen open Steam:\n>> Settings >> Downloads >> Content Libraries\nClick on ADD LIBRARY FOLDER and select \"my_games\" (your HDD is mounted / found inside the /media folder(!)) on your HDD. Then select the old library folder and click on REMOVE LIBRARY FOLDE\nAfter closing the menu remove the old folder with: rm -r /home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/share/Steam\n\nA: That would be hard to do. Error-prone. You need to be a pro to do it. Better find some other way to free space. BTW, my Ubuntu lives on 40GB and has tons of apps - what did you fill it with? Steam games? They should go to HDD.\nMount your HDD to some folder like /mnt/games and move games there. I will not give instructions because you need to know mounting to use Linux. Search and study. \n\nA: I would say that the equivalent of C:\\Program Files is /usr, which you can mount on a separate partition. Just make another ext4 partition of a reasonable size during installation and mark it for mounting on /usr. Doing this post-install can be done, if you move everything to the new partition before mounting. \nThis can be done for most folders under /, indeed some people keep /home, /usr, /boot and /var on separate partitions.\nAs for Steam (assuming the Linux version), you can have a Library folder on other partitions, even NTFS partitions. For Steam on Wine, have you added the other partition mount points as drives in Wine?\n", "Q: Locally integrated menus (menus in title bars) only working selectively I upgraded to 14.04 and enabled locally integrated menus. However, they seem to work on a randomly selective basis. I've tried a few applications out - Firefox and LibreOffice work, but Terminal and Nemo do not:\n\nWhat's going on? How can I get the latter to integrate as per the former?\n\nA: First, open gnome-terminal (terminal) and then click edit, select prefrences and then disable the option \"show menubar by default in new terminals\". Close the prefrences menu, right-click anywhere on the output area and de-select the option \"show menubar\" before closing the terminal.\nNow, open a new terminal, right-click anywhere on the output area and select \"show menubar\". The menu should now display properly in the top panel instead of the window like it did before.\nNext, click \"terminal\" in the top menu, select \"prefrences\" and this time enable the option \"show menubar by default in new terminals\". \nThe menu should now display in the top menu instead of in the window from now on and the problem should be fixed.\n(tested on a newly installed ubuntu-desktop 14.04)\n\nIf you didn't already give this a try, you may want to see if this command-line option  works for those apps by disabling the integrated window menus for your user-profile using gsettings.\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity integrated-menus false\n\n\nAs far as indicator-appmenu is concerned, you can check to see if it's installed by typing the following command in an open terminal:\ndpkg -l | grep indicator-appmenu\n\nThe output should list indicator-appmenu if it's installed which I'm sure it probably is but you never know, if not, you can install it or even reinstall it just for good measure like this.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --reinstall indicator-appmenu\n\n", "Q: How to login with non-root user on crouton Chromebook I recently bought a Chromebook and followed the steps in this video to install Ubuntu via crouton.  \nOnce I logged into Ubuntu I logged out again, which brought me back to the chromeOS.  \nI hit CTRL+ALT+T to bring up the command screen, but don't know how to log back in with the username I created.   \nI have been running these commands to log in \nsudo enter-chroot\nsudo startxfce4\n\nBut this logs me in as root, which isn't ideal since I want to use Chromium browser.   \nI have no GUI to log in either and Chrome keeps starting in developer mode.  \nI have been searching and reading for hours and everything tells me how to log in as Root/Superuser which is the opposite of what I want to accomplish.\n\nA: startxfce4 starts XFCE as the user you run it as - root in this case.\nTo use GUI login, you have to install a display manager.

I'm not experienced with Linux.\nThank you!\n\nA: One of your two ubuntu entries boots Ubuntu via Shim (which then launches GRUB), which works with Secure Boot on or off. The other boots it via GRUB, but without Shim; this works only if Secure Boot is disabled.\nYou shouldn't be seeing the firmware's boot menu with the two ubuntu entries unless you hit a function key or Esc early in the boot process. (Precisely how you bring up this menu varies from one computer to another.) Thus, I recommend you leave it alone. You could remove the Boot0000 entry (which boots without Shim) or the Boot0001 entry (which boots via Shim), but doing so runs a (small) risk of user error or running into some new or obscure EFI bug that will end up creating new problems. Since the double-ubuntu issue is both a trivial cosmetic problem and unlikely to be something you see very often, IMO it's better to ignore it than to run even a small risk of creating a much bigger problem. Furthermore, the entry you remove might be added back the next time a GRUB update rolls around.\nIf you insist on removing one entry, do so with efibootmgr:\nsudo efibootmgr -b 0000 -B\n\nThis example removes the Boot0000 entry; change 0000 as appropriate to remove any other entry.\n", "Q: LMMS 1.0.2 Midi recording noise As shown in this YouTube video, the MIDI works well before recording. After recording, there is noise.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: What you're hearing is clipping, this occurs when the waveform changes sharply or suddenly, to a value more than the audio's maximum tolerance. It occurs most commonly in LMMS when a waveform is cut wrongly, which is likely what is happening here.\nMy first instinctive solution is to lower the instrument's volume, so your note isn't as likely to hit the audio 'ceiling'.\nIf that doesn't work, and your sound doesn't clip while playing, my personal best solution is to edit the instrument properties so that the envelope has a sustain / release value to it. This will lower the volume quickly instead of simply cutting off the note.\nThere are also other tools out there such as Audacity that have features/plugins to help remove clipping. If you're OK with it during production, you could simply go back over your exported sound and edit it.\nIf your instrument is always doing this, you should take a look at the MIDI velocity the notes are coming in at. It may be a bit too high for many instruments not to clip.\n\nA: Open Instrument settings, by clicking on the Instruments name in the song editor.\nWhen the Instrument settings window opens, go to the second tab. (You can change the tabs by using the bar that shows multiple icons like the midi icon or the fx icon.)\nThen when you are on the second tab, make sure that volume is selected(and not cutoff or reso)\nThen put the AMT (to the right of the envelope box) to maximum.\nLeave DEL at zero. Put ATT to somewhere around 0.05 and 0.1.\nLeave HOLD and DEC at default value.\nPut SUST to maximum, and REL also somewhere around 0.05 and 0.1\nIf you want to have a sustain like effect, you could also put REL to a higher value\n", "Q: Radeon Driver HD 6470M on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Couple weeks ago my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS was unable to start and wanted automatically update to 14.04 LTS. \nAll other programs and software I was able to fix and update but I cant find the way to set up my Radeon Drivers HD 6470M. \nOnly Catalyst 14.6 Beta sounds reasonable.

Is there are gui alternative to this? (on screenshot)\n\n\nA: The htop program doesn't require root access to see disk usage of your own processes and with a little configuration it lets you sort by read/write IO, and it's a great tool for interactively killing processes.\nIt's also terminal based, which has the advantage of working over SSH.\nGo to F2 (Setup) and then select IO_READ_RATE and IO_WRITE_RATE.\n\nAfter you're finished selecting columns, go to F10 (Done) and you will see the new columns, including IO_READ_RATE abbreviated as IORR and IO_WRITE_RATE abbreviated as IOWR.\nYou can sort by the relevant column with F6 (SortBy).

To prevent a directory from being deleted by the user which owns all rights to the parent directory (/home/pandya in your case) you have to use the chattr command.\nHere is an example:\n$ sudo mkdir dir1\n$ sudo chattr +i dir1\n$ rmdir dir1\nrmdir: failed to remove ‘dir1’: Operation not permitted\n$ rm -r dir1\nrm: remove write-protected directory ‘dir1’? y\nrm: cannot remove ‘dir1’: Operation not permitted\n$ chattr -i dir1\nchattr: Permission denied while setting flags on dir1\n\nAnd in Nautilus:\n\nPlease read man chattr for more info.\n\nA: Actually, directories are special files.\nIn a directory /home/user, the right of creating or removing entires (such as files or directories) is determined by the rights of /home/user itself, not by the rights of the entries.\nIn your case, it would be best to provide a subdirectory, such as /home/user/fixed, and set the rights of that to r-x. Then, the user will be unable to create or delete files or directories in there.

Note that (in\npre-CIDR notation) the first block is nothing but a single class A\nnetwork number, while the second block is a set of 16 contiguous\nclass B network numbers, and third block is a set of 256 contiguous\nclass C network numbers.\nAn enterprise that decides to use IP addresses out of the address\nspace defined in this document can do so without any coordination\nwith IANA or an Internet registry. The address space can thus be used by many          > enterprises. Addresses within this private  address space will\nonly be unique within the enterprise, or the set of enterprises which\nchoose to cooperate over this space so they may communicate with each\nother in their own private internet.\nAs before, any enterprise that needs globally unique address space\nis required to obtain such addresses from an Internet registry. An\nenterprise that requests IP addresses for its external connectivity\nwill never be assigned addresses from the blocks defined above.\nIn order to use private address space, an enterprise needs to\ndetermine which hosts do not need to have network layer connectivity\noutside the enterprise in the foreseeable future and thus could be\nclassified as private. Such hosts will use the private address space\ndefined above.  Private hosts can communicate with all other hosts\ninside the enterprise, both public and private. However, they cannot\nhave IP connectivity to any host outside of the enterprise. While not\nhaving external (outside of the enterprise) IP connectivity private\nhosts can still have access to external services via mediating\ngateways (e.g., application layer gateways).\nAll other hosts will be public and will use globally unique address\nspace assigned by an Internet Registry. Public hosts can communicate\nwith other hosts inside the enterprise both public and private and\ncan have IP connectivity to public hosts outside the enterprise.\nPublic hosts do not have connectivity to private hosts of other\nenterprises.\n\n\nExplanation\nYour Internet Connection is divided logically into two parts:\n\n*\n\n*The LAN - Local Area Network\n\n*The WAN - Wide Area Network\n\nThe LAN is managed by your router, and the WAN is managed by your ISP, who is a LAN themselves connected to a WAN, and ALL ISP's are like a railroad or highway.  The end of every ISP's highway ends by merging onto a backbone.  A backbone is the logical section of the Internet where traffic travels at a high rate of throughput.\nHow This all Works - NAT in Layman's Terms\nAccording to RFC 1631 - Network Address Translation, NAT was created to bridge the GAP between a LAN and a WAN.  Imagine the following:\nYou and I are two Medieval Kings in Neighboring Castles, separated by a Cobblestone Road.  We're nice Kings, but we follow strict security standards because the other kingdoms don't like us.  Each of us has a knight standing at our drawbridge.  If I want to talk to you I give my knight my information, and he travels down the road to your knight.  My knight gives your knight my information, and your knight carries it to you.\n\nGiven that story, my castle is my LAN, and your castle is Your LAN.  As kings, we each have a Private IP Address given to us by our Routers(Knights).  In order for me to talk to you, I  must tell my knight I need him to travel on the highway.  Our knights are smart.  They take the Private IP Address and stick it in one of their pockets, and exchange it with the Public IP Address in their other Pocket.  While traveling on the road(Internet), the knights only carry the Public IP Address.  When my knight returns from your castle, he switches pockets again, and exchanges the Public IP Address for the private one that he hid in his pocket, and gives me the information I requested from you without telling me the Public IP Address.\n\nThe Exchanging of Private IP's for Public Ones in the knight's pockets, and vice-versa is NAT.  The knight keeping track of the IP Addresses he gave the kings is DHCP.  When we add townsfolk, each person in town connected to the castle is given an IP address by the knight.  When the peasants need information from other peasants in the other kingdom the knight must travel the cobblestone road for them too.  When 2 peasants in the same castle need to exchange information, they still go to the knight, but the knight doesn't travel on the road, he travels within the castle as he knows the Private IP Address of every peasant.\n\nIn answer to your question above, WhatIsMyIP is giving you the IP Address, that the knight uses when he travels on the road between my castle and yours(WAN).  As such, I can use that information to find out which \"castle\" you live in.\nThe castle you were living in when you wrote this post was:\nThe Technical University of Dortmund in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\nIP Location Finder\nUpdate\nYou need to contact your ISP and ask them if your equipment is configured correctly.  Normally, you do not receive a Class A (10.x.x.x Address, because this address is non- routable according to the RFC from earlier) from an ISP unless IP sharing among customer LAN segments is occurring.  This saves the ISP money because they don't have to spend money on buying routable IP Addresses.  In my Analogy, the knight in your castle must go to another knight in a bigger Castle, and the knight from the bigger castle travels the road(Internet).  This method allows multiple knights to share one road traveling knight for many castles.  In the US, ISP's use one knight per every LAN.  In short ask your ISP if the 10. Address is legal before setting up SSH.  If so, you must set up SSH as a double pass.\n\n*\n\n*Forward all traffic from your WAN IP Address Port 22, 129.217.129.129:22 to your Primary ISP Address of 10.1.10.149, and then:\n\n*Forward all Traffic from 10.1.10.149:22 to your LAN IP Address of 192.168.1.4\n\nOn most Consumer Services setting up a Webserver this way is against the AUP/TOS, but since your ISP is a University, the rules may be different.  If your ISP tells you that IP Address of 10.x.x.x is incorrect have them help you fix it properly.  If you tell them you're setting up a home webserver to access remotely and they say it's against policy, use a service like DynDNS.  Last but not least, remember that since all these IP Addresses are Dynamic, you must redo the setup each time each IP Address in your setup changes.\n\nA: If your router has been assigned a 10.*.*.* address, then it is not on the public Internet, but is sitting behind another NAT router.

I started C++ programming in Windows using Code::Blocks, and would like to try the open source environment of Linux.\nI am looking to set up Code::Blocks IDE to develop in C++. I have installed it and used it to create my first hello world application in Ubuntu. I tried to compile and run it, but it has a debugger issue and what appears to be a link issue. When I first started the first C++ test.cpp project, it asked me what compiler to use, and it automatically detected the GNU GCC Compiler which I selected. \nDo I need to download anything from the repository to get my C++ code to run in Code::Blocks? Do I need to link anything in my build options that isn't done automatically?  \n\nA: Your C++ program is not running in Code::Blocks because you do not have a C++ compiler (a version of G++) installed, or if it is installed you have not configured the C++ compiler in the Code::Blocks compiler settings. The C++ compiler is not configured for any version of g++ by default, so it has to be configured in the Code::Blocks compiler settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the g++ compiler for C++\nsudo apt install g++ xterm \n\nOptionally install gcc too if it is not already installed.\nsudo apt install gcc  \n\n\n*Start Code::Blocks.  \n\n*Select Settings -> Compiler -> Global compiler settings (large blue gear icon in the left pane) -> Toolchain executables tab. \n\n*Select the Program Files tab. It has already been selected in the below screenshot. \n\n*Click the .. button(s) which are marked by the mouse cursor in the below screenshot. Navigate to /usr/bin. The C compiler should be gcc, the C++ compiler should be g++ and the Linker for dynamic libs should be g++.\n\n*Click the     OK     button to close the Compiler settings window.  \n\n\nNote: It is permissible to install later versions of gcc and g++ from the default Ubuntu repositories alongside gcc and g++ and select them instead of gcc and g++ in the Code::Blocks compiler settings. The latest versions of gcc and g++ in 19.10 and 20.04 are gcc-9 and g++-9.\n\n\nA: Basically, Code::Blocks doesn't require any additional configuration.\nYou should have installed g++ package. You can do it by issuing command\nsudo apt-get install g++\n\n", "Q: how to implement the functions which are defined inside the conio.h I wanted to use the conio.h header file in one of my C codes but as we know the header file is not available for Ubuntu, what should we do if we want to implement the functions if the header file conio.h, like getch() & getche() etc?\n\nA: Check curses.h, available here is a C library for a terminal user interfaces (TUI).\nconio.h was a C library for terminal user interfaces for MS-DOS systems not *nixes.\nHere is a turorial for the curses library and here is the official manual\nTo get the curses.h header type: sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev\n", "Q: Microphone on combo jack not working Asus A46CM My laptop Asus A46CM has a microphone/headphone combo jack.

On Windows the microphone working well, how to fix this on Ubuntu?\n\nA: You should go to System Settings > Sound > \"Input\" tab, and make sure the correct microphone input is selected and not muted.\n\nA: I think this is a bug that needs to be solved. \nA temporary workaround: install and run pulse audio control gui (apt-get install pavucontrol). In the input devices mute the external microphone and unmute the internal microphone. For me the internal microphone is listed as \"unavailable\" but it works when you unmute.\n", "Q: How to force restart of a dependent service in upstart?

I tried changing the permits recursively with the command: sudo chmod 777 -R /media/Folder but when new folders are created those have no permits again. \nAfter this i tried modifying the ACLs but i'm not really confident with these.

After the installer finished and the laptop rebooted the grub rescure booted. Great. I started the Ubuntu in Try mode and I saw the HDD drive was formatted and the Ubuntu istalled on this drive. WHAT? – I thought. \nThe Ubuntu istaller formatted my HDD with all datas on it.\nCould you please help me? I really would like to use Ubuntu. Unfortunately I can’t shrink my SSD drive (C:) because only 5GB allowed. I would like to make two partitions on my HDD drive and install the Ubuntu  onto one partition.\nI am sorry about my english if there’s any mistake.\n\nA: You don't need to make any partitions on the HDD, just leave some empty space before starting the installer.\nWhat probably happened is that you selected you HDD to install on and it had no free space available and it asked if you wanted to use the whole drive. You probably mist this and clicked next. \n\nA: When you installing Ubuntu, don't select \"Install It alongside Windows 7\".\nLook at the last line, you will see \"Something else\", select It and now, you can see partitions in your HDD. Select partition you want and click \"Install now\".\n", "Q: Installation on virtual LVM disks without partitions I am installing an Ubuntu server in a KVM/libvirt vm with the text/console installer.  \nI intend to hand over two LVM volumes as root and swap to the VM as virtual disks.\nThey are detected correctly as vda and vdb, however the installer seems to force me to partition those as disks, which would defeat the flexibility of LVM.\nHow can I install Ubuntu with formatting the virtual disks directly instead of using partitions, or is this a bad idea?\nMotivation:\nThe whole point is to reduce the complexity by removing an unnecesary level of abstraction from the storage hierarchy.\n\n\n*\n\n*physical drives: host:/dev/sd{a,b}\n\n*paritioning: host:/dev/sd{a,b}1\n\n*sw-raid: host:/dev/md1\n\n*lvm: host:/dev/vg0/mylv_root\n\n*VirtIO Disk guest:/dev/vda\n\n*partitioning: guest:/dev/vda1\n\n*filesystem: guest:/\nIn this layout, when allocation additional space to a single vm I have to go through these steps:\n\n\n*lvresize\n\n*parted, which is especially ugly\n\n*resize2fs\nTo reduce allocated space the other way around (which is even more ugly).\nFor backups (e.g. with lvcreate --snapshot), there is an additional step of kpartex as explained by psusi.\nI want to remove 6. from the equation because I don't see what value this abstraction provides. But it does cost by addition complexity, possible performance impact, and small space waste.\nHacky solution:\nUsing kpartx I was able to move the root filesystem from a \"bootstrap partition\" (within another temporary logical volume) to the target logical volume and then boot via direct kernel boot.\nkpartx -a /dev/vg0/mylv_bootstrapper\ndd if=/dev/mapper/vg0-mylv_bootstrapper1 of=/dev/vg0/mylv_root bs=4M\ne2fsck -f /dev/vg0/mylv_root\n# Edit fstab inside /dev/vg0/mylv_root accordingly\nresize2fs /dev/vg0/mylv_root\nkpartx -d /dev/vg0/mylv_bootstrapper\n\nHowever:\n\n\n*\n\n*This feels oddly hacky.\n\n*I don't really like the idea of direct kernel boot as I would have to manually update the kernel version of the guest in the host each time the kernel is upgraded.\n\n\nA: Well, you have to partition / format the space regardless if it is LVM or not.\nYes KVM will see the devices as \"vda\" and \"vdb\".\nIn general, although KVM uses raw partitions / LVM, IMO, it is much more reliable to just use a virtual disk. Takes the same space and you can always use LVM on the virtual disk and / or resize the virtual disk.\n\nA: Actually I found that there is a trival answer: If the logical volumes are formatted (e.g. host# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg0/mylv_root), then the installer will detect and allow to use them as \"parition 1 of the virtual disk\". It can then even reformat the partitions.\nHowever Grub will fail to install, direct kernel boot can be used instead.\n", "Q: Access forbidden 403 error in xampp I am very new to xampp. I have made a fresh xampp install with the following commands.\nsudo su\ncd /tmp\nwget bit.ly/1cmyrUo -O xampp-32bit.run\nchmod 777 ./xampp-32bit.run\nsudo ./xampp-32bit.run\n\nThen I made a perl file to check whether my xampp works.

What is going wrong?\nUpdate: this is now Bug #1350513 at Launchpad.\n\nA: If I understand your description correctly, you're saying you have to hold down the power button and then, only after that, can you then boot up the computer again (by tapping the power button, I presume). The reason I'm guessing this is that holding down a computer's power button doesn't usually reboot it--instead, it usually just forces it to turn off. And that means it really was on before you pressed and held the button.\nAssuming that's what's going on, this suggests your computer is actually not shutting down when you press Ctrl+Alt+F1, but instead that there is some problem displaying the console text (either a problem displaying all virtual console text, or a problem specific to whatever is running on tty1).\nYou can test for this and, if this is the case, fix the problem, by simply switching back to the virtual console that the GUI is running on, the same way you normally would: with Alt+F7 or Ctrl+Alt+F7.\nIf that works, you can try to work around your problem by using a different virtual console (for example, see if Ctrl+Alt+F2 works).\nIf you get get back to at least one other virtual console (even the GUI on tty7)--and you haven't deliberately made changes to your system to keep getty from running on tty1, which I presume you have not--then this may be separated into two issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switching back to a working virtual console, as above.\n\n*A bug interfering with the operation of, or the getty instance on, one or more virtual consoles.\n\n\nThis answer (attempts to) address the first problem; the second isn't a question for Ask Ubuntu but instead should be a bug report for Launchpad. I'm not altogether sure what package it should be reported against; if you provide details of what happens when you try this, perhaps someone will know.\nOn the other hand, if your computer really has shut down or is otherwise truly nonresponsive after you switch to tty1 with Ctrl+Alt+F1, then your entire situation is a bug (and the best you can do about it is probably report it on Launchpad). In this case, I can guess what package to report it against: the kernel, linux (and you can run ubuntu-bug linux to start the report).\n", "Q: Broken apt-get state after apache install error I tried to install php5 via\nsudo apt-get install php5\n\non my ubuntu 14.04 machine.

You will then be asked to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update all of your packages (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade)\n\n*Upgrade your BIOS if an upgrade is available.\n\n*Try the very latest mainline kernel to verify the bug has not already been fixed.\n\n*Follow the instructions at DebuggingKernelSuspend.\nEven if the bug is fixed in later mainline Linux kernels, it is still important to report the issue on Launchpad to ensure that the bug gets fixed in the Ubuntu kernel.\n", "Q: Ubuntu send alert mail if CPU usage continusly heigher than a certain amount I need a way to send alert email if the CPU usage is higher than 80% for more than 5 minute.

You need to create a folder - run mkdir /rootfs). Then you would need to mount your root file system (mount -o rw /dev/<...> /rootfs) and chroot into it (chroot /rootfs /bin/bash).\nThen you can mount your other file systems (mount -a). Then you are able to do whatever you want.\nDisclaimer: This is - as the question is, too - a cross-post from Super User.\n\nA: According to the manual, there are no file operation commands in GRUB (aside from ls). Well, it's a boot loader after all, not a file manager.\nSince your root directory is not in your partition root, I don't think it's possible to make your Linux boot correctly. You could use the normal command to get to the original boot menu and edit your boot entry so GRUB can find your kernel, but I don't think you can specify a specific subdirectory as your system root.\n", "Q: How do I use apt to install 32-bit OpenJDK-7-JRE on Azure AMD64 Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (Trusty)?

All I am trying to do is dualboot the latest Ubuntu and Windows 7 on my fairly new HP Mini 200. I am using this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK8X7_tYWmA for guidance. I have \"partitioned\" (set aside) 15GB of space to install Ubuntu. \nHere is a link to a photo of the installation process I am currently stuck at.\n\nI don't know what to do from here. Should I delete /dev/sda4 (HP Tools)?? If so, how?? \n Apparently it contains the BIOS part of the startup menu...\nAny help will be very appreciated. \n\nA: You need to use gparted and create an ext4 partition in that space you opened up, also there is no BIOS part of the disk, there is an MBR but that is not a partition and is not accessible from gparted or anything else. Once you have created the ext4 partition you restart the installation (sorry) and once you get to the screen you posted you select that partition, click \"change\" then set it as ext4, format, and set it as mount point /, then continue the installation following the prompts.\n\nA: You appear to have a system that boots via BIOS and that uses MBR partitions. MBR is limited to four \"primary\" partitions, and you've used all of them. MBR does support an essentially limitless number of \"logical\" partitions, but to use them, you must have a special type of primary partition called an \"extended\" partition, which you don't have. You have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can delete one or more of the existing primary partitions and use it to create new primary partitions for Ubuntu and/or create an extended partition and then create logical partitions within it.\n\n*You can use FixParts to convert one or more of your primary partitions into logical partitions. (FixParts will create the necessary extended partition as part of this process.) You'll then be able to create new logical partitions for Linux. Note that there are limitations on what you can convert. Also, Windows must boot from a primary partition. Thus, you may need to do some juggling to get this to work. (The FixParts documentation describes the issues in detail.)\n\n\nIf your computer supports EFI-mode booting, you could re-install Windows in EFI mode, or convert it to boot in that way. In EFI mode, you'll use the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which doesn't have the 4-primary-partition limit of MBR. Most computers sold since mid-2011 support EFI, although prior to the release of Windows 8, many manufacturers continued to use BIOS-mode booting.\n", "Q: Ubuntu stuck at black screen with pink diagonal lines after selecting \"Try Ubuntu.\" (Update - Still need help) I'm trying to follow the instructions from this site (http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/), but after selecting \"Try Ubuntu\", I'm stalled at a black screen with pink diagonal lines and it's been this way for almost a half-hour now.

I got Lubuntu to work on her computer, and it even let me mount and access the hard drive, however, when I click a folder, it tells me something like \"Corrupt\" and I selected the file manager to open it, but now it's saying \"input/output error\" when I try to access the users folder. Any idea why it's doing this?\nAnother Update: I made the mistake of giving in to my mother \"looking at it\" and she ejected the hard drive because she thought it was a \"down arrow\". I restarted and now it's not even recognizing it. I'm gonna guess that's probably not a good thing, and I'm really upset and frustrated at this point.\n\nA: Try reburning the disk, and if that doesn't fix it it may be a problem with the graphics card or something. You could try using lubuntu or a puppy linux livecd to copy the files off the disk as well as it doesn't require nearly as much graphics work.\n", "Q: How to create your own domain name from your IP and map/sync that with DNS server? Is there any way to create your own domain name instead of purchasing???\n\nA: The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is the international governing body that has responsibility managing the Domain Name System (DNS). Basically they sell the rights for registering domain names to corporations (click here for a full list of domain registrars). You can become a registrar, but it's probably not something you want to do if you're only after registering a few domain names.\nSome solutions that might work locally (on your home / office network):\n\n\n*\n\n*You could set up a DNS server on your network.\n\n*You could also edit /etc/hosts but that will only work on the computers you do it on. If you are managing a large number of computers, consider using a DNS server instead.\n\n\nOr you could check out services that provide free DNS services, such as no-ip.com, as mentioned in the comments.\nFinally, there are illegal solutions which will land you in jail in short order, a very bad deal instead of paying $2 or so.\n", "Q: Installing Teamspeak I want to install Teamspeak and found this tutorial.

My question is basically if there is anyway to reverse this and keep the boxes while still using the theme. I know I'd need to remove .svg files from the theme in my files, but im unsure which ones need to be removed. Any help would be great :)\n\n\nA: This very simply seems to be because some of the files in `/usr/share/themes/Numix Daily/unity' override background of the 'boxes' the launcher. The quick (and fairly messy way) is to run this to move the folder:\nsudo mv '/usr/share/themes/Numix Daily/unity' '/usr/share/themes/Numix Daily/unityX'\n\nA slightly better way is to make a backup copy of the unity folder, and remove those file beginning with launcher (I guess those cause the problem):\nsudo cp -r '/usr/share/themes/Numix Daily/unity' '/usr/share/themes/Numix Daily/unity-backup'\nsudo rm '/usr/share/themes/Numix Daily/unity/launcher*'\n\nA better way to this would be to selectively remove the relevant files (it should use the default ones then - the square ones seem to set the launcher box backgrounds), or to edit the files.\nTo edit the files, you can use 'Inkscape' - if you want to do it without running inkscape as root (if you do, use gksu), you can change the permissions of the theme directory instead:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER '/usr/share/themes/Numix Daily/unity'\n\nThis is also useful if you don't want to use terminal or Nautilus as root to remove the files.\nNote, keeping backup files makes life easy, and you probably need to logout and login again to see changes.\n\nBy the way, here is a screenshot of it working having moved the unity directory and logged out and logged in again (with Numix circle icon theme):\n\nIts quite a nice theme :D\n(nice idea of having the waste-basket icon as a recycling icon :)\n", "Q: printf, redirection, crontab I'm having trouble redirecting C printf statements to a file with a program running as root.\nI have a program with several informational printf statements and other libraries which print errors via stderr.

I'm trying to setup my laptop (Dell D420) with Lubuntu 14.04 and Libreoffice 4.2 to show a slide presentation to a VGA projector. I used ARandR to make a screen layout where the laptop screen (resolution 1280x800) shows the left side of the desktop and the VGA projector (1024x768) the right side.\nI tried a number of configurations and settings to no success except one that work partially: Going to Slide Show menu and Slide Show Settings I set Multiple Displays to All displays. In doing so I see the slide show on the projector but only the edition mode in the laptop screen.

I have used Linux a little bit in the past, but I would still consider myself a complete novice at it. \nI went through the process of making the bootable USB drive and also made a separate partition for me to install Ubuntu on. Somehow I must have selected an option that wiped the whole drive and installed Ubuntu instead of just on the partition I had made. (I installed 14.04 if that helps)\nSo once that happened, I tried using the Lenovo recovery button, called \"OneKey\", on my computer but that just takes me to the \"GRUB\" menu that has Ubuntu options. I have checked the hard drive and it appears that there are no longer any Windows partitions present.\nThe hard drive partitions that I see on GParted are:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1, fat32, /boot/efi, size: 512MiB, used: 4.36MiB\n\n*sda2, ext4, size: 114.86GiB, used: 10.82GiB\n\n*sda3, linux-swap, size:3.88Gib, used: 4.00 KiB\n\n\nI don't really have any crucial data that was on there, but I just want to have a working copy of Windows available for use since that is what I am most comfortable with. \nI tried calling Lenovo support but they said that I would have to buy a recovery disc, which costs $70. \nPlease let me know if there is any other information that I could give you to further assist me. \nThank you!\n\nA: As far as I know the Ubuntu installer has issues detecting a Windows installation on an EFI based machine (Windows 8 requires EFI, pretty sure the Yoga series is Win8 only?), therefore it doesn't give you the \"Install alongside Windows\" option any more and you have to do the whole partitions it should use etc. thing manually. If you don't Ubuntu will wipe your drive and create a new partition table.\nLong story short: \nYou could try one of these:\nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/data_recovery_with_testdisk\nhttp://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/recovering.html\nHow to recover a deleted NTFS partition with data\nBut I'm afraid you'll have to pay the 70 bucks..

It looks like you are correct and the windows and recovery sector of your hard drive are both gone. One option, I guess, would be to make the laptop a dedicated Linux machine?\nTyping windows 8 (or 7) recovery disk into amazon seems to give some options that are around $10. Does anyone have experience getting these to work?\nTheoretically there is a way you can make the recovery disk before you accidentally destroy your windows partition though I've never gotten it to work.

I would like to update it to the latest, 14.x? \nHow do I update?  Do I just over write the 8.10 with the latest?  do I wipe the 8.10 first then install? \nCan anyone please advise on this? \nMany thanks. \n\nA: The very best way to do it is to download Ubuntu from here.\nThen burn the image to disk or usb drive and set your computer to boot from that device and run Ubuntu in the try mode to see if you can run Ubuntu on that old of a computer, you may also want to try Lubuntu it is very light on resources. \nIt is best to reformat the drive and start fresh, you do not want to try to upgrade. \n", "Q: No menu bar and unity launch after upgrading to 14.04; ccsm cannot start Yesterday I upgraded from 12.10 to 14.04 by do-release-upgrade.\nThings were Ok after the upgrading. \nHowever today when I logged into my account, no menu bar, no unity launch.\nI tried ctrl+alt+F1 to open the terminal and re-installed Ubuntu-desktop, but it didn't help.\nThen I installed compizconfig-settings-manager.

According to the documentation for your CPU it's 32 Bit , that's why you download Ubuntu 32 bit. Most 32-bit OSes really only let individual applications use 2 GB of RAM, even if you have 4 GB installed. On the other hand if you would have 64bit CPU event with 2Gb of RAM you could install 64 bit OS for performance benefits.\nHowever the machine you have is really slow, I tried myself Ubuntu on it and the slow things made me crazy. I tried it with SSD insead of HDD and that was a bit of change, I stopped waiting for ages. So it's where we are, you can also get performance increase on it with SSD. \n\nA: This computer is certified for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. This does not mean that 14.04 will not work, however for better performance (more specifically Ubuntu Certified performance) it most likely will be best if you use 12.04. \n12.04's release cycle and EOL can be seen here.

A screen filled with a lot of Authentication Failure messages. Even when I only feed the iso to one of the programs and immediately recreate the iso.\nI found out, that it maybe it has something to do with the dynamically created default user called ubuntu, which the system uses as the user used to boot.\nIn the chroot environment I could not find the user in the passwd. I guess the generation process is defined in the casper.conf.  \nI tried modifying the casper.conf, but to no luck.\nWhy can't I just tell the system what user to use, when it boots?\nOr why does the generating process of the default user called ubuntu break,\nif I touch the iso? (maybe it does work, but the authentication on boot dislikes the generated user.)\n\nA: What worked for me was installing user-setup\nWhile recording my screen, I booted the LiveCD (in a VM) in \"text\" mode.\nWhile reviewing the text I noticed there was an error that it could not create the Live Session user and that chroot couldn't execute /usr/lib/user-setup/user-setup-apply because the file didn't exist.\nSo I customized my already-customized ISO, installing user-setup via apt-get (apt-get install user-setup) and I could finally \"Try\" my LiveCD without installing.\nI'm not sure how the user-setup package got removed during my customization process. \nWithout your LiveCD, it's difficult to diagnose what exactly caused your specific issue. But maybe this answer will help you fix your LiveCD or others encountering a similar issue who - like me - can't find any solutions online.\nOn another note, my previous post received a down vote and was converted to comment- I'm not allowed to comment because I don't have the reputation (that down vote doesn't help me get there).\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu and accessing NTFS drive I have two drives (C: , D:)  and both are formatted with NTFS.\nI have installed Windows 8.1 on the C drive and stored important files on D:.\nI want to install Ubuntu along side of Windows 8.1 by making a partition on C drive.\nAfter making a partition and installing Ubuntu, will I be able to access the D drive in Ubuntu or will have have an issue with the fact that it is in NTFS format?\n\nA: C: drive is a partition and you will have to install Ubuntu on a different partition.\nand\nYes, Ubuntu is capable of accessing and modifying data in NTFS.\n\nA: Your C: and D: might be two partitions on a single physical drive or two partitions on different drives. In order to install Ubuntu, you need to have a free partition. You can accomplish this in at least two ways:\n(i) either you move your content from D: to C:\n(ii) or you create a new partition by resizing one of your existing partitions (in C: or in D:).\nYou can do (ii) from Windows. In Win 8 right click on My Computer and choose \"Manage\". A window pops up: choose Disk Management in the nav. bar. Right click on the partition you want to shrink and choose \"Shrink Volume\". It only allows you to shrink the partition to the extent you don't damage any of the files in it. You get some unallocated space; you may define a new partition in there, if you don't Ubuntu will take care of that. Just don't format it from Windows: Ubuntu can read and write ntfs partitions, but it will format its own partition in ext3 (which in my opinion is far more efficient). Formatting your new partition as ntfs would be just a waste of time. At any rate, Ubuntu will automatically install in the free space or partition.\nThree suggestions. First, backup your important files on D: before resizing D: or C:.\nSecond, check that the new partition will be at least some 50 GBytes.\nThird, I'd prefer to shrink a data partition (most likely, D:) instead of the boot one, unless the latter is exceedingly large. If you are going to go on using Windows, you need to have a good amount of free space in it.\nAnd you'll have no trouble at all to access your Windows ntfs partitions from Ubuntu, both from a file manager or from the command line. It takes a single click.\nGood luck!\nA.\n", "Q: Node in MAAS not waking up on LAN I am trying to add nodes in MAAS cluster. I setup MAAS Server in VM using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

The template for wakeonlan in /etc/maas/templates/power/ether_wake.template checks for wakeonlan first and checks etherwake if wakeonlan is not installed.\nI found that my servers would wake up if I used etherwake, but not with wakeonlan.  etherwake defaults to using eth0.  My maas server needed to use em1 instead so I added the \"-i em1\" option to the etherwake command in the template, but maas still fails to wake up my servers.\nFound more.  etherwake uses udp which requires it to run as root, not the maas user.  The fix is to place the following line in a file in /etc/sudoers.d\nmaas ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/etherwake\nand adjust the following line in /etc/maas/templates/power/ether_wake.template\nfrom:\n/usr/sbin/etherwake $mac_address\nto:\nsudo /usr/sbin/etherwake $mac_address\nor if you need to use something beside eth0:\nsudo /usr/sbin/etherwake -i ethint $mac_address\n\nA: This didnt seem to work in version 2.2.2 of MAAS with my system, so I wrote a fix, based on a fix for a previous version\nhttps://github.com/yosefrow/MAAS-WoL-driver\nFollow the instructions in the README.md to install\nBasically, only etherwake worked on my system (not wakeonlan) so I rewrote the plugin to use etherwake.\n", "Q: How to re-install ubuntu that is pre-installed by manufacturer Actually I wiped off ubuntu 12.04 lts that was pre-installed by manufacturer and want to just have it back is there any of doing this.\n\nA: The simpliest way is to do a fresh install of Ubuntu.

I upgraded my kernel version to 3.15.7 (the last stable version to date). Now the wifi works like a charm! And much better than in 12.04. Thus, it seems that the wifi driver for my card (Realtek 8191SE) in kernel 3.13 was bad, or there were interferences.\nAnyway, I'll update the question to solved, just in case somebody else has the same problem.\nAbout how I updated the kernel version, I have just followed this link.\n", "Q: How to get VPN internal traffic and external internet traffic to work simultaneously I'm connecting to a Cisco compatible VPN, in Xubuntu 14.04.\nI can connect and access IPs and servers on the network. However, I cannot access external websites. When I change the settings this situation reverses and I can access the internet but not the internal stuff on the VPN.\nUnder VPN config -> ipv4 setting -> routes I have tried  all permutations of \"ignore automatically obtained routes\" and \"use this connection only for resources on its network\".\nI've also tried manually configuring the DNS servers for both the VPN and using Google's public ones, and the additional search domain for the VPN as revealed in syslog output when connecting to it.\nI've also done dpkg-reconfigure resolveconf to no avail.\nAll I want is to be able to connect to the VPN, access servers and IPs on it whilst also being able to access the wider internet without first disconnecting the VPN.\n\nip route output as requested\nno VPN:\ndefault via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0  proto static \n192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.1.151  metric 1 \n\nVPN:\ndefault via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0  proto static \n10.0.0.0/24 dev tun0  proto static \n10.0.1.0/24 dev tun0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.0.1.116 \n10.0.4.0/24 dev tun0  proto static \n10.0.6.0/24 dev tun0  proto static \nxx.xx.xx.xx via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0  proto static \n172.16.0.0/24 dev tun0  proto static \n192.168.1.0/24 dev tun0  proto static \n192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.1.151  metric 1 \n\n(xx.xx.xx.xx is my public IP)\n\nA: The problem was being caused by the router's settings.\nIt was using 192.168.1.x for the local range and when I changed it to use 192.168.0.x everything started to work properly.\nThe VPN was using IPs in two ranges - 10.0.0.x and 192.168.1.x. As my machine was assigned an IP in the 10.0.0.x range it wasn't clear that the VPN was also using a range that was conflicting.\n\nA: Your VPN server pushes routes that your VPN client sets. Those routes are ok, but the default route might be over the VPN connection. So after connecting to the VPN, just change the default route back to your normal one.\nRemove the default route in a terminal:\nsudo route del default\n\nAdd the new route:\nsudo route add default gw <ip>\n\nReplace <ip> with your route at home. If you don't know that ip, just type this command while NOT connected to the VPN (it prints your default gateways/routers ip):\nsudo route -n | awk '/^0.0.0.0/{print $2}'\n\n", "Q: Bluetooth icon issues I can actually use my BT keyboard to select an OS at start up.\nOnce Ubuntu starts and I try to search for devices they will flash in the window momentarily and not connect and then the menu bar bluetooth icon shows a lock, so I believe bluetooth  is being blocked by something as soon as it discovers any devices.\nLate 2011 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: I had to hold the right side button on both the keyboard and the track pad until they show up in the Add Device screen. \nThe keyboard was easy to set up. \nThe track pad would not pair the first 2 times, but I selected the 0000 pin option and 2 more times and it finally worked. \nI find that I have to unplug my usb mouse for the track pad to work properly.

I am new to juju. So far I have created and started deploying one application charm and sever charm separately.\nBut now from the application I need to add relationship to server charm and get details from server charm.\nDetails like public address and private address. I researched about how to add relations between two charms. But I am not clear about how to add relations and get details. I only know I want to add some parameter in metadata.yaml file.\nCan anyone tell me how to add relation and get details from server charm? Basically I need to provide IP address by server charm and after adding relationship from application charm need to read this IP address.\n\nA: How do I define a relationship?\nSo, in order to define a relationship between two charms you must first, as you have alluded to, define the relation in each charms metadata.yaml file. Since you've defined a server/client role I'm going to stick to that in my examples below with foo-server and foo-client charms. Since it's likely the server providing the majority of the data to the client their metadata.yaml files would look as such:\nfoo-server\nname: foo-server\ndescription: Something more than this\nprovides:\n  server:\n    interface: foo\n\nfoo-client\nname: foo-client\ndescription: Something more than this\nrequires:\n  backend:\n    interface: foo\n\nJuju has two primary relation types. Provides and Requires. In this case the server charm is providing \"foo\" as an interface. The client charm requires the \"foo\" interface to operate. This provides/requires lets juju know which charms can talk to which other charms.\nThe interface is an arbitrary name, in this case foo, but could be anything. There's a large list of already defined interfaces, such as: mysql, http, mongodb, etc. If your service provides one of these existing interfaces you'd want to consider implementing it. If not feel free to create a new one.\nHow do I get/send data?\nOnce you've defined your metadata, you'll need to create a few new hooks the hook names are defined in the linked documentation, but since you're just sending the address information we'll keep with a simple bash example of the implementation of each hook.\nSo, we have two charms, foo-server and foo-client. foo-server provides a \"server\" relation with the foo interface. foo-client requires a \"backend\" relation with the foo interface. Relation hooks are named based on the relation-name (not the interface name). These could both be called server, but to illustrate that juju matches on interface and not relation, I've made the foo-client relation name \"backend\".\nfoo-server/hooks/server-relation-joined\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -eux\n\nrelation-set hostname=`unit-get private-address`\n\nThis is a very basic example, where we're creating a relation key called hostname and setting the value, using unit-get command, to the private-address of the unit the charm is deployed to. This address will vary from provider to provider, but it will always be reachable within a juju environment. You can set multiple keys by adding a space between keys, for example:\nrelation-set hostname=`unit-get private-address` public-address=`unit-get public-address`\n\nThis will send two keys, hostname and public-address to whatever service it's connected to.\nfoo-client/hooks/backend-relation-changed\nNotice the difference in file name, this is invoking the relation-changed hook instead of relation-joined. Presumably the server is just giving the details of where it lives, so the client charm needs to know where that address is. By putting this in the relation-changed hook every time data on the relation is updated the hook is called again.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -eux\n\nserver_address=`relation-get hostname`\n\nif [ -z \"$server_address\" ]; then\n  juju-log \"No data sent yet\"\n  exit 0\nfi\n\n# If you've gotten this far, you have a $server_address, configure as you see fit\n\nNow, there's a little more involved in this hook. Taking it line by line, the first three are just standard stuff. It's a bash charm and set -eux is there to make sure the hook behaves as it should. The next line uses relation-get which will read relation data from the connection. Now, everything in a juju environment is orchestrated asynchronously. So you're never 100% certain you'll have data when you call relation-get. This is where the if block helps resolve that. If there's nothing in \"$server_address\", ie we didn't get a return value, the hook will simple exit. However, it's exiting with a zero status so it won't crop up as an error in juju.\nI know this seems counter intuitive, we technically have a problem because we don't have data. Yes, but, it's more along the lines of \"We don't have data, yet\". By exiting zero, once the corresponding service actually sets the value, it'll trigger the relation-changed hook again and we'll be able to read the value. This is considered an example of an idempotency guard which are crucial as you write hooks.\n", "Q: Virtual box File access I'm running Android on a VirtualBox on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine.\nI want to know if there is a way to access system files and images stored within this virtual android machine from within my host ubuntu machine.\nIs there something like a hidden file path I`m missing in nautilus or something)?\n\nA: I think it's not possible. virtual machines have special files that contains your second OS.

Nothing happens.\nAfters some searching on here I tried to update via terminal, but still no help.\nI can log in as a guest and I can log in via terminal but I cannot log in as normal and get access to my files. I am a newbie with linux and would like to back up my files and then just install something new. \nSo how can i back up my data while not being able to log in?\nAssistance appreciated.\n\nA: *\n\n*Enter Virtual Terminal (use Ctrl+Alt+F2 shortcut).\n\n\n*Log in to your account.\n\n\n*Plug in your pendrive (or if you have another partition for data, just do nothing).\n\n\n*Detect the number of your partition. You can get labels of partitions by issuing sudo blkid command.\n\n\n*Mount your desired partition:\nmkdir $HOME/rescue && sudo mount /dev/sd[letter of drive][number of parttion] $HOME/rescue\n\n\n*Copy your files:\ncp -Rv directory $HOME/rescue\n\nA: If you can login as guest you just have a problem with your usersettings. You can revert your usersettings by doing the following.\nLog into a terminal under your username and then type the following command (and press enter).\ncd ~/ && ls -A\n\nNow, you need to delete every file listed that begins with a period \" . \" (like .mozilla and .profile). This will delete your settings and profiles like your firefox profile but will leave your other saved items, software, downloads, documents etc. in tact. To do this, we will be using the rm command with the recursive option to delete these directories.\nJust type sudo rm -R followed by a single space followed by typing a list of the filenames you need to delete using only single spaces to seperate each name. You may then press enter after the entire list is done. \nexample:\nsudo rm -R .audacity-data .bash_history .bash_logout .bash_profile .bashrc .cache\n\n(I've only included 6 files in this example just to give you a rough idea of what you need to do; your list may very well include 30 or 40 files). \n**Also, remember and don't forget to include the period when you type each name.\nYou should be able to log right in but if not, save any unsaved files you might have been working on and reboot.\n", "Q: Automating rsync commands I currently have too many rsync commands that I run on a day to day basis.\nCould someone be kind enough to let me know how I can automate these commands?\nI am new to Linux so a little bit of explanation might be needed.\n\nA: So first save the following in a file named rsynccommands.sh\n#! /bin/bash\n\necho \"starting all\"\nrsync-command-1\necho \"completed 1\"\nrsync-command-2\necho \"completed 2, starting 3\"\nrsync-command-3\necho \"completed 3, starting 4\"\nrsync-command-4\necho \"completed 4, starting 5\"\nrsync-command-5\necho \"completed 5, completed all.\"\n\nThat is a bash script.\nMake the script executable:\nchmod + x /hom/USER/path/to/rsynccommands.sh\n\nThen run the command crontab -e and copy/paste the following:\n30 13 * * * /home/USER/path/to/rsynccommands.sh >/dev/null 2>&1\n\nThat will run the script every day at 1:30pm, the 30 being 30 mins past and the 13 being 1pm. The stars mean every day, month and year.\n\nA: You can use cron to schedule your rsync commands to run on a regular basis.\nThere is loads of information about cron on the web, but some terms to help you search would be cron, crontab, cron job.\ncron is the mechanism/software that runs scheduled cron jobs as specified in a crontab file.\nTo edit your crontab sun crontab -e. Each user on a system has their own crontab, you can edit the root user's crontab  by using sudo crontab -e if your job needs elevated privilege.\nThere is also a general crontab at /etc/crontab where you can specify which user to run the job as.\nUssually you want to stick with only editing your own crontab.\nA sample cron entry to run an rsync script every day at 5am would look like:\n5 * * * *   rsync command here > logfile.txt\n\n5 * * * * Means the 5th hour, of every day, of every week, any day of the month, and day of the week\nrsync command here Is obviously your rsync command.

So I burned a DVD with the .iso file and booted into it, started the install process and from what I see from the internet there should be an option to \"Install alongside...\", but I don't have that because appearently it doesn't recognize my windows install (I have one 500GB hard drive with 100GB free - all in one partition). So from what I saw I need to use fixparts to fix device sda which is my hard drive. But it warns me that it doesn't start from sector 1 and it can cause problems in certain OSs. I don't want to confirm it because I'm afraid it might corrupt my hard drive, is it safe?\nBefore I thought about writing this question I tried partitioning manually via the \"Something else\" option. But in all the guides I saw, they have \"free space\" as an option, while I have one partition that is 500GB with 400GB used, maybe I could change the size of my partition to 400GB and then I'll have free space, but then I have no space in windows 7, should I change the size to 420GB and the rest 80GB assign to linux partitions as the guide says?\nI would really appreciate it if you answer both my questions, or if you think answering one question will eliminate the need for the other, I'd appreciate that too.\nThanks.\n\nA: I have never used the automated partitioning tool as you mention in your first question. To that end, I'll say that it is not safe or at least not as safe as manually partitioning it.\nIf your hard drive only has 100GB of its 500GB free then yes, you should partition it to leave at least 30GB if not 50GB or more for Ubuntu. I have run Ubuntu with zero space problems with a 30GB partition. You should boot into Windows and using the Windows partitioning tool shrink your Windows partition to 400-something GB, leaving free space available for your Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: You have 100GB free on the windows partition. What you need to do is boot from the Ubuntu DVD you made and run a program named GParted. inside that program you can resize your windows partition leaving empty, unallocated space. Then you can launch he installer and do the 'install alongside' option and it'll see the free unallocated space and allow you to install there.  --- Have Fun!!\n", "Q: I can't find programs I've installed through Ubuntu Software Centre I've been trying to fix a few issues on my laptop, one of which is the fact that I use beats audio. I've been following these steps but I'm struggling to get past 2. I installed trusty1 from the link previous and it went through my Ubuntu Software Centre, but now I have no idea how to open hda-jack-retask because it doesn't come up in my apps menu and trying to run it through terminal just brings back \"hda-jack-retask: command not found\"\nHow do I find this program to open it?\n\nA: Its in the PPA description. Which was the first link in the steps you were following. https://launchpad.net/~diwic/+archive/hda\n\"PPA description\nThis ppa contains utilities related to HDA Intel sound cards.\nNote: as of Ubuntu 13.10, hda-jack-retask is part of alsa-tools.

Then, I'd like to reload these automatically.\nI have read that source does this, so I fired up my terminal and entered:\nsource /etc/profile\nsource ~/.profile\n\nFrom the terminal, it didn't output any error.\nHowever, putting these two commands inside the Bash script results in source: not found.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I be sure that the script is executed by Bash, even if #!/bin/sh is specified (apparently, it does not guarantee it)?\n\n*Why would it say that these two sources cannot be found when they are unmistakably there?\n\n\nA: See this SO question:\n\n/bin/sh is usually some other shell trying to mimic The Shell. Many distributions use /bin/bash for sh, it supports source. On Ubuntu, though, /bin/dash is used which does not support source. If you cannot edit the script, try to change the shell which runs it.\n\n\nA: Some shells support . instead of source. So you can try something like this\n. filename\n\ninstead of\nsource filename\n\nHope it works\n\nA: \n1. How can I be sure that the script is executed by Bash, even if\n   #!/bin/sh is specified (apparently, it does not guarantee it)?\n\nTo be sure that a script written for sh shell (as in your case - see What is difference between #!/bin/sh and #!/bin/bash?) is executed by Bash, just run the following command:\nbash script_name\n\nThus, you will not get that error anymore.\n\n2. Why would it say that these two sources cannot be found when they are\n  unmistakably there?\n\nIt doesn't say that those sourced files are not there. It says that the source command is not found. This is normal, because since you start your script with #!/bin/sh line, your script will run using sh and not bash as you may think. Why is it normal? Because source command is a Bash builtin, but not a sh builtin. To source a file in sh, you should use . (dot). Example:\n. /etc/profile\n. ~/.profile\n\nAnother way is to change the shebang line to #!/bin/bash as chaos said in his answer.\n\nA: /bin/sh is not bash. To execute your script with bash, write #!/bin/bash as the first line in your script.\nThe error source: not found is not dropped, because /etc/profile is not found. It's dropped, because source is not found. source is a Bash built-in function, and you don't execute the script with bash. So it's clear why it is not found. Change the #! line in the script, and it will work.\n", "Q: LaTeX Error: File `kpfonts.sty' not found I downloaded a template tried to run on my Texmaker.

In this case, it requires the latex package \"kpfonts\" which you have to install separately.\nOn Ubuntu, the best way to do this is an installation via apt-get.\nLet's do a quick search:\napt-cache search kpfonts\n\npoints you to a package called texlive-fonts-extra.\napt-cache show texlive-fonts-extra\n\ntells you that this package is a collection of different font packages, including kpfonts.\nSo the only thing you need to do is:\nsudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra\n\nIf you don't like installing all those other packages included in there, take a look at https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10316/how-to-install-new-packages-on-texmaker-on-ubuntu.\n\nA: You need to install the package texlive-fonts-extra.\n", "Q: can't compress whole file with tar? I'm not an expert with tar (xz) but I have a video (FLV) and it's size 95MB.\nI would like to compress it and I was using this command\nXZ_OPT=-9 tar -Jcvf myfile.tar.xz 1.flv\n\nbut I keep getting this error :\ntar: myfile.tar.xz: Cannot write: Broken pipe\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\n\nand myfile.tar.xz has only 24MB of my video.\n\nA: What is a tar archive?\nTAR is a file format holding multiple files in one. It was initially created for tape archives. Such a tar-file may be referred to as tarball.\nBy default there is no compression involved. However today's versions of tar can compress files using an external compression program if installed. With e.g. the command line option -z a gzip compression is made, with the option -a a file is compressed according to the file extension given (tar.gz > gzip, tar.xz > xz-compression, etc.).\nWhat compression to use?\nThe compression algorithms used with a tar archive are lossless, i.e. there will alwas be a limit below which we can not further compress data without a data loss.\nImages, videos, or audio files can be compressed using lossless formats but this is not done too often because these files are still too big for use in the Internet or on limited data storage.\nHence such files are compressed with a lossy compression algorithm. Mostly these losses will be almost unnoticeable but from highly compressed JPG-images, MPG-videos or mp3-audio files we all know of the artifacts that are introduced on compressing too much.\nWhy not use compressed tarballs for multimedia content?\nWhat was said above makes it obvious that after we had already chosen to use a lossy compression to crunch data down we can not further compress these date with an additional lossless compression algorithm. It would be a waste of time to try with only very little benefit. Sometimes a lossless compression may even lead to a growth of already highly compressed content.\nTherefore using tarballs on multimedia content is only done to hold more than one file in an archive but not to further compress it.\n\nA: I'm not sure whether compressing one file will reduce the size. But here is the command\ntar -cvf foo.tga filetocompress\n\nC is for create a tar file. Use xvf to uncompress\n", "Q: Reverting to open-source Radeon driver shows low resolution graphics I have tried to install the fglrx proprietary drivers for my Radeon 9000 (RV250) graphics card.

When i was installing ubuntu server. Installation prompt is asking me for a proxy information \"h ttp://[[user][:pass]@]host[:port]/\". Now what should i do.\n\nA: This proxy information is needed in the case when you're on a network that does not allow you to directly access the internet, and mandates you use a special server called a proxy.\nAs the installer has to retrieve informations from the web, it is giving you a chance to configure the proxy here.\nIf you are not aware of it (ie you're not on a corporate or university network for example), you most probably don't need it, so just skip this part.\n", "Q: Network-admin for server?

I just want to know, what are the disadvantages of using Ubuntu in VMware rather than then dual booting it?  Does Ubuntu get restricted somehow under VMware?\nAnd suppose if I install Code::Blocks for Ubuntu (installed through virtual machine) and then shutdown the OS.  If I start Ubuntu once again, will Code::Blocks still be present inside Ubuntu?\n\nA: In a virtual machine, Ubuntu will be as restricted as the VM configuration says it will be. SO if your system has 8 GB RAM but the virtual machine is configured for 2 GB only, then Ubuntu will only use 2 GB. You decide how much (or little) resources you want to assign to the guest system (i.e. the one inside the VM).\nVirtual machine \"disks\" are usually stored in files on your host filesystem. Assuming you don't delete those files, or delete the virtual machine entirely, the virtual disks are completely persistent; they act just like a real hard disk and whatever you put there will remain until you delete it explicitly or erase the virtual machine. Actually, you can delete the virtual machine but keep the virtual hard disk: think of it as removing and keeping the hard disk while throwing the computer into the trash :)\n\nA: I have run Ubuntu for several years in both dual boot and VM configurations, so I'll offer my experiences.\n\nI just want to know, what are the disadvantages of using Ubuntu in\n  VMware rather than then dual booting it? Does Ubuntu get restricted\n  under VMware?\n\nIt depends on what you intend on using your machine for.  At home, I dual boot Ubuntu 14.04 with Windows 7, because I do plenty of gaming on both.  Gaming consumes a lot of your system resources.  And in a VM, it's important to remember that your video hardware will be by-and-large emulated via software.  Try playing Minecraft on an Ubuntu VM, and you'll see what I mean.  VM technology has come a long way, but video-intensive applications still run better \"on-the-metal.\"\nAt work as a developer, I run Windows 8 with Ubuntu 14.04 on a VM.  I do this because there are Linux-based applications that I need to use and run (for my job).  And those tools are usually run in conjunction with Visual Studio projects.  So I do a lot of quick switching between Windows and Ubuntu, and that is just not possible with a dual-boot configuration.\n\nif I install codeblocks for Ubuntu (installed through virtual machine)\n  and then shutdown the OS. If I start Ubuntu once again, will code\n  blocks still be present inside Ubuntu?\n\nYes, your Ubuntu VM will store its data on a virtual disk.  Your apps and data will still be there, just as if you had installed Ubuntu as a standalone OS.\nImportant to note, but your VM will be restricted only by the resource limits (RAM, disk, etc...) that you configure it with.  Of course, if you give it too much, your host OS will suffer.\n", "Q: Ubuntu update caused system to freeze on boot at purple screen.

How can I make it work as good as possible?\n\nA: First, one needs to decide if the version in Ubuntu is not sufficient. If one does not need to work with keyframes and have subtitles displayed in the video in the subtitleeditor's interface, she does not need to do much (just install  gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg, see below). I am also told 32bit version works better, but I use 64bit version. \nFirst, we need to get build dependencies of subtitleeditor and remove the version from the repositories, if installed:\nsudo apt-get remove libsubtitleeditor0 subtitleeditor\nsudo apt-get build-dep subtitleeditor gstreamermm subversion\n\nAs subtitleeditor now uses Gstreamer 1.0, we need to install it:\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0*\n\nWe also need updated C++ bindings that are not available in 14.04, that is gstreammermm 1.0, so get it from here.\nInstall some dependencies and compile and install:\nsudo apt-get install libvorbis-dev libtheora-dev libasound-dev libxv-dev libvisual-0.4-dev libcdparanoia-dev\n./autogen.sh\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThen we need to get the source code of subtitleeditor:\nsvn co svn://svn.gna.org/svn/subtitleeditor/trunk subtitleeditor\ncd subtitleeditor\n\nNow let's build and install the application and link newly installed libraries:\n./autogen.sh\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo ldconfig\n\n", "Q: SNMPD on boot is not working as expected I am monitoring some computers on my enterprise network via SNMP.\nFor some reason the SNMPD service is not working as expected after reboot on Ubuntu hosts.\nLooking at pstree, I can see the snmpd service started under init root node, but requests going to this host fail.\nIf I restart the service with service snmpd restart, it comes under the lightdm/init node and works as expected.\nIs there something I am missing to make snmpd start on boot?\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with the gnome-shell interface.\n\nA: First Cheeck whether snmpd service is started on boot using below command. \nservice --status-all\n\nIf snmpd is enable to start on boot,You will see.

Is that create an user with name usermail on my Ubuntu?\n\nA: Assuming you have created a database named servermail, now the guide says that you must create a user named usermail with password mailpassword.\nThe names can change to whatever you like, just keep consistent naming.\nThe usermail user must be created inside MySQL shell. He is not related to system's users. \nIf you follow the guide and type: \nGRANT SELECT ON servermail.* TO 'usermail'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'mailpassword';\n\nin mysql> prompt, you will create a user named usermail that will have select privileges on servermail database which is located at local host (127.0.0.1) and the user's password will be mailpassword.\nIt is a copy & paste procedure just remember to set a secure password!\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04 - Closing lid doesn't immediately trigger xscreensaver When I close the lid of my laptop, it suspends.

Whatever I try it always gets installed an than I can't boot Windows from internal disk when the external disk (with ubuntu) is disconnected.\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu to the external drive, using the something else option, you need to ensure that you select the correct device for bootloader / grub installation. \nUsually Sda is your internal drive and your USB drive will be Sdb if you have no other USB devices connected.  \nThis way the internal hard drive / windows bootloader will not be modified in anyway.\nHave a look at my answer on How to Install Ubuntu To USB Drives, it has all the details and should help you.\nBelow is an image, showing the 'bootloader installation' menu highlighted in red at the bottom. \n\nImage Source : help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing.\n", "Q: Install Ruby, Rails, Gems, Passenger for 1.8.7 on Ubuntu 14.04 I am trying to move a Ruby site to a new host that's running Ubuntu 14.04, but it needs Ruby 1.8.7.

Please note that when I run ls -ltr / I get:\ndrwxr-xr-x 94 root root  4096 Jul 30 13:28 etc\n\nBut I don't think this matters because I've set myself up as a \"sudoer\", right?\nMore importantly, what do I need to do so that I can run sudo mkdir /etc/blah as my current user (myuser) without being asked for the password?\nHere's my entire /etc/sudoers file:\n#\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\nDefaults        env_reset\nDefaults        mail_badpass\nDefaults        secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot      ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\nfizzbuzz  ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL\nchadmin   ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\n\nA: It is the sequence/ordering of the rules that caused this. The last rule takes preference.\nIn order to fix your problem, simply move your lines,\nfizzbuzz  ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL\nchadmin   ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nfrom the sudoers file to \nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/myOverrides \n\nThis is better approach than editing the sudoers file with a plain text editor. If you accidentally insert errors into the file, you may not longer be able to run sudo. Always use visudo, so that the syntax is checked and you receive warnings about mistakes!\nYour directive doesn't work because it is overridden by:\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nIf you run the groups command you should see that your user belongs to these groups.\n\nA: If myuser is in the sudo group, then this order of the lines won't provide passwordless access (as noted by Florian Diesch), because the 3rd line overrides the 1st one.\nmyuser    ALL=(www-data:www-data) NOPASSWD: ALL\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nSo just put the lines into this order:\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\nmyuser    ALL=(www-data:www-data) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nUnder myuser account use sudo -l to check what permissions myuser has.\n\nA: If multiple entries match for a user the last one is used. So if fizzbuzz and chadmin are members of the groups admin or sudo they will be still asked for a password.\nPut the two lines at the end of the sudoers file after the #includedir line.\n\nA: Ideally if you are customizing what commands can be run via sudo you should be making these changes in a separate file under /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of editing the sudoers file directly. You should also always use visudo to edit the file(s). You should NEVER grant NOPASSWD on ALL commands.\nExample:\nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/mynotriskycommand\nInsert your line granting permission:\nmyuser ALL= NOPASSWD: /bin/mkdir\nThen save and exit and visudo will warn you if you have any syntax errors.\nYou can run sudo -l to see the permissions that your user has been granted, if any of the user specific NOPASSWD commands appear BEFORE any %groupyouarein ALL=(ALL) ALL command in the output you will be prompted for your password.\nIf you find yourself creating lots of these sudoers.d files then perhaps you will want to create them named per user so they are easier to visualize. Keep in mind that the ordering of the FILE NAMES and of the RULES within the file is very important, the LAST one loaded wins, whether it is MORE or LESS permissive than the previous entries.\n\nYou can control the file name ordering by using a prefix of 00-99 or aa/bb/cc, though also keep in mind that if you have ANY files that don't have numeric prefix, they will load after the numbered files, overriding the settings. This is because depending on your language settings the \"lexical sorting\" the shell uses sorts numbers first and then may interleave upper and lowercase when sorting in \"ascending\" order.\n\nTry running printf '%s\\n' {{0..99},{A-Z},{a-z}} | sort and printf '%s\\n' {{0..99},{A-Z},{a-z}} | LANG=C sort to see whether your current language prints AaBbCc etc or ABC then abc to determine what the best \"last\" letter prefix to use would be.\n", "Q: timeout during ssh connection I have an ubuntu pc in my office.

So I deleted one test file (/home/rch/hecatombe.txt).\nI can restore that file via Nautilus \"File => Restore Missing Files\" (as at restore a backup from duplicity )\nBut I prefer to work at the command prompt.\nSo I deleted that test file again, and did this at the command prompt:\nduplicity restore --no-encryption \"file:///media/TOSHIBA EXT/\" \"/home/rch/hecatombe.txt\"\n\nBut instead of restoring my file hecatombe.txt, duplicity made a new directory hecatombe.txt with contents like this /home/rch/locate_hecatombe.txt/home/rch\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: As you may have guessed, duplicity asks for a directory as the second argument when restoring files.

I would like to keep Ubuntu running. What exactly is the cause of this behavior?\n\nA: The cause is that newer Lenovo laptops have a lid switch.  By default, the computer goes into suspend when you close the lid, and wakes up when you open it.  My T440p, for example, doesn't have a keyboard \"sleep\" switch.  \nThis answer is unique to 14.04.  My older 12.04 setup was different (and more difficult to modify).\nOpen the \"Power\" settings by clicking on Unity gear icon at upper right hand side of display, then on \"System Settings...\", wait for the window to open, then click on \"Power\".  There are option pull-downs to select what happens \"when the lid is closed.\"\nI've set my \"when the lid is closed\" options to \"do nothing\" for both \"on battery power\" and \"when plugged in\" settings.  This inhibits the suspend action, but it nevertheless locks the screen, which you can see if you use your laptop with an external monitor.\nIt would, of course, be nice if it were possible to select whether the screen locks upon closing the lid, but that option isn't offered yet.\n", "Q: Deleted by mistake I deleted a huge folder containing mp3 & mp4 songs by mistake.

The files are not visible somehow. Can you please tell me how to recover it? I don't want this huge loss of my favourite items. \n\nA: You can view hidden files in Nautilus using the keyboard combo ctrl + h. Or using the menu: select View->Show Hidden Files. \nIf the files were deleted from an external drive they may be on that drive in a .trash hidden directory\nAs a ditch effort; if you know the name of a file (a good unique name) you can use the following to search the whole filesystem\nsudo find / -iname \"*<good file name>*\"\n<good file name> should be replace with a filename but keep the * on each side\nThat will take a while to run.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 won't boot even after Boot-Repair-Disk A fresh install of Ubuntu14.04 seems successful, but will not boot afterwards. 500Gb disk was formatted with Gparted to 499Gb ext4 with 1Mb unallocated prior to installation.

Any help is appreciated!\n\nA: It looks like you are using Ubuntu GNOME, which uses GDM as the Display Manager, as it is usually called. What you are looking for is LightDM, the default display manager of Ubuntu. You can install it using the command:\nsudo apt-get install lightdm unity-greeter\n\nChoose lightdm as the default when you are asked:\n\nYou can always change your default by using the command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\n(Or use any other DM you may have installed, in place of lightdm.)\n\nA: The Display Manager with the icons on the left is gdm I believe.  lightdm has a more windows-like toolbar in my opinion.  Another test when pressing super (windows button):\ngdm:  get the search bar all along the top of the screen, with lots of icons below it.\nlightdm:  pops up a shortcut bar on the left, search on top, workstations on right and open windows in center.\n", "Q: How do I install Minecraft Forge on XUbuntu 14.04 I have successfully installed and used Minecraft on my XUbuntu OS, but for some reason none of the tutorials on how to use Minecraft Forge have worked for me.

The following link also brings up a good question is \"either\" your ubuntu -or- the teamspeak you downloaded 32Bit instead of 64Bit?\nIf your ubuntu is 64 bit but the app is only 32 bit then you need to install the 32-bit compatibility libraries, you should be able to run 32 bit programs normally by adding:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\nThe folloiwing post also had good info for teamspeak setup:\nHow to install Teamspeak 3 client on ubuntu 12.04 lts 32 bit?\nit states:\n1) cd ~/Downloads (assuming saved in Downloads folder, otherwise where you saved it)\n2) chmod u+x ./TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_x86-3.0.12.run\n   OR if 64bit version: \n    chmod u+x ./TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64-3.0.13.1.run\n    ./TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_x86-3.0.12.run\n    OR if 64bit version: \n    ./TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64-3.0.13.1.run\n3) Press enter to view the user agreement\n4) Press Q to leave the user agreement\n5) Type Yes to create the folder (named TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_xxxxxx)\n6) Open the folder, Run program called ts3client_linux_x86 or ts3client_linux_amd64\n", "Q: awesome wm with xubuntu - setting wallpaper resets to default I am using awesome v3.4.15 (Never Gonna Give You Up) and (X)Ubuntu. My display manager is lightdm.\nIn /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua I've added this line to change my background to a solid color:\ntheme.wallpaper_cmd = { \"hsetroot -solid '#000000'\" }\n\nHowever, my wallpaper is always set to the default blue wallpaper on a reboot - even after pressing Mod+Ctrl+r, which reloads the config file by restarting awesome.\nWhen I execute hsetroot -solid '#000000' itself, it works like a charm. Reloading the config doesn't change anything, the background then stays the desired fixed color.\nTo reload my config, I've got the default command in my rc.lua:\nawful.key({ modkey, \"Control\" }, \"r\", awesome.restart)\n\n\nMy greeting login screen, which has the same wallpaper as the default blue desktop, is specified in /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter-ubuntu.conf and contains a line saying where this wallpaper is stored:\n[greeter]\nbackground=/lib/plymouth/themes/xubuntu-logo/wallpaper.png\n#background=#000000\n\nI changed it from #000000 back to the default [...]/wallpaper.png, after I've found out that switching from my user to guest/other in the menu of the said greeter resulted in the wallpaper being switched to a black wallpaper - the one specified in /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter-ubuntu.conf.\nThis is weird, because why doesn't this happen, when I select my user name in the menu, but with all other accounts?\nIf I switch the background setting back to the default value [...]/wallpaper.png, then selecting guest/other accounts in the menu results in the wallpaper being shown. It has a minor difference, though, to the default blue wallpaper I am having trouble with getting rid off: It doesn't have the weird 6-dots logo, which can be seen here again. So it is just the raw picture, that is located at /lib/plymouth/themes/xubuntu-logo/wallpaper.png.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why doesn't my background change to black, when setting background=#000000 in /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter-ubuntu.conf?\n\n*Where does this extra 6-dots logo come from?\n\n*Why is my config not reloaded when pressing Mod+Ctrl+r, resulting in the wallpaper_cmd to be executed?\n\n*Other than awesome.restart, how can I reload my awesome config to test it?\n\n\nA: I don't know the four questions I'm afraid.\nYour problem is that the colour reverts on restart? And that running the command:\ntheme.wallpaper_cmd = { \"hsetroot -solid '#000000'\" }\n\nsets it to black corectly.\nHave you tried adding a .desktop file in /home/<USER>/.config/autostart?\nRun these commands:\nmkdir .config/autostart\n\n(don't worry if it says mkdir: cannot create directory ‘autostart’: File exists. That means it was already there).\ncd .config/autostart\ntouch background-setter.desktop\ngedit background-setter.desktop\n\nIn the file should be the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Background Setter\nComment=Set background\n# the sleep and extra command is to ensure it runs, and then runs again incase there is another startup program that is breaking the settings.\nExec=theme.wallpaper_cmd = { \"hsetroot -solid '#000000'\" }; sleep 6; theme.wallpaper_cmd = { \"hsetroot -solid '#000000'\" }\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Application;\n\nThen make it executable\nchmod +x background-setter.desktop\n\nIt should launch on startup.\n\nA: You mention editing /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua. This is the global/default awesome config (which gets overwritten on updates btw). Your personal config at ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua gets used first. Edit this file and it should stick.\nhaven't got a clue about the rest.\n\nA: I use exactly the same configuration as you (Awesome inside XFCE).\nTo resolve this issue, I think you need to remove at least the xfdesktop4 package. When I look at my config, I also removed the xubuntu-desktop package. I didn't remember if both removals are needed.\nOne or two of these packages override the awesome desktop configuration. I think this is surely why you think your configuration is not updated / reloaded.\nCommands to remove the packages :\nsudo apt-get remove xfdesktop4\nsudo apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop\n\n", "Q: wlan0 not showing up....

From the list of packages provided, Apache, mysql, php and well, Linux are all included. (The list isn't in alphabetic order, so you might have to jump around a bit if you search within a browser.) When installing using the server edition, you'll be shown a \"Software selection\" screen which asks for tasks to install, and you can choose LAMP server from the list.\n\nDownload the Server image of your choice from http://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty/.\n", "Q: Can't acces admin account, how may I fix it? So when I try to log into the admin account i go right back to the log-in screen. And I've been searching around all over the internet trying to fix it, but then some other problems always comes along, how may I fix it?\n\nA: The administrative user in Unix systems is 'root'.  It is safest if you log in as an ordinary user and use the sudo command from the terminal to run commands with root privileges.  That way, you are less able to accidentally damage your system.  Unlike Windows, Unix commands really are normally run as an ordinary user, and some commands even refuse to run if you are root.\nUsually, Ctrl+Alt+T will start a terminal.  In the terminal, pre-pend your administrative command with sudo, for example sudo apt-get upgrade.  If you have a long sequence of commands to run as root, you can use sudo bash -login to run a login shell.  Then you no longer need to put sudo in front of each command.  Type exit or hit Ctrl+D to leave the root-enabled shell.\n", "Q: Whenever I try installing something from the software center it always says 'requires installation of untrusted packages' I am using software server 12.04 but whenever I try installing something like playonlinux for example it says Requires installation of untrusted packages and when i click details it gives me:\nfonts-droid fonts-horai-umefont fonts-unfonts-core gnome-exe-thumbnailer icoutils     \nlibcapi20-3 libmpg123-0 libpam-winbind libwbclient0 mesa-utils playonlinux \npython-wxgtk2.8 python-wxversion samba-common smbclient ttf-droid ttf-umefont \nttf-unfonts-core winbind wine wine-gecko1.4 wine1.4 wine1.4-common wine1.4-i386 winetricks\n\n\nA: It sounds like an issue with the GPG signing keys that are used to sign packages from repositories.\nOne possibility is that the software repository you are connecting to is out of date (by a significant amount eg weeks).

problematic but there are a few things we can do to help it work better usually.\nFirst in your router change 802.11bgn to 802.11bg.\nSecond change the wpa/wpa2 encryption to just wpa2 (CCMP)(AES) not (TKIP) if you have that option it will work best.\nThird set your wireless channel in the router to 1 or 11 then save the router configuration and reboot it.\nFourth go into network manager at top right corner of the screen and click on edit connections>wireless tab and set IPV6 to ignore.\nFifth open the terminal CTRL+ALT+_T then copy and paste the following code one line at a time for accuracy:\necho \"options rtl8192ce swenc=1 ips=0\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8192ce.conf\nsudo modprobe -rfv rtl8192ce\nsudo modprobe -v rtl8192ce\n\n", "Q: How can I make Ubuntu to run only one

Then from your dash search for startup applications. Click the add button. Copy the command where it says command and then save that.\n", "Q: Where is the update to 14.04.1 in update-manager? I am not looking for a workaround or a hack.  I am just confused.  14.04.1 has been released now for a week, and one of my machines which is on 12.04, and another one which is on 14.04 both don't have the upgrade options.  I see there is a 14.04.5 release on august 7th but I am not sure what a candence event is.  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseSchedule\nIt is hard to believe that it is not an issue that is going to be resolved otherwise I would hope this would be posted on the Ubuntu blog.  I cant be the only one on the last LTS waiting for it to update so I can finally go to the latest kernel and properly use my core i7 graphics.  \n\nA: Upgrading to a point release is not like upgrading to a new full release.\nJust do:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade (dist-upgrade as needed)\n\nand you will have the point release installed. \nYou can confirm your version with:\ncat /etc/lsb-release\n\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\"\n\n", "Q: Maven only invokable from terminal while root I'm following the directions laid out here:\nhttp://java.dzone.com/articles/installing-maven-304-ubuntu\nEverything is in the right place and the sym link is working correctly.\nHowever whenever I try to call mvn from the terminal, I get:\nxyz@xyz-laptop:~/Desktop$ mvn   \nThe program 'mvn' can be found in the following packages:   \n * maven   \n * maven2   \nTry: sudo apt-get install <selected package>   \n\nBut if I switch to root, then it works fine:\nsudo su\n\nroot@xyz-laptop:/home/xyz/Desktop# mvn  \n[INFO] Scanning for projects...   \n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE   \n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n[INFO] Total time: 0.079 s   \n[INFO] Finished at: 2014-07-30T18:11:54-07:00   \n[INFO] Final Memory: 5M/234M   \n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\nI'm very sure this is an issue with permissions but I don't know what to set the folders permissions to as I've never hit this error before.

How do I disable this? It's almost random, but most of the time, if I swipe from right to left on the touchpad of my keyboard, it opens the photo search.  I have not been able to locate any setting/tweak that explains this or would disable it. \n\nA: I am guessing this was a problem with a k400 or k400r wireless keyboard (or some other logitech equivalent). If so I finally found and answer\nFn + Right Click -> Enables/Disables Gestures.\nFn + Left Click -> Enables/Disables Tap to click.\nSorry for digging up such an old thread, but I have hit this question on AskUbuntu many times while trying to solve this problem over the years, so thought I would at east record the answer for myself.\n\nA: Logitech K400r sends Win/Super + C shortcut when you swipe from the right edge of the touchpad to left, when edge gestures are enabled (see the other answer). So you could possibly override the binding of that particular keyboard shortcut to another command, like sh -c : that does nothing but waste some resources for a short time. Or maybe you could even just remove that keybinding. The method for those depends on the desktop environment you use, but I don't go into more details in this answer. You may find an answer on how it can be done in Unity elsewhere.\nK400r has also some other edge gestures possibly issuing other keyboard shortcuts, but I don't know which shortcuts it could issue. See here for the edge gestures: https://www.logitech.com/assets/42364/8/k400-quick-start-guide.pdf\n", "Q: No sound in Xubuntu 14.04 I have dual-booted my Chromebook with Xubuntu 14.04 and have found that the sound is broken. I have tried everyhting that has been mentioned on the internet. I have restarted pulse, uninstalled it, unmuted sound in alsamixer, fiddled around with pavucontrol, and nothing. If this helps, there is no sound notifier in my taskbar, and I can't find a way to add one. Is it just it's unmuted in the hardware but the OS is just muted and I can't find a way to unmute it? BTW I have a Samsung Series 3 chromebook. \nUPDATE 1: I have gotten sound notifier in my taskbar now, and it's on full volume, but nothing comes out.\nUPDATE 2: I have tried installing drivers but they fail to install.\nUPDATE 3: In the volume control, when I play Youtube videos, it shows audio playing in volume control but no sound is coming out. No, my speakers are not fried as they work fine in ChromeOS.\nUPDATE 4: I uninstalled Pulse, and works on bootup, but the sound is blasting. When I lower the volume, it mutes. How do I fix this?\n\nA: Install the soundcard driver containing packages: \nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nThen reboot.\n\nA: Similar problem (Xubuntu 14.04).  After updating, sound sometimes stops working, even though both input and output show graphically as working in Pulse controls.\nSometimes it has been restored by changing selections in the Configuration tab, but sometimes not.  This is extremely frustrating, as it seems to be random both as to when updates do this, and when manually selecting configuration in Pulse control fixes it.\n", "Q: Writing a script to rsync all directories I have a huge set of backup files, each containing a directory of Videos.  Each video directory is slightly different.  I would like to merge these into a single directory to conserve, as I don't really care about which backup each Video came from.\nTo do this, I figure that rsync would be the best tool but I'm having difficulty coming up with a nice clean script to rsync each backup's Video directory with an outside destination.\nIn other words, I want a script that will automate the following process\nrsync -a ./Backups/Backup-x/Videos/ ./CollectedVideos/\nrsync -a ./Backups/Backup-y/Videos/ ./CollectedVideos/\nrsync -a ./Backups/Backup-z/Videos/ ./CollectedVideos/\nrsync -a ./Backups/Backup-t/Videos/ ./CollectedVideos/\n\nWhere all files in the Backups/ directory are \"fair game.\"\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: If at least one of the folders in ./Backups contains a Video directory,\nfor dir in ./Backups/*/Videos\ndo\n    if [[ -d $dir ]]\n    then\n        rsync -a $dir/* ./CollectedVideos/\n    fi\ndone\n\nmight be close to what you are looking for.\nThe /* after $dir is important to copy the files without including their directory.\n\nA: Did using wildcards not work:?\n rsync -a backup//Videos/ / \nThe other way is to use find and xargs:\nfind backups/Backup-*/ -type f -name \"\"| xargs -I {} -n 1 rsync {} / \nOf course, find is a very slow running command\n", "Q: Is there a plugin for keeping desktop icons same size and ordered? I would like to have all icons in the same size, and in a ruled desktop. Currently if I try to order my Desktop Icons they can be stacked on top of another, and I hate that, because if I try to place an icon in the middle of other 2, it gets, literally, in the middle, not replacing the bottom one and making it move one place like in Windows.\nThanks!\n\nA: I have the same problem, which I partially resolve by right ckicking and unchecking the keep aligned choice, arranging the icons close to where I want them to be, then checking the keep aligned choice again and seeing if it got them right.  The icons are inclined to get mispositioned when keep aligned is rechecked, so you may have to repeat this several times.\nUnfortunately, the icons sre likely to get scattered about the next time you log in, so I am afraid that this mismanagement looks like a bug in 14.04.\n", "Q: rc.local won't execute the script This is my rc.local\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\ncd /root/server/srv/\n./start_srv &\n\nexit 0\n\nWhen I execute\n    cd /root/server/srv/\n    ./start_srv &\n\nvia terminal myself, it starts normally and everything works\nbut when I try and do it through rc.local it wont start.\nI know rc.local doesn't need sudo etc.\nI tried executing rc.local myself through terminal and I get the error: \"Can't CD to...\"\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nls -ld /root: drwx------ 4 root root 4096,\nls -ld /root/server: drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096,\nls -ld /root/server/srv/start_srv: -rwxr-x--x 1 500 500 468420\nls -ld /root/server/srv: drwxrwxrwx 2 500 500 4096\n\nA: In order to verify your /etc/rc.local script you should use this command:\n  sudo service rc.local start\n\nWhen system init starts rc.local scripts it runs as root, but if you want to check your script, you need to become root via sudo command.\nThat is why you got errors like Can't CD to /root/server/srv/.\nIf your script doesn't work during startup process, consider that the environment is restricted, so you should define missing variables as your script needs. \nHere is an example.\nThe error:  /bin/sh: 0: Illegal option - is due to DOS file format.\nIn order to fix it you should install dos2unix utility and convert rc.local file:\n  sudo dos2unix /etc/rc.local\n\n", "Q: Cannot Install a software from software center in ubuntu 14.04 LTS I am new to Ubuntu.

I've acquired both a USB keyboard and a USB mouse. Currently my Apple machine is running only Ubuntu 12.04.\nSince I am not familiar with any Linux application designed for this purpose, any help will be greatly appreciated.\n\n2014-07-31\nThanks very much for your kind suggestions.  I am under the impression that the hot keys on a MacBook Pro work only in OSX. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\nJulianloui   \n\nA: After hooking up the cables, go to displays (Settings--> Displays). There, you can set up the monitor. There, shut off the built-in display of the MacBook and clicking on the VGA display and enabling it. You can set up the settings (like the resolution) of the monitor also. \n\nA: If you navigate to \"System Settings\" from Launcher or from Dash and select \"Displays\" you should be able to select which display you would like to use. Make sure the display is powered on when you try to access it.\nMost laptops also have hotkeys to change whether they are using the video output, the built-in display, both, or neither. Best of luck.\n", "Q: Trouble Creating a simple script I just wanted to create a script that opens Teamspeak. I was on here before about that, but I thought it would be more simple by just creating a script.\nI wanted to make a script to launch the script that opens Teamspeak.\nSo I did this:\n#!/bin/bash\nexec /home/austin/Programs/Teamspeak/launch(what I renamed the file to for ease).sh\n\nI named this Teamspeak.sh and it didn't work. The thing that is frustrating is that it works if I go into terminal on the Desktop and type\n./Teamspeak.sh\n\nit works! \nHow can I get this to work by just double-clicking it?\n\nA: I'm not sure where you're \"double clicking\" on it but if it's in Nautilus there is a setting in preferences about how to handle executable files.  It's on the \"Behavior\" tab of the preferences dialog.\nSpeaking of executable, you did chmod to make your script executable right?\n\nA: Easy way, right-click Teamspeak.sh on your desktop. Click Properties. Go to Permissions tab, and tick the Execute option at the bottom. Click OK, and now try double-clicking it.\nYou may have to use dconf-editor if it doesn't ask you if you want to run, or launch it immediately.\nIf you don't have dconf-editor you can install it by\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nThen type dconf-editor into your terminal to open it. \nNavigate to org ➤ gnome ➤ nautilus ➤ preferences\nand look for executable-text-activation\nClick the option next to it and choose whether you want to launch or ask\nClose dconf-editor and now double-click it. \nIf you chose launch it'll run your script the same as if it were a program.\nIf you chose ask it'll prompt you with the options to Run in Terminal, Display, Cancel, or Run \n", "Q: How to contribute binary .debs for others? I routinely work with Armhf devices, however not all the packages I use exist in a form that apt-get can easily install. Therefore I spend a lot of time compiling from source packages that exist on x86 and amd64 repositories. \nIn order to save my time in the future and others time as well, is there a way that is approved to build binaries and then push them back to the repository for others to use?\ncheers\n\nA: If you are talking about saving specific debs for other machines for offline install use dpkg-repack but if you want an offline repo for your own use there are ways of doing that (though not an area of my expertise) and it takes up maybe a terabyte at most.\n\nA: Update 2:\nPPAs on Launchpad can be used for distributing packages for the x86/amd64 architectures. Other architectures are usually only available for the core team. As @saiarcot says, ARMhf builds can be made available for public PPAs on request:\n\nYou may request an ARM build on your PPA if\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Your build takes 4hrs or less to build\n  \n*You have less than 10 builds a week.\n  \n  \n  To make this request please file an question on Launchpad and it will be dealt with. Note requests are dealt individually and Launchpad reserves discretion on the final say.\n\nSo the simplest way would be to set up a private repository.\nTo get to the main repository is a bit more work. The Ubuntu Wiki article on Contribute To Ubuntu has a lot of detail about this. Essentially, you start of by uploading and maintaining something for the Universe repository and then once you have gained experience, apply for contributing to the Main repository.\n\nThis is what PPAs are used for:\n\nUsing a Personal Package Archive (PPA), you can distribute software and updates directly to Ubuntu users. Create your source package, upload it and Launchpad will build binaries and then host them in your own apt repository.\n\n", "Q: Problem with Dell TEAC CAB-200 installed 14.04 I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and I can not get it to recognize my bluetooth adapter.

At first it was just an occasional annoyance, but it's really beginning to interfere with my work (I'm typing this in Windows).

the sources you add with the sources you already have - Dell OEM sources in my case - but an initial step that can get you up and running is to make sure you have a working 'main' repo, which might

Logical partitions are defined using a linked-list data structure, which means that each partition definition includes a pointer to the next one in the list. (The final one is obviously an exception; its pointer is a code to terminate the list.) Given that all your logical partitions (/dev/sda5 through /dev/sda60) are identical, my suspicion is that you've got one logical partition that's pointing to itself, thus creating an infinite loop of identical partitions. This is obviously not good, and any program that lacks an explicit way to deal with such an error will misbehave in one way or another. That includes the Linux kernel, and it's conceivable that this is the cause of your kernel panics.\nIt's possible that my FixParts program (part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu) will fix this problem, but I don't recall what, if anything, I did to handle such problems. My suspicion is that I just limited the number of partitions it could load, so it will stop after a while. It should then note the overlap and omit all but one from the table it writes out. OTOH, it's possible that FixParts will crash and burn. FixParts doesn't write anything to disk until you tell it to do so, though, so even if it crashes, it shouldn't make matters worse.\nYou may have one or more partitions lost after that one -- your disk is 488,397,168 sectors in size, but the final partition on the disk (not counting the extended partition, which is just a placeholder for logical partitions) ends at sector 39,395,296. If you're missing partitions, you'll need to use a tool like TestDisk to recover them. It's also possible that TestDisk could correct the problem with your infinite loop of partition definitions.\n", "Q: reinstalling ubuntu with wubi to repartition So, here's the issue: My ubuntu partition is too small. I was running 12.04 and went to 13.04 but lost support and disk space in the process. \nSo, I figured I could just log back onto windows (I dual boot) and reinstall with \"wubI\" because I still have bios. \nSo my questions are.. \n\n\n*\n\n*do I have to manually remove ubuntu first? \n\n*Will reinstalling it over the current version repartition my drive? Or what? \n\n\nI don't feel super safe repartitioning it manually as I don't know what to do. \nAny help is greatly appreciated! \n\nA: You can resize partitions using gparted.

My system keeps notifying me to upgrade to the latest release, claiming that \nYour current Hardware Enablement Stack (HWE) is going out of support\non 2014-08-07.  After this date security updates for critical parts (kernel\nand graphics stack) of your system will no longer be available.`\n\nHowever, when I run sudo do-release-upgrade, Ubuntu says I have no updates available. In addition, changing the prompt parameter in /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades to prompt=normal instead of prompt=lts throws the following error:\nChecking for a new Ubuntu release\n404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.14 80]\nErr Upgrade tool\n404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.14 80]\nFetched 0 B in 0s (0 B/s)\nWARNING:root:file 'quantal.tar.gz.gpg' missing\nFailed to fetch\nFetching the upgrade failed. There may be a network problem.\n\nThis seems weird to me as Quantal isn't even the current release, so I don't know why the system would be looking for it.\nPeople have suggested appending the -d flag to the do-release-upgrade command, but the documentation says that this will install the development version of 14.04 which I don't want.\nAny help would be appreciated to get me around this roadblock.\n\nA: You have to reinstall the update manager. First, remove/purge it:\nsudo apt-get purge update-manager-core update-notifier-common\n\nThen have a look at the console output. If it tells you, that some directories could not be removed, delete them manually. In my case:\nrm -rf /var/lib/update-manager\nrm -rf /var/lib/update-notifier\n\nIf you are on 13.04 or later, you should also do this to clear cached update messages:\nsudo rm /var/lib/ubuntu-release-upgrader/release-upgrade-available\n\nThen update your sources:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nReinstall the update manager:\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core update-notifier-common -y\n\nOnly if you are currently on an LTS and want to upgrade to latest LTS, make sure that in /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades you have set:\nPrompt=lts\n\nOtherwise (upgrading any version to a newer version) set:\nPrompt=normal\n\nNow dist-upgrade should work:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 and XAMPP Installed xampp 1.8.3 on ubuntu14.04 on a laptop. I want to access files on this xampp from my desktop. What things do i need to do all this stuff. For example i want to put ubuntu.iso setup file in htdocs folder and then download this setup file from my desktop. How do connect from my desktop to this xampp to achieve this? I have a LAN cable and also a bsnl wifi router.\n\nA: Once Xampp is started then you should be able to access it by typing the Ip address of the host of xampp. For example:\nIf xampp is on computer A, with an ip address of 192.168.1.100, then the only thing you should have to do on computer B is go to your Internet browser and type 192.168.1.100 in the address bar. \n", "Q: Can't open Software Center I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and I cannot open the Ubuntu Software Center.\nI keep getting this error: \n    bash: /usr/bin/software-center: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nI've noticed the change when I updated python to version 3.4.1, and can't figure out how to fix this problem. Can someone explain to me what I'm failing to understand? \n\nA: System configuration of Ubuntu written in Python. So It needs proper installation and compilation.\nYou try reinstalling Python, try to install and compile using the following commands,\n# wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.1/Python-3.4.1.tar.xz\n# tar xJf ./Python-3.4.1.tar.xz\n# cd ./Python--3.4.1\n# ./configure --prefix=/opt/python-3.4\n# make && sudo make install \n\n\nTo get Python compilation components(if not exists in your s)do the following,\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential\n\n\nA: Reinstall the system Python with:\napt-get install --reinstall python2.7-minimal python-minimal\n\nIn future, either use Deb packages, or install your custom software to /usr/local, or - even better - compile and install everything as a normal user (without root).\n", "Q: Why does what the updater tell me vary? I have updates set to run immediately:\n\nWhy do I sometimes see this window, with \"Updates are ready to install\":\n\nAnd sometimes see this, with \"X.x MB to download\":\n\n\nA: The download was triggered by the \"security\" setting. \"when there are security updates\" does not mean it downloads just the security updates. It will download all updates (and (I assume) will only install the security related updates).\nThe image without the download did not have a security update. \n", "Q: Deleting multiple name-sharing folders with one command I want to delete one hidden folder from multiple locations at the same time using a single command.\nIt's located on multiple locations (about 100).\nIs there any command which helps to delete this fast?\n\nA: you can use find for your purpose. See man find for more.\nSay you have a directory 'mydir' in which there are several directory and sub-directory that contain a hidden folder, say '.src'. Also the directory 'mydir' itself has '.src' directory.\nmydir\n├── a\n│   └── .src\n├── b\n│   ├── j\n│   │   └── .src\n│   ├── k\n│   │   └── .src\n│   └── .src\n├── c\n│   └── .src\n├── d\n│   └── .src\n├── e\n│   └── .src\n└── .src\n\nTo remove all these folders name .src open a terminal and go to 'mydir' and use tha following command,\nfind . -iname '.src' -type d -exec rm -r {} \\;\n\n", "Q: Can't upgrade from Ubuntu 10.10 to latest version I'm using Ubuntu 10.10. I want to upgrade it to the latest version but I'm just unable to do so. When I press Alt+F2 and write \nupgrade-manager-c-d\n\nand run it, it says \nError stating file '/home/ann/upgrade-manager- c-d': No such file or directory`\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: You're misspelling the command (and also passing flags to it incorrectly).\nDon't run upgrade-manager-c-d. Either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run update-manager -c -d instead, if you want to perform the upgrade with a graphical utility. (This is probably what you want.) That is, the command contains the word update rather than upgrade, and spaces before the dashes are required. Or\n\n*run do-release-upgrade -d instead, if you want to perform the upgrade entirely from the command line.\n\n\n(There are two main causes of confusion surrounding when spaces have to be used in commands, in Ubuntu. You might have intended to type the command with spaces; that is, it might a typo. Or you may be used to Windows, where command-line flags starting with / needn't be preceded by a space. For example, dir/s and dir /s have the same effect, on the Windows command prompt. In Ubuntu, flags starting with - do need to be preceded by whitespace.)\nAlso, it is odd that it looked for the command in your home directory. This suggests you may be starting the command with something like ./, that is, that you may be running, ./update-manager. Basically the only time you need to start a command with ./ is when you are deliberately attempting to execute a file you know is located in you current directory and not provided as part of Ubuntu.\nSince Ubuntu 10.10 is end-of-life (and has been for some time), you will probably need to follow these instructions before attempting the upgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install software or upgrade from an old unsupported release?\nThat explains how to add the old-releases software sources. Since 10.10 is so old, you may need to perform multiple upgrades: 12.04 is the lowest release with current desktop support.\n\n\n*\n\n*10.10 → 11.04 → 11.10 → 12.04.\n\n\nOnce you get to 12.04, you can upgrade to 14.04 directly (if you wish), since 12.04 and 14.04 are both LTS releases. Or you can stay with 12.04--because it is an Long Term Support release, it won't go end-of-life until April 2017.\nEspecially if your Ubuntu system is only lightly used and lightly customized, you might prefer to reinstall than to perform multiple upgrades. You should of course always have backups made of documents and other important files, but if you decide to reinstall Ubuntu, it's especially important that such backups exist and are current.\n\nA: You should do a fresh install buddy otherwise you have to go through number of intermediate versions before you reach latest version.\nYou should either go with latest long term supportted Ubuntu 14.04 or latest yet to be released Ubuntu 15.10 (to be released on October 22 this year). Don't install Ubuntu 15.04 because it will lose support on this October 22 when Ubuntu 15.10 will be released.\n", "Q: No new mail notification in Thunderbird I am using Thunderbird 31 on Ubuntu. I set up my accounts and then I closed Thunderbird.  \nBut I'm not getting any notification.\nIs there any add-on I need?\n\nA: Use firetray:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/firetray/\nYou can configure close button to minimize to tray, control notifications etc.\n\nA: Thunderbird needs to be launched to be able to see new message notifications.\nIt can be minimized, of course, and the email icon at the top of your screen will turn blue in colour when new mail arrives and the icon in the launcher will indicate the number of emails yet to be read.\nYou can also enable Workspace Switcher in System Settings > Appearance> Behaviour (if not already done so) and launch Thunderbird in another workspace so that it doesn't detract from screens you use for launching other things.\n\nA: Thunderbird needs to be open if you want to get notifications. \nBut you can use addons to \"hide\" it in the tray.\nThere is an addon called Minimize to Tray in Thunderbird to achieve that.  \nOnce you've installed it press F9 to minimize Thunderbird to the system tray.  \nYou will keep on receiving the notifications when it is minimized.\n", "Q: Dropbox - Ubuntu 14.04LTS In the last few days I have noticed an oddity with the Dropbox folder in the Home directory.\nI cannot be certain whether it is Ubuntu or Dropbox influenced hence the question here in case someone else has experienced it or can offer advice.\na file .dropbox (openable with geddit) which contains some lines of text:-\n(dp1\nVtag\np2\nS'dropbox'\np3\nsVns\np4\nL113047945L\ns.\n\nand a folder .dropbox.cache which itself contains another folder prefetch_cache which doesn't contain anything appears in the Dropbox folder which is used to sync with dropbox.\nWhen closing down my PC last night (as the previous night) these files/folders were removed by me from the >Home>Dropbox folder. This morning, on switching on the PC, I checked the >Home>Dropbox folder to see that the files had returned. They are date/time stamped the time I switched my Ubuntu machine on.\nI then checked my Dropbox account on the web by launching the dropbox website from the dropbox icon at the top of the screen and bizarrely these files/folders are not shown to be present - effectively invisible to dropbox itself.\nYesterday, following researchon this site, I opened a terminal and typed: \n`rm -R ~/Dropbox/.dropbox.cache/*`\n\nThis does not seem to have have had a desirable effect as evidenced by the same problem appearing this morning.\nThis is not affecting my installation in any other way, just a curious annoyance deserving of some attention to get to the bottom of it.\nAll suggestions gratefully received.\n\nA: The .dropbox file is used by Dropbox itself to track shared folders. So you should absolutely not delete it! It is not uploaded to your Dropbox, as Dropbox explicitly ignores it. This is outlined in their FAQ here:\n\nIgnored files\nSome small system files aren't synced over Dropbox. These include:\n\ndesktop.ini\nthumbs.db\n.ds_store\nicon\\r\n.dropbox\n.dropbox.attr\n\nThe folder you are talking about is mentioned here:\n\nHow do I clear my cache?\nDropbox keeps a cache of files hidden in your Dropbox for efficiency and for emergency purposes. If you've deleted a lot of files from your Dropbox but the file size has not changed to reflect the deletions, the files you deleted may be kept in your cache folder.\nYour cache folder is automatically cleared every three days. If you need to delete sensitive files immediately or need to clear up some space on your hard drive, you can manually clear the cache by following these steps:\nrm -R ~/Dropbox/.dropbox.cache/*\n\n", "Q: Alsa driver update in client machine without make I have a linux system and updated alsa from 1.0.23 to 1.0.25, It works as expected.\nSteps which I performed to compile:\n./configure\nmake \nmake install\nNow , I have 100's of client machines in which I need to deploy this ALSA update.

It was working fine in 13.10.\nThanks.\n\nA: I have been instances like that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Setting and open Display (It symbol is computer screen).\n\n*On pop-up windows, It has two squares (Built-in Display and Unknown Display)\n\n*Select Unknown Display and turn off it.\n\n", "Q: Unity sidebar and window frames disappear when I click on an icon with 2 or more dots (multiple windows) How can I restore Unity to it's original installation settings?\nBackground\nIn normal operation, Unity shows up to three dots next to an icon on the left sidebar when the application has 2 more more windows open. E.g. multiple file manager windows or chrome etc.\nThe problem\nUsually, when I click on such icons with the dots, I am expecting the display to 'scale'/zoom-out to show the windows (expose on the Mac is similar). This used to happen but today what happens is that when I click on the icon, the Ubuntu side-bar disappears and the frames around all the currently displayed windows disappear such that I can no longer move them.\nWorking toward a solution...\nI know that this worked fine after installation, and for quite a while after that, several months in fact.\nWhat I'm looking for is a sequence of commands that return the Unity window system back to that state where it worked.\nA temporary work-around that I know of is setsid unity which I can issue in a terminal window (if one happens to be open at the time the unity side bar and window frames disappear). What setsid unity does is restore the unity sidebar and side frames - but not permanently - in this case - because clicking on an icon with dots by it still causes unity to disappear. So in this case, setsid unity does not deal with the root cause.\nSo, I'm looking for something to permanently return the state of the unity window manager, so that this problem does not matter.\nNote: \nI have not tinkered with my setup in this regard what-so-ever. The problem just seemed to happening. I can only guess that closing the lid of my laptop put it into standby which caused some kind of upset (usually it's fine).\n\nA: A performed a standard update may fix the issue and then a re-install of unity:\nHow do I reinstall Unity? \nAt least one of these 2 steps fixed the issue for me - by that I mean the update may be enough.\n", "Q: Why does the \"watch\" command starts two \"watch\" and a \"sh\" process?

I find it very annoying that the icons on the desktop are not aligned in a proper grid.\nThe icon sizes are not consistent and longer file names are shown on multiple lines, this is just plain ugly and annoying if I have many items on the desktop.\nAlso, the keep aligned option doesn't help to align horizontally. Is there a way to override this, to have same icon size and limit the file name shown so that it looks perfectly aligned ? \nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: you can align/save/restore the desktop icons on 14.04 if you are using nautilus as your file manager ... There is a script/app to do this .. Just download Happy Desktop at gnomefiles.org. The script can align the desktop icons to a grid that you define by setting the number of icons per row and icons per column you would like for your desktop.

I do not care much about programs, I will backup  /usr/share/applications/whatever icons i created and /opt and use Aptik for the rest, but it would be more convenient for me.\n3-If there is not such an option, what all do I backup, other than the ones mentioned above?\n4-Which one method is more recommended, in-place or fresh with backup and restore install?\nPlease help me, as my system is strangely unstable.\n\nA: *\n\n*It is and it isn't.

It will remove the current DE though, yes.\n\n*I would suggest you backup /home/USER and also run the command dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall. That will give you a list of the programs currently installed. Don't just copy them immediately. That could break it because of hidden files.\n\n*I would advise new install, it is less likely to have recurring problems (like mutations in DNA get worse over time, so do bugs sometimes).

I tried dconf tools and tweak tool, I set it to hibernate but no change.  Also tried HandleLidSwitch=hibernate still no success, and I also tried enabling hibernation in polkit.\n\nA: How big is your swap partition/file? You need 1.5 times the amount of your system RAM to be able to hibernate. Less than this means hibernation will not work.\nEg: If you have 8GB RAM, then you will need 12GB of swap space to be able to hibernate.\nWhy is this? Well, hibernation physically turns your PC off, which means the contents of RAM which cannot survive a lack of power, must be dumped somewhere before switching off. When you come out of hibernate, the data is re-copied back into RAM before \"resuming\" the system.\nSince PC's now come with gargantuan amounts of RAM as standard, hibernation is not really very practical anymore, particularly when you consider that going in and out of hibernation on a modern PC takes longer than shutting down and booting it from SSD. \nWith improvements in power management such as offered by Intel's Haswell chipset, you're far better off suspending rather than hibernating because it could happily sit there for a week in suspend mode while using one-tenth of bugger-all power.\n", "Q: I can not boot from any device except hdd My Notebook does not execute any Bootable DVD or USB at all.

I have asked this question some people, and they told me my Notebook is not ok, it is an old one.\nI want to know if I can Install Ubuntu from Windows.\n\nA: Your notebook can't be that old that it can't boot from USB or optical disc.\nGo into your BIOS settings and check the boot order of your system, or see if there is a key you can press during the POST process (Power On Self Test, usually when the manufacturer logo appears on-screen) that will bring up a boot device menu to choose from.\nFor example, on Lenovo PC's, you can press the F12 key repeatedly on the logo screen until a boot menu appears and you can choose to boot from HDD, optical drive or USB stick/HDD if one was detected. On other brands like HP, ASRock or Gigabyte it's sometimes F2 or F10 or F11. Samsung laptops typically use the ESC key.\n", "Q: Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 Disable Touchpad While Typing Not Working I am using Ubuntu GNOME 14.04.\nThe \"disable touchpad while typing\" setting in the system settings does not work.\nAny permutation of the \"syndaemon\" command does not work.\nIt is really annoying, when I am typing all of a sudden the focus will be on a new window, or a large chunk of text will be gone, etc.\nI am using a Dell Inspiron 14 5000 series laptop, no proprietary drivers being used.\nI also tried installing Pointing Devices from the Software Center and disabling from there. Did not work either.\nThere's the answer to this question: Touchpad issue: jumping cursor while typing (Ubuntu 14.04), syndaemon don't help but I don't want to try recompiling drivers unless there is definitely no other solution. Also there's this: https://gist.github.com/silverhammermba/a231c8156ecaa63c86f1 but this also involves patching drivers (also not clear how to apply it).\nHow can I get this to work? \n\nA: I know exactly what the problem is (at least in my case which seems identic). It's because you're missing librecord.so . The GNOME setting require this file because it use syndaemon with -R option. As far as I know, that file has been dropped and no longer shipped with xorg-server.\nThere are many hard way you can actually achive disable typing function. Here from the easiest :\nUsing syndaemon Directly\nJust launch\n    $ syndaemon -d\n\nor with option you may like. See syndaemon -h.\nJust remember, without -R switch.\nPatch the GNOME settings daemon\n\n*\n\n*Download the source available at\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-settings-daemon\n\n*https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-settings-daemon/ (for Pure GNOME)\n\n\n\n*Apply the following patch : http://pastebin.com/1xHukxR0\n\n*Compile or build the package.\n\n*Install and Done!\n\nNB : Sorry, I don't provide the exact step as I'm not Ubuntu user again.\nRecompile xorg-server with XRECORD\nShortly, compile with --enable-record and possibly --disable-xtrap.

The correct way of limiting is described in this Unix & Linux Stack Exchange question.\nHere is the short version:\necho 350 | sudo tee /sys/class/drm/card0/gt_boost_freq_mhz to set the boost clock to 350MHz.\necho 350 | sudo tee /sys/class/drm/card0/gt_max_freq_mhz to set the max clock to 350MHz. \nSupported clock speeds may vary between models. \nTo see the clock speed change in action, use intel-gpu-overlay (part of package intel-gpu-tools).\nNote: if the max clock is set to 650 and boost clock to 1250 then under heavy load the boost clock will be used. \nThink of it like Intel Turbo Boost for CPU-s, max clock is the base clock speed and boost clock is the turbo boost clock speed.\n", "Q: reinstalling boot loader after linux partition removal The process: I had a Windows 7 partition and an Ubuntu 11.04 partition on the same  HDD.

I'm not sure if my fail2ban is running.

I used the entire disk (500 GB). Now the disk looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Filesystem partition1 496GB ext4\n\n*Extended partition2 4.3GB\n\n*Swap partition5 4.3GB\n\n*Free space 1.1MB\n\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, there should have been only two partition, incl. swap. I had Kubuntu installed previously. What is the reason behind this?\n\nA: On MBR (or MSDOS) partition tables, there are three types of partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Primary\n\n*Extended\n\n*\n\n*Logical\n\n\n\nOperating systems like Windows can only be installed on primary partitions. Linux doesn't usually care.\nOnly four primary partitions can be made, and only one extended partition can be made at the expense of one primary partition. If four primary partitions exist, no more partitions can be added without deleting an existing partition first. \nSo the default behaviour of Ubuntu's installer is to create an extended partition if none existed. When using the whole disk, it uses one primary for / (and one for /boot if LVM was used) and creates one extended partition with  a logical partition for swap.\n\nA: In this case there ARE only two partitions - the first 496GB partition and the Extended Partition.\nWithin the Extended Partition are volumes (not partitions - you can't have partitions within partitions). In this case you have a swap volume only plus some free space.\nI recommend doing the following setup in future:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition 1 of no less than 20GB for just the root \"/\" filesystem.\nThis is where the OS and your installed applications will go to and system updates are also cached here. If you are going to install lots of apps, perhaps bump this up to 50GB or more.\n\n*Partition 2 of no less than 2GB for \"swap\", aka virtual memory. If you have 8GB or more\nRAM, then don't bother with swap - you'll never touch it with so\nmuch RAM in your system, so save the space and use it for something\nelse. The installer will complain, but you can tell it to ignore and continue.\n\n*Partition 3 will be the remainder of the drive for the home \"/home\"\nfilesystem. This is where your personal data is stored and\nphysically keeps it separate from the OS. In the event you need to\nreinstall the OS, you can do so by telling the installer to format\nthe root filesystem but to preserve the home partition. No data\nlost.\nYou are able to create one more partition be it a partition or extended volume. If you believe you need more than four partitions, then setup the extended partition and make as many volumes as you need inside it.\nOnce you become more advanced, however, consider looking at Logical Volume Management (LVM) instead of traditional partitioning. It's very cool.\n", "Q: Can't login after sleep (Ubuntu 14.04) I've got Ubuntu 14.04 installed on my laptop (Lenovo Z570), and it is fully updated. The trouble is that when I wake it from a sleep long enough to require entering my password to login, it won't let me enter my password. The field is there, and the cursor is blinking, but nothing happens when I type. The pointer works, so I can switch users to get back in, but that's the only way I can get to login. \n\nA: I had this issue once, and if memory serves it was an NVidia graphics glitch, not a login glitch. In my case I switched to another console (CTRL+SHIFT+F1), logged in there and upgraded to a newer NVidia graphics package - I think I was running 304 and upgraded to 331, rebooted and the login screen rendered correctly this time.\nIf you're running an Intel GPU, however, I suspect that won't be your problem.\nIf your machine has hybrid graphics like NVidia Optimus (combined NVidia and Intel GPU such as included in the Lenovo T410s), remember to install the Bumblebee package so it can manage it properly.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 - You have held broken packages This is a very popular question, but bear with me as I have tried everything you are all about to suggest.

I am trying to write to /etc/network/interfaces with a user that does not have root privileges. \nThe reason for wanting to write to this would be to allow the user to set a static IP since I am running a command line only server.  What permission do I need to give user in etc/sudoers?\nI do not want the user to have full root permissions.  Just ability to edit this file.\n\nA: Prepare a script that do the editing you want, for example a script that write the correct file with the static IP (what to put in this script is out of the scope of this Q&A). Let's call this script /root/set_static_ip. (1) \nEdit /etc/sudoers (2) (with visudo is better, it checks for sanity, it is very difficult to recover a system with an invalid  sudoers file, even impossible from remote (3)), and add \nuser_name_to_authorize ALL=NOPASSWD: /root/set_static_ip \n\nNow that user is able to use sudo /root/set_static_ip  without any password asked, and the script will run with all privileges; no other command will be allowed. \nIf you want the user to just replace a file with whatever they want, the script could simply be (call it /root/unsafe-overwrite-interface) \n#! /bin/bash -e\n#\ncp /tmp/temp-iface.txt /etc/network/interfaces \nexit 0\n\n... and you tell the user to edit /tmp/temp-iface.txt and then run sudo /root/unsafe-overwrite-interface --- enabling it in sudoers as specified above. Or you can add the user to an ACL list and give them write permission on the specific file. \nBut notice that if you do not check the file contents for safety, havoc will happen, either intentional or unintentional. \n\nFootnotes: \n\n(1) this script must be as safe as possible. Check inputs and so on. It will be executed with full permissions. \n(2) in modern sudo installation, you can add a file to /etc/sudoers.d/ directory which is better --- will survive updates.\n(3) I normally keep a terminal with a root session open (sudo -i) when I modify the sudoers mechanism, and a backup handy.  \n\nA: Instead of usingsudo, just set an ACL on the file:\n$ ls -l /var/tmp/foo\n-rw-rw---- 1 root root 4 Jul 31 15:26 /var/tmp/foo\n$ sudo setfacl -m u:white:rw /var/tmp/foo\n$ whoami\nwhite\n$ cat /var/tmp/foo\nbar\n\nNow the file is owned by 'root' but the user 'white' can read and write to it.

How can I find out what versions of Python I have?\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr).\n\nA: When you run python in the terminal, it will produce output like this: \nPython 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) \n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> \n\nSee the first line - Python 2.7.6.\nAlso run python3.

If you have 2 or more python 3.X.x versions, you will only see the latest one.\nBy default on 14.04, you have 2.7.6 and 3.4.0. As you can see, I have updated to 3.4.1. I know that I still have 3.4.0 because when I go to /usr/bin I see python3.4, and if I run /usr/bin/python3.4 in the command line, I get 3.4.0, and running /usr/local/bin/python3.4 gives me 3.4.1 \nMy pronouns are He / Him\n\nA: Type following in the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\npython -V\n\nor\npython --version\n\n\nYou can  find a list of options/parameters for many commands in the terminal by typing the command followed by --help\nExample:\npython --help\n\nManual/manpages also available for most of such CLI which can be displayed by man <command> (Ex: man python)\nFrom man python:\nCOMMAND LINE OPTIONS\n        -V ,  --version\n              Prints the Python version number of the executable and exits.\n\nThere is also python3 installed on many machines, so you can do:\npython3 --version\n\nto find out what python 3.x you are running.\n\nA: You can also check Python version from code itself using platform module from standard library. There are two functions: platform.python_version() (returns string) and platform.python_version_tuple() (returns tuple). Script:\nimport platform\n\nprint(platform.python_version())\nprint(platform.python_version_tuple())\n\nRunning:\n$ python test.py \n3.4.1\n('3', '4', '1')\n$ python2.7 test.py \n2.7.8\n('2', '7', '8')\n\n\nA: python --version\n\nand \npython2 --version\n\nshow the version of Python 2.x, \npython3 --version\n\nthe installed version of Python 3.x\n\nA: Easily, open the terminal and do the following: \nWrite \npython\n\nto verify your 2.x version\nIn my case, it will appear:\nPython 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) \n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\nFor the 3.x, write:\npython3\n\nIn my case, it appears:\nPython 3.4.0 (default, Apr 11 2014, 13:05:11) \n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\nFor both cases, to get out from Python shell, write:\n exit()\n\n\nA: *\n\n*In shell terminal\n$ which -a python lists all your python.\n$ which -a python2.7 lists all your python2.7.\n$ /usr/bin/python -V gives information about the version of /usr/bin/python.\n\n*check in python script\nhere is an ilustration in ipython shell:\nIn [1]: import sys\n\nIn [2]: sys.version\n2.7.11 |Anaconda 2.5.0 (64-bit)| (default, Dec  6 2015, 18:08:32) \n[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)]\n\nIn [3]: sys.version_info\nsys.version_info(major=2, minor=7, micro=11, releaselevel='final', serial=0)\n\nIn [4]: sys.version_info >= (2,7)\nOut[4]: True\n\nIn [5]: sys.version_info >= (3,)\nOut[5]: False\n\n\nA: If you want to see all versions of Python available as commands, run compgen -c python. E.g:\n$ compgen -c python | sort -u\npython\npython2\npython2.7\npython3\npython3.4\npython3.4m\npython3m\n\nIf you want to get the version of each of the above:\ncompgen -c python | sort -u | grep -v -- '-config$' | while read -r p; do\n    printf \"%-14s  \" \"$p\"\n    \"$p\" --version\ndone\n\npython         Python 2.7.6\npython2        Python 2.7.6\npython2.7      Python 2.7.6\npython3        Python 3.4.3\npython3.4      Python 3.4.3\npython3.4m     Python 3.4.3\npython3m       Python 3.4.3\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*This ignores aliases. For example if I had alias python=python3, the above would still show 2.7 for python. To include aliases, you could use eval (though this might be unsafe):\neval \"$p --version\"\n\n\n\n*I'm filtering out the python*-config programs with grep -v since they don't support the --version flag. For example:\n$ python3-config --version\nUsage: /usr/bin/python3-config --prefix|--exec-prefix|--includes|--libs|--cflags|--ldflags|--extension-suffix|--help|--abiflags|--configdir\n\n\nA: You can use python -V (et al.) to show you the version of Python that the python command resolves to. If that's all you need, you're done. But to see every version of python in your system takes a bit more.\nIn Ubuntu we can check the resolution with readlink -f $(which python). In default cases in 14.04 this will simply point to /usr/bin/python2.7.\nWe can chain this in to show the version of that version of Python:\n$ readlink -f $(which python) | xargs -I % sh -c 'echo -n \"%: \"; % -V'\n/usr/bin/python2.7: Python 2.7.6\n\nBut this is still only telling us what our current python resolution is. If we were in a Virtualenv (a common Python stack management system) python might resolve to a different version:\n$ readlink -f $(which python) | xargs -I % sh -c 'echo -n \"%: \"; % -V'\n/home/oli/venv/bin/python: Python 2.7.4\n\nThis is real output.\nThe fact is there could be hundreds of different versions of Python secreted around your system, either on paths that are contextually added, or living under different binary names (like python3).\nIf we assume that a Python binary is always going to be called python<something> and  be a binary file, we can just search the entire system for files that match those criteria:\n$ sudo find / -type f -executable -iname 'python*' -exec file -i '{}' \\; | awk -F: '/x-executable; charset=binary/ {print $1}' | xargs readlink -f | sort -u | xargs -I % sh -c 'echo -n \"%: \"; % -V'\n/home/oli/venv/bin/python: Python 2.7.4\n/media/ned/websites/venvold/bin/python: Python 2.7.4\n/srv/chroot/precise_i386/usr/bin/python2.7: Python 2.7.3\n/srv/chroot/trusty_i386/usr/bin/python2.7: Python 2.7.6\n/srv/chroot/trusty_i386/usr/bin/python3.4: Python 3.4.0\n/srv/chroot/trusty_i386/usr/bin/python3.4m: Python 3.4.0\n/usr/bin/python2.7: Python 2.7.6\n/usr/bin/python2.7-dbg: Python 2.7.6\n/usr/bin/python3.4: Python 3.4.0\n/usr/bin/python3.4dm: Python 3.4.0\n/usr/bin/python3.4m: Python 3.4.0\n/web/venvold/bin/python: Python 2.7.4\n\nIt's obviously a pretty hideous command but this is again real output and it seems to have done a fairly thorough job.\n\nA: For bash script to recognize which python command to use:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nusage() {\n    echo \"Put your help/usage explanation here\"\n    exit 1\n}\n\nget_python_version_to_use() {\n    if python3 --version 2>&1 | grep -q \"Python 3\" ; then \n        echo \"python3\"\n    elif python --version 2>&1 | grep -q \"Python 3\"; then\n        echo \"python\"\n    elif python --version 2>&1 | grep -q \"Python 2\" ; then \n        echo \"python\"\n    else \n        echo \"Error: Python not found\";\n        usage\n    fi\n}\n\nPYTHON_COMMAND=$(get_python_version_to_use)\necho $PYTHON_COMMAND\n\nNow you can use it to run your script in the bash shell:\nPYTHON_COMMAND=$(get_python_version_to_use)\n\n$PYTHON_COMMAND my_script.py\n\nAnd it will use python3 or python2 according to what installed on your machine (Preferring python3)\n", "Q: Keyboard style different from region language I am booting ubuntu LTS in English from a USB-Stick, but the computer I am on has a German keyboard, so it is a real typing adventure. Is it possible to change the keyboard to German style and keep the system language in English?
