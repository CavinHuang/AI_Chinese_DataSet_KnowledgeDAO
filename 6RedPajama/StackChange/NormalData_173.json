But for insterting you need to be there in the source location for e.g. to insert usb-storage, after removing it, you should run insmod usb-storage atlinux/driver/usb/storage` .\n", "Q: copy table from libreoffice calc in word document When I use libreoffice calc, I copy my table from libreoffice calc in libreoffice writer.

Thank you so much\n\nA: I'm not an expert on LibreOffice, but I believe the reason copying and pasting doesn't result in a visible table is that the table shown in Calc is merely an instrument (like ruler lines) rather than part of the document itself.\nThat said if you save the Calc file as .html then open the .html file in Writer and save as a document you can get a visible table, because it forces table to be written to the document as data.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your Calc file and save as a .html file.\n\n*Open Writer and then open the .html file.\n\n*Save the file as a document (.odt, .doc, .docx, and etc).\nAdditional Resources:\nVideo of the process (MP4 1.70MB) = https://copy.com/s3JeFSJrR4pa\n", "Q: Can't update or install anything.

WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, I suggest a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz. I also suggest a fixed channel, either 1 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. After making these changes, reboot the router.\nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nRight above the line exit 0, add the line:\niw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Proofread carefully, save and close gedit. If these changes do not help, please try compiling the driver backported from kernel version 3.13. Please get a temporary wired ethernet connection and do:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential\n\nI suggest you download this to your desktop: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.13.2/backports-3.13.2-1.tar.xz Right-click it and select 'Extract Here.' Now open a terminal and do:\ncd ~/Desktop/backports-3.13.2-1/\nmake defconfig-rtlwifi\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe rtl8188ee\n\nIt may take a reboot.

I have researched this but still think I will get into some troubles.  A few weeks ago I bit the bullet and switched to Ubuntu 12.04 and I must say I don't want to go back to Windows but I have an I-phone that I need to urgently unlock so I need I-tunes.  I installed WINE but couldn't get to to work.\nI have a second hard disc drive from another PC on my computer with Windows XP on it but went about that the wrong way and due to that I of course cannot run Xp - gives a BSOD.  I have given in and bought WIN 7 and burnt the ISO file to disc.  I was going to unplug HDD1 that has UBUNTU on it and just load the CD and see if it will put WIN7 onto the HDD2 but I bet it is not that simple.  Can someone offer help.\n\nA: You can, but since Ubuntu and Windows are on separate drives with separate boot managers you won't see boot entries for both OSs in both managers. This means if you want to boot the OS on hard drive 2 you will have to enter your computers quickboot menu and tell it to boot from hard drive 2. Which for many people is the prefered way to do things. Keep in mind that some computer's quick boot menus don't allow selecting a specific hard drive to boot from, which would mean you would have to disconnect 1 drive to boot the other or fix the boot manager to list both Ubuntu and Window's bootloaders.\nThe best place to start would be to check your quick boot menu to see what the computer supports. For this test you should have both hard drives connected. This is done by pressing a specific key when the computer first turns on. The key varies by computer model, but it should say on the screen. Typical keys are F2, F4, F10, and F11. You should then get a list that says something along the lines of:\n1. CD/DVD\n2. Removable\n3. Hard Drive 1\n4. Hard Drive 2\n5. Network\n\nIf you can pick between drives then your plan will work. Simply disconnect Ubuntu and install Windows then reconnect. \nIf it doesn't list a specific hard drive then you can't choose, and it will always try to boot from the first one to offer up a boot manager, which would prevent you from booting into 1 of the operating systems unless you disconnect the other drive. In this case you \"may\" be able to proceed by installing as planned and then running a program called boot-repair from Ubuntu when both hard drives are connected. This should add an entry for Windows to the Ubuntu drive.\nAlternatively you can install VirtualBox on Ubuntu and install Windows 7 in a virtual machine. Then re-direct the usb device to the virtual machine so that Windows 7 can interact with it.\n", "Q: Can't see the Username and hostname in terminal While I'm Opening a New Terminal i Used to get like this before \nsysadmin@system99:~$\n\nBut now i get like this below\n-bash-4.2$\n\nSeems .bashrc issue, so what i copied bashrc from \ncp /etc/skel/* ~\n\nBut this too not yet fixed my issue , how can i fix it ? \nGuide me buddies..\n\nA: Open you ~/.bashrc file and search for the following text(this starts from line no 59 on my ~/.bashrc:\nif [ \"$color_prompt\" = yes ]; then\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\nelse\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\w\\$ '\nfi\n\nand then change the PS1 variable in the else part to:\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\n\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu alongside Mac OS X option only gives me a few 30 Gigs I'm trying to install Ubuntu alongside Mac and I have 1 TB of memory.

I use the same regex with grep and it gives me a match but when doing it in a bash script, it return no match.\nTest String(part of the file testregex.txt):\n<a href=\"/os_x_lynx-wallpapers.html\"><p>OS X Lynx</p><img src=\"/thumbs/os_x_lynx-t1.jpg\"alt=\"OS X Lynx\"  class=\"thumb_img\" width=\"270\" height=\"169\"/></a></div><div style=\"float:right;margin-right:13px;\"></div></div>\nThis command correctly matches the highlighted part(and a few more):\ngrep -E '<img src=\"[^\"]*\\.jpg\"' testregex.txt\n\nBut this bash script returns no match:\npage=$(<testregex.txt)\n\nif [[ $page =~ '<img src=\"[^\"]*\\.jpg\"' ]]; then\n    echo $1\n    echo \"match found\"\nelse\n    echo \"match not found!\"\nfi\n\n\nA: In the case =~ operator, just don't use quotes for the right operator. This is considered an extended regular expression so in this case the single quotes will be part from he regular expression. So, using single quotes, a string like '<img src=\"/thumbs/os_x_lynx-t1.jpg\"' (which contain also single quotes around it) will be found. See Meaning of “=~” operator in shell script.\nAlso, you must to escape any special character in your regex (quotes, spaces, shell redirection - <):\n#!/bin/bash\npage=$(<testregex.txt)\n\nif [[ $page =~ \\<img\\ src=\\\"[^\\\"]*\\.jpg\\\" ]]; then\n    echo $1\n    echo \"match found\"\nelse\n    echo \"match not found!\"\nfi\n\n\nApart of =~, you can use in your script your original command which uses grep:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif grep -qE '<img src=\"[^\"]*\\.jpg\"' testregex.txt ; then\n    echo $1\n    echo \"match found\"\nelse\n    echo \"match not found!\"\nfi\n\nIn this case I used -q option for grep to not  write  anything  to  standard   output and to exit immediately if any match is found.\n\nA: If you write [[ \"$page\" =~ '<img src=\"[^\"]*\\.jpg\"' ]], then the right-hand side will be treated as an ordinary string, not a regex. See Bash regex statement. The solution is to escape all the special characters.\notherwise you can use regex statement in a separate variable within single quotes '' like, \nvar='<img src=\"[^\"]*\\.jpg'\n\nin these case you do not need to escape special characters one by one.\n#!/bin/bash\npage=$(<testregex.txt)\nvar='<img src=\"[^\"]*\\.jpg'\n\nif [[ \"$page\" =~ $var ]]; then\n#    echo $1\n    echo \"match found\"\nelse\n    echo \"match not found!\"\nfi\n\nI have commented the echo $1 statement.

Ideal for offline installation of the\n  \"seed\" package.\n\nFirst branch the project on launchpad:\nbzr branch lp:dpkg-offline\n\ndpkg_offline tutorial\nLet's say you want to create a tarball with all the dependencies\nnecessary to install git on an Ubuntu 12.04 server system.\nOnce you have dpkg_offline, ensure you have the needed dependencies\ninstalled:\nsudo apt-get install genisoimage mtools squashfs-tools apt-utils curl\n\nOnce they're installed, get your seed .iso image::\nwget http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ubuntu-12.04.4-server-amd64.iso\n\nNow you're all set to do the installation. Run this:\n./dpkg_offline ubuntu-12.04.4-server-amd64.iso \"git\"\n\nThe first argument is the seed iso, while the second is a list of\npackages to install. Using quotes is necessary so that the second\n\"thing\" is taken as the whole list. Of course, it's not necessary if\nyou have only one seed package.\nIf the process completes successfully, a tarball will be left in the current\ndirectory. The name will encode the seed ISO, creation date, and the base\npackages that were installed:\napt-repo-ubuntu-12.04.4-server-amd64.iso-20131213-git_13a1.7.9.5-1_amd64.tar.gz\n\nIf something fails, dpkg_offline will tell you what failed and point you\nto a log file that may contain more details about the failure. This file\nwill be in a temporary directory; dpkg_offline normally cleans this\ndirectory up, but in the case of a failure it will leave it as-is for\nanalysis.\n", "Q: Cannot start mysql server I'm tring to run a website from my server, so I installed php, apache and mysql.\nI'm having problems with mysql.

My question is,What can i use in place of the Ubuntu One. \nDropbox or preferably Mega, or anything else that allows me to make a backup online?\n\nA: Deja Dup is just a front-end (and configuration helper) for Duplicity. From its --help, you can see what it supports:\n  cf+http://container_name\n  file:///some_dir\n  ftp://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/some_dir\n  ftps://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/some_dir\n  hsi://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/some_dir\n  imap://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/some_dir\n  rsync://user[:password]@other.host[:port]::/module/some_dir\n  rsync://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/relative_path\n  rsync://user[:password]@other.host[:port]//absolute_path\n  s3://other.host/bucket_name[/prefix]\n  s3+http://bucket_name[/prefix]\n  scp://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/some_dir\n  ssh://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/some_dir\n  swift://container_name\n  tahoe://alias/directory\n  webdav://user[:password]@other.host/some_dir\n  webdavs://user[:password]@other.host/some_dir\n  gdocs://user[:password]@other.host/some_dir\n  mega://user[:password]@other.host/some_dir\n  dpbx:///some_dir\n\nAnd as you can see, both Mega and Dropbox are both on the end of that list. I would expect most of those to be available through Deja Dup.\nNote: This appears to be new in Trusty. So you would either need to upgrade (pre-release at the time of writing) or manually suck the duplicity package back from packages.ubuntu.com. If you do the second, just check you can fulfill all the dependencies from your Ubuntu version before you upgrade. If you can't and you install anyway, that can cause a bit of a headache.\n\nA: Another way using the graphical interface is to install Dropbox on your system, create a folder within the Dropbox folder. After doing those steps point the backup to it using the custom location choice. After the backup is complete the Dropbox client will automatically upload the backup to the cloud.  \n", "Q: Google Chrome Installation How do I install Google Chrome on my Ubuntu 13.10 easily?

But today I woke up to find the same daemon to be stopped.\nI'll be grateful if someone could guide me to the right direction how to start debugging this problem.\n\nA: I've been digging through the Lucid Bind9 package and I think Bind9 uses /var/log/syslog as its default log. If the /etc/init.d/bind9 is crashing with an error that outputs, I'd hope it shows up there.\nIf it's crashing before it can close, your only option might be running it manually (rather than the service). You'll need to pick through the $OPTIONS that get set up in the service file and run /usr/sbin/named with them. You also need to tell resolveconf about the new nameserver. It's a bit tough to unravel but it's all in that service file.\nThe other option is you could assume it's a weird bug that's been fixed since. 12.04 is a minor version up and 14.04 (which will be released this month) is running 9.9. The other side of that argument is that they might not have fix it and it might have exotic, new bugs too...

Does anybody recognize this error and knows how to fix it?\n\nA: I ran into this problem, and the reason was that the shell path was wrong in my .tmux.conf\nset -g default-shell /usr/local/bin/fish\n\nIt couldn't find the shell, so it crashed. You should probably check whether your default shell's path is correct.\n\nA: First, I uninstalled tmux and removed its config file  .tmux.conf. The thing that worked for me was deleting tmp/tmux-1000 directory, and then installing tmux again. It seemed to me that tmux was using the default file present in tmp/tmux-1000 directory every time it was being started and very importantly this directory is not being deleted on uninstalling tmux\n\nA: Removing \nset-option -g default-command \"reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh\"\n\nfrom the configuration fixed the problem for me.\n", "Q: Installation instructions for dual boot Ubuntu and Windows I've completed a new build and I would like to make it a Windows 7 and Ubuntu dual boot system. I am brand new to Linux and, while I have done a lot of research into ways to partition my drives and so on, I am not super clear on how to do the installs properly. I want to get these installs right the first time, so I am hoping someone can give me a clear step-by-babystep to guide me through this process. Please remember I'm a newbie with Linux and with installing OS's in general :) \nI have brand new drives and am going to be doing CLEAN installs. My basic understanding is: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install windows first. Use the windows installer to set up the windows system partition on the SSD and the NTFS data partition on the HDD, leave the remaining spaces unallocated for now.\n\n*Install Ubuntu next. Use the installer (GRUB if I'm not mistaken) to set up the Ubuntu partitions on SSD and HDD, choosing where to mount each partition (/, /home, etc).\n\n*???\n\n*The OS's are now installed... Set up symlinks, mounts, and so on\n\n\nIf it's any more complicated than I described in 1) and 2) (which I'm 100% sure it is), then I could really use some guidance on the finer details: what to do and when to do it, things to make sure of, boxes to check, etc, etc.\nMy motherboard is an ASUS Z87 Pro, which I believe is UEFI. I've read that UEFI may require special care in installing Windows and Linux for dual boot (have to use gpt partitions, etc). What are the steps and things to check in each installation process for this situation?\nI intend to have both OS's on an SSD (120GB Samsung 840 EVO), with data and a couple other partitions on an HDD (1TB Caviar Blue) My intended partition scheme (assuming gpt partitions, which may be a bad assumption?):\n\nSSD - 120GB (Samsung 840 EVO):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*[C:] 80GB (NTFS) -> Windows system partition \n  \n*[sda1] 20GB (ext4) -> /\n  \n*[sda2] 15GB (ext4) -> /home ... (moving folders for docs, media files, to HDD)\n  \n  \n  HDD - 1TB (Western Digital Caviar Blue)\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*[D:] ~800GB (NTFS) -> NTFS Data partition (Windows and OS-shared data)\n  \n*[sdb2] ~100GB (ext4) -> Ubuntu-only data partition \n  \n*[sdb3] 2GB (ext4) -> /var\n  \n*[sdb4] 4GB (ext4) -> /tmp\n  \n*[sdb5] 8GB (ext4) -> /swap (= my 8GB RAM for hibernation)\n  \n  \n  (if you have comments on my scheme, I'd appreciate hearing them, but that's not the point of this question)\n\nA clear walkthrough of the installation processes for my case would be EXTREMELY appreciated. Thank you!\n\nA: Your general understanding looks good. What you are doing doesn't seem that crazy, there should be resources out there for how to dual boot Ubuntu and Windows using UEFI. Windows 7 should also be easier to deal with than Windows 8 for UEFI reasons.\nThat being said, from my experience with UEFI, I can understand your reasons for asking. If you don't want the hassle, and your BIOS supports legacy booting (not UEFI), feel free to go that route. I know my motherboard's BIOS supports both UEFI and regular MBR disks, and it's less fancy than yours.\nUbuntu has a guide for UEFI, which looks like it covers things pretty well. It discusses some common errors you may run into. I would suggest following the instructions at the beginning. Here are some specifics I would add for you:\nFirst make sure your BIOS is set for EFI or Legacy mode (depending on which way you want to go). Then install Windows (have fun with that), it should install in the mode you set in the BIOS. You might not want to activate it until you get everything working right in case you need to start over.\nOnce Windows is working, boot the Ubuntu installer. Once you get to this far, if you are using EFI, it mentions:\n\nnothing special is required if you use the automatic installer of Ubuntu\n\nSo that's good news. Just use the installer to set up your partition scheme. Windows should have created the EFI System Partition already.\n\nMount point: /boot/efi (remark: no need to set this mount point when using the manual partitioning, the Ubuntu installer will detect it automatically)\n\nThere are too many variables to come up with an exact checklist of every step to take. See if the above can get you started and let us know if you run into problems.\n", "Q: Scheduling torrents in Transmission - using WD My Cloud is there a way that I can Schedule downloads in the Transmission app to take place only during certain hours of the day.\nFor example: from 19:00 - 08:00\nThat way when I use my internet the most it isn't being used up by downloads. \n\nA: It is called \"turtle mode\"\nTransmission v1.72+ lets you limit DL/UL speeds by time of day and has a speed limit mode you can click.\n\nFrom the manual\n\nTemporary Speed Limits\nTemporary speed limits -- often called \"turtle mode\" -- are a second\nset of upload and download limits that can be set to run on a schedule\nand can also be toggled manually. Scheduled use is helpful if your ISP\nhas different bandwidth caps on evenings or weekends. Manual use is\nhelpful as a single-click way to quickly give other applications more\nbandwidth.

I'm trying to install Err on Ubuntu Server 12.04.4. It requires python plus a bunch of dependencies.\nWhen I followed the install instructions, I couldn't get it to work using the \"default\" which appeared to be Python 2.7. There seems to be a circular dependency in sleekxmpp (one of the requirements):\nImportError: cannot import name resolver\n\nSo my idea is to use Python 3 instead. My system has all of this installed:\npython                                          install\npython-apt-common                               install\npython-dbus-dev                                 install\npython-minimal                                  install\npython-pip                                      install\npython-pkg-resources                            install\npython-setuptools                               install\npython2.7                                       install\npython2.7-minimal                               install\npython3                                         install\npython3-minimal                                 install\npython3.2                                       install\npython3.2-minimal                               install\n\nWhen I use pip to install stuff, I have no idea if it's using python 2, or 3, or really, what anything is using (I can't see how to control which version of packages to install, what version of python these packages are based on with pip freeze).\nI just want to have an environment that uses the latest version of Python 3 without all this other stuff confusing me. So I tried installing virtualenv and setting up the environment, but it appears to just be another python2.7 environment. In short I have no idea what's going on, and need some pointers.\n\nA: Err pulls in a lot of dependencies along with it, so I would suggest to use Virtualenv in order to install it. And since they mention that as of Err v2.0, they have written it with Python 3 in mind, you should use Python 3 if you can (although Err is compatible with Python 2.7 too).\nTo understand how to use virtualenv, have a look at its documentation and create a couple of them to play and understand the concept. Basically virtualenv is to keep the dependencies separate for each project and not to mix up with the ones already installed on the system by default.\nVirtualenv comes by default in the standard library from Python 3.3 onwards. But since you have Python 3.2, we would need to install it first.\nsudo apt-get install python3-pip\nsudo pip3 install virtualenv\n\nNow, create the virtualenv for installing Err and activate it following the documentation above. I don't have Python 3.2 so cannot test it right now, but the following should work (assuming you want to create it at ~/venv/py3-err/):\npython3 virtualenv.py ~/venv/py3-err/\n. ~/venv/py3-err/bin/activate\n\nOnce activated install Err using pip. Since, you are facing issues with sleekxmpp, a bug was reported in this regard and it has been fixed in their Github master branch. So, install it directly from there:\npip install https://github.com/gbin/err/archive/master.zip\n\nIf you get any build-errors in this step, download the basic build-packages and re-run the above command:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libffi-dev\n\nOnce installed, you need to save the config-template.py as config.py in a separate data directory. cd to this directory and start it by just running err.py or err.py --daemon following the user guide.\n", "Q: How to shut down Ubuntu after 2 hours of being idle?

You can set an IdleAction in your systemd/logind.conf file.\nEdit the file using:\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf\n\nand add:\nIdleAction=poweroff\nIdleActionSec=120min\n\nI have tested it with IdleActionSec=1min and the machine shuts down as expected.\n\nA: After having looked at a number of options for shutting down after a certain time of inactivity, it seems that xautolock is the easiest way. All credits to Sparhawk for mentioning about xautolock.\nThanks to Sneetsher for pointing out to xscreensaver. Using xscreensaver, I could manually specify what to do after a certain amount of time of inactivity. To use xscreensaver, you need to install it using:\nsudo apt-get install xscreensaver\n\nor install it from the software center and then run it once using:\nxscreensaver-demo\n\nor type \"xscreensaver\" on the dash and open \"Screensaver\".\nThis will create a ~/.xscreensaver file.

Otherwise, a graphical application would have been available for this.\n\n*This could be achieved using xautolock, however, as redanimalwar pointed, out a timout greater than 1 hour is not possible without modifying its source code and recompiling.\n\nA: This is my simplified script, this requires that you install the \"xprintidle\" package and modify the shutdown command so that is possible to run without sudo/password.\nsudo chmod u+s /sbin/shutdown\nsudo apt-get install xprintidle\n\nScript\n#!/bin/bash\nidletime=$((15*60*1000)) # 15 min in milliseconds\nidle=0\n\nwhile [ $idle -lt $idletime ];do\n    idle=`xprintidle`\n    sleep 1\ndone\nshutdown -P now\n\n\nA: This is probably the best solution.

Probably not finished this because my linux/bash knowlege was not good at the time. I also did put the script I had in rc.local or something like that triggered the shutdown on boot. Thanks to @Jobin for the reminder how to add startup apps in XFCE, I already knew this but ... and credits for the dbus thing, never saw that, better then shutdown since it not requires root.\n\nA: Modified @redanimalwar script to warn user and give a chance to cancel the shutdown.

In the past, I have used the \"encrypt home folder\" option to add (some) security to my installation (ie. now no one can easily steal my home folder's contents by booting a live CD or using Windows to access my Ubuntu root partition). \nThis is why I was excited to learn about the new Full disk encryption option in 13.10. I was able to successfully burn and boot the DVD. However, disk encryption and home folder encryption are not available options under \"install along side them [the other operating system(s)]\". Since I do not want to lose the Windows installation, I obviously do not want to select \"erase disk\".\nBasically, here is what I would like to happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on > BIOS > GRUB > user choice (Windows or Ubuntu) \n\n*User Choice    (Windows) > Non-encrypted,  normal Windows (no\nencryption pass-phrase    required)  \n\n*User Choice (Ubuntu) > Encrypted Ubuntu 13.10 installation    (with\npass-phrase required)\n\nA: You can't, full disk encryption as it names implies encrypts the full disk not just a partition. Worse, to keep attackers unable to tell used parts from unused parts of the disk it will overwrite all the disk with random values, that means that you can't use it without wiping all the disk, including Windows partitions.\nSorry, but if you want to dualboot you are restricted to partition level encryption. Check this answer for a walkthrough (note the comments there as well).\n\nA: What you can do if your laptop came with Windows installed and you want it \"untouched\" you can use the Windows Disk Manager to shrink the Windows volume to create unformatted disk space that you can use for Ubuntu partitions.\nThen using the Ubuntu installer you can accomplish a LUKS encrypted Ubuntu partition that protect both Ubuntu and your home directory.\nThe below mentioned description is the only one I have found that describes this for Windows Ubuntu dual boot where both operating systems can exist as individually encrypted on separate partitions (Bitlocker/LUKS) on the same drive:\nhttps://www.hecticgeek.com/2012/10/how-to-setup-encrypted-ubuntu-installation\nPay attention to the key detail mentioned; selecting the\n\"physical volume for encryption\" option to mark for later encryption.\nVery few guides describe this.\nOne lesson learned it to not make the boot partition too small.  Adding some megabytes margin is well spent to have space for a few kernel updates without running out of disk space.\n", "Q: How to activate Radeon Dynamic Power Management? I've just installed Ubuntu 14.04, I'm not sure if  Radeon Dynamic Power Management is working because the laptop is hotter than my previous Ubuntu 12.04.4 with kernel 3.11 plus adding the kernel parameter \"radeon.dpm=1\" added in line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\".\nPlease, could someone confirm that DPM is active out of the box in kernel 3.13?\n\nA: Personally I dislike adding options to modules via the GRUB command line. Instead, to enable DPM with my Radeon card I created a file /etc/modprobe.d/radeon.conf with the following contents:\noptions radeon dpm=1\n\nAfter creating this file it is necessary to rebuild the initramfs in order to apply the changes:\n$ sudo update-initramfs -u\n\nAfter the next reboot, the dmesg contents show that the option has taken effect:\n$ dmesg | grep radeon\n... various other output ...\n[    2.439073] [drm] radeon: dpm initialized\n\n\nA: It is enabled by default on kernel 3.13 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

After some testing I found out, that 6000K is quite good, but setting it everytime with redshift is hacky.\nSo the solution would be editing the ICC profile itself. For this I have tried to use colormgr without success. Does anybody know a solution?\n\nA: Jolly good question. I have only managed to find LProf, which claims to be the only open source ICC profile editor.\n\nLProf is an open source color profiler that creates ICC compliant profiles for devices such as cameras, scanners and monitors. Origanally authored by Marti Maria the creator of LCMS. Marti has graciously consented to the creation of this project.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no repository or .deb file so far so you would need to compile it. The dependencies stated in the readme file seem reasonable, although it does require LCMS itself with which I am not familiar at all, and this is where I left it.\nI overcame my problem by browsing similar ICC profiles for my device in sites such as ICC Profiles and Monitor Settings Database and I ended up keeping the one that suits me best.\n", "Q: Driver for Validity Sensors Fingerprint scanner prakhar@pr3d4tOr:~$ lsusb -s 001:003 -v\n\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 138a:0018 Validity Sensors, Inc.

You might need to set up a build environment first. Make sure that you have packages $sudo apt-get install autoreconf libusb libusb-dev libnss3 libgdk-pixbuf2 git libtool:\nScript for auto build and install (written by me and shared from my Dropbox). cd to wherever you downloaded the script to and and run it with superuser:\n$ chmod +x install.sh\n$ sudo ./install.sh\n\nAnd voila. Go to user accounts, and you'll see a fingerprint login option.\nIf you're using ecryptfs (What is this?) for /home, you will encounter this issue at login. Fix.\nEDIT (08/10/2014): You can also build your own driver by compiling libfprint patched with 138a:0018 and 138a:0017 drivers (see 03/01/2014). Their licenses apply, obviously.\nI don't know for sure, but you can probably build this on a 32-bit system as well.\nEDIT (02/10/2014): After switching to Arch Linux, I recently found out that this driver (libfprint-vfs5011-git) is present in AUR. You can download the updated version from AUR for this package (I'll update this answer soon to include instructions as well). EDIT: Added instructions, see 03/01/2014.\nEDIT (13/09/2014): After recent updates to fprint, the fingerprint recognition is pretty awesome :P\nPre-built. (See the 03/01/2014 edit for the latest git version):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and add the PPA for fprintd.\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fingerprint/fprint\n\n*Update your installation.\n$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n*Get the required packages.\n$ sudo apt-get install fprintd libpam-fprintd\n\n*Download the driver for the fingerprint scanner (shared via my Dropbox). Add a comment if the download is not working. See the latest edit (02/10/2014) for a repository version.\n\n*cd to wherever you downloaded the driver to.\n\n*Install the driver.\n$ sudo dpkg -i fprint-vfs5011_0-1_amd64.deb\n", "Q: what are duty of locale and locale-gen commands? I know in order to understand how commands work, we should use man page. But for command locale and locale-gen. I did not  got the exact meaning and their duty. I need some more description about their jobs and the relation between locale and locale-gen. Based on man locale:\n\nlocale - Get locale-specific information.\n\nok what is locale??\n\nDESCRIPTION\n         The locale program writes information about the current locale environ���\n         ment, or all locales, to standard output.\n\nwhat is locale environment?\n\nA: From Wikipedia : \n\nIn computing, a locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, country and any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user interface. Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language identifier and a region identifier.\n\nThe locale programs will output a set of shell variables and their values. These are the variables that alter the behaviour of some commands regarding the language, character sets usage and so on.\nFrom my system :\nbenoit@thorgal:~s locale\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\nbenoit@thorgal:~$\n\nThis tells those commands, which listen, to use American English and UTF8 encoding for the special characters.\nIf I change the value of LANG and put fr_FR.UTF-8 instead, then commands, that support it, will write their output in French instead of English. Of course, only, if the French translation is installed.\nFor the locale-gen command, I think that the first paragraph of its man page is self-explaining :\n\nCompiled  locale  files  take  about 50MB of disk space, and most users\n         only need few locales.  In order to save disk  space,  compiled  locale\n         files  are not distributed in the locales package, but selected locales\n         are automatically generated when this package is installed  by  running\n         the locale-gen program.\n\nWhen you run locale-gen or locale-gen <locale code> you compile the needed locale file(s), allowing commands to use the locale specified within the environments variables displayed by locale.\nExample: locale-gen en_US.UTF8\nYou can get the available locale codes by using the command locale -a.\n", "Q: debian package creation without a configure script I've been trying to package an in house code project but have been having trouble. I can create a package, but the actual binaries are not installed when I run \nsudo dpkg -i proj_1.0.0+svn02042014-1_amd64.deb\n\nI expect this is because there is no 'configure' script in the project, and no reference to $DESTDIR. Instead, when running make install, it just calls a perl script that deploys the files to a dir specified on the terminal.\nTo create the debian package i have been doing the following:\ntar -pczf proj-1.0.0+svn02042014.tar.gz proj-1.0.0+svn02042014/\ndh_make -e blah@blah.com -f ../proj-1.0.0+svn02042014.tar.gz\ndpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot\n\nWhen running dpkg --contents proj_1.0.0+svn02042014-1_amd64.deb i can clearly see that the binaries are not in the package. The only things that are in there are some doc files (i.e. doc\\README)\nI'm guessing that using dpkg-buildpackage without a configure script is not possible? Is this the case? \nThanks for attention\nEdit:\nproj-1.0.0+svn02042014.tar.gz looks something like:  \nproj-1.0.0+svn02042014/  \n--Makefile  \n--src/  \n----install.pl  \n----Makefile  \n----blah.cpp\n\n\nA: Edit your debian/rules to include an override of dh_auto_build and dh_auto_install:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n\n%:\n    dh \"$@\"\n\noverride_dh_auto_build:\n    cd $(CURDIR) && make\n\noverride_dh_auto_install:\n    cd $(CURDIR) && make install\n    cd $(CURDIR) && cp ./proj_bin debian/proj/usr/bin\n    dh_install\n\nIt may requires some modifications but the basic idea is to call your Makefile from the debian/rules and install the binary in /usr/bin.\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*spaces before the cd and dh commands are tabs, don't replace them.\n\n*replace proj_bin by your binary name (I assumed only one)\n\n", "Q: Unity tweak tool: how to disable window switching shortcuts?

Go to the \"Publish\" section in QtCreator, then under the \"Security Policy Groups\" list click the \"+\" button and add \"audio\".  Then try installing the package on the device again and see if it works.\nThe reason I suspect this is because when simply running the code on the device, QtCreator copies the files into a temporary location and launches them from the commandline, so they run unconfined.  But when installing it from the click package, it will be confined to the security policy defined in that package.\nSee http://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/apps/security-policy-for-click-packages/ for more info on confinement and security policies.\n", "Q: Compiling and running Java code - NoClassDefFoundError I tried to compile some code written in Java and I used the command:\njavac Code.java\njava Code.java\n\nand I got following errors:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Code/java\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Code.java\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:217)\n    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:205)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:323)\n    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:294)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:268)\nCould not find the main class: Code.java.

I just recently built my own computer, and I am now trying to run Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on it from a flash drive with \"casper-rw persistence\". I'm very new to the Ubuntu operating system, so I was exploring the settings when I noticed something after using mesa-utils to get my graphics driver recognized. \nUbuntu thought I was using something called \"Gallium 0.4 on AMD CAPE VERDE\", which is inaccurate as I'm using a Gigabyte Radeon HD 7770 GHz Edition 1GB video card. So, I went to the Additional Drivers section to download a proper update (as I saw that updating driver's manually wasn't recommended by most on this site)... and found 3. \n\"Video driver for the AMD graphics accelerators\" was listed three times on the list, and with the exact same description on each. I don't know which one to pick, and I would just pick randomly but the last time I did that on this computer it... started having a LOT of problems, including not showing any graphics, not allowing me to click \"Try Ubuntu\" when I start the computer, and even not loading at all as things got worse. \nIs there a way to tell the difference between these three updates? Should I install something manually? And from where?\n\nA: I do not think you can get the proprietary driver working without doing a standard install. Persistence will save data and changes, and you can install some packages, but it uses a cow (copy on write) so it does not replace a standard installation. This is an example of where persistence will not work.\nOnce you do an install, each driver should have a version or number associated with it. Choose the highest number.\nAfter installing the driver you typically need to then reboot for the changes to take effect, and this is where persistence fails.\n\nA: I accept with bodhi.razen's point. Yet I will tell you how to install the driver so that you can try it anyways.\nYou can install proprietary graphic card driver from this website . Select the appropriate options in that site and you will see the driver for your graphic card. Make sure you install the most recent one. Also check the release notes and installer notes of the graphic card driver before installing. Make sure your OS meets all the system requirements specified in the release notes. Follow the steps in the installer notes to successfully install your driver. You may also have to completely update your OS before graphic driver installation. If you run into problems(Unity crash,low graphics mode and other such issues) after installing your driver, probably, the driver is not acceptable with your OS. In that case try starting a tty session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1. Type your user name and password. Then type:\nsudo aticonfig --uninstall\n\nThis will uninstall the driver you installed. Now reboot your system with:\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nNow you will get back unity and you can get a driver that supports your OS.\nPS:-\nYou may use the following commands to check if your OS meets the system requirements of the driver:-\n\n\n*\n\n*uname -a   to know your Kernel version\n\n*ldd --version    to know your eglibc version\n\n*Xorg -version    to know Xorg version\n\n", "Q: How can I see a folder and a subfolder in the same window? How can I navigate folders and subfolders at the same time?\nLike \"column view\" in Mac OS X.\n\nEdit 2: I use Ubuntu 14.04 and I couldn't install Marlin, so I installed \"Pantheon File Manager\" instead. \n\nA: You can use Marlin, which is much less buggy than it was before, or Pantheon Files, which is forked from Marlin for the elementaryOS.\nInstallation instructions may be found on the following Q&A:\nHow can I colour code my files like on a Mac?\n\nA: Your best choice is ranger, which is terminal based.\n\nA: Nautilus, the file browser in Ubuntu supports mutliple tabs. You can have multiple locations open in the same window, but in different tabs.\n\n\n*\n\n*To open a new tab in Nautilus, press Ctrl+t.\n\n*To open a folder in a new tab, focus on the folder and type Ctrl+Shift+Enter.\n\n*To close a tab, press Ctrl+w\n\nA: Yes I got it..

Nautilus used to but this was stripped back. There has been a bit of a struggle to get it back but I'm not sure how viable that is now.\nI use Dolphin these days (I'm also a KDE user so that makes sense for me) which might be an option if you're doing this a lot. List view plus split screen FTW:\n\n", "Q: Why my touchpad not working? My laptop is an ASUS K53SC. It has an ELANTECH touchpad.

I went to System Settings -> Input Devices -> Touchpad -> enable/disable touchpad -> Keyboard shortcuts.\nThere was no keyboard shortcut onfigured for enabling and disabling touchpad, so I set up one then I just used it and the touchpad somehow started working again.\nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Prevent wifi from disabling at suspend?

It's a new asrock board with AMD A4-5300 APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics × 2.\nEvery time I install the graphics driver Ubuntu brakes (black screen with a momentary \"Signal out of range\" message or black and white strips) and I find myself in recovery mode and very quickly learning how to use the console.  I've removed fglrx twice and got it running again but other times I just reloaded and started from scratch... \nI've read just about every post here on installing this driver and tried some and came to the conclusion that there is no driver for this thing, stuck with 1024 x 768. I cant continue playing with the setup, I've got to reload programs and do some work.  \nSo, then I thought maybe it's a 64 bit driver and I'm trying to install it in a 32 bit version of Ubuntu... any thoughts on that?  I have noticed quite a few with the same or similar problems and not to many [SOLVED]...\nBut now my question, If I try and install the driver whilst running from a usb stick using the 64 bit version in trial mode, will there be any chance of 1, breaking the HD installation and 2, any chance of it working... Or alternatively, can I throw a video card in and ignore the on-board goodies? I'm not a gamer...  Your thoughts?\n\nA: \"signal out of range\" means that the driver you're trying to use (fglrx) is trying to display a resolution not supported by your monitor. If you read the documentation on fglrx I'm sure there is a command line method of changing the driver's default resolution.\nIf you are not running games or high graphics-intensive programs, can you not just use the default linux Nouveau driver instead of installing proprietary video card drivers? If it is a new card then it may not have linux support for the proprietary driver yet.\nAlso yes if you're trying to install software on a 32bit operating system or machine, it will not work. If your machine is 64bit why can you not just boot from 64bit live-CD, and reinstall, replacing the 32bit version of Ubuntu?\nIf you boot from 64bit live-CD and use that to try to install software on a 32bit already installed system, and it actually allows you to do so in the first place, when you reboot to HD it will break almost guaranteed. Which again begs the question, why can you not just use a 64bit system on your machine?\n", "Q: Keyboard layout changed (13.10/ Asus Q301L) I have Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit installed on my Asus VivoBook Q301L. I plugged in a USB keyboard, and now my layout seems to have changed, and I can't change it back. \nI noticed that my USB keyboard has Ctrl, Super, Alt-keys starting from the left edge to the space bar. \nMy laptop has Ctrl, Fn, Super, Alt. The issue is that some of my keys are typing wrong characters: \n0 key types /\nP key types * \n; key types - \n/ key types + \nIf I want the actual characters, I have to hold the Fn-key on my laptop (e.g. \"laptop would be \"la*to*\" if I didn't hold the Fn key). I have run dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration and selected Asus laptop for my keyboard. \nStill no luck.\n\nA: Is very likely that you need to turn off Num Lock on the external keyboard.\nI had this very problem. When I plugged the external keyboard in, the num lock was on, and cused those keys to believe they were part of a number pad (which this particular model doesn't have). Even after I unplugged the keyboard, the setting of the numlock stayed, causing those keys to continue to output the wrong characters. It wasn't until I plugged the keyboard back in and turned off the numlock that keys reverted to their normal state.\n\nA: After searching for quite some time, I have found a solution to this problem. \nOpen up notepad and copy/paste: \nset WshShell = CreateObject(\"wScript.Shell\")\nWshShell.SendKeys \"{NUMLOCK}\"\n\nAnd save as whateveryouwanttocallit.vbs\nIf you double click this then it will turn the num lock on and off. \nCheers,\nAce\nIF you get stuck here is the video that help me find the solution (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8J7TJBSBPo)\n", "Q: TL-WN821N Wifi not working correctly I have a TL-WN821N wifi USB device which worked fine (gave me a connection) when I was installing Ubuntu on my PC.

The Software Centre on Ubuntu 13.10, 14.04 and 15.04 is showing up a colour scheme that renders the text hardly readable:\n\nApparently, it is mixing colours from the desktop theme with its own theme and the end result is somewhat of a blur. Is there any way to fix it?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open up a terminal and type the following command:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/css/softwarecenter.css\n\n\n*The first two lines should look like this:\n@define-color light-aubergine #DED7DB;\n@define-color super-light-aubergine #F4F1F3;\n\nCopy and paste those two lines right below then comment out the originals, by enclosing them between /* and */.

So, I really like to try out Ubuntu, because I would like to use something new on my computer. Now, I have got a UEFI based motherboard with secure boot enabled. (An Asus B85M-G) But my question is, should I attemp to install Ubuntu now ? Or should I wait for the 14.04 ? \nThanks already for answsering\nPS: Does my motherboard support Ubuntu properly ?\n\nA: You should be fine with UEFI.  Instead of worrying about whether or not to install 14.04, you could just install the final beta version found here: http://mirror.cse.ucdavis.edu/releases.ubuntu.com//trusty/\nThen just update as updates become available.  Usually the final beta version is pretty stable.  Or you could just install 13.10 and update when 14.04 drops.  I think you are safe either way.\n\nA: IMHO, the difference between a long-term support (LTS) release, which is what 14.04 is, and a non-LTS release, is more important than the possibility of improved EFI support in 14.04. This is very graphically illustrated here:\n\nAs you can see, 13.10 will become unsupported this year (in July, to be precise), so you'll have to upgrade before then or be cut off from updates (including security fixes). Note that there's no overlap between end-of-life (EOL) for 13.10 and the release of 14.10, so you'll have to either upgrade to the 14.04LTS or go without updates for about three months.\nIt used to be that non-LTS releases got about a year and a half of support, but that was cut in half with 13.04.\n\nA: I would install 13.10, then update to 14.04 when it's available. I don't know of any disadvantages of running the update. For me I wouldn't want to wait around two weeks. \n", "Q: How can I group the files in a directory based on their file size I have a directory where I am writing lots of files but I know each of them fall under one of the 3 pre-determined memory sizes based on what I write. Any file I write may be either 300KB or 129.1MB or 251MB. Now if there is any packet error in the incoming data, the files that I write will not fall under one of these buckets. Since there will be so many files  generated I will not be able to check the individual file size manually. Hence I need a way by which I can group all files by its size so that most of the files will fall under the three category mentioned above and I can easily find the files that are bad.\nIn short I want something like this: select file_names from folder and group by file_size. Is it possible?\nEdit: It would be even better if anyone can give me a solution by which I can: select file_names from folder whose filesize not in [300KB,129.1MB,251MB]. Any ideas?\n\nA: To sort files by size you can use ls command with -S option:\nls -lhS\n\nFor reverse order, use -r option:\nls -lhSr\n\nI used also -l option to use a long listing format, and -h option to print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 300KB or 129.1MB or 251MB)\nSee man ls for more info.\n", "Q: Google earth installation problem I have tried to install google earth as indicated here http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Saucy_Maps_and_GPS but now I have this problem: \nsudo dpkg -i googleearth_6.0.3.2197+1.0-1_amd64.deb\nSelecting previously unselected package googleearth.\n(Reading database ... 275020 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking googleearth (from googleearth_6.0.3.2197+1.0-1_amd64.deb) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of googleearth:\n googleearth depends on ia32-libs-multiarch; however:\n  Package ia32-libs-multiarch is not installed.\n\ndpkg: error processing googleearth (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for mime-support ...\nProcessing triggers for shared-mime-info ...\nUnknown media type in type 'all/all'\nUnknown media type in type 'all/allfiles'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/mms'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/mmst'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/mmsu'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/pnm'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/rtspt'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/rtspu'\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils ...\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus ...\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n googleearth\n\nwhat shoul I do next? \n\nA: I installed on 13.04 using these instructions with no problems: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GoogleEarth\n", "Q: HTTPConnectionPool(host='openstack', port=35357): I am getting error when I am trying to access Savanna Dashboard\nHere is the error from log...\n24690 WARNING keystoneclient.middleware.auth_token [-] \nRetrying on HTTP connection exception: \nHTTPConnectionPool(host='openstack', port=35357): \nMax retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by <class 'socket.gaierror'>:\n[Errno -2] Name or service not known)\n\nI have OpenStack configured at 127.0.0.1:5000 but \nWhere/In which file do I change that opsnstack and 35357?\n\nA: Hmm, for some reason Horizon tries to reach 'openstack' instead of 127.0.0.1.

And /etc/ being the target destination of the ~/myfile.txt.\nYou will most likely be prompted for a password, but you can easily setup SSH to be passwordless.\nFor more information around scp you can execute man scp in a terminal.\n", "Q: How can I convert audio from ogg to mp3?

I have installed ubuntu, and somehow my grub is not detected because my 1st disk has a bad sector, I have tried using this command:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb1 --recheck --force-lba\nand it didn't work. It prompted a message like: \n/dev/loop0 does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.\nHow to install grub on current running partition?\n\nA: Try boot-repair by booting into ubuntu from live USB.\nInstall boot repair --> For this, open a terminal and do the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\nRun boot-repair -->\nsudo boot-repair\n\nClick on \"Recommended repair\". Write on a paper the new URL that will appear.\nReboot your PC\n\nA: Normally you install grub to the whole drive ( /dev/sdb ), not a partition on it, but in your case, you seem to be using WUBI, so you can't use grub-install.  My recommendation would be to stop using WUBI and do a real install of Ubuntu, since wubi is no longer supported.\n", "Q: Mavericks Screen Sharing resolution - Remmina VNC client I am remoting into my MacBook Pro from an Ubuntu VNC client (Remmina). The screens I have for my ubuntu machine are much lower resolution then my retina display so the VNC session window is enormous. \nIs there any way I can reduce the resolution for remote screen management or perhaps use a client that allows the remote session window in Ubuntu to be scaled so I can view the entire retina desktop on a single screen?\n\nA: Vinagre (available in the Ubuntu repositories, goes with the builtin VNC server Vino) supports scaling the screen down. However, even when scaled, VNC works at the host's real resolution; so you're still sending quite a lot of data over the network in this case.\n", "Q: VLC downmix surround to stereo?

I own a MacbookPro 8,2. Currently running Ubuntu exclusively.\n\n\n*\n\n*I attempted to re-partition my hard drive so that I could use Mac OSX as little as possible and get introduced to Linux OS's via Ubuntu. I downloaded and installed rEFIt, burned an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS image to a dvd, and installed Ubuntu on the partition that I installed. However, I think I messed up the boot records or something, because it did not boot into rEFIt, and I could not get the Ubuntu grubs to give me the option to boot to Mac OSX. Therefore I just said screw it and re-partitioned my hard drive to it's current state, which i will show below:\n\n\n| BIOS 1MB | Ext 4 (Ubuntu Partition), 455 GB | Swap, 5 MB | NTFS, 295 GB |\n| /dev/sda1|       /dev/sda2                  | /dev/sda3  |  /dev/sda4   |\nI really want to install Windows to /dev/sda4, the NTFS formatted partition. I torrented a .iso for Windows 7, but no matter what I cannot get my computer to boot to the dvd that I burned of this image. I have tried mashing c, F2, F1, esc, and F12 while booting the machine. When I manage to get to any type of boot options screen, it's the ubuntu GRUBS where it does not give me the option to boot to the disk.\nA few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What pieces of information do I need to supply myself and the viewers of this page with such that I might correct the problem?\n\n*Do I need to convert the Windows 7 .iso to a .img (or .dmg) before I can boot to it in the macbook DVD drive? I didn't need to for the Ubuntu install.\n\n*Would it be possible to re-install Mac OS X Mavericks and try from the beginning again? I have a LaCie hard drive that I had synced with Time Machine. Is there anyway I can use this to simply revert back to how my hard drive was before I messed with anything? (Yes, I know I should have backed up all of my information more properly before re-partitioning or messing around with a new OS.....)\n\n\nThanks, and let me know if I can do anything to make the solution more apparent.\n-t\n\nA: Have you configured the BIOS properly yet?  It loads before GRUB, and has its own set of settings - normally you can get it by mashing F12 instantly after hitting the power button.  GRUB will only boot from your HDD, and if the BIOS is not configured so that it will check the DVD drive first, you will only ever see GRUB.  Still, the BIOS settings won't let you directly boot from the DVD, it'll set it so it'll check the DVD drive for a bootable image before it checks the HDD and goes to GRUB.\nAfter everything works, you boot from disk, install Windows, and you're done, Windows will kindly overwrite the master boot record so that it only points to itself, making it impossible to boot to Ubuntu.  Typically you should always install Windows first, because it's greedy, but eh, it's still fixable.  \nBurn this to an .iso and load and run it after Windows is installed.  It'll restore the boot log and you'll see GRUB again and everything should be happy.\n", "Q: Uninstalled Pyton 2.7, now I cant log in I uninstalled python using following command:  \nsudo apt-get remove python2.7\n\nIt ended up removing lot of related system files as well.

I can connect to computer, without any \"Trust this computer\" loops like many people, because I installed the newest libimobiledevice.  I am now trying to sync my music using Rhythmbox. \nRhythm will let me drag/drop music onto the iPhone, and even says that the music I've added is on the phone.  But when I eject the iPhone the music I thought I added isn't there.  If I leave the phone connected to my computer but close and reopen Rhythmbox, it shows that the music I hoped to sync is not present.\nI installed Rhythmbox 3.0.1 according to these instructions, but the issue did not go away.\nHas anyone had success with this issue, or an Idean about where I should be looking for  guidance (i.e. where the Rhythmbox logs might be, to see if there is some silent error)?\n\nA: According to the libimobiledevice website Music Synchronization does not work with DBVersion > 4. This is the case for iPhone 4 and newer:\n\nThe iPhone 4/4S, iPod Touch 4, iPad 1/2/3rd Gen and Apple TV do NOT work.\n  Any device with DBVersion > 4 does NOT work. To check your DBVersion run \"ideviceinfo -q com.apple.mobile.iTunes -k DBVersion\". WIP.\n\n\nIn order to get your music on your iPhone, you can either try to run iTunes with wine or you use a third-party player on your iPhone.\nSeeing the state of the wine compatiblility page for iTunes you may need some luck.\nWhen I was confronted with the same problem I went with the alternate player option. (I'm using AcePlayer, which even plays ogg-vorbis, although playlist handling could be better). Use ideviceinstaller -l to find the APPID of the player. Then just mount it with ifuse /mount/point --appid APPID and copy the files you want.

So there is not a binary on the system. It handles how commands will be completed when pressing tab.\nExample: if you type:\nuser@host:~$ pidof <tab><tab>\n\n...a list is appearing with all possible values for this command. In this case it means all running processes. See the output of the complete function:\nuser@host:~$ complete | grep pidof\ncomplete -F _pgrep pidof\n\nThis means that the function _pgrep (-F) is executed when tabbing the command pidof. The definition of this function is in /etc/bash_completion.d/procps.\nAnother example: if you type:\nuser@host:~$ cd /usr/<tab><tab>\nbin/     games/   include/ lib/     lib32/   local/   sbin/    share/   src/\n\n...you see the list of folders you can cd to under /usr/. Which function is executed? greping the complete function (as above) tells us it's the funtction _cd in /etc/bash_completion.\nDo it yourself: You have a program/script called /bin/myprog and you want that if you execute it as follows\nuser@host:~$ myprog /home/user/<tab><tab>\n\n...it should only list folders, not files. So extend your bash completion with the following command:\nuser@host:~$ complete -F _cd myprog\n\nThat's it. You can also write own functions to complete custom things, for example complete only specific files or numbers or lists of static values...\n\nA: complete is a bash command used to perform the auto-complete action when the user hit the TAB key in a terminal. \nCalling just complete will list all the functions registered for auto-completion of commands or services options.\nFrom the bash man pages:\ncomplete: complete [-abcdefgjksuv] [-pr] [-DE] [-o option] [-A action] [-G globpat]\n          [-W wordlist]  [-F function] [-C command] [-X filterpat] [-P prefix]\n          [-S suffix] [name ...]\n    Specify how arguments are to be completed by Readline.\n\n    For each NAME, specify how arguments are to be completed.

If the command word is the empty string (com-\n       pletion  attempted  at the beginning of an empty line), any compspec defined with the\n       -E option to complete is used.  If a compspec has been defined for that command,  the\n       compspec  is  used to generate the list of possible completions for the word.  If the\n       command word is a full pathname, a compspec for the full  pathname  is  searched  for\n       first.   If  no compspec is found for the full pathname, an attempt is made to find a\n       compspec for the portion following the final slash.  If those searches do not  result\n       in a compspec, any compspec defined with the -D option to complete is used as the de-\n       fault.  If there is no default compspec, bash attempts alias expansion on the command\n       word as a final resort, and attempts to find a compspec for the command word from any\n       successful expansion.\n\n       Once a compspec has been found, it is used to generate the list  of  matching  words.\n       If a compspec is not found, the default bash completion as described above under Com-\n       pleting is performed.\n\n       First, the actions specified by the compspec are used.  Only matches which  are  pre-\n       fixed by the word being completed are returned.  When the -f or -d option is used for\n       filename or directory name completion, the shell variable FIGNORE is used  to  filter\n       the matches.\n\n       Any completions specified by a pathname expansion pattern to the -G option are gener-\n       ated next.  The words generated by the pattern need not match  the  word  being  com-\n       pleted.   The  GLOBIGNORE  shell  variable is not used to filter the matches, but the\n       FIGNORE variable is used.\n\n       Next, the string specified as the argument to  the  -W  option  is  considered.   The\n       string is first split using the characters in the IFS special variable as delimiters.\n       Shell quoting is honored.  Each word is then expanded using  brace  expansion,  tilde\n       expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic ex-\n       pansion, as described above under EXPANSION.  The results are split using  the  rules\n       described  above  under  Word  Splitting.   The  results of the expansion are prefix-\n       matched against the word being completed, and the matching words become the  possible\n       completions.\n\n       After these matches have been generated, any shell function or command specified with\n       the -F and -C options is invoked.  When the  command  or  function  is  invoked,  the\n       COMP_LINE,  COMP_POINT,  COMP_KEY, and COMP_TYPE variables are assigned values as de-\n       scribed above under Shell Variables.  If a  shell  function  is  being  invoked,  the\n       COMP_WORDS  and  COMP_CWORD  variables are also set.  When the function or command is\n       invoked, the first argument ($1) is the name of the command whose arguments are being\n       completed,  the second argument ($2) is the word being completed, and the third argu-\n       ment ($3) is the word preceding the word being completed on the current command line.\n       No  filtering  of  the generated completions against the word being completed is per-\n       formed; the function or command has complete freedom in generating the matches.\n\n       Any function specified with -F is invoked first.  The function may  use  any  of  the\n       shell  facilities,  including  the  compgen  builtin described below, to generate the\n       matches.  It must put the possible completions in the COMPREPLY array  variable,  one\n       per array element.\n\n       Next,  any  command specified with the -C option is invoked in an environment equiva-\n       lent to command substitution.  It should print a list of completions, one  per  line,\n       to the standard output.  Backslash may be used to escape a newline, if necessary.\n\n       After all of the possible completions are generated, any filter specified with the -X\n       option is applied to the list.  The filter is a pattern as used for  pathname  expan-\n       sion;  a  &  in the pattern is replaced with the text of the word being completed.  A\n       literal & may be escaped with a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting\n       a  match.   Any completion that matches the pattern will be removed from the list.  A\n       leading ! negates the pattern; in this case any completion not matching  the  pattern\n       will  be removed.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed\n       without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.\n\n       Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the -P and -S options are added to each\n       member  of the completion list, and the result is returned to the readline completion\n       code as the list of possible completions.\n\n       If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and  the  -o  dirnames\n       option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, directory name comple-\n       tion is attempted.\n\n       If the -o plusdirs option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, di-\n       rectory  name completion is attempted and any matches are added to the results of the\n       other actions.\n\n       By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is returned to the  comple-\n       tion  code as the full set of possible completions.  The default bash completions are\n       not attempted, and the readline default of filename completion is disabled.   If  the\n       -o  bashdefault  option  was  supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, the\n       bash default completions are attempted if the compspec generates no matches.  If  the\n       -o  default option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, readline's\n       default completion will be performed if the compspec (and, if attempted, the  default\n       bash completions) generate no matches.\n\n       When a compspec indicates that directory name completion is desired, the programmable\n       completion functions force readline to append a slash to completed  names  which  are\n       symbolic  links to directories, subject to the value of the mark-directories readline\n       variable, regardless of the setting of the mark-symlinked-directories readline  vari-\n       able.\n\n       There  is  some  support  for dynamically modifying completions.  This is most useful\n       when used in combination with a default completion specified with complete -D.   It's\n       possible for shell functions executed as completion handlers to indicate that comple-\n       tion should be retried by returning an exit status of 124.  If a shell  function  re-\n       turns  124,  and changes the compspec associated with the command on which completion\n       is being attempted (supplied as the first argument when the  function  is  executed),\n       programmable  completion  restarts  from the beginning, with an attempt to find a new\n       compspec for that command.  This allows a set of completions to be built  dynamically\n       as completion is attempted, rather than being loaded all at once.\n\n       For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each kept in a file cor-\n       responding to the name of the command,  the  following  default  completion  function\n       would load completions dynamically:\n\n       _completion_loader()\n       {\n            . \"/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh\" >/dev/null 2>&1 && return 124\n       }\n       complete -D -F _completion_loader -o bashdefault -o default\n\n", "Q: Terrible Battery Life I have an Acer Aspire One AO722 netbook that was getting ~7-8+ hours of battery life when using Windows 7 Home Premium. \nI figured, heck if I put Ubuntu and an SSD on this thing, I'd be able beat that handily as I've read that Linux has much less overhead and that an SSD is so much more efficient than a HDD.\nWell...not so much. I'm lucky if I get more than 2 hours on it now. Since this is horrible for a netbook I'm thinking of doing the unthinkable, putting Windows back on.\nI've seen LOTS of similar complaints on earlier versions of Ubuntu (I'm using 13.10) but no solutions that have worked for those others. \nHere's to hoping that I'll have some better luck in that someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong here before I dump Ubuntu in favor of an OS (Windows)that will give me the battery life one can expect from a low power computer like a netbook.\nAny help would be great. I'm brand new to Ubuntu (Linux) and was really hoping to make the switch from Microsoft for good.\nThank you\n\nA: Driver support for power management varies.\nIn general, Windows drivers on such devices a pretty well optimized, so usually battery life on Linux will be worse, unless you dig really deep into fine-tuning your power saving options.\nMake sure to uninstall software that you do not need. In particular desktop search engines that will check your hard disk for changes. Even when configured to only index on AC power, querying them takes some extra I/O, too. Use an IO monitor such as iotop to identify processes that continually access the hard disk.\nGraphics: on my netbook (Intel Atom), graphic effects cost battery life. Now Ubuntu users seem to be very keen on having pretty graphics effects, but in order to save battery, you may want to switch to XFCE (e.g. the Xubuntu variant of Ubuntu). The standard UIs with transparency, zoom, etc. operate your graphics card in 3D mode, and that may use a lot more energy, depending on the hardware.\nDrivers: Unfortunately, you bought a device with a Radeon GPU. AMD driver support seems to be worst. For best battery life, I would choose Intel graphics, as Intel works really closely with the Linux kernel developers, and has the best open-source driver support - and puts a lot of effort on power saving; whereas AMD and Nvidia mostly battle for the most power-consuming high-end graphics boards.\nAge: Batteries age. I used to get 8 hours from my Atom netbook (it was advertised with \"up to 12\", but these numbers are usually nonsense), but I believe I'm now down to 3 or 4 hours with actual use. Batteries lose capacity, and I doubt that Windows would get more than 5 hours out of the same battery now.

It is not safe. \nYou should only change the ownership of the files/folders. Be logged in as root and assuming all your prestashop files/folders are located in /var/www/public_html/ then cd to /var/www/ and type: \nchown -R www-data:www-data public_html/*\n\nIf you are not logged in as root, but you are a sudo user then just add sudo to the begining of the command: \nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data public_html/*\n\nWhat is chown\nchown changes the owner of ALL (see the /* at the end?) the files/folders under public_html to www-data. The semicolon between the users just specifies the user:user_group. The -R tells the command to be recursive and enter all the subfolders and apply those changes there. \nWhat is www-data\nDepends on your distribution of linux, it comes by default with x defualt users, like root. When you install certain applications, the applications create an application specific user. In many distributions, Apache creates a user named www-data. So by changing the ownership of the prestashop files/folders to www-data you essentially allowing the Apache server to manipulate the files as their permissions allow. \nOut of the box, it should work for you without any issues. You might going to have to change permissions to some upload/tmp folders, but only if uploads/upgrades/updates of files/modules fails. \n\nA: You need to have permission to change ownership. Add sudo to the commands you are executing:\nsudo cd /var/www/prestashop\nsudo chown -R www-data *\nsudo chgrp -R www-data *\n\nOr just do it all at once, using one command instead of three:\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/prestashop\n\n\nA: I used this command on SSH and it allows permission for apache user as well as FTP user:\n\n\n*\n\n*login to SSH\n\n*navigate to your prestashop website folder\n\n*while you are in it, type this command - replace 'yourftpusername' with your ftp username chown -R apache:yourftppusername *\n", "Q: How to install mysql without root access? I found this article that explains how to install MySQL without root access. However, on the MySQL download page is no download link for Ubuntu. Which one should I choose in this case?\nIf it has a \"generic linux\" choice that claims to be architecture-independent, why does it need all the other dependent ones?\nLastly, I don't know its dependencies. Since I cannot use a package manager (because I don't have root - Yargs!), I need to resolve everything manually. How do I do that?\n\nA: Without a package manager you can download source code. At the website you posted choose \"Source Code\" and then take the generic one: \"Generic Linux (Architecture Independent), Compressed TAR Archive\". Now you have to compile the source code. There are plenty of guides how to compile mysql manually.\n\nAnother option would be to download the Debian package from the list and unpack it manually:\nar x package.deb\ntar xzf data.tar.gz\n\nThen you find the binaries in the folder you unpacked the data.tar.gz.\n\nBut be aware, it is a pain, because you have to do this with all the libraries needed by mysql, too\n", "Q: Unable to login to my account using terminal I was trying to add some lines to the end of .bashrc file by following instructions to install rvm on Ubuntu 12.04 , now when i am putting in password after doing a sudo su the terminal freezes . \nFollowing are the contents of .bashrc\nCan someone please guide me what should i do to bring things back to the old working self , any help would be much appreciated .\n\nA: Other alternatives as suggested to sudo su command are sudo -i and sudo -H. \nI'm still wondering what caused the sudo su command to stop working.\n", "Q: less.vim not working on my Ubuntu 12.04 lts I found many sites saying that vim can be used as a pager like less with syntax highlighting.\nSo to make it work I added this line to my .bash_aliases file:\nalias vless='vim -u /usr/share/vim/vim73/macros/less.vim'\n\nbut when I run something like\nps -A | vless \n\nIt gives this output and exits without showing me the output of ps:\nVim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal\n\nPlease help!\n\nA: I found the problem. The above command vim -u /usr/share/vim/vim73/macros/less.vim is not handling input from STDIN correctly. However, opening a file with the above works just fine.\nFortunately the Vim installation provides a shell script less.sh which loads less.vim and handles the case where input is from STDIN correctly.

When a hacker gains access to your system it IS a successful authentication. So the system does not know that it is a hacker.

You haven't installed Ubuntu to your harddisk. Instead, you have a file that is stored on a Windows file system that is used to create a virtual harddisk. That file is 10GB large and is almost full. How much free space you have on the real disk is irrelevant. Windows can damage a Wubi install if you get a power outage or something like that, so it really isn't as dependable as proper Ubuntu installed on your disk. \nYou could resize that file and then expand the file system, but I would rather recommend that you install Ubuntu properly. It is easier and will give you much better results. If you copy your home directory from the Wubi install and to your proper install, you'll keep all your personal settings and data. \nIf you want to resize your Wubi virtual disk, I would recommend that you open a new question for that. \n", "Q: Stop Screen Dimming After 60 Seconds (MacBook running 12.04) I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on a MacBook air - everything works fine, apart from the fact that the screen dims after 60 seconds of activity.

This happened to me too.\nWhat you need to do now is to repair the Win7 boot loader. You can do that with a Win7 installation disk, by running the start-up repair utility. This will only repair the start-up files necessary for Win7 and WILL NOT erase all your files.

Here, we are matching ext4 and any following space or tab (needed to anchor the match, if your file systems are not ext4, you'll need to change that) and then capturing (that's what the parentheses do) the longest stretch of non-whitespace characters after that. In other words, capturing the options field of fstab.

The awk will then check if the 2nd field is / and if so, will add the required text to the 4th field, the options. The 1; is awk shorthand for \"print the line\". The sudo tee is just a trick to allow printing to /etc/fstab since simple redirection won't work with sudo.\n4. pure bash\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc.fstab.old\nwhile read fs mp ty op du pa; do \n    [[ $mp = \"/\" ]] && op=\"user_xattr,acl,barrier=1,\"\"$op\"; \n    printf \"%s %s %s %s %s %s\\n\" \"$fs\" \"$mp\" \"$ty\" \"$op\" \"$du\" \"$pa\"; \ndone < /etc/fstab.old | sudo tee /etc/fstab\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*while read fs mp ty op du pa; do ...; done < /etc/fstab : Read each fstab line and split into the relevant fields.\n\n*[[ $mp = \"/\" ]] && op=\"user_xattr,acl,barrier=1,\"\"$op\"; if the mount point is /, add the extra options to $op.\n\n*The printf just prints each line correctly.\n\n\nA: sed -i is not used only to add lines as you said. It can be used in many other cases. And in your case like follow:\nstr=\"/[[:space:]]*ext4[[:space:]]*errors=remount-ro[[:space:]]*0[[:space:]]*1\"\nsed -i.bak \"s#$str#/ ext4 user_xattr,acl,barrier=1,errors=remount-ro 0 1#\" /etc/fstab\n\nLike this $str which is equal with something like / ext4 errors=remount-r 0 1 (where each space can be any group of white spaces <tab> and <space>) will be replaced with / ext4 user_xattr,acl,barrier=1,errors=remount-ro 0 1 in  /etc/fstab file.\nThe class [:space:] (which match the whitespace characters <tab> and <space>) is specified by POSIX, so you should have no problems in using it in any shell.\n", "Q: How can Ubuntu be made grayscale?

For this, you need the program to be somewhere in your PATH, which is a list of directories the shell searches for executables that aren't given as full paths.\nThere are three ways of accomplishing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the program. Depending on where it came from, it probably has installation instructions which will place it in a directory already in the path, like /usr/bin. Be aware that installing it this way needs using sudo, or having root privileges.\n\n*Add the directory where the program is right now to your path. You can try this manually by first doing export PATH=$PATH:/home/john/someprogram-1.0, then trying to run someprogram only, it should work. TO make this change permanent, add the export command as shown above to your .profile file (this file already exists in your home directory).\n\n*Put the program in your private bin directory. Create bin in your home diretory, then copy the someprogram file into this directory. This may not work if the program needs access to other data files.\n\n", "Q: How to open MDI files?

I previously installed Gimp 2.6 onto my 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 machine using Ubuntu Software Center.  However, I recently tried out 2.8 and found that I like the changes and would like to install this version instead.  So, I looked up how to install and tried the following method:\nUninstalled Gimp 2.6 using the following methods:\n1) Uninstalled using Software Center (and uninstalled all add-ons)\nI have tried the following command-line actions as well:\n$sudo apt-get remove gimp\n$sudo apt-get autoremove gimp gimp-plugin-registry\n$sudo apt-get purge gimp*\n\nIt uninstalled fine, and was no longer listed as installed in Software Center.\nThen I tried the standard method to install Gimp via terminal:\n$sudo add-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp\n$sudo apt-get update\n$sudo apt-get install gimp\n\nThis worked perfectly on my laptop, which now has Gimp 2.8 installed and working great.

It was actually a problem with the apt-get-repository package itself, rather than something to do with gimp.  So I'm thinking I must have removed the above mentioned libheimbase.so.1 file while uninstalling something else, since this seems to be a shared file/library.  So I looked up the origins of this file and it's part of the package: libheimbase1-heimdal\nSo I installed/reinstalled this package:\nsudo apt-get install libheimbase1-heimdal --reinstall\n\nThen did the normal actions for installing the repository and gimp.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\nand everything is working perfectly now!\n", "Q: Using a package from another distribution I installed Desmume on Ubuntu 12.04, but the latest version is only 0.9.7 and I want the speed boost from 0.9.9.

Can you select single user mode (command prompt only mode) on the boot menu? If so, try to log in from there. Once you get logged in to a command prompt, create a new user with the command sudo adduser NEWNAME (NEWNAME is whatever you want). This will create a new /home/user directory for that user. Then reboot and try to log in as that user. It will probably work, which means some setting in your old /home were corrupted. The easiest thing to do then is just to copy your old /home/user data to your new /home/user folder.\nOk it sounds like you may have deleted a system partition.

I was told to install a Linux-based operating system as a replacement and I decided to try this version out. I didn't want to pay someone to install it for me, so I tried it on my own.\nI downloaded \"Ubuntu 12.04 LTS- 32-bit\" (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and waited about an hour for it to download the 730MB file. It was an image file (ISO file), so I used  \"Free ISO Burner\" to attempt to burn it. After three failed attempts to burn the file on a 4.7GB disk, I extracted the file with Winrar. I left the room and came back to find that the Ubuntu menu was up. The 730MB OS took up ALL of the disk space for the 4.7 GB DVD for some reason. Anyways, I clicked \"Demo and Full Installation,\" then clicked on \"Help Me Boot From a Live CD,\" since the computer didn't boot from the DVD after four attempts. It looked like it was working, but it stopped about the quarter of the way with the message:\nAn error has occurred: Permission denied. For more information please see the log file: c:\\docume~1\\hp\\locals~1\\temp\\wubi-12.04.4-rev280.log\n\nLink to Log (http://paste.ubuntu.com/7205612/)\nAnd that's my problem so far. Do I erase everything that was written on that disk and try to burn it over? Do I need an additional program to run it? \nMy specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*HP (L2000)\n\n*Windows XP Professional Edition (32-bit)\n\n*Processor: AMD Turion(tm) 64 Mobile Technology ML-40\n\n*Hard drive: 93GB worth of space available (45GB used)\n\n*RAM: 1024MB\n\n*Display adapter: ATI Mobility Radeon Xpress 200 (Video RAM: 128MB)\n\n\nA: Your Ubuntu iso should not take up all the space on the DVD. It is possible that the program you used to burn the iso, Free ISO Burner, got to the last stage of the disk burning where it says something like Finalizing... and then tried to eject the disk automatically and failed, possibly due to some hardware issue with the optical drive. So Free ISO Burner started burning all over again and that's why it filled up the disk.\nTo solve this you have to watch the application when the disk is being burned, and when you get to the end close the application with the mouse and eject the DVD manually. I also recommend that instead of Free ISO Burner you use Windows Disc Image Burner for Windows 7/8/10 or Infra Recorder as ubuntu.com recommends at How to burn a DVD on Windows. The disk burning speed for most disk burning applications is set to Maximum by default. For burning an iso you should always set the disk burning speed to Minimum. Also you should watch the disk burning process carefully, and when you get to the end after the finalizing, you should close the application manually before it starts all over again.  \nIf this seems nerve-wracking to you, there is another way to do it - you can write the Ubuntu to a USB flash drive of 2GB size or larger using an application called Rufus.  For Ubuntu 18.04 and later the USB flash drive should be 4GB or larger. For step-by-step instructions for how to create a bootable Ubuntu live USB for installing Ubuntu see this answer.\n", "Q: Xubuntu: Can I align the clock / notification / wifi etc area to the right - like win xp? Hi and sorry for a simple question...this is my first Linux installation for about a decade.\nFresh Xubuntu Install, in light of XP end. \nI can't seem to align my clock, wifi info, skype status, lanuguage flag, Audio settings, or username to the right.  They float on the end of the panel jumping left and right anytime I close/open an application. \nI'm an XP user, and am migrating to Linux.\nI can cope with the learning curve and the differences, but I'd like things to be similar where possible. Having the clock and notification area locked to screen-right would be nice, simply for the consistence of always knowing where it is, but also to simplify seeing other apps in the panel. I don't know if I did something to break things (I almost certainly did) and make it float, but I can't seem to fix it. \nI didn't want two (or more) virtual screens, so I think I deleted one, I wanted to simplify everything at first, meaning one screen only, then learn and grow from there.  It's possible (read: likely) that something I did allowed the clock etc to float.\nAnyway, it's pretty annoying, watching that clock jumping back and forth.  Almost as annoying as how long this post has got. \nI do thank you for any and all assistance.\n\nA: You can proceed as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*Add new item to the panel and select Separator\n\n*Drag the Separator and drop it between the windows icons and the notification area\n\n*Right-click on the separator and access Properties\n\n*Select Transparent and check Expand. \n\n\nNow it should behave. \n", "Q: lpstat is not showing all printers? I currently have about 6 printers installed on Ubuntu 13.10, but lpstat is only showing 3 of them. \nWhat is the best way to debug this, so that I can print to all printers from the command line, just like I could from a GUI application?\n\nA: As a partial workaround, I used lpstat -a, although that lists more printers than I want.\n\nA: \nlpstat  is  a  (partial)  simulation  for  the Solaris SystemV R4 print\n         facilities.  Please use lpq instead.\n\nSo, why don't use lpq instead? lpq -a should list all the available printers. After that you can use lpq -P printer-name to see details of an specific printer.\n\nA: To debug more, open a terminal window (Ctrl+Shift+T) and paste in this command:\nsudo cat /etc/cups/printers.conf\n\ncat, short for concatenate, shows files and print on the standard output.\nNow you should see all printers listed, that are locally installed. If it shows only three, the remaining (and missing) are network printers discovered automatically.\nThats the first step. \nThe next is the log entries made by cups in /var/log/cups/ folder. \n", "Q: Piping into GraphicsMagick I'm still learning the command line, and I'm having trouble piping a list of files into graphicsmagick for conversion to pdf:\nfind . -type f | sort | gm convert file.pdf\n\nThis gives the error: gm convert: Request did not return an image.\nCan I do this without resorting to more complicated methods?\n\nA: This is an old question, but I found it looking for a solution to the same problem and never really found a complete answer. I came up with a simple(-ish) way of doing it myself:\ngm convert $(find . -type f -printf '%p\\0' | sort -z | sed 's/\\x00/ /g') file.pdf\n\nIt won't work if there are spaces or new lines in any of the original files' paths, though.\nThis method has to execute convert once for every input file.

This seemed to indicate that it was more of a configuration issue than an xfce4 corruption. \nTherefore I logged in again as the regular user that had the problem and deleted the configuration folder, after terminating xfce4 process:\nmv ~/.cache/sessions ~/.cache/sessions.bak\n\nThen I restarted xfce4 and everything was working great!

I am curious about how Ubuntu One automatic file sync works under the hood. When I add or change a file in my file manager, how does it know that the change occurred and it needs to sync it? This will likely need a somewhat technical answer.\n\nA: The Linux kernel supports something called Inotify. Using it, you can tell the kernel to notify you when something happens to a file or folder. So you can do something like \"Whenever a new file is placed in this folder, or whenever a file in this folder has been changed, run the following action\". \nYou can be notified when a file is created, read, written to, opened, closed, moved (or renamed), deleted, etc. \nI don't know for a fact that this is how Ubuntu One file sync works, but I think it's a good assumption. If you're interested in the techniques, I suggest reading up on Inotify. \n", "Q: How do I reset the colors of my terminal? Help!

You might be able to connect to this shell if you haven't rebooted your server yet. If you are extremly lucky you may find a way to recover or downgrade - otherwise going back to a back up is a safe approach.\n", "Q: Why I cannot use the Fn + (up) to control the brightness? I have a Lenovo zhaoyang K27 with Intel® HD Graphics 3000. Since I installed Ubuntu for the first time, about two years ago, I haven't been able to change the brightness by Fn+^. I found a solution in the following command:\necho 1450 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nwhere 1450 is the brightness value. This is the only way I could find to change the brightness. \nTo set the sound by the function keys ( Fn+< and Fn+> )works well, only the brightness is the problem.\nHow can I solve this issue?\n\nA: I am in no way an expert but my best guess is that in windows that would work through a Lenovo driver that \"translates\" (sorry if this is not the correct term) the key combination to the change in brightness.\nIf my assumption is correct, you might be able to use xbacklight -set 40 (where \"40\" represents the percentage of brightness - you can change this to whatever you want see here for more details) and assign you key binding of choice to it.\nEDIT: The above will set the backlight temporarily. If you want this permanent, you need to add this to start up (see link above). If you want to increase the brightness by, say 10% you can use xbacklight -inc 10 or xbacklight -dec 10 to decrease it.\nUnfortunately I am not sure how to set the keybindings and I don't want to misinform you , but the \"Custom Shortcuts\" section here might be a good place to start.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why does nfs-kernel-server only pretend to stop? Background: I had an NFS server, ran fine for years, needed to hard reboot it, and now I cannot get the daemon to stop when it's told to.

It is unlikely but theoretically conceivable to find a system that has no bash at /bin/bash. It is also possible that the user running the script has their own  bash version that is somehow different. \nUsing env means that the first bash instance in the user's path will be chosen. This means that #!/usr/bin/env bash will always work with the user's chosen bash version and it should always evaluate to an available bash even in non-standard systems. This becomes much more important if you are using another interpreter, not bash. Perl for example, can be installed to different locations on different systems but env will find it regardless.\nSo, using #!/usr/bin/env PROGRAM is a good habit to get into since it makes your scripts more portable to different *nix versions.\n\nA: If you have serveral versions of bash installed(possible), using #!/usr/bin/env bash will ensure that the bash used is the first one on your environment's $PATH.\nUsing #!/bin/bash will be hardcoding the binary stored in #!/bin.\nRefer: Similar question on SO\n", "Q: Create a file and write to it Trying to create a file auto.home under /etc and write this to the file:\n192.168.56.101:/NFS/home/&\n\nI am not doing it with commandline, but bash script.\nTried this but didnt work: cat 192.168.56.101:/NFS/Home/& > /etc/auto.home\n\nA: You can use \"EOL\" to indicate when you want to end writing to your file using cat as follows:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ncat > temp_file << EOL\n192.168.56.101:/NFS/home/&\nEOL\nsudo mv temp_file /etc/<filename>\n\nThis would keep writing to temp_file, until it gets \"EOL\" meaning End of Line.\n\nRefered from: A similar question on SO\n\nA: You can't use sudo for redirection, the command will be run with root privileges but the > (redirection) will not so you'll get a \"Permission denied\" error. Using here-docs as Jobin's answer does will not help.\nInstead, you can use one of these approaches:\necho \"192.168.56.101:/NFS/home/&\" | sudo tee -a /etc/auto.home\n\ntee lets you append (-a) to a file, since you're running it with sudo it will work.\nAlternatively, use a temp file and move it:\necho \"192.168.56.101:/NFS/home/&\" > home.auto && sudo mv home.auto /etc\n\n", "Q: Problem to start ssh automatic My Ubuntu 12.10 don't start ssh automatic when I boot it. \nSo when I use this after I restart my system appear Booting system without full network configuration and I can't use ssh for external clients. \nI want to use a openvpn.

When Ubuntu was installed on this computer, its boot partition received all available hard disk space(except for the part given to swap).\nNow, whenever I am trying to shrink the area occupied by boot, GParted blocks most of the menu options (including resizing).\nSo, why can't I resize boot? Also, is there a tutorial about working with GParted from tty or pts?(everything I found so far uses the GUI menus exclusively, which may get very frustrating after a while).\n\nI've tried using a Live CD (by burning the downloaded Ubuntu iso on a dvd), so I've changed ROM to boot from ODD as the first option, but the Live CD still doesn't show up, and Ubuntu boots as usual(this part was more like a secondary point).\n\nA: I think Avinash Raj answered most of this question in the comments, but I'll go ahead and write an answer just to square it off.\nIn your screen shot Gparted has locked the partitions of the drive (sda) because you are using the partition sda1 (/) to run Ubuntu and Gparted.\nTo edit the partitions on sda you will need to boot a live cd. When you do this the partitions will not be locked and Gparted will allow you to resize them.\nYou will have to right click the linux-swap partition and select swap-off to move that partition when using the live cd.\nAs far as booting the Live cd goes, try pressing: Esc, F1, F2, ..., F12, Del. when the computer is starting. Just run your finger from Esc to F12 then Del (delete). That's the lazy way of doing it. It usually brings up the boot selection screen for me. The alternative is reading the boot screen or the manual for the computer.\n\nA: As an alternative to using a live CD you can simply attach your storage device to another computer.  As an auxiliary storage device you will be able to do anything to your auxiliary storage device's boot partition that your partition editor will allow you to do.\n\nA: This will screw up your grub, you can follow this link, to make boot repair after partitioning your disk and installing windows.  I recently had to use this method and it works if you install windows on a separate partition after Ubuntu is already installed.  Do not see why the reversal would be any different, for any other OS or just for partitioned space to backup files as well.  \nNot sure if the method would be the same if you run the Ubuntu live CD, resize your Ubuntu partition, then create a new fat or ntfs partition for installing windows.  You could download the Boot Repair Disk, or follow the 2nd option through the Ubuntu live CD, thought that this was the simplest method from own personal experience:\nBoot Repair\nNo matter what, partition or no partition, windows, if installed after Ubuntu, overtakes your boot and you will have to fix your boot.  Another words, still have to run the Boot Repair Disk.\n\nA: To do this you need to unmount the partition which you will be resizing. my best bet is to download gparted iso from google and resize whatever partition you want\n\nA: Do not resize your partitions. You won't be able to install Windows and dual-boot with Ubuntu.\nYou should delete all your partitions including the extended partition with that huge swap space. \nYou can download Ultimate Boot CD and burn it on a regular CD. It is a small 580MB iso image. This is the direct link for download.\nAfter you burn the UBCD iso image, you can reboot computer with the UBCD in tray, and then you can select from the menu /HDD/Partition Management section. Use Gparted or Cute Partition Manager to completely delete all your partitions from your hard drive. Next you can save your empty partition table, exit Gparted or Cute Partition Manager, take out UBCD from tray, reboot and poweroff your computer.\nAnd next you can start by installing Windows first using your Windows DVD. Windows DVD has its own partitioning tool, and you can use it to allocate some space from your hard disk for windows system (C: drive), and maybe create another NTFS partition to keep your windows files (D: drive).\nAfter you finish installing Windows, you can choose to reinstall Ubuntu using your Ubuntu DVD. Choose the third option given by Ubuntu installer Something else, and when you get to the partition table, you can allocate space for your Ubuntu root partition, and do not worry about swap space, Ubuntu installer will automatically create the swap space too. Just don't forget to choose your mount point (which is usually root /) before you press next to start installing Ubuntu.\nYou can use half the space from your HDD for Windows, creating 2 equal size NTFS partitions, and the other half for Ubuntu. Or you can create just one primary partition for Windows (up to 50-80GB space), and after you finish installing Windows, you can use Gparted tool from UBCD to create a large extended partition using the rest of your disk space with many logical drives (2 or more NTFS drives, and also 2 or more Linux ext4 logical drives for Ubuntu).\n", "Q: LD_LIBRARY_PATH I have tried to link VINCIA to ROOT, but there is a problem related to the location of the shared libraries in my system.

I have heard, that Ubuntu 14.04 will have Trim enabled by default. How will this be done? By adding a discards option to the ext4 mount options or by running a cron-job? \nWill the default options for Trim be automatically compatible with the LVM and encryption layers of the standard Ubuntu-system encryption?\nIt would be great to see some details about this.\n\nA: Claiming that 14.04 will enable trim by default is only 1/2 the story.\n\nWill the default options for TRIM be automatically compatible with the LVM and encryption layers of the standard ubuntu-system encryption?\n\nLVM is a container and is not a filesystem so this is not an issue.\n\nArticles worth reading:\nBlueprint\n\nSSDs need to be TRIMed, i. e. they need to be told which blocks the OS\nconsiders as \"unused\" (i. e. from deleted files). Withouth this, the\nwrite speed on SSDs becomes unbearably slow over time.\nhttp://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/SSD/TRIM (German) explains the details, but this\nkind of housekeeping really should happen by default. There are two\napproaches to this, immediately marking the blocks as unused when\ndeleting a file (\"discard\" mount option), or calling fstrim regularly.\ndiscard slows down deletion while a cronjob occasionally puts some\npotentially unexpected IO load on the machine, so this discussion is\nprimarily about deciding which approach we want to do by default.\nI (Martin Pitt) think that a cron approach is better. If we go with\nthis we need to discuss when and how to run this:\n\n*\n\n*Whats a reasonable interval (weekly/monthly/etc.)\n\n*How to detect devices/partitions which need trimming (/proc/mounts, hdparm -I, not mounted with \"discard\", etc.)\n\n\nConclusion from that link in German:\n\n*\n\n*cron job on weekly basis since discard will lead to too much of a performance hit.\n\n\nOnly Intel and Samsung SSDs will have TRIM enabled by default in Ubuntu 14.04 because some cheap SSDs can even brick themselves when running TRIM. The contents of /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim on 14.04 beta 2:\n#!/bin/sh\n# call fstrim-all to trim all mounted file systems which support it\nset -e\n\n# This only runs on Intel and Samsung SSDs by default, as some SSDs with faulty\n# firmware may encounter data loss problems when running fstrim under high I/O\n# load (e. g.  https://launchpad.net/bugs/1259829). You can append the\n# --no-model-check option here to disable the vendor check and run fstrim on\n# all SSD drives.\nexec fstrim-all\n\nThis doesn't mean TRIM should only be used with Samsung and Intel SSDs, but to avoid running into issues, this is the default option for now. Note that if you already know your SSD can handle TRIM, you can bypass the vendor check by editing the /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim file above and adding the --no-model-check option to the last line:\nexec fstrim-all --no-model-check\n\nAlternatively, you can schedule TRIM manually a few other ways. How to do it manual.\nSource: webupd8\n\n*\n\n*BUT not all SSD's are supported. Mine is not by the way (just checked)\n\n*LSI.com has a list of compatible SSDs in this PDF.\n\n\nThe method to do trim is with this command:\nsudo fstrim -v /\n\nAnd this is also how Ubuntu does this: by creating a cronjob that does this on a weekly basis.\nExecuted from my own system:\nrinzwind@schijfwereld:~$ sudo fstrim -v /\n[sudo] password for rinzwind: \n/: 93283299328 bytes were trimmed\nrinzwind@schijfwereld:~$ \n\nTakes a bit of time and it does not show any progress until done.\n", "Q: How do I Uninstall a Program and Dependencies from a tar.bz2? I installed a program using make and sudo make install.

Sometimes you can run sudo make uninstall from the same directory that you ran that command from, but it's rather rare honestly. \nThis is why it is usually best to install only from .deb packages, since they almost always can be cleanly removed from your system. \n", "Q: How do I install OpenMW? OpenMW seems like a great game, and it reboots a classic, but What is it exactly, and how do I Install it?\n\nA: OpenMW is an game engine based on that of Morrowind, an RPG game from 2002. Although its still in Alpha, it works. It and its editor(OpenCS) has been written completely from scratch. Do you like Morrowind? then you are gonna love OpenMW.\nBefore we begin:\n\nPlaying Morrowind with this engine still requires one to own the Morrowind data files.\n\nMeaning if you have installed Morrowind via wine, you can Invoke the dash, search for OpenMW, select the Morrowind data files, and then play the game. This was such in my case.\n\nYou do need to own Morrowind to play using OpenMW. OpenMW looks for a directory on your system containing the 'Data Files' section of an existing installation of Morrowind. That 'Data Files' folder contains all of the art assets and game data from Morrowind and is the only thing OpenMW needs to be playable. It has become difficult to find a retail copy of Morrowind, but it is currently available on Steam and that version works just as well.\n\nInstall\nI will show you guys how to install OpenMW using the PPA and compiling option. And as we go will provide download links for the Windows/Mac os x equivalent.\nPPA\nBy far the easiest way is installing via it's official PPA, it supports a variety of distros. Users that are running Windows, can go here, and download the latest OpenMW. As for Mac, the following link will provide dmg's: come and get me.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:openmw/openmw\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openmw\n\nInvoke the dash, search for OpenMW select the Morrowind data files, and the play the game.\n\nFrom source\nUsually - on a Linux machine - when you want the latest features, you compile the application yourself, which is what we are gonna do. For compiling it in a different OS then Linux, Mac or Windows, see there official wiki: Development Environment Setup - OpenMW Wiki\nDependencies\nAdd the OpenMW PPA to download the needed dependencies: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openmw/openmw, after that refresh your sources list: sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git libopenal-dev libogre-1.9-dev \\\nlibsdl2-dev libqt4-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev \\\nlibboost-wave-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev \\\nlibboost-system-dev libav-tools libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev \\\nlibavutil-dev libswscale-dev \\\nlibbullet-dev libmygui-dev libunshield-dev libtinyxml-dev cmake build-essential\n\nCompile\nThen we configure, compile, and install OpenMW.\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ../\nmake\n\nAnd your done.\n\nPersonal Pick\nSource:\nExcerpt from:\n\n*\n\n*How do I install OpenMW - EuroBytes\nWhich I am the author of.\n", "Q: Trouble with mx record and mailbox I have a machine running on Internet with valid IP address 216.x.x.x.

Sometimes users run into problems when doing them, so when should I run a partial upgrade, if ever?\n\nA: See the information provided on this web site:\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/U%2B1/partial_upgrade\n\nSummary\nIf you use Update Manager to upgrade your packages, and it\noffers to do a Partial Upgrade do not accept it without thoroughly\nchecking what packages it offers to remove, upgrade and install. If\nyou do, you will most likely end up removing packages that shouldn't\nbe removed, and waste time and effort repairing your testing\ninstallation and asking for assistance.\nMost Partial Upgrade situations occur due to package archive\ninconsistencies, which will typically be resolved within a few hours.\nIf your package manager is confused, and so are you, simply wait and\nhold off the updates until things settle down.\nShort Version\nDue to the fact that uploads to the repositories of the\nactive development branch are asynchronous and uncoordinated,\ndependencies of certain packages may arrive later than the dependent\npackage. This causes package management tools such as Update Manager,\nwhich are mainly meant to be used with stable releases of Ubuntu where\nthe package archive is always consistent, to interpret the situation\nas requiring a dist-upgrade to install new packages and/or repair\npackages in a reqreinst (requires reinstallation) state. What Update\nManager performs when doing a \"Partial Upgrade\" is a dist-upgrade.\nWhen testing development releases, most of the time, a Partial Upgrade\nis undesired. The situations where it's needed are limited to new\npackages obsoleting old ones (as in the case of the software-center\npackage replacing software-store) and package removals from the\narchive.\nDo not assume that since you're running a development release, a\nPartial Upgrade is necessarily warranted.\n\n", "Q: What does \"chmod +x \" do and how do I use it? I want to write the Ubuntu analogue of a \"batch file\" (a shell script). But I don't know how to use chmod +x filename command to make it so that the script can be run. Nor do I know where to use it.\n\nA: First, your script must declare which interpreter to use. You do this in the first line of the file. If it's a shell script, it should be #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/bash.\nSo here's a script that writes your username: echo-whoami.sh\n#!/bin/sh\necho $(whoami)\n\nTo make it executable, use:\nchmod +x echo-whoami.sh\n\nThen you can run it using:\n./echo-whoami.sh\n\n\nA: In Short:\nchmod +x on a file (your script) only means, that you'll make it executable. Right click on your script and chose Properties -> Permissions -> Allow executing file as program, leaves you with the exact same result as the command in terminal.\nIf a file you want to change permissions on is located within the systems directory you may need to be root, like so: (be careful, while using sudo command)\nsudo chmod +x /usr/share/testfolder/aFile \n\nAlso it is not clear, what exactly you want to archive here. Please edit your question and give some more detail on the actual problem!\nYou can also refer to this question, for more information: chmod u+x' versus 'chmod +x\n\nIn Long:\nType man chmod in a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and you'll get the following output:\n\nNAME: chmod - change file mode bits\nSYNOPSIS\nchmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...\nchmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...\nchmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...\n\nDESCRIPTION\nThis  manual page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the\nfile mode bits of each given file according to mode, which can be either\na  symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number repre‐\nsenting the bit pattern for the new mode bits.\n\nThe format of a symbolic mode  is  [ugoa...][[+-=][perms...]...],  where\nperms  is  either  zero or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single\nletter from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic modes can  be  given,  sepa‐\nrated by commas.\n\nA  combination  of  the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the\nfile will be changed: the user who owns  it  (u),  other  users  in  the\nfile's  group (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users\n(a).  If none of these are given, the effect is as if a were given,  but\nbits that are set in the umask are not affected.\n\nThe  operator  +  causes  the selected file mode bits to be added to the\nexisting file mode bits of each file; - causes them to be removed; and =\ncauses them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except\nthat a directory's unmentioned set  user  and  group  ID  bits  are  not\naffected.\n\nThe  letters  rwxXst  select file mode bits for the affected users: read\n(r), write (w), execute (or search for directories) (x),  execute/search\nonly  if  the  file is a directory or already has execute permission for\nsome user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s),  restricted  dele‐\ntion  flag  or sticky bit (t).  Instead of one or more of these letters,\nyou can specify exactly one of the letters ugo: the permissions  granted\nto  the  user  who  owns  the file (u), the permissions granted to other\nusers who are members of the  file's  group  (g),  and  the  permissions\ngranted  to  users  that  are in neither of the two preceding categories\n(o).\n\nA numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding\nup  the  bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be\nleading zeros.  The first digit selects the set  user  ID  (4)  and  set\ngroup ID (2) and restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The sec‐\nond digit selects permissions for the user who owns the file: read  (4),\nwrite  (2),  and  execute  (1);  the third selects permissions for other\nusers in the file's group, with the same  values;  and  the  fourth  for\nother users not in the file's group, with the same values.\n\nchmod  never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system\ncall cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem  since  the\npermissions  of  symbolic  links are never used.  However, for each sym‐\nbolic link listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions  of\nthe  pointed-to file.  In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encoun‐\ntered during recursive directory traversals.\n\nSETUID AND SETGID BITS\nchmod clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's  group\nID  does  not  match  the user's effective group ID or one of the user's\nsupplementary group IDs, unless the  user  has  appropriate  privileges.\nAdditional  restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits\nof MODE or RFILE to be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and\nfunctionality of the underlying chmod system call.  When in doubt, check\nthe underlying system behavior.\n\nOPTIONS\nChange the mode of each FILE to MODE.\n\n   -c, --changes\n          like verbose but report only when a change is made\n\n   --no-preserve-root\n          do not treat `/' specially (the default)\n\n   --preserve-root\n          fail to operate recursively on `/'\n\n   -f, --silent, --quiet\n          suppress most error messages\n\n   -v, --verbose\n          output a diagnostic for every file processed\n\n   --reference=RFILE\n          use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values\n\n   -R, --recursive\n          change files and directories recursively\n\n   --help display this help and exit\n\n   --version\n          output version information and exit\n\n   Each MODE is of the form `[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+'.\n\n\nA: A batch file and a shell script are two terms meaning effectively the same under Linux. The term script is far more often used, though.\nThe most simple shell script file just contains commands as you'd type them on the command line (that is, the Bash command interpreter). In theory you can even replace the interpreter with any language you like (and have an interpreter for). To be more explicit, it's suggested you start your first line with\n#!/bin/sh (if you wan't maximum portability with legacy systems)\nor\n#!/bin/bash (if you want some extra features, you probably don't care about today)\nAfter this line enter your commands, one on each line. There are lots of extra constructs beyond the scope of this questions, see man bash or http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/Bash-Beginners-Guide.pdf (for Beginners) or http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/abs-guide.pdf (for more advanced questions).\nTo actually run your script, there are two requirements: First, the interpreter process needs to read the file, and second it checks if it is marked as executable. For convenience reasons it's also useful to be able to write to your script (so you can make changes or fixes should need be).\nAssuming further that you want team members and other also to be able to run (and see) your script, but that you don't want them to manipulate it, the combination of\n\n\n*\n\n*execute rights for all (a+x or +x, as a is the default),\n\n*read rights for all (a+r or +r, as a is again the default),\n\n*write permissions just for you (u=w)\n\n\nare usually sensible values of your file permissions. You can type the single actions concatenated, separated with a comma.\nWhile this \"action language\" is very fascinating (note the difference of the + and the = operator which result in different outcomes depending of the permission setting before you changed them), they are tedious to type.\nAs all of the actions create bit masks that are applied internally, you can type the bitmasks (see man chmod for details) also directly.\nFor a shellscript chmod 755 myscript.sh makes most sense in at least 95% of all cases.\n", "Q: Can't set Transmission to download files Just installed Ubuntu 12. on my new computer.

To change your terminal to the right monitor you have to edit:\nsudo vim /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/guake/guake_app.py\n\nthen change in line 831:\nwindow_rect = screen.get_monitor_geometry(monitor)\n\nby:\nwindow_rect = screen.get_monitor_geometry(1)\n\nkill and restart guake\nAnyone knows a way to do this less hacky?\n\nA: As lalit said, the best way I found to do this on ubuntu 14.04LTS was changing\nwindow_rect = screen.get_monitor_geometry(0)\n\nto \nwindow_rect = screen.get_monitor_geometry(0)\n\nbut changing \n    if width < total_width:\n    if halignment == ALIGN_CENTER:\n        window_rect.x = (total_width - window_rect.width) / 2\n    elif halignment == ALIGN_LEFT:\n        window_rect.x = 0\n    elif halignment == ALIGN_RIGHT:\n        window_rect.x = total_width - window_rect.width\nwindow_rect.y = 0\nreturn window_rect\n\nto \n if width < total_width:\n     if halignment == ALIGN_CENTER:\n         window_rect.x += total_width + (total_width - window_rect.width) / 2\n     elif halignment == ALIGN_LEFT:\n         window_rect.x += 0\n     elif halignment == ALIGN_RIGHT:\n         window_rect.x += total_width - window_rect.width\nwindow_rect.y = 0\nreturn window_rect\n\nThe only difference its in the first \"if\", without adding \"total_width\" to \"window_rect.x\" guake appears in the middle of my left monitor.\nP.S: Sorry Lalit but I cannot add a comment to your post since I have no points yet =(\n\nA: The solution by wilfo doesn't work to me.

Logging out of the guake session does not end the Guake process.\nOpen system monitor and kill the guake application process then restart\n\nA: I had to change this on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with 2 monitors.  \nI was trying the above methods but realized the code had changed since.  I went into ~/.gconf/apps/guake/general and edited %gconf.xml and changed display_n (int) from 0 to 1 for my 2nd monitor.\nHope this helps :)\n\nA: I try in Ubuntu 14.04,\nI found you just need to click \"Preferences\" at guake icon (right top screen) in either monitor, then click \"Show\" in the same monitor, then you can see guake terminal pop out at the monitor you are using !!! \n", "Q: How to download other different deb files with apt-get in Ubuntu? Is there any way how to download another version of deb files with apt-get in Ubuntu 12.04? In Ubuntu 12.04, the default version is precise, and when we use the sudo apt-get install ** command to install packages, the apt-get can find the suitable packages automatically. But is there any way to download the deb packages with specific version, such as Ubuntu 10.04(Lucid)? In my circumstance, I have an Raspberry Pi, its main version is Debian and its symbol version is wheezy. When I use the sudo apt-get install **, the network speed is very slow. So I want to add the apt source address of wheezy into my Ubuntu 12.04's apt source addresses. And use the Ubuntu 12.04 to download the wheezy's packages, then copy them into the Raspberry Pi and install.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Rather than damage your main system with an incompatible archive, an appropriate tool such as apt-offline is available in the Wheezy archive as well as for 12.04.  That package would allow you to set up your package download request on the Pi, copy it to removable media, download the packages on the 12.04 system, and then be able to safely take them back to the Pi for installation without damaging the 12.04 through introducing incompatibility issues.\n", "Q: uninstalled Ubuntu One but still seeing `com.ubuntu.one.fsevents` There is a previous post on how to uninstall Ubuntu One from a  Mac and I have done all of what is required.

With the soon to be demise of Ubuntu One I started looking at other ways to store backup in the cloud. I already had the Dropbox client installed and have been storing back ups there for now. \nNot wanting to use all of my space there this got me to looking at ways to manage my other personal clouds with Google, OneDrive and Box. After some research I came across a solution here using this software . It isn't as good of a solution as a native client, but it does work. \nThe problem I am running into is with UFW enabled the client cannot connect. I have looked through SMES' paltry FAQ and scoured the internet until my eyes bleed to no avail.\nIs there any way to find out what ports need to be opened in UFW for this to work without shutting UFW off? \n\nA: It seems like you are asking what ports are open on your computer. You can tell this with the nmap and ifconfig commands.\nInstall nmap with:  \nsudo apt-get install nmap\n\nRun ifconfig and find the network interface your using (ethernet usually uses eth0 and wifi uses wlan0). Look for the inet address. This is your local address.  \nNow scan your computer for open ports with nmap:  \nsudo nmap -p 1-65535 <address>  \n\nWhere <address> is the inet address you found earlier. This will scan your computer and tell you what daemons/services are listening on what ports. Your program should be there.  \nYou'll need to allow this port through ufw with:  \nsudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port <port> \n\nOr just:  \nsudo ufw allow <port>/tcp \n\nWhere <port> is the port we just found.\n", "Q: Long Term Package Mirrors I am having a bit of a tricky packaging problem with my Trusty Ubuntu cloud machines.  I understand that Trusty is currently in \"beta\", so I can appreciate that I sort of have to just deal with it.  But there is a wider problem, and I'm looking for a general solution to it.\nBasically, an important package (unbound) for my infrastructure got broken by an upgrade.  Since the Ubuntu archives automatically delete old versions of packages (which effectively makes it a rolling release distro, a point for another day...), I am not able to use the basic apt tool to downgrade to the last version.  In particular, what I'd like to do is say:\nsudo apt-get install unbound=1.4.21-1ubuntu2\n\nand have apt-get install that version.  But since it is not in the repositories, the command won't work:\n$ sudo apt-get install unbound=1.4.21-1ubuntu2\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nE: Version '1.4.21-1ubuntu2' for 'unbound' was not found\n\nI understand I can use dpkg -i to install the package.  But that solution does not work for me -- I'd have to change my hammer to deal with a defective nail.\nSo, is there any \"long-term\" repository mirror I can use?  A mirror that methodically keeps at least a few older versions of each package?\n\nA: In general the structure of apt repositories does not allow for multiple versions of a package to be present.  A list of all package mirrors for Ubuntu can be found at Launchpad.  Since Ubuntu inherits from Debian the apt repository system, the description there of the repository format helps explain how it is set up.  An example of where a directory on the archive may contain multiple versions but for different releases would be in the pool for xubuntu-docs where there are versions for each separate release but not multiple versions per release.\n", "Q: How to display screen by screen in terminal I am searching some files in terminal but the files is too long, how can I view them screen by screen.\n\nA: Pipe the command to more:\n<command> | more\n\nor if you want to go up and down the text (using arrow keys), pipe it to less:\n<command> | less\n\n", "Q: Installing D-Link DWA-131 (13.10) I found this thread:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/439901/how-do-i-install-a-d-link-dwa-131\nBut it has been closed.

Edubuntu for example is for educational purposes.\n\n*KDE, GNOME, XFCE, etc. are \"Shells\". Linux OS's don't have one single interface which the user has to use. Users can use different interfaces, i.e shells. What these do under the hood is the same, although their look and feel is quite different from each other. Under the hood, all of them just communicate with Ubuntu and tell it to do stuff, like connect to the Internet, mount a pen drive, tell the contents of a pen drive, etc. So in short, these are shells, which provide different interfaces for Ubuntu.\n\n*Unity is also a shell, which is provided by default with Ubuntu.

To your specific questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sort of. In order to share documents between users, you should have a separate partition for the folders like Documents, Pictures, Videos, etc. The users will then have links to these directories in their /home/user directory. In order to separate the settings between the users, you have some options:\n\n*\n\n*Different user for each of the OS partitions (this is what I do)\n\n*\n\n*You would have one /home partition, each user would have their own folder\n\n\n*Same user for both OS partitions\n\n*\n\n*You would have a /home partition for each user\n\n\n\n*No, swap is a generic partition only used when the OS is running. It can be shared among however many Linux installations are present.\n\n*That is up to you. See the link above for a guide to what different partitions do. I opt for the simpler method of just / and /home but the freedom of Linux means you get to choose.\n\n*\n\n*The only exception to this is if you plan on booting with the newer UEFI method.

I'm using Ubuntu since one year and it got everything I need daily. I've written couple of applications like gps tracking and live video streaming in C++ with netbeans on Ubuntu. \nThe only drawback with Linux distributions so far I encountered is untidy gui interface for editors like gedit, netbeans, etc. These type of Applications have bigger buttons, bigger boundaries, untidy scroll bars, etc. I think all these applications share common API to generate graphical objects like buttons, scroll bars, etc. \nI love coding in netbeans on Windows rather than on Ubuntu because of look and feel.

I know I have to format /dev/sda2 since that is obviously Windows 7. But what is /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda4? I don't want to accidentally format the USB drive. \n\nA: The USB device is not in the list. So you won't format it. It will be recognized as sdb (or sdc) \nsda1 is the first partition created by windows to store boot loader there.Let it be as it is.\nsda4, I really don't know what it is. Possibly 8GB of hard disk in unused state? You can see in windows by running diskmgmt.msc. You can keep it as it is or create a new 8GB partition or extend lenevo recovery partition by 8GB. (You can't merge the portion to any other partition as it resides after Recovery partition)\nRegarding formatting.. here are some simple instruction. Hope this helps (the following considers you are replacing windows with ubuntu, not dual booting. This also delete all data in the C drive, so backup before you do anything),\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Something Else when installing ubuntu and selecting where to install it.(As you already did in screenshot)\n\n*Select sda2, click delete. \n\n*Now you will get a free partition, select that, click on new. Select partition file system as SWAP. Enter the required size. (A SWAP  partition should be 1.5 x Sizeof RAM.) If you have large RAM like 4-6GB, you may skip this part. However, hibernation will not work without swap partition.\n\n*Click on rest of the free space, click on new, select file system type as ext4 / ext3 and mount point /\n\n*Make sure device for instllaing bootloader is set to sda (your hard disk)\n\n*Click on install to install ubuntu on that partition. \n\nA: You do not need to wipe /dev/sda2 to install Ubuntu. The last partition /dev/sda4 has sufficient space to hold it. This is what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Optional but a live saver when needed: If you have an external drive available, make a full image copy of the internal notebook drive /dev/sda. You can use the dd command to backup the full disk. If you are short on external drive space, a combination of dd and ntfsclone is workable as well. If things go wrong, you can restore the complete drive to the current status very easily.\n\n*Using dd, make an image backup of /dev/sda4. If you do not have an external drive to store it, use /dev/sda2 to hold it. This means you do not erase /dev/sda2, but mount it and use it's free space to hold the image copy.\n\n*Tell the installer to use /dev/sda4 for Ubuntu. I would not delete the partition but just format it. If your laptop has more than 1GB of RAM, I would not use a swap partition (which requires re-partitioning in your case) so it is very easy to go back and restore /dev/sda4.\n\n", "Q: What is equivalent to WakeOnLan software in Ubuntu?

Segmentation or Paging scheme that ubuntu 12.04 use to allocate the main memory? Does it use both of it?  How? \nIf it doesn't use both scheme, so what the scheme that should be use? why?\n\nA: Intel introduced the concept of memory segmentation in the 286, but the only OS I know of that really used it was OS/2.  All modern operating systems just use paging as the memory protection mechanism.  Why?  Because it is far more flexible.  It isn't easy or convieient to have to divide memory up into entirely disjoint segments and address them separately.  It is far more simple to use a flat memory space that you may or may not configure with different access permissions on different pages.\n\nA: Like all Linux-based systems running on Intel or similar hardware, Ubuntu allocates and manages main memory in pages, and even the chips themselves are set up to manage memory in pages. For more information see for example http://www.redhat.com/magazine/001nov04/features/vm/.  The article is old so some details have changed, but the concepts are still the same.\nLinux (including Ubuntu!) on other hardware architectures with virtual memory also use pages in all cases I am aware of, for example the ARM architecture.\n", "Q: Bash script to tar a folder saves basepath My script tars a folder in my /home/user directory and saves it all in a backup folder.

I just kill it inside (Gnome) System Monitor whenever it bugs me.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but there are two things you can try.\n\n\n*\n\n*htop. This is an alternative to top. It adds scrolling and some other useful features, which might help you see a process that might be using a lot of CPU.\n\n*System Monitor. This is a built-in application and is the Ubuntu equivalent to Windows Task Manager. It will let you sort by different things and kill tasks, all graphically.\n\n\nA: The high cpu usage would mostly likely be attributed to cpu/gpu interactions mainly due to the compositing and the stock window manager; running somewhere north of 300 processes 'out of the box' at start up. As an alternative install openbox, which will then become your window manager. By doing so you drop your cpu processes in idle stat from around 320-380 to ~250-290 or less. You can use a Ubuntu like desktop only it will run with the openbox window manager.\nAlso install gkrellm. Its a realtime system monitoring application written and maintained by Bill Smith and company. It real-time reads the kernel's output. You can monitor your system processes with it and find out what works best for your machine.\nThese pics are of gkrellm which shows the difference in the processes via\nboth dTop environments.\n\n\nThe Ubuntu Desktop environment relies heavily on python. Disabling it would lead to false output.\nGood Luck! Don't join the darkside! The force is with Ubuntu!\n\nA: Just a shot in the dark but I've had this occur with lightdm hogging cpu time.

Essentially, this is like entering a password and having it be typed as English when the server was expecting it to be in Greek.\nSo, in order to fix this, we need to convert the OpenSSH key to a SSHv2 (otherwise known as RFC4716) key. OpenSSH provides a command to do this:\nssh-keygen -e -f /path/to/openssh/public/key > /path/you/want/the/rfc4716/key\n\nRun this, and take the output and upload it to the server, if the keys haven't already been converted server-side.\n\nA: On server was changed SSH to SSH2. That was a reason. It was solved by converting the key. \n", "Q: Problem connecting to some websites I've some problem connecting to certain websites, using Ubuntu 12.04 in Dual Boot Windows 7.\nWebsites like https://github.com/, https://developer.paypal.com/ and https://www.facebook.com/ keeps on loading for long time.\nIts so weird, it opens sometimes, then it doesn't sometimes.\nI don't know how to debug this issue.

However, I'm willing to guess that this isn't actually your problem. To rule out this possibility, you'll need to find an HTTPS site that works.  Does, for example, https://askubuntu.com/ work? It should.  If not, your problem may be related to HTTPS sites.\nAnother type of filtering by your ISP?\nHowever, there is still another issue: your ping result suggests the problem is not related to your use of HTTPS (as ping does not use HTTPS).\n--- github.com ping statistics ---\n92 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 90999ms\n\nThis suggests that the problem isn't HTTPS. It could still be that your internet connection is filtered in some way. For example, ping could have been filtered in addition to those HTTPS connections.\nDoes your internet access require a proxy?\nOn the other computers that work, check if they access the web via some proxy server. This may need to be configured in your operating system. On Windows based browsers these settings can be accessed from within the browser settings of any browser - look for proxy settings.  It's possible that you need to set up equivalent proxy settings in Ubuntu.\nCould it be a routing issue with your ISP\nOccasionally an ISP may have a routing issue, whereby a connection upstream to them is temporary down, blocking access to some sites.  This will often be a temporary issue and resolved relatively quickly.\nIt is rare, however, for such issues to block only some sites but leave access to all other sites.  It could however mean that you can access local sites - sites hosted geographically near you - and are temporarily unable to access more distant sites such as overseas hosted sites.\n\nA: I am not sure this will work or not . But I think you can check the website with \nhttp://www.isitdownrightnow.com/\nIf the website is working then install add-on to your browser form http://www.webproxy.net/ \nTry to visit the website. Actually it worked for me several times. Hope it works for you too.\n\nA: At first I was going to say it may be a DNS problem, but after looking at your screen-shot of the ping to github.com, I don't think it is. The IP is correct, and it should reply back. I tested on my machine (12.04) here in the central U.S. and I get a average time of 68 ms and no packet loss.\nYou should contact your ISP and have them test your connection because something isn't working correctly.\n\nA: I just discovered what I believe is the answer to my problem.  I looked at my proxy settings and discovered that some how instead of no proxys, the setting had changed to automatically use proxy.  I accessed this by using the Firefox settings and sure enough after I restarted Firefox, all of my previously blocked websites are now accessible.  My suspicions as to how the proxy settings were changed include several firewall programs which I installed via apt-get.\nDave\n", "Q: Second Monitor not Displaying on Boot up I have 2 monitors connected one with VGA and one with HDMI.

I start inserting the new text at the end of the file.\n\nA: As stated in one of the other answers already, this is happening because your file is being overwritten each time you save the file. The tail command was designed to monitor log files in which new lines are appended to the file.\nIn this particular situation I would use the following as a workaround:\nwatch -n 1 cat file.txt\n\nThe watch command executes a command periodically. The update interval, in seconds, is specified with -n and can be adjusted to your liking.\n\nA: First, you get the error because you are using a text editor for this. This means that every time you open the file, edit and save it, the original is overwritten with the new contents. Whether you added a single line to the end or 100 lines all over the place is irrelevant, the point is that the file is being opened, edited and saved and that overwrites the contents.\nFor example, compare your workflow to running this:\nfor((i=0;i<20;i++)); do echo $i >> file.txt; sleep 1; done\n\nThat will write a number to file.txt every second for twenty seconds. If you open another terminal and run tail -fn 0 file.txt, you will see the output you expect.\nSo, to get the desired behavior add the text to the file using >> from a terminal instead of manually editing it.\n\nMore details\nnano seems to be the odd one out here. Most editors when opening a file then saving it will actually delete the original file and save a new one with the same name. You can test this by checking the inode number of the file:\n$ ls -il file.txt\n16647801 -rw-r--r-- 1 terdon terdon 9 Apr  6 18:19 file.txt\n\nFiles are simply hardlinks to specific inodes, in this case, file.txt points to inode 16647801. Now, open the file in gedit, add a line and check the inode again:\n$ gedit file.txt\n$ ls -il file.txt\n16647854 -rw-r--r-- 1 terdon terdon 13 Apr  6 18:23 file.txt\n\nAs you see, the inode number has changed, in other words, the original file was removed and a new one was created. nano does not do that, trying the same thing with nano does not change the inode. It does, however, delete the original contents overwriting them with the new contents. That's why tail actually shows the output, if you try it and edit the file with gedit (or emacs or a number of other editors), the extra lines you add won't be shown in the output of tail at all.\n", "Q: Can I recover windows after Ubuntu installation?

If you want to know about details, read on\nThe cause of issue\nIn the question itself, it is reported that OP sees too many arguments error, which when tested in bash doesn't seem to be the case:\n$ [ $1 != '' ] && [ $2 != '' ]\nbash: [: !=: unary operator expected\n\nWith /bin/sh which is actually symlinked to /bin/dash on Ubuntu, error reported as follows:\n$ sh\n$ [ $1 != '' ] && [ $2 != '' ]\nsh: 1: [: !=: unexpected operator\n\nAnd the standalone /bin/test also :\n$ /usr/bin/test $1 != ''  \n/usr/bin/test: missing argument after ‘’\n\nSidenote: If you're wondering what is /usr/bin/test and why I'm using bash and sh, then you should know that [ is alias for test command, which also exists as standalone executable or more commonly - as shell built-in which is what each shell will use first. As for if statements, they operate on exit statues of commands, hence why [ and test are commands, with everything else being arguments to that commands - improper order of those command-line args leads to errors.\nBack to the topic: it's unclear how OP got the unrelated error. However, in all 3 cases the issue is the same - unset variable will be treated as empty, thus what the shell sees with  these unquoted variables is \n[ != '' ]\n\nwhich breaks syntax which test understands. Remember what I said about improper order of command-line arguments ? Hence why quoting is important. Let's enable diagnostic output and see what shell executes:\n$ set -x\n# throws error\n$ [ $1 != '' ] && [ $2 != '' ] \n+ '[' '!=' '' ']'\nbash: [: !=: unary operator expected\n# no error\n$ [ \"$1\" != '' ] && [ \"$2\" != '' ] || echo null vars\n+ '[' '' '!=' '' ']'\n+ echo null vars\nnull vars\n\n\nBetter way to test unset variables\nA very frequent approach that you see around is this:\n if [ \"x$var1\" == \"x\"  ] && [ \"x$var2\" == \"x\"  ];                                                                \n then\n     echo \"both variables are null\"\n fi\n\nTo quote Gilles:\n\nIn [ \"x$1\" = \"x\" ], the x prefix ensures that x\"$1\" cannot possibly look like an operator, and so the only way the shell can parse this test is by treating = as a binary operator.      \n\nPresumably, this should be fairly portable since I've seen these in /bin/sh scripts. It also can be combined as in\nif [ \"x${var1}${var2}\" == \"x\" ]; then\n    ...\nfi\n\nOf course we could use -z flag, however according to research in some shells, particularly ksh88 (according to Stephane Chazelas), this flag is faulty. \nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*Performance of test command in various shell\n\n*Bash operators \\[ vs \\[\\[ vs ((\n\nA: I think the title of the post is not accurate, as the intention in the message was to check if $1 and $2 are not null.\nThe given example was just missing double quotes in $1 and $2 to work. \nVariables must be double quoted to be expanded when comparing strings.\nBut, to check if $1 and $2 exist is the same as check if $2 exist, as it can't exist if $1 doesn't. \nThe 'if' command is also not needed in this case, as 'test' returns true/false and uses '&&' as 'then' if return is 0/true:\n[ \"$2\" != '' ] && commands...\n\nSimpler, with -n (nonzero):\n[ -n \"$2\" ] && commands...\n\nTo \"check if $1 and $2 are null\" would be the same as check if there is no parameter:\n[ $# -eq 0 ] && commands...\n\n\nA: Since this is tagged bash, I recommend that one use the extended test construct ([[...]]), and forget the quotes:\nif [[ -z $1 && -z $2 ]]; then\n...\n\nUnless you are going for sh/POSIX compatibility, there is no reason not to use [[ ]].\n", "Q: Forgotten Password, need assistance with no grub menu This is my first time using Linux so I'm still new to all this.

So i did some research, and aparently the guest container binds to the host's /proc/sys (which makes sense), so i modified the hosts value by adding the proper value to the hosts sysctl.conf and then i rebooted the host for good measure:\nuser@host:~$ sudo sysctl -A | grep -i nonlocal\nnet.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1\n\nas noted above, the host reflects the configuration that i want to see the in guest container, but even after rebooting, the container -still- shows the same problem.\nHow do i modify these values in the guest container, is it even possible?\n\nA: I had the same issue.  You are right that it is related to LXC containers.  I added \nnet.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1\nto my LXC host's sysctl.conf , then ran: \nsysctl -p (requires root access/sudo)\nI did have to reboot the container for the change to take effect.  Also, you will still get sysctl: cannot stat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_nonlocal_bind: No such file or directory\non the container.

Any advice, thanks!\n\nA: The minecraft.jar file is actually just a launcher, it downloads the neccessary files for minecraft and puts them in the .minecraft folder of your home directory. \nI'm also running minecraft in chrubuntu, and it works fine. Looking at the file I downloaded, it is actually called \"Minecraft.jar\" (capital M), so make sure that your file is actually called \"minecraft.jar\". \nThe jar file does not require executable permissions (it only has rw permissions on my system).\nTry moving the file to your home folder, make sure that it is called \"minecraft.jar\", start a new terminal window and run\njava -jar minecraft.jar\n\nIf that does not work, make sure that your user owns the file. If your username is \"myuser\" type\nsudo chown myuser:myuser minecraft.jar\nchmod +r minecraft.jar\n\nto make sure that the file is owned my you, and that it is readable. \nTo make sure that the file is actually there, type\nls -la minecraft.jar\n\nwhich would print something like this\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 myuser myuser 280212 mar 15 16:44 minecraft.jar\n\nIf everything else fails, try downloading the file again. Good luck.\n\nA: You can change permissions like this. \nsudo chmod 700 minecraft.jar\n\nThan run this with java environment:\njava -jar minecraft.jar\n\nMake sure that you use the right path to .jar file. You can always drag and drop (a) file/files into terminal, instead of typing the path.\nSo in this case type:\nsudo chmod 700 \n\nfollowed by dragging minecraft.jar into terminal.

For that purpose, exit root shell, set nvidia as prime device and restart the display manager i.e.\n# exit\n$ sudo prime-select nvidia\n$ sudo service gdm restart\n\nAfter login, the driver registers the audio controller with Alsa and hence you can select HDMI audio in sound settings now. Hope this helps someone.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Dual Boot Is it safe to install Ubuntu 12.04 on a Samsung NC-110 netbook from a liveUSB, or does it have UEFI problems? I'd like to install Ubuntu alongside my current Windows 7 OS, but I googled \"problems dual booting Ubuntu\" and 'Samsung UEFI' appeared a lot. I don't really want to brick my computer, and so was wondering whether it would be safe to dual boot or not? Thanks :)\n\nA: Dual boot is not a problem if UEFI is not a problem. \nTo check if UEFI is a problem, you can try liveUSB without installation first, if it can boot into liveUSB, probably with some configuration in BIOS to disable security boot and enable Legacy mode, it can install on your hard disk. I don't think you can brick your computer, UEFI will try to stop you from booting into non-windows OS, and that's it. \n\nA: If you want to dual boot your system with Windows and Ubuntu, I suggest using WUBI an installer program which runs on Windows. Using this you can install and uninstall Ubuntu like any other program check complete guide on how to do it\nhttp://www.aquicklookat.com/linux/installing-ubuntu-within-windows/\n", "Q: File not found on http://localhost:8080/ I have just installed Tomcat7 using apt-get install tomcat7. In CATALINA_HOME I can see default index.html file and it runs fine using localhost:8080/. Now I have placed a .war file to deploy in this same folder and run http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge.war and http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge as well, but it won't work. It says HTTP Status 404 - /JavaBridge. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: you need to place the war file in the correct Tomcat directory and then by default the name of the WAR file defines the context root.  Then your web.xml file (unless you are using anotations) defines these rest of the URL by way of servlet mappings.  Thus the full URL you type in the browser is: \nhttp://localhost:8080/<context-root>/<servlet-mapping>\n\nA: Try deploying the war by using tomcat manager. Set the tomcat user in conf/tomcat-users.xml, type http://localhost:8080/manager on your browser, and then deploy it using Tomcat-GUI manager. Make sure you give manager-gui and manager roles to your user.\n", "Q: How does the system know which paths to search for executables? I know there are directories like /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin and so on, and that files in those directories can be run directly from the terminal. How does the terminal know to look at those paths? \nI've heard that the paths are stored in /etc/bash.bashrc or ~/.bashrc, but /sbin is not present in those files. Is there a specific file in which the paths are set, and can we add our own paths, other than using bashrc?\n\nA: /etc/environment contains all data about path of that programs you can add new path there.\nPath included in /etc/environment, /etc/bash.bashrc , ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile is automatically initialized after loging into shell.\n\nA: Yes PATH variable.  You can create your own bin directory as follows:\n    mkdir $HOME/bin\nAdd $HOME/bin to the PATH variable using bash shell export command:\n    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\necho $PATH\nMove hello.sh in $HOME/bin using the mv command, run:\n    mv hello.sh $HOME/bin\nExecute the script at any path:\n    hello.sh\n\nA: The paths for executable scripts and files are in the PATH environment variable:\nenv | grep PATH\n\n", "Q: File permissions and applications How does ubuntu protect against executable files which become executable through another installed app changing the permissions? I mean it is possible to check applications do not change file permissions by checking their code but is there any other way of doing that?\n\nA: I don't think permissions can propagate, imagine in a pipe, you still need to add \"sudo\" for each command in order to lift the permission constraint, not only once.\n", "Q: How do I control which drive Ubuntu installs to? I have 2 320 GB drives on my computer. I have Windows 7 installed on Drive C:  How do I install Ubuntu onto Drive D, and still have dual boot capability?\n\nA: When you get to the \"Installation type\" window, choose the \"Something Else\" option.

I need to install on dual-boot mode.\nIs there anyone who can direct me to the correct way?\n\nA: I'm afraid that your points 1-4 are all the exact opposite of what you should have done.\nComputers that come pre-installed with Windows 8 or 8.1 almost invariably boot in EFI mode. When installing Ubuntu for dual-booting with a computer that's already booting in EFI mode, it's almost always easiest and best to install Ubuntu in EFI mode. In the case of most modern PCs, that also means installing the 64-bit version of Ubuntu, because EFI ties the OS bit depth to the CPU bit depth more tightly than does BIOS.\nTo learn how you should have done it, consult one or both of the following pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*My page on EFI-mode Linux installations\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki on the same topic\nAn EFI-mode installation need not be a nightmare, but it can quickly become so if you follow bad advice or flounder about randomly. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad advice on this topic on the Internet. Also unfortunately, what works for one installation often doesn't work for another, because EFI implementations vary widely from one to another. (Some of this variation involves bugs, but some of it is variation that's occurred where the EFI spec is vague about some detail.)\n\nA: I would like to add that I may be a [rare?] case of this method working with which you have originally posted.\nI did all of the bullet points except for the first one and it worked like a charm and I struggled for a good day trying to get around this fast-boot crap.\nI had win 8 pre-loaded and needed to replace it.\nAs Rod said, just find what works for you. Good luck!\n\nA: Enable legacy boot and save it. \nPress escape key while booting up. \nIt will give options to select bios and boot options. Press f9 for boot options. There you can see your Ubuntu or Linux OS. Select that and continue. There you go. \n", "Q: Is using PepperFlash plugin unsafe because it isnt open source? I'd rather use the newest version, and (starting from Chromium 35, I believe) you can only use Pepper Flash. BUT I'd rather avoid closed source software as that implies a security risk if the code isn't under public scrutiny.\nAm I correct?\n\nA: Being open source does not necessarily mean the code is going to be scrutinized by the public, or that it will be fully audited and properly scrutinized, even if it is. It simply means that it can be.\nFor Flash, you don't have much choice. There are some open source Flash plug-ins, but a very large number of sites just won't work in them, as the sites will require much newer versions of Flash. Whether you are using the Pepper based plug-in that Google builds in Chrome (Chromium is open source and will not include the Flash plug-in), or the last supported version of the Adobe Flash plug-in that is available, you are still using proprietary software. The only true way to not use proprietary software is to not use Flash at all.\n\nA: No, Pepper Flash isn't unsafe because it isn't open source. Google is investing a lot of resources to work on Pepper Flash and keep it safe and secure. The software model is a very secure one and you shouldn't worry about using it.\nIn fact, the alternative open-source Flash players, Gnash and Lightspark, probably won't be any more secure than Pepper Flash.\nIf you want to stay as open source as possible and still retain a lot of functionality, Chromium is the way to go.\n\nA: I'm using browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash (it is just a wrapper for pepper flash) so can run flash in firefox - that is \"sandboxed\" in firejail ( basically a sandbox in which firefox runs)\n", "Q: Eclipse on Ubuntu 12.04 - minimal c/c++ installation I want to use Eclipse IDE for developing C/C++ applications.

Ever since I 'm on ubuntu 10.10 now 12.04 I'm having the some trouble with any video that I play in fullscreen, the image gets a horizontal cut, like this:\n\nIn ubuntu 10.10 I had a nVidea GTS 250 graphic card, and now I have an onboard Ati 3200HD video and I get the some results, doesn't matter which player I use (mplayer, vlc, or even a flash videos on fullscreeen get cut like this).\nI don't know where to look, what setting change, what to install. I need help to get this fixed. It is driving me crazy\nRight now I'm on ubuntu 12.04 x64 and I got Ubuntu's default graphics drivers installed.\n\nA: This is an example of video tearing. If you have installed the catalyst drivers, search an option related to it. I think it was called AMD \"tear-free\" but I don't remember exactly  the name (long time using NVIDIA cards), and activate it.\n", "Q: Can LibreOffice Writer read Microsoft Documents? I'm just wondering.Because I don't know if there are some things you can do in LireOffice Writer but you cannot do in Microsoft Word.Because my son does a lot of computer projects and I installed Ubuntu on VirtualBox so he can use it and install Dropbox on it to transfer a document on to my Windows 7 computer (The computer that I used to install it Ubuntu on a virtual machine) and keep working on both machines.\n\nA: I would invite you to look at Does Microsoft Office 2010 still have incompatibility issues with LibreOffice\nBut since there is also Office 2013 and several issues when saving Office 2007+ files, I will answer your question first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can LibreOffice Writer read Microsoft Documents?\nYes it can. It will read them. The problem is that, depending on what is inside the document and what version of Office it is, you may find a problem or two related to how the document is viewed or set up.\n\n*Will LibreOffice Writer read all type of Microsoft Documents correctly?\nNot yet. At least, to give you an idea, since LibreOffice 4.0 there has been a lot of improvements over how the Microsoft documents and read, written to and saved/loaded. I would even go so far as to say that 4.x is dedicated to provide the best compatibility between both. Each gradual new version (eg: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3....) has made many improvements regarding this. I had a question (can't find it right now but you can look for it in Ask Ubuntu) where I mentioned that most if not all 2010 documents were read correctly. This was alse when a user sent me one of his documents and after testing his problem it was found that indeed, not all documents, at least to the point of 4.2.0 could not read the document 100% correctly. Problems like footers, headers, some tables and image positions had issues.\n\n*Where can I get the latest PPA of LibreOffice to test if it fixes an incompatibility problem?\nYou can look at Is there a PPA with the latest version of LibreOffice? for more information\n\n*Where can I see what updates regarding Microsoft compatibility are found for LibreOffice versions:\nyou can go to the Release Notes at LibreOffice for the latest stable one or go to the Development Version to see what changes will come. In this case it is the 4.2.3. You can even jump to the newer (future) version of 4.3 where you will find a lot of changes towards compatibility. From footer and header issues, to importing nested comments, to better load/save speed for DOCX files to even improved OOXML support. So, with that you can see how the development is going, what issues are still on the table and what else is needed to fix them. To give you an idea on how many fixes are typically found, we can look at 4.2.3 where we see the following Microsoft DOCX/OOXML fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft Office and OOXML filter improvements\n\n*Numerous improvements to interoperability with Microsoft Word's DOCX format:\n\n\n*\n\n*Writer now preserves the 'Track Changes ON' when present in a DOCX (track changes data itself is partially preserved) fdo#64826 (Adam Co)\n\n\n*Solid page background color now roundtripped in DOCX. fdo#65257 (Adam Co)\n\n*Fix for page border margins in DOCX. fdo#64350 (Adam Co)\n\n*Fix for different Odd & Even page flag ignored. fdo#65655 (Adam Co)\n\n*Fix for hidden footer being imported to Writer as normal footer. fdo#64238 (Adam Co)\n\n*Writer now preserves underline color. fdo#65710 (Adam Co)\n\n*Writer now preserves character shading. fdo#65400 (Adam Co)\n\n*Writer now preserves page numbers that don't start at '1'. fdo#66543 fdo#44689 (Adam Co)\n\n*Fix for export of text-box inset property to DOCX. fdo#66929 (Adam Co)\n\n*Fix for DOCX export of page border - (interoperability export case #2) http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Writer/MSInteroperability/PageBorder\n\n*Fix for preservation of bullets with level 0 (should not be shown) fdo#66781 (Adam Co)\n\n*Fix for page border shadows in DOCX. fdo#64350 (Adam Co)\n\n*Borders in headers\\footer now not being lost. fdo#67013 (Adam Co)\n\n*Text-Box background gradient color now preserved correctly. fdo#65295 (Adam Co)\n\n*Preserve rotation information on bitmaps. fdo#70457 (Jacobo Aragunde)\n\n*Fix wrong position and size values on exported shapes. fdo#70838 (Jacobo Aragunde)\n\n*Preserve Smart-Art information. (Jacobo Aragunde, Andrés Gómez, Miguel Gómez)\n\n*Fix wrong alignment and directionality when open DOCX file. fdo#43093 (Faisal M. Al-Otaibi)\n\n*Fix wrong directionality after save file created by MS. fdo#71646 (Faisal M. Al-Otaibi)\n\n*OOXML floating table improvements. For more details, see this blog entry. (Miklos Vajna)\n\n*Ampersand in document title causes corrupt docx fdo#63053 (Abdulmajeed ahmed)\n\n*Significant speedups of all OOXML parsing - by splitting parsing / tokenisation into a separate thread, and many other related optimisations to the FastParser (Matus Kukan, Michael Meeks)\n\n*Support for the default Microsoft Office 2010 and 2013 Agile decryption mechanism (Tomaž Vajngerl)\n\n*Support for OOXML encryption fdo#59524 (Tomaž Vajngerl)\n\n*Numerous other improvements have been made to the Microsoft OOXML Import and Export filters as well as for the Microsoft Office binary file formats and the RTF format. Details:\n\n\n*\n\n*OOXML Filters→ OOXML, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, VML\n\n*Microsoft Office binary file filters→ DOC, XLS, PPT, \"ww8\"\n\n*RTF Filters→ RTF\n\n\n\n*How will LibreOffice work with Pre-Office 2007 version (97, XP, 2003)\nWith this particular version it will work most likely 100%. With over 50K documents in 2003, I have not gotten a single problem in the past 4 years of testing. If you do find a bug, please send it to the LibreOffice team, but in my tests I have not found a bug related to 97, XP or even 2003. All or most compatibility bugs started to appear with the arrival of 2007 and the OOXML/DOCX zipped files. So much so that Office 2003 was offered a compatibility upgrade to fix 2003 <--> 2007 DOC problems. Even 2007 received a Service Pack that tried to solve many issues related to DOCX with previous versions.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu Desktop compatible with Acer Aspire hardware Does anyone know if Ubuntu Desktop 13.10 is compatible with the Acer Aspire ATC-605-UB11.

Thanks in advance... \n\nA: I turned secure boot off in the bios and installed mint 16 from a DVD.  Both Windows and Linux seem to be happy.  I could not get the install DVD to boot with secure boot enabled.\nI don't know what the ramifications of running Windows 8.1 without secure boot enabled are but it is working.\n", "Q: Can I deploy Linux/Ubuntu from a wim file? I would like to put Linux on to a install.wim file. Is it possible to deploy in this way?\n\nA: Hypothetically yes, but there could be a few problems. I would not recommend using an archive format designed for Windows operating systems to deploy a Linux system, though I understand why it might be tempting. Consider using .tar instead of .wim.\nProblem #1 = Grub2 Boot Manager won't be installed so you'll have no way to boot the deployed system, though \"boot-repair\" run from a livecd might be able to fix this.\nTo install boot-repair use:\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nTo run boot-repair use:\nboot-repair\n\nProblem #2 = There aren't many programs available for creating wims so you'll probably have to use imagex or dism both of which are only available for Windows operating systems. I suppose you might be able to use p7zip (the linux version of 7-zip if it supports wim?), but it won't use compression. If you use dism or imagex Windows can't read ext2/ext3/ext4 systems so you can't make an image if you can't access the partition. You may be able to run dism or imagex in Wine or you can install a special driver on Windows like the one that Paragon makes, or there is another one I can't recall the name of to add filesystem support to Windows. It's also worth noting that imagex doesn't support extended attributes, which I believe Ubuntu uses.\nProblem #3 = Will the .wim be able to retain linux file permissions. If it doesn't your deployed system will have all files belonging to whatever user extracted the .wim which would leave your system very unprotected since Linux systems rely almost entirely on file permissions to protect themselves from viruses and hackers. It may also affect the systems ability to run? Will it even be able to read certain types of linux files that aren't supported in Windows?\nProblem #4 = When you deploy to a new hard drive Grub2 bootloader will remember the UUID of the drive you installed to. You won't be able to boot on any other systems unless you use a linux live cd to change the UUID of the partition you are deploying to to match the original drive's UUID. You can do this with tune2fs.\nTo find the UUID of your source partition use:\nsudo blkid\n\nTo change the UUID of the partition being deployed to use:\nsudo tune2fs /dev/sda1 -U theuuidgoeshere\n\n", "Q: installing ubuntu on acer laptop without hard drive My Acer laptop kept rebooting, not allowing me to even access the bios. so i took out the hard drive and that solved the problem.I then put ubuntu on a flash drive and proceeded to install it.I got to the screen where it says installation type.It only gives me the option of /dev/sda when i click on install now it says no root file systom is defined, and it wont let me click on the option of a new partition table, or to change or anything. i dont know if its my computer or im just doing something wrong. Any help would be apreciated.\n\nA: You have to have a spot to install the system. A flash drive only works as a temp system. Loads itself into memory when using and as memory is volatile when you shut down it is wiped. Sounds like your hard drive has failed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu updates blocked apt-get last week ubuntu asked to install some updates.

Problems with \"sudo\" I have installed Ubuntu using the GUI, giving myself a password and everything. I do not intricately remember the process. However, what worries me is that I don't know the following password:\n$ su\nPassword: <the only password I've ever created on this machine>\nsu: Authentication failure\n\nI just don't know what to do. I'm not in trouble, but I just want to know what's going on here. I can also lock myself out of directories:\nstarkers@ubuntu:~/Desktop$ mkdir foobs\nstarkers@ubuntu:~/Desktop$ sudo chmod 777 -R foobs\nsudo: /var/lib/sudo writable by non-owner (040777), should be mode 0700\n[sudo] password for starkers: <the only password I've ever created on this machine> \nstarkers@ubuntu:~/Desktop$ cd foobs\nbash: cd: foobs: Permission denied\n\nI'm just a bit confused. How can I lock myself out like this? I think sudo is the key command here. But I'm making the foobs file as open as it can possibly be via the chmod, so why does it lock me out?\n\nA: 1. Why you don't have a root password\nWhile you can create a password for the superuser account allowing you to log in as root with su, it's worth mentioning that this isn't the usual way of doing things with Ubuntu (or increasingly, other distributions as well).  Ubuntu chose not to give a root login and password by default for a reason.  Instead, a default Ubuntu install will use sudo to give superuser privileges.  In a default Ubuntu install the person who installed the OS is given \"sudo\" permission by default.\nAnybody with full \"sudo\" permission may perform something \"as a superuser\" by pre-pending sudo to their command.  For instance, to run apt-get dist-upgrade as a superuser, you could use:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nYou will see this usage of sudo pretty much anywhere you read a tutorial about Ubuntu on the web.  It's an alternative to doing this.\nsu\napt-get dist-upgrade\nexit\n\nWith sudo, you choose in advance which users have sudo access. There is no need for them to remember a root password, as they use their own password.  If you have multiple users, you can revoke one's superuser access just by removing their sudo permission, without needing to change the root password and notify everyone of a new password.  You can even choose which commands a user is allowed to perform using sudo and which commands are forbidden for that user.  And lastly, if there is a security breach it can in some cases leave a better audit trail showing which user account was compromised.\nSudo makes it easier to perform a single command with superuser privileges.  With su, you permanently drop to a superuser shell which must be exited using exit or logout.  This can lead to people staying in the superuser shell for longer than necessary just because it's more convenient than logging out and in again later.\nWith sudo, you still have the option of opening a permanent (interactive) superuser shell with the command:\nsudo su\n\n... and this can still be done without any root password, because sudo gives superuser privileges to the su command.\nAnd similarly, instead of su - for a login shell you can use sudo su - or its shortcut sudo -i.\nHowever when doing so you just need to be aware that you are acting as a superuser for every command.  It's a good security principle not to stay as a superuser for longer than necessary, just to lessen the possibility of accidentally causing some damage to the system (without it, you can only damage files your user owns).\nJust to clarify, you can, if you choose, give the root user a password allowing logins as root as described in @Oli's answer, if you specifically want to do things this way instead.  I just wanted to let you know about the Ubuntu convention of preferring sudo instead and let you know that there is an alternative.\n\n2. The problems with your chmod 777 -R command\nYour question also has a second part to it: your issues with the command sudo chmod 777 -R foobs.\nFirstly, the following warning indicates a potentially serious security issue on your machine:\nsudo: /var/lib/sudo writable by non-owner (040777), should be mode 0700\n\nThis means that at some stage, you've set /var/lib/sudo to be world-writable.  I imagine you've done this at some stage using a command like sudo chmod 777 -R /.  Unfortunately, by doing this you've probably pretty much broken all file permissions throughout your system.  It's unlikely that this will be the only important system file whose permissions have been changed to be world-writable.  Essentially you have an easily hackable system now, and the only easy way to get it back would be to re-install.\nSecondly, the command you were using:\nsudo chmod 777 -R foobs\n\nWhen manipulating files within your home directory, in this case in ~/Desktop, you should not have to use sudo.  All the files you create in your home directory should be modifiable by you anyway (and if not, something funny is going on).\nAlso, you need to be fully aware of the consequences of changing file permissions en masse, such as doing it recursively or on a huge number of files.  In this case, you're changing carefully set up file permissions to be world-writable.  Any other user, or any buggy server software on the machine, may have easy access to overwrite all of these files and directories.\nIt's almost certain that chmod 777 -R [dir] it is not an appropriate solution for whatever problem you were trying to solve (and as I mentioned above, there is evidence that you have done it to system files in /var/lib too, and I assume to lots of other places).\nA couple of basic rules of thumb:\n\n*\n\n*If you're just messing with your own files in your home directory, desktop etc, you should never need to use sudo or superuser rights.  If you do, it's a warning sign that you're doing something wrong.\n\n\n*You should never manually modify system files owned by packages.  Exception: unless you're doing it specifically in ways documented by those packages, such as by modifying their configuration in /etc.  This applies also to changing file permissions.  If a tutorial or attempt to fix the problem requires sudo or superuser rights, and it's not simply a change to a configuration in /etc/, it's a warning sign that you're doing something wrong.\n\nA: By default, the superuser (root) account is disabled and doesn't have any password.\nYou can create one by running:\n$ sudo passwd root\n\nYou will then be able to login as root by running su using this password.\nAs for chmod, the correct command would be:\n$ chmod 777 -R foobs\n\nYou can also use: \n$ sudo -i\n\nto login as root using your password (without creating a root password as described above).\n", "Q: Lubuntu 12.04 on powerbook g4 \"Wireless Networks device not found (firmware missing)\" I installed Lubuntu 12.04 on my powerbook g4 but when I try to connect to WiFi it says \"Wireless Networks device not found (firmware missing)\" How do I fix this?

You can also set it up to email you when it does so.  You can find a nice setup guide here.  It is for Debian Wheezy, but it should work for Ubuntu.

Or is this a huge no no.\nBasically I need my windows partition to be where the linux one is and vise versa. I am fluent enough to go and do this all on my own. BUT I DO NOT KNOW IF IT WILL EVEN WORK.\nWill this work? Is there already a good tutorial I can follow or should i just go manually copy partitions and move them around?\n\nA: First, assignment of the /dev/sda and /dev/sdb identification is done by the kernel. If both disks are controlled by a single chipset, then typically /dev/sda will be attached to a lower-numbered port than /dev/sdb. (Ports are often numbered on motherboards or at least identified in documentation.) Sometimes BIOS settings can influence which device gets which moniker. If the two are controlled by different chipsets, the assignment will depend on the order in which the two chipsets' drivers register their devices. (This order can vary between boots in some cases.) In the case of removable disks, of course, the order in which they're plugged in can be a factor, too. There are also exceptions to these rules, such as if you explicitly adjust assignments with udev rules, but that's getting into pretty obscure stuff. Note that the rules for what device gets a given assignment have nothing to do with the importance of a device for you or even with where Linux \"lives.\"\nIt's unclear what you mean by a \"primary\" drive, but most likely meanings do not guarantee superior performance. Disk performance is determined mainly by hardware -- ideally the bottleneck will be on the disk platter itself, but it can be in the interface technology or elsewhere. Moving Linux from a spinning hard disk to an SSD is likely to improve its performance. Moving it from one spinning disk to another might or might not improve performance, but to know if it will help you'll need to examine the disks' specification sheets and study the disk controller(s) at your disposal. In many cases you'll get optimal performance by spreading Linux across two or more disks in a RAID or striped LVM setup.\nMoves such as you suggest are certainly possible, but there are a hundred things that can go wrong. Undertake this task only if you have adequate backups!!!! I'm afraid that I don't have a link to a suitable tutorial, although I'm sure something like that must exist somewhere on the Web (and maybe on this very site). It's not a trivial task to undertake, or even to write about, so I can't simply whip up some instructions for you in five minutes. It will involve using any of dozens of data-copying tools, perhaps using a partition resizing tool, and probably re-installing your boot loader.\nI recommend that you first learn more about your disk hardware to be sure that such a change will actually provide you with a real benefit. Certainly you've presented no evidence that this will be the case, so my best recommendation, given what I know of your situation, is to leave it alone -- there's wisdom to the saying don't fix what ain't broken.\n", "Q: How to set-up/enable Fingerprint sensor?

I've been using Linux and Ubuntu for my professional work for years and I've never run into such a difficult (and as yet for me undoable) installation. In fact I dual installed Windows 7 and 12.04 LTS on my Lenovo Thinkpad as quickly and easily as the standard installation guide would have you believe is normal. I'm not a Linux guru by any stretch but I know enough to keep myself out of trouble (or at least if I can't fix it, then fix it so nobody can). I tried the install with CD's and live USBs with 12.04 and 13.10 in all possible combinations. And I have now seen a variety of error messages that I wasn't aware of before. These errors (although cryptic to me) seem to be related to problems with UEFI and possibly the hard drive partitioning. I'll go through typical install as a way of stating my problems:\nAttempt in UEFI mode:\nThe first error message I would see flashed briefly on a black screen (saying something like failed ... /EFI.boot.../efi.boot as best as I can recall) just before the black grub2 UEFI installation or try Ubuntu menu would appear. This error appears every time when using a CD, but strangely didn't appear when using a 12.04 liveUSB.\nFrom here typically I launched the live OS and tried the install from there. From here the installer dialogue indicated that 'this computer currently has no detected OS', indicating for some reason the installer could not see Windows 8.1, which is installed. \nThe laptop has a 1Tb hard drive with the default 5 partitions from Asus. Also, several times when trying to look at my HDD partitions the installer crashed with 'ubuntu part-man failed with exit code 10 ...' (and 141 a different time).  Of cause I didn't go ahead with the install in UEFI mode with all these problems. \nNon UEFI attempt:\nFollowing the instruction guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI  I reset my BIOS as follows:\nSecure Boot  [disabled]\nFast Boot    [disabled]\nCSM mode     [enabled]\n\nI also tried the install with Intel virtualization technology, Intel AES-NI and VT-d, both enabled and disabled (no luck either way). With these changes the install CD brought up the purple grub loader and I was able to complete the installation seemingly with no problem in non-UEFI mode.  I had the problem that the grub boot menu didn't appear and Windows just booted straight up after the Ubuntu install.  I used the boot-repair tool as recommended. One thing I haven't yet mentioned is for some reason, neither the 12.04 or 13.10 install CDs seem to have a driver for the wireless card on the new laptop, so I had to go to the computer store where I bought it and they reluctantly let me use there wired Eth0 so I could complete the boot-repair. This got the Grub2 to screen to load, which allowed me to find the Ubuntu 13.10 installation was broken and just launched to a basic shell screen where machine style error was crash dumping on the screen something like:\n[47x.xxxxxx] nouveau E[PMC] [0000:01:00.0] unknown intr 0X40000000\n\nand requiring a hard shut down to stop the machine.  \nFrom this experience I found out the Asus Backtracker program works well and I've used it to restore my machine to just Windows.

I did create a home and .ssh folder, so not sure about that one, but more annoyed with not being able to login. Also, this happens on port 22 as well.

That would be strange considering I have my mic on unamplified 100% - OFF.\n\nA: As the sound test worked without problems you could try to use a different music player.

Check every drivers installed properly. \n\nA: You could try to find out if a process has a high CPU usage (using 'System Monitor'). This could produce lots of heat.\nIf the heat is produced by your CPU you could try to install 'indicator-cpufreq' and then you could set it to 'powersave'. This would possibly make your computer a bit slower, but should make it less hot.\n\nA: It might be your graphics card. You can try running the command (as root)\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nIt isn't the best permanent solution because it turns your AMD gpu off, but it should help with the heat if that's the source.

The only solution i can think of is to download the most recent releases from the official page. I had this problem with blender, and managed to find a post that had me update the package manually (a pre made one liner). now im attempting to install an android development env. I downloaded the ADT bundle for linux 64 bit, inside was a zip folder. i attempt to run the executable file from the GUI and nothing happens. when i run it from the shell it gives me an error that i believe is related to missing dependencies. so heres the question:\nHow do i properly install a piece of software that does not come in a package intended for use with a software manager?\nby properly i mean i want it installed as if it was installed by a package manager... i want the icons, i want the links in the dashboard, i want the dependencies...\nEDIT\nbefore someone says it, yes i have run \nsudo apt-get install eclipse\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo chmod +x path/to/bin\nsudo path/to/bin\n\nEDIT\n\"Impossible\" = \"Unacceptable\" in my eyes. i want to properly install the latest releases on ubuntu. it is possible? it may be difficult but how do i do it? i have been trying to find answers to this question for a while now and it seems like an industry secret that no one will tell me....\n\nA: To the Eclipse thing:\nTo use the ADT (and to allow Eclipse to use the ADT) in Linux, you have one of two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run 32-bit Ubuntu (bleh)\n\n*Run 64-bit Ubuntu and enable multiarch support (yay!)\n\n\nIf it is not already enabled you can enable multiarch support on Ubuntu by running the following command:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\nOnce this is done, you will need to add the 32 bit libraries you need in order to use the ADT(depending on which Ubuntu you are using):\n# Ubuntu 12.04\napt-get install ia32-libs\n\n# Ubuntu 13.04\nsudo apt-get install libc6-i386 lib32stdc++6 lib32gcc1 lib32ncurses5\n\n# Ubuntu 13.10\nsudo apt-get install libc6-i386 lib32stdc++6 lib32gcc1 lib32ncurses5 lib32z1\n\nIf you want access to the SDK and ADB from a terminal, you need to export the relevant paths in in your .bashrc file:\nsudo nano .bashrc\n\n# At the end of the file add\n\nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/AndroidSDK:$HOME/AndroidSDK/tools\nexport PATH\n\nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/AndroidSDK/platform-tools\nexport PATH\n\nTo create the launcher, you can have a look here.\nTo address one of your comments: \nI am only going to say this about the debate going on here: each operating system has its strengths and weaknesses.  That being said, let's get to the answer.\nWindows requires backwards compatibility (due to the NT kernel and other things).  This means that a Windows installation is larger, but there are very few things that 64 bit Windows can't run, including 32 bit application such as Eclipse and the Android SDK.  This also means that most things work out of the box.  \nLinux requires additional setup because the base installation (even one with a GUI) does not require as many compatibility libraries (in Windows, .dll(s)) in order to function.  This makes for smaller installations that can be targeted to specific hardware.  This also means that you can run Linux on older/less powerful systems (the real goal of Linux, in my mind).  The problem is that additional functionality (such as 32 bit applications in a 64 bit environment) require additional setup.\nOnly a few Linux distros (Arch and Fedora come to mind) have the latest and greatest of software versions in their repos.  This is because most Linux distros are about stability.  I cannot speak for Arch, as I have little experience with it.  However, Fedora is essentially the test bed for RHEL (RedHat Linux Enterprise).  For distros like that, it isn't about stability, it is about testing out what will work on the newest hardware.  It can be a real pain as the user is the one who ends up testing the software (and drivers and libraries and kernels).  This can be real hell.  If you think wasting a few hours trying to get a program to work is terrible, imagine recovering and entire system (and your source code and your data and your sanity) when something untested breaks or melts down.\nDistributions like Ubuntu (LTS in particular) are about stability.  They usually do not include things in the stable repos that have not been thoroughly tested.  This is why things are a little slow on the uptake when it comes to the latest and greatest.  The trade off is you miss out on some of the new features, but you have a stable system.\nYou can install their unstable versions (I think 14.04 is the current testing for Ubuntu), but what was said about Fedora et al. applies. That handles that part of the question (I hope).\n\nA: First of all, different Linux distro's are aimed  differently. For example Gentoo is aimed to become highly customizable OS while LXLE linux is aimed at windows refugees.\nUbuntu aims to be a idiot friendly and elegant looking, simple distro. As such it should be used by following people.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Total Linux noobs.\n  \n*Those who want elegant OS.\n  \n*Those who want an easy to use and large community OS.\n  \n*Ubuntu Fans.\n  \n\nConsidering your needs Arch Linux or Gentoo would be best for you.\n\nUbuntu repositories are famous for being holding ice aged packages, some like Anki which are so old that they don't work anymore. In case you decide to use Ubuntu while having latest softwares, you have following options.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Add ppa repos to your OS which contain latest software. Note that you may have to do this for every individual software.\n  \n*Build from source.Again you have to do this for every software and also resolve dependencies manually.\n  \n\n\nHow do I properly install a piece of software?\nIf you have decided to build from source, all software devs would provide a list of necessary dependencies. Just install those software using apt-get install command.If they don't, either there is no dependency or the devs are so ignorant that their software must be ignored as well.\n\nToo short; Do read\nUse Arch Linux, there's no reason for messing up with Ubuntu to make it behave like Arch.There is no industry secret here, it's just not worth it. \nIt's easier to buy an egg than forcing a chicken to lay one.\n\n", "Q: USB Backup Drive does not show up complete after a successful dd backup I performed a Server Backup (ubuntu 13.10) via dd onto an external USB-Drive.

For example, AMD K7 (Duron™ and Athlon™) are i686.\n\nA: As various posters have said, your kernel is 32-bit. The meaning of i686 deserves a little more explanation, however.\nWhen compiling the Linux kernel (something that end-users don't generally need to do these days - the good people behind Ubuntu supply the kernel ready compiled), there are various options that you can tweak. One important option is CPU feature support.\nAll x86 CPUs are compatible with the original Intel 80386 (abbreviated i386), so if you want a kernel that's compatible with all x86 CPUs, you would compile an i386 kernel.\nHowever, modern CPUs have many additional features (integrated floating point unit, MMX, etc.), which Linux can use if it is configured to do so. As a balance between backwards compatibility and performance, Ubuntu's kernel is compiled with support for the features that were available on the Intel Pentium II (sometimes abbreviated as i686), which is why the kernel shows up as i686.\nThis also partly explains why applications compiled for 64-bit processors are sometimes faster. The i686 first appeared in 1997, and modern processors have many features that were not available on the i686 (SSE, extra registers, etc.), but applications need to be compiled with support for these features, which might break compatibility with older systems. By contrast, x86_64 CPUs first appeared in 2003, so applications can be compiled with support for some of the features introduced between 1997 and 2003, without fear of compatibility issues.\n\nA: Open System Settings, then click on Details.

Checking the load-extra-items at org.gnome.libgnomekbd.desktop (via a.g. dconf-editor \n) should theoretically do the trick. Apparently it was a known bug until a year ago (Option to enable extra keyboard layout is lost Edit). \nUnfortunately it still doesn't work for me. Can anyone help me with some walkaround (I'd like to enable the Polish (international with accents) keyboard layout).\n\nA: The exotic layouts get enabled with the following invocation of gsettings:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources show-all-sources true\n\n\nA: Another possibility is to use Keytouch. Look over the default built ins to see if your keyboard is supported. If not you can download the companion editor if you need more flexibility.  \n\nA: Walkaround:\nFirst we need to learn the identifier of the layout we wish to custom-add to the list. For that we need to peek at the appropriate file in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols. This is two-step procedure: \nFirst we need to find the file that defines the layout we want to apply (e.g. by grep <phrase> * launched from terminal in this directory). Name of the file is the name of the configItem, that we will need later. It will be pl in my case.\nThen we open this file in editor and find the beginning of the block defining our desired layout. It has a form like xkb_symbols \"intl\" {, where intl is the identifier of the layout. \nKnowing it, we need to gksudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml, and find the beginning of the configItem item. In it there will be a list of already defined layuts (variants). We need to insert our own, using one of the existing ones as a template; it would be \n    <variant>\n      <configItem>\n        <name>intl</name>\n        <description>Polish (international with dead keys)</description>\n      </configItem>\n    </variant>\n\nin my example. \nAlthough the name of the layout will be available in the Ubuntu's settings manager immediately, we need to reboot (or maybe: logout, login?) for the new layout to really start working.\n\nBy the way, the described layout looks promising for power users, and it is available with \"latin\" variant, which is compatible with other languages then Polish. It is 100% compatible with already-present engravings on most keyboards, and features funny and easy to remember layout for extra commonly used symbols. See the whole rationale in this PDF. \n", "Q: File Recovery and System Repair My staging server, an Ubuntu 13.04, crashed and I need to recover some web files.

I've written a machine vision processing algorithm on an embedded board which is going to be installed in the outdoor environment. The embedded system consists of an Intel Atom Dual Core processor which clocks at 1.8 GHZ and has 4 GB of RAM.\nMy algorithm needs Qt and OpenCV to be installed on the operating system to run properly.\nCan installing Lubuntu instead of Ubuntu help in decreasing the processing time of my program? For example, could I have a 20% or more reduction in my algorithm processing time by just replacing Ubuntu with Lubuntu? If yes, how could it be measured before installing Lubuntu on my embedded board?\nI want to know if there's a huge reduction by just removing some fancy features of Ubuntu since I'm not going to use them at all. If not, I don't want to bother my self installing Lubuntu and perform all the tests again.\n\nA: Rather than Lubuntu, I would suggest you to use Xubuntu, which is even lighter.Strip it down by unintaliing all unnecessary softwares like maybe transmission bittorrent client.\n If you are more experienced user, get something very light like TCL and install only necessary software.\nConsidering that you install Stripped down Xubuntu and also taking in mind your system specs, it would surely give a performance boost compared to Ubuntu(stripped or not stripped). But it may or may not be 20%, depending on what you do.\nDoes your setup use something like 80% CPU? Then the gain would be higher.I think you should try Xubuntu(strip it), if you have time to do it. Using Ubuntu for your system is a lot of unnecessary wastage.\n\nA: The generic answer is Yes it could. But only testing it will tell you for sure. I have an Atom dual core board with 2 GB of RAM that run Ubuntu on and I never go for full blown Unity or Gnome desktop environment on it. I prefer Lubuntu or LXDE and I install stripped down versions of them (without bloatware). \nTry this:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends lubuntu-desktop\n\nOr if you want raw LXDE then this:\nsudo apt-get install lxde-core\n\nOr for a stripped down version of Gnome 3 use this:\nsudo apt-get install xorg gnome-core gnome-system-tools gnome-app-install\n\nOr if you want to stick to Unity (not recommended) then use this:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends ubuntu-desktop\n\nMy opinion is that you will see that LXDE or Lubuntu will help. But like Aditya mentioned, Xubuntu is also good. You may either of them and optionally include the --no-install-recommends modifier. \n\nA: Let me suggest another approach here. \nIt appears that your embedded system may not need a desktop at all. Rather than installing an Ubuntu desktop version to remove all unwanted components I'd go the other way and install Ubuntu server edition to then add all I need for my application to run. By this we will be able to control all processes which may interact with your application, and we will be able to control the ressources which should be left for our application.\nIt also may not really make much difference what desktop environment processes are idle in the background. Just imagine our process starting at boot before any user log ins. Then the desktop environment is not even running, hence not using any ressources. This can be done with any Ubuntu derivative, differences will then be more of what application are installed.\nIn any case we can nicely adjust process prority to give our application a high priority. \n", "Q: getting highest value in files and storing the next values as per desired count let us say i have counter, which is variable.

What I want to do is to install Ubuntu to 15 GB partition which I made using Disk Management Utility. And I want it to dual boot to Windows/Ubuntu whenever I want.\nIs this possible ? I previously installed it alongside with windows, but the problem with that was it automatically made a 250 GB partition out of one of my 600 GB partition and installed Ubuntu on that partition. I want to allocate only 15 GB to ubuntu as I will be using it for tasks like programming only, and will use Windows 8 as my primary OS. Also I don't want to install it on VM.\n\nA: Using the standard Windows disk partitioning tool to create partitions for Linux is risky at best. There are several problems with this tool, but the biggest for your scenario is that, when you create a layout that holds more than four partitions, it will convert the disk into one that uses the Logical Disk Manager (LDM, aka \"dynamic disks\"). At least, that's true on MBR disks; I'm not sure if the same happens when using GPT disks, which a computer that ships with Windows 8 probably uses. LDM is a Microsoft-specific technology, and installing Linux to an LDM disk is either very difficult or not possible -- certainly I've never heard of anybody doing it. When people are hit by this problem, they typically end up using third-party tools to convert back from LDM to a standard configuration. There are other problems with the Windows disk partitioner, too; depending on the version, there are known bugs that can create illegal partition layouts, which of course cause their own headaches.\nA better way to accomplish your goal is to use the \"Something Else\" installation option, as described here:\n\"Install alongside\" option missing. How do I install Ubuntu beside Windows using \"Something Else\"?\nThis will enable Ubuntu to do the partitioning, but under your control. This way, you won't risk a disastrous outcome should Windows decide to convert your disk to an LDM setup or otherwise mess up the partitioning.\n", "Q: How to install pulseaudio 5 on Ubuntu Guys how i can install pulseaudio 5? i don't understand the installation step on this link\nhttp://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/multimedia/pulseaudio.html\nanybody can tell me how to install it ?\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 is a bit old to install PulseAudio 5, even 14.04 will ship PulseAudio 4, see the dedicated package page.\nIf you really need the latest version, I would rely on the PulseAudio testing ppa, which provides a properly packaged version of PulseAudio 5 for 14.04:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/pulse-testing\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio\n\n\nA: Well every thing is described well on the link you've provided.

So you can continously work on the same PC?\n\nA: As of Natty you can not. Is was dropped due to flaws that could not be addressed and because hibernation/suspend actually does this better.  \nFrom the announcement:\n\nHey fellow desktop lovers,\nHere is a notice on what we decided during the Rally: we drop session\n  saving from natty in Ubuntu. The disablement is already effective in\n  natty.\nWhat was the option about?\nThe option was about launching on session start, the applications\n  which were running when you close your session, and getting them in\n  the exact same state than when they were closed.\nIt was available through gnome-session-properties in a dedicated tab.\n  It was possible to choose there to save right now all opened\n  applications or to do that everytime on session close.\nWhy removing it?\nWe saw a lot of side effects during the previous cycles when we\n  started to use multiples session (like in UNE, desktop session and\n  such):\n  - the saved applications contains the list of all running application, including the window manager, the panel and such… Consequently, we got\n  a lot of patches and hack to avoid saving mutter, compiz, metacity,\n  and the panels in lucid and maverick, so that when someone wanted to\n  start a session, the required components from the session will indeed\n  been launched instead of the saved one.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*We tried last week to change the desktop order but it went quite wrong with a lot of settings and we had to revert it.\n  \n*In addition to that, session saving never really worked with all the default applications we have (for instance, openoffice, firefox…) and\n  even with supported applications like gedit: the opened documents\n  weren't started again, making the feature quite useless.\nAnd now?\nAs there is no strong intend to solve that in the short term and we\n  need to focus on other parts of the desktop area first, we decided\n  than instead of shipping a broken feature (there was already a lot of\n  side effects people using this feature encountered that cycle, and\n  time to debug it, to find it was coming from a saved session was quite\n  expensive…) to unable it for natty. With that, it will enable us to\n  ensure a first class experience in natty on the ubuntu desktop,\n  without getting a lot of upgrade failures and people rebooting getting\n  a blank background.\nI still personally think that this feature can be really good addition\n  to Ubuntu default experience if we can take time to make it very\n  polished as well as working for most of - if not all - major\n  applications (at least, all applications by default on the CD). If\n  someone wants to jump in this hard and long task, he's more than\n  welcome to discuss it either on this mailing list or in the #ubuntu-desktop channel on freenode.\nThanks for your attention, \nDidier Roche\n\n", "Q: Broadcom card-reader BCM57765/BCM57785 doesn't work on ubuntu `12.04 LTS I'm having a hard time with this one.

After a fresh install, it's OK to restore the backup files over any new files that may have been created. However, you will need to manually reinstall any (non-standard) applications that were installed on your old disk. There are ways to accomplish this easily as well, but since you asked about data, not applications, I won't go into that.\nOnce reinstalled, applications will (as a rule) use the old restored data in /home.\nUsing rsync is quite simple, so if you're comfortable with that, go ahead. DejaDup just gives you the GUI. You won't want to use sudo though, in order to preserve file ownership.\nGenerally, backing up and restoring NTFS disks is OK, although there may be some glitches when using filenames with special characters. You will need to experiment a bit with the iocharset parameter in /etc/fstab before you get that right.\n", "Q: Android Device Manager doesn't show emulated device on Ubuntu 12.04 In the android AVD Manager (eclipse or android studio, doesn't matter) I can create a device, but when I want to start it the AVD manager loads and nothing happens.\nDid anybody know what could be the problem?\n\nA: okay after weeks, i finally find the answer to my problem:\nIts from https://stackoverflow.com/a/22712342/3477946\nOn Ubuntu 14.04 64bit with a NVidia graphics card I had to do the following:\nInstall the SDK and ADT plugin for Eclipse\nInstall 32-bit libraries:\nsudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1\nInstall OpenGL libraries:\nsudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev\n\nInstall proprietary drivers for the graphics card: \nSystem Settings > Software & Updates > Additional Drivers NVIDIA binary driver version 331.38\n\nFrom Eclipse (>in my case android studio/<) , run the Android Virtual Device Manager and edit a device.

Then run\nfor i in $( </path/to/target_names tr -d ',' ); do cp grey.png ${i}; done\n\nInstead of copying, which will multiply the size required by the number of new files, you could use using symlinks instead, where each new file references the original file, without copying it.\nfor i in $( </path/to/target_names tr -d ',' ); do ln -s grey.png ${i}; done\n\nN.B. that if you use symlinks, you won't be able to change the relative paths of the original and the targets later. i.e. they will have to stay in the same directory.

I understand that there might be some devs here and experts so could any one write a tutorial for serious noobs it would help me and all the new people starting to use linux.\nAlso i wonder why ubuntu devs do not integrate Wine into the OS ?.\n\"Sorry for my english and also if i had asked a question that already had been answered as i didn't find any of them fit to work for my laptop, i bricked the OS multiple times\"\nP.S i also always get an error when i boot the OS and unity shows.\n\nA: Wine stands for windows emulator. The reason it is not integrated into the OS is that people do not use ubuntu to run windows applications. If you browse the software centre, you can find that there are replacements for every application that you use on windows.\nWine cannot run every windows game on linux no matter how long you wait. Waiting for steam would be a better option. There already some linux games released for steam.\nNvidia optimus is not supported on linux for the time being - thanks to Nvidia.

It throws an error on downloading the current agent. \nI´ve tried to do some apt-get on the node01. Works just fine.

The vCloud only NATs Machines with an IP Address. Because of the lack of VMware Tools on the deployed MAAS Nodes VMware couldn't determent the IP Address and therefor NATing wasn't enabled for those machines. apt-get worked because of the squid proxy installed on the MAAS.\nWorkaround: I created a new virtual router and set it as the gateway for the MAAS nodes.

How can I can I fix this since I only have one OS?\nAlso can I remove the fat32 partition and unknown partition? Can I use my unallocated space?\nThank you very much.\n\nA: I don't know about removing the unallocated partitions, but they don't seem to be taking a lot of space anyway. But if you removed the ones having Windows installed, you just need to update your boot manager so it detects that there's not Windows anymore.\nOpen a terminal and execute this:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis should probe the partitions for installed O.S. and detect your Ubuntu installation.\n", "Q: Are reboots required after updates?

My dynamically growing virtual disks (VDI) from various Ubuntu installations in Virtual Box are actually steadily \"growing\" indeed.\nDeleting of files in the virtual machine does not free the space my VDI file took from the host hard disk space.\nHow do I shrink these files to give the unused hard disk space back to the host?\n\nA: A dynamically growing Virtual Box virtual hard drive file is capable of growing on demand of the virtual machine up to the maximum size we defined in setting up this file. It does not however free the space of files we deleted in the guest OS.\nIn case the disk had grown too much we can compact it again, provided the unused space is filled with zeros, and the drive is in VDI format.\nFor an ext2 to ext 4 filesystem this can be done from the Ubuntu guest with the command line utility zerofree   * .\nzerofree /dev/sdxX\n\nThis needs the drive to not be in use, and to be unmounted. We therefore may have to bind it temporarily to another VM we had created for this purpose, or we need to boot an Ubuntu live environment on this VM. \nReplace /dev/sdxX with the ext2, ext3 or ext4 formatted partition in question.\nOn more than one partition we my have to repeat zerofree for each partition. Keep in mind that by filling with zeros the virtual file will temporarily grow up to it's maximum size.\nOnce all unused drive space is filled with zeros we then shrink the drive with\nVBoxManage modifyhd <name>.vdi --compact\n\nThis will considerably decrease the file size of our VDI file.\n* In a Windows guest we can replace unused space with the utility sdelete. \n\nA: Here are some alternative ways to zero the free disk space (which can be the most time-consuming part). Afterwards, you will still have to run VBoxManage modifyhd <disk> --compact to compact the actual disk file.\n\nThis command can zero the disk while it is unmounted:\n\napt-get install zerofree\nzerofree -v /dev/sdxN\n\n\nHere's an example of how to get dd to periodically print output:\n\ndd if=/dev/zero of=temp-file-on-disk bs=20M\n\n# run this to get the process ID of the dd command\npgrep -l '^dd$'\n# then put the process ID on the command line to \"kill -USR1\"\n# this will tell dd to print the current status (in another terminal)\nkill -USR1 $(pgrep -l '^dd$' | awk '{print $1}')\n\n\nHere's a dd-like program that will automatically print output periodically:\n\napt-get install dcfldd\ndcfldd if=/dev/zero of=temp-file-on-disk bs=20M\n\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu to multiple PC's via HDD cloning Our school will finally be moving on to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS from XP (most probably). There will be a pilot run on ~40 PCs with same hardware. So what would be the best (and least time consuming) way to install Ubuntu to these computers? We want a fully configured Ubuntu which should be identical on each computer.\nThe present steps we are considering:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Clonezilla: Install Ubuntu on one hard disk, install apps, configure it and then use Clonezilla to clone the hard disks.  Concerns: Disk UUID's, their behaviour on same network (same hostnames).\n\n*Use Remastersys: Make a fresh installation, install apps, configure it and use Remastersys to create a full-backup type installation ISO and then install it on all PCs to get fully configured PCs  Concerns: Will it really work (in theory it should), time consuming, too many steps involved.\nAll PCs will be identical, even their usernames so perms are not an issue. Please suggest some better way to do this. \nNote: Not all PCs are on network so network installation is not an option.\nPlease help as it is a make it or break it situation for the deployment of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I would suggest using a bootable sector based cloning tool or a file based tool that can backup the mbr, but I can't recommend any specific tools as I haven't had such a need in years. I used to use something free made by EaseUS. \nI'm not familiar enough with hostnames to address your networking concerns. \nThe options you've listed will both work, but there are some things to bear in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remastersys doesn't support UEFI\n\n*Remastersys is no longer updated and as such may or may not work with 14.04 (worked fine for me on 13.10).\n\n*Remastersys won't include any graphics drivers you install (eg fglrx).\n\n*There is a size limit imposed on the squashfs file when using remastersys. I think the max size for the compressed squashfs is 4gb, but don't quote me on that. It sounds small but squashfs gets great compression.\n\n*Clonezilla doesn't clone grub2 from the mbr, it re-installs it. \nRegarding your concerns:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clonezilla will set the proper UUID when writing.\n\n*Remastersys is easier to use than clonezilla in my mind, assuming you use the gui.\n\nA: The way I do it now is to use clonezilla as you suggest but then reinstall ubuntu on the clone this time choosing the option to retain the files on the existing copy of ubuntu.\nIt works but it takes a long time.\n", "Q: System performance is extremely laggy when copying and extracting files After a clean install of Ubuntu Gnome 13.10 (64-bit) and the according Gnome 3 (stable) PPA my system (Samsung 900X3C) is extremely laggy, when files are copied to the external hard-drive (HDD) or archives are extracted on my SSD (Crucial M4 mSATA 256 GB).

I'd set, for example:\nCPU_SCALING_MIN_FREQ_ON_BAT=782000\nCPU_SCALING_MAX_FREQ_ON_BAT=1300000\n\nfor all cores.\nb) I'd set \nSATA_LINKPWR_ON_BAT=medium_power\n\nand test again.\nc) Also, using gnome-disks (the \"Disks\" application) try enabling Write Cache: select your HDD, click the gear icon on top right, select Drive Settings, and enable there.\nThere are some more things to do I am sure...good luck.\n", "Q: Website not running on Ubuntu after installing LAMP Stack I did it... I moved to Ubuntu today for the first time. I've been loyal to Windows for quite a while, but here I am. Anyway, I'm not used to all the command line tools and I'm facing some trouble with some essential parts of my work in this new environment.\nI have installed the LAMP Stack via these commands:\n$ sudo apt-get install tasksel\n$ sudo tasksel install lamp-server\n\nNow I have the latest PHP, Apache, MySQL. I've also installed phpMyAdmin to this group via:\n$sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin\n\nI have created a file on var/www with a simple phpinfo() and it's working alright. However, when I've loaded my project into a new directory inside var/www - I'm getting nothing back. Just a blank white page.\nMy website has been working correctly on Windows via XAMPP and it is also running fine on my VPS online, but here on my new system... Nothing.\nWhat could be wrong with my configuration? How can I debug this issue?\nI need my website working locally so I can continue my work here.\n\nA: It appears that my files were not accessible after copying them over from a Windows system to Ubuntu. Having this said, I had to modify the permissions of my project directory to 766. I did this with the following command:\nchmod -R 766 /My/Directory/Path/\n\nAfter this my files were showing up normally in the web browser.\n", "Q: compression setting for log files in /var/log For the log files in /var/log,\nit appears that the wtmp and also the rotated wtmp.n are not ASCII file and can only be read by the last command, so if they are compressed, one has to first uncompress them and then use last -f ... to read. The other compressed log files can be easily read using an editor such as emacs since they are ASCII text files. \nIs there a way to set \"compress\" for all other logs files except the wtmp.n? \n(I assume that if one uncomments the #compress in the /etc/logrotate.conf, \n# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed\n#compress\n\nthen all log files will be compressed, including the wtmp.) \nThanks\n\nA: /var/log/wtmp is not a text file but it's not compressed either. It's a binary file and to decode it you need a dedicated tool called rawtmp available with the sac package.\nsudo apt-get install sac\n\nTo access wtmp logs, type in a terminal:\nrawtmp | less\n\nOr to decode the first wtmp archive:\nrawtmp -w /var/log/wtmp.1 | less\n\nEDIT: To override logrotate compression settings for wtmp you just need to edit the /etc/logrotate.conf file:\nsudo gedit /etc/logrotate.conf\n\nTo add the nocompress directive:\n/var/log/wtmp {\n    nocompress\n    missingok\n    monthly\n    create 0664 root utmp\n    rotate 12\n}\n\nFrom logrotate man page:\n   nocompress\n          Old versions of log files are not compressed.

You can run kill 3038 to kill the process running the tab, but note that the tab itself will still be open (but the content will be replaced with a blue screen).\n\nA: If you don’t want to see “Google Chrome didn't shut down correctly. To repoen ...”, then it is important to signal only the root of the chrome process tree, like so:\npkill --oldest chrome\n\nSee full explanation. wmctrl -c (great program) only works with some window managers like Unity, and it only closes one window at a time so you would need a loop.\n\nA: You can stop all of them with a single command:\nsudo killall chrome\n\nThen to prevent it from doinng this in the future, go into Settings, pick Advanced, and near the bottom you will find a switch where you can set it to NOT allow background processes to run when the program exits.  Shut it off.\n\nA: As another option without using the command line is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Show Applications > System Monitor \n\n*Go to the process name chrome\n\n*Right click on it and choose End (or Kill)\n\n", "Q: How to partition for a successfull boot with raid5 + lvm +encryption I have been trying to make this setup work for several days.\nThe system never boots... When I do a setup without the software raid I can get it to work.\nHow should I set up my system partition to be able to boot with either legacy Bios or UEFI?\nAnother mysterious thing is that I can not directly set up raid 5 with all my discs, I need to do a small partition in the beginning of every disk at first. If I do not do this, there will be one \"raid\" partition on every disc but no raid volume with 2/3 of the total amount of storage space.\n\nA: For bios booting, you just need one raid partition on each disk, unless the disks are larger than 2 TiB, in which case you must use GPT instead of msdos partition tables.  In that cause you have to create a 1 MiB bios_grub partition on each disk you want to install grub to ( preferably all of them ).\nFor EFI, you need to use GPT no matter the size of the disk, and create an EFI system partition and mount it in /boot/grub/efi.\n", "Q: Xampp Control Panel Can Not Launch After searching all over the WWW, I couldn't solve my problem.\nI want to launch Xampp via desktop control panel and also I made the xampp-control-panel.desktop in desktop and ~/.local/share/applications/ paths with the text below but no answer:\n[Desktop Entry]  \nEncoding=UTF-8  \nName=Xampp Control Panel  \nComment=Start or Stop XAMPP  \nExec=gksudo python /opt/lampp/share/xampp-control-panel/xampp-control-panel.py  \nIcon=/opt/lampp/htdocs/favicon.ico  \nCategories=Application;Development;Web  \nVersion=1.0  \nType=Application  \nTerminal=0    \n\nI typed the command below:  \ngksudo python /opt/lampp/share/xampp-control-panel/xampp-control-panel.py  \n\nthe answer was:   \nError importing pygtk2 and pygtk2-libglade  \n\nand then I tried:  \ngksudo apt-get install python-glade2  \n\nand eventually when I click on xampp icon my administration password will be asked and when I type it nothing happens.\nWhat can I do to get the control panel working?\n\nA: First of all the xampp folder is /opt/lampp so if you want to create some php files you need to put them in /opt/lampp/htdocs.

Installing from a booted version, will involve re-partitioning your hard drive, which could result in a loss of data. \nUbuntu, like Windows and OSX, is an operating system, and requires software compiled for it specifically to run. A vast majority of what you do on your windows machine will also be supported by Ubuntu, however not all will.\nWine is an install-able windows emulator package that allows yo to run windows specific applications.\n\nA: You don't have to install Ubuntu \"over\" Windows. You can install it along with it. Everything will work as is does now AND you will be able to choose to boot into Ubuntu (or your old Windows) immediately after booting up your computer.\n\nA: I think that the best OS is ubuntu its a lot less cluttered and you can change it to your liking. Also it has some great programs that windows might not have. However ubuntu can be problematic at times (thats why we have ask ubuntu ) I would recommend Unity as your first OS\n\nA: As I myself am a relatively new ubuntu user (I started to use it in 2011), I might not be the first person to list the benefits of this OS, but ill give you the main reason why I chose, and have stayed with this OS for a couple of years now. Ubuntu is just a lot cleaner than Windows. \n\n\n*\n\n*The screen space is not filled with pointless text and icons.\n\n*It seems that everything that is not always necessary is hidden until you need it.\n\n", "Q: Make Ubuntu acknowledge that a custom built version of PHP is installed I'm trying to install PHP from source code on my Ubuntu 12.04 VPS.

Do I have to change something in the configure process? Do I have to install PHP5 using the apt-get manner first, remove it manually, and install my own version of PHP after.\nIt is worth mentioning that I need this custom PHP build to make Pthreads work since there isn't a repo that offers a ZTS version of PHP (yet, please make one, somebody?).\n\nA: This is a problem when your compile from source or install a package outside of apt (apt-get).\nProbably the easiest solution is to use checkinstall\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n\nThen make and install php\nmake\nsudo checkinstall\n\ncheckinstall creates a .deb from your source code, then installs a .deb, so apt will then acknowledge php is installed.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall\n\nA: Don't tell Ubuntu anything.  Instead, install into a different directory than where Ubuntu package management operates.\nThis is what /usr/local and /opt are for.

I assume you're saying you installed 8.1 after Ubuntu? What version of Ubuntu are you running?\nIf you have another computer available, try hitting \"e\" while Ubuntu is highlighted in your GRUB screen.

As of today, a bug in OpenSSL has been found affecting versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive) and 1.0.2-beta.\nSince Ubuntu 12.04, we are all vulnerable to this bug. In order to patch this vulnerability, affected users should update to OpenSSL 1.0.1g.\nHow can every affected user apply this update now?\n\nA: The bug is known as Heartbleed.\nAm I vulnerable?\nGenerally, you're affected if you run some server that you generated an SSL key for at some point. Most end-users are not (directly) affected; at least Firefox and Chrome don't use OpenSSL. SSH is not affected. The distribution of Ubuntu packages isn't affected (it relies on GPG signatures).\nYou are vulnerable if you run any kind of server that uses OpenSSL versions 1.0–1.0.1f (except of course versions that were patched since the bug was discovered). The affected Ubuntu versions are 11.10 oneiric through 14.04 trusty pre-releases. It's an implementation bug, not a flaw in the protocol, so only programs that use the OpenSSL library are affected. If you have a program linked against the old 0.9.x version of OpenSSL, it isn't affected. Only programs that use the OpenSSL library to implement the SSL protocol are affected; programs that use OpenSSL for other things are not affected.\nIf you ran a vulnerable server exposed to the Internet, consider it compromised unless your logs show no connection since the announcement on 2014-04-07. (This assumes that the vulnerability wasn't exploited before its announcement.)  If your server was only exposed internally, whether you need to change the keys will depend on what other security measures are in place.\nWhat is the impact?\nThe bug allows any client who can connect to your SSL server to retrieve about 64kB of memory from the server. The client doesn't need to be authenticated in any way. By repeating the attack, the client can dump different parts of the memory in successive attempts.\nOne of the critical pieces of data that the attacker may be able to retrieve is the server's SSL private key. With this data, the attacker can impersonate your server.\nHow do I recover on a server?\n\n\n*\n\n*Take all affected servers offline. As long as they're running, they're potentially leaking critical data.\n\n*Upgrade the libssl1.0.0 package, and make sure that all affected servers are restarted.\nYou can check if affected processes are still running with ``grep 'libssl.(deleted)' /proc//maps`\n\n*Generate new keys. This is necessary because the bug might have allowed an attacker to obtain the old private key. Follow the same procedure you used initially.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use certificates signed by a certification authority, submit your new public keys to your CA. When you get the new certificate, install it on your server.\n\n*If you use self-signed certificates, install it on your server.\n\n*Either way, move the old keys and certificates out of the way (but don't delete them, just ensure they aren't getting used any more).\n\n\n*Now that you have new uncompromised keys, you can bring your server back online.\n\n*Revoke the old certificates.\n\n*Damage assessment: any data that has been in the memory of a process serving SSL connections may potentially have been leaked. This can include user passwords and other confidential data. You need to evaluate what this data may have been.  \n\n\n*\n\n*If you're running a service that allows password authentication, then the passwords of users who connected since a little before the vulnerability was announced should be considered compromised. (A little before, because the password may have remained unused in memory for a while.) Check your logs and change the passwords of any affected user.\n\n*Also invalidate all session cookies, as they may have been compromised.\n\n*Client certificates are not compromised.\n\n*Any data that was exchanged since a little before the vulnerability may have remained in the memory of the server and so may have been leaked to an attacker.\n\n*If someone has recorded an old SSL connection and retrieved your server's keys, they can now decrypt their transcript. (Unless PFS was ensured — if you don't know, it wasn't.)\n\n\n\nHow do I recover on a client?\nThere are only few situations in which client applications are affected. The problem on the server side is that anyone can connect to a server and exploit the bug. In order to exploit a client, three conditions must be met:\n\n\n*\n\n*The client program used a buggy version the OpenSSL library to implement the SSL protocol.\n\n*The client connected to a malicious server. (So for example, if you connected to an email provider, this isn't a concern.) This had to happen after the server owner became aware of the vulnerability, so presumably after 2014-04-07.\n\n*The client process had confidential data in memory that wasn't shared with the server. (So if you just ran wget to download a file, there was no data to leak.)\n\n\nIf you did that between 2014-04-07 evening UTC and upgrading your OpenSSL library, consider any data that was in the client process's memory to be compromised.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*The Heartbleed Bug (by one of the two teams who independently discovered the bug)\n\n*How exactly does the OpenSSL TLS heartbeat (Heartbleed) exploit work?\n\n*Does Heartbleed mean new certificates for every SSL server?\n\n*Heartbleed: What is it and what are options to mitigate it?\n\nA: To see which OpenSSL version is installed on Ubuntu run:\ndpkg -l | grep openssl\n\nIf you see the following version output, patch for CVE-2014-0160 should be included.\nii  openssl      1.0.1-4ubuntu5.12      Secure Socket Layer (SSL)...\n\nLooking at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1-4ubuntu5.12, it shows which kind of bugs are fixed:\n...\n SECURITY UPDATE: memory disclosure in TLS heartbeat extension\n    - debian/patches/CVE-2014-0160.patch: use correct lengths in\n      ssl/d1_both.c, ssl/t1_lib.c.\n    - CVE-2014-0160\n -- Marc Deslauriers <email address hidden>   Mon, 07 Apr 2014 15:45:14 -0400\n...\n\n\nA: If your apt-get repositories don't contains any precompiled 1.0.1g OpenSSL version, so just download sources from official website and compile it.\nBelow the single command line to compiling and install the last openssl version.\ncurl https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1g.tar.gz | tar xz && cd openssl-1.0.1g && sudo ./config && sudo make && sudo make install\nReplace old openssl binary file by the new one via a symlink.\nsudo ln -sf /usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl `which openssl`\n\nYou are all good !\n# openssl version should return\nopenssl version\nOpenSSL 1.0.1g 7 Apr 2014\n\nCf this blog post.\nNB: As stated in the blog post, this workaround will not fix \"Nginx and Apache server who have to be recompile with 1.0.1g openSSL sources.\"\n\nA: Security updates are available for 12.04, 12.10, 13.10 and 14.04 see Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2165-1. \nSo first you need to apply the available security updates, for example by running\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nfrom the command line.\nDo not forget to restart the services (HTTP, SMTP, etc.) that use the affected OpenSSL version, otherwise you are still vulnerable.

It will also give the description what exactly each shortcut does. Thanks to Sparhawk who enlightened me to find the solution. What I needed was to learn the use of regular expressions although I'm still not good in it :)\n\nSo here is the one line command:\n\nman bash | grep \"(.-.*)$\" -A1\n\n\nHere is a small extraction of the output:\n\n   beginning-of-line (C-a)\n          Move to the start of the current line.\n   end-of-line (C-e)\n          Move to the end of the line.\n   forward-char (C-f)\n          Move forward a character.\n   backward-char (C-b)\n          Move back a character.\n   forward-word (M-f)\n          Move forward to the end of the next word.

This is an incremental search.\n   forward-search-history (C-s)\n          Search forward starting at the current line and moving `down' through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.\n\n\nNow to save the shortcuts to a file:\n\nman bash | grep \"(.-.*)$\" -A1 > bash_shortcuts\n\nThat's all I needed. I just wanted to know the shortcut keys assigned to bash and I've not reconfigured any keys as BroSlow asked me.\nOnce again thanks to all for their contributions.\nNote:\nIf someone wants to enhance this, he/she is most welcomed. I've only mentioned the way to list those shortcuts which have been assigned by some keys. So if someone knows how to list those actions which have not been assigned with the description using this way, is most welcomed :)\n\nA: As long as the bash manual is not modified in a way to make this command improper(which is not very likely), the following command will show all default shortcuts for bash.\nman bash | grep -A294 'Commands for Moving'\n\nThis gives an output which looks like:\n Commands for Moving\n   beginning-of-line (C-a)\n          Move to the start of the current line.\n   end-of-line (C-e)\n          Move to the end of the line.\n   forward-char (C-f)\n          Move forward a character.\n   backward-char (C-b)\n          Move back a character.\n   forward-word (M-f)\n          Move forward to the end of the next word.

As you may or may not know, this game is quite old and the creators, LucasArts, have only made versions for Mac and Windows. However, fortunately, a few years ago the game's source code was released, and the OpenJk project was born. Essentially they are rewriting the games code, and have made it so that you can play the game on linux, without wine, as smoothly as it plays on other operating systems.\nLink to GitHub page.\nThe compilation and everything worked absolutely fine, and there is nothing wrong with OpenJK as far as I know, and I know people who use it in linux, my problem appears to be SDL2. Or rather, my apparent lack of it.\nWhen I try to execute the file that should start the game, I get this error:\n./openjk.x86_64: error while loading shared libraries: libSDL2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nWell, as far as I know I do have SDL2, having done this:\nsudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0\n\nand this\nsudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev\n\nAlso, I have visited several sites with guides on installing this, and have installed a ridiculous amount of dependencies for SDL2. SO I presume I have them all. If you think you may have found a list I have not, feel free to post it below for me to try.\nAnd, as a final step before I went ahead and posted this question, I downloaded the most recent sdl2.tar.gz from the website, extracted the files, and ran:\n./autogen.sh\n./configure; make; sudo make install\n\nAnd the installation worked, so this left me even more confused after I ran\nsudo ldconfig\n\nand still the Jedi Academy file returned the same error.\nUnfortunately, it seems like the SDL2 I have is not good enough for Jedi Academy, and therefore is not good enough for me ):\nDoes anyone know what the root of the problem is here? Is it with OpenJK, or with SDL2, or do I need to get a different version perhaps? Any thoughts or help would be greatly appreciated, as I am at a loss.\n\nA: This is not the right way to do it, but there are no other answers, and this worked for me. I've always had similar problems locating SDL libs. It helped me to find out where are the libraries installed.\nLast time I installed libsdl2-dev, apt-get said (in /var/lib/dpkg/info/libsdl2-dev.list) that the *.so where:\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSDL2.so\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSDL2-2.0.so\n\nUsually, programs using SDL will search in /usr/lib/ or /usr/local/lib/, so you can try copying it in those paths and renaming it to libSDL2.so.0, which is the name openjk doesn't find.\nOr a symlink:\nln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSDL2.so /usr/lib/libSDL2.so.0\nln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSDL2.so /usr/local/lib/libSDL2.so.0\n\n\nA: I don't know if this is resolved or not, but same problem occured to me today. It turned out that for some reason the MBII launcher needed a 32-bit libraries of SDL2, so apt-get install libsdl-2.0-0:i386 did the work for me.\n", "Q: In what way are doc, info, man, help different?

Examples are licenses, tutorials, examples etc.\n\n*Info\n\nWiki on Texinfo\nGNU textinfo page\nmanpage for the info command \n\nThis command is invoked as\ninfo utility/function/program\n\nwhich will show the texinfo page for utility in info format.\n\n*Man\n\nWiki on man page.\nmanpage for the man command \n\nIt is invoked as \nman utility/function/program\n\nThis one is similar to info, but it has sections(1 to 9) and shows some colourful information.Unlike info, many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user. Note that man may have less information than info.\n\n*Help\n\nWiki on help \n\nIt displays information about builtin commands in bash.It is very short description of the function/command.More on help in help help\n", "Q: Why do I see a \"Firefox\" button on Firefox 28? I noticed that recently the \"Firefox\" button appears again in my Firefox 28, even with Global Menu installed. This is really back or is something wrong with my Firefox on Ubuntu 13.10?\n\n\n\nA: Disable all Ubuntu extensions and restart Firefox, then you can disable the Firefox button (enable the \"menu bar\" by right clicking on the tabs bar) and enable the extensions again.\n", "Q: Manual time syncing Is there a command or some option in KDE environment with which I can manually sync system's time and date with a time server (eg Public Time Server (pool.ntp.org))?\n\nA: Yes.

You are advised to unmount them manually.\n\nHow to go about?\n\nA: To resize/move partitions, the best way is to boot from LiveCD/LiveUSB. Then use Gparted to manage partitions. You might need to install it, so do sudo apt-get install gparted.\nThere is a way to unmount your root partition on running system but I advise you not to do it because it is risky for your data.\n\nA: You can't unmount it, because it's being used. From the error message, /dev/sda1 is the location of your root directory /. Instead, create a gparted live CD, then boot from that.

I want to completely remove the Ubuntu and reinstall windows with entire capacity of my Hard Disc available to me with only one OS i.e Windows. Can you help?\n\nA: If you simply reinstall windows, then the Grub will disappear, and in the beginning when you specify where to install, you can delete the ubuntu partitions.\n(ubuntu partitions are not seen in windows, just in partitoning programs)\nHowever, if your problem is, that you lost your password, you can simply enter in grub on \"recovery mode\", go to \"root shell\", type \npasswd <username>\n\nand enter the new root password (where  is your username). \nThis will be the new password for your user!\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Both can erase your entire Hard Disc and then install the chosen OS.\nWith the advantage for Ubuntu, that lets you boot from the live DVD or Flash Drive and save your files.\n", "Q: Editing keyboard layout In /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols keyboard layout files,\nhow can I edit the 102nd key, that is usually next to left shift?

I am not sure but I think I have to give the super user permission like su or sudo before the sshpass\nSo how can I change the path of /update.out , /update.err and /update.pid this file from the above command.?\n\nA: In the first command, you are writing the output to a location that you have write access to, so everything is fine there.\nNow the /pra directory does not exist by default, so I assume you have created it using root access.\nSo to write to it, you have to use root access as well. Just add sudo to the command as,\nsudo sshpass -p prakash123 ssh -t -p $1 prakash@localhost './update_script.sh > /pra/log/update.out 2> /pra/log/update.err < /dev/null | echo $! > /pra/log/update.pid &'\n\nBut rather than doing this ,I would suggest you write to a directory in $HOME dir and give it rwx------ permission(i.e read/write/execute for you and no permissions to others).Thus you won't have to use sudo.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 12.10 wifi won't connect to wpa2 enterprise network I have dual boot win7 and Xubuntu 12.10.

I got a new computer a couple of weeks before the expected Trusty release date, so to save my the trouble of first installing Precise and then upgrading, I installed Trusty Final Beta. Now I see that even though older releases got a new OpenSSL version last night to address the heartbleed bug, there's no OpenSSL update for Trusty.\nWhat's the deal with that? Aren't pre-releases getting critical security fixes? Who is supposed to want to test a system when testing means not getting critical security fixes?\n\nA: It turns out that 14.04 did receive an update for OpenSSL, but I didn't see it earlier, because (according to Timo Jyrinki) security updates for pre-releases propagate through the usual mirror system (slowly) instead of becoming available right away via the repo hosted on security.ubuntu.com.\n", "Q: What happens after the core selects mass-storage When a usb mass-storage device is attached to the host, enumeration of the device happens and the process where an address is given to the device, getting the descriptors occurs, then the core checks for the class driver required and assigns the mass-storage driver.

I searched already for this question and got a page on here where someone answered with \"go to home/username/.fonts\" or somesuch. I ran into a couple problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*No such folder existed.\n\n*I discovered there was a \"home\" above \"Home\" in the hierarchy. Went there, double-clicked on my username, it took me back to Home. Which still did not contain any folder with the word \"font\" or \"fonts\" in it. There is an \"etc\" immediately followed by \"Music.\" Nothing before \"Calibre Library\" and nothing after \"Zombie Shooter 2 Saves\" either.\nSo yeah, there is no home/username/.fonts or home/username/fonts or anything of the sort. So where in the 24 Hecks does the OS actually keep the Fonts folder? And if anyone tells me home/username/fonts or whatever, I may have to scream.\nI have Ubuntu 12, I think, if that helps.\n\nA: You can search for the directory by opening a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)\nand entering:\nfind ~ -name fonts\n\n(for me it's .local/share/fonts)\n\nA: the .font folder is a hidden folder ,you may have to create it first.\nyou can install new fonts by putting them in it.\nNow for the location of intalled fonts you can find their locations in your fonts.conf file \ngedit /etc/fonts/fonts.conf \nmine are in /usr/share/fonts\n\nA: The directory /home itself is not any user's home directory. Rather, this directory contains the home directories of all the users of the system (except root), the name of each user's home direcotry being the name of the user. So, if your user name is user266566, then there will be a directory /home/user266566. That is your home directory. When you are in that directory, the file manager/shell recognizes that and indicates it in some way, such as capitalizing the H in Home, showing a house icon, or replacing the /home/user266566 with ~ (in the case of a shell).\nIf it helps, /home is akin to C:\\Users in Windows.\nAs for the font directories, you can install fonts either available for all users or simply for yourself. If you want a font available to just yourself, put it in ~/.fonts, where ~ refers to your home directory. If the directory .fonts doesn't exist in your home folder, make one. Also keep in mind that any file (including directories) that begins with a dot (.) will appear hidden unless you set your file manager to show hidden files. \nSo, if you can't find .fonts, perhaps the file manager is set to not show hidden files. (The key sequence Ctrl + H is a convention to toggle between showing and hiding \"dot\" files.) \nIf you want to install fonts system-wide (i.e. for all users), you'll need administrative privileges. The easiest way is to install fonts though the package manager if they're available as packages. These fonts will get installed in /usr/share/fonts (and within that directory, most likely in truetype). However, if you want to manually install fonts, a better place to put them is /usr/local/share/fonts since that nicely separates the fonts installed by the package manager and the fonts you installed manually. \n", "Q: How to list all virtual machines created using qemu-system-x86_64?

Past that, you could definitely double-check the values in /boot/grub/grub.cfg to make sure the UUIDs match up with the values in /dev/disk/by-uuid, and make sure that everything looks right in /boot/grub/device.map.  If that file is wrong you'll have trouble with (hdX) specifications in grub.cfg.\nManaging these files manually isn't necessary though if you're using update-grub after installing grub on replacement drives.  The biggest gotchas in my experience have been not updating the GRUB configuration, not installing GRUB on all the drives, or improper partitioning that makes it so you can't install GRUB without using --force.\n\nA: I don't think you can just check whether this will works or not before trying to do it, but instead you can get a preview of your GRUB instantly so you can be sure that your new configuration is loaded correctly in GRUB.\nThis could be achieved using a tool called grub-emu.\nman grub-emu\nNAME\n       grub-emu - GRUB emulator\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       grub-emu [OPTION]...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       GRUB emulator.\n\n       -r, --root-device=DEV\n              use DEV as the root device [default=guessed]\n\n       -m, --device-map=FILE\n              use FILE as the device map [default=/boot/grub/device.map]\n\n       -d, --directory=DIR\n              use GRUB files in the directory DIR [default=/boot/grub]\n\n       -v, --verbose\n              print verbose messages\n\nEasily install grub-emu using command line:\nsudo apt-get install grub-emu\n\nTo run it just use terminal to run this command:\ngrub-emu\n\n", "Q: Configuring Python Development version installation While installing PSI4 on Edit: Ubuntu 13.10 (earlier Ubuntu 12.04), I'm encountering the following error:\nconfigure: error: \nCould not link test program to Python.

When I google this question, I only get all sort of information on how to protect sensitive data, how to encrypt swap, and how \"dangerous\" could be to keep a \"normal\" swap in a linux system.\nBut I couldn't find any software, method or \"how to\" in order to really get (read) any piece of data from a swap partition.\nSo my question is, being a \"normal\" citizen living in western Europe, is it really necessary to wipe or encrypt the swap on my computer? And before someone answer \"yes\", can I have an exemple on how I could test, and leak out my own swap, so that I can actually see what kind of data is unprotected despite my encrypted home?\n\nA: \nbeing a \"normal\" citizen living in western Europe, is it really\n  necessary to wipe or encrypt the swap on my computer?\n\nIt is a personal judgement, one that depends on how much you value the privacy of your data, and how much you wish to protect your data from being exposed if it were to fall into the hands of an attacker. Suppose you have a laptop, and one day it gets stolen - how likely is that a thief would try to extract passwords or encryption keys or otherwise private data, and do you care? A lot of people do not care, but some do. Admittedly, most thieves would simply sell the laptop for immediate financial gain, but there are cases where an attacker might be motivated to go further in attempting to access the data itself.\n\nAnd before\n  someone answer \"yes\", can I have an exemple on how I could test, and\n  leak out my own swap, so that I can actually see what kind of data is\n  unprotected despite my encrypted home?\n\nThe memory of any process could potentially be swapped out to the swap space. Leaking memory can be dangerous - the obvious example being Heartbleed - see How I used Heartbleed to steal a site’s private crypto key. The memory that is exposed by Heartbleed only belongs to one single process, whereas the memory potentially exposed by your swap space belongs to every process. Imagine a process containing a private key, or password list (eg. web browser) being swapped out - those items will appear, in plaintext, in the swap space. Extracting them is a matter of sifting through the memory for particular patterns of data - it could be plaintext ASCII data visible through strings, or it could be more involved, as in Heartbleed (where the test is that some consecutive bytes are a divisor of the public crypto key). If you have an encrypted /home partition, then the obvious thing to look for is a block of data that forms the encryption key that will unlock the user's data.\nA working example:\n\n\n*\n\n*do bash -c 'echo SECRET=PASSWORD > /dev/null; sleep 1000' to create a bash process with some secret data on its stack \n\n*do sysctl vm.swappiness=100 to increase swappiness (not necessary, but may make the example easier)\n\n*run top -c, press f, enable the SWAP column, press q to go back to top process view, scroll down until you see the bash -c process\n\n*in another terminal, save Chimnay Kanchi's program from Linux: How to put a load on system memory? to usemem.c, compile it gcc -o usemem usemem.c, and run usemem & repeatedly in a terminal. This will use up 512MB blocks of memory at a time. (It does not matter what causes the memory to get swapped out, it could be normal system usage, a run away process, or a deliberate attack, the end result is the same)\n\n*watch top, wait for bash -c to get swapped (SWAP column value > 0)\n\n*now run strings /dev/sdaX | grep SECRET where X is your swap parititon\n\n*Congratulations - you just extracted \"secret\" data from the swap partition. you will see multiple copies of the SECRET text followed by the \"password\", the copies that include the full command line leaked from the parent bash process, top process, and the 'bash -c' process. The lines that do not include the full command line have leaked from the 'bash -c' process.\n\n*To prove that secrets leak from process memory, and not just the command line, add the line unsigned char secret[] = \"SECRET=XXXX\"; to usemem.c (just below the unsigned long mem; line). Recompile and run usemem & repeatedly, and strings /dev/sdaX | grep SECRET again. This time you will see the 'XXXX' secret being leaked.\n\nA: This question leads us to a discussion of issues between software development, such as software keep the sensitive data in memory and data encryption.\nSo to begin you should read some articles of practical software development and data encryption.\nStart to read this article:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/s-data.html?n-s-311\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: VirtualBox Ubuntu 12.04 LTS guest cannot shutdown I have a virtualbox guest running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

I want to decrease my startup process and I see the service named \"screen-cleanup\"\nWhat is that? Is it safe to remove?\n\nA: Short Answer: \nFirst of all, the mystery application to which that particular startup service belongs, is screen, which you may have installed separately, or it may have come as part of byobu terminal multiplexer.  Is it safe to disable? Basically, yes, but you won't be able to use screen. You can, however, still use byobu. I currently have it disabled, and writing this after a reboot.\nMore Details\nNow, onto the investigation and some proofs. Every start-up process has a start-up scripts, and initialization scripts to those are located in /etc/rc folders. There is several of them, depending on your system's run level. Run level topic is something separate from this question, but if anyone is interested, I recommend reading up on this answer from superuser.com, and man pages for init, update-rc.d, and runlevel.\nMy current run-level is 2, and under /etc/rc2.d/ I have the initializing script for screen-cleanup, S20screen-cleanup. If you cat it, you'll see that basically all it does is clean up saved sessions from screen (stored in /var/run/screen).\n\nDisabling can be done through Start-up Applications (GUI) or by renaming the initialization script from S20screen-cleanup to K20screeen-cleanup ( more precisely , it is 'sudo mv S20screen-cleanup K20screen-cleanup' command). \nWhat will happen if you disable this service ? Having rebooted my machine , I tried 3 things: enter screen, enter byobu, and ls /var/run/screen . The result is that byobu still runs (probably because it falls back to using tmux,, which also comes with byobu), screen won't start (reports \"Cannot make directory '/var/run/screen': Permission denied\"\n), and the said folder is not existent. But hey, the system is still running, everything still works, so you could say it's safe enough to disable that service, especially if you don't usually use screen or byobu. \nP.S:   Although this answer is somewhat late, I hope moderators will allow leaving it here, so it may be useful to other users who are looking into disabling some of the startup services.\n", "Q: Legal Question about Ubuntu So for many years I have been suggesting friends and family to switch to Ubuntu as it is my choice of OS, my question is this,\nCan i offer setting up Ubuntu for small businesses as a paid job.\nNow obviously I wouldn't be charging the customer for the operating system just the labor of installing and training etc.\nBut still is that something I am able to do as I wouldn't be selling the product just using my expertise to install it for a business.\nMain reason is with the vast majority of small companies using XP that is as of now redundant I feel ubuntu would be a proven great alternative.\nThankyou in advance.\n\nA: You can ask money for installing and training.

I've done that and I'm past this step. Instead, my problem is that the USB key doesn't boot (probably only on my machine). These two are distinct problems.\nQuestion:\nI seem to be unable to produce a working USB stick installation (not live USB stick) for my PC. Here are the details:\nTo create the USB stick, I go this path:\n\n\n*\n\n*booted from Ubuntu 12.04.4 DVD\n\n*used usb-stick-creator to create live USB stick from the same DVD image as used for burning the boot DVD\n\n*booted from the live USB stick\n\n*installed from live USB stick to another USB stick\n\n\nNow the problem starts:\nMy computer does not detect the USB stick with the normal installation as a boot device. When I try to boot with the stick plugged in, it doesn't boot from it although USB devices are put first in the boot order in the BIOS. If I hit F10 at startup (boot menu), then I get the boot menu, but the stick is not listed.\nI've switched between \"classic\" and \"UEFI\" boot options in the BIOS, but neither of them work.\nI've done the above procedure at least 3 times and the results were always the same. During the installation procedure, I've always carefully selected the device to which to install the boot loader. Here, I've always selected the USB stick to which I installed.\nMy PC is a Medion Erazer X7827.\nWhat else can I do about this?\nTelling from the installation procedure, Ubuntu isn't really intended to be booted from USB stick. It is clumsy to install to USB, because you need to manually configure the partitions and you may not miss to select the correct boot device. There is no option \"install to that USB stick\" ready made. This gives me the feeling that I'm trying to solve something with the wrong approach. Is a better way to go?!\nSomething very similar happens with Ubuntu 13.10. So far, I only found out that the beginning of the resulting usb stick contains different data depending on if UEFI was enabled at installation time or not. I guess that when installing while UEFI is enabled, I also have to enable UEFI when booting. And the other way around, when it's disabled at install time, it probably needs to be disabled at boot time, too. This alone doesn't help though.\nUPDATE / 2014-10-20:\nAdditionally to my BIOS problems, Ubuntu (also 14.04) doesn't write the boot code (whatever that is) to the right partition. I've done this same game again with 14.04 and now the Ubuntu installation which I previously had on the HDD doesn't boot anymore. I figure that the boot code on the HDD was overwritten by the installer, although I had carefully selected the USB stick to be the target for the bootloader. I suspect that this is a bug in the ubuntu installer.\n\nA: UPDATE / 2014-10-20:\nMy below answer doesn't solve all the problems and it can't be the last word spoken in this regard. I'm keeping this answer here, because the problem described here interfers with the symptoms described in the question. For details about another problem which can't be caused by the BIOS problem, see update on question.\nANSWER:\nThe problem is a bug in the BIOS which, instead of listing the USB key in the boot menu, doubles the entry for the internal drive:\n\nWhen selecting the second (doubled) entry for the internal drive, the machine boots from the USB key. Similar bugs (wrong labels, missing entries) exist in the BIOS' options when configuring the boot order.\nMachine: Medion Erazer X7827\nBIOS Version: (I will add this later.)\n", "Q: Cannot find package (pymol) I'm trying to install the program pymol (https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/raring/pymol/) on my system (I have Ubuntu 13.04).\nI've tried it via this link to the softwarecentre and via the terminal using sudo apt-get install pymol.

I really don't know which one should I choose so that I don't screw up Windows.\nI'm installing Ubuntu from a USB flash drive.\n\nA: You probably only have 1 physical harddrive. But with 2 partitions. Therefore only /dev/sda is present. The partitions are /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda5. My bet would be that sda1 is your Windows partition while sda5 is your desired partition for Ubuntu.\n\nA: You probably want to install Ubuntu into \"unused space on /dev/sda\", and to \"re-size existing partitions to make room\".\nYour /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda5 are existing partitions.  It's not clear why there's two of them (unless you did that yourself), but it could be that one is your C: drive and another is a recovery partition or some other utility partition set up by your computer manufacturer.\nYou do not want to just assume which partition is which and overwrite one.

My system is 64bit Intel processor(4GB RAM). \nwhen I download 64bit it's downloadind amd64.iso. Upto my knowledge ADM and Intel processors are different. Let me clear this.\nHow amd64 drivers are compatible with x86_64 architecture?\n\nA: \"amd64\" and \"x86-64\" are synonymous.\nThe name \"amd64\" exists because the 64-bit instruction set used in both AMD and Intel CPUs today is one that was originally invented by AMD.\nUsually known as \"x86-64\", it is also known sometimes as \"amd64\" honoring its AMD heritage, even though it is used universally by both AMD and Intel.\nBoth AMD and Intel originally invented their own 64-bit instruction sets.  Intel's was called IA-64 (brand name \"Itanium\") and it failed to be successful in the consumer market.  The instruction set used by both chipmakers is now the one invented by AMD.  One reason AMD's version was successful was that it was backwards-compatible with 32-bit x86 software.\nSoftware vendors usually refer to it as \"x86-64\" now which is a less confusing term and is actually quite descriptive, because it is a 64-bit extension of the \"x86\" instruction set.  However, the term \"amd64\" continues to be used by various Linux distributions like Ubuntu.\n\nA: The correct 64-bit version is indeed called amd64. That is because AMD was the first to create a 64 bit CPU, so the \"tag\" stuck, like the i386 for 32-bit, because IBM (i think it was), created the first 32-bit CPU.\nSo yes, if you have a 64-bit hardware system, you need to download the amd64.iso to make it work.\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu to a spare second hard drive? I have recently purchased 'Ubuntu unleashed' with a view to making a first time installation of Ubuntu.  The book contained a DVD version 13.10 but I have so far been unsuccessful with the actual installation itself\nI am attempting to instal the program on a spare second SSD (D:) \n- my other SSD has Windows 7 (C:). \nI am unable to find a way to inform the installation to instal Ubuntu onto the second drive (D:). \nIt will install itself perfectly well onto the remaining space on C: (but of course I don't want it there). At the very beginning of the set up, in the 3 choices, which ever I choose I never see an option to choose the final destination - drive D: \nThe dual boot installs itself beautifully but both OS's are on the same drive!\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: During install, it should give you an option to partition the drive yourself. It's in the step where it asks if it should install next to Windows, option is called \"Something else\". In that option, you can select your drive (ie. either /dev/sda og /dev/sdb).\n\nA: During the install you have the option to partition the disk and choose the right partitions for your install. You just have to choose it and manually do it (choose the right place to install).\n\nA: If you want to use any of the auto install options, just disconnect the Windows hard drive temporarily. Then Ubuntu installer will only have choice to install to the SSD drive you want.\nOr as suggested by others you can use Something else or manual install. But then you have to create partitions minimum of / (root) and swap, although with SSD and if you have lots of RAM, swap may not be required, but probably will not be used anyway.  For / partition you need to select format as ext4, tick format box. Also below partitioning screen is a combo box. It defaults to the drive that is sda, you want to change it to the drive that is sdb, or else you overwrite the Windows boot loader in sda. Then set BIOS to boot from the sdb drive. \nIf your Windows is UEFI (most Windows 7 are BIOS) you will want to install in UEFI mode and how you boot installer is how it installs.\n\nA: well, what I found is that: make shure you can see the drive in file explorer. If you cant, turn it on in the boot menu, and under... I think drives. you should be given a list of things plugged into the inside of your pc. dvd roms, graphics processor, and hard drives, for examples. turn them all on, then launch windows as usual. Do what you described in your problem, and every thing should be fine. this SHOULD work regardless of if you have the physical copy, or downloadable copy. if this isn't your issue, sorry, but I can't help you.\nEDIT: if you don't see it, plug the 5 cord thing into both drives, then use a spare orange flat cable to plug the new drive to the mother board, like the blue cord, but in a black motherboard input.\n", "Q: Finding Mouse click position in IconView in GTK I am building a file browser using Gtk.IconView in python.

How do I find them?\n\nA: To get the path, you should be able to do something like this (untested):\n    def on_iconview_selection_changed(self, widget):\n        try:\n            path = widget.get_selected_items()[0]\n        except IndexError:\n            # No icon selected, so the list returned by get_selected_items() is\n            # empty and indexing returns an IndexError\n            path = None\n\n", "Q: assign geany or gedit highlight to text Is there any way to assign geany highlight to text. For example when I pass a programming code to geany. Functions color is red. The thing which I am looking for is assingning these color to text. For example if I open that with another editor (which does not highlight the text) the colors remain.\n\nA: First of all, there is some basic concept here: the programs and the source code that you are editing are pure text --- there is no color or style information in the file. It is the editor that decides what color and style to apply when showing it to you. You can easily check that different editors will highlight the structure of your code in different ways. This thing is called syntax highlight. See for example how vim and gedit render the same file:\n\nNow you can export a syntax highlighted version of your code to various formats, but remember: this will not be code anymore, but a document; you cannot compile and execute it. \nMy preferred tool for that is pygmentize. You can install it with sudo apt-get install python-pygments. For example, \n % pygmentize -f html -o out.html  imgsize.py\n\nwill create an html version of your code, usable for web publishing, and \n % pygmentize -f rtf -o out.rtf  imgsize.py\n\nwill create an .rtf that you can read with Libreoffice or MS Word. There are a lot of formatters available.\n\nA: The syntax color feature is provided per filestype by the IDE/editor and there's no way to export it or save it as part of the original text file.\nIf your goal is to present the original source with syntax highlighting, I'd suggest to use http://tohtml.com/ and save the rich text preview into a document that supports this format, like ODF text document.\n", "Q: I can install Ubuntu for Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3?

Go into your add/remove programs within Windows and see if Wubi is listed. If not then the install was not a success. \n", "Q: How do I install dual boot properly?? Last attempt corrupted MBR completely Dell Inspiron n5110 with i5, 4gb Ram, 500gb HDD Windows 7 and UBUNTU 12.04.4.  I booted off a Live USB and everything was great.  I really want UBUNTU so I tried to do a dual install using the included install app.  I selected 50gb space, and ran the install.  Everything was great until I re-booted.  Then I got an error message saying there was no such Device (?) and completely crashing.  I had to boot of the live USB again to get anything to work at all.  I then deleted the two partitions created during the install, rebooted using a HIRENS USB stick, which got me back into Windows.  I then created a system repair disk and re-booted again with the cd.  I was able to repair the MBR after that and finally get Windows to boot normally.  \nBUT... I still want to install UBUNTU 12.04.4 if I can figure out what went wrong and get it to work properly.  Any advice????\nAdditional information..\nThanks for the reply but no go with that.  I just tried to install 13.10 and the install said I there was no OP system detected. In other words, I could not detect Windows 7 (after I repaired the MBR) Yet I can boot Windows 7 normally.  This is very frustrating.  I know UBUNTU is working because I can boot from a live USB with no problem and run in trial mode all day.  But of course, can't add aps and save it in trial mode.

I also hear torrenting is safer rather than direct download, so you could try that.\nI hope you get it to work.\n\nA: Whenever I read about dual booting nowdays, especially with the tack MS has taken with boot issues, my first thought is to wonder why? By installing a virtual machine manager you can run as many operating systems as you want, and run them at the same time. Using vmware you could even have gnuradio running right on your windows desktop (or have windows running on your gnu desktop). \n", "Q: Cannot deploy local charms after Juju upgrade I keep getting ERROR only charm store charm references are supported, with cs: schema when I try to deploy charms from a local repository.

I am assuming you want to remove the double quotes around the 1st and 3rd fields only. If so, any of these should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*sed\nsed -r 's/^\"([^\"]+)\"(\\s*,\\s*[^,]+)\\s*,\\s*\"([^\"]+)\"/\\1\\2, \\3/' file.csv\n\nExplanation\nThe -r enables extended regular expressions, allowing us to use parentheses to capture patterns without needing to escape them. So, we match a quote at the beginning of the line (^\"), followed by one or more non-quote characters ([^\"]+), then the closing  quote, followed by 0 or more spaces, a comma, then 0 or more spaces again (\\s*,\\s*), then a stretch of non-commas until the next comma (this defines the 2nd field). Finally, we look for 0 or more spaces, a comma, and replace that with the 1st captured pattern (\\1), then the 2nd (\\2), a comma, a space and the 3rd. \n\n*Perl\nperl -pe 's/^\"([^\"]+)\"(\\s*,\\s*[^,]+)\\s*,\\s*\"([^\"]+)\"/$1$2, $3/; ' file.csv\n\nExplanation\nThe -p means print every line after applying the script passed by -e. The script itself is basically the same regex as in the sed above. Only here, the captured patterns is $1.\n\n*awk\nawk -F, -v OFS=\",\" '{gsub(\"\\\"\",\"\",$1)0gsub(\"\\\"\",\"\",$3);}1;' file.csv \n\nExplanation\nThe -F sets the field separator to ,. OFS is the output field separator which is also set to , so that the lines are printed correctly. The gsub makes the substitution, replacing all \" with nothing since we run it on the 1st ($1) and 3rd fields ($3) it will only remove the quotes from those fields. The 1; is just awk shorthand for \"print the line\".\n\nA: Python solution\nThe small script below takes file command-line argument, iterates over each line in that file, and splits each line into list of items using , as separator. Each entry is then unquoted and checked for being a numeric string; if a string is numeric , it is left unquoted.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys\n\nwith open(sys.argv[1]) as fp:\n    for line in fp:\n        new_vals = []\n        vals = line.strip().split(',')\n        for val in vals:\n            val = val.strip().rstrip().replace('\"','')\n            if not val.isdigit(): \n               val = '\"' + val  + '\"'\n            new_vals.append(val)\n        print(\",\".join(new_vals))\n               \n            \n\nTest run:\n$ cat input.txt\n\"34432\", \"name\", \"0\", \"very long description\" \n\"1234\", \"othe name\" , \"42\", \"another description\"\n$ ./unquote_integers.py  input.txt                                       \n34432,\"name\",0,\"very long description\"\n1234,\"othe name\",42,\"another description\"\n\nAdditional notes:\nIt was asked in the comments , why the script removes double quotes around each item before evaluating if the item is numeric string or not. The main reason for that is because inclusion of double quotes will make item like \"123\" evaluate to False, i.e. non numeric. Effectively, we need to evaluate what's within the double quotes somehow. Now, there is alternative way to approach this via taking list slice of each value. However, that's not any better than using .replace() from the beginning. It does make code shorter, but at least in this case shortness of a script is irrelevant - our goal is to make the code work, not code-golf it.\nHere's the alternative solution with list slices:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys\n\nwith open(sys.argv[1]) as fp:\n    for line in fp:\n        new_vals = []\n        vals = line.strip().split(',')\n        for val in vals:\n            val = val.strip().rstrip() #remove extra spaces\n            val = val.replace('\"','') if val[1:-1].isdigit() else val\n            new_vals.append(val)\n        print(\",\".join(new_vals))\n               \n            \n\n", "Q: What does the output of apt-get install --dry-run mean?

It looks like it'll be grabbing 5.12 from either archive.ubuntu.com or security.ubuntu.com. What's the preceding 500?\n\nA: The output of apt-get --dry-run means, as you already figured out, that openssl 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.11 is currently installed on your system and that it will be replaced with openssl 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.12 once you run the install command.\nThe numbers (500 and 100) in the output of apt-cache policy openssl indicate the priority of the given repository. As you can see, there are packages of openssl 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.12 available from two repositories (precise-updates and precise-security), both with a priority of 500. If the precise-security priority were to be 700, apt-get would first try to download the package from that repository.\n\nA: You're right, it will install openssl 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.12 from http://archive.ubuntu.com.\n500 is the priority of the source.

This makes sure that log events sent to rsyslog are handled nicely.\n# Create a template for the vpn log location\n$template OpenVPN,\"/var/log/openvpn/ovpn.log\"\n\n# Save log events where the programname starts with ovpn like ovpn-server to the \n# location mentioned in the template\n:programname, startswith, \"ovpn-\" -?OpenVPN\n\n# Stop processing ovpn-* log events \n:programname, startswith, \"ovpn-\" ~\n\nRun this command and make sure that there is no output. \ngrep ^log /etc/openvpn/server.conf\n\nIf this command outputs any lines, then your need to go into the config and comment out the log or log-append line. This will trigger the default logging that sends it to syslog.\nFinally, create a new file /etc/logrotate.d/ovpn and add the contents below to that file. This will do a weekly rotation or rotate once a log file becomes 100M in size. It will keep 4 weeks and compress everything but that last two. \n/var/log/openvpn/*.log {\n        weekly\n        size 100M\n        rotate 4\n        compress\n        delaycompress\n        missingok\n        notifempty\n        create 640 syslog adm\n}\n\nRestart the rsyslog and then openvpn services to make sure these new configs take. You should see /var/log/openvpn and /var/log/openvpn/ovpn.log get created immediately by rsyslog after openvpn restarts.\n", "Q: Which Notes-apps featuring notes that stick to the desktop are available for Unity I'm looking for something like stickynotes or xfce4-notes. I read the former is not supported anymore. Does the latter work well in Unity?\n\nA: stickynotes works on 14.04.  I'm using it now, it's pretty cool, similar to the Windows7 desktop widget stickies.\nhttp://linuxg.net/how-to-install-indicator-stickynotes-0-4-2-on-ubuntu-14-0413-1012-1012-04-linux-mint-161413-and-elementary-os-0-2/\n", "Q: Minimum space requirement for /boot partition One question arise in my mind during the installation of ubuntu that what are the minimum space requirement for the /boot partition ?\nBecause only the kernel, GRUB and initrd file are present in this section of linux. So I want to know what is the minimum sapce require to create this prtition? \nCan we create this partition equal to the Size of all file like GRUB,Kernel and Initrd ? \n\nA: The /boot partition contains the GRUB configuration, the kernel with their System.map, 1GB should be enough.\nName   | Size\n/boot  | 250MB ~ 1GB\nswap   | at least size of RAM\n/      | minimum 8 GB, at least 15 GB recommended\n\nSource\n\nA: \"Can we create this partition equal to the Size of all file like GRUB,Kernel and Initrd?\" \nThis may work at first but would be insufficient for a working system.\nThe system will keep several kernels around in case you need to fall back to a previous kernel. The number of kernels vary and sometime are not cleared out properly causing your boot partition to fill up. This can lead to complications that are not too hard to fix, but are annoying nonetheless. \n", "Q: Where's my Windows gone! I installed ubuntu on my xp computer but when it starts up it just boots strait into ubuntu & I can't access xp at all.Where's it gone?\n I think I might have made a mistake not setting up a partition beforehand.I just moved the slider allocating 79gb to abuntu & leaving windows with 71gb assuming that was making a partition that I could duel boot from.Now I'd like to remove abuntu & start again but how do I do it?\n\nA: I haven't had this before but I might be able to help. When your computer turns on there should be a place where it says a button you can press in order to boot your computer on a different drive (I think it might be F11) maybe when you do that you will have the option to revert to your previous operating system.\n", "Q: How to browse the internet while installing Ubuntu? During the installation of Ubuntu 14.04 final beta release on VirtualBox. I was prompted with the option of reading the release notes. Being so curious about what difference does 14.04 make compared to 13.10, I chose to read the release notes and Firefox popped up.\n\nOther than the opened page was just ubuntu.com and no the release notes page, I found that I can actually browse other websites too, which I consider could be extremely helpful in some situations.\nSo how can I open Firefox during Ubuntu installation ?  I can't rely on the installation to have a link to release notes in the first step, so I can open Firefox through it. I'm asking if there is a generic way to do this.\n\nA: To be able to open Firefox (or even install apps) while doing the installer the first part is to select the Try Ubuntu option found as the first option in the installer:\n\nThe difference between both is that Install Ubuntu will automatically start the Ubuntu installer process. The Try Ubuntu will load the Desktop and you can play around with Ubuntu, including Firefox and if you are satisfied with Ubuntu on your PC you can proceed and click on the Install Ubuntu icon on the Desktop.\nWith this approach, even while you are installing Ubuntu, you will be able to do other things (Like browsing). This is by far the easiest most direct way to do what you want.\n", "Q: Power via another computer I am 13 and am considering putting Ubuntu on my parents old computer, however it is very slow. I was wondering if I could make it so their computer uses part of my computers power (I have a fast computer) but I still get to use windows. So my computer in a way hosts two computers with 2 different OSs.\nThank you!\n\nA: As bodhi.zazen mentions, the easiest way is to just put a light OS on the less powerful machine. Other options will require a lot more work.\nDual booting as terdon suggests only lets you use one OS at a time, which from my understanding of your question is not what you are looking for.\nYou can also run some kind of virtualization software on your more powerful computer. Install Ubuntu as a virtual machine. With Ubuntu on the less powerful machine, you can either remote into the virtual machine with something like VNC, or do something like X11 forwarding. This will mostly utilize the CPU and hard drive speed of the more powerful computer. Graphics performance in a situation like this won't be helped much, and it depends on the network.\n", "Q: Append current timestamp on files name from background running command Following is command that I have used in bash script and it is run on background:\nsshpass -p prakash12 ssh -t -p $1 prakash@localhost './test_new_update_script.sh > /home/log/unit_update_output.log 2> /home/log/unit_update_error.log < /dev/null | echo $! > /home/log/unit_update_pids &'\n\nThis command created 3 files at run time i.e. unit_update_output.log, unit_update_error.log and unit_update_pids.

Using the exact same syntax as in your question, you could do:\nsshpass -p prakash12 ssh -t -p $1 prakash@localhost \\\n    './test_new_update_script.sh > /home/log/unit_update_output.$(date '+%F-%T').log \\\n     2> /home/log/unit_update_error.$(date '+%F-%T').log < /dev/null | \n     echo $! > /home/log/unit_update_pids$(date '+%F-%T') &'\n\nThe trick is adding $(date '+%F-%T')., this will return (for example):\n$ date '+%F-%T'\n2014-04-08-18:54:52\n\nSo, the command above will create:\n/home/log/unit_update_output.2014-04-08-18:57:02.log \n/home/log/unit_update_error.2014-04-08-18:57:02.log \n/home/log/unit_update_pids2014-04-08-18:57:02\n\nSee man date for the different formats you can have.\n", "Q: How to prevent gnome-mplayer from asking to resume at the latest position gnome-mplayer asks whether to resume at the latest position if the playback has been canceled before the end of the video in a previous run of the program.

Following the answer for this question (How to run scripts on start up?), I set up my system to run umount /boot right before the login screen and I rebooted several times to make sure this was working reliably. Then I installed the AMD proprietary graphics drivers from here:\n\nFollowing the installation and reboot of the system, I ended up with no display; the monitor was in power save mode which meant the most reliable way to diagnose this problem was using something known to be working: a live Ubuntu disc and chroot.\nHaving mounted all the partitions necessary, I chroot into the installation and ran apt-get remove on every package listed by dpkg -l '*fglrx*'. From the output, I was able to spot that in the removal process, some files in /boot were being modified and update-initramfs was being run. Suspecting that the real problem might have been /boot being inaccessible during the first installation of the proprietary drivers, I ran apt-get install fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates before rebooting the system.\nAnd it worked!\nFolks: make sure your /boot partition is available before installing or removing any software/updates! You'll never know when /boot might be needed.\n", "Q: How to create disc that installs Ubuntu? I just downloaded Ubuntu 13.10 desktop -amd64 but it is an ISO file. Do I have to create a disc (make Bootable CD) to install new OS (Ubuntu 13.10)? I haven't done this before.\n\nA: You have to burn the ISO file on the disc with a burning program. You can download it from This site. After downloading follow this video for burning. Burning Image Video. Please note you have to burn an \"image\", to make it bootable. Only an image(.ISO file) is bootable. So if you copy only the ISO file directly without burning on disc or usb(pendrive), your computer can't boot from it or your computer wont start installing Ubuntu.\nNearly, all burning programs, in Linux/Windows/Mac, have the option to burn an image. You have to select Burn or Make bootable disc button and not the copy-button.\nIf a correct image is burnt on the disc, you can boot it (please don't forget to indicate in the BIOS that you wish to boot from disc and not e. g. from a hard-disk).\nIf you didn't understand my last line then follow this after burning disc.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: Burn the whole .ISO image to a disk. You can use imgburn, CDburnerXP, or whatever your preference is. You can also make a bootable USB with UNETbootin.\n", "Q: how do I get to/view my files on my home network with Lubuntu Support for Windows XP ends in (approx.) 13 Hours... So I loaded Lubuntu on my computer. I have a hard drive attached to my router so all the computers in the family can share files. I don’t know how to get to those files with Lubuntu. Shouldn't I be able to see my (network) files with PCManFM?\nI’m sure being in alien territory is just getting the best of me. From the start menu of Windows7 I click on “Computer” then “Network” on the left, tree branches drop down and voilà there they are. I searched the web and could only find info on a program called Samba. I'm not sure that’s what I want. I don’t want to arbitrarily install something I don’t need. Furthermore, all the articles mentioned being able to view Windows files. Isn’t a JPG or PDF file the same regardless the operating system? Hope you can dumb it down/point me in the right direction. Thanks!\n\nA: Its looks like your router is sharing the files over Samba. This is a protocol for sharing files over a network, ussually associated with Windows networks.\nTo obtain support for this in Ubuntu you need to install cifs-utils: sudo apt-get install cifs-utils \nYou will have to find the server and share names from your Windows computer. Navigate to the network folder in Windows Explorer. Then check the address bar to get the server and share name. It should look like \\\\. Where  could be a name or an IP address.\nNow, from within Ubuntu create a directory in your home directory (the name doesn't matter) mkdir ~/smbShare\nTo manually mount the file run sudo mount -t cifs //<server>/share /home/username/smbShare\nThere are additional options for the mount coommand, and you may need to provide a username and password to access the share.\n", "Q: What's the opposite of setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps?

Today I wanted nocaps, but could not set it because the other setting was still active.  I used the command above and then I was able to use setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps\n\nA: Would be really nice to find a complete, readable documentation where is explained how the keyboard mechanism works in Ubuntu and how to locally override it (and how it interacts with layout switching). \nI am under the suspicion that there is really few people really understanding it (I remember a famous quote of Stephen Hawkings, methinks,  about time); I have collected a bit of links in another answer but still, no general how-to. \nBasically you should chase all the definitions for your keyboard starting from /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us --- if your keyboard is us, substitute as needed; there are a lot of options and includes in it, it seems that most of the modifiers keys are in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base, where you can find: \ncaps:none             =       +capslock(none)\ncaps:ctrl_modifier    =       +capslock(ctrl_modifier)\nctrl:nocaps           =       +ctrl(nocaps)\nctrl:lctrl_meta       =       +ctrl(lctrl_meta)\nctrl:swapcaps         =       +ctrl(swapcaps)\n\nand in xorg.lst: \nctrl:nocaps    Caps Lock as Ctrl \n...\ncaps:capslock        Caps Lock toggles normal capitalization of alphabetic characters\n\namong gazillion other things. So what that mean, and what other options you have, are probably dependent on your layout, but you can try to guess something looking there. \nFor example I would try \nsetxkbmap -option caps:capslock \n\nto revert it. \nNow, what they exactly mean, how do you enable it (via control center -> keyboard or language, via gnome-tweak-tool, command line, init scripts), how to make them impervious to a layout switch, if they work or not (I am unable to disable caps-lock and make it so across layout switches), is another matter. \nIf anyone can fill in the answer, please do that. I was used to tweak my keyboard with xmodmap, I understand this is superceded, but would it be really nice to have an howto to how to tweak your keyboard... \n", "Q: Really installed packages in (K)ubuntu 1) First question\nHow to list really installed packages in ubuntu?\nThe problem of dpkg --get-selections (the command written in almost any forum) is that its second column (which is install / deinstall) completely depends on previously issued commands (I mean dpkg --set-selections and dpkg --clear-selections), but not on actual state of package (installed or not).\n2) Second question\nI (investigating described above problem) semi-occasionally executed command - dpkg --clear-selections, and now have almost all packages in deinstall state. So how can I update states of packages (and make them consistent with those states, which aptitude show <pkg_name> outputs)?\n\nA: To get the list of installed packages, run this:\ndpkg -l | grep -c ^.i\n\ndpkg -l will list all available packages and the first field consists of status codes. Specifically (from man dpkg):\nThe  first  three columns of the output show the desired action,\nthe package status, and errors, in that order.\n\nDesired action:\n u = Unknown\n i = Install\n h = Hold\n r = Remove\n p = Purge\n\nPackage status:\n n = Not-installed\n c = Config-files\n H = Half-installed\n U = Unpacked\n F = Half-configured\n W = Triggers-awaiting\n t = Triggers-pending\n i = Installed\n\nError flags:\n  <empty> = (none)\n  R = Reinst-required\n\nSo, lines whose 2nd character is i describe installed packages. So, passing the output through grep -c ^.i will return the number of lines whose 2nd char is i, which will be the number of packages you currently have installed.\n", "Q: Overheating, faulty laptop - How to prevent overheating? I have a problem with my laptop. It overheats.\nIn Windows 7 I use 80% Maximum Power State under power options to workaround the issue.  \nIs there a similar solution available for Ubuntu?\nCan I set my maximum processor power state somehow to 80%?\n\nA: Have you installed the latest microde for your CPU. It is very useful for laptops and all the other computers with newest CPUs. If your CPU is from Intel, you need to install \nintel-microcode package and also microcode.ctl package, and there is a different package for Amd CPUs named amd64-microcode.\nThis is a good tutorial showing you how to properly update Ubuntu to the latest microcode package.\nOnce you install this microcode package, you should see after reboot some improvements for your CPU temperatures. Next you can visit this page to learn how to properly deal with CPU overheating and CPU power control by installing and testing one or more software packages as suggested in that link. Please read the comments to the article too because they can provide you with other reliable alternate solutions for your problem.\n\nA: Information on CPU states:\nThe states in Windows have no exact results.\nWhat I mean is... you cannot set a CPU to 80%.\nThey only have a few steps, like 4 or maybe 5.  \nAnd they can also go sleeping, modern CPUs can park cores... the list goes on.  \nYou can solve this two ways.\n\nFirst, the easiest, but dumbest.\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq \nYou will get a nice indicator, where you can switch to power-saving mode.\nIndeed, this is not 80% or x% you wanted, but this is the easiest.  \nSecond, define your own percentages.\nYou will need to get your hands dirty for this. Not that much, though.\nFirst, you have to  edit your /etc/cpufreqd.conf file with your favourite tool.\nLike so: sudo gedit /etc/cpufreqd.conf \nHere is an example - do NOT use this, just use it as a base:\nhttp://pastebin.com/aEm3cgYM - It's from ThinkWiki  \nPlease note, that I have no means to test out the second one.\n(I will edit my answer when I verified it.)\n", "Q: How to really check current cpu Hz? All programs I've tried seem to be listing Hz from cpu's specifications not actually checking what the current Hz really is.\nfor example a processor is marketed with 4GHz.But this is the max (unless you over/under/clock) and if the cpu isn't doing anything or is getting too hot it will throttle down.\nThe program always will say 4Ghz even when the CPU is at 2Ghz.I want to avoid this and know the real Hz.\nWhat programs actually check current cpu hz and not just read cpu specifications?\n\nA: You can easily check the current CPU frequency using the following command:\nwatch -n 0 \"lscpu | grep 'MHz'\"\n\nYou can also get the current cpu frequency with this command:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq\n\nMost modern CPUs can adjust their clock frequency.

I have little knowledge about how to properly configure a firewall in Linux, and for that matter little knowledge about Linux itself.\nThis is the reason I need software packages with a friendly interface like they have in Windows. I use Firestarter to configure my firewall in Ubuntu, and I find it to be a reliable firewall once you change a few settings in Firestarter preferences. You can install firestarter with this code:\n  sudo apt-get install firestarter\n\nAnd after that you should edit the following file and change the lines commented out that create the relevant logfile:\n  gksu leafpad /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf\n\n#.=info;.=notice;*.=warn;\\ \n# auth,authpriv.none;\\ \n# cron,daemon.none;\\ \n# mail,news.none -/var/log/messages \nAll you have to do is to remove the # symbol preceding each line to uncomment all the above mentioned lines. After you save /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf, you also need to restart rsyslog or reboot:\nsudo service rsyslog restart\n\nThis way firestarter will work like a charm, and you can adjust its settings from Preferences.

Ubuntu 13.10 Firstly I have to aoplogize for any mistakes, I am not native English speaker. But I will try my best to tell what is happening.\nWhen using Windows XP my CD/DVD drive was working normally as long as I was watching movies in Windows Media Player. When watching a movie with any other program, it was extremely loud. \nNow I am using Ubuntu 13.10 and obviously I have no Windows Media Player. I am using VLC and my CD/DVD drive is not working normally. What can be wrong? \nThanks for all answers!\n\nA: Solution (?) \nCheck mplayer's man page.\nNow this may sound trivial and silly, but mplayer is a featureful  piece of software.  \nFor example, there is this (for DVD):  \n-dvd-speed <factor or speed in KB/s> (DVD only)\n              Try  to limit DVD speed (default: 0, no change).  DVD base speed\n              is about 1350KB/s, so a 8x  drive  can  read  at  speeds  up  to\n              10800KB/s.   Slower speeds make the drive more quiet, for watchâ\n              ing DVDs 2700KB/s should be quiet and fast enough.  MPlayer  reâ\n              sets the speed to the drive default value on close.  Values less\n              than 100 mean multiples of 1350KB/s, i.e. -dvd-speed  8  selects\n              10800KB/s.\n              NOTE:  You  need  write  access  to the DVD device to change the\n              speed.\n\nAnd then the same for CDDA:  \n-cdda <option1:option2> (CDDA only)\n              This option can be used to tune the CD Audio reading feature  of\n              MPlayer.\n\n              Available options are:\n\n                 speed=<value>\n                      Set CD spin speed.\n\nWorkarounds \n\n\n*\n\n*You could try mplayer and cache the video file.\nBut don't do this, as this would eat up all the memory you have.\n\n*You could just rip or read in the disc before watching it.\nIf the noise bothers you even at this period, reading the disc gives you the option to specify read speed.

Will Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr request me to update when the actual LST gets released or will I have to manually download another image file and install on virtualbox? \n\nA: Of course it will. \nIf you would have changed your repos on a 13.10 machine to Trusty ones, it would have went through all the alpha and beta phases. And finally changed into the final one.  \nVersions are basically meaningless. They only state milestones. Alpha, beta, RC tags too.\nBig versions (such as 13.10, 14.04, LTS) only mean LTS/stable states, and that's it.\nEven LTS/stable is just a different support timeframe nowadays.  \n(In the past, LTS had no major upgrades. I mean, in a Debian kind of way.\nBut that's not true anymore, even the latest LTS had a major graphical stack change lately.)  \nEven more explanation...  \nIn Debian, you can stay on channels for testing, still-in-development and experimental, without ever rewriting your sources.list, or changing anything. Well, indeed, you need one change after a clean install. But that's it.\nUbuntu does not have this... yet. There is only a development channel by the new codename (which was Trusty Tahr). Which meant a highly unstable - usable - stable states altogether. It changed as time passed. Again, things can go FUBAR even with the latest beta.\nWith LTS versions (well, branches/codenames), you can usually switch to the new channel sooner, as LTS gets imported from Debian's Testing tree. Not from SID. But this is not a rule, you just have a better chance of getting a working system. If the state of testing is in a bad shape, things won't look any better.\n", "Q: How do I enable a specific pam config in the lockscreen? In Trusty, there is a new lockscreen that fits the look and feel of lightdm, and shares some config files, especially for pam.\nI am using libpam-fprintd to allow using my fingerprint reader when asked for a sudo password, or for unlocking the screen.\nThe point is that I don't want to allow the fingerprint reader when logging into the desktop. But I want to allow it when unlocking the screen. The reason for that is that fingerprint won't allow to open the gnome-keyring, which is fine when unlocking, but not when loging-in. This also enables me to have a strong password, as I type it only once, then use the fingerprint reader.\nSee the PPA page instructions, especially the \"Note on keyrings and passwordless logins\" part\nBefore the new lock-screen, /etc/pam.d/lightdm was used by the greeter, not by the (old) lock-screen. So I had a different behaviour when logging in and when unlocking, which was exactly what I wanted.\nSee this page from the Thinkwiki for the config used.\nNow, it seems that /etc/pam.d/lightdm is used by both the greeter and the lock-screen.\nSo my need would be to have a distinct pam config file for the greeter and for the lock screen. Is this possible?\n\nA: Currently this is not possible. From the Unity code (lockscreen/UserAuthenticatorPam.cpp):\n// FIXME (andy) We should install our own unityshell pam file.\n  return pam_start(\"lightdm\", username_.c_str(),\n                   &conversation, &pam_handle_) == PAM_SUCCESS;\n\nYou should file a feature request for this.\n", "Q: Configuring additional two monitors to an Ubuntu12.04 installed system Can anyone please guide me how to configure additional monitors to my Ubuntu12.04 installed system?

Anyone want to comment on sudo bash in comparison to sudo su and sudo -i?\nI know sudo -i is the preferred because \"environment\".\nI've gotten into the bad habit from years ago when I was a kid in a basement of using sudo bash.\nI know it's rather kludgy and awkward, but it works.\nI'm looking for a precise and compelling argument to cut my brain free from this habit.\nPlease tell me why my method is trash? I need an intervention.\n\nA: I don't think sudo bash is wrong, it's just less convenient. For one, it's 2 more characters than sudo -i. With sudo bash you're just starting bash as another user (try doing it and doing pwd to see what the current directory is), whereas  sudo -i \"attempts to change to that user's home directory before running the shell\". sudo -i tries to give you an \"environment similar to the one a user would receive at login\". Also, sudo -i will read \"login-specific resource files such as .profile or .login\". Finally, sudo -i will honor the shell the user set in /etc/passwd.\nOn a single-user system these aren't likely to matter too much, but unless you never expect to work on a system other than yours, you'd do well to train yourself to do things the recommended way.\nsudo su is also possibly not entirely wrong (and isn't longer than sudo -i), but this option is plainly ugly and looks really kludgy; if you can sudo, why sudo su, instead of sudoing a proper shell? also, sudo su will not properly set the user's login environment, you need sudo su - for that, at which point you're again typing 2 more characters than sudo -i.\n", "Q: Why does my filesystem appear to be full to Ubuntu?

I build the package with debuild -us -uc.\nInstallation\nsudo dpkg -i Foo_1.0-1_all.deb\nWhen I install the package on one machine it goes fine, but another it fails. (Foo.conf is added to /etc/init and the service is started).  That is, Foo.conf is not added to /etc/init. The backwards-compatibility Foo script (symbolic link to upstart-job) does get added to /etc/init.d, and doc files are added to /usr/share/doc/Foo. But, /etc/init/Foo.conf is missing.\nEDIT\nOriginally I believed the problem was due to architecture. That was simply because I had a working install on amd64, but the problem occurred on an i386 machine. I neglected to realize that I had previously done manual installation & removal on the i386 machine which dpkg avoided interfering with.\n\nA: Troubleshooting\nWhen a package fails to install you can troubleshoot by using the Debug switch. It takes a bitfield to determine the level and subject-matter. A value of D=7777 will show everything. For this problem we know we are specifically interested in conf files so we can use D=220.\nsudo dpkg -D=220 -i Foo_1.0-1_all.deb\nYour output may show something like the following:\nD000200: conffderef in='/etc/init/Foo.conf' current working='/etc/init/Foo.conf'\nD000200: conffderef nonexistent\nD000020: deferred_configure '/etc/init/Foo.conf' (= '/etc/init/Foo.conf') useredited=1 distedited=0 what=2002\n\nThe key clue is useredited=1. By default dpkg will not replace user-edited configuration files. Manually deleting a .conf file counts as editing it, so it may come as a surprise that dpkg will not replace the missing file. It may be doubly-surprising for those experienced with installing services on other operating systems that an Upstart Job is treated as configuration.\nForce missing conf installation\ndpkg has a handful of force options. You can force the replacement of the missing .conf file as so:\nsudo dpkg -i --force-confmiss Foo_1.0-1_all.deb\nThere are other force options for similar scenarios; check the manual page or use dpkg --force-help for details. These options should be used with care, especially for 3rd party packages.\nPackage Dev/Test Cycle\nIn the development of a .deb package (e.g. for an Upstart Job) you'll be installing and removing the package many times. You'll also possibly be tweaking the .conf file manually at times. By default dpkg -r (or apt-get remove) will not remove the .conf file. (So surprisingly the upstart job remains while associated binaries may be gone.) For this you must use the purge option. Therefore to test completely removing and reinstalling the upstart job, you can do the following:\nsudo dpkg -i Foo_1.0-1_all.deb\n# testing...\nsudo apt-get purge Foo\n\nAnd now that you know about the force and debug options you can apply those as needed.\nReferences\nSee the thread Bug#1198: dpkg silently fails to install a file:\n\nRemoving the file counts as `editing' it, because for many\n  configuration files the absence of a file is meaningful.\n\nManual page for dpkg\n", "Q: Block IP address on hostapd network I share my internet access through hostapd how can I block the client of the AP from accessing a certain IP address?\n\nA: Hostapd does not deal with IP addresses, but you can restrict your station id's.\n# Station MAC address -based authentication\n# Please note that this kind of access control requires a driver that uses\n# hostapd to take care of management frame processing and as such, this can be\n# used with driver=hostap or driver=nl80211, but not with driver=madwifi.\n# 0 = accept unless in deny list\n# 1 = deny unless in accept list\n# 2 = use external RADIUS server (accept/deny lists are searched first)\nmacaddr_acl=1\n\n# Accept/deny lists are read from separate files (containing list of\n# MAC addresses, one per line).

I'm not computer savvy so thorough explanation would be appreciated. \n\nA: For the low graphics mode, the only solution is to install a video driver for your graphic card.\nYou can lower system resource usage by installing all XFCE4 packages including XFCE4-settings, and also Xubuntu-desktop and Xubuntu-settings packages. \nThis way you'll be able to choose the XFCE session (or Xubuntu session) at login prompt, and use fewer resources than you are using now when you can access only the Gnome session in Ubuntu. If you install XFCE4 packages dont forget to also install the xfce4-goodies package.\nYou can also choose to install all LXDE packages, LXDE package included, and also Lubuntu-desktop and lubuntu-settings packages. This way you'll be able to also choose the LXDE session (Lubuntu session) at login prompt. Lxde session uses even fewer resources than the Xfce session.\nYou can install all these packages using Synaptic Package Manager, and type in the Search field either xfce4 or lxde to find and install all required packages for each session. If you don't have Synaptic present on your systen, you can install it using this code:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nTo make your system a little bit faster, I suggest you also install preload package:\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nAnd also you can install bum package which will allow you to stop some daemons and services that you know you never use, like printers, scanners and so on:\nsudo apt-get install bum\n\n\nA: Are you using the Via Unichrome integrated graphics or a discrete GPU? If using discrete go into your BIOS settings and back down memory usage or disable the onboard graphics. This will free up system memory for the OS to use.

Product info: Acer c7 chromebook with chromeOS and xubuntu 12.04 (i think) dual booted using 'crouton'. \nMy problem is that my main/root partition is too small. This is where all of my packages get installed and it's always on the brink of being out of space. I need to install something big on it OR find a way to install packages to my larger partition, but from what I've read that's not easy or practical. \nSo I've been doing a lot of reading on this site about merging/resizing partitions and I can't tell if this will work for me or not. I don't know what a primary or logical partition means. I've taken some screenshots of my lsblk and parted -l results, and how my partitions show in Gparted. \nI need my 300 GB partition to be merged in with my \"/\" directory if possible...\n\n\n\nSo can I merge my partitions #6 and #7 or are they incompatible since one is kernel unformatted and the other is ext4? \nCan I merge #7 and #1? \n... #1, 6 and 7? \nUgh. Help please.\n\nA: ChromeOS has quite a different partitioning scheme than other OS'es. It uses 2 ROOT & KERNEL partitions (2,3,4,& 5), one pair active, one pair inactive. When a ChromeOS update comes along, it's loaded on the inactive KERN/ROOT partitions and, after a reboot, it switches to the alternate pair. This way, the system can automagically switch back to the inactive pair if something goes awry.\nThe user's space is obtained from the STATE partition and is for all users files, settings, etc. which includes the Downloads folder for each user where everything is stored. This is what you're referring to as your / directory.\nWhen ChrUbuntu was installed on your system (it uses partitions 6 & 7 for the KERN & ROOT partitions) and takes the needed/specified space from partition 1 / STATE. On your system, only 4GB of space was left in the STATE partition for all users, which in my opinion isn't enough - especially when you have 320GB to work with.\nI wouldn't attempt to merge partitions 1, 6 & 7 or even partitons 1 & 7 - which would wipe out both ChrUbuntu & ALL of your ChromeOS users. I have tried merging/resizing these before and failed. ChromeOS is pretty picky about it's structure - you can try if you want but please backup up what you can first and have a usb restore stick handy.\nI believe your best bet is to back up everything you can to an external usb stick or sd card and/or Google Drive and then do a full usb restore, a powerwash won't get it since it doesn't repartition anything. Then you can start over and install ChrUbuntu if you like but specify a (much) smaller partition size, you could even safely say 160GB or so and that would be plenty of space for both ChrUbuntu and ChromeOS users.\nI have an Acer C710 also but I replaced the 320GB hard drive with a 128GB SSD and it's a very nice system. I use 'ChrUbuntu' on my system as well as 'crouton' in a special 'separate partiton' branch. This arrangement uses both partitons 7 & 13 so it's pretty unique.

So they need to match if you want to \"combine\" them.\nUsually it is best to format the partitions into unallocated space, then extend the drive which contains the most data.\nBe aware if you are using multiple disks, for an extended partition (a single partition over multiple disks) if one disk fails you lose all of your data. Unless you use a RAID configuration. Just back up your data before you do anything.\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Activate Tp-bat-balance I have a t400 with an ultrabay battery. How do I get this to work?

Looking for an alternative to UbuntuOne, I found that the official Chinese distro, Ubuntu Kylin, has announced a cloud service from Kingsoft KuaiPan, with its own \"customed app\". This sync client is only partially translated into english, but it was quite easy to get 1TB extra: 512GB installing their apk in my Android phone (which I uninstalled as soon as I got the extra storage) and 512GB binding it with wechat (a service I don't use anyhow). It is no doubt a generous amount of free space which derives mainly from a cloud storage war in China.\n\nApart from a slight memory leak, I must acknowledge how well this service integrates in Unity. A screenshot of the KuaiPan folder in Nautilus (note the Ubuntu logo):\n\nProvided that Canonical somehow endorses this service, I can imagine that it is reliable at least to some extent. My natural question is to what degree? Of course, if I were paranoid, I wouldn't share any personal file on any server beyond my sight. However, I'd like to know\n\n\n*\n\n*if KuaiPan provides end-to-end encryption; and\n\n*how this service handles storage and files (i.e. if they have a “master key” to see/open them)\nIn case they don't offer a secure connection, please let me know if there is a way to take advantage of this service, for instance, using it as a backup protected with password.\n\nA: Kuaipan communicates with the servers hosted at http://kuaipan.cn.\nWhile Ubuntu's servers, hosted at http://one.ubuntu.com use 256-bit encryption, Kuaipan uses an unguarded internet connection. Using Kuaipan would be heck as scary for people who upload their personal data to the cloud.\nWhile the promise of 1 TB does look alluring, do note that Kuaipan is hosted in mainland China, not Hong Kong. China's national internet censoring system, often dubbed as the Great Firewall of China, will have access to your data. Hong Kong and Macau, being SARs or Special Administrative Regions fall out of the censoring policy.\nI'd suggest you use something like a VPN to hide your IP from Kuaipan, and not use that 1-2 TB to store sensitive data. Avoid making it your primary cloud service, and specially restrict it's access to your PC as long as their security encryption stays like this.\nP.S. Just because Ubuntu Kylin is bundled with Kuaipan does not mean that Canonical endorses it. You are left to use Kuaipan at your own risk.\nAbout encryption: A screenshot from Safari for iOS. The padlock with the omnibox displays that encryption is available.\nUbuntu One:\nKuaipan: \nYou can try this with any good browser and yet you'll fail to find any encryption on Kuaipan.

I managed to create a bootable USB stick, and to boot the laptop from that.  When offered the choice between \"Try Ubuntu\" and \"Install Ubuntu\" I first chose \"Try\" and was able to try out various features of Ubuntu.  So far, so good.  Then I started again, this time choosing \"Install Ubuntu\", which gave me only two choices: either to Replace XP by Ubuntu (which I don't want), or to do \"Something else\", which sent me to a screen which seemed to be requiring me to partition the disc.  This is no good for me because I know very little about partitions, and anyway don't know how to use this rather enigmatic screen.  I note that the example on the \"Install Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS\" web page suggests that (a) the \"Something else\" choice is for advanced users (clearly not me!), and (b) there should be a 3rd choice: \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows\" (which I assume will create a partition for me).  How do I get access to this third choice?  Any other suggestions?  \nThe hard drive is 149 GB, with 103 GB free space\n\nA: You can simply download Wubi - Windows Installer and make partition from your widows with free space depends your need. And install the wubi.exe from windows, here you can select drive, allocate virtual space as per your need, create username password and finaly install. If you have iso file place it which drive you select for Ubuntu. Else it will download directly from internet. \nIt's the simplest way to install Ubuntu in windows. \n\nA: I did this two weeks ago on my mom's computer. I believe after the 'Something else' you have the choice to install it alongside. Partitions are just ways that your computer logically separates drives (in this case). Simple example: So if you have Drive 1 with 50 GB, you split it into 2 partitions that are the same size, you would have Drive 1 with 25 GB, and Drive 2 with 25 GB. As long as you have room on the drive with XP for Ubuntu, you can partition it safely. You will get a new default boot loader (GRUB), which will let you choose which OS to boot into. \nWith the available space you will be fine doing a 30 GB or more partition and be completely safe. (The file system ext4, will probably be safest)\nNote: After you install Ubuntu, XP will do a system check, with a message like there was a compromise to disk integrity. There wasn't XP just got scared of Ubuntu. (In reality, it had a record of how large the partition was, and noticed the size changed)\nCheck this again: How do I install Ubuntu?  around step 7 or so.\n", "Q: How to start a VirtualBox machine via command line (without GUI)?

Specifically, it looks like openssh-client is being upgraded from p1-5ubuntu1.2 to p1-5ubuntu1.3, but openssh-server is not being upgraded from p1-5ubuntu1.2. They need to both be upgraded at the same time to the same version.\nTry running \"sudo apt-get update\" and seeing if your still have the problem. There may have been a temporary issue with the openssh-server not update being pushed out to your ubuntu apt mirror.\nYou should then be able to run \"sudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client\" without issue; that command actually upgrades those 2 packages (instead of installing them) because they're already installed.

What is the difference between them?\n\nA: From The Linux Documentation Project - 6.6. Linux Password & Shadow File Formats:\n\nTraditional Unix systems keep user account information, including\none-way hashed passwords, in a text file called /etc/passwd. As this\nfile is used by many tools (such as ls) to display file ownerships,\netc. by matching user id #'s with the user's names, the file needs to\nbe world-readable. Consequentally, this can be somewhat of a security\nrisk.\nAnother method of storing account information, one that I always use,\nis with the shadow password format. As with the traditional method,\nthis method stores account information in the /etc/passwd file in a\ncompatible format. However, the password is stored as a single \"x\"\ncharacter (ie. not actually stored in this file). A second file,\ncalled /etc/shadow, contains encrypted password as well as other\ninformation such as account or password expiration values, etc. The\n/etc/shadow file is readable only by the root account and is therefore\nless of a security risk.\n\n\nA: Short answer: \npasswd stores general user info and shadow stores user passwd info.\nSomewhat longer answer: \npasswd is the file where the user information (like username, user ID, group ID, location of home directory, login shell, ...) is stored when a new user is created. \nshadow is the file where important information (like an encrypted form of the password of a user, the day the password expires, whether or not the passwd has to be changed, the minimum and maximum time between password changes, ...) is stored when a new user is created. \nSome interesting extra info: passwd and shadow\n\nA: /etc/shadow\nfile stores actual password in encrypted format for user's account with additional properties related to user password i.e. it stores secure user account information. All fields are separated by a colon (:) symbol FOR MORE\n/etc/passwd\nfile stores essential information, which is required during login i.e. user account information. /etc/passwd is a text file, that contains a list of the system's accounts, giving for each account some useful information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell, etc. FOR MORE\n", "Q: How can you get the number of the processes where program is started?

How would I do this?\n\nA: (First, a hint to avoid confusion: the way how to solve that has changed in Ubuntu not long ago. When you look around, you will find much information refering to 'changing runlevels', and init or telinit. That's about the outdated method and not useful any more.)\n\nWith the current system, there seems to be no direct replacemet for this, as it does not use the concept of runlevels that way.\nI'll propose two ways how to do it, let me know which of them works best for you:\n\nIf you want to switch off the GUI screen showing the login dialog, sometimes with wallpaper image ( - which is called a greeter in X11 terminology - ), try to shut down the display manager service. It is usually either gdm or lightdm, so\nsudo service lightdm stop might work (use start instead of stop to restore)\n\nThe second way may be obvious for someone who has used it, but I am not sure from the question whether you took that one into account: \nIf it is acceptable for what you want to do, you could keep the GUI running, but hide it while not needed: You have multiple text consoles, and at least one GUI screen that you can use. Use Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to the first text console, and get back later using F7 of F8 instead.\n", "Q: How do you open a terminal?

Trying to install a package built on Ubuntu on a contemporary version of Debian is likely to end up with version errors on libc6.\nAccording to https://superuser.com/questions/407745/wrong-libc6-version-in-debian-squeeze-can-i-go-back Debian squeeze had libc6 2.11 . According to http://web.archive.org/web/20110705212424/http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libc6 ubuntu 10.04 lucid also had libc6 2.11 . So the packages for 10.4 lucid are IMO the most likely to work on Squeeze.\nDepending on what other libraries your program needs you may well find that a specific build for Debian squeeze is needed.\n\nA: In addition to what was said,\nNote that a package from an APT-based distribution (e.g. Ubuntu) should not be installed in another APT-based distribution (e.g. Debian), as default.

Does vim.gnome binary knows what was linking to it when executed, somehow?\n(by the way, same issue is with vimdiff)\nDo you have an explanation for that?\n\nA: This is explained in man vim:\n\nVim behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the\n  executable may still be the same file).\nvim:     The \"normal\" way, everything is default.\nex: Start  in Ex mode.

Can  also  be\n               done with the \"-Z\" argument.\n\nIn other words, vim will detect the name it was invoked as and act accordingly.

Would the best method be to install the OS on the SSD and then keep all my files on the HDD?\nWhat do you think is the best way to partition my installation, and how would I do so?\n\nA: Basically, This is more about how you use your system. Since you have tagged your question with \"dual boot\", I consider you will have Win7 or Win8 as your second OS. If you do not intend to use Ubuntu as your primary OS or do not want to install too many games/softwares then meeting the minimum Ubuntu Requirement+3GB on SSD will be enough for you.\nNote, Software like Browser (Firefox) office suite (LibreOffice) is already included in the minimum requirement. In my opinion 10GB will be more than enough.\nWindows8: 16GB (min. requirement) + 6GB-10 GB (for user files and software)\nUbuntu: 5GB (min. requirement) + 3GB-5GB (for user files and software)\nCheck this:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements\nand http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/system-requirements\nYou should install softwares to HDD, which you don't use regularly or need storage in GB. Also move all user files like music, docs to HDD.\n\nA: Here are the 2 cases I that I have tried when using an SSD and an HDD:\nWindows + Ubuntu Case - I am assuming you have Windows on the SSD which is taking some part of the 32 GB space and the 500 is used to store other files. So the best thing would be, if you are able to get from the SSD at least 8 GB to 16 GB is to install Ubuntu in the SSD (Share it with Windows) but since you will only have a small amount of space, you will need to either start moving heavy files to the 500 GB HDD or to set the /home in a partition in the 500 GB (something like 100 GB for it or more). So it would look something like this:\nSDA (32 GB SSD)\n/sda1 - Windows\n/sda2 - Windows Boot or something Windowish\n/sda3 - Ubuntu (With or without /home)\n/sda4 - Swap\n\nSDB (500 GB HDD)\n/sdb1 - Huge backup space\n/sdb2 - Ubuntu \"/home\" in case you want to download torrents, music, videos, games and not worry about going out of space for a while.\n\nUbuntu Only Case - If you only want to use Ubuntu, then install it on the SSD for the same reason as the Windows + Ubuntu scenario. The speed that the SSD will offer will save you time when booting, loading system files and more. Of course 32 GB is not much if you start downloading huge files but then again, you have enough space left to move files to the 500 GB whenever you feel you have little space left.\nThe benefit in general of having the root filesystem / in the SSD is the speed enhancement that the SSD will offer the boot process, the system files and more. The only limit is the amount of files you will be adding which most will be found in the /home. So, at the end, if you use a lot of files, or download a lot of files, it would be better to put /home in the 500 GB HDD and the system in the SSD.\n", "Q: Fn keys not working I wanted to give Lubuntu a try.

Then select the Regional Formats tab and change it to your liking.\nIf you want to install e.g. Albanian, select the Language tab and click the Install / Remove Languages... button.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu provide patched version of openssl for 12.10? 12.10 is right at end of life in April 2014. \n\nA: Yes, here's the changelog for the openssl package in 12.10 showing the Heartbleed fix released on April 7.\n", "Q: Disk failure imminent I have been using Win7 ubuntu 12.04 dual boot laptop and one day I got Disk failure imminent message in ubuntu.I have been using Win 7 since then for about 2 months now and havent experienced anything problematic but it is not letting me boot in Ubuntu.What should I do?\n\nA: The error message is initiated not by Ubuntu but by the HDD manufacturer's SMART (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology System). In all probability, it is what it says: you'll need to replace your HDD soon.\n1) Backup your data. Just do it.\n2) You can access the SMART reporting data: either use a Windows util (need to know your HDD brand) or run the \"Disks\" GUI utility from the Ubuntu Live DVD. Not sure knowing the exact problem will help though.\n", "Q: Password-less Ubuntu install? When you run Ubuntu as a live boot you are able to install programs etc. without a password, but when you have installed it you have to choose a password and you have to put it in everytime you want to do something system critical. Can you make an install without any kind of password? I am very aware that it is a lot more safe to have the password, i´m just curious :)\n\nA: Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Linux kernel, you require a root (or just user, in the case of sudo) password to install any programs or do anything possibly dangerous to the system.\nThis doesn't apply to Live CDs, because of the easily recoverable nature of Live CDs. You mess up a Live CD, you can just reburn it. You mess up an installation on a hard drive though, not so easy.\n\nA: (Warning of potential problem with this answer while investigating: this technically did work, but possibly caused or triggered a bigger problem later on; See comment.)\nIt should be possible to set an empty password for your user, and for root too. You may need to be root to set the empty password, even for your own user.\nTo remove the current password of myuser by replacing it with an empty password, you can use:\npasswd -d myuser\n\nImportant warning:\nWhile the above does what we asked it for, that change would cause problems soon. We also need to run: \npam-config -a --unix2-nullok\n\nto make other security components to not reject the unusual empty password setting.\nTo make password-less login work in the GUI login screen, the user needs to be added to the group nopasswdlogin: Enable empty password login\nusermod -a -G nopasswdlogin myuser\nIf interested in some extra details, here is someone making a similar change manually, by replacing text in configuration files.\nManual no-password setup\nAnd if you want sudo to work see here Execute sudo without Password?\n\nAs always, have backups!\n", "Q: vsftpd ubuntu 13.10 login incorrect I can't login to my vsftpd server - I am getting error 530 Login incorrect.

There is an extra browser in ubuntu 14.04 other than Firefox, \"the browser app\" which looks like a mobile browser. \nIt also has an earth shaped icon.It is not like a traditional browser.

Some help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The browser app was being developed since starting of 2013. From Ubuntu 14.04, it will be available as system app. \nYou may find more information about this app from launchpad: https://launchpad.net/webbrowser-app\nTry Alt+F4 to close the browser.\n\nA: Closing a tab: {activity=>long press on the opened tabs}Do a long press on the opened tabs(its a long left click) then red coloured into marks will apppear, this way you can close it, if you don' t wanna close it, again do a long press on the open tabs.\nPrivate browsing: I haven't figured that out (or) it does not seem to exist on this one.\nStill direct download is not working & I cant select text.(how ever I have filed a bug) \n", "Q: Downloading and burning a live CD Can I download and burn a live cd on my laptop then use that cd to install an os on my mothers desktop? Thank you.\n\nA: Yes, you can. Just be sure that the OS you want to use fits on the medium you're trying to install it on. For example, the latest versions of Ubuntu do not fit on a CD, and require either a DVD or USB drive. Also be sure the computer you wish to install on meets the necessary system requirements for the operating system.\n", "Q: How can I have an application automatically display on all desktops with openbox? Is it possible to use wmctrl or something else to make a specific window automatically display on all desktops? \nI use the Prime Player Google Play Music miniplayer Chrome extension to control music playback. I already have a bash alias I can invoke to make the miniplayer stay on top of other windows, but I want to also have it send the miniplayer window to all desktops so I don't have to right-click and select Send to Desktop → All Desktops (via openbox). \nIdeally, I would have a script run something in the background and as soon as it detects the miniplayer window it puts it on top and sends to all desktops. Is this possible?\n\nA: You can actually do this without a third party script. Openbox supports an extensive range of per-application settings.\nCreating an app-specific rule\nApplication rules are matched against different properties like the window name, class, role or title. Most of these properties can be obtained for a specific window by running \nobxprop | grep \"^_OB_APP\"\n\nand clicking on the window in question.\nSeeing how you are planning to specify the rule for a Chrome extension window you might want to supply as many matching properties as possible so as to make the rule as specific as possible. You don't want it to apply to all Chrome windows. Try out different matching properties and see what works best for you.\nHaving defined the matching window you can set different properties that will exclusively apply to the window/application in question. Here's an excerpt of the default rc.xml which describes all available properties:\n# each rule element can be left out or set to 'default' to specify to not \n# change that attribute of the window\n\n<decor>yes</decor>\n# enable or disable window decorations\n\n<shade>no</shade>\n# make the window shaded when it appears, or not\n\n<position force=\"no\">\n  # the position is only used if both an x and y coordinate are provided\n  # (and not set to 'default')\n  # when force is \"yes\", then the window will be placed here even if it\n  # says you want it placed elsewhere.  this is to override buggy\n  # applications who refuse to behave\n  <x>center</x>\n  # a number like 50, or 'center' to center on screen. use a negative number\n  # to start from the right (or bottom for <y>), ie -50 is 50 pixels from\n  # the right edge (or bottom). use 'default' to specify using value\n  # provided by the application, or chosen by openbox, instead.\n  <y>200</y>\n  <monitor>1</monitor>\n  # specifies the monitor in a xinerama setup.\n  # 1 is the first head, or 'mouse' for wherever the mouse is\n</position>\n\n<size>\n  # the size to make the window.\n  <width>20</width>\n  # a number like 20, or 'default' to use the size given by the application.\n  # you can use fractions such as 1/2 or percentages such as 75% in which\n  # case the value is relative to the size of the monitor that the window\n  # appears on.\n  <height>30%</height>\n</size>\n\n<focus>yes</focus>\n# if the window should try be given focus when it appears. if this is set\n# to yes it doesn't guarantee the window will be given focus. some\n# restrictions may apply, but Openbox will try to\n\n<desktop>1</desktop>\n# 1 is the first desktop, 'all' for all desktops\n\n<layer>normal</layer>\n# 'above', 'normal', or 'below'\n\n<iconic>no</iconic>\n# make the window iconified when it appears, or not\n\n<skip_pager>no</skip_pager>\n# asks to not be shown in pagers\n\n<skip_taskbar>no</skip_taskbar>\n# asks to not be shown in taskbars. window cycling actions will also\n# skip past such windows\n\n<fullscreen>yes</fullscreen>\n# make the window in fullscreen mode when it appears\n\n<maximized>true</maximized>\n# 'Horizontal', 'Vertical' or boolean (yes/no)\n\nIn your specific case you will be interested in specifying the layer and desktop of the application. Here's an example of a rule that would designate all windows of a specific application to be always on top and omnipresent on all available desktops:\n<application name=\"miniplayer\" class=\"miniplayer\" type=\"normal\">\n  <layer>above</layer>\n  <desktop>all</desktop>\n</application>\n\nI chose an arbitrary application name and class for this example. As stated before you will have to make sure to find the correct values for your specific application.\n\nEdit: I looked into your specific application and came up with a rule that works on my system:\n<application name=\"crx_npngaakpdgeaajbnidkkginekmnaejbi\" class=\"Google-chrome\" type=\"normal\" role=\"pop-up\">\n  <layer>above</layer>\n  <desktop>all</desktop>\n</application>\n\nI hope this works for you as well.\n\nModifiying your openbox configuration to add an app specific rule\nTo add an application rule open your openbox rc.xml (found under ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml for stock openbox or ~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml for LXDE) and navigate to the <applications> section at the very end of the file. \nInsert your application specific rules between the <applications>..</applications> tags. Then save the file and proceed to reload the configuration by executing:\nopenbox --reconfigure\n\nThe application specific rules should be in effect after this and will automatically get  applied to newly spawned windows.\n\nA: Found more general solution using Python 2.7 and library python-wnck.\nIf interested in details check this and this\nIf not just do this steps. Steps 1-2 should be already done in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*install python2.7. sudo apt-get install python2.7\n\n*install python-wnck. sudo apt-get install python-wnck\n\n*create file stick_player.py. touch stick_player.py\n\n*add python shebang. \n\necho '#!'which python > stick_player.py\n\n\n\n*make it executable. chmod +x stick_player.py\n\n*paste this script in stick_player.py. It should look like\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport wnck\n\nscreen = wnck.screen_get_default()\nscreen.force_update()\n\nfor win in screen.get_windows():\n    if win.get_name() == 'Prime Player':\n        win.stick()\n\n\n\n\n*run your player in new window. In my case window name was \"Prime Player\". If it is not let me know.\n\n*run script. ./stick_player.py\n\nIf you also want to undo \"visible on all workspaces\" do this. make steps 3-7 again, but.\n\n\n*create file unstick_player.py. touch unstick_player.py\n\n*add python shebang. \n\necho '#!'which python > unstick_player.py\n\n\n\n*make it executable. chmod +x unstick_player.py\n\n*change last line from win.stick() to win.unstick()\n\n*run script. ./unstick_player.py\n\nAlso\nYou can find all your windows names using this script:\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport wnck\n\nscreen = wnck.screen_get_default()\nscreen.force_update()\n\nfor win in screen.get_windows():\n    print win.get_name()\n\n\n", "Q: Crash in systemd-shim Today we installed Ubuntu 13.10.

sad to have to change my laptop after less than a year\n\nEDIT: Here's a screenshot of my task manager too. No process goes higher than 6%, but processor can easily reach 100%:\n\nAnd here are two screenshots taken consecutively:\n1.\"cache memory considered free\" unchecked\n2.\"cache memory considered free\" checked\n1.\n\n2.\n\n\nA: Open a terminal. issue the command\nfree\n\nThis will provide you with output that looks like this \nusage is at top of picture.\nIf swap usage is high this may be why your system is slow. Many laptops have slower hard drives 4200-5400 RPM in order to use less power and increase battery life. since swap is typical on a partition on the drive and often at the tail end where performance is worst this can cause poor performance. Also if the drive is beginning to fail, it will automatically retry several times to read difficult to read data, causing further delays. \nIf power levels are low, many laptops will also reduce CPU speed (power mangement).\nOptions to increase performance are many and the right answer varies with identifying where the bottleneck actually is. \n1) If the drive is slow you may wish to replace it with a faster one (say 7200 RPM). \n2)If the drive is failing you should replace it, again if a faster one than the original is available you may wish to go that route. \n3)SSD's are much faster than HDD's. (with seek times at a small fraction of a millisecond) This is also an option. Adding more RAM to your laptop may also be a possibility. \nfree also provides info on the amount of RAM installed and if your laptop supports more you could \n4)Install more RAM which would result in less swapping to disk which will also help performance.\nNote that all of these options also apply to desktop systems.\n\nA: As strange as it may seem, what solved the problem for me was installing Compiz on top of Lubuntu.\nI have an old Acer Aspire 5670 with a dedicated 512Mb ATI video card, and since ATI dropped support for their native driver in Linux, I've been struggling for years until the community released a good-enough open source driver.\nWhat happened with Lubuntu was that it wasn't using the video card at all - and rendering all UI on CPU. Compiz immediately solved this problem. I use wobbly windows and some cool effects, and it performs WAY better (and even more stable) than a crude Lxde.\n=== EDIT ===\nI've gained even more performance by using metacity instead. It seems to use the available resources provided by my video card correctly, but it's lighter and more stable than Compiz.\nSo, if you want to try a dead-simple way to boost your Lubuntu, just do:\nsudo apt-get install metacity\nThen set it as the default window manager: go to Preferences->Default applications for LXSession->Core applications and set \"metacity\" in the \"Window Manager\" field (instead of openbox).\nNow you can save, then log out and log back in to activate it. Or, if you don't want to restart, just type metacity --replace & 2>&1 in a terminal to activate it instantly.\n=== EDIT 2 ===\nYou can improve it even further by decreasing swapiness to 10.\n", "Q: Control sound permissions, revoke access to audio I would like to control permissions to use sound card. There are devices \"/dev/snd/*\", the owner is \"root\", group is \"audio\", permissions \"660\". So, I would expect only users in \"audio\" group could use sound card, however it doesn't work. I have a user \"u1\" which is not in group \"audio\", however he has access! I've found out that the access is controlled with ACL, so getfacl shows the following:\n# file: timer\n# owner: root\n# group: audio\n# flags: --t\nuser::rw-\nuser:u1:rw-\ngroup::rw-\nmask::rw-\nother::---\n\nThe line \"user:u1:rw-\" magically appears again even if I remove it with setfacl.\nFor me it looks like that there is a root-owned process which automatically adds permissions to any user ignoring \"audio\" group membership.\nWhy is the access granted? How to revoke access to sound card for a user?\n\nA: Check System\nTo enable ACL, the filesystem must be mounted with the acl option.\nIt is very likely that the ACL option is already active as default mount option of your filesystem. Check typing (replace sdXY with correct partition):\nsudo tune2fs -l /dev/sdXY | grep \"Default mount options\"\n\nthe output should be something like:\nDefault mount options:    user_xattr acl\n\nalso check that the default mount option is not overridden, in such case you will see noacl in /proc/mounts in the relevant line. Type:\nsudo cat /proc/mounts | grep noacl\n\nIf you need, you can set the default mount options of a filesystem using the tune2fs -o option partition command, for example:\n tune2fs -o acl /dev/sdXY\n\nUsing ACL:\nto modify ACL use setfacl:\nsetfacl -m \"u:username:permissions\n\nor\nsetfacl -m \"u:uid:permissions\n\nfor example, to revoke access to sound card for a user, type:\nsetfacl -m \"u:u1:---\" /dev/snd/controlC0 \n\nYou can easily try if it works, putting playing an audio track and then executing the command: if the sound is interrupted, the command has been executed\nYou can also check if the permissions have been changed with:\ngetfacl /dev/snd/controlC0 ( Control Interface /dev/snd/controlCX )\n\nRefer to manual man acl and  man setfacl for more options.\n\nA: The ACL for sound devices (and other \"seat\" devices) is controlled by the seat management service. For Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) and older this was done by the ConsoleKit service. For later versions this is replaced with systemd-logind. This Ubuntu knowledge base article explains the reasoning.\nTechnically you can remove devices from the seat definition, by either changing udev rules (remove the \"seat\" from devices) or by removing them from the seat manager device database using the D-Bus API (all these is from systemd-logind - I have no idea how this relates to ConsoleKit), but I can't think of a way to prevent just one specific logged in local user from gaining access to devices, while other local logged in user do get access to devices.\n", "Q: WIFI connection not working I ran these commands:\nsudo rmmod iwlwif\nsudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\nsudo su\necho \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n\nNow, my WiFi connection is lost and there is no WiFi option in the network manager.\nHow can I restore it?\n\nA: First of all, why did you run these commands? Anyway, the last one sets up the 11n_disable=1 option for the iwlwifi driver. Presumably this is what is breaking your system so, just open the file /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n\nFind this line:\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\nAnd delete it. Then reboot (not needed but it is the simplest approach). Your WiFi settings should now be back to the way they were before you broke them. I am assuming that you did all this to try and solve another issue and suggest that you might want to post a new question explaining that issue and asking for help about that.\n", "Q: When to upgrade/install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I am using Ubuntu 13.10, and looking forward for the launch of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Please suggest me how should I upgrade to 14.04 LTS?  \n\nA: I have been running both 12.04 LTS and 13.10 for some time.\nThe recent Ubuntu versions (12.10, 13.04, and 13.10) have not always been stable (graphics drivers, obscure USB devices, CD/DVD playback, etc.). There have generally been no such issues with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nInitial testing (last 10 days) suggest that (apart from a few glitches on new features) this upcoming release will be as good as 12.04 LTS.\nWait three more weeks, and then migrate (or do a fresh install).\n\nA: The proper way is to set the option of upgrading to new releases in your software settings.\nOpen the Software Centre and go to the Edit menu. Click 'software sources' and then the 'updates' tab. Set 'Notify me of a new Ubuntu version' to 'For any new version' and, with luck, your upgrade will go ok as part of normal updates.\nHere's some advise on upgrading from Ubuntu :\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades\nIt is probably wise to download 14.04 onto a dvd or usb before you attempt the upgrade, just in case you need to do a fresh install. So, like the page says, make sure you back up any valuable data.\n", "Q: A small problem at laptop-mode-tool vas@LenovoZ580:~$ sudo laptop_mode\n[sudo] password for vas: \nLaptop mode \nenabled, not active [unchanged]\n\nWhat Does it mean?\nI had TLP and have removed it and the problem wasn't solved.

I rather not edit my code to look for other fonts.\n\nA: The Helvetica from Adobe fonts are not ttf so it's likely that it will be very ugly. You may replace them with something similar to Helvetica like fonts-freefont-ttf package, or use sans-serif, as described in the Debian FAQ:\nnano -w ~/.fonts.conf\n\nThis will create the fonts file, now just put the following:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?> \n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n\n<fontconfig>\n\n<!-- Helvetica is a non true type font, and will look bad.

I recently installed the OpenVpn-Access Server on a vps and it's great. However, now that I got it running I want to switch over to the Community-Edition because I do not want to deal with purchasing licenses and I think the C.E. will do everything I need it to.  I was wondering if anyone knows if there a simple way to switch from AS to CE and keep my current configuration settings without having to reinstall the whole thing and regenerate the keys&certificates? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: This is an old question, but I would like to answer it in case someone else is trying to do the same thing. To switch from OpenVPN-AS to the community edition and keep the same configuration, the server.crt, server.key, dh.pem, and ca.crt used on the Access Server need to be referenced in the new community edition server.conf file. Since by default, A.S. uses pam authentication for dual authentication, the new C.E. server must be configured this way as well. These lines need to be added to the server.conf:\nplugin /usr/share/openvpn/plugin/lib/openvpn-auth-pam.so openvpn\n\nThen the file /etc/pam.d/openvpn needs to be created, with these lines:\nauth       sufficient   /lib/security/pam_radius_auth.so debug\naccount    sufficient    /lib/security/pam_radius_auth.so\n\nAny other options defined in the A.S. generated config need to be referenced in the server.conf file as well (such as port number, proto, com-lzo, cipher, etc). Since I could not figure out where or how those files are stored when using access server, I opted to simply uninstall openvpn-as, and start over.\nIn conclusion, I decided to rebuild the configuration from scratch because it was easier, and also made sense to learn how to properly deploy a community edition openvpn server myself. I opted to not use PAM authentication, and rather use easyrsa3 to set up the server and client certificates, using a separate machine as the certificate authority for enhanced security. I also used the tls auth option (incorporating a 'ta.key', as an HMAC firewall to help prevent denial of service attacks). \nMy advice to anyone wanting to switch from the Access Server to the Community Edition is to start from scratch, uninstall A.S. and install the openvpn package, generate new certificates and keys, and most importantly, use a separate machine to sign the certificate requests. \n", "Q: Access to Ubuntu I am a novice, so need simple instructions.

The new apt command, present in Ubuntu since 14.04, seems to be a really useful intersection of functionality between apt-get and apt-cache but the current version of bash-completion doesn't know about it... Which makes it a lot harder to use.\nIs there a quick way to add this functionality to Bash to make the apt command easy to use?\n\nA: This is an omission in the bash-complete package, not apt. It just seems a completion doesn't exist yet, so I've scrapped together what I can for the apt command (it's not the best documented command that's ever existed!)\nThe following is an adaptation from the existing apt-get completion (with elements stripped out and bits added from apt-cache's completion).

Then apt show firef + Tab should complete.\nThis may offer you options that just don't exist any more. I think I've nailed the main commands (which might change in time) but at the very least it'll help you with the common commands: list search show update install remove upgrade full-upgrade edit-sources dist-upgrade purge.\nObviously, if a bash-completion maintainer wants to nab the above, you're welcome to it under GPL (though I'd be tempted to start from fresh once apt is documented!)\n\nA: Why not use the original bash-completion? \nTry this script.

Uninstall the original bash-completion, so you wouldn't end up loading both at the same time.\n", "Q: Rhythm box crashes when I plug in my iphone I've just downloaded ubuntu as a swap from mint.

E.g. you've likely got a folder called TFTPROOT/ubuntu-installer. However, the proper kernel and init file for netboot are(for me) contained in DVDISO/install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64.

I changed to ubuntu one 13.10 yesterday. I thought ubuntu might be much faster. It is so very very slow. What can b the problem? I used an USB to install ubuntu on my laptop (32 bit). This actually worked out good. Maybe my laptop is too old? It is an acer aspire 5610. I used win xp professional on it which was okay.\nNow the new graphical designs move around super slow. Like the windows take long to open, everything is in slow motion. Even when I drag and drop items from external flesh drives on my desktop- sometimes they don't even want to be moved at all.

Note that Ubuntu needs more performance than Win XP.\nIf RAM is even lower than 1 GB, it is better to take another *buntu. Even with 1 GB your system will be slow with Ubuntu. Best will be Lubuntu. This variant is made for old hardware like your. The variant is not \"weaker\" than Ubuntu, but it fits to older CPUs and lower RAM size. There is e. g. no 3D-graphics in the desktop integrated. Lubuntu is much more like Win XP concerning the performance of the system. As a last remark: It's not true that Linux generally has lower hardware needs than Windows.

Note that only an image is bootable. With a copy your comp can't boot from the disc! Nearly every burning program has the option to burn an image instead of make a copy, but you have to choose this option befor burning. I'm not sure if your expression \"put it on disc\" really mean \"burning an image\".\nSecond, you have to change the BIOS options of your comp: It has to boot first from the CD or DVD drive. Often the setting is to boot first from the harddisk. You find the boot options in the BIOS settings of your comp. You have to entry the BIOS during the booting (often with the DEL key, but it's normally shown below on the boot screen what key to press). Then you have to go to the boot options (normally all options are on the top of the BIOS setting as a bar). Then you have to change the boot order (often by the arrow keys, but it's shown normally on the right of the screen). Please note you have to save the new configuration of the BIOS after the change (often by F10-key, but this is shown too on the right).\nAfter that, you comp will boot from a disc if there is a bootable image on it. \nYou can test ubuntu first as a live system, without any change of your comp. If you are sure to install Ubuntu, you can beginn the installing.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Firstly, you will have to create a bootable CD/DVD. you can use nero or any other software you like(you can also create a bootable pen-drive using YUMI from pendrivelinux.com)\nthen insert the storage device in your system and restart it.\nNow on a screen you will see something written like : Press ..... for .....\nfrom those, press the button for boot order and then from there choose CD/DVD or USB device (whichever you have created).\nNow you will get option of firstly trying Ubuntu an then install or directly install.\nchoose as per your convinience.

Am I missing something here?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It looks great, but my only concern would be your Micrcosoft Reserved Partition (MSR) partition which should be immediately after your UEFI System Partition (ESP). \n\nIf you want to be a perfectionist the MSR should also be 128 Mb (megabytes), not 128 MiB (mebibytes). I wouldn't bother getting that specific though. I believe Microsoft incorrectly refers to megabytes so your sizing should actually be correct anyways. However if you have a Windows installation or Windows installation disc you could verify your MSR shows up as the correct size in megabytes under Windows. You can do this in the Windows terminal by typing \"diskpart\" which is a cli partitioning tool. Then \"select disk0\", and \"list partitions\". \nKeep in mind that unless you are using software that is designed to use hidden sectors you don't actually need an MSR. I personally don't bother with it, but if you're not sure then it's best to have one.\nYou may also want to create a 100 Mb System partition which would come before the MSR.\nThere is a section on MSR partitions here:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn640535%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\nInformation about Microsofts recommened partition setup (System Partition, ESP, MSR, and etc):\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd799232%28v=ws.10%29.aspx#SystemPartitions\n\nA: It is vital for all systems running Windows 8 in UEFI mode to have fast boot and hibernated shutdown turned off, as well as fast boot in the UEFI.  This keeps you from losing data on your Windows install.\nThis is the most proper way I have found to do a Dual Boot with UEFI and GPT.\nFirst off, you cannot run dual boot configuration with Windows 7/8 in UEFI and any *nix in CSM.  Grub will not be able to see the Windows 7/8 installation (in my experience).  Either way:\nIf you want Ubuntu on the same disk as Windows 7/8, here are the steps to go through:\n1) Install Windows first.  Then, Turn off Windows Fast Boot\n2) Windows expects a certain partition scheme to be used.  Let me show you a diagram:\n[(Windows RE Tools[Optional])(EFI System Partition)(Microsoft Reserved Partition[may be omitted after installation following a nasty procedure])(Windows 7/8)(Anything else)]\nYou can use your favorite tool to edit the Windows 7/8 install partition.  I prefer Gparted, but any good disk partitioning tool can handle this.  Backup your Windows install first.  Then, resize the Windows 8.1 partition so that you have enough space for another OS.  I prefer to give my Linux installs about 50-100 GB of space (for expandability).\n3)  Download your Ubuntu (use 64 bit only and I suggest 13.10) iso and put it on some media (CD/DVD/USB/(insert your preferred media here)) by using your favorite tool (most people prefer Rufus) or dd.\n4) Shut off Secure Boot and Fast Boot in the UEFI.  DO NOT TURN ON LEGACY BOOTING (if your motherboard supports UEFI only booting without Secure Boot and Fast Boot on.)\n5) Insert your install media and install Ubuntu in the partition you made earlier.  Make sure that for your EFI boot partition, you make the installer use the EFI System Partition already created by Windows 8.1.  The partition should be something like sdXn (replace X with the drive it is on and n with the partition number, such as /dev/sda2), but this could be different.  DO NOT REFORMAT THIS PARTITION!!  You are only going to tell the installer to use it as the EFI partition.  It will put the grubx64.efi bootloader for Ubuntu in this location.  \n6) With that done, continue the install as normal and set up your partitions as you see fit.  Once the install is finished, you should be able to boot into Jessie easily.  \nIf you are trying to fix an existing install of Ubuntu, you will need to do:\nsudo apt-get install grub-efi-amd64\nsudo modprobe efivars\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdx (x being the drive Ubuntu is installed on)\nsudo update-grub\nFrom there, the UEFI should use Grub-EFI as the bootloader. I have not found a way to get the Windows 8 bootloader to see and allow Linux to boot in UEFI.  YYMV.\n\nA: \nshouldn't I leave some free space at the end of the disk then? Am I missing something here?\n\nNo; the space used by the partition table itself is invisible and the partitioner will not let you try to use it.\n", "Q: Terminal - Cycle through possible options In the terminal I use bind '\"\\t\":menu-complete' to auto complete my commands using the Tab key.\nIf I hit the Tab key again, it shows the next choice.\nSometimes I miss the entry and I have to go through the whole list again.\nIt would be nice if I could cycle backwards using Shift + Tab.\nIs that possible?\n\nA: So I saw this post to help with a similar concept that might answer your question, hopefully it works on your OS:\nHow to make terminal autocomplete when there are several files/directory?\n", "Q: Enable Networking I'm trying ubuntu on an HP atom mini-laptop.

Presumably sda is your SSD and consists of / and /mnt/SSDData in that order? If so, then remove the second-last line of /etc/fstab. (And clean it up as per my above instructions.)\nAlso, the third last line of /etc/fstab makes reference to 13b5fbd9-9f8e-495e-abe8-36dec9db8e9d, which is not in blkid. OTOH, there are some extra partitions in blkid that are not in /etc/fstab, so I'm not sure if you wanted to change that /etc/fstab to the proper UUID, or just delete it.\n\nA: You did not update the uuid for your swap partition, and instead of updating the uuid for the other one, you added a duplicate entry.\n", "Q: Issue using Node.js / Express, Says it's not installed I am having the same issue this this person had.\nnpm installed packages are not accessible\nWhere the command \"express nodepad\" does not work.

Notice that the script will call itself in the background and exit and only if the rootfs is \"rw\" will call the right mounting script. The script \"/home/pi/bin/usb-automount.sh\" does the actual mounting or in your case the logging.\nNote this script still takes 3 seconds to execute, so you may further optimize by changing to:\nif [ -z \"$ROOT_RW\" ]; then\n ( sleep 3; /home/pi/bin/usb-automount ) & disown\nelse\n /home/pi/bin/usb-automount.sh\nfi\n\nHowever I never checked that and do not know if this will work as expected (I am no scripting guru).\n\nA: As mentioned by others, the processes started by udev's RUN= directive should be short-running.

I tried all the normal approaches to graphics problems, resetting unity (I know gnome fallback doesn't use it but whatever), and removing and re-installing all the xorg drivers.

When I run these two commands, I get\n$ type cd\ncd is a shell builtin\n$ type if\nif is a shell keyword\n\nIt is clearly shown that cd is a shell builtin and if is a shell keyword. So what is the difference between shell builtin and keyword?\n\nA: There's a strong difference between a builtin and a keyword, in the way Bash parses your code. Before we talk about the difference, let's list all keywords and builtins:\nBuiltins:\n$ compgen -b\n.         :         [         alias     bg        bind      break     \nbuiltin   caller    cd        command   compgen   complete  compopt   \ncontinue  declare   dirs      disown    echo      enable    eval      \nexec      exit      export    false     fc        fg        getopts   \nhash      help      history   jobs      kill      let       local     \nlogout    mapfile   popd      printf    pushd     pwd       read      \nreadarray readonly  return    set       shift     shopt     source    \nsuspend   test      times     trap      true      type      typeset   \nulimit    umask     unalias   unset     wait                          \n\nKeywords:\n$ compgen -k\nif        then      else      elif      fi        case      \nesac      for       select    while     until     do        \ndone      in        function  time      {         }         \n!         [[        ]]        coproc              \n\nNotice that, for example [ is a builtin and that [[ is a keyword. I'll use these two to illustrate the difference below, since they are well-known operators: everybody knows them and uses them regularly (or should).\nA keyword is scanned and understood by Bash very early in its parsing. This allows for example the following:\nstring_with_spaces='some spaces here'\nif [[ -n $string_with_spaces ]]; then\n    echo \"The string is non-empty\"\nfi\n\nThis works fine, and Bash will happily output\nThe string is non-empty\n\nNote that I didn't quote $string_with_spaces. Whereas the following:\nstring_with_spaces='some spaces here'\nif [ -n $string_with_spaces ]; then\n    echo \"The string is non-empty\"\nfi\n\nshows that Bash isn't happy:\nbash: [: too many arguments\n\nWhy does it work with keywords and not with builtins? because when Bash parses the code, it sees [[ which is a keyword, and understands very early that it's special. So it will look for the closing ]] and will treat the inside in a special way. A builtin (or command) is treated as an actual command that is going to be called with arguments. In this last example, bash understands that it should run the command [ with arguments (shown one per line):\n-n\nsome\nspaces\nhere\n]\n\nsince variable expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion and word splitting occurs. The command [ turns out to be built in the shell, so it executes it with these arguments, which results in an error, hence the complaint.\nIn practice, you see that this distinction allows for sophisticated behavior, that wouldn't be possible with builtins (or commands).\nStill in practice, how can you possibly distinguish a builtin from a keyword? this is a fun experiment to perform:\n$ a='['\n$ $a -d . ]\n$ echo $?\n0\n\nWhen Bash parses the line $a -d . ], it sees nothing special (i.e., no aliases, no redirections, no keywords), so it just performs variable expansion. After variable expansions, it sees:\n[ -d . ]\n\nso executes the command (builtin) [ with arguments -d, . and ], which, of course is true (this only tests whether . is a directory).\nNow look:\n$ a='[['\n$ $a -d . ]]\nbash: [[: command not found\n\nOh. That's because when Bash sees this line, it sees nothing special, and hence expands all variables, and eventually sees:\n[[ -d . ]]\n\nAt this time, alias expansions and keyword scanning has long been performed and is not going to be performed anymore, so Bash tries to find the command called [[, doesn't find it, and complains.\nAlong the same lines:\n$ '[' -d . ]\n$ echo $?\n0\n$ '[[' -d . ]]\nbash: [[: command not found\n\nand\n$ \\[ -d . ]\n$ echo $?\n0\n$ \\[[ -d . ]]\nbash: [[: command not found\n\n\nAlias expansion is something rather special too. You've all done the following at least once:\n$ alias ll='ls -l'\n$ ll\n.... <list of files in long format> ....\n$ \\ll\nbash: ll: command not found\n$ 'll'\nbash: ll: command not found\n\nThe reasoning is the same: alias expansion occurs long before variable expansion and quote removal.\n\nKeyword v.s. Alias\nNow what do you think happens if we define an alias to be a keyword?\n$ alias mytest='[['\n$ mytest -d . ]]\n$ echo $?\n0\n\nOh, it works! so aliases can be used to alias keywords! nice to know.\n\nConclusion: builtins really behave like commands: they correspond to an action being executed with arguments that undergo direct variable expansion and word splitting and globbing. It's really just like having an external command somewhere in /bin or /usr/bin that is called with the arguments given after variable expansion, etc. Note that when I say it's really just like having an external command I only mean with respect to arguments, word splitting, globbing, variable expansion, etc. A builtin can modify the shell's internal state!\nKeywords, on the other hand, are scanned and understood very early, and allow for sophisticated shell behavior: the shell will be able to forbid word splitting or pathname expansion, etc.\nNow look at the list of builtins and keywords and try to figure out why some need to be keywords.\n\n! is a keyword. It seems it would be possible to mimic its behavior with a function:\nnot() {\n    if \"$@\"; then\n        return 1\n    else\n        return 0\n    fi\n}\n\nbut this would forbid constructs like:\n$ ! ! true\n$ echo $?\n0\n\n(in that case, I mean not ! true which doesn't work) or\n$ ! { true; }\necho $?\n1\n\nSame for time: it's more powerful to have it a keyword so that it can time complex compound commands and pipelines with redirections:\n$ time grep '^#' ~/.bashrc | { i=0; while read -r; do printf '%4d %s\\n' \"$((++i))\" \"$REPLY\"; done; } > bashrc_numbered 2>/dev/null\n\nIf time where a mere command (even builtin), it would only see the arguments grep, ^# and /home/gniourf/.bashrc, time this, and then its output would go through the remaining parts of the pipeline. But with a keyword, Bash can handle everything! it can time the complete pipeline, including the redirections! If time were a mere command, we couldn't do:\n$ time { printf 'hello '; echo world; }\n\nTry it:\n$ \\time { printf 'hello '; echo world; }\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `}'\n\nTry to fix (?) it:\n$ \\time { printf 'hello '; echo world;\ntime: cannot run {: No such file or directory\n\nHopeless.\n\nKeyword vs alias?\n$ alias mytime=time\n$ alias myls=ls\n$ mytime myls\n\nWhat do you think happens?\n\nReally, a builtin is like a command, except that it's built in the shell, whereas a keyword is something that allows for sophisticated behavior! we can say it's part of the shell's grammar.\n\nA: The command-line manual that comes with Ubuntu doesn't give a definition of keywords, however the online manual (see sidenote) and POSIX Shell Command Language standard specifications, refer to these as \"Reserved Words\", and both provide lists of those. From the POSIX standard:\n\nThis recognition shall only occur when none of the characters is quoted and when the word is used as:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The first word of a command\n  \n*The first word following one of the reserved words other than case, for, or in\n  \n*The third word in a case command (only in is valid in this case)\n  \n*The third word in a for command (only in and do are valid in this case)\n\nThe key here is that keywords/reserved words have special meaning because they facilitate the shell syntax, serve to signal certain blocks of code such as loops, compound commands, branching ( if/case ) statements, etc. They allow forming command statements, but by themselves - don't do anything, and in fact if you enter keywords such as for, until, case - the shell will expect a complete statement, otherwise - syntax error:\n$ for\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'\n$  \n\nOn source code level, the reserved words for bash are defined in parese.y, while built-ins have whole directory dedicated to them.\nSidenote\nThe GNU index shows [ as reserved word,however it is in-fact built-in command. [[ by contrast is a reserved word. \nSee also: Differences between keyword, reserved word, and builtin?\n\nA: man bash calls them SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS. So, a \"shell builtin\" is just like a normal command, like grep, etc., but instead of being contained in a separate file, it's built into bash itself. This makes them perform more efficiently than external commands.\nA keyword is also \"hard-coded into Bash, but unlike a builtin, a keyword is not in itself a command, but a subunit of a command construct.\" I interpret this to mean that keywords have no function alone, but require commands to do anything.

I've been looking for a while now a way to get the \"click lock\" in ubuntu 13.10 (for dragging) but so far, I have no success. Universal access lacks this feature, and I have not found some program or utility that allows me simulate it.\nAccording to this question, it seems that in ubuntu 10.10 there was no way to get it working, but I wonder if this issue has been addressed in the latest versions.\nWith this command,xte \"mousedown 1\" I get the desired functionality, but still you would need to type the command on a terminal or bind it to a key. Is there a way to get the same functionality by long pressing the button click? \nThanks for any help.\n\nA: What you need is kmousetool.According to man kmousetool,\n\n\nKMouseTool clicks the mouse whenever the mouse cursor pauses briefly.  \nKMouseTool can also be configured to wait for a specified time for a drag to begin, before unclicking the mouse. This way, you can use it for drag and drop operations as well.\n\n\nTo install kmousetool, open a terminal and type\nsudo apt-get install kmousetool\n\nOpen kmousetool and you will see a window like this.\n\nHere enable Smart drag and let the defaults \"as is\" for now. Click Apply and then click Start.

After some googling, I found out that this is probably due to my not having installed my grapic card driver. I attempted to install the default driver, but that didn't work. So I tried installing the one that you can download in the Ubuntu Software Center, but that didn't help either. Finally, I downloaded the \"AMD Catalyst™ 13.12 Proprietary Linux x86 Display Driver\". I may have run it last night, but I couldn't swear on it. Anyway, after trying to install this driver I get this in response: \n\"a previous install of the fglrx driver has been detected. Please uninstall the older version before installing this version. Optionally run the installer with --force option to overwrite the existing driver. Forcing install is not recommended. See /user/share/ati/fglrx-install.log for more details.\".\nAfter checking /user/share/ati/fglrx-install.log, it tells me the exact same thing. I ran this .run the easy way, by just double clicking it—not by running it in the terminal. How could I either a)uninstall the previous version and try installing the driver again, or b) use the --force command in the terminal? Thanks in advance~\n\nA: I recommend that you uninstall the previously installed driver and reinstall a new driver. First you must generate your xorg.conf file. You can do this by :-\nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\nThen you can uninstall the AMD proreitary driver by this command:\nsudo aticonfig --uninstall\n\nThat should work. If it does'nt work and says something like this:\n\nUninstaller for AMD Catalyst ™ Proprietary driver, /usr/share/ati/amd-uninstall.sh, does not exist or cannot be found\n\nthen go to Software center>Edit>Software Sources...>Additional Drivers. Then select your default open source driver. It will probably be the first option in the window and you must select it. See in this image.Note that the window in the image might not be exactly like yours. This image is from my system with AMD Radeon 5570 HD graphic card. \n \nThen you need to restore your Xorg.conf file. Now, use this command:-\nlocate /etc/X11/xorg.conf.original-* \n\nIt may return several paths like :-\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf.original-0\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf.original-1\n\nand many others too. Of these, note down the file with the highest number. In the above case it is /etc/X11/xorg.conf.original-1. Now use stat to confirm existence of the file :-\nstat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.original-1\n\nThen you must copy it over the existing xorg.conf file:-\nsudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.original-1 /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nThus, you can restore your Xorg.conf file. Now reboot your system. You will be using your open source drivers now. \nPS:- After uninstalling your old driver you can install your new driver by following the answer I have given in this question.   \nCredits to the installer notes of AMD website found here.\n", "Q: modem or mobile broadband showing differect ip address my modem or mobile broadband is perfectly connects with internet  but i unable to install anything via terminal  in connection information it shows the IP address 115.243.74.182 but in termainal it shows this connecting to 192.168.100.3 whic is the IP address of wifi provided by college how can i fix it ?? please help me..\n\nA: 192.168.100.3 is your internal IP from the network that you connect to.\nYour external IP is provided by your ISP.

I have a few hundred files named hortstu01-01-14 then hortstu01-02-14... Do you get the idea?\nWell half of the files are named hortstu_01-03-14 then hortstu_01-04-14.\nThis messes up sorting the files by name and getting them in the order I'd prefer them to be.  So I'd like to rename the ones without the underscore to hortstu_  \nIs it possible to do this in a batch operation?  If so how?\n\nA: Or a Bash one liner navigate to the folder with the files and then run this in terminal:\nfor file in hortsu*;do echo \"$file\" \"${file/_/-}\";done;\n\nBasically what this does is for files with the name 'hortsu' followed by any characters '*', echo the name of \"$file\" and also the name of file with all underscores replaced with dashes. When you feel comfortable with that just replace echo with cp to copy the files to the new name.\nA pythonic solution.\nTry this in a safe environement, maybe copy one or two files over to a new folder to test how it works. \nSave the following code in gedit and give it a name with a file extension of '.py' something like rename_files_in_current_directory.py:\n# copy this code into gedit and save it to the directory with the files in it\nimport os\n# for files in the current directory ('.')\nfor file_names in os.listdir('.'):\n    if '_' in file_names:\n        # using os.system use cp (copy) to copy file_names to file-names by replacing\n        # underscore with dash\n        os.system('cp '+file_names+' '+file_names.replace('_','-'))\n\nMake sure python is installed. 'sudo apt-get install python'\nNavigate to the folder in terminal with the script and the files and then run:\npython the_name_given_to_the_python_script.py\n\nNote:\nYou can delete the dashes in the above commands and scripts will remove the underscores.\nfor file in hortsu*;do cp \"$file\" \"${file/_/}\";done;\n\nor in the python script change:\nfile_names.replace('_','-') to file_names.replace('_','')\n\nA: For those who prefer GUI applications or just like the ability to preview the result, you might want to install Thunar. It's the main file manager of XFCE; you find it in the repositories.\nWhen you select multiple files in Thunar and rename them (via context menu or F2), you get an elaborate dialog which support all kinds of rename operations. You can solve your problem like so:\n\n\nA: Open a terminal. Firstly, double check you have the perl rename, by typing man rename. At the bottom, it should say perl v5.18.2 or similar. (I think Ubuntu always ships the perl rename, but other distros ship other versions.)\nIf it's the correct version, then cd to the directory that contains these files. Then run\n rename 's/^hortstu/hortstu_/' hortstu[!_]*\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*This will rename all files that match hortstu[!_]*. This means files that start with hortstu, and do not have _ next.\n\n*It will then rename them by\n\n*\n\n*finding ^hortstu (i.e. hortstu at the beginning of the string)\n\n*replacing it with hortstu_.\n\n\n*N.B. the format for hortstu[!_]* is a bash glob. The format for ^hortstu is a regular expression.\n\n", "Q: Not able to install Ubuntu 12.04 using wubi I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 in my windows machine using Wubi.

Don't forget that you cannot allocate more than 30GB for Ubuntu installation when using wubi installer. It should work fine. You can use wubi installer in the same manner to install inside windows Xubuntu 12.04.4 and also Lubuntu 12.04.4 (better choice for older machines than Ubuntu 12.04.4 which runs in a Gnome session and can create lots of issues after first system upgrade and also after you update your video driver).\n", "Q: Map mouse button to right click I'm looking for a way to map a mouse button to simulate the right click (contextual menu) in Ubuntu 13.10.

So the next my Ubuntu starts, it will execute those commands and mount the Windows file. But my problem is, right now Ubuntu is not installed. I want to run the commands automatically when the Ubuntu gets installed the very first time.\n\nA: You can use a \"preseed file\" to execute commands during Ubuntu installation.

I want to install Ubuntu on this machine.\nIs there any benefit to installing With live dvd compared to Wubi?\n\nA: With WUBI, Ubuntu installs some kind of \"nested\" partition for itself within the main Windows partition, I think. The installation is like installing any other Windows program, which means it can also be uninstalled easily.\nBut since the partition is inside Windows, if something goes wrong with the Windows partition, then Ubuntu won't be able to recover either. And since it's nested, it's also not as stable as an independent partition would be and is more likely to crash after hard reboots. \nThe nesting also makes disk performance slightly slower than an independent partitions, and suspend and hibernate are not supported.\nWUBI is meant mainly for people who want to try out Ubuntu for a while and get comfortable with it before doing a full installation, so if you're sure that you're going to use Ubuntu then it's better to do a proper install from the LiveCD.

Is there any manual way to save the installed updated and packages only, so that i can use them later to install if anything goes wrong and i have to make a fresh install. \nThanks in advance.\nAude Sapere \n\nA: To download the programs only without installing them, you can use the -d option in apt-get like, for example, sudo apt-get -d install firefox. This will only download the packages and not install it. \nThe downloaded packages will be saved in /var/cache/apt/archives. You can copy them from there to some other location, and then if you ever need to install the programs, then you can copy them back.\nIf you have an offline computer separately that you want to install packages to, then you could try apt-offline. On the offline computer it generates a list of files that need to be downloaded to install a program, and you can then download those files (either manually or using apt-offline again) from a different computer and copy them back to install. \nThere is also a GUI for it called apt-offline-gui, which makes the process much more user-friendly.\n\n\nA: You can use Cube for that. It is a portable package manager and downloads packages in any computer with internet connection and installs it back for later use, offline. All of the downloaded packages will be located at cube/projects/[your-project]/data/packages directory.\n\n\nOr you can also share/give your installed apps / packages to other Linux compatible computer using its App Share\n", "Q: Postfix - \"skipped, still being delivered\" (+Permission denied) I have an issue that's driving me crazy.

I am  a beginner trying to understand how installation of software works in Ubuntu.\nI have installed a lot of softwares on my system but everytime I want to install something I will just google and follow without really understanding how it works.The different ways I have done installation\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install \n\n*Download .deb and use dpkg \n\n*Install from Ubuntu software center\n\n*Synpatic package \n\n*Add link to sources.list\n\n*Using PPA\n\n\nWhy are there so many ways to install a software?. what is the difference? How does these different ways of installing it works? \nAny help or links would be appreciated.\n\nA: I'll step you through each method.\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get uses the Debian PPA system to install software. It is what goes on in the background when you install software from the software center.\n\n*dpkg is even further in the background. It is what Ubuntu uses to actually install software, as opposed to simply managing it. You should not use this method if you can help it, since higher-level methods, such as apt-get, are superior in utility.\n\n*Installing from the Software Center is the highest-level method of package installation. It is not designed for advanced users, who tend to prefer apt-get. However, it makes the Ubuntu ecosystem more accessible for the general user.\n\n*Synaptic package manager is like a GUI alternative to apt-get. For apt-get, you need to know the name of a package. Synaptic instead lists packages that your computer knows of, and allows you to install those by clicking on them. It is more advanced than the Software Center and still has the same usage of apt-get.\n\n*Adding links to sources.list is a way to add a PPA that may require a key. This is the method for installing some proprietary apps like Google Chrome. Doing this does not actually install the app, you still need to update your sources, then perform apt-get install or use Synaptic afterwards. Like Sparhawk said, these can also be used for official repositories, whereas PPAs cannot.\n\n*PPAs are needed to update software. They are generally what is used to install as well. They are also the main reason apt-get is superior to dpkg for the installation process. apt-get can provide you with updates and dpkg cannot. As Sparhawk said, it is important to note that PPA stands for Personal Package Archive. These are not official repositories, which instead belong in sources.list.\n\n\nA: It may seem that there are many ways to install softwares in Ubuntu(or GNU/Linux), but behind the hood, there is only one thing that all applications do:  copy different files in appropriate locations and make the system aware## that a new software has been added\n##sometimes you may install softwares manually in directories like $HOME or using a .bin file , in such cases system is not aware of the installation)\napt-get and dpkg are command line tools(backends) which you can use to install software.They can be comparatively difficult than software center but provide more functionality. \nUbuntu software center and synaptic package manager are GUI tools(frontends) which use the command line tools to install software. they are comparatively easy to use but provide less functionality.\nsources.list is the file where your ppa are stored. ppa are kind of links that apt-get uses to find softwares, install them and update them.\nNote that you may also install software by manually copying necessary files to appropriate locations.\n\nA: Dillmo's answer covers all the methods that you mentioned, but I can think of two more that are more manual methods of installation.\nYou might need to manually download the binary and run it from your computer directly. For example, I had to do this with the academic citation software Jabref, as the official repositories had a year-old beta at one stage.\nThe other method is actually building from source yourself (i.e. with build, make, install). I did this recently for the KDE widget \"STDIN plasmoid\", which was otherwise unavailable. There is also an excellent utility called checkinstall that creates fake packages for these manually builds, allowing easier uninstallation.\n\nIn answer to your question, \"why are there so many ways to install a software?\", there are two main reasons. As Dillmo states, some are backends to others. This is because people prefer the ease of different frontends and GUIs.\nThe other reason, primarily relating to my examples above, is availability. Some developers don't package specifically for Ubuntu, and that's why you have to manually install.\n", "Q: Refresh rate is 120Hz while my screen is 60Hz I don't understand why I have to different refresh rate on my system:\nHere is my xrandr output:\n$ xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1600 x 900, maximum 8192 x 8192\nDVI-I-1 connected 1600x900+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 443mm x 249mm\n   1600x900       60.0*+\n   1280x1024      75.0     60.0  \n   1152x864       75.0  \n   1024x768       75.1     60.0  \n   800x600        75.0     60.3  \n   640x480        75.0     60.0  \n   720x400        70.1  \nDP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nAnd my glxgears output:\n$ glxgears\nRunning synchronized to the vertical refresh.

Usually this is used to allow developers to provide updates more quickly than those in the official Ubuntu repositories.\n\n*apt-get update tells apt-get to update its database of what packages can be installed and where to install them from. In this case, apt-get will see your newly-added PPA and discover that ppa:maco.m/ruby has the newest version of rubygems that it knows about, so it will make a note to install rubygems from the PPA next time someone asks to install it.\n\n*apt-get install causes apt-get to find the package in its database and download and install the indicated file. In this case, it will find the rubygems package, download it from ppa:maco.m/ruby, and install it.\nIf you were to simply run apt-get install rubygems, you would get a less-recent version (or perhaps nothing at all, depending on whether rubygems is also in the Ubuntu repositories or only in the PPA).\nIn general, the format ppa:a/b will expand to https://launchpad.net/~a/+archive/b, where you can view the files and download them individually. In your case, that would be https://launchpad.net/~maco.m/+archive/ruby.\n\nA: If you're adding PPA from \n\nppa:cwchien/gradle\n\n, maybe you get the latest work of that packages, but don't mean it without risks (maybe more unstable, etc).\nIf you're use direct command \n\nsudo apt-get install gradle\n\n, so you use ubuntu repositories.

But my VESA drivers(AMD REDWOOD) did not detect that resolution. So I created a shell script as follows:-\nxrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync  \nxrandr --addmode DVI-0 1368x768_60.00  \nxrandr --output DisplayPort-0 --off --output DVI-0 --mode 1368x768_60.00 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output HDMI-0 --off\n\nI saved it as lightdmxrandr.sh in /usr/bin and made it executable. Then I added the following lines to /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf(which is the equivalent of the well known /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf . I am using the above file as I am on 14.04 where there is no /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf .) :-\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter  \ndisplay-setup-script=/usr/bin/lightdmxrandr.sh  \nsession-setup-script=/usr/bin/lightdmxrandr.sh\n\nand saved it. In theory this should have changed both the login screen resolution and desktop screen resolution to 1366x768 . But surprisingly this changed only the login screen resolution. The desktop resolution was not changed. Later I added the script to Startup applications and that changed my desktop resolution.\nSo I want to know why the edits I made to lightdm.conf file(or rather the 50-ubuntu.conf file) did not affect my desktop resolution. Is this some kind of bug that has to be reported at launchpad or is it wrong to say that edits in lightdm will affect desktop screen?  \nPS:- In my opinion this is not just specific to Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: I tried a similar thing and after some debugging I think I figured out what's going on. Your script probably is run and probably does set the resolution correctly. However, since it is run by the login manager, it runs before Unity has finished setting up your desktop environment and Unity reads its own settings and resets the resolution to what you had. So, I think that what happens is:\n\n\n*\n\n*lightdm correctly runs your script\n\n*This sets your desired resolution\n\n*Unity launches, reads its settings and reverts to the default resolution you have there\n\n*Your resolution goes back to what it was before\n\n\nNow, this happens because the VESA driver does not detect your desired resolution automatically. This means that when you change the resolution from the Displays section of Unity's settings, you are giving it a resolution that is not available unless you run the xrandr commands. Therefore, this is ignored next time you restart and Unity reverts to the default resolution. \nSo, what you need to do is make the resolution available to Unity, then set it as default and let it handle it. To do so, you must first add this line to /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf:\nsession-setup-script=/usr/bin/lightdmxrandr.sh\n\nThen, make sure that /usr/bin/lightdmxrandr.sh looks like this:\nxrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync  \nxrandr --addmode DVI-0 1368x768_60.00  \n\nNote that I am not actually setting the resolution, only making it available. Once you have done this restart, then log in. The new resolution should now be available in Settings => Displays. If so, choose it there, log out and log back in again and the resolution should be set correctly.It should now persist across reboots.\n\nAlternative approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an /etc/X11/xorg.conf file that lists your desired resolution. Something like this:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier    \"Monitor0\"\n    Modeline \"1368x768_60.00\"  109.00  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Card0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Modes       \"1368x768_60.00\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier    \"Card0\"\n    Driver        \"vesa\"\nEndSection\n\n\n*Add the script that runs the xrandr commands to your session's startup applications.\n", "Q: Youtube occasionally giving black screen I know that there were many questions about youtube giving blackscreen, but I went through a lot of them on none was my problem.

It's the only way I have direct access to these HDDs - the Windows 8 system wont boot anymore.\nHelp would be appreciated.\n\nA: That is not a Partition problem. It just means that Windows 8 was closed in a unsafe way (Power down while using Windows, You hibernated or suspended the Windows 8 session or any other option than shutting down Windows the normal way).\nIn Windows 8, Microsoft introduced a \"new\" feature when shutting down that it actually not shutdown the PC but hibernated it. The feature is called \"Fast Start Up\" which is fancy words for \"You are not actually shutting down but hibernating\". \nWhat Hibernating does when related to a Linux system is that it tells Linux, in this case Ubuntu that the partition is not save to write to. So to avoid problems, Ubuntu does not let you mount the partition until it has been properly shutdown. Hibernating creates a \"state\" of how Windows was the moment you tried to turn it off. \nSo any change you make will be erased as soon as you start Windows again (Because of the hibernation)\nIf you are experiencing one of the following issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Loosing Data when copying from Ubuntu to Windows 8 after shutting down Windows 8\n\n*Can not access your Windows partitions from Ubuntu getting a Disk contains an unclean file system\nThis is most likely the cause of an option in Windows 8 called Fast Startup which behaves similar to hibernation and keeps a snapshot of the system so when you boot up, it will load faster. Since it keeps a snapshot, anything you copy or change in Windows 8 from Ubuntu after doing the fake shutdown will be lost (Apart from other issues found [HERE][12]).\nAs taken from Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nThe solution in Windows 8 is to go to:\nControl Panel --> Power Options --> Choose what the power button does\nIn here click on \"Change settings that are currently unavailable\" where you should see something like this:\n\nUncheck the option that says \"Turn on fast startup\"\nAfter this, you can shutdown Windows correctly and this will set the bit that tells linux that it was properly shutdown. Since hibernating was not done this time, you will be able to mount and read/write the partition between both systems.\nNOTE: Forcing to mount the Windows system might create more problems with your Windows system.\nForcing Windows 8 Partition to Mount (Warning: You will loose hibernated Data)\nThere is an option I normally try to avoid which forces mounting Windows 8 but with the problem that you will loose all hibernated data. If you don't care what you hibernated, then keep on going.\nWe use the remove_hiberfile with the ntfs-3g command.\neg: sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt -o remove_hiberfile\neg: sudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sda1 /mnt\nThe remove_hiberfile will remove any hibernated data (The hibernate file) from Windows.

I asked this in a previous question here, but I now have another day of trying things so I can report/ask better questions, I hope.  \nUbuntu, Mint and Lubuntu all lock at approximately 75-80% into the install. When I say lock, I mean the mouse dies, the cursor stops revolving and the keyboard is locked out.  A power off is all that will work. I tried both Live CD and Install on both 32 and 64-bit verified CDs. I found Hardware test when booted from the CD, ran that, and the primary tests for computer, disk and memory all passed. (no failures, but skipped unimportant tests)  I changed the BIOS settings to remove any auto magic like sleep, screen dimming or the like. From the CD, I can edit and save files to the hard drive, so I assume it is formatted/partitioned properly.  I turned off the Broadcom wireless, connected a network cable so it would have internet access (works fine), and tried to install again. Same issue.. 75-80% in, lockup. Tried Mint, lockup. Tried Lubuntu, lockup. All look suspiciously similar in their install programs.  \nIs there a way to install the full install from terminal, or at least use a -verbose tag or the like so I can see what the install is hanging up on? <-- Never answered\nI tried to create a bootable USB, and that also failed at 34%, but I had an idea of creating the bootable disk on the hard drive, which showed up in the utility.  Is this possible? <-- Never Answered here, though found the answer  \nThis is VERY frustrating. I was able to install and run FreeBSD with no issues, so there has to be some way to get the OS onto the hard drive!\nInitial problem solved: see answer below.  \n\nA: I am answering my own question, not to be snarky, but to let anyone else in the same boat know about the solution I found to this.  I have found TWO solutions:\nSolution 1:\nFor those of you who may get a lock up in the graphical installer at 'Preparing to install', or try to install Mint or Lubuntu and get a lockup 75-80% in: this seemed to work for me.  Your mileage may vary!  After 5+ days of frustration trying to install Ubuntu, here is my solution.\nI tried installing Ubuntu, Mint and Lubuntu, and the graphical installer always locked up.  The cursor quit spinning, the keyboard and mouse was locked out, and no matter how long you wait, it does not progress.  The only thing that worked was a power off.\nThe problem system:\nGateway MX6442 (MX6440 series) w/ Turion64 single core CPU\n(previously a Windows XP Multimedia Edition computer)\n2GB ram\n120GB HD\nPhilips CD-DVD drive\nEthernet\nBroadcom 4313 wireless card *  One major issue is the wireless card!  **\nI finally downloaded the alternate CD at http://releases.ubuntu.com/ (THANKS @Marky) and tried that install.  I selected the language and other settings it asked for, then selected Install Ubuntu.  It got to 19% and locked up at 'retrieving nic-modules-3.11.0-15-generic-di' and a power off was all that would work.\nTo get past the hangup in the alternate disk installer, I turned the wireless off via the keyboard: FN+F2 on the Gateway.  The Broadcom wireless is a known issue in Ubuntu as you can see by searching the forums for Broadcom.  There should be a way to turn off the wireless through the keyboard for most computers.  Consult your user manual for the combo for your computer.  This worked to get past the problem lockup at 19% above.   \nThere SHOULD also be an option on the installer to skip/turn-off the wireless device to allow installation to continue, not just a totally locked system!\nSo, the install got to 92%, 'retrieving file 16 of 20' and appeared to stop again since there was no [n sec remaining] message as with almost all other files that took a while to load.  However, after waiting a while it did complete loading and continued with the installation and successfully completed.\nIt ejected the CD and rebooted into Ubuntu!  Woo-Hoo!  After 5 days, I FINALLY get to see Linux on this machine!\nNow I will need to go see about getting the wireless to work.  I will try the solution here: \nHow to install Broadcom wireless drivers? (BCM43xx)\nHopefully, the system will then be fully functional.  I will continue this after trying the above.\nSince this was a brand new Ubuntu install, I did not need to remove anything in the system.  I followed the instructions in the above link, turned the wireless back on via keyboard before the last reboot command, and the wireless came up after the boot.  I was able to see and log in to my wireless router, and so far it has worked with no issues!\nSo, after 5+ days of total frustration, I FINALLY have an installed, fully functional Ubuntu installation!  I hope this helps someone else that has the same type of issues!\nSolution 2:\nAfter three days of trying to get ANY flavor of Linux to install on the Gateway laptop, I installed PC-BSD 10.0.  The first install failed, but at least it told me WHY it failed.  I restarted the install in VESA mode, and lo and behold, it installed first time.\nWhy did Linux fail?  It would seem there are three problem devices on this system: the video card (ATI), the sound card (???) and the wireless card (Broadcom).  The PC-BSD either correctly identified and loaded the correct drivers, or disabled them and continued.  In the end, everything works except the sound card, and it can run the same DE's as Ubuntu, Mint or Lubuntu.\nHopefully this answer will not get deleted, and will prove useful to those of you who just cannot get Linux to install.  I spent three frustrating days trying everything I could think of, and less than 4.5 hours (including a 3.6GB download) installing PC-BSD.\nThanks for all the suggestions.  I do appreciate those of you who actually tried to help. :)\n\nA: I was going to comment, but I was guess I don't have enough reputation, so don't count this as an answer as I don't completely know what the cause of this is.\nThis is only a suggestion. Maybe you could try booting the CD into nomodeset? When it boots into this screen https://www.logicsupply.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/boot_splash.png (Lubuntu will automatically give you the option) then push the down arrow, select your language, then push f6 and click nomodeset. Then push escape and go to install Ubuntu. I had problems with my Laptop freezing on a black screen when trying to install Lubuntu and Ubuntu. For me it was a graphical error, and the nomodeset fixed it. It refreshes once installed and should work.\nComment back and let me know if this was of any help.\n", "Q: Dock (Docky) disappears when I put my computer to sleep My dock disappears when I put the computer to sleep.

Appears to be complicated to understand the order of execution. Any easy explanation ?\nuuencode host-file  < host-file >encodedfile\n\n\nA: uuencode is the command. host-file is its argument. < host-file redirects the file to the standard input of the command. >encodedfile redirects output of the command to the file.\n\nA: When a console program is launched, it opens three standard file descriptors:\n0 STDIN\n1 STDOUT\n2 STDERR\nNormally the STDIN filehandle reads from the terminal input (i.e. the keyboard).  But when the < redirection is used, input is read from that file instead.  Likewise, STDOUT usually writes to the terminal, but when > is used, output is written to that file instead.\nSTDERR can similarly be redirected by using 2>.  You might also see STDERR being redirected to the same place as STDOUT by using 2>&1.\n\nA: uuencode host-file  < host-file >encodedfile\nLet's break this down into 4 parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*uuencode is the name of the command to run.  The shell searches the PATH environment variable ($PATH) and looks for an executable file named uuencode in each directory in the PATH.  In a standard install, this will be /usr/bin/uuencode.  The uuencode program takes a binary file and turns it into text in a special format so it can be sent over a network that can't handle non-ascii characters.\n\n*The first host-file is the command line argument to uuencode.  The uuencode command needs one argument so that it can put the name of the file in the encoded version.  The first line of the encoded file will look something like this:\nbegin 644 host-file\n\n*< host-file is the shell using a file named host-file as standard input (stdin) for the uuencode process.  So when uuencode reads some bytes of input, instead of coming from your keyboard, they come from that file.\n\n*>encodefile is the shell using a file named encodedfile as standard output (stdout).  Thus, when uuencode writes some output, instead of going to your screen, it goes to that file.  \n\n\nThere is not really an order of execution, since only one command, uuencode, is being executed.  If you want technical details, read on.  \nBehind the scenes, the shell calls fork(), then the child process opens the host-file file for reading, opens the encodedfile file for writing, and calls exec(), which replaces the child process (a copy of the shell process) with the uuencode process.  The child process then becomes uuencode, with the input file descriptor (a way the operating system keeps track of open files) set to that of host-file and the output file descriptor set to that of encodedfile.\n", "Q: Problem with browser flash plugin YouTube video does not work properly (see image).

I will surely do it, but I don't have a Paypal account and I am in urgent need to install Ubuntu. Can someone help me?\n\nA: Summary\nWubi is definitely free, although it hasn't yet (as of 2014-04-20) been updated for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nThe best place to download Wubi for the old Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is from releases.ubuntu.com/12.04 (wubi.exe direct link).\n\nDetail\nA bug was introduced on April 10th when we released changes to the Ubuntu.com download section, which both hid the \"skip\" link on the Wubi contributions page, forcing you through Paypal, and broke the Wubi thank-you page so even if you did pay the download wouldn't start - pretty catastrophic. This is what led to the confusion.\nI've now redirected the Wubi contribute URL directly to the download. Now if you click \"Get the installer\" on the Windows Installer page, your Wubi download will start immediately, so you never see the contributions page and don't even have the option to pay.\nEdit: Now that Ubuntu 14.04 is out, the old Windows Installer URL on ubuntu.com now redirects you to the main desktop download page, as Wubi has not been updated for the new Ubuntu 14.04 yet.\nI've answered and closed @JorgeCastro's bug.\n\nA: There is a skip option if you don't want to donate. \nApparently the skip button is not showing on the Wubi download page, possibly a bug as other download pages have the skip option.\nYou can download it from the 12.04 page\nHowever, please remember: \n\n\n*\n\n*WUBI was dropped after 12.10, so no support will be available.\n\n*WUBI doesn't support UEFI / win 8.\n\n\nA: I've just downloaded it from this link:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\nIt should work \n", "Q: How to convert Android's contacts2.db to .vcf?

It's very dull & black. How can i fix it? The video quality is to bad. I also referred to this guide(https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype) but no change the video is still the same. Following these instructions:\n uvcdynctrl -s 'Backlight Compensation' 7\n uvcdynctrl -cv\n guvcview -o\n\n\nA: The recommended steps to check the webcam quality are (This same problem happened to me for a Logitech webcam):\n\n\n*\n\n*Test the webcam with another app (Cheese, Kamerka, Kamoso & guvcview). Guvcview and Kamoso are great since they offer many features for webcam that Skype does not. You can even test the webcam with Google Hangouts or http://www.testwebcam.com/\n\n*If the webcam works great in other apps or webapps, then you know the webcam is not the problem, but the software. We then go to test capturing methods with tools like qv4l2. You can check several webcam features with this. There are some capturing options that are limited to 5 fps. Others can go up to 30 fps and even other can get to 60 fps.\n\n*Last option is to update Skype with the latest version (or a version that works correctly). Is no secret that Skype has had a huge amount of video problems on Linux. From slow webcam, to black one, to crashing if you opened the webcam and more. For some users, using the Skype that comes with Ubuntu works great. For others you need to download a newer version. In my case in one PC it works perfect with the one that Ubuntu had. In another case, the upgraded version worked great. Currently I have the 4.2.0.13 Version.\nNOTE: I also followed the steps you are doing and got no solution. A tip I would say is that Skype might crash and leave a zombie in memory, so you need to search for the Skype process and kill it before starting another Skype session. Just mentioning this in case it happens to you.\n\nA: What happens when you use guvcview?\nWhile Cheese shows a pretty OK picture of my webcam, Skype does display a darker image.

I am currently running Ubuntu 13.10. I experienced this same issue with Ubuntu 12.04, so I dont believe the following issue is tied to a specific release. \nI am using Ubuntu for work, by choice. Id like to stay logged in overnight, so that I can immediately resume my work when I arrive the next morning. Unfortunately, when I arrive the next day, I often get this issue where any mouse movement or keyboard input results in a flashing/flickering screen, and I cant type in my password for gnome-screensaver.\nI try going to tty4, restarting unity (which, in 13.10, now says \"restart is deprecated\" ... derp), restarting lightdm, restarting compiz, you name it. Nothing works. Everything I try either has no effect, or produces some unhelpful error message that equates to \"nope.\" I am always forced to \"sudo reboot\" from tty4, which isnt the end of the world, but its leaving me thinking Ubuntu 12.04+ is about as reliable as a Microsoft product (I have many other reasons for this opinion).\nI have been trying to troubleshoot this issue for about 7 months to no avail. Previously, my employer gave me a craptacular machine which could barely run Ubuntu 12.04. I ended up believing the issue was due to running a modern OS on an outdated machine. I couldnt even run a Virtual Machine for testing software updates, which was my only viable argument in getting a new computer.\nI finally convinced my employer to get me a new machine. This one has 8G RAM, brand new 1TB HD, quad core 3.2ghz i7, etc - its decent for work (note: no video card, but that shouldnt matter cuz I just write web dev software). I installed Ubuntu 13.10 on this machine. I still have the same exact problem.\nI usually just have sublime text 2, and 3 gnome-terminal sessions open to my internal development server left open overnight. I lock my screen as I leave for the day, and am using gnome-screensaver (the default black screen). Ive gone through debug log, kernel log, syslog, xorg log, lightdm log, apport log, even faillog, and nothing strikes me as out of the ordinary. At most, the syslog prints tons of the following error overnight:\n<time> <hostname>: whoopsie[<id>]: online\n<time> whoopsie[<id>]: last message repeated <2/3> times\n\nOn the old outdated machine (12.04), there were lots of errors with gnome-screensaver, which led me to conclude that the machine diddnt have enough video memory to reload the desktop after some issue with the screensaver (sounds crazy, but hey Im no expert). On this new machine, there are no such logs concerning gnome-screensaver, so there goes my theory.\nAnother oddity is I have been using Ubuntu for my home workstation since 12.04 was released, and have never experienced this issue. My home machine is pretty heavy duty in regards to video card, memory, disk space, nice motherboard, etc. I am currently running 13.04 at home (afraid to upgrade due to all the bugs in 13.10 that are also said to be present in the upcoming 14.04). If it werent for my positive experience with my home machine, Id ditch Ubuntu altogether. Not being able to keep my machine logged in overnight is driving me away from canonical products. I seriously cant afford to continue losing time at work with buggy operating system issues. Im that 'weirdo' in the office that chooses to use linux, so people arent fond of my technical differences as it is. Fedora / CentOS with Gnome 3 is looking very nice these days. \nCan anyone help me figure out why staying logged in overnight results in flickering screen, unusable peripherals, and a broken environment?\n{ update 7/17/2014 }\nHadnt had time to look into this for a while (this is my work machine afterall), but last night left my machine on with gnome-screensaver up overnight, and my system monitors showed low memory usage when I left for the evening. Came back today and memory has 1.7G in use and 5.3G cached, which is pretty much all of it. I then examined htop, and sorted the list by memory use. \nSure enough, there are 5 lightdm processes, and each of them uses a ton of memory. Here is the output:\n  PID USER      PRI  NI  VIRT   RES   SHR S CPU% MEM%   TIME+  Command\n 1078 root       20   0 2880M 2342M 2319M S  0.7 29.6  8:39.44 /usr/bin/X -core :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch\n 1117 root       20   0 2880M 2342M 2319M S  0.7 29.6  0:02.92 /usr/bin/X -core :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch\n 1118 root       20   0 2880M 2342M 2319M S  0.0 29.6  0:01.33 /usr/bin/X -core :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch\n 1119 root       20   0 2880M 2342M 2319M S  0.0 29.6  0:00.74 /usr/bin/X -core :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch\n 1120 root       20   0 2880M 2342M 2319M S  0.0 29.6  0:00.00 /usr/bin/X -core :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch\n... a few other things with low memory usage follow...\n\nIs this normal? Ill continue monitoring this, but I have a feeling these many lightdm processes are the culprit, and their collective memory usage is startlingly high. Can anyone shed some further light on this (no pun intended) ?\n\nA: what usually works for me (with similar problem) is \nkillall `pidof Xorg`\n\nalthough this completely stops the X server and restarts it\n\nA: I have a similar system at home, used as a multi-purpose media center, server, cloud, whatever.\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS, Core i7 CPU, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD.  Whenever not in my office, the computer gets locked with ctrl + alt + L, using the same black screen you describe.\nHard drive crashed, upgraded to a 120GB SSD and got a 4TB HDD in return for the under-warranty 1TB drive, and ordered another 8GB of RAM with the SSD while waiting on the replacement drive.  Installed Ubuntu 14.04 fresh, same deal: locked when gone, no problems.\nI'm using Gnome 3 as my display manager, not sure about what you're using.  The only discernible difference between us is your application, \"Wally.\"  I would recommend that you completely disable it, restart the machine, and give it about a week, or at least a couple days, then let us know whether it's still going on.\n\nA: Upgrading to 14.04 seemed to be the solution. This machine has been used extensively and been left logged in for 6 days in a row now, and still runs as responsively and smoothly as a freshly rebooted machine / relogged user. Nothing has changed about my hardware. What I have noticed is that gnome-screensaver wasnt set as the default screen saving action for unity in 14.04. Something appears to have changed in regards to how this system manages memory while the screen is locked. No more apparent memory leak.\nSomething between lightdm, gmome-screensaver, Xorg, compiz, and unity has been updated enough between 12.* and 14.04 that this issue I was experiencing has been relieved. I also think not having a dedicated graphics card and having a less-than-adequate motherboard were involved in creating the right environmental conditions to cause this problem. My home machine, with a nice graphic card and far faster motherboard, has never exhibited this issue, even with the same exact software-level setup.\n", "Q: Problems with steam after playing games I have a problem with my steam client here.I open steam and play a few hours of Dota2, but after I'm done.. it takes more than 5 minutes to close and slows down my overall system performance. Is there any way to rectify this problem.\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 13.10 64bit and I'm also playing Dota 2 using Steam for Linux.\nCould you please add some information to your question? It's unclear if Dota 2 or Steam take 5 minutes close and what exactly happens.\nMy best guess is that Steam says something like \"Synchronizing Updates\" what basically means that files are getting uploaded to SteamCloud.\nIf that's the case, you can simply right-click Dota 2 on the list, go to Properties > Updates > SteamCloud and uncheck Enable Steam Cloud.\nDisabling SteamCloud means that if you're going to play Dota 2 from your account on another computer you won't have the files saved on your current computer, though Dota progress will be conserved.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: After installing xserver-xorg-core laptop won't boot So I was trying to figure out how to install the proprietary Intel drivers for my laptop and found I needed to install xserver-xorg-video-intel. When I tried installing that I was told I needed to install xserver-xorg-core first. So I installed both and rebooted and now Ubuntu won't boot. It shows the Ubuntu logo then the screen goes black. \nI am in recovery mode now. I removed both packages. However it still won't boot. What can I do to get the GUI working again?! \nThanks\nI am using the Dell XPS 13 developer edition with 12.04 LTS\n\nA: The ubuntu-desktop package should pull in all necessary packages for the GUI, including any Xserver packages that may have gone missing.\n", "Q: Setting Terminal tab titles I'm trying to open up a few terminal tabs in gnome-terminal, and so far I've managed to do something, but I'm  stuck now.\nSo, I have the following requirement:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open tabs titled \"X\" and \"Y\"\n\n*Execute some commands\n\n*Keep the tabs open and ready for further use; keep the title.\n\n\nSo far, I managed to meet some of the requirements, but not all of them:\ngnome-terminal --tab -t \"X\" -e \"bash\" --tab -t \"Y\" -e \"top\"\n\nThis opens two tabs:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"X\" (and then changes the title to the default title)\n\n*\"Y\", but the tab closes as soon as I quit top.\n\n\nIs there a way to open up a tab, launch bash, but not change the title? I've tried Google, but gave up.\nEDIT: It doesn't has to be a command.\n\nA: To keep the tab titles you need to comment the following lines in your .bashrc:\n# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir\n#case \"$TERM\" in\n#xterm*|rxvt*)\n#    PS1=\"\\[\\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]$PS1\"\n#    ;;\n#*)\n#    ;;\n#esac\n\nThen gnome-terminal --tab -t \"X\" -e \"bash\" --tab -t \"Y\" -e \"top\" will work as expected:\n\n\nA: As you can see in other answers, the title of the tab is changed by the shell every time it outputs a prompt. And after executing top your tab exits because the command you told it to run finishes...\nI'll do the following:\nStep 1: call the terminal with shells, adding environment variables like that: \ngnome-terminal --tab -t X -e \"env MYTAB=X bash\" --tab -t Y -e \"env MYTAB=Y bash\" \n\nStep 2: add at the end of your .bashrc the following code:\n#if MYTAB is not set, return\n[ -z \"$MYTAB\" ] && return\n# reset the cursor and title \nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\nPS1=\"\\[\\e]0;$MYTAB \\w\\a\\]$PS1\"   #title: $MYTAB and current dir\n# execute the commands for every tab\ncase \"$MYTAB\" in\n        X)\n                echo this is X\n        ;;\n\n        Y)\n                echo this is Y \n                top\n        ;;\nesac\n\n...which I think is easy to understand and you can modify with the command/tweaks you need. Tested and works ok; after you exit top from the tab you'll still have the prompt and the tab for you to peruse. \nScreenshot (after pressing \"q\" in top): \n\n\nA: I'm assuming it doesn't have to be a command, and giving a totally graphical way to do this.  \nAfter launching gnome-terminal, the 'file' menu allows you to open new tabs which will have a given title assigned.  That can be changed by either the 'terminal' menu or rightclicking the tab and doing it from the context menu.  \nThen you can open top and whatever other commands you want, it's all in the terminal, running as a normal, unbound process that's being run from any other terminal - just the desktop environment -  that won't die after it feels it's done what it's supposed to do.\n\nA: While playing around, I found that it's not the command at all - it's the profile.\nGo to:\nEdit | Profiles | (Default) | Edit | Title and Command \n\nand change the \"When Terminals Set Their Own Title\" option to \"Keep initial title\", at the bottom of the list.  Now, when you launch a command with a title, it'll stick around, so your command will work properly.\n\n", "Q: converting .ovpn file to these 3 files: ca.crt, client.crt, client.key vpnbook.com offers a free openVPN service.

Right now it's xterm, but I need xterm-256color.\nI use other terminal emulators (Gnome Terminator, tmux), so setting in my .bashrc would be messy at best.\n\nA: There's an option called xterm in Terminator's configuration (see man terminator_config), which is supposed to set TERM. Due to a bug, it does not work, and TERM is always set to xterm. Terminator also sets a COLORTERM variable, to gnome-terminal, so you can use that to set TERM to xterm-256color (since gnome-terminal has no problem with that value:\n[[ $COLORTERM = gnome-terminal ]] && TERM=xterm-256color\n\nOr, what I use to avoid problems with screen/tmux:\n[[ $COLORTERM = gnome-terminal && ! $TERM = screen-256color ]] && TERM=xterm-256color\n\n\nA: The way I do it is using a custom_command in ~/.config/terminator/config as follows:\n...\n[profiles]\n  [[default]]\n    ...\n    custom_command = TERM=xterm-256color bash -l # Do not use 'terminator' here\n    use_custom_command = True\n    ...\n\nThis works like a charm i.e. for the 256-color skins for\nmidnight commander. The -l option makes bash run as a login shell (which means that it will load settings from your .bash_profile).  You can omit it if you prefer Terminator to launch bash as a non-login shell (so that it will load .bashrc instead).\n\nA: This is an untested idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy /usr/share/applications/terminator.desktop to ~/.local/share/applications\n\n*Edit the local .desktop copy so it sets TERM when starting terminator\n\n", "Q: How to make sudoreplay work?

You can run the Disk utility to check the SMART of the hard drive.\n\n*If the 2 options above are OK we then download from another PC another ISO image and burn it in another CD/DVD with write check. With this new burned CD/DVD we will install Ubuntu from scratch again.\nThis are the 3 cases where I got the dreaded Fixing recursive fault but reboot is needed error. The first time I got this, I tried to install Ubuntu 3 o 4 more times before giving up. Most of the time is a faulty burned CD image. Followed by bad memory. Lastly a faulty HDD.\n\nA: Your pastebin file shows that there is a \"Invalid System Disk... Disk I/O Error...\" at line number 752. So, I suspect that there is a faulty HDD issue. Try checking your hard disk by installing another OS or checking the disk.\nNote: I am not an Ubuntu expert but I noticed something in you pastebin file and hence, thought it would be nice to bring in to notice.\n", "Q: How to fix quadruple screen in teamviewer?

I just want to delete EVERYTHING except maybe /home folder and reinstall everything, because system became a little bit slow and I want to do that when 14.04 comes out. What's the best way to do that?\nAt the moment I have 12.04 and have some other systems (cinamon, lubuntu etc.) that I want gone.\n\nA: Just reinstall it over itself.\nUbuntu will not touch your data in /home and you'll start off with a clean slate. Just ensure that \"Format\" is not selected in your partition screen.\nYou can reinstall it in the same fashion as you installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu?\nLet me reiterate to ensure that you do not reformat your partition! And as with all system upgrades and reinstalls, having a fresh backup is always a good precaution to take. \nYou might have some things in your home directory that could be leading to performance degradation. In the past I've had config files in my home directory in directories like .gconf and .gnome that ended to get large and unweildy. These days things like that aren't as much of an issue. \n\nA: How you re-install Ubuntu over an existing older version depends on if you have /home in a separate partition or as a folder within / partition, the default.\nIn either case you start the installation process from a live DVD/USB. Proceed until you come to the Installation Type page. \n\nIf you have /home in its default location within / partition:\nChoose the option: Upgrade Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS. This will keep your /home folder. Even though it says \"installed software will be kept where possible,\" in my experience it cleared most of them. YMMV.\nIf you have /home in its own separate partition:\nYou can either go with the above choice. \nOr you can choose Something else. If you choose \"Something else,\" make sure you check the format box for the / partition and uncheck the format box for /home partition. See below for an example.\n\nNote, in this picture above both the / and /home partitions are to be formatted. Make sure that the format box for /home is unchecked before you proceed. Otherwise you will lose all your data!\nThis method will format the / partition and all the extra programs you had installed in the older version will be gone. However, the settings saved in the /home will remain. If you decide to re-install some of them, say Chrome, your personal configuration, if any, should be there for the new installation to use.\nRemoving Cinamon and Lubuntu\nIt depends on how you installed Cinamon Lubuntu etc. \nIf you had installed just the cinamon desktop environments (DE) and the LXDE (the DE for Lubuntu) on top of Ubuntu via Ubuntu Software Center, or the apt-get command, then yes. Either method will delete them. \nIf you installed these from their own LiveDVD/CD/USB in separate partitions, then no. In that case you will have to remove those partitions first. You can remove these partitions either from the LiveDVD/USB, by choosing the option Try before installing and then using gparted. Make sure you don't delete the wrong partitions. At this stage you can move the other partitions around if needed and reallocate the empty space to the version of Ubuntu you want to keep. \nHope this helps\n\nA: What if you're using a modern release of Ubuntu Desktop (or flavor) and don't see an Upgrade/Repair existing installation option?\nThe option still exists on releases up to and including Ubuntu 22.10, but it's not offered as an easy to click option, and needs to be manually triggered.\nThis option will allow you to\n\n*\n\n*repair an installation (ie. re-install the same release)\n\n*upgrade to a later release (ie. next release, or even skip releases)\n\n*go backwards to a prior release (ie. you didn't like a later release, and want to revert to something older; though there can be consequences with this, which I won't cover, but it's possible & problems will not occur in many cases; issues are package level basis, so do your homework before you expect a backwards install will be good for you)\n\n*you're installing a Ubuntu system over a non-Ubuntu, but other GNU/Linux OS, this will work too (within limits).\n\nAssuming you're using a Desktop installer (namely ubiquity (used by Ubuntu Desktop & many flavors, including Kubuntu which uses a different skin which changes how it looks), or calamares (used by modern Lubuntu or Ubuntu-Studio)) this will work.  I'm not covering a di (Debian installer for server or desktop alternate ISO) or subiquity server installer, you will\n\n*\n\n*Choose the Manual option, which may appear as\n\n*\n\n*Something Else\n\n*Manual Partitioning\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your existing partition(s).\n\nNote:   You do not need to have a separate /home partition for Ubuntu Desktop to have your settings & datafiles survive re-install; this works equally with a single partition for all supported releases of Ubuntu (most unsupported too).\nEnsure you DO NOT format any, the lack of format for \"/\" is what triggers the REPAIR or RE-INSTALL option I'm talking about here.\nThe installer will\n\n*\n\n*take note of your manually installed packages  (ie. those you added to your system post-install)\n\n*erase system directories  (if you have some server apps installed; as they store configs in system directories, you may suffer loss here, but it won't impact desktop applications)\n\n*install the new system (from your booted live media)\n\n*if internet is available install the extra packages noted earlier\n\n*ask to reboot (and won’t touch any user files unless you formatted)\n\nThis is QA (Quality Assurance) tested to work with all Ubuntu repository software only (not 3rd party), so no guarantees are offered with 3rd party, and I'm choosing to ignore 3rd party apps for this 'answer'.\nThe user is asked to reboot, where you'll be able to login & see your older desktop configs, the additional apps (manually installed packages you'd added) also re-installed, and be able to load your favorite music player & continue playing your existing playlists as if the re-install didn't occur.\n(FYI:  I use clementine as example in the Understanding Lubuntu QA Testcases document as it's a non-standard app for Lubuntu, and thus allows me to confirm it got re-installed correctly as I perform other post-install checks during QA; all your Ubuntu repository apps should re-install where available).\nNotes:\nI've used this to migrate a Fedora system to Ubuntu, as well as an older OpenSuSE Leap system to Ubuntu.  As Fedora & OpenSuSE are rpm based (not deb based), no manually installed packages will get auto-reinstalled.  ie. this will work for converting any GNU/Linux system to Ubuntu, as long as the Ubuntu installer can cope with the file-system that is used.\nI've also used it for Debian systems very regularly, though as packages never really align for Debian & Ubuntu, I'd suggest erasing system directories manually prior to the install process to avoid having the re-install attempt to re-install packages for the non-Ubuntu system that cannot be found (ie. avoiding the error messages on unfound packages). If your system was a non-Ubuntu system, please do not file bugs on unfound packages (such bug reports will be invalid).\nI've also used this to switch a Linux Mint system to Ubuntu. Before I trust a new (second hand) box I use it for a week or two before I start my real install.  I used Linux Mint (& FreeBSD as I dual boot systems) to test my old primary box during this 'hardware' testing, but decided there was some pieces of the Linux Mint I really liked & wanted to survive into my install, so I opted to do an unclean install instead of my intended clean (ie. format) install. As I wanted a clean package system (no Linux Mint packages attempted to be re-installed), I just erased all system directories that contained data I didn't want to survive, so the install of Ubuntu (17.10 at the time) didn't detect a prior OS, but without format, the parts I wanted to survive remained.  FYI:  The FreeBSD system used a non-Ubuntu compatible file-system, thus I didn't attempt to re-use that & did a format install over that system.\nI'm involved with QA, as well as heavily involved with one flavor in particular, thus keep systems of all supported releases available for support reasons. For many of those, I never actually perform the normal upgrades of packages, but use this install method to re-install as it accomplishes two tasks at once, ie. a QA test is performed & I check it still works for unreleased media, as well as updating the packages on my support installs.  Currently the releases that get this approach are jammy (currently using 22.04.2 daily media; ie. unreleased) & lunar. When I no longer need an install for support, I'll use this install method to convert it to another release (ie. 21.10 reached EOL, that install became 22.10 as I already had a 22.04 system)\nI like to think of this Repair Installation option as Upgrade via re-install, though Lubuntu refer to it as Upgrade using existing partition.  I tend to think of this as my backup for release-upgrades if I lack time, don't have sufficient disk space (as system directories are wiped, no downloads occurs; a pretty full disk isn't the issue it is with normal release-upgrades), or just if I lack the time to do the release-upgrade.\nIt can be used with encryption, though I won't support it with full disk encryption (very easy to make mistakes here); if your system uses Data Partition encryption (home folder which used to be a default install for older releases like 17.10 I mentioned earlier), you can still use this install method very easily.  For home partition encryption, you need only to add the encryption packages (not default any more thus not included on modern ISOs) to the live system prior to starting the installer, then start the installer & install normally.\n", "Q: No option for booting into ubuntu when sharing drive with windows 7 Using the 12.04 install DVD I installed ubuntu on the same drive as windows.  It is defaulting to windows each time.  How can I change this?\n\nA: Windows is greedy and rewrites the master boot record to only point to itself, making it so that it bypasses GRUB and Ubuntu.  Typically, Ubuntu should be installed after Windows, but it's okay.  \nBurn this .iso to a disk and load and run it after Windows is installed.

I don't want to change the whole partition's owner.\n\nA: First, I highly advise against using ntfs on linux this way.\nSecond, you can not change ownership or permissions with mount --bind\nYou can try mounting the partition with the permissions option, then the usual commands chown and chmod should work.\nIf that does not work, see https://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-manual/#7\n", "Q: VBox: Error mounting shared folders in Ubuntu 12.04 guest \"gid= requires an argument\" I have an Ubuntu 12.04 guest running on an Ubuntu 13.10 host.

I've written other strange symbols into my XCompose file, such as signs of the zodiac and planets etc... and they all work just fine, even with the double Multi_key at the beginning (It's all for my research).  Here's an excerpt of the file:\n...\n# Abbreviating some of the longer ones.\n<Multi_key> <Multi_key> <s> <c> <o> <r> <p> : \"♏\"   U264F   # SCORPIUS\n<Multi_key> <Multi_key> <s> <a> <g> <i> <t> : \"♐\"   U2650   # SAGITTARIUS\n<Multi_key> <Multi_key> <c> <a> <p> <r> <i> <c> : \"♑\"   U2651   # CAPRICORN\n<Multi_key> <Multi_key> <a> <q> <u> <a> <r> : \"♒\"   U2652   # AQUARIUS\n<Multi_key> <Multi_key> <p> <i> <s> <c> <e> <s> : \"♓\"   U2653   # PISCES\n# Really, this should be SERPENTARIUS.

I'm not sure what's wrong with the file, I think I've followed the correct syntax, and I have the fonts installed.  Does XCompose not supported unicode glyphs at such a high range?\n\nA: The ComposeKey sequences used by Gnome to enter special characters are hard coded into the program. \nTo use a custom Xcompose file, you will need to use the xim input method.\nMore information about using the compose key - and using xim to bypass the Gnome hardcodings - is given at ComposeKey in the community documentation.\nThe Gnome hard coding can be overruled in favour of the original Xwindow Input Method (XIM) by setting the environment variable GTK_IM_MODULE. This can be set in the /etc/environment file, but if the machine has more than one user then it is best set from the home directory on a per user basis by modifying ~/.gnomerc or ~/.Xsession\nexport GTK_IM_MODULE=\"xim\"\n\nBeyond that, it seems likely that you are essentially correct about the additional problems you are having. Direct Unicode input follows ISO 14755 in specifying only 4 hex digits in the code point and the cuneiform code points have 5 digits. It seems likely that this is also the underlying problem here. It seems that the layout is too complex for the compose key.\nTo enter cuneiform, I think you could create a custom keyboard layout (rather than using the compose key), but really this seems to require an input method editor rather than a keyboard. Your best option is to create a custom input table that would work with Ibus.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch how to detect If the application is closed on ubuntu touch.\nI run an application in terminal and close the application in the Application scope.\nThe application isn't killed.

Found guest-6lDH45Lx:132: and guest-MTiNKr:x:127: groups in /etc/group.\nCan anybody explain what these are and why they're lurking in my configuration?\n\nA: As the names suggests, these are the group counterparts for temporary guest account that lightdm has created. They are supposed to get cleaned up and removed after the session is done with but I could see that in a power-failure (for example) these could hang around. It might also be this bug.\nAssuming nobody is logged in as a guest, you can almost certainly delete these lines (and /etc/passwd counterparts) safely.

The private key stays on the machine you're connecting from.\nTo view your newly-generated keypair's public key, you can cat the id_rsa.pub file that should be created automatically (that is if you use the ssh-keygen command to generate your new keypair).\n", "Q: How to choose where the software is stored when installing via Ubuntu Software Center I want to choose where on a hard drive the application is stored when installing it via Ubuntu Software Center. I am not looking for a general setting for all applications, but rather I would like to set the exact folder on hard drive where the currently installed applications will be stored. Also is it a problem to store the application to a NTFS partition?\n\nA: You can't. Linux (not just Ubuntu) follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard where is defined what the logical place is to store files such that we do not have duplicate files on our system. USC does not choose where to install software.The package you install has information on where files need to go.\nIf you want to store programs on a different place you need to install it from source. While compiling sources you can then tell it to install in /opt or in your /home. And if that is a general idea you want to explore Gentoo could be a better operating system for you.\n\nAlso is it a problem to store the application to a NTFS partition?\n\nIn general: yes. Windows does not provide functionality for the permissions structure Linux uses. \n\nA: Where application files are stored on your hard disk is subject to rather strict rules. Debian installer files, including software you install via ppa, the Software Center or Synaptic, will not let you choose where to install. There are good reasons for that. To mention a few:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security: Applications should be accessible (in general) for all users. The reverse consequence is that applications should not be installed in locations where unauthorized users can edit the code for example. The directory structure of Linux (and thus Ubuntu) takes very well care of permissions, so that there is a strict set of \"layers\" from user level on to the kernel. This structure is one of the reasons why Linux is one of the safest OS. NTFS does not support setting permissions like Linux does, so it would not fit in this concept.\n\n*Coherence of your system: To run an application, it takes more than just the binary file of an application. Many applications share libraries and other sources. New applications should be able to find already installed libraries. To make it possible to start an application from the GUI, Dash is reading the contents of desktop files in either /usr/share/applications (globally) or ~/.local/share/applications. \n\n\nThat is why these files are stored in fixed locations.\nYou can however choose your own location if you build the application from source. In some cases, you can use an installer script to install applications locally. If you do either of those, as a general rule, I would suggest to not touch the order of how things are arranged outside your ~/ directory unless you really know what you are doing.\n", "Q: How to install so runs alongside windows 8 How do i install Ubuntu so that when I turn on my computer, the DOS screen shows up and I can choose between Windows 8 and Ubuntu? -Dell Latitude E6400\n\nA: When you install ubuntu, you will get an option called \"Install ubuntu xx.xx alongside Windows\"\nThis will automatically install ubuntu alongside windows, and you can choose between them in the Grub Bootloader.\nRead more here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu stand only help I'm new to Ubuntu and I was hoping to install it on my old Windows XP computer but if there is a way I would prefer to have only Ubuntu on the computer rather than have both Ubuntu and Windows.

I then tried creating a bootable version of it with a usb stick but I wasn't having any luck with that. I tried making the dvd disk multiple times but it never worked.\n\nA: First of all make sure that your computer is able to boot up DVD's or USB units from the BIOS. (BIOS is the low graphic system just after starting the computer up).\nWhen you start your computer, make sure to enter the BIOS menu by hitting either F2, F!, ESC or even try F9. I don't know what pc-model you have, you may want to search that up if possible.\nSo, when you have done that, search up any option related to the boot order of your system devices. If you find such an option, make sure to place the USB in front of your hard-drives in your boot order, then save the setup, and try to boot from the USB pen again.\nHowever, if this doesn't work, make sure to visit www.ubuntu.com and read carefully about installing ubuntu from Windows. \nGood luck with your installation, that is the best answer i can give based on your information you provided here.\n", "Q: Do I absolutely need to format my Ext HDD in order to use it to install Ubuntu?

I'd appreciate feedback on it!\nIn virtualbox, enable both NAT and host-only networks. (BTW: It works on my win7 host. I don't know how to do that in linux host).\nOn the host - find the \"host-only\" interface's ip\nipconfig /all     # for windows host\nifconfig -a       # for linux host\n\nIn the guest, edit /etc/network/interfaces. The trick was reversing the order  eth1 (host-only) comes BEFORE eth0 (internet/dhcp). I don't know why.\nauto lo                        # keep the original loopback settings\niface lo ...                   # yeah, i don't remember, just keep it.\n\n# ----> Ok, this is my addition <-----\nauto eth1                      \nallow-hotplug eth1             # i think hotplug it helps. not sure.\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.56.100         # arbitrary IP address between 2 and 254\n\nauto eth0                      # This is the original content\niface eth0 inet dhcp           #  of this file, now at the end.\n\nreboot.\n\nA: It would be easier to troubleshoot your problem if you posted the results you are getting when trying to ping an external address (like the Google DNS servers you're using), the current network settings, and your routing table.\n/sbin/ifconfig -a\n/sbin/route -n\n\nWithout knowing more this is a bit of a shot in the dark, but my guesses are that either a) you are not getting a DHCP address on eth0, or b) your gateway settings for eth1 are messing with the default route DHCP assigned.\nIf you're not getting a DHCP address for eth0, it's probably a misconfiguration in VirtualBox (like getting your adapters backwards).\nEither way, you don't need a gateway or DNS settings assigned specifically for eth1 since that will be assigned by DHCP on eth0, so I would remove the gateway, dns-search, and dns-nameservers lines from your config.  Your virtual machines will still be able to communicate without a gateway setting if they are on the same network and VirtualBox is set up right.\nEdit: To make sure you don't have a gateway on eth1 after a reboot, remove lines from your eth1 block so that it looks like this:\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.56.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\n\nWhen you're done, you won't have any gateway lines in your interfaces file.\n\nA: First of all, I enabled both networks NAT with DHCP and host only network with static ip add 192.168.40.41.\nThen, I followed with this command :\nnano cat /etc/network/interfaces\n\nI obtained this result:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.41.4\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\n\nAnd before rebooting, I typed the following command: \nsudo service networking restart\n\nThen rebooted.\nAfter I loaded to VM VirtualBox, both networks are working. I can connect to internet and I can connect to 192.168.40.41 through a web browser. \nI hope this will be helpful\nto get nano editor:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nano\n\nThen just type nano in terminal to start it.\n\nA: You have multiple default gateways assigned to different NICs. In general, \"Default\" means a preselected option. In this case, if a specified default gateway is defined to both NICs, it would not be a preselected option. In addition, this would also result in communication issues such as Asynchronous routing. I'm not sure how the Metric of both interfaces is set to 0, but it may be due to having both NICs with gateways. Microsoft's write-up about this is located here and the Metric feature has a number of factors that provide how it is determined for setting priorities. (Link: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/299540/an-explanation-of-the-automatic-metric-feature-for-ipv4-routes) \nIn agreement to @jkt123 in the answered response, there is only 1 default gateway that should be assigned. \n\nA: I've tried to set it by configuring /etc/network/interfaces but didn't work,\nThen I'd read about netplan then set my ip address in  /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml\n# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'\nnetwork:\n  ethernets:\n    enp0s10:\n      dhcp4: true\n    enp0s3:\n      dhcp4: true\n    enp0s8:\n      dhcp4: true\n    enp0s9:\n      addresses:\n      - 192.168.57.3/24\n      nameservers: {}\n  version: 2\n\n\nIt'd worked\n", "Q: Nautilus takes so long to open when I have a network folder mounted Im using Ubuntu Gnome 13.10 and nautilus takes a long to open when I have my NAS folders mounted on fstab.\nWhen I open Nautilus as root, its open quickly.\nWhat I have to do\n\nA: When you have a network drive mounted to your computer, it means it has to update the status every time you open nautilus. Because the drive will appear in the left pane where your bookmarks are.\nMy suggestion will be to unmount the drive when not used, in order to prevent the time it takes to load it every time nautilus is open, OR\nyou could let a window with Nautilus stay open in the background all the time, so it wont take that long for it to load.\nI am not rather sure if those suggestions will work out for you, but i guess so based on what i have experienced myself.

If so, what about once I've installed Ubuntu server after workstation?\nThanks for everyone's help. I know this is a tricky configuration, but there is reason to my madness.\n\nA: Yes, this is something grub is very much designed for. By default, when grub gets control during boot, it offers you an interactive menu on your console screen that lets you select which OS you want to run.  You can configure grub to automatically run your preferred OS after a delay, or right away, for your convenience.\nYou might like to be aware that with two Linux systems (in this case Ubuntu systems) installed, you can expect to have a /boot/grub directory on each disk partition, and grub gets some files from there, in particular the menu.lst that controls the menu offered to you during boot.  Grub will always use the same /boot/grub directory once both Linux systems are both installed unless and until you ask for re-installation of grub itself, so it is not a big deal.\nAnd yes, grub will recognize your windows installs and all of your Linux installs.\n", "Q: Can I reuse other OS /home directory for Ubuntu?

We are using the same network, how can I check the network users group? How can I access their machine with local ip address?\n\nA: You have two questions.\nhow can I check the network users?\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask your router. Usually the router's address is 192.168.0.1. You can find out yours by issuing ip route. You can normally access a webpage by typing that address in your browser. Look for DHCP or Computers there. It'll probably ask you for user and password, which depends on the router's make, but is usually admin/admin.\n\n*(Easier!) Probe the local ip range and display results. A tool to do that (and much more) is nmap. To list all clients on the local network you can issue nmap -F 192.168.*.*, although nmap -F 192.168.0.* is usually enough for home networks and much, much, faster. If you want to see the operating system of each computer listed, use nmap -O -F 192.168.0.* - you'll need root privileges for that.\nHow can I access their machine with local ip address?\nAs root, initiate ssh in both computers: service ssh start. Then, from your computer, issue ssh user@ip. You now have full access to that user account on that computer. You can use scp or rsync to copy files between computers, or use software like samba to share printers and much more.\nNote: In order for a computer to be accessible via ssh from outside the local network, you'll need to forward port 22 on the router to that computer, and if you have a firewall enabled, add an exception as appropriate.\n", "Q: Booting directly from LiveUSB on a USB Stick with Ubuntu 12.04 I have created a bootable USB stick from the 12.04 build of Ubuntu and I'm finding it is better for my laptop than the Windows Vista that came on it.\nHowever, I don't want to create a dual boot system at this time.  \nIs there a way to disable the \"Try It\" or \"Install It\" window when the system starts up so that it boots directly to the desktop from the USB stick?\nThank you in advance.\nColby\n\nA: Yes, you can use these ways on your flash drive to directly skip to Try Ubuntu or Install Ubuntu.\nThere are 3 ways:\nThe easy way: Download UNetBootin or PendriveLinux for Windows. Select your ISO, in this case, Ubuntu 12.04 LiveCD since you want it to boot directly to Ubuntu and not the menus. Select the Ubuntu ISO you downloaded, and the directory of your flash drive. If you want to prevent deletion of files every time you boot, check the \"Enable Persistence\" box. Just press Next and that's it! Your 12.04 Ubuntu will boot up directly to LiveCD. \nThe alternate easy way: If your bootable stick already has persistence (preventing deletion of files every time you boot), then open up Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type this command:\nsudo apt-get purge ubiquity\n\nThis will remove Ubiquity, the LiveCD Installer. (Warning: You may not be able to Install Ubuntu using your USB after this.)\nThe not-so-easy way: Using YUMI or some other software, add a GRUB Bootloader to your USB stick and modify the boot menu to directly skip to LiveCD. I don't have any knowledge of this, you may want to consult other users. \nBut the first option is the best and does it's job without fuss.

My question is how do I reissue the Snakeoil cert that comes with Openssl?\nThe cert that it is currently using was issued in 2012, so clearly before this incident. So it seems like the protocol here is to reissue all certs and I cant find info on how to do so for snakeoil.\nI am the only one who uses that cert, for PHPmyadmin, so do I even need to update it?\n\nA: You can use this one-liner to regenerate both files in one shot.  You'll need to restart Apache after the cert has been re-created.\nopenssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem\n\nIf you're at all concerned about security (and you should be), then you should regenerate certificates on all affected critical servers, followed by an exhaustive service restart or a system reboot.\nIf you're just running a play-around box on your LAN that's one thing, but anything you've got on the internet you should definitely reissue.\n\nA: Here I found that there is this command:\nsudo make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil --force-overwrite\n\n", "Q: What's the \"Spell Hint\" is on Ubuntu 12.04 I've no idea about what the system-wide \"Spell Hint\" exactly is, but, whenever I press Ctrl+Alt+H, I'll be prompted \"spell hint is enabled | disabled\".\nObviously, It's a toggle key for a spell hint app (or feature of some app). \nMy problem is: I used to set this short key, Ctrl+Alt+H for my IntelliJ IDEA, but now it doesn't work. And I couldn't figure out which app has taken this hot key and I've no idea how to unset it.\n\nA: I met the same problem with Ubuntu 14.04. In my case, it seems to be related with my keyboard?/language? input method Fcitx (for Japanese input) rather than Ubuntu. So if you don't use Fcitx, my advice might not be useful. Or it might be a problem of Japanese keyboard/input.\nYou can find \"Input Method Configuration\" window by clicking a top-right keyboard icon.\nIn \"Input Method tab\" of the window, there will be list of your keyboard and input method.\nDouble-click your keyboard in the list, \"Toggle the word hint\" field uses Ctrl+Alt+H.

Is it good for gaming or virtual machines? This is a performance question:\nMy machine always runs Ubuntu as the main, and as I login, it always starts up a Windows VM and firefox? If I install memcached, will it improve my performance?\nI notice that the cpu is always pegged by the windows VM, but for hard drive performance will memcached work? (Are the default settings enough or do I need to configure memcached specifically for the VM?\n\nA: No, memcached is not good for gaming or virtual machines.\nMemcached is a daemon (a program that stays in the background and responds to requests) allowing application developers to easily implement memory storage that is shared between separate processes, especially in web applications.\nTraditionally, web applications run every individual web request in a separate environment that is initialised at the start of the request and destroyed at the end, and/or in multiple separate processes that share no memory with each other.  This allows no \"objects\" or other variables stored in memory to persist between separate requests.  This is true, for example, of PHP.\nMemcached is a process that web applications can connect to and use for storing persistent variables, values and objects in memory.  The stored data can then persist between different web requests.\nThis is immensely useful when each web request needs data from a relatively slow storage mechanism such as a database server accessed over a network socket. Instead of each web request causing a new request to the database server, the application may choose to \"cache\" some of these requests in a memcached instance so that future requests can just access this.\nMemcached also has advanced features allowing these shared memory objects to be distributed across multiple servers, and the like.\nMemcached needs to be installed separately to the web server (eg Apache, nginx) and application server (eg PHP) for web applications that require it.\n\nA: Generally \"memcached\" is a technology that improve web server's performance.\nif you do not run a web server, I think it's not your concern.\nif you mean memcached is a RAM, I think it is helpful. furthermore, I would like to say use a SSD instead HDD.\n", "Q: Cannot install anything with software centre or apt-get I recently installed ubuntu 12.04 in virtual box.

I had a dual boot before and did not really like Windows anyway. Now when I boot it without the CD I get this error message:\nerror: unknown filesystem. \ngrub resuce>\n\nI am not sure what to do with this error message. I have saved all my data from all 4 hard drives in the desktop. I am not sure which one Ubuntu is on, as I am totally new to this. I have tried to fix this for a month and have been unsuccessful. I am happy to reformat anything if this is going to help me, although I would not know how to do that either. Can anyone out there help? Please treat me like a real beginner as far as the steps and terminology are concerned. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Reformatting and re-installing Ubuntu\nYou wanted it, and i will try my best to make you understand the progress on how to fix this. Lets assume that something went wrong during the installation of the OS. It could be that your pc was restarted before it could finish the installation, or the GRUB boot loader wasn't properly installed. Now, i am going to show you how to reformat the harddrive, which from my view, seem to be the easiest and best solution to your problem.\n\n*\n\n*Make sure to put in your LiveCD, and start up the Ubuntu Installation again. When you come to the step where it asks you to wipe any old installations on your system, you should choose \"Something Else\"\n\n\n\n*When you have, it will appear a new window (image below). You will have one or more partition the list. A partition is in many ways a virtual hard-drive, but is physically just space divided into different sections on your harddrive. However, this step isn't that hard. Select the hard-drive using \"ext3\" or \"ext4\" located under type and click delete. (Be sure you are doing changes on your hard-drive and that you don't have any other devices like memory sticks inserted while you do this)\n\n\n\n\n*Now you have deleted that file-system from your hard-drive. on this step, you must select the partition you just deleted the file system from, and click add.\n\n\n*A new window pops up. Make sure primary is selected. From the menu in the \"Use as\", select EXT4 Journaling File System.\nThe Size you have as default, should be subtracted with 1024. (if you have 2048 as default, you should enter a value like this: 2048-1024 = 1024) --> this will be used as Swap. Now, click OK.\nNow you have an empty partition, a small one. Select that small one, and click add. Leave the Partition size as it is here, and from the list on Use As: you simply select Swap and click ok.\n\nOnce you are happy with the changes you have made, click “Install now” and you are good to go. Hopefully this installation will work.\nGood luck, got questions --> just ask :)\n", "Q: Failed to execute child process \"palimpset\" (No such file or directory) I just started using Linux and Lubuntu.

I have also connected a sata hard drive, and it's working fine. I can move files to and from it, watch movie files from it using Gnome mplayer. I'm just mentioning this as it may rule out any problems with the hardware.\nWhen I right click on the screen, a menu opens up with the title \"Openbox\". I think this\nis something I installed separately using apt-get, but I can't remember now. In the menu there is a selection for 'Accessories->Disk Utility'.

They were located here:  \n/etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml  \n/usr/share/lubuntu/openbox/menu.xml  \n\nThe entries in the first file didn't match the menu that openbox was displaying, but the entries in the second file did.\nI changed the section below, in the second file, replacing 'palimpset' with 'gnome-disks':\n<item label=\"Disk utility\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>palimpset</command>\n    <startupnotify>\n      <enabled>yes</enabled>\n    </startupnotify>\n  </action>\n</item>\n\nJust some rambling:\nIt's a couple of days later, and I had the thought that maybe there is still a problem somewhere. It doesn't make any sense that the Openbox menu should contain 'default' entries, regardless of whether you have those apps or not. I wondered if, on start up, Openbox looks for a file with information about installed apps, and maybe that file has the wrong information. But that can't be it either, because whatever you write into Openbox's menu.xml file is what you get on the screen. It's all very strange, at least to a newcomer.  \nThanks to:\n girardengo\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/Openbox\nThread: Edit desktop context menu in lubuntu?\n(ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2197247)\nAlso the person that helped in editing the post, whose icon has disappeared.\n\nA: Palimpsest Disk Utility, also known as gnome-disk-utility, gnome-disks or Disks)  is a udisks graphical front-end included in the gnome-disk-utility package.\nDisks was previously known as GNOME Disk Utility or palimpsest.\nPalimpsest Disk Utility is based on Udisks for operations on the disks while GTK + for graphics, so require D-Bus and ServerX to run.\nTo change the parameters of the hard disk you can use hdparm. hdparm is a command line utility for the Linux to set and view ATA hard disk drive hardware parameters.\nIe, if you want change spindown:\nsudo hdparm -S 25 /dev/sdX \n\nor\nsudo hdparm -S 25 /dev/disk/by_uuid/your_uuid_disk\n\nYou can modify the /etc/hdparm.conf to make permanent settings even after reboot. \nRefer to man hdparm for a complete list of parameters and more help.\n", "Q: Trouble booting into Ubuntu with UEFI I was hoping you all could help. Ive done a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10 on my Dell laptop. When I shut down then restart I get an error msg on my Dell screen which reads \"Start PXE over IPv6 -- Start PXE over IPv4 -- PXE-E18 server responce timeout\". This lasts on the screen for about three to four minutes then successfully boots into my OS. I checked my BIOS screen and boot order. Under \"boot list options\" UEFI is selected, but my HD is not in the boot order. It only shows the UEFI IP4 and UEFI IP6.\nHOWEVER, if I hit f12 at startup and select \"boot from hard drive\" in Legacy mode, it boots right into my OS. My question is, is it safe to change the boot list options in BIOS to Legacy instead of UEFI?\nUPDATE\nI think I figured out my issue. When I installed, I booted onto the Ubuntu Live DVD in Legacy and not UEFI. Thus installing it in Legacy mode. Does this sound like what could be causing the issue? Do I need to reinstall in UEFI mode or can I safely still use Legacy?  What about installing GRUB in UEFI from the Live DVD?\n\nA: Solved I reinstalled in UEFI mode and now it boots into my OS as it should. The issue was cause by initially installing in legacy BIOS by mistake.\n\nA: Somewhere in your BIOS menu there must be some command to allow you to disable that PXE (network) boot. Either this or move PXE in boot menu - boot devices order to the last position after CD/DVD-ROM, HDD and USB.\n", "Q: How to start tomcat7 when catalina.sh does not work?

Of course, my guest OS sees only broken symlinks - because these locations exist only in the main OS.\nHow can I make my Guest OS see the actual content of them?\nCreating another shared folder is not an option.\n\nA: Short answer is it cannot be done.\nThe following ticket on virtualbox.org has some clarification:\n\nThis change is intentional, and fixes a problem with the current\n  implementation of shared folders. For compatibility with guest OSes\n  which have no idea what a symlink is it is at the moment interpreted\n  on the host side, and this means one get unexpected behavior with\n  guest OSes which know what a symlink is (e.g. if a symlink on a shared\n  folder mounted at /foo would point to /bar/file it's impossible to do\n  the right thing on the host side).\nIt's of course fixable, but far from trivial as the separation of\n  symlink processing between guest OS side and host side needs to be\n  redesigned. This can't be done quickly, so the only option was to\n  disable symlink creation. Too many users/applications were caught by\n  surprise by the non-standard behavior.\n\nSource\n\nA: It is a problem in virtualBox and has to do with security. Before 4.1.8 symlinks worked but was seriously flawed. And the discision was made to remove symlink support.\nSee this comment:\nSymbolic link creation from within a guest has been disabled in VirtualBox 4.1.8 for security reasons. A guest could create symbolic links which point outside the assigned host directory. This has nothing to do with any ext3/ext4 bug. And the guest is still able to read symlinks which are created on the host.\nSorry for the late statement.\nIf you do\n VBoxManage setextradata VM_NAME VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/SHARE_NAME 1\n\nThen your guest will be able to create symlinks again. But for security reasons (see above) this is disabled by default. The fix to prevent dangerous symlinks from the guest is very complicated, therefore we decided to not allow any guest to create any symlink to work around the security problem.\n(I took the liberty to fix a bug in the comment ;) )\n\n\n*\n\n*and also take note that you need to restart vBox for the change to activate.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu does not detect my USB connected phone I connected my phone using an USB cord to my desktop, but Ubuntu does not detect the phone. \nHow do i transfer files to and fro from my computer ? \n\nA: Android: Open notifications, and see if \"USB Connected\" is coming up.

Software manufacturers may fail to create 64 bit packages for this kind of applications. To install 32 bit packages on 64 bit Ubuntu systems, you have to add the above command.(sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386). It adds 32 bit architecture to 64 bit systems which in turn helps to install packages which are in 32 bit form.\nNo, the above command won't change completely the system architecture from 64 to 32bit, it adds support to install 32 bit packages on 64 bit systems.\nOne best example is, Skype.

Having said that, Exchange servers usually support POP and IMAP connections if I'm not mistaken. In which case, you can use clients like Thunderbird, Entourage.. etc. Nevertheless, this will not give the complete experience of the Exchange services. Anyhow, If you're to make a use of POP/IMAP service, it should be allowed from the Exchange side.\nNow coming back to Exchange configuration; I've not tested it completely but Evolution worked well with mine.\nInstallation\nInstalling the client is pretty straightforward and available to install in official repo's (but I would still recommend to add your Ubuntu version when posting a question which will help us to assist better). Simply open the Ubuntu Software Center and search for Evolution, then hit on install as seen below.\n\nEmail Configuration\nEmail configuration is pretty straightforward too. You can go through the process of adding a new mail account just like you do it on a Microsoft Outlook client. Meanwhile, I've found a video log on Connecting Evolution (On Ubuntu 11.10) to Exchange 2010 which may help you to further understand.\nP.S.

I think the reason is because I have no understanding of what type of threats are possible towards me. So blindly following tutorials without any objective of my own is getting boring. \nTo give you an idea of my understanding; how does the existence of ports cause threats? and even if this question is answered I wouldn't know what else to look out for. \nWhat I would like your help in is suggested reading, to start someone on taking control of their own security. To understand the scope of the battle field and identify what will effect me. \nThe documentation should be technical in nature to properly understand cause and effect.  \nIf you can also categorize using the following genres: \n\n\n*\n\n*Global information on threats \n\n*Beginners information on Threats/Security \n\n*Interim \n\n*Advance\n\n\nThank you,\n\nA: Beginners information on Threats/Security\nSome might consider this question too broad, but narrowing it down to just the desktop because of your desktop-environments tag, start with these three rules: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use a strong password that is impossible for anyone to guess, and if you write your password down, don't leave your password anywhere where people might be able to find it.\n\n*Don't install crapware. Use the Ubuntu Software Center as your software source. \n\n*If you have issues about security when other people have physical access to your computer, encrypt the disk that Ubuntu is installed on and use a strong password to access the encrypted volume.\n\nA: I cannot provide the reading material you need exactly, but let me tell you what do most Ubuntu users agree universally:\nIt's safe. The Communications-Electronics Security Group of the United Kingdom Government tested many OSes, and Ubuntu was given the highest score among these. There are very few viruses for Linux, and the latest Ubuntu releases already have these patched, hence you'll never find an anti-virus made for Linux issues-most that are available for Linux are meant to prevent Windows viruses from being transmitted.\nIt's stable. Very stable. The chances of an Ubuntu PC crashing frequently is way less than a Windows PC.  \nTop IT-and other-cos rely on Ubuntu. Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Heroku, Amazon.... so many of your favourite and necessary websites are powered by Ubuntu server. Sony uses an Ubuntu PC to compile the firmware for every Xperia smartphone. Studios like Pixar and Weta Digital, and movies like James Cameron's Avatar used server farms running Ubuntu to generate their movies.\nHighest on reliability. Governments and high-risk organizations use Linux and Ubuntu to store and process data since getting through it's safety is not an easy task.\nPorts do not increase your risk. All versions of Ubuntu ports-Edubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu etc. are based on a version of Ubuntu. If there are issues, then it's universal across each Ubuntu port and the primary base OS, not just a particular port.\nStop worrying. You're better with Ubuntu than Windows. \n", "Q: Disabling touch screen only temporarily My touchscreen is cracked, so the pointer continuously clicks on the cracked area.

Every time its just asks for reboot and does nothing. \n\nA: First create a bootable pendrive with ISO using  any tool(unetbootin) then boot with penderive from boot priority option in BIOS then you will get the all installation option .\n\nA: It sounds like you've booted from the Ubuntu disk but neglected to actually install it to your HDD.  There should be an 'Install Ubuntu 13.10' icon on the desktop and on the pre-mount screen - it may take some time to get there, nobody ever said booting from a CD/DVD/USB was very fast.  \nRun through those instructions, then reboot.  Here's official docs, if you somehow missed them.\nIf you've already installed Ubuntu, it's because Windows is greedy and rewrites the master boot record to only point to itself, making it so that it bypasses GRUB and Ubuntu.  Typically, this comes from Ubuntu being installed before Windows, but it can happen in other situations.  \nBurn this .iso to a disk and load and run it after Windows is installed. It'll restore the boot log and you'll see GRUB again and everything should be happy.\n", "Q: mysql problem with login in terminal I read many post including https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MysqlPasswordReset this one one all of method.

I've already checked the md5 hash for the downloaded iso and DVD files after burning. \nI have several problems that recur with my installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*At first, my install would go slow as molasses, with only the\noccasional sluggish sign of activity (DVD/HD lights, etc.) before\ngetting stuck at various points early in the process.  I researched\nand found that often NVidia cards are the culprit (which I have). \nSo I tried the nomodeset option, and that finally seemed to get\nthings going (DVD/HD lights flashing regularly, progress indicator\nprogressing, etc.)  But then the install always froze at the\n\"Creating User\" step.  Per another forum post, I've been trying to\nredo the process doing a \"noquiet\" so I can find out exactly which\nstep is causing the issue, but I haven't been able to because...\n\n*Now when I try to either boot from the DVD or run the install\nprogram, I get the error messages:\n\nbuffer I/O error on device sr1, sector nnnn.\nata_id[257]: HDIO_GET_IDENTITY failed for '/dev/sr1/': No message of desired type.\n(initramfs) Unable to find live file system.  \n\nAt first I thought it was due to the earlier faulty installs:  I\nwent back in Windows to clear out the intended Ubuntu partitions (regular and swap).  But now I\nam wondering if this is due to the DVD drive:  it appears to freeze\nduring the boot process and not respond in time.  A \"noquiet\"\nboot-run reveals error messages like \"soft resetting link...ata slow\nto respond...forcing hard reset...etc.\"  As a test, one time I tried\nto eject the DVD during the process when things got stuck:  it would\nnot respond until the boot process finished failing and I was forced\nto reboot.  This is all odd because this DVD drive worked fine\npreviously in attempted installs, and still works fine in Windows\nXP!

My computer's BIOS did not allow USB as a boot option, so for those users in a similar boat, I would suggest the solution I found:  Plop, a special bootmanager that you can burn to CD.  After setting your computer to look to your CDrom drive first at system startup for a bootable drive, Plop will engage and allow you to select any input interface (hard drive, USB port, CDrom, etc.) to boot from.\nI did this and found I was still having trouble at the \"Create User\" step when installing Ubuntu, even from USB.  I did a bit of research, and I think I saw somewhere that configuring your installation settings to \"encrypt your home folder\" could cause issues...I'm not sure if that's due to a bug or if it's because of some users' large home-folder size.

I want to make a  unattended installation of the Ubunbu Server 12.04 LTS using preseed.\nMy partition layout needs to create a partition without formatting and mounting it.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: You'll want to use a partman-auto/expert_recipe, but change the attributes for the partition you don't want to have formatted to method{ keep }.  You need to remove format{ }, filesystem{ }, and use_filesystem{ }.\nYou will also want to add the following lines to your preseed file:\npartman-basicfilesystems partman-basicfilesystems/no_mount_point boolean false\nd-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true\nd-i partman/choose_partition select finish\nd-i partman/confirm boolean true\n\nHere's a link to the example preseed file for Ubuntu 12.04.

As explained on the Tor page, This should include the following message:\ngpg: Good signature\n\nOnce the signature is verified, the archive can be extracted. This can be done by right clicking and selecting the \"Extract\" option.\nNavigating into this folder will then allow running Tor. The .exe file is for use under Windows. The start-tor-browser is a script that will run under Ubuntu to start Tor.\nThis will give three options: Terminal, Display, and Run.\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal will run the script in a terminal, which is useful if you want to see output from the script\n\n*Display will just open the script for editing with a text editor\n\n*Run will just run the script like any other program\n\n\nRun is fine unless you are troubleshooting or need to see something that is shown in the terminal.\nIt should not ask you for a password. Programs that do important tasks like installing software need to ask permission to do so, which is why Software Center and others might ask for a password. The Tor browser shouldn't need any extra permissions.\n", "Q: Is my kernel safe to use? I am running Ubuntu server 12.04 and my fresh installation is using the 3.2.0-60-generic kernel, however when I go to https://www.kernel.org/ it says the latest stable kernel is only 3.14\nI don't want to run into problems down the line.\n\nA: I think the OP might be (or was) under the mistaken impression that 3.2 is newer than 3.14 because he's viewing 3.2 > 3.14 in a decimal sense instead of thinking about three separate numbers.  He said \" the latest stable kernel is only 3.14,\" which makes me think his concern is that 3.2 is too \"bleeding edge.\" He's obviously good to use 3.2 in either case as was rightly pointed out, but I wanted to make sure he understood the versioning system for future concerns.\n\nA: Yes, the 3.2.0 kernel is absolutely safe to use. \nLinux distributions (Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 13.10, CentOS 6.5, etc.) will typically choose, and stay at, a base kernel version in order to maintain security, stability, and other features that might cause issues if moving to a newer kernel. \nThe newer kernel versions usually have cool, \"bleeding-edge\" features (performance improvements, updated drivers, etc.), but with the sacrifice of being less stable and less tested. The 3.2.0 kernel has been tested and vetted by dozens of organizations and individuals that have made absolutely sure that it is stable enough to host \"production-ready\" applications and environments.\nTo compare, CentOS 6.5 runs kernel version 2.6.32-431, which multiple enterprise organizations use to host mission-critical applications and devices.\n\nA: LTS\nThe kernel released with 12.04 server at its outset was v3.2.\nCanonical have committed to supporting v3.2 of the kernel:\n\nThe original 12.04 stack in Precise will remain supported for the\nusual 5yr life cycle of the LTS release.\n\nsource\nWhat this means is that the kernel v3.2 will receive security and other stability fixes throughout the 5 years of the support period.\nNewer kernels are available for each point release - these are called enablement stacks and are primarily for newer hardware.  You dont need to install these if kernel 3.2 is just running fine on your hardware.\nObviously, if you need to add newer hardware cards to your server you should first check that the cards work with the kernel 3.2 series.  Likewise, if you image the server to install on newer hardware, then you should similarly check 3.2 compatibility.\n\nLinked Blog:\n\n*\n\n*http://www.jorgecastro.org/2013/02/19/what-the-lts-enablement-stack-means-for-sysadmins/\nLinked Wiki:\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack\nLinked Question:\n\n*\n\n*How to remove Kernel/LTS Enablement Stack?\n", "Q: Installation of Wireless Printer Canon Pixma MG5450 How do I install my Canon Pixma MG5450.\nI have downloaded the Linux drivers from Canon for the MG5450 but my Ubuntu 12.04 does not recognise them.\n\nA: Upgrade to 14.04 will help.\nI connect my wireless Canon MG without installing any additional driver.

I've burned the iso on a dvd, and installed the help boot. Then it asked to reboot, after that it took me to the ubuntu purple screen and it went smooth, I could try the features of ubuntu, entered Mozilla and everything. But when I put install Ubuntu 13.10 (inside of Ubuntu interface), guided me through the steps. But since I couldn't see the guided installation on the ubuntu website, I forgot to check 'install third party apps' or something like that. So when I finally put 'Install', an error message pop up \"Error informing the kernel about modifications to partition /dev/sda2 - Device or resource busy. This means that Linux won't know about any changes you made to /dev/sda2  until you reboot - so you shouldn't mount it or use it in any way before rebooting\" I tried to click Ignore, cancel, close it. But it did nothing, behind this message, was the location map. The rest of the ubuntu interface worked just fine, except I couldn't go back to windows or close that error message. So I rebooted, after the startup screen (not the windows one), it went black screen with flashing/intermitent white dash. Just that. I can't do anything else in there but rebooting. \nI'm new in all of this and I'm starting to regret installing ubuntu at all. From what I've tried, I can access BIOS, but then I'm completely lost.\n\nA: Are you still able to boot the Ubuntu DVD?\nIf yes, select Try Ubuntu and, after getting to the Desktop, press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal.\nNow enter cat /var/log/boot.log and tell whether any errors are listed there. Also search cat /var/log/kern.log for errors.\n\nIf this experience scared you away from Linux and you just want to go back to Windows, open the program GParted and set a boot flag to your Windows partition. Remove the boot flag from the Ubuntu partition. Now try to reboot.\nIf you can reboot into Windows, and want to remove Ubuntu, just reboot to the Ubuntu DVD, open GParted and delete the Ubuntu partiton and the SWAP partition.\nResize the Windows partition to use the new free space to get the space usable again. NOTE: Before doing this, have a backup of your personal data from Windows, because partitioning can always cause problems.\n\nTo all the Moderators: I know this doesn't answer the original question, but I'm going to add additional instructions when I know more about the prob and am able to help.\n", "Q: Three OS in one system I have been using Ubuntu and Windows, which are installed side by side for about 2 and a half year by now(although I hardly open Windows) and I've had my Ups and Downs.\nBut now I'm trying to install another OS(CHROME OS) along with them on a third partition.\nWill it pose any problem for my Current OSs.\nThat is should I do it or not.\n\nA: It shouldn't pose any real threat IF you do it right.

But there are other shortcuts which I don't know how to disable, like Alt+RightClick.\nDoes anyone know how to disable them all just when I use Blender.\nthank you!\nP.S.: I use Ubuntu 14.04 (no more 13.10)\nIn fact, the problem is that Blender and Unity shortcuts interfere, unlike with the KDE desktop, but I don't want to install KDE just for Blender.\n\nA: Most of the keyboard shortcuts in blender can be customised. All editable shortcuts are listed in the user preferences under input.\nThe menu next to the search field allows you to search by name or key-binding. For Alt+RightClick search for mouse in keybinding. I doubt any mouse clicks will conflict though as they are clicks in the blender window for it to respond.\nYou can export the keyboard setup so that you can re-import it later or by saving user settings the same setup will be active each time you start blender.\n", "Q: Why does su fail with \"authentication error\"? I tried to su to root so I could install lights, but I get an authentication error when I try:  \nuser@host:~$ su\nPassword: \nsu: Authentication failure\n\n\nA: Use sudo your_command in place of su. ie\nsudo apt-get install \"program to install\"\n\n\nA: The root account is disabled by default in Ubuntu, so there is no root password, that's why su fails with an authentication error.\nUse sudo to become root:  \nsudo -i  \n\n\nA: If su doesn't work, I do this (in bash):\nuser@host:~$ sudo bash\nroot@host:~# su\nroot@host:/home/user# \n\nVoila! You are now root!\nA shortcut for this would be sudo su. In this case given that you are a member of /etc/sudoers with all privileges, then you would only need your user's password.\n\nA: You are getting Authentication failure because you are trying to become root which is disabled by default in all versions of Ubuntu. This can be easily circumvented in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enabling the root account. This can be achieved by setting up a password.\n\n*Instead of su use sudo -i or better yet, append to any command sudo in the way of:\nsudo apt-get update\n[sudo] password for braiam:\n\nI wouldn't recommend enabling root, since it could raise a security concern, for example, if you use any service exposed to the web.\n\nA: Open root with sudo -s and when it's in this mode type:\n\npasswd\n\nThen, choose password. This password will be for su command.\n", "Q: Will Trusty/14.04 Installation Media come without Ubuntu One? As Ubuntu One has been shut down now, and the current build of 14.04 'Trusty' still comes with Ubuntu One (and U1 Music, etc with it):\n\n*\n\n*Would Ubuntu One come with the final release as well? Please check the Trusty Release Schedule; the Final Beta was released on March 27.\nIf it does, I think it'd lead to a huge confusion for users, and also embarrassment for people like me who'd have to tell new migrants (from the Windows world) that this service has now been shut down.\n\n\n*Also, as U1 is now dead, how would the users of the Phone version on Trusty sync their Contacts, Files, Music, etc?\n\n\n*Would 13.10 LIVE DVD images also be updated to incorporate this change?\n\nA: The client packages for file sync have already been removed from the 14.04 archive, yes. However, if you upgrade, the client will not be removed unless you choose to allow it to be removed during the process.\nContacts sync has been shut down for a long time already. You are not using it on any current phone version of the client with Ubuntu One. Also, the phone apps did not support synchronization. You could only download individual files from the service. Only auto-upload was supported, only for photos. The music streaming app will stop working on June 1. The Android and iOS apps will be removed from the respective stores at some point.\nThe 13.10 install image will never change. However, 13.10 will also no longer be supported, after July 2014, and it is already impossible for new users to sign up for the service.\n\nA: Currently using 14.04 and it doesn't have any of the U1 services.If you are upgrading from previous versions, they should be removed. \n2 About contact/email/storage/music syncing its already been answered here\n Ubuntu one FAQs.\n3 As 13.10 is not a LTS release, it will soon be dead.

In case of shell-builtins (eg type itself):\n$ type type\ntype is a shell builtin\n\n$ which type\n<Doesn't return anything since it's a shell builtin, silently exits>\n\nIn case of commands (normally) (eg python):\n$ type python\npython is /usr/bin/python\n\n$ which python\n/usr/bin/python\n\nIn case of which (which is a command located at /usr/bin/which)\n$ type which\nwhich is hashed (/usr/bin/which)\n$ which which\n/usr/bin/which\n\nWhy does type which say that which is hashed? What is the significance of which being hashed and what does it actually mean?\n\nA: You likely have a long PATH set and, to find an executable, the shell needs to search the path.  To avoid that time consuming process every time that you want to run a program, the shell may keep a list of programs that it has already found.  That list is called a \"hash.\"  When the shell says that which is hashed, it means that it has already done the PATH search and found which and saved its location in the hash.\nman bash explains it as follows:\n\nBash uses a hash table to remember the full pathnames of\n         executable files (see hash under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS  below).\n         A full search of the directories in PATH is performed only if\n         the command is not found in the hash table.\n\nWhile the hash normally speeds up shell operations, there is one case where it causes problems.  If you update your system and, as a result, some executable moves to a new location, the shell may get confused.  The solution is to run hash -r which causes the shell to forget all the hashed locations and search the PATH from scratch.\nWhy are some executables missing from the hash?\nAn executable is not placed in the hash until after you execute at least once.  Observe:\n$ type python\npython is /usr/bin/python\n$ python --version\nPython 2.7.3\n$ type python\npython is hashed (/usr/bin/python)\n\npython is hashed only after it has been executed.\nHow to examine what is in bash's hash\nThe contents of the hash are available in the bash array BASH_CMDS.  You can see what is in it with the command declare -p BASH_CMDS.  When a new shell or subshell is opened, the hash is empty.  Commands are added one by one as they are used.  From a newly opened shell, observe:\n$ declare -p BASH_CMDS\ndeclare -A BASH_CMDS='()'\n$ which which\n/bin/which\n$ declare -p BASH_CMDS\ndeclare -A BASH_CMDS='([which]=\"/bin/which\" )'\n$ python --version\nPython 2.7.3\n$ declare -p BASH_CMDS\ndeclare -A BASH_CMDS='([which]=\"/bin/which\" [python]=\"/usr/bin/python\" )'\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Bumblebee vs Nvidia GeForce GT 740M After a week checking a lot of references about bumblebee/nvidia, I decided to post this new Thread.

I'm using Lubuntu 13.10 amd64bit. I have Gparted installed, but how can I make a 1 gigabyte partition? It says MiB.\n\nA: Not everyone uses gigabyte with the same meaning. Gigabyte can mean 1 000 000 000 bytes, or 1 073 741 824 bytes.\nPersonally I use the IEC standard in which a gigabyte equates to 1 000 000 000 bytes, and a gibibyte is 1 073 741 824 bytes. Ubuntu\nalso officially uses this standard.\nSteps:\nOption #1 = If you consider a gigabyte to be 1 073 741 824 bytes, then input 1024 MiB in Gparted.\nOption #2 = If you consider a gigabyte to be 1 000 000 000 bytes, as Ubuntu officially does then input 954 MiB [Which is slightly over as it should be 953.67431640625 MiB]\nUseful Information:\nIf you consider a gigabyte to be 1 000 000 000 bytes then you can use parted to verify the size after partitioning in Gparted.\n\"sudo parted -l\"\n\nThis will list the disk and partition sizes in gigabytes or megabytes with the assumption that 1 000 000 000 bytes is a gigabyte.\nScreenshot of this = https://copy.com/NL3KZjzQRsre\nNotes:\nI believe Windows operating systems refer to a gigabyte as 1 073 741 824 bytes, as in this rather old article they refer\nto divisions by 1024 rather than 1000. Things may be different now as this article is pre-NT. #h#t#t#p#://support.microsoft.com/kb/121839\nSources:\nhttp://postbin.djun.net/pages/article19/page.php\nh#t#t#p#s#://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy\n\nA: MiB stands for mebibyte (1,048,576 bytes) - so you need 1024MiB to create 1 gigabyte.\nNobody means \"1,000,000,000\" when they say \"gigabyte\", other than some hard-disk manufacturers when they're telling you drive capacities, and you'd never need to type that in anyplace - so whatever you think you mean by \"1gb\": it is 99.9% likely to be 1024 MiB and not anything else.\n", "Q: Installing Koala (Development Kit) in Ubuntu I've recently switched to Ubuntu.

However, when I try to import the module, it raises an ImportError:\n import pandas as pd\n File \"/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/pandas/__init__.py\", line 15, in <module>\n    raise ImportError('ImportError: C extensions not built: if you installed already verify that you are not importing from the source directory')\n\nThe call in /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/pandas/__init__.py is:\nimport pandas.lib as lib\nexcept Exception:  # pragma: no cover\n    import sys\n    e = sys.exc_info()[1] # Py25 and Py3 current exception syntax conflict\n    if 'No module named' in str(e):\n        raise ImportError('C extensions not built: if you installed already '\n                          'verify that you are not importing from the source '\n                          'directory')\n    else:\n        raise\n\nWhy do I get ImportError and how do I solve this?\nFollowing is what I get when trying to import the dependencies of Pandas in an interactive Python shell:\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> import dateutil\n>>> import pytz\n>>> import numexpr\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: No module named numexpr\n>>> import bottleneck\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: No module named bottleneck\n\n\nA: Following are the dependencies for Pandas:\n\n\n*\n\n*NumPy\n\n*python-dateutil\n\n*pytz\n\n\nAnd the Pandas project list the following two as highly recommended dependencies:\n\n\n*\n\n*numexpr\n\n*bottleneck\n\n\nIt looks like apt-get only installed the required dependencies and not the highly recommended ones; as such you get an ImportError when trying to import numexpr and bottleneck. Installing these modules should most probably solve the problem.\nSince, you are running Python 2.7 as evident from Python Traceback, install these two modules as suggested below:\n\n\n*\n\n*numexpr is present in Ubuntu's repositories. So, install it by running:\nsudo apt-get install python-numexpr\n\n\n*bottleneck is not present in Ubuntu's repositories. So, install it using pip. We would also need to install build-essentials package in order to build bottleneck:\nsudo apt-get install python-pip build-essentials\nsudo pip install bottleneck\n\n\nA: Also, if a package was installed via easy_install, and now other dependency packages have been installed via PIP, this sort of issue can arise.\nTo fix, remove any/all modules installed via easy_install by rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/\"module_name\".  \nThen run pip install \"module_name\".\n", "Q: Failing to fetch some packages in update I want to get ruby on rails on ubuntu 12.04 but I'm coming across errors that say I need to to update.

How can I close multiple instances of Gedit windows through the command line?\nSome of the windows may contain changes to documents.  So, I would like to be prompted to save them or not.\nIf I use pkill gedit it will simply kill all instances without prompting to save changes.\n\nBackground info: Often, I have tons of windows open over multiple workspaces.  Some of them are Gedit windows with notes.  Thus, when running shutdown -h now shutdown will block because some windows contain changes to files or unsaved notes. Saving all instances with changes would prevent me from inspecting and closing all windows one by one.\n\nA: I do not think this is possible. You options are to enable backups and install gedit plugins. Session Saver (included in gedit-plugins) allows you to save you current workspace within gedit as it is, so that when you restore a session at a later time you can start right where you left your work.\nThere is also an additional package on sourceforge\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/geditautosaves/\n\nA: Gedit has an autosave mechanism built in that is turned off by default.\nPerhaps it works for your situation to simply enable this and tune it to a sufficiently low number of minutes.\n\nWith this method chances are at least minimized you will get a dialog that blocks your shutdown procedure.\n", "Q: apt-get remove --purge wine* removed everything! sudo apt-get remove --purge wine* opened the gates of hell and removed many things. I wasn't allowed to paste the output here, too big.  I stopped the process, I wanted to save what's left of my system!\n\n\n*\n\n*How  to reinstall what has been removed?\n\n*Why were these packages removed? It is the most important question, why the hell were they removed? I can't see any relation between Spotify and wine!\n\n*If apt-get --purge might destroy your system, how to remove wine then? I removed it from software center but many files were still there.\n\n*Can you ever trust apt-get -- purge? \n\n\nI'm on Xubuntu 14.04 64 bit.\n\nA: This particular problem bit me too. apt-get remove wine told me wine was not installed, while which wine and wine version were still functional. wine-devel and multiple other packages were installed though and you don't want to type them all one by one.\nIt's especially frustrating as you look at the list and actually see a lot of wine software getting removed as expected (as the list is displayed alphabetically they come close to last and take nearly the whole screen) and then hit Y.\nBoth answers provided here are wrong and it is not a misuse of the wildcard. It is beautifully explained in gertvdijk's answer to What is the correct way to completely remove an application?\nThe issue comes from apt-get interpreting the input as a regular expression and therefore interpreted the asterisk as \"zero or more times\" and not as the expected wildcard, resulting in removing any packages that contain the string win and any package that depends on such a package (which basically uninstalls nearly your whole system).\nThe command that would've done what I expected would've been\napt-get remove --purge 'wine.*'\n\nThat removes all packages whose names contain wine.\n\nA: Uninstall did this, not purge. Don't feel bad, I think we've all done it at one point in time or another.\nRun the command again, however, this time run the command \nsudo apt-get purge wine\n\nwithout the * mark and this time, submit \"n\" to not uninstall at this time. Now, before you execute the command again, you should take note of the list of programs that will be uninstalled along with wine so you may reinstall these programs after the purge and before the next reboot. \nI like to make a copy of this list that can be pasted into a text editor. Once copied into the text editor, you can remove all the paragraphs and * marks to make a smooth list that can be copied and pasted after a sudo apt-get install command to run immediately after the purge is done. Luckily, programs like Spotify retain their configuration files during this process as they were not explicitly marked to purge, only to uninstall so when you re-install them they should be good as new.\n\nA: Aside from @mchid's correct answer, the command you should've used was\nsudo apt-get remove wine\\* \n\nNotice the backslash. It instructs the shell not to open the wildcard, and pass it to apt-get as is instead. What happened is that your shell interpreted the wine* and passed a whole lot of package names for apt-get to remove, instead of just the ones you expected.\n", "Q: How to Tell if Network Traffic is Encrypted I'm using a program called LottaNZB to connect to a Usenet server.

Be cautious, many people have overwritten the HDD MBR as default location for boot loader is sda, any items in the internal drive's grub will be added to the USB's grub.\nYou may do an update-grub later.\n\nA: A very detailed answer would be beyond the scope of a single question, but here's the general outline. It's very easy, but success will partly depend on the ability of your computer to boot from an external hard drive. This depends on the bios.\nBefore starting, make sure your bios has an option to boot from a USB HD.\nIf all you need is the basic install, Python 2.7, and the C compiler, you can get away with installing Ubuntu to a fairly small partition. I forget the literal minimum Ubuntu needs to install, but it's roughly 8 GB. I would recommend 10 GB as a minimum, plus another 2-4 GB if you want a swap drive.\nCreate space for a partition\nIt's best in your case to create the new partition before doing the install. You will need to shrink the existing partition on your external hard drive first.\nI would recommend backing up the USB HD; but if you had a second one, you could just install to that one. Depending on how full the drive is, you may not be able to back it completely; but try at least back up any important files. This is just a general warning and precaution since your data should be safe.\nYou have two options to shrink the existing partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Windows partition manager in administrative tools. I believe these are available in Home Premium. If the partition won't shrink by enough, you may need to delete files to make room. If you have more than enough available but it still doesn't shrink enough, use a free defrag tool like MyDefrag to defrag and move the files to the start of the partition.\n\n*Use gparted from the Ubuntu live install media. This is probably the easier way to do it.\nCreate a new partition\nCreate the Ubuntu live installation media and use it to boot your computer. Choose Try Ubuntu.\nPlug in the external hard drive. Start the program gparted. If you have not already shrunk the partition on the external HD, do it now.\nIn most cases, the internal HD will show up as sda and the external as sdb, but this is not guaranteed. Be sure you are looking at the correct HD in gparted.\nShrinking the partition will leave unallocated space. Use this to create a new partition. Format it to ext4. Jot down the partition number. This will be used for /.\nYou don't need a swap partition, but if want one, shrink the new partition by the size you want (or just make it a little smaller in the first place). Format that space to linux-swap.\nNote down the numbers of the new partitions.\nRun the Installer\nStart the installer from the icon on the desktop or on the launcher. When asked how you want to install, choose: Somethine Else.\nThis will start the partitioner within the installer. This is different than gparted and may look a little intimidating to a beginner.\nCarefully highlight the new partition (check the number and drive carefully) and click Change. \nFollow the dialogs to a. Use the partition as ext4, b. mount to /, and c. format. \nHighlight the swap partition and click Change. Choose use a linux-swap and that's all for that one.\nVery important: change the installation of the bootloader to the USB HD. This will most likely be /dev/sdb. This will prevent you from overwriting the master boot record on your hard drive. (If you do this by accident, it's easily fixed).\nDouble-check your partition choices, then click Install Now.\n\nThat's it. To run Ubuntu, boot the computer with the USB plugged in. Set your bios order or otherwise move USB HD to the first boot position. The boot menu on the usb will show you both Ubuntu (on the external drive) and Windows (on the internal drive). Choose the one you want. If you boot without the usb, you will boot into Windows normally.\nUbuntu has Python 2.7 installed by default. To install the C comiler, open the terminal, any run:\nsudo apt-get install gcc\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\n(if you want some additional programs helpful for C programming).\n\nTo run Ubuntu in a virtual machine instead, install VirtualBox or VMWarePlayer in Windows. Both are free. Create a new VM and use the installer media to install to the VM. But this time, don't worry about partitions. Choose Install Ubuntu to the entire virtual drive. This doesn't affect the rest of the hard drive.\nIf you want to put the VM on the external hd, be sure to override the default location when creating the VM and put it on a folder on the external drive.\nCreating your installation media with persistence through a Windows program like LiveUSBCreator will also work, but this option will be very slow.\n\nA: I don't think this is fully supported via Wubi, but it can be done. I'm not entirely sure of how you plan to use it.\nIn the past, I've unplugged my Windows device, plugged in my external device, and just run through the install using the external (and in many cases, the only) drive. Ubuntu will install correctly and treat that drive as \"a drive\" - nothing special being external.\nThen, rather than dealing with dual-boot and GRUB, I can just use the BIOS/uEFI options to select my preferred boot device after I reconnect my Windows drive.\nThere are other ways of doing it, but I've found this to be the easiest, with the absolute minimal risk to my Windows systems.\n\nA: Ubuntu can, and does, run well entirely from an external hard drive. I have used Ubuntu this way for years. It doesn't affect Windows. There's nothing special about installing to USB drives. You connect the USB drive, boot using a CD or an pen drive, and choose the external disk when it comes to selecting the installation location.\nHowever:\nYou will have partition the external hard disk. I assume your external disk has a single partition with an NTFS filesystem. The best thing to do is shrink this partition by about 20 GB (which is more than enough for Ubuntu) and create new partitions there. This is not as difficult as it sounds (and you'd have to worry about partitions if you wanted to install another copy of Windows too). \nEither use Windows' Disk Management tool to shrink the partition, or use GParted from the Ubuntu Live mode. Using the former is quicker, but limits you to whatever space is available after the last used sector in the partition (which can be very low, even if you have plenty of free space). Using the second can be very slow, especially if the partition is large, but lets you extract most of the free space. \nIn either case, after you get the free space, use GParted to create an extended partition there and within that extended partition, an ext4 partition. Install Ubuntu to this partition. Choose your external hard disk as the device for GRUB (bootloader) installation as well.\nAlternative:\nIf you have a pendrive handy, use UNetBootin or Universal USB Installer or some such tool to create a bootable Ubuntu drive with persistence. If persistence is enabled, your settings and other changes to Ubuntu that you make when in Live mode don't vanish when you restart. It's ideal for low usage scenarios. You can install Python or anything else and get comfortable with Ubuntu, and then, whenever you feel ready, install Ubuntu. Note that changes made in the live mode do not affect any installation you make with it.\n\nA: Install Ubuntu from a Pre-built Image File.\nThis method creates a USB that boots on both BIOS and UEFI computers.\nIf working in Windows:\n\n*\n\n*Download Image File: dd_unb_ubuntu-20.04_15GB_2020-06-26.img.xz from mkusb Index of /isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios at\nhttps://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios/?C=M;O=D Download Link: https://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios/dd_unb_ubuntu-20.04_15GB_2020-06-26.img.xz Link to MD5SUM's: https://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios/md5sum.txt.asc\n\n\n*Download Rufus*: https://rufus.ie/\n\n\n*Etcher may also be used to flash the image: https://www.balena.io/etcher/\n\n\n*Double click Rufus .exe file.\n\n\n*Select USB drive as Target drive in Rufus.\n\n\n*Select above Image File in Rufus.\n\n\n*Click Rufus start button.\n\n\n*Wait for flashing to complete...

(See Note 2 at bottom)\n\n*Plug the computer back in.\n\n*Insert and boot the Live USB or Live DVD. (Booting BIOS mode preferred).\n\n*Select Language and Try Ubuntu.\n\n*Insert the target flash drive.\n\n*Start GParted.\n\n*Unmount any mounted partitions.\n\n*Select Device tab and create a GPT partition table on the Target drive.\n\n*Create a 3GB NTFS or FAT32 partition on the right side, (optional Linux / Windows data partition, See Note 3 at bottom).\n\n*Create a 1MB partition on the left side, format as unformatted.\n\n*Create a 300MB FAT32 partition next to the 1MB partition.\n\n*Create a 7GB ext partition next to the 300MB partition.\n\n*In the remaining space create an ext4 partition, (optional for /home partition).\n\n*Apply All Operations.\n\n*Flag the 1MB partition as bios_grub.\n\n*Flag the 300MB partition as boot,esp.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Install Ubuntu.\n\n*Select Language, click \"Continue\".\n\n*Select Keyboard layout, click \"Continue\".\n\n*Select Wireless network, click \"Continue\". (optional).\n\n*Select installation preference and select \"Download updates while installing Ubuntu\", (optional), and Select \"Install third-party software ...\", click \"Continue\". (Optional).\n\n*If asked about mounted partitions, select Yes, click \"Continue\".\n\n*Do not use Advanced feature disk encryption for this install method. (See Note 3 at bottom).\n\n*At \"Installation type\" select \"Something else\", click \"Continue\".\n\n*Under Device for boot loader installation select the target drive.\n\n*Select partition sdx4 and click change, select use as Ext4, select format this partition, and Mount point = \"/\" then OK.\n\n*If asked to Write previous changes... click Continue.\n\n*Select partition sdx5 and click change, select use as Ext4, select format this partition, and Mount point = \"/home\" then OK. (optional).\n\n*Click Install now.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Confirm partitions to be formatted if asked, click continue.\n\n\n*Select your location. click \"Continue\".\n\n\n*Insert your name, computer name, username, password and select if you want to log in automatically or require a password. - Click \"Continue\".\n\n\n*Wait until install is complete.\n\n\n*Do not reboot or unplug the target USB.\n\n\n*Copy the boot and the EFI folders from the Ubuntu ISO file to the boot,esp partition sdx3.\n\n\n*If there any problems with permissions, etc, open Nautilus using sudo -H nautilus and try copying again.\n\n\n*Copy grub.cfg from partition sdx4 /boot/grub/ to partition sdx3 /boot/grub/ overwriting the grub.cfg file.\n\n\n*Re-Install GRUB:\nsudo mount /dev/sdx3 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdx\n\n\n*Turn off computer and plug in the HDD.\n\n\n*Replace the computer's cover.\nNote 1, Booting ISO Files.\n\n*\n\n*If you want the USB to have the ability to boot ISO files using GRUB, create the boot drive using mkusb with the usb-pack-efi option. (this replaces GRUB 2.04 with 2.02).\n\n*Alternatively you can put rmmod tpm anywhere above the first menuentry in grub.cfg.\n\nNote 2: Hard drive removal.\n\n*\n\n*You may omit disabling the hard drive in BIOS boot if after partitioning you choose to install grub to the root of the USB drive you are installing Ubuntu to, (ie sdx not sdx1). Be cautious, many people have overwritten the HDD MBR as default location for boot loader is sda, any items in the internal drive's grub will be added to the USB's grub. You may do an update-grub later. If you leave the HDD plugged in with UEFI install, fstab may use the HDD's UUID for /boot/efi. In this case # or delete the /boot/efi.UUID line in fstab.\n\nNote 3: Apple compatibility.\n\n*\n\n*If you own an Apple computer make this partition FAT32.\n\nNote 4: Encryption (optional).\n\n*\n\n*For method of creating Full Encryption BIOS/UEFI USB drive see: How to Make BIOS/UEFI Flash Drive with Full Disk Encryption\n", "Q: How to move Unity launcher icons to desktop? everyone.\nOK, I have what may be a very simple question--how do I take an icon from the Unity Launcher that I had locked there, and move them onto the desktop?

And of course, I generate new ones.\nMy doubt/question is:\nIt's ./clean-all safe enough to avoid unauthorized acess to my VPN? Assuming that any of the access keys had been stolen.\n\nA: ./clean-all nukes your $KEY_DIR (an env variable usually set via the ./vars script). The contents of the script are below. This should mean that the foundational keys that make your CA are toast and you should be forced to run build-ca in order to create new certs.

What does .gu stand for?\nFor example:\nConditionalLayout {\n    name: \"row\"\n    when: layouts.width > units.gu(50) //right here\n    Row {\n        anchors.fill: parent etc....\n\n\nA: gu is short for grid unit.\nFrom the user interface manual:\n\nMeasurement Units\nA new measurement unit is defined called the grid unit, abbreviated gu. 1 grid unit translates to a given number of pixels depending on the type of screen that the user interface is displayed on. For example, on a laptop computer 1 grid unit will typically translate to 8 pixels. The number of pixels per grid unit is chosen in order to preserve the perceived visual size of UI elements and therefore depends on the density of the display and the distance the user is to the screen. We also ensure that 1 grid unit is always an integer number of pixel.\nExamples\n\n\n*\n\n*Most laptops  1 gu = 8 px\n\n*Retina laptops    1 gu = 16 px\n\n*Phone with 4 inch screen at HD resolution (around 720x1,280 pixels)   1 gu = 18 px\n\n*Tablet with 10 inch screen at HD resolution (around 720x1,280 pixels) 1 gu = 10 px\n\n\nSo if you base all your measurements on GUs every device will look as intended.\n\n\nExample\nIf the destination size of the bitmap is 10 gu * 10 gu and the developer targets a device that has 18 pixels per grid unit (1 gu = 18 px), the bitmap should still be created as if 1 gu = 30 px which results in a 300 px * 300 px bitmap. When testing on the device the bitmap will be downscaled by a factor of 30 / 18 = 1.66667.\n\n\nExtra: for measurements smaller than 1 pixel you use \"units.dp\" in the same fashion.\n", "Q: Booting from flash drive Hello I'm rather new to Ubuntu and I was wondering if someone could point me to a tutorial of how to boot from a flash drive and tell me if I need to partition my hard drive in anyway in order to boot from a flash drive.

Something like apt-get https://url.to.package.deb? Or perhaps some command line options that would add the PPA, update, and install the package all at once? Seems like I've seen other package managers that do this. I just find it a hassle to type the commands to add a whole repository just so I can install only one of its packages.\n\nA: If you already know the .deb file link, then download that deb file by,\nwget https://url.to.package.deb\n\nIf you want to download a package then run,\napt-get download <package-name>\n\nIt will download all the .deb files related to the package.Finally install all the .deb files by running,\nsudo dpkg -i filename.deb\n\n\nA: Just remember that a PPA, or any other apt repository, is not just about installing packages. It's also about automatically updating them. And the hassle of manually checking for updates, download and upgrade packages yourself is far worse than just adding a repository.\nCompare the 2 workflows:\nAdding a repository and installing from it:\n\n*\n\n*Add the PPA repository. What you call \"hassle\" is for now is a single command: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:user/repo\n\n*Install the package: sudo apt install package\nDoing all yourself:\n\n*\n\n*Visit the software website and find the correct version for your platform (32 or 64 bits? PC, Mac or Raspberry? Ubuntu 18.04 or 22.04?)\n\n*Download the .deb: wget https://xxx.com/yyy.deb\n\n*Install the package: sudo dpkg -i yyy.deb\n\n*Some time later (2 months? 1 week?), visit the software website again to see if there are any updates\n\n*If so, do most of above steps again\n\nRepositories save you from all this trouble.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, Not really. By using something like\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:<goalppa/ppa>\n\nyou are telling your system that you want the (file/program/code) you download from this ppa to be supported from this location and get updates from there.\nIts a security question for sure, allowing new ppa's that is.\nBut the security concerns for just getting the (file/program/code) may be greater in the long run if it develops a security problem down the line.\nAlso easier to get super delicious updates (Mmmmmm updates).\n", "Q: Left Alt key should work as right Alt key (Alt Gr) I'm using a German Apple keyboard on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine.

You might solve your problem by looking closely in your system settings, under Hardware > Keyboard (not Personal > Keyboard Layout). Under the shortcuts tab, check and see if Right Alt is used as a shortcut to anything. Here's an example of what that menu looks like on my system, where I've mapped it as the Compose Key.\n\n\nA: I used the process described in this answer, but instead of \"Alt/Win key behavior\", I found \"Keys Level 3\" and checked \"Every key alt\"\n\n(My Linux is in French, sorry for my poor translation)\n\nA: I know this question is old, but I found the answer fot it!\nYou simply have to open gnome tweaks -> Keyboard & Mouse -> Additional Layout Options -> Key to choose the 3rd level -> Right Alt never chooses 3rd level and your right alt works the same way left alt does.\nIf you really want a 3rd grade button you still can choose any other option like right win or menu button for example.\nI personally like to use the menu button as my alt grade and it makes much more sense since I don't use this button.\n", "Q: Unsupported Locale setting Whenever I log in to my Ubuntu 12.10 server via SSH, I see:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/command-not-found/+filebug\nPlease include the following information with the report:\n\ncommand-not-found version: 0.3\nPython version: 3.2.3 final 0\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.10\nRelease:        12.10\nCodename:       quantal\nException information:\n\nunsupported locale setting\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/CommandNotFound/util.py\", line 24, in crash_guard\n    callback()\n  File \"/usr/lib/command-not-found\", line 69, in main\n    enable_i18n()\n  File \"/usr/lib/command-not-found\", line 40, in enable_i18n\n    locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '')\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.2/locale.py\", line 541, in setlocale\n    return _setlocale(category, locale)\nlocale.Error: unsupported locale setting\nSorry, command-not-found has crashed!

For example, if current layout was En when I launched the program, then only English letters will be typed in it, even if I switch to Russian language. If I press Alt+Shift, the tray icon does change from En to Ru, and it applies to most programs but not to some Qt programs. To change layout, I have to relaunch program or to use copy-paste from an input field in another program!\nNot all Qt programs have this problem — for example, KDevelop doesn't.\nUpgrading Ubuntu from 13.10 to 14.04 beta didn't solve this problem (while it fixed another bug, influencing shortcuts in Russian layout in LibreOffice).\nWhat can cause this strange behavior?\n\nA: It looks like it's a bug in Qt's event handling system for changing keynoard layout: bugzilla link.\n\nGatis Paeglis added a comment - 03/Dec/13 1:47 PM\n  This is not a bug in Qt as suggested by a developer in https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2013-September/msg00046.html\n  The same resource suggests that the cause of the issue is that Qt doesn't listen for XkbNewKeyboardNotify events - this is wrong. XkbNewKeyboardNotify has nothing to do with keyboard layout changes. XkbNewKeyboardNotify event is fired when the actual hardware gets connected or disconnected, not when the keyboard layout changes.\n  The actual issue is in Xlib as suggested in https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23202 and in https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-30911.\n  We can hope that one day xcb platform plugin won't need dependencies to Xlib anymore, which will allows us to use xcb event loop directly. This should also solve the \"keyboard layout detection\" issue.\n  Here is the discussion about Xlib dependency in xcb plugin http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2013-July/011965.html\n\nAs it's said, it affects only GTK based desktop enviroments, so you may want to swich to KDE.

Short answer is to put U6aMy0wojraho for the hash of the blank password in /etc/passwd, like TheUsersName:U6aMy0wojraho:...\n\nA: Create an user with empty password\nsudo useradd test-user-0\necho test-user-0:U6aMy0wojraho | sudo chpasswd -e\nsu test-user-0\n\nThe password prompt still shows unfortunately.\nBut if you just hit enter without typing anything, and it logins as the user test-user-0.\nThe -e flags tells chpasswd that the password is already encrypted, and U6aMy0wojraho is the hash of the empty string.\nTested on Ubuntu 18.04.\nBusyBox autologin\nOn the terminal at least, you don't need to create an user without a password to allow someone to not type their passwords everytime, hacking inittab a bit is enough: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/299408/how-to-login-automatically-without-typing-the-root-username-or-password-in-build\n", "Q: Upload file using OpenStack Cinder Can we upload file using OpenStack Cinder?\nI have installed OpenStack via DevStack and has no Swift enabled.\n\nA: OpenStack cinder (Block Storage) provides the software to create and centrally manage a service that provisions storage in the form of block devices known as Cinder volumes on virtual machines active on cloud. if you are working on any one of the VM and if you store any file on that VM, that file will be stored as cinder volume. I think that's what you mean by upload. \n", "Q: How to let built-in DHCP assign a static IP to LXC container based on name, not MAC address I know, that I can assign static IP manually, using /etc/network/interfaces. \nI also know, that I can read the MAC address of the LXC container (e.g. by looking for lxc.network.hwaddr entry in /var/lib/lxc/<container-name>/config and assign the IP based using entries dhcp-host=<mac-addr>,10.0.3.3 in /etc/dnsmasq.d/<some file>.\nIn the file /etc/default/lxc-net I read \n# Uncomment the next line if you'd like to use a conf-file for the lxcbr0\n# dnsmasq.  For instance, you can use 'dhcp-host=mail1,10.0.3.100' to have\n# container 'mail1' always get ip address 10.0.3.100.\n#LXC_DHCP_CONFILE=/etc/lxc/dnsmasq.conf\n\nThat would suit my needs; unfortunately doing so has no effect.\n\nA: It works fine in Ubuntu 14.04.1\nUncomment this line /etc/default/lxc-net\n#LXC_DHCP_CONFILE=/etc/lxc/dnsmasq.conf\n\nstop all containers, restart lxc-net:\nservice lxc-net restart\n\nConfigure ip addresses in /etc/lxc/dnsmasq.conf\ndhcp-host={NAME},10.0.3.2\n\nwhere {NAME} is the name of your LXC container:\n/var/lib/lxc/{NAME}\n\n\nA: I ran into this recently and I think I found an easy solution. I (only) tested it on Ubuntu 14.04.\nFirst, uncomment this line /etc/default/lxc-net:\nLXC_DHCP_CONFILE=/etc/lxc/dnsmasq.conf\n\nIn /etc/lxc/dnsmasq.conf, define a dhcp-hostsfile:\ndhcp-hostsfile=/etc/lxc/dnsmasq-hosts.conf\n\nThen add entries in /etc/lxc/dnsmasq-hosts.conf like this:\nmail,10.0.3.16\nweb,10.0.3.17\n\nBeware: changes will become effective after you have restarted lxc-net (which restarts dnsmasq):\nservice lxc-net restart\n\nAfterwards you can modify /etc/lxc/dnsmasq-hosts.conf and send the SIGHUP signal to dnsmasq:\nkillall -s SIGHUP dnsmasq\n\nSo yes, you need to restart lxc-net, but only once. Hope this helps.\n\nA: The Tombart's answer works if you are patient enough to wait for the DNS refresh AND you are willing to restart the container (the guest) afterwards. \nWhat follows is the recipe that requires that all other possibly running lxc containers are shut down. If you cannot afford that, then I see no way of forcing new dnsmasq configuration. (For some reasone signaling HUP to dnsmasq's pid found in /run/lxc/dnsmasq.pid doesn't work either.)\nSo if you want to have something that works instantly and there is no other lxc containers running, follow my answer. $name is the name of the node for which we want to reset the assignment, and $internalif is the name of the LXC's bridged adapter. You can get the value of the $internalif with e.g. augtool -L -A --transform \"Shellvars incl /etc/default/lxc-net\" get \"/files/etc/default/lxc-net/LXC_BRIDGE\" | sed -En 's/\\/.* = (.*)/\\1/p' if you install augeas-tools but usually it is just lxcbr0. \nsudo lxc-stop -n $name >/dev/null\nsudo service lxc-net stop >/dev/null\nif [ -d /sys/class/net/$internalif ]; then\n   sudo brctl delbr $internalif >/dev/null #Why? See below.\nfi\nsudo rm /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.$internalif.leases\nsudo service lxc-net start >/dev/null\nsudo lxc-start -d -n $name >/dev/null\nsleep 5\n\nUnfortunately, there is a bug (feature?) in the /etc/init/lxc-net.conf in Ubuntu 14.04 that prevents reloading the dnsmasq unless the bridge device is down for the host. \n\nA: This solution works by patching the lxc upstart scripts. It does split the complex task of bringing the lxcbr0 bridge up and starting a dnsmasq into two separate jobs. Now you don't need to restart the whole lxc-net bridge to just reload the dnsmasq - reloading the sudo service restart lxc-dnsmasq is sufficient and does not require shutting down the bridge.\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop the lxc-net service sudo service lxc-net stop and make sure there is no lxcbr0 (or equivalent) bridge up.\n\n*Replace the contents of the /etc/init/lxc-net.conf with the following contents:\n\n\n.\ndescription \"lxc network\"\nauthor \"Serge Hallyn <serge.hallyn@canonical.com>\"\n\nstart on starting lxc\nstop on stopped lxc\n\nenv USE_LXC_BRIDGE=\"true\"\nenv LXC_BRIDGE=\"lxcbr0\"\nenv LXC_ADDR=\"10.0.3.1\"\nenv LXC_NETMASK=\"255.255.255.0\"\nenv LXC_NETWORK=\"10.0.3.0/24\"\nenv varrun=\"/run/lxc\"\nenv LXC_DOMAIN=\"\"\n\npre-start script\n    [ -f /etc/default/lxc ] && . /etc/default/lxc\n\n    [ \"x$USE_LXC_BRIDGE\" = \"xtrue\" ] || { stop; exit 0; }\n\n    use_iptables_lock=\"-w\"\n    iptables -w -L -n > /dev/null 2>&1 || use_iptables_lock=\"\"\n    cleanup() {\n        # dnsmasq failed to start, clean up the bridge\n        iptables $use_iptables_lock -D INPUT -i ${LXC_BRIDGE} -p udp --dport 67 -j ACCEPT\n        iptables $use_iptables_lock -D INPUT -i ${LXC_BRIDGE} -p tcp --dport 67 -j ACCEPT\n        iptables $use_iptables_lock -D INPUT -i ${LXC_BRIDGE} -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n        iptables $use_iptables_lock -D INPUT -i ${LXC_BRIDGE} -p tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n        iptables $use_iptables_lock -D FORWARD -i ${LXC_BRIDGE} -j ACCEPT\n        iptables $use_iptables_lock -D FORWARD -o ${LXC_BRIDGE} -j ACCEPT\n        iptables $use_iptables_lock -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s ${LXC_NETWORK} !

I tried to installed dual OS in different partitions only. Then why the Ubuntu is not loading. \nCan anyone have solution to get the Ubuntu.\n\nA: Windows is greedy and rewrites the master boot record to only point to itself, making it so that it bypasses GRUB and Ubuntu.  Typically, Ubuntu should be installed after Windows, but it's okay.  \nBurn this .iso to a disk and load and run it after Windows is installed. It'll restore the boot log and you'll see GRUB again and everything should be happy.\nIf you want in on a USB, since it seems Windows is working for you, use this tool to take the .iso you've downloaded and stick it on a usb. Here's some offical documentation which conveniently recommends the same thing. \n\nA: You need to install GRUB on the same partition as Windows:\n1) Boot with Ubuntu Live CD (or USB)\n2) Open terminal (command prompt)\n3) Type:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou will get a list of partitions, similar to the following list:\n/dev/sda1 13 102400 de Dell Utility\n/dev/sda2 * 13 1926 15360000 7 HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda3 1926 30892 232676566 7 HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda4 30893 60802 240245761 5 Extended\n/dev/sda5 30893 59584 230467584 83 Linux\n/dev/sda6 59585 60802 9777152 82 Linux swap / Solaris \n\nUbuntu partition is the one with the name \"Linux\" (not necessarily the one with the star, although could be).

The problem, though, is that whenever I start it up from the command line, the sound is muted. I am using version 12.04 on a Dell Dimension 3000.\n\nA: startx is not the preferred way to start a session in Ubuntu.\nUse sudo start lightdm instead and that should start your session the right way (and in doing so, hopefully kick pulseaudio into gear at the same time).\nI'm sure there's an xinit way of doing this too, but honestly, just going with the standard lightdm route is probably the sanest.\n", "Q: Why do I've two entries per server in known_hosts file?

Does ubuntu add it automatically if available?\n\nA: You have two entries because one is by domain and the other by IP address, so your example:\n|1|wwwwwwwwwwwwwww=|wwwwwwwwww= ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAAAAAAA+AAAAA=\n|1|vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv=|vvvvvvvvvv= ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAAAAAAA+AAAAA=\n\nmight in effect read:\n[example.com] ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAAAAAAA+AAAAA=\n[192.168.6.8] ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAAAAAAA+AAAAA=\n\nIf you disable known host hashing (add HashKnownHosts no to your ~/.ssh/config file) then you can see what is happening, but on a non-hashed known_host file, both the domain and IP address can appear on the same line, so they'd look like this:\n[example.com],[192.168.6.8] ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAAAAAAA+AAAAA=\n\nThere's a bit more of a discussion of the known_hosts file format here.\n\nA: You should have one key for each server you have connected to.

I am not running any Apache or any thing that triggers ssl libray, so is there a service in Ubuntu that runs Open ssl by default?\nSo, I am just booting live session for internet browser. Am I safe? \n\nA: Short answer: No, you're not.\nThe heartbleed bug has been exhaustively analyzed elsewhere but the point is that it affects servers. You don't care about it with respect to your computer unless you run a server on it. This does not mean that you're safe however. \nThe danger is that your bank is affected by it, you should certainly change your passwords etc. The fact that you use a Live CD for banking purposes is completely irrelevant, the bug is server side, so you are as affected by it as anyone else. \n\nA: I'll have to contradict both the other answers.  If you are booting a livecd for Internet browsing and only browsing, your computer is safe from being attacked.  The Heartbleed bug can be used to attack clients who connect to a hostile server just like hostile clients can use it to attack a server.  However, the only client you're using is (presumably) Firefox, which uses NSS instead of OpenSSL and is thus immune.\nHowever, you are not safe.  If any servers you visit is vulnerable, any information you send to that server can be read by an attacker.\n\nA: Before using the internet to do banking just run:    \nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install libcurl3 openssl python-openssl ssl-cert firefox firefox-globalmenu\n\nIf you are really strapped for memory, this can be done first thing after the live system boots to maximize efficiency. Firefox should probably be updated anyway if you are banking and what-not to catch up with all the other security updates.\nI found these applications by running\ndpkg -l | grep OpenSSL\n\non a 12.04.4 Ubuntu live cd. There may be more using SSL that I've missed here, I did not search any further.\n\nA: No, if you are running any version of OpenSSL from 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f. Ubuntu 12.04.4 ships with OpenSSL 1.0.1, so yes, you are subject to the bug, NO you are not safe. \nIf you can update to OpenSSL 1.0.1g you are safe, but as of right now, 12.04.4 ships with a susceptible version, 1.0.1.\nThere is a list, and a better explanation on the official Heartbleed site. Go check it out. Also, there is a question, How to patch the Heartbleed bug (CVE-2014-0160) in OpenSSL?, on the site.

Any solutions to this problem? I dont want to edit anything yet on my own at this point before I damage my boot file. Thanks! \n\nA: Most computers let you disable Secure Boot without enabling BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode booting. Look for an option to enable you to do this. With Secure Boot off, you should be able to install Ubuntu in EFI mode; or you can use rEFInd, on a CD-R or USB flash drive, to boot Ubuntu in EFI mode.

It is possible to redo a format to some extent (with \"testdisk\"). But doing so would probably be far more costly then letting it slip since they need to get there hands on your system (and that probably requires a court order in most countries). \nMind you: if you bought the system from a store that is a chance you already paid for windows (prior to windows 8 you would have a sticker on the system with the serial; windows 8 seems to store the serial in bios(?)). \n\nWhat is the best HDD formatting method/software so Microsoft will not trace license from HDD. ?\n\nBest method? Throw away the harddisc and get a brand new one.\nTechnically you can use tools to zero-fill your disc several times to make sure all was erased (since formatting most times does not erase the disc but removes just the partition table (short version ;) )) but a new harddisc is the least time consuming method.\n", "Q: Recover accidently deleted eclipse ini File I accidentaly switched my Eclipse ini file with an android Eclipse ini file.

Are there any drawbacks to installing Ubuntu 13.10 (and soon 14.04) in Legacy BIOS instead of UEFI?  I have installed 13.10 64bit in Legacy by mistake and was just wondering if it would hurt anything to simply leave it there as is?\nEDIT\nEverything seems to be running just fine in Legacy and all my drivers work.\n\nA: In theory, UEFI boots faster, but we're talking fractions of a second in an already quick process. \nPractically, if you're only running Ubuntu then there shouldn't be major differences. The userland supports stuff like large partitions in either mode.\nThings can get troublesome in a dual-boot situation, especially with Windows since different versions have different expectations with regard to how they handle boot up.\n\nA: The main points are:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI-mode booting can be faster. The difference can be several seconds, contrary to what K. Darien Freeheart wrote, but the difference also varies from one computer to another; on some computers, the speed benefit can be non-existent. The effect is felt mainly in the firmware initialization, not in the Linux boot process itself.\n\n*An EFI-mode boot gives the OS access to certain EFI features. Today, the biggest of these is the ability to control the firmware's built-in boot manager, via the Linux efibootmgr utility. The kernel can also log crash data in NVRAM, but that's mainly of interest to developers. In the future, the number of things that can be done with an EFI-mode boot from a booted Linux distribution may increase.\n\n*The much-maligned Secure Boot can actually provide some security benefits, if you choose to configure it properly. You might never need or notice these benefits, but if, at some point in the future, some pre-boot malware spreads and can infect Linux-based computers, you might be glad to have Secure Boot active.\n\n*EFI provides new and different boot manager and boot loader options. In addition to GRUB, which is available for both BIOS and EFI, you can use rEFInd or gummiboot to choose the OS, and ELILO or the EFI stub loader to boot the kernel. See my page on EFI boot loaders for Linux for more on this topic.\n\n*On some computers, booting from a GPT disk in BIOS mode requires jumping through some extra hoops. Thus, booting in EFI mode may save you a bit of effort if you've got an over-2TiB disk or if you just plain like GPT.\n\n\nOverall, these benefits are unlikely to be compelling for most people. Fortunately, switching boot modes is pretty easy. You can try it on a single-boot basis with most computers by preparing a CD-R or USB flash drive with my rEFInd boot manager. Boot to it and it should detect your Linux kernel(s) and let you boot it/them. (If you use a separate /boot partition, though, you'll need to add a root={whatever} kernel option by hitting F2 or Insert twice once you highlight the kernel.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu heat up too much my computer when it uses the integrated intel graphics My machine is a Lenovo G580 with these specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: intel core i7 3520M\n\n*Graphics: intel core HD graphics 4000 + nvidia\nGeforce 710M \n\n*RAM: 6GB\n\n\nI'm on ubuntu 13.04 64 bits and I've set up bumblebee.\nThe computer gets too heat (more than 70ºc) when I leave the cpufreq in \"ondemand\" mode and it shouldn't since I'm not doing too intensity-CPU stuff.\nI think that it's due to excessive use of intel hd graphics for rendering the screen, because if i put the frequency to 2.9GHz, the temperature is still ok; but I leave the cpufreq to switch the cpu freq, it warms up.\nA workaround could use the nvidia graphics card for unity and firefox (things I've always opened), something I don't know how to do it.\nAlso, i would like to know if, eventually, the optimus nvidia technology (to change automatically from integrated to dedicated GPUs depending on the current graphics/video use.) it's going to be supported in Linux, either proprietary or open source way.\n\nA: I'm sure the discrete graphics-card, the nvidia Geforce 710M, must be responsible for your heating problem. By using bumblebee you may have triggered it.\nI recommend using the nvidia-prime driver (activate in \"system settings -> software & updates -> additional drivers -> nvidia-331\") and to choose manually between integrated and discrete graphics, which is possible within \"nvidia-settings->PRIME Profiles\". By turning the nvidia card off your laptop will stay much cooler.\n", "Q: Official images for Wandboard Quad I would like to ask if there will be official images of Ubuntu 14.04 for Wandboard Quad.\nSimply because I saw this reference on http://ports.ubuntu.com/.\nThanks\n\nA: it seems that official images of Ubuntu 14.04 are not available yet.

Today I discovered that GParted shows the whole drive (/dev/sdb) as being unallocated. The drive works fine though. Clicking for more information in GParted gives me the following warning text:\n\nThe backup GPT table is not at the end of the disk, as it should be. This might mean that another operating system believes the disk is smaller. Fix, by moving the backup to the end (and removing the old backup)?\nNot all of the space available to /dev/sdb appears to be used, you can fix the GPT to use all of the space (an extra 4294967296 blocks) or continue with the current setting?\nUnable to satisfy all constraints on the partition.\n\nOn the drive sits one single ext4 partition, filling up presumably the whole drive. I was the one formatting it a long time ago, using GParted, if I remember correctly. I can't remember details of creating a GPT table. The drive is used only for data and does not contain system files or anything. I do mount it automatically with fstab.\nIn GParted I only have the option of clicking Close. See attached screenshots. I'm not happy to have GParted telling me the drive is unallocated space. What can/should I do to fix this?\nThe problem I have with experimenting is that I have no other drive that can accommodate my 3TB worth of data, so making backups is an issue. (Before you tell me that I should always backup data, most of the contents on this 3TB drive is my incremental backups from other drives, so I prefer not to lose it.)\n\n\nRunning\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sdb\n\ngives\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.1\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: protective\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.\n\nWarning!

This way the added disk space appeared in cfdisk (that I have used to create the partition ;))\n\nA: It looks like something has moved the GPT's backup partition table to roughly the 700GiB mark on the disk. This could cause data corruption (although probably of only one or two files), so you should move it back where it belongs. You can do this in gdisk by using the e option on the gdisk experts' menu (that is, launch gdisk, then type x, then type e, then type w to save your changes). GParted and parted should also offer options to fix this problem, but I'm less familiar with them and don't know what, if any, caveats might apply. (I'm gdisk's author, so I'm very familiar with what it does!)\nChances are this damage was caused by some partitioning tool that was run on the disk from an OS or via a driver that has a built-in 32-bit limitation. Since the disk has more than 2^32 sectors, the result is something like a car's odometer rolling over -- instead of accessing out to the ~2.7TiB mark, the software wrote the backup partition table data at ~0.7TiB (~700GiB). This type of problem is most common with Windows drivers that are older than a year or two old and with external USB enclosures for hard disks.\n", "Q: How To assign keyboard shortcut to a new application in ubuntu 13.10 I am using ubuntu 13.10.

This behavior forms the basis of Items that are designed to show large numbers of child items, such as ListView and GridView.\nIn traditional user interfaces, views can be scrolled using standard controls, such as scroll bars and arrow buttons. In some situations, it is also possible to drag the view directly by pressing and holding a mouse button while moving the cursor. In touch-based user interfaces, this dragging action is often complemented with a flicking action, where scrolling continues after the user has stopped touching the view.\nFlickable does not automatically clip its contents. If it is not used as a full-screen item, you should consider setting the clip property to true.\nSo the sample code now looks like this:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    width: units.gu(60)\n    height: units.gu(60)\n\n    ListModel {\n        id: fruitModel\n        ListElement {\n            name: \"Apple\"\n            cost: 2.45\n        }\n        ListElement {\n            name: \"Orange\"\n            cost: 3.25\n        }\n        ListElement {\n            name: \"Banana\"\n            cost: 1.95\n        }\n    }\n\n    Page {\n        id: test\n\n        Column {\n            spacing: units.gu(1)\n            id: pageLayout\n            anchors {\n                margins: units.gu(2)\n                fill: parent\n            }\n\n            Row {\n                id: buttonRow\n                spacing: units.gu(1)\n                Button {\n                    objectName: \"button1\"\n                    color: \"white\"\n                    text: i18n.tr(\"Help\")\n                }\n                Button {\n                    objectName: \"button2\"\n                    color: \"black\"\n                    text: i18n.tr(\"Search\")\n                }\n            }\n\n            Item {\n                anchors.top: buttonRow.bottom\n                ListView {\n                    id: list\n                    clip: true\n                    width: units.gu(18)\n                    height: units.gu(3)\n                    model: fruitModel\n                    boundsBehavior: Flickable.StopAtBounds\n                    delegate: Row {\n                        Text { text: \"Fruit: \" + name }\n                        Text { text: \"Cost: $\" + cost }\n                    }\n                }\n                Scrollbar {\n                    flickableItem: list\n                    align: Qt.AlignTrailing\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n", "Q: Reboot instead of shutdown Ubuntu 12.04 As the title suggests, when I try to shutdown my computer from Ubuntu 12.04, it shuts down but then powers back on about three seconds later.

Right click on your wallpaper and choose the option change desktop background. You can change the wallpaper here and if you press the tab \"behavior\" and change the option under auto-hide launcher, the bar on the left will hide until you bring your mouse near the left side of your screen, giving you more screen real estate. You can also change the system them on the wallpaper tab by selecting radiance in the drop down menu next to where it says system theme.\n3) If you want you can installing the chrome browser, which is called \"chromium\" in Ubuntu from the software center.\n4) You can turn the firewall on by install the program \"gufw\" from the software center. The firewall is off by default because all the tech savvy people like to make their own permissions for network services and because ubuntu is already ridiculously secure. You'll just be turning it on, with this program though.\n5) You can also install a program called \"cairo dock\".

I want to allow this user to use only one or two programs, but I have lots of systemwide installed apps. \nIs there an easy way to exclude a specific user from using apps (without reinstalling everything again)?\n\nA: Below a combination of measures you can take, to restrict users locally from using defined applications. They are not meant (nor fit) for unattended usage, in public spaces for example, but do create a usable restricted desktop. It is mainly the combination of measures that makes it more difficult to bypass. Furthermore if someone manages to launch a \"forbidden\" application, it will be logged.\nThe answer is a bit extensive. The setup is not, and you are assisted by two scripts.\nWhat the setup exists of\n\n\n*\n\n*A selection of software, made unavailable from the interface by editing their local desktop file by a script (further below)\n\n*Making the terminal only available via password, so running applications from the terminal is made more difficult.\n\n*Changing the default keycombination of opening the terminal, instead of ctrlaltt\n\n*Logging the usage of a \"blacklist\" of software you define, in case some smart user might surpass your setup\n\n\nHow to setup\nSetting up a broad selection of software, unavailable from the interface.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in, to the user account you want to restrict\n\n*Make a (temporary) folder (no matter where, on the desktop for example) to edit some\nfiles.\n\n*Browse into the directory /usr/share/applications Select all (desktop files of) applications you want the user to be excluded from (don't select all of them without looking, some of them are necessary to set up your desktop)\n\n*Copy these desktop files into the temporary directory you created, for bulk-editing.\n\n*Copy the text below, paste it into an empty file, save it in the same temporary folder as no_openapp.py. \n\n*CD into the directory(!) and run it with the command: python3 no_openapp.py.\n\n\nThe script did a few things:\n1] Create a blacklist of commands (for later use, see further below) 2] Edit the desktop files to show a message instead of running the application. If you move the desktop files to ~/.local/share/applications, on next login the applications will not run from Unity or Dash.\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nimport os\nimport getpass\nimport subprocess\n\n\ndesktopfile_dir = os.getcwd()\nfile_list = os.listdir(os.getcwd())\nedit_subjects = [desktopfile_dir+\"/\"+item for item in file_list]\n\ndef create_blacklist():\n    command_list = []\n    for item in edit_subjects:\n        with open(item) as blacklist_source:\n            searchlines = blacklist_source.readlines()\n        try:\n            native_command = [\n                line for line in searchlines if line.startswith(\"Exec=\")\n                ][0].replace(\"Exec=\", \"\").replace(\"\\n\", \"\")\n            cleaned_command = native_command.split(\" \")[0]\n            command_list.append(cleaned_command)\n        except IndexError:\n            pass\n\n    with open(desktopfile_dir+\"/blacklist.txt\", \"wt\") as created_blacklist:\n        created_blacklist.write(str(command_list))\n\ndef make_unavailable():\n    for item in edit_subjects:\n        try:\n            with open(item, \"r\") as make_unav:\n                lines = make_unav.readlines()\n                line_range = range(0, len(lines))\n                for index in line_range:\n                    if lines[index].startswith(\"Exec=\"):\n                        lines[index] = 'Exec=zenity --info --text=\"You are not allowed to use this application\"\\n'\n                    else:\n                        pass\n            with open(item, \"wt\") as make_unav:\n                for line in lines:\n                    make_unav.write(line)\n        except (IsADirectoryError, IndexError, PermissionError):\n            pass\n\n\ncreate_blacklist()\nmake_unavailable()\n\nRestrict the use of the terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*make the terminal accesible with a password, like in this post. \n\n*if the user is familiar with the key combination of ctrlaltt, change the default combination: \nSystem>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts > key combinations (tab).\nIn case you have a wizzkid bypass your measures, catch him\n\n\n*\n\n*In case a user manages to get a forbidden application running, make sure you catch him. for this, we use the blacklist, created in step one.\n\n*create a folder on a hidden location.

The script checks every minute if one of the black-listed applications is running, and keeps record in a log file (in the same directory as where the script is located). The name of the log file is log.txt. Optionally, you can make the script kill the forbidden application (not the default).

However, the combination of measures, and the fact that you have to know what they are, make it a reasonable defence in case of an avarage usere with an average knowledge on how to manipulate the system.\n\nA: Thanks for your answers. I have reached this already by manipulating the permissions of the programs bin-files.\nI installed the old gnome user-administration tool, which allows to manage groups. Unchecked group games for the user, which is not allowed to open certain programs.\nThen changed group and permissions of the bin-files:\nsudo chgrp games /path/to/game \nsudo chmod 750 /path/to/game\nNow the user can see the desktop files in the Dash, but they won't run after click.\nGreetings\n\nA: This is very, very difficult. I've never seen any setup that comes close to doing that and most times, when people want this, I've been able to provide much better solutions because there wasn't really any point in restricting the user to begin with – they just didn't know what other options Ubuntu has.  \nHowever, you might be able to do this by running the entire user session in an lxc container running Xspice, that simply don't have any other applications installed. It will be quite a project, but if and when it works, it should probably be the best isolation you could get. This idea is based on a blog post by Serge Hallyn recently found on Planet Ubuntu and you'll certainly want to read it: http://s3hh.wordpress.com/2014/04/18/xspice-in-containers/\nIt's complicated, based on new technologies that aren't even released yet, I don't know anyone who's actually tried it for these kinds of purposes – but in theory, it should work. :) \nI would certainly recommend that you investigate other ways of accomplishing your true goal, which most likely isn't actually preventing the use of apps, but something else. \n", "Q: Adding Hindi Fonts to Ubuntu Font Family I wish to add more Hindi fonts to the Ubuntu Font Library, so that I can use them in LibreOffice.\nThe three font types are available on this website in TTF format on this website.\nhttp://www.abhivyakti-hindi.org/abhi/hindi_shusha_fonts_dl_help.htm\nHow do I add them?\n\nA: You can install fonts from terminal:\nsudo apt-get install fonts-indic\n\n\nA: First download fonts.\nThen open Nautilus as root using the command: gksudo nautilus\nor sudo -H nautilus\nNow copy your font file to /usr/share/fonts.\nYou can also paste it in /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu-font-family \n(Type  ctrl+L  to navigate quickly)\nNow you can easily use those fonts In LibreOffice.\n\nA: Just go to the website you mentioned and click on the one you want.\n\nOpen it and click on install\n\nand it will be installed.

So I tried lubuntu, not knowing anything about it or programming.\nIt works pretty well too, but for some reason I can't get a wireless connection. I've read other posts, and get lost in the technical jargon. I don't even know what a gui master controller utility, or whatever they said, is. \"Wireless networks\" is greyed out, as is \"device not ready (firmware missing)\" when I put my mouse over the networks icon in my tray.\nHow do I get this thing to connect without being tied to the ethernet cable I am currently using? Details and laymen's terms, please. This is a Dell latitude d600. Beyond that, I couldn't give any more detail about the hardware.\n\nA: The driver for the Dell Latitude D600 could be one of this 2:\nBCM4306 - pci:id 14e4:4324\nBCM4309 - pci:id 14e4:4324 (rev 02)\nAs seen in Installing Broadcom Wireless Drivers it shows that 14e4:4324 can work with the linux-firmware-nonfree package. Just follow the guide in that question to solve it. I won't mark this as duplicate of that one because you have a 50% chance of having the other version, the 14e4:4324 (rev 02) so I will wait to see how it goes with the recommendation and if you can run lspci -nn -d 14e4: on the terminal to see which version you actually have and to which package you actually need to install.\nIn the case it is the rev 02 before accepting this answer, please respond so we can added to the long list of Broadcom drivers in a comment.\n", "Q: Use aliases in the Alt-F2 dialog In the .bashrc file, one can add an alias for a command, say\nalias geditm = 'gedit --display=D1'\n\nNow I can run geditm in a terminal and have gedit open in display D1.  I am curious if there is a way to define an alias for running commands from the Alt-F2 menu, so that I could Alt+F2, type geditm and have the same result. \nI am interested in doing this generally, not just for gedit.\n\nA: Not really, no. I am not sure about the details but I imagine that the Alt+F2 is simply passing the commands you run to a non-interactive, non-login shell. This type of shell will not have access to aliases, as explained in man bash:\n   When bash is started non-interactively, to  run  a  shell  script,  for\n   example, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands\n   its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the  name\n   of  a  file to read and execute.  Bash behaves as if the following com‐\n   mand were executed:\n          if [ -n \"$BASH_ENV\" ]; then . \"$BASH_ENV\"; fi\n   but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for  the  file\n   name.\n\nSo, you might think that you can just set BASH_ENV to point to a file containing alias definitions. Unfortunately, aliases are not available to non-interactive shells. Again from man bash:\n   Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless  the\n   expand_aliases  shell option is set using shopt (see the description of\n   shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n\nYou might think that you could add shopt -s expand_aliases to the file defined by $BASH_ENV but that won't work because that file will be read but in a different shell.\nI know this is confusing. Bottom line, you can't make aliases available to the Alt+F2 dialog.\n\nA workaround\nSo, since you can't do this with aliases, what you can do is do it with scripts:\nsudo -H gedit /usr/bin/geditm\n\nThat will bring up a new gedit window, add these lines to it and save the file:\n#!/bin/bash\ngedit --display=D1\n\nMake the script executable:\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/geditm\n\nNow, you can hit Alt+F2, write geditm and that script will be launched which in turn launches gedit with the desired options.\n\nA: Note:  after rereading your question and thinking about it longer, I think the answer by terdon is probably the one you want, not this one; this one is too general, and takes more typing.\nIf I understand correctly, it seems like you might want to append --display=D1 to any program you run from Alt-F2; is this correct?  After some discussion, probably not, so be sure to see \"EDIT2\" along with this for a different take.\nIf so, it seems like you could create a simple script that would live in some folder in your path, like ~/bin, that would simply say\n#!/bin/bash\n$1 --display=D1\n\nIf you name the script \"display\", then from Alt-F2 you could run display gedit, and it should append \"--display=D1\".\nEDIT:  I guess you will need to make it executable, using chmod +x display\nI can't really easily test that, but it should work (assuming this is what you want to do.\nEDIT2:  It seems I didn't fully understand your question, but I think you can still use a similar method.  Instead of specifying the flag, you can use substitutions for both the command and the flags.  I guess you could simply say\n$*\n\ninstead of\n$1 --display=D1\n\nThen the Alt-F2 command would be \"display  xxxx yyyy ...\"\n", "Q: login, password I managed to get ubuntu installed on the extra hard drive.

When using windows 8 OS, there are lot of ways to speed up the system performance. That is why i want to know what are the possible ways for best performance of system.\nI have dell-latitude|D610 with 1 GB Ram and 2 Ghz Processor.\nYour kind instructions are needed.\n\nA: When using windows 8 OS, there are lot of ways to speed up the system performance\n\nReally? How? All I know is that you can\n\n\n*\n\n*Refresh: something you don't need to do in Linux\n\n*Defragmentation: You very rarely need defragmentation, I've been using linux for about 7 years and never defraged a disk. \n\n*Viruses: very few run in Linux, you don't need an antivurus, you could install one if you want but you don't need it, not only viruses slow windows, but some antivirus slow windows even more, trust me, I tried every antivirus, every optimization method before giving up on windows!\n\n*Junk cleaners, such as Ccleaner: On Ubuntu you just do sudo apt-get autoremove and  sudo apt-get autoclean, those commands will clean stuff you don't need but won't speed up your system, because nothing can slow your system down in the first place.\n\n*If unity, the desktop, itself is slow,  you could switch to Xubuntu,\nif you want something faster, you can get Openbox, there are many\noptions.\n\n*If your browser is slow, you could clear cache or switch to another\nbrowser, it's something not related to Linux, in fact I find web\nbrowsing much faster on Linux then on Windows 7. Chrome will eat all\nthe ram in windows 7 and become really slow, if you install plugins\nand open few tabs\n\n\nNow, did I miss something? Is there a way to optimize Windows that I forgot to mention?\n\nA: There's not really any programs to increase performance in Linux. There's Bleachbit, that cleans cookies, cache, and other stuff, but doesn't really speed anything up. Linux is just supposed to be fast as is. So whatever speed Ubuntu is giving you now is probably the speed you're stuck with.\n\nA: First thing is , even in windows, there is no such thing as optimizing program. all they is use the utility that come packed with windows. They defragment the system, delete the temporary files, cookies, things like that. They only make a fool out of the novices. So do not pay for such softwares under windows. Use CCleaner and occassionally defragment your hard disk. That should do the trick for Windows\nAnd for the linux part, you don't need one. If you want to remove the temporary files and things like that use BleachBit. But that wont speed up your system. A LINUX system only gets slower when you HD gets filled up and that too is not noticeable.\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/115229/htg-explains-why-linux-doesnt-need-defragmenting/\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2009/10/defragmenting-linux-ext3-filesystems.html\n", "Q: GRUB not updated as required, what should I do? I'm running a daily build of Ubuntu Trusty Tahr 14.04 (64 bit). I recently updated, when it mentioned that one of the updates regards the GRUB file, which was edited manually. \nI know why it was edited manually (I had trouble detecting HDMI sound in the configuration and did as this answer suggested, which worked perfectly), so I asked to see a side-by-side comparison, intending to apply the changes manually without removing my custom solution. \nThen I clicked forward, and... the updates just kept on running. That's it. Now, I'm not sure what I should do exactly - I tried running the updater again but nothing. I have no way of knowing what were the changes, and I'm afraid of restarting the computer after the updates because I have no idea what's missing and what might happen (if anything).\n\nA: Just revert the file. There is only a line of modification which you can easily find. After the file has been updated, you can easily find it and update it.\nIn case of multiple differences you can \n\n\n*\n\n*First take a backup of your config file\n\n*Then revert the file\n\n*After the update is complete, you can compare the updated file and your backup file using a diff tool and come with the merged file.\n\n*I use meld for this purpose\n\n\nA: The way packages are supposed to work (.deb and .rpm), is that each file in nominated as either configurable or not.  If the package manager encounters a configurable file, which is not what it's expecting, it will prompt you during install to either replace the old file, with the new one, save a copy of the new file and leave the old one, or merge them.  Either way it will normally leave files which might allow you to unpick what it did, if you know where the config file is in the first place.  If the file is not set in the package as configurable, then it'll just silently wipe it.  \nSo did you check /etc/default to see if there is an old copy of the grub file?  Failing that, I suggest you run through the solution you listed and see if you can figure it out.  I'd suggest you remove 'splash' and 'quiet' from the settings until you're sure your grub is setup ok (I also use 'text' mode when debugging grub).  \n", "Q: How to connect with iPhone using Nautilus?

A small window will appear.\nYou can choose \"Type\" (drop-down menu, choose SSH and Port will automatically change to 22 which is the default SSH port).\nThen enter your username and password in the User name and Password fields and hit Connect.\nIn Server, enter your iPhone's IP address.\nTo get your iPhone IP address, I assume you are connected to your WiFi router. On your iPhone, you go to Settings, then click on WiFi and the name of the network you're connected to.\nYou should see your iPhone's IP address, which you type into Server on your computer.\n", "Q:

I see that \n/home/user folder is created.\n/etc/passwd file has an entry with non bin/false or bin/nologin shells.\n/etc/group has user group.\n/etc/shadow has the password.\n\nIs there something else going on when adduser happens?\nI would like to change ordinary user into a system user. And I'm trying to understand what is difference between this two, and what is created in each case by system tools.\n\nA: To know more about adduser options visit : Link\nWell to change a user from ordinary user to system user use usermod -s option :\nusermod -s /bin/false userName\n\nI would suggest you also to visit : Site\nbin/false :\n\nMany times you will have a system where you need a user to exist in the account database (say, /etc/passwd) but don't want to give them shell access to your machine(s). A common solution to this is to set a user's shell to /bin/false. This has the effect of rejecting shell login attempts over ssh, telnet, or other shell-requesting protocols. It may have other side effects too, but those are beyond the scope of this article.\nSimply using /bin/false as someone's shell does not keep them from using said account to authenticate over ssh and using non-shell tools such as port forwarding. A default configuration in sshd will often allow tunneling and other non-shell activity.\n\nReference\n\nA: Change a user? I dont know. But you can create a system user with no login and no home directory by issuing the following command : \nsudo adduser --system --no-create-home\nFor more information, see the man for adduser.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu Touch OS on a bricked N900 phone? I recently got interested and bought a used N900, because of the many cool things I heard about it.

Now instead of reverting back to Maemo 5, I wanted to try Ubuntu Touch as the new main phone OS. \nHow to install Ubuntu on a bricked phone, using Windows 7?\n\nA: Ubuntu on a mobile is much more complicated than on a PC, you need an image especially made for your mobile. Ubuntu is not really ready for phones (yet) and the most advanced images are listed here but there seems to be no progress on yours:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices\n", "Q: How to set default time for QML DatePicker? According to the API I should use date property, but with mode: \"Hours|Minutes\" the picker stays at 00:00.

Some quick general recommendations.\nServer-side ciphersuite ordering\nThe default ciphersuite of OpenSSL includes support for PFS, but does not prioritize that at handshake level. Also application may have their own default ciphersuite setting to initialize OpenSSL with.\nCheck regularly for new recommendations\nAlways set your own ciphersuite/protocol settings to modern recommendations. Every now and then vulnerabilities are found and may decrease security if still used. For example, RC4 should be disabled, but two years ago it was recommended to prioritize that for the BEAST attack back then. That was patched in OpenSSL weeks after, but people keep using RC4... :(\nCreate DH params!\nAlso, never forget to create DH parameters or else PFS won't be used for non-ECDHE ciphersuites! It's a common mistakes I see with people around me. OpenSSL will be initialized without legacy DH params and resulting in lack of PFS for non-ECDHE clients.\nFollow up-to-date recommendations\nThis wiki page managed by the Mozilla security team keeps a list of simple instructions and reasons for their recommendations.\nhttps://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS\nVERY much recommended to follow this!\nCheck online\nUse for example the Qualys SSL Labs test: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ and follow up the recommendations.

I have been doing a bit of reading.  It seems most people believe it is unwise to install KDE applications in Xubuntu, but nobody really explains why it is unwise.  Can someone please explain this to me?\n\nA: This has most likely historical reasons.\nWhen you install Xubuntu with the expectation of a lightweight and small-footprint desktop environment, you might find the extra 50 MB of QT/KDE dependencies to be a too hefty pill to swallow just to run a few KDE applications. Given temporary storage sizes, the net effect is negligible unless you run a really old, embedded or resource constrained system.\nAnother point is that in the past KDE applications would not have the same look and feel as Gnome/GTK+ applications - this is mostly untrue these days - KDE/QT emulation of GTK+2 (xfce/lxde) is even better than GTK+3 (gnome-shell/unity).\nAlso a noteworthy mention is that KDE3 mostly relied on a homegrown DCOP-Server for program inter-operation. With KDE4, this has been replaced with D-Bus, which has become a de-facto standard. Additionally, the current audio back-ends and libraries like phonon, gstreamer and pulseaudio interact pretty well.\nSummarily, there is none to little technical reason left to shun KDE-applications from a Xubuntu install, but outdated habits tend to perpetuate themselves first into superstitions, then into religiously leaded debates.\n", "Q: Create , Write and Save file from a Shell script I don't want to write the file manually, so I made a shell-script.\nIs there a way to write & save the file automatically without getting the user to press keys?\nsudo nano blah\n#write stuff to file\n#save file\n#continue\n\n^ This will be inside a *.sh file\nOr is there another way to create a simple text file in a script?\n\nA: There is no need to mess about with an editor to do this.\nYou can append something to a file with a simple echo command.

If you run a windows executable (.exe) in Wine, depending on how Wine is set up the executable can access your home directory, meaning that if one was to run Cryptolocker in Wine, it could possibly encrypt all your files in your home directory.\nBefore running any executable in Wine I would scan it first with VirusTotal or ClamAV.\n\nA: I don't think CryptoLocker like applications need root privileges. It's enough to have user privileges to encrypt the home folder...\nThere are similar applications, e.g.: Linux encoder, which can infect Linux. By the Windows variant (the original CryptoLocker) if you have writable Samba file shares with the infected machines, then those folders can be encrypted as well. Otherwise it is harmless to Linux.\n\nA: Only if you let Windows onto your Ubuntu system.\n\n\n*\n\n*virtualbox, vmware: cryptolocker will lock your containers. \n\n*networkshares: if cryptolocker can access the files so can it lock them. \n\n\nBoth from real life experiences: I had to clean up a few systems in the past few days. 3 companies housed VM Ware containers with Ubuntu server on a Windows server to do their administration and used shares to copy files to and from it.\nIn theory Ubuntu can get infected directly but then that software needs to be installed onto your system. That tends to be a manual task with Ubuntu. Automated updates for official releases are (up to today) secure and safe. \n\nA: No, the known variants of Cryptolocker are not able to infect or corrupt any Linux/Unix OS, like Ubuntu.\nRemember that, since Linux is becoming more popular, it will be targeted more often by virus writers. Keep your system updated using only the official repository (it uses PGP security) and always use a correctly configured sudo to execute administrative commands; never insert your root password in untrusted applications and you'll be fine.\n", "Q: I get Authentication is needed to run `/usr/bin/dropbox' as the super user in a system popup window on startup.

So I downloaded the amd64 iso, burnt on a DVD, then booted from DVD in UEFI mode and installed Ubuntu.\nIt worked fine, I had Ubuntu and Windows 8 installed. On booting GRUB asked me if I wanted Ubuntu 13.10 or Windows Boot Loader (UEFI).\nI used few times Ubuntu, and was ok.\nThen I needed to boot Windows 8. I have booted it and worked a bit. Then shutdowned the pc.\nWhen I powered it on, GRUB didn't appear anymore! It booted directly on Windows8 !\nI reinstalled Ubuntu with the DVD and GRUB came back, then when I booted Windows8 GRUB disappeared again.\nDoes Windows delete GRUB? How can I have a \"persistent\" version of GRUB installed?\nThank you very much\nEDIT: I tried all the workaround proposed, with no luck. I guess it is a problem in the VAIO firmware, which has strange settings about boot. PC manufacturers are worse and worse... They produce PC only for Windows, which I would not even define as an O/S.\nBye\n\nA: Is it really missing or just not the default anymore?\nThis may just be a misconception, please take a look at the boot order in your firmware setup screen or run efibootmgr if you are in Ubuntu. Windows actually installed two bootloaders: the default UEFI bootloader for the drive in \\EFI\\boot\\bootx64.efi, which – to my experience – will create a new entry in the NVRAM that is linked to \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\Bootmgfw.efi, the \"real\" UEFI Windows bootloader. It's very likely that by choosing to boot the Windows entry from the GRUB menu you booted the default UEFI bootloader, which set Windows as the default again. In that case simply move the Ubuntu entry up to the top in in the boot order.\nWindows is not evil, Fedora does it too\nI found that Fedora does something very similar, but neither Windows' nor Fedora's default bootloader removes entries from NVRAM. Your Ubuntu entry should still be in NVRAM and you should be able to boot it via boot override (ASUS boards have this feature in the setup screen), firmware boot menu (F8, F11 or F12) or – as mentioned above – by rearranging the boot order in the firmware setup screen (formerly called BIOS setup screen).\nI want to point out that this is not a bad idea or bad practice. If you have installed an operating system and it boots from an entry in the NVRAM of the firmware, you can't take the drive out and boot it on another computer. That's where the default bootloader on the EFI System Partition (ESP) comes into play and can either boot the operating system or create a new entry in the NVRAM to the proper bootloader or do both.\nWorkarounds\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Windows always via it's \"Windows Boot Manager\" entry from the firmware boot menu (F8, F11 or F12). Never use the default bootloader (e.g. selecting the hard drive from the firmware boot menu), as it will alter the boot order.\n\n*Create a custom GRUB entry to boot Windows. Be aware that you need to change every occurrence of msdos from the example to gpt as you seem to be using a GPT partition table, like all Windows 8 preinstallations do.\n\n*Backup \\EFI\\boot\\bootx64.efi and replace it with Gummiboot, it will also find the Windows Bootloader on the ESP, but not alter the boot order.

This can be tricky, as Windows expects a certain partition scheme to be used.  Let me show you a diagram:\n[(Windows RE Tools)(EFI System Partition)(Microsoft Reserved Partition)(Windows 8.1)(Anything else)]\nYou can use your favorite tool to edit these partitions.  I prefer Gparted, but any good disk partitioning tool can handle this.  Backup your Windows install first.  Then, resize the Windows 8.1 partition so that you have enough space for another OS.  I prefer to give my Linux installs about 50-100 GB of space (for expandability).\n3)  Download your Ubuntu (use 64 bit only and I suggest 13.10) iso and put it on some media (CD/DVD/USB/(insert your preferred media here)) by using your favorite tool (most people prefer Rufus) or dd.  There is an alternative option to this(see *).\n4) Shut off Secure Boot and Fast Boot in the UEFI.  DO NOT TURN ON LEGACY BOOTING (if your motherboard supports UEFI only booting without Secure Boot and Fast Boot on.)\n5) Insert your install media and install Ubuntu in the partition you made earlier.  Make sure that for your EFI boot partition, you make the installer use the EFI System Partition already created by Windows 8.1.  The partition should be something like sdXn (replace X with the drive it is on and n with the partition number, such as /dev/sda2), but this could be different.  DO NOT REFORMAT THIS PARTITION!!  You are only going to tell the installer to use it as the EFI partition.  It will put the grubx64.efi bootloader for Ubuntu in this location.  \n6) With that done, continue the install as normal and set up your partitions as you see fit.  Once the install is finished, you should be able to boot into Jessie easily.  \nIf you are trying to fix an existing install of Ubuntu, you will need to do:\nsudo apt-get install grub-efi-amd64\nsudo modprobe efivars\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdx (x being the drive Ubuntu is installed on)\nsudo update-grub\nFrom there, the UEFI should use Grub-EFI as the bootloader. I have not found a way to get the Windows 8 bootloader to see and allow Linux to boot in UEFI.  YYMV.\n*Note: If you want to not go through the hassle of Rufus or dd, I have had limited success following this procedure.  \n1) Make the UFD into a GPT disk.  You can do this using diskpart in Windows (sometimes) or using Gparted in Linux (99% of the time).  \n2) Format the disk to FAT32.\n3) Download your iso.\n4) Extract the iso onto the UFD.  Make SURE it has an EFI folder in the root partition of the drive.\n5) Once the contents are extracted, take the disk back into Gparted.  On the partition, right click and bring up the Manage Flags dialog.  Click check the boot box. There is also a way to do this in diskpart, but it requires setting the id of the disk, which is just a pain.  \n6) This disk should now be UEFI bootable.  Follow the rest of the guide from where the asterisk was to the end.  Caveat, since this is on a laptop, there should be a mode that has UEFI with CSM which shuts off Secure Boot and Fast boot and will still allow the D-I to install in UEFI mode.  Pray your laptop has the option to disable Secure Boot without doing this.\n", "Q: How to install Dropbox 2.6.27?

The naive approach would be setting an hourly cron job for security updates (sudo apt-get update && sudo unattended-upgrade).\nAre there any risks of doing that? Is there a recommended update mechanism for EC2 machines?\n\nA: The unattended-upgrades package is the standard way to automatically apply important bug fixes and security patches in Ubuntu. \nI recommend installing this on every Ubuntu system:\nsudo apt-get update &&\nsudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades\n\nYou don't need to create your own cron job. The package installs one for you.\nYou can edit the default configuration if you'd like to alter its behavior:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/automatic-updates.html\n\nA: We have been using unattended-upgrades from 2015 to 2020 with no issues.  We have a small setup (on DigitalOcean) with:\n\n\n*\n\n*nginx\n\n*mysql-server\n\n*php5-fpm php5-curl php5-mysql\nBased on good past performance, doing updates this way feels safer than not doing it.  But that's not necessarily a guarantee for the future!\nThis might not be such a good idea for apache, based on the reports of other users, and my past experience of apache updates. [See above, and here]\nWith unattended-upgrades, manual intervention will still be required when the release approaches EOL.\n\n(Aside from the question: In my experience with TWiki, WordPress and Jenkins, keeping these apps up-to-date is actually a greater concern than the OS itself, although of course we should really do both.  For peace-of-mind, you could sandbox Internet-facing apps as non-root processes running inside a Docker container.)\n\nBut since you asked about best practice, the primary approach recommended in AWS documentation is:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Create and start new instances to replace your current online instances. Then delete the current instances.\nThe new instances will have the latest set of security patches installed during setup.\n(February 2020)\n\nThis can be done as part of a blue-green deployment strategy.  The advantage here is that you can run tests against your new server before switching traffic over.  If your tests are thorough, then in theory your updates can be fully-automated, verified before going live, and with no downtime.\nOther advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*The tests can give you advanced warning if human attention is required (as opposed to unattended-upgrades, when the warnings only come from your users once the problem is live!)\n\n*If your system does get compromised, or you decide to switch providers, this approach should make it easy to roll out a fresh deployment.  Your deployment strategy is scripted, rather than ancient memory.\nBut of course there is more setup required for this approach than simply installing unattended-upgrades, and more complexity, so there is still room for error.\n\nAWS does also mention performing the \"Update Dependencies stack command\", which seems to be their official way of doing something similar to unattended-upgrades.  It seems that can be triggered from their Instances interface, but I'm not sure if it can be automated.\n", "Q: How to add languages to Guest session ? I want to add Arabic language to guest season, because there is only English, but i can't  do it.\nCan any body help me with that problem ?\n\nA: This is a long standing bug, see here.\nThere are several workarounds, see here, but, that wiki page applies to 14.04 only.\nFor earlier versions of Ubuntu, there is an old wiki page here.\nAnd on that page is a program you can install, guest-session-prefs-lightdm-0.12.tar.gz \nTo install you would run:\ntar -xf guest-session-prefs-lightdm-0.12.tar.gz\ncd guest-session-prefs-lightdm-0.12\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nIt then runs when you log into the guest session.\n\nIf you launch a guest session right after having installed guest-session-prefs, you are prompted to choose between English and Swedish. \n\nThey also state:\n\nFor those of you who want to be able to select language, the language related code ought to be useful. If one language (e.g. French) is enough, but the launching regular session might be run in some other language, the code in /etc/guest-session/prepare.sh can be exchanged for:\n\necho \"fr_FR\" > /tmp/guest-session-lang\n\nChange \"fr_FR\" to you language. \nIf all that fails, from the bug report,\n\nThe tutorial I mentioned shows how the guest session language can be set irrespective of the system default. The key lines of code (in prefs.sh) are:\n\necho \"Language=$long.utf8\" >> /var/cache/gdm/$USER/dmrc\necho \"export LANGUAGE=$short\" >> $HOME/.profile\n\nIf all of the above fails, I suggest you post on the bug report.\n", "Q: Ubuntu slow in lenovo s215 I just bought a lenovo netbook, the spec is\nAMD E1 2100 1.4Ghz with HD 8210\nRAM 2GB\nis it make sense with that spec my ubuntu is running slow? or is there anything i can do to make my ubuntu run faster?\nsometimes when i browse the internet and page is loading the cursor is blinking.\ni use ubuntu 12.04 LTS with Gnome classic as my desktop environment (it was gnome 3, but it is really slow like a snail)\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with Unity as default desktop environment.

The problem is that the default video player does not display characters like 'ș', 'ț' even though I've tried all the central european encodings. Is there any fix for this?\n\nA: VLC can display Romanian diacritics marks if you go to VLC menu - Tools - Preferences - Subtitles and OSD, and choose from Default encoding section South-Eastern European (latin 10) . \nThis won't work for integrated subtitles so you can either choose to download Romanian subtitles and load them over the integrated subtitles or use ffdshow codec pack in Windows only to be able to change integrated subtitles default encoding to show Romanian diacritics.\nTo make sure Romanian diacritics are working 100% in Ubuntu, you should also install TrueType Microsoft fonts. Open a terminal window and type in:\n             sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n\nand press YES when prompted to accept EULA for installing MS true fonts or these fonts won't be installed at all.\nVLC player will be able to use most of these Microsoft fonts after you reboot the system. I recommend Comic Sans MS or Trebuchet MS or any other font that includes MS in its name. These fonts are compatible with Romanian diacritics, and especially 'ș', 'ț' as mentioned in your post.\nSo, it is important that you don't forget to also select an adequate font in VLC subtitles menu to make sure that your Romanian subtitles will work 100% in VLC player and also in any other video player with eastern european support for subtitles.\n", "Q: Sublime Text doesn't open files from PcManFM Do you have any clue what might me a problem when opening text file from PcManFM file manager by Sublime Text 3?

Does anyone know how I can get what ever I need for this to work? Thank you so much.\n\nA: You can connect your SonyXperia phone to Ubuntu, just you need to do a few settings. At your Sony Xperia phone, go to settings, and then Xperia(tm). Tap on the Connectivity and then USB Connection Method. Choose MSC instead of MTP. You now have the capability to access your SD storage card. You can't access Internal Memory, however.\nIf you don't have Windows 7 OS software, you have to look for it.

After downloading iso file, download the .zsync file, which wall be available after the final release.  Using that .iso file and .zsync make the final release as described here.\nThe problem is I don't know which iso file should be selected to download.

If possible, try using a new hard disk and see if the problem persist.\nOther problems may include such as faulty motherboard, faulty power supply, or loose wire connections. It can be your RAM, but this is quite rare.\n\nA: In Linux you actually can remove files that are used by an application. In that case the folder entry gets removed immediately so you can't see the file any longer but the actual file content only gets freed when the application closes the file. \nFiles removed by the system or due to hardware bugs usually don't end up in the trash but just disappear. Only if you use some applications like a file manager the file gets moved to the trash. As you found the file in the trash folder you most likely removed it by mistake.\n", "Q: Run PHP from the command line I have installed XAMPP v1.8.3 for my PHP development.

Once you are in the Live session, make sure you have an Internet connection (configure your network if necessary from the system tray using the network manager).\nNext, you can choose to install Ubuntu using Live Installer icon that is present on your desktop. When presented with the 3 choices for installing Ubuntu in dual-boot with Windows Vista, choose the 3rd one saying Something else. You will be getting to the partition table for your hard-disk, and you can choose the partition where you want to install Ubuntu. Make sure you divide that partition into 2 separate partitions, a large partition formatted as linux ext4 for root with foreslash / as startup point, and a smaller partition (up to 2GB in size) formatted as linux swap.\nNow you can select the root partition that you have previously created and press NEXT to continue installing Ubuntu. \n", "Q: Where is the bash history for the root user saved? I'm not talking about .bash_history from my home directory. I usually prefer to use sudo -i or sudo su and then run commands as root user.\nSince, after these commands the history is not saved in the .bash_history file from my home directory, I want to know if this history is saved somewhere or not and if yes, where?\n\nA: Well, when you're logged in as root, the bash history is saved in /root/.bash_history file, where /root is the default home directory for root user. To prove this, run the following command when you are logged as root:\necho $HISTFILE\n\n\nThe $HISTFILE variable points to the file that contains your history.\nSource: $HISTFILE\n\nGenerally when you log into another user account, the bash history will be saved in a file called .bash_history located in the home directory of that user.\nFurthermore, if you want to save the bash history for the root user in another file, let say in .bash_history file from my home directory, you have to edit /root/.bashrc file, and add a new line at the end of file with the following content:\nHISTFILE=\"/home/username/.bash_history\"       #change username with your user name\n\n\nA: Typing history on the shell list the all the commands in the history. One can use the following command to save history to another file:\nhistory > *textfile*\n\n\nA: I'm used to using the shortcut list via the up key on the keyboard which shows the last used command for that user. If you log in as root then you will be shown the history for the root user.\nTest it like this, sudo -i fill in the password and then hit the up key on the keyboard. Now you will scroll through the last used commands in the order recent to oldest. \nI know Radu Rădeanu answer is what you wanted. But this also solves the problem at hand. My solution is more of a handy way of remembering an old command which may save time and hustle. \n", "Q: How do I install Pinta? I ordered a new computer with Windows 8 to test before rolling out. It arrived with Ubuntu 12.04. Rather then just send it back, I decided to check it out first as I think the system is probably much better than the MS options. However, try as I might, I cannot get a PPA set up. I'm trying to install Pinta-Paint but can't find the line to copy into the software centre. Please could someone point me in the right direction.\n\nA: Assuming the repo hasn't moved it should be:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:moonlight-team/pinta\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pinta\n\nSee also the installation section here:\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/05/pinta-paint-net-clone-adds-new-tools-features\n\nA: I only know about Pinta package but I have also found something else called Pinta – Paint.NET clone for linux. If you want to install this one, all you have to do is to type the following codes in a terminal emulator:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:moonlight-team/pinta\n\nInput your password when asked for it, and press Enter to add the ppa to your Software Sources list. Next type these codes in the same terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pinta\n\nIf you want to install latest stable release for Pinta (image editing software, Gimp replacement) then you can use these codes:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pinta-maintainers/pinta-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pinta\n\nI never used the first one (Pinta – Paint.NET) but I am guessing this is the one you want since Pinta image editing package is already present in the Software Center list.\n\nA: Pinta Repository - Ubuntu Precise\nPinta is available in a software repository, or PPA. In an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution it is very easy to add a new PPA to your software repository lists to install new software or provide system updates.\nFor more information on PPA's click here.\nAfter installing a repository one of the easiest ways to install almost any application is to use the Ubuntu Software Center. If you already have this in your repository list continue to Installing Pinta via the Ubuntu Software Center.\nCopy, one line at a time, to install the following PPA to get the latest stable release and paste them in a terminal and press Enter\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pinta-maintainers/pinta-stable\n\nOnce you've installed the above PPA, then you must update you system with their package lists. Run the following command:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nOnce you have a PPA setup with Pinta on it and have updated your package list, you are now ready to install Pinta.\n\nInstalling Pinta via the Terminal\nOpen terminal with Ctrl+Alt+Tkey-shortcut and after the PPA has been setup (see above), you can easily install Pinta from the terminal with this command:\nsudo apt-get install pinta\n\n\nInstalling Pinta via the Ubuntu Software Center: \nOnce you have the PPA's setup and your system updated with their package list, now we can install Pinta via the Ubuntu Software Center:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*Search for pinta\n\n*Click the 'Install' button to install Pinta.\n\n*Once it is installed you can now use Pinta. Navigate to: Menu ▸ Graphics ▸ Pinta (This is the default location in most menu systems. Your results may vary.)\n\n\nA: As of November 2017, there seems to be no working ppa (neither moonlight-team nor pinta-maintainers).\nVersion 1.6 can still be installed from the Ubuntu Software Center and works mostly well.\nA developer wrote in July 2017: Pinta development \"has certainly slowed down - I haven't had very much free time to work on it lately.\" Hopefully this will change again.\n", "Q: Which recognized flavors of Ubuntu have been granted the LTS status for 14.04? The recognized flavors of Ubuntu as of 14.04 release are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edubuntu - Ubuntu for Education\n\n*Ubuntu GNOME - Ubuntu with a pure GNOME desktop\n\n*Kubuntu - Ubuntu with the KDE desktop environment\n\n*UbuntuKylin - Ubuntu localised for China\n\n*Lubuntu - Ubuntu that uses LXDE\n\n*Mythbuntu - Designed for creating a home theatre PC with MythTV\n\n*Ubuntu Studio - Designed for multimedia editing and creation\n\n*Xubuntu - Ubuntu with the XFCE desktop environment \n\n\nWe know that Ubuntu 14.04 is an LTS release with 5 years of support. Which of these recognized flavors have been granted the LTS status for 14.04? And, for what duration?\n\nA: The decision to grant LTS status to recognized flavors is taken by The Ubuntu Technical Board.\nAll the recognized flavors have been granted the LTS status for 14.04. Their support duration are:\nSupported for 5 years\n\n\n*\n\n*Edubuntu\n\n*Kubuntu\n\n*UbuntuKylin\n\n\nSupported for 3 years\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu GNOME\n\n*Lubuntu\n\n*Mythbuntu\n\n*Ubuntu Studio\n\n*Xubuntu\n\n\n\nMeeting summary of The Technical Board.\n", "Q: Migrating from Windows XP to Ubuntu I have a 5 year old notebook computer. It uses Windows XP, and as you might know, this OS now has no support at all.\nIt has a 1.60GHz, 0.98GB of RAM.\nWhat would you guys recommend me , in order for me to happily migrate from Windows XP to Ubuntu program.\nI appreciate in advance any help you can provide me regarding this matter.\nRegards\n\nA: Seeing the hardware you have (CPU: 1.6 GHz, RAM: 1 GB) I recommend to download Xubuntu or Lubuntu before testing Ubuntu. This is not related to which one is better but I am trying to make sure that the Ubuntu version works OK on your hardware. I also would recommend, like Devesh said, to wait until 14.04 is out (Which will happen next week on April 17, so the wait won't be long).\nHere's what each of them would look like once you have them installed:\nLubuntu\nVery lightweight Desktop environment (Lightweight meaning that it uses small amounts of RAM, CPU and HDD space). The menu, where all the apps can be found, is located in the same place as you have them in Windows XP.\n\nXubuntu\nAnother lightweight Desktop environment. The menu can be found in the top left corner so instead of going down to the bottom right corner, you would go up.\n\nUbuntu\nThis is the main Ubuntu distribution. It uses a bit more resources than the other two, but I have tried Ubuntu on computers with 512 MB of RAM and it has ran correctly. You would also need a good video card. Still, you would need to personally test this. From Booting time, to how fast apps opened, to how fast you can work and be productive with each Desktop environment.\n\nYou need to know that, independent of what Ubuntu flavor you decide to select, you can install from any of them, the other desktops to try out. What I mean with this is that, if you download Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Gnome Ubuntu or any Ubuntu official version, you can install from the Software Center (The application that manages installation of other apps and updates) any other Desktop environment. So you could have installed Xubuntu but you also wanted to try out Lubuntu, so you would go to the Software Center and download the lubuntu-desktop package. This would make your system have both, Xubuntu and Lubuntu. you can choose which one you want to use from the Login Screen.\nI would also invite you to read about Start Ubuntu which guides new Ubuntu users into this open source world.\nSo with everything here said and taking your hardware into consideration my recommendations would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Xubuntu or Lubuntu first before trying Ubuntu\n\n*Download ONLY the 32 Bit version. The 64 Bit needs more RAM in order to perform better.\n\n*If you have a low graphics card I recommend staying with Xubuntu or Lubuntu only.\n\n*Remember that you can test other Desktop Environments (DE) from any of the other Ubuntu versions just by installing their appropriate package (lubuntu-desktop for Lubuntu, xubuntu-desktop for Xubuntu...) \n\n*Run the LiveCD/LiveDVD/LiveUSB which is a Live session of Ubuntu that does not install on your computer but runs directly from CD/DVD/USB. This way you can test out the DE and how it feels to you before even installing it on your system.\n\n*Remember that you can install Ubuntu alongside Windows XP. There is no need to eliminate Windows XP completely. At least while you get accustomed to how the DE looks, works and behaves. The Ubuntu installer will give you an option about installing alongside in case you want this or you can be a brave warrior and go straight to Ubuntu FTW!.\n\n*Remember to backup anything you want to save in case you want to format the whole system and install Ubuntu only.\n\n*Use the SEARCH option in Ask Ubuntu when you find a problem you can't solve. There are more than 3000 questions related to Windows XP and more than 2000 related to Windows XP and the installation procedures. So there is a sure bet you will find most of the issues solved already.\n\n\nSo with all of this said, I applaud you and say: Welcome to Ubuntu my friend.\n\nA: I would recommend you the latest upcoming version of Ubuntu, i.e. 14.04 LTS. And you have to use the 32-bit version as according to the specs you have given, you system does not supports 64-bit OSes. And Ubuntu will be a nice option because of its openness and of course, its free.\n\nA: Since your configuration is a bit low, it would be getter if you go for the lighter version of Ubuntu called Lubuntu. its a light weight version of Ubuntu. It is a fast and lightweight operating system developed by a community of Free and Open Source enthusiasts. The core of the system is based on Linux and Ubuntu. It focus on speed and energy-efficiency. Because of this, Lubuntu has very low hardware requirements. \nSo in my opinion this would be the better option for you. \n1.download the .iso file from this link :\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/13.10/release/ \n2.Then install this by burning the iso to a DVD or installing via pen drive.here's the link for the software you will need if you plan to do so: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ \nHope this helps\n\nA: It is not Ubuntu itself that is slowing the system down, IMHO.   Go with Ubuntu and install some alternate window managers and watch an underpowered system zoom.  \nI like XFCE, LXDE and FluxBox, and since you can change on the fly I think of it (conceptually not literally) as going to an XP, Windows95 or an even more basic mode \"as needed\".  You can switch window managers while running the OS and, once alternate WMs are installed, you have the option of picking one when you login to the system.\nGenerally I stay in the last mode I am in until I have some reason to change but the \"user experience\" is not something I care about too much.\n", "Q: How do I run Popcorn-time / Flixtor?

This wiki page lists Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog) as the first Ubuntu released by Canonical Ltd.\nBut I wanted to know whether there ever was an Ubuntu 1.x, as in Windows or Mac OS. If yes, is it available somewhere?\n\nA: Ubuntu's version numbers are made using the year and month of their release date: Ubuntu 12.04 was released in April 2012, Ubuntu 11.10 on October 2011 and so on.\nUbuntu 4.10 was released in October 2004 and is the first Ubuntu release.

On Ubuntu, these are /lib/ld-linux.so.2 and /sbin/ldconfig.\nEverything else that is marked executable is run through an interpreter, for which two formats are supported:\n\n\n*\n\n*Files starting with #! will have the interpreter name between this and the first newline character (that's right, there is no requirement that \"scripts\" be text files).\n\n*ELF files have a PT_INTERP segment that gives the path to the interpreter (usually /lib/ld-linux.so.2).\n\n\nWhen such a file is executed, the kernel finds the name of the interpreter, and calls it instead. This can happen recursively, for example when you run a shell script:\n\n\n*\n\n*The kernel opens the script, finds the #! /bin/sh at the beginning.\n\n*The kernel opens /bin/sh, finds the PT_INTERP segment pointing to /lib/ld-linux.so.2.\n\n*The kernel opens /lib/ld-linux.so.2, finds that it doesn't have a PT_INTERP segment, loads its text segment and starts it, passing the open handle to /bin/sh and the command line for your script invocation.\n\n*ld-linux.so.2 loads the code segments from /bin/sh, resolves shared library references and starts its main function\n\n*/bin/sh then reopens the script file, and starts interpreting it line by line.\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the kernel, the only difference is that for the ELF file, the open file descriptor is passed rather than the name of the file; this is mostly an optimization. Whether the interpreter then decides to jump to a code segment loaded from the file, or interpret it line by line is only decided by the interpreter, and mostly based on convention.\n\nA: Just use file:\n$ file /usr/bin/add-apt-repository\n/usr/bin/add-apt-repository: Python script, ASCII text executable\n$ file /usr/bin/ab\n/usr/bin/ab: ELF 64-bit LSB  shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=569314a9c4458e72e4ac66cb043e9a1fdf0b55b7, stripped\n\nAs explained in man file:\nNAME\n   file — determine file type\n\nDESCRIPTION\n This manual page documents version 5.14 of the file command.\n\n file tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.

The first test that succeeds causes the file type to\n be printed.\n\n The type printed will usually contain one of the words text (the file\n contains only printing characters and a few common control characters and\n is probably safe to read on an ASCII terminal), executable (the file con‐\n tains the result of compiling a program in a form understandable to some\n UNIX kernel or another), or data meaning anything else (data is usually\n “binary” or non-printable).  Exceptions are well-known file formats (core\n files, tar archives) that are known to contain binary data.  When adding\n local definitions to /etc/magic, make sure to preserve these keywords.\n Users depend on knowing that all the readable files in a directory have\n the word “text” printed.  Don't do as Berkeley did and change “shell\n commands text” to “shell script”.\n\nYou can also use a trick to run this directly on the name of the executable in your $PATH:\n$ file $(type -p add-apt-repository | awk '{print $NF}')\n/usr/local/bin/add-apt-repository: Python script, ASCII text executable\n$ file $(type -p ab | awk '{print $NF}')\n/usr/bin/ab: ELF 64-bit LSB  shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=569314a9c4458e72e4ac66cb043e9a1fdf0b55b7, stripped\n\n\nTo find the file type of all executables that can be found in the directories of your $PATH, you can do this:\nfind $(printf \"$PATH\" | sed 's/:/ /g') -type f | xargs file\n\nAnd to run file on all files in a particular directory (/usr/bin, for example), just do\nfile /usr/bin/*\n\n\nA: File command is great , but for more professional analyzing tool , i would like you to try  TrID package which is a  File Identifier tool.\nTrID is an utility designed to identify file types from their binary signatures , and its easy to use .\nFor more information and the package just visit : Site\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server: Boot Messages on terminal 7 (video) Why?

So I cant boot into the install anymore, it says: \nSYSLINUX (not sure the number) EDD 4.06-pre7 Copyright (C) 1994-2012 H. Peter Anvin et al\nI am trying to boot from a PNY usb flash drive, I know its not the usb because i used this to boot into it brfore also i cant boot into any other linux distro either, so can someone please reply?\n\nA: I'm just going to take a stab in the dark here and say that Syslinux probably isn't able to locate ldlinux.sys. ldlinux.sys is added by Syslinux when it the bootloader is installed. It is the second stage of the Syslinux bootloader (the whole bootloader doesn't fit in 412(?) bytes). The deal is, though, that it has to be at a specific point on the disk. If it's been moved from that specific location (perhaps via copy/paste) then Syslinux will not be able to find it.\nThe key to fixing this is to find syslinux.exe (I'm assuming you're using Windows for this process) on your drive. If you don't know where it is, look in unetbooting/pendrivelinux Program Files folders.\n\n\n*\n\n*Take note of the above location\n\n*Open a command prompt (as Administrator)\n\n*cd \"C:\\path\\to\\syslinux.exe\"\n\n*BE VERY CAREFUL HERE THAT YOU SPECIFY THE CORRECT DRIVE LETTER! syslinux -m -a F: (where F: is the drive letter of your USB drive.)\n\n*syslinux will then re-add the ldlinux.sys file, but in the correct location so that it can be read at boot.\n\n\nHopefully that should rectify your booting situation.\n", "Q: /usr/bin/file from Ubuntu 32-bit ARM I want \"file\" binary which is usually located at /usr/bin/ .

It is also a Pentium 4 at 3.2 GHZ. I supped it up to 4GB RAM, with 3.2GB available, a number of years ago. I am also running XP SP3. I tried the Ubuntu disk that makes a boot disk and it kept wanting to make ISO copies of itself. I finally went out and got the download from the Ubuntu site and had the same results. I did some research and found that my DVD burner program was not capable of decoding the download or the Ubuntu disk and I had to find another ISO decoder. The free one on the Ubuntu site kept telling me that there was a bug in the free decoder. Good luck if you can make it work. Long story short, the problem was in the ISO decoder.\nMy advice is to take the free download, make sure that your burner program is able to decode the download, if not get one off of the net that will decode the ISO download. After I did this, the sailing was smooth and now I am completely happy. My machine runs like it is a new machine.\nFYI The boot, after it is burned, it should have visible icons and files and not simply another ISO icon referring to your burner program.\nThe only thing that I feel a little guilty about is not paying anything to these people for their hard work, but I think that I will look into finding a way to repay their kindness by contributing in some manner.\n", "Q: It is not supported to create click packages for a non UbuntuSDK target I've just finished a first version of my app port to QML and tried to create a click package but Ubuntu SDK said \n\nWrong kit type\n  It is not supported to create click packages for a non UbuntuSDK target\n\nMy project is of type QML Extension Library + Tabbed UI and I've removed networking from policies.

I did it in python, just want to see if it could be done from terminal, bash scripting or whatever.\nSuppose I have a file that looks like so:\n2,4,5,14,9\n40,3,5,10,1\n\ncould it be sorted like so, by rows (lines)\n2,4,5,9,14\n1,3,5,10,40\n\nor is it too complicated? I did it using python, I just want to know if it could be done so next time I might not use python. What I have done, is creating lists and sorting them.\n\nA: This should do about what you're looking for.  It will read a file (test.txt) and create an output file (sorted.txt) with the sorted lines in the same order as they appear in the original file.\nwhile read line; do j=$(echo \"$line\" | sed -e 's/,/\\n/g' | sort -n); echo \"$j\" \n    | sed -e 's/ /,/g' >> sorted.txt; done < test.txt\n\n\nA: Here's another Perl approach:\nperl -F, -lane 'print join \",\",sort {$a<=>$b} @F' file.txt\n\nAnd another shell/coreutils one (though personally, I prefer steeldriver's excellent answer which uses the same idea):\nwhile read line; do \n    tr , $'\\n' < <(printf -- \"%s\" \"$line\") | sort -g | tr $'\\n' , | sed 's/,$/\\n/';\ndone < file.txt\n\n\nA: The only real difficulty in doing what you want using command-line scripting is that the available sort function expects to sort lines within a file, rather than fields within a line. To work around that, you could replace the field delimiters, line-by-line, with newlines prior to the sort function, then replace the newlines with delimiters again in each line after sorting. \nThere are a number of available text processing utilities which would allow you to do that (including sed, awk, or even the simple tr) however the bash shell itself can do a lot nowadays. Assuming you meant for the input to be comma-delimited (you have a mix of commas and whitespace delimiters in your example) you could do:\nwhile read line; do \n  sorted=$(sort -g -- <<< \"${line//,/$'\\n'}\")\n  printf -- \"${sorted//$'\\n'/,}\\n\"\ndone < file\n\nIf you do need to handle space delimiters in the input, then you can add them as part of a character list [, ] for the input substring replacement:\nwhile read line; do \n  sorted=$(sort -g -- <<< \"${line//[, ]/$'\\n'}\")\n  printf -- \"${sorted//$'\\n'/,}\\n\"\ndone < file\n\n(note that the output remains strictly comma-delimited though).\n\nA: Here comes an awk solution,\nwhile read -r line; do (echo $line | awk '{ n=split($1,a,\",\"); asort(a); for(i=0;i<=n;i++) { print a[i];}}') | xargs | sed -e 's/ /,/g'; done < text.txt\n\nExplanation:\n\n*\n\n*awk '{ n=split($1,a,\",\"); asort(a); for(i=0;i<=n;i++) { print a[i];}}'\nawk Splits the field 1 according to the delimiter , and store each value into the array a finally the top position is stored into the variable n. Next asort(a) function sort down the array values.Then the for loop inside the awk command prints the sorted values in the format of record by record.\n\n\n*xargs | sed -e 's/ /,/g'\nxargs combines all the rows into a single row.\n\n\n*sed -e 's/ /,/g'\nIt replaces the spaces with commas ,\n\n\n*while read -r line;\nAll the above awk,xargs,sed functions are done line by line with the help of while loop.\n\nA: Using tr and sed\nSimilar in spirit to what jkt123 wrote:\nwhile read i; do tr , \\\\n <<< $i | sort -n | tr \\\\n , | sed 's/,$//'; done\n\nIt iterates over the lines, and for each line replaces commas by newlines, sorts the resulting lines numerically, then turns newlines back to commas. The main problem is that this will end the whole result with a comma not a newline, which is addressed by that last sed. It strips the last comma and also implicitely adds a newline to its output.\nUsing bash arrays\nHere is a different approach to deal with this “join with commas” issue:\nwhile read i; do j=( $(tr , \\\\n <<< $i | sort -n) ); ( IFS=,; echo \"${j[*]}\"; ); done\n\nOr written with line wraps:\nwhile read i\ndo\n   j=( $(tr , \\\\n <<< $i | sort -n) )\n   ( IFS=,; echo \"${j[*]}\"; )\ndone\n\nIt uses a bash array to store the result of the sorted row, and makes use of the way bash expands arrays into string literals using the IFS special variable.\n\nA: python -c \"your code here\" input.txt\nOr, if your program has multiple lines and eval() is too slow:\npython yourprogram.py input.txt\nThis oneliner works:\npython -c \"for l in open('input.txt'):print(','.join(sorted(l.strip().split(','), key=int)))\"\n\n\nA: You can do this easily using perl\nconsider you have file text.txt\ncat text.txt\n\n1,5,7,8,3,6\n10,34,67,1,2,0,5\n\nNow the following perl code will sort the rows in text.txt\n perl -i -e 'while(<>){chomp; my @sorted = sort { $a <=> $b } split(\",\", $_); print join (\",\", @sorted); print \"\\n\"}' text.txt\n\nAfter sorting\ncat text.txt\n\n1,3,5,6,7,8\n0,1,2,5,10,34,67\n\n\nA: The shortest solution using a perl oneliner:\nperl -ne 'print join(\",\", sort { $a <=> $b } split(/,|\\n/)).\"\\n\"' text.txt\n\n\nA: I needed this functionality too, and a solution I found is as follows (assuming data are in test file):\ncat test | while read line; do echo $(echo $line | datamash -t',' transpose |sort -g| datamash -t',' transpose); done\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 doesn't let Citrix (icaclient) run For years, on Ubuntu 10.04, 11.10, 12.04, 12.10, and 13.04, I have been able to access my workplace using Citrix (icaclient).\nAfter the OS upgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I use Firefox, everything that I try to do that requires Citrix causes the browser to grey out as if overloaded.

I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 to a spare SSD on my computer, and I'm working on the setup now. I have installed Win7 on another drive in the same computer, and after that I used a thing called SlimDrivers to update all my drivers. Is there a similar thing for Ubuntu? Do I need to do anything special? The Software and Updates program said (under Additional Drivers) that no additional drivers are available. Can I trust that and just assume I'm done with my setup?\nI'm really sorry I'm so clueless with this. I've toyed with Ubuntu before, but only in VMs. This is my first time fully installing it onto a computer.\n\nA: \nIs there a similar thing for Ubuntu?\n\nNo.\nLinux (and so Ubuntu too) uses generic drivers. This means we have 1 specific driver for similar devices. So we have 1 open source driver for nVidia, 1 for AMD etc. Besides that one driver there might also be a driver created by the manufacturer itself (that one is called proprietary).  Same goes for printers, scanners, wireless, usb.\nDownside of this method: if the generic driver does not include that specific piece of hardware it will not work out of the box. \n\nDo I need to do anything special? \n\nAfter installing you should update your system and then check additional drivers. It is not needed to use a different driver. Sometimes they are even better than the proprietary. \n\nThe Software and Updates program said (under Additional Drivers) that no additional drivers are available. Can I trust that and just assume I'm done with my setup?\n\nIn general yes but you need to supply more information about your setup for a more detailed answer. If you do not have an nVidia or AMD graphics card (but an build-in Intel for instance) there will be no proprietary driver. Same goes for wireless: only a few wireless chipset have an extra driver (broadcom for instance).\n", "Q: my wireless signal got ether weakend or no loger working after using Software updater on Ubuntu 13.10 how to fix this I am new to both linux and ubuntu And giving them a try . after installing ubuntu 13.10. the wireless seems to work just fine.

So I found a way to get scheme on my machine because I'm reading Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs but I have to type 'mit-scheme-x86-64' instead of 'scheme' which is what I would prefer to type. \nIs there a way to map 'scheme' to that longer phrase? If so, what is that even called? \nThanks!\n\nA: There are several ways.  The simplest is to create an alias.  Run this at the bash command line:\nalias scheme='mit-scheme-x86-64'\n\nIf you like that alias, put it in your ~/.bashrc file and it will be available to you in every shell that you open.\n\nA: At the link of IstallingMITScheme I found this fix.\n\nAs the package works now it doesn't properly start with typing scheme. To fix this run \"sudo ln -s -T /usr/local/bin/mit-scheme-x86-64 /usr/local/bin/mit-scheme\". You should be able to use scheme just like at school. \n\nI am also beginning to work through MIT-OCW's courses 6.001 to 6.006 and have tried to install scheme on Ubuntu 14.04.

How do I do this now (he refers to the two packages in the title)?\n\nA: Using ubuntu-drivers, the available commands are described below:\nusage: ubuntu-drivers [-h] [--package-list PATH] <command>\n\nList/install driver packages for Ubuntu.\n\npositional arguments:\n  <command>            See below\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\n  --package-list PATH  Create file with list of installed packages (in\n                       autoinstall mode)\n\nAvailable commands:\n   debug: Print all available information and debug data about drivers.\n   autoinstall: Install drivers that are appropriate for automatic installation.\n   devices: Show all devices which need drivers, and which packages apply to them.\n   list: Show all driver packages which apply to the current system.\n\nSource\nThus you can get the list of package names with sudo ubuntu-drivers devices and then install the respective packages using apt-get.\nAfter installing the one you want to use, you have to remove the one that you don't want to use.

I want to reduce my compiz effects because of my limited graphics card.\nIs it safe to disable \"copy to pixmap\" feature on my compiz?\n(I'm using 14.04 Trusty Tahr Daily Build)\n\nA: Yes, it is safe. However, nobody knows what is the setting for. It is reported that it can improve smoothiness in window movement. Try with this option and without. It shouldn't crash.\nIt is probably an opengl feature – its a way for drawing stuff without getting visual artifacts on the screen.

I am planning to use 20GB just for ubuntu and install the rest of the apps to a different partition of >150GB\nI really did not find any clue about these.\nIf it helps I used to be a Win7 user\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Concerning question #2, you can't -- at least, not easily. Ubuntu follows the Unix model of file placement, which is pretty rigid about where certain things go. For instance, user binaries (program files) almost always reside in /bin, /usr/bin, or /usr/local/bin, depending on what type of program they are. What's more, the package files that you install put the binaries in those locations, and moving them from their original locations is inadvisable because doing so would break the package system, complicating software updates.\nWhat you can do is to mount different partitions at certain locations. For instance, you could have a separate partition for /usr or /usr/local to isolate binaries on their own partitions. This is most easily done when you install Ubuntu, though. It's also something that's not recommended for novices because you need to understand disk space needs, the rules for what can be split off into separate partitions, etc., and novices generally lack such expert-level knowledge.\nNote that Linux's structured disk model is different from that in Windows, which has historically encouraged many different ways of using the disk, including more mixing of user and OS data. Some experienced Windows users have developed their own systems for organizing data, which might or might not translate well into the Unix/Linux world. Furthermore, Linux doesn't draw as much of a distinction between the initial OS installation and subsequently-installed applications as is the case in Windows, so isolating applications that you install yourself seldom makes much sense.\nYou don't say in your question why you want to put your applications on a separate partition. Depending on your needs, there may be ways to do what you want within the Unix/Linux model. For instance, some people split off /home into a separate partition. Because most user files go in subdirectories of /home, this has the effect of isolating user files from OS files, which can simplify backup and certain types of re-installation tasks.\nAnother complication in your case is that you did a WUBI install. WUBI installs Linux strangely, using a file in a Windows partition instead of a separate Linux partition. WUBI is being abandoned and is generally not a recommended way to install Linux any more.\nOverall, I'd say you might be best off by wiping out WUBI, repartitioning the disk, and doing a conventional dual-boot installation. When you do this, do not use the Windows disk partitioner to create partition(s) for Ubuntu; just use it to shrink the Windows partition and leave free space for Ubuntu. Use the Ubuntu installer to create new partitions for Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Downloading files available on a website My aim is to download only the files available on websites such as those on http://pelusa.fis.cinvestav.mx/tmatos/LaSumA/LaSumA2_archivos/NumeRCPs/ansi/index.htm under the \"Access via Directories:\" title.

I think downloading specific file types and saving to a desired place is a function provided by wget.\n\nA: Most times it's quite more handy to stick to the browser (assuming firefox):\nTherefore you need a kind of download manager:\nFoxySpider (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/foxyspider/) does recursive fetching of files for specified types of files (file extensions) (\"Well, actually get any file type you want from an entire website\").\nAlso DownThemAll (http://www.downthemall.net/) does it (\"DownThemAll lets you download all the links or images contained in a webpage and much more: you can refine your downloads by fully customizable criteria to get only what you really want.\").\n\nA: This will retrieve all .c and .h files:\nwget -r -l1 --no-parent -A c,h http://pelusa.fis.cinvestav.mx/tmatos/LaSumA/LaSumA2_archivos/NumeRCPs/ansi/recipes/\n\nResult will be a directory structure \npelusa.fis.cinvestav.mx/\ntmatos/\nLaSumA/\nLaSumA2_archivos/\nNumeRCPs/\nansi/\nrecipes/\n\nand the .c and .h files will be in recipes/  (it will not save in the same target directory since that could overwrite files).\n\nThere are other tools that might be easier, like lftp (it supports globbing better than wget). \n\nA: In flareget download manager, you can use batch downloader to achieve the same. It supports wild cards too. In file menu click batch download or you can even import links from a website using import option.\nhttp://flareget.com\n", "Q: Will the Ubuntu replace my Windows?

So Debian effectively broke node programs because packages like less that look for a command named 'node'.\nIf you happen to use the ham radio package then instead of making the symlink you could change the shebang line in the lessc file to #!/usr/bin/env nodejs as  terdon said in the comments below.\nNote if you use other npm packages you may have to change a lot of shebang lines so only do this if you really use ham radio :)\nUpdate: Ok so I read yorodm's link a bit more and debian has changed the Ham radio package to https://packages.debian.org/sid/ax25-node Trusty actually uses this!\nSo if you use ham radio just delete /usr/bin/node which is a symlink to /usr/bin/ax25-node replace it with a node symlink to /usr/bin/nodejs as at the top of this answer, you will need to do this again if you just install ham radio as it overrides.  \nNow if you want ham radio use 'ax25-node' as the command :D\nBottom line it's easy to use 'node' for nodejs to spite the politics.\nUpdate for the record/archive\nThis post was mainly for people who had installed the official sudo apt-get install nodejs package in Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty Tahr) which removed compatibility by changing the command 'node' to 'nodejs'.\nAt the time the actual better solution would have been to install Chris Lea's ppa on launchpad but now he has moved that again to a different location and this is the best (no fussing with symlinks) out of the box solution by Chris Lea:\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -\n\n(Now designed for both Debian and Ubuntu)\nReferences:\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installing-node.js-via-package-manager\nhttps://nodesource.com/blog/chris-lea-joins-forces-with-nodesource\nThat's what joyent is linking on there website so that's what I'm using :D\n\nA: According to this Debian changed the name of the node binary to nodejs (that is /usr/bin/node and /usr/bin/nodejs) To fix any issues in your code just make a symlink in /usr/local/bin\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/node /usr/local/bin/nodejs\n\n\nA: If you install nodejs from official repository, you can also install nodejs-legacy package, this will add the missing node command.\n", "Q: How to automatically launch bash shell when opening terminal or in console mode? I create a normal user account in ubuntu using \"useradd\" command, but the problem is that I have to type \"bash\" to launch the bash shell for this user account in both the console mode (in a tty, through ctrl+alt+Fn) and the remote mode (via ssh). The most important part of bash shell for me is the auto-completion function, so my question is that how I could make the bash shell launch automatically when logging into the account.\nI use ubuntu 13.04 32bit version. I appreciate for any advice!\n\nA: First of all, check if useradd shows a default value for SHELL. To do that, issue:  \nuseradd -D\n\nThis will output something like:\nGROUP=100\nHOME=/home\nINACTIVE=-1\nEXPIRE=\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nSKEL=/etc/skel\nCREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=no\n\nThese values are taken from /etc/default/useradd. Now, you have 2 solutions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/default/useradd, and change the value of SHELL, or\n\n*Override the shell's value when adding user with: useradd -D -s /bin/bash\nFor more information see man useradd.\n\nA: You probably need to set bash as your new users's login shell. If you are logged in as that user:\nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nTo change it for another user\nsudo chsh -s /bin/bash username\n\nIn future you might want to use adduser instead of the low-level useradd, since it defaults to setting bash as the new login shell.\nYou can check the login shell (among other details) by looking at the /etc/passwd file or using\ngetent passwd username\n\n", "Q: How to make modprobe ip_conntrack_ftp persist a reboot Sorry if this is a stupid question, but to get outbound active FTP connections through our firewall we need to run the following:\nsudo modprobe ip_conntrack_ftp\n\nI learned this trick from http://major.io/2007/07/01/active-ftp-connections-through-iptables/\nIn that article it says to persist it I should add\nIPTABLES_MODULES=\"ip_conntrack_ftp\"\n\nto /etc/sysconfig/iptables-config\nBut I'm not sure that is right for Ubuntu, should I add ip_conntrack_ftp to the bottom of /etc/modules instead?\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes, you can add ip_conntrack_ftp to /etc/modules. Be attentive, you don't have to enter the modprobe command, just the name of kernel module!\n\nA: Please note that if you are using a nonstandard / custom ftp port, you can just add ports=<portnumber> to the end of the line.\nFor a specific example, HylaFax works using FTP protocol and begins connections using port 4559 as the control port, and then opens passive FTP ports who-knows-where.  All you have to do with a custom FTP port of 4559 is sudo vi /etc/modules and then add a new line to the end of the file with ip_conntrack_ftp ports=4559.  \nReboot and you should be good to go!  \nIf you have more than one ftp service, you could also do ports=21,4559 for instance.\nFor this to work, you will also need the corresponding IPTABLES rules:\n-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 4559 -j ACCEPT\n", "Q: How to start a service living on a Windows partition I am developing a service on my Windows 7 / Ubuntu 13.04 dual boot machine.

Under Windows it can be done. I tried many things in Ubuntu, but none of them worked.\nI am using Ubuntu 13.10 x64.\nTHX. XBMCuser\n\nA: Portable installations of applications isn't something that is usually done under Linux. The main reason being is dependencies. In Windows most programmes ship with every library you need for that programme. As such you will generally have multiple versions of the same library under Windows. \nUnder Linux the library is installed once through the package manager and that library would be listed as a dependency. Many different applications will then use that same version of the library. To get a portable version you would need to make sure that each host contains all the dependencies required or to have all the dependencies on the USB stick as well. This is, of course, not a very good option. \nInstead, what I personally suggest, is that you get a Live USB that has support for persistent storage. This means that any changes you make will be saved. In the Live USB you would then be able to install XBMC and boot up the Live USB on any PC that you require to have XBMC on. For maximum compatibility may I suggest installing a 32-bit version of the operating system instead? This should work on nearly any computer that you require it to then. Ubuntu has support for persistent storage and the USB can be easily made from Ubuntu. The following link should help you get it set up.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\nEDIT: Depending on how the live USB is set up (if a full install to the USB stick was done this is definitely possible)  you could chroot into the USB and then use the host system to run the version of XBMC that is on the USB version of a Linux distribution. For more on this you should research how a chroot works.  \n", "Q: Alternative to Wubi Installer (without cd/usb install) I'm using a old computer and I'm interested in getting linux on it.\nMy computer cannot boot from USB or CD.

I've created passphrase protected RSA key. The public key is installed on remote server in authorized_keys in the user's .ssh directory.\nFrom requesting server, I can SSH into the remote server without a problem, but I need to enter passphrase every time I do this.\nI want to use this key for a Munin server to SSH into a Munin node and get data, so the procedure fails because of the passphrase.\nI have thought of two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the passphrase from the key.\n\n*Save the passphrase somewhere, maybe in a configuration file?\n\n\nIs there a better solution?\nI think ssh-agent is supposed to do something like this, but I cannot find concise information about it.\n\nA: You can use ssh-agent to do this. It allows you to store a passphrase in memory, rather than on disk. There is a good explanation of doing this for batch jobs here: http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_agent.html.\nEssentially, you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run ssh-agent in the background as the user that will be initiating the SSH connection.\n\n*Use the ssh-add command to add the key to the agent. It will prompt for the passphrase.\n\n\nYou can automate the running of ssh-agent by adding it to a script run at startup, but you still need to manually prime the agent with the key in order to enter the passphrase. So if you reboot, for example, you'll have to remember to do this.\nThe point to consider is what you are trying to achieve by having a passphrase on the key being used, given that this is an automated system.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use a key with a passphrase and store it in a configuration file then anyone who gains access to the key is likely to have access to the configuration file too, since they would both need to be accessible by the same user.\n\n*If you use ssh-agent to store the passphrase then it still needs to run on the same machine as the key. It would be harder to get the passphrase out of memory than from a file, but you've just made their work harder rather than impossible impossible. However, if they gain the key without getting access to the machine (eg, from a backup), then this option is more secure.\n\n*If you do not set a passphrase at all, someone who gets the key has no further work to do to be able to use it.\n\n\nIn all three of these scenarios, you would be wise to plan for the worse and take steps to minimise the damage that could be done by someone who gains access to a usable key. For example, you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a specific user account that only has access to the data being retrieved.\n\n*Use a key that is only used for this purpose.\n\n*Restrict what host the key owner can SSH from.\n\n*Restrict what commands can be run using the key - see this.\n\n\nOn balance, only you can weigh up the pros and cons of these approaches, and whether a manual process is acceptable in your situation.\n", "Q: Keyboard and mouse only working after reboot I'm currently running 14.04 beta on a Lenovo Thinkpad Twist (s230u).

I was able to make a bootable USB Stick but the Dell won't boot from it. I hit f12 as it booted and got the BIOS menu but there is no USB option. So I thought about making a CD (the Dell can't read DVD). I have a desktop running Windows 7 that I could make a DVD or CD, but again, the Dell won't read DVD and the CD doesn't have the room for the files. What to do? My apologies if this has already been answered somewhere - I looked thru many of the answers but didn't see any that answered my dilemma. \n\nA: I too have a very old Dell (Inspiron 1000) and it recognizes the flash drive as another hard drive.  Go to the BIOS and you will notice a + by the hard drive entry.  Click on that and you will see the flash drive.  Simply move it to the top, save, and exit.  You will then be able to boot from the flash drive.\n", "Q: How to boot Windows 8 from a legacy MBR partition in UEFI mode via GRUB? This question is similar to the answer \nof Dual-boot Ubuntu 12.10 on UEFI along Windows 8 (GRUB - error: can't find command drivemap), but Windows 8 is installed on a legacy partitioned drive.\nWhat steps need to be performed to make the installation boot in UEFI mode without converting to GPT or using DISM?\nI know that it is generally not recommended to mix UEFI and legacy booting, but it can be handy in some setups.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to boot Windows 8 in UEFI mode, even if you installed it on a legacy partitioned disk (MS-DOS/MBR). Of course you would need a UEFI compatible GRUB installation on another GPT partitioned disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Windows, install a new boot configuration to volume C: by running the following command:\nbcdboot C:\\Windows /s C: /f uefi\n\nWhen booted in UEFI mode this will not only create a new boot configuration in C:\\EFI\\ but also register a new UEFI bootloader in NVRAM. You can remove the entry later with efibootmgr in Ubuntu (for instructions see: How do I remove \"Ubuntu\" in the bios boot menu? (UEFI)).\nOf course you can also choose another location, but this method should be the easiest. For more details on bcdboot see the corresponding Microsoft Technet article.\n\n*In Ubuntu, add a custom GRUB menu entry by adding the following lines to /etc/grub.d/40_custom:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8 (BCD-UEFI configuration on system drive /dev/sda2)\" --class windows --class os {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ntfs\n    insmod search_fs_uuid\n    insmod chain\n\n    set root='hd0,msdos2'\n    if [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,msdos2 --hint-efi=hd0,msdos2 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,msdos2  2ACC7043CC700B79\n    else\n      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 2ACC7043CC700B79\n    fi\n\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nNote that you will need to edit the following parameters if your configuration differs:\n\n\n*\n\n*This entry is configured to boot from the 2nd partition (msdos2) of the 1st hard drive (hd0 or ahci0).\n\n*You also need to replace the filesystem UUID (2ACC7043CC700B79) with yours. In this example you could run sudo blkid /dev/sda2 to get the UUID or start GParted.\n\n*Reminder: This example deals with a drive that has a legacy partition table. If yours is GPT, then replace msdos with gpt.\n\n\n*Finally run sudo update-grub to generate the new configuration.\nAnswer moved from https://askubuntu.com/q/377807/40581 as it looked out of place there.\n", "Q: How to share ethernet over wifi without creating access point?

Will it be a problem in general to install Ubuntu on a laptop with an SSD instead of a laptop with an HDD? Which Linux kernel version is best for a laptop with an SSD?\n\nA: There is absolutely no problem in installing Ubuntu on an SSD. In fact, if you have an SSD, it would be the most recommended place to install Ubuntu on. Thanks to the SSD, you will benefit from:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reduced booting time\n\n*Faster app loading\n\n*Fast Read/Write operations in general (Saving files, opening documents, music, photos...)\n\n*No fragmentation (Although there was no fragmentation on HDD either)\n\n*Longer life cycle (SSD tend to last longer than HDD)\n\n*Everything will feel faster\n\n\nHere is Ubuntu 13.10 on my SSD:\n\nAs you can see, is totally safe, secured, faster, stable and with a big jump in performance.\n", "Q: I'm getting «exec format error» when I try to run an executable I installed Trusty (daily build) a couple days ago and, though overall I'm pleased, I've run into some problems running some standalone apps (not installed) that used to work just fine in 13.10 before the upgrade.\nFor instance, when I tried to run eclipse standard through the launcher, nothing happened.

I bought a new one. It appears not to have any issues, but I can't trust this. This has been very hard for me, but thank you everyone for your help, sincerely.\n\nWhen I originally posted this, I had not seen any evidence of files being lost on my internal hdd, not since installing ubuntu 13.01. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I keep losing files. Years of my life, pictures of loved ones, art and music by myself and my friends. I'm losing it. It appears to be going after older files first, especially anything with \"back up\" in the title, nested folders, and almost exclusively destroys personal content. I believe the problem was lying dormant for the last couple months. suddenly it's popped up, and just when I was starting to believe that AT LEAST Ubuntu Linux had helped me saved most of my stuff. \nI received a new external hdd today. I'll try to save what i can.\noriginal post:\nMy computer is an ASUS G7VW. While running Windows 7, my files started disappearing and being moved and even copied, without my consent. I did a full install of ubuntu 13.01 (it gave me the option to preserve my personal files, but otherwise fully format the drive. everything seemed fine and I was able to recover most of my files since Ubuntu read my HDD correctly and most of the problem had been in the directory. However, the problem continues to ravage my two external HDDs. I haven't found any evidence that it's messing up the contents of my /home folder, but files and folders on both my external HDDs continue to be \"mislocated.\" \nOne of my external drives (toshiba desktop external drive) is fairly new; the other (seagate freeagent goflex) is a bit older. I'm certain that the age of the drive is not a factor in this context. Both external drives and the laptop hdd are 1TB drives. Neither of the external drives have been damaged physically, or even so much as left in a hot/freezing car. I did only find out a couple months ago that usb is not \"hot-swappable\" but now I always unmount then disconnect the drive. The problem has persisted since i've wised up. \nThe drive healthSMART util included in Ubuntu says all drives are healthy. Still, it takes an extremely long time to copy or burn data, from the Ubuntu drive or the USB  drives (if that helps). I've recently been trying `rkhunter, clamtk, and comodo to eliminate the possibility of a virus, so far it's turned up nothing significant. At least I'm learning a lot about Ubuntu Linux... but I hope someone can shed some light on what's messing with my personal files.\nUpdate: I found out why Clamtk wouldn't scan the external drives; it has to run from the terminal via gksu clamtk to select that option. Frustratingly, it's reported well over 300 possible \"threats\" on either hdd, the vast majority of which are not viruses or malware, and since you have to go through them one by one. it's been very time consuming, but I'm hoping it will be worth the effort.\nUpdate & more info: Both of the external drives use the NTFS file system, and the internal drive was formatted with the default filesystem used by ubuntu 13.01 (ext3?). the external toshiba drive is now reporting \"Contents: 207,907 items, totalling 955.0 GB (some contents unreadable)\" ... I don't know why any of it would be unreadable, and that sound about 200GB more than I thought it was holding, but that's just a guestimate.\n\nA: You might want to check the disk's health.  The two tools I would use are smartctl (if your H.D.D.s support S.M.A.R.T.) and e2fsck.  Those should check for hard drive issues and attempt to repair the filesystem if they can.\nThe two things that make me suspect hard drive damage: 1) Disappearing files 2) Slow transfer speeds.\nIf that's not it, you might want to look at auditd which should tell you who/what is moving your files (assuming they are being moved).  If you enable that and it shows you nothing, it's probably hard drive failure.\nauditd tutorial\nsmartctl tutorial\n\nA: so you probably get a virus on the computer,so install anti virus to Ubuntu(avg is good anti virus) and if you download avg write this command(the avg has not graffical user interface)\nsudo avgscan and where do you want to scan(for example the place where you mount the filesystem where has the ubuntu) sorry for my bad English\n", "Q: I have network problems with kubuntu I recently installed kubuntu and for some reason its not picking up on my wireless network.

I had a fresh reinstall of Lubuntu 13.10 and my USB headset seems to be not working. I looked for solutions in some forums, but these didn't work for me.\nMy headset is a Genius Wire Gaming headset.\nThank you!\n\nA: Managing soundcards and audio devices\nUSB and Bluetooth audio devices are individual sound cards, which means that connecting a Bluetooth headset doesn't work like connecting a headset via 3.5mm audio jack, where jack sensing assumes that you want to play audio through the recently connected headset instead of the laptop speakers.\nTherefore when adding new audio devices like Bluetooth or USB headsets and speakers as well es new soundcards or audio interfaces, you should check your configuration to make sure that the sound is played by the device you intend to use. The easiest way is via the Sound Indicator in Unity or via System Settings > Sound:\n\nIf your new connected device is the Sennheiser BTD 500 USB in this example, then you should check that it is selected in the Play sound through list.\nAlternatively you can use PulseAudio Volume Control to manage your sound cards.

I have a home network with a few Linux boxes and a Windows XP laptop.

When it came time to set the hostname, I entered the same hostname I'd been using for this machine, and the installer warned me that there already was a machine with that name on the network. How did it know that?\nAll of the machines (except that XP laptop) have fixed IP addresses, with all of the addresses listed in all of the /etc/hosts files, so there's never any nameserver lookups for these machines.  Also on the net is a DSL modem that runs DHCP, and a Linksys wireless router configured to just be a wireless access point, no DHCP, and with an IP address that doesn't conflict with the DSL modem.\nIt's also true that the XP laptop has the IP addresses listed in I forget which file, so that it doesn't do nameserver lookups for my home machines either, but I don't think that that laptop was even running when I did the install.  The installer was happy to let me insist on using the hostname I wanted, but I'm really curious to know how this information was available to the installer.\n\nA: Based on a launchpad entry it appears that avahi may perform a scan of the network.\nhttp://bit.ly/1eqBSRr\nIf I was going to do it as a user, I'd be using nslookup to confirm the local name server didn't have an entry for the host.\n", "Q: Question about lynx text browser When I go to visit this url \nhttps://github.com/search?q=jquery+stars%3A>10+forks%3A<10&type=Repositories\n\nusing this command for lynx:\nlynx -accept_all_cookies https://github.com/search?q=jquery+stars%3A>10+forks%3A<10&type=Repositories\n\nFirst I get a code like this -> [1] 4324 then another line which says -> bash: 10: No such file or directory \nSo, question is how can I browse this url url lynx? Also I can not curl this url , curl also showing nearly like same. \nI am using ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\nA: Bash is interpreting the URL. The < and & mean things to it so they're being ripped around and aren't being passed to lynx.\nThe simple answer is to quote the url:\nlynx -accept_all_cookies 'https://github.com/search?q=jquery+stars%3A>10+forks%3A<10&type=Repositories'\n\nI'm using single quotes here so that even $ isn't interpreted.\n\nA: The problem is that your URL contains special characters that are being interpreted by the shell because you are not quoting it. So, short answer, use quotes:\nlynx -accept_all_cookies 'https://github.com/search?q=jquery+stars%3A>10+forks%3A<10&type=Repositories'\n\nLong answer: The specific issues here are >10 and &. The & sends a job to the background:\n$ sleep 5 &\n[1] 2015\n\nNote that the above causes a similar message to appear, the number in brackets is the job ID, in this case 1 since it is the only job running in the background and the other number is the process ID (PID) of the backgrounded process.\nThe next issue is the <10 which means \"read input from the file called '10' and >10 which the shell interprets as \"redirect output to a file called '10'`. For example:\n$ echo \"Hello\" > 10\n$ cat 10\nHello\n\nAll of these issues can be avoided if you simply quote such things, quoting will protect special characters from being interpreted by the shell.\n", "Q: System Tray icons not showing After installing a fresh 14.04 install and then installing google-chrome-unstable (Version 36.0.1933.0 dev aura) from the google repository, neither the google chrome icon nor the 'Google Now' notification bell icon appear on the notification bar.\nIn all my previous installs it would appear as soon as I launched Chrome for the first time after installing.

It seems like your graphics driver is not acting right, I am not sure if the open-source driver is working or not, but that could be why your computer is shutting down. \nFrom:\nhttp://support.amd.com/en-us/download\nYou would choose Desktop Graphics, Radeon HD Series, Radeon HD 7xxx Series PCIe *(NOTE), Linux x86_64 as the options.\n\n*If you have it installed in an AGP slot it looks like it is not supported directly off of site.\n\nThe autodetect does not look like it is available for linux, so you will need to know what to select.

I see this command widly used also in somewhere which we do not instsall any thing.

There are two popular packaging mechanisms:\n\n\n*\n\n*debian\n\n*RPM\nBoth these mechanisms use the concept of dependencies. Ubuntu uses debian packaging.\nIf A and B are two packages and A is a dependency for B, satisfying dependency means installing the version of package A as required by B. So, if you just remove B, A will still be there on your system. If you do sudo apt-get autoremove and no other package requires A, then A will be removed. However, note that if you remove A, B will be automatically removed since B depended on A.\n\nA: If the package pkg1 depends on the package pkg2 and you install pkg1 then the package manager will automatically install pkg2 to satisfy this dependency.\nIf you later remove pkg1 again, the package manager will not automatically remove pkg2.\napt-get autoremove will remove packages like pkg2 that got installed not because you asked for it but because you installed and later removed another package that depends on them.\n", "Q: Is there a way to form network connections using shell script?

By default, wget saves the target with the same name as the remote file. Do, for example this\nwget http://www.foo.com/index.html\n\nwill save the file as index.html in your current directory. To specify a different name for the file, use -O (CAPITAL o, as in Oliver) instead:\n   -O file\n   --output-document=file\n       The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all\n       will be concatenated together and written to file.  If - is used as\n       file, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling link\n       conversion.  (Use ./- to print to a file literally named -.)\n\n       Use of -O is not intended to mean simply \"use the name file instead\n       of the one in the URL;\" rather, it is analogous to shell\n       redirection: wget -O file http://foo is intended to work like wget\n       -O - http://foo > file; file will be truncated immediately, and all\n       downloaded content will be written there.\n\n", "Q: How to tell which parameter is being supplied to a command with a redirectioin operator? This works:\n\n$ echo \"notify-send HELLO\" | at now\n\nThis doesn't:\n\n$ at now < echo \"notify-send HELLO\"\n\nIt says 'file or directory not found\".\nI understand there's a -f option to this command, which with which i can supply the file to be executed at a given moment.\nSo this got me thinking... in general, how do i know for which parameter the redirection operators supply the value?\n\nA: You are using two different things here and should be using a third. Let's see:\n\n\n*\n\n*| : This is the pipe operator, it serves to pass the output of one process as input to another:\nfoo | bar\n\nThis runs the program foo and passes its output as input to the program bar.\n\n*>,<,>> and <<: These are the redirection operators, they serve to send data to/from files:\n\n\n*\n\n*foo > bar : runs the program foo and saves its output to the file bar, overwriting1 its contents and creating it if it does not exist.\n\n*foo >> bar : runs the program foo and saves its output to the file bar, appending to its contents and creating it if it does not exist.\n\n*foo < bar :  runs foo, telling it to read input from the file bar. \n\n*The << is a special case, since there is no point in \"appending\" input to a command,  the << is primarily (exclusively AFAIK) used for Here Documents:\n$ cat << EOF > file.txt\n> Hello World!\n> EOF\n\nThe construct << SomeStringHere > Out.file will redirect all text written until it encounters the ending string (EOF in the example above) to the target file. Here docs allow you to easily format multi-line strings and include variables and special characters.\n\n\n*The <<< operator, the Here String, is like a Here Document but it expands variables. So, for example:\ngrep foo <<< \"$bar\"\n\nThe command above is equivalent to echo \"$bar\" | grep foo.\n\n*What you are actually looking for is called process substitution and is another way to pass the output of a command to another. It consists of <(command).\nfoo <(bar) \n\nSo, for your at example, you could do\nat now < <(echo \"notify-send HELLO\")\n\nThe above works because process substitution actually creates a file (read the link above for more details) and it is the file descriptor of that file that is passed with < to at now.\n\n1 The default behavior is to overwrite, this can be modified by setting the noclobber option to bash. If set, echo foo > bar will fail if bar exists. In that case, it can be forced using echo foo |> bar instead. See section 3.6.2 here.\n\nA: In this case, echo \"notify-send HELLO\" is a process not a file - so you need a process substitution rather than a file redirection\nat now < <(echo \"notify-send HELLO\")\n\nYou could also have used a here string to avoid the echo command entirely\nat now <<< \"notify-send HELLO\"\n\n", "Q: Windows 8 VPN Client connecting to UbuntuVNP Server fine but http from client is not working I have connected my Windows Client to Ubuntu VPN pptp.

This box is running from my home. We've set up 3 user accounts. I'm still pretty new to Linux, but I have a bit of experience from using Ubuntu on my own box.\nToday I was playing around with SSH and looking at the logs (I need to learn how to read that information to know how the server is performing, right?) and I saw the strangest thing.\nIn /var/log/auth.log and /var/log/auth.log.1 I saw a bunch of failed login attempts for 'root' and a few usernames I'm not familiar with. I looked over them and for as far as I can see no user has been authenticated except for the actual users on the system. A lot of the IP-addresses listed seem to be from Russia.\nAs of now this server contains nothing but a vanilla Ubuntu Server with LAMP, but even so, with the following command:\nsudo grep -i fail /var/log/auth.log | wc -l\n\nI get 3412 as a result. This seems very excessive for a server that has been up since April 8th. It gets worse, because running the above command on auth.log.1 returns 23075 (!!!!) results.\nIt seems obvious that people are trying to break into the server. Not that it contains anything of value, but once we start making progress on the app we wouldn't want our intellectual property stolen.\nShould I be worried? And what can I do about it?\nEDIT:\nI found some very useful information here and this allowed me to run a script that splits and sorts all the invalid passwords and invalid users that tried to log in. May come in handy to someone who ended up here through Google!\n\nA: This is happening a lot to me too. There are a lot of script kiddies trying brute force attacks against your SSH server.\nMy solution till now was to install DenyHosts, but seems that it will be not supported in 14.04; the next best solutions seems to be Fail2Ban. Links and  more information in Package denyhosts in Ubuntu Trusty Tahr is deleted: temporary or forever?\nIn that answer, bodhi.zazen pointed to this highly recommended page: https://web.archive.org/web/20190828185822/http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/SSH_security\n", "Q: Windows 8 and Ubuntu OS installation possible on the same computer? I have a simple question: \"If I install Ubuntu 13.10 on my Windows 8 PC and lets say I need/want to go back to Windows 8, could I use recovery discs to remove Ubuntu and simply reinstall Windows\"? \nAlso I really would like to play my steam games on Ubuntu, but they are all Windows games, so is there any way I could install Windows steam games on Ubuntu 13.10?

Though, most games aren't compatible or you would need to run through Wine, but that's not saying that they would run properly.\n", "Q: Cannot access internal HDD error mounting /dev/sdb2 (NTFS signature is missing) I just installed Ubuntu 13.10.\nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: AMD A10-7700K   \n\n*APU: with Radeon(TM) R7 graphics × 4    \n\n*mobo: Gigabyte GA-f2a88xm-d3h   \n\n*RAM: 8GB   \n\n*HDDs: primary 128GB + secondary 2TB  \n\n\nJust after installation, I quick formatted secondary with NTFS file system and I started copying files.

Next time look up a bilingual dictionary in your language :) You'll learn to ask better questions.\nSo, as I understood you don't want Amsn and the likes.. Then you say that you want to install msn (\"the Windows one\") instead.\nIf you're so keen on wanting to use that and aren't interested in Amsn's msn like themes and plugins, to make yourself feel more familiar, then it's possible to go straight installing msn.\nIn your terminal (or 'command line') write this text and hit enter:\napt-get install wine*\n\nAfter it's done you can download msn from the official site (not sure about that) and install it as you would in Windows.\nLet me know if this helped you.

I need a way to transfer links quickly in order to open them from my Android smartphone.\nAny ideas?\nNote it's not about files, It's just links and I'm looking for a manner to do it properly, easily and quickly.\nIt could be preferably through internet. But other possibilities would be through: phone network, bluetooth, LAN (wi-fi) or QR code.\n\nA: Chrome to Phone is the official (Google) way to do it.\nBrowser Extension\nAndroid App\n\nA: I've created the following bookmarklet for my Firefox bookmarks toolbar, it uses Google APIs to create a bookmarklet (for simplicity):\n\njavascript:(function(){var i=new Image,p=i.src=prompt(\"Data\",location.href);if(!p)return;i.title=p;i.src=\"https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=300x300&chl=\"+encodeURIComponent(p);i.style.cssText=\"position:fixed;top:50%;left:50%;margin-left:-160px;margin-top:-160px;border:20px solid #ccc;z-index:9999\";i.addEventListener(\"click\",function(){this.parentNode.removeChild(this)});document.body.appendChild(i)})()\n\nWhen activated, it will prompt you to enter data (by default the URL of the current page). Press OK to get a QR code displayed on the current page 1. When done, press the QR picture to make it go away.\nIn order to add it (assuming you have a bookmarks toolbar):\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the bookmarks toolbar, select New bookmark.\n\n*At Name, enter QR (or whatever identifier you would like).\n\n*At Location, paste the above script. Note that spaces will be converted to %20 on pressing OK, this is normal (URL encoding).\n\n*Press OK to save (optionally enter a description mentioning this page in case there is an update).\n\n\nOn your Android phone, install the Barcode Scanner app (beware for malicious clones in the Play Store).\n\n\n*\n\n*Play Store (Google's \"store\")\n\n*F-Droid (OSS repository)\n\n\n1 It will not work for websites that define a restricted Content Security Policy (for example, Github).

For example, I want it to oper Firefox and not LibreOffice when I type ff <return>. Another example is that I want to open Final Term instead of plain Terminal or Terminator when I search for term, yet I still want both apps on my computer since Final Term is a bit shaky.\n\nA: I would say you might not be able to do this directly, but you can simply add .desktop file in the /usr/share/applications/ directory and use the alias as your name for the app. For instance, if you want to use ff for Firefox, add this file:\n/usr/share/applications/ff.desktop\nwith this content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=ff\nComment=FF shortcut to open Firefox\nType=Application\nEncoding=UTF-8\nExec=/usr/bin/firefox\nTerminal=false\nThis should do the trick. For details about .desktop files, you can read the archlinux page about Desktop entries.\nAlso note that you could simply copy the existing Firefox .desktop and adjust it: \n$ sudo cp /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop /usr/share/applications/ff.desktop\n\nThen change the Name tag value to ff. Job done ! \n", "Q: Previous file in ubuntu one I have a huge problem. I accidentally sync broken files to ubuntu one. Is there a way to get previous file (that are not broken) from ubuntu one?\n\nA: No, you cannot get previous versions of files, as Ubuntu One file sync does not support file versioning.\nIf you want previous versions of the file, you will need to grab them from a computer you have, which has them, but which has not synchronized the latest version. There is no other way to restore previous versions of files.\n", "Q: Does the Radeon HD 8570M work with Ubuntu (Saucy/Trusty)? (no hybrid) I'm planning to buy a new computer.

You can either do it on the command line directly (awk '{print $2}' file), or you can create an awk script. What is needed is to somehow bring awk into the equation. You can't use the shell to run awk commands, only awk can do that.\nIn this case, the script is not really needed as steeldriver showed you but you can also do it the UNIX Way® and combine tools:\nawk -F'[[ ]' '/hello.googlebot.com/{print $4}' log.txt | sed 's#:# #;s#/# #g'\n\nExplanation\nThe -F option lets you choose the field separator, in this case, I am giving it a character class that contains two characters: [ and  (space). This means that awk will split on those characters. The resulting fields will be:\n1 : hello.googlebot.com\n2 : -\n3 : \n4 : 10/December/2012:04:14:15\n\nI therefore print the 4th field, and pass it through sed which just replaces the first : with a space (s#:# #) and all / with spaces (all because of the g in s#/# #g).\n\nAlternatively, you could just switch to perl for the whole thing:\nperl -pe 's/.*?\\[(.+?)\\s\\S+\\].*/$1/; s/:/ /; s#/# #g' log.txt \n\n\nA: I'm still not clear exactly what you want to do, but probably the easiest approach would be via awk's substring substitution functions sub and/or gsub e.g.\nawk '/hello.googlebot.com/ {gsub(\"[[/]\",\" \",$3); sub(\":\",\" \",$3); print $3}' logfile\n\nRemember that by default, awk splits on whitespace, so counting the spaces either side of the -, the date field is $3 not $2.\n\nA: Using GNU sed,\nsed '/hello.googlebot.com/ s/.* - \\[\\(.*\\)\\/\\(.*\\)\\/\\(.*\\)\\:\\(.*\\)\\:\\(.*\\)\\:\\(.*\\) .*\\].*/\\1 \\2 \\3 \\4:\\5:\\6/g' file\n\nExample:\n$ echo 'hello.googlebot.com - [10/December/2012:04:14:15 +0100] \"GET /plain.txt HTTP/1.0\" 132 12 \"-\" \"Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)\"' | sed '/hello.googlebot.com/ s/.* - \\[\\(.*\\)\\/\\(.*\\)\\/\\(.*\\)\\:\\(.*\\)\\:\\(.*\\)\\:\\(.*\\) .*\\].*/\\1 \\2 \\3 \\4:\\5:\\6/g'\n10 December 2012 04:14:15\n\n", "Q: How to run Blackberry Desktop Software?

If I configure the proxy, under Settings -> Network -> Proxy, and then try to access \"http://google.com\", the name resolution (IP of google.com) will happen there, at the proxy server but...\nHow can I change this behavior?\nI mean, I need to resolve the DNS locally at my Desktop, BEFORE hitting the proxy.\nBut why?\nThis way, I'll configure \"ignore-hosts with lots of subnets (IPv4 / IPv6), that don't need the proxy to reach them\", then, Ubuntu first needs to:\n1- Resolve the DNS locally (i.e. not via proxy too);\n2- Try to match the locally discovered website IP with \"ignore-hosts\" settings;\nIs it possible?\nTks!\nThiago\n\nA: This isn't possible when you use an HTTP proxy because:\n\n\n*\n\n*The server you connect to is that of the proxy, not of the ultimate destination.\n\n*You send the full URL (including hostname) of your request to the proxy.  The proxy then does the request on your behalf.\n\n\nTherefore, it must be the proxy that does the DNS lookup.\nIt isn't possible to do the DNS lookup locally, and send only the IP address to the proxy server. Firstly, there is no mechanism to specify that the proxy should try a particular IP address for a particular host. You could change the URL from, say, http://example.com/mypage to http://33.33.33.33/mypage, but then the proxy server won't know which hostname to request, an importanta part of the modern web (HTTP/1.1 and later), which depends on a Host header always being present in a request, removing the restriction that all hostnames be served from different IP addresses.\nYour best bet would be to configure the proxy server to use the DNS resolver of your choice. This would only be possible if you use a local proxy server that you control.\nNote: When you use a SOCKS proxy or another lower-level tunnelling method, you can use a local DNS server. Just not with an HTTP proxy.\n\nA: edit: Or you can use a PAC file to control usage of proxy or not depending on your criteria. Autoproxyresultcache if applicable must be off.\nyou can install Technitium and be the DNS server.\nhttps://technitium.com/\n\nA: You need a redsocks proxificator (it will be very difficult to set up because it uses iptables) + some local proxy intermediary like this.\nFeature of redsocks is that DNS queries by default go directly, not through proxy. Run: sudo -H -u proxyuser socks5-server. And then the browser or any application.\nsocks5-server is not necessary, but otherwise you have to run your browser from another user (proxyuser), and run it with xhost+ option.\nInstead of redsocks + socks5-server you can try proxychains + 3proxy (socks) > browser.\nproxychains is a rather weak proxificator and doesn't support all applications (it doesn't support static linked). And then disable SOCKS DNS in your browser. I have not tested this way.\nIn Windows you can use Proxifier.\n", "Q: What's the best way to reinstall Ubuntu on a partition already used for Ubuntu, but seemingly empty?

Finding these is often the primary goal of port scanning. Security-minded   people know that each open port is an avenue for attack. Attackers and pen-testers want to exploit the open ports, while administrators try to close or protect them with firewalls without thwarting legitimate users. Open ports are also interesting for non-security scans because they show services available for use on the network.\nClosed State\nA closed port is accessible (it receives and responds to Nmap probe packets), but there is no application listening on it. They can be helpful in showing that a host is up on an IP address (host discovery, or ping scanning), and as part of OS detection. Because closed ports are reachable, it may be worth scanning later in case some open up. Administrators may want to consider blocking such ports with a firewall. Then they would appear in the filtered state, discussed next.\nFiltered State\nNmap cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. The filtering could be from a dedicated firewall device, router rules, or host-based firewall software. These ports frustrate attackers because they provide so little information. Sometimes they respond with ICMP error messages such as type 3 code 13 (destination unreachable: communication administratively prohibited), but filters that simply drop probes without responding are far more common. This forces Nmap to retry several times just in case the probe was dropped due to network congestion rather than filtering. This slows down the scan dramatically.\nUnfiltered State\nThe unfiltered state means that a port is accessible, but Nmap is unable to determine whether it is open or closed. Only the ACK scan, which is used to map firewall rulesets, classifies ports into this state. Scanning unfiltered ports with other scan types such as Window scan, SYN scan, or FIN scan, may help resolve whether the port is open.\nOpen & Filtered State\nNmap places ports in this state when it is unable to determine whether a port is open or filtered. This occurs for scan types in which open ports give no response. The lack of response could also mean that a packet filter dropped the probe or any response it elicited. So Nmap does not know for sure whether the port is open or being filtered. The UDP, IP protocol, FIN, NULL, and Xmas scans classify ports this way.\nClosed & Filtered State\nThis state is used when Nmap is unable to determine whether a port is closed or filtered. It is only used for the IP ID idle scan.\nSo in your case, the filtered state might be because some packet filtering software might be blocking/preventing the detection. This could be a firewall, router, ip rules, etc.. You could start disabling each one, one at a time to quickly see which one is the one causing the problem.\n", "Q: how to copy directory with wildcard to another folder i need to make a cron that copy folder on /home\nhere is the content of my /home \nfina\nf-logistik\nfolder-surat-jalan\nzone-A\nzone-B\nzone-C\nzone-free\n\nwhat i need to copy is only folder that start with 'zone'\ni've tried :\ncp /home/zone* /home.bak\n\nbut return No such file or directory\nEDIT : and all of the list is folders\nEDIT #2 : i use 12.04 precise.. \n\nA: That's because your $HOME is not /home. It is a sub-directory of /home with the same name as your user. So, if your user name is mootensai, your $HOME is /home/mootensai. To avoid these errors, you can simply use ~ or $HOME both of which are your actual home directory. For example, on my system:\n$ echo ~\n/home/terdon\n$ echo $HOME\n/home/terdon\n\nThe next problem is that if you are copying multiple files, you want to make sure the last file is a directory. Otherwise, each file you copy will overwrite the last one and you will end up with only one file. \nAnyway, the commands you want are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the backup directory\nmkdir ~/backup\n\n\n*Copy the files over\ncp -r ~/zone* ~/backup\n\nIf, as is most likely the case, you are in your $HOME, you can simply do this:\ncp -r zone* backup\n\n", "Q: How can I pipe the output of \"find\" to \"cd\"?

I recommend Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS iso image. Next you need to burn the image to some DVD (it has 731MB in size so it won't fit on a regular CD). If you run windows 64bit, try to burn the image using a 32bit machine, ask some friend for help.\nNext you can boot the Live DVD with Ubuntu, choose Try Ubuntu instead of Install Ubuntu from the boot menu. Once you are in the Live session, you need to setup your Internet connection, and then plugin your USB pendrive.\nYou can start ubuntu installer from the desktop icon present there. Choose the 3rd choice for installing Ubuntu when presented with 3 choices. The 3rd choice is Something else. You will be getting to the partition table for both your HDD and your USB pendrive. Select your USB pendrive from the drop down menu, delete all partition present on it, and create 2 new partitions, one for root formatted as Linux etx4 with foreslah / as startup-mount point which should be a large partition, and the other one up to 2 GB in size for linux swap. \nYou can now select your newly created root partition and press Next to begin installing Ubuntu. Very important, while still facing the partition table window, choose to install bootloader on your USB pendrive (select USB and not HDD from the drop-down menu for bootloader). This way you'll be sure your USB will be bootable, but you also have to change BIOS settings so you'll be able to boot from the USB or press the boot menu key when you startup your computer and choose USB for boot-up instead of HDD.\n\nA: I would skip using DVD and recommend using another USB for liveCD booting and installation. Much easier.. I guess You may need two USB keys though, but I am not sure. I did.\nI see no reason to choose 32-bit version of Ubuntu. I did use 64-bit and had no problems at all (except very old eePC with 32-bit only Atom cpu)\nI strongly recommend to avoid using swap of any kind on USB stick or SDcard, perhaps even SSD. \nEven if my usb is usb3.0 and really gets upto 180MB/s read, it is stil much slower at write = what a great waste of time, if wear of flash abuse is not important for you.\nIn case of You really need swap, you may create file for it later, and perhaps mount it (swapon) in case it is really necessary (not probable at all).\nMoreover, You may benefit from mounting /tmp and some other temporary, cache and log directories into ram using tmpfs in /etc/fstab. Or disable disc cache in web browsers completely..\nA note about UEFI booting - It works with USB as well. You must boot Live using uefi mode, to be able to install uefi boot, and I think You must use GPT instead of MBR partition scheme. \nAn USB installation with UEFI booting, do work well in legacy mode (in older PC), and I think nothing special was done to enable that.\n", "Q: How can I extract filesystem from vdi I am trying to build linux from scratch.

I post the link as a reference to people who seek the same answer:\nhttp://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/convert-vm-iso\n\nA: I have not tried it, but these could be the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*map a host folder as shared folder in virtual box machine. \n\n*use dd command from within the vm to raw copy the vm disk to a file in the\nshared folder.\n\n*use the raw file and dd to write it to a real hardisk.\n\n*use something like gparted to strech the partition to the harddisk length, if not same size.\n\n*boot for that partition and see it if works.\n\n\nA: If your VDI is of type static then you can use a loop mount to mount the VDI in your host using ntfs-3g and just accesses it like any other file system. \nIf it is a dynamic VDI then you can create a temporary VM using a liveCD. Then temporarily release your VDI from your XP VM and assign it to this VM. When you boot the live CD you can then open a command shell and do\n    sudo -i\nmkidir /xp\nmount -t ntfs3g /dev/hda1 /xp\ncd /xp\n#You can now access and edit the XP VDI\n\nIf you want to move files to and from the host, there are various ways: e.g. a second static VDI which you can then loop mount on your host; good old ftp ...\n", "Q: How can I install another Operating System through MAAS?

First of all, my desktop environment is unity. I am using it with 14.04 OS(with all recent updates). I recently installed infinity conky. I installed and followed all the instructions correctly in the readme file provided with the conky. But my conky appears distorted, like this(the background image is my own wallpaper): \n\nAs you would have seen there are boxes after the fonts. The fonts seem to overlap from the last status rather than replacing it(for example you can see the time). Also if you look above the analog clock you will see a half visible icon. This means I also have a transparency issue. Also when i run the conky in the terminal I see output as \"Unknown varaiable\". That output keeps on printing as you can see below: \n\nI attempted configuring the conky with help from the chat room yesterday. This is what I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Changed the font to \"Ubuntu\"\n\n*Disabled anti-aliasing\n\n\nBoth did not work. Here is .conkyrc file (it is without any edits).  \nPS: I tried downloading conky manager from here But it is not available for 14.04. Note that I have conky, conkyall, curl installed. Also is this just a problem with unity itself? Don't unity and conky don't go well with each other? Or is it because I am using a developer version OS that I am being confronted with this problem? \nUpdate :- I noticed something recently. The conky doesn't appear distorted when I start it from terminal. But the moment I minimize or close the terminal, or move to another workspace the conky gets distorted as mentioned above. I thought it was running from the terminal that caused the problem and so added the script to startup applications and rebooted. Now the conky appeared without distortion but only until I opened a new window or moved to another workspace. Thus the problem seems to me to be due to unity. But is it really? If it is so, it is because of which particular aspect of unity and which file should I add when I submit a bug report about this? \n\nA: When own_window_type override is used the distortion is caused. Now to clear the distortion one may use own_window_type desktop in the .conkyrc instead of own_window_type override . But this causes other problems like disappearance of conky when trying to work in the desktop(i.e right clicking, opening a menu from panel etc.). Therefore instead of own_window_type override one may use own_window_type dock . This won't let the conky to disappear when working on the desktop. Also to solve transparency issue one may remove the line own_window_transparent yes and then include the following lines in its place:  \nown_window_argb_visual yes    \nown_window_argb_value 0\n\nActually ARGB visual can be used for real transparency to avoid the default pseudo transparency. Therefore even if there are icons in the desktop, they will be visible. Note that ARGB visual can take values 0-255 and a higher value means a greater opacity. Thus distortions can be removed and transparency can be adjusted. Thus the problem is solved. Note that the boxes after the fonts issue(mentioned and seen in the above screen shot)can be removed by removing new lines but new lines may be required for other formatting. Therefore one has no other go but to live with the boxes. Also note that the problem with the boxes is only prevalent in unity. Other desktop environments like Cinnamon don't seem to have the issue. \nCredits to these sources:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Conky transparency not working\n\n*http://conky.sourceforge.net/config_settings.html\n\n*Help from chatroom .\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with 14.04, after some tests I changed : own_window_type override to own_window_type desktop and now conky is working properly.\n\nA: I used this tutorial: http://wyldeplayground.net/how-to-remove-conky-shadow-in-14-04/ and conky OK!\n", "Q: Is there a plugin for the terminal which allow to detect and open files?

This explaines how to delete a know network.\nsudo rm /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/NETWORK_NAME\n\nIf I understand correctly from this source, run-level 5 is for graphical logins:\n\nRun levels 2 through 5 are full multi-user mode and are the same in a\n  default UserLinux (Debian) system. It is a common practise in other\n  Linux distributions to use run level 3 for a text console login and\n  run level 5 for a graphical login.\n\nYou wrap the above command in a executable script and link it to /etc/rc5.d/your_script.\nA little more information can be found in this answer\n\nA: Addressing the distraction first\nIn the dialog between 'mercmanager2' and 'OrangeTux' there seems to be some miscommunication.  I'm not sure I understand the confusion clearly, but it looks to me like 'mercmanager2' is confusing the wifi access point login with a website login.\nNetwork Manager does indeed remember access point credentials.  For a single user system, this is a huge convenience.  If you want to delete an access point, right click on the network manager, select 'edit connections', then select the wifi tab, select the access point, and click delete.\nIf you want this to happen automatically, \"OrangeTux's\" advice is correct, but will only take place on power down, depending on how you attach it to the rc.5 daemon, which by the way is not for the faint of heart.\nBrowser configurations, in contrast, are kept in the user login home directory and are absolutely isolated.  If I log into a bank, then log out and another family member logs into their SEPARATE user account, they will absolutely be automatically connected to the wifi access point.  They will NOT however have access to my bank without credentials, even if I choose, for my convenience, to save my bank login credentials in my browser settings (which is a bad idea - a big risk for a small convenience).\nReturning to the original question\nAgain, there is a little lack of clarity.  There are different levels of login:\n\n\n*\n\n*to the Lubuntu system\n\n*to the (presumably) secured wifi access point\n\n*to the server hosting the router (firewall or intranet server)\nwhich may or may not exist in \"mercmanager2's\" situation\n\n*and finally to a web server on the internet somewhere\n\n\nThe latter is ALWAYS handled in the browser, not the OS, whether you use Lubuntu or Microsoft or MacOS.\nThe way the question is worded, I'll suppose there is a firewall server.  It appears \"mercmanager2\" wishes to authenticate each internet user on a shared machine individually to the firewall.  An example would be a public library, where different users log in through the same wifi access point, but have to provide personal credentials (a library card number) to access the internet.\nIf the logins are being passed through, this is something you can NOT correct on your local machine, be it Linux, Windows, or Mac.  This is something being handled at the firewall.  At my library, my personal machine gets a lease, associated with my machine's MAC address (a number identifying my wifi hardware).  When I change users on my machine, the lease on the server is still valid, so I am passed through.\nIn contrast, the library's public machines enforce authentication. The lease is canceled when a user logs out and a new lease is issued when a new user logs on.  This is done on the firewall, not the public machine.  This is the same, whether the firewall uses MacOS, Windows, or Linux.\nIf that is not the issue, then I can't make sense of the original question.\n", "Q: Can I use Deja Dup with the SurDoc cloud service? I have recently created an account in surdoc cloud(its a free account). I want to backup my home pc data to surdoc cloud using deja-dup backup. Can anyone tell me what changes should I make to 'Storage' section of deja-dup-preferences to solve the issue?\nI'm using ubuntu 12.04 LTS with lxde DE.\nEdit\nAs I told in comment, after executing deja-dup-preferences, there's section called Storage. In Storage, there's a subfield Backup location which has several options of which only SSH, Windows Share or Custom Location should be chosen. Of these which option should I choose and why?\n\nA: From the SurDoc FAQ:\n\nDoes SurDoc provide WebDAV or FTP access?\nSurDoc doesn’t support WebDAV or FTP access at this time.\n\nSo, no.  Deja Dup cannot support SurDoc storage using standard protocols.

I have recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 and I don't know how to add a new contact. I press add a new contact, but I don't know what to type in. \nThanks.\n(My friend has a mac)\n\nA: The first thing you'll want to do is determine what service you want to connect with. For example, your friend may have a gmail chat account, AIM account, AOL account, Facebook account. etc. You will also need an account with the same service as your friend. \nOnce you know what service you will be chatting through, you can select that in the window that pops up when you click add contact. It should be a menu list of various services.\nThe identifier is the name of the account for your friend, it's sort of like an email address. So for example, if you and your friend are going to connect via a gmail/google chat/XMPP service then his/her identifier might be his/her email address \"something\"@gmail.com. If you plan to use AIM accounts, then the identifier would be their AIM ID. \nSo first, determine the chat service you'll be using and then use the user account name as the identifier.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Ubuntu internet connection problem I installed Ubuntu on my laptop.

Packages providing GRUB\n    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking\n    update-grub.\n \n This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with\n EFI-IA32 architecture, such as the one provided by Intel Macs (that is, unless\n a BIOS interface has been activated).\n\n\nSo that would be: yes.\n\nA: Yes and No:\n\n\n*\n\n*No from the installation point of view, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cdimage/+bug/1025555\n\n*Yes once the system is installed, as you can install the grub-efi-ia32 package.\n\n", "Q: Can't login using my login username and password I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 along side Windows 8.

Initially it worked fine, but now laptop is suddenly freezing. Nothing works then, no mouse, no keyboard , no Ctrl+Alt+F1 or anything. The only option left is rebooting. What I observed is it usually happens on battery. Especially when I leave it off for a few minutes idle. I checked with Dell and got to know that it's not a hardware issue.\nHas anyone else experienced the same?\nThanks!\n\nA: Its due to ATI Catalyst proprietary driver. In 14.04, I am using only open source drivers and its working perfectly fine!\nThanks\n", "Q: Broken upgrade repair Yesterday I prepared to upgrade from Ubuntu 12.10 to 13.10, but something went wrong during the upgrade and my computer got restarted in the middle of the process (at the point of installing packages).\nNow I have a unusable state of system (I still can use the command line version of Ubuntu). How can I repair this state to fully upgrade to 13.10 without losing data? \n\nA: The only upgrade candidate you have from Ubuntu 12.10 is Ubuntu 13.04 which is End of Life. That is the reason why your upgrade failed. Fixing it is rather involved, however you have another chance to make things right. In another two days on April 17 Ubuntu 14.04 will be released. Then you can back up all your personal data by running an Ubuntu live DVD or USB and install Ubuntu 14.04. Ubuntu 14.04 will be a Long Term Support release that will be supported by updates until April, 2019.\nIn response to your question, since Ubuntu 13.04 is End of Life you can skip over Ubuntu 13.04 when upgrading. The instructions for how to do that are found in the answers to the question: Can I skip over releases when upgrading?. However to take this upgrade path you would first have to fix your problem of being stuck in the command line, so once again it would be easier and more fun for you to wait until Ubuntu 14.04 is released and then do a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: To make your update work properly, you need to update in this order:\n[Ubuntu] 12.10 ▸ 13.04 ▸ 13.10 \n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 suddenly very slow For some reason, my Ubuntu 12.04 recently became very slow.\nMy specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*HP laptop, core 2 duo T6600, 2.20 Ghz x2\n\n*Ati radeon\n\n*2 GB RAM\n\n\nSymptoms in Unity 3d: \n\n\n*\n\n*Dash takes endless to open\n\n*Applications take a long time to open\n\n*Often screen freezes\n\n\nSymptoms in Unity 2d:\n\n\n*\n\n*Same as above but less frequent\n\n\nWhat I already checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Driver is xserver\n\n*Tested hardware for 3d compatibility: I get for all positions \"yes\", for both Unity 3d and Unity 2d\n\n\nWhen the problems occur:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU load for both cpus about 25%, which is not much\n\n*RAM swappiness = 10 (changing the value not really matters)\n\n*RAM is almost always on 90%\n\n\nIt is slow on all applications, but most problems occur when I try to open RAW images from an external hard drive.\nI am really clueless what could be the reason.\nTHX for your help\nEric\n\nA: Could be your harddrive.

How to manage other types of ICMP requests?\n\nA: You can this through two methods: using ufw or iptables.\nUsing UFW\nYou need to add:\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP\n\nto:\n/etc/ufw/before.rules\n\nthen run:\nsudo ufw disable\nsudo ufw enable\n\nUsing iptables\nAdd the following rules:\niptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -o eth0 -j ACCEPT          \niptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-reply -s 0/0 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT     \niptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type destination-unreachable -s 0/0 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT  \niptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type time-exceeded -s 0/0 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT       \niptables -A INPUT -p icmp -i eth0 -j DROP\n\n\nA: Another option (not using a firewall) is to set a Linux kernel option.\nAs most things are accessed as files in Linux, kernel settings are mapped into the special /proc file system\necho 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all\n\nyou can also make this permanent by setting the value in the file /etc/sysctl.conf:\nnet.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1\n\nthen execute sysctl with -p flag to activate\nsudo sysctl -p\n\n", "Q: Docky is closing when I plug/unplug the AC cable Every time I plug/unplug the power cable docky is closing.

The analog-output-speaker port is tagged as not available, and the analog-output-headphones is tagged as available.\nAs I said, I really can't take the broken piece of jack out of the output.\nI thought that if I could completely deactivate the headphones output, my speaker output would become available, but I'm not sure.\nAnd I absolutely have no clue about how I can achieve this.\nCould someone help me, please ?\nMy computer is a Mac Book Pro 8.2 (device.product.name = \"Apple MacBookPro8,2 [Core i7, 15\\\", 2011]\"), and eveything else is working fine.\nThank you,\n[Edit]\nAs asked in comments, here is a pastebin for pact list : http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7255739/\n\nA: Install the alsa-tools-gui package (13.10) to get the hdajackretask command:\nsudo apt-get install alsa-tools-gui\n\nhdajackretask will allow you to completely ignore the broken headphones output:\n\nVisit omgubuntu if you need to install it for older releases.\n", "Q: ubuntu internet problem I just installed Ubuntu.\nI have no set correctly my internet configuration.\nHere are my settings:\nifconfig:\n eth0 (inet adr 192.168.10.101)\n eth1 (no ip address)\n lo (inet adr 127.0.0.1)\n\nOutput of my /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0 inet static \n     address 10.1.18.16\n     netmask 255.255.255.0\n     gateway 10.1.18.1\n     broadcast 10.1.18.255\n\nwhen I did service network-manager restart, my ifconfig is changed to the above output.\nping 8.8.8.8 fails\nping www.google.com fails\n\nmy /etc/resolv.conf is this\nnameserver \nAny help, please ?\n\nA: I resolved the problem like this:\nFirst, I edited this file: /etc/network/interfaces with my valid data (I do not want to show them here)\nSecond, I edited this file: /etc/resolv.conf where I added my servername and its address.\nThird, I edited this file: /etc/hosts where I added my IP address and my machine's name.\nFinally, I run this command: sudo service network - interface start / stop / restart INTERFACE = eth0\n", "Q: Local share access problem since my last boot I've been having a weird issue: I can easily access the internet, and ping various websites, however I can't ping any address on my local network.

I'm using the latest version of Ubuntu, with a Wi-Fi adaptor that Ubuntu detected flawlessly.\nWhen the internet drops out, Ubuntu gives me a notification bubble in the top right of the screen, e.g. \"Wireless network, Disconnected\".  There is no clickable \"x\" on these notifications and I can't seem to stop them from returning over and over and over, about once every 5 seconds.  To make matters worse, I can't access the network settings menu in the top right of the screen, because every time I open the network settings meny, a notification bubble pops up and cancels the menu.  This means I can't configure my network, which is what Ubuntu is complaining about.\nSo, the short question: how can I disable those notification bubbles?  Or, what must I do to acknowledge a bubble so that it doesn't pop up again and again and again unless there has been a significant other event?\n\nA: Try this:\nUbuntu disable popup notifications\nThen do the opposite to reenable them.

I've been using Ubuntu since 7.10 on a number of different computers. I'm currently using 13.10 on my home computer and 13.04 on my work computer. I prefer the Gnome 3 desktop experience and it's working great on my 13.04 computer. I recently switched to Gnome 3 from Unity back in 12.04 and have been upgrading with each official release. I did not upgrade my work computer due to a number of complications with Gnome 3 after upgrading to 13.10. I've tried the official Gnome PPA's and also completely purging Gnome and re-installing it (with and without PPA's, tried both ways). Still having issues.\nThat being said, I would like to switch to using a pure Ubuntu Gnome rather than Ubuntu with Gnome installed. I am hoping to avoid the conflicts I've been experiencing and wonder if there was a way to convert my existing Ubuntu install to be recognized as a Ubuntu Gnome install so that when I upgrade to 14.04 it will follow the full Ubuntu Gnome upgrade process rather than the regular Ubuntu process.\nI realize I could \"simply\" (not really that simple) install Ubuntu Gnome on a freshly formatted computer, but I really would rather not have to go through that process if I can help it.\nSo, is it possible to modify my Ubuntu install in some way (PPA's, config files, something else?) to have it recognized as Ubuntu Gnome?

I just installed the latest version of Ubuntu 14.04. Everything was great. I installed the LXDE desktop (not Lubuntu) via synaptic. Everything works fine. I could boot into the Unity desktop and the LXDE desktop.\nThen I installed KDE desktop via synaptic. The boot splash changed, which is fine, but now I can only boot into KDE or LDXE. If I try to boot into Unity, I'm stuck at the splash screen. If I push the power button, the splash goes away, and I see the tail end of a shut-down, as if I'd executed sudo shutdown -h now in a terminal.\nI could simply reinstall, and never use KDE, but I like that option from time to time.\n[edit]\nI found the problem. KDE switched the default display manager to KDM which didn't want to play with Unity. All I needed to do was switch back to lightdm using\n sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nas suggested in this question/answer.\n\nA: In accordance to the edit to your question and my comment, I felt like I should upload this answer...\n\nIt sounds like your display managers are not configured properly. You can reconfigure LightDM (the default one) by running:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nYou will be prompted to select a default DM. In this case, select LightDM.\nReboot (or restart X) and your problem will be solved!\n", "Q: How To Enable Glamor On Ubuntu? How do I enable Glamor mode which accelerates 2D graphics with OpenGL on Ubuntu?\nSee Choose acceleration method on Arch Linux wiki.\n\nA: GLAMOR is an acceleration library merged into the X.Org Server 1.16 that provides 2D acceleration implemented over OpenGL so X.Org DDX drivers no longer need to implement 2D-specific code-paths. GLAMOR is designed to be universal amongst OpenGL / OpenGL ES supported hardware.\nFor Trusty the package to install is:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-glamoregl\n\nAnd you also have to manually edit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/glamoregl.conf to enable it.\nSource: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Glamor/\n", "Q: How to remove kubuntu I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 (using wubi)dual booting with Windows 7.

Not only the command history that is showed by typing history but terminal processes within a command. That is, I want to record the output displayed by the commands in the terminal.\nFor example, One wanna install a package and types sudo apt-get install xxxx then is when terminal is telling you what is doing, it asks for confirmation, for installing additional packages, etc. –\n\nA: The shell keeps a history of the commands that you type, that's what the history command gives you. There is no automatic history of the output from the commands that you run in the terminal. Once you close the terminal, the output is lost unless you saved it somewhere.\nYou can save a complete transcript of a terminal session by running the script command. If you run the command script, you get a new shell prompt; all the commands that you type from that point, as well as their output, are entered in the log. The log file is closed when you exit the script subsession (which returns you to the parent shell — entering exit or pressing Ctrl+D a second time exits the parent shell).\nThe default history file name is typescript (in the current directory). If there is already a file by that name, it is overwritten. You can specify a different file name by passing it as an argument to script, e.g. script hello.txt.\nIf you want to keep the history after closing a terminal, but don't mind losing the history when you switch off your computer, you can run screen or tmux.\n\nA: Please see man history for more details:\nDESCRIPTION\n\nMany programs read input from the user a line at a time.  The GNU History  library  is able to keep track of those lines, associate arbitrary data with each line, and utilize information from previous lines in composing new ones.\n\nHISTORY EXPANSION\n\nThe history library supports a history expansion feature that is identical to the history expansion in bash.  This section describes what  syntax features are available.\nHistory  expansions introduce words from the history list into the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert  the  arguments  to  a previous  command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous commands quickly.\nHistory expansion is usually performed immediately after a complete line is  read.  It takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine which line from the history list to use during substitution.  The second is to select  portions  of  that line for inclusion into the current one.  The line selected from the history is the event, and the  portions  of  that line  that are acted upon are words.  Various modifiers are available to manipulate the selected words.  The line is broken  into  words  in  the same fashion as bash does when reading input, so that several words that would otherwise be separated are considered one word when surrounded  by quotes  (see  the  description  of  history_tokenize()  below).  History expansions are introduced by the appearance  of  the  history  expansion character,  which is ! by default.  Only backslash () and single quotes can quote the history expansion character.\nEvent Designators:\nAn event designator is a reference to a command line entry in  the  history list.  Unless the reference is absolute, events are relative to the current position in the history list.\n\n\nNow, to answer your question! Here are the directories, where your bash-history is saved. And YES, there is the command history, that you can access in terminal with ⇥-key located:\n\n~/.bash_history    \n/root/.bash_history\n\n\nYou can use cat ~/.bash_history, to see the listing/content of previous used commands. You can also open the \".bash_history\", with gnome-open ~/.bash_history, in order to edit the list, or rm ~/.bash_history, to [rm=remove] the history (\".bash_history\" will be autogenerated, so it is save to delete it).\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu didn't come on After finishing the installation process and restarting the computer, Ubuntu didn't start, and no choosing option of which system I wish to use comes up.

The output includes 'button 1'. So, I want to map button 1 to the 'paste selection' as clicking the right and left mouse buttons simultaneously does with my mouse now.\n\nA: I had the same issue today (2016-08-29).  It is unclear what caused it since I didn't upgrade anything in the past 4 days.\nRebooting didn't help.\nKey observation: xev wasn't showing any event coming from the mouse when clicking the middle mouse button (scrollwheel) inside the xev little square. This indicated some low-level driver issue as opposed to an application config issue.\nMouse selection was working fine: clicking Shift+Insert or running xsel from a terminal were both pasting the current selection.\nOnly the pasting via the middle mouse button didn't work.  The problem affected all applications, including firefox and terminals.\nEventually, this fixed it for me.\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg\n\n\nA: this is my configuration:\n~$ cat .xbindkeysrc |egrep -v \"^$|^#\"\n\"xte 'mouseclick 2'\"\n    m:0x50 + c:134\n\nIn this way if made \"work\" the middle button.\nI choose the text I need to copy/paste while holding the right button, after choosing where to paste I click button. If need to paste again the same text, since the square button doesn't raise the same events every time, I'll click it quickly twice.\nIf you select another text the event scattered from the square button is always the one that makes xte to emulate the middle click.\nIs not perfect but better than not having middle click at all. \n", "Q: How do I add a border around windows but keep the current theme? I seem to live my life in the terminal - many terminals in-fact.\nI also love the Ambiance theme - but the new borderless windows does not provide the visual differentiation I'm used to (the same black windows appear to blend into each other).\n\nThus to my question - how do I add back the single pixel border for windows that is found in earlier Ubuntu versions?\nI want to keep the Ambiance overall theme since this looks good and I dont want to swap to another theme.\n\n\nNow I know that I can modify the Ubuntu Ambiance theme as follows:\nmkdir ~/.themes\ncp -r /usr/share/themes/Ambiance .themes\n\nThen flipping between the theme options in the Settings - Appearance picks up changes in the theme in now in the .themes folder.\nI presume I need to alter one of the .css files but I dont know which one.\nI was also looking at this Q&A but the solutions there doesnt work for 14.04.  I also looked at the community wiki but got rather lost trying to figure out which one applies to my situation.\n\nA: Building on Anders' answer, if you want a nice, subtle dark line instead of the default ugly bright/gradient line (just because you can use a gradient doesn't mean you should, Ubuntu!), edit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css like so:\nSet the UnityDecoration extents like in Anders' answer:\n-UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 1px 1px 1px;\n\nChange the background-image to none in left/right, and change the background-color shade from 0.7 to 0.4 in left/right and bottom:\nUnityDecoration.left,\nUnityDecoration.right {\n    background-color: shade (@bg_color, 0.4);\n    background-size: 1px 70px;\n    background-repeat: repeat-x;\n    background-image: none;\n}\n\nUnityDecoration.left:backdrop,\nUnityDecoration.right:backdrop {\n    /* start color: mix of the top border color and bg-image gradient end */\n    background-color: shade (@bg_color, 0.4);\n    background-image: none;\n}\n\nUnityDecoration.bottom {\n    background-image: none;\n    background-color: shade (@bg_color, 0.4);\n}\n\nOptionally, adjust the 0.4 to your brightness preference.\nAfter you change the files, you can either logout and log back in, or simply open the Appearance dialog and change the theme away from, then back to, Ambience.\nHere's the result (may need to view at 100% to see the borders, they're only 1px thick):\n\n\nA: My recommendation is for you to consider leaving the default /usrshare/themes/Ambiance folder as is (for future reference in case you clobber it inadvertently).\nGtk3 appears to take the name of the theme by the name of the directory.  So it might be better to copy /usr/share/themes/Ambiance to a different name such as /usr/share/themes/MyAmbiance and create your personalize theme there.\nIf you want a per-user version you can also copy the theme to ~/.themes and have your preferred version accessible there.\n\nA: I picked up Russ Lyons answer and want to show how it worked for me (Ubuntu 16.04):\nI left alone the original theme files below /usr/share/themes/Ambiance and didn't change anything in there. I agree that changing system files is always a bad idea, for several reasons.\nI created ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css with the following content:\n/* Decorations */\nUnityDecoration {\n    -UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 1px 1px 1px;\n}\n\nNothing else.\nAfter logout-login I now have tiny borders around my terminal windows.\n\nA: Do you like colored border?\n \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css file and\n\n*Comment their current background-color value (/* shade (@bg_color, 0.7); */)\n\n*Then change the background-color to your favorite color(color with hex-code) in bottom, left and right (mine is #ff0080):\n\n\n\n    UnityDecoration.bottom {\n        background-image: none;\n        background-color: #ff0080; /* shade (@bg_color, 0.7); */\n    }\n\n    UnityDecoration.left,\n    UnityDecoration.right {\n        background-color: #ff0080; /* shade (@bg_color, 0.7); */\n        ...\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the file and log out/log back in and see the magix.\n\n\nA: The file is /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css\nchange\n      -UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 0 0 0;\nto\n      -UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 1px 1px 1px;\n\nlogout and log back in and see effect the changes.\nThus, in your local copy, make the \"1px 1px 1px;\" change in the file ~/.themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css\nEnjoy! : )\n\nA: Note that all the changes others have suggested that involve editing the system file /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css can be done without such editing. Instead, just put the desired changes in your own file (that you create), ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css , which will take precedence over the system file.\nExample content (e.g. the whole file ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css)...\n/* Decorations */\nUnityDecoration {\n    -UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 1px 1px 1px;\n}\n\n...you may have to log out & log back in for this to take effect.\nAlso, note that if the terminal window has at least two tabs open, then Ambiance (or Unity?) will already put a medium thick border around the terminal. (ctrl-shift-t opens another tab.)\n", "Q: running old msdos/windows program qa4 ver 4.0 on ubuntu 13.10 Looking for more info on this because I'm not sure how to qualify my qa4 v4.0 program (symantic).

I've been tangling with SAMBA and made some progress:  when trying to \"Add Printers\" from the Windows machines, they can actually see it when doing a network search.  However, Windows invariably asks for a driver (\"The server for the printer does not have the correct printer driver installed...\"), and then when I select one, it delivers the error message \"Windows cannot connect to the printer.  Make sure you have typed the name correctly...\"  \nI've done some research and I found that often this is due to the printer not being \"named correctly\":  using enumprinters, it has \\LOCALHOST instead of the appropriate name.  The suggested fix is to rename the printer using setprintername (rpcclient).  However, I cannot do this:  I always get a WERR_ACCESS_DENIED error.  \nAdditional research on rectifying THAT issue suggests \"granting\" oneself the appropriate privileges (SePrintOperatorPrivileges, using net...user...rpc rights grant)...but I cannot do that either:  I receive a \"Failed to privileges for [user] (NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED)\" message.  What the heck am I missing?  Any help would be appreciated, as this is a critical feature for me.  Thanks in advance!\n\nA: OK, this took research from multiple sites/pages.  I'm finding out that network printing using SAMBA in a mixed Ubuntu-Windows environment can be a complex affair, and this may not solve everyone's issues...but if your symptoms are the same, you can give this solution a shot.  (For all coding below, substitute your computer name for \"computername\" and your Ubuntu login name for \"username\", etc.)\nWhen trying to add a networked/shared printer connected to an Ubuntu machine to a Windows client (so you can print from the Windows machine), the error message from Windows given above (\"Windows cannot connect to the printer.  Make sure you have typed the name correctly...\") may indicate that the printer name being reported by the Ubuntu machine is incorrect.  Windows appears to be very finicky about the name of networks and network resources.  From the terminal, using the command rpcclient localhost, then enumprinters, you may see output like this:\n\nrpcclient $> enumprinters\n    flags:[0x800000]\nname:[\\LOCALHOST]\n    description:[\\LOCALHOST\\HP-SuperJet-10,HP SuperJet 10,Hewlett-Packard HP >SuperJet 10]\n    comment:[Hewlett-Packard HP SuperJet 10]\n\nNotice that the name field only contains \"\\LOCALHOST\\\"...this is incomplete; your printer name should also be in the brackets (in this case, \"\\LOCALHOST\\HP-SuperJet-10\").\nThe suggested solution is to use the command setprintername in rpcclient, but that may get you the error WERR_ACCESS_DENIED instead of WERR_INVALID_PRINERNAME.  This would seem to indicate that you as a user lack the permissions to make system-printer changes.  But after going through a lot of rigamarole trying to give myself the rights (e.g., using SePrintOperatorPrivileges) and getting additional errors (NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED), I checked (net rpc rights list -S Computername -U Username) and found that I had already been set up with those rights!  This is what let me know something else was wrong.\nThe solution I found is to add a line to the Samba configuration file in the [global] section.  From the terminal window, type gksu gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf \nThe line to add is:\n\nforce user = username \n\nSave your changes, close the gedit program, and then in the terminal window, restart the necessary services:\n\nsudo service smbd restart\nsudo service nmbd restart \n\nThat should enable/enforce your permissions to change the printer name.  Enter rpcclient localhost to go back to the rpcclient.  Now, here's another catch I found:  For the setprintername command it seems you have to enter the printer name TWICE...simply entering setprintername = HP-SuperJet-10 didn't work; after testing and failing again, an enumprinters check in rpcclient showed that the printer name STILL only showed \"\\LOCALHOST\\\".  (I'm guessing here, but it may be because that's the proper syntax for the setprintername command).  Enter:\n\nsetprintername = yourprintername yourprintername\n\nFor me, \"yourprintername\" was \"HP-SuperJet-10.\"  An enumprinters command this time should show something like this: \n\nrpcclient $> enumprinters\n        flags:[0x800000]\nname:[\\\\LOCALHOST\\HP-SuperJet-10]\n        description:[\\LOCALHOST\\HP-SuperJet-10,HP SuperJet 10,Hewlett-Packard HP SuperJet 10]\n        comment:[Hewlett-Packard HP SuperJet 10]  \n\nIf you can see the proper printer name appended to the end of LOCALHOST in the name field, you've done it.  I found that when applying this fix, my Windows machines can even see the printer on the network whenever I attempt to \"add a printer\" from them.\nFurther notes:  this solution has only worked so far with me on Windows Vista machines.  Windows 7 appears to be giving me different error messages, which will almost certainly require a different solution.  Wish me luck!\n", "Q: On Ubuntu 12.04, is there any tools to check what programs are connecting to other NFS server share?

Assuming your NFS share is mounted at /mnt/nfs, you could use either of the following commands to look for processes accessing the share:\nlsof -Pni\n\nor\nfuser -m /mnt/nfs\n\nThe fuser option will give you a list of process IDs that are accessing the mount point specified with the -m option.  You can add the -k option to terminate those processes automatically.\nWith the lsof option, you will have to look for the IP address of the server in the last column.  The name of the process will be in the first column.  You may want to stick with fuser.\n", "Q: How do you restore bootable flag to windows partition? On my Dell Inspiron 660 i have windows 8.1.

Please help.\n\nA: Your main Windows boot manager file (EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi on the ESP) doesn't seem to be present. Either Boot Info Script has failed to report it (as sometimes happens) or something's deleted it. If the latter, you should be able to restore it by running a Windows repair utility. Doing that is, however, a Windows issue, not an Ubuntu one, so you should ask about that on a Windows forum.\nNote that Windows can boot from any given disk in only one of two modes (BIOS/CSM/legacy or EFI/UEFI); it can't switch back and forth willy-nilly. Your disk is set up for EFI/UEFI booting, so you will have no luck booting Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If you were trying to do that, forget it and stick to EFI-mode booting.\n", "Q: What's a .desktop file? I wanted to know what's a .desktop file and how can I generate one in order to have a Wine application displayed on my Launcher bar on the left. Now I have to open the folder where I store the executable and open it with Wine, and that's too slow.\nI have done some research and I saw some questions related to this already answered (How does one create a custom application launcher for Wine installed apps?). They say we can generate it, but I don't understand how\nThank you very much in advance! I am a novice to Linux, and I am using 12.04. \n\nA: The top answer in the page you linked to should contain enough information about how to do this.\nA .desktop file is one of many files in /usr/share/applications containing the information about software applications which should be launchable in the desktop environment.\nNote: this is for applications that will be made available to all users.  Naturally, due to permissions, if you do this with a Wine application it simply won't work for other users.\nTo create such a file you can copy-paste from another file into a new file, also with the extension .desktop, and just change the relevant details.\nFollow the precise instructions in that answer and it should work.  If not, then come back and specify what you tried and what happened (in a new question).\n", "Q: How to play DM2 videos on Ubuntu? I'm having problems on trying play \".dm2\" videos on Ubuntu 13.10.\nThe only player that opens this files was SMPlayer, but without image and the sound is a mess...\nAny ideas ?!\n\nA: \nThe output on mediainfo was: AVI: 18.1 MiB, 23mn 9s --- Overall bit rate: 109Kbps --- Video: 48.1Kbps, 1280*720(16:9), at 5.000 fps, TechSmith --- Audio: 48.0 Kbps, 16.0 KHz, 2 channels, MPEG Audio (MP3) \n\nThis indicates that they are ordinary AVI files (seemingly not \"encrypted\") but using the TSCC (Techsmith) codec for video and MP3 codec for audio.\nJust about any player can play MP3 audio so the audio should play fine. However, poor or incomplete support for the TSCC video codec could cause the video not to show and may even cause the audio to stutter due to timing issues.\nAnyway, if any open source player is going to be ahead of the curve in supporting an obscure codec it'll be VLC.  Try installing that and see how you go.\nAt least this forum thread seems to indicate that the VLC player for Linux should have TSCC codec support built-in, but then there are other forum threads that say it's unreliable. Worth a try.\n", "Q: dpkg google-chrome corrupt invalid status I can't get this to resolve itself, can I get some help?\nSetting up google-chrome-stable (34.0.1847.116-1) ...\nupdate-alternatives: error: /var/lib/dpkg/alternatives/google-chrome corrupt: invalid status\ndpkg: error processing google-chrome-stable (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 2\nNo apport report written because MaxReports is reached already\n                                                              Errors were encountered while processing:\n google-chrome-stable\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nstill getting an error while trying to purge:\n$ sudo apt-get purge google-chrome-stable  \nReading package lists...

Since I don't know the network address range that each image will reside on I thought about using an environment variable to hold the network range and use this environment variable in the snort.conf file to set HOME_NET.\nBut that's where everything falls apart.

Any ideas?\n\nA: I would do it slightly differently. Assuming the command that gives you the IP range is\necho ipvar HOME_NET \"$(/sbin/ip route | awk '/eth0/ && ++i==2 { print $1 }')\"\n\nYou could write a little wrapper script that launches snort:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\necho ipvar HOME_NET \"$(/sbin/ip route | awk '/eth0/ && ++i==2 { print $1 }')\" > ~/HOME_NET.conf\nsnort\n\nIf you save that file as snort.sh, make it executable (chmod a+x snort.sh) and run it, it will update the ~/HOME_NET.conf file with the right IP range before launching snort so everything should work as you expect it to.\n\nA: One method I just thought of is to make an external .conf file that creates this variable and include it in the snort.conf like this:\n#snort.conf\n#ipvar HOME_NET any\ninclude ./HOME_NET.conf\n\nThen, create a HOME_NET.conf file that looks like this:\nipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/16\n\nand change/replace the contents of HOME_NET.conf with an .sh script during boot or initial image setup.\n", "Q: Anywhere to download Wine for Xubuntu?

You use the software centre to install it (here is a link).\nUbuntu has come with Wine 1.4 since 12.04 and before that had Wine 1.2, but Ubuntu 14.04 is set to include Wine 1.6.\nXubuntu is just Ubuntu with a different set of packages installed by default which modify the default desktop environment and boot screens. You still can install the same software on it.\n\nI need Wine to run the setup software for the adapter,\n\nNo, you don't.  You don't install Windows drivers on Linux.\nDoes the adapter not just work when you plug it in?

If so, you should re-phrase your question.\nProceeding on the assumption that my re-interpretation of your question is correct, every user of a Linux system has a home directory, which is placed in a subdirectory of /home by default -- /home/jonno in your case. User files go there by default. Although you can use another partition for storing data files, some files will go there anyhow. These include configuration files, some temporary files, Web browser history files, etc. If you didn't allocate much space for your root (/) partition, this can chew up enough space to make it run out of space. Certain system and temporary files stored outside of /home can do the same. For instance, the /tmp directory holds temporary files, and some programs can create pretty big temporary files; and some programs will store big files in subdirectories of /var, too.\nIf you want to use a separate Linux partition for storing user files, the usual approach is to mount it at /home. That will help you predict the size of the remaining root (/) partition. There are lots of questions and answers on this site about using a separate /home partition, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the pros and cons of having a separate home partition?\n\n*I created a separate /home partition, is this a good idea?\n\n*Advantages of separate /home partition on HDD + SSD setup\n\n*How large should I make root, home, and swap partitions?\n\n*How to re-mount a different partition as /home?\nNote that if you're dual-booting and want to use a common Windows/Linux area for user files, it should not be mounted at /home, because the most common filesystems for this purpose (FAT and NTFS) lack critical features that are needed in user home directories. In this case, you should keep using your system as it is, but you'll probably have to re-size your Linux root (/) partition or take steps to clean up temporary or other unwanted files.\nIt's hard to advise you about your specific situation without more information. I recommend you edit your post to include the output of the following two commands:\nsudo parted -l\ndf -h\n\nAdd four spaces at the start of each line of output from these commands. This will keep the formatting intact; without these spaces, the output will be virtually illegible.\n", "Q: running programms on ubuntu I am new on Ubuntu and I have a lot of software like itunes, canon image and printer software which have been installed under Microsoft. Do I have to reinstall them on Ubuntu? Or can I run them via Ubuntu? thank you in advance (even if it may seem like a naive question)\nronmylo\n\nA: You can't install Windows software on Ubuntu. You have to find alternatives.\nLook here to see if your Canon printer is supported on Ubuntu.\nUnfortunately there is no iTunes version or alternative for Linux so you will have to use wine emulator. Read here how to install iTunes on PlayOnLinux (start from step 4).\n", "Q: Cannot connect HC-05 bluetooth module in Ubuntu 13.04 I am trying to pair my HC-05 arduino bluetooth module with my Ubuntu machine for the past couple of hours but with no success.\nI ran the following commands:\nsdptool add --channel=1 SP\nhcitool scan\nsudo rfcomm bind rfcomm0 <MAC address of the HCO5 module>\n\nBut then if I try to connect issuing the following command:\nsudo rfcomm connect 0\n\nI get the error:\nCan't connect RFCOMM socket: Connection refused\n\nI have also edited the /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf file to this:\n#\n    # RFCOMM configuration file.\n    #\nrfcomm0 {\n#   # Automatically bind the device at startup\n    bind yes;\n#\n#   # Bluetooth address of the device\n    device 20:14:02:17:17:38;\n#\n#   # RFCOMM channel for the connection\n    channel 1;\n#\n#   # Description of the connection\n    comment \"Arduino Bluetooth module\";\n}\n\nBut I always keep getting the Connection refused error. I also tried pairing with the module from the bluetooth manager applet. The default pin is 1234 and I have successfully connected with my bluetooth module through my android phone. But here, i see the HC-05 module listed as Unknown and therefore when I try to connect with the default pin, the bluetooth manager generates a random pin and asks me to enter that pin on the other device to complete the pairing request which I can not do obviously.\nWhen I try rfcomm connect I am not presented with a pairing request window where I can just punch in the pin like I did in my android phone.\nI read the blogs and the bluetooth module can be connected to linux machines so I am sure I am missing something simple. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: I had the same problem as you described, where the Bluetooth applet would generate a random pin for me to enter on the HC-05 and then just say connection failed. This tutorial worked for me though:\nBluetooth Serial Communication with HC-05\nit's for the raspberry pi, but works on my ubuntu instance just as well. it basically tells you to add the 1234 pin to\n/var/lib/bluetooth/xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx/pincodes\n\nwhere xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx is the MAC address of your Bluetooth Dongle (not the HC-5). I think the /var/lib/bluetooth/xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx directory is created for you automatically when you plug in the dongle, so probably you only have one directory under /var/lib/bluetooth/ which is the right one.\n\nA: There is quite a bit to manage in at least two different locations.\nThe actual HC-05 has a MAC address, a default PIN number (1234), and default public identity (HC-05).  These can be changed for better security, but it is easier to learn with the defaults in place..  If you change these early on, you have to remember your changes.\nAnd on the Linux side, you have to set up your software to recognize these defaults (or whatever you eventually change to)\nAlso, on the Linux side, you have to start of a Daemon for Bluetooth each and every time you want to use it, unless you modify your INIT lists to start up the Daemon whenever you restart your Linux computer.\nPlus, the /dev/rfcomm0 needs to be checked to see who exactly has Unix rights to use the Bluetooth serial port.   Look at the listing with ls -l.  You may have to assign your regular login to a special group or rfcomm0 will ignore you.\n", "Q: Download Manager, app store First of all forgive me, as I have very little knowledge about computers.\nI have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why doesn't Ubuntu have a download manager installed by default?\n\n*Why are so many commonly used applications like Opera browser, or variety wallpaper changers, or many other stuff not present in the Ubuntu app store, athough they are supported by Ubuntu?\n\nA: Answer 1: Because packaged browsers (Chrome and Firefox) have embedded download managers, but they are not very feature rich so you can try this uGet download manager it is nice, lightweight and well-supported in Ubuntu. uGet Download Manager\nAnswer 2: Not every application would be on Ubuntu app store because applications may not be officially approved by Ubuntu app store or developers want to download our app from their official site or any other reason can be. If you want to download any app you first go to official app store if you would not find anything interesting then of course you would find at Google Search. \n\nA: Opera can be obtained by going to the website. The App store in Ubuntu is developer submitted and depending on the license the software is developed under, it doesn't always get in there.\n", "Q: Mouse \"jumps\" while holding a mousebutton i am very new to Ubuntu (13.10).

You might not have the permission to read the file. You can use the chmod command to change permissions. You may also check the chown command. Once you have set the permissions correctly you should be able to open files using a text editor. \nTo open the file using localhost/worm/data.php, firstly make sure permissions are set properly to the files. The other thing to consider is to check if apache and php are installed or not. If they are not installed check the Apache Documentation. \n\nA: Open Terminal using Ctrl+Alt+T, now type sudo -H gedit, then type your password and press enter. This will open the gEdit program with root permission. Now open your .php file where it's located or just drag the file into gEdit.\n\nA: First let us identify what you mean to open php files:\nOpen for editing OR Open in web browser.\nTo open for editing just right click on the file and choose open with text Editor\nTo open in web browser you should have a web server.

In most cases, going through Debian first can be the best path. This way ensures that your package will reach the largest number of users as it will be available in not just Debian and Ubuntu but all of their derivatives as well.\nHere are some useful links for submitting new packages to Debian:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debian Mentors FAQ - debian-mentors is for the mentoring of new and prospective Debian Developers. It is where you can find a sponsor to upload your package to the archive.\n\n*Work-Needing and Prospective Packages - Information on how to file “Intent to Package” and “Request for Package” bugs as well as list of open ITPs and RFPs.\n\n*Debian Developer’s Reference, 5.1.

Lately, after installing Ubuntu 14.04 I found a strange item on my desktop. I was only able to see it since it had a layover effect on the white background of my browser. This item was a small (about 50 pixels diameter) circle. Upon closing the browser it stayed on the desktop invisible, however hovering the mouse over it made it slightly visible. It could not be closed nor did it have a right click menu. Eventually it changed to a pin which I clicked and it disappeared. \nEDIT: I found that it is always there and has a field assigned to it that turns black when I shutdown/logout. My guess is that it is some kind of widget. However, I don't know where to turn it off and to my knowledge I have no widget enabled. I also found it when logging into XFCE4-desktop. There it is easily visible and has a black box to it. Right click does not reveal anything about it.\nDoes anyone have an idea what that was/is? \nHere is an image of the icon, when hovering the mouse over it:\n\n\nA: I found the responsible program. The indicator \"my-weather-indicator\" has a widget option. However, that widget does not function correctly and puts the below described pin/circle onto the desktop.
