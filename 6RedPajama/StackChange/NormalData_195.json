["Q: What are the system requirements for installing KDE Plasma 5? I'm about to install Plasma 5 on older hardware. What are the minimum system requirements of KDE Plasma 5?\n\nA: If your computer can run KDE 4, you can run KDE Plasma 5 too. If your computer specification higher than http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubuntu#System_requirements, it's definitely that you can run KDE Plasma 5. \n\nA: FWIW, from personal experience, I have run KDE 4 on a Core2Duo 1.8 GHz with 2 GB RAM and whatever graphics Dell built into their laptops almost ten years ago.  As noted in another answer, KDE 5 will run on any system that could run KDE 4; in fact, KDE 5 has been slimmed down some from KDE 4, so requires slightly less performance and resources.\n", "Q: Add notes to books in Calibre Does anyone know of a plugin that lets you add notes to books in Calibre? \nI read quite a lot of books (actual books) and I'm quite used to add little side notes on small sticky notes. Since some books aren't shipped to my location I decided to buy the e-books and use Calibre to read them. Only thing I missed was a way to add notes. I've been using Mendeley for quite some time now, so I know it's possible to add notes but I'm using Mendeley for my work and I don't want to clutter it with e-books. Is there anyone who can help me?\n\nA: There is an answer but you'll have to decide whether making your own annotations is more imporpant than GUI consistency: https://okular.kde.org/ (Obviously a KDE program, so it will install lots of dependency libraries and look ugly in a gnome environment, but it does what you need...)\nActually making your own annotations in Calibre?\nNo-go...\n", "Q: How can I merge free space partition with primary ntfs partition using Gparted in Ubuntu 14.04? I need help partitioning my hard drive properly. An image of my gparted is here:\n\nMy goal is to merge a free space partition into my primary ntfs partition which has Windows 7 on it so i can dual-boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04.  \nRefer to gparted image: sda1 is Windows 7 and sda5 is ubuntu 14.04. sda6 was ubuntu 12.04 but i just deleted that partition and now it is free space. I want to be able to use that space for windows 7. The sda3 is my windows recovery drive.  \nShould I merge sda6 with sda1 or just make it as a folder inside Win7? I'm expecting to merge it but I don't know how. Help please!\n\nA: I suspect that what you need to do is to shrink the extended partition in order to create more unallocated space outside of it, (perhaps) move the extended partition to the right so that the unallocated space is on the left and next to the Windows partition, then extend the Windows partition into the unallocated space.  Just note that the \"left and right\" directions will only be correct if the Windows partition is immediately to the left of the extended partition (as I would expect).  If you can post a screenshot of Gparted's view of your disk, I'm sure that people will be able to give very specific advice.     \n", "Q: Incredibly bad M.2 SSD performance (HP OMEN with Samsung XP941) I have a new laptop (HP Omen) and have just, after great trials and tribulations, installed Kubuntu on it.

Ubuntu fall-back works due to the nomodeset kernel option. If you're going to install Ubuntu I recommend setting that flag for the LiveCD as well, because otherwise GParted and the installer take forever.\nOnce installed make sure you set the nomodeset option on boot, so that you can install the necessary software:\nThe problem was solved for me by installing the Intel/Nvidia drivers and enabling bumblebee/bbswitch. This way the Nvidia graphics card is disabled on boot, so that no conflict occurs. Optirun/primusrun still work without a conflict after removing the nomodeset option.\nOn an unrelated note: To make Wifi work on the laptop you need to blacklist the acer_wmi module.\n", "Q: ISO to MKV batch conversion for dummies I've tried finding a solution to my problem - unfortunately without luck.\nI've just installed Plex Media Server and are loving in! However, it can't play the 100 ISO-files with my DVD-movies that I ripped years ago. Is there any way to convert these ISO's to MKV in a batch - including the multiple languages and subtitles? I just want a 1:1 conversion of each ISO.\nI doesn't matter if it's going to be in Windows or Linux. I got both - but I'll need a step-by-step guide if it's going to be in Linux.\nI tried VidCoder for Windows, but unfortunately it won't transfer more than one language and no subtitles at all when batch-converting. :-/\n\nA: What happens if you mount the .iso file, and then open that as if it were an actual dvd disk? Would your player/server see it as a dvd video disk & play it?\nI haven't tried recently, but I think I remember the options...\n mount -o loop file.iso /mnt/point\n\nSee the man pages for mount & losetup for more info.\nWould be convenient to have some way to \"click to mount\" each .iso file, I'm not familiar with Plex but I think it's pretty flexible... Maybe a script or an action or something?\n\nA: Maybe HandBrake will work here? It can read ISOs, and will convert to MKV with audio and subs - and also has a batch mode.\n\nA: Both MakeMKV and ByteCopy work on Windows. I don't have a review on both but both are easy to use, you may google for the instructions. Handbrake is mainly designed for converting digital media files, it will not convert protected discs though. So Handbrake may not work well if your ISI's are still under commercial protection.\n", "Q: PC reboots randomly while powered on I have an old machine and a new machine, I just installed Lubuntu on the old one because I tried to transition from Lubuntu but Puppy Linux but went back right after because Puppy Linux wasn't suitable for me, even though it had no problem. Before installing Puppy Linux, Lubuntu ran with no problems, and before that I had to re-install Lubuntu because it kept prompting me and waiting for direct user input on boot to \"Press S to skip mounting or Press M for Manual recovery.\". And before that I had a Lubuntu-Zorin dual-boot, but the PC was too slow for Zorin, so I backed up and went fresh. Now, with the latest Iteration the PC reboots randomly as if the command \"Reboot\" was invoked at random, I think around 15 minutes of uptime, whether idle or active.

First, make all the directories:\nFILES=(source/image*.tiff)\nCOUNT=${#FILES[@]}\nDIR_NUM=$((COUNT / 7 + 1))\nseq 1 $DIR_NUM | xargs bash -c 'mkdir -p \"${@/#/target-}\"'\n\nrename -n 's;source/image(\\d+)\\.tiff$;\"target-\".int($1 / 7 - 1).\"/image\".$1.\".tiff\";e' source/image*.tiff\n\nIn fact, we could apply the first four lines to all solutions here, and skip the repeated mkdir -p.\n\nA: sevenfile=0\nnewdir=1\nfor file in \"$(ls -bv /path/to/source/image*.tiff)\"; do\n    mkdir -p \"$newdir\" && mv \"$file\" \"$newdir\" \n    [[ ++sevenfile -eq 7 ]] && sevenfile=0 &&  ((newdir++))\ndone\n\n\n*\n\n*ls -v command sorts the files as natural sort of (version) numbers. You can parse the ls command in this your case, because all the files are specific and only are image*.tiff.\n\n\n*mkdir -p $newdir crates the directory based on newdir variable.\n\n\n*mv \"$file\" \"$newdir\" moves the file to directory which newdir specifies.\n\n\n*Reset the sevenfile=0 to zero when 7 files has been moved ([[ ++sevenfile -eq 7 ]]) and increment to newdir value.\nNote that change /path/to/source/ to your actual source directory.\nIf you don't want parsing the ls command and if files name including spaces, newlines and etc:\nfind /path/to/source/ -type f -name 'image*.tiff' -print0 | \\\n     sort -z --version-sort | while IFS= read -d '' -r file; do \\\n     mkdir -p \"$newdir\" && mv \"$file\" \"$newdir\" ;\n     [[ ++sevenfile -eq 7 ]] && sevenfile=0 &&  ((newdir++));\ndone\n\n\nA: #!/usr/bin/perl\n\nopen(F,\"-|\",\"ls source/*\") or die;\n\nwhile(<F>){ chomp;\n  if(/(\\d+).tiff/){\n     $dir= \"target-\" . (1+int($1/7));\n     mkdir($dir) unless -d $dir;\n     system \"mv $_ $dir\";\n  }\n}\n\n\nA: You can use xargs (-n or --max-args) to set the number of files to move, but keep in mind that arguments is limited to ARG_MAX.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nimages=\"./source/image*.tiff\"\ntarget=\"./target\"\n\nls -v $images | xargs -n 7 | while read -a files; do mkdir $target/$((++n)) && mv -t $target/$n ${files[@]}; done\n\n", "Q: How to download a certain version of a package? I tried sudo apt-get install package-name=1.23, but apparently it is not available for this version of Ubuntu...?\nI get:\nE: Version '1.23 for package-name' was not found.\n\nDo I need a command line option to force it to install this version?\nUbuntu 14.04.1 LTS\n\nA: Graphical method:\nUsing Synaptic, select the package you want to install, then select Package → Force version from the menu; the shortcut binding \"Ctrl+E\" will also work. In the newly opened window, choose the version you wish to install and apply the changes from the main window.\nIf the version you wish to install does not appear in the list, update the package database and try again. If you are installing a version from a PPA, make sure the package index successfully updates the index for the PPA.\nCommand-line method:\nThe command you used seemed to have correct syntax. However, it is most likely that the version you type is either incorrect or incomplete. You might be missing a revision number: for example, for a version x.y.z-r, the r would be the revision number, preceded by a dash. Sometimes this revision number has the name \"ubuntu\" in the middle, depending on the package you install. In this case, the version you want to install might be called \"1.23-1\" or \"1.23-1ubuntu0\" or something around that, although the version would be commonly referred to as 1.23.\nTo find the correct version number, you can use aptitude versions package-name in a terminal. It will print out all available versions for the package, mention its status (eg. i for installed, p for available in the repositories). Then you can look for the version you are looking for and use it in your command instead of 1.23.\n", "Q: Toggling touch sensitivity for WACOM CTH-300 Bamboo Pad Under Ubuntu 14.10, I am having trouble configuring a wireless WACOM CTH-300 Bamboo Pad to toggle touch sensitivity on and off. At this point, the pen and tablet work as expected (mouse movement, pressure sensitivity, etc), and touch sensitivity is enabled as well (both single and multi-finger gestures work as expected). \nHowever, upon running xsetwacom --list devices in a terminal, the following is returned:\nWacom Co.,Ltd. Bamboo Pad, wireless stylus  id: 12  type: STYLUS    \nWacom Co.,Ltd. Bamboo Pad, wireless eraser  id: 16  type: ERASER    \nWacom Co.,Ltd. Bamboo Pad, wireless pad id: 17  type: PAD\n\n...and nothing is stated about a TOUCH device. All of the previous answers I have stumbled upon suggest some sequence of xsetwacom commands to turn the TOUCH option off, but I do not know where to begin when that option isn't even listed.\nI am worried that my extensive hacking and package-installing to get the product fully functional in the first place is the cause of this current weird behavior. The WACOM tab in System Settings still states that no tablet is detected.\nIs there any reliable way to toggle touch sensitivity on and off for this product? I plan to have the functionality turned on and off frequently. \n\nA: Try using\nxsetwacom --set \"device name\" Gesture off        # disable multitouch gestures or\n\nxsetwacom --set \"device name\" Touch off          # disable touch\n\n", "Q: Why do I get \"Directory not empty\" when I try to remove an empty directory? I have this empty directory, but I keep getting the following error message:\nCannot remove test: Directory not empty\n\nI know this question has been asked plenty of times but none of them helped.\nI tried ls -la to make sure there were no hidden files, and there does not seem to be: \n\nI tried sudo rmdir test as well as sudo rm -rf test, and I just do not know what is wrong.\nI read it might be a problem with the file system, but I have no idea how I would go about fixing that.\n\nA: I had the same issue not able to remove directory as it is not empty.\nThis sequence of operations worked for me. \n\n\n*\n\n*From command line first \nsudo rmdir  --ignore-fail-on-non-empty folder-name-to-be-deleted\n\nThe above command helps ubuntu ignore directory is not empty.\n\n\n*Then just go to the folder and Shift + Del. That is all. \n\n\nA: I had the same problem on a external hard disk, I tried so many ways using command line, but I failed every time. \nThat's what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on folder\n\n*Move to trash\n\n*Empty trash\n\n\nYes, it's silly but it worked for me (I don't really know how and why, but the damned folder no longer exist)\n\nA: You could delete it by typing sudo rm -rf {dir_name}. The directory might have been set to read-only permission. I hope the given command can delete the folder.\n\nA: If the directory is part of a filesystem mounted with CIFS (aka samba), and it contains a file that is a broken symbolic link, then ls fails to mention that file.  (I observe this bug on a CIFS client running 14.04.2 LTS, and a server running 12.04.5 LTS.)\nSo the directory is not empty, but (over CIFS) you have no way to see that.  The file can only be seen, and thus can only be deleted, by a command running on the fileserver hosting that filesystem.\n\nA: If you are using btrfs, it is possibly an empty directory with a non-zero i_size. You can check whether this is the case with:\nstat -c %s test\n\nThe i_size of an empty folder in btrfs should be zero. In my case, I got 6160 with ~/.config/chromium/Default.\nThe suggested solution is to unmount the filesystem, run btrfs check to confirm the issue and check for other problematic directories, and finally run btrfs check --repair to fix. This operation is risky, though, so it's a good idea to backup files first.\nSource: Btrfs Problem FAQ\n\nA: GUI solution\n\n\n*\n\n*Move or cut & paste the folder to trash folder\n\n*empty the trash \n\n\nit is done.\nCommand-line solution\nsudo mv folder_error/ .local/share/Trash\n\nyou can clear with trash-cli: trash-empty\nor\nsudo rm -fr ~/.local/share/Trash/*\n\n\nA: try this command:\nsudo lsof | grep deleted \n\nCheck in the list if your directory is still in use. :D\nIf so, stop the service and you will be able delete the directory.\n\nA: I have win 10 + ubuntu dual system installed. And both systems share the windows parititions.\nRecently, i also ran into unable to delete empty folders in those partitions under ubuntu. I can't find out solution to solve it under linux.\nHowever, after i switch to windows, and run\nchkdsk\n\nvia cmd for the target disk. Some errors checked out.\nand then i run \nchkdsk /F\n\nto fix disk error.\nAfter it finish, i am able to delete those folders now.\n\nA: This problem appears when those folders or files are not copied completely. It's Input/Output Error. I tried to delete with Shift+Del or through commands, but these did not work. I tried right click and \"Move to Trash\" and it worked.\n\nA: I had the same issue on Ubuntu 16.04 and I fixed it by:\n\n\n*\n\n*emptying the trash folder\n\n*rebooting\n\n\nOpening and closing the file manager did no good—only rebooting worked.\n\nA: Check if directory is not active for any running application before deleting. I was unable to delete a directory with same message, I found out the reason was that the directory was open in an node.js application. After closing/exiting the application I was able to delete the folder.\n\nA: In my case, I had a separate command that ran concurrently and added  files while the delete was ongoing; likely rm finished deleting everything it had planned to delete, then tried to delete the folder at the end, saw it had contents, and then threw an error saying 'yo, something is not right'.\n(It had to do with running code in serial vs. accidentally in parallel for me.)\nYou may consider this if you're dealing with this problem.\n\nA: I ran into this issue and found that the solution was quite simple for me.\nI had a Node server running that periodically accessed the files in the folder I was trying to remove. This caused several small meta files to constantly exist inside the folder. The purpose of these files is beyond me.\nEven rm -rf folder/* would not remove these files permanently, despite showing the message removed folder/file.xyz.\nI suspected the server, shut it down and removed the files and the folder without fail.\n\nA: Maybe the directory or a file in it has an immutable bit set?\nroot@lina:~# mkdir test\nroot@lina:~# chattr +i test\nroot@lina:~# rmdir test\nrmdir: konnte 'test' nicht entfernen: Die Operation ist nicht erlaubt\nroot@lina:~# lsattr -d test\n----i---------e---- test\nroot@lina:~# chattr -i test\nroot@lina:~# rmdir test\n\nthen you should remove the immutable bit with ''chattr -i'' first.\n\nA: you may use rm command recursive flag i.e.\nrm -r folder/\nExample\n\nA: From the rm manual\n       -d, --dir\n              remove empty directories\n\nSo, to extend your example, try removing the directory with rm -drf test/\n\nA: I solved a similar problem:\nThe actual error I got is:\nfind: cannot delete ‘/home/lucid/x/SecurityCameras/B-Yard’: Directory not empty\n\nThe command I used was:\nfind /home/lucid/x/SecurityCameras/B-Yard -mtime +15 -delete\n\nThe directory inside /home/lucid/x/SecurityCameras/B-Yard is 2021, which is put there by the camera.\nDeleting OR renaming the directory to something else and then back to 2021 FIXED the problem. Renaming and back again for B-Yard didn't do anything.\nSo just renaming the offending directory to something else, and then back to the original name fixes the problem. No need to delete anything.\n", "Q: use ubuntu with amd sempron processor i have a machine with an AMD Sempron Processor, 4gb ram and 500gb of hard disk. i could never use ubuntu 14.04 or 14.10 with an AMD processor. it gets stuck and no found. There is something i can do?\n\nA: I believe the CPU in my aging entertainment center PC is a Sempron atop a Biostar motherboard.  I suspect it is older than yours, but you have not said.  I have booted that computer to several generations of Ubuntu on CDrom and installed Ubuntu versions as old as version 8.10 onto hard drives inserted into its removable IDE hard drive tray system.  About the only thing that computer won't do, unfortunately, is to boot to USB drives, which is my latest hobby, which explains why I've not used that computer much for a while.\nI suspect if yours is refusing to boot to a CD/DVD the issue could well be a dirty lens.

I have previously installed Ubuntu 14 in my desktop along with Windows 7. I thought it might be the reason for my pc to get slower. I am planning to install Ubuntu in my laptop so I am asking.\n\nA: Dual booting would not make your computer slower theoritically. \nA computer gets slow if too many processes run at the same time. It has mostly nothing to do with hard disk data. \n\nA: Actually, theoretically speaking, a dual boot installation has the potential to make a computer behave faster than it would if either booted installation commanded the entire hard drive alone.  The reason is that because in a dual boot involving only one hard drive, the heads only need to track half (or whatever fraction) as far.\nTheories aside, in my experience the introduction of Linux only appears to slow a computer when the condition that led its owner to try Ubuntu in the first place, often a dying hard drive, continues to get worse.

The easiest way to do that is to type sudo in front of the commands which require root privileges. For example, to install gnome-terminal, the command would be sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal; you will then need to type your password before the command runs. You should use sudo for the update and upgrade commands as well, since they all require root privileges. \nTo install any package, you should use the command sudo apt-get install <package-name>, replacing <package-name> by the actual name of the package you wish to install.

You probably have a setting in ~/.bashrc that intentionally hides all commands prepending with a space from history. To change this behaviour in the future, you can edit ~/.bashrc.

It stayed in purple screen with Ubuntu logo! What can I do?\n\nA: There is a way to apply the full update to Ubuntu: When you restart your computer and you think the booting process is done, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. You will be prompted for your username in text mode.\nLog in with your username and password and make sure you have an Internet connection (e.g. ping google.com). If your WiFi isn't working, connect your computer to the router using an ethernet cable.\nYou can then simply type sudo apt-get update and your machine will download and install the missing packages. Restart your computer with sudo shutdown -r now and after rebooting, Gnome should be working just fine.\n\nA: After installing Gnome, try to purge the default settings using this command : \nsudo apt-get purge ubuntu-default-settings\n\nIf the problem persists, remove the unwanted packages from Ubuntu using the below command and check:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n", "Q: No boot menu after xubuntu install Hello I am trying to install xubuntu 14.10 Ive tried also ubuntu,kubuntu...

If it's ATI or Nvidia you can use one of the nomodeset boot options. You can look them up, they might vary from computer to computer, or by OS. \nBasicly you would type a command before you install xubuntu with the live cd. With that you can bypass what's causing the error just enough for you to update drivers or what have you. If your computer is 64 bit and you installed 64bit xubuntu, try 32 bit instead it might work for you. \n", "Q: Mount qcow2 image using qemu-nbd within a container I'm trying to get an OpenStack Nova compute node running within a container to boot a server in a nested container.\nEverything works fine until I ask Nova in the controller to boot the server. During the server boot process in the compute container, libvirt uses qemu-nbd to export the qcow2 disk image downloaded from OpenStack Glance as a previous step to launching the nested container. With the default lxc configuration qemu-nbd fails.\nI've worked out the lxc.conf file to allow using qemu-nbd from within the container, but I must be missing something because even if the container activates the node /dev/nbd0 I can't see the /dev/nbd0p1 entry corresponding to the partition in the qcow2 disk image.\nHere's the lxc.conf file for my Nova container:\n# Template used to create this container: /usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-download\n# Parameters passed to the template: -d ubuntu -r trusty -a i386\n# For additional config options, please look at lxc.container.conf(5)\n\n# Distribution configuration\nlxc.include = /usr/share/lxc/config/ubuntu.common.conf\nlxc.arch = x86\n\n# Container specific configuration\nlxc.rootfs = /var/lib/lxc/compute/rootfs\nlxc.utsname = compute\n\n# Network configuration\nlxc.network.type = veth\nlxc.network.flags = up\nlxc.network.link = lxcbr0\nlxc.network.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:90:16:e0\n\nlxc.network.type = veth\nlxc.network.flags = up\nlxc.network.link = br0.1000\nlxc.network.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:90:16:e1\n\n# This is the public interface\nlxc.network.type = veth\nlxc.network.flags = up\nlxc.network.link = br0.2000\nlxc.network.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:90:16:e2\n\n# Added so certain functions (iptables, nova-compute, ...) work\nlxc.mount.entry = /lib/modules/3.13.0-43-generic     /var/lib/lxc/compute/rootfs/lib/modules/3.13.0-43-generic none ro,bind 0 0\n\n# Added so the compute node can run LXC VMs\nlxc.mount.auto = cgroup\nlxc.aa_profile = lxc-container-default-with-nesting\n\n# Allow the container to mknod (needed by qemu-nbd...)\nlxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c *:* m\nlxc.cgroup.devices.allow = b *:* m\n\n# Allow the container to use the host's nbd devices\nlxc.cgroup.devices.allow = b 43:* rwm # Every nbd device in the host\n\nIt can be verified easily on the command line.

After some digging, I came across the solution presented here, which essentially advised me to compile git against OpenSSL instead of GNUTLS.  I did so, and all was right with the world.\nI have just encountered the same error again. I went back to check my control file, and GNUTLS is nowhere to be found (I had replaced such instances with OpenSSL as prescribed).  Can anyone advise me on where to look for the call that still seeks to use GNUTLS instead of OpenSSL? Is something else going on here?\nI should also note that while inspecting my OpenSSL install, I received a warning suggesting that my config file could not be opened.  This is presumably because the path cited does not exist.  I have never called OpenSSL directly before (as may be obvious, I am quite ignorant in this area), so I cannot speak to whether or not this issue correlates with the GNUTLS business.  If you think it is related, and/or just feel like sharing which environmental variable (I presume) must be modified so that OpenSSL can find the config file, please enlighten me.\nNOTE: This appears to be a Github related issue, insofar as I was able to commit just fine. The log files serve as evidence of that, and there was no error. This fits with my intuition since the commit is local and would therefore have no need to deal with the capabilities of GNUTLS and OpenSSL to the best of my knowledge.  Nevertheless, feel free to adjust my worldview.\n\nA: Evidently, it had nothing to do with what I was doing.  I tried it again a while later and Github gave me no beef.  In other words, there was a temporary issue with Github.\n", "Q: Firefox Java plugin (icedtea) is installed, what prevents it from being loaded? After upgrading my Ubuntu installation (now running 14.04 LTS) my java plugin for firefox ceased to work. It does not report an error or anything it just tells me that I need to install a plugin to run that content.\nI tried all the tricks I found on google, like purge and reinstall icedtea, the jdk etc. bu without success. Eventually I renamed my ~/.mozilla directory so that I start with a fresh user configuration and that worked!.\nHowever I don't want to loose all my bookmarks etc. How can I figure out what in my user settings prevents the icedtea plugin to be loaded?\nI tried to just search through about:config for java and found plugin.state.java=1 but according to google that means \"always ask before running that plugin\" which would be fine.\n\nA: Why rename your .mozilla folder?\nOn Debian (Ubuntu and derivatives are based Debian), you will need to open a shell or terminal as root (elevate with sudo -s or use su). From there, do apt-get update to ensure you have a complete, current package list.\nOn Debian 8, I simply did: apt-get install default-jre icedtea-plugin. If Ubuntu has differing names for its packages, simply do aptitude search icedtea, etc. and request the packages that match your criteria instead.\nOnce the packages are installed, open Firefox. Open the Add-ons Manager. Go to Plugins, and change IcedTea (or Java) to \"Ask to activate\" or \"Activate\" to make the plugin active. The next time a site requests this plugin, you should see a plugin/lego badge and/or a popup asking to confirm it, depending on your plugin preferences.\nIf doing that still doesn't solve things, then first make sure you've synced your Firefox data, and reset Firefox. Then, remove and reinstall the above packages, and clear out your .mozilla, .firefox, and other related folders in your home folder (use Ctrl-H in Gtk filers or just to rm -rf .mozilla, etc. in a shell. Try again.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then you will have to do whereis firefox, (the folder should be in /usr/lib, /usr/share, or /lib), and manually install the Java plugins yourself (guides are available elsewhere on the web for this). While it isn't recommended, if your system (browser) isn't seeing the plugins any other way, you'll have to do this.\nGood luck; this should work, if not come close to solving your problem.\n", "Q: Make LAMP Server public I installed a LAMP server in my computer to try some php and html scripts and I want to know if I can make those files public so I can see them from other computer with other internet conection. How can I do it?\n\nA: A few steps to follow in order to be sure:\nCheck IP on the server machine, look for the adapter that connects the machine to the internet (eth0 will probably be the one, albeit it sure can be ethX depending on your configuration)\nsudo ifconfig    \n\nTry pinging the IP you found out via ifconfig. Be sure that you are pinging from a computer who is not in the same network as your server, just to be sure. \nping XYZ    \n\nYou didn't get a ping?\nI suppose you are connecting your server machine via your home router. Meaning you have to configure it to forward the port you set your apache at. Or just enable your local server as DMZ (which I can tell is not a safe thing to do, but works adhoc). \nSadly port forwarding looks different for each router, you need to find out how to do that for your specific hardware.\nYou got a ping? You are ready to go\nGetting a ping back means your machine has public IP and is visible over the internet. LAMP apache doesn't require any configuration to work as you wish it to. Just enter the server IP into your browser, perhaps add a port if you set up apache on a different one than 80, eg.:\nhttp://XYZ:8080/\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu stuck with old monitor's max resolution?

I want to extract network statistics of past two weeks. It should contain information like the uploads and downloads, also the network speed (bandwith ) I received. \nI tried system monitor, but unfortunately, it just shows in realtime and clears up the log after shutdown. I also tried going through /var/log/ but I'm clueless as to in which file is the network statistics for past week would be stored.\n(PS: I know this is unusual. Read the full story if you're interested. I use vodafone's 3G dongle. I activated some extra plans on my a/c and never recieved an activation sms. Neither was I able to use the pack at boosted speed (for which I paid).  I am tired of talking to my service providers and they claim I the pack was activated when in fact I did not received a confirmation SMS or an increased speed (which happens after you activate a booster pack after consuming your basic plan ).   The softwares they use seem to be shit. I need to send this info to them or contact consumer forum to file a complaint against service providers. )\n\nA: Firstly, let me dissect your analysis.\n\n\"they [The ISPs] claim I am getting good speed\"...\n\nWhat they claim is based on your up/down speed you pay for and their tests from their equipment to your modem in all likelihood.  Their test is likely right - the speed at your modem is okay - but the issue might lie behind that, such as your router not operating efficiently or something.  It could also be your computer isn't functioning as it should be or has something running that eats your system resources.\n\n... \"when in fact I am not\"\n\nBasis for analysis?  Have you removed your router from the equation and hooked your internet right up to your computer over the ethernet connection?  If you have and you're still getting crap speeds, next thing to check is your computer. And run the same test via another computer if you can.\nAlso, your internet service providers are not required to guarantee you your advertised speeds.  I have a 105 Mbps downspeed connection from Comcast here, and I get about 85 Mbps on an average day, likely due to data usage and congestion on the line from the other Comcast users in the area all on at once.\n\nNow onto your issues.  I don't know of any log system that actually logs by-the-minute network connection speeds, because it's likely that they don't exist.  Such logs would be on a network level at your router, if anywhere, or would overload your computer.\nI use vnstat to get at-a-glance data in/out statistics, such as daily / monthly usage, however that won't help you get your per-upload, per-download, and total bandwidth speeds.  What you'd be seeking there is something such as speedtest.net's speed testing tool, which I would recommend you run on the internet connection itself, without a router present and the computer hooked right in.\nAgain, though, your ISP may advertise one speed, but that's never a guaranteed speed.\nntop is also a possible alternative to use, it runs as a system daemon and you can access a web-based interface to see pretty graphics and statistics.  However, it might not be the statistics you are fully after.\n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ntop\nNtop will run in background as a service.

While using my laptop today for a span of 20 minutes I encountered a problem. My laptop suddenly froze. I was listening to music when the screen froze but the music was still playing. I've only recently installed ubuntu (two hours ago).\nThe issue is not overheating, it was at 50Celcius at the time it froze and my CPU was only at 10% on each core.

As the xorg.edgers group ask not to give installation instructions directly without linking to their page, this is the best I can do.\nIf you don't know what a PPA is or don't know how to choose different drivers or need some guidance after reading their page, leave a comment below.\n", "Q: flashplayer on Lubuntu 12.04 I have a very old computer which is running Lubuntu 12.04. I don't think it can be upgraded to 14.04 as it is non-pae. The Lubuntu software center does not provide any Adobe Flash Player installation. I have downloaded the flash-plugin 11.2.202.425 release.i386.rpm.\nPlease excuse my ignorance; but how do I install it from there?\n\nA: You cannot install rpm. This is package for another distribution (Fedora, RHEL and its derivates). You can try this HOWTO on webupd8 or you can try installing flash player from repository - open terminal and run this command:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\nIt will update your package database and installs package named flashplugin-installer if it is present in your repositories.\n\nA: \nI have downloaded the flash-plugin 11.2.202.425 release.i386.rpm. Please excuse my ignorance; but how do I install it from there?\n\nYou do not; well it is possible with the \"alien\" tool to convert it into a .DEB file but that file is intended for Redhat and/or CentOS. \nYou need to find either a file ending on .DEB or .tar.gz. From the package list I believe you need this (edit: byran has a good option too).\n\nI don't think it can be upgraded to 14.04 as it is non-pae\n\nYou probably can; you need to download the ubuntu-14.04-desktop-i386.iso version from the download site.

It is the supported format for your system.\nAlso note that Lubuntu uses the same repositories as Ubuntu, so you can install from official Ubuntu repositories, as well.

When plugging in my phone, I immediately get\n\nUnable to mount SAMSUNG Android  Unable to open MTP device\n  '[usb:003,007]'\n\nI was able to read my phone with no issue whatsoever in Xubuntu.  I just discovered this one today; I've been hesitant to plug my phone into this installation because of the read only file system issues I've been having, but I plugged it in out of habit a little while ago, and this is something new.  \nAnother post on here said the issue is fixed by changing cables; I have tried 3, all of which work just fine on windows, and one of which is the one that was working fine with Xubuntu. And yes, the phone is in USB debug mode. Any hints on where to start to fix this would be appreciated.\nSpecifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\n\n*Linux 3.13.0-43-generic (x86_64) \n\n*mobo: M4A89GTD-PRO \n\n*BIOS: 2101 \n\n*CPU: AMD Athlon(tm) II X4 645 Processor \n\n*RAM: 6111188 kB \n\n*HDD: ATA OCZ-VERTEX3 \n\n*GPU: GeForce GT 440 \n\n*Mouse / keyboard: M510, K350 single unifying receiver \n\n\nedit - I have tried several different galaxy S4 phones (My employer provides cells to all engineers / managers) and the same error appears on all of them.

These phones are running Ice Cream, Jelly, and KKat - no difference at all.  Have also tried multiple cables and multiple USB ports.\nEdit: - I tried downloading the latest libmtp (1.1.7) but to no avail.  mtp-detect says it is unable to open ~/.mtpz-data for reading, MTPZ disabled.  Plugging in the phone still pops up:\n\nUnable to mount SAMSUNG Android\n  Unable to open MTP device '[usb:003,007]'\n\nonly the final number (007) appears to be a counter; over the long weekend I apparently tried 149 different times to get this to work.\nThis was not an issue at all in 12.04.\nEdit 2:  I spent countless hours over the past weekend banging away trying to get this to work.

Obviously, something was changed somewhere in 14.04.  I found a huge number of posts from Google about this; it is a very prevalent issue.  Why did Ubuntu choose to deploy 14.04 with so many things broken that used to work just fine? \nEdit 3:  Just had a thought... since Ubuntu has so many issues with 'read only' file system creation on USB devices, is there a connection with this issue?\n** Edit 4:**  Just on a lark, I decided to try plugging in to each and every USB port on the machine.  \"Unable to open MTP device '[usb:003,007]'\" still appears on every one, but the numeric values are different - just wanted to ensure I ruled out a bad USB port.\nEdit 5:  This Friday will be 30 days since installing 14.04.  Does anybody please have any ideas as to what is causing this?  If I cannot get viable solutions to a majority of the issues I'm having by Friday, then this weekend will be spent wiping 14.04 and going back to Win 7.  I think devoting countless hours to 14.04 over the course of a month is more than enough time to try and get it working.  As it stands now, I still have not risked installing any software beyond what is installed with the ISO that I downloaded.

I have tried to do this but it always seems to fail, for example I follow the instructions (http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd) but firstly /dev/sd does not seem to exist for me. So from looking at gparted I use \nsudo mount /dev/mapper/isw_ciehbafdfa_Volume0p1 /mnt\n\nor /mnt/boot\nthen the following issues a problem \nmint@mint ~ $ sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/mapper/isw_ciehbafdfa_Volume0p1 \ngrub-probe: error: failed to get canonical path of `/cow'.\nInstalling for i386-pc platform.\ngrub-install.real: warning: File system `ext2' doesn't support embedding.\ngrub-install.real: warning: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can only be installed in this setup by using blocklists.  However, blocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged..\ngrub-install.real: error: will not proceed with blocklists.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is the solution to your problem, but I had a similar issue two months ago when I replaced Arch with Ubuntu.

Apparently Ubuntu's official website (which is where I initially went) chose the server for me because it's closest to me.\nIs this a reliable server? Should I download from http://releases.ubuntu.com instead? Am I doing something wrong? Should I just download the file again?\n\nA: I'd use the torrent to download the iso. The torrent clinet should do it's own verification too, and the iso should match the MD5 when it's done, and torrent's often faster.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads\n\nA: When the md5 do not match you either got a bad (can happen) or a tainted (would be serously wrong) download and need to re-download the ISO.\nI would always download from http://releases.ubuntu.com/ myself but it might be worth an attempt to redownload from excellmedia and see if you get the same hash from their file (if 2 times the same md5 I would assume it is not a bad download). Maybe they got a corrupted ISO and if that is the case I assume they would want to know about it. \n", "Q: Need to create NTFS partition on my hard drive but mount point \"/\" is stopping me Okay, I'm not very good with computers. I got ubuntu a few weeks ago, after having windows which was becoming rubbish so I deleted it. Since then, I've found it hard to get around using some programs without windows, and I'm not a big fan of wine. Got the bootable dvd for windows but when installing it, it says I can't as I don't have a partition with NTFS formatting. Followed this thread https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition/CreatingPartitions but was unsuccessful, because in this thread they used an unformatted hard drive. Tried to unmount mine, but can't because the mount point has an \"/\" there. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated! \n\nA: Basically, you cannot unmount the root partition while you are using it. You will have to shut down your system and boot from another media like a USB stick or a CD and get into live mode to modify partitions on your HDD.\nFrom my experience the best solution for this kind of problem - if you need to run some Windows program alongside Linux - is to use a virtual machine and Windows install there . It is much safer and easier.\nHere, I suggest you to install Oracle VirtualBox. It's a well known multi-platform Virtual Machine program.\n\nA: Use Gparted from live CD and then \n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount as u were saying becoz u cannot unmount the disk from which you are using currently so you have unmount from Gparted bootable pendrive\n\n*or you change the partition as you want.\n\n*Kindly notify me if you face any more problem\n", "Q: How to change launcher icons according to Numix theme?

(with cowsay).\nI think all commands added to .bashrc will run only when I open a terminal, not when computer boots up, right? And I'm sure my session is not saved.\nAnyone knows why? Thanks for reading, have a good day.\n\nA: Put it into .bash_profile \nit is used for login shells, .bashrc is used more widely, eg also if you use scp from another machine, and, if you generate output in the .bashrc file, any scp and other will fail silently. they don't expect any output. .bash_profile would be only executed on login shells, eg virtual terminal, xterm,..... \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 PPC live DVD/USB?

Thanks to right-click and open with... option, I can see all the installed programs and use them, but there is no terminal. \nHow could I fix it? \nThanks! :)\n\nA: Ctrl-Alt T  should pop up a terminal, or you could switch to a virtual term with Ctrl-Alt-F2. .  What you are seeing may possibly be fixed by renaming the .config file in your home directory (to force a new one to be made).

Sometimes when I install Python packages, I use pip, sometimes apt-get and sometimes Synaptic. It generally depends on instructions I happen to be following or if I just see something that looks interesting.\nDo I have to worry about these three different managers conflicting with each other? For instance, I'm fairly certain that Synaptic is just a gui for apt-get, so those two methods should never cause problems for each other. But what about pip? If I install something with pip, will apt-get & Synaptic know that package is there? Or, vice-versa?\n\nA: The are all front ends for apt\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/Apt\napt-get is a command line tool, synaptic is a nice tool but somewhat depreciated by software center.\nI am not familiar with pip.\nSee also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware\nAs far as I know you can use apt, apt-get, aptitude, synaptic, software center, etc without any problems.\n", "Q: will the applications of lower version of ubuntu work on higher one I am using ubuntu 14.04lts, not many applications are there for this.

Yes, it will work for a lot of software. But if you do this with something that has a lot of dependencies you will pull those in too. And if it has a library installation might fail. \nIt works best if you can find a personal archive (that way you can supply the Ubuntu version yourself).\n\nPlease also recommend me some trusted website for getting applications for ubuntu 14.04 other than their official website, where only few are there in ubuntu 14.04 section.\n\nThere is just one: getdeb.

You may need to hold shift after the BIOS splash to show the GRUB menu.  Press 'e' to edit the boot parameters followed by 'end' to move to the end of the line.  Replace 'quiet splash' with 'verbose' or if you want even more info 'debug'.\nTry disabling KMS by adding 'nomodeset'.  Also 'noacpi' can sometimes help.  Although the nouveau drivers have come a long way in recent years, you may still want to install the latest nvidia drivers from the repo with 'sudo ubuntu-drivers devices' followed by 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-###' from the list.\n\nA: Saw a lot of \n intel ips 0000:00:1f.6: failed to disable graphis turbo\n\nerrors, if this is a desktop is there onboard video or a different video card to try? Maybe anything else that could be unplugged to try \"troubleshooting\" if it's incompatible hardware... \nMaybe just trying a different kernel would work... the one in Ubuntu 13.10 seemed ok but I don't think Ubuntu supports that version anymore. I'm not sure about how to change Ubuntu's kernel right now either, but a Debian Stable live ISO might work for testing an older one. I read that CrunchBang was based on Debian stable & it might use an older kernel for testing too.\nAnd some wifi messages too, but could be \"harmless\" Network Issues since Trusty\n", "Q: SQL Developer runs in Terminal with sudo sqldeveloper but not without sudo Can anyone help?\nInstalled like here:\nHow to install SQL Developer on Ubuntu 14.04?\nIf I run: \nsudo sqldeveloper\n\nit starts and runs properly but if I run:\nsqldeveloper\n\nIt wont start with any other error shown.\nAre there missing rights for Sqldeveloper or Java. Where and how do I set them.\nAny help appreciated, I am a Ubuntu noob.\nWhere do I find error logs?\nThank you...\n\nA: Likely what happened is you ran sqldeveloper one time using sudo, which caused the configuration directory $HOME/.sqldeveloper to get owned by root. If so, you should be able to fix it by re-taking ownership of the directory, i.e.\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.sqldeveloper\n\nor by simply deleting the directory\nrm -rf ~/.sqldeveloper\n\n\nA: If we need to run sqldeveloper without sudo we need to run command in terminal\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.sqldeveloper\n\n", "Q: New To Ubuntu; Have Reboot issues after Updates I am new to Linux.

And the windows recovery folder.\nDoes anyone know a really good file carving/recovering software?\nI'm having a hard time with my: WD my passport ultra external hard drive.\nMy wife has a plenty of important documents I need to get recovered.\nI got the images from the drive using Testdisk/Photorec with no problem at all. But the document's came up as .db files at most.\nI tried the Magicrescue software too and found a lot of files but there were .OLE files and corrupted and not readable documents with 21000 pages.\nI do not mind to pay a reasonable amount. It only needs to work on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04.01) because it is the only operating system we have.\nAnd is it true that only scanning a hard drive does affect the files?\nThe hard drive in the laptop is a SSD 128Gb and no results when I scan it in these programs. After installing Ubuntu, I have been forced to use it to get some things done.\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nA: I would advise, if possible, to work from a cloned image of the external drive using dd. This would greatly reduce any chance of further problems in using the drive itself.\nYou could also try Foremost. I've had some luck in recovering files with this software. It has similar features to Photorec.\n", "Q: Can I run Snappy Ubuntu Core as a guest inside Docker? I'm aware that Snappy Ubuntu can host Docker containers. My question is whether it can also be run inside a container, as a Docker guest.\nThe reason I'm asking is that I can't find any Snappy VM guest containers in the public Docker repository.\n\nA: Yes, you can: Snappy is just a stripped down version of Ubuntu, and Ubuntu works inside Docker. The fact that Snappy does not appear inside the public Docker repository implies that you have to do things manually.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, get the latest image:\nwget http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/preview/ubuntu-core-alpha-02_amd64-virt.img\n\nThis file is a QCOW2 image meant for QEMU/KVM, but we can extract its contents for Docker too.\n\n*In order to access the files inside a QCOW2 image, you'll need qemu-nbd, so install it and run:\nqemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 ubuntu-core-alpha-02_amd64-virt.img\n\nThis command will create a \"virtual disk\" named /dev/ndb0, with \"virtual partitions\" named /dev/ndb0pX. Use fdisk -l /dev/nbd0 to get an idea of what partitions are inside the QCOW2 image.\n\n*The partition you are interested in is /dev/ndb0p3, so mount it:\nmount /dev/ndb0p3 /somewhere\n\n\n*You are almost done! Just follow Docker's guide on custom base images:\ntar -C /somewhere -c . | docker import - snappy\n\nNow you are ready to create your Snappy images on top of that base image. For example, I created a snappy_test image with the xkcd-webserver app installed.

However, I'm not sure how I can fix this problem. I've gone into my computer's BIOS and there isn't any option that changes priority between UEFI and BIOS. The version of ubuntu I download is not super important, so it there's any other versions of ubuntu that would work, that is something I can consider. \nAn image I took of my bios menu that shows boot options is here: http://imgur.com/aBaZ0Xi\nThe black and gray items I cannot select, I can only change items in blue. \nOther threads that I've read on this seem to have very complex solutions that invole manually partitioning the hard drive. I'm not sure I'm comfortable doing that as a pretty novice linux user. Also, I can't seem to find a program called disk manager in windows..?\nAlternatively, I also happen to have a 1TB external hard drive with just pretty much a windows backup on it. Is it possible for me to partition that drive instead and install ubuntu on the external hard drive? If it is possible, how would I accomplish that? \nPicture with disk management on it: http://imgur.com/WEh7rhw\nUpdate: It turns out that my computer seems to have two separate pre-OS boot menus. One is F9 and lets you choose what to boot from (w/ options of efi file, DVD-ROM, or hard drive) and the other (F10) has the actual options to configure it. From the F9 menu, I booted the DVD with Ubuntu and it entered into a purple screen then booted into ubuntu with the installation menu. Great thing is, it managed to recognize windows 7! I don't know if this means it is in BIOs/legacy, but at least it works, kinda. However, navigating to the menu resulted in these options: \nThis computer currently has Windows 7 on it. What would you like to do?\n-Install Ubuntu inside Windows 7\n-Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu\n-(encrypt and LVM options are grayed out)\n-Something Else\nWhy would there not be a menu option to install Ubuntu alongside windows 7?\n\nA: I got an option to install alongside windows 7 when I was using 7. This is what i did. \nIn control panel I went to administrative tools. From there I selected computer management and then disk management (or something similar) \nWhen that loads it will show all partitions. Decide how big you want Ubuntu partition up be, and shrink your main partition. \nOnce it is shrunk, it will show as unallocated space. Leave it as it is. \nNow reboot and start install of ubuntu. You should now get a \"install alongside windows 7\" option. \nSelect that, install and Ubuntu will automatically install to the unallocated partition that was created in Windows. \n", "Q: Computer requirements for 64-bit version of Ubuntu I'm just downloading a 64-bit 14.04.1 LTS version of Ubuntu but I'm not sure if it will work good on my computer, I'd like to know what you think would it be better to install a 32-bit version or 64-bit?\nFrom System info (Hewlett-Packard laptop Pavilion G6):\nProcessor: Intel Pentium CPU B950 2.1GHz x 2.

I used the guide on the site but it does not include the new processors on the market just yet.\nThanks for any help you can provide!\n\nA: Usually, processors themselves never are the big deal when it comes to whether Linux can run on it. The most affected hardware parts are graphics cards/chips.\n\nThe Graphics you name work with the proprietary nVidia driver. To do this, open the Software & Updates utility, go to the Additional drivers tab and select nvidia-331 for your graphics card, then reboot.\nA faster option would be to run the command sudo apt-get install nvidia-common nvidia-331 from a terminal, then reboot. This also works, if you're unable to use Ubuntu with a graphical frontend due to a non-working driver. In this case, hit Ctrl+Alt+F1, log in and run the command.\n\nAnother problem you may encounter are wrong LAN/WiFi/BT drivers, which may result in slow internet connections. As you didn't name the Ethernet or WiFi chip in your question, you should best look at the chip manufacturer's website and look for Linux drivers, or ask another question here, if you don't find any information about it.\n\nOther than that, there often are only smaller problems, most of which can be resolved by the correct config or driver.

This gives me a Linux partition for my OpenSSH keys, and a FAT partition for my PuTTY keys.

The screen is a JVC 40\" HD LED LCD connected via HDMI.\nThe issues are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Catalyst thinks the display is a projector. Settings > Display says it's a 32\" DTV.\n\n*The display underscans, leaving a large black border. \n\n*The LCD TV has no over/under scan adjustment control, and the scaling option usually available in Catalyst is also missing. I suspect this is due to Catalyst thinking there's a projector hanging off the HDMI port.\n\n*Catalyst will not save the refresh rate, always coming up at 30hertz after a reboot. This causes screen flicker. The rate needs to be 50hertz or more, which I can set for the session, but as stated is lost on a reboot.\nI suspect these problems are all related to the mis-identification of the LED LCD screen as a projector.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: The following is a kludge, not a solution:\nAfter much stuffing about and scouring the web I continued to hit brickwalls. Some suggested using aticonfig. It had no effect in my case. I was using the xfce desktop.\nOut of frustration I installed Cinnamon. On booting into Cinnamon the display resolved itself, going full screen with no noticeable overscan or underscan. \nOddly, in cinnamon Catalyst saves the screen refresh rate. It did not in xfce.\nI have no idea why this worked, but if you're frustrated by the useless Catalyst CC, maybe try another desktop.\n\nA: I had an underscanning issue (big black borders), although all of the information about my monitor was displayed correctly.

GPartEd can format the drive to be one 160GB FAT32 partition. If you want to keep that Linux Swap partition, create two partitions.\nI don't think FAT32 is a good format for sharing data, because it has a hard file-size limit of 4GB.

No, performance of your laptop will not decrease, unless you will make weird partioning by yourself.\nPersonally, I prefer to give Windows as much space as possible, since it has a bigger appetite for resources.

How to run it after logging into my system?\n\nA: Use ~/.ssh/config:\nAdd a host:\nHost y\n  HostName domain.com\n  Port 666\n  User username\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa-domain\n\nAnd then access your host from a terminal:\nssh y\n\nAlso, you can create a shortcut to your terminal that opens a ssh session right away. Save this to a y.desktop file and place it in your ~/Desktop folder:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=domain.com\nExec=gnome-terminal -e \"bash -c 'ssh y'\"\nIcon=utilities-terminal\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Application;\n\nSure, there are number of ways on how you can bind a shortcut to some actions. The simplest in Unity is to use it's own settings: System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts. You can bind one to execute ssh y.\n", "Q: Steam not opening after half installation on Ubuntu 14.04 Steam not opening after half installation on Ubuntu 14.04, i have installed the steam using command below \nsudo apt-get install steam -y \nit ran and completed and when i go to unity do a search for steam and click on it, nothing happens, it doesn't open at all, tried reinstalling through software center, synaptic package manager, downloaded the deb from steam website using dpkg, same results. checked out this forum for further solutions and shows many had the same problem and not a single quick fix, the best one suggest was install steam before installing the proprietary drivers for either AMD or Nvidia, but i have done the latter long back and for trying that out, i reloaded ubuntu 14 on Virtual box, first updated it with \nsudo apt-get update, \nsudo apt-get upgrade\nthen sudo apt-get install steam -y\nSteam was installed successfully and i configured it then i installed the AMD propitiatory driver which was needed for my processor AMD A4-4000, that too installed, did a reboot, but seems the driver was not installed and it remained in the same 640X480 resolution, more over once entering the password the screen freezes and it stays forever and i cant do a thing, please help. \ni don’t want to try that in my PC and brick that too .... \nError when trying to open steam through Terminal\n$ steam\nRunning Steam on ubuntu 14.04 64-bit\nSTEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(0_client)\n/home/vipinven1987/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: line 755:  5474 Segmentation fault      $STEAM_DEBUGGER \"$STEAMROOT/$PLATFORM/$STEAMEXE\" \"$@\"\nUploading dump (out-of-process) [proxy '']\n/tmp/dumps/assert_20141231004040_1.dmp\nmv: cannot stat ‘/home/vipinven1987/.steam/registry.vdf’: No such file or directory\nInstalling bootstrap /home/vipinven1987/.local/share/Steam/bootstrap.tar.xz\nReset complete!\nRestarting Steam by request...\nRunning Steam on ubuntu 14.04 64-bit\nSTEAM_RUNTIME has been set by the user to: /home/vipinven1987/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(0_client)\nUploading dump (out-of-process) [proxy '']\n/tmp/dumps/crash_20141231004043_1.dmp\nFinished uploading minidump (out-of-process): success = no\nerror: libcurl.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n/home/vipinven1987/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: line 730:  5599 Segmentation fault      $STEAM_DEBUGGER \"$STEAMROOT/$STEAMEXEPATH\" \"$@\"\n\n\nA: I had the same error.\nThe following worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*removed the steam package again\nsudo apt-get purge steam\n\n\n*removed the proprietary AMD driver (fglrx) in the software center\n\n*installed the steam package again in terminal using\nsudo dpkg -i ./steam_latest.deb\n\n\n*started steam again in the terminal with command steam\nthe client started und upgraded itself\n\n*installed again the proprietary AMD driver.

Downloading packages at install time reduces the size of the install CD to approximately 5 to 30MB depending on architecture (see below), as well as providing only the packages needed for installation. The download time savings achieved by using a Minimal CD can be significant, as only current packages are downloaded, so there is no need to upgrade packages immediately after installation. The Minimal CD uses a text-based installer like the Alternate CD, making the CD image as compact as possible.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\nNetinstall\nThe network installer lets you install Ubuntu over the network. This is useful, for example, if you have an old machine with a non-bootable CD-ROM or a computer that can’t run the graphical interface-based installer, either because they don’t meet the minimum requirements for the live CD/DVD or because they require extra configuration before the graphical desktop can be used, or if you want to install Ubuntu on a large number of computers at once.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads\nBin ISO\nThat would then just be the normal one (as far as I understood it)  \nI'd just go with the normal iso (:\n", "Q: How to see why a process call failed From python i make several subprocess.Popen calls, and some of them are failing?

If it is an error in the command, you can find out by replacing your command as in the below example:\ntest = subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"monkey\"], stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\nprint(test.stderr.read().decode(\"utf-8\"))\n\noutputs:\n/bin/bash: monkey: command not found\n\n", "Q: Directly booting to Ubuntu 14.04 without a Windows boot option I cannot see a way to boot to Windows after I installed Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit \nMy laptop is directly booting into Ubuntu.\nAny help on how to be able to be able to boot to Windows would be appreciated. \n\nA: Did you try updating the grub with sudo update-grub?

The connection is made with an HDMI to DVI cable (Laptop has the HDMI, Monitor the DVI Port), the same setup worked without problems when I had Win7 installed. My laptop has a proper graphics card and the Intel HD Graphics on board stuff.\nWhen I just use the internal OR the external monitor, each of them is working perfectly. But if I use both of them, it doesn't. My laptop has a resolution of 1920*1080 and the external one has 1680*1050\nSo now to the actual problem: The main Monitor works fine (so if I use the internal as main, that one works fine, but the external doesn't, if I use the external monitor as main monitor, the internal breaks (so I guess it's a software/OS related problem and not a problem with the hardware of my external monitor)).\nThe problem is: Moving the mouse on the second monitor has extreme lags, but even worse the image doesn't begin at the border of the image, but somewhere in between, then a black gap and the other half of it. I know that sounds confusing, so here a few images, maybe they are better understandable.\nImages I don't have enough reputation for inline images yet :(\nAs you can see on the first and second, each of the monitors is working fine, when only one monitor is active.

Once I had done this i tried to reinstall but it failed. However I rebooted and tried the reinstall and it worked OK.

I don't see the point.\nI need to physically unplug the USB cable to stop it.  \nHow can I make a drive stop spinning when ejected?\nNow, something weird is happening, that might help :\nIf I plug this same USB 3.0 drive in a USB 2.0 port, it will properly shutdown and stop spinning when I \"remove safely\" the drive.\nThen when I plug it back to the usb 3.0 port, and try to \"remove safely\", it will... remount automatically! This is really weird, I don't get it.\nLast thing I noticed is that the command udisks --detach /dev/sdb does the trick. Why would \"remove safely\" not do it?\n\nA: AFAIK, \"Remove safely\" just unmounts the device, and removes it from udev. It doesn't send any command to the drive to shut down.\nOn the contrary, udisks --detatch does so: (udisks manpage)\n--detach device_file [--detach-options options]\n       Detaches (e.g. powering down the physical port the device is\n       connected to) the device represented by device_file using a\n       comma-separated list of options.\n\n", "Q: How can I display the list of available Wi-Fi networks?

In two different terminals, I do\nssh -X root@ip_i\nwhere i=1,2. One of them connects, the other fails with ssh: connect to host ip_2 port 22: Connection refused. How can I do this?\n\nA: The error message you get does not mean you cannot run two ssh clients at the same time. Rather what it means is that one of the two IP addresses you connect to is not running an ssh server.\nIf you were to start the two ssh clients in opposite order, you could expect the first to fail and the second to succeed.\nIf both IP addresses happen to be assigned to the same server, it may be that that particular server has sshd listening on only one of the two IP addresses. By default sshd will listen on all your IP addresses, but by using ListenAddress in /etc/ssh/sshd_config it is possible to restrict sshd to only listen on some of the available IPs.\nIf there happen to be a firewall or other middlebox between client and server, then there are no limits to how strange behavior a misconfiguration could cause.

Snaps are supported on all major Linux distros, including Ubuntu 14.04. The advantage of using the snap is that it is always up to date, will automatically update to new releases and is really easy to install the latest version of Remmina.\nInstall Remmina on Ubuntu 14.04\nsudo apt-get install snapd\nsudo snap install remmina\n\nIf you have on old version of Remmina installed via apt you can remove it as follows:\nsudo apt-get remove remmina remmina-common\n\n\nA: Just a heads up. I tried this recently and it does upgrade remmina and RDP works great. However, it replaces libfreerdp1 with a different version that causes vlc to be removed due to a missing dependency. \nI ended up forcing vlc to install by using apt-get download to get all of the deb packages except the libfreerdp1 for vlc and then performed a dpkg --force-depends to get it to install.

If your file is called \"list\" you could source it using:\nsource list\n\nor just\n. list\n\nNote the space between the . and the filename. A dot on its own is a synonym for \"source \".\nIf your file is called \".list\" (ie it is hidden), then:\nsource .list\n\nor\n. .list\n\nis what you need.\n", "Q: How can I install phpstorm? I am having a hard time finding out how to install programs in Ubuntu in the right location. If I use Ubuntu Software Center to install a program that gets installed in its right place, but when I download a program manually in this case PhpStorm it went to the Downloads folder and when I ran the command\n/home/shairyar/Downloads/PhpStorm-139.732/bin/phpstorm.sh\n\nI assumed it would get installed in the directory where it is supposed to go.\nAfter I ran the command phpstorm kicked off, I did the work I needed to do, and before shutting off the computer I thought of cleaning the Downloads folder. After deleting the phpstorm folder there I could no longer use the phpstorm shortcut I created.\nSo after restoring the deleted files, how do I move phpstorm to its right location? In future how do I make sure applications are installed to the right places?\n\nA: What ways are there to install software in Ubuntu?\nThere are many different ways software is installed on Linux. The preferred method is using the official repositories using apt or the Software Center. However, some programs are not available there, so you can add other repositories using PPAs. This will add \"unofficial\" packages to the repositories used by APT and the Software Center.\nSome software is not available in PPAs either, but there are installers available, like on Windows. These installers can be shell scripts, .RUN files or other things. You can install these programs by running the installer just like you would do on Windows.\nSome software is available as \"ready to run\" archives. You just extract it and run it. No installation. For those programs, you have to provide a .desktop file yourself, and you have to put them in a \"safe\" folder.\nHow do I install this program?\nThis program seems to be of the last type. I would recommend to put it in its own subfolder in the /opt folder. /opt/PhpStorm-139.732\nVia graphical interface\nOne of the easiest ways to do this is using nautilus (the file manager), but you need root privileges to change things in the /opt/ folder. You can start nautilus as root by running sudo -H nautilus in a terminal. BE CAREFUL! You can do dangerous things running nautilus as root.\nVia command line\nMove the folder from downloads to /opt/ \nsudo mv /home/shairyar/Downloads/PhpStorm-139.732/ /opt/PhpStorm-139.732/\n\nAfter that, you can check if it is moved by running ls on the directory. This lists the contents of the directory\nls /opt/PhpStorm-139.732/\n\nCreate a launcher icon\nYou can find more information on how to create a launcher icon here: How can I create launcher icon for PhpStorm?\n\nA: PhpStorm is a commercial IDE for PHP, built by JetBrains. PhpStorm is available for a free 30-day evaluation. It provides on-the-fly error prevention, best autocompletion & code refactoring, zero configuration debugging, and an extended HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editor.\nPhpStorm can be installed from the software app in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu or from the terminal with the following command:\nsudo snap install phpstorm --classic\n\n", "Q: Nvidia 331 on kernel 3.18.1 ThinkPad t540p, running Ubuntu 14.10 and kernel 3.18.1.

My image processing package has an 'annotate' utility that supports about a dozen fonts. It runs fine on my development system but, predictably, some fonts will not be installed on target systems. It is designed to run on any LINUX distribution.\nI distribute needed fonts with my application, but I wish to spare users the hassle of installing the fonts. I am assuming no LINUX expertise on the part of my users, and I do not want them to have to be 'root' to do anything.\nHow can I make my application directly access the fonts distributed with it instead of forcing the user to embark on a confusing sysadmin font installation task?\nMany thanks.\nImagtek\nClarification: \nI'm targeting ALL Linux distributions. UBUNTU is a subset of all. Researching various LINUX distributions, there is a mishmash of approaches to font management. I cannot support each one individually. My app is designed to be installed under the user account, avoiding root access (until moving successful install to /opt) and accessing fonts from its distribution. Similarly, security concerns prevent running an installation script as root. Similarly, targeting ALL Linux distributions precludes becoming a client of any single Linux 'app store' and environment. Yes this is all politically incorrect and my apologies. Thanks.\n\nA: You don't want the users to have to use root? Installing softare usually requires root.\nOn Ubuntu (and I'd assume most debian-based distros) you can copy the fonts into a subdirectory of /usr/share/fonts/truetype (I assume they are TTF's) and update the font cache.\nIf you're creating a deb package, you can simply pack them so that they will be installed into, let's say /usr/share/fonts/truetype/<softwarename>-fonts/. In the postinst script, you can then run\nfc-cache -f -v.\nIf you're simply publishing a installation script, mkdir the subdirectory, then cp the TTF's into it. Afterwards, call fc-cache -f -v to rebuild the font cache.\n", "Q: VirtualBox Installatation Issues This question has some relation to my previous question, but just read and see its different.\nWhenever I Try to install VirtualBox in the software center it downloads fine.

I have been reading about the process of installing eclipse manually, so that is not my question. I just wonder if there are any real risks to system stability if I install manually instead of using the command line. I have used Juno quite a bit, so I don't want to use an older version which is available through the Ubuntu software center.\n\nA: No, it is not safe. Running untrusted scripts from the internet is never safe. A trusted ppa (for example, from the creators of eclipse) is the preferred way. \nIf you run a script from the internet, make sure it comes from a trusted place.

I recently purchased a Sansa Clip+ with 8 GB of storage.  That was not enough so I bought a 128GB microSDXC UHS-I Card with adapter.  When I boot up Banshee, the card is looked at as a separate device on which to store music and podcasts.  Is there a way to get Banshee to treat it as 128+8 = 136 GB of total storage rather than as a separate device?  Here is my \".is_audio_player\" configuration file (which needs to be on both the 128GB and 8GB storage devices in order to be recognized by Banshee I believe) in case that helps.\naudio_folders=Music/,Podcasts/\nfolder_depth=2\noutput_formats=audio/mp3\n\n\nA: No, you cannot. The two storage locations are exposed as separate devices over the USB, so they will be displayed as such. There is no feature in Banshee, or udev, to have them combined into a single device.\n\nA: \nDo you pine for the nice days of minix-1.1, when men were men and wrote their own device drivers?\n  - Linus Torvalds\n\nIf the device reports the SD card as a second device, then udev registers two separate device files.\nIf you think of yourself as a person who could do it, you could try to create your own driver which takes care of deciding where to put the files, but I can't think of anything else you could do about it.\nActually it makes more sense to display both storage devices separately, so you can control what goes where. \n", "Q: Conky new text overlap with an old text My problem is best to be describe using picture :\nEdit 1 : Here is the link to the picture, http://i.stack.imgur.com/KWEmQ.png\nAs you can see in Process Name and and my wifi infos, the text will overlap after conky is running for about 5 minutes.

System halted\" error I have VirtualBox on Ubuntu 14.10 and some programs don't work on Wine, so I wanted to use a Windows XP SP3 ISO (for basic programs) and it gives me the error \"FATAL: No bootable medium found! System halted.\" These are my settings for Storage:\n\nAnd here are my settings for system:\n\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: Seems like you have not a hard-drive... you can add one on Settings like here on my image (I have it in Catalan language, sorry)\n\nIf you have already one, just add a CD (at the left from add hard-drive button) and run VirtualBox machine again.\nEdited:\nWell, seeing your images, the only thing what I can think is when you run the virtual machine, press F2 to enter on boot menu, select the CD, key C and start the Windows XP installation, you should be able to install it.\nPS: Be sure to make on general tab a type of machine Windows XP (32 bit).\n\nA: The main reason this could be happening is because the ISO is not loaded. Other reasons why this may be happening is because the ISO may be corrupted, damaged, or not finished downloading. This is one of the problems with Google Chrome, it will say finished but not really finished and you get a partial ISO. Try downloading with Windows, or with Safari.\nCiao,\nLandon\n\nA: It happens if you don't pay attention to the primary boot disk. When you choose ISO image, also expose the cd as primary. Also, there is the priority for boot in \"System option\". You can manage them by clicking a small arrow next to Boot order checkboxes.\nOtherwise it won't see your ISO image while booting and you'll get this error:\n\nFATAL: No bootable medium found! System halted.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem trying to install a CentOS .iso in VirtualBox on a MacBook Pro.  The mirror site I downloaded the image from did not have \"DVD\" in the filename and took hours to download.  I started top level of the CentOS site, clicked on \"Get CentOS\" and clicked on the \"DVD ISO\" and downloaded from the nearest mirror site which took minutes to download.  The original had \"aarch64\" in the filename and the new one I used had \"x86_64\".  Long story longer, the .iso image you are using might not be a DVD .iso image.  Don't know enough to know if there is a difference, but it worked for me!  Also, I know this is an Ubuntu Q&A, but the issues might be similar.\n\nA: I just had the same issue, but for me i needed to re-order my SATA optical drives with the windows iso as port 1, and the physical cd/dvd as port 2.  then it worked!\n", "Q: I can't use all my RAM! I know somebody will mark this as duplicate, but I can't find the answer, so I'm asking.\nI have 3GB of RAM and Ubuntu says: Memory 2.9 GiB. No, it is NOT my onboard graphics card, because it uses only ONE GiB of RAM.\n\nA: 1GB (1 Gigabyte = 1'000 MB) and 1GiB (1 Gibibyte = 1'024 MiB) aren't the same thing.\nYou say that you should have 3GB of RAM and the Graphics chip uses 1 GiB.\nI assume you have a total of 4GB RAM, of which 1GiB is dedicated the Graphics chip. And what's the result of 4GB-1GiB? That's correct: 2.9GB or 2.73GiB.\nI've got the slight feeling that even memory manufacturers don't know the difference between those two unit systems (or they deliberately fool the customers and use them interchangably, so your 4GiB memory actulally only is 4GB, which is 3.72GiB) That Ubuntu says 2.9GiB doesn't sound correct to me. Frontends and their system utils don't always 100%ly match...\nSo you see, it's always a fuss about those two unit systems. Better not think about it and accept it or you'll end up with a terrible headache...\n", "Q: How to change the permissions of the sound devices so only audio users can read and write Summary: I want to know how to change the permissions of my sound devices so that only my user can read and write to them. I thought this could be accomplished by chmod 0660 /dev/dsp* but /dev/dsp* does not exist.\nSystem Info: Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (xubuntu)\nDetailed Problem: I noticed that light locker stops my audio when it automatically logs me out after a certain duration of inactivity. I found an article that suggests I Add my user to the audio group (see: http://xubuntu.org/news/screen-locking-in-xubuntu-14-04/ ). I didn't know how to do that, so I found another instructional article saying I should also change the permissions of the sound devices so only audio users can read and write. It says I should execute chmod 0660 /dev/dsp* (see: http://www.maenad.net/geek/di8k-debian/node23.html ). However my system doesn't have /dev/dsp*. I want to know what the correct directory is for Ubuntu 14.04 so that I can properly change permissions as mentioned above.\n\nA: Did you check this one to know the device file. Taken from the man page of dsp.\n\nOSS  4.0  (and later) will create audio devices under\n  /dev/oss/\n         directory.  For example /dev/oss/sblive0/pcm0 is the first audio device\n         that  belongs  to  the  first Sound Blaster Live! or Audigy card in the\n         system. These direct devices are used  when  an  application  needs  to\n         access specific audio device (instead of the default one).\n   You  can use the ossinfo(1) utility with the -a option to get a list of\n   the available audio devices in the system.\n\n\n", "Q: Want to disable built-in screen by default Some background: My old, well-loved laptop has kicked the bucket. The normally well-backlit screen is entirely, illegibly darkened. It seems to my inexpert inspection to be a hardware problem well beyond my ken.\nMy actual question regards my adaptation to this situation: I can still use the computer by attaching another monitor to the laptop and using that to satisfy my graphical needs. The default dual-screen behavior of Ubuntu is to treat the screens as a side-by-side affair, which is irksome since i can only see what's being displayed on one of the screens. I would like to configure Ubuntu (or xorg, or what have you) to treat an attached screen as the single working screen, such that it does not attempt to use the built-in screen in any way.\nI've considered (but not actually tried to make the default) the Mirror Displays option available in System Settings (in 14.04), but this seems to result in awkward resolution changes in an attempt to accommodate both screens (even though one of them I'm not concerned with in the slightest). I figure that if I'm lugging this laptop about to plug into many other available monitors, this would probably lead to some hair-splittingly weird visual inconsistency.\nMy more reasonable solution is to just try to use xrandr to turn off the offending screen. In particular,\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --off\n\nappears to do what I was hoping, but this seems like a rather low-hanging, impermanent fix. (LVDS1 is the name of my built-in screen as X knows of it, as revealed by xrandr -q.) I'm hoping to use something a bit deeper, so that I can be certain that I can use this laptop even in situations where I wouldn't have an X server running, say. \n\nA: xrandr is a difficult way to perform this; I don't recommend it.\nGo to System Settings > Screen Display.\nYou will see both of your screens.\nBy selecting a screen, you can modify its defaults such as its resolution — and you can turn it off altogether (slide the ON button to OFF).\nBe sure to locate the Launcher on \"All displays\" so that you don't end up missing the launcher.\nThe settings should be remembered after rebooting.\n\nA: Not what you're looking for exactly, but remember you can always access your computer even without any local screen - as long as you have networking configured so that it is ready upon starting. When you install sshd on the computer you can always log in via ssh from a second machine, and reconfigure your X. \n", "Q: \"You have held broken packages\" error I try to run -\n$ jhbuild sysdeps --install\n\nbut run into the broken packages error.\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nHere is the complete log- http://pastebin.com/ZaV34510\nI am on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.

I had successfully installed Ubuntu on my Windows 8.1 hp laptop using the manual partitioning method (not the \"install alongside windows 8\" way). Today my Ubuntu was being weird and the mouse was blinking and all the text was resizing over and over again, and my shutdown button actually popped up the \"lock\" and \"log out\" options instead of the \"shutdown\" and \"restart\" options. \nSo I rebooted Ubuntu using LiveUSB and installed it again, and a message showed up saying \"Ubuntu 14.04 detected\", and the 2 options were \"install Ubuntu 14.04 alongside Ubuntu 14.04\" and \"erase Ubuntu 14.04 and do a clean installation of it (or something like that)\". I thought the second option would only affect my Ubuntu partition, so I selected it. Then I restarted my computer and found that my entire hardrive now was taken up by Ubuntu. \nIs there a way for me to get back my windows partition? Would installing windows with LiveUSB and then restoring it with the backup I created work?\n\nA: I might have great news for you.  It is possible, although not likely, that your windows installation actually survives and that you in fact have THREE installations, two of which are 14.04.  The way to find out is to load Disk Utility the next time you are booted to ubuntu and count how many NTFS and EXT4 partitions you have.\n\nA: Unfortunately your windows is gone for sure. No matter what option you selected after you rebooted using LiveUSB you were doomed to lose your Windows.\nI have seen guides out there for installing windows after Ubuntu, but I am not sure they applied to Windows 8. Honestly, if it were me, since you are on a fresh install of Ubuntu anyways, I would just use recovery partition or whatever you got and then do your backup to get windows back and then re-install Ubuntu along side windows. Or by using the method you originally did and if you have the issue again just diagnose the issue and maybe can get fixed without a re-install.\nOne thing I am unsure of if you do do the manual route again, and decide to upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu later, you may run into problems again.\nEdit: If you do have files on the windows partition that are not part of your backup, it could be possible to get those files back, but you will need to make no changes to the Ubuntu machine.

Is that possible?\n\nA: Although I am not clairvoyant, and cannot state with any certainty that your computer absolutely will not run windows remotely well, I feel confident enough to bet on it, and I rarely gamble.\nThe reason I am so sure have a lot to do with the operating system which is on it.  You see, version 10.04 of Ubuntu was the very last generation before Unity, meaning that it's graphics and memory demands were less than slightly later operating systems have been ever since.  Also, the operating system is four and a half years old, meaning that the computer is probably between 6-10 years old, but again, I'm speculating.\nYour computer may not be worth much, but it is actually worth significantly more now, with an out-of-date working installation of Ubuntu on it, than it will be if you disable even that.\nIf you wish to verify my assessment, please install System Profiler and Benchmark, and update your request with such information as the type of CPU, the amount of RAM, and any other such information as you may glean from it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu NFS - /var/nfs requires sudo So I have setup a NFS client and server both running on Ubuntu server.

I see no reason to do so, since nobody can't login, and nogroup has no other members, usually. As a security measure, I don't think it has any benefits over root:root.\n\nShould I just change it to that of my user:group?\n\nThat depends. The ownership is determined by the UID and the GID, so check the values of id -u and id -g on both systems. If they agree, yes, that's the best option.

If I \"brush\" the keyboard (don't know how else to describe pressing a key for the slightest moment), then the letter appears normally, but after the prescribed delay, it will auto-repeat as if the key was kept pressed. In my case the auto-repeat delay is about half a second. This issue exists for all of the keyboard keys, including up/down arrows, backspace, etc. It does it consistently in all Ubuntu applications.\nI have a Dell Precision M4800. Dual boot with Windows 8.1. The keyboard works fine in Windows.\nThe laptop is new. So far this is the only issue with this install. Everything else appear to be working well. I am familiar with Ubuntu 14.04 (I have it on 3 other laptops). This is the first time I've seen this issue.\nI have an external USB keyboard and it doesn't have this issue. However it is so crude, and the keys so deep, that I cannot really recreate the same \"brushing\" effect.\nAll the \"Universal Access\" options are off.\nEDIT 1: \nThe following is from a XEV.

I had the exact same problem until I updated to A13.\n\nA: The timing indicates an auto-repeat function is being used to generate the key presses. They are much faster than you can type, and if you look at the next keypress after the release, the difference in time should be 0.  \nThe auto-repeat probably indicates a sticking key. You might try the universal access to suppress the keyrepeats, but you probably need to try cleaning the keyboard or getting a replacement.\n\nA: I experienced the same problems. Just flashed my E6440 with the latest BIOS firmware. \nThat seems to have fixed the issue. The release notes for the firmware explicitly mention the keyboard issue on Linux OSes should be fixed by the update.\n", "Q: How to auto start SeaFile Client?

My point that neither unetbootin nor the other related program were working was approaching the actual problem that the file simply could not work with either, but as I had never tried to work with the chrome file, I depended on my relative expertise with unetbootin.\n\nA: You might like to try Multisystem, which is designed to launch several distributions from one USB drive, but it has the advantage of quite intelligently deciding how to mount an image for booting (GRUB2, Lilo etc). I have found it far superior to unetbootin.\nIt is very well maintained, and there are frequent updates via apt-get once you have the repositories installed.\nYou can get the source here:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/multisystem/\nBut you can also install and keep it updated it via Ubuntu package manager by downloading the following, extracting it and running it as root (be warned!):\nhttp://liveusb.info/multisystem/install-depot-multisystem.sh.tar.bz2\n", "Q: What happened to my Windows XP drive I'm updating my new server, during that update, I need to update my old Intel E5200, Dual Core, 2 GB, dual 250 GB drives, Windows XP Pro SP3. Tired of Microsoft I decided to explore Linux (Ubuntu 14). \nI proceeded to install, not clear on the partition thing, with two 250 GB SATA IDE Drives, I disabled my primary in the BIOS and disconnected its data cable. I continued to install Ubuntu and assigned the core/swap partitions. Couldn't have loaded any easier. \nWhen completed I enabled the primary drive in BIOS and reconnected the Data cable. My intention was to have two separate drives with independent OS's, Windows XP and Linux, being able to switch in BIOS either drive for desired OS. I need XP for process control debugging for GPIB. \nSo After completion I rebooted and attempted to switch to my Primary drive with XP and found I wasn't able to access that drive, as though Ubuntu actually installed on both drives. Unable to access my Windows XP drive completely. \nIs there a link which can direct me to explain what happened? I have a complete library of programs and reading files needed on the Windows XP Drive I would like to recover. Your help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Very good!  I like a man who thinks like I do and PHYSICALLY DISCONNECTS drives for safety.  Around here I'm oft treated like I'm some sort of a nut, but I too believe in safety.\nRest assured, provided that you actually disconnected the correct drive, everything is going to be fine.  Of course if you disconnected the blank drive and formatted the windows drive... there's no going back, but I'm going to hope for the best.\nWhat I believe happened is that when Ubuntu installed on the blank drive, it installed its own boot sector on that drive, and for some reason, your bios is preferring to boot to that drive.  In my opinion, you have THREE GREAToptions.\n1) You can use your bios' own \"Boot Menu\" (most bios have them these days.  sometimes you have to press a key such as escape or f12 at boot time).  The problem with this plan is that it doesn't actually protect you from rampant viruses which can literally reach out and wipe your drives.  If it's connected, it's game.\n2) You can do things the way I do them, with a removable hard drive system such as this one so that there is only one hard drive connected at a time.  Trust me, this is really your best bet if you like safety!  Windows can reach out and hurt things.  I've experienced it first hand!\n3) You can do things in a somewhat more normal way, which works very much like partitioned hard drives in so much as you select boot media from a menu at boot time, with both drives connected at once and no switching of anything in the bios.  Best of all this solution is EASY and doesn't cost anything.  You just open this link, burn the self booting CD, and shut down the PC.  If you have not already done so, connect both hard drives such that they are both recognized by the computer.  Then you boot your computer to the boot repair CD, and follow its easy one click operation to repair your boot.  When it is done, your computer should present you with a sort of menu at boot time offering you the choice of Ubuntu (at the top) and Windows (usually at or near the bottom).  By default it usually boots to Ubuntu first.\n", "Q: unlock app from root i tried to lock pidgin application through the following code written on another thread\n jai@frank-Jai:~$ sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/pidgin\n\n[sudo] password for jai: $$$$$$\n\njai@frank-Jai:~$ sudo chmod 700 /usr/bin/pidgin\n\njai@frank-Jai:~$ pidgin\n\n bash: /usr/bin/pidgin: Permission denied\n\njai@frank-Jai:~$ \n\nthis has locked the app but now clicking on the app its not opening. it should ask for the password i suppose but thats not happening any way to unlock the app ? or i went wrong somewhere in locking?\n\nA: It should already be owned by root so the chown command is not necessary - this:\nsudo chown root:root /usr/bin/pidgin\n\nChanges the ownership and group to be owned by root - it probably was owned by root in the first place, as could of be shown by ls -l /usr/bin/*, so was not necessary.\nThis command is what 'locks' the app:\nsudo chmod 700 /usr/bin/pidgin\n\nThis change the permissions so the pidgin can only be read, written to, and executed by the owner (in the case, root - manual for chmod here). So to run it, you would have to run it as root with something like:\n#sudo pidgin\n\nWithout the #. but DON'T RUN IT\nHowever, that is a really bad idea (SO DON'T RUN IT), as any malicious code (there shouldn't be, but some things online can be evil) that is run could infect the system as root has access to everything - also as it run as root it can't use any of the configuration you made as your normal user, as root is a different user entirely.\nTo 'unlock' it so you can access it, run:\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/pidgin\n\nThis changes the permissions back.\nTo lock an app, try the answers @Jacob suggested above:\n\nCan't you find a \"milder\" solution here: askubuntu.com/questions/548568/… or here: askubuntu.com/questions/445145/password-for-apps/445184#445184? You cannot run pidgin now because only root has permission run it. (and a password is only asked when you use gksu <application>\n\nAlso, with commands you find on the internet (most on this site are ok - check all of the answer, the other answers, and comments first though), it may be ideal (particularly when run with sudo as root) to look up info on the command with chmod --help, man chmod, or online, so you can find out what the command actually does.\n", "Q: Call functions from C program in terminal This is driving me absolutely crazy because it's such a simple thing to do but I can't seem to get it.\nLet's say I have a program called test.c whose content is as follows.\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nmain() {\n    int bool_or(int x, int y) {\n        int result = x|y;\n        //return result;\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint bool_xor(int x, int y) {\n    int result= x^y;\n        //return result;\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n}\n}\n\nNow let's say I want to make a function call to one of those functions from the terminal. How do I do that? I compiled the program and I can manually comment out the function definitions and input specific values in the editor and get something to display, but what if I want to simply just write something like bool_xor(3, 5) on the command line like I would if I were running a language like Python.\nBasically what I'm asking is how do I make a function call.\nThanks!\n\nA: I'm sorry, but you have to read up on C syntax. There were two major issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Defining functions inside main is not possible in standard C and even in the GCC extension, it certainly doesn't work how you think it does.\n\n*Calling a function doesn't happen by magic, you must tell what to use as parameters and how to rework them to a suitable form.\n\n\nI have re-worked your code to a working state (in a file called bool_xor.c):\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint bool_xor(int x, int y) {\n    int result= x^y;\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n    if (argc<3) {\n        printf(\"Too few args.\\n\");\n        exit(1);\n    }\n\n    return bool_xor( atoi(argv[1]), atoi(argv[2]) );\n}\n\nAnd now compile and a couple of simple tests:\n$ gcc -Wall --pedantic -o bool_xor bool_xor.c \n\n$ ./bool_xor 1 2\n3\n\n$ ./bool_xor 7 5\n2\n\nTo create a separate or function, you will either need to reengineer the main() to decide which function it's calling or just have another bool_or.c file and generate a separate binary that does that single job (like this one does).\nHere's an example of a combined compare.c that takes an xor or or argument before the values to determine which internal function to execute. \n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint bool_or(int x, int y) {\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x|y);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint bool_xor(int x, int y) {\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x^y);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n    if (argc!=4) {\n        printf(\"Needs 3 parameters. Expects:\\n\\t%s xor|or value value\\n\", argv[0]);\n        exit(1);\n    }\n\n    /* TODO check that arguments are valid */\n\n    if (strcmp(argv[1], \"xor\") == 0)\n        return bool_xor( atoi(argv[2]), atoi(argv[3]) );\n    return bool_or( atoi(argv[2]), atoi(argv[3]) );\n}\n\n", "Q: How to install canon mf4720w printer in 14.04 LTS?

Keyboard, touchpad don't work. Ctrl+Alt+Bkspc does nothing. (Update: Just discovered this doesn't restart the X-server by default.) I was hard-resetting my machine first few times, but then I found out that that Ctrl+Alt+F1 works and I have been sudo rebooting since, which seems like a more graceful way to do it.\nWhat could be causing these frequent freezes? Can I get a debug dump of the crash somewhere?

Then go to the processes and order them by RAM/CPU usage. Which are on the top?\nIf you can't find it and my previous answer doesn't work or fit you, I don't know how to help, sorry...\n\nA: Your problem is the Gallium on llvmpipe part. This means, that instead using the intel driver, your laptop is basically rendering everything on the (very slow) CPU, that's why it crawls so badly. I can't really help with fixing the driver issue, I can only suggest using a desktop environment which does not need 3D acceleration, as @Peter Nerlich has suggested (personally I recommend XFCE, to me, LXDE always felt like an eyesore).\nYou could share with us the exact CPU you are using, maybe another solution exists for you. I am guessing it uses the Intel GMA 500 (codename Poulsbo) chipset, which has the infamous PowerVR graphics core.\nAnother possible solution is trying out the older, 12.04 release of Ubuntu. I have a Samsung N150 netbook, with similar hardware, it works without much hassle - though I have only OpenGL 1.4 \"thanks\" to the pathetic GPU.\n\nA: I think this must be a drivers issue, as on paper, Ubuntu should be more lightweight than Windows 7.

Wheter it's when using browser or doing something else. And sometimes it happens like 10 seconds after waking up from suspend mode. And when it freezes, it freezes completely, mouse doesn't move, no reacton from keyboard, nothing. I have tried that REISUB thing many times - nothing. So I have to reset it by power button. \nBut this freezing isn't happening on Xubuntu, which I'm right now using. So it might have to do something with Unity? Would upgrading to 14.10 solve the issue?\nEdit: after waking up from suspend, freezup happens every time. so it's basically inavoidable.  So it looks like the only way to prevent it from freezing after wake up would be to turn off computer, and not leting it suspend itself or do it manually.\nBut random freezing can happen still happen too.\n\nA: Did you check Graphic driver? in about this PC -I have Spanish version hehe- you can see which video driver has your notebook.

I envision the following setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Proxy server for SSL offloading (maybe redundant if that is not too hard)\n\n*Primary node running application and JVM\n\n*Secondary node (hot spare) running application and JVM\n\n\nThe proxy server should only use the secondary node if the primary node is down. There should be only a single application node receiving requests. Scaling horizontally is something we do not need and it complicates business logic.\nThe above setup seems fairly doable. It becomes (in my mind) more complicated when I think about the continuous deployment part.\nMy applications are built with a private Jenkins machine and result in a zip file containing the application (as a runnable bash script) with all of it's dependencies.\nThe following steps should be taken to deploy it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Send the zip to a server\n\n*Deploy a new proxy, primary and secondary node with the application\n\n*Switch to the new proxy\n\n\nI want to create a charm for this, but I am not sure how to proceed.\nIs it possible to deploy a charm bundle from within a charm? If so, how?\nNote that any advice is welcome. I do not need concrete implementations, just pointers and general directions.\n\nA: Sending a 'built' application to your environment is actually a fairly common technique especially for those using tools like docker.\nTypically you'll want to create a charm for each component in your environment. In this case it looks like you would have 'proxy' and 'application'.\nSo you would create a proxy charm which has, in addition to the install and start hooks, a relation-joined and relation-broken hook scripts. These scripts will modify the proxy settings when a relation is joined to add the new application location and subsequently remove an application location on broken. This will allow you to keep the proxy up and running and swap out application servers at will. \nThe application service will have similar hook scripts to send its location to the proxy service. It will also need a charm configuration option for the location of the application zip file to which it needs to deploy. When the applications install hook is run it will then pull down the zip file at the location supplied extract and then run it in the start hook.\nThe continuous deployment is where Juju really shines. First you're going to need a bootstrapped environment juju bootstrap <your-env-name> and juju switch <your-env-name>.\nYour Jenkins instance will build your proxy zip and application zip file and then upload them to a place where your servers can access. If you're on EC2 this would likely be on S3. It would then take note of the location paths and build number, and service names of the currently running proxy and application services.\nIt will then run:\njuju deploy your-proxy your-proxy-<build-number>\njuju deploy your-application your-application-<build-number>\njuju add-unit your-application-<build-number> -n 2\n\nAt this point you'd likely want something on an interval checking periodically to see when your proxy and application services are up and running. At which point you will want to connect the new application service to the proxy, switch traffic to your new proxy and tear down the old services.\njuju add-relation your-proxy-<build-number> your-application-<build-number>\n# add code here to switch to new proxy\njuju destroy your-proxy-<old-build-number>\njuju destroy your-application-<old-build-number> \n\nThis assumes that you will be rebuilding your proxy every time your application changes. If not then simply remove the proxy steps from the above commands. This also assumes that the applications take time to start and you wouldn't want to incur that downtime so a simple upgrade-charm hook wouldn't work.\n", "Q: Dropbox System Tray Icon Black Background In the newest release of Dropbox, the background of the icon is black (in the system tray). So no matter which theme you use, unless it's a black theme, the icon looks awful. Does anyone know the cause?\n\nA: (Are you using nvidia drivers? from http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=38154&p=2, slightly updated)\nThis happens because nvidia driver overrode OpenGL library (libGL.so). This workaround works for me on kubuntu 14.04 [and linux mint 17].\n1) close dropbox session\n$ dropbox stop\n\n2) find your nvidia system folder: in my systems it's /usr/lib/nvidia-331 (if you using another version of nvidia driver, for instance nvidia-340, your directory should be /usr/lib/nvidia-340). Take note of libGL.so.1 inside this folder\n3) find dropbox system library. with dropbox 3.4.6 this is in the home directory.. the version number may change, and may have to be modified when you type it into the terminal\n$ cd ~/.dropbox-dist/dropbox-lnx.x86_64-3.4.6/\n\n4) backup your's dropbox OpenGL library:\n$ mv libGL.so.1 libGL.so.1_backup\n\n5) make symbolic link to nvidia's OpenGL library.:\n$ ln -sf /usr/lib/nvidia-331/libGL.so.1 libGL.so.1\n\n(so basically: ln -sf /usr/lib/nvidia-[VERSIONHERE]/libGL.so.1 ~/.dropbox-dist/[VERSIONHERE]/libGL.so.1\n6) start up dropbox\n$ dropbox start\n\nHopefully this helps, this worked for me. What it does is force dropbox to use the libGL installed on your system after nvidia overwrites it, by placing a symbolic link to the nvidia libGL in place of the one dropbox was installed with. After backing up the old dropbox libGL, of course.\n\nA: Are you using LC_NUMERIC=C?\nOpen a terminal and try the following:\ndropbox stop\nexport LC_NUMERIC=es_ES    (Put here your language)\ndropbox start\n\nThat work for me.\n", "Q: api for new and stable versions of Ubuntu I am trying to build an automatic Ubuntu widget for my website, that displays the latest version and the next to be released version and the to be LTS versions.\nRight now at every new Ubuntu release I have to get the data manually.

I am a new Ubuntu user with a fresh installation, and am eager to get started with it. However, all of my important data is on Windows software RAID 0 array, and I need it to stay there as I'm also dual booting Windows. I need access to this data on Ubuntu, and can't really get anything real done until I have access.\nI have already researched this subject as best as I could, and I managed to find a very helpful post:\n\n\n*\n\n*can I mount my WinXP software RAID 0 array in Ubuntu/Kubuntu?\nThe post describes how to get Ubuntu to see a Windows RAID 0 array that is made up of two drives. The main command used is sudo mdadm --build /dev/md0 --chunk=64 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdd2 /dev/sdc2. According to that user, and the other posters in the thread, it actually does work. That's great.\nI have not tried following these instructions yet. Why? The post includes a warning about how you must not write to it if you enter the wrong chunk size; it's understandable how that could cause problems. My concern is that my setup is different to their example, and I am not sure that the commands should be entered exactly the same for my setup. I am afraid to break it by doing it wrong, and therefore wish to get the advice of somebody more experienced.\nThis is how my setup differs from their example:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have three 1 TB drives, not two drives (of whatever size they used).\n\n*I have two RAID 0 partitions spread across those three drives: one 500 GB and 2.3 TB. This means that I need to NOT use the full disks when creating the RAID array, but instead use just part of them.\n\n*I used a non-default block size for at least one of my RAID 0 partitions when I set them up years ago. I have no idea if this block size is the same as the chunk size that they mention.

So now, my question is this: what is the proper command for me to enter with my setup, so that I can access both of my Windows RAID 0 partitions from Ubuntu?\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nA: The others answers worked only partially in Mint 18.3.\nAuto-mounting the Raid0 drives was a bit more challenging since editing /etc/init/mountall.conf never worked in my system and I wanted to be able to mount the spanned volume using a definition in /etc/fstab, and not use a script in /etc/rc.local.\nSo here's what I did:\nsudo apt-get install ldmtool\nChecked that the volume was recognized and could be mounted correctly with:\nsudo ldmtool create all\nKnowing that that my system could see and write into the drives. I created a service (following the directions from this site:(https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dynamic_disks)\nCreated a file in etc/systemd/system/ called ldmtool.service with the description of the service:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Windows Dynamic Disk Mount\nBefore=local-fs-pre.target\nDefaultDependencies=no\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=root\nExecStart=/usr/bin/ldmtool create all\n[Install]\nWantedBy=local-fs-pre.target\n\nTo enable the service on startup:\nsudo systemctl is-enabled ldmtool\nTo find the UUID of the volume used:\nsudo blkid\nWhich gave me the following info: /dev/mapper/ldm_vol_XXX-Dg0_Volume1: LABEL=\"6TB_Raid\" UUID=\"0A281FC6281FAFA5\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\nSo I created a line in /etc/fstab that reads:\nUUID=0A281FC6281FAFA5 /media/6TB_Raid ntfs-3g  auto,users,uid=1000,gid=100,dmask=027,fmask=137,utf8  0  0\n\nThe volume is there everytime I boot.\n\nA: I finally got this working thanks to this Stack Overflow post: Windows Spanned Disks (LDM) restoration with Linux?\nIt was extremely difficult to uncover this elusive information. It took days of searching, and I guess I wasn't finding it because the post makes no mention of RAID, so it wasn't coming up in my search results. It definitely works for my Windows software RAID 0, though.\nThe solution:\nThe solution is actually quite simple. There's a wonderful tool built specifically for this purpose, called ldmtool. It is capable of reading and working with Windows dynamic disks which use LDM (Logical Disk Manager). It is not installed by default, but is included in the Ubuntu repositories. All I had to do was execute two commands:\nsudo apt-get install ldmtool\nsudo ldmtool create all\n\nThe first command installs ldmtool, and the second has it automagically create device mappings for all of the connected Windows dynamic disks. These mappings are located in /dev/mapper/ and can be mounted manually with mount -t ntfs /dev/mapper/mapfilename, but I didn't need to do that - Ubuntu mounted them for me automatically after I ran the above two commands. That's all I had to do, and I could immediately access them from the file browser!\nThe linked post includes a suggestion for doing this automatically every boot. Just open the file /etc/init/mountall.conf and add the line [ -x /usr/bin/ldmtool ] && ldmtool create all >/dev/null || true immediately before the exec mountall ... line near the end of the file.\nFull credit for this solution goes to Christian Hudon, the guy who posted it as an answer over on Stack Overflow. Thanks!\nTo add some further information to this, I used some other ldmtool commands to query my volumes for information:\nsudo ldmtool scan /dev/sdd\n[\n  \"e856a65f-e558-11e1-ae19-bc5ff435f790\"\n]\n\nsudo ldmtool show diskgroup e856a65f-e558-11e1-ae19-bc5ff435f790\n{\n  \"name\" : \"Dan-PC-Dg0\",\n  \"guid\" : \"e856a65f-e558-11e1-ae19-bc5ff435f790\",\n  \"volumes\" : [\n    \"Volume1\",\n    \"Volume2\"\n  ],\n  \"disks\" : [\n    \"Disk1\",\n    \"Disk2\",\n    \"Disk3\"\n  ]\n}\n\nsudo ldmtool show volume e856a65f-e558-11e1-ae19-bc5ff435f790 Volume1\n{\n  \"name\" : \"Volume1\",\n  \"type\" : \"striped\",\n  \"size\" : 1048578048,\n  \"chunk-size\" : 128,\n  \"hint\" : \"D:\",\n  \"partitions\" : [\n    \"Disk1-01\",\n    \"Disk2-01\",\n    \"Disk3-01\"\n  ]\n}\n\nsudo ldmtool show volume e856a65f-e558-11e1-ae19-bc5ff435f790 Volume2\n{\n  \"name\" : \"Volume2\",\n  \"type\" : \"striped\",\n  \"size\" : 4811194368,\n  \"chunk-size\" : 128,\n  \"hint\" : \"E:\",\n  \"partitions\" : [\n    \"Disk1-02\",\n    \"Disk2-02\",\n    \"Disk3-02\"\n  ]\n}\n\nIt isn't necessary to run the above commands, as ldmtool create all does all the necessary work to create the mappings. I just included them because I already included information about my setup in the question, so this information might be helpful for anyone coming across this post later. In particular, we can see that according to ldmtool, both of my dynamic volumes use a chunk size of 128, despite being created with different block sizes in Windows. I guess this means that block size and chunk size are not synonymous terms. The commands ldmtool show disk and ldmtool show partition can be used to display further information.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS  mount raid 1 created by windows 7 using ldmtool\nby a newby.**\n**\nI had the same problem. Using the above answer I lucked out and got it mounted with\ngksu gedit /etc/init/mountall.conf \n\nby changing  the line \n [ -x /usr/bin/ldmtool ] && ldmtool create all >/dev/null || true\n\nto\n/bin/ldmtool create all >/dev/null || true\n\nthen added \n/bin/mount /dev/mapper/ldm_vol_NAME-Dg0_volume1 /media/WHEREVER\n\nMy mountall.conf looks like this now\n     **fi\n/usr/bin/ldmtool create all >/dev/null || true\n/bin/mount -o rw /dev/mapper/ldm_vol_OCTO-CORE-Dg0_Volume1 /media/m\n    exec mountall --daemon $force_fsck $fsck_fix $debug_arg\nend script**\n\npreviously I had a script to do the same with the 2 lines\n/usr/bin/ldmtool create all >/dev/null || true\n\n/bin/mount -o rw /dev/mapper/ldm_vol_OCTO-CORE-Dg0_Volume1 /media/m\n\nand added \nsh /home/ron/mirror to the end of /etc/rc.local \n\nnow it is mounted when ubuntu starts\nI don't know that this will work for you!\n", "Q: Unable to open Unity after update I am completely new to the Ubuntu world and just hit my first major problem while installing unity on my chromebook C720.

I am on Ubuntu 14.04. What do I need to do to get it?\nEDIT:\nIf it makes a difference, I am on a 64bit system and I think the application is compiled for 32bit because I had to install the 32bit version of libusb for it before this.\n\nA: Looks like you need the libcrypto++-dev package.  Determine this with apt-file\n$ apt-file search libcryptopp\nlibcrypto++-dev: /usr/lib/libcryptopp.a\nlibcrypto++-dev: /usr/lib/libcryptopp.so\nlibcrypto++9: /usr/lib/libcryptopp.so.9\n\nOf course that's the 32 bit version, and you may need a link from the .6 version your app needs to the .9 version.\n\nThe link for your 32 bit program needs to be added into /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu, not the x86_64-linux-gnu (case is important).  Check what the 32 bit executable needs and sees with ldd.  A properly set up 32 bit set of libraries should have a working ldd which reports on the 32 bit executables.

Try with this.\nIf you want to get random wallpapers from the Internet, you can execute this code:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true\ndo \n    img=http://www.wallpaperup.com/wallpapers/download/$RANDOM/1920/1080\n    wget -O /tmp/1080.jpg $img\n    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file:///tmp/1080.jpg\"\n    sleep 60\ndone\n\nThis script will change the wallpaper every 60 seconds.\n\nA: In bash you end for blocks with a done, like so:  \nfor f in *.jpg\ndo \n    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file:$f\"\ndone  \n\nAlso, put double quotes around $f, in case some file names contain spaces.\nNote that I think what you are trying to achieve could be done easier with find:  \nfind $imageDir -maxdepth 1 -type f -name \"*.jpg\" -exec gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:{} \\;  \n\nReplace $imageDir with the path to the folder you want to search. Or, if you want to run the command in the local directory you can do it like this:  \nfind -maxdepth 1 -type f -name \"*.jpg\" -exec gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:$PWD/{} \\;   \n\nThanks to Gilles for reminding me about $PWD.\n\nA: Add the last line: done.\nAlso, put double quotes around $f, in case some file names contain spaces.\nThus, the whole script becomes:\nfor f in *.jpg\ndo \n    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file:$f\"\ndone\n\n\nA: First, basic bash syntax: a for loop ends with the reserved word done.\nfor f in *.jpg\ndo \n    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:$f\ndone\n\nFurthermore $f is a relative path — it's a file name in the current directory. But as feyray remarked that file name would not be meaningful out of context. You need to provide an absolute path. You can do that easily with the PWD variable, which always contains the path to the current directory. Note that file:// URLs require two slashes for the :// indicator plus a slash for the root directory that starts the path, which $PWD includes.\nfor f in *.jpg\ndo \n    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file://$PWD/$f\ndone\n\nThat's not all. If any file name contains a space, your script won't work. To avoid this pitfall, put double quotes around variable substitutions (always put double quotes around variable substitutions).\nfor f in *.jpg\ndo \n    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file://$PWD/$f\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: Eye strain; how to change refresh rate to 120 Hz? I am a new Ubuntu user, and have been playing around with it with since installing it. I noticed that I have been getting a lot of eye strain due to the low refresh rate (of 50 or 60). I found this post about changing the refresh rate, but unfortunately, I can't seem to turn it up.\nI have a BenQ XL2420T 120 Hz monitor. I have the NVIDIA proprietary drivers installed. CompizConfig Settings Manager showed a value of 50 for the Refresh Rate property under the Composite plugin, but changing this to 120 didn't have any effect. xrand displays the columns 60.0*+  120.0  99.9 for my resolution, but when I try the xrand -r 120 or xrand -r 99.9 commands, it just says that the refresh rate is not available for the size.\nI don't understand what's going on here. I assume that those three columns that xrand output are the current refresh rate, the maximum refresh rate, and... something else. So clearly it sees that 120 is supported - why does it then say that it's not available?\nHow do I get this to work? It's been so long since I've worked with such a low refresh rate and it's killing my eyes.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I managed to fix this issue, so I'm posting the answer here in case anyone else has the same problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*According to someone on the internet, the NVIDIA drivers don't support xrandr (or at least not the current version). In order to change the resolution, I needed to use the \"NVIDIA X Server Settings\" GUI instead. The option is available on the \"X SERVER Display Configuration\" menu, under the \"Resolution\" setting. It defaults to \"Auto\" which apparently always uses 60 Hz. I needed to explicitly set my resolution and refresh rate, and apply it. Note that the first time I did this, I got a crash (from Compiz, I think?). I restarted my system and tried it again, and that time it worked. After changing this setting, xrandr displays 120 Hz as the current refresh rate.\n\n*However, the above change isn't the full story. I could clearly see that 120 Hz was still not being used, as rapidly dragging windows around on my screen resulted in jerky and flickery movement. In order to fix this, I had to open up the \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\" GUI, navigate to the \"Composite\" plugin, and again set the refresh rate back to 120 Hz. I had already changed this earlier, but for some reason, it had changed itself back. I then disabled \"Detect Refresh Rate\" in order for it to hopefully keep my setting.\nWith the above steps implemented, my refresh rate has successfully been changed to 120 Hz. It's amazing going back to 120 Hz again after suffering 60 Hz. It is silky smooth, and my eyes are already feeling better. :)\n\nA: I also had this problem and it took an aggravating 4 hours of work and no result. After like a month I decided to play around with the xrandr command some more. The result it didn't even accept xrandr -r 60. But it did accept xrandr -r 50. I checked my monitors osd and it said 60hz. After that I decided to try when it would break. Though for some reason I already achieved my initial goal at xrandr -r 51 as it now ran at 120hz. I still don't know what is causing this but my display finally runs at 120hz so I am really happy. Anyone who is having this issue should try some different rates to get it to work. I still don't get what is causing this but hey it works :). \n\nA: I recently was fooling around with xrandr, trying to add new mode to get a 3200x1800 desktop at 60hz.  This article helped me:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1112186\nI used gtf to get the mode information for my desired setting, and then added it with xrandr\nNote, I did not go through with putting the changes into xorg.conf\nMaybe this will help you?\n", "Q: How to switch boot partitions?

Also, I am using gparted to erase the partition. I cant access windows because it doesn't show up on the boot list.\n\nA: In addition to Perumal93's advice, also make sure you run sudo grub-install /dev/sda after you delete Windows in gparted and before you reboot.  \nReplace \"sda\" with another name if you need to. fdisk -l will show you which hard drive is 'dev/sda' and which one is 'dev/sdb'. You should choose the one that has your Linux partition.  \nAlso, make sure you do not add a number after dev/sda. (Adding a number would choose the partition, but GRUB wants you to give it the whole hard disk that the partition is stored on, so dev/sda, not dev/sda2.)  \nIf something doesn't go right and you can't start up Ubuntu, you can still fix it with a Live USB.

I left secure boot and everything else in BIOS alone.\nIn Windows go to Control Panel and Administrative Tools, then select Disk Manager. Select your partition and shrink to size you would like your Ubuntu to be. When it finishes, it will show as unallocated space, leave it like this. \nNow restart the installation process. You should now get an option to install alongside Windows boot manager. Go through the install process. When done restart. \nFor me, because I left secure boot and BIOS alone, after install and restart it will just boot Windows with no option to boot Ubuntu. On my hp laptop, I have to do the following to get to GRUB to select Ubuntu:\nAfter I turn on I have to press f9 right away, select Ubuntu, and then GRUB launches. From there I select Ubuntu again and press enter and it boots. \nEdit: I think I misread. If you can't even get the USB to boot up, the Ubuntu iso may not have setup correctly. In Windows download Linux live USB creator and use that to make your USB your Ubuntu installation media and bootable. The above instructions still apply. \nEdit 2: okay, it might be a good idea to download iso again. Once downloaded use Linux live USB creator to create bootable USB. Restart and then go to BIOS, restore default (f10) usually and save. \nIf you have a recovery partition and the option to back it up, I suggest you do that. My hp laptop allowed me to create one backup of my recovery. That way, if something goes wrong and you ever lose Windows you can get it back. \nIf you have the option to back up, do that first and then try to install Ubuntu again. Just when you install make sure you get the option \"install alongside Windows 8\" or \"install alongside windows boot manager\". \nIf you don't get one of those two options and continue with the install you will lose Windows \n\nA: The only way to install Ubuntu on uefi system from my experience is this:\ndisable fast boot,\nenble sata achi,\nenable usb boot,\ndisable secure boot.\nAfter that download and use RUFUS to make bootable USB, with gpt uefi partitioning, fat formatted.\nP.S.

I then used Parted Magic, changed the drive from \"unallocated\" to one large formatted partition. I got the same result: \"missing operating system\". \n\nA: Here's my best advice.  Disconnect your windows hard drive completely during installation.  You can solve the GRUB issues later, but the risk to your windows installation is highest while installing Ubuntu.  (and the other way around moreso).\nAs for master/slave jumpers, I advise you to get in the habit of using CS (cable select) which takes advantage of the cables having address selections internal to them so that they determine which is which.\nSo to resume your question of why, anything, I just don't know, but I can tell you how to make things work.  Make the installation with only one drive present and you probably won't have further issues.  I would also advise you to let Ubuntu erase and used the entire drive, permitting it to set the partition sizes.  As for the swap drive, I personally recommend the use of the \"Dynamic Swap Space Manager\" because it adjusts swap space as needed.\n\nA: Your install is a bit off.  Wipe the drive again and just boot from DVD and do not do anything fancy till you get to the part where you get to structure your Hard drive the way you want.  Leave the windows drive alone.  Ubuntu doesn’t touch that unless you tell it too.  Do not use the Boot Repair until it is needed, which is never needed on preinstall run.  When Ubuntu loads after install and doesn't show a grub entry for Windows simply sudo apt-get upgrade grub  and all should be fixed.\n", "Q: dymo labelmanager 280 with lubuntu Can I use my dymo labelmanager 280 with lubuntu ?\nI need to print some labels and I don't know what I need to buy.\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: You MIGHT find this page helpful.

Please, reccomend me a good, free software to make this.\n\nA: There is a lot to say about (creating) Debian packages, and information can be overwhelming. \nThe example below is to make the (very) first start, and create a Debian installer, as basic as it possibly gets, suited for \"home\" purposes.\nDebian packages\nA Debian package is in principle a scaled version of your system, seen from the perspective of the root directory. Directories are exactly organized like on your computer. \nLooking inside a .deb installer file with archive manager, you can see where files and (possibly) directories will be installed:\n\nIn this example, files will be installed in /etc, /usr and /opt (the folder DEBIAN contains installation files, see further below)\nBrowsing deeper into /usr, you can see the .desktop file (represening your application in Dash) is installed in /usr/share/applications/\n\nWhen an application is installed, the contents of this scaled version is \"projected\" on to your \"real\" system.\nA simple example; create a first installer\nSay you have a small application (script in this case), that you want to install into the directory /opt, together with its application icon. To represent the applications in Dash, you will also need a .desktop file.\nOur example application will only show you a window, saying you succeeded:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"application\":\nCopy the script below into an empty file, save it as ididit (don't use the sh extension)\n#!/bin/sh\nzenity --info --text 'It seems you succeeded making your first Debian installer...'\n\n\n*The icon:\nSimply download the icon below as ididit.png\n\n\n*The .desktop file\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=I did it!\nExec=/opt/ididit/ididit\nIcon=/opt/ididit/ididit.png\nType=Application\n\nCopy it and save it as ididit.desktop\nNow create the scaled directory:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an empty project folder somehwere, named (e.g.) ididit_1.0-1\n\n*Inside this project folder, create the directories:\n/opt/ididit\n/usr/share/applications\n/DEBIAN\n\nThe last directory will not be installed, but contains files, needed by the package manager (see further below).\n\n*Copy both your script, named ididit (no sh extension), and the icon, named ididtit.png into your newly created directory:\n[.../ididit_1.0-1]  /opt/ididit\n\nMake the script executable.\n\n*Copy the .desktop file into the directory:\n [.../ididit_1.0-1]  /usr/share/applications\n\n\n*The /DEBIAN directory contains files, used by the package manager. It can contain a varying number of files, postinst scripts etc. (look here and here for more information). Since this is meant to be an example as simple as possible, we'll keep it to just one necessary (minimized) file: the control file:\nPackage: ididit\nVersion: 1.0-1\nSection: unknown\nArchitecture: amd64\nDepends: zenity\nMaintainer: Your Name <your_email>\nDescription: This is my first Debian installer.\n\nCopy it into an empty file, save it as control in the DEBIAN folder.\nnote: replace Architecture: amd64 by Architecture: i386  if you use 32bit.\n\n*Run the following command to make your first installer:\ndpkg-deb --build /path/to/ididit_1.0-1\n\nThe Debian installer will be created in the same directory as your project folder.\nNow you can install it by:\nsudo dpkg -i <package>\n\nAnd uninstall it by:\n sudo dpkg -r <package>\n\nIf all went well, you can run it from Dash.\n\nIf you install it by Software Center, it will complain about the \"bad quality\" of the package, since we skipped a number of files etc. To see exactly what the complaints are, you can run in a terminal:\nlintian /path/to/package\n\nAs mentioned, this is only a small instruction on how to make a first working Debian installer. It might encourage you to develop your skills further into creating lintian- proof Debian installers. \nMore to read: Ubuntu packaging guide (and many, many other sources.)\n", "Q: New size of root partition doesn't seem to be recognized I ran out of space on my 20 GB root partition, I resized it to 32GB in gparted but it didn't seem to have created more free space.\nI ran apt-get autoremove and apt-get autoclean, ran bleachbit as well as update-grub.

I've read several posts and tried several suggestions but nothing seems to help the specific hardware I'm using. I'm using a Linksys WPC54G version 3.1, which is a PCMCIA network adapter and a Dell Inspirion 5100 laptop computer. After installation, the wired internet connection works but when I try some of the suggestions I've found to set up the wireless connection, the wired connection drops and I'm unable to re-establish it. This is the fourth time I've reinstalled Lubuntu. Please help.\n\nA: Your card has a Broadcom chip, which the b43 driver runs just fine.  HOwever, the firmware for the chip must be installed by you.  These days, I think the b43-fwcutter package will do the fw install, formerly the linux-firmware-nonfree contained the firmware.  Search this site for Broadcom problems, there are many solutions, but look to the newest ones.\n\nUsing the wired connection:\nsudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter\nThat should do it.  You should see the wireless icon (a pile of arcs) in the top bar, and a left click on it should show the nearby access points.  Click on yours, enter your password, and you should get a connection.  Maybe better to disconnect the wired connection first.\nThe firmware used to be in linux-firmware-nonfree, but it had been removed the last time I looked.\n", "Q: Send a twiter message from the terminal Is there away to send a message form the terminal or write a shell bash file that fill send a message to twiter.\n\nA: Not a one-line answer, but you can use curl and the Twitter API to build a request and post a tweet.

I was running ubuntu 14.04 dual boot on my chromebook just fine.  But when my cousins used my computer they pressed SPACE at the OS Verification is off press space enable on the bootup screen and I can't get into Ubuntu now. \nDid I loose everything? Is it gone? Please help.\n\nA: The same thing happened to me, and to make matters that much more upsetting, the person who deleted my installation, my girlfriend, was present for the installation and said she understood what you must do at each prompt.  After wiping out my installation, she then said she only did what the computer told her to do.\nWe now have a strict rule she is not to use my Chromebook, AT ALL.  An exception will be made if or when I get done printing labels spelling out exactly what to do at each prompt.  The first label will read \"STOP!  Do not do what the computer tells you!\"\nSo, just to be clear, your installation is COMPLETELY GONE.  There is no getting it back.  Please address your complaints to Google for posting instructions on each screen of developer mode which instruct no-nothing-novices to wipe out custom installations.\n\nA: I don't have one, but everything I just read said that pressing space there basically factory resets everything. I believe you will need to reset up developer mode and start again, sorry. \n\nA: Im sorry but your Ubuntu is completely gone you need to download it again and start from scratch. So sudo sh -e Downloads/crouton -t unity or change unity to kde4 of fxe\n\nA: Yes pressing the spacebar will completely wipe the internal drive.\nOne solution is to leave Chrome OS as is and install Ubuntu on a USB 3.0 drive so that you have the best of both operating systems.

What doesn't work? The Apple Remote control, which I lost a long time ago anyways.\nUbuntu 20.04 is very mature for installing onto a 2011 MacBook Pro and everything just works. The GPU's (you can right click an application and choose which video card you want the app to load to), both levels of function keys work, all the lights work, and all the dimming, sound, screen level all work as well.\nI add this here because this thread is very old, however should someone attempt to do this in 2021, you can be rest assured that you will have a compatible working system.

They contain important information for using and administrating packages. \nSo for mysql-server-5.5 there are important information in /usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.5/README.Debian.gz. As it is gzipped, it is convenient to use zmore to read it.\nThere you can see that you can use the debian-sys-maint user to access the database for administration.  Just as root use /etc/mysql/debian.cnf configuration file to login as that user.  Notice that you NEVER should change that users password, unless you also change it in the file debian.cnf.  If not, mysql will stop working.\nSo, to change password for the root user, try this.\n$ sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf\nmysql> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('*secret*') WHERE User='root';\nmysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\nmysql> quit;\n$ mysql -u root -p\n\nIf you can use the *secret* password to login in as user root, you have managed to change the password for root.  \n\nNotice this use of the debian-sys-maint user only works for Debian based distributions.\nNotice also that if you also have the package dbconfig-common installed and set to store the root password (see /etc/dbconfig/config), you need to reconfigure that package so it knows the password to administrat your databases for other packages.\n\nLastly, good information can also be read in Debians Wiki and in the free The System administrators Book\n\nA: First stop the mysql server\n sudo service mysql stop\n\nRun the following command that will start the server again and skip the grant tables which store the passwords.\n mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables\n\nMysql server should now start. Next we log into root without a password. \n mysql -u root \n\nAnd then press enter\nNow we run the following commands in mysql to reset the password \n update user set \n Password=PASSWORD('new-password')\n where user='root';\n flush privileges;\n exit;\n\nNow restart the mysql server \n sudo service mysql restart \n\nYou should now be able to log in with the password you just set \n mysql -u root -p\n\nPress enter and you should get a prompt for root password and it should be accepted. \n\nA: I had this problem and I solved it for me by adding sudo, e.g. sudo mysql -u root -p and using the password set at installation.\n", "Q: apt failing unable to find binary-amd64 tree on all architecture repository I've been rolling together my own deb repository using aptly.

The packages are listed in the amd64 repos with the arch of all. It makes me wonder if I want to start supporting arm in the future; if I need to explicitly state that in the config file (or on the arm debian host, add deb [arch=all] http://repo...). \nI find it odd that by default, apt doesn't actually search all and that you can't really have an arch-less repo for non-processor specific packages (python, java, etc.)\n", "Q: `sudo chmod +x *` caused me cannot open anything Today I used sudo chmod +x * -R in my $HOME folder, actually I didn't want to use it in $HOME folder, it was an accident.

Before you start thinking about doing that please keep reading.\n\nThe free space available in usr/lib directory is around 12GB, which I don't feel is enough for me. Is it possible to change to /home directory?\n\nBeside leaving the installation method Ubuntu uses by default... there are other options ...  \nIf you do not use hibernate and have a largish amount of money you can free up space by deleting swap. You can also resize /home and \"/\" by moving a bit from /home/ to \"/\". You can make a separate partition of /usr/ or /var/ by splitting /home/ into 2 partitions and mounting that other directory in the empty one.\nAnd the is not even mentioning the more simple option of adding a extra hard disk to a desktop.\nThe question you need to answer: if you have a 17Gb \"/\" and you now have still 12 Gb free  ...

In debian 7.5 LXDE wheezy this is really easy to do successfully, but what is wrong in Lubuntu 14.04 to make it so much more difficult?\nAndrew\n\nA: I have managed to duplicate your problem and have a solution.\nAs your research has told you, your original problem was having:\nTerminal=true\n\ntogether with:\nExec=lxterminal -e /bin/hello.sh\n\nThe only problem is, that when you use:\nTerminal=false\n\nthe terminal closes after executing the script, though it does actually run your script. As your script produces so little output it is not humanly possible to see this taking place so it seems like a \"blank screen popping out\".\nAs far as I can see (from man lxterminal and from Google), there is no specific way to ask lxterminal to stay open after it has executed a script, so you have to change the bash script (i.e. your hello.sh) itself.\nFor example you could add either of the following to the end of your script.\n\n\n*\n\n*echo \"Press [ENTER] to exit\" && read\n\n\n*\n\n*The terminal will wait for the user to hit Enter. (In fact to type anything followed by Enter.)\n\n\n*/bin/bash\n\n\n*\n\n*The terminal will stay open.\n\n\n\nFor a discussion of the general problem of stopping the shell from closing after executing a command, including information about other terminal emulators, see: How to run a script without closing the terminal?\nBy the way the semicolon at the end of the Desktop file doesn't do anything, so you might as well remove it.\nSummary: The only change you need to make to your original desktop file is Terminal=false, but you need to add a line to the end of your bash script if you want to see that the script has run.\n", "Q: Light distro for intel atom Looking for a light distro for my small intel atom laptop.\nUses:-\ni happily use ranger,mplayer,luakit,zathura and awesome...don't suggest to use lubunt as it is my last option.\nCannot use or install anything which has no option to connect with 3g dongle out of the box so arch and gentoo are out of my hands.\nMust be compitable to install awesomewm.my laptop ran xubuntu well,just for information,but i want light,stable and fast.salix seemed to me a good option but it doesnot support awesomewm but ratpoison,can do for me but i wasn't sure it has dongle support out of the box..so please suggest the os of my needs..

It is based on Ubuntu and the hardware requirements are low. I use it on my N130 netbook with an Atom processor and it runs pretty fast.\nLinux Lite OS\n\n\nA: I hope this link helps. MaxPup, LXPup or AntiX are also lightweight.\n\nA: My own preference for a lightweight distro is antiX (current version is 13.2, 14 is in beta).  It has a choice of several lightweight GUI desktops (IceWM, Fluxbox, JWM, and WMII) and you can install others (if you have the resources, you can even use KDE), fits on a CD (not a DVD), installs as easily as Ubuntu, and I currently run it on a 300 MHz, 288 MiB RAM Pentium II laptop with 16 GB Compact Flash replacing the original HD (shared with Windows 98, which uses 3 GB) -- it runs pretty well in as little as 128 MiB RAM.\nanitX is based on Debian (as is Ubuntu), and during install gives the choice to use Stable, Testing, or Unstable repositories; Stable is (currently, early 2015) the same base as Ubuntu 14, while Testing is the generation that will become the next Stable (Ubuntu 15) after Canonical makes their own changes to the Debian core.  Unstable is a little riskier, in terms of new updates possibly being broken and breaking your system, but more cutting edge in terms of new developments.  My own antiX installations are both on Testing: they get a hundred or so updates a week, but I'll never have to reinstall or upgrade, so long as Debian continues development with its current process.\nIf your system doesn't have UEFI, installing antiX is as simple as burning the ISO to a CD or installing it on a USB stick or other flash drive, and booting from the media; once the Live session is running, there's a menu option to install antiX, and installing works very much like any other Linux installer (at least from the Debian clan).\nRe: your 3G dongle, I have no experience with that sort of hardware, but antiX happily connects via wifi on a PCMCIA card using wicd, I don't anticipate any issues with the dongle (you might ask on the antiX forum with hardware details to be sure).\n", "Q: Trying To Install Skype On Ubuntu 12.04LTS I have a machine on Ubuntu 12.04LTS I was looking to install skype on this system.

I don't really care if it would make apt-get upgrade two hours longer to finish, I just want to keep working\nwithout the disruptions during the upgrade.\n\nA: The command nice can be used to manipulate process CPU scheduling priorities. The command assigns a \"niceness\" value from -20 (most important) to +19 (least important) to the process. Root can assign any value, other users only positive ones (minor importance). The default value is 0.\nnice -n <niceness> <command>\n\nTo set the priority of an apt-get command to the least value, you can use the command\nsudo nice -n 19 apt-get upgrade\n\n\nTo set the priority of an already running process, the command renice can be used:\nrenice -n <niceness> -p <pid>\n\n\nEdit: Thanks to @David for mentioning the ionice command, which lets you manipulate disk I/O priority. It can put a process into three different classes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Idle only gives the process disk time, if no other process claims it at the moment.\n\n*Best-effort (default class). This allows you to assign priorities from 0 to 7, where 0 is most important and 7 least. You may try assigning -n 7 as the priority level.\n\n*Realtime processes are handled before everything else, suspending disk I/O for other processes, as soon as they require it for themselves. Use with care!\nIOnice combines the syntax of nice and renice:\nionice [-c class] [-n level] command             #To start a new process\nionice [-c class] [-n level] -p pid              #To change a running process\n\n\nBoth commands can be combined, e.g.\nsudo ionice -n 7 nice -n 19 apt-get upgrade      #Omitting the -c switch will assign Best-effort\nsudo nice -n 19 ionice -n 7 apt-get upgrade\nnice -n 19 ionice -n 7 sudo apt-get upgrade\n...\n\n", "Q: What's the difference between `ifconfig`, `interfaces`, `ifup` and `ifdown`? I'm somewhat new to network interfaces and I'm confused with the difference between the 4 terms. I've seen the related question here: What is the difference between Network Manager and 'ifconfig' 'ifup', etc?, but this discusses the difference between all of the above and NetworkManager. I'm looking for something more specific between the 4 terms above.\nI know that interfaces refers to the file at /etc/network/interfaces but all I see there is the lo interface. I would assume that I would see wlan0 and eth0 over there as well, as when I call ifconfig. I also know that the lo interfaces is activated by ifup -a at boot time.\nLooking forward to your explanations.\n\nA: In all the desktop editions of Ubuntu, networking is managed not by manual methods; that is, /etc/network/interfaces, but by Network Manager. Any interface, eth0 or wlan0 for example, that provides networking is, by default, managed by Network Manager.\nThe mostly deprecated commands ifup and ifdown control interfaces that are listed in /etc/network/interfaces. In the case you describe, the usual default configuration, only lo the loopback interface is listed and may be started and stopped with ifup/ifdown, although I consider this inadvisable. Usually, the system does this automatically so that no user intervention is required or expected.\nIn a server, with no graphical desktop, Network Manager isn't installed and so all interfaces are controlled in /etc/network/interfaces. In such cases, the configuration of the file, auto eth0, for example, means that the interface starts on boot. Again, typically no user intervention is required or expected. Here is a sample server configuration: How to connect to the internet\n\nA: /etc/network/interfaces is a configuration file to be manually edited (the mention of loopback (or lo) is from the default file that the installer sets up). You won't see any other interfaces unless you added them there. If you haven't defined interfaces here but they're up and configured, then either some other service, such as Network Manager, Wicd, etc. is handling them, or you have manually configured them using the ifconfig or ip commands.\nifconfig, ifup and ifdown are all commands for manipulation of interfaces. The latter two have specific functions (as can be seen from their names). ifconfig (long since deprecated, but still commonly used) and ip can be used to configure devices (assign IPs, bring them up or down, etc.).\n", "Q: LXC start error : setup_caps: 2337 unknown capability mac_admin When i try to start the lxc container created it fails with below error, I have used the Ubuntu template for this template.\nIt seems lxc is unable to drop the kernel privileges it is trying to drop, tried to figure it out but failed miserably.\ncan someone please help to get this solved.\nUbuntu version : 14.04    \nkernel : 3.13.0-43-generic\n\nError:\nlxc-start: conf.c: setup_caps: 2337 unknown capability mac_admin\nlxc-start: conf.c: lxc_setup: 4172 failed to drop capabilities\nlxc-start: start.c: do_start: 688 failed to setup the container\nlxc-start: sync.c: __sync_wait: 51 invalid sequence number 1. expected 2\nlxc-start: start.c: __lxc_start: 1088 failed to spawn 'lxc-one'\nlxc-start: lxc_start.c: main: 345 The container failed to start.\n\n\nA: Install libcap-dev using\napt-get install libcap-dev\n\nThen, recompile the LXC. \n", "Q: Green bar at right side in full screen VLC As seen in the picture I have a colored bar on the right side of my screen when I watch sth in VLC fullscreen.

Specifically in my case, I could see that /dev/mapper did not contain ubuntu--vg-root or anything else for that matter. This means that something either went wrong when LVM tried to mount/map the volumes OR something went wrong earlier in the boot process, and this error is just a catch-all symptom for any earlier problem.\nThe second of these was the case for me and only because of my reading about initramfs I was able to understand and diagnose the issue. This should be the first thing you do if you suspect something has gone wrong prior to LVM doing its thing.\nIn my case (which may not be the same as you but is worth documenting), I had full disk encryption (LUKS) enabled, and somehow the cryptsetup tools had been removed from initramfs, therefore I was not being prompted for the passphrase to unlock, and the drives were not accessible, which meant that /dev/sdaX could not be mounted, and therefore ubuntu--vg-root could not be mounted/mapped into /dev/mapper. If you try to run cryptsetup from the BusyBox prompt, youll know you have the same issue if thecryptsetup` cannot be found.\nThe solution was to boot from a LiveCD, unlock the drive manually with cryptsetup, chroot into the root filesystem, reinstall cryptsetup and call update-initramfs.\n\nA: For those here suffering from encryption-related problems, as in @Zanna's answer, you'll need to follow a procedure similar to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into your system using a live distro / USB.\n\n*Mount the encrypted partition  (in Ubuntu, you should see the encrypted volume available on the desktop; double-clicking and entering the password should suffice).  The partition will be mounted at /media/ubuntu/[mount point].  (The username will change based on distro; e.g., Xubuntu uses xubuntu.)\n\n*Open a terminal window and a bourbon.\n\n*Set appropriate bindings for mount points within the system:\nsudo su -\nmount -t auto /dev/sdX /media/ubuntu/[mount point]/boot\nmount --bind /dev /media/ubuntu/[mount point]/dev\nmount --bind /dev/pts /media/ubuntu/[mount point]/dev/pts\nmount --bind /sys /media/ubuntu/[mount point]/sys\n\n\n*chroot into the root directory of your encrypted disk: chroot /media/ubuntu/[mount point]\n\n*Ensure that your system has appropriate initramfs packages installed: sudo apt install cryptsetup-initramfs lvm2.\n\n*Critically, you'll also need to ensure that your configuration files force initramfs to include the cryptsetup binaries, which were removed at some point, it seems: nano /etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook, uncomment the CRYPTSETUP line, and make sure it reads CRYPTSETUP=Y.\n\n*Finally, run update-initramfs -u -k all, shut down, pull the live media, and start back up.\nYour mileage here may vary depending on what's happened with your system.  If, for example, you've changed the LVM group name or the UUID, you may need to align /etc/crypttab and /etc/fstab to use the right identifiers.  If, like me, you were migrating from one release to another, you may find that you have two encrypted volumes with the same group name—this makes mounting the disk rather difficult (you need to use the UUID explicitly).\nAll in all, the upgrade to Xubuntu 18.10 was awful because of this.  (A stock system wouldn't reboot once the upgrades to the kernel were pulled in!)  At least in the current setup I have, the system is stable through reboots.\nN.b., the ACPI errors that led me all over the Internet looking for a solution were a red herring:  they have no bearing on whether you can boot from an encrypted disk.\n\nA: Had a very similar issue after an update of Ubuntu 20.04 on a Dell XPS13 (2020).\nSearched for hours, the solution was actually super easy.\nreboot and go to BIOS using \"fn and F2\"\nBIOS > System Configuration > Sata Operation > switch to \"AHCI\" from \"RAID On\"\nFor some reason this BIOS settings was switched.\n\nA: In certain Ubuntu versions (e.g. Xubuntu 18.10) this issue might be caused by an apt autoremove. Due to this bug apt will suggest to remove\ncryptsetup cryptsetup-bin cryptsetup-initramfs cryptsetup-run dmeventd libdevmapper-event1.02.1 liblvm2app2.2 liblvm2cmd2.02 libreadline5 lvm2\n\nwhich makes the system non-bootable (because the root partiation cannot be mounted and unencrypted using LVM).\nIf you are not using LVM and disk encryption this answer is probably not for you.\nI was able to fix it by re-installing cryptsetup and lvm2 in a chroot environment: boot from a live USB stick, run commands below in a terminal, reboot.\n# find root partition\nsudo fdisk -l\n\n# unencrypt partition\n#   Note: replace /dev/nvme0n1p3 with your disk\n#         replace \"nvme0n1p3_crypt\" with the correct name \n#         check by running this in chroot:\n#         $ cat /etc/crypttab | cut -f1 -d \" \"\n#         nvme0n1p3_crypt\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme0n1p3 nvme0n1p3_crypt\n\n# mount root partition\nsudo vgscan \nsudo vgchange -ay\nsudo mount /dev/mapper/xubuntu--vg-root /mnt\n\n# prepare chroot environment\nsudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/boot/   # replace nvme0n1p2 with your boot partition!\nsudo mount -o rbind /dev/ /mnt/dev/\nsudo mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc/\nsudo mount -t sysfs sys /mnt/sys/\n\n# make dns available in chroot\nsudo cp /etc/resolv.conf  /mnt/etc/resolv.conf \n\n# enter chroot\nsudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash\n\n# re-install missing packages\napt install cryptsetup lvm2\n\n# re-generate  (this might be done also by apt in the step before, I'm not sure)\nupdate-initramfs -u -k all\n\n# Leave chroot environment - not sure if the following is really necessary...\nexit\n# Write buffers to disk\nsudo sync\n# Unmount file systems\nsudo umount /mnt/sys\nsudo umount /mnt/proc\nsudo umount /mnt/boot\n\nThis Q&A helped me collecting the commands.\nThis Q&A is kind of related, but maybe not relevant for you anylonger if you are having this issue already.\n\nA: Please add the outputs of lsblk -fs, fdisk /dev/sda with p flag and the report of grub repair to the question as pastebin links.\nBased on searching, there seems to be similar questions on Ask Ubuntu that has no answer up to date here and Here one answer is given which explains about raid and ubuntu.\nThere seems to be several suggestions, some of which seem to work for some people. \n\n\n*\n\n*From the initframs prompt try typing ls /dev/mapper and see if your root volume is listed. If it is not listed, try waiting 10 seconds and run ls again.\nIf it is now listed, type exit and it should now find the root device and boot (taken from here\n\n*Edit the boot config by pressing e when grub alert to choose OS, and replace root=UUID-6500... by root=/dev/sdx where sdx is the boot partition. The problem here seems to be that the UUID is either wrong, or /dev/disk/by-UUID... does not exist(1)\n\n*Adding the parameter all_generic_ide to the end of the boot-line like kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-7-generic root=UUID=43206294-74ef-434d-aca2-db74b4257590 ro quiet splash all_generic_ide seems to work for some people (2)\n\n*The Super User question here, seems to suggest the error is due to LVM. The solution is also given in the same which is to install lvm2.\n\n*The same Super User site also suggests booting using an older Kernel, if available. It seems to work for some people. Trying to boot using the Recovery option might work for some people\n\n*Post by nux_man777 here seems to suggest the error may be in the installation medium.   \n\n*The error /dev/mapper/ubuntu-vg-root seems to be related to raid as described here. \n\"In the installer summary screen right before the copy process starts, click the Advanced button. Change the boot partition (this is the MSDOS-style \"parent\" partition not the Linux partitions) to /dev/mapper/pdc_feddabdf (or whatever dmraid lists as your fakeraid partition) Make sure the checkbox is clicked to boot from this disk. note that the installer will modify grub2 to point to the correct logical partition /dev/mapper/pdc_feddabdf1 or whatever / is on.\"\nDetailed instructions regarding installation is given in the referred site. Please check there for more info on installation of grub.\n\n*Booting into a live installation media and updating ubuntu by changing root using chroot seems to work for some people (suggested by cpttripzz here).\nInstruction regarding chroot is here. You can also refer to this question at Unix & Linux. More details can be found at Arch Wiki and Gentoo Wiki.\n\n*Changing the SATA Controller to Native IDE from RAID and doing a fresh install seems to work for some people here and here\n\n*IDE cable or the hard disk may be bad (the same ubuntu forum as above page 40)\n\n\nA: Try the following:\n(initramfs) reboot\n\nThen, at the OS chooser prompt, try booting with an older kernel.\nIf you succeed, then probably this will fix the problem, as suggested in @One Face's bullets 4 and 5, and the link it refers:\nsudo apt-get install lvm2\n\n\nA: My system couldn't boot after an update and wasn't prompting me to enter my LUKS passphrase for my root partition.

Try it.\n\nA: In my case, booting with the oldest kernel version available in the \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\" menu in Grub worked.\n", "Q: Why is shift-alt being mapped to meta? Some background: I look after the key handling code in the Kodi media centre software, and I've been trying to pin down an obscure bug reported by a user. They have a remote control that emulates a keyboard and for a particular button sends the key combination Ctrl+Shift+Alt+b. The trouble is that the keypress Kodi receives is Ctrl+Shift+Meta+b.\nI've discovered this also happens when I press that key combination on the keyboard, and in fact any combination involving shift and Alt does similar things. The common factor seems to be having Shift and Alt pressed simultaneously.\nI understand that the Meta key was a modifier key on an old keyboard that is no longer used, but that Ubuntu can be configured to generate Meta keypresses. I wonder if there is a setting somewhere in Ubuntu that is causing the Shift+Alt combination to be sent to X clients as a Meta keypress.\nThis is with Ubuntu 14.04, and I get the same behaviour in the standard shell and when using the LXDE shell.\nPlease shout if I've missed out any vital info - I'm a Windows developer and am a bit out of my depth with unix. I haven't gone into the details of the system calls Kodi uses to receive the key presses as I suspect that's more suited to a development site. What I'm primarily interested in is some setting that is user tweakable that might be causing this behaviour.\n\nA: You can disable this behavior by running the following remap command: xmodmap -e \"keycode 64 = Alt_L\". This defines Alt as simply Alt, and not Meta when shifted.\n\nA: I've noticed that if I press Shift+Alt+X, the system sees Meta+X, but if I press Alt+Shift+X, the system sees Shift+Alt+X, so pressing Alt first and Shift second can work around the problem.\n", "Q: Aicrack-ng problem.... monior mode enabled on wlan0mon but airodump causes system log out Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nSo the device goes into monitor mode on wlan0mon but wifi is disconnnected (strange) when I run airodump-ng wlan0mon it starts the scan then runs for a minute or 2 with no results (I am standing right next to my Wifi router) then the system logs me out??? why?

I only get the prompt to erase hard drive or do a manual partition with Ubuntu.\nThere is a 21.5 GB space that says unusable when I go with that, but I don't want to mess anything up with my Windows. This should be simple.\n\n\nA: Based on the screenshot you posted I think that the problem is that there may be only 4 primary partitions on your hard drive and you already have all of them there. Therefore you cannot just easily install Ubuntu because the installation script cannot make any new partition and it do not know what to do so it just offers you only possible solutions. In my opinion you have to delete one manually (and then you can add new extended partition instead) in order to install Ubuntu with \"one click\".\nAll operations with partitions can be made with gparted or during installation. But be aware that your data may be lost - backup!\n\nA: As Byran correctly said, the problem is that you have 4 partitions already. It's a problem that I also met when I installed a Linux OS alongside Windows because I had for Windows the boot partition, the local drive C, local drive D and local drive E. The solution was to delete one local drive and after that I installed the Linux OS.\nSo the advice is to delete manually one partition.\n", "Q: Proper Usage of Num Lock I come from windows, and there I had the habbit of selecting the entire line by using SHIFT+Home.

Either that or you are are using an extension cable rated only for USB-2 speeds.  As you've probably noticed by now A-type USB connectors look the same on the exterior whether they are designed for USB2 or USB3.  As this clever picture shows, there are four additional connectors in A-type USB3 connectors.  it seems to me that if such connectors were not plugged in all way, possibly due to obstruction around the case of a laptop or a misaligned shield on a desktop, then it would almost certainly connect only at USB 2.0 speeds.\n", "Q: 14.04 Mouse and Keyboard issues with a fresh install I have what I think are two unrelated issues with my laptops keyboard and a USB mouse.\nKeyboard:\nWhen I turn on the laptop everything boots up fine. Once I get to the login screen however my laptops keyboard doesn't work. I have been getting around this with a USB Keyboard or the onscreen keyboard. The keyboard only seems to work once I have ran \"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\". It doesnt matter whether there actually are updates or upgrades to be done; but afterwards it works just fine. \nMouse:\nThis one is a little harder to describe.

Using the following command line you can simulate a left click of your mouse:\nxdotool click 1\n\nNow, all you have to do is to add a custom keyboard shortcut for the above command.

I made a recovery disk first of my Windows 8 and saved it on a 8GB USB flash drive (it used 2.6 GB of it).\nThe installation of Ubuntu went flawlessly. After reboot it started with that screen with Ubuntu logo on it, but no GRUB screen as expected, where there should have been the option to choose between Windows and Ubuntu. I tried to find a solution for my problem and found that I need a Boot Repair. I used boot repair several attempts but it partially solved my problem. I now start with a GRUB welcome screen, but there is still no option to choose Windows.\n\nHere you can also see my Boot Repair report.\nAnalyzing what I've done wrong I found that I made a huge mistake with partitioning.

I think it's a pipe dream.\n\n\nI have searched lots of forums and I realized that the TestDisk application may help me to figure out if I have messed up my hard disk. After using TestDisk I've got some results (you can see them in this image gallery), but I don't really know how to interpret them.\nIdeally I would have these priorities to solve this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plan A: It would be great to make the dual boot work, so I could use both systems.  \n\n*Plan B: In case plan A fails, I then prefer to come back to Windows and to be able to recover at least drive D (with the most important data) and C, if possible. \n\n*Plan C: To recover the major part of my data.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately it looks like the problem was that during the install you formatted Windows off the drive. In your Gparted image here notice there is no partition marked as Microsoft or Windows. Not seeing the grub menu on boot is the standard behaviour for a system that only has Ubuntu installed on it. It looks like you will need to restore your Windows and install Ubuntu again.

I plan to install 14.04 on my laptop,and then install Windows 8.1 inside a virtual machine (not yet decide which software for virtual machine).\nWhen I install 14.04, do I need to create some ntfs partitions for Windows (one ntfs partition for installing Windows, and another ntfs partition for storing personal data files which can be shared between Windows and Ubuntu)?\nThanks!\n\nA: No, you do not need to create any NTFS partitions. If you are going to install Ubuntu on your laptop and then install Windows inside a virtual machine, you do not need to create an NTFS partition to install Windows nor would you need to create an NTFS partition to share personal files between Ubuntu and Windows.\nFor the installation, what the virtual software does (for example: Virtual Box or VMWare) is it creates a file (with an extension of .vmdk or .vdi for example, depending on what software/option you use). That file acts as the \"hard drive\" for the virtual machine. The file is created and stored on your host operating system (your Ubuntu), so it doesn't need an NTFS partiton. If you want to think about it another way, \"inside\" the file itself is an NTFS filesystem, that's what the virtual machine uses, but you don't have to worry about that at all.\nFor sharing folders, the virtual software you use gives you an option to share folders between the host and guest OS. When you \"share\" a folder, your Windows machine will \"mount\" it as if it was a file server, so it doesn't need to be an NTFS partition either. Take a look at this page and this question for more information on how you do this folder sharing.\n", "Q: Automake does not find pkg-config macros So I have found that update to a Wine issue regrading Qt5.

Then it additionally starting launching Rhythmbox with different stations or files, over and over.  I have reinstalled 4 times and it keeps happening.  This is a stock laptop with no additional hardware than it came with.  This problem makes the computer unusable for extended periods of time.  Thanks in advance.   \n\nA: It sounds to me like your internal keyboard got wet.  I've found a replacement under $15.\nLikely cause:  Given the season, bringing your laptop in from the cold can cause enough condensation to form on electronics to cause all sorts of misbehavior and even permanent damage.  If that's the case it is impossible to tell if a new keyboard will fix it, or if it could just dry out and work properly given time.  If you think the problem could be condensation you should shut the laptop down, remove all power, including its battery, and stand the lap on edge, lid open, preferably near a heating vent or at least a desk fan to help dry it out.\n(Update below follows comment by OP)\nNext step in diagnostics:\nObviously you seem to think the problem is software, not hardware.  An easy way to find out is to boot the computer to ubuntu on cd/dvd or USB flash media.  If the problem continues then the odds are you are seeing a hardware problem.  If the problem does not continue then you would appear to be correct that the problem is somehow related to Ubuntu, component drivers, or some misbehaving and unwanted update.  Although I've seen incompatibilities between certain brands of computers and Ubuntu, it was never a brand like HP, Dell or Lenovo.  It was always Toshiba.  I like toshiba, but I must assume they are not sharing their firmware or whatever with Linux developers.\n", "Q: Caps-lock indication with conky I have laptop without Caps Lock indicator.\nI'd like to have this indicator in conky.\nWhich conky option can help me to get status of Caps-Lock?\n\n\n*\n\n*OS: Xubuntu 12.04.\n\n*Conky 1.8.1\n\n\nA: {color ffff00}${exec xset q | grep \"Caps Lock:   on\" | awk '{print $4}'}${color}\n\nworks for me.\nPlease note that having too many exec in your Conky could increase demand on your system resources.\nAlso, how soon you see \"on\" depends on the frequency of updating. In other words, it will depend on the value you have set. I update every two seconds:\nupdate_interval 2.0\n\nYou may also want to position where \"on\" appears but that will depend on the rest of your Conky code. For example, what values of gap_x and gap_y you set. I have my minimal Conky at the top of the screen and I use\ngap_x 3\ngap_y 4\n\nalong with\n${goto 500}\n\nprepended to the the actual code so that \"on\" appears near the top center of my screen.\n", "Q: Dual boot (Ubuntu and Windows XP) - Error: No such device XXXXXXX I am completely newbie on Linux. Some years ago I installed Windows XP and Ubuntu on my notebook, in a same HD, properly partitioned.

Btw, I can enter XP after pressing a key.\nPlease, how can I fix it and remove this error message?\nThank you!\n\nA: As described below, my first thought was not correct:\nThe combination of the words \"years ago\" and \"Notebook\" suggest the possibility that your cmos battery could be weak or dead and it may have simply lost its cmos settings.  I suggest you use whatever key is recommended to enter SETUP such as F2 on many brands, be sure to press SAVE SETTINGS when done even if you don't actually make any changes.\nIt turned out not to be the CMOS. Despite my suggestion the hard drive might be failing, which is not unusual after some years in an active laptop, the owner thinks the problem is related to GRUB, so I'm tacking on GRUB repair instructions below.\nThe easiest and most foolproof way to fix your grub is accomplished by opening this link, creating the self booting automated GRUB repair cd and booting to it.\n", "Q: Nvidia GeForce 8600M GT drivers Hello I'm a new user of ubuntu and i can't figure out how to install and where to get the right driver for my Nvidia GeForce 8600M GT hardware. The version of ubuntu that i have is 12.04 and at the moment my resolution is very low and i'd like to have the resolution i had on windows\n\nA: Your best bet is to open \"system settings\" (that's the icon on the left which resembles a gear and a wrench).  Once there click on Additional Drivers.  Ubuntu will take several minutes seeking drivers for any devices which could be better supported.  It might decide some other component needs better support before it gets around to your graphics card.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14-10 warmed my laptop Recently I installed ubuntu 14.10 and I've noted how the temperature grow up (my laptop is hp pavilion dv6-7084la, intel core i7-3610QM, 2.30GHzx8, 8GB RAM). Tipically, when I am working only with firefox, this parameter doesn't descend from 55-60°(C), and, as I start another aplications (like texmaker, amarok, etc.) temperature take values around 75°. Particularly, when I open a txt file with gedit and I write on it, temperature has reached 95°. \nCan someone help me with this?, or it is inevitable the change to another version of ubuntu?\nThank you\n\nA: Graphics card drivers generally causes these kind of heating issues. Go to Unity>Additional Drivers and check whether you are using the latest stable graphics drivers or not. In your case, it is GT630M which has heating issues even with Windows 7 and 8.\nIf you have it installed already the latest drivers and still problem persists, try Option 1.\nOption 1: TLP: There is a similar thread, please go through it first. However, some people are saying that using TLP actually causes their system to overheat further. If that happens to your system, then remove TLP and go to Option 2. \nOption 2: Thermal D + Intel P state: This worked for me, might help you too.\nPS: I have ASUS K55VM which has the same graphics card.

I am running Ubuntu 14.04, Aircrack-ng 1.2 rc1 r2459 - (C) 2006-2014. If you need more information please ask.\n\nA: Using your WiFi adapter to scan for other networks in several channels (this means, in channel hopping mode) prevents you from using your adapter to connect to regular networks.\nYou can't do both at the same time. You either scan for networks and monitor traffic, or you disable airmon-ng altogether and use your WiFi adapter normally.\nThis is the command I use to stop all networking services and starting airmon:\nsudo service avahi-daemon stop ; sudo service network-manager stop ; sudo killall wpa_supplicant ; sudo airmon-ng start wlan0\n\nThis is the command I use to stop airmon and starting all networking services:\nsudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon; sudo service network-manager start; sudo service avahi-daemon start\n\n(Note that \"wlan0mon\" is the new notation for interfaces in monitor mode, starting with version 1.2-RC1. For previous versions, use \"mon0\")\n\nA: You cannot easily put your device into mode managed and monitor (which is needed for aircrack-ng) simultanously. I think some devices support this, but most don't. \nThe problem is that you offcourse can't let your device be connected on a certain standard (n or g or whatever) and simultanously listen to  ALL others, flying around.\n", "Q: Route specific program to specific NIC I have two internet connection, One internet connection has very high latency, it has fluctuation in connection (there is a tree between tower & Wifi CPE, so signal goes up & down) but its fine for downloading as connection never goes to 0. Another one is landline connection, they have strong download limit.\nSo what i want is to use wlan0 for few specific programs like, steam & downloading etc. basically program which consume lot of data.\nAnd i want to use wlan1 for browsing & other stuffs, less data.\nIn short, I want to route specific programs though specific NIC, I don't have specific range of IP's. \nI can connect both of them through wifi as i have 1 extra wifi adapter (wlan0,wlan1), as another option i can connect one with ethernet (wlan0,eth0)\n\nA: It could be possible if your process has something iptables can match against, such as a specific group. For example, given a group to-wifi, you could have iptables rules like so:\niptables -A FORWARD --in-interface wlan0 -j ACCEPT\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -m owner --gid-owner to-wifi --out-interface wlan0 -j MASQUERADE  \n\n(And with forwarding enabled: sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1.)\nThen, if you run, for example, Steam thus:\nsg to-wifi steam\n\nAny traffic from that Steam process (+ any child processes) will be forwarded from whichever interface it was heading through to the wireless interface.\nI have never tried interface-to-interface redirection, but I have used iptables to redirect all TCP traffic from Steam to a proxy by matching against groups, so these rules may not be enough by themselves.\n\nThis could be accomplished by creating groups for each interface and adding yourself to them. For example, using the addgroup and adduser commands:\nsudo addgroup to-wifi\nsudo adduser $USER to-wifi\nsudo addgroup for-eth0\nsudo adduser $USER for-eth0\n\nYou need to re-login for your new group memberships to take effect.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Forwarding traffic between 2 interfaces\n\n*iptables forward all traffic to interface\n\n*iptables forwarding between two interfaces\n\n*How to forward packets between two interfaces?\n\nA: As far as I know, there is no way to do that. \nThis can be done with iptables rules on the specific ports + destinations they use to make their connections, but I'm not aware of a local way to do it.\n", "Q: dual booting problem with ubuntu and windows I have installed ubuntu on computer having already windows 8 but now it is not showing windows option.Whenever I am starting my computer it is directly starting ubuntu.What should I do?\npreviouly I had ubuntu 13.0 I installed ubuntu 14.04 to replace.Please tell how to restore windows option again\n\nA: Go to your Ubuntu, open the terminal and run the following command : \nsudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nReboot.

In most file managers you can just try to open the file and it will show its contents, and from there you can extract it to a folder. Otherwise at the command line you can use the following to extract all the contents. I do this in a folder called src (for 'source') in my home directory, but you can do it anywhere you like.\ntar xvzf [filename]\n\nI've downloaded the driver from the site you mentioned and had a look. So you start with Linux_2302.zip and that contains DPO_RT3070_LinuxSTA_V2.3.0.2_20100422.tgz, right?\nIf you have a look in the archive you will see a text file called README_STA_usb, which has instructions on how to install your driver.\nEDIT: By the way, are you sure your USB adapter won't just plug and play? I've had a look at the README above and it is designed for old Linux kernels.

You never know until you go to gparted or the Windows disk manager.\n\n*/dev/sda1 is a hidden recovery partition on your disk.  You should have some tools inside Windows to burn this data to DVD (which manufacturers are too stingy to give away any more). After burning your 'recovery CDs/DVDs' this partition can be deleted. (refer to the manufacturer's documentation how to do this) This should free up 615MB of disk space.\n\n*/dev/sda2 is your UEFI BOOT partition (you should know by now what that means!) :P  ;-)\n\n*/dev/sda3 is a Microsoft (msft) Reserved (res) Partition: The day you finally decide to completely move over to Ubuntu, this partition can be safely deleted, but for dual-boot purposes do not touch!  ;-)\n\n*/dev/sda4 is your Windows C:\\  drive!  (and that is why you got all these fuzzy \"well, it depends\" Ubuntu answers until now: we just don't know how your manufacturer has installed your disks, nor what you did to your disks afterwards.)\n\n*/dev/sda5 is your Windows E:\\ drive, (very probably) containing your data, excluding media\n\n*/dev/sda6 is your Windows F:\\ drive, (very probably) containing your videos and music and pictures.\n\n\nFinal answer:\nIf I would have your machine, I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a full system backup before starting just in case I made a mistake.\n\n*In Windows:\nUse the correct Windows procedure to move c:\\users to E:\\ data drive (if not already done so) and incorporate E:*.* directories into E:\\Users\\Documents, Favorites, ...\nEnsure [Everyone] has write access to E:\\ (the default)\n\n*Shut down Windows: This is the most important step: Do not hibernate, hybrid hibernate, whatever, but fully shut down the entire machine!\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu CD, Choose \"try\" and then In gparted:\nShrink /dev/sda4 to 128GB by clicking on the right side of sda4 and sliding it to the left.

After upgrading Ubuntu to 14.04, I can't login to windows 7, the GRUB menu loads, but its stuck on loading windows screen. \nInitially, I wasn't able to login to Ubuntu either, but this thread helped me http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2217829, I followed the hakuna_matata's advice on changing GRUB2 boot enry.\nAfter running boot-repair, I got the following http://paste.ubuntu.com/9647860/, while the repair said it was successful, my problem remained.\nI welcome even rough hints, as I'm not sure how to move from this point\n\nA: Ordinarily boot repair solves issues of simple grub issues.  That report you posted revealed a problem I've never seen before, or even heard mention of.  I refer to line 731 which reads, \"Partition 4 does not start on physical sector boundary.\"  The good news is that theoretically this may be something you can fix by yourself using gparted.  It may be as simple as deleting partitions 5 and 6 and then deleting partition 4 as well.  After you do all that you can install Ubuntu again but this time in more traditional manner that should not be prone to these problems.\n\nA: Ubuntu's grub can't make an entry for Windows and that's why grub only boots Ubuntu \nuse the following commands: \nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: Xubuntu - screen flipped upside down I was trying to fix a different problem when suddenly my screen switched upside down - rotated 180 degrees. How can I fix this. I'm on Xubuntu 14.10 and a Dell Latitude e6420.\n\nA: Somehow, the screen settings (xrandr) must have changed to \"inverted\" while you were trying to fix things. \nYou can fix it by running the command:\nxrandr --output <screen_name> --rotate normal\n\nor, (easyer) by simply loging out and back in :)\n\nA: Even easier : xrandr -o normal\n\nA: I just physically rotated my screen, Ubuntu 17.10 probably has some rotating sensors. Probably Gnome tablet program is active.\nIt could be same in the xubuntu 14.10 ! \nOnce it was fixed in the needed rotation I locked the orientation.\nHope it helps someone.  \n", "Q: Automatic shutdown at specified times? I'm aware I can use (sudo?) shutdown -h hh:mm in a terminal window to shut down a system, however the user that is logged in is a kiosk user, which is locked down in such a way that terminal (or any window other than firefox, for that matter) cannot be opened.\nMy question is:\nIs there a way I can do this without having a terminal window opened? I've read about cron, but can't quite work it out.\nHow can I change the shutoff time depending on what day it is?\n\nA: Cron will work very well for this.\nYou need first to find the complete path to the shutdown command:\na@ubuntu:~$ which shutdown\n/usr/sbin/shutdown\n\nKnowing the path to the shutdown command, you can add the below line (with tweaks) to the end of /etc/crontab:\n30 23 * * * root /usr/sbin/shutdown -h now\n\nAt 23:30 (11:30 PM), the kiosk will shut down. No matter what user is logged in, the shutdown command runs as root.\n(If you don't want to use the global crontab, log in as root and use crontab -e.  Use the same above syntax without the root).\n\nCron Format:\nMM HH DD OO WW command\n\nMM: Minute, 0-59\nHH: 24-hour hour\nDD: Day of month\nOO: Month\nWW: Day of Week (Sunday is 0, Monday is 1)\ncommand: Self-explanatory\n\nA: We can shutdown automatically at specified time by simply running command sudo poweroff in crontab.\nIf you want to shutdown the system at 6:30 pm everyday. Type in terminal:\nsudo crontab -e\n\nedit\n30 18 * * * poweroff\n\n\nA: A cronjob seems to be the best way because you can specify different times for different days. \nOn Gnome based systems you can just install GNOME Shedule Tasks  by using\nsudo apt-get install gnome-schedule\n\nand then configure the cronjob using the GUI.\notherwise you would have to use sudo crontab -e and then add the following lines\n30 11 * * 1-5 /sbin/shutdown -h now\n30 10 * * 0,6 /sbin/shutdown -h now\n\nthis would shutdown the PC at 11:30 from Monday to Friday and on 10:30 on Saturday and Sunday.\nThe structure is very simple:\nminute (0-59), hour (0-23, 0 = midnight), day (1-31), month (1-12), weekday (0-6, 0 = Sunday), command \n\nFor more information about this you could also just check out CronHowto\n", "Q: Can I use the previous instructions for the new Eclipse installation?

When I make a Live USB with the Startup Disk Creator application, I usually get this error (which is odd, since it's the default application). But when I make a Live USB with Unetbootin, it almost always works great.\nEDIT\nI just looked up your motherboard. The BIOS has had a bunch of updates over the past few months, which might suggest that there's been some bugs with it. You could try flashing a newer BIOS: http://us.msi.com/support/mb/Z97_MPOWER_MAX_AC.html#down-bios\nEDIT2\nResetting the BIOS by clearing the CMOS RAM has helped me before; maybe it will help you too. Here's an image showing how to do this that I grabbed from the manual of your motherboard:\n\nIf that image is hard to read, it's on page 45 (or section 1-31) of the full manual here: http://dl.msi.com/download_files/mnu_exe/E7888v1.0.zip\nI'm sure you already know this, but make sure you do this with the computer off and unplugged.\n\nA: I managed to fix the problem by unplugging all drives and devices from the pc.

One \"internal\", and one \"external\" that routes traffic through a VPN service. I'd like to be able to connect to the server locally on the internal network, but would want to have VPN traffic to/from the server coming in externally.\nI've never set up a VPN connection before, so I'm unsure if the configuration calls for making a distinction between local/external traffic. I installed OpenVPN and started poking around with the configuration but haven't gotten very far. \nIs there a certain way I should set up my client config in order to retain local non-vpn access to the server from my desktop?\n\nA: The ideal set-up for your design would be:\nThe server connected to its own router with its own IP addressing scheme (E.g. 192.168.2.x/24), the clients connected to their own router using a different IP addressing scheme (E.g. 192.168.3.x/24) and then both routers connected to a tertiary router which connects to the Internet (E.g. 192.168.1.x/24).\nDepending on the capabilities of your current router, you might get away with only two routers or maybe even one router and a switch depending on what hardware you have/wish to purchase and what are you trying to accomplish...\nIf you just drop the second network card from your server, most consumer-grade routers allow you to put the server in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) without any of the above hassle...

Remove any shortcuts you do not want.\nThis may not work for the WiFi key though.\nEDIT\nYou could also try seeing if there's an option in the BIOS to change them. When you start your computer, at the very first screen where it says your manufacturer logo (HP), it should say something like F2 to enter setup. Press F2 at that time and it should take you into BIOS (which is a fancy name for the hardware options of your computer).

On the machine, when I select boot from USB, it gives me the error, \"An operating system wasn't found. Try disconnecting any drives that don't contain an operating system.\"\n\nA: Saving the Ubuntu ISO file into your USB key is just like saving any file. That is why you get that error.\nYou rather need to create a bootable USB key so that you ca install Ubuntu 12.04 and avoid that essage error.\n\nA: You can also try UNetBootIn - it works fine too.

They don't report their PAE support to the kernel, so the installer may ask you to install the non-PAE version of Ubuntu.\nThis can be \"fixed\" (circumvented) by telling the kernel to assume that PAE is supported, even if it can't see it. To do so, you need to add the forcepae argument to the boot parameters, which forces the kernel to assume PAE is present and use it.\nOpen the file /etc/default/grub in a root text editor and change the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" # May contain other values\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash forcepae\"\n\nThen save, exit and run sudo update-grub to include this into the boot loader. Afterwards reboot.\nAfter a reboot, you should be able to install the kernel update, since the current kernel now reports the presence of PAE, and thus APT now allows the installation of the kernel update.\n", "Q: Multiple monitor mirrored as default I've a laptop with intel graphic card and at home I connect it on an external monitor.\nIs there a way to have monitors mirrored by default?\nNow every time I boot I've to re-configure in this way.\nthanks!\n\nA: 1. Clean and simple\nI think the cleanest and easiest would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out both screen names with the help of xrandr (look for the string \"connected\")\n\n*Open System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\nxrandr --output <screen_name1> --auto --same-as <screen_name2>\n\nTo a key combination of your choice.\nThat way you would only have to press the key combination to activate mirrored screens.\n2. Without having to look up the screen name\nA bit more sophisticated would be to do the same, but let a script find out both screen names:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\noutput = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\nconnected = [output[i-1] for i in range(len(output)) if output[i] == \"connected\"]\ncommand = \"xrandr --output \"+connected[0]+\" --auto --same-as \"+connected[1]\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\nSave the script as mirror.py, run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/mirror.py\n\nunder a key combination, like in the first option.\n3.Fully automatically\nIf you want it all done without any action from your side, run the script below in the background. It checks every 5 seconds if a second monitor is connected and sets it to mirrored if so.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ndef screens():\n    output = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    return [output[i-1] for i in range(len(output)) if output[i] == \"connected\"]\n\ntodo = True\n\nwhile True:\n    scr = screens()\n    if len(scr) == 2 and todo == True:\n        command = \"xrandr --output \"+scr[0]+\" --auto --same-as \"+scr[1]\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n        todo = False\n    elif len(scr) == 1 and todo == False:\n        todo = True\n    time.sleep(5)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as mirror_screen.py\n\n*Test it by restarting your laptop (screen disconnected)\n\n*Run the script by the command:\npython3 /path/to/mirror_screen.py\n\n\n*Connect the second monitor to see if it automatically switches to mirrored.\n\n*If all works fine, add the command (above) to your startup applications: \nDash > Startup Applications > Add \n\n", "Q: Evolution: How to change default sort criteria in address book?

This creates a C++ Ubuntu application project with a sample UI containing a Label and a Button (Needs a 15.04 Kit).\nWhat I don't understand is how to make the QML user interface communicate with the C++ code.

For the Ubuntu Touch app I need a QML interface to interact with the C++ code.

I use a normal USB mouse.\nUsually, it works fine, but today (after hours of normal usage), I'm having this weird behavior, which I've had once before in the past:\nI can't click on anything on my laptop screen (that's on the right-hand side), except the side and top bars - I can move the mouse all over the place, but there is no mousover or click events on any window on the laptop screen (things work fine on the external monitor).\nAnd if I click on the Dash search, I get the search results full page, and the mouse works fine there (there are reactions on mousover and I can click). So it's as if there was this invisible window running above all the others, absorbing all the clicks, but that can still be overlapped by dash like all windows can (nothing of the like appears if I alt-tab around).\nAnd if I unplug my desktop screen, clicking works fine on the laptop (and goes away once I plug it back in). And if I open the system settings and move the (virtual) relative position of my screens around, the problem will only appear on the right-side screen, whether it's the laptop or the external monitor. If I put the two virtual screens one above or below the other, I can click everywhere just fine, until I put the screens back next to each other - so it does really seem to be the \"right hand side\" going wrong, not the laptop screen itself.\nLast time this went away when I closed my session and reopened it (locking it is not enough). I don't really know what more I could do to troubleshoot this.\nEdit: clicking suddenly started working again once I finished posting this. Despite the fact that I did nothing \"special\" (I clicked on a chrome gmail window with a notification?), and had tried dozens of things while writing the problem report.\n\nA: I had the same problem [Xenial], which seemed to be triggered by starting VirtualBox (though that could be a red herring).\nI fixed it by \nunity --replace\n\nThough that doesn't explain why it happened in the first place...\nWARNING - this will close all your open applications, so save everything first!\n\nA: I think I found a solution for this. I was having the same issue, unplugging and plugging the second monitor did nothing to solve to problem in a long term, so I tried other options regarding configuration.\nI noticed that my laptop had a default resolution of 1366x768 and usually the second monitor has less than that.

I doubt my hardware matters, but I'm on a lenovo yoga 2 pro.\nIdeas?\n\nA: I am not sure what Syndeamon is or should do, but it could very well be that it is started too early, and crashes because the desktop is not fully loaded yet. \nWhat you can do is to add a small pause of 10-15 seconds to the start up command.\nTo do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the automatically created .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart (drag it over a gedit window)\n\n*Replace the line, starting with \nExec=\n\nchange it into:\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10&&/usr/bin/syndaemon -i 0.5 -d -K\"\n\nYou can experiment a bit with the time to optimize it.\nExplanation\nSome commands break if you add them to startup applications, because they need a fully loaded desktop to run succesfully, and Startup Applications runs the commands too early. \nTouchpad- related commands are in that category, and then you need to add a little break after startup to make it work.\nSince Startup Applications creates a .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart to run the startup command, you need the \"regular\" syntax to add a complicated command to be used in a .desktop file, which is in this case:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15&&syndaemon -i 0.3 -d -K\"\n\n\nA: Search for and open Startup Applications from the Dash.

I don't truly understand what i would use that for and i am wondering, i have script coded a gaming server for Garry's Mod and i was wondering what this server would be used for ?                         \n\nA: Ubuntu Server is an operating system meant for dedicated servers, computers that are used for nothing but being a server. Ubuntu Server would be pretty good for running a Garry's Mod server (I've done it!). However, I like Debian more for servers because of the increased stability and easier upgrades. Ubuntu Server does not come with a desktop environment, so unless you consider yourself an advanced user and know how to do everything from the terminal (which includes configuring your network, which I find pretty difficult), you might want to get a lightweight Ubuntu distro and run your Garry's Mod server off that. If you want a very light GUI so your Garry's Mod server will perform better, I recommend getting the latest LTS release of Lubuntu. If you know how to use Debian (which is very similar), you may want to get Debian wheezy with LXDE. You can remove the desktop manager (usually LightDM) so that when your computer starts up you're at a shell, and you can type startx to access LXDE only when you need it. You know, to save resources and stuff when you don't need a desktop environment. You can start it up only when you need to change something that would be hard from the terminal. Ubuntu Server has a few kernel tweaks to it that makes it perform better than Ubuntu Desktop when running server applications. However, if you're running a Garry's Mod server which requires a lot of processing power and a little less focus on networking, I don't think you'll notice much of a difference.\n", "Q: Latest updates on ubuntu 14.10 Since I upgraded to ubuntu 14.10 , I didn't received any update.\nWhen I tape :\nsudo apt-get update\nIt says that my system is up-to-date\nWhen was the last time you received an update on the ubuntu 14.10 ?\nThanks\n\nA: Although I have not received an update for 3 days, you should be sure to run both sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade together, as one gets new package versions, and one actually installs the updates.\nI generally get updates at least every week, if you don't, try switching your mirror back to the main ubuntu repository in your software and sources.\n", "Q: Issue with ubuntu and bluetooth mouse and keyboard I have a bluetooth mouse & keyboard (Dell KM714) that don't seem to be recognized by Ubuntu 14.10.

I decided to trust in your word tat you are the best OS in the world.**strong text****\n\nA: The reason you could not open the .exe executable is that the utility you were trying to install was made for Windows, not Linux.  If you want to watch videos in a particular format, you almost certainly can, but you must use the correct utilities made for Linux.\nAs I understand the matter of ActiveX, that's a utility that works only with windows.  However there are EQUIVALENT utilities to allow users of Mac and Ubuntu to view the same media.  I've been using Ubuntu for 9 years and I've never encountered a video I could not open because I didn't have the right viewing software, or at least if I did, downloading the correct viewer took only a few minutes.\nI have been to your www.usadisk.com page and found that my only difficulty was trying to watch any media without logging in.  Google translate could only handle so much, and so I gave up.  If you can direct me to a video of the type you are concerned with, which you cannot view currently, and which I can open without logging in, please direct me to it and I will attempt to open it.

When I SSH into the server using PuTTY, the connection never times out. I stay connected indefinitely and am not disconnected. When I SFTP in, however, I am disconnected after roughly five minutes or so of no activity. The specific message is Disconnected from server.\nThe guides I have found (1 and 2, among others) say to add ServerAliveInterval 60 to /etc/ssh/ssh_config or to add ClientAliveInterval 60 to /etc/ssh/sshd_config. I tried both of these but neither has worked--I still receive the \"Disconnected from server\" message.\nFileZilla has an option to keep FTP connections alive, and that would make things simple, but a) that option is in the FTP section (not the SFTP section), and b) directly underneath the option it says that proper servers do not require that option to be set and to contact the server admin if the option is necessary.\nWhat do I need to do to set my server so that SFTP connections are indefinitely kept alive?\n\nA: The sftp protocol does have a keep alive features but they are not exposed in the filezilla client.\nStill I don't believe such a setting should be necessary.\nI'm failing to reproduce your problem. I have had a Filezilla connection open to my Ubuntu ssh server for over 20 hours without any disconnects.\nSo I believe that problem is network related.

Should work, but no luck here, either, with the following process:\n$ sudo input-kbd 4 > keymap # note the 4 is from /dev/input/event4\n# edit the keymap to map any combination of keys to either 0 or 240 (KEY_UNKNOWN)\n# e.g. change this:\n# 0x700e0 =  29 # KEY_LEFTCTRL\n# to this:\n# 0x700e0 =   0 # KEY_LEFTCTRL\n# or this:\n# 0x700e0 = 240 # KEY_LEFTCTRL\n$ sudo input-kbd -f keymap 4\n$ sudo input-kbd 4 # should return the updated keymap\n\nAfter doing this, the keymap shows no change.\nxkbcomp\nThis was suggested by X input hacker Peter Hutterer, certainly a man who should know what he was doing. Still, no luck:\n$ xkbcomp -xkb $DISPLAY t630.xkb\n# edit the keyboard description and replace the definition of any key to NoSymbol or VoidSymbol\n# e.g. change this:\n#     key <LCTL> {         [       Control_L  ] };\n# to this:\n#     key <LCTL> {         [       NoSymbol   ] };\n# or this:\n#     key <LCTL> {         [       VoidSymbol ] };\n$ sudo xkbcomp -i 8 t630.xkb $DISPLAY # here the 8 is the id in xinput, names don't work\n$ xkbcomp -xkb -i 8 $DISPLAY - # should return the updated keyboard description\n\nAfter doing this, the keyboard description shows no change. \nPeter felt that this was likely due to the fact that X is confused as to the nature of the device as a keyboard or a mouse, kind of like this bug that has the opposite problem. This may explain why all the other expected items don't work. However, he also said that using evdev should not work for the same reason.\nevdev\nIt seemed at first to work, but it doesn't either. This attempts to leverage the generic input driver for X to set the button mapping by appending the following to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf or /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf:\n# custom for Logitech Ultrathin Touch mouse\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier \"Logitech bluetooth Touch Mouse\"\n    Driver \"evdev\"\n    Option \"Name\"   \"Ultrathin Touch Mouse\"\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier  \"Ultrathin Touch Mouse\"\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nThis seems to work without errors in /var/log/Xorg.0.log (using grep EE), and xinput confirms the button mapping, but it doesn't result in the desire effect.\nThis is known to work for the T631, however.\nkeyboard events\nThe problem lies, I think, in the fact that these gestures generate keyboard events:\n$ sudo evemu-record /dev/input/event4 | grep \"E: \"\n# swipe edge right\nE: 0.000000 0004 0004 458976    #

Needless to say, further commentary on the subject is officially offtopic on that bug report, but the references may help add some perspective on the nature of this issue.\nHere's the output of evemu-describe /dev/input/event4 FWIW.\nBluetooth adapters\nFWIW I've used two different USB Bluetooth adapters:\n$ lsusb | grep Bluetooth\nBus 007 Device 010: ID 0a12:0001 Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode)\n$ lsusb | grep Bluetooth\nBus 007 Device 011: ID 0a5c:21e8 Broadcom Corp. BCM20702A0 Bluetooth 4.0\n\n\nA: After a lot of pain, I managed to create a key map that does something useful.\nFirst a couple of notes (I cannot comment yet) on the previous answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*the fixMouse script provided by Mr back-up does not work, because sometimes the Keyboard entry of the mouse appears with the wrong name in xinput, i.e. in my case it shows:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n...\n⎜   ↳ Ultrathin Touch Mouse                     id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n\n...\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\non the other hand you can use lsinput from input-utils to find the correct id:\nlsinput 2>&1|grep -B5 \"Ultrathin Touch Mouse\"\n/dev/input/event12\n   bustype : BUS_BLUETOOTH\n   vendor  : 0x46d\n   product : 0xb00d\n   version : 1792\n   name    : \"Ultrathin Touch Mouse\"\n\n\n*for some reason when dumping the map for the mouse, some codes are duplicated (those between 0x700e0 and 0x700e7), be careful to find and eliminate them, or you wil go crazy.\n\n*replacing all the keycodes with KEY_UNKNOWN prevents the bursts of random characters, but renders the special touch actions useless. I found instead that you can remap some of the gestures to useful combinations. In particular the \"swipe in from left\" sends the codes 0x700e0+0x700e3+0x7002b, while the \"swipe in from right\" sends 0x700e3+0x700e3+0x70072. I mapped 0x700e3, which is common to both gestures, to KEY_UNKNOW, to get it out of the way. Then I used the remaining key codes to make CTRL+F8 (desktop grid) and ALT-F2 (runner), but of course you can generate any combination of any two keys. Here is my map, be careful when copy/pasting to leave no empty lines and no initial blank spaces (they break input-kbd):\n0x700e3 = KEY_UNKNOWN\n0x700e0 = KEY_LEFTCTRL\n0x7002b = KEY_F8\n0x700e2 =

not care because those gestures are impossible to perform.\nP.S. In case you want to try to customize other gestures, here is how I proceeded: \n\n\n*\n\n*I sorted the map entries, cleaned up the duplicates, and  noticed that it \ncomprises 252 symbols (plus 5 buttons). \n\n*I set the first ten symbols to KEY_A, the following ten to KEY_B and so on until the last 2 which became KEY_Z; then I loaded this map. \n\n*I perform the gestures in a text windows (or you can use \"xbindkeys -mk\") and take note of the letters produced. \n\n*In the map I change all the letters NOT produced to KEY_UNKNOWN, the three remaining to KEY_A, KEY_B, KEY_C.. KEY_Z, KEY_1,.., KEY_4, then I load this new MAP. \n\n*I perform the gesture again, take note of the letters/numbers produced: this are the codes that can be defined to whatever you need to make a specific key combination.\n\nA: To disable the gestures, you can change the button mapping with the evdev driver so that the last 6 \"buttons\" are all disabled like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*appending the following to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf or /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf depending on what you have:\n# custom for Logitech Ultrathin Touch mouse\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier \"Logitech bluetooth Touch Mouse\"\n    Driver \"evdev\"\n    Option \"Name\"   \"Ultrathin Touch Mouse\"\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier  \"Ultrathin Touch Mouse\"\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\n\n*restarting the X server with sudo service lightdm restart\n\n*confirm with xinput --get-button-map \"Ultrathin Touch Mouse\"\nYou can change the value of the InputDevice Identifier if you want, but it's important to keep the value for InputDevice Name and InputClass Identifier as \"Ultrathin Touch Mouse,\" since this is how xinput recognizes it.\nTested with the Mac version, T631.\nIf you want a little more information on evdev, this blog post by Joe Shaw is particularly insightful about how it fits into the whole input stack.\n\nA: You could try to use input-kbd from the input-utils package:\n$ apropos input-kbd\ninput-kbd (8)        - print or modify keyboard maps for input devices\n\nUsing the input device index (e.g. 4 for /dev/input/event4, which can be found via lsinput which is necessarily different than the id used in xinput), you can reconfigure the keyboard map by feeding it a file with the -f switch, e.g.\n$ sudo input-kbd -f some-file 4\n\nwhere the some-file takes the form of scancode = keycode|keyname, where the following are equivalent:\n0x0001 = KEY_F9\n0x0001 = 67\n\nYou can find the current map with sudo input-kbd 4. Since you need to open a file from /dev, you do need to use superuser to event read this.\nAlso note despite it's apparently misleading name, it does work with mice, too.\n\nA: I managed to configure the \"left edge swipe\" and \"right edge swipe\" gestures using xbindkeys; this can probably apply also to the two finger swipes, but I did not bother with those as I find them difficult to perform anyway.\nThis is my .xbindkeysrc\n    #Right edge swipe (Send Alt+F2)\n    \"xte 'keydown Alt_L' 'key F2' 'keyup Alt_L'\"\n     Alt+Mod4+XF86TouchpadOff\n    #Left edge swipe (Send CTRL+F8)\n    \"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key F8' 'keyup Control_L'\"\n     Control+Mod4 + Tab\n\nI've mapped them to useful KDE shortcuts, of course you can do anything else.\nYou need to run xbindkeys at login, I've created a .desktop file as explained in any xbindkeys tutorials:\n    #./.config/autostart/xbindkeys.desktop\n    [Desktop Entry]\n    Comment[en_GB]=\n    Comment=\n    Exec=xbindkeys\n    GenericName[en_GB]=\n    GenericName=\n    Icon=system-run\n    MimeType=\n    Name[en_GB]=\n    Name=\n    Path=\n    StartupNotify=true\n    Terminal=false\n    TerminalOptions=\n    Type=Application\n    X-DBUS-ServiceName=\n    X-DBUS-StartupType=\n    X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false\n    X-KDE-Username=\n\nHTH\n\nA: I got frustrated at this thing because I never could get it to work, despite all the solutions provided, including those provided by someone who actually writes X input code. That said, I walked away from it and just used a normal, corded mouse.\nYesterday I found the Ultrathin and decided to try it out again and it Just Works™. This is true at least in the sense that the reason for this question is that these gestures were being interpreted in strange ways and messing with my workflow. Now they seem to have no real effect, except that the left edge swipe allows me to swap between last used tabs in Firefox. \nWhat's odd is that in no way are the gestures actually disabled. All 13 \"buttons\" are returned by xinput --get-button-map \"Ultrathin Touch Mouse\". Also grep Ultrathin /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d returns nothing. There's no relevant NoSymbols (and no VoidSymbols at all) found with xkbcomp nor any relevant KEY_UNKNOWNs with input-kbd.\nOn the other hand, everything looks the same in evemu-record except for the fact that the double tap gestures are just taken as simple BTN_LEFT events.\nThat said, something has changed in relation to this, but I'm not sure what.\nAlso, I haven't tested remapping things, but that wasn't really in the scope of the original question.\n\nA: I've read all the answers, and I've written a script around input-kbd (part of input-utils) to auto-fix this issue.\nYou should run fixMouse from this repository once every login.  It will:\n\n\n*\n\n*listen to dbus for this mouse\n\n*configure all the keystrokes to KEY_UNKNOWN\n\n\nStandard mouse features (left button; scroll; etc.) still work fine.  Only the weird keyboard keys are stopped.\nIt survives suspend, bluetooth sleep, mouse on-off, etc.\nIt works for me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu USB installation Am trying to download Ubuntu onto USB drive as advised but every time I download & go to Browse, it never shows in Window to select.

Instead I'd recommend you to use PhotoRec directly on Windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the PhotoRec/TestDisk download page\n\n*Download the latest Windows (not Windows 64-bit) beta build\n\n*Extract the downloaded archive\n\n*Run the file qphotorec_win.exe inside of the extracted folder as administrator\n\n*In the dialog:\n\n*\n\n*Select the disk and partition you'd like to recover\n\n*Select \"FAT/NTFS/HFS+/RaiserFS/...\" as \"File system type\n\n*Select \"Whole: Extract files from whole partition\"\n\n*Use a new directory as output directory on some other HDD that has as much free space as you can afford (3x the size of the source volume is the recommended value)\n\n*Start analyzing by pressing the \"Search\" button\n\n\n\nOf course you should check out Ubuntu anyways! :-P\n", "Q: Nvidia Drivers Installation I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my new PC, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to install the nvidia drivers i need for my graphics card. I've tried going to searching for my driver in the additional driver section but nothing comes up and I don't know were to go from here. \n\nA: In just the past few months there have been some changes to how drivers are handled. In some cases, graphics cards that are handled by native Ubuntu drivers don't appear to the user, but are still active.  Only go out of your way to install extra drivers if you are sure your graphics card is not performing as expected.  \nHere's another tip.  If you install STEAM (from your Ubuntu Software Center) it may recommend and direct you to particular drivers for your card which you were not introduced to previously.  I suspect that this is an added feature of STEAM to help ensure their games will perform well on your system.\nOne last thought.  You mentioned NEW PC.  Depending on how recently your nvidia card/chipset was released, it is possible Linux drivers are not yet available for it.  Or you may find them but only at this nvidia page.\n", "Q: Geany error 127 when programming in C Error running C program compiled with Geany IDE Error Code: 127\nHey, I am running ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Geany 1.23.1.

I was able to fix this by running the following command to set the cursor theme after setting it from Ubuntu Tweak Tool. \nsudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme\n\nThe output of the command was as follows: \n\n$ sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme\nThere are 7 choices for the alternative x-cursor-theme (providing /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme).\n\n  Selection    Path                                       Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n  0            /usr/share/icons/DMZ-White/cursor.theme     100       auto mode\n  1            /etc/X11/cursors/core.theme                 30        manual mode\n  2            /etc/X11/cursors/handhelds.theme            20        manual mode\n  3            /etc/X11/cursors/redglass.theme             20        manual mode\n  4            /etc/X11/cursors/whiteglass.theme           20        manual mode\n  5            /usr/share/icons/DMZ-Black/cursor.theme     30        manual mode\n  6            /usr/share/icons/DMZ-White/cursor.theme     100       manual mode\n* 7            /usr/share/icons/mac-cursors/cursor.theme   90        manual mode\n\nPress enter to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:\n\nAnd this made me wonder where to put the cursor themes, why the priority of each one is different and what the manual vs. auto mode standed for. Moreover, I was not sure where to put the GTK or icon theme files and I preferred to put them under ~/.icons and I also have an unhidden ~/icons directory containing tar.gz versions of various themes together with a themes directory (also containing themes in tar.gz format) in my home folder. I do not remember as of now if I put them myself or the system created them. I would be grateful and appreciate it if someone could explain how update-alternatives work and where are the various themes stored usually? Also in my opinion Ubuntu Tweak Tool is not that successful at changing themes, is there an alternative for that?\n\nA: To install a new theme it would suffice to copy it to ~/.local/share/themes, and activate it using Unity Tweak Tool. Running update-alternatives won't be necessary.\nSome themes are available via PPAs. Numix for example.\nPPAs usually install them in /usr/share/themes and /usr/share/icons/, so it seems to me that your ~/icons folder is one created by yourself \nFurthermore .$HOME/themes and $HOME/icons paths are deprecated and will not be read in future releases.\n\nA: It install a theme here is what you need to do:\n> tar xf package.tar.gz\n> sudo mv package /usr/share/themes\n\nto activate, open Unity Tweak Tool (UTT), and go to Appearance and then Theme. And select your desired theme (package)!\n\nA: In order to get a consistent mouse cursor over all the open windows the following settings are necessary: \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you copied the theme under /usr/share/icons/desired_theme\n\n*Under this directory there should be an cursor.theme file and it should contain the following(The Inherits line is the most important):\n[Icon Theme] \nName = Hackneyed \nComment = Windows 3.x-inspired cursors \nExample = default \nInherits = Hackneyed\n\n\n*Then the following commands should be run:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme x-cursor-theme /usr/share/icons/desired_theme/cursor.theme 50\nsudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme \"desired_theme\"\nAssuming the theme is already copied under /usr/share/icons for global usage or under home directory as depicted by @reversiblean.\nEDIT Ubuntu Tweak Tools can also be used to accomplish the second step. However, first step can only be done on the CLI. I could not make some of the parts in coding format.\n", "Q: How to remove icons from ''all applications''? I installed Star Wars: Battlefront 2 through Wine and then I uninstalled it. But icons for that game are still in my all applications panel. There is icon for another game also. \nI want to remove those icons. How do I do that ? \nI am using Linux Ubuntu GNOME (14.10).\n\nA: Certain desktops come with a menu editor, in which you could remove the entries.\nElse, open the directory .local/share/applications/ in a terminal or file browser and remove the .desktop files you don't need any longer.\n\nA: All the applications exist as .desktop files in /usr/share/applications\nTo remove a particular entry -\ncd /usr/share/applications\n\nsudo rm <name-of-application>.desktop\n\n\nA: Please open system settings, then along its top, Privacy.  When you delete recent activity, you delete recently run applications from that section of your \"all applications\".  In fact it is only because those now deleted programs were recently run that they are listed there at all.\nIf you examine the function of your \"all applications\" display more, and come to understand it, you will be less frustrated with it.\n\nA: I had a problem alike an solved. The answer about the intruder icon in the \"all applications\" that ensures the file responsible is the name of the icon with the extension .desktop prove to be correct.\nBut the desktop file is not always in the /usr/share/applications/ directory; it could be in another place. So the general way to solve this is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Open \"files\", go to \"other locations\" at the end of the list, click \"computer\".\n\n*Click the search button (look for the magnifying glass); the word \"computer\" will disappear and will wait for your input.\n\n*Enter the name of the icon and add \".desktop\" to it, press enter key.\n\n*You should find the  file and the name of the directory where it is located.\n\n*Right click the file found and select \"Open Item Location\"\n\n*In that directory you might find several files, but the one that you are interested in is usually selected by default.\n\n*You may just delete the file or use the long way of removing it from terminal.\n\nIMPORTANT: after you done everything, restart your device so that the changes are made in \"all applications\"\n\nA: it is too easy but it is looks too hard really. I searched everywhere how to do it but found no accurate answers at all.\nWhat I did was:\n\n*\n\n*Open the files application\n\n*Click on the search bar and search the name of the application\n\nSurely you will find the application name with .desktop extension. Delete that file completely but if it is not showing than you will surely see a folder with the name of the application.  In that folder you will see the application with .desktop extension. Delete that and it's done.\n", "Q: How can I repair GRUB in a dual boot with Windows 8.1? My Thinkpad runs Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.4 on dual boot.

How can I make the OS to proactively swap out the un-accessed pages to the swap device?\n\nA: Use the ram for something else.

When I unplug it says that I have low battery and approximately 20 minutes of usage. Why? \nThanks \n\nA: Usually a laptop battery is composed of few battery cells. Same way, your battery will be made of some battery cells. Few of those cells might be dead now. That is the problem.\nTo make you much more clear, I can say like this. Lets say that your battery have 6 battery cells in it. When you bought it, all the 6 cells would have been alive. So it would have taken much time to get 100% charged. As well, it would have been taken more time to give a low battery warning. Lets say that 4 of your battery cells are damaged now. So your battery just have 2 live cells. Now, a very less time is enough to get your 2-cell-battery charged completely. Since it is a 2-cell-battery it drains much faster than your original-undamaged-battery.

It also\n  ignores events on virtual and kernel file systems such as sysfs, proc,\n  and devtmpfs.\nIts main purpose is to find processes which keep waking up the disk unnecessarily and thus prevent some power saving.\nBy default, events are reported to stdout. This will cause some loops if you run this tool in e. g. gnome-terminal, as this causes a\n  disk access for every output line. To avoid this, redirect the output\n  into a file.\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n     A typical event looks like\n   rsyslogd(875): W /var/log/auth.log  \n   compiz(1971): O device 8:2 inode 658203\n\nThe line has the following fields:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Process name. This is read from /proc/pid/comm, and might be abbreviated for long process names.\n  \n*Process ID\n  \n*Event type: Open, Read, Write, or Close. Combinations are possible, such as CW for closing a written file.\n  \n*Affected file. In some cases the path and name cannot be determined, e. g.  because it is a temporary file which is already\n  deleted. In that case, it prints the devices' major and minor number\n  and the inode number. To examine such a process in more detail, you\n  should consider using strace(1).\nIf you specify the --timestamp option, the first field will be the current time.\n\n", "Q: Xubuntu service send data over serial port when i open a serial terminal (i.e. minicom) some data are send automatically from my pc to the device, these data are:\nAT+GMI ~x�~ ~x�~\n\nI know that by default there is a modem client doing this kind of pairing/handshaking/syncing, i have already removed it from another pc, but i forgot the name, can someone say me which one is?\n\nA: The problem was generated by the modemanager package, i have not find a way to disable it, if you want to remove the manager simply do:\nsudo apt-get purge modemmanager\n\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.10 update error I can't update, i have this error when running apt-get update command!\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/cooperjona/nitrotasks/ubuntu/dists/utopic/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/cooperjona/nitrotasks/ubuntu/dists/utopic/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

An “MM” means muted, and “OO” means unmuted.\nThis was the problem I had once.\n\nA: Another option to what Babbzzz answered is to use GNOME ALSA Mixer. It's the exact same thing as the terminal program alsamixer but it is a GUI version.\nSimply run sudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer in Terminal (or search for/install it in the Software Center/Synaptic.) Once installed you should be able to launch it from the HUD menu.\nIt provides all the same functions of ALSA Mixer, just in a GUI form - some people may prefer this:\n\n", "Q: Not accepting the crypt disk password at boot to unlock the disk for ubuntu 14.04 This is really a major issue. Check what happened. Please Help me with a solution...\nI had windows 7 installed in my laptop. I decided to install ubuntu 14.04 and remove windows 7. So while installing ubuntu 14.04 i selected remove windows 7 and install ubuntu (2nd option).\nI selected cryptdisk option while installing and set a password. \nLater after installation i couldn't find my old partition and data. So I tried to check the partition and other settings. During this I shutdown my system and started again. (Remember never clicked restart instead used shutdown)\nAfter a research i found testdisk software which can help for recovering partitions. I did it and found my partition and i selected to write the MBR to disk. After this testdisk asked me to restart to take effect. \nSo I restarted the system (Notice this time i clicked restart icon). After this when the system restarted I entered the same cryptdisk password at ubuntu boot screen. but it didnt except and gave error: \"requested offset is beyond real size of device ....\" cryptsetup: cryptsetup failed, bad password or options?\"\nPlease someone help me with this... Waiting for a good response. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: What worked for me was reinstalling Ubuntu 14.04 and only using lowercase letters and a shorter password.

Its possible to do some tests on the HDs.

The warning message says The volume \"home\" has only 1.1 GB disk space remaining.\nReceiving the warning periodically is fine, but the warning has now poped up 10 times during the last hour. Is there any way I can adjust the frequency of this warning, such that I only get the warning once every n hours or if the free disk space gets even lower?\nWith help from Mike's answer, I found some relevant settings in dconf-editor. One of them looks like it should do what I want. But it appears it isn't working.\nI also found that the free space on the partition is going up and down over time. Apparently leaving any stackexchange pages open causes Chromium to continuously write to disk and periodically clean up. Each time this causes the disk usage to go above the threshold and below the threshold again, I get another warning regardless of the min-notify-period setting.\nIs there a way to stop varying disk usage from causing excessive warnings without completely disabling the warnings? (As a temporary workaround I created a file with 200MB of zeros, just to keep the disk usage on the same side of the alert threshold for now.)\n\nA: I don't know what OS you use, so this answer only applies to Ubuntu, and possibly Ubuntu Gnome.\nIstall dconf-tools from the Sotware Center, then launch dconf-editor from a terminal window. \nNavigate to /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/housekeeping, and modify the settings there, or deactivate it. For example, to get the warning every two hours, set min-notify-period to 120.\n\n\nA: \nAdjust the value of min-notify-period as mikewhatever suggests, but maybe the option of free-percent-notify-again is causing the trouble as well. It says it accepts 0.0..1.0 with default of 0.01. \nIf I am interpreting this correctly setting 1.0 would double the percentage the free disk space should reduce by before issuing a subsequent warning. Which by the way, you can also set that value here too (free-percent-notify). It's just going to be a matter of either being able to do the math, or trial and error.  \n", "Q: sqlite make test fails because of \"tcl.h not found\" or \"undefined reference to Tcl_Free\" I have obtained the sqlite source code with:\nsudo apt-get install fossil\nmkdir sqlite\ncd sqlite\nfossil clone http://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/doc/trunk a\nfossil open a\nrm a\n\nand compiled it with the instructions on the README.

You may need to switch to a non free kernel module, rather than the bcmwl-kernel-source. \nFrom terminal:\n sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nAnd then\n sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree\n\nWhen done, restart and let us know how it works. \nEdit: I think (or thought) some Netgear used Broadcom chipset, but according to wikidev your device uses Realtek RTL8811AU driver. \nOkay here we go. The driver you downloaded from github was rtl8812au, but your driver should be   RTL8811AU. There is a link for the driver you need on wikidev\nDriver Link \nOr if you prefer \ngithub\n", "Q: Gimp: How to change layer effects once added? For example change drop shadow values I am on my long way to get totally rid of windows and only use ubuntu.\nOne major reason to use windows is photoshop, but I am trying to get used to gimp although this is very hard for me with 10 years of photoshop in my mind.\nOne thing I totally missed when I tried gimp were the layer effects. Just a double click on the layer and here we go in photoshop.\nOk, I found the layer effects plugin and installed the python one, because of the preview function (the live preview is awfully slow, but that is another topic).\nBut the main problem is:\nFor example I added a drop shadow effect on a layer. How the hell can I change the properties of the shadow once I added it? I nearly get mad of trying and searching and not finding a solution.\nLet's say I want to change the size of the shadow. Once I added the shadow I got 2 layers. The original one and the shadow one. No matter which of them I select: If I chose the drop shadow effect again, gimp adds a new shadow layer instead of updating the old one.\nDeleting the shadow layer and adding a new one is not an option, because if you have more than one shadow in your file, the properties of a new shadow are always the properties you've used with your last shadow.\nI'm afraid that this is not working in gimp. Please tell me that my assumption is totally wrong...\nGreets, Alex\n\nA: This is not available in GIMP yet. \nPreparing the foundations for this is done during the current development cycle, as this requires adding GEGL ops for everything. See http://wiki.gimp.org/wiki/Roadmap for details.\n", "Q: built-in webcam and microphone not working (12.02 and 14.04) Today for some reason I've realized that my webcam and microphone are not working any more, I've decided to upgrade to 14.04 (using that as an excuse, and assuming that after it the problem would be gone).

I created with Acronis partion on 130Gb where I want to install Ubuntu, downloaded Ubuntu 14.04, made boot DVD and run it. During installation I don't see an option Install Ubuntu alognside Windows 7. I select other option than erase the whole hdd. There I can see only my full 1Tb hdd drive.\nWhy my Windows partitions are not visible? What I should do to make them visible? \n\nA: It sometimes can happen that certain partitions/OS's aren't detected, due to various reasons. But the installer always offers you the option to do \"Something else\".\nWhen you select the \"Something else\" option, you're being presented with a partitioning screen. Now do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to use swap memory (recommended, hard drive memory reserved for RAM outsourcing, e.g. when the RAM is full or when you hibernate), delete the new 130GB partition. In the new space, create a partition with the size of your RAM, and format it as swap.\n\n*If you followed the instructions in step 1, create a new EXT4 partition filling the remaining space. Else, simply reformat the new 130GB partition as EXT4. Give this partition the mount point /.\n\n*In the drop down menu at the bottom, select where the boot loader is going to be installed. If you're using UEFI, select the EFI partition (ca. 500MB, FAT32). If you're using Legacy BIOS, select the hard drive itself, e.g. /dev/sda, to install the bootloader in the drive's MBR.\n\n*Click the installation button.\nAfter the installation, reboot the computer. You should then see a menu which asks you which OS to boot. If this menu doesn't appear, or Windows 7 isn't listed there, boot into Ubuntu, and open the file /etc/default/grub with a root text editor: sudo nano /etc/default/grub.\nChange the line\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0 #Time the os selection menu is being shown\n\nto\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10 #Or any other number of seconds you prefer\n\nSave with Ctrl+O and exit with Ctrl+X. Now run sudo update-grub to apply the changes to the boot loader. At the next boot, Windows should appear in the selection menu.\n\nA: I'm not familiar with Acronis, so let's use disk management. If you can delete the current partition you created that would be great. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Control Panel and then Administrative Tools\n\n*Select Computer Management \n\n*Select disk management \nWhen that loads you will see all the partitions. Click the one you want to shrink (to make room for Ubuntu) and right click. \n\n\n*Select shrink and shrink to desired size \n\n\nThis will create a new partition and it will show as being unallocated, leave it like this \n\n\n*reboot and attempt install again. This time you should get the \"install alongside\" option. \n\n", "Q: failed to open hard drive error message\nI've only started using linux lite yesterday, I was hyped when I was trying it booted on usb drive that I've rushed the normal instalation of it and didn't do the partition part properly (at least I think). \nI've set this drive/partition (sorry I'm confused a little) to type 'ext4' as well as some kind of location(again I'm a little confused) in the instalation.\n\nA: Okay, based on what you have said so far it is not clear what format the drive is in right now, or if there are any files on it. Let's assume that there are, but this should give you the info you need as well as the option to fix the setting to make it auto mount.\nFrom Dash search for Disk and open the program called disks. The left side of the screen shows the disk's available and the right side of the screen shows the partition's as well as gives you details about them.\nFrom within the disks program click on your Samsung drive. The left side of the screen will show you partition info. The below picture is my current partition setup on a Windows 8.1 machine, with a Recovery partition, and dual booted with Ubuntu. \n\nSo when you do this and find the partition in question click on it to select it. Once selected, click on the gear looking icons and select \n\nEdit Mount Options\n\n\nI suspect for you, the last option of Filesystem type will be set to 'ext4' and not 'auto'. To change it click off Automatic Mount Options\nGo down to\n\nFilesystem Type \n\nand type in auto. \nTurn Automatic Mount Options back on and restart the computer. It should mount, and hopefully you will still have files.\nEdit: You said in your comments that the mount point lists as /usr. You probably want to change that to /mnt/somedirectory. Take a look at \n\nEdit Mount Options\n\nagain and set the \"Mount Point\" setting to be something other than /usr. I suggest a subdirectory of /mnt. So for example: \n /mnt/Samsung\n\nDon't forget to create the directory in /mnt\n sudo mkdir /mnt/Samsung\n\n", "Q: How to make the right hand monitor the primary monitor This has been discussed before. I tried similar (older) solutions, without succes.\nI am using 14.04 with nvidia proprietary drivers. In the nvidia xcontrol, I can set which display is primary, but this does absolutely nothing. In the system display settings all I can do is move the display orientation around. However, whatever monitor is 'left' or 'primary' makes no difference.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*editing and deleting the xml file called 'monitors.xml', which had no effect\n\n*rebooting with one monitor disconnected, which had no effect\n\n*I can set where the launcher is also, but this has no effect on where full screen applications launch. \n\n\nNot only that, but every time I change my monitor settings, even if its just swapping left/right all my icons move??\nIf I put a shortcut or icon on the desktop it should stay in the same spot relative to the physical screen no matter what software settings I change. \nAlso adding this link to another thread Change Primary monitor ; this is mostly what I've tried so far with no effect.\n\nA: Okay, that looks like an old answer and things aren't as bad in 14.04 as they once were. Yes, the monitor on the left is usually the primary monitor and it is set this way by default.\nThe unity desktop is actually called the ubuntu-desktop and the reason for this is because unity is actually a compiz plugin so you are actually using a compiz desktop. With that said, you can install compizconfig-settings-manager to achieve the settings you desire.\nEither look for it in the ubuntu software center or open a terminal and execute the following commands to install it, whatever you prefer:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nAfter installation, search for ccsm in your apps or type the command:\nccsm\n\nto start it up.\n\nNow, click on \"general options\" and navigate to the \"Display Settings\" tab. \nFor the setting \"Overlaping Output Handling\" you can set which output device (monitor) is preferred as the primary monitor. You can set this to \"smart mode\" to automatically choose the primary monitor, to prefer the \"larger output\" (bigger screen) or \"smaller output\" (smaller screen).  \nAlso, you can go down to where it says \"outputs\" if they are both the same size and you can click on either one of the outputs which will open the option to move the device up or down. You can also choose edit and you should be able to manually edit the dimensions to change one smaller or larger.\n\nccsm settings and standard desktop settings are sort of like state and federal law in the United States: federal law (ccsm settings) always trumps state law (standard desktop settings). \n\nA: Drag your display/secondary monitor to first place and apply the changes.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04/Unity lost almost all indicators Like my title said: I lost almost indicators on unity / Ubuntu 14.04.\nI have tried restart indicator-sessions, deactivate practically all my software-indicators (maybe conflict).. but I have only Language/mail/sound/hour/gear all other app-indicators runs but not appear in the indicators bar.\nAny idea?\n\nA: I solved the problem by running sudo apt-get install indicator-applet-complete.

Since both of your cards are, we can now connect the two cards with a ribbon called a CrossfireX Cable.  CrossfireX and SLi allow you to connect two or more cards as a single entity on a desktop motherboard.  You must turn your PC off, open the shell of the Tower in which the two cards are sitting.  Then take one end of the Crossfire and find the male version on top of the Card.  This is usually located near the front of the card.\n\nThe next step is to find the other cards male connector as connect it.  You should now have something like this.\n\nNow that you have your physical issues addressed, we can now move on to the Digital problem.  In order for your desktop to proper use the second screen, you must tell Ubuntu to extend the desktop to a second screen.  In order to do this you must connect both monitors with what ever ports you decide.  When you boot up Ubuntu, you need to go to System Settings, which should be located on your Taskbar.  Then head to Display.  There you should see two screens.\n\nA: The two graphics cards will not run in the crossfire operation.The target is a system in which the R9 is passed to a virtual Windows machine (QEMU / KVM - Device Passtrough)\nThe problem is, that i cant activate Display 2 without crossfire.\n", "Q: error when install Ubuntu 14.04 with easyBCD I try to install Ubuntu14.04 with easyBCD, but error occurred. it says \nERROR22:not found such partition. \n\nI set the setting of bcd like this :\ntitle Install Ubuntu\nroot (hd0,0)\nkernel (hd0,0)/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-i386.iso ro quiet splash locale=zh_CN.UTF-8\ninitrd (hd0,0)/initrd.lz\n\ncould anyone tell me how to fix it?\n\nA: Why not use PowerIso to make a bootable USB and use grub as bootmenu?

I found this info on http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/xrandr.1.html \nThis is just making the screen appear more or less bright for each pixel however and will not improve battery life by reducing brightness in this way.

When I have multiple windows of the same program running (e.g. multiple documents in the same editor, or multiple terminal windows), and I click on the program's sidebar icon, and it shows a grid of reduced windows to pick which one I want to bring to the foreground, how is the arrangement of those windows determined? It seems that each time I select a window, if I click the program icon to see the selection again, the windows are in a different arrangement, but I haven't been able to figure out what rule is used to arrange the windows, so it has been a bit disorienting. If I knew how it arranged them, it might help. \nAlso, is there a way to affect the rule, and get it to not change the arrangement when a window is chosen?

\nIf you encounter this message, please check if the server you're trying to contact is actually running PostgreSQL on the given port. Test if you have network connectivity from your client to the server host using ping or equivalent tools. Is your network / VPN / SSH tunnel / firewall configured correctly? \nFor security reasons, PostgreSQL does not listen on all available IP addresses on the server machine initially. In order to access the server over the network, you need to enable listening on the address first. \nFor PostgreSQL servers starting with version 8.0, this is controlled using the \"listen_addresses\" parameter in the postgresql.conf file. Here, you can enter a list of IP addresses the server should listen on, or simply use '*' to listen on all available IP addresses. For earlier servers (Version 7.3 or 7.4), you'll need to set the \"tcpip_socket\" parameter to 'true'. \nYou can use the postgresql.conf editor that is built into pgAdmin III to edit the postgresql.conf configuration file. After changing this file, you need to restart the server process to make the setting effective. \nIf you double-checked your configuration but still get this error message, it's still unlikely that you encounter a fatal PostgreSQL misbehaviour. You probably have some low level network connectivity problems (e.g. firewall configuration). Please check this thoroughly before reporting a bug to the PostgreSQL community. \n\nAnd\nnetstat -nlp | grep 5432\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5432          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      28429/postgres      \nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     35558    28429/postgres       /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     35556    28429/postgres       /var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432\n\n\nA: As you can see on netstat postgresql listen on 127.0.0.1 only.

The solution I ended up using looked like this:\nsudo chmod -R u=rw,g=rw,o=r,a+X /path/to/target\nThe idea in my case was to have users and groups read and write and others read only. Specifically setting users and groups to rw and others to r effectively removed the 777 permissions I had on pretty much all my files.

I have 3 types of file name encodings on reiserfs mounted hard drive: CP1251, KOI-8, UTF-8 and ASCII. I really need to convert all encodings to UTF-8, recursively. Is there any utility, which will detect source encoding and convert it to UTF-8 or I have to write Python script?\n\nA: Use convmv, a CLI tool that converts the file name between different encodings.\nTo convert from (-f) these encondings to (-t) UTF-8 do the following:\nconvmv -f CP1251 -t UTF-8 inputfile\nconvmv -f KOI-8  -t UTF-8 inputfile\nconvmv -f ASCII  -t UTF-8 inputfile\n\nIn addition, if you want to convert the file content, use iconv, a CLI tool to convert file content to different encodings.

One of the big downsides to the old code page system is that there is no way to detect which one is being used; you must simply know that a priori.

How can I install Ubuntu on my Acer 6860 E1-472p?\nI have tried disabling secure boot, as shown by some tutorials, but does not work.\n\nA: Have you tried using Rufus? (https://rufus.akeo.ie/downloads/), I have successfully installed triple OS (win 8, ubuntu, kali) on my laptop HP 14 (UEFI boot too). I made Kali and Ubuntu bootable flashdrives with Rufus. You can search the tutorial. Thanks\n\nA: Microsoft Secure Boot is a component of Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system that relies on the UEFI specification’s secure boot functionality to help prevent malicious software applications and \"unauthorized\" operating systems from loading during the system start-up process.\nWhile there is some concern that Microsoft Secure Boot will make it difficult to install Linux or other operating systems on a Windows 8 computer, the secure boot functionality in Windows 8 is primarily designed to protect users from rootkits and other low-level malware attacks by blocking unauthorized (non-signed) executables and drivers from being loaded during the boot process.\nPersonal computers bearing the Windows 8-certified logo will be required to ship with Microsoft Secure Boot enabled.\nThe easiest option, assuming that your laptop, Acer Aspire E1-472P-6860, has a x86 processor and not an ARM processor, then you can disable Secure Boot. The specifications found on Amazon.com appear to suggest that it does:\nProcessor Model: i5-4200U\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor Model: i5-4200U\n\n*Processor Speed: 1.6GHz\n\n\nOn an Intel x86 PC (not ARM PCs), you have control over Secure Boot. You can choose to disable it or even add your own signing key. Organizations could use their own keys to ensure only approved Linux operating systems could boot, for example.\n\nOptions for Installing Linux\nYou have several options for installing Linux on a PC with Secure Boot:\nChoose a Linux Distribution That Supports Secure Boot: Modern versions of Ubuntu — starting with Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS and 12.10 — will boot and install normally on most PCs with Secure Boot enabled. This is because Ubuntu’s first-stage EFI boot loader is signed by Microsoft. However, a Ubuntu developer notes that Ubuntu’s boot loader isn’t signed with a key that’s required by Microsoft’s certification process, but simply a key Microsoft says is “recommended.” This means that Ubuntu may not boot on all UEFI PCs. Users may have to disable Secure Boot to to use Ubuntu on some PCs.\nDisable Secure Boot: Secure Boot can be disabled, which will exchange its security benefits for the ability to have your PC boot anything, just as older PCs with the traditional BIOS do. This is also necessary if you want to install an older version of Windows that wasn’t developed with Secure Boot in mind, such as Windows 7.\nAdd a Signing Key to the UEFI Firmware: Some Linux distributions may sign their boot loaders with their own key, which you can add to your UEFI firmware. This doesn’t seem to be a common at the moment.\nYou should check to see which process your Linux distribution of choice recommends. If you need to boot an older Linux distribution that doesn’t provide any information about this, you’ll just need to disable Secure Boot.\nYou should be able to install current versions of Ubuntu — either the LTS release or the latest release — without any trouble on most new PCs. See the last section for instructions on booting from a removable device.\nHow to Disable Secure Boot\nYou can control Secure Boot from your UEFI Firmware Settings screen. To access this screen, you’ll need to access the boot options menu in Windows 8. To do this, open the Settings charm — press Windows Key + I to open it — click the Power button, then press and hold the Shift key as you click Restart.\n\nYour computer will restart into the advanced boot options screen. Select the Troubleshoot option, select Advanced options, and then select UEFI Settings. (You may not see the UEFI Settings option on a few Windows 8 PCs, even if they come with UEFI — consult your manufacturer’s documentation for information on getting to its UEFI settings screen in this case.)\n\nYou’ll be taken to the UEFI Settings screen, where you can choose to disable Secure Boot or add your own key.\n\nBoot From Removable Media\nYou can boot from removable media by accessing the boot options menu in the same way — hold Shift while you click the Restart option. Insert your boot device of choice, select Use a device, and select the device you want to boot from.\nAfter booting from the removable device, you can install Linux as you normally would or just use the live environment from the removable device without installing it.\n\nBear in mind that Secure Boot is a useful security feature. You should leave it enabled unless you need to run operating systems that won’t boot with Secure Boot enabled.\n", "Q: Dealing with failing drive in logical volume About a year and a half ago, I made a HTPC/NAS for my apartment that we hooked to our TV and use to download and watch movies, TV shows, listen to music, etc.\nIn making it, I used 3 1TB hard drives I had laying around, so they have all seen use in the part. I somehow corralled them into a single 2.7TB volume, taking advantage of Ubuntu's ability to have volumes constituting multiple physical volumes (logical volumes? I forget the technical term).\nBottom line is, all of the media is stored on this drive, and of course one of the hard drives seems to be beginning to fail (the volume will not mount, if it does mount it is unusably slow, or content is \"missing). Obviously this is an expected downside of the way I chose to structure the storage.\nDoes anyone have a good suggestion on a way to restructure the storage so as to avoid one drive failing jeopardizing all the files? Obviously one way would be to have three separate volumes and partition the content across them. Does anyone have any more elegant solutions? \nAlso, any advice on preserving the individual drives for as long as possible? I know that when the drives are failing on the hardware side, not much can be done on the software side. But are there any utilities built into Ubuntu or that I could download? I personally have had trouble finding any.\nThank you!\n\nA: You are looking for raid.  A raid5 array can suffer the failure of a single drive and keep on chugging.  You only get (n-1)/n as much storage though, or 2/3 the space for a 3 disk array.\nAs for how to recover now, the first thing you want to do is get a fresh drive and clone the contents of the failing drive onto the fresh one using dd or dd_rescue.\nOn the other hand, raid is no substitute for proper backups, since there are plenty of other things that can eat your data besides a failing drive, so whether you use raid or not, you still need to keep proper backups if you would mind terribly much if you lost the data.\n", "Q: FireFox in14.04 on a 32 bit mechine? It will not run any videos. I have been fighting this for weeks it seems. Installing with the Software Centre fails. I had a command line last week that got Firefox to run most videos. But a major crash killed all my documents. Now another clean install of Ubuntu 14.04 and the same stuff is still happening. In FaceBook Chromium and FireFox will not start videos or run the games.  \n\nA: You need to install Flash player from the rpm fusion repository to play videos in your browser. \nTo get Flash up and running, open a new Terminal window (press Ctrl + Alt + T) and copy paste the following lines : \n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\n  sudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install freshplayerplugin\n\nThis will install pepper flash(google chrome's flash player) to firefox.\nIf Firefox was running when you installed it, you will have to restart Firefox for changes to take place. \nIf that doesn't work, copy paste the following : \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\nsudo apt-get update\nInstalling this package will pull in support for MP3 playback and decoding, support for various other audio formats (GStreamer plugins), Microsoft fonts, Flash plugin, LAME (to create compressed audio files), and DVD playback.\n\nA: The problem is to old a machine and not enough RAM. I dropped back to 12.04.5 and dumped Chromium for Google Chrome.

I have a Asus P5E VM DO motherboard eith a Xeon processor, so both of support visualization. I'm trying to figure out how to setup PCI passthrough for my tunner cards. Both host and guest system are Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. \nI created the virtual machines using this guide using the [script][2] \nCan someone help with the step by step process to add the PCI cards?\nI tried following this guide but it doesn't seem to work for Ubuntu. \n\nA: This ended up being a 2 part answer and here it is in case it will help someone else:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*To answer the original question, to add a PCI passthrough, it is best to use Virtual Machine Manager. Select your VM and click Open. Got to View-Details and click \"Add Hardware\" button. \nYou can also accomplish the same thing via command line:\n\n\nserver$ virsh edit VM_name   and add these lines to the XML file. \n<hostdev mode='subsystem' type='pci' managed='yes'>\n  <source>\n    <address domain='0x0000' bus='0x01' slot='0x01' function='0x2'/>\n  </source>\n  <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x07' function='0x0'/>\n</hostdev>\n\nYou can find the domain, bus, slot and function name using \nlspci -t\nlspci -n\n\n\n\n\n*Now, for the above process to work, you first have to unbind the current driver from PCI card and bind it to the virtual machine driver. In my case, this was an excerpt from the lspci --v command\n\n\nserver$ lspci -nnv\n01:01.0 Multimedia video controller [0400]: Conexant Systems, Inc. CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio Decoder [14f1:8800] (rev 05)\n    Subsystem: DViCO Corporation FusionHDTV 5 Gold [18ac:d500]\n    Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 17\n    Memory at fb000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: cx8800\n\nThe instructions for unbinding in the KVM project site don't help because they reference pci-stub which is deprecated (as far as I understand). Instead do the following to unbind the driver and bind it to the VFIO driver:\nserver$ sudo modprobe kvm_intel\nserver$ sudo modprobe kvm\nserver$ kvm-ok\nserver$ modprobe vfio-pci\nserver$ sudo chmod 222 /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/new_id\nserver$ sudo chmod 222 /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\\:01\\:01.2/driver/unbind\nserver$ echo 0000:01:01.2 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\\:01\\:01.2/driver/unbind\nserver$ echo \"14f1 8802\" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/new_id\n\nYou will notice that I had to use chmod in order to get permission to unbind/bind the driver.\nAgain, you need to do step 2 before you can do step 1.\n\n\n\n*If it complains about permissions when adding the PCI passthrough, do the following\nserver$ modprobe -r vfio_iommu_type1 \nserver$ modprobe vfio_iommu_type1 allow_unsafe_interrupts=1\nI found this trick here. \n", "Q: Scheduling shutdown in layman's terms I'm trying to schedule a shutdown for 10:30pm (22:30) each evening. I am fairly new to Ubuntu. In Windows 7, this was an extremely easy task. Apparently in Ubuntu this is a rather complicated task. I've tried to download Gnome-Schedule but to no avail...I'm stuck just trying to get the darn thing to compile! So scrap that idea for now I guess....\nI've read several questions about scheduling shutdowns and people are saying to use sudo shutdown -h 22:30 or something of that sort, but that's a one-time thing isn't it? I need this to be a recurring, scheduled shut down to turn my machine off each evening. \nSo then I'm back to the Gnome-Schedule GUI because it looks like a reasonable facsimile of the Windows GUI. When I try to compile it, I'm told I need to do a cd to the directory it's in. Well, right now I have it in home/Documents/Scheduler, but if I do\ncd /home/Documents/Scheduler , I get an error saying that no such directory exists. This is most frustrating...probably I'm just doing something that is a newbie mistake, but this is the first day I've ever used Ubuntu so much of it is quite esoteric to me at the moment.\nAssuming that Gnome-Schedule is my best bet for getting a regularly scheduled shutdown time, what do I need to do to get this sucker compiled? Many thanks for your assistance!\n\nA: You want cron, which is the age old unix daemon for running scheduled jobs.  Gnome-schedule only runs in your gui session as you, and so won't be able to run commands with sudo since you aren't there to type the password.\nInsert a file in /etc/cron.d/ to schedule a job to be automatically run as root at specified times.  To shutdown at 10:30 pm each evening, the line would be:\n30 22 * * * root shutdown -h now\n\n", "Q: is it possible to install 64 bit ubuntu ios on 32 bit windows 7 ? i need help from you. i do not know, whether i can install 64 bit Ubuntu ions on my laptop with 32 bit windows 7 and my laptop got Intel core 3 and  3 GB Ram. \n\nA: If you have a 64 bit system yes, if you have a 32 bit system, no.  When you try the install the 64 bit system, your program will say that your system doesn't have the capacity and will abort the install. The 32 bit edition is identical to the 64 bit system except that it is designed for 32 bit computers.  64 bit systems can handle large files or large amounts of files better, which could be very important if you spend a lot of time sorting pictures, for example.  If you did succeed in craming a 64 bit install into a 32 bit system, it wouldn't really give you the advantages of a 64 bit system.  If your issue is speed, Lubuntu runs faster because it is lighter.  To a degree, that is also true of Ubuntu Mate.  I don't know the other desktops well enough to say.  A few years ago Ubuntu told people that if you didn't know if you were at all unsure, just install the 32 bit version.  If your system isn't getting the job done for you, try Lubuntu.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 taking a lot of time to start I am using Dell Inspiron N5010 core i3 processor and 4gb RAM !

The throttle is to prevent the kernel from taking up too much CPU while obtaining the nmi sample. You could tweak perf_cpu_time_max_percent but it seems the default is just fine\n\n\n\nA: If we focus on the line you call out in your question, this is by design and is just an FYI from the nmi-watchdog that things are taking longer than anticipated.  So what appears to be the problem isn't. It seems performance reporting can be turned off but this won't help the speed at which your system is starting up. Since your system specs indicate that your system came with a 5400 RPM HDD you could try upgrading it to a 7200 RPM HDD, or even an SSD or adding RAM.

(You would need to use ssh for this) See: SSH on help.ubuntu.com.

Is this because of the disk partitions or anything else? Please help\n\nA: When you log in to windows 8, it tries to index some data. After working with your windows for a while, the data will become bigger and bigger and it cause a high and noticeable disk usage.\nUbuntu is not as optimal as windows 8 in resource managing. In addition, there can be a problem with your GPU driver. If you didn't install that, take a tour here. It could help a lot in controlling the temperature.\nDon't worry, there is nothing wrong with having a dual boot system.\n", "Q: Ctrl + V and Ctrl + C doesn't work in Intellij IDEA 14.0.2 I can't copy and paste code in Intellij. I've been googling for a couple hours now. Every forum where there is a solution does not work. \nCtrl+X works.\nCtrl+Z works.\nCtrl+V does not work.\nCtrl+C does not work.\nI'm using the latest version of Intellij Idea (14.0.2), I'm running Linux lite - posted here because Linux lite is based off Ubuntu and it will be similar.\nHere is what happens when I right click\n(I don't have enough rep to post images apparently):\n\nI looked in setting and found keymap then typed copy in the search bar and this is what came up:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*You can disable vim from the tools menu (instead of uninstalling it)\n\n*For those who actually use vim (which is awesome) - there is an issue with copying from the run console and other outputs (this is how I stumbled onto this question), ctrl-c doesn't work there. The issue is that vim is wrapping those panels too, so you can just highlight and press 'y' :)\n\n\nA: From File -> Settings -> Plugins search for ideavim plugin. When found click on it. On the right panel you will see an Uninstall button. If you click it, you can uninstall the plugin without uninstalling all of IntelliJ IDEA.\n\nA: I had this problem and it was driving me absolutely insane.   \nIf you want to keep using the vim plugin, and have ^c and ^v  work for copy / paste like it does in other applications, then you need to go to your settings, and select Other Settings / Vim Emulation (as shown below)....   Then make sure that both ^c and ^v are set to be handled by the IDE (not Vim!) and everything should work fine. \n\n\nA: You may try Ctrl+Insert as Ctrl+C could be in conflict with the Vim editor plugin\n\nA: Either disable the ideavim plugin, or use the Vim shortcuts.\nThe Vim shortcuts are d, y, P/p in command mode to cut, copy and paste before/after the cursor. This clipboard is different than the clipboard in your OS. If you use Shift+Delete, Ctrl+Insert and Shift+Insert, the cut, copied or pasted content will be placed to the system's clipboard.\nSee http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Copy,_cut_and_paste.

It worked for me - community version 2018.3\n\nA: If your settings Ctrl-c and Ctrl-v in the Vim emulator are handle by Vim you can simply custom your .ideavimrc to use these shortcuts. Here is a simple way to do it, paste this line in your .ideavimrc:\nset clipboard+=unnamed\n\nyou can refresh the new settings in your IDE without the need to restart the IDE by using the command vim and the path of your .ideavimrc file :\n:source ~/.ideavimrc \n\nThis method is great, simple and will allow you to use all the editing shortcuts like y, Y, p, P, x to put your code in the clipboard and use it elsewhere on the computer\n..\nPS : Instead you can also create crazy customized macros for Ctrl-c, Crtl-v in insert, normal or visual mode using the clipboard register by using the quote key \" associated with + or * depends and some key editing shortcuts like c,p,y like this :\ninoremap <C-v> <Esc>\"+Pa\n\nSo the behavior is fully customizable (but this is also crazyness)\n", "Q: Are old WiFi AP settings stored in Ubuntu Server?

It also implies that your network is encrypted with WEP. WEP is extremely insecure and can usually be cracked in minutes. I strongly recommend you change the encryption in the router to WPA2-AES and then set up /etc/network/interfaces like this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.150\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8\nwpa-essid ASUS-2.4\nwpa-psk 222222222222\n\nOf course, substitute your details here.

I have Adobe Flash player, for FireFox. If anyone could give me a tip or two as to how to open said executables that require flash player, it would be a great help. \nSincerely, ~Permanently Banned~\n\nA: This is my new, applicable, answer.  The old answer pertained entirely to difficulties running wine.  This new answer pertains to the actual problem.\nThe problem you are having centers entirely on a misconception you appear to have that to install anything under Ubuntu you should be using .exe files.  You should not.  files ending in .exe are for windows and DOS and have only particular uses in Ubuntu such as making programs like microsoft word run under Ubuntu (which is easy using winetricks), but I digress.\nFor what you are trying to do you should not use anything ending in .exe  If you are, you will only end in failure.  For several months, certain youtube files requiring flash have been having difficulty running under Ubuntu, and several of us have tried various solutions, up to and even including installing firefox for windows under Ubuntu.  I did it, and it didn't solve the problem.  What did work for me was to install the Google Chrome Browser, but in no way am I suggesting that's the only solution.\nInstalling Chrome -detail:\nTo install the version of chrome which successfully opens flash videos without difficulty, please open this link and follow the instructions.  Please note, it will pop you back to the Ubuntu Software Center which IMO you ought to be using instead but sadly does not otherwise support this version of chrome at the moment.\nStandalone flash player:\nIn your most recent comment (at this moment) you seemed to indicate you wanted a standalone flash player.  This one is the best I can do at this moment.  I do not believe that installing one made for windows using wine will prove more successful.\n", "Q: Left and Top menu disappear after wake up My Left and Top menu disappear after wake up.  my Laptops is IBM x41. Is the reason that the laptops is too old?   the ubuntu version is  14.04 \n\nA: On the contrary, up to a certain point of slowness, the older the laptop is, the more likely it is to be compatible with Ubuntu.\nI'm not sure what is causing your difficulty, but I have a trick which should make it tolerable until such time as a solution is found.  I had a similar problem on a gateway and I discovered I could refresh the GUI desktop by pressing two key combinations in sequence.\nFirst you press:\n\nctrl - alt - F1\n\nThen after the screen is black, you press:\n\nctrl - alt - F7\n\nIn reality you are taking yourself to the full screen terminal, and then you are taking yourself back to the GUI, only this time everything works right, at least for me anyway.  Please let me know if this works for you.\nPS:  Don't be surprised of a more knowledgeable user comes up with a way to refresh the  GUI in a slightly simpler, or perhaps more complicated way.\n", "Q: Anyway to install stable Softwares in Ubuntu 14.10?

The problem is that the geeknote notebook-list command waits for user action during the listing, I also couldn't find a way to circumvent that.\nJust create a file with the following content: \n    #!/bin/bash\n    geeknote notebook-list > /tmp/list.txt\n    Note_List=$(cat /tmp/list.txt | grep -v Total | cut -d : -f 2)\n    for i in $Note_List; do\n        gnsync --path ~/evernote --logpath ~/.log/geeknote.log --format markdownn --notebook \"$i\" --two-way TWO_WAY\n    done\n\nDon't forget to change to your path.\nATTENTION!

So use at your own risk!\nHow to solve the last bit?\nIf you know a way of circumventing the need for user action during the geeknote note-list command, please drop a line below.\n\nA: I was looking for the same thing. This is what I came up with.\n#!/bin/bash\ngeeknote notebook-list > /tmp/list.txt\nNote_List=$(cat /tmp/list.txt | grep -v Total | cut -d : -f 2)\nfor i in $Note_List; do\n    gnsync --path ~/evernote --logpath ~/.log/geeknote.log --format markdown --notebook \"$i\" --two-way TWO_WAY\ndone\n\nYou will probably have to press enter a few times after starting. I am not sure how to treat the geeknote notebook-list command to eliminate the need for having to press enter. \n\nA: I don't know, how to circumvent the need to interact, but I know how to automate it: expect.

Here's my expect script, which did the trick for me:\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\n\nspawn geeknote \"notebook-list\"\n\nexpect \"More\"\nsleep 2\nsend \"j\"\ninteract\n\nThen you can use this in place of geeknote notebook-list:\n./geeknote-expect-script > /tmp/list.txt\n\n\nA: I went for the bash solution:\nfunction sync_notebook {\n  gnsync --path ~/Evernote/$1 --logpath ~/.log/geeknote$1.log --format markdown --notebook \"$1\" --two-way TWO_WAY\n}\n\n\nfunction sync_all {\n  for D in *; do sync_notebook $D; done\n}\n\nI added these to my .bashrc.\nThe first is just a wrapper to gnsync.

(NOT Dual Boot).  \n\nA: While installing Ubuntu you need to declare your instructions inside the partitions manager. You have to delete your C partition and install Ubuntu inside the free space on your hard drive. After installing you need to mount D into your file system. Another way to keep your data is to backup them on an external drive and copy them on your computer after installing Ubuntu.\nAnyway it is strongly recommended that you copy your data on the D drive to an external disk (usb, CD, etc.). As long as you are new to Linux it is possible that you may confuse some things and erase necessary data.  \n", "Q: Permission denied apache even after chmod I am trying to setup my LAMP server on ubuntu when i am about to change mod chmod of the files in the /var/www directory but when i try :\nsudo chmod 0644 www/* -R\n\nand \nsudo chmod 0644 www -R\n\nWhen i change the directory into the cd cd www i got permission denied and in the browser local host i get 403 Forbiddeen  .\nThis is the output of ls -l in var folder \ndrw-r--r--  3 root root     4096 Jan  4 11:23 www\n\nWhat's the problem ?\n\nA: Try:\nsudo chmod -R 0644 /var/www\n\n(if your apache configuration is like that)\nNote: The last time I did this is about 1 year ago and I may have changed but I´m pretty sure that the options must be written before the mode.\n", "Q: How to get Native instruments audio 6 to work in ubuntu 14.04 I have recently reinstalled Ubuntu 14.04 after some time of not using any Linux distro and I'm am having issues with the following sound card:\nNative Instruments Audio 6.\nI used to have it working correctly in Ubuntu 12.04 with the .asoundrc file from here. \nNow, the sound card is detected but the channel configuration seems to be different.

I want this to work on Metacity (GNOME classic), I am not willing to move to other window managers at all, since I know some of them have these capabilities built-in already. So this is a question to try and find an answer for the Metacity GNOME classic environment specifically:\n\nWhat I want is to extend my current winctrl commands. They currently work by using up half the total width of the screen either left or right of the total screen length.

I'm using the LXDE desktop environment (trusty 14.04), the Chromium browser and the Text editor app. \nThe problem\nWhen I edit a file under my username (/home/henrywright) everything works fine, but when I try to edit a file stored outside my user folder (for example /var/www/html) nothing happens after I save the document.\nMy first thought is this could be permissions related but I'm not sure how to solve the issue. How can I save a file that I'm working on in a directory outside my own user folder?\n\nA: It just occurred to me that since you are trying to edit files in /var/www, all you need to do is add yourself to the www-data group and make some changes to director permissions \nFirst:\n sudo adduser username www-data\n\nThen change the directory owner and group\n sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html \n\nallow the group to write to the directory\n sudo chmod 775 /var/www/html \n\nNow /var/www and any file or directory in it has group www-data permissions\nJust log out and it again to make sure the group change takes effect \nThen run from terminal \n groups username \n\nAnd it will list groups you are a part of. You should see www-data. If so, go try and edit file and it will work. \nSorry this didn't occur to me first. \nEdit: just to clarify, you added yourself to www-data and allowed read/write on /var/www to anyone within group www-data.\nWhen you open chromium, it will be opened as your user, that has permissions to access the files your trying to edit \n\nA: You need to run the editor with sudo (or root privileges). Not sure you can do that with a Chrome app. \nYou may need to run chrome with sudo to get this to work. \nFrom a terminal \n sudo chromium & \n\nBut I don't know if there are any security implications that go with this. You may want to only use the app on the browser with sudo and search Internet in another instance. \nYou might be better off just using a regular text editor. \nEdit: Did some searching and chromium won't even run as root, unless you make some changes, so that a pretty good indication not to run as root. \nAgain, you may want to find a text editor you like that can be installed (not an app). The screenshot looks very similar to something that does work, but the name escapes me \nEdit: As discussed it was Brackets that I was thinking of, and you like it but no arm download. I am having issues compiling on my Raspberry Pi due to PhantomJS error, but you may have better luck \nMake sure you have node installed. \n wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.35/node-v0.10.35.tar.gz\n\n tar - zxvf node-v0.10.35.tar.gz \n\nOnce extracted cd into node directory and do the usual   \n ./configure \n make\n sudo make install\n\nNow git brackets\n git clone https://github.com/adobe/brackets.git \n\nCd into Brackets directory \nRun the following \n sudo npm install -g grunt-cli\n npm install \n grunt \n\nThen sit back and wait. Hopefully it will build for you. Like I said I'm on a Raspberry Pi, and had issues with PhantomJS, but you may not. \n\nA: Linux will not allow you to change system files that you don't own unless you declare you are root. You have to make changes with sudo privileges. \nOpen your editor or file manager with 'sudo' at the beginning. (sudo Pcanfm or sudo leafpad)\n\nA: Use an editor with super user permissions:\n$ sudo nano path-to-file\n\nTo own a folder, use:\n$ sudo chown -R username:group path-to folder\n\nThen you can edit without sudo. group is optional.\n", "Q: My machine is 32 bit, but i have 64 bit processor.

Because of the limited amount of RAM Ubuntu will lag on this laptop. If you want to improve your laptop's performance, you have a choice of installing either Xubuntu 32-bit, which is comparable to Windows Vista in look and feel or Lubuntu 32-bit, which is comparable to Windows XP. In either case you should choose the 14.04 release, because the 14.04 releases of Xubuntu and Lubuntu have long term support for security and maintenance updates until April, 2017.  \nOn the other hand, if your laptop has 2GB RAM, I recommend staying with Ubuntu 32-bit.\n\nA: You can run 32 bit or 64 bit Ubuntu if you have a 64 bit system,  but I suggest installing 32 bit if your notebook only has 1GB of RAM (according to karel). 64 bit Ubuntu would lag if you don't have enough RAM. I would recommend 64 bit if you have 4 or more GB of RAM.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: enabling discrete gpu and choosing which gpu to use Hi all since this is my first post here.\nBut not my first time here.

Ubuntu 14.10 32-bit would be appropriate for the 2GB RAM model, so that you will have the most up-to-date software. Either Xubuntu 14.10 32-bit or Lubuntu 14.10 32-bit would be appropriate for the 1GB RAM model.\n\nUbuntu 14.10 supports 3735F out of the box, just like the PC. Even the touch screen is supported out of the box, unlike the ARM platform to worry about the drivers, timing configuration, etc. I have to say UEFI is great.\n\nA vanilla *buntu installation should work OK on the MeeGoPad T01 HDMI TV stick, if you have the model that came with Android preinstalled. If you have the model that came with Windows 8.1 preinstalled, you may have problems booting a different operating system due to the UEFI firmware and another possible issue is will the UEFI firmware let you boot a 32-bit operating system?. I haven't been able to find the answer to this question other than to try to boot a 32-bit operating system on the device, and see if it boots. The Intel Atom Z3735F \"Bay Trail\" quad core processor in your device supports both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems, so you could install either a 32-bit or a 64-bit operating system on your device.\nIf that doesn't work, the next step would be to try and boot a small-sized 32-bit live USB like GParted live USB or Clonezilla live USB by plugging the live USB flash drive into the USB port on your device. If, for example, GParted live USB boots and Ubuntu doesn't boot, then you're ready to read this article FAQ: Asus T100: Installing custom OS (android/ubuntu/*nix/Windows 7/Windows 8 x64), which describes how to install a 64-bit OS along with a 32-bit bootloader on a UEFI firmware device. \nOne thing about the article that concerns me is that the author of the article assumes that if GParted live USB boots on your device it is because of the 32-bit architecture, but I have found this not to be the case. In my case older versions of Ubuntu will not boot, however Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit will boot, so I'm not convinced that the 32-bit architecture of the Ubuntu installation iso file has anything to do with it, but you won't know that for sure unless you try it out on your device.\n", "Q: How to remove GNOME 3.10 and all extensions from Ubuntu 14.04 I guess the issue is already explained in the title.I want to remove GNOME 3.10 SHELL and all installed extensions in order to get clean ubuntu 14.04 but with all my software and private files saved. I've tried some commands found on the internet but i keep getting errors. What is the easiest way? For example to uninstall it in one or to terminal commands?\n\nA: I have found something like this:\nsudo apt-get purge gnome-shell-*\n\nIt worked.

I see no reason to try it out though - due to the weak encryption and possible problems with how zip handles special files, links and whatnot. \nIf you want real encryption, look into gnupg and related utilities instead.\nman tar, man zip, zip --help, zip -h2 | less, tar --help | less may hold information vital to the above, especially the piped conversion which I have not tried.\n\nA: You can use tar-to-zip for this purpose. All you need to do is:\nInstall node.js with nvm if you do not have it.\nAnd then install tar-to-zip with:\nnpm i tar-to-zip -g\n\nAnd use it with:\ntar2zip hello.tar.gz\n\nIt will show percents of operation progress and create file hello.zip in the same directory.\nPipes could be used as well:\ncat hello.tar.gz | tar2zip > hello.zip\n\nUnfortunately there is no way to set a password.\n", "Q: \"Impossible\" to install Ralink rt5370 driver on Xubuntu 14.10 I really need help to install this driver on Xubuntu 14.10.

I am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a Dell 3542 laptop. My problem is that screen brightness changes depending on content. I think this is called automatic (or dynamic) brightness adjustment, as I stated in the title. This means that the screen gets brighter when the contents are white (for example when I open my browser) and it gets dimmer when the contents are dark (for example when I  open the terminal). This can easily be seen when I open a white window and a black window and I proceed to move the black window in and out of the screen, so the brightness constantly changes.\nI have done a fair amount of research, and the issue seems to have something to do with the power saving feature of the graphics card. This issue seems to be resolved in windows environments, but I have not found a solution for Ubuntu.\nYou should also know that this issue appears only when I run the laptop on battery, and disappears as soon as I plug it in.

Loading the preconfiguration file\nIf you are using initrd preseeding, you only have to make sure a file named preseed.cfg is included in the root directory of the initrd. The installer will automatically check if this file is present and load it.\nFor the other preseeding methods you need to tell the installer what file to use when you boot it. This is normally done by passing the kernel a boot parameter, either manually at boot time or by editing the bootloader configuration file (e.g. syslinux.cfg) and adding the parameter to the end of the append line(s) for the kernel.\nIf you do specify the preconfiguration file in the bootloader configuration, you might change the configuration so you don't need to hit enter to boot the installer. For syslinux this means setting the timeout to 1 in syslinux.cfg.\nTo make sure the installer gets the right preconfiguration file, you can optionally specify a checksum for the file.

This way, the line will have as many fields +1 as times the word this appears.\n\n*To make it case insensitive, we use IGNORECASE = 1. See reference: Case Sensitivity in Matching.\n\n*Then, it is just a matter of saying NF==4 to get all those lines having this exactly three times. No more code is needed, since {print $0} (that is, print the current line) is the default behaviour of awk when an expression evaluates to True.\n\nA: Assuming the lines are stored in a file named FILE:\nwhile read line; do \n    if [ $(grep -oi \"this\" <<< \"$line\" | wc -w)  = 3 ]; then \n        echo \"$line\"; \n    fi  \ndone  <FILE\n\n\nA: If you're in Vim:\ng/./if len(split(getline('.'), 'this\\c', 1)) == 4 | print | endif\n\nThis will just print matched lines.\n\nA: In perl, replace this with itself case-insensitively and count the number of replacements:\n$ perl -ne 's/(this)/$1/ig == 3 && print' <<EOF\nHow to get This line that this word repeated 3 times in THIS line?\nBut not this line which is THIS word repeated 2 times.\nAnd I will get This line with this here and This one\nA test line with four this and This another THIS and last this\nEOF\nHow to get This line that this word repeated 3 times in THIS line?\nAnd I will get This line with this here and This one\n\nUsing a count of matches instead:\nperl -ne 'my $c = () = /this/ig; $c == 3 && print'\n\nIf you have GNU awk, a very simple way:\ngawk -F'this' -v IGNORECASE=1 'NF == 4'\n\nThe number of fields will be one more than the number of separators.\n\nA: Ruby one-liner solution:\n$ ruby -ne 'print $_ if $_.chomp.downcase.scan(/this/).count == 3' < input.txt                                    \nHow to get This line that this word repeated 3 times in THIS line?\nAnd I will get This line with this here and This one\n\nWorks in a quite simple fashion: we redirect file into ruby's stdin, ruby gets line from stdin, cleans it up with chomp and downcase, and scan().count gives us number of occurrences of a substring.\n", "Q: disk image feature in disks utility. Has anyone used it? I have my ubuntu 14.04 system in one partition (I do not have an extra partition for home) while I have date in another partition. I regularly backup data using a backup tool (areca) but I was wondering how to backup my system (including apps) so I started looking for imaging tools, things like dd, tar, or clonezilla. But I found the imaging feature of disks and it this works, it seems pretty neat to me. boot with ubuntu image, make an image of the partition and in case of big failure, boot again with ubuntu image and restore the image. To me that sounds like clonezilla but I would like to know if this sounds correct and if there's anyone out there that has used it. I have found this Is the create disk image in the disks utility like clonezilla?, but it is not clear to me from the answer how is that imaging a partition with disks utility is any different from using clonezilla.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nRegards,\nJavier\n\nA: Clonezilla is smart enough to recognize most filesystems and skip the free space, reducing the size of the image.  The disks utility is not so smart and just copies everything.  Also clonezilla can further compress the image reducing its size even more.  Due to the lack of these features, the gnome disk utility's current image support isn't practically usable.\n\nA: *\n\n*You should always have more than one backup: By Murphy's Law The (only) backup will fail, be corrupt or whatever just when you need it most.\n\n*At least once (e.g. or annually) test restoring your backup to a different temporary/old/unused disk\n\n*Clonezilla becomes more useful once you are dealing with disks of several hundred GB, or when you want to backup specific partitions.\n\n", "Q: what is this panel indicator/menu bar icon?

With the fonts in place, programs requiring such fonts will install so smoothly, you might imagine you are installing Office on a Windows computer.\nWhenever advising others regarding windows software under Ubuntu my advice is to install Winetricks first then PlayOnLinux second.  After installing each in sequence, then open Wine (which is installed by Winetricks) as Wine must be opened once to auto-configure and update itself further, before trying to install software.\nFinally, if I recall correctly it was PlayOnLinux which contains installation help for MS-office, although both Winetricks and PlayOnLinux both contain installation help.\nAbout all I would add is that although there are certain specific features of MS-Word not substituted adequately by LibreOffice Writer, such as \"markup\", I have been able to demonstrate that for most people without that requirement Writer is actually preferable has features omitted from Word including some add-ons MS has the audacity to require their customers to pay extra for.\n", "Q: How to I get mcomix to remember my rotation settings?

I am running a fresh copy of ubuntu 14.10. What can I do to make this TV my main monitor?\n\nA: It has been a couple of years since I had to overcome some difficulty there, but I can give you several hints to push you in the right direction, as I was successful and so should you be.  I recall that using the DISPLAYS utility under the hardware section of systems settings was instrumental, but as it has been so long, I have forgotten exactly how.  I seem to recall you can designate one monitor as primary, but you will probably have to click around a bit in that window to figure out how.\nAlso it is possible your graphics chipset driver may need to be upgraded in some way to give you some increased control, but I doubt that since it sounds as though you have things working for the most part.\nI am not aware of any inherent difference between monitors and TVs with hdmi input which would prevent you from succeeding, but it is possible that the computer associates the last known primary monitor (the one used without the other) for primary use.  You might try disconnecting your old primary monitor entirely to see if that resets matters.\n", "Q: Matlab won't start after clean install I am using 14.04.1 LTS on 64-bits and I installed Matlab R2014b 64-bit, but when I try to open it, I just get the picture saying that it's Matlab: \n\nand then nothing happens, even if I wait 20 minutes. \nMy question is similar to this one, but I tried opening it with matlab -desktop and was not successful.

I wanted to install Ubuntu on my tablet pc as main operating system but it was really hard to make it working with touch screen.\nThe system reacts on touch and mouse click differently and it produces bugs which make it hard to use at all.\nI tried all major desktops - Unity, Gnome, LXDE, KDE etc, and only Unity works relatively good with touch screen. But Unity also has touch screen bugs - for example, it is impossible to use Firefox or Chrome. When I tap on menu button in Firefox (it is rightmost button, contains zoom, print, history, full screen command etc) it does nothing. When I tap on any combobox in Firefox, it blinks for a moment and disappears - so it is impossible to use comboboxes. Tabs in Chrome also dont work - if I tap on tab Chrome does not switch to the tab. Note that if I use mouse everything works.\nIf I switch to other desktop, for example, KDE, Chrome and Firefox start working with taps, but KDE has more serious bug - it stops reacting on taps after some time passed, I cannot say the reason. Also on-screen keyboard works very bad in KDE - it does not show up automatically, sometimes it even does not show up on login screen. It is not a problem if you have keyboard, but if you have only touch screen....\nSo I reverted back to Windows on the tabled and continue to use Ubuntu on my desktop as there are no such problems.\nI would be very glad if someone could help me with taps on Unity.\nThanks,\nOleg.\n\nA: It seems you need to calibrate your touch screen. Not all touch screens work with Ubuntu out of the box. Therefore, if you can look here for more on calibration. Scroll down to \"Calibration\" and read about xinput-calibrator. This should allow you to calibrate your screen. \n", "Q: Is full-disk encryption making my system unstable? About six months ago I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop with full disk encryption (FDE).\nNow I am considering turning off FDE because I think the feature is making my system unstable. The risk of data theft seems less likely than the risk of system failure.\nFrom the following, does it sound like FDE is likely at fault? Or should I be looking at the disk itself?\nThe disk is an Intel SSD. hdparm reports a model number \"INTEL SSDSC2BW240A3\".\nTo reduce disk writes I have put /tmp on tmpfs and removed set the noatime attribute for the rest of the disk. All other filesystem settings are the default, I believe.\nAt boot about a month ago the computer refused my decryption password. It acted as if it was the wrong password. Quite stressful!\nI booted from the live CD and managed to decrypt the disk by giving the same password to the file manager prompt. The files were all still there, phew!\nAt the next boot from disk, the FDE system accepted the same password. Strange!\nNow several times a week I encounter I/O errors make the system unusable and cause me to lose unsaved work.\nWithout warning, any and all of the following can happen:\nMenu icons appear as white pages with red X marks.\nLibreOffice will freeze when I try to save some changes to a document. It is stuck until force it to quit and lose the changes. Then it doesn't start again.\npgAdmin will display two errors every time I execute a query: \"Can't write to log file\" and \"Can't write to history file\".\nIf the query tries to read any data not already cached in memory by PostgreSQL, the server responds with a \"read-only file system\" error.\nFirefox works for a bit, presumably because it's caching responses in memory. Without warning it will disappear.\nMost basic of all, I can't even cleanly shutdown the system.\nWhen I open a terminal and run shutdown, I see something like \"/sbin/shutdown exec: I/O error\"\nI would supply more accurate repros, but it's quite hard to capture them when the system enters this state.\nThe only way out is to hold the power button until the system turns off hard.\nWhen I turn it on again, the FDE system appears to do a quick consistency check after it accepts my password. I've been lucky so far.\nEDIT:\nI've taken a backup of all the important things.\nI followed Fabby's instructions to test the disk using smartmontools.\nHere is a link to the pre-test output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9925956/\nHere is a link to the post-test output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9926195/\n\nA: My apologies for posting this as an answer, but comments would not get the attention this needs.

I've spent the past several hours (not few, several!) reading different pages and questions on how to setup a tmpfs/RAMDisk. They all say different things and say what filesystems I should and shouldn't be including, so I would really appreciate a conclusive, updated answer on this.\nI have 16GB of RAM and I want to dedicate maybe 6-8GB to a RAM disk.\n1) I plan on adding /tmp, /var/cache, and ~/.cache to the RAM Disk (and Firefox through profile-sync-daemon). Any other suggestions on what to add? I read on moving /var/lock and /var/run too, but since it's from /var is that advisable? \n2) I run LaTeX a lot (LuaLaTeX specifically) so I was thinking maybe I could install that in the RAM instead of on the actual SSD and see if that runs faster? Or I could move /var/lib/texmf and ~/.texmf-var to RAM? I don't know, so I'd appreciate the advice!\n\nA: /var/run is tied to the specific running instance of a machine at a time due to storing PIDs of the running processes, I would only avoid placing that on a RAM disk if you are using a virtual machine and suspend the VM often.  /var/lock is intended to prevent more than a single instance of a given application from running and thus should also be fine.  If you have a service which is not well behaved and uses the leftover pid/lock files to detect crashes you should either relocate the paths they store the information or find alternatives.\nSource: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/var.html\nThere are estimates running applications on a RAM disk may result in performance increases of in the 10x range.

What Im trying to say is how will I safely swith between my main OS (windows 7) and ubuntu\n\nA: You will boot to your main OS on hard drive if no bootable CD/DVD is present in the machine. You can also check order of booting devices in your BIOS. The boot sequence than tries them in the order specified there until it finds some bootable medium.\n\nA: It sounds like you just want to run Ubuntu off DVD without installing it. Yes the DVD does have a \"try ubuntu\", but using that is pretty limited. Mostly, it won't save any changes. Any time you boot off that DVD you get a stock environment every time. \nIf you have no interest in dual booting Ubuntu and Windows, and if your computer supports it, I would  use a USB drive. \nFrom Windows download and install Linux Live USB Creator. Once you get in there select the USB device and set to write the Ubuntu image you downloaded. \nNow the important part. Notice the persistence section. Set this to what your USB device will allow.  This is where all your changes and downloads will be saved. \nAs an example, if you have  a 20 Gig USB drive, the Ubuntu image will take about 4-5 Gigs maybe, so you could get a persistent partition of say 15 Gigs. \nSomething like that. Maybe little less. \nSo basically you have a portable Ubuntu with a 10-15 Gig partition that will save your installs, changes, documents and media. \nThe bigger the drive the bigger the persistence you can have. \nDepending on the computer, you can press f9 (or some other fkey) or use bios to boot from USB when want Ubuntu. \n", "Q: Get unique device ID in QML I need to get a unique ID for the device. I originally thought I'd use the device's imei, but that doesn't seem to return anything:\nimport QtSystemInfo 5.0\n\nDeviceInfo {\n    id: device\n}\n\nComponent.onCompleted {\n    console.log(device.imei(0)) // Returns nothing\n}\n\nThat may or may not be a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qtsystems-opensource-src/+bug/1197542 but since there haven't been any updates for a year, I'm hoping that maybe I can use some other piece of information.\nSo, does anyone know how I can get a unique ID for the device? It has to be persistent, but it can be totally meaningless other than as an identifier.\n\nA: As dobey said, there's no way to get the IMEI in confined apps, so I gave up on trying to get an ID based on the device itself. Instead, I just generate a UUID and store it in U1DB.\n// uuid.js\n.pragma library\n\nfunction generateUUID(){\n    var d = new Date().getTime();\n    var uuid = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function(c) {\n        var r = (d + Math.random()*16)%16 | 0;\n        d = Math.floor(d/16);\n        return (c === 'x' ? r : (r&0x3|0x8)).toString(16);\n    });\n    return uuid;\n};\n\n// Elsewhere\nU1db.Database {\n    id: db\n    path: \"settings\"\n}\n\nU1db.Document {\n    id: user\n    database: db\n    docId: \"user\"\n    create: true\n    defaults: {\n        \"userId\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n\n// Somewhere I need the userId\nItem {\n    id: thing\n\n    Component.onCompleted: {\n        userId: user.contents.userId\n        if (!userId) {\n             userId = Uuid.generateUUID()\n             var userContents = user.contents\n             userContents.userId = userId\n             user.contents = userContents\n        }\n        return userId\n    }\n}\n\n\nA: This does work. It is how ubuntu-system-settings is getting the IMEI. \nRather, your issue may be that console.log() is not going to whatever console output you're expecting to see it at, or the system you are running it on, has no IMEI available (which requires a GSM modem). There is also a serial number shown in the About page of system settings, but it is being read through a C++ plug-in, which you likely cannot use directly from your app, and may need to reimplement.\nReading the device information is limited to system unconfined apps at the moment. There is no current policy_group to use to be able to read the IMEI in a confined app.\n\nA: In more recent versions, the DeviceInfo QML type has a uniqueID property:\nDeviceInfo {\n    id: device\n}\n\nComponent.onCompleted {\n    console.log(device.uniqueID)\n}\n\nDocumentation: QML DeviceInfo Element: property uniqueID.

It works fine on every version of Ubuntu that I have including Kubuntu, but it fails on every version of Lubuntu.\nOn Lubuntu, the character that gets transmitted by the Event is determined by event.hardware_keycode; event.keyval doesn't matter.  On every other platform, the character is determined by event.keyval and event.hardware_keycode doesn't matter.\nThe problem is that as far as I can tell it is not possible to specify Unicode characters through event.hardware_keycode because they do not have a corresponding key. Unicode works fine on other platforms using keyval.\nDoes anyone know how to get Lubuntu to behave the same as Ubuntu in this regard?

Ubuntu ignores hardware_keycode, so you get À.  I could\n        # make the program work on all platforms by specifying both, but what\n        # is hardware_keycode for unicode characters?\n        event = gtk.gdk.Event(gtk.gdk.KEY_PRESS)\n        event.keyval = int(gtk.gdk.unicode_to_keyval(ord(unicode(u\"À\"))))\n        event.hardware_keycode = 38  # hardware keycode for \"a\"\n        event.window = button.get_window()\n        event.put()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    u = KeyPressTest()\n    gtk.main()\n\nHere's the answer:  Lubuntu has an environment variable set to specify the input method:\nGTK_IM_MODULE=xim\nUnset that variable and the program above works.\n\nA: There is no hardware_keycode for a unicode character unless you can type it by pressing a key.

The problem is that although I explicitly give the option permissions in /etc/fstab file I cannot chmod the files or directories inside the mounted drive. I also experimented with it and noticed if I only supplied permissions option while mounting(after unmounting everything) it and changed into the mount directory I noticed that everything had chmod 777 permissions, but I was able to alter the permission via the chmod command. The command is as follows in the command prompt:\nmount -t ntfs-3g -o permissions /dev/sda5 /mnt/DATA/\n\nHowever, I noticed even when I supplied my uid and gid to own the files the option permissions stopped having an effect. I tried appending and prepending it into the list of options just to make sure, and it turned out that in both cases I was not able to alter the permissions with chmod. The codes I used in command prompt is as follows:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o uid=1000,gid=1000,permissions /dev/sda5 /mnt/DATA/\n\nAfter unmounting, one more try as follows:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o permissions,uid=1000,gid=1000 /dev/sda5 /mnt/DATA/\n\nBoth of these configurations did not allow me to change the settings and the option permissions had literally no effect. In my /etc/fstab file I define the line for mounting the NTFS partition as follows:\n# data was on /dev/sda5 always\nUUID=01CCA0086DD8A980   /mnt/DATA                 ntfs  auto,users,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=022,fmask=133,permissions       0       0\n\nHow can I make permissions options work so that I can change the permissions on the go without having to remount the partition totally? I read somewhere in this website it as possible, but I am unsure of how to do it. I would greatly appreciate any comments suggestions on this issue. My full /etc/fstab is as follows:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

I have a laptop with two speakers: one is blown and playing unpleasant distorted sound.\nHow do I permanently deactivate it or control it using balance?\nA terminal command is preferred, I reckon.\nAlso, I use Gnome's basic sound settings and PulseAudio Manager. The latter is used to maximize volume, because the former does not allow me to go beyond 150%. But when I use PulseAudio Manager, it automatically rebalances the speakers to 50%/50%. So, any solution must be permanent enough so PulseAudio Manager cannot alter the balance.\nThanks. \n\nA: I don't know any way to lock a control with ALSA or PulseAudio, but this little hack should work:\nstdbuf -oL alsactl monitor | \\\nwhile read; do\n    amixer -D pulse sset Master 0,-\ndone\n\nIt watches for volume changes using alsactl monitor (you can run this command yourself and change the volume to see what it does), and every time a change is made, it resets the volume of the left channel to 0.\nYou may need to change:\n\n\n*\n\n*pulse to something else if you're using a different audio device.\n\n*0,- to -,0 if you want to keep the right channel muted instead.\n\n*Master to something like Speaker,0 if you want a secondary control (e.g. headphones) to work as normal.\nYou can make the script run at startup by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Putting it in a file, e.g. ~/.bin/alsa-fix,\n\n*giving the file permission to be run: chmod +x ~/.bin/alsa-fix, and\n\n*adding the line ~/.bin/alsa-fix & to ~/.profile.\n\n\nThe script should use virtually no CPU or RAM, but if you want to make it even more efficient, you can probably run it with dash by adding the line #!/bin/dash to the top of the file.\n\nA: There is a right and left balance control in the GUI interface for sound.  Your question seems to indicate you prefer a terminal command, and so if that's the case I can't help you.  However if you are merely determined to mute one of your speakers you should be able to configure that in your sound settings.  Merely click once on the speaker icon at the top of your screen and click on sound settings.  \n\nA: usual command for amixer to set levels has one value used for all channels, but can use two different values \nfor example:\nI set line in capture for a mono mic on my hardware with\namixer set -c 0 Line 42,0\n\nuse amixer command or alsamixer to find device id number for -c option\nand name of ALSA mixer element to replace 'Line'\nCan use percentage or dB values too\nIn this case Values of '46%' or '0dB' instead of '42' get same result\nIf Pulseaudio still causes changes in ALSA level \nUse Pulseaudio Volume Control pavucontrol\ngo to Output Devices tab\nclick padlock to unlock channels to set channel levels\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 won't load to empty Hard drive (2) I asked this question on 12/31/14 and got response from Virusboy and gyropyge. I followed their advise, deleting all partitions.The drive was then unallocated. I then attempted to  install Ubuntu 14.04-iso from a dvd. I set all 3 boot options in the BIOS to boot from the CDROM. Upon restarting, after the BIOS processed , I get \"missing operating system\" which repeats until I shut down. I then changed the drive from \"unallocated\" to one primary partition. Same result, \"missing operating system\". What am I doing wrong??\n\nA: Thanks for mentioning me.  I was wondering why this looked familiar.  Depending upon the brand and model of your laptop, it may be necessary to press another key such as ESC or F8 to persuade your PC to boot from the DVD drive.\nEdit:  Explained in my comments below, it appears the button you need to press to bring up the boot menu is F12\n", "Q: VLC unable to play wmv I recently installed ffmpeg on Ubuntu 14.04 to do some video editing because avconv didn't have some options that I wanted or knew about. After installing ffmpeg, VLC seems to be unable to play wmv video files. VLC will open then immediately close. No crash report pops up. I also tried playing the files in totem but that also does not work. The files are not corrupted as they played fine before installing ffmpeg. I uninstalled ffmpeg and removed the orphaned applications but VLC still won't play wmvs. I have ubuntu-restricted-extras installed but wmv files still won't play.\n\nA: Apparently, there were some issues (that I don't know the details of and am not implying any comment on) when ffmpeg was forked into libav and the package was removed from Debian. Apparently, this caused issues for some applications that were built against libav but were developed using ffmpeg. Browsing around, I also see users of other distros talking about similar conflicts (though not necessarily about wmv).\nThese issues have apparently been resolved with the new FFmpeg 2.5 and the package is back in Debian Unstable and is slated for Ubuntu Vivid. It depends on the 56 branch of libavcodec, so you likely won't be able to install it until Vivid.\nThere are some PPA'a listed at the newest FFmpeg download page, at least one of which says it works with Trusty; so you might be able to get it working that way.\nIn the meantime, I think your current problem came from replacement of various codec related packages with problematic versions. (Ok, that's something of a guess since nothing at the instructions you used leapt out as a red flag, but that page appears to be older and not necessarily using the most recent source.)\nThe rollback instructions on that page really just point to the dev dependencies installed. You might need to dig into the package deeper to really find what it installed or replaced.\nYou might also just try purging vlc and ubuntu-restriced-extras. An apt-get -s autoremove might also be helpful; but it may not be needed, since a reinstall should replace the packages anyway. The -s option means it will just show what the command will do without actually removing anything. Check the results carefully. If it's ok, you can rerun it without the -s.\nThen be sure to do a sudo apt-get update before reinstalling the packages. That should bring back the original versions of any files that were replaced.\nIf the problem comes from configuration issues such as symlinks or mimetype issues, the problem might ironically be easier to fix but much harder to pin down. That's where you might need to look at what the install program really did.\n\nA: The FFmpeg compilation instructions you followed should not interfere with VLC, or any other packages in the repository at all, because it performs a local \"installation\" into your home directory and does not install to the system. \"Installation\" here being a debatable term since to uninstall it you simply delete the FFmpeg files in ~/bin and the ~/ffmpeg_build directory.\nExemptions may include packages that use the ffmpeg binary directly and access it via your $PATH.\n", "Q: Applications not visible in launcher I have installed ubuntu 14.10. the problem is the applications wont show in ubuntu dash(clicking on launcher icon and search for application) i have installed google chrome and virtual box ( downloaded both from their websites NOT through ubuntu software center) these applications dont show up in the dash. but if i restart the PC then those applications show up properly.

I want to buy a VPS and use Ubuntu Server.\nI use this for my shadowsocks service and put my up blog (may be run on python, MySQL).\nIs it enough? \n\nA: If you're only going to be running these two services you'll easily get away with 512MB/1GB RAM even with a decent amount of traffic. The host you use will also have an impact, as many hosts limit you in terms of CPU and disk speed.\n", "Q: Change visibility of files for non-root users I have a file that is only visible in root mode. I want to make it visible for non-root users. I added permissions such that the maximum of person can read, write and execute it (even if only read would be necessary) but it is still invisible in non-root (standard) mode. Permissions are as follow for this file (filename.tar.gz)\n\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 root root 2335154 Jan  4 22:55 filename.tar.gz\n\nHow can I make this file visible in non-root mode?\n\nA: Try changing the owner or the group of the file. \nsudo chgrp \"group name\" \"filename\"   \nsudo chown \"username\" \"filename\"\n\nBut this should only be done, if the file is not exactly required to be \"owned\" by the root.\n\nA: sudo chmod -R ug+rw foldername\n\nIf you want to change all files and folders use:\nsudo chmod -R ug+rw *\n\nYou can change all these to be owned by the myuser user with:\nsudo chown -R myuser:myuser *\n\n\nA: Changing permission for just the file won't do. You need to allow access for the non-root user to all folders in the parent tree of the file in question.\nThis of course is a security hazard. So, it is recommended that you try to solve the \"need\" of accessing this file in a secure way.\n\nA: I managed to solve the problem. It happened that I have put the file on the Desktop folder, but the root folder named Desktop is completely different from the non-root folder Dektop (which is what is displayed on the desktop of Ubuntu). I copied the file by cd into the folder of the file, and using \n\ncp filename.tar.gz ~/../home/username/Desktop/rosfile.tar.gz\n\nfilename being the name of the file, and username being the name of the user. The rights for non-root modification of the file is achieved using\n\nsudo chown \"username\" \"filename\"\n\n", "Q: clone my ubuntu from hdd to new ssd related question I have resize the HDD partitions with Gparted Live and copy the reduced-size partitions(only file system on it) to the smaller SSD with Clonezilla live , and both of them are successful already.now I try to use the boot partition(dev/sda1) on HDD to boot my SSD system, and is it correct?  \n\nA: dd command should works.\ndd if=[Input file or Device] of=[Output file or Device] bs=[Byte Per Seconds]\n\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4m\n\nwhere sda is for old hard disk and sdb is your new SSD.\ndd command copy byte by byte from an storage to new storage.\n\nA: Now that your drive is copied to the new media, before removing the original drive you need to download and burn this boot repair cd.  After swapping out your old and new hard drives you will need to boot to this CD and let it configure your new drive to boot your system.\nIf you do not disconnect the original hard drive, the Boot Repair CDrom will not be able to prepare the SSD as your boot device.  If at a later time you wish to reconnect your HDD or format it as free space, I'd be happy to help you with that, but first we must complete this step.\n\nA: When you ran clonezilla, you also cloned your /etc/fstab file so that it you boot off the ssd, the fstab there tells linux that the / and /home (if separate partitions) are looking to the spinning HD. You just neet to change /etc/fstab on sdb to to have the UUID of the ssd.\nYou can test it like so...\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nBe sure you are on your ssd and comment out the line that has / right after the UUID by putting a # at the start of the line.

But you can DIY with any editor, just keep a backup copy handy and a live iso ready to fix any errors just in case.\nman visudo says:\n There is a hard-coded list of one or more editors that visudo will use\n set at compile-time that may be overridden via the editor sudoers Default\n variable.  This list defaults to /usr/local/bin/vi.  Normally, visudo\n does not honor the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables unless they\n contain an editor in the aforementioned editors list.  However, if visudo\n is configured with the --with-env-editor option or the env_editor Default\n variable is set in sudoers, visudo will use any the editor defines by\n VISUAL or EDITOR.  Note that this can be a security hole since it allows\n the user to execute any program they wish simply by setting VISUAL or\n EDITOR.\n\nSo maybe your visudo can't override it's hard-coded list of editors.

That can happen in your wifi, router, modem, neighbourhood network, ISP, or further \"upstream\"... It would be hard to compare it to a different OS on the same computer, since it probably takes longer than 30 seconds to shutdown & reboot in windows & connect to the exact same site.\nYou could try ping-ing a reliable site that responds (like www.google.com or www.yahoo.com) and see if you start dropping pings or they take a lot longer when having the problem.

I have ubuntu 14.04 LTS and a 3.17.4 kernel. i want to know if i should purge my installed kernel and install a new one or apply a patch to it.\n\nA: If you are connected to the internet, the fastest way to upgrade your kernel is to perform a system update, which is ordinarily automated but you can pre-empt the automated update if the matter is that urgent.  Simply open the Update Manager and click on Check.\nUpdate:  I was very curious why anyone would be interested in forcing such an upgrade or if there were a problem preventing the distribution of such an update.  Given some of the complaints I've been reading it wouldn't have surprised me to discover that the latest kernel had been distributed and disabled the systems which received it.  Nobody would want that!\nSo I've been reading about the ways to force an upgrade and how to get the very latest kernel and I've made some interesting discoveries.  This link which is now rather out of date gives a glimpse of how some people were updating their kernels just a few months ago.\nApparently Kernel 3.18 is currently released only in the Alpha release of Ubuntu 15.04, and I've also read that when 15.04 is fully released in April it is expected to come with Kernel 3.19.  I've been using Ubuntu for 9 years and until just the past few months I've never known Ubuntu to release anything before it was ready.  There seems to be a lot wrong with the current release, and that saddens me, but I only understand the symptoms, not the causes.  I'm more likely to continue to use 12.04LTS which is supported for 2.5 more years than to crowbar a new kernel into the mix.\n", "Q: How to install DC++ on Ubuntu 14.04?

To be thorough, we'll target any packages that start php:\nsudo apt-get remove '^php'\n\nTo uninstall something you installed from source, you would traditionally cd back into the directory you built it from and run sudo make uninstall but  in this case it seems that PHP doesn't ship a removal target for make.\nThat makes removing it incredibly hard. You can either manually find all the files it installed, or you can (maybe) build a real package from the existing compiled version you have, install that over the existing files and then remove it.\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\nsudo -i\ncd php-5.3.29\ncheckinstall\n\nAccept all the defaults. By the end of it, it should have built and installed a php package (check the package name as checkinstall tells you) and then you can remove it with:\nsudo apt-get remove php  # or whatever the actual package was called\n\nIf checkinstall doesn't work (it doesn't always), you're left hunting for files. Stalking through the Makefile and commands like locate php might help but with something as vast as PHP, it's going to be a long process. If you need a quick recovery, a reinstall (or backup restore, because you have those, right?) might be a better option.\n\nAs for verification, I'd just try running php5 in a command line. whereis php5 might be illuminating too. If they're returning results, you probably have more work to do.\n", "Q: how to install kali linux in virtualbox in Ubuntu 14.04 ? I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS . I'm facing problem while installing Kali Linux 64-bit in Virtualbox . When I tried to install Kali ,the virtualbox shows me the below message in the screenshot i have shared . If anyone knows how to solve this problem please help me !\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Well, it says \"VT-x is disabled in the BIOS\"... so go into your BIOS and enable VT-x?\nDoing that varies in the different BIOS'es, for more info google your specific computer, and/or with \"VT-x is disabled in the BIOS\"\n", "Q: What could possibly be changing the access time of old backedup files? I am using ubuntu 14 LTS 64 bit.\nI keep backup of my source files in /var/src-backup/. I was examining the access date of all those files and it appears as though the files have been accessed at least 10 days ago. Now, some of the backups there are a year old and hasnt been viewed at all. \nI was thinking that perhaps some sort of an OS program was accessing the files for some reason but if that was the case then probably the timestamps of all the files would be same(down to the exact second), right? But some of the files have been accessed 10 days ago some 3 days ago.\nThe files are GPG encrypted directories compressed as an archive.\nNo one besides me have access to my computer.\nIs this normal or do i have reasons to believe that someone has been trying to read/copy/upload the files without my permission?\n\nA: File manager searching through that folder tree? Counting all files & adding up their sizes? Any indexing service?\nIf you disabled access times when mounting that backup (with noatime), then the access time shouldn't be changed (unless you modify the file I think)\n", "Q: radeon_pm_info: What are vclk, dclk, sclk, mclk, vddc and vddci? # cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/64/radeon_pm_info\nuvd    vclk: 0 dclk: 0\npower level 0    sclk: 37500 mclk: 150000 vddc: 950 vddci: 875 pcie gen: 3\n\nI'd like to know what are these vclk, dclk, sclk, mclk, vddc, vddci numbers. I guess vddc and vddci are some kind of frequencies in MHz (not sure memory or card), but I really would like to decypher this.\n\nA: *\n\n*VCLK and DCLK are two UVD internal clocks.\n\n*SCLK is the Engine clock and MCLK is the Memory clock, both depend on the current power level.\n\n*VDDC (mV) is the GPU core voltage\n\n*VDDCI (mV) is the I/O bus voltage (between memory and GPU core) and comes

What could be the reason for it?\n\nA: The power state is adjusted dynamically based on the current configuration of the GPU.  I suspect you have multiple displays connected which why the clocks are higher.  Dynamic mclk switching is done during the vertical blanking period so it can only be done when a singel display is attached.  When multiple displays are attached, the mclk is forced high.  The min/max sclk levels may also need to be adjusted depending on current requirements.\n", "Q: i wanna install Intel Compiler. But sudo command does not work I write the command like this sudo ./install.sh\nBut ubuntu says\nsudo: ./install.sh: command not found\n\nHow can I install this program?\n\nA: That literally means it can't find the file.\n./install.sh means execute a file in the current directory called install.sh. If you're not in the right directory, you won't have an install.sh to execute and that'll exhibit the error you see.\nSimply put, you're not following your instructions correctly.

Please make sure that Excel is properly installed. If Excel is already installed on your computer, you may need to restart windows.\"\n\nA: PlayOnLinux first creates a environment that will remain separate, also known as a Wine Prefix. Then it will install the software in the separate Wine Prefix. Meaning - To the best of my knowledge - one cannot access other environments.\nWhat you can try is, install one software in to the other Wine Prefix. We will use Origin lab for this. As you mentioned, you already installed Origin lab 8. To avoided confusion I suggest to remove it before continuing. \nGo to the PlayOnLinux Microsoft Office configuration screen and select Miscellaneous then click run a .exe file in this virtual drive. Search and select the Origin Lab 8 setup.exe, follow the setup wizard and afterwards it should be installed. Search for Origin Lab 8 via the unity Dash or via PlayOnLinux. \n\n\nImage excerpt from: Dikkii's Diatribe: How to get round DRM issues with e-books in Linux (epub)\n\nDue note that both Wine Prefixes(Office, origin) are specifically customized for those applications. Installing one in the other might not prove fruitful. \n\nA: Whenever a Windows application is installed through PlayOnLinux, a separate Wine prefix is created.\nTherefore, your Micrsoft Excel and Origin are installed in separate and isolated virtual C drives, which explains why Origin is not able to access Excel.\nThe solution to your problem is to install both the programs in the same wine prefix.\n", "Q: Laptop freezes whenever I unplug/plug in AC adapter I have a Samsung Series 9 laptop, model NP900X4C. For a long time now this laptop has had issues with the battery and AC adapter, like this, which got fixed about six months ago: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/971061\nEver since I upgraded to 14.10 I've had a lot of problems, but the most problematic is that I can no longer unplug or plug in the AC adapter while the system is running. If I do, it simply freezes. Mouse stops responding, keyboard stops responding, everything else appears to stop responding. Just completely freezes. Nothing in any of the logs in Log Viewer. Removing the adapter (if plugging it in was what froze the laptop) or vice versa does nothing. The only way to get it to respond is to hold the power button to turn it off.\nIf the laptop is suspended or hibernated, I can unplug or plug in the adapter and the laptop will work normally after resumed. \nI've tried with both the bundled charger and a third party charger, to rule out problems with the charger. Same effect.\nDoes anyone know what could cause this?\n\nA: I've had the exact same problem about 2 years ago.\nSome background: I was always very careful about using the battery as little as possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always completely discharge the battery before charging again.\n\n*Take it out of the machine whenever I was home and plugged in anyway\n\n*Store it in a cool, dry place\n\n*Stop charging when the charge reads 100%\n\n*for more info : http://batteryuniversity.com\nAnd I had the exact same problem as you after 6 years of that, so I knew the battery had finally died though it still worked (kinda: with the freezes, but what the heck: 6 years!)\nIf you have a relative, friend, colleague, ... that has the same laptop as you, just swap the batteries and you'll know as well your battery is busted.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

I tried rebooting, switching on/off the screen, plugging it in and out but the issue remains. However, if I select the same resolution for both screens, it works fine (but since one screen has a low resolution and has a 5:4 aspect ratio, this is not desirable).

However, all I tried failed.\nI have Ubuntu 14.04.\nIm really a Ubuntu-Rookie,maybe I'm doing something wrong.\nCheers,\nPhilipp \n\nA: Don't hold me to this but I think I may have solved your problem.  Please install the Ubuntu Synaptic Package Manager.  Then open it and in the search box type ATI RADEON.  You should see about 40 results, most of which are listed specifically by the version they are made for.  In your case trusty, and I see two of them and a bunch of generic drivers.  Installing all of them should hurt nothing in so much as I understand it, only those which can work should have any effect on your system.\nPlease note that as much as I have loved ati cards in the past, the ati radeon cards have an awful reputation of instability and dying so if you have difficulties with it, don't blame the drivers.  I can offer you some recommendations for better values in graphics cards, and one in particular which doesn't use a tiny fan to clog but instead a massive heat sink which you can drastically improve the efficiency of with a cheap $3 fan.\n", "Q: Ubuntu goes black after upgrading (using VirtualBox) I am running Ubuntu 14.04 within Oracle VirtualBox 4.3.

Also, for argument's sake, I am able to restart wubi without any problem.  Does this mean that the integrity of the system (particularly, root.disk) has not been compromised?  How would I go about checking this? Would running fsck in recovery mode suffice, or would I need to do something more?\n\nA: You can run file system integrity checks on the host partition (NTFS) as well as on the root.disk (ext3/4). You should always run it in this order, because the root.disk is also a file and if it is corrupt, trying to fsck it won't help and may in fact damage it further.**\nSo, when I am concerned due to some event, for example a hardware crash that Alt+SysRq REISUB couldn't recover and a hard shutdown was required,... then I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Windows and select the host drive, Tools, Repair. If it's\nC: then you'll have to reboot and let Windows boot to get chkdsk\nto run.\n\n*Boot from a Live USB/DVD and fsck the root.disk: \nfsck -fvy /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nYou could probably fsck it in recovery mode also, but usually doing it from a live CD is easiest.\n** I am very convinced of this having worked with many people who've lost their Wubi installs, and it seems that running fsck first (usually via boot-repair) on a corrupted NTFS filesystem can damage the root.disk beyond repair.\n\nA: The \"integrity\" of an installation is ambiguous.\nTo clarify, I assume you mean \"Is the filesystem in a clean state?\"  This is hard to test when your installation is Wubi - you can't easily identify the Wubi file system from a Live environment, for example, as the Wubi file system is actually just stored on Windows itself, as a file container, and not really a true partition.\nGiven that, there's no way to really run a fsck in a sane and easy way on the Wubi installation.  It also is not possible to glean whether the filesystem is clean or not based on whether the system boots - for example, on my previous system, my OS booted, but then had input/output errors due to bad sectors on the hard drive.  The system said the filesystem was \"clean\" but had a bad sector count.  That in and of itself does not, therefore, determine whether the \"integrity\" of a system is compromised.\nYou need to be more clear on what you mean by \"integrity\" in context of your question.\n", "Q: Read Error with new harddrive I put in a new HDD into my stationary computer and have tried to install Windows 7, Fedora 21 and Ubuntu 14.10.\nWindows 7 didn't install at all, when I created the partition and clicked \"Format\" it did some work for a while and then presented me an error (I believe it was 0X80070057).\nFedora 21 installed beautifully but presented me with either \"Read error\" or the Grub menu which allowed me to boot into Fedora, once.\nUbuntu 14.10 installed but it froze upon reboot, when it said to terminate all remaining processes (here I did a hard shutdown and rebooted). I never got into the Grub menu with Ubuntu.\nI should mention that the HDD is a Seagate 1TB, if I swap the cables to a much older Maxtor HDD with Windows 7 Home Premium on it there are no problems booting. Also the BIOS acts strangely with the Seagate drive, sometimes it doesn't add the drive in the boot list but still recognizes it afterwards if I boot a GNU/Linux installer from USB and sometimes it is stuck in BIOS so I have to reboot again.\nEdit: I have done a SMART check with smartctl, both short and long. No errors on the disk.\n\nA: I'm with Xen2050, it isn't clear if you mean you changed the cables as well or not.  And even if you used the same cables, the cables could be bad or stretched out.  certainly try other cables.  I love seagate but it could have been damaged in shipping.  One day I heard a brick hit my porch Newegg shipped a hard drive without so much as a bubble wrap bag around it, just thin plastic.  I gave them such a rant fest they didn't dare refuse to pay return shipping.  Your drive could just be bad.  It happens.\nOr it could be that your computer refuses to recognize hard drives of that size.  depends how old the bios is.\nHere's a test you can do.  While booted to a live boot CD, please open Disk Utility and if the seagate supports SMART see what it has to say about the drive health.  If it claims it is healthy (unlikely) or if it does not support SMART, you can ask that it perform diagnostic tests.\n\nA: So what's your question?\nYou said you get errors, but \"if I swap the cables to a much older Maxtor HDD with Windows 7 Home Premium on it there are no problems booting.\"\nSoooooooooo... you've diagnosed and found bad cables?

I know how to get it running only by accessing the context menu of an existing file. How can I get the script running when there are no files?\n\nA: You can't because of a bug reported here. If they fix the bug, you can do it. The importance of that bug is set to Low, so I wouldn't count on it for a moment, though.\nIn the mean time, you can go back to the parent directory and right-click on the empty directory you want to affect.\nFor example, if you want to use your script on ~/foo/bar/, go to ~/foo/ and right-click on bar.\n", "Q: rails -version command error in Ubuntu 12.04 I have installed ruby and rails in Ubuntu 12.04.

It was too laggy to be listenable.\nI have tried Xubuntu 12.04 and 14.10, and Lubuntu 14.10.

And I have unzipped the jad158e.linux.intel.zip file and am reading the Readme.txt file which says for installation:\n1. Installation.\n\nUnzip jad.zip file into any appropriate directory on your hard drive.\nThis will create two files:\n\n- an executable file named 'jad.exe' (Windows *)\n  or 'jad' (*n*x)\n\n- this README file\n\nNo other setup is required.\n\nAnd then to use it it says to:\n2. How to use Jad\n\nTo decompile a single JAVA class file 'example1.class' \ntype the following:\n\n jad example1.class\n\nAnd I have tried executing the jad file that comes in the zip by locating it in Terminal using the cd command and then executing it with this command:\n./jad\n\nBut that only gets me this result:\n./jad: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI have also tried just locating the file that I want to decompile like it says in the instructions by locating it with cd and then doing:\njad MyJavaApplication.class\n\nBut all that returns is this error:\nNo command 'jad' found, but there are 17 similar ones\njad: command not found\n\nI had a good look at several forums such as this one and this askubuntu question How to install Jad?. But I still haven't been able to get JAD working. I even tried installing Gdebi as suggested in one of the forums that I mentioned above. But no matter what I do I cannot seem to get it to work. So really what my question is is, how do I install and use JAD? \nI heard something about adding it to the PATH variable and that I need to move it to this directory /usr/local/bin, but when moving it to that directory it tells me that I need more privileges even though I am that admin. And I am unsure of how to add it to the PATH variable.\n\nA: \"Workaround\" for the libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 Problem\nIt seems the last update for JAD was from 2001 and was compiled for Linux 2.0.0. The dependency libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 that JAD references probably doesn't exist anymore... (Well it probably does exist somewhere but it would be a mess to install and use it!)\nThe good news is that below the \"Jad 1.5.8e for Linux on Intel platform\" download there is a statically linked version of the software available (\"Jad 1.5.8e for Linux (statically linked)\") that includes all required dependencies and does not require anything to be installed on your system. It will therefor work on any i386 compatible Linux system! I tried in on my 64-bit Linux system and it just works.\nThe jad: command not found problem\nThe problem with running jad MyJavaApplication.class is that it requires JAD to be in your application search path. So you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd to the JAD directory, type export PATH=\"${PWD}:${PATH}\", then cd to the directory with your *.class* file(s) and runjad MyJavaApplication.class`\n\n*Create a directory called bin in your home directory and copy the jad binary there. Then open a new terminal, cd to the directory with your *.class* file(s) and run jad MyJavaApplication.class. (You will only have to copy the jad file once!)\n\n\n*Move the jad file to your /bin directory with: sudo cp /path/to/jad/executable/file /bin.\n\n\n\nNote: JAD is from 2001 and has been developed for Java 1.5/Java 5 currently we use Java 7 and Java 8 is just around the corner, expect problems when decompiling modern Java files!\nDon't forget to upvote, mark as accepted answer if this worked for you!\n\nA: For first problem, you can download static jad form this link, so it needs nothing. For second problem, you can simply do ./jad file.class. \n", "Q: Grub rescue, No access to BIOS and all linux partions have been deleted I think I screwed up my computer.

I recently bought a XPS 15 with Windows 8.1 on it and I'd like to install Ubuntu 14.10 along the side.\nI've copied the .iso file on a USB stick and registered it as a boot option in the BIOS/UEFI. I've disabled in BIOS the Secure Boot option as well as the Intel Fast Response Technology.\nThe issue that I have is that when I choose to run the UEFI ubuntu installation boot option, after about a minute, the startup of windows bootloader kicks in.\nI have to mention, that in the case that i use the secure boot option as enabled, a warning window saying that the signature is invalid is displayed after which the installation is aborted.\nI've also USB Universal Installer with the Ubuntu .iso file, and when using the Legacy boot mode, I get to the installation screen of Ubuntu. I'll probably try to install it this way and afterwards convert it to EFI as described here : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Setup_the_BIOS_in_EFI_or_Legacy_mode\nI've followed the instructions presented on several other resources on this topic : \n\n\n*\n\n*How to install Ubuntu on XPS 15 Platinum - 2014 version properly\nbut I haven't seen any resources on how to deal with the issue that I'm dealing with.\nI've tried before going on with the changes to start the boot-repair-disk as a Boot option and i get the same result as for the Ubuntu installation iso, after aprox. 1 minute Windows bootloader kicks in.\n\nA: After several failed attempts I've made it to install Ubuntu on Dell XPS 15.\nI have disabled the secure boot option and have enabled the legacy boot option.\nAfterwards when restarting, I've used a USB key formatted with FAT32 on which I had the AMD64 distribution of Ubuntu 14.10 prepared (from Windows 8.1) with the Universal USB installer tool. \nIn my case, there was not necessary anymore to add from BIOS another Boot option by selecting the .ISO file from the USB drive, but instead was enough to have Ubuntu installation kit on the USB drive (after being prepared with USB Universal Installer).\nWhen restarting I've pressed F12 and then I saw the Ubuntu installation from the USB key as an UEFI Boot option.\nInstallation went fine (make sure to use 'Something else' in the first step when choosing whether the installation should purge the content of the HDD/SDD), the only thing to keep in mind when doing the installation is to choose /dev/sda as Bootloader location and after the installation is complete restart again directly in Linux in order to be able to run boot-repair tool. In order to avoid any grub related issues (like I did), make sure to eject the USB when restarting the computer after the installation is complete.\n\nA: Just disable secure boot in bios and then enable legacy ROMs. I've confirmed it's as simple as this with the XPS 15's.

Just read the wiki https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent\n", "Q: windows/mac users often cannot see that I added them to skype So I add some Windows or Mac User to Skype, I can see his profile and image. There is also a \"cloud with question mark\" next to his name meaning that he did not add me back. \nI send users some messages, but I often get a reply \"why didn't you add me, I am waiting you on Skype\". \nIs this a built-in bug in Skype? It will sometimes help if I resend invitation, but not always. The user has to be online if I want the 2nd approach to fix the issues. \nIs there a cure to this? I am using Skype 4.3.0.37 (the latest one). \n\nA: I've had it a few years back from Windows to Windows on the same LAN, so has nothing to do with Ubuntu/Windows/Mac. (probably a regression)\nBack then the solution was: Delete user from both sides at the same time, restart Skype on both PC's and let the other one invite you now...  (When sitting next to each other, that's easy, but you're going to have a few expensive phone calls to make)\n", "Q: Unable to open https webpages i am new here so please forgive me if i didnt put this question \"by the rules\".\nSo, the problem: few months ago I wanted to switch from Win to Ubuntu 14.04 on my netbook (that i dont use that much), installation went regularly fine but from the beginning i have this problem that pages where is needed to log in start loading but nothing happens. so, pages like Facebook, Yahoo mail, Chrome Google account, my bank account and so on. For example, Facebook front page is opened normally, i can type in my login data, press enter, my homepage opens and after nothing. Any other pages (on my Facebook account) afterwards starts loading but it doesnt open at all! And it is the same situation with all other previously mentioned https webistes.\nTroubleshooting (to help specify the problem): \n-I tried on the same netbook to install Ubuntu 12.04, the same problems occur.\n-My wife's netbook has Windows, works without problem.\n-In the meantime i bought a new laptop, tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 and also there happens the same.\n- Our \"family\" desktop computer has Ubuntu 12.04, which was installed last year and doesnt have similar issues (and is up-to-date)\n- I usually use Google Chrome, but to test I also tried Firefox and few other browsers, the same problem on all browsers.\n- \"Normal\" http pages open without any problem\nThere are few other similar questions being asked here already, where solution like decreasing MTU, updateing Ubuntu, turning off IPv6, setting up free DNS domain and so on were suggested. I tried some of these and in the meantime got lost from all of these options, so i hoped that you can help me and guide me, to start again and to finally find a solution for this.\nIts a bit longer message, but i thought it can be useful if i write as many details as possible.\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nA: I would try to investigate what's going on behind...\nBy capturing network communication\nInstall wireshark and try to capture the communication, then set filter to https and you may see, which packets are being sent to the server, what's being received then, etc.\nNOTE: If you close all the other programs which generate network traffic, your results will be easier to read.\nWHAT YOU COULD DISCOVER BY THAT?\n--> Whether the communication exists or not. It may be i.e. blocked by some firewall or whatever. You should see that it's communicating with the server in a normal way.\nTry to attach strace to see, what's the browser process doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prepare the page with your login and password\n\n*Check the PID of Firefox: ps aux | grep firefox\n\n*Attach strace to it: strace -tt -p <PID> -f -o strace.log\n\n*Then try to login and wait for a while\n\n*Detach strace by pressing Ctrl-C\nYou should see what's happening there. All the syscalls in the log have a timestamp (-tt option), so if you wait before and after the login and watch the system time, you should be able to determine which syscalls are related to it.\nEverything should be done by one particular thread (so you could look on subsets of the syscalls which have the same thread ID).\nWHAT YOU COULD DISCOVER BY THAT?\n--> What's happening at the IO level of the browser process. You should focus on recv, recvfrom, recvmsg, socket, send, sendto, sendmsg syscalls (they are used for socket communication). You should check whether they are successful (the return values are not negative or like ESOME_ERROR), etc.\nI would check whether other encrypted communication works (like ssh, etc.), I would check whether some proxy settings could be the culprit. I hope it could help you to get closer.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Java I'm a beginner on ubuntu. Not very technical either.

If it helps, the Windows machine has my email, web and light data work, the Lenovo Ubuntu install will be the data wrangling workhorse. My instinct says to make Lenovo the server, since the laptop has its built-in keyboard.\n\nIt really does not matter. I would take the one that you use the most since if you want to tinker with it you will need that machine. The clients just need the software and an  IP adres to probe. The server also needs a lay-out (on where you can reach the screens).  \nRegarding the keyboard: I have an extra keyboard and screen and all the notebooks are closed.  \n", "Q: fan control issues on Toshiba Satellite c655d-s5136 On Ubuntu 14.04, my fan always runs,even when idle.\nThis is not the case when I am in Win7,in which it only runs when I am playing movies.\nThis bothers me greatly and I have followed other threads related to my question and followed the advice given.\nSo I will now output results from some tools that were suggested in related threads so that maybe an advanced user might provide more insight.\nRunning sensors detect -u gives me the following installed module:\n k10temp    AMD Family 10h+ CPU core temperature monitor\n\nRunning modinfo k10temp gives:\nfilename:       /lib/modules/3.13.0-43-generic/kernel/drivers/hwmon/k10temp.ko\nlicense:        GPL\nauthor:         Clemens Ladisch <clemens@ladisch.de>\ndescription:    AMD Family 10h+ CPU core temperature monitor\nsrcversion:     A1B9F52D7E334F02B5B36C3\nalias:          pci:v00001022d00001533sv*sd*bc*sc*i*\nalias:          pci:v00001022d0000141Dsv*sd*bc*sc*i*\nalias:          pci:v00001022d00001403sv*sd*bc*sc*i*\nalias:          pci:v00001022d00001603sv*sd*bc*sc*i*\nalias:          pci:v00001022d00001703sv*sd*bc*sc*i*\nalias:          pci:v00001022d00001303sv*sd*bc*sc*i*\nalias:          pci:v00001022d00001203sv*sd*bc*sc*i*\ndepends:        \nintree:         Y\nvermagic:       3.13.0-43-generic SMP mod_unload modversions \nsigner:         Magrathea: Glacier signing key\nsig_key:        55:AB:2F:E2:8E:D5:C6:0D:F9:58:71:50:D1:73:4C:92:0E:A7:B8:18\nsig_hashalgo:   sha512\nparm:           force:force loading on processors with erratum 319 (bool)\n\nhowever, lsmod | grep k10 gives:\nk10temp                13126  0 \n\nI don't get why the 'used by' column is zero...\nI used ftws fan - to get the following output:\nTest: Simple fan tests.                                                     \n                                                                     :   0.0% /\n  Test fan status.                                                   :   0.0% -\n  Test fan status.                                                   :  50.0% \\\n\n  Test fan status.                                        4 passed\n  Load system, check CPU fan status.                                 :  50.0% |\n  Load system, check CPU fan status.                                 : 100.0% /\n\n  Load system, check CPU fan status.                           \nRunning 1 tests, results appended to results.log\nSSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device2 of type Processor has max cooling state 3\nand current cooling state 0.\nPASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device3 of type LCD has max cooling state 7 and\ncurrent cooling state 0.\n\nTest 2 of 2: Load system, check CPU fan status.\nTest how many fans there are in the system.

Searching for others who have installed Ubuntu on it I find a variety of graphics chip problems (it has the GMA 3650, apparently) and solutions mentioned but, since they are older posts, was wondering if the best approach may well have changed since they were written. Thought it would make sense to ask for the input of those more knowledgeable before proceeding. Thanks very much.\nUpdate:\nInstalled 14.04 and it has none of the resolution issues the old posts mentioned. Unfortunately, video playback is extremely choppy. Probably a result of no dedicated graphics driver as the earlier posts point out.\n\nA: Not exactly an Ubuntu related question, or answer, but... you can replace a laptop screen for as little as $50. (search for D270). I did this with my Thinkpad T510 recently. \nI also have that netbook but not with HDMI output, it's pretty slow. It can't play youtube videos full screen without getting choppy so I don't think you're going to be very impressed with it as a projector. It can run a few open tabs in chrome and that's about it, and I think that's after I upgraded it to 2GB.\nIt might not be worth the time or money :(, I mean for about $100 you can get a new Asus 7\" tablet that'll have more horsepower than this.\n", "Q: Can I partition my boot drive? I have 2 physical drives on my laptop, a 500 GB hard drive and a 120 GB SSD. I installed Ubuntu on the SSD, and it thus became my boot drive.

My first instinct would be to partition this drive, but I'm not too sure. Any ideas on how I should proceed? \n\nA: You're running in the exact same way as me: SSD for the system, HDD for /home.\nUnder Linux, there is a difference between the /boot and the /. The former is a tiny fraction of the system, whereas the latter is everything else (in your case: excluding /home).\nSo your SSD is not only used for the /boot but also for /tmp (where temporary files get created) /bin where executables reside, ...  Basically, if you install software and games they're going to go to the SSD, and the save files will be going to your HDD.\nFor the full documentation head to FileSystem Hierarchy Standard and download the PDF and read all about it.\nSo don't do anything!

If so, how would this be setup?\nI have seen the howto:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\nThat seems to indicate that /home ia a partition mount, therefore it cannot be a subfolder of another partition mount.\nOr is it actually workable to have the home folder as a subfolder within another data partition? I've actually tried it, and it seems to work fine (with usermod -d applied to point user directory to the subfolder location), but the Places menu of Mate still points to /home.\n\nA: I think you can put your home folder wherever you want, it's just an entry in /etc/passwd (and maybe /etc/passwd- too).\nEditing the file(s) directly & moving your home folder yourself might work, or you can use usermod and it should do it for you, see man usermod:\n   -d, --home HOME_DIR\n       The user's new login directory.\n\n       If the -m option is given, the contents of the current home\n       directory will be moved to the new home directory, which is created\n       if it does not already exist.\n\nYou even tried it and it seems to work, if some mate menu's are still using old folders you can change them to the new folders... something like \"find all instances of /home/oldhome and change to /some/newhome\" might work, find / grep / sed could do that, maybe even this \"quick hack\":\nfind /some/newhome -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i -e 's/\\/home\\/oldhome/\\/some\\/newhome/g'\n\nbut that's a separate question...\n\nFYI, if you want to change the default home \"base dir\" (the /home part) and you'll be using the adduser program, you can edit the /etc/adduser.conf and change the DHOME=/home line to whatever you prefer.\nIf you're using useradd (not recommended) it's supposed to change the default \"base dir\" by using useradd -D -b/newhome but it's been temperamental in my tests.\n", "Q: Rotate a specific page of a pdf file? I have a multi-page pdf file, and I want to rotate a specific page 90 degrees clockwise, to obtain a new pdf file which has the same pages as the original pdf, but with this specific page rotated.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: You can also use pdfshuffler, which has a GUI interface. You can download it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfshuffler/ or using ubuntu software centre or synaptic package manager. \nIt allows to do exactly what you want, you can graphically choose which pages to rotate, if more than one page is wanted. You can also do cropping and reordering of the pages. \n\nA: \nNOTE: This solution only works for Ubuntu versions up through 17.10.  Ubuntu 18.04 and later do not have the pdftk package due to the packages being removed due to the dependencies to run the package being removed from the Archive for Bionic and later.\n\nNOTE2: even if officially removed from 18.04, there is a snap version of pdftk; you can install it with snap install pdftk. \n\n\nYou can use pdftk. Install it with sudo apt-get install pdftk. Then, suppose you want to rotate the page 4 of your document test.pdf 90 degree clockwise: \npdftk test.pdf cat 1-3 4east 5-end output out.pdf \n\nYou can do much more in pdftk, changing page order, rotation, merging various PDF files. The manual page is your friend here. \nFrom man pdftk, referring to the cat operation: \n\n<input PDF handle>[<begin page number>[-<end page num‐\n                   ber>[<qualifier>]]][<page rotation>]\n             Where the handle identifies one of the input PDF files, and\n             the beginning and ending page numbers are one-based refer‐\n             ences to pages in the PDF file.  The qualifier can be even or\n             odd, and the page rotation can be north, south, east, west,\n             left, right, or down.\n\n\n\nA: I have very good experience with PDF arranger. It is my preferred GUI tool. You can reorder, rotate, delete, insert pages using this application by mouse, save only selected pages, view page thumbnails (and much more). You can install it using:\nsudo apt install pdfarranger\n\n\nA: The Master PDF Editor is also capable of rotating single Pages. Also in the Free Version (Speaking for version 4.3.80)\n\nA: This is also possible through a website like http://online-pdf.org, I think you need to upload the file twice, in one you select the page you like to rotate, and in the other you select the rest. You're selections should be merged after this.\n", "Q: Windows 7 & 8.1 -> Ubuntu 14 - Folder Sharing NOOB LINUX user here...\nRecently installed Ubuntu 14 on a Intel NUC.

So you could run the following command in a terminal:\nfind /usr/share/applications -type f -name '*.desktop' -exec cp --target-directory ~/Desktop/ {} +\n\nbut this would create a copy of every single launcher on your desktop. (possibly a few hundred, depending on your environment)\nYou could browse /usr/share/applications in the file manager, and manually copy them for relevant applications to the desktop.

I'm currently on Ubuntu 12.04 and I have ruby version 1.9. 3 installed. I want to install the latest ruby version as I need it for SASS compass to do my front end work. I did research and noticed that its best to just use RVM (ruby version manager) to manage your ruby versions.\nI'm trying to install rvm, but I'm have a frustratingly hard time of doing it as all the instructions online seem to have a quirk here or there. Its either the instructions are outdated or it just works for that specific setup.\nI tried following this guide as its posted everywhere on the interwebs:\n\nInstallation is done via the awesome new \"pipe into sh\" route:\ncurl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable Load it:\nsource ~/.rvm/scripts/'rvm' If you want to use version 1.9. 3, just go\n  ahead and:\nrvm use 1.9. 3 Want to test with 1.9. 2?

So am I suppose to create the directory manually? Or was something else suppose to do that? The instructions doesn't specify.

Sure I can continue googling and find other instructions and constantly copy/paste into my terminal in hopes that something sticks and it all of a sudden works, but have no idea what happen due to massive copy/pasting spam.\nAnother option I was thinking, maybe I should just uninstall ruby and whatever else is related to it? And install it from scratch? So do I just do a apt-get uninstall ruby? I doubt its that simple to uninstall right? =)\n\nA: Try the following (From the official install guide):\n\\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable\nNotice the \\ which is done to make sure your using the curl binary and not an alias.

In any event, running boot-repair on Wubi installs is not a good idea... because it's not written by someone familiar with how Wubi works.\nWhat you should do on a Wubi install is first run chkdsk from Windows, because the host filesystem is often what is corrupted, and only then, if necessary, fsck the root.disk. \nBut boot-repair will always offer to fsck the root.disk and this can result in a catastrophic loss. Right now it's reported a zero file size.\nSo, you should run chkdsk /r on the host drive and see if you have an intact \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk.

When pasting into the Terminal, use Ctrl+Shift+V, NOT Ctrl+V.\nMount the partition your Ubuntu Installation is on. If you are not sure which it is, launch GParted (included in the Live CD) and find out. It is usually a EXT4 Partition. Replace the XY with the drive letter, and partition number, for example: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt.\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nNow bind the directories that grub needs access to to detect other operating systems, like so.\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev \nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts \nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc \nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nNow we jump into that using chroot.\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nNow install, check, and update grub.\nThis time you only need to add the drive letter (usually a) to replace X, for example: grub-install /dev/sda, grub-install –recheck /dev/sda.\ngrub-install /dev/sdX\n\ngrub-install --recheck /dev/sdX\n\nupdate-grub\n\nNow grub is back, all that is left is to exit the chrooted system and unmount everything.\nexit &&\nsudo umount /mnt/sys \nsudo umount /mnt/proc\nsudo umount /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo umount /mnt/dev\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nShut down and turn your computer back on, and you will be met with the default Grub2 screen.\nIf the above not yet fixed try to add the below parameter to grub.\nStart your system and wait for the GRUB menu to show, if you don't see a GRUB menu, press and hold the left Shift key right after starting the system\nNow highlight the kernel you want to use, and press the e key.

Would the ubuntu community be helpful to me ?\n\nA: Yes. Ubuntu 12.10 is not supported anymore and as such, third party software like Google Chrome might stop to work. Best is to just upgrade to the latest supported version (like 14.04) if you are able to.\nFrom my experience, the community support is also generally better with later releases since over time more and more users switch to those newer versions.

It sometimes makes rapid jumps, not traveling at a consistent speed, making it very difficult to target various objects on the screen. Sometimes the mouse pointer just disappears for periods of time, and very often the mouse pointer flickers off and on. For example, as I am typing now, each time I begin typing the mouse pointer starts flickering, and when I stop typing the flickering stops (even when the mouse is positioned away from the window I am typing in). Sometimes the mouse pointer disappears when inside of a certain window, but then re-appears outside of that window. The only word I can use to describe the problem is \"erratic\" behavior. It is really a consitent problem, every time I boot up, all the time.\nThank you!\n\nA: I know it is not an explanation, but I have had the same issue with a wireless microsoft mouse. \nIt moved erratically and the movement speed was way off compared to the settings.\nThe solution was to remove the mouse from USB and plug it in again.

The current way I do this is in two steps: 1) install metapackage, and 2) purge unwanted packages. I wonder whether there is a more efficient and clean method to do this. \nI thought apt-get would accept an instruction like install this except these but very surprisingly it seem not. \nA potential solution would be to run the command sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop, then select No, and copy all the packages listed in the terminal, manually deleting the undesired ones. However this could be even more time consuming than the two-step procedure mentioned earlier, also risking to end up with bad dependencies. \nAny ideas on how to make this in one simple command-line instruction?\n\nA: You could script the task. I'm pretty sure I posted this elsewhere, but can't find it now. First, create a file with the packages you don't want. For example:\n$ cat dont-want.txt\nmemtest86+\nwireless-tools\nfirefox\nevince\n\nThen parse the output of apt-cache depends:\napt-cache depends xubuntu-desktop | awk '$1 == \"Depends:\" {print $2}' | grep -vFf dont-want.txt\n\nThis should include the packages on which the metapackage directly depends, without the packages you excluded. Then you can use xargs to install:\napt-cache depends xubuntu-desktop | \n  awk '$1 == \"Depends:\" {print $2}' | \n  grep -vFf dont-want.txt |\n  sudo xargs apt-get install\n\nIf the unwanted package is not a direct dependency, you would need to use apt-rdepends instead of apt-cache depends.\nYou can also use Apt Pinning to enforce the ban: How to forbid a specific package to be installed?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 won't boot after a drive sector was destroyed Yesterday, when I was working with my Ubuntu 14.10 (x64) and wanted to save an attachment from an e-mail in Thunderbird, there was a dialog saying that the file could not be written to the /tmp directory.

I am new to ubuntu and I am using 12.10 distro.\nWhy are different commands required to install a sofware, what do these commands do ?\n\nA: Installing most softwares on Ubuntu are actually easier than on Windows once you get the hang of it.\nInstallation of packages can be done via the Ubuntu Software Center, a Graphical User Interface based application where installing an application only involves the clicking of the Install button.\nAlternatively, the Terminal can also be used to install packages using apt-get. All you have to do is to open the Terminal and enter the command -\nsudo apt-get install <packagename>\n\nFor example, if you want to install VLC Media Player -\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nAs you may notice, both the above methods are quite straightforward and do not require the user to navigate through web pages searching for .exe or .msi files to download and then install by clicking on the Next option numerous times, as is the case in Windows.\n\nA: Linux and Windows are two different things - and are completely different organized. Linux, Ubuntu in this case is organized in packages. A package is a part of the whole system that has a specific exercise. And also applications are divided in at least one package that can be installed through a so called package manager. In Ubuntu and other derivatives this is apt-get, or you can use a gui called synaptic.\nEvery packet has a name to identify, and can be installed with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install your_package_name\n\nFor example, to install Skype type:\nsudo apt-get install skype\n\nAnd to remove a packet, type remove instead of install.\nTo see all commands/operants open the terminal and type\napt-get --help\n\n\nA: It not obligatory to use commands. You can do most things with User Interface.But commands are easier, faster ways of installing software and managing your computer in general.\nIf you want to install software in Ubuntu the easiest way is through Ubuntu Software Centre. Go into the Software centre, choose an app you want and click Install button. \nSecond way to install an app is Synaptic Manager.Again choose an app, tick the check button, mark for install and Apply.\nIf you want to install a software outside  Ubuntu repositories, for example Google chrome, you should download .deb format file for it. After you can install it them through software centre or install it using Gdebi .\nYou can get both Synaptic and Gdebi through software centre.\nFirst of all I strongly recommend to upgrade your Ubuntu to a supported release.\n", "Q: iMac G4/800 (2.1) - nouveau or nv? I'm having fun getting Ubuntu going on an old PowerPC G4 iMac with integrated nVidia grahics - Geforce 2 MX / NV11.\n(Fun of course is the goal, as the likelihood of this old system being useful is quite low, but hey.)\nI successfully installed Ubuntu using the mini-ISO installation method, and opted for the Xubuntu desktop, as I've had success with Xfce on Intel PCs with NV10-series video hardware. (Not with nouveau, but with nVidia's old proprietary drivers which obviously aren't available for PPC.)\nI am able to log in to a shell with the yaboot arguments Linux nomodeset single as recommended by numerous FAQs out there.

(Most online guides say 'no, just use nv, and I never had luck on PC getting Nouveau going on NV10 hardware without significant display issues) \n2) If nouveau cannot be made to work, can the nv driver be successfully compiled and used on 14.04 with Xfce?\n3) Should I stop wasting time and simply downgrade to Ubuntu 12.04? Many sources claim that this works 'best' out of the box, and nv can be made to work under this O/S.\n\nA: I have an iMac G4 with a clock frequency of 1 GHz and the same graphics card. Currently my mum is using it, running Debian 7.7 (stable). In the past I experimented a lot with the computer, having tried Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and even YellowDog Linux. Debian was the least trouble, especially more recently, where PPC support is declining everywhere. I don't think I had to do anything special to get the graphics running.\nAnyway as far as I know nouveau is much better than the nv driver. Did you confuse \"nv\" with \"nvidia\", the proprietary driver? I don't think that can be made to run under PPC, since it contains/ depends upon a \"binary blob\" for x86.\nAfter all Ubuntu is based on Debian, so both largely use the same configuration tools.\n\nA: Answering myself just for historical reasons. I no longer have this hardware.\nI ended up just downgrading to Xubuntu 12.04 and using nv - under this configuration the system worked fairly well - good enough to be Freecycled to a a new home (where the person just ended up reinstalling Mac OS)\nThere just was no way that I could find to make nouveau work properly with that particular NV10 chipset.\n", "Q: Multitouch with Touchegg on SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad I am running Ubuntu 14.10 with Unity.

Please give a correct solution. On this issue.\n\nA: The heating issue is mainly caused due to excessive CPU usage. The fact is Ubuntu is a Desktop OS, so heating is not a big issue. So, the solution we can apply here is install a Power Management module (it worked for me).\nInstall TLP on Ubuntu\nTLP is an advanced power management command line tool for Linux that tries to apply these settings / tweaks for you automatically, depending on your Linux distribution and hardware.TLP applies these settings automatically on startup and every time you change the power source. \nBefore proceeding with the installation, there are a couple of things you need to do:\nFirst, if you've added any power saving settings / scripts (e.g.: in /etc/rc.local), remove them or else TLP may not work properly:\nsudo apt-get remove laptop-mode-tools\n\nUbuntu (and Linux Mint, etc.) users can install TLP by using its official PPA. Add the PPA and install TLP using the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw\n\nTLP will automatically start upon system startup, but to avoid having to restart the system to get it running for the first time, you can start it (required only the first time) using the following command:\nsudo tlp start\n\nThere are some optional packages you can install for some extra features: \nsmartmontools - needed to display disk drive S.M.A.R.T. data; \nethtool - needed to disable wake on lan.\nInstall these tools using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install smartmontools ethtool\n\nWhile the default TLP configuration should be enough to provide optimized power saving out of the box, you can modify the TLP settings and access some advanced features by editing the TLP configuration file called \"tlp\" located under /etc/default/. To open this file as root with Gedit, use the following command:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/tlp\n\nMake any changes you like, then save the file and to apply the changes, either reboot the system or simply run \nsudo tlp start\n\nFor Ubuntu 14.10, you can use Linux Thermal Daemon (thermald) which is a tool developed by Intel's Open Source Technology Center which monitors and controls the CPU temperature, preventing it from overheating.\n", "Q: Cannot access Disk Drives in single-boot Ubuntu Sysytem I uninstalled my windows through OS-Uninstaller in Ubuntu.

What are the tips to success?\n\nA: Are you trying to hot clone? If so, you need to use VMware vCenter Converter Standalone 4.0.1 I believe. First create an account at my.vmware.com, then search for \"VMware vCenter Converter Standalone\". On the \"License & Download\" tab at the bottom of all the 5.x downloads is 4.0.1.\nI just tried what you're attempting. I found 4.0.1 to be the last supported version for Linux. I installed it on my Ubuntu 14.04 laptop (that also has VMware player). To run after installing, issue:\nsudo /etc/init.d/vmware-converter start \nI tried to do the P2V but got stuck on the \"destination\" section during conversion -- it kept asking me for credentials but didn't realize it was asking for an ESXi host somewhere else on the network to \"accept\" the VM. I never did succeed though because I don't have hardware support for an ESXi host, and also don't know if I could alternatively use VMware Player on my laptop to \"accept\" the VM.\nI am not 100% positive on my answer I'm just giving feedback because I just did this last week. Or tried to anyway.\nSee diagram about hot cloning Linux on top of page 15 here, 4.0.1 User guide: http://www.vmware.com/pdf/converter_standalone_guide401.pdf \n", "Q: Is it possible to run a script on keyboard input language change?

I have a 120 SSD Drive partitioned to 80GB for the Windows 7, 24GB for Ubuntu and a 7GB Partition for ubuntu swap space.     When installing ubuntu there is no option to install next to windows 7.    So i choose the do something else option.   Once the partitioning screen loads up i make a 600mb EFI boot, I choose the 24GB for root partition and the 7GB partition for swap.      Once Installed reboot and no Grub or any kind of option to dual boot.   it's just normal boot up into windows.     even if i press the f12 while booting and choose to boot from the hard drive i installed ubuntu on it says no operating system detected or gives me an error of some sort.    I've tried this every way possible.   Couple months ago i had it working but it was set up to where i had to go into the Bios and change it from UEFI to Legacy and back every time i would want to switch from windows to Ubuntu.    I've tried BCD easy boot although i'm not sure if correctly set it up the time i tried it.   And I've also Tried WUBI.   No sucess.   I'm booting from Usb.     Can anyone shed some light.   Would be highly appreciated,  i have been wanting to get this dual boot properly set up for a while now it's just frustrating as im sure u understand.\nThank you. \n\nA: What you want to do is to bridge 2 generations: you want to install the latest and greatest Ford Mustang 2015 engine in the original 1964 Convertible body.  (Ubuntu in UEFI mode and Windows in MBR mode) which then means: changing the BIOS every time you want to switch!\nSo sometimes you have to tell people: Don't do it!\nUEFI was (and up to a certain point: still is) just a scheme to allow computer vendors to lock out OSes like Linux (and companies who re-program the BIOS of their machines still can!) so there is no need to run in UEFI mode!\n", "Q: File ownership changes on save for \"some\" files On my server, I have two accounts; one for me and one for my wife. We both share the same group as our primary group.\nFor simple text files, when I own the file and she edits and saves that file, ownership and group do not change. They stay as me the owner. Same thing happens when she owns a file and I edit and then save it.\nBut when either one of us owns a Photoshop file (.PSD) and the other one edits it, the ownership changes to the person who last saved the file. I could see ownership changing if I was doing a \"Save As\", but I'm not; just hitting the save.\nWe're both using own own desktops and getting our files off the server through Samba.\nAnyone have any thoughts as to what might be causing this particular behavior? Maybe it's normal for all I know, but if it was it seems like it would do the same to simple text files. \n\nA: It sounds like the file is actually being deleted and recreated. I doubt photoshop is doing any kind of chmod'ing in the background.\n", "Q: How to Uninstall Ubuntu Linux from Secondary Drive? this question might seem pretty basic and straightforward but I wanted to make I do it properly without data loss.\nI have two drives. My primary being windows 8. My secondary is partitioned with one part being Ubuntu and the other partion being room for storing my back up files, important files. \nSo my question is how do I remove the partition and uninstall Ubuntu from my secondary? I'd also like the space freed up from the process to go back and combine to one partition so I have more storage space for my back up files.\nAs you can see I gave ubuntu way to much space.\nC drive is windows 8. E Drive is my storage drive.\n\n\nA: It's ironic that you're asking about this in an Ubuntu forum.\nYou can delete and expand partitions right from the disk management screen you're at. \nSimply delete that 634G partition, then click on the E: partition, and choose \"extend volume\". Once you delete the parition, everything on it will disappear. There's nothing to uninstall.\n\nA: Just deleting the partition and extending the other partition should do the trick. Just be careful about that 9.7GB partition near the beginning of that disk. If you are booting with GRUB (the Ubuntu boot manager) and it's installed on that partition (although large for a boot partition) you may not be able to boot into Windows. You would then need to run start up repair to replace your MBR and boot sector.\nIf Windows was installed after Ubuntu, and it boots right into windows you may not have to worry about it.\n", "Q: Other answers on how to empty trash via command line are not working Where else can I find files that are showing up in my trash can?\nUbuntu 12.04, Headless, VNC, Gnome-fallback.\nI have a stubborn trash can that I suspect is from deleting files from command that belonged to me, but was deleted as root. I think the deleted files were from another drive, but I'm not sure. I delete stuff as root all the time and it doesn't show up in my trash, but something is different with this scenario.\nThe common answer is:\nsudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*\n\nBut this command does not work. My user and the root user do not have any files or folders in the .local/share/Trash folder, yet my user trash can has big files that I cannot find on the system to delete.\nThanks.\n\nA: If they show up in the Trash section they must be somewhere, I suggest you to run:\n$ sudo find / -iname \"*name_of_one_of_those_big_files*\"\n\nAnd wait to see if it shows anything.\n", "Q: HP Elitebook Revolve 810 trackpad not working I just installed the newest version of Ubuntu today and the trackpad will click, but will not right click or scroll. I'm fairly new to Linux so any help would be extremely helpful.\n\nA: You might have some luck altering the options for the trackpad's driver (if it is Synaptics).  Open a terminal, and take a look at the output from the following command\nsynclient -l\n(which gives options and corresponding values for the trackpad if the Synaptics driver is being used).  I have a different machine (MacBook Pro) so my options are probably different from what you need, but for what its worth my value for the VertTwoFingerScroll option is 1, TapButton = 2, and ClickFinger2 = 3.  Not sure if these are the appropriate options, but they may help.\n(To set an option, use synclient option=value, for example synclient TapButton=2).\n", "Q: No disk space left on root When I restarted my computer, which is running Ubuntu 12.04, I got a message that there was 0 disk space left on /.\n$ df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda2        19G   18G     0 100% /\nudev            7.8G  4.0K  7.8G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           1.6G  944K  1.6G   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            7.9G  512K  7.9G   1% /run/shm\noverflow        1.0M  1.0M     0 100% /tmp\n/dev/sda1        89M   33M   51M  40% /boot\n/dev/md127p1    917G  179G  692G  21% /mnt/data0\n/dev/sda5       892G  137G  710G  17% /home\n\nUsing the Disk Usage Analyzer, I again see that / is 100% full, with 54% in /mnt and 43% in /home. I have a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a RAID 1 array mounted at /mnt/data0. Why does this disk usage show up within /?\n\n*I have deleted 10s of GB of unnecessary files from /home with seemingly no affect on the disk usage percent in / (it still says 100% usage). Is there somewhere else I should be looking to delete files?\n\n\nA: /home is on a different filesystem (last line of your df command output) and /mnt/data0 doesn't show up within / but as 21% full.\nIn order to get your system back to work, you need to free space on the / filesystem only, where also your /root directory is located.\nBest thing is to check, where all the space has gone with the du -s command:\nI.e.:\ncd /\ndu -s *\n\nThen cd to the directory with the largest number in front and type:\ndu -s *\n\nAnd so on. At some point you will find some large files and may choose to remove them to free up space.\n", "Q: Vim: Supertab not working I'm trying to make supertab working, it's not working when I press tab, not autocompleting python.

How do i fix this? Here is my story: I have decided to format my windows 8.1 with \"onekey recovery\" button of my Lenovo Ideapad Z510. When completed, i have no problems about windows, however grub2 have been lost. \nThen i have started to fixing my grub because i have not lost my ubuntu yet. I have tried a lot, but i couldn't. Then i have decided to install ubuntu 14.04.1 again, and i have done it. \nI have used my computer as i want for 1 day, the pc starts with grub2, then i choose windows or ubuntu etc..\nThen, suddenly, when i have restarted my windows, grub2 have not came, i couldnt understand whats wrong. Then have i started ubuntu live on my usb again and tried to solve via terminal codes. \nI followed instructions from internet, i mounted some drives etc. etc. then i hang about looking for codes for unmounting them. \nI have started to install ubuntu again, installer gave an error again ( we have found unmounted drives etc. should we unmount them etc.) i clicked yes then i have been shocked!\nhttp://i.hizliresim.com/jv8oYD.png\nThere are only 5 partitions now, which was 8-9 before. And as you see, somethings are going very bad!\nI have tried to solve this with \"onekey recovery\" button again, which gives me (like)\"cannot find files\" error now. I think i permanently deleted recovery files of windows, and deleted windows boot mgr (because it doesnt appear).\nI'll check for my lenovo's warranty service,but am not sure they will fix this.\nWhat do you think, can i solve this problem or i have just turned into my pc a basic-calculator? Did i kill it?\nI am now enjoying my live ubuntu :D (sorry for grammar etc. mistakes )\nNote: my pictures, videos etc. are not important for me,, im just looking for save my system.\n\nA: 2 Possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contact Lenovo Turkey and ask them for a \"Recovery DVD\" (Depending on the vendor, they will do this for free, charge just Shipping&Handling, or charge you a lot)\n\n*Delete all partitions, create 1 swap partition with size equal to twice your RAM, create a 64 GB / partition and a 1TB /home partition and install Ubuntu with all its updates.  Then install wine under Ubuntu and forget Windows ever existed.

However, I'd like to avoid this mainly because it takes up a lot of space. \nWhat I would like to do would be something like this\n\n\n*\n\n*avconv runs in background\n\n*do { some processing; make image edits; send result to avconv; } repeat for all images\n\n*quit avconv saving the resulting video\n\n\nHow can I make on the fly picture edits when creating a time lapse video?\n\nA: Can't be done exactly the way you want it done, and you can come close, but it'll take a lot of fiddling.\nI also understand the rationale behind it: You want to treat the output of the convert function as temporary files that can be deleted afterwards, so instead of:\n@!/bin/bash\nconvert -stretch 1280x720 -background none ~/Pictures/MyTimelapseImages/*.jpg ~/tmp/MyTempImages/*.jpg\navconv -i ~/tmp/MyTempImages/*.jpg ~/Videos/MyTimeLapsVideo.mkv\n\nyou want to start the image conversion process on one CPU core and at the same time start the video conversion process on another CPU core and delete the files already processed by avconv (to conserve disk space)\nAnd it's the latter that will take the fiddling, because you'll have to cpulimit both avconv and convert that they're in nearly perfect sync with each other and then create yet another process that'll clean up the processed files. \nSo, yes, can be done and if you're working for a huge company that wants you to save 1,000s of bucks on their 100+ server farm, it'll be worth it.

Problem is I can't get the graphics drivers to install correctly.  She has the HP Envy 17 2090NR (http://www.amazon.com/HP-ENVY-17-2090NR-Notebook-Silver/dp/B004SBBAV0) with the ATI 6850/Intel 3000 combo(pretty sure the intel model is accurate anyway).  I have tried installing Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 and several different methods of installing the drivers.  After the driver install I attempt to run the sudo aticonfig --initial with varying degrees of success.  No matter what though I reboot to low graphics mode!  I have been in and read through the logs and it seems to be related to Ubuntu having no clue which graphics option to use.  I am not entirely sure how to pull the logs from said device but am willing to follow any advice that could be given.\nConfiguration

It boots to a black screen with a flashing cursor.\nThere is no GRUB interface at the point it hangs; I get no Ubuntu splash screen, no options menu, nothing. Hitting shift does nothing, likewise hitting F6.\nIn my BIOS options there is no option for secure boot.\nMy computer is set up to boot from USB\nI've used several different live USB/live CD programs to try and make a startup key including Universal USB installer and UNetbootin and nothing has changed. \nI very little experience setting up a Linux system.\n\nA: Have you ever been able to boot from any USB on that computer? If not, then maybe it just doesn't like USB booting, or hates that particular USB device.\nI'd try a cd/dvd/dvd-rw disk, should definitely work for any computer that can run WinXP. \nBut if your computer is really that old, the regular Ubuntu might be too slow, may want to look into Xubuntu, Lubuntu, or a ubuntu-derived distro that's \"lighter\", or even Debian-based CrunchBang (that uses the Openbox WM). See http://distrowatch.com/ to search.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Just thought it could be your old computer is only 32-bit, and if you're trying a 64-bit Ubuntu (or any 64-bit OS) it won't be able to boot either...\n\n\nAccording to ark.intel.com for \"Intel® Pentium® 4 Processor 2.40 GHz, 512K Cache, 533 MHz FSB\" (could be yours from your comment) it's \"Instruction Set\" is 32-bit, so you should use 32-bit OS's. I think it supports PAE so should be ok even if have >4GB ram, and some distros require PAE support too (Linux Mint & Ubuntu?).\n(32-bit seems to use less RAM anyway, and only a little bit slower, I prefer it)\n\nA: What OS are you attempting to create the Live USB in?  Would I be right in guessing WinXP?\nI had similar issues and used LiveUSB Creator within Windows.  Here's a link:\nhttps://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/\nIf you are using a Linux system while creating the live usb, give mintstick (from the Linux Mint repositories):  Here is a link for the respositories:\nhttp://www.packages.linuxmint.com/\nThese are all .deb packages and are easily installable on Ubuntu/Debian based distros.  If you are using Linux I would think that picking the Linux 13 page and scrolling down until to \"mintstick\" would work.\nLastly, there have been some instances where I have tried to do installs on older boxes and found that by using a liveDVD or liveCD rather than a usb stick worked.\nGood Luck!!!\n\nA: I have it! ... or at least I've experienced this.  If I'm correct the difficulty you are having isn't actually a boot issue but a problem Ubuntu brought about for certain Gateway laptops after version 9.10 or so.  One version upgrade and bam, black screen at boot time, but I found a work around.\nNext time you try to boot and the screen goes black press ctrl-alt-F1 and then ctrl-alt-F7.  Something about putting it in terminal mode and pulling it back out caused my graphics to return.  I had to do this for more than a year before I realized that as much as I loved that laptop, it was just too annoying.  I preferred to explain to friends that it was an extra level of security in so much as nobody could log into my laptop if they couldn't even see the login screen.\n", "Q: Trying to setup a mail server on ubuntu 14.04 I'm trying to set up a mail server but get the following errors whilst trying to connect with thunderbird:\nJan  7 03:11:59 Ubuntu-1404-trusty-64-minimal postfix/smtpd[6752]: lost connection after CONNECT from xxx\nJan  7 03:11:59 Ubuntu-1404-trusty-64-minimal postfix/smtpd[6752]: disconnect from xxx\n\nand \nJan  7 03:11:59 Ubuntu-1404-trusty-64-minimal dovecot: imap-login: Disconnected (no auth attempts in 0 secs): user=<>, rip=xxx, lip=xxx, TLS: SSL_read() failed: error:14094418:SSL routine$\n\nI'm using dovecot, postfix and mysql for the mail server.

Thanks.\n\nA: You usually need to enter your password (or sudo to root) in order to install things, and xampp won't be any different. It's completely normal to do that. Root privileges are needed to install services that start at boot, etc. It doesn't necessarily mean the programs / services will run as root unless they've been designed to do so. I don't think you've put yourself in any danger.  \n", "Q: facing problems at ubuntu partitioning while installing 32-bit Ubuntu alongside a 32-bit windows 8.1 I'm new to Linux like i have used live Ubuntu but now i'm wishing to install it but the problem is when i approach at partition manager of Ubuntu it only shows my windows 8.1 installation dish and all other space in a single form (i have a 500GB HDD installation disk drive of 8.1 is 40 GB) and all other partitions are not shown.So i need guidance to install Ubuntu in local disk drive G (on my Pc )so that i Don't have to suffer from data loss.Step by step Guide would be nice as i understand nothing about LInux partitioning\n\nA: You note that all of the space aside from your Win8 installation is in a single form.  Is that form \"unallocated space\"?  In that case you can choose that space as the space used by the Ubuntu installation.  To do that, follow this link and go to step 4: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop \nThe second part of your question is that you want the ubuntu install on your G:\\ drive without losing your data.  Unfortunately, you can't run Linux on an NTFS partition (which your G:\\ drive is).  However, you can MOUNT the volume alongside your Linux ext4 filesystem when running your desktop and still access those files.  As long as you only format the unallocated space, you're not going to lose anything on your G:\\ drive for Windows.\nHope this helps :3\nPS:  If you only have a small amount of unallocated space, you will need to edit the size of your G:\\ drive, which is a whole nother beast.  You can do that using gparted http://gparted.org/\n\nA: Partitioning is very much the same in Linux as it is in Windows. They just use different names for things.\nThe easiest thing to do is to go back in to Windows, find the Disk Management control panel, and create some free (unallocated) space on your drive for Ubuntu to work with. \nIf you have removed everything off your Drive G: in windows, go ahead and remove that parition, so that Ubuntu can use it to install. There's a basic guide for disk management operations at howtogeek. \n", "Q: how to Dual boot win 7 and ubuntu? i am currently using win 7 and am planning on installing ubuntu alongside win7 but i have unable to do so.\nPreviously i used to install ubuntu inside win using wubi but this time i wanted it as a native os .\nI have a 500 gb hd.\nc: win 7 (71gb capacity)\nd: some stuff (289gb capcaity )\ne: (98 gb capcaity )\ni want to install it in e drive. since it is having free space so it shrank the vol and created an un allocated space of 35gb for installing.\nwhile in ubuntu install process i choose something else and tried to choose 35gb partiton as to create root,boot and home partitions it wont select.\nall the drives c,d,f are in ntfs ...even while formatting wont show anyother option except ntfs\n\nA: Please don't try to set the partition sizes or format said partitions for Ubuntu.  Ubuntu's installer will do that for itself.  It will help you to partition the drive and it will format the partition in its own ext4 format, not NTFS.\n(I'm cooking dinner or this might be more complete.  I may come back later with more tips.  Please feel free to comment.)\n\nA: A basic disk can only have 4 primary partitions. If you already have 3 primaries defined, Ubuntu may not have enough to work with. I'm pretty sure Ubuntu needs to create at least two in order to function. On a basic disk, it might even need 3 - one for root, one for boot, and one for swap. \nRemove that E: drive partition (once you've moved everything off it, if there's anything there) and see if that lets things install. If not, you'll need to convert the disk to Dynamic partitions, and see if that works instead. \nIf you have a spare drive around, you'll probably have a much easier time of it. Borrow one from a friend if you don't have one.

Since you have just removed that from the bind setting it will fail (mongod is now listening only on the LAN IP).\nHence you have to explicitly specify the LAN IP when you invoke the mongo shell to ensure you connect to the bound address.  In my case, my LAN IP is 192.168.2.40 so I can connect on that address like so:\nmongo 192.168.2.40\nMongoDB shell version: 2.6.6\nconnecting to: 192.168.2.40:27017/test\n>\n\nFor reference you run the shell command without arguments it is basically the equivalent of this:\nmongo 127.0.0.1:27017\n\nYou can bind to the LAN IP and the loopback also either by removing the bind setting entirely (will listen on all interfaces) or by adding 127.0.0.1 after the LAN IP (comma seperated).\n", "Q: Screen brightness control not working: Lenovo g50-45: AMD Radeon: Ubuntu 14.04 I've a Lenovo G50-45 machine with AMD processor [Radeon APU A4-6000 with R2 Graphics].

Back in Precise 12.04 I was using a GUI Viewer for *.patch files which only opened them for reading, which is fine, as they are generated by cmd. line. This GUI did set itself as default I think shortly after I installed Bazaar related packages (bzr-explorer, etc ...). I didn't paid much attention to know exactly what was this app. On occasion I used gEdit whenever I needed to modify a patch file.\nHowever upgrading to Trusty 14.04 and transferring all my set of packages, right now I have Scribes Text Editor which sets itself as default viewer. Unfortunately this viewer allows (by default) writing in a .patch file ... has a deep black background and no side panel giving access to the different patched files.\nThe Viewer I was using in Precise 12.04 had a white background, color text, and on the left pane the list of modified files which was handy to navigate a whole patched directory structure.

I recently bought a new keyboard with several special functions. These include key lights, macro keys, profiles, and some multimedia keys. However, the driver for the keyboard is only for windows, and it's on a CD (I found drivers on the internet, but they're the same and also for Windows). I tried installing the configuration tool with WINE but using it doesn't seem to affect any of the settings for my keyboard.\nSo the biggest problem is that changing any settings on the configuration tool and then saving doesn't seem to do anything. Another annoying problem is that pressing any lock key doesn't affect the LED, but does affect the lock on the system. (So pressing CAPS lock makes everything caps like normal, but the LED for CapsLock doesn't change. Same for NumLock, and ScrollLock. The NumLock LED gets turned on on startup but won't change after.) However, the normal keys that are on any keyboard such as letters, numbers and symbols work fine.\nI have tried using the additional software tool but even with the CD inserted the driver won't show up. I can view the CD and open the manual, and install the driver with WINE. But installing it with WINE only installs the config tool which doesn't even work. I have also seen many questions for installing windows drivers but none of them seemed to apply to my case, as they either were fixed using additional software tool or ndiswrapper, which is apparently only for wireless card drivers.\nHow do I install the config tool(and the driver, if necessary) in a way that it actually changes the settings on the keyboard? It doesn't really have to be done with WINE but I'd rather use the most hassle-free way.\nIf it makes a difference, I am using Zorin, and the keyboard in question is the Sharkoon Skiller Pro.\n\nA: You cannot install Windows drivers using Wine. You basically have 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Call the manufacturer of your keyboard and ask then for a Linux module. They will say they don't support it.\nTell them you're willing to help them install a Linux system and that every single Linux system comes with full development tools like a compiler, a DDK, and that it will cost them only an old PC lying in the basement and some time.\nPoint out to them that there are people like you who do buy brand new hardware and do gaming and other advanced stuff.\nPoint out that if they have Linux drivers, they will sell more hardware as Linux customers are loyal to their manufacturers.\nThat they do not have to pay anyone to use the  Linux compatible logo!\n\n*Ask for your money back.\n\n*Get involved yourself: You have the hardware!

Having assembled a new box with an Asus Maximus V11 Hero, an i7-4770K, and Sapphire R9 280X. I have loaded Ubuntu 14.10  64bit from an LXF CD and updated from the net. I have a problem trying to load the MB drivers. From the MB CD I get \"Please update to the latest Linux Kernel for motherboard chip set and components support\" I do not want to Load Windows XP on to a separate partition. Info on how to proceed will be greatly appreciated. Many thanks, Robert.\n\nA: In Ubuntu you don't need to install 'separate' drivers from manufacturer CDs. Most drivers are already built in the system. Those discs you are mentioning probably designed for Windows and provide some necessary or additional features for the motherboard to work under Windows. But in Ubuntu these features are usually provided by default. So may not bother installing any special drivers.\n\nA: Your manufacturers CD typically won't have drivers for Linux (Ubuntu or any other distribution for that matter) Don't worry about that. As Rinzwind points out the kernel supplies support for the main-board components (in most cases). I've never needed specific drivers for any main-board I've purchased whether it by Asus or Gigabyte or ??????\nYou can update your installation to the latest kernel either with Software Updater in the GUI or via the command line (my personal favorite) by opening a terminal and issuing the commands: \nsudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade\n", "Q: How do I get my Roccat Lua mouse fully working on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit?

Should I grant read+write access to the directory /var/lib/roccat/ to my username?

I can change it with the software, but now with the mouse. \n\nA: The most important thing first: Don't ever run the tools as root! Linux is not Windows, even if it's Ubuntu.\nOther things you need to know:\nAfter adding yourself to group roccat you need to at least relogin for the new membership to get applied.\nThe device needs a replug, so that udev can apply the newly installed rules.\nNow do this:\nDelete the files that have been created with the wrong rights:\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/roccat\n\nRebuild the folder with\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/roccat\nsudo chown root:roccat /var/lib/roccat\nsudo chmod 2770 /var/lib/roccat\n\nThen it should work.\n", "Q: installing matlab 2014 on ubuntu 14.04LTS I am facing problem while installing matlab 2014b on Ubuntu 14.04.

I have a pretty fresh install, less than a week old. Fully up to date.\nAt first I was just having this issue with Ubuntu Touch on my Nexus 4, I would connect it to the computer via USB and start a file transfer or just leave it charging (doesn't matter whether or not I interact with it on the computer) and then it would disconnect on its own for some reason and then Ubuntu would try to re-mount it automatically and come up with an error pop-up saying it was unable to mount and a nautilus window would pop open trying to show the phone's internal storage. I guess Ubuntu is locked out or something but then it keeps trying to mount and keeps opening Nautilus windows and gets stuck in a loop unless I disconnect the USB.\nI have been using the Ubuntu phone for a couple of months now and noticed this every once in a while. I thought it was the phone and that the problem had progressed as now it happens most times the phone is plugged into the laptop. I have also reformatted the laptop since first experiencing this issue and still experience it on a fresh Ubuntu 14.10 install.\nI figured the problem was related to Ubuntu touch until my friend plugged in his Nexus 5 to charge last night and it started doing the same thing. It was fine for a bit and we didn't pay attention to it, then an hour or two later there there are dozens of nautilus windows open along with dozens of unable to mount pop ups.\nI am not sure how to recreate the issue. It seems to happen randomly.

How do I do that? Advisable yes/no and why?\nI tried Ubuntu a great many years ago and would like to do so again but am not a techie.\nAny help you can give, or point me to a good source as to how to do this, would be appreciated.\n\nA: Advisable: yes.  The sunset date for Vista is on 11 April 2017 so you'd better start now. I did the same thing a year ago and deleted Vista about 6 months ago.\nSome advice on strategy: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install all the open source software you can find that can replace your current software on the Vista machine and make them the default! (One per week, so you get the hang of them)\n\n\n*\n\n*VLC for video playing\n\n*LibreOffice for Office automation\n\n*FileZilla for FTP stuff\n\n*Firefox as a web browser\n\n*Evolution / Thunderbird for mail\n\n*qBittorrent \n\n*GIMP\n\n*gedit\n\n\n*Download the end-user manual. \n\n*Backup your entire system using the CloneZilla Live CD (use disk-to-image) before you start on an external HDD!\n\n*Delete/off-load unimportant files on the same external HDD.\n\n*Shrink the Windows partition using gparted from the Ubuntu Live CD so there is at least 24GB for the Ubuntu partition available\n\n*Create 3 partitions for Ubuntu: swap (look here how to calculate your RAM size) / (24GB at least) and then move your /home directory on the same \"drive\" as you currently store the windows \"users\" directory (probably c:\\users)\n\n\nHow to install Ubuntu: click here\n", "Q: Is there an existing web gui for locate? I am searching for a lightweight solution for helping users finding files on my server.\nRunning on commandline I can just use locate, if necessary piped with a grep command. However the users do not have access to the prompt and do not have the knowledge to use more complicated piped commands.\nI have been experimenting with some search engines like solr and opensearch, however these are quite demanding on recourses for full hd's with lots of data, while most of the times a simple name search will suffice.\nDoes anyone know a web gui which can just make use of the existing locatedb?\nOr an other approach, like a lightweight searchengine, with low setup effort and limited resource demands which uses a central search db and provide a gui to different platforms? \n\nA: Update, January 22,2018:\nI have stumbled upon mlocate-web on GitHub, which fits OP's requirements quite well, although lacks ability to open files. Can be ran manually or as daemon. According to the README.md, the package was developed on Ubuntu 16.04, so it's quite recent as of right now. \nMini-update, Feb 2\nAdded double quotes to gnome-open \"$TOPEN\", so that gnome-open gets full pathname of files that have space.\nUpdate # 2,Jan 30 : \nAs requested in the comments , I've refined the script, and added the option to open files. Everything is implemented with zenity, locate, and gnome-open. Praise the Unix philosophy of piping commands into others !\nI've annotated the script , so it should be clear where, what, and how.\nIn  the screenshots I'm opening the Hello World  program for java. \nThe script exits at any point if user clicks Cancel/Quit buttons. \nSide note: The OP requested that the app should be cross-platform. As far as I know, zenity,gnome-open, and locate are not dependent on presence of GNOME shell. Besides, users will be connecting to his Ubuntu server, and all those apps work on Ubuntu regardless of GNOME shell's presence. In other words, they're going to be executing the script on his system, not theirs, to locate the files.\nThe refined script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Author: Serg\n# Description: GUI using zenity for locate utility\n# Date: January 30, 2015\n\n# This flag will make popup appear if nothing was found\nFOUND=0\n\n# Ask user for input, and store it in USRFILE variable\nUSRFILE=`zenity --entry --title=\"SEARCH\"  --entry-text=\"Text here\" --text=\"Enter a filename or part of it\"`\n\n# if use clicked OK, proceed to this big if statement\nif [ $(echo $?) = 0 ]\n    then\n    TOPEN=$( ( locate $USRFILE ) | ( zenity --height 450 --width=450\\\n     --list --column \"Please wait, I'll display paths to files, if I find any\"\\\n     --title \"SEARCH RESULTS\" --text \"Select a file you want to open\"\\\n    --height=450 --width=450 --ok-label=\"Open a file \" --cancel-label=\"Quit\" )  )\n    # FIXME: if user clicks open a file without selecting one, program will crash\n    # FIXME: selecting a file and hitting enter, brings up \"Nothing found\" dialog\n\n    # If user clicked \"Open a file\" , gnome-open \n    # will open it with whatever default\n    # program is listed for that file-type\n    if [ $(echo $?) = 0 ]\n        then\n        gnome-open \"$TOPEN\"\n    fi\n\n\n    # Set flag to true, do not display \"Nothing found\"\n    if [ $(echo $?) = 0 ] \n\n        then FOUND=1\n\n    fi\n\n    # If we didn't  find anything, display a message\n    if [ $FOUND != 1  ]\n        then zenity --info --text=\"Nothing found\"\n    fi\n\nfi\n\nScreenshots of the refinements\nGet user input\n\nDisplay search results if any, might take a moment to load\n\nOpen the selected file\n\nFor a suggestion on how to make this script open with a short-cut (double-click), refer to my previous update below\nUpdate #1,Jan 29 : Disregard my previous post. I've though about the way you worded the problem : \"a gui front end to locate\". In fact there exists a gui front end to scripts , zenity, and I've used it to make a rough draft of a script that might be useful. Feel free to alter it and add functionality, but at the most basic level  it's locate with gui.\nAs for making a script \"double-clickable\" refer here\nThe script\n#!/bin/bash\n\nFOUND=0\n\n\nUSRFILE=`zenity --entry  --entry-text=\"Text here\" --text=\"Enter a filename or part of it\"`\nzenity --info --text \" Please wait a little, I'll try to find it \"\nlocate $USRFILE > results.txt && zenity --text-info --html --filename='results.txt' \nif [ -e results.txt ] \n        then FOUND=1\n        rm results.txt\nfi\n\nif [ $FOUND != 1  ]\n         then zenity --info --text=\"Nothing found\"\nfi\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\n\n\nOld post\nThere is gnome-search-tool, which I've checked with ps and htop utilities and it doesn't take too many resources. You can install it with sudo apt-get install  gnome-search-tool.\n\n\nA: I have made my research about this , found out this versatile file searching tool called Catfish. Sounds promising, completely written in python and helpful to find and locate files. I also found a GUI\n\nA: I know this is pretty old but I just found myself asking the same question for some cold storage on a Raspberry Pi.  I came up with a super simple solution with CGI but beware - security isn't its strength.  Only use this for a personal system or private network because it's ripe for injection attacks.  The good news is it's fast and easy to deploy if you already have Apache/NGinx installed.\nsearch.html:\n<HTML>\n<TITLE>MLocate Web Form</TITLE>\n<BODY>\n<b>Simple Web Form</b><p>\n<FORM ACTION=\"/cgi-bin/search.cgi\" target=\"resultsframe\">\n<label for=\"search\">Find</label>\n<INPUT TYPE=\"TEXT\" NAME=\"search\" SIZE=\"50\"><BR>\n<label for=\"limit\">Limit</label>\n<INPUT TYPE=\"TEXT\" NAME=\"limit\" value=\"10\" SIZE=\"4\"><BR>\n<INPUT TYPE=\"SUBMIT\" NAME=\"Find\" VALUE=\"Find\">\n</FORM>\n<iframe name=\"resultsframe\" height=600 width=800></iframe>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\nNow you can just use CGI to dump the results from a bash script (/var/www/cgi-bin/search.cgi):\n#!/bin/bash\necho -e 'Content-type: text/html\\n\\n'\necho '<html><body><table>'\n\neval $(echo $QUERY_STRING | sed 's/\\&/\\n/g')\n\nwhile read -r l\ndo\n    l=${l:8}\n    echo \"<tr><td><a href='[YOUR_HTTP_BASE]$l'>$l</td></tr>\"\ndone <<< $(locate -l \"$limit\" -i \"$search\")\n\necho \"</table></html>\"\n\nResults are posted as links so filter and map your results to apache-permitted paths you want. If you have unicode or html-iffy characters, best to escape them.  Also note that you can potentially inject nastiness into your search here so use at your own risk or sterilize the input.\n \n\nA: I using zenity.

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: VirtualBox performance is terrible when you assign it more cores than are cores in a single CPU socket. \nThe most likely problem is that the guest OS see it as multiples cores in the same CPU (the guest sees a SMP system but the hardware is really NUMA) and creates lots of inter-CPU traffic.\nYour setup should work well with 20 cores or less.\nSource.\n", "Q: Hard Disk non-existent in Ubuntu 14.04 Had 2 harddisk listed under my ubuntu, one has the system and another Hitachi was just added under / as just additional drive, it was running fine for a month, under NTFS file system, i cannot see the drive in Gparted and checked physically the cables they are all tight and fitted .... noticed the temp as around 50 most of the time, not sure what happened now, has it died, or is there a way i can check ?\n\nA: Yes, checking is easy.

Basically the H.264 plugin is not installed.\n\nA: This command in a terminal should do:\nsudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n(As already explained by David Foerster, but this should be an answer, not a comment.)\n\nA: VideoLAN VLC is a free video player for Windows and Ubuntu that supports many formats, including MP3s, DVDs, and MP4s.\nI'd give that a try and see if it helps you.\nOtherwise, you will have to install codecs, as the other answers describe.\n\nA: I believe your solution lies in manually installing \"restricted formats\".  Ironically this, or something that sounds like it can be found in the software center, but trial and error has taught me that despite the claims it is not the same.  You must add this in the terminal exactly as it is describe on THIS LINKED PAGE.\nAs my other answers and comments attest, I am not a big fan of the Terminal/CLI.  I accept there are times it is necessary.  This is such an occasion.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats\nAlternatively you can visit the Apps page of restricted extras in stock Ubuntu (ubuntu-restricted-extras ) and click on the big orange graphic reading \"available on the Software Center\".\nEDIT BY ORIGINAL AUTHOR:\nThe inserted edit directly above is faulty!  Its fallacy is reference within my post, proving he failed to read my post before editing it!\n", "Q: How do I disable laptop optical drive eject button and assign eject to a keyboard shortcut? Note: Answer now updated to function under 19.04\nI'm on 14.04 and accidentally open my cd/dvd/bluray drive about 20 times a day. I've looked at a few questions here which provided no working solution. \nBoth this question and this question appear to be outdated -- the offered solution doesn't work.\nWhen I do, eject -i on I'm met with eject: unable to find or open device for: 'cdrom'\nWhen I do, eject -i on /dev/sr0 I get a more favorable response: CD-Drive may NOT be ejected with device button however the button is unfortunately still enabled.\nThe information from /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info suggests that locking is possible:\nCD-ROM information, Id: cdrom.c 3.20 2003/12/17\n\ndrive name:             sr0\ndrive speed:            24\ndrive # of slots:       1\nCan close tray:         1\nCan open tray:          1\nCan lock tray:          1\nCan change speed:       1\nCan select disk:        0\nCan read multisession:  1\nCan read MCN:           1\nReports media changed:  1\nCan play audio:         1\nCan write CD-R:         1\nCan write CD-RW:        1\n\nThis answer has a working solution which fixes a UDEV rule to enable locking the drive. I've added some practical info to the solution, allowing one to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the optical drive hardware eject button at startup\n\n*Add a keyboard shortcut to eject the optical drive\n\n*Ensure the drive stays locked after waking from suspend\n\n\nA: Enable Locking the Drive\n(note: if eject -i on already works, you may skip ahead to \"Lock the Drive on Startup\")\nFirst, copy /lib/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/ like so:\ncp /lib/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/\n\nNext, edit /etc/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules and comment out the problematic line:\nsudoedit /etc/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules\n\nLocate this line:\nENV{DISK_EJECT_REQUEST}==\"?*\", RUN+=\"cdrom_id --eject-media $devnode\", GOTO=\"cdrom_end\"\n\nNow add a # (this \"comments out\" the line, effectively nullifying it without deleting) in front to make it look like this:\n# ENV{DISK_EJECT_REQUEST}==\"?*\", RUN+=\"cdrom_id --eject-media $devnode\", GOTO=\"cdrom_end\"\n\nNow save and close by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y to confirm, followed by Enter to accept the current file name. Don't worry that it appears as a strange temporary file name, that's just how sudoedit works.\nNow you should be able to disable the optical drive hardware button (essentially we're locking the drive) with this:\neject -i on /dev/sr0 or eject -i 1 /dev/sr0 They do the same.\n\nLock the Drive on Startup\nTo make this more useful, I wanted this command to take effect upon startup. I used the GUI Startup Applications program (preinstalled in Ubuntu, find it with Dash) to accomplish this.\nOpen the program and then click the Add button, a new dialogue box opens.\nType a name (I went with the descriptive \"Lock optical drive\") and within the Command: field enter bash -c 'eject -i on /dev/sr0'\nClick Add to complete and then close the program.\n\nAdd a Keyboard Shortcut\nNow the optical drive is locked upon startup. But how will I open the drive when I need to use it?! To make it simple, I put the commands into an \"eject\" keyboard shortcut which unlocks the drive, ejects the drive, then relocks the drive. This way I can still easily access the drive but the hardware button is never a problem.\nHere's how to accomplish this keyboard shortcut:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Keyboard program found within the Dash.\n\n\n*Click the Shortcuts tab\n\n\n*Click on Custom Shortcuts at the bottom of the list\n\n\n*Click on the + sign, a new dialogue box will open\n\n\n*Name the shortcut (I used \"Unlock, Eject, Relock CD\")\n\n\n*Enter this into the Command: field:\nbash -c 'eject -i off /dev/sr0 && eject /dev/sr0 && eject -i on /dev/sr0'\n\n\n\n*Click Apply\n\n\n*Click to the right of your shortcut's name where it says Disabled. Once you click it, Disabled changes to New Accelerator:\nPress the key combination you want to use. I used Ctrl+Alt+E\nYou can then test the shortcut immediately. If all is well close and you're done!\n\nLock Drive Upon Wake From Suspend (pre-systemd method)\nI've noticed my drive becomes unlocked again upon resuming from suspend so I created a script to ensure the drive stays locked in this case.\nCreate the script file:\nsudoedit /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/99lock-optical\n\nPaste the following into the new file:\n#!/bin/sh\n# lock the optical drive upon resume from suspend\n        \ncase \"${1}\" in\n    resume|thaw)\n        eject -i 1 /dev/sr0    \n;;\nesac\n\nLock Drive Upon Wake From Suspend (systemd method)\nI'm using 19.04 now and noticed my drive was becoming unlocked upon resuming from suspend. This method works to make it stay locked:\nCreate the script file:\nsudoedit /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/00start_my_connection\n\nPaste the following into the new file:\n#!/bin/sh\nif [ $1 = post ]\n  then eject -i 1 /dev/sr0\nfi\n\nSave and close the file, make it executable and you're all set!\n\nA: For me information here helps:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eject/+bug/885051/comments/6\nI edited file in /lib/ directory, not in /etc/\nNow in my Ubuntu 14.04 command works:\neject -i 1 /dev/sr0\n\nA: Try this to make the button not eject:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open: System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Sound and Media\n\n*Select \"Eject\" and clear the shortcut (by pressing \"Backspace\").\nYou can use the shortcut settings to make it do something more useful instead, like open a commonly used application, lock your screen or reset your wifi.\n\nSource:\nI have a MacBook Pro running 14.04 and the eject button is right on top of Delete/Backspace, which makes it easily pressed accidentally (it's worse for MacBooks without disc drives where that button is for Power instead). Used the shortcut settings to make the eject button lock my laptop instead. Have used this solution since 12.04 and everything in between.\n\nA: If all else fails:\nTake a pin (not a needle as you'll hurt yourself), push it firmly behind the button on the DVD drive and use it as a lever to yank out the button.  Then take a small piece of plastic 1mm wider and larger then the resulting hole, put some super glue on it and glue it on the hole taking care not put it over the tiny hole next to it.\nFrom now on, use the following 2 methods to open the DVD drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Ubuntu \"Eject\" through the dash\n\n*Keep that life-hack pin around your PC from now on and push it into the tiny hole next to your piece of plastic to eject the DVD when your laptop is turned off. (Use a piece of adhesive tape to fasten the life-hack pin to the underside of your laptop)\n\n\nA: On this site I found this suggestion if eject -i 1 doesn't work:\nsudo echo 1 > /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/lock to lock (0 instead of 1 to unlock)\nThere are some other options dicussed as well.\nHere is a short c source code performing another option: link (notice the bugfix for newer versions in the upper comments!)  \nBut I read in some other forums that all these eject-commands only change the drive's locking status when a disk is inserted and mounted. The only solution seems to be a tool called cdctl, but it is not very compatible with many systems, as I studied the comments.\n", "Q: Brother HL-2270DW Printer uninstalling after software update I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and have a Brother HL-2270DW printer that I am trying to connect to my computer via USB.

Someday I hope to take advantage of these features to help new users to avoid these issues such as those you are having.\nCertain printer manufacturers are much more supportive of linux, or of PC users in general.  Brother has an unfortunate history of drivers which uninstall even in Windows, and printers which seem to break themselves requiring frequent maintenance.\nIn recent years Canon, a once great printer manufacturer has taken to refusing to so much as provide drivers for Linux.\nMeanwhile HP, Epson and even Brother at least provide Linux drivers, perfect or not.  I would really like to see a \"recommended printers/brands list\" on this site, perhaps with votes from other site members to assist people such as yourself to make wise decisions when buying.\nAt present I have an Epson wifi/ethernet network inkjet printer with fax ability and sheet feeder which cost only $80 new, model WF-2540.

You made an \"ISO\" with dd of an existing installation from a harddrive to use it with UNetbootin for setting up Ubuntu on an external drive?\nThat's one step too much and a very crude workaround: xkcd.com/763/\nUNebootin is intended to be used with ISO images for optical media. If you dd something from your harddrive that's an image too, but not for optical media, and not what UNetbootin expects.\nTo install Ubuntu on external media like USB pendrives or external HDDs/SSDs, just choose this device during installation as a traget device (including the bootloader location) and the installer will set up everything for you.\nAlternatively you can use dd to copy an existing installation to another device and install the bootloader on the device, but I would rather recommend copying of the files in the filesystem (use cp -a or rsync -a) instead of copying the entire filesystem and changing the UUIDs. This way you don't accidentally end up with the same UUID on multiple devices, which may get you into trouble. Also writing to certain types of storage with dd is harmful.\nRelated questions\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?) – General answer mostly for setting up MBR-booting (old way for BIOS machines).\n\n*Is it still possible to install Ubuntu to an external harddrive with UEFI? – Instructions for setting up UEFI-booting or MBR-booting on GPT and MBR partition tables. (And also for Macs.)\n\n\n\nTo extend on why UNetbootin is not to be used with harddisk dump images: Live ISO images usually contain an image inside of the image which contains the Live environment and a special (non-standard) configuration to boot up this image from optical read only media. UNetbootin is a workaround to use these ISO images with USB storage devices. Actually you are using a workaround (UNetbootin) of a workaround (bootable system on optical read only media) and you where just trying to add another workaround on top (create an \"ISO\" to use it with UNetbootin).\n", "Q: How to automatically reboot after running a command I'm installing updates on a bunch of machines, and I simply want to run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo reboot\n\nall at once on all machines (after hours of course) and let them run without requiring my input for passwords. However, the above commands don't work, because they all require root permission, and thus require my password each time. Running them all under a single sudo concatentated by && doesn't seem to work. Also, if an update has release notes, it'll display any release notes and halt until I exit less.\nHow do I accomplish this?\n\nA: sudo -s will prompt you for your password once, then leave you sitting in a root shell that remains until you exit.  There you can chain commands like apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && reboot.\n\nA: So you don't want your user to have to type in a password to use sudo? You could add a line like this into /etc/sudoers or a file in /etc/sudoers.d/\n\nusername  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nOr to just allow a few programs like reboot and apt-get:\nusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot, /usr/bin/apt-get\n\n\nMight want to look into some apt-get options too like:\n\n   -q, --quiet\n       Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress\n       indicators. More q's will produce more quiet up to a maximum of 2.\n       You can also use -q=# to set the quiet level, overriding the\n       configuration file. Note that quiet level 2 implies -y; you should\n       never use -qq without a no-action modifier such as -d, --print-uris\n       or -s as APT may decide to do something you did not expect.\n       Configuration Item: quiet.\n\n   -y, --yes, --assume-yes\n       Automatic yes to prompts; assume \"yes\" as answer to all prompts and\n       run non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as\n       changing a held package, trying to install a unauthenticated\n       package or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get will\n       abort. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes.\n\n   --force-yes\n       Force yes; this is a dangerous option that will cause apt to\n       continue without prompting if it is doing something potentially\n       harmful. It should not be used except in very special situations.\n       Using force-yes can potentially destroy your system! Configuration\n       Item: APT::Get::force-yes.\n\n\nOr you could blindly pipe a few newlines or \"q\"'s into apt-get, I used to install one package that would ignore apt options like -y and wait for a keypress (probably in it's preinst or postinst script). Could try something like:\n\n{\nsleep 20\necho\necho \"q\"\n} | apt-get upgrade\n\n\n\nAnd if you're installing the exact same packages in every machine, you don't need to update and upgrade each one over the internet, you can download all the required .deb files once with:\n\nsudo apt-get install --download-only [packages]\n\nor\nsudo apt-get upgrade --download-only\n\n\nthen install them all from a local / shared folder with\n\nsudo dpkg -iR /folder_of_debs\n\n\n\nA: The really simplest solution if you're 'root' is\napt-get -y update && apt-get -y upgrade && reboot\n\nAnd if you're a user on the system, firstly make sure the user is enabled in the sudoers then type:\nsudo apt-get -y update && apt-get -y upgrade && reboot\n\n", "Q: Vodaphone Mobile on USB Can anyone tell me how to use Vodaphone USB Mobile on Ubuntu?

I know in shell(bash), arithmetic operation could be done inside ((..)),\ne.g.\ni=1\n((i++)) #i=1\n((i+=1)) #i=3\n\nMy question is:\nWhat exactly did ((..)) do? Does it create an anonymous variable?\n\nA: It allows the calculation of an mathmatical expression and the substitution of the result\n\nArithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression\n  and the substitution of the result. The format for arithmetic\n  expansion is:\n$((expression)) \nThe expression is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a\n  double quote inside the parentheses is not treated specially. All\n  tokens in the expression undergo parameter expansion, string\n  expansion, command substitution, and quote removal. Arithmetic\n  expansions may be nested.\nThe evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below under\n  ARITHMETIC EVALUATION. If expression is invalid, bash prints a message\n  indicating failure and no substitution occurs.Bash Manpage\n\n\nA: Arithmetic Expression Syntax -\n(( expression ))\n\nThe expression is evaluated according to the rules described under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION. If the value of the expression is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the return status is 1. This is exactly equivalent to let \"expression\".\nArithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result. The format for arithmetic expansion is:\n$(( expression ))\n\nThe expression is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a double quote inside the parentheses is not treated specially. All tokens in the expression undergo parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and quote removal. The result is treated as the arithmetic expression to be evaluated. Arithmetic expansions may be nested.\nEnclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, \\, and, when history expansion is enabled, !. The characters $ and ` retain their special meaning within double quotes. The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: $, \", \\, or . A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an ! appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the ! is not removed. \nReference\n\nA: The ((..)) simply tells the shell interpreter you will be doing arithmetic.  Normally in bash you would need backticks `...` to do arithmetic.  This is an alternative syntax that is more C like and allows things like i++ to increment the variable i by 1.  There is an answer on stackoverflow that explains it well.\n\nA: In bash (not in POSIX shell), ((expression)) allow you to do arithmetic evaluation. It is the same as:\nlet \"expression\"\n\nIt does not create any anonymous variables, it evaluated expression in current shell, affected all variables in current shell context. If the value of expression is non-zero, return status is 0, otherwise return status is 1.\nA note that ((...)) and let are features from ksh and only available in bash, zsh and ksh. You should using ((..)) over let because it more legible and easy to quote than using let.\nFor portability, using $((...)) construct.\n", "Q: Unable to mount Windows 8.1 partition in Ubuntu I have to install Windows 8.1 on a new laptop and it works O.K. I installed Ubuntu on the same lap and also works O.K.\nThere is only one problem: Ubuntu can't mount the windows partitions and an error appears for each one of them. Every time I turn on the lap, I have to press \"S\" to skip mounting those partitions. I tried with config-ntfs to mount / unmount those partition, but it didn't work.\nConfig-ntfs has disabled undo option.\nI have experience with windows, but it's the second time I install Ubuntu.\nWindows 7 and Ubuntu work perfect on this laptop !!\nHow can I fix the problem ? \n\nA: Try to boot into Windows, shut down or restart the laptop/PC normally. Don't force shut down (by pressing power button for 5 seconds). After a clean shut down/restart, the access to NTFS partitions in Ubuntu should be fine. No need to press s for skip mounting just like normal boot.\nOne more thing: don't hibernate the laptop/pc when you boot into windows. That is the cause of the problem.\n\nA: I solved the problem, it was very simple! Ubuntu has a program, named Disks, that can mount / dismount any partition type.\nUbuntu was RIGHT ! Windows 8.1 is an unsafe partition, it acts as an ADWARE. If you try to install a program and Microsoft AppStore has some version of it, you will receive an advice and the AppStore will be automatic installed in your taskbar. For example, Microsoft has a version of CodeBlocks, so...if you try to install the \"Code::Blocks, The open source, cross-platform IDE\" you will have some problems. If you still insist to install it, it doesn't work because the searchpath was changed by \"smarterrortxt\" program received in background, in a xml file. The problem can be solved, but if you try to install Spybot, a warning will be displayed (incompatibility problem; redirection to microsoft help) and it isn't easy to solve it. The new Spybot detects some file of windows 8.1 as adware, and is RIGHT !\n", "Q: Ubuntu Gnome 14.10 Upgrade to GNOME 3.14 Blank Screen, Can't Login Hi I upgraded my Ubuntu GNOME 14.10 fresh install to Gnome 3.14 by using the gnome team ppas.

I am an electronics engineer and I regularly view PDF schematics.  Often I encounter the scenario where I would like to search the schematic for a component, e.g. \"R1\"\nThe problem is that searching for \"R1\" matches all the R[tens] and R[hundreds] on the schematic as well. So I would like to be able to use a regex in my search, or at least have tighter control of the search (e.g. search whole word only).\nHas anyone here found a good PDF tool on Ubuntu which supports these features?\n\nA: Install pdfgrep :\nsudo apt-get install pdfgrep\n\nAnd then use -C option and word boundaries match:\npdfgrep -C 0 '\\<WORD\\>' file.pdf\n\nor use \\b...\\b instead of \\<...\\>.\nSee its man pdfgrep\n-C, --context NUM\n      Print at most NUM characters of context around each match.\n\n\nI have googled and found JPedal(30-days trial). Download and open it via command-line by the following command:\njava -jar jpedal-trial.jar\n\nNow press Ctrl+F, type the word that you want to search and check the \"Find Whole Words Only\" from Down-arrow icon () to search for whole word.\n\n\nA: If you are fine with creating an index of your documents you could use Recoll which is a full-on desktop search engine. For screenshots and installation instructions please take a look at this answer.\nRecoll searches are constructed using a poweful query language that supports wildcards and modifiers (e.g. proximity and slack).\nFor instance, the query \"R1\"l would only yield whole-word results. This is because the l modifier turns off stemming. (In this specific example you wouldn't even need the modifier because Recoll doesn't expand sequences of numbers by default).\n\nA: If the problem is just to limit the search to whole words, that is easy enough. Just add spaces before and after your search string, like so: \" R1 \".

If there was only one partition then it's worth a try of recreating a single, default linux (83) partition in fdisk & see if it contains data...\nIf not, then you need something like foremost, which is an undelete / file recovery tool that can scan your entire lost drive and copy files to a new drive - they will be un-named, and you will have loads of files, so this is going to keep you busy for some time.

For now - I'd recommend emptying the file rather then removing it (it can be still open for writing; removing such file will lead to some \"inconsistencies\" in the system - while file will be removed from the filesystem, the access will still be allocated for the process to write to it and space will not be really emptied/returned to the system/disk unless process is restarted freeing the space - ooph, I guess this sentence may look a bit complicated ;), but it's, in fact, fairly simple)\nTo empty the log run the following command:  >/var/log/apache2/deflate_log\njust be careful, not to erase something else by mistake.\nIn this way anyway you won't need to restart apache.\n", "Q: How do I fix amavis mysql warning \"execute failed: Unknown column 'rseqnum'\" If you are using amavisd-new with a SQL server (Docs are located in /usr/share/doc/amavisd-new) you will see error messages similar to this:  \n(!)WARN save_info_final: sql exec: err=1054, 42S22,                     \\\n  DBD::mysql::st execute failed: Unknown column 'rseqnum'               \\\n  in 'field list' at (eval 135)\n\n\nA: Starting with amavisd-new-2.7.0, three fields need to be added\nto table msgrcpt and one to table msgs:  \nALTER TABLE msgrcpt ADD rseqnum     integer  DEFAULT 0   NOT NULL;\nALTER TABLE msgrcpt ADD content     char(1)  DEFAULT ' ' NOT NULL;\nALTER TABLE msgrcpt ADD is_local    char(1)  DEFAULT ' ' NOT NULL;\nALTER TABLE msgs    ADD originating char(1)  DEFAULT ' ' NOT NULL; \n\nEnter the above SQL statements to update the database that amavisd-new uses; usually mail_amavis. e.g.:  mysql -u <auth-user> -p mail_amavisto do so. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS 64-bit GTK themes and Icon themese not working properly I have Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS 64-bit installed on two separate computers (Dell XPS L502X and Dell Latitude E5440). The themes I installed either by extracting compressed files or using the apt-get package manager worked flawlessly after a fresh install of the OS on Dell XPS L502X; however this is not the case on Dell Latitude E5440? What may be the reason behind it? \nIn order to copy the themes and icons from XPS to Latitude I used a memory stick and copied the contents of /usr/share/icons and /usr/share/themes directories from the computer which had the themes and icons installed(being XPS in this case). Later I plugged the flash drive into the Latitude and tried changing themes. In order to be able to set the themes easily I installed Ubuntu Tweak from a PPA and I noticed that when I first launched Ubuntu Tweak it failed to show the themes apart from the cursor ones. The GTK themes were not shown for example, I thought this might have something to do with file permissions or something so I decided to find which themes can be installed from the repository and installed them accordingly. After this step GTK and icon themes showed up in the Ubuntu Tweak Tool, but when changed into a theme which was not supplied with Vanilla Ubuntu I noticed that there were inconsistencies in color etc. and the theme just did not display properly and for the icon theme not all icons were changes as was the case with XPS. I think I made a blunder here but could not figure out how to remedy it? Any assistance suggestion would be nice.  \nP.S : The cursor themes work fine no problems with them.\n\nA: I think my mistake was to move the themes installed via PPA directly over to the other computer, thinking that it will work since all themes are constrained to the directories /usr/share/icons/ and /usr/share/themes as far as I understood from this experience it is not the case.

In some instances you are going to have to install a program in the google market place to download a tethering app. In other cases, tethering is already included in the phone. If I go to settings, more networks, and go to tethering and mobile hotspot it will give the option for me to tether my phone using usb, or wifi. This is also going to depend on your service provider because some service providers lock down tethering unless you have a plan aka MetroPCS. In some cases, like one of my older phones you can get around this using one of the tethering apps, but in other cases the phone is really locked down and the only options are to either pay or to root your phone using something like multirom. \n", "Q: I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 and I cannot see any wifi connections I have installed 14.04 recently.

I see ClamAV telling me the names of all the viruses that it has detected on my computer, but it seems to give me very little documentation on what those detections actually mean, and what the viruses actually are. It doesn't even tell me the structure of the detection name so I can't even judge for myself what each part could mean. This is the only documentation that I could find: https://github.com/vrtadmin/clamav-devel/raw/master/docs/signatures.pdf And this does not even give me the detection definitions for half of them. Is there any more documentation that explains what the virus detection definitions mean, and how they are structured with the dots and everything? And if there is no more documentation currently then is there any planned? How do people write the definitions if there is no more documentation out there? There must be but it is just not publicly available. But this is bad because why bother with taking the time to make fancy detection names if no one other than them know what they mean?\nMore detailed documentation is greatly needed, for it can detect a virus, and give the the name of the detection, but you have no idea anything about that detection and you can't even look it up to know if it wanted to reformat your hard drive or if it was spying on your every move.\n\nA: Use the command:\nsigtool --find-sigs <virus name> | awk ‘{ print $2 }’ | sigtool --decode-sigs\n\nThis will find the signature pull the signature part from the output and the turn it into “plain language”. The exception are hashes which just indicate the whole is known bad.\nThen you can look for that plain language in the files in question and determine if it’s accurate or a false positive.\n\nUpdate:\nThe use of sigtool in this fashion (--find-sigs and --decode-sigs) is not covered explicitly in the signature creation documentation (signatures.pdf). The documentation covers everything else needed to create your own signatures, including the accepted naming conventions and a description of what they imply (section 3.10 Signature names ... ClamAV uses the following prefixes for signature names ...)\nBeyond that, it is an exercise for the end-user to determine if something detected is actually malicious or if it's a false positive, and the way to do that is to understand what the signature is looking for and where it is in the impacted file. As I mentioned, the only thing that doesn't work with is hashes. The best you can do for those is look up the hash in various online scanners and get a sense for what other engines are detecting them as and looking up the virus names as well.\nIf these two things (the existing documentation and the use of sigtool), do not answer the question then the question needs to be rephrased so it is clearer as to the intent of the question. The 'why' someone thought something is malicious should be clear from the decoded virus signature. If it's not, or if you disagree with the detection, it should be reported as a false positive so the signature can be improved / clarified / etc.\nLooking at Win.Exploit.Unicode_Mixed-1 as an example, I would say that it's not a great sig for exactly this reason (it's not immediately clear what about that sequence is malicious).\nIt's unclear (to me) what about that sequence is malicious though it's probably something that is common to mixed unicode script exploitation (but again, that's a guess). From the name of the virus, the expectation would be that you would find it on Windows systems or on something that Windows systems can access and there's likely an exploit related to mixing unicode characters and non-unicode characters that matches that signature. With that information you can simply do a quick Google search for \"Windows mixed unicode exploit\" which will bring up 133,000+ results of sites talking about building exploits to take advantage of Unicode processing issues in Windows.\nIf you're seeing that in tcpdump output on your IDS, then it's likely a case of either one of your systems pulling that data from an exploited remote system (like a web server).\nThe OP was asking if there are \"plans to regulate the signature names so that they are more regular and people actually know what they mean\"...and that IS in the signature writing documentation. Or, at least, the guidelines are presented there which the ClamAV folks try to follow and recommend to others. If you are pulling from other third-party sources, they probably have their own naming conventions. \nThe OP is correct that the list of names in the documentation is woefully incomplete even for the signatures that ClamAV writes. But seeing as ClamAV is open-source and pretty much anyone can write signatures for it without approval from the ClamAV authors, there is zero chance of \"regulation\" of signature names.\nThe best you can do is break down the name, look at the signature definition, and Google. And sigtool will, at the very least, tell you what ClamAV is seeing as malicious even if it doesn't tell you why the signature author thought it was malicious to begin with.\n", "Q: Ubuntu.Components for 14.04 I read somewhere that to develop apps using Ubuntu.Components, 14.10 is needed.

I am especially suspicious about this since the usually reliable Intel doesn't perform well either.\nI don't see much about your interfaces that is troubling, however, I'd be certain the selected IP address is outside the DHCP range used in the router and you might simplify it a bit: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9752880/\nAlso, what are your instability symptoms?\nWith more information, I will edit this answer and propose a solution.\n", "Q: Can't make a Windows 7 Bootable USB I'm trying to use Startup Disk Creator to burn a Windows 7 iso file to a USB, but it doesn't appear to do anything when I try to select a file.\nHere's a video of what I'm trying to say since I suck at explaining things.\n\nA: Startup Disk Creator will only work with Ubuntu and other Linux distros.\nYou need to install WinUSB if you want to make bootable USBs containing Windows through Ubuntu.\n\nTo install WinUSB, open a Terminal and enter the following commands -\nwget https://launchpad.net/~colingille/+archive/freshlight/+files/winusb_1.0.11+saucy1_amd64.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i winusb_1.0.11+saucy1*\n\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n\n", "Q: Unity Ctrl + Alt + Del set default value to 'Lock' When I press Ctrl + Alt + Del I get a dialog with two buttons: Log-out and Lock.\nI spent a significant portion of my time working on Windows workstations, and the default there is Lock.

This will erase all the content from the disk and prepare it to write new data. It's possible that you have closed the DVD and this is why you don't have permissions to write in it.\nAlso, it can be because you account isn't running Brasero with enough permissions, for this you can try to open Brasero from a terminal with sudo brasero.\nIf you add more information, maybe we can give you a better answer.

I got to the Ubuntu screen then black screen and nothing. unplug tv plug in monitor (15 pin connector) and there was the desktop prompting for my password\nI entered it and it works ok. \nIf there is a fix i think I'm lucky and greatful. If no fix, and i can help making the OS better by giving you more hardware info. i'd be glad to.\nThanks again\nBob\n\nA: I\"ll dig up a monitor and let you know. I spent a lot of time with the 14.04 version and what was happening there the downloads making changes to passwords and user names and adding information that I thought was only on my laptop so by the time i finely got the updates to work with my password on ver 14.10 only to see nada  i was about to give up. \nThought it might be the tv (works with windows). Hop there's a fix if it is.\nI'll get back about the monitor\nThanks for the response\nBob\n\nA: This might be due to a kernel update, but the kernel doesn't work with your machine. Please see this, although it relates to a GPU driver issue, the answer might assist with your problem: Ubuntu Screen goes black after boot using Dedicated GPU\n", "Q: Python Installation in Downloads Directory -- Better Location? I installed Python following the directions in the accepted answer to \"How do I install python 2.7.2 on Ubuntu?\". Doing this involved \"wget\"ing a Python-2.7.9.tgz file in my ~/Downloads/ directory, unzipping it, navigating to the extracted directory, and running the configure and make commands.\nI'm now left with a Python-2.7.9 folder in my ~/Downloads/ directory. If I execute the command\nwhereis python\n\nI get the result\npython: /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python2.7 /etc/python /etc/python2.7 /usr/lib/python2.7 /usr/bin/X11/python /usr/bin/X11/python2.7 /usr/local/bin/python /usr/local/bin/python2.7 /usr/local/bin/python2.7-config /usr/local/lib/python2.7 /usr/include/python2.7 /usr/share/python /usr/share/man/man1/python.1.gz\n\nwhich does not seem to include the ~/Downloads/Python-2.7.9 directory.\nDoes this mean that I can delete ~/Downloads/Python-2.7.9 without losing any functionality? If not, is there a better place to put that directory than in the Downloads folder?\n\nA: It's \"installed\" so the ~/Downloads/Python-2.7.9 directory is safe to delete.

Is there a way to get this to work?\n\nA: There are 3 possible cases:Case1. You can try this command in terminal: sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-synapticsor if it's installed already, reinstall it with sudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-input-synaptics .Case2. Maybe you just disabled your touchpad accidentally. Try to enable it with the key combination(every device is not the same but normally Function key(Fn) with F_.（You can find some signs on the f_ keys).Case3. Enable your touchpad with dconf-tools in case you can't find your touchpad hotkeys. Open the terminal and install dconf-tools with this command:sudo apt-get install dconf-tools and launch it. Navigate to this path:\norg > gnome > settings-daemon > peripherals > touchpad\n\nCheck on touchpad-enabled to enable it. No root permission is needed in this case.\n\nA: There is no driver for this. I got model and name by running lsusb in terminal, it gave me the output of 5543:0081, I then googled this and looked for linux support, there is no driver available for it as of yet. Although it may detect it, hence why the buttons work, it doesnt detect the cursor movements and cannot function properly.\nShame.\n", "Q: query about Hard drive for ubuntu 12.04 Im using a ddr 2 mother board, is SATA 3.0 GBPS will be compatible.\nI know this is out of ubuntu but please answer\n\nA: Ubuntu should run fine. If you are unsure, simply put the desktop installer disk on a usb key and boot from it. It'll let you know if it can't install itself to your computer.\n\nA: DDR2 RAM was released in 2003, and SATA Revision 2 (3.0Gbps speeds) was released in April 2004. There is a good chance it will be supported since they are technologies released around the same time, but it depends on your motherboard specifically. If you can find the model of your motherboard or computer, you can do a quick google search to find its specifications and whether it supports SATA Revision 2 (3.0Gbps). Also, if it doesn't support that speed your hard disk will still work as the SATA hard disks are backward compatible. It just won't be as fast.\n", "Q: Run Android Apps on Ubuntu How can you run android apps on ubuntu?\nI have seen that there is some way to run ubuntu on the phone, but I want it the other way.\n\nA: look for some android emulators\n\nA: *\n\n*Hang with QEMU emulation provided by Android SDK, this is the most original and most naive way to do Android emulation ob Linux.\n\n*Play with Genymotion, but you would need VirtualBox.\n", "Q: Better spell Checker (german language) Most spell checkers are very simple.

Distorting everything in non-mirrored multi-display set-up. I recently returned to ubuntu (14.10) and I'm currently trying to get my multiple monitor setup to work properly.\nIt worked fine after the first setup in the desired configuration: \nA 1600x900 built-in monitor (Thinkpad T430) besides a 1920x1200 external Monitor (Asus VK226H) which is connected by DVI or VGA or mDP.\nHowever, after the first reboot it greeted me with 'the selected configuration for displays could not be applied' and showed me a partially overlapping and highly distorted background with weird placement of the launcher and a non-functional mouse interaction (does not click where it's shown). Switching to mirrored mode made everything functional again. \nHaving a look at the X Server Configuration I've noticed that only the external monitor is being represented in the layout graphic and 'Selection' drop down menu while displays shows them both. The 'the selected configuration for displays could not be applied' started to pop up almost anytime I apply something to displays or X Server, apply something to displays, reboot or reconnect the external monitor (no matter which port).\nsince this is a new Account I'm not allowed to embed any pictures. Here are 2 screenshots with driver rev 331 showing both displays and the X Server config before and after i managed to get everything visible/not overlapping after a reboot.\nWhile it was heavily distorted along the vertical dimension (and parts of the desktop off-screen) on the physical screens this is not reflected in the screenshot\nFailing horribly with lots of X Server settings, I decided to try the legacy drivers. I've purged the current drivers via this method and installed the 304 version though Software & Updates. The same thing happened. It worked after the initial setup and installation but failed again after a reboot. The built-in monitor still did not show up in X Server.\nSince this didn't achieve anything I've reverted back to 331 and tried it once more with the same result.

This script basically uses xrandr to do all the configurations. So you need to have xrandr and perl installed for this to work. But I think it might actually work out of the box (if I understand your problem correctly). Maybe you have to play around with xrandr a bit.\nMy setup is such that I have different things on my two screens and they're supposed to be next to each other. If I remember correctly. I don't really see where in the script that happens, but somehow fixing the resolutions of the screens did the trick for me.

This library lives in /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion.\nEssentially, this library declares a few clever functions that know about typical commands and how to complete them. Whenever you press Tab, functions within this library get called and attempt to complete your current command line. So for example if you type apt-get iTab it will complete that to apt-get install. If you don't source that library, you only have the standard, primitive bash completion - so for example if you type apt-get iTab without having sourced it, bash will simply look for files in the current directory starting with i and attempt to complete your command according to these filenames.\nWhy isn't it happening as root?\nBecause when you use sudo su to make yourself root, the bash completion library isn't sourced. This would be different if you used sudo -i to make yourself root. I bet you see the bug then, don't you? See for example 'sudo su -' vs 'sudo -i' vs 'sudo /bin/bash' - when does it matter which is used, or does it matter at all? if you aren't familiar with the differences.\nIn my case, as a normal user, the library gets sourced when I start a Bash shell because ~/.bashrc sources /etc/bash_completion which sources /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion.\nIf I use sudo -i to login as root, the library gets sourced because /etc/profile sources /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh which sources /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion.\nWhy is that bug happening?\nTry to execute this command:\n$ eval 'quoted=$(cat' env.\nbash: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `)'\nbash: syntax error: unexpected end of file\n\nLooks familiar? ;-) Indeed, that's exactly what happened behind the scenes when you hit Tab in the context you described. More precisely, the bug is in the function _quote_readline_by_ref declared by /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion. If you sourced that file you should have that function available. So next try this:\n$ _quote_readline_by_ref '$(cat env.' quoted\nbash: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `)'\nbash: syntax error: unexpected end of file\n\nGiven these arguments, the function _quote_readline_by_ref performs, among other things, that eval mentioned above. You can have a look if you like. And when you typed env $(cat env.Tab, behind the scenes that function got called with exactly those arguments. So that's what happened.\nThis eval hack was supposed to fix another issue, but I guess it introduced this other bug in the process.\nHow do I fix it?\nIt turns out that this bug has already been reported. After reading that bug report, I see three ways to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Patch it: In one of the comments in that bug report, someone suggests replacing the line\n[[ ${!2} == \\$* ]] && eval $2=${!2}\n\nwithin function _quote_readline_by_ref in the file /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion by the line\n[[ ${!2} == \\$\\'* ]] && eval $2=${!2}\n\nI recommend against doing this. The person who wrote that comment does not appear to be a developer of bash-completion. This hotfix will simply cause the left operand of the statement to evaluate to false and thus prevent that eval from happening. However without a good knowledge of what that function is supposed to do and in what contexts it is called, it is unclear whether this will not potentially break some other intended functionality.\n\n*Get the newest version: As also mentioned in that bug report, this bug is not present in git head (wherein among other changes the function _quote_readline_by_ref has been simplified). You can simply clone the current revision from Git:\ngit clone https://salsa.debian.org/debian/bash-completion.git\n\n...and then copy the newest version of the bash_completion script to /usr/share/bash-completion (no urgent need to backup the old version unless it makes you feel safer - if you experience some problems, sudo apt-get install --reinstall bash-completion should revert any changes you made just fine.) This is the way I recommend if you're in a hurry to get this fixed. :-)\nNote that none of those solutions will make bash completion inside command substitution work: as mentioned in that same bug report, this is broken in Bash 4.3.\n\n\n*Sit back and wait: Sooner or later a new version will get released (which may even fix bash completion inside command substitution) and you will get it with some future Ubuntu version.

Aborted.\"\nDoes that mean that the memory stick is actually defective?  If it isn't, how can I get past this?\n\nA: I've most often seen gparted used for partitioning & formatting, it's quite robust & should give you more detailed error messages than \"there were errors.\" I wouldn't assume the usb were bad just yet.\nYou could use a terminal to check the drive's filesystem too (not really necessary just to repartition / reformat) with fsck /dev/sdb1 probably. It should be unmounted first (umount).\nAnd sudo parted -l or sudo fdisk -l should say what filesystem type it has, fsck (and mount) can usually auto-detect the type, but you can pick the specific fsck.ext3 or fsck.vfat and use different options, if interested.\n\nFor creating a live usb I'd use a technique like described here on pendrivelinux.com or here on archlinux's wiki, or here:\n\n*\n\n*See https://askubuntu.com/a/554834/129271\nCliff Notes:\n\n*\n\n*Mount the usb\n\n*Install grub grub-install --force --no-floppy --boot-directory=/mnt/USB/boot /dev/sdx (replacing x with your actual USB device & /mnt/usb with mounted dir)\n\n*Put demo grub.cfg ( http://pendrivelinux.com/downloads/multibootlinux/grub.cfg ) in /mnt/USB/boot/grub and edit to match your iso's\n\n\n\n\nA: Write zeros to the usb stick with terminal if you have another machine with Ubuntu.

Using Startup Disk Creator to make a boot-able memory stick works OK as long as you don't try to Erase the memory stick.

I've been setting up a few LUKS encrypted drives and noticed that I've been creating the encrypted disk directly on the 'raw'(?) drive, ie. /dev/sdb, while many examples via google are showing it created on /dev/sdb1\nExample using /dev/sdb:\n# cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb\n# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb lvm_backup\n\n..and then following on with creating volume groups and logical volumes like so:\n# vgcreate vg_backup /dev/mapper/lvm_backup\n# lvcreate -l +100%FREE lvm_backup -n backup\n# mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vg_backup-backup\n\nand finally mounting the drives.\nThis leave me with a lsblk looking something like this:\nsdb                              8:16   0   2.7T  0 disk  \n  lvm_backup (dm-3)            252:3    0   2.7T  0 crypt \n    vg_backup-backup (dm-5)    252:5    0     2T  0 lvm   /backup\n\nIn contrast, other lsblk output looks like:\nsdb                              8:16   0   2.7T  0 disk  \n  sdb1                           #:#     0    2.7T 0 part\n    lvm_backup (dm-3)            252:3    0   2.7T  0 crypt \n      vg_backup-backup (dm-5)    252:5    0     2T  0 lvm   /backup\n\nWhat are the advantages/disadvantages of working directly on the disk (/dev/sdb) vs creating a partition (/dev/sdb1) first? \nI'm assuming this is probably somewhat related to:\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/338937/differences-between-dev-sda-and-dev-sda1\n\nA: Offhand, I'm thinking that if your using the entire device (/dev/sdb) and your LUKS header is at the start of the drive, and if some other tool or OS \"helpfully\" decides that your disk is unformatted with no MBR or GPT, if it were to overwrite your LUKS header that would be bad. If you were using a partition for LUKS then at least a new MBR or GPT wouldn't be as devastating.\nYou should always backup the LUKS header anyway, as the cryptsetup man page advises too.\nAnd this is what the cryptsetup FAQ says about using \"2.2 LUKS on partitions or on raw disks?\" (it's long but I'll just paste it, mentions RAID & LVM can greatly complicate things, you may want to rethink using LVM on top of LUKS):\n\nThis is a complicated question, and made more so by the availability of RAID and LVM. I will try to give some scenarios and\n  discuss advantages and disadvantages. Note that I say LUKS for\n  simplicity, but you can do all the things described with plain\n  dm-crypt as well. Also note that your specific scenario may be so\n  special that most or even all things I say below do not apply. \nBe aware that if you add LVM into the mix, things can get very complicated. Same with RAID but less so. In particular, data recovery\n  can get exceedingly difficult. Only do so if you have a really good\n  reason and always remember KISS is what separates an engineer from an\n  amateur. Of course, if you really need the added complexity, KISS is\n  satisfied. But be very sure as there is a price to pay for it. In\n  engineering, complexity is always the enemy and needs to be fought\n  without mercy when encountered. \nAlso consider using RAID instead of LVM, as at least with the old superblock format 0.90, the RAID superblock is in the place (end of\n  disk) where the risk of it permanently damaging the LUKS header is\n  smallest and you can have your array assembled by the RAID controller\n  (i.e. the kernel), as it should be. Use partition type 0xfd for that.\n  I recommend staying away from superblock formats 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2\n  unless you really need them. Be aware that you lose autodetection with\n  them and have to fall back to some user-space script to do it. \nScenarios: \n(1) Encrypted partition: Just make a partition to your liking, and put LUKS on top of it and a filesystem into the LUKS container. This\n  gives you isolation of differently-tasked data areas, just as ordinary\n  partitioning does. You can have confidential data, non-confidential\n  data, data for some specific applications, user-homes, root, etc.\n  Advantages are simplicity as there is a 1:1 mapping between partitions\n  and filesystems, clear security functionality and the ability to\n  separate data into different, independent (!) containers. \nNote that you cannot do this for encrypted root, that requires an initrd. On the other hand, an initrd is about as vulnerable to a\n  competent attacker as a non-encrypted root, so there really is no\n  security advantage to doing it that way. An attacker that wants to\n  compromise your system will just compromise the initrd or the kernel\n  itself. The better way to deal with this is to make sure the root\n  partition does not store any critical data and move that to additional\n  encrypted partitions. If you really are concerned your root partition\n  may be sabotaged by somebody with physical access (that would however\n  strangely not, say, sabotage your BIOS, keyboard, etc.), protect it in\n  some other way. The PC is just not set-up for a really secure\n  boot-chain (whatever some people may claim). \n(2) Fully encrypted raw block device: For this, put LUKS on the raw device (e.g. /dev/sdb) and put a filesystem into the LUKS\n  container, no partitioning whatsoever involved. This is very suitable\n  for things like external USB disks used for backups or offline\n  data-storage. \n(3) Encrypted RAID: Create your RAID from partitions and/or full devices. Put LUKS on top of the RAID device, just if it were an\n  ordinary block device. Applications are just the same as above, but\n  you get redundancy. (Side note as many people seem to be unaware of\n  it: You can do RAID1 with an arbitrary number of components in Linux.)\n  See also Item 2.8. \n(4) Now, some people advocate doing the encryption below the RAID layer. That has several serious problems. One is that suddenly\n  debugging RAID issues becomes much harder. You cannot do automatic\n  RAID assembly anymore. You need to keep the encryption keys for the\n  components in sync or manage them somehow. The only possible advantage\n  is that things may run a little faster as more CPUs do the encryption,\n  but if speed is a priority over security and simplicity, you are doing\n  this wrong anyways. A good way to mitigate a speed issue is to get a\n  CPU that does hardware AES.\n\n", "Q: Delete Key on Macbook AIr I have ubuntu 14.10 installed on my macbook air 2013 (6,2) and I want to know if it's possible for me to change the behavior of the 'delete' key to that of the backspace key as there is no backspace button on this keyboard. in the sense that when i'm navigating files on the desktop or in nautilus that hitting the 'delete' key alone deletes the currently highlighted file, which is the normal ubuntu behavior of the backspace key.

This is a match on the whole path, not a search.  For\n    example, to match a file named './fubar3', you can use the regular expression '.*bar.'  or '.*b.*3',\n    but not 'f.*r3'.

The * means this class of characters can be zero length.\n\n*The \\. matches a single dot. To match a dot (.) literally you need to escape it within the regular expression using a backslash; without escaping, it matches any single character.\n\n*In the (png|jpg|jpeg), pair of parentheses makes it as a group of matches.

There is either something wrong with the computer, the modem or the phone which is stopping both from working.\nClementine port is 5500, which is the default one, just like 8484 is the default one for Amarok.

Also, file sharing needs to be enabled in Ubuntu.\nInstall the Sharing Service in Ubuntu Linux\nThe sharing service or Samba as it is called in Ubuntu is not installed by default. The installation process of Samba varies in complexity depending on the method you will be using. I will show you the most easy and straightforward method to install Samba.\nFirst, in Ubuntu, open the Home Folder, located in the Places menu.\nNext, right-click on any folder from this window to open a contextual menu. From the contextual menu, click on Sharing Options.\nThis opens the Folder Sharing window. Check the box next to ’Share this folder’.\nA warning window will pop-up stating that the sharing service is not installed. Click on the Install service button.\nNote: If you do not receive this warning, it means that the sharing service is already installed and you should be able to share files and folders. To change the Workgroup, follow the instructions found in the next section.\nThen type your user account password and click on OK. The installation process will begin.\nIn a few seconds, you will be notified that all changes have been successfully applied. Click Close and Ubuntu will ask to restart your session.\nSave any open files you might have and click Restart session. After the restart, the sharing service is installed and fully functioning.\nConfigure and change the Workgroup in Ubuntu\nIn most cases you won’t have to change the Workgroup name because, by default, Ubuntu, Windows and Mac OS X have the same Workgroup name, which is actually “workgroup”. However, if you have to change it follow the steps detailed in this section.\nOpen a Terminal window and type the following command: gksudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf.\nThen, press Enter. If you haven’t previously used the Terminal this session, Ubuntu will ask you to type in your user account password.\nNext, the Samba configuration file will open in a gedit window. Scroll down, if necessary, until you find the workgroup line, in the Global Settings section.\n\nEdit the Workgroup name so that it will match the name of the Workgroup you want to add your Ubuntu computer to.\nClick on Save and restart Ubuntu so that the new settings get applied.\nNote: If you have a network which includes Windows computers, you need to make sure the Workgroup is set up the same as on your Ubuntu computers.\nTo Share Files in Ubuntu\nFirst, open the Home Folder in Ubuntu, found in the Places menu.\n\nBrowse to the folder you want to share. Right-click on it to open the contextual menu and click on Sharing Options.\nThe Folder Sharing window will open. Check the box next to ’Share this folder’. Then, in the Share name field, type the share name you want to use. In the Comment field type anything you want or just leave it empty - there’s no need to complete it. If you want to allow others to create and delete files in the folder you are sharing, check the box next to ’Allow others to create and delete files in this folder’. Also, if you want to allow Guest access, check the box next to ’Guest access (for people without a user account)’. When done, click on Create Share to actually share the folder.\nIf you have selected the option ’Allow others to create and delete files in this folder’ a pop-up shows up, asking if you want to add some permissions to the folder you are sharing. Click on the ’Add the permissions automatically’ button. Now, the folder is shared with the rest of the network.\nNote: We recommend that you only share folders found or created in the Home Folder because those are folders on which your username has ownership. If you try to share a folder outside the Home Folder, you will receive the following error message: net usershare returned error 255: net usershare add: cannot share path as we are restricted to only sharing directories we own. This error appears because you don’t have ownership on those folders. In order to share any of them you have to go through a complicated procedure that has the potential to add security risks to your Ubuntu computer.\nAccess Ubuntu Shared Folders from Windows 7\nAfter you shared a folder in Ubuntu, let’s see how to access that folder from a Windows 7 computer.\nOpen Windows Explorer. Click on Network to view a list with all computers available (turned on at that time) in the network.\nDouble click the Ubuntu computer you want to access. A list with all the shared folders and devices from that computer opens.\nDouble click the folder that you want to access. If you haven’t set up the shared folder to allow Guest access, you are asked to introduce a user name and password.\nIn the first input field, type the name of the Ubuntu computer followed by a backslash (“\\\") and the name of the user account with access to the shared folder. In the second input field type the password. If you want Windows to remember your user name and password, check the box next to ’Remember my credentials’. When done, click on OK.\nNow the content of the shared folder is shown.\nReference: http://www.7tutorials.com/how-access-ubuntu-shared-folders-windows-7\n", "Q: How to set up a Tor relay in Ubuntu? I am trying to set up a relay in Ubuntu. I am able to install Tor and run it but when I go to edit the file I end up never being able to connect. \nIs there a step by step guide for setting one up besides the one that is on the main Tor site? I have the port forwarded on my router and firewall already.\n\nA: The Tor Project maintains a site which explains how to set up a relay. Usually all you need is to edit the torrc file. The file resides in /etc/tor/torrc when you install it via package management.\nYou need to set ORPort and ExitPolicy:\nORPort 9001\nExitPolicy reject *:*\n\nThe network uses the ORPort to contact your Tor relay and the ExitPolicy above advises to be a middle router (reject all exit connections).\nSave the settings and restart the Tor process:\nsudo service tor restart\n\nNow look at the log file in /var/log/tor/. When it shows the following line, all is good:\n\nSelf-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent.\n\nIf not you might want to do some research at Tor's Q&A page. Furthermore the following site might be interesting: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tips-running-exit-node-minimal-harassment\n\nA: For everyone who is looking for the easiest way to set up their own Tor relay I made this config generator: https://tor-relay.co/\nYou just have to enter some basic information for your configuration and the app generates a custom install script that will install Tor and its dependencies on your system. \nIt provides you with a single command like the one below that you just have to run on your server,\ncurl https://tor-relay.co/nf/188b44[...]9dc162.sh | bash\n\nThe only knowledge you need to have is how to log in to your server via ssh.\n", "Q: AttributeError: type object 'IP' has no attribute 'SubnetSet' I'm trying to install OpenVPN access server on a virtual server with Ubuntu 14.04 OS.

I installed desktopnova to change the wallpapers, but then uninstalled it completely. Surprisingly, the wallpaper still keeps changing, possibly every 15 minutes (my guess, I have not measured). I cannot find any corresponding option under setting where I can stop it, or set another frequency. Where can I find the options? \n\nA: You may not have removed it entirely. Muzaffar has the right idea.\nps -ax | grep desktopnova - this will tell you if any running process contains 'desktopnova' and the number (known as the pid) of the process\nsudo kill -9 ##### - instead of the # marks, put the pid of the process here. this will kill the process (without exception, hence -9).\nsudo apt-get purge desktopnova desktopnova-module-gnome - this should remove any leftover remnants.\n\nYou may need to reinstall and remove the package entirely using this method if it has not entirely uninstalled.\nIf you run into any problems, don't forget you can access other TTYs with CTRL-ALT-F6 and restart gdm.\n", "Q: Take a file from Windows to Linux via tftp I have created a TFTP server on Windows and I want to take a file with my Linux.

If you need more info tell me what you want.\n\nA: TFTP predates Windows, so it does not use Windows naming conventions.  No C:\\ drive for you! ;-)\nDepending on the TFTP server you installed (Microsoft's?) and the version (which?) and what the configuration is of your server (config file?  Registry keys?)  you are \"sharing\" some subdirectory somewhere on one of your hard disks.\nThe tftp commands (type ?Enter or helpEnter depending on the server) actually look a lot like bash and the following are the most useful: \n\n\n*\n\n*ls Lists files\n\n*cd changes directory\n\n*get gets (=downloads) a file\n\n*put puts (=uploads) a file\n\n*bye closes the session\n\n\nExamples:\nget test.txt or get test/test.txt gets the file text.txt if and only if you put your C:\\ as the \"shared directory\" in the settings of your TFTP server.\n", "Q: Ubuntu / Bash recognising \"export PATH=$PATH:~/...\" but not \"export PATH=$PATH:/home/...\" So I've been using ubuntu since 09.04 but have limited experience with sys admin.

First of all, i tried finding previous questions, didn't find anything that quite matches my case.\nI have Windows 8.1 as well as Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in dual boot.\nIn the grub OS list at boot, I selected my acer laptop's recovery partition by mistake, didn't do the recovery obviously and quickly turned my laptop off.

I am doing mcs and I am not able to install Debian on Ubuntu. Can anybody help me to do this?

When glxinfo reports client and server, it looks like it defines those just like X does; the server is the host running the X server pointed to in $DISPLAY and the client is the host running glxinfo.  So even though, as you said, there's no X server on the server machine, there still is one running and being queried by glxinfo over the network.  I'm guessing in your case you do actually have Nvidia hardware on your local system that's running X.\nAs an experiment you can try running glxinfo without having a display specified, and you can see it won't even try to work:\n$ DISPLAY=\"\" glxinfo\nError: unable to open display\n\nIf you run an X server on the remote server itself, configure it to use direct rendering, and use something like VNC to interact with X, it's possible to use hardware acceleration on the server.  In that case it'll just send the finished images to your local system.\nAn old post, but related concept:\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/174003/how-can-opengl-graphics-be-displayed-remotely-using-vnc\nThis page mentions x11vnc as well:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC/Servers\n", "Q: How to increase video quality in SMPlayer like cyberlink powerdvd? Cyberlink Powerdvd have a feature called \"software decoding with truetheater enhancement\".\nFor example: \"to up scale the original video to a higher resolution version, which is sharper and artifact-free. TrueTheater HD is capable of boosting 480p video to 1080p.\"\nHow can I have these features in MPlayer? Is there any way?\n\nA: Well you can go to Prefences -> Video -> and enable post-processing by default with max quality, deinterlacing and choose driver for rendering. The best driver for rendering is probably madvr, but you can't run it on ubuntu. I think gl would be good enough and will use (probably) gpu acceleration, so you'll have a speed-up.\n", "Q: What is the difference between wine(x86) and wine(amd64)? I installed Wine 1.7.13 from PlayOnLinux to run Origin client on my Ubuntu 14.04. But the menu shows two tabs with Wine(x86) versions and Wine(amd64) versions.\nCan anyone explain the difference between the two? \nWhich version is more reliable for gaming?  \n\nA: Can anyone explain the difference between the two?\n\nx86 denotes 32-bit machine architecture.\namd64 denotes 64-bit machine architecture.\n\nWhich version is more reliable for gaming?\n\nDepends.\nx86 is reliable for 32-bit games.\namd64 is reliable for 64-bit games.\n\nPostscript:\n\namd64 is commonly referred to as x64. The previously used 64-bit version was designed by the Intel corp which was called as x86-64. It was not compatible with the native x86 instruction set. In 2003, AMD introduced the perfect 64-bit version for the x86 instruction set. Since they introduced it, it is named after them as amd64. Hope you would have enjoyed the history :)\n\n\nA: Because AMD was the first to develop a 64-bit processor, we still call a 64-bit version \"AMD64\" today although there are more Intel 64-bit processors today then AMD ones.\n\"x86\" is for 32 bit machines only.\nSo which is \"more reliable for gaming\", depends on the game: 32 bit or 64-bit?\n\nA: *\n\n*Wine x86 will ONLY run 32 bits programs.\n\n*Wine x64 will ONLY run 64 bits programs.\n\n\nMost of x64 programs come with x32 version, so, for better compatibility you may preffer it.\n", "Q: Solution to slow transfer of files from PC to USB First of all, my apologies: I've seen a tons of forums related to this topic, but nowhere did I see a solution to this problem.\nI've switched to Linux only recently and my biggest issue about it is the PC to USB transfer speed. While transferring the files, I see the bar getting stuck at random times and then filling up again after some time. This reflects on speed.\nSo, any suggestion?\n\nA: Now that you mention it: No one ever asked what the solution to the slow USB speed is.  Everyone just wants to know why...\nSolution:\nDon't buy don't buy SLC USB sticks, buy MLC ones!\nWhy?\nSLC USB sticks are cheap and you get what you pay for: MLC ones are 2-8 times faster (depending on the technology of your original SLC), last 2-8 times longer (again: compared you your Crap Inc Ⓡ Mega! Hyper! USB stick)  However, they're 2-3 times more expensive and are generally not on stock if you walk into any random corner-store.\nBasically: these are mini-SSD drives in a USB form factor. \n", "Q: Latex: installing texlive-publishers I am trying to install the texlive-publishers latex package through tlmgr. After googling around and fixing some errors I've gotten as far as this one:\n(running on Debian, switching to user mode!)\ntlmgr: package repository http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/CTAN/tex/systems/texlive/tlnet\npackage texlive-publishers not present in package repository.\n\nwhen I try to use\nsudo tlmgr install texlive-publishers\n\nAnd here I can't get any further.

Can I skip the \"suggested packages\" or something?\n\nA: Yes, you should install it with apt-get, that is the easiest and cleanest way of doing it. \nThe full TexLive opus, with the extra packages requires over 1 Gb of space. If you have the space my advice is to install it. Otherwise you always end up bumping into some missing LaTeX package.\n", "Q: Nautilus-Actions only show context option for file not folder I'm using nautilus-actions to run scripts and commands by right clicking in nautilus and I know how to set nautilus-actions so that it only shows an option when certain conditions are met, such as mime-type, part of a name or a particular file extension.\nI still haven't figured out how to show these options for any file, but not folders. I'm sure this option exists, but I just can't seem to find it. Does anyone know how to do that? if there is a graphical option, could you provide a screenshot of it, so I can try to localize it? Thanks!\n\nA: I found the answer myself, although I wasn't counting on it to work.\nOn Ubuntu folders have the 'mimetype' inode/directory, so filtering on this mimetype in nautilus-actions actually works.\n", "Q: What does 'history | grep cp -r ' do? I typed this commands by mistake in my shell and then my shell was filled with all the text . I don't know what it does .Please someone explain it to me .\n\nA: Because you didn't quote the cp -r string, the -r is getting passed as an argument to grep, resulting in it searching for the string cp recursively within the current directory. If you want to search for literal string cp -r within your shell history, you can use\nhistory | grep 'cp -r'\n\n", "Q: Can the root user change the owner of a file that he doesn't own?

This causes permission issues for php file upload etc. for files owned by root (or by any other user).\nI'd like to use the 755/644 permissions for my folders/files (rather than 775/664), so I'd like to actually change the owner of the files to www-data, rather than just the group.\nI don't want to run in to the situation where the root user can't access/modify the files though.\nI'm sure this is basic knowledge for most people, but I just wanted to double-check it. If I change the owner:group of a file to www-data:www-data, will the root user still be able to edit/access the files? Would the root user be able to change it back to root:root if desired?\n\nA: In most situations (read default installations), root can do anything a regular user can and much more. If you think root cannot do something, remember it can become a user who can :)\nYou'll be fine.\n", "Q: Troubles with \"Connect to Server\" option I am using Ubuntu 14.04; the \"connect to server\" option has changed in the last few years from something like this \n\nto something like this\n\nSince I don't really know anything about servers or whatsoever I need some help to convert this few inputs to the corresponding one that I need to type in the second \"connect to server\" configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Server: abcd:1234 (I gues 1234 is the port)\n\n*Type: ssh\n\n*Folder: /home/myfolder\n\n*Username utente: myname\n\n*Password:  mypassword\n\n\n(Name and numbers are just random for the sake of understanding)\nWhat do I have to type in the \"server address\" box?\n\nA: I think this should work:\nssh://abcd:1234/home/myfolder\nYou will be asked for a username and a password.\n", "Q: File command returns different results since upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 Ubuntu 14.04 ships with file command v5.14.\nWhen I use it on a JPG image file it returns data.\nWith Ubuntu 12.04 (file v5.09), it used to return JPEG image data...\nWhat is the best solution to keep the same behavior?

try to help. It's easier to modify my answer here instead of in the comments.\nCheck the path to www.google.com using TCP traceroute to port 80:\nsudo traceroute -n -T -p 80 www.google.com\n\nThe configuration of routing:\nip route\n\nThe interface used to send packets to external networks:\nip route get 8.8.8.8\n\nShow the configuration of the interface you saw in the output of the command above with:\nifconfig <interface>\n\nI'm particularly interested in the information on what kind of Internet access technology you're using.\nSometimes when you're using access methods such as ADSL, VDSL, etc. the protocol encapsulation overhead can mean that the default MTU of 1500 bytes will allow small responses (such as ICMP packets or simple telnet requests) to come back to your machine but larger responses will be silently dropped because the size of the response + the size of encapsulation protocol headers of multiple layers will exceed your MTU.\nIf you understand the concept of MTU and want to experiment to find out at what MTU your connectivity starts breaking, you can use ping as a diagnostic tool and request that no fragmentation is done and packets of certain size are sent. Example:\nsudo ping -c3 -Mdo -n -s1472 www.google.com\n\nThe above will attempt to send out packets with 1472 bytes of ICMP payload + 28 bytes of headers (1500bytes in total) which is likely to fail. Try lowering the size of a payload by adjusting the -s parameter until you start getting replies and let me know what it is.\nPlease update your question and I'll try to help you figure it out.\nUPDATE:\nCould you try the command below and see if browsing starts working afterwards?\nsudo iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -o wlan0 -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1460\n\n", "Q: Difference between \"bootable flag\" and /boot mount point In partition table, we can give /boot as mount point. But we can, too, toggle bootable flag. What's difference between those two?\n\nA: As for boot flag, see here. It is usually not needed for Ubuntu installation.\nBoot mount point is the partition you mount your /boot to, if you use a separate /boot partition. If you do not have a separate /boot partition, /boot is just a directory under /. See here for more about partitions and mount points used in Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: The /boot mount point specifies the location to install the bootloader (GRUB, Syslinux), to be used by legacy BIOS-based systems in order to boot when the actual boot device contains a GUID Partition Table (GPT).\nA boot flag, on the other hand, is a 1-byte value in a non-extended partition record, within a master boot record. Its primary function is to indicate to a MS-DOS/MS Windows-type boot loader which partition to boot.\n\nIf you have an MBR (Master Boot Record) type partition table, all you need to do is to set a boot flag on the root filesystem /. However, if you have a GPT partition table, you need to create a separate BIOS boot partition and install GRUB to it.\n", "Q: Does upstart pass an entire script body to shell for execution or process line-by-line?

The documentation of the script directive does not give any guidance:\n\nAllows the specification of a multi-line block of shell code to be executed. Block is terminated by end script.\n\nCan anyone either confirm or deny my belief? If confirmed, I can simply run a self-contained shell script with exec. If denied, I need to look elsewhere for my problem.\n\nA: I was under the impression that Upstart ran the script as a whole using /bin/sh, with exit on error (set -e, or the command line option -e). That is, if any command whose exit code is not checked returns a non-zero exit code, terminate the script immediately.\nIndeed, given a configuration:\ndescription \"Testing upstart\"\ntask\nscript \nset -o > /tmp/blah\nend script\n\nOne finds the following options set:\nCurrent option settings\nerrexit         on\nnoglob          off\nignoreeof       off\ninteractive     off\nmonitor         off\nnoexec          off\nstdin           off\nxtrace          off\nverbose         off\nvi              off\nemacs           off\nnoclobber       off\nallexport       off\nnotify          off\nnounset         off\nnolog           off\ndebug           off\n\nThough I am mystified as to how it ran the second time, since, for any configuration of the form:\npre-start script\nfalse\n# any number of commands\nend script\n\nNone of the commands after false were executed, as expected, so the touch command should never have executed and the mv should have failed on subsequent runs as well.\nset -e is not unusual - you'll find that, for example, package maintenance scripts are also run with it enabled. That is why you would see boilerplate of the form:\ncommand that could fail but is not essential || true\n\n\nIndeed, the Cookbook says this too:\n\nIf a script section appears to be behaving in an odd fashion, the chances are that one of the commands is failing. Remember that Upstart runs every script section using /bin/sh -e. This means that if any simple command fails, the shell will exit.\n\nSee also: Sections 11.58.1 and 18.7.\n", "Q: Default partitions after installations Installing Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.1 from scratch, onto a 128GB SSD drive, I got three partitions by the installer's autonomic decision. I have not configured partitions myself during the installation nor have I opted for LVM.\nThe partitions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bootable partition 86GB Ext4 (/dev/sda1)  \n\n*Extended partition 34GB (/dev/sda2) \n\n*Swap partition 34 GB Swap (/dev/sda5)\n\n\nCan I later remove the second partition and add its space to either the first or third ones? how disruptive would that operation be?\n\nA: Linux use swap partition to increase RAM memory seen from applications - namely, it's the space in hard drive, where unused RAM is stored (if your computer does not have enough RAM).\nSwap is also the place, where your RAM is stored during hibernation, ie, if you want to be able to hibernate, your swap partition must be at least as big as your RAM.\nNow do some math. 86+34+34=154, while your SSD can only store 128GB. You do not have three partitions as such. You have one primary (the 86GB) partition, where you store your programs, data, boot info and more. You also have one extended (the 34GB) partition, which can be thought of as (virtual) drive having 34GB space to hold things. The installer have chosen to dedicate it for swap space - which may be wise decision, in case you don't have much RAM.\nAs for your question, removing second partition (virtual drive) would also remove the swap area inside it. Doing so may increase lag (if your computer lacks ram) and will for sure disable hibernation.\nYou should be free to shrink it, however (34GB swap partition is the largest I've seen or read about). Doing so will increase the space available for you main system.\nPress super key (also known as Windows key) and type gparted. This will open the partitioning tool. You will be prompted for your password, type it.\nAs no system allows shrinking/deleting partitions being used, you need first to unmount it.\nClick on your Swap (third) partition, find partition menu, choose Unmount. When you unmount all partitions that are inside extended partition, it is automatically considered as unmounted. \nClick on your Swap partition. In Free Space Preceding type how many megabytes do you want to free up for your system. Click Enter. Press >|Resize/Move button.\nI'd rather suggest setting up a separate /home partition - a place where users' program settings and data are stored, but doing so isn't an easy task after one already installed Ubuntu.\nSo, you may simply add it to existing partition which stores everything. Just shrink extended partition in the same way as you just did with swap, and extend your primary partition by going to resize menu and increasing its size.\nCheck these links for detailed information\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory\nhttp://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8208-all-about-linux-swap-space\nand these for detailed instructions of how to setup your partition scheme\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/35676/how-to-choose-a-partition-scheme-for-your-linux-pc/\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/116742/how-to-create-a-separate-home-partition-after-installing-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Connect Linux to Mac Samba (Windows like sharing) Hello I want to create samba share folder between Linux (Lubuntu 14.04.1 LTS) and Mac OS X (v 10.7.5) but this is what I get from a command:\nsmbclient -L //192.168.1.18/\n\nOutput:\nEnter mareeke's password: \nDomain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Darwin] Server=[@(#)PROGRAM:smbd  PROJECT:smbx-105.8.70]\n\nSharename       Type      Comment\n---------       ----      -------\nIPC$            IPC       \nJon Johnson's Public Folder Disk      \nMusic           Disk      \nmareeke         Disk      \nConnection to 192.168.1.18 failed (Error NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_REFUSED)\nNetBIOS over TCP disabled -- no workgroup available\n\nI know something about NetBIOS but it is Windows thing... so what to do if I am using windows sharing without Windows box?\n\nA: That's the result I receive from my Mac as well to that command, smbclient -L 192.168.1.111 (my Mac's IP).\nIf you want to access your shared music from your Mac to use or play back on Lubuntu, I would suggest using PCManFM, Lubuntu's File Manager, instead.\nFrom your File Manager (which you can access by clicking on the Folder icon on your taskbar, or in System Tools > File Manager PCManFM)\nThen, you can type in the address bar:\nsmb://192.168.1.18\n\n(if 192.168.1.18 is your Mac's IP address).\n\nIf you'd rather use the GUI way, you can do instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"Go\" > \"Network\"\n\n*Double-click \"Windows Network\".\n\n*Double-click the name of your domain (Probably \"WORKGROUP\")\n\n*Find and double-click on the name of your Mac.\n\n\n\nAt this point, you'll need to enter the password for your Mac's account.\n\nOnce you've successfully entered your password, the folders shared from your Mac will be listed.\n\nDouble-click on your Music share, and find the song you want to play.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu consumes more battery's power than Windows 8.1 I have installed Ubuntu 14.10 with Windows 8.1 dual boot.\nI have noticed that Ubuntu gives 3hr and Windows 4hr battery timing.\nWhy?\n\nA: Windows has power management settings for your cpu set.

If you do decide to install TLP, you must first remove laptop-mode-tools as they conflict.\nClick here for more information on installing TLP.\nNote: if you install TLP, I suggest using the hard drive setting \"254\" to minimize wear and tear to your hard drive. Also, if you want to use indicator-cpufreq, set the cpu \"governor\" to \"performance\". This eliminates scaling from TLP and allows scaling to be controlled by indicator-cpufreq. See here for more info.\nhere for more info on laptop-mode-tools\n\nThe following is for intel users only.\n\nFor more control over cpu freq. scaling, you can disable intel pstate. Disabling p-state will offer the options conservative, powersave, ondemand, and performance.\nFirst, open a terminal and execute the following commands:\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nNow, look for \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\" and make the line look like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash intel_pstate=disable\"\n\nSave the file, exit gedit, and execute the following command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nReboot for the changes to take effect.\nclick here for benchmarks and statistical use comparison between intel p-state and acpi cpu control including power consumption and performance\nintel_pstate at kernel.org\nClick here for more info on intel_pstate.\nInstall thermald:\nsudo apt-get install thermald\n\nReboot for the changes to take effect.\nclick here for info on thermald\n", "Q: Laptop Brightness not remembered on Power Plugged in On Ubuntu 14.10 Utopic, using a Samsung Notebook laptop, I can change the brightness correctly and it is remembered upon wake from sleep.\nHowever my problem is that when my laptop is on battery and I plug it into a power source, the brightness returns to full and remains there even when I unplug it! \nWhen I press a brightness key, it then suddenly remembers and then jumps back to what it should be.\nHow do I get rid of this annoying behaviour?\nNote: I am using TLP.\n\nA: This problem with brightness has been corrected as of 15.04, upgrading is the easiest fix.\n", "Q: How to use dell smart card keyboard RT7D60 in Ubuntu I have Dell external usb keyboard with smart card reader builtin.

(Read the following article if you don't know how. You're user type 4)\n\n*Download the CD and do an upgrade using the CD instead of the Internet (Murpy's law etc)\n\nWhat do you mean that your RAID5 is your back-up?  A RAID5 is just a protection against single drive failure! It is NOT a back-up!  Borrow, bribe, buy anything but make a back-up!\nNo! Really!  ;-)\n", "Q: Ubuntu top bar gone transparent, themes not working, No notification icons Problem :\nToday I was installing gtk+3.12 and i installed some dependencies!\nThis has messed up my installation and i have lost the top bar which shows as transparent and also the notifications icons are missing, although the respective packages are present.

Want to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (need that specific version for ROS HYDRO robot). Now looking at what Ubuntu image to pick. Selected the PC (Intel x86) desktop.iso image. But see that it is a 32 bit OS type when starting from USB. The other image I can select is 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD giving me an AMD64.iso. Is that only for AMD 64-bit processor? Where is the 64 bit x86 image?\nThis is the text from the releases.ubuntu.com/precise website:\nThere are two images available, each for a different type of computer:\nPC (Intel x86) desktop CD\nFor almost all PCs. This includes most machines with Intel/AMD/etc type processors and almost all computers that run Microsoft Windows, as well as newer Apple Macintosh systems based on Intel processors. Choose this if you are at all unsure.\n64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD\nChoose this to take full advantage of computers based on the AMD64 or EM64T architecture (e.g., Athlon64, Opteron, EM64T Xeon, Core 2). If you have a non-64-bit processor made by AMD, or if you need full support for 32-bit code, use the Intel x86 images instead.\nNote also when I select 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS from the main ubuntu page to download (on an intell machine) it collects the desktop-amd64.iso file to download?\nWhere do I get the 64-bit ubuntu 12.04.5 iso file for I5 NUC?\n\nA: Here you are. \nhttp://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/AMD64.html\nYou have to pick AMD64 iso.

File permissions on ntp.leapseconds are sufficient (644, I have tried giving full permissions as well). I'm on Ubuntu 14.04.\nAny idea why this is happening and how can I fix this?\n\nA: I have no idea about if NTP should or should not access the file /etc/ntp.leapseconds However I can tell you why you are getting the problem.\nthe LSM apparmor is denying the read. \nIf you believe that NTP should have access to that file the correct solution would be to update the apparmor profile for ntp.\nsudo vim /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.ntpd\nadd a line that permits read access to the file in question eg. \n/etc/ntp.leapseconds r,\nsave your file then reload the NTP profile\nsudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.ntpd\nWhy is this happening?\nNTP has listening network sockets and has a pretty predictable behaviour , so usually ubuntu will ship a apparmor profile for it and turn it on by default. \nApparmor is a LSM ( Linux Security Module ) Its an extra layer of security called MAC ( Mandatory access control ) and its a way of telling an application what it can and cannot access via policy. It has the last say on access permissions and even if you chmod 777 a file if the policy says you are not permitted to access the file the kernel will deny access.\nYou can start learning here\n\n", "Q: Error running : apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer I am attempting to install the MS Core fonts on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and am running into the following error:\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer\nReading package lists...

I have a mac mini that is running ubuntu server 14.04 and I'm have difficulty not only using apt-get to update and download but for some reason when I started up the machine today and started working it wouldn't let me ping a ip address. It says \"connect: Network is unreachable\". I've tried going into the interfaces file and changing around my settings in there but nothing has worked. I set up a static IP address along with specified my network, net mask, and gateway:\naddress 192.168.0.231\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.0.44\ngateway 192.168.0.1\nI'm not sure what to do here because everything I've tried either tells me I can't because of permissions and when I go to root it doesn't work. \n\nA: I would assume your network setting should likely be 192.168.0.0 as the beginning of your address range given your network mask of 255.255.255.0. So that setting may be off.\nThat being said, if you use:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.231 netmask 255.255.255.0\nWhere eth0 is your desired network adapter.\nAnd follow with the command:\nsudo route add default gw 192.168.0.1 eth0\nThat should create the correct settings. You may need to get rid of or alter the setting in your /etc/network/interfaces file to make 192.168.0.44 say 192.168.0.0.\nAlso, take care doing this remotely as you may lose connectivity changing network settings over the network. I've done it. :(\n\nA: If you set up a static IP address, you are also responsible to declare DNS nameservers. I suggest your file be set up as:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static  \naddress 192.168.0.231\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.0.1\ndns-nameservers 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8\n\nRestart the interface:\nsudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup -v eth0\n\nCheck:\nping -c3 www.ubuntu.com\n\n", "Q: How to setup Belgian eID Ubuntu 14.04 I want to use my Belgian EID to login to government websites online. How do I set this up in Google Chrome and Firefox in Ubuntu 14.04?\nThanks!\n\nA: 1. Add Belgian eid software archive\nAll the Belgian eid related software is in a seperate software archive not part of a default Ubuntu installation. You first have to add this archive by downloading and installing the archive .deb package.\nGo to the Belgian eid middleware page and download the package called eid-archive.deb. Install the archive by double-clicking the .deb file** in the file browser.\n2. Install the card reader drivers\nAfter you installed the archive, you can install the drivers for the card reader. The drivers make sure your computer can talk to the card reader. For card readers of type ACR38U (the ones you get from the government) install the following components\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install libacr38u libacr38ucontrol0 libacr38ucontrol-dev libccid\n\nAfter installation, it might be necessary to restart your computer. These drivers also work for some Dell keyboards with built-in card readers\nIf you receive the error Unable to locate package libacr38u, it means you didn't install the Belgian eid software archive. Please repeat step 1. and run sudo apt-get update to make sure your computer knows about the Belgian eid archive.\n3. Install the middleware and eID viewer\nThe middleware is a program to view your id information from your computer. To install the middleware, run following commands. The first command updates the repo's, this is necessary!\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install eid-viewer eid-mw\n\nNow you can check if the eID reader works with the program eID Viewer (It's in the Ubuntu Menu/Dash).\nIf you can see/use your eID using \"eID Viewer\" then you can continue configuring your browser. If \"eID Viewer\" cannot see the card reader and the card, then you will have to install additional drivers for the card reader.\n3.a. How to setup in Firefox\nAfter installation of the viewer and the middle ware, restart firefox and it should work. See below for how to test this.\n3.b. How to setup in Google Chrome 64 bit\nCopy these instructions to Gedit, or another text editor and Shut down google chrome and run the following commands\nsudo apt install libnss3-tools\nmodutil -dbdir sql:.pki/nssdb/ -add \"Belgium eID\" -libfile /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libbeidpkcs11.so.0.0.0\n\nYou have to restart Google Chrome every time you plug in your card reader for it to work. See \"Testing the eID in your browser\" to test if it succeeded.\n4. Testing the eID in your browser\nYou can test this by going to the Belgian eID test page and following their instructions. If you start the test end you get a \"page not found\" or \"ssl error\", the eID is not working properly.\nIn Google Chrome: Restart the browser after you plug in your card reader for it to work.\nSources\n\n\n*\n\n*Belgian eID middleware\n\n*Belgian eID FAQ\n\n*EID-SOFTWARE PROBLEEM NA UPDATE 14.04\n", "Q: Alternatives for [variable = string substitution] in bash I am learning bash and trying to understand the different ways of making a substitution and assigning it to a variable.\nSpecifically, I'm changing Unix slashes ('/') to Windows ('\\').\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20615217/bash-bad-substitution\n\n*https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/manipulate-text-from-the-command-line-with-sed\n\n*http://linuxpoison.blogspot.com/2012/06/bash-script-find-and-replace-string.html\nWith thanks to Seth and terdon.\n\nUpdated version.

You need to enclose the expression in $(( )): a=$((1*2)), or use keywords like let.\n\n*Variables are not expanded in single quotes, but regular expressions frequently contain characters which have special meaning, so it is safer to use single quotes for the expression, and temporarily leave them to add in our variable.\n\n*The parentheses around (old_word ) mark this as an sub expression, which you can refer to later using \\1 (as can be seen in the replacement). \n\n", "Q: Install Brother MFC-7860DW in Kubuntu 14.04 LTS I just installed Kubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Ubuntu install went perfect, rebooted came to the regualar, grub2 menu, (I say regular because it's the same one I've looked at on my old pc for a couple of years) I choose Ubuntu, it loaded a little more, then another screen popped up with the OS choices, although this looks like a Windows based screen, again I choose Ubuntu, and the desktop loaded, and everything ran perfect. Then rebooting into Windows, again I got the old Familiar grub2 menu, and then what looks like a Windows verseion of the OS choice menu, and again Windows loaded and ran perfect. \nSo there really isn't a problem with having both screens come up, it's just a little annoying to have to make that choice twice. Now I guess I better mention that I installed Ubuntu on a usb hard drive, it did install using the uefi method, as far as I know, because first it works, I seem to remember that it mentioned uefi while installing, although that was a month ago, so I may be remembering wrong. When I boot up I click the F12 button and pull up the boot order menu, and choose the uefi usb device, and Ubuntu loads, or I press F12 and choose hard drive, and Windows loads. \nPutting this on usb was actually more of an experiment than anything, just to see if I could make it work. I don't really want to install to my hard drive at this point, even though installing Linux will not void the warranty, if they can say the problem is caused because of the Linux instillation and get out of repairing it, they will. That's what the manufacturer told me, when I called to ask. He was very honest about it, and said that they will get out of fixing it anyway they can, and that's just giving them something to use. I'm using usb 3.0 stuff, so it's just as fast as if it was installed to the hard drive. \nSo I have two problems, 1. the two OS choice (grub) menu's, and probably nothing I can do about this as long as I'm usb booting 2. having to press F12 every time I restart the machine, even if the usb drive is unhooked and I'm booting into windows, If I don't F12 then choose hard drive, the boot-up just hangs, on a blank screen, it doesn't know where to find the hard drive apparently. \nIf anyone has any wisdom, or even criticism, I would be glad to hear it, that's the best way to learn. \nThanks for the advice\nRobby  \n\nA: I'm probably slightly fuzzy on this one as it's been a while, but the boot sequence goes a little like this:\nPower on and POST->BIOS Boot Device->MBR on boot device->Boot sector->OS.\nSo basically, your computer powers on and your BIOS is set to look toward a device for booting (Hard disk, CD-ROM, USB etc.) and it looks for the MBR at the beginning of the disk. The MBR then instructs the computer to look at the location of the disk with further boot information. This is the /boot partition in Linux where GRUB resides. The GRUB config files contain info for where the / mount point is and where the initial files are to start loading the kernel, and it will contain the location of windows installations and how to load them, too. You might want to check the GRUB config files in /boot to see where they point because they may just point to that second loading screen.\n\nA: OK, I will go check that right now. But yeah, your right first it sees looks for the device, then looks for booting instructions, then mine is going somewhere else before booting. \n", "Q: How to load Ubuntu boot option after hiding it in Windows? I've installed Ubuntu, and I had it set so that whenever I turned on my laptop, it would load a purple screen that would allow me to pick from Ubuntu or Windows. Well, I screwed with a setting in Windows and now it doesn't give me the boot option to load Ubuntu's purple load menu. How do I get this back?\n\nA: I guess \"purple load menu\" refers to the Ubuntu GRUB2 boot menu.\nYou can run Boot-Repair again to fix this problem. \nBoot-Repair is a simple tool to repair frequent boot issues you may encounter in Ubuntu like when you can't boot Ubuntu after installing Windows or another Linux distribution, or when you can't boot Windows after installing Ubuntu, or when GRUB is not displayed anymore, some upgrade breaks GRUB, etc.\nBoot-Repair lets you fix these issues with a simple click, which (generally reinstalls GRUB and) restores access to the operating systems you had installed before the issue. \nIf you can boot into Ubuntu which is installed into your disk, use it. Else, get a USB stick or a disc with Ubuntu inside and in the menu, choose Try Ubuntu Without Installing.\nIn your Ubuntu(make sure that you're connected to Internet), open Terminal.\nNow type these commands.(Copy > Paste > Enter line by line)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nAfter a while, you should see a this.\n\nClick Recommended repair button. Follow the instructions(It will ask you to copy&paste some commands). You should note the URL(paste.ubuntu.com/whatever). Now reboot your computer, you should see Ubuntu, Windows 8 and other options in a purple UI. Use arrow keys to move the highlightned line and press enter. If you didn't see it, that means the repair didn't success. Paste the URL you've noted bolow.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 buggy Recently, I had to switch of my computer by pulling the plug.

All I know is that its not getting power.\nNow, I don't know whether the drive has gone bad or is there some other reason.\nDrive was running all right till 2 days ago. But, all of a sudden, I loaded a disc, after which Ubuntu stopped showing drive at all. Its not even getting power. I don't what has happened. Now, I am using emergency exit and a safety pin to eject drive.\nHowever, on checking through lshw, it shows drive. Also, 'disk' shows it under devices. It even displays its serial number. Moreover, when I checked through K3B; it shows DVD drive as well, but 'no medium present'.\nIf I keep drive ejected and then run K3B, it shows no optical device found and lshw shows status of drive as open.\nNow I am confused where and what exactly is the issue.

It should do all those things even in BIOS/EFI with no OS running.\nIt sounded like a desktop DVD drive when you mentioned a pin to open it, like it should open & close on it's own, if it won't open & close then there's a hardware failure (motor, gear/belt, wire problem) and it just won't work.\nBut you said it's a laptop, it could be dirty & need cleaning, maybe it can't \"see\" any discs.

This was straight after an install which was disappointing :-(\nMy installation method for my laptop comes from an Ubuntu 14.04 Server base with some desktop components. The reason for this is that I have switched to OpenBox which is lovely compared to Unity and I don't run into the bugs I always do when customising XFCE... it's also lightning fast. Unfortunately sometimes because of this it's a bit difficult to google for answers...\nIf I installed the desktop version of Ubuntu I believe it will let you use the the WIFI when installing (which is very nice) however when you install the server edition there is no prompt for wifi and I ended up plugging in a cable for the installation, this left my /etc/network/interfaces looking like the following:\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).\n\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\nWhich is pretty reasonable and correct... however this configuration causes NetworkManager to not start, or at least be disabled... You need to remove all the lines which reference eth0 and then NetworkManager will start properly!\nPretty surprised at this, as I have three network devices. Surely I've just gone down from 2 network devices being managed by /etc/network/interfaces to one, so I don't understand why NetworkManager would refuse to start and manage my WIFI in both cases...\n(Note: From blog post http://keyboardwritescode.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/network-manager-hell.html )\n\nA: This could be due to excess devices being in your /etc/network/interfaces configuration file, apparently Ubuntu / NetworkManager sees any non loopback device and decides that it does not need to start (properly).

I'm guessing, it could have something todo with the X display manager (but that's just a wild guess, if you have another guess, let me know).\n\nA: All the major display managers' packages are set to \"provide\" a meta-package called x-display-manager.

No, but only one will be running at a time by default. You can hack something together to get both running but the defaults won't do that.\nAnd regarding your wider problem, DMs don't actually do that much.

A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.\n\nWhy is my computer trying to boot Windows from HDD instead of Ubuntu?\n\nA: It is booting from your Hard Disk Drive probably because of the BIOS boot priority order.\nGo into your BIOS (by pressing F2) and go to the \"Boot\" sub menu.\nThere, you can find the boot-order. To boot from a CD/DVD/LiveUSB, you will need to move the boot medium to the top of the boot priority list. This is usually done by highlighting the boot device (here, DVD/CD Drive) and then pressing F5 or F6 to move the highlighted device up/down. \nGet the bootable medium to the top (in this case, your CD), Save and Exit changes. Your copy of Ubuntu will now boot from the CD. Also try booting from a LiveUSB.\nIf that doesn't work either, read on : \nAssuming that you have a desktop, I suggest you to pull out the CMOS battery for 5 minutes and put it back again.

Help! I first installed Windows 8.1 on my machine, and then installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This is what my partition table looks like:\n\nThe problem is that when I boot the machine, I see no boot loader selection dialog! Instead depending on my boot configuration, I am either taken to Windows or Ubuntu. To boot into Windows, I have to change boot mode to UEFI, and then reboot. To boot into Ubuntu, I have to change boot mode to legacy , and then reboot. Having to meddle with boot configuration so frequently is annoying and seems wrong. There has to be a better way.\nThe partition highlighted in orange seems to be the one used by Windows for booting up. My (faint and probably incorrect) understanding from this article is that the mount point of this partition had to be /boot/efi, and everything would work fine. Is that correct? Is there a way to mark this parition as such after-the-fact? What would happen if/once this works - will I get  a Grub prompt on boot up to choose the OS to boot into?\nEDIT #1:\nI reinstalled my Ubuntu, this time setting the mount point of Windows boot partition as /boot/efi, but not formatting it. This is how the updated partition table looks now. All problems persist.\n\nNote that I am willing to reinstall Ubuntu if it cannot be helped. I want to get the dual-boot working.\nEDIT #2:\nI tried applying the boot-repair suggestion. This is what I get.\n\nAnd my live-boot doesn't work in UEFI mode either.\n\nA: If Windows is installed in UEFI mode, Ubuntu should be installed in UEFI mode to avoid the mode switching you have encountered.  The UFEI mode install will copy the Ubuntu bootloaders (shim/grubx64.efi into the EFI partitions FAT filesystem into directory /EFI/ubuntu , so they don't conflict with any Windows bootloaders.  Also, an entry will be made in nvram to run those bootloaders (well, shim or grubx64 depending on if secure boot is enabled).  You can make the entry yourself with efibootmgr, and copy the bootloaders to where they belong, but the boot-repair tool will do that for you.  There are many detailed answers on how to run boot-repair, but basically, just run the parts you know you need to, and not the \"recommended\" since that probably does much more than you need (like renaming the Windows bootloaders etc.)\nTry just the convert to UEFI as the first step (and do read up a bit on boot-repair).  Since you are willing, I'd just recommend reinstalling in UEFI mode.  The only odd thing about your system is the placement of the EFI partition at sda5, but if Windows boots, I guess that's not a problem.\n\nUEFI mode is selected in the UEFI settings (formerly the BIOS/setup).  Read some of oldfred's suggested reading, but maybe the forums are a better place for any extended back and forth help.  Every machine should be able to boot in UEFI mode, but some have more difficulties than others running a USB, however, it's not clear you even got into the settings to enable UEFI (or disable CSM compatibility mode).\n\nA: To do fresh install Ubuntu in UEFI mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove \"bios_grub\" flag from sda10 partition (it's only for booting non-UEFI system from GPT-partitioned disks)\n\n*Make sure you're using 64-bit Ubuntu (only x64 version could be\nUEFI booted)\n\n*Booting Ubuntu LiveCD/USB make sure the system firmware is set to UEFI mode (in this case you got text-only white-on-black menu)\n\n*Install Ubuntu with manual partition scheme (\"Something else\" choice), using sda5 as \"EFI boot partition\", sda1 as \"root\", sda2 as \"home\", sda3 as \"swap\"\n\n\nGRUB should detect Windows and add it to boot menu options. All modern UEFI firmwares detect both OS'es, you just need to set system firmware boot Ubuntu by default (since we're going to use GRUB as boot manager).\n\nA: In this situation the easiest way to fix the dual boot would be to re-install the Ubuntu in EFI mode and the steps you would need to do that are:\n\n\n*\n\n*In BIOS Setup, turn on the EFI mode and turn off the secure boot.\n\n*Restart after the step 1 will lead to boot the Windows 8.1.\n\n*In Windows setting Disable the Fast Startup if enabled as in http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-disable-or-enable-fast-startup-in-windows-8-1/\n\n*Have the ubuntu installation USB/CD ready and inserted.\n\n*In Windows 8.1 press and hold the Shift key and click restart, select Advance Options, Select Boot from USB or CD accordingly.\n\n*The after restart it should boot to Ubuntu installation drive and now you can install Ubuntu as you do normally without caring about EFI partition yourself, Ubuntu will take care of it.\n\n*You would see the Dual boot options after complete installation while your computer has EFI turned on.\n\n", "Q: Recover Huge and Broken Gzip file I have a 50.9 GB file which is a backup of my home folder on Ubuntu 12.04. I compressed this file using tar on Terminal from my sda (ext4) drive to sdb (ext4).

Because I'm already too exhausted of this on the third attempt (especially that it took me whole day), I just disregarded the error and was hoping it won't affect when I decompress the file.\nAfter that, I installed a new OS which is Ubuntu 14.04 to my sda drive. After the installation, I attempted to untar the file I compressed a while ago by using this\ntar xvf home.tar\n\nbut I'm getting this error: \ngzip: stdin: invalid compressed data--format violated\ntar: Unexpected EOF in archive\ntar: Unexpected EOF in archive\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\n\nSo I tried to gzip the file using \ngzip home.tar \nand waited for almost 1 hour to finish. And after that, I decompressed it again using gzip this time. \ntar -xvzf home.tar.gz\n\nThe process just can't finish and will stop after 15 minutes which leaves the created 'home' folder incomplete of files I'm expecting. I repeated the process over and over again but won't really finish.\nIs there any way I can recover this huge compressed file? I already tried gzrecover (http://fosshelp.blogspot.com/2013/04/howto-recover-corrupted-targz-file.html) but always fails. Could it also be possible that I already lost my files when I attempted to convert it to gzip?

Use:\nfile <archive_file>\nIf it is indeed gzipped tar archive and it's throwing those errors, I'm afraid you're out of luck.\nUPDATE: I read that the current file you have is a gzip archive:\nhome.tar: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Fri Jan  9 22:07:25 2015.\n\nMake sure you have, depending on the type of compressed data, I'm  guessing 4 times as much free space on the partition where you're doing this.

It's your Flash drive messing with itself or you use Wine.\nI suggest you reinstall Wine, if you have Wine installed.\nRemove Wine completely by typing : sudo apt-get remove wine\nInstall wine again by typing     : sudo apt-get install wine\nThis should solve the issue.\n\nA: As far as I know Ubuntu or any other Linux distro is not affected by shortcut virus. There has to be some kind of a windows process running in your system. Even If we assume if your system is affected by a Linux targeted shortcut virus what is the purpose o it to create .lnk files as those files will work on a windows system. \nDo you find any .exe files or .bat files copied to your pen drive?\nAs Ubuntu documentation explains BitDefender identifies Windows viruses on your system.\n\nBitDefender is a program to check for Windows viruses and malware. It can be run in the background or on demand when required. Once installed it can be found under Applications - Systems Tools. It can be used as an alternative to clamav/clamtk. \n  Ubuntu Documentation\n\nSo if it's showing any viruses it means that there are Windows viruses are on your system. Those will not work on Ubuntu. \n\nA: Sorry for posting this as an answer, but I'll edit and update this answer as we go along to minimise the number of comments and keep things uncluttered. I've got clamav installed and that's just to be able to detect Windows viruses on NTFS hard disks that I hook up though my USB. (no daemon installed) \nFurthermore, clamav is available in the standard Ubuntu software repositories and recommended by Canonical: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ClamAV. Why did you even install bitdefender?\nYou say that .lnk files keep cropping up and that this is all over your company's network. Do you have samba installed on those machines with guest accounts enabled?\nYou say that you've reinstalled using 12.04. Why an end-of-life version?\nIf you can answer the questions above, I'm pretty sure I can help you much better by using free software.\n", "Q: Chromebook Asus C300 - Installation I am completely new to Linux and Ubuntu and tried to install Ubuntu on my Asus C300 Chromebook following a guide.\nWhen I am in crosh having typed \"shell\" and then type \nsudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce \n\nI get the following message:\nsh: Can't open /home/chronos/user/Downloads/crouton\n\nWhat should I do in order to continue the installation and get it working on my chromebook?\n\nA: It seems you have not downloaded the correct package. What you have is a folder called crouton and what you need is a script-file named crouton.\nYou should change the name of the existing crouton folder or move it to a diferent directory before going further as you won't be able to have two items named crouton in the same ~/Downloads folder.\nAfter you have renamed the crouton folder, download the crouton script file from here (make sure to download it to your ~/Downloads folder): https://goo.gl/fd3zc\nsource: https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton#usage\nThen, run those commands:\nsudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce\n\nand be patient and \"answer the prompts like a good person\" . . .\nNow, you can go straight into xfce by using the following command:\nsudo enter-chroot startxfce4\n\nor, you can run it as a \"special shortcut\" with this instead:\nsudo startxfce4\n\nclick here for more info \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu in another hard drive I want to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1 but instead of installing it on the same hard drive, I want it to be installed on my spare hard drive (160GB). So Windows 8.1 will be on my 500Gb Hard Disk and Ubuntu will be on my 160Gb hard disk. Will this work and how?\n\nA: First, make sure to properly shut down Windows. \nYes, this will work fine. I would suggest disconnecting the 500Gb HD for the Ubuntu installation. Then, after you install Ubuntu power off the computer. Next, connect both drives and select the Ubuntu drive (160Gb) from your boot menu or make the 160Gb drive the first in the order for Bootloader devices. Boot up Ubuntu.\nThen, open a terminal and type the following command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nwhen you run this command (hopefully if all goes well), the Grub bootloader should detect Windows. Next time you reboot to the 160Gb drive, you will be given the option to select either Ubuntu or Windows from your Grub menu.\n", "Q: Best way to schedule script, crontab or other options? I never use crontab, and while it ask me for root password, I am careful. \nSo my question is, \nI have to run periodically (let's say every 30 min)a simple script for analyze the text file, which is update almost every minute. If the result of the script find exactly what I want, the script kill a proces which update the text file. \nSo basically I just need some command which runs my analytical script lets say every 30 minute. \nI found out that crontab is probably one of the options, but I is it \"safe\". Why this command require the root password and so on? Or Is there any other options (better, simpler and so on) how to run some script periodically?\nThanks a lot \nP.\n\nA: \nI found out that crontab is probably one of the options, but I is it \"safe\". Why this command require the root password and so on? \n\nWhy would requiring a password make something less safe? Using crontab is safe since nobody can change those files unless they know your admin password. \n\nOr Is there any other options (better, simpler and so on) how to run some script periodically?\n\nI myself would use /etc/crontab. It is 1 file for all users (difference with crontab is that you can add a user to a command line) where crontab is 1 file per user. It does not matter if you have 1 user but with 2 or more you would be maintaining more files than needed. \n\nA: You can set a cronjob for your user only and it will not require your root password.\n$ crontab -e\n\n", "Q: Slow sudo and ssmtp (hosts file problem) I'm running an Ubuntu Server 12.04.5 LTS and when I type sudo su it takes 30+ seconds to open  the shell. Searching on internet, this problem seems related to the file /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname.\nThis isn't really a problem for me to wait, however this is affecting other programs (especially sSMTP wich I use for sending mails from PHP) and Apache is giving the classical \"could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name\".\nSo I've checked the hosts file and corrected it, and now the apache error is gone but the other problems persist. sudo su now takes about 10-15 seconds.\nOutput of uname -n, hostname and hostname -f is:\nserver.example.com\n\nOutput of hostname -a:\nserver\n\nContents of /etc/hosts:\n127.0.0.1   localhost.localdomain   localhost\n127.0.1.1   server.example.com      server\n\n::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\nThis server has a public IPv4 address and the DNS record for server.example.com is correct.\nIf I try ping server or ping server.example.com they work as expected (resolving to 127.0.1.1)\nI've run many servers in the past and this is the only one having this problem.

It may be that your hub does not allow this. Then check whether your hub can be told to give out dynamic addresses only in a fixed range, like 192.168.x.100 to x.200. Then try to assign a static address to your pi outside this range. Should work.\nd) Only now think about port forwarding. Forward the port to the IP address you just specified.\ne) Now use no-ip.com as before. The idea is that initial outside traffic that ultimately should reach the pi needs to be addressed from the outside to your hub, not to the pi, but on the forwarded port. The hub takes care of forwarding it, as the name says, port forwarding :-)\n", "Q: forticlient vpn broke the non-vpn dns I am on Ubuntu 14.10 and I installed forticlient to connect to my work network (following their doc) and some time later I started having big trouble connecting to most internet site. After some search (and many test and configuration that I lost track of...), I realized this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't think the problem happens right after installation and/or 1st use of forticlient\n\n*forticlient happened to show some unreadable error message related to sslvpn\n\n*(now) everything work when connected to the VPN,\n\n\nthen when not on VPN:\n\n\n*\n\n*addresses/sites that I went to when connected to the VPN, still work\n\n*host and nslookup seems to work\n\n*ping usually don't - but for addresses I connected to while on VPN\n\n*Firefox always return a \"server not found\" page - but for addresses I connected to while on VPN\n\n*nslookup output start by Got recursion not available from X.X.X.X, trying next server where X.X.X.X point to a server from my work\n\n\nActually it is the last point that made me realise the problem came probably from forticlient, and then I realised the 3rd point.\nSo I have 2 questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*how can I repair the non-VPN connection?\n\n*how all that DNS and VPN system works in Ubuntu/Linux? What are the files and program that are related, in which way/order?\n\n\nThanks\n\nA: I found out that even when not connected to the vpn, may /etc/resolf.conf contained the server address of my work (the X.X.X.X in the question). Actually it contained it twice, and when the client is connected, then there are 3 of those. I guess vpnclient happened to left those lines when some bug occurred.\nSo I deleted those line, to keep only:\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.1.\n\nAnd it seems to work well again.\nI'll correct this answer if I encounter the problem again.\n\nA: I faced a similar issue on Ubuntu 20.04.\nAfter connecting to VPN for the first time using Forticlient, the system could not connect to the Internet at all. Tried uninstalling it, but that didn't work as well.\nForticlient probably messes up the /etc/resolv.conf file.\nTried re-installing resolveconf, but after uninstalling it, couldn't re-install due to no internet.\nThe solution is to manually download the resolveconf package from Ubuntu repo\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/r/resolvconf/\n\nalong with its dependency ifupdown,\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/i/ifupdown/\n\nand install them using :\nsudo dpkg -i ifupdown_0.8.35ubuntu1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i resolvconf_1.78ubuntu7_all.deb\n\nAfter installation, add the following line in the /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail file for specifying the nameserver:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\nAdding it to tail will make sure the line is appended to the .conf file after any updates are done.\nand run the following command to update the .conf file:\nsudo resolvconf -u\n\nThe nameserver should now appear in the /etc/resolv.conf.\nAnd the Internet should also be back to normal.\n\nA: For me the situation was even worse, basically all 'internet' stopped working, not even the forticlient could connect again. \nI had to manually add a working DNS entry in  /etc/resolv.conf\nThat solved the problem.\n\nA: Extending the accepted answer, in order to prevent forticlient from updating the /etc/resolv.conf file with a bogus nameserver line, I used a command recommended here:\n sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf\n\nThis way the resolv.conf will not be modified (unlike removing write permission with chmod, which does not stop it from updating the file). Beware: it works for me but not necessarily for others - I expect it will fail when the DNS settings are to be auto-updated after e.g. DHCP.\nBefore applying the flag, don't forget to remove the line inserted by forticlient. After applying the immutable flag, forticlient reports an error /etc/resolv.conf: Permission denied but VPN works fine regardless.\n", "Q: Which parts of Ubuntu would you place on SSD and not HDD? (to leverage better system responsiveness without excessive write cycles to the SSD) Which parts of Ubuntu would you offload from an SSD installed system to HDD or vice versa, to reduce write cycles and still enjoy better responsiveness?\nI assume the following, but must be missing quite a bunch. \n\n\n*\n\n*swap partition - unless you really think your SSD will survive long\n\n*/tmp\n\n*any database data directories\n\n*things that keep updating like ~/Downloads and other user login session directories\n\n\nOr is it easier to say what to keep on SSD rather than what to move away... basically I think for SSD longevity per-se, it would make sense to only store programs on SSD and data that is pretty much constant. Is there at all a sensible way to map out the default Ubuntu (Desktop) directories structure by this criteria?\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: I have the following on my notebook\n\n\n*\n\n*ssd. Holds \"/\" and \"/home/\"\n\n*hdd. Holds all directories in \"/home/$USER/\". \n\n\nMy own files are what are written to disk most whilst downloading so I keep those on my hdd. I tend to watch series and download them so it is often: download, watch, delete. \nIf you look at the \"root\" system and want to lower the amounts of writes Ubuntu (/Debian/Linux) is heading towards a system where all files that are written to often are moved towards a \"run\" directory (aka \"ramdisk\"s) . See What are \"/run/lock\" and \"/run/shm\" used for? for an explanation on those.  That in itself has lowered the amount of writes a lot without you doing anything for it. But you can take advantage of this yourself...\nPut /tmp into a ramdisk. /etc/fstab: \ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0\n\nFirefox puts its cache in your home partition. By moving this cache in RAM you can speed up Firefox and reduce disk writes. Open about:config, add i a new string value called browser.cache.disk.parent_directory and set the value to /tmp and it will be added to the ramdisk (as explained above). There is a generic tool for this called Profile sync daemon.\n\nA: If SSD write related wearout is a concern, I believe choosing directories that are not supposed to change much would be optimal. Those can be spotted in the following standard, assuming Ubuntu and software you install on it, conform to this standard.\nhttp://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-2.3.html\nI didn't try it, as it came in too late, but maybe next time, or if I had a quick & safe way to move those paths that make sense from my new HDD only installation.\n", "Q: Set network manager dns I have Ubuntu 14.10.

If you installed it on Ubuntu's partition (sda3), you would have to find a way to chainload the GRUB bootloader via your standard bootloader (from Windows), which is pretty difficult but you would keep your old one as it is.\nUsing any other partitions (win system or data partitions) is totally senseless.\nI hope I could help you if you didn't find a solution already.

After being asked for password, I escaped the dialogue and did not provide it, volume was visible to Ubuntu Disk Utility but appeared locked as in screenshot.\nI copied the device content to a file and opened it with Nano text editor using dd command, to my surprise I could read my password files and content of a text file.  \n$ sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0p1 of=/home/test.dat\nThen I opened test.dat with $ sudo nano test.dat and it was readable.\n\nOutput of $ sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/mmcblk0p1:\nLUKS header information for /dev/mmcblk0p1\n\nVersion:        1\nCipher name:    aes\nCipher mode:    cbc-essiv:sha256\nHash spec:      sha1\nPayload offset: 4096\nMK bits:        256\nMK digest:      6a 18 ec dd 69 40 ae d7 0f 4d e3 97 78 e4 37 34 89 5f 96 62 \nMK salt:        0c 11 ac 0b f6 a4 c7 8a 56 b2 08 5a 5f d5 f9 af \n                71 79 b2 b2 10 de 9c ad 69 cb 07 b0 1d 34 11 18 \nMK iterations:  36000\nUUID:           672050ee-f18b-4811-b4c9-19209a2db971\n\nKey Slot 0: DISABLED\nKey Slot 1: ENABLED\n    Iterations:             145517\n    Salt:                   9d f9 22 84 c7 22 14 94 f5 5a 29 62 84 f5 68 09 \n                            f9 a8 88 28 35 92 cd eb 3b b2 e7 16 d2 a5 10 89 \n    Key material offset:    264\n    AF stripes:             4000\nKey Slot 2: DISABLED\nKey Slot 3: DISABLED\nKey Slot 4: DISABLED\nKey Slot 5: DISABLED\nKey Slot 6: DISABLED\nKey Slot 7: DISABLED\n\nIn the summary, the lesson is to always fill your media with zeros before creating encrypted partition, it is not done automatically, I did not wipe my SD card and all this was the result.\n\nA: that's indeed quite disturbing.\nMay be you can double check from the command line with:\ncryptsetup luksDump /dev/mmcblk0p1\n\nIt should spit out something like\nLUKS header information for /dev/mmcblk0p1\n\nVersion:        1\nCipher name:    aes\nCipher mode:    xts-plain64\nHash spec:      sha1\nPayload offset: 4096\nMK bits:        256\nMK digest:      50 21 48 22 e3 5e 83 ff 09 eb 56 48 8a 57 44 cf 23 9c ae 9f \nMK salt:        0c c0 81 cb 14 17 08 b3 5b c5 91 b9 9e 38 a5 87 \n                36 db 6f 16 55 d2 92 06 e3 96 0e 94 73 8e 13 27 \nMK iterations:  32125\nUUID:           0080a648-0f64-4ea9-abe2-18585a2da9b1\n\nKey Slot 0: ENABLED\n    Iterations:             256000\n    Salt:                   73 19 d4 9c a7 24 f3 bc 2c f8 77 8c 98 b9 46 0b \n                            00 51 d3 bd bb 07 d5 38 e2 12 ff 34 3b 3d 31 42 \n    Key material offset:    8\n    AF stripes:             4000\nKey Slot 1: DISABLED\nKey Slot 2: DISABLED\nKey Slot 3: DISABLED\nKey Slot 4: DISABLED\nKey Slot 5: DISABLED\nKey Slot 6: DISABLED\nKey Slot 7: DISABLED\n\nIt is the data of the LUKS header of the encrypted partition\np.s: By the way, which version of Disks utility are you using ?

This means that child has ended and another program (lets call that one parent) has started it again. As parent is still running in nice 20 its new child will be running in 20 as well!\nDepending on how your program got started, you have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You start the program yourself:\nDon't use renice after the fact, but start your program by nice --adjustment=-10 program\n\n*The program was started by another program:\nDo a renice --priority -10 parent to make the parent and all its new children use that priority from that point in time.\n", "Q: How can I remove Google Chrome from Unity launcher? When I first installed Ubuntu, I installed google chrome directly by a terminal by running some commands that I found in another thread, I don't remember which ones, something like apt-get I think. I then opened it again by a terminal using the command google-chrome-stable and after some time I thought I should probably lock the icon that appeared in the launcher on the left. The problem is that when I closed it and pressed it again it wouldn't open, I had to find the normal chrome icon from Dash and then when I clicked that it opened the previous icon that I had locked the first time.\nHere's what happens when I click the normal chrome icon in case I confused you.\nThis has been happening ever since no matter if I have locked either chrome icon in the launcher or not. I tried these:\n$ sudo apt-get remove google-chrome-stable\n(reinstalled)\n$ sudo apt-get purge google-chrome-stable\n$ rm ~/.config/google-chrome/ -rf\n(reinstalled)\n$ sudo apt-get purge google-chrome-stable\n$ sudo apt-get autoremove\n(reinstalled)\n\nbut none of it worked, the problem persists. How can I make chrome open in the same icon and get rid of the other one that opens?\nEdit: More context: The problem goes away right after I reinstall. If I restart my pc though the problem comes back up.\n\nA: Fixed it!

Although I don't run everything I find on the net, I still don't want to trust them with all my personal files since they aren't in the repositories.\nSome example program's: Sublime, Intellij, various node-webkit apps, java jdk 8, latest node.js build.\nThe solution I'm looking for is something down the line of running the executable as another user, and giving it permission to read selected directories that i own, but restricting it from the rest. I would like to steer clear of managing multiple groups, users, permissions, apparmor profiles manually, that I probably would forget how was setup after some time.\nDoes there exist packages or solutions that takes an executable as input, and then you specify which directories and / or files that executable has r / w / x permissions?\nOr better, the system prompts you when the executable wants to do something it's not already allowed to do, and you either allow it or restrict it.\nIf not, how would we go about making one?\n\nA: Easy: Run the application in the guest session.

The system recognizes that I am in Israel (either automatically via the internet or that's what I told it when I installed Ubuntu) which is fine, because I have the correct time/date, but it also assumes that I want the calendar in Hebrew.  I have the same problem with Google - it always sends me to Google Israel by default and puts everything (including search results) in Hebrew.  That's probably my through my IP, though.  If the computer thought that it's in America, I would be fine manually setting the clock.  Is there a way I can tell the computer that it's in the US or something of the sort to work out these issues?

Using a clean machine, purchased from System 76 with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed.  Got it mid-May of 2014.\nWhy can't I find files in the current and its subdirectories?\nI've tried ls, find , locate, which, and whereis.  Even tree | grep which will find them but won't tell me where they are.\nExample: In my /home directory I have some *.t files.  In some of my directories below home, I have some *.t files.  I am having a hard time trying to find them all with one CLI command.  Any ideas?\n\nA: The problem with locate might be an outdated database. locate uses a database to show you result and that database is not updated real-time. So new files are not added to it when created. They will get added when the database is updated. \nsudo updatedb\n\nupdates it for you manually but this is also done daily by cron on a default Ubuntu. locate is not real-time but very fast. locate accepts wildcards.\nlocate *.jpg \n/discworld/Downloads/Forbidden-Oasis.jpg\n/discworld/Downloads/The-Exalted-Plains.jpg\n/discworld/Downloads/The-Fallow-Mire.jpg\n/discworld/Downloads/The-Hinterlands.jpg\n/discworld/Downloads/The-Storm-Coast.jpg\n/discworld/Downloads/The-Western-Approach.jpg\n\nand \nlocate .t \n\nshould give you results if the database is up to date and there are any files ending with \".t\". You can filter the results by adding a | grep Western (the example I show above would show 1 result; the last one would be shown) if you get too many results. \n\nfind is real-time and as a result it is slower than locate. find will show an error if you search location you are not allowed to search. The command in comments by @g_p is correct and searches from the current location files ending in \".t\". \nfind . -type f -name \"*.t\"\n\n\nwhich is not intended to find files but to find commands so is the wrong tool. whereis is also not intended to find files but you can use to find the binary, source, and manual page files for a command.\n", "Q: Which Ubuntu release should I use for an old Vista computer?

Many will cause the computer to hang.  Maybe, I should be using an older Ubuntu release to match up with the computer?  If yes, which one, the 10. or the 12. ? Appreciate any ideas and advice. -KL\n\nA: It is not advised to install an older version of Ubuntu unless it is still supported (like 12.04).\nFor a machine with low system specs, it is better to install an up to date but lightweight flavour of Ubuntu like Lubuntu or Ubuntu MATE.\n", "Q: Updated from 14.04 to 14.10 and lost Internet access and USB port I updated to 14.10 from 14.04 without doing a backup first. Now I don't have access to the Internet or my USB port. I have looked everywhere and don't know what to do now.\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: PLAN 1\nThis is a primitive approach but it has worked for me.  I used this method again this past month when I mechanically wore out my last computer and it would not turn on. It was really broke.\nI bought a HD adapter a few years ago that is good for both ATA and SATA and converts it to USB. It's sort of like a versatile USB enclosure without the box and just the cables.  Every family should have one of these useful devices.  They are very inexpensive and wonderful to have around.  It'll take a week to get it from Amazon. \nTake out your HD.  Attach your HD through the cabling to another Ubuntu computer (same formatting). Then take all your data off the HD.  Since my last computer was toast, I had already bought a new computer and just transferred the data directly onto my new computer.  You will need an intermediate storage place for your data somewhere because you will be putting the HD back into your computer.\nPut the HD back in your computer and re-install 14.10 on your computer. I'm betting it will be fine with a fresh install. Then take the data from the intermediate storage and move it back onto your computer.  If you have always wanted a larger HD on your computer, this would be a good time to order a new one because you are already re-installing 14.10.  Then you could actually buy a USB enclosure for your old drive and use it for data backup storage.\nEven if some smart guy rescues your 14.10 installation and USB port you can't go wrong by getting one of these handy devices.\nPLAN 2\nMake an Ubuntu 14.10 USB Ubuntu boot disk.  I use Unetbootin.  Boot it through the BIOS and use it as a LiveCD USB.  They call it a \"trial usage without install\" or something like that.  This will give you basically a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.10 and your WiFi and USB ports should work fine.  Use this LiveCD to rescue your data onto an external device of some sort, ideally a HD in a USB case.  After you have taken the data off, continue with the LiveCD and use it to install 14.10.  Then move your data back.  This is a nice trick.   \nYou could also take the time to make the USB disk a \"persistent\" install.  This means the install will remember what you have done to it and write changes to the USB disk.  A normal install disk only keeps it in memory and it is gone when you pull it out.  Now you have a usable version of Ubnutu 14.10 on a jump drive.  Keep it on your keychain sort of like a Swiss Army Knife.  You can get yourself out of tight spots with an \"OS on a stick\".  \nYou can also have a personalized OS to use when you are on the move and boot into your own little Ubuntu version / desktop when you are out and about.  It runs a bit slow because of the slow speed of most user grade SD cards and of USB 2.0 ports but it works.  They say you should use at least a 4-8Gb for a \"persistent\" install whereas you need a minimum of only 2G for just an install disk.  In fact, if you used a large enough SD card you could download your data right onto the persistent disk and use that for intermediate storage.\n", "Q: 404 failed to fetch package Okay, so I'm pretty

Is there a method to recover the complete data on both the drives? and if not complete at least partial recovery? will be very very obliged for help and guidance on this issue\n\nA: It's most likely that you failed to read the instructions, and have destroyed the partitions and formatting of your previously existing volumes, effectively erasing the entire hard disk and all its contents.\nIf that's the case, the only possible chance of recovering any data that was stored in those volumes is \"forensic file recovery\" software; given your track record, probably best used by a professional (or at least someone with experience).  Paying for data recovery will likely cost between $100 and $200 (early 2015) for the attempt with no guarantee of recovering anything, and odds are good that a computer store asked to perform this task will take your money and fail completely.  A data recovery specialist, on the other hand, has pretty decent odds of recovering at least some of the data from the old volumes, but may charge several times the above figures and still won't guarantee results -- and the attempt is likely to take a week or more regardless of results.\nThere's a slight possibility (depending on the options you selected during installation) that Ubuntu installed in unallocated space or shrank a partition to make free space for itself; seeing only a single \"ext4\" volume would be what's expected for that, and Ubuntu can install in a rather small workspace (I have Kubuntu running in a 20 GB partition with separate data volume, and a couple other machines with other Linux distros running in as little as 12 GB for OS, programs, and user data).

The last time I had it on was a couple days ago, and I had no network problems. Today, I can't get reliable network access. Trying to ping www.google.com gets me anything from \"unknown host\" to 75% packet loss. I've been able to load the Google homepage once, but then I'll get dropped from the network.\nI've got a Toshiba Satellite S855-S5378 with a RealTek RTL8723AE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC right beside it running Windows 8.1 with no network issues, and a couple mobile devices that aren't having network issues. The machine running Ubuntu is the only one having problems.\nI've got some superficial Linux experience, but I'm definitely well in the \"noob\" category when it comes to networks and connectivity (Linux or otherwise). This kind of feels like a driver issue to me, but I'm clueless. \nWhile writing this on my Windows laptop, my Ubuntu machine has been erratically connecting to and disconnecting from my home network. Where do I start in trying to fix this?\nEDIT\nIt might also be useful to add that when I'm plugged in to the network, I have no issues. This is strictly a problem when I'm trying to connect to the network wirelessly.\nEDIT 2\nThe requested wireless info output can be found here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9707958/\nFYI: The \"shayler\" network is the one I'm trying to work with. \"freedompop\" is my mobile hotspot. Any other networks are irrelevant.\nEDIT 3\nOkay, so after a lot of back and forth, and attempting a few suggestions, I'm starting to suspect my router. I've done some more extensive testing on my hotspot, and when that has a strong connection, the Ubuntu machine has no trouble staying connected and delivering great speed. I have a NETGEAR wnr2000v3 running the latest firmware (V1.1.2.6) and I'm going to see if I can find any known issues there. If anyone has any tips, thanks in advance.\nUpdate\nI'm still missing something. When I use my mobile hotspot, I have no connectivity issues at all. But even when connected to my home network I can ping just about any domain successfully from the command line. I get the same responses I get from the Windows machine. \nI've found a couple posts that say \"if you can ping a domain, but your browser still can't navigate to a website, try...\" and I've tried those. I've turned off IPv6 and checked my DHCP settings. I haven't found any known issues.\nShould I still be thinking driver issues, or are there other options?\nUpdate 2015-01-21\nI don't know why I didn't think to check this before, but when I use the laptop in the same room as the router, I have no issues. I would think, then, that this is potentially about router placement, but again, I've got 5 other devices within arm's reach of my Linux laptop that aren't having issues. and I wasn't having issues with the Linux laptop until recently. \nToday I reset the router to factory settings, and then I tried my Ubuntu laptop again. I had an excellent connection for about a minute. I was able to load a couple of web pages, and then I tried to play a video from YouTube and everything ground to a halt. I shut down the browser and tried to get 50MB of updates using the Synaptic Package Manager, and the download never even started.\nI've been walking around my basement office, and I'll intermittently get and then lose the signal--sometimes while staying in the same spot.\nIs it as simple as having a shoddy wireless card? Or is it a cruddy driver? We've had the router for a while, and I'd be tempted to blame that if it weren't for all these other devices running smoothly.\n\nA: If you have any problems regarding wireless network and you want to fix it,\nRunning \"Wireless Script\" is required.\nCopy and paste the command below in your terminal.\n wget -N -t 5 -T 10 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/57264241/wireless_script && chmod +x wireless_script && ./wireless_script\n\nand post the result on your post.\n(Detailed usage is posted on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=370108 )\\\nEdit: It seems like your laptop have no problem in the Intel wifi driver(iwlwifi and iwlmvm). However, it does not work well. (deauthenticating from <MAC 'shayler' [AC2]> by local choice (reason=3) in the dmesg.\nIf I were you, I would test wireless router, like changing encryption options or something else. Also, googling messages in the dmesg would be helpful.\n\nA: Tip- dont forget you can always check your internet speed itself to see if your router is not putting out the speed at times you thing at times. I use https://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/  just to further understand what kind of speeds im getting when having issues.\n\nA: I'm sure this was a diagnostic step that I skipped somewhere, but I found the problem this morning: wireless mouse. Yup. Somehow when I read through those posts that said \"Turn off your cell phones, tables, microwave, etc.\" it never occurred to me to try turning off my wireless mouse and keyboard. And it turns out that the keyboard it not a problem. Just the mouse. When I turn off the wireless mouse, even if the usb dongle is still on and I keep using the keyboard, no problems. I'm sure this also explains why the wireless works when I go into other rooms. I wasn't carrying the mouse with me. As soon as I get out of range for the mouse to work, no interference, of course.\nSo extra dummy points for me, but I should note that this is device specific. I tried using the wireless mouse with another laptop, and no problems. So there might still be a driver discrepancy somewhere that could fix the problem. But for the moment I'm done investing time in it. I'm going to go get a mouse with a tail and move on to my next dumb mistake. :)\n\nA: Most likely it is the default wireless driver.  You might be able to install a proprietary, unsupported Linux driver for your wireless chipset.  I know I have seen this issue with Broadcom wireless chips and Linux distros.  No one will help you much once you do that.  In the case of Broadcom chipsets there are some proprietary drivers that Ubuntu will let you pick. I am not sure about your adapter.  The other option is to use a usb or pcie WiFi adapter that is compatible with the Ubuntu WiFi Linux driver or provides a kernel WiFi module.\n", "Q: Resizing a selected area in a PDF I am looking for a program that can resize a selected area in a PDF.\nE.g. on Microsoft Windows with Microsoft Paint I can use the \"Resize\" feature:\n\n(but Microsoft Paint doesn't support PDF and is not vectorial).\nI would prefer if the program works with Kubuntu 14.10 Plasma 4.\n\nAttempts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inkscape can resize a selected area in a PDF but it loses the page structure.\n\n*GIMP is a raster graphics editor application (i.e. not vectorial).\n\n\nA: Gimp which is available in most Linux distributions can do that easily.\nsudo aptitude install gimp\n\nThen open a PDF in it, select an area, Tools > Transform tools > Scale.

I tried to install the wacom tablet linux project thing, but when I did ./configure; make; make-install; it said there's no make file or something. I just need a way to change my pen movement speed. Thanks :)\n\nA: Solution #1\nI'd suggest you check first if your tablet supports the xsetwacom speed parameter. To do this enter the terminal command:\nxsetwacom --list parameters\n\nThis will output a list of possible xsetwacom parameters to set. Look for one called Speed or SpeedLevel. To slow the cursor movement speed down, set this parameter to a fraction of 1 (it is recommended not to go to far to down to 0), and to speed it up set this to a multiplication of 1. So for example to half the movement speed you'd do:\nxsetwacom set <device id> Speed 0.5\n\nYou can find the device id by executing xsetwacom --list devices.\nTo have these changes set every time you boot, add that line to your .xinitrc file located in your home folder.\nSolution #2 (worked for me, Intuos S)\nIf xsetwacom doesn't work, another, probably better way to do it is by using xinput. First detect the id's of your tablet again, by executing:\nxinput list | grep Wacom\n\nYou should now see a couple of id's, the most important are stylus and eraser.\nThen, find the attributes that set the constant deceleration, by executing this for as many device id's as you have (to exit press Ctrl+C):\nxinput watch-props <device id>\n\nYou should see something like this in there:\nDevice Accel Constant Deceleration (284):   1.000000\n\nThe attribute's id is that number (in this case 284) at the end of the name.\nNow in order to slow down the tablet movement, increase this number by executing:\nxinput set-prop <device id> <attribute id> <deceleration factor>\n\nAn example:\nxinput set-prop 13 284 2.5 && xinput set-prop 15 284 2.5\n\nIn this case, my stylus movement was device id 13 and my eraser id 15 so I set them both to 2.5, which as far as I could tell about halved the movement speed.\nAgain, these settings aren't saved at shutdown, so the best way is to have these settings be applied every time you boot. There are many ways to accomplish this, but an exapmle would be adding this command to you .xinitrc in your home folder. If this doesn't work, look for another way to have a command executed at boot on the internet.\nSources and credits:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man4/wacom.4x.html\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1696260\nEDIT #1: Added 2nd solution which worked better for myself.\nEDIT #2: Grammar and sources\n\nA: For mouse i'm using mouse.sh, maybe it is working for tablets too.

You can read more about this in the manual page of xset.\nThe screensaver still needs to be activated in a different way, but a minute should not be problematic if all you want is to save power.\n", "Q: xbox controller keys wont map properly I am using a wired x box 360 afterglow controller. I plugged it in and installed xboxdrv. On the joystick pane all the buttons are mapped properly but when I load a game on steam several of the buttons don't work and the ones that do work are not mapped to what they actually are (right trigger is the start button etc..) i went into the steam controller setting and remapped everything there to the proper place. When I load up a game afterwards its the same thing. I am using ubuntu 14.04 and cannot seem to come up with a solution.\n\nA: Please, try the package ubuntu-xboxdrv from this PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:rael-gc/ubuntu-xboxdrv\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-xboxdrv\n\nThis package provides additional configurations over the stock xboxdrv, creating a service for it and a \"Joysticks\" entry on System Panel.\nThe shoulder buttons are mapped as buttons (not triggers), but you can see how to change some configurations in the package repo.\n", "Q: How to properly rsync / folder? I want rsync the / folder with a btrfs snapshot. How to avoid a potential crash? Should I exclude some folders such as /proc?\n\nA: If you are looking for a simple rsync command to backup your full filesystem, consider using these options:\n# -a --archive\n# -v --verbose\n# -A --acls\n# -X --xattrs\n# -x --one-file-system\n# --numeric-ids\n\nThe -aAX options preserve permissions, mode, owner, group, mtime, ACLs and xattrs. The -v option prints all files being transferred. The --numeric-ids option may be relevant if you sync to a remote location rather than a local disk.\nTo answer your initial question, you are likely interested in the -x option (--one-file-system). This prevents rsync from descending in other mount points such as /proc and /sys. Note however, that it will also avoid copying /home if that is on a different mount point. In that case you need to run another rsync command for /home/.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu Single Boot (Without Windows) I'm a scientist who must use Linux, because this OS is free (open source), and I want change from Windows to Ubuntu.\nThe problem is, how make my PC (Laptop) just have one OS (Linux) without Windows beside it (Ubuntu)? I wish I could uninstall Windows from my PC and change to Linux Ubuntu. And I want my PC just have one OS, that is Linux Ubuntu.\n\nA: It's not hard to have an Ubuntu. First of all delete whatever you have on your PC. Then change format of your hard disk and use EXT 4 format instead of NTFS. After that divide your hard disk into some parts, Like a special space for root ( / ), swap (virtual memory) and home.\nMy recommendation is to use 50 GB for root, twice your RAM space for swap and rest of it for your home.\nInstall Ubuntu and Enjoy it! \n\nA: Most of us use a USB jump drive/SDcard to install Ubuntu and not a DVD anymore.  You need a newer BIOS to boot from USB which you can check out on your computer in advance. You need at least 2G on the jump drive/SD card.  You use a boot disk utility to burn the iso on the USB drive.  Many of us use Unetbootin which has both a Windows and a Linux version.  \nYou can go to the Ubuntu site where you download the iso for the latest version.  In this area they they have nice tutorials on how to burn a USB boot drive as well as how to install Ubuntu.  It is very easy to reformat the drive and install Ubuntu over the old Windows installation, just follow your nose when you do the installation.  Have fun.\n", "Q: Cant change or recover password TL; DR: Went to change password after suspecting my system got compromised, and realized i can't see any users under \"User Accounts\" and can't change password in terminal with passwd ; how do I fix this ?\nAfter getting kernel panic while on an umprotected network ( public library,  that is ) I've realized that the laptopt login screen hangs forever. Once I went to change password I've realized no user  ( i have two ) shows up in users and group menus of any desktop environment.  \nI've successfully changed root password with passwd , but passwd for myself asks for kerberos password ( which is apparently a kde thing ). I currently type on phone , so can't post any screen shots.  \nNow, I do have ftp and telnet on my laptop enabled so I wouldn't be surprised that my system got compromised.  \nAny suggestions besides reinstalling the system or nuking it from yhe orbit ? Thanks for any help in advance\n\nA: I would use a boot CD, and either chroot & change password - make sure you mount --bind the CD $PATH directories though, not use any potentially bad executables - or else just add yourself as a new user, edit the numeric ID's, & copy the current /etc/passwd* to your drive - keeping a copy of the old ones - & re-try; if that doesn't fix it you could download chkrootkit & try that.\nI would be less happy about using a USB stick for this purpose.\nIf it has been hacked, though, there could be any number of hidden things & I'd retrieve my data & wipe the laptop - probably with a cat /dev/random >/dev/sda on the way.\n\nA: What has happened\n\n\n*\n\n*After I've got kernel panic and my lappie crashed on a public wifi, I went to reset password, and realized kerberos would not let me, though the password I entered 100% was correct\n\n*I could not see any users appearing in any graphical app from any desktop environment that allows managing user accounts\n\n*checking with netstat -tpn I noticed an established tcp connection from ssmtp  to a chinese ip address\n\n\nWhat caused the events\n\n\n*\n\n*Last years' spring, when I just started out with Ubuntu, I've commented out  line Exec=/usr/lib/accountsservice/accounts-daemon\nform file /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.Accounts.service. The idea came from a post about changing greeter background. \n\n*I knew of the effect before, but since then forgot what happens.\n\n*apparently disabling this daemon somehow \"confused\" kerberos\n\n*kerberos itself may have come with kde or from mistakenly installing heimdal instead of heimdall (a program for android), but these are more of a guess than facts\n\n*I've been using newer 3.18 kernel, as well as new wireless card (rtl8192se). Wireless card has been giving much trouble to me: frequent drops of connection and interfering with audio in any playback (youtube, smplayer, etc.), which does not occur with the original card.\n\n*the \"chinese-connection\" came from long ago , when I experimented with ssmtp before discovering how I can use msmtp with mutt to check my email, which is . . . .chinese.\nWhat I've done to fix the problem\nMainly what has done the job was removing kde and other several packages, among which were heimdal. There may have been other packages, but i didn't exactly document the process well.\nBasically, in the last 24 hours, I've bricked the system over and over by removing kde, heimdall, reinstalling ubuntu-desktop and gnome-shell, accidentally removing coreutils (and I've now learned about \"Yes, do as I say!\" verification message in apt-get, which you should never ignore  ). I went on mounting the system on a live usb as told in this article (mainly the Update Failure part). I've reinstalled coreutils, bsdmainutils, network-manager, as well as ubuntu-desktop (again, though didn't seem to make much difference) and gnome-shell. And viola - here i am, typing on a new account, which my home folder still in /home and files all intact, untouched. Small copy of .mozilla and .muttrc files made me feel at home again on this new account. Next step will be just to change ownership of my old folder with sudo chown -hR newAccount.newUsergroup /home/myOldFolder and clean up the mess.\nIn summary\nThe whole thing has been just a combination of accidents, which resulted in me panicking. From a more positive outlook, I've learned a few good lessons for future.\n", "Q: Make Linux and Windows share localhost (webserver) files and database I'd like to have ubuntu and windows share my htdocs and mysql databases for local development. This isn't a web-facing site, just for personal development use. Is there a way to do this? Is this a terrible idea?\n\nA: When I first did this I had a lot of problems getting my LAMP stack to play nice with my WAMP stack - I got a lot of \"you're not allowed to access this\" errors when I navigated to localhost.\nI tried various apache virtual host configurations, none of which allowed me access to the files.\nWhat worked was to use mount --bind to put my windows folders into the corresponding linux folders. If this works, you'll notice the default ubuntu landing page for localhost replaced with the \"it works\" from windows. Note that any linux files will be hidden by windows files with the same name.\nI have an fstab entry that mounts my windows partition to /media/windows.\nThe solution was to\n Mount and Bind the files into the correct locations: \nFirst, make an \"upstart file\" with these contents as mentioned here.\nRun this in terminal:\ngksu gedit /etc/init/mount-bind.conf\n\nPaste this into it, changing the ... to the path to your htdocs. Obviously, test these commands in terminal to be sure you have the paths right. The linux file locations are the important bit.\n#\n# bind mounts\n#\n\ndescription \"bind\"\n\nstart on stopped mountall \n\nscript \n\n   mount --bind '/media/windows/.../htdocs' /var/www/html\n   mount --bind '/media/windows/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.5/data' /var/lib/mysql\n\nend script\n\nWith these two commands I got close, but InnoDB was preventing mysql from starting. The problem is the InnoDB log file size check. An easy solution is to have one OS use a different log file than the other. Otherwise only the most recent os will start mysql. You could also delete the files every time you start or shutdown, but it's easier just to keep separate logs. They share changes just fine, just not log files.\n Change MySQL log file location \nIn Ubuntu, in /etc/mysql/my.cnf, add this line in the InnoDB section:\ninnodb_log_group_home_dir = /var/log/mysql\n\nThat solved it for me.\nCaveat: linux is more \"case-sensitivey\" than windows. Where windows will happily go grab an image with different capitalization and serve it, linux won't. Of course, real web developers always are exact in their capitalization.\n", "Q: /usr/bin/ or ~/bin/ priority Here's a hypothetical situation....There are two binaries with the same name.

The partitions you have look totally well for a standard Ubuntu installation. You have a big partition as file system root (/) for Ubuntu and a small extended Partition containing one logical swap volume. There is nothing left from Win7 on this hard disc! But there is no remaining free unpartitioned space either.\nIf you really want to add new partitions, please tell us what for. You can use a separate partition mounted as your /home folder to make backups of your personal data easier. You can also outsource some other Ubuntu folders that are currently located on your main partition sda1, but I don't see any reason for this. Also, you can create new partitions formatted with a different file system such as FAT or NTFS which then is visible to non-Linux OSes like Windows without special drivers. But as you removed Win7 from your machine, there is no need for this as you won't access your hdd with anything else than Ubuntu, will you?\nI possibly can give you more explanation on how to do stuff like this, but I first have to know what you want to do more exactly, okay?\n", "Q: Local version during kernel build broken I'm trying to build a custom variant of the 3.13.0-43 kernel on Ubuntu 14.04.\nFollowing the normal procedure (directions posted at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel) is not working for me if I setup a local version value (i.e. \"-custom\") during the \"make menuconfig\" phase of the build.\nEverything actually builds clean, but at the end of the process when things are getting packaged up, I run into a problem within the execution of debian/rules.d/2-binary-arch.mk;\nThe file attempts to \"Remove all modules not in the inclusion list\" and the argument passed into $* contains the word \"generic\" instead of \"generic-custom\" like it should.\nThis causes the mv command on line 130 to fail because the kernel build output didn't get stored in a path named [...]generic, it was in [...]generic-custom\n    #\n    # Remove all modules not in the inclusion list.\n    #\n    if [ -f $(DEBIAN)/control.d/$(target_flavour).inclusion-list ] ; then \\\n            mkdir -p $(pkgdir_ex)/lib/modules/$(abi_release)-$*; \\\n\n==>>> Problem first manifests here $* is \"generic\" instead of \"generic-custom\":\n            mv $(pkgdir)/lib/modules/$(abi_release)-$*/kernel \\\n                    $(pkgdir_ex)/lib/modules/$(abi_release)-$*/kernel; \\\n\n\n            $(SHELL) $(DROOT)/scripts/module-inclusion --master \\\n                    $(pkgdir_ex)/lib/modules/$(abi_release)-$*/kernel \\\n                    $(pkgdir)/lib/modules/$(abi_release)-$*/kernel \\\n                    $(DEBIAN)/control.d/$(target_flavour).inclusion-list 2>&1 | \\\n                            tee $(target_flavour).inclusion-list.log; \\\n            /sbin/depmod -b $(pkgdir) -ea -F $(pkgdir)/boot/System.map-$(abi_release)-$* \\\n                    $(abi_release)-$* 2>&1 |tee $(target_flavour).depmod.log; \\\n            if [ `grep -c 'unknown symbol' $(target_flavour).depmod.log` -gt 0 ]; then \\\n                    echo \"EE: Unresolved module dependencies in base package!\"; \\\n                    exit 1; \\\n            fi \\\n    fi\n\nI assume some top level input is getting missed and this is probably a simple script or makefile tweak to correct, but I'm not familiar enough with the debian style build system to find it quickly.  \nHas anyone seen this before and can point out what to tweak?\n\nA: So, I'm having the exact same problem you're having.

Thanks :)\n\nA: As I understand it, you can only import objects, not bare functions, into QML from C++.  Thus, you need to make your open_terminal function into a method of terminal_launcher, add a terminal_launcher object to your QML file, and then call its open_terminal method at the appropriate place.\nAn adaptation of your code follows.  Note that I've renamed terminal_launcher to TerminalLauncher to match to Qt style.\nterminal_launcher.h\n#ifndef TERMINAL_LAUNCHER_H\n#define TERMINAL_LAUNCHER_H\n\n#include <QObject>\n#include <QProcess>\n\nclass TerminalLauncher : public QObject\n{\n    Q_OBJECT\n\npublic:\n    Q_INVOKABLE void open_terminal();\n\nprivate:\n    QProcess proc;\n};\n\n#endif // TERMINAL_LAUNCHER_H\n\nopen_terminal is now a method.  It is tagged as Q_INVOKABLE so that it can be used from QML.  proc has been made an instance property to avoid it being garbage-collected when the method finishes executing, but the child process is still around.\nterminal_launcher.cpp\n#include \"terminal_launcher.h\"\n\nvoid TerminalLauncher::open_terminal() {\n    this->proc.start(\"gnome-terminal\", QIODevice::ReadWrite);\n}\n\nmain.cpp\n#include <QGuiApplication>\n#include <QQuickView>\n#include <QString>\n#include <QtQml>\n#include \"terminal_launcher.h\"\n\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);\n    qmlRegisterType<TerminalLauncher>(\"com.example.launcher\", 1, 0, \"Launcher\");\n\n    QQuickView view;\n    view.setSource(QUrl(\"main.qml\"));\n    view.setResizeMode(QQuickView::SizeRootObjectToView);\n    view.show();\n\n    return app.exec();\n}\n\nThe call of qmlRegisterType is critical, as it allows the TerminalLauncher class to be instantiated in QML.  The first argument is the module name which must be imported.  The second and third are the major and minor version numbers.  The fourth argument is the name by which this class in known in QML.  You probably want to make it the same as it is in C++, to avoid driving yourself insane, but I've made it different just to show that it can be.\nmain.qml\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport QtQuick.Controls 1.1\nimport com.example.launcher 1.0\n\nRectangle {\n    width: 200\n    height: 51\n\n    Launcher {\n        id: launcher\n    }\n\n    Button {\n        x: 25\n        y: 8\n        width: 150\n        height: 35\n        text: \"test\"\n        onClicked: launcher.open_terminal();\n    }\n}\n\nI've greatly simplified this to show the relevant parts.  Note that I instantiate a Launcher object and then call its open_terminal method when the Button is clicked.\ntermlaunch.pro\nCONFIG += qt\nQT += quick\nHEADERS = terminal_launcher.h\nSOURCES = main.cpp terminal_launcher.cpp\nTARGET = termlaunch\n\nThis project file instructs qmake to create a binary called termlaunch.  All of these files should go in the same directory.\n", "Q: problem with pokerstars installation using wine I'm trying to install pokerstars with the wine.

I'll be travelling and I hope to back up my laptop in case it gets stolen. I wonder if I can make my backup a bootable USB flash drive, that way I could just have my system as-is on stick and use it on any computer. \nIs this possible? What are the limitations? (only 64-bit systems? No way to keep it up to date?, etc...)\nUpdate: Thanks so much for the thoughtful responses! At this point, I'm wondering how I should go about keeping my system backed up to a bootable external drive.\n\nA: I've been doing this for years. I'm writing now from a PC which does not even contain an internal hard drive. I don't even carry a laptop, just this high performance USB flash media.\nI will now outline the two components you need to buy if you want decent performance.  Most flash drives are too slow for most people, and they can also become unstable due to overuse of the type they get running operating systems and particularly swapspace.\nI use this USB3 to mSATA SSD flash media adapter, priced here at US$19.\nAnd inside it, I use an mSATA SSD drive originally made for today's tablet and netbook computers. Though I manage to get by on just 64 GB myself, you may choose to buy something with greater capacity. Last I checked, the capacity of these drives was up to around 1 TB. I remember when the largest available was just 32 GB.\nIf you would like something still more rugged, I can recommend this similar USB3-mSATA adapter which is made from a solid section of extruded aluminum. It is almost exactly the same price. Whereas the model I previously recommended is only 2/3 the thickness, it would probably cave if stepped on. This one might tolerate a car driving over it.\nTo the best of my knowledge, nobody has made a waterproof model yet, but it's only a matter of time. The strange thing is that as obvious as these appear as portable operating system environments, apparently all references to these regard their use entirely for portable data.\nOne last detail. It is my practice to keep a 128 GB common slow flash drive in one of the more regularly used computers and have the portable drive automatically back up critical data to it when it is used there. The automatic backup software I'm using is that which is included with Ubuntu and it encrypts its backups. This way whether I lose the boot drive, or my home is robbed, the odds of actually losing all my current personal data are incredibly low.\n\nA: This should be possible; your flash drive just needs to have enough memory for the OS and whatever files you'll be using. The limitations are based on the flash drive and/or the computer you run it (but most likely the read/write speed of the flash drive will have a larger impact on speed).\nThe stick is used as memory similar to any other harddrive in a laptop or desktop computer. You could probably boot from one flash drive with Ubuntu flashed onto it and select your other flash drive as the destination hard disk drive for the OS.\nI'm no expert in this, but it should be do-able, just slow.\n\nA: Yes, this is completely possible.\nFirst and foremost, you will need at least 2 USB ports available, or 1 USB port and 1 CD-Drive.\nYou start by booting into a Live-CD version of Ubuntu with your hard-drive where it is and the target device plugged into USB. Mount your internal drive and target USB to any paths you like.\nOpen up a terminal and enter the following commands:\ntar cp --xattrs /path/to/internal | tar x /path/to/target/usb\nYou can also look into doing this through a live installation and a utility called CloneZilla, but I am unsure of exactly how to use CloneZilla. The above method is what I used to copy my 128GB hard-drive's installation of Ubuntu to a 64GB flash drive.\n\nA: I'm adding ANOTHER ANSWER to answer your OTHER QUESTION, which you added to your first question after I offered my original answer, chosen above:\nyou wrote:\n\nUpdate: Thanks so much for the thoughtful responses! At this point,\n  I'm wondering how I should go about keeping my system backed up to a\n  bootable external drive.\n\nWhat you are asking can be answered different ways depending on what you are trying to do.  I can think of four possible ways, I will explain in outline format below:\n1)  Synchronize data-only across two bootable drives:\nThis seems to be what you want to do, but I believe you will run into a problem which will impede data security.  I will explain. \nIt seems to me that you seek to SYNCHRONIZE data files between two (or more) bootable operating systems.  Though I've never actually done this, I know that it is only a google-search away, and very likely explained on this site.  However for that to work, you'd almost have to turn encryption off, or rather, never turn encryption on.  In my opinion, if you are going to have portable bootable external drive, they should always have data encryption turned on, so unless you discover a drive synchronize that can also accept password data, or unless you decide to travel without data encryption, this is not a viable solution.\n2)  Clone again the internal or external drive in its entirety to another drive:\nUse the \"Clonezilla\" utility, mentioned in the very last paragraph of my original answer, to clone the original internal drive to another external drive to make two such external bootable drives to keep track of.\n3) Use the backup utility included with Ubuntu with your external bootable drive:\nThis is what I do.  I boot (nearly) ALL MY COMPUTERS to a single external drive which travels with me, and when I am home, the 128gb slow usb flash drive, which remains plugged in my home computer, makes incremental backups of changed files on the traveling boot drive.\nIn your case, I would recommend that in the interest of data security, that you physically remove your internal hard drive and leave it at home.  It will frustrate the heck out of anyone who steals your laptop, in fact if they get to try it before they steal it, they might even decide it is broken and leave it alone.  If the thought of having only one bootable external drive frightens you, bring two and mark the spare clearly as such so it is never used unless the first one is lost or destroyed.  As long as you create the backup drive on the first external drive before cloning it to make a second external drive the incremental backup drive will continue to work with the spare bootable drive.\n4) Use the backup utility included with Ubuntu in the traditional method:\nUse the backup utility to backup just the data from the internal drive to an ENCRYPTED data-only external drive.  You can configure it to make \"incremental\" backups of any changed files on your internal hard drive to the external, non bootable, SSD.\n\nA: Yes you can copy a full Ubuntu OS (with Programs, customizations and all ) from your Desktop or Laptop Hard drive to an external USB Flash Drive or external Hard drive. I just did it for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to an external Hard drive (but equally applicable to USB Flash drive as well)\nRequired software / hardware:\n1 Destination External Hard Drive / Destination USB Flash Drive to have the cloned OS\n1 Source OS (Ubuntu or any other OS that needs to be cloned)\n1 USB Drive (with at least with as much capacity (256 MB - 1 GB) as a clonezilla live USB requires)\n1 computer / laptop having Windows which can run Live Linux USB creator\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Clonezilla from http://clonezilla.org/downloads/download.php?branch=stable (download the ISO) \n\n*Download Live Linux USB Creator (Lili) from http://www.linuxliveusb.com/en/download\n\n*Create a bootable Clonezilla (Live Clonezilla) on USB by running Live Linux USB Creator.\n\n*Configure your Source desktop / laptop to boot from a USB drive\n\n*Insert both, the destination external hard drive or destination USB Flash drive in 1 USB Slot and the Clonezilla Live USB drive in other slot and boot.\n\n*Clonezilla will take some time to read partition info When the Clonezilla UI appears, select default menu entries.\n\n*[With Caution] select Source Partition info and Destination partition info\nIt may be noted that Clonezilla would require space on destination USB Flash drive or external hard disk which is equivalent of the source Hard disk and it will erase all data from the destination USB Flash drive / external hard drive.\n\n*Once all is selected, Clonezilla will create a live OS on the destination drive / flash drive\n\n*Test the cloned OS by removing Clonezilla Live USB drive and booting from the Live OS which has been cloned onto the destination External drive / USB Flash drive.\nEnjoy !\n", "Q: root password request pop-up every 15 minutes I don't know what application is asking for the root password for every 15 minutes.

I have not been able to find a keyboard selection that supports the slash, pipe key (i.e., \\ |) and the quote key (i.e., \" and ')  Most of the selections (such as English US have the \\ | key translated to < and > respectively.  The one one keyboard layout that I have found that has the \\ | key working correctly, English (US, alternative international) then does't support the quote key (or more appropriate the quote key appears to be a dead key.)\nHas anyone else run into this issue and if so have you found a solution for it.\nThanks\n\nA: I have the same laptop and had to examine the XKB files closely to find out what layout would work with this keyboard.\nI found that configuring the keyboard as an Intel Classmate PC layout solves the issue with the pipe/bashslash key as well as the quote/dblquote key.\nI have not found any issues with the keyboard layout since configuring it as a Classmate PC layout.\nTo configure the keyboard in the console, execute this command as root (or sudo): dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\nThe keyboard can be found under the name \"Classmate PC\".\nNote that the settings may have to be reconfigured in X for each user by choosing the correct layout from the system settings panel (in KDE, at least).\nTo reconfigure in KDE, go to input devices from the system settings panel and change the selected option for 'Keyboard Model'.  In KDE, the keyboard is listed as \"Intel | Classmate PC\".\n\nA: I have found that when using the English, US, Alternative international keyboard I can get ' with Alt Gr+\" and \" with Alt Gr+Shift+\"\nAlternatively I have used on-board (the on screen keyboard) to insert pipes and slash.\nThese are just workarounds and not long term solutions, since both are a little cumbersome.  I regularly need slashes and quotes and neither solution works for both easily.\nMy next step is to get a USB keyboard and use that... \n", "Q: How to securely lock Ubuntu, when fragile program is installing? I managed to install game that has to go through lots of updates. It's not a game for Ubuntu, more for Windows or Mac. As I see the speed of it's own update, I don't think it'll finish before I will have to go to sleep. I would leave it over night, but I would like to have it updating.\nThis program is extremely fragile. You will run it twice = Crash; You will click on it when it's busy = Crash. It's like severly fragile program that needs superiously special treatment to hold it up, so it does it's job and I can finally run it.\nIs there a way to lock screen and keep it going? I mean, sleeping is not a solution, it will probably crash. I mean I could [Super] + [L], but this will result in sleeping over 30 minutes. Is there something to do about this?\nIs there a way, to securely block computer from people who should stand away from it, while keeping program going on until I'm back?\n\nA: You can try pressing [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[L] instead of [Super]+[L]. This will lock your screen without sleeping or hibernate.\n", "Q: CTRL and ALT keys mapped to Shift for some reason I installed Ubuntu 14.04, and I'm loving it.

You need to burn it like CD or DVD. You can make a live USB by using the following method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu ISO image from http://releases.ubuntu.com\n\n*Download Unetbootin from http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net\n\n*Insert your USB, then launch Unetbootin. Check “Diskimage” and choose the Ubuntu ISO file. Your USB drive should be selected automatically.\n\n*Click OK to start creating Live USB.\n\n*You'll see \"Installation complete, Reboot(Current)\" once finished.\n\n\nA: Check if your processor is 64 or 32 bits. Then download the appropriate Ubuntu ISO file. After that, do not copy the ISO file into your USB key, that is useless.

Is there an environment variable in CSH to change the PS2 like in bash and sh?\nFor example:\n$PS2 = \"hi\"\n\nI tried it but it doesn't work in csh.\n\nA: I'm going to assume you're using tcsh, which has prompt2 (not available in the original csh, AFAIK almost all of all versions of csh are tcsh these days).\nFrom the manpage, section \"Special shell variables\":\n\nprompt2 (+)\n  The string with which to prompt in while and foreach loops and after lines ending in \\'. The same format sequences may be used as in prompt (q.v.); note the variable meaning of%R'. Set by default to `%R?

If I create a script in a file like this:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"test\"\n\nAs far I know (as a newbie) is to put it in some folder then make it executable with\nchmod +x myscript\n\nand then execute it with something like ./myscript.\nI think it's not simple if I have to create file for every command I create. I think it will be more simple if I can just put it in a single file and then make it executable without adding ./ in front of every command that I created. Is it possible?\n\nA: You need to add the ./ to run commands from scripts in the local directory, because commands that do not contain / in their name are looked up only in the directories mentioned in the $PATH value. Normally that value contains only absolute paths, and in particular does not contain a path ., so that the current working directory is not looked at. This is a Good Thing, because otherwise one could try to trick users into executing scripts without intending to do so by placing scripts with names matching common commands such as ls in certain directories; also it is not usually very practical to make certain commands only visible when the current directory has some specific value.\nThe natural solution is to have a certain directory were you place the private commands that you want to be able to call, and ensure that the (absolute) name of that directory occurs in $PATH. The traditional place for such a directory is $HOME/bin.\n\nA: Solution 1: Bash functions\nBash functions behave much the same like commands. You can put functions into - for example - your ~/.bashrc file, like\nhello() {\n   echo Hello World!\n}\n\nThen you can run this like any other command as long as you start it from your shell, and not from a cron job, init script etc:\nme@pc:~$ hello\nHello World!\n\nSolution 2: The ~/bin directory\nThe default ~/.profile file adds the ~/bin directory to your path if that directory exists. So create a bin directory in your home folder, and place your scripts into that that directory. You still have to use chmod +x on the scripts, but you do not have to prefix them with ./\nDo not forget to relogin after creating the bin directory!\n\nA: I have a bunch of aliases and shell functions defined in my ~/.bashrc\nalias ll='ls -lh'\nalias li='ls -lhi'\nalias lll='ls -lhL'\nalias l='ll'\ncomplete -F _longopt l ll lll li  # this doesn't actually work\n\npsg(){ ps aux | grep ${*:-$USER} | grep -v grep; }\npsgw(){ ps auxww | grep ${*:-$USER} | grep -v grep; }\n\n# expand aliases for sudo\nalias sudo='sudo '\nalias imv='imv -i'\nalias mv='mv -i'\nalias cp='cp -i'\nalias rm='rm -i'\nalias prealloc-mv='rsync --remove-source-files --sparse --preallocate -aH'\nalias m=less\nexport LESS=iMRj5\nalias j='jobs -l'\nalias dr='disown -r'\n\ncmpll() { ll \"$@\"; cmp \"$@\" && echo identical; }\nfindll() { find \"$@\" -exec ls -dlh --color=auto {} +; }\nfindinamell() {\n    local i  args=()\n    for i in \"$@\";do\n            args+=( '-iname' )\n            args+=( \"*$i*\" )\n    done\n    findll \"${args[@]}\";\n}\n\nAs others have pointed out, ~/bin is in your $PATH by default, if it exists, so you can put things that are too big for an alias or shell function there.  I actually have several really small scripts in my ~/bin, IDK why I decided to make them files instead of aliases.  Search for \"COMMAND EXECUTION\" in the bash man page for more details about how commands are interpreted.  man bash.\nIf I'm cooking up some commands that are only applicable to something I'm working on in a certain directory, I might well put the commands in a file there, and run it with ./do-stuff.sh.  Your fingers will get used to typing ./ pretty quickly.  You might also keep a text file of useful commands you've used, along with a description of what they do.  I do this sometimes when I don't think it's worth the time to turn it into a function or script that takes parameters, but instead just paste it in and edit it as appropriate.  e.g. for playing back audiobooks, I often use:\nmpl() { t=2200; mplayer -ss $(($t * ($1%2))) -endpos $(($t+5))  disc$(printf '%02d' $((1 + $1/2)))-38.mp3; date; }; mpl 4\n(this plays 2200 seconds of audio, starting at either the beginning ($1 odd), or 2200sec in, to one of many numbered tracks.  Basically map a linear index into a set of audio files that are each two listening-chunks long.)\nI can up-arrow and edit the very end of the command line with my monitor off, while I'm falling asleep.  I use a shell function so the part I need to edit is right at the very end.  Aliases only work if all the arguments can go right at the end of the fixed part of the command.\nI'm sure there's a ton of good stuff out there if you google, but there's probably a ton of outdated and less-useful stuff too, and I don't want to take time to evaluate a guide right now.\n\nA: You can always out it in the bin directory. Or, let's say it's a she script at the location of /home/user/Desktop/hello.sh you can open up ~/.bashrc and add to it\n    hello() {\n    '/home/user/Desktop/hello.sh'\n    }\n\nThen, you can execute 'hello' in the terminal and it should work perfectly.\n", "Q: unable to install webapps from firefox in 14.10 I've upgraded to 14.10 and I'm not able to install webapps from Firefox.

I am asking myself for quite some time this question.\nWith a normal laptop you can have at least two internet connections: ethernet (wired LAN) and wifi (wireless). If you use a USB cellular modem (GPRS, 3G or LTS) you can add one more connection.\nThe difference between ethernet and the wireless connections is the available bandwidth. And the cellular internet connection has in most cases some kind of cost associated.\nSo, how does Linux decide which connection to use for the internet traffic?\n\nA: I think it uses the last one that was connected... \nAnd uses different routes (route / iptables) to decide where to send internet traffic. \nIn case you wanted to have 2 connections at the same time, but choose which one to use for internet traffic I know there are ways to choose between them. Luckily you didn't ask how because I don't remember at the moment...

You can choose one of many backup tools (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem#Backup_Utilities) to achieve that, or you can just copy the files manually if you know exactly what you need to keep.\nThere are two options to have Ubuntu 14.10 64-bit on your larger drive: performing a fresh install (like you suggested) or moving your current installation to your larger drive. The second option might take a bit more time, but you won't lose your current installation.\nOption 1: Fresh install \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot on your LiveUSB and start up GParted.\n\n*Erase all three Ubuntu installations (likely all ext4 partitions).\n\n*Start the Ubuntu installer and choose to install manually (choose your own partitions). Setup an ext4 partition on your larger drive and set it up as your root directory (/). You can setup a separate partition for your home directory (/home) if you wish.\n\n\nOption 2: Moving your current installation\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot on every Ubuntu installation once to identify which installation is on which partition. Before booting on a system, note the partition number mentioned in GRUB (eg. /dev/sda1). Once Ubuntu has booted, head over to the menu at the top-right of your screen and select \"About this computer\". Note down the version (14.04 or 14.10) and the OS type (32-bit or 64-bit). Repeat for all three Ubuntu installations.\n\n*Boot on your LiveUSB and start up GParted.\n\n*Erase the partitions that contain Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit and Ubuntu 14.10 32-bit.\n\n*Copy your Ubuntu 14.10 64-bit installation to your larger drive.\n\n*Once the copy is done, erase your Ubuntu 14.10 64-bit partition from your smaller drive, keeping your copy on the larger drive.\n\n*Repair GRUB: Use Boot-Repair to restore your bootloader and have it configured according to your new partition layout.

Kindly provide me with positive answers.\nThanks in advance & thank you so much to AskUbuntu Community.\n\nA: 1&2) You should probably look into a firewall instead.  With that, you can just shut off access to various sites.  One easy-to-use solution that could run on your spare desktop is untangle http://www.untangle.com.  Untangle can also block mimetypes i.e. mp3.  You can block .torrent files but actual torrenting apps are more difficult.\nIf you would like to use the server box with ubuntu as a firewall, you need to do a bit more manual setup.  There is a good intro here https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/firewall.html\n3) Some wifi routers can filter on MAC address.  If this is the case for you, you can just enter the MAC of all your trusted PCs/devices.  Although iptables/ufw have MAC filtering it will likely not work from behind the wireless router.  That's why you need it in the router itself.\n4) Not sure what you mean by this - if you mean web serving via the server, then you can use Squid web proxy on your ubuntu server. You can automatically route web traffic through Squid using this setup on ubuntu.  I am only allowed 2 links in my answer so google for \"ufw squid transparent\" or \"iptables squid transparent\".  I prefer iptables, personally, but ufw is what Ubuntu uses normally.\nIf you want to use the server as a central filestore you can configure 'cifs' in ubuntu.  I am not sure how that relates to/helps your other problems, though.\n5) For this, you want \"Quality of Service\" rules.  Untangle can do this.  For Ubuntu, look for an app called wondershaper.  QoS will let you cap the bandwidth each machine is using so if someone is abusing your network, you only lose 10% performance (or however you've set it up).\n", "Q: envivo mini diasscanner driver workaround Hi I have attached my envivo mini diasscanner to a usb port.\nLsusb finds it as: Bus 002 Device 005: ID 0ac8:3370 Z-Star Microelectronics Corp.

Thus, when you do:\nfoo file.txt | bar > file.txt\n\nThe redirection to file.txt causes it to be truncated before foo is run and can read file.txt. On a side note, this is why you cannot do:\nsed 'blah' file.txt > file.txt\n\nAnd why sed has an in-place editing option.\nLastly, doing:\n.. | cat > file.txt\n\nis a useless use of cat, especially so if you are attempting to read from file.txt earlier on.\nIf you want to reverse a file in-place, there are no shortcuts.

This happens while receiving any information through pipe \"|\"\n>>\nRedirects and concatenates to the information it was pointed to. This happens while receiving any information through pipe \"|\"\nIn both cases if the file does not exist, it will be created instead. Only on \">>\" will the information be concatenated if you run it again on the same file. With \">\" you would simply overwrite everything you did on the first run.\nBut here is the deal when using the same input file as the output file. In that particular case, if you use \">\" you would be removing the information the \"input\" part needs to parse, since the output file would be \"overwriting it\". So in:\nrev file.txt | cat > file.txt\n\nWhat is actually happening in \"slow motion explanation\" is:\n\n\n*\n\n*rev prepares to reverse the content of file.txt and send it to pipe\n\n*While rev is sending the information to pipe, pipe streams it directly to cat.\n\n*While cat is receiving the information it will automatically apply it to the file.txt it was set with.\n\n*The keyword here is \"while\", because everything is happening at the same time. Please see the excellent comments below by Emil to have a deeper understanding on this part.\n\n*cat will not wait for rev to pipe the whole file. It will simply start the minute the first part of the information gets to it, which means, depending on what symbol you used, it will open a connection to file.txt.\n\n*In this case since you used the > instead of >>, the shell will truncate the output file which means it will open and clear the information of file.txt while waiting for the new information to get to it. With >> it would open a connection with file.txt and wait for new information on the last line detected.\n\n*Since the information was already cleared in file.txt with >, rev would try to do it's work and get nothing because cat deleted everything in preparation for the new information.\n\n\nSo why do the others work after reading the above. Because of this:\nrev file.txt | cat > file2.txt && mv file.txt file2.txt\n\nHere you are piping to cat which is sending the information to another file. In this case, the processed input file file.txt is not the same as the output file file2.txt. After that you are literally overwriting the whole file2.txt with file.txt, so all the process made by cat was deleted. Basically the whole line could be simplified like cp file.txt file2.txt because it is doing the same thing since file2.txt at the end looses the rev and is overwritten with the mv command.\nrev file.txt | cat >> file.txt\n\nIn this case you are concatenating the information to the same file. So it is only opening a connection to that file but not erasing the information as seen with a single >. The end result should be, the original information plus the reversed information.\n\nA: You can use Vim in Ex mode:\nex -sc '%!rev' -cx file.txt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*% select all lines\n\n*! run command\n\n*x save and close\n", "Q: fstrim not supported on USB flashdrive? Not sure this has already been properly sorted (but I am a noob)\nNew install of 14.04 server installed on a brand new SanDisk 16Gb USB stick mounted on the internal USB connector of a HP Proliant Microserver. Stick contains boot, root, minimal user files and swap as per default installation, LVM not installed. System basically runs fine as a headless file/media server.\nWeekly CRON job fails \nfstrim: /: FITRIM ioctl failed: Operation not supported\n\nhdparm and smartctl both show\nData Set Management TRIM supported (limit 8 blocks)\n\nbut the command fstrim -v / produces the same failure message\nfstrim: /: FITRIM ioctl failed: Operation not supported\n\nAlthough there isn't much writing to the USB stick (apart from system log files, I guess) it would be good to know just what's going on here.\n\nA: Bug 1336541 is \"No TRIM via USB\".  I guess the problems are present with internal USB ports also.  Additionally in your case, it sounds like you are using a USB flash stick, not a SSD device -- TRIM would not apply to flash.  If you device is really an SSD, do add yourself to the bug.\n\nA: Certain USB enclosures will pass the trim ioctl which is different than the info command ioctl. Just because the drive reports it supports trim, does not mean fstrim will be correctly translated, i.e. pass through the bridge in the USB enclosure to the drive itself.\nIf you have a USB enclosure with a bridge chip that passes the trim command, you're part way there. Next, you need a udev rule. Try linux # nano 50-usb-trim.rules Copy and paste this into the file ACTION==\"add|change\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"152d\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0562\", SUBSYSTEM==\"scsi_disk\", ATTR{provisioning_mode}=\"unmap\" but for the 152d and 0562 run lsusb and locate your usb enclosure, which will usually contain the word bridge\nThere are 2 4-digit hex numbers separated by a colon, in my case 152d:0562, but use the numbers from your USB enclosure, and put them in the proper places, like I did in mine.\nSave the udev rule file above, and put it in /etc/udev/rules.d After you connect the USB drive, Run sudo systemctl daemon-reload Locate the drive in /dev linux # ls /dev/sd*. If you still can't figure out which one it is, use linux # sudo fdisk -l and look at the sizes. You can probably tell from that which drive you want to trim.\nlinux # sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt but substitute tyh\n", "Q: How do I remove Evolution from indicator-message?

There is a helper program called gresource to deal with these files\n\n*\n\n*usually, it is installed alongside with the library GLib\n\n*thus it should be in the package libglib2.0-bin\n\n*and since this package is usually already installed, you'll find it in your /usr/bin and get more documentation by invoking man gresource\nIn short\n\n*\n\n*to list the contents of a *.gresource file:\n gresource list gtk.gresource\n\n\n\n*to extract a specific resource from it:\n gresource extract gtk.gresource /org/gnome/adwaita/gtk-main.css\n\nBasically, this allows you to get the contents of the original Theme extracted. You could make a conventional Theme (with discrete CSS files) from the extracted resources. The key point to note for this is that you have to change the entry point in the top level gtk-3.0/gtk.css file within your theme. In binary themes, you'll find there a URL reference\n@import url(\"resource:///org/gnome/THEMENAME/gtk-main.css\");\n\nYou need to change this reference to point to your locally installed files\n@import url(\"gtk-main.css\");\n\n\nIf you want to compile a new binary bundle from a theme you edited in discrete CSS files, see this Blog post from 2012 by Satyajit Sahoo\n\nA: $ file gtk.*\ngtk.css:       ASCII text\ngtk.gresource: GVariant Database file, version 0\n\nSo the answer is: you do not. It is software (see gvariant).\n\nso I can edit the gtk.css \n\nThat one is an ASCII file so editable with gEdit.\n\nA: You can use the folowing  script to recursively extract all files from gresource (save it to ~/bin/gextract.sh and make it executable):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# recursively extract gresource\n\nfor file in \"$@\"; do\n    gresource list \"$file\" | while read i; do\n        filepath=\"${i#/}\"\n        dirpath=\"${filepath%/*}\"\n        mkdir -p \"$dirpath\"\n        cd \"$dirpath\"\n            gresource extract \"$file\" \"$i\" > \"${i##*/}\"\n        cd - >/dev/null\n    done\ndone\n\nUsage:\ngextract.sh gtk.gresource\n\nit will create a directory tree with files (it's like unpack an archive)\n", "Q: Get Qualcomm Atheros AR93xx Wireless Network Adapter to work under Ubuntu 14.04 I'm trying to install TP-Link TL-WDN4800 Adapter with Ath9k under trusty.

I understand that a virus and malware can exists in Linux.  However, I have read a lot about how Linux is not vulnerable to viruses because of a variety of reasons.  So does that mean that I can download any file (video, audio, or text) from the net, and open in with peace of mind?\nFor example, what if I were to download an mp3 file from a shady source off the internet.  Then I open and play it with VLC player or Rythmbox.  Am I 100% safe from malware?\n\nA: Am 100% safe from malware?\nIf the question is \"Am I 100% safe from malware?\" Then the question would be marked as \"too broad\" and flagged for deletion.\nAre MP3 files safe?\nIf the question is \"Can I safely open a MP3 file downloaded from a shady source with VLC or Rhythombox\". Then the answer is:\nYes, if you have the installed the latest updates.\nMP3-Files are sound files that doesn't contain any part that will be able to direct the computer anything else to do than play their containing sound. So this is safe as long as you are running your software with the latest bug-fixes.\nIf you don't have the latest bug-fixes you might have a bug in your software that could be exploited by someone knowing about this who might try to bring your VLC or Rhythmbox to run arbitrary code on your computer.\nI can't remember that this has happened anytime with MP3 files on Linux, but theoretically it still could happen. So to be on the safe-side: allways be sure to install the latest bug-fixes.\n\nA: There are actually almost as many Linux viruses as Windows ones. The reasons why Linux is possibly less prone to viruses are:\n1. Programs are run as normal user, not Root User\n2. More eyeballs on the code, nowhere for malware to hide\n3. Vast diversity makes it difficult to reproduce flaws in a system\n4. All software and drivers are frequently updated by Package Managers\n5. Software is generally installed from vast Repositories not from unfamiliar websites \n6. Developers/programmers are recognized as Rock Gods rather than treated with contempt\n7. Elegant, secure code is admired & aspired to. Hasty kludges are an embarrassment\n\nAlthough this does not mean however that viruses cannot run on Linux, or that it is fully virus free. There are many Java viruses out there for instance which don't mind which platform you are on as long as it has a compatible JRE on it.\nThere is some interesting information on this subject here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Linuxvirus (numbered list quoted from here)\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus\n", "Q: The regular desktop is on tty7 but when i startx it goes on tty8 When I login to Lubuntu the desktop boots normally but when I do startx from boot terminal the desktop boots but my sound isn't working and it sames to be in a different desktop session. The regular desktop is on tty7 but when I startx it goes on tty8. When switch to tty7 it shows the default desktop but tty8 has a broken desktop.\n\nA: Yes your GUI is on TTY7, if you give the command startx Ubuntu starts a new graphics session, on the next available TTY, and thats TTY8, unfortunately some of the hardware (sound device) are already in use on TTY7, and the sounddevice is may not be avaliable in TTY8.

What you need is write the disk image (file with .iso extension) you installed to DVD or USB with pendrivelinux to create a bootable media.\nI highly recommend getting somebody who knows computers to assist you.\nThen you need to boot from that media (DVD or USB). Restart your computer and look at screen for info. You are looking for something like Press X key to enter boot(BIOS) setup. Hold that X key. It's usually F8, F12 or Esc in my case. There you look for change boot order or something similar. Navigate with keyboard to that option. Select the media, holding your Ubuntu installation.\nYou may try Ubuntu before installing it. Because your machine had WindowsXP, I guess it's quite old. If so, Ubuntu may be too much for it and you would see it before doing any changes to your main disk. Just check Try Ubuntu option.\nIf Ubuntu is too heavy for your machine, you may try Lubuntu - a derivative of Ubuntu which strips down on eye candy and some functionality to use much less computer resources. As a side bonus, it resembles WindowsXP.\nSteffen offered a great link to extended and detailed explanation.\n\nA: julka is right, you have to put the Ubuntu (weak systems: better lubuntu or xubuntu) installation files onto a physical drive and boot your machine from it. But instead of changing the BIOS settings, usually there is another hotkey to open a boot device selection popup (my BIOS writes for example: \"Press DEL to enter Setup, F6 for BBS Popup\"). Search for something like this immediately after switching the pc on and press it. You should now be able to select your CD/DVD device.\nBesides, do you want to have a XP/Linux dual boot system or to replace Win? For dual boot, you need free unpartitioned space on your hard disk and you have to be VERY careful not to overwrite the old XP system or damage the partitioning tables.\nAdditionally, there is something called wubi which allows you to install Ubuntu in a directory of your Windows system, but this would make it depending on the win system and be slower and maybe unstable. I can't recommend that to you, I'm just showing you the options you might think of.\n", "Q: VirtualBox: Disk in WinOS reporting ~1/3 actual space used by dynamically allocated disk I am hosting Windows 7 in VirtualBox.

The maximum size of the VDI is 200GB.\n\nA: Unfortunatly not lightly.\nWhat you can try is Clone your Windows7 and give it a smaller footprint, then when that works delete the old big one.\nIt is probably better to do an export appliance from the file menu, then create a new mashine with 50GB disk, and import the windows7 export here.\n", "Q: is it okay to torrent without an anti-virus? will it affect my windows 7 if I catch Malware? Should I worry about viruses when I torrent on Ubuntu? what can I do to prevent it? Do I need to go to such lengths? \nI don't want to torrent something and find out there is a dormant virus in there ready to strike when I boot up my Windows, or just plain and simply affect Ubuntu. \n\nA: Your Ubuntu is pretty safe from all viruses you catch.\nAs long as you don't make them, partitions do not interfere with each other, so your Windows should be safe if you don't copy infected file from  Ubuntu to Windows.\nI'm not the only one who thinks so. Moreover, you do have Windows anti-virus, don't you?\nIf you want to pass a file from Ubuntu to Windows, you can use something like VirusTotal to scan it.\nNevertheless, saying goes, better safe then sorry. Check Ubuntu wiki for a list of reasons, why linux in general is pretty safe from viruses and optional anti-virus programs.\n\nA: Simply put, you shouldn't have to worry. \nTorrenting a file is simply downloading the exact same file in small chunks from multiple sources. From the Torrent file wikipedia page\n\nIn the BitTorrent file distribution system, a torrent file is a\n  computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be\n  distributed, and usually also a list of the network locations of\n  trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system\n  find each other and form efficient distribution groups called swarms.\n\nAnd from the BitTorrent wikipedia page:\n\nBitTorrent is a protocol for the practice of peer-to-peer file sharing\n  that is used to distribute large amounts of data over the Internet.\n\nBasically, you get the .torrent file from the server. That provides your torrent client (Transmission by default in Ubuntu - you may use some else like μTorrent on Windows) with the information necessary to download the file. \nAs for what's in the .torrent file - From the BitTorrent wikipedia page:\n\nTorrent files have an \"announce\" section, which specifies the URL of\n  the tracker, and an \"info\" section, containing (suggested) names for\n  the files, their lengths, the piece length used, and a SHA-1 hash code\n  for each piece, all of which are used by clients to verify the\n  integrity of the data they receive.\n\nThat is what protects you against viruses. The only way you would get a virus is if the official ISO from Canonical/Ubuntu was infected - something very unlikely. Plus, you're simply downloading the file. You're not actually doing anything with it.\nSo, the answer to your question is that it is extremely unlikely (if not entirely impossible) that you will get a virus from torrenting the ISO. The most likely way you'd get a virus while downloading the ISO is if you use an off-brand torrent application that has a virus embedded in the installer.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 high overheating I am using a dual boot system.

It will harm my computer?\n\n\nA: I don't know about Win7 as I don't own one, but Ubuntu's Desktop Environment (=DE) \"Unity\" looks pretty nice but costs very much resources. What CPU, RAM, Graphics do you have? If they are too weak this could be the cause for the heat. Does everything run fluently or are there small \"hangs\" as if the pc is too busy? If this was the cause, you could try installing another DE such as xfce or lxde that needs less resources. Could also be that Ubuntu has different settings for power management, fan control etc., but I don't know about this.

However, I was wanting to play a few games that didn't work too well on wine, so I created a NTFS partition and installed Win 7 (UEFI) in it. \nWindows was overwriting Grub all the time, and after a tiring struggle, I decided to get rid of Windows 7. I deleted its partition, but UEFI would still try to boot into it, which produced a black error screen (\"0xc0000225 - The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible\"). \nI googled a bit, and was told that Windows 7 installs a bootloader in the first partition. Well, I booted from a live CD, and deleted that partition via GParted. Oh, boy. Apparently, that was the EFI Boot partition, and now my laptop won't boot into anything other than live/install USB drives.\nI tried boot-repair, and it told me to create an EFI partition, which I have no idea how to.\nIs this fixable? Do I have to format my entire hard drive? The Ubuntu partition is still there (according to GParted), it is just not accessible. Thanks!\n\nA: Ok, this was tiring, but I fixed it. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a partition (FAT, first one in hdd, boot flag, 200MiB) via GParted on Ubuntu 14.04 live USB.\n\n*Use ALT Linux Rescue / rEFInder live USB to boot into my Ubuntu installation (http://en.altlinux.org/Rescue).\n\n*Follow the instructions at (an error occurred while mounting /boot/efi) to fix UUIDs.\n\n*Run boot-repair (http://www.howtogeek.com/114884/how-to-repair-grub2-when-ubuntu-wont-boot/).\n\n*Reboot the PC.\n\n\nThanks for trying to help me, hopefully this will help someone else in the future.\n\nA: I have had same problem, and you try to enter tty, and enter this in terminal:\n      sudo apt-get install --force-yes shim-efi-amd64   shim-efi shim-generic \n\nand then enter this in tty:\n     grub-install \n     update-grub2 \n     grub-mkconfig \n\nand then enter this in the tty:\n     sudo apt-get update \n     sudo apt-get install - - reinstall ubuntu-desktop \n\nand then enter this in the tty:\n     sudo dpkg - - reconfigure - a \n\nand it might work fine this way.\n\nA: First of all, try to make some backups guys, if you don't know how to, search for it first. obviously i didn't, i already had made backups, months before this self-made disaster happened.

However, 1776x1000 looks perfect, but Ubuntu doesn't have a resolution of 1776x1000, only a lower one.\nI tried adding the resolution with terminal: xrandr.\nIt added the resolution, but the problem is when I switch to 1776x1000, it still looks like it is in 1920x1080, only zoomed in.\n\nA: The resolution is not only a factor of your TV (whose details you didn't specify) but also of your graphics card and your module (aka \"driver\").  So if your TV supports a 1776x1000, but your graphics card (which you didn't specify neither) doesn't, it'll just \"scale\" to the nearest solution which seems to be 1920*1080.\nOtherwise, you'll have to go down to 1280*720, which is a well-known resolution...  :-(\nLook up the exact model number of both your TV and graphics card and if both do support 1776*1000 and it still looks like crap bad, you'll have to raise a bug report for your \"driver\" and wait patiently until the developers do something about it.\nAlso: some TVs automatically \"zoom\" (aka \"overscan\") the images they receive.

addition to Disk Encryption increase security? I've encrypted my disk using the disk encryption option during installation (of Lubuntu) and also used the Home folder encryption option. I wonder whether the latter adds security or if home folder encryption is redundant since I've encrypted the disk.\n\nA: I'm going to say overkill. You incur a penalty in performance for the decryption twice, while only gaining a marginal increase in security. If an adversary is able to bypass the full disk encryption in some way, by stealing the keys from memory, using a keylogger or just beating it out of you with a wrench. Then breaking any secondary encryption is only going to take a bit more effort, because the same method can be used again.\nIf only considering Full disk encryption vs a file system encryption. Then FDE is more secure, because a filesystem encryption usually only encrypts the files, so filesystem metadata is still available (number of files, size of files, access data). Depending on the particular system used, the filenames might not be encrypted either.\n\nA: Sure it increases security, as long as you are using different passphrases for each one. \nAnd just in case one method is found to be flawed (could happen, see shellshock) or you wrote the passphrase on the case or something, there's a \"backup\" encryption.\n", "Q: How do I decide what version of Ubuntu to install? This question is here just to avoid you choosing the wrong Ubuntu version number.\nSo, this is not about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which flavour of Ubuntu to choose? \n\n*nor about choosing the Server or Desktop version... \n\n*nor Which desktop environment should I install? \n\n*nor Which Ubuntu is best for my hardware? \n\n*nor What is the difference between LTS and normal releases? \n\n*nor What is the meaning of version numbers?.\n\n\nSo in the answer below a simple guide as to what Ubuntu version is good for you, independent of future releases!\n\nA: I'll second the discussion above but flush it out a bit.  I learned something, that even-number.04 are LTS versions and the first time I heard it stated like that.\nIf you don't like messing and re-installing every 6 months the most recent LTS version is definitely the best option.  They are updated for 2 years and you don't have to touch them for 2 years.  At this moment it is 14.04.  If they work, then why mess with it.  This is what I do for my print server EeePC as well as my for my wife's Asus netbook.  My wife doesn't want want any hassle and does not push the envelope in any kind of way.  She just wants to turn it on and use Firefox, LibreOffice, and watch media.\nOn the other hand, your hardware may push your choice.  I just bought a new Lenovo Yoga Pro 2.  14.04 had several bugs for this hardware (e.g wifi didn't work) because it is so new.  These bugs were fixed with the next kernel release that came with 14.10 distro.  Even if this was my wife's computer, 14.10 was better for this particular hardware.\nThe down side is that the non-LTS versions have a short life span as they stop updating them now only about 9 months after they are released.  Therefore, you need to upgrade pretty much on the 6 months schedule.\nFor me, I love upgrading, it is sport.  Every version has advancements and a few regressions.  I have gotten good at it and can do it much faster than back in the day.  Things gradually evolve and get better and better.  An example of the improvements is the touch screen working on the Lenovo out of the box. I have been able to follow the evolution by doing regular upgrades. I do a complete fresh install every 6 months.  It also forces me to backup my data every 6 months.  The next version coming up shortly will be my 15th version.\nPay your money, take your choice.  Personally, in my household, I have 5 computers on Ubuntu.  I always use the latest version, be it LTS or not.  I choose which version by the purpose for which the computer is used as I outlined above.  For my own computer that I use every day I use the latest which is 14.10.\n\nA: There is no such difference, The only point is that the latest version is will contains the latest and up to date repositories and packages.\nMore there are also chances of bugs comes with latest version, that will be removes after users reports bugs.\nIt's your own choice. It's will be suitable, if you search around for their stable version.\n\nA: To help you choose the right version of Ubuntu, just head to the Official Ubuntu current releases site.\nIf you want the most current stable version of Ubuntu and don't like problems just start reading from the top of the list and stop when you see the first LTS (Long Term Support) version and download and install that.\nIf you're a bit of an Ubuntu hobbyist or like upgrading often (at least once/year, more if you can) just start reading from the top of the list and stop when you see the first version and download that.\nIf you're a pioneer and want to help advancing the human race just start reading from the top of the list and stop when you see the first version that says future  (Warning: you might want to install this version in dual-boot with a stable version)\nSo, please don't install \"Dapper Drake\" or \"Utopic Unicorn\"  just because their names sound cool!\n\nA: The number of the Ubuntu releases represents the date of their publication.\nFor example:\nUbuntu 14.04 has been released in April 2014\nUbuntu 13.10 has been released in October 2013 and so on. \nThe versions with code xx.04 where xx is an even number are the LTS versions. These versions are supported for longer then the others. \nPeople that want to have always the last features should instead install the most recent version.\nOn the other hand, people that want to be sure to have something stable and very well tested should choose the last LTS. LTS versions are commonly used in enterprise but also by a lot of people that do not want to update often their system. \n", "Q: What package conventions are there for ubuntu? It's hard to describe this question. Let's look at an example:\nThe package blender depends i.e. on blender-data. I looked into both packages. blender contains only the application, a .desktop file and something like that, while blender-data also contains the application icons and so on. If I download blender from the original website, I get no package but a folder with everything I need.\nWhy is there a data package for blender? Are there more of those conventions? What kind of packages are there? Where can I read more about it? I found a lot of information about how to package and internal details, but nothing about naming conventions and the reason to create *-data packages.\n\nA: To answer your question here I'll use LibreOffice as an example (as nearly everyone has that installed).  If you're on Lubuntu (which doesn't have LibreOffice as standard office productivity suite) and you install LibreOffice, it's a nearly empty package although it has package dependencies for Writer, Calc, Base, etc.\nA package dependency is just a \"pointer\" to another package.  Otherwise the servers at Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) would quickly fill up with double, triple, quadruple, ... packages that all contain the same files!  \nA package that, in itself only contains such \"pointers\" is know as a meta package.\nSo the LibreOffice meta package pulls in its separate packages (E.g. calc), which pulls in their dependencies, which pull in theirs until all dependencies are resolved.\nYou can however install only Calc  without any of the other packages.\nTo see this in action, type the following command in a terminal:\napt-cache depends libreoffice-calc\n\nAnd blender is just a very simple example of the above.  \nSome more details:\nFor some packages, things are broken into functional units: it is not uncommon to see packages called: application, application-data, application-plugins, application-dev, and some others which each contain respectively the application itself, a dataset or data to operate against, some plugins, or anything else...\nFor the full details:\nVisit the package management Development Wiki.\n\nA: In addition to Fabby's answer, there is one more point to consider: the architecture dependency of the package contents.\nFor example, the blender program itself will obviously depend on the architecture of the OS - you can only run amd64 binaries on amd64 OSes. However, a lot of data is not so dependent - the icon files, translations, programs written in languages like Python or Java, for example, can be the same for all architectures. \nThus, a first step in optimizing the package content is to split of such files in to common packages that are dependencies of the architecture specific version. The common files, typically in packages with -data have architecture all. The binary and library packages have architecture values of amd64, i386, armhf, etc.\nThis is actually one of the Packaging Best Practices recommended by Debian:\n\nIt is not uncommon to have a large amount of architecture-independent data packaged with a program. For example, audio files, a collection of icons, wallpaper patterns, or other graphic files. If the size of this data is negligible compared to the size of the rest of the package, it's probably best to keep it all in a single package.\nHowever, if the size of the data is considerable, consider splitting it out into a separate, architecture-independent package (_all.deb). By doing this, you avoid needless duplication of the same data into eleven or more .debs, one per each architecture. While this adds some extra overhead into the Packages files, it saves a lot of disk space on Debian mirrors. Separating out architecture-independent data also reduces processing time of lintian (see Section A.2, “Package lint tools”) when run over the entire Debian archive.\n\nSuch architecture-independent files often go into /usr/share - in fact, it is policy violation to have architecture-dependent files in that directory tree.\nThen a way of organizing things naturally occur:\nall\n├── doc      # man pages, documentation in other formats\n├── icons\n├── themes\n├── translations\n└── etc.\narch\n├── bin      # binaries\n├── dbg      # binaries with debug symbols\n├── lib      # shared library files\n└── lib-dev  # header files and other shared library files for development\n\n", "Q: Charging only ever reaches 95% I am using Ubuntu 14.10. And my computer is always attached to an AC power source thus it is always charging. But I have noticed that my battery says it is charged when I click on the battery icon in the top-right hand corner of my screen, although it only says this in the menu, in the section that I see all of the time it only ever says 95%. Although about half an hour ago I disconnected and reconnected the AC power source and it dropped down to 94%, and even though in the pull-down menu it says \"charged\", it still has not gone up. I would have thought that charged would be at 100%? So why is what I am describing the case?\nThis is what I mean when I am talking about the pull-down menu and the difference between the two statuses:\n\n\nA: It's a bit complicated and I don't remember all the details.  However, the percentage is only a rough calculation and it needs to calibrate to be accurate.  Don't spend a lot of time worrying that 95% is bad and 100% is good nor that 55% is a whole lot different than 45%. It calibrates using discharge charge cycles to the realities of the battery to make it's estimate.  \nTry this to get it calibrated again. Unplug your computer and let it fully discharge until it shuts off.  Then plug it in and start the computer and let it charge up fully while it is running.  Don't be afraid to try that more than once.  See if that doesn't help.\n3 years is a bit of time and new batteries are very inexpensive now-a-days.  Time how long it takes for your computer to shut off.  If the battery dies in 30 minutes you need a new one.  If it goes for a few hours, you're golden.  If it is weak, you might cycle it through a few discharge/charge cycles to see if the battery recovers. Particularly if it is NiCad batteries cycling it might help, not so much LiIon. I just ordered a new battery for my Asus 1005HA and it was $9.  Hard for an old guy to understand how they can be so cheep.\n", "Q: Internet speed greatly fluctuating, from 100kbps to 4mbps in under a second On my fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04, while torrenting Kali Linux, my internet speed fluctuates greatly. This happens on all of my devices, leading me to believe my router is dying. Can anyone help? I'm using a wired connection on some devices, and a wireless on others. How is this not linux? \n \n\nA: It's probably NOT your router dying.

There seems to be quite a few pages on how to re-partition a hard-drive without lead to loss of data. There are also pages that state that it is not possible with encrypted drives, and other stating that it is only possible using the command line utilities. I am a bit sceptical as there does not seem to be any hands on instructions how this can be done. Some guidance and links to how this can be done would be helpful.

Before using Ubuntu, I had used Fedora 20 with Bumblebee due to the support for Nvidia board, it worked without any problem. However I've tried to use Bumblebee on Ubuntu 14, but I've been getting no success until now. I've followed the steps to install Bumblebee described at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee#Installation, I can install successfully Bumblebee on Ubuntu, but it seems that nothing happens when I try running glxgears with a optirun call, the FPS I get is the same as glxgears running without optirun. I have also tried updating the NVidia's drivers, but nothing happens as well. What is going on ? I think Bumblebee should be supposed to work on Ubuntu as well as on Fedora, but I'm getting some troubles with Bumblebee on Ubuntu 14.\n\nA: Instead of messing with bumblebee, I would suggest using the nvidia-prime package. It works seemlessly to allow you to choose which GPU you want to use for your desktop session. If you use prime-indicator as well you get an indicator in your tray (on the top right) which gives you quick access to change which GPU is being used.\nBumblebee is a bit outdated now and more or a pain to set up than the benefits it grants you.\n", "Q: How to set hibernate/shutdown timers? XFCE power manager not having an effect in Lubuntu I like to fall asleep listening to internet radio or a streaming video. I would prefer to have my computer go into hibernate mode an hour after I've become inactive, not 15 minutes after.\nI would then like my computer to shut-down if I don't touch it a half-hour after that.\nBut I cannot change the hibernate or shut down settings.\nThis is an Ubuntu 14.04 OS.\nOn the Xfce Power Manager, I have the monitor at \"put display to sleep when computer is inactive for 60 minuts\" but it goes black when inactive for only 15 minutes.\nAnd \"put computer to sleep when inactive for\" is set for 1 hour 58 minutes. But it just stays on with a dark screen.\nI'm not a programmer, technology person at all.

If you are using a laptop, please note that there are different settings for battery power or plugged-in.\nAlso make sure in the \"Display\" section of Xfce Power Manager you have the Screen set to blank never.\nI do not believe you can set the computer to shutdown after a period of inactivity using Xfce Power Manager.\nI can recommend a way to schedule shutdown for a certain time everyday:\nFor a one-time shutdown, go into the terminal (press CTRL + Alt + T or open Accessories > LXTerminal) and enter this command:\nsudo shutdown -h 03:30\n\n(Replace 03:30 with your desired time in 24:00 format)\nIf you would want your computer to turn off at a certain time every day, you could enter this command in LXTerminal (press CTRL + Alt + T or open Accessories > LXTerminal):\nsudo crontab -e\n\nWhich might say it is creating a file and might offer the choice of text editor. (If you get to choose, I'd recommend \"nano\").\nIn nano, press the down button to go to the last line in the document and enter this line:\n30 3 * * * poweroff\n\nReplace 3 with the hour and 30 with the # of minutes past the hour you would like the system to shut down.

It turned out that the only .desktop file I had was the one I created myself, but the two icons kept being displayed despite my efforts to get rid of them by uncommenting the last line in the matlab.desktop file as suggested in Ubuntu Help. Yet the problem still persists and I have no idea why since on my other laptop which is also running Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS 64-bit I did get exactly one icon in dash that can work flawlessly when dragged into the launcher.

It is the missing firmware for wifi has like disappeared and no matter what I do to fix the problem it all fails. \nLaptop 1.) Dell Inspiron 1525 running Ubuntu 14.04\nLaptop 2.) Dell Latitude 610 Dual boot Vector Linux (Slackware) and Lubuntu/gnome 13.10\nLaptop 3.) HP Pavilion 1000. Ubuntu 12 something cannot be upgraded due to graphics card that is old. \nLaptop 2.)  Connects to the wifi on the Vector Linux side only.\nMy wifi is seen and is used by 2 Kindles and 1 Chromebook. \nThe three laptops running the Ubuntu all started to not connect to the wifi at nearly the same time.

However when we turn back on the next day the Kindles and the Chromebook and Vector Linux all connect. \nSo now we moved the cable modem and the router to another plug in and leave them on and I have tried to re-install the firmware,  just trying any ole' idea that come into my head.  Needless to say unless tethered to the ether net cable anything Ubuntu cannot get online.  \nPrior to this all three were running on the wifi without a hiccup,  for years.\nSo I don't know what is going on any idea on how to solve this? \n\nA: I agree that it seems there was a config change with the router. might be an ip block due to the fact you can get on with the one version of linux on the dual boot it's not a mac block. you could try checking the network config and see if it's static or dynamic (dynamic is usually what you want set up) unless you have set it to be static. \n", "Q: /etc/localtime not a link Rather fresh install of Ubuntu 14.10.

However I am having a lot of trouble reading this pdf. The issue is that the background color, which is white, is \"too much white or dark white\" and the text of the pdf is \"too much black or dark black\" , which hurts the eyes a lot.\nNow with other pdf files, what I normally do is  \n1) Configure the page color of ocular and set it to some light or medium gray shade which is comfortable \n2) Control brightness using xbacklight to further improve reading comfort\nHowever, none of these strategies work . Decreasing the brightness doesnt help because the colors ( as mentioned above) are still too dark. Changing page color for this particular pdf changes only border color of the page, and not of the entire page ; again no use.\nSo is there something which I can do ?\n(Please keep in mind that I am a noob user who doesnt knows much of command lines etc and dont want unnecessary headaches just because I edited a wrong file..etc) \nThank you.\n\nA: The problem is probably that this pdf is only a \"pdf image file\".  With your cursor can you highlight words, i.  e. the actual characters. Or does just draw a box.\nImage pdf can have poor image contrast.  Whereas if you use OCR  (optical character recognition) then each character is distinct from the background,  and Okular can set each independently; there by controlling your contrast ratio of light vs. dark. \n\nA: Beside the older setting of inverting colors (which might not work on scanned documents anyway), in newer versions of Okular (like 1.9.3) both font and page colors can be edited — and a dark-mode look can be enabled — through a new and rather non-intuitive setting, under Configure Okular - Accessibility - Color mode: Change Dark and Light Colors, by selecting a light color for dark and a dark one for light color option.\n\nThen, for easy access, configure toolbar and add Toggle change color (Icon can be manually added/edited). It works for picture/scanned pages too.\n\nThis setting is a bit odd because of the names used.\nDepending on the type of pdf, the color of the text (that is, the \"Dark Color\", meaning font color, which was set to a lighter hue) may change in part the color of the background, which thus becomes lighter than the selection under \"Light Color\" (meaning background color). This happens rather in some scanned documents, but not in all. It may be related to gray or colored backgrounds, which can be changed as said here.\nOther PDF readers that can change both font and page background color of image-based pdf files are the very minimalist Zathura (see this answer) and the full-featured Master PDF Editor (more details in this answer, even more here).\n", "Q: how to disable charging in ubuntu when battery level is above 80 percent?

But you should know that tp_smapi is for real Thinkpads only. \nNot for all Lenovo. And not even all Thinkpads are supported. See this page on Thinkwiki.org which models are supported. It doesn't mention yours there.\nFrom the same Thinkwiki.org page:\nThe the new Lenovo series have firmware that is completely different from other ThinkPad models. Neither tp_smapi nor thinkpad-acpi support these models.\nThese are consumer-grade notebooks, from the original Lenovo line. The supported Thinkpads are more of the original IBM-line of machines with a completely different design in hardware. The component that's key here is the embedded hardware controller for this unique power controlling feature. As far as I know, only the business-line of Thinkpads still feature this today.\nShort history: Lenovo bought IBM's Thinkpad line of machines in 2005, but even till today the machines between the Thinkpad T/X/W series can't be compared to the consumer-grade machines in terms of compatibility (and quality).\nBottom line: you can't do this on your device.\n", "Q: Setting up the proxy for rstudio My machine is running on Ubuntu 14.04, and I have already tried looking at Configuring R to Use an HTTP Proxy in the FAQ section of Rstudio support.\nThis is what I did till now...\nin my home directory, I created a file named .Renviron with the following contents\nhttp_proxy = http:// ip_address : port_num/\nhttp_proxy_user = username : password\n\nthen in the rstudio, I tried to install swirl package\n> install.packages(\"swirl\")\nWarning in install.packages :\n  cannot open: HTTP status was '403 Forbidden'\nWarning in install.packages :\n  cannot open: HTTP status was '403 Forbidden'\nWarning in install.packages :\n  unable to access index for repository http://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib\nInstalling package into ‘/home/dmacs/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.1’\n(as ‘lib’ is unspecified)\nWarning in install.packages :\n  cannot open: HTTP status was '403 Forbidden'\nWarning in install.packages :\n  cannot open: HTTP status was '403 Forbidden'\nWarning in install.packages :\n  unable to access index for repository http://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib\nWarning in install.packages :\n  package ‘swirl’ is not available (for R version 3.1.2)\n\nand there I see all this stuff, but I am able to access the link http://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib from my browser.\nI even tried setting up the proxy using GUI based rstudio, but I couldn't figure out where was the option to set the proxy.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Swaroop\nYou should add proxy information to your Renviron.site file that is located ‘R_HOME/etc/Renviron.site’.

Dont want to mess up anything. He doesn't have a CD to fix the MBR so I figured that a refresh would most likely fix it. Is this right?\nThanks!\nJulian\n\nA: If you have a Windows installation DVD or repair CD, you can boot to a repair command prompt and run:\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\nThis command installs the Windows bootloader. If you have a dual boot it would boot straight to Windows and you can then do what you want with the linux partitions.\nIf the Windows refresh you are talking about is the manufacturer-supplied option, then I doubt it will do anything with the bootloader. If you don't have a Windows installation DVD or repair CD, boot Windows and create a repair CD. Or a repair USB.\nAlternatively you can use lilo with it's \"Windows-style bootloader\" option from Ubuntu, which works the same as the Windows bootloader. See here for details. \n\nA: You could try and download hirensbootcd (just google it) and burn the iso file to a cd. Then boot the machine from that cd. It comes with live Linux, WinXP and msdos, each with an unbelievable number of tools. There are also tools to backup/save the mbr and to replace it e.g. with a standard one windows would work with. If you want to try this, I recommend you to first boot to the cd's mini-xp and there search for the tool I described. Sorry, but I don't remember the name.

USB mouse no longer recognized I've been using Ubuntu on a Windows dual-boot Sony Vaio VGN-CS390 laptop for more than five years now. Yesterday I made a fresh install of 14.04 LTS over 12.04 LTS. Everything worked fine, even after several shutdowns and boot-ups. Today, after booting up in Ubuntu, everything looked prime and proper, but my USB optical mouse wasn't working (it wasn't even recognized by the lsusb command). I tried a reboot.\nBut immediately after power on, before the GRUB screen or the Sony Vaio screen appeared (before any operating system was loaded), everything was slowed down by two orders of magnitude. The Sony Vaio screen appeared after 5 minutes (it should take 2 seconds), and the Grub screen, in which I selected Ubuntu, after 10 more minutes. I then waited an extra 10 minutes for the following to appear:\nGave up waiting for root device. Common problems:\n-Boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)\n    -Check rootdelay= (did the system wait long enough?)\n    -Check root= (did the system wait for the right device?)\n-Missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev\nALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/ceafd64e-e02d-403a-a558-ce5d8f748c3a does not exist.

Apparently, it has something to do with USB ports. Maybe something is wrong with the boot order, which I changed in the BIOS yesterday to \"USB-first\" in order to install Ubuntu.\nI booted my computer up again, and this time it went fast, like it had done for years. I thought the USB key that was plugged in had something to do with it. But after rebooting 10 times with slight differences (mouse plugged in, mouse plugged out, USB key in, USB key out, etc.), I noticed that what makes the difference between a slow and a fast boot is the amount of time the laptop has been turned off. It takes 30 minutes to get to the Gave up waiting for root device screen IF (at boot time) the laptop has been powered off for less than 5 minutes. If I boot the laptop when it has been turned off for over 5 minutes, it boots normally and fast, but doesn't recognize my dear USB mouse.\nSo guys and gals, where do we start?\n\nA: I own an older laptop (8 years?) with some small defects (graphics adapter for example, but it works for office, programming etc.) and I have the following problem:\nWhen it gets warm after a few minutes of normal use (warm, maybe 40°C, not hot) and I try a restart, I get a white screen instead of BIOS display followed by GRUB and finally Ubuntu. After cooling down (if I blow air into the fan, it goes faster), it reboots normally.\nAs you mentioned your error depends on the time between shutdown and reboot, I would think heat is the problem. Maybe some of your hardware also has a light crash as mine and therefore can't handle the temperature? You could maybe try if cooling down the whole machine (put it in the fridge ;D, try an external fan, open the window, run it in the garden,...? - but be aware of humidity!) decreases the break time needed for a normal boot.\nHave you tried your mouse in another machine, to verify it works there?\nGreetings and good luck, \nBC\n\nA: it does sound like the laptop is overheating. how is the fan working have you noticed if it is running more then normal or loader or if it isn't running at all? the other possibility is either the memory or processor is failing. I'd have the laptop check out and diagnosed for hardware problems.\n", "Q: Recover files from ruined Xubuntu using Windows I'm pretty new to Linux and Ubuntu. I have installed a bootable (persistent) Xubuntu on a USB stick, and it worked - I booted from it and used Xubuntu happily.\nBut now it is ruined - I'm not sure why, but the computer stopped responding a few times so I manually turned it off and disconnected the USB stick, and ever since the Xubuntu won't load (black screen, keyboard/mouse won't respond).\nI would like to do 2 things right now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy some files (a folder) I've created, to my Windows computer (in order to edit those files in Windows).\n\n*Back up my settings (configuration and customization) in order to later embed them in a different Xubuntu installation.

Personally I think you are much better off making a second liveUSB with Xubuntu to recover your files and then do the reinstall.\n\nA: A number of Windows programs will allow you to access Linux files. I've never tried getting some files off a live USB, but if the data isn't corrupted it should work. A simple program is Ext2Explore, which you don't even have to install. I would go for that. More sophisticated programs can embed themselves in Windows explorer and allow write access. But in my experience they are longer to get working.\n\nA: I would also suggest you to boot from another Linux DVD or USB stick (e.g. the one you used for installing Ubuntu). If your partitions on your live stick aren't damaged, it should be no problem rescuing the files.\nMaybe you have to log into your second rescue system as root (better: run file explorer as root, e.g. in Ubuntu: gksu nautilus), because I think otherwise you don't have full access on all of the files (second system respects file rights of the first). I'm not sure, but I experienced this on a dual boot Ubuntu/Kali machine. But you have to mount the partitions you want to explore before that under the normal account. It must be possible as root too, but this way its easier.\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Any program that use Java needs to be run under sudo?

Ideally I want to keep my build as close as possible to the one shipped in Ubuntu, as that would make it easier to get the change merged in at a later date. I'm struggling to find any guides which show how to do this - they all seem to assume you want to package new software from scratch.\n\nA: The general procedure for changing build options for an Ubuntu/Debian package goes like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the build dependencies\n\n*Download the source package\n\n*Change the appropriate files (usually debian/rules)\n\n*Build the packages\n\n*Install the packages \n\n\nThe commands involved:\nsudo apt-get build-dep graphviz\napt-get source graphviz\ncd graphviz-* # Or check the directory with ls and pick the correct version\n\nThen you can delete the configuration option from debian/rules, either using an editor, or:\nsed -i '/--without-gts/d' debian/rules\n\nThis command is specific to this instance, as there is only one match for --without-gts in debian/rules.\nThen build the package:\ndpkg-buildpackage -us -uc\n\nThis will create a bunch of packages in the parent directory. The options indicate the you don't wish to make a package for uploading to the Ubuntu repositories (and so don't want to sign them, etc.). Now you can install these packages:\nsudo dpkg -i ../*.deb # or pick out the packages manually\n\nThe build dependencies may be different from the installation dependencies, so to install all the dependencies you might need to run:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n", "Q: Error while make install xnee I did the ./configure and make with root permission but I can't make install.\noutput:\nMaking install in libxnee\nmake[1]: Entering directory '/home/alex/xnee-3.19/libxnee'\nMaking install in src\nmake[2]: Entering directory '/home/alex/xnee-3.19/libxnee/src'\nmake[2]: Nothing to be done for 'install'.\nmake[2]: Leaving directory '/home/alex/xnee-3.19/libxnee/src'\nMaking install in test\nmake[2]: Entering directory '/home/alex/xnee-3.19/libxnee/test'\nmake[3]: Entering directory '/home/alex/xnee-3.19/libxnee/test'\n /bin/mkdir -p '/usr/local/lib'\n /bin/bash ../../libtool   --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c   libtestcb.la '/usr/local/lib'\nlibtool: install: /usr/bin/install -c .libs/libtestcb.lai /usr/local/lib/libtestcb.la\nlibtool: install: /usr/bin/install -c .libs/libtestcb.a /usr/local/lib/libtestcb.a\nlibtool: install: chmod 644 /usr/local/lib/libtestcb.a\nlibtool: install: ranlib /usr/local/lib/libtestcb.a\nlibtool: finish: PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/sbin\" ldconfig -n /usr/local/lib\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nLibraries have been installed in:\n   /usr/local/lib\n\nIf you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries\nin a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and\nspecify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'\nflag during linking and do at least one of the following:\n   -

Windows is on my RAIDed SSDs, and I would like to have Ubuntu installed on a partition on my 1TB HDD. That partition (~330GB) would be fully encrypted with TrueCrypt, and I would use Ubuntu on it to run VirtualBox mainly. The other partition on the HDD would serve as storage only.\nAbout the File Systems, better go with ext3, ext4, XFS, another one? I'd want Ubuntu to be bootable obviously.\n And also, would that be okay if the Ubuntu partition was ext3/ext4/XFS/something else (and fully encrypted) and if at the same time the other partition on the same HDD ( for storage ) was NTFS?\nFor a start, should I first install Ubuntu and then encrypt, or first encrypt the partition and then install Ubuntu?\n\nA: Short answer: stick to the default of ext4, unless you know why you want something different. The Ubuntu installer offers the option to encrypt your partition for you using LUKS, however if you wish to use TrueCrypt then you should encrypt the partition before you install! Note that TrueCrypt is no longer being developed and it is uncertain if it is still safe. TrueCrypt has been forked under the name of VeraCrypt. Ubuntu can read NTFS so that should be fine. Windows however can't read ext4 without third party drivers and therefore can't read your Ubuntu partition.\n\nA: So, you have windows running in a virtual box inside ubuntu, did I get that right?\nIf yes I think its not the most secure way!\nHaving a \"normal\" dual boot should be more secure, as you have always just one encrypted volume decrypted!\nMeaning:\nIf you have your encrypted ubuntu booted and then start Windows in the VirtualBox, you have both encryption phrases temporarily in your RAM at the same time. Normally a naughty Windows virus/trojan etc should not be able to access you Ubuntu outside the VirtualBox, but I guess it's still saver to just have a normal dual boot. Besides having just the encryption passphrases loaded you need atm you will also have great speed benefits in Windows!\nVeraCrypt fully supports this, there are some tutorials on the net, or just ask if there are problems. \nPS: This is just a personal view and might be total wrong.\n", "Q: Prevent Shutter Moving Worskspace I mapped the shutter --active command to alt-print screen for taking screenshots of my active window. Unfortunately, if Shutter is already open in another workspace instead of minimized, then Shutter will not take the screenshot until after it has started moving me to the workspace that the shutter window is open in. The only way to workaround this is to make sure shutter is minimized before trying to take the screenshot. This will result in shutter opening in your current workspace which is annoying for those of us who like to keep our workspaces organized.\nIs there a way to have shutter take the screenshot without changing my view to the workspace shutter is currently open within? I have already tried disabling \"auto hide main window...\" and \"present main window after taking a screenshot\" inside behavior settings.\nYoutube video of issue.\n\nA: If you really want or need to use Shutter, you can simply use the workaround below:\nYou can automatically have Shutter gracefully closed (not killed) before taking a screenshot, thus preventing the move to another viewport. Since it is gracefully closed, there is no risk of losing images; they are saved automatically.\nAfter the screenshot, Shutter will be running so you will not notice the difference.\nTo make it work you have to map the command below to the key combination, instead of running shutter --active directly from the key combination:\nkill -s TERM $( pgrep shutter );shutter --active\n\n", "Q: Cinnamon hangs immediately after startup: no interaction with panel and popup notifications Problem summary: I installed Cinnamon and after a few restarts and configuration changes the panel does not respond anymore, same for the notification pop-ups. Seems like the desktop got the keyboard/mouse focus, as right-clicking opens the pop-up from the desktop.\nI have Ubuntu 14.10 32bit on an older laptop (Intel Core 2 T7200 @ 2Ghz x 2, 2GB RAM, nVidia GeForce Go 7400 (partially defect)) and installed Cinnamon a few days ago.\nFirst it worked fine and I started messing around with its settings. After a restart the panel did not response anymore. No hovering, no click-actions, right-clicking shows the desktop's popup-menu. I also see the notification popup for running in software rendering mode which is ok because of my lightly fried graphics card, but it also doesn't respond on clicks (it should close, but it remains above all other windows). I can launch apps by typing Alt+F2 or using desktop symbols, they run well and even appear in the panel.\nI already tried uninstalling, resetting with gsettings reset-recursively org.cinnamon, reinstalling etc. but it always hangs directly after logon. \nI remember having activated the CPU Frequency Tool (don' know the name) and System Load Indicator 0.4 (indicator-multiload) before the error occured. Could one of these have created the error? I read Cinnamon is incompatible with Compiz - does one of these use this? I already deactivated them as autostart, but no success.\nWhat might be the cause of this bug? How can I fix this?\nThank you for your ideas!\n\nA: This is more of a \"workaround\" then a \"solution\"...\nAs your user profile has some problem somewhere, it's just better to leave it behind!\nDo the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo adduser newuser\n\n*Add the user to the right groups (Below are the standard groups for an admin user.

I have some applications that need to run on my laptop all the time. \nI use a bash script to start these applications. In my script I have a loop that looks similar to this:  \nwhile true;\ndo\n    xterm\ndone\n\nThis runs an application (xterm in this case) and if the application crashes, the loop starts it again.  \nThis has a disadvantage that there is no \"clean\" exit from this loop. So even if the intention of the user is to close xterm, the loop starts it again.  \nIs there a way to start an application from bash script, watch whether it is running, to re-run it if script crashed or do nothing if the user closed it properly ?\n\nA: In the while condition you can test whether exit status of xterm was successful or not with something like this:\nresult=1\nwhile [ $result -ne 0 ]; do\n    xterm\n    result=$?\ndone\n\n$? variable holds exit status of last executed command.\n\nA: Try this:\nwhile true; do xterm && break; done\n\nApplications have exit status codes so that if something exits fine it returns zero... And if something went wrong, it throws out another number. This allows people to hook in and find out the exact issue. This is what the other answer is doing.\n&& just checks that the previous command was a zero-status exit and if it was, breaks the loop. If it crashes, it'll throw out something other than 0 and the && ... clause won't trigger; it'll simply loop back around and run xterm.\n\nA: I will suggest you to use.\nuntil xterm ;  do  echo \"program ended with status $?\" ; done\n\nThis will re-run your program if it is killed.\n\nA: Try use supervisor it very simple and easy to add program or script to run. In you case as minimal you need command and maybe exitcodes in programx-section to configure. \nDefault exitcodes is 0,2 so it means:\n\nsupervisord will restart the process if it exits with an exit code that is not defined in this list\n\nIn general it`s that you want: re-run it if script crashed or do nothing if the user closed it properly(or script completed successfuly) \ntry the simplest configuration first:\n[program:you_app_name]\ncommand=/path/to/you/app\n\nTo more flexibility see configuration File documentation.\n", "Q: rsyslog not separating for facilities I will preface this with, I am a Linux newbie. I had set up a Debian Linux rsyslog server that was working, but I had to switch to Ubuntu(14.04.1 LTS) to set up rsyslog(7.4.4). I was hoping that I would be able to just copy the parts of the config over and it would work. That has not been the case.\nMy syslog is receiving the information, however it is just writing to the default file /var/log/syslog.\nHere is my current config, I have edited out the items that were commented out: \n$ModLoad imuxsock # provides support for local system logging\n$ModLoad imklog   # provides kernel logging support\n\n$ModLoad imudp\n$UDPServerRun 514\n\n$ModLoad imtcp\n$InputTCPServerRun 514\n\n$ActionFileDefaultTemplate RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat\n\n$RepeatedMsgReduction on\n\n$FileOwner syslog\n$FileGroup adm\n$FileCreateMode 0640\n$DirCreateMode 0755\n$Umask 0022\n$PrivDropToUser syslog\n$PrivDropToGroup syslog\n\n#this was a template given to me that had worked in debian\n$template Firewall,\"/var/log/prd/fwlog-%$YEAR%-%$MONTH%-%$DAY%\"\n$template Switch,\"/var/log/prd/rslog-%$YEAR%-%$MONTH%-%$DAY%\"\n\nLocal7.* -?Firewall\nLocal4.* -?Switch\n\nIs there some things that differ for rsyslog in Ubuntu vs. Debian?\n\nA: The configuration files differ dramatically (and annoyingly) between versions.  So trying to copy your /etc/rsyslog.conf file from one system to another probably won't work, especially if you're switching major releases.  (In this case from version 5 to version 7.)\nUbuntu IS Debian under the hood, and rsyslog is rsyslog regardless of the OS it's installed on.  The important point is to make sure you google for instructions specific to your version, or use your package manager to install the accompanying rsyslog-docs package, then read those.  In ubuntu/debian:\napt-get install rsyslog-docs\n\n", "Q: network manager not working I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.1 server. Recently, I installed Ubuntu desktop for it; before that it had automatically gained an IP address through DHCP. After installing Ubuntu desktop, I have provided an IP address as static but it is not obtaining that IP address. Instead, it is showing the DHCP address. When I check connection information, it is showing me the error message, \"Error displaying connection information, no valid active connection found.\" I tried with ifconfig command but it shows the IP address as gained by DHCP but not the static one which I gave so I can browse the internet. I need to provide a static IP address. I have uploaded the error image. Please help me.\n\n\n\n\nA: If you have your interface configured in /etc/network/interfaces, remove it. NetworkManager won't manage static ip's configured there.\nThen restart network-manager.\n\nA: Check your network configuration files are same or not. These files are default configuration of Ubuntu.\nOpen Terminal and type these commands:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nNow edit the file:\nauto lo eth0\niface lo inet loopback\ninface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nNow save that file.\nAfter this step you have to open another file via terminal.\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\ndns=dnsmasq\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nAfter doing this editing job. Run this final command :\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nAnd then restart your Ubuntu.\n\nA: If when using static IP addresses you are getting a problem with name resolution, you will have to specifiy specific dns (domain name servers) in order to translate URLs to IP addresses. \nsudo ifconfig <interface> down\nsudo dhclient -r <interface>\nsudo ifconfig <interface> 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up\nsudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1\nsudo iwconfig <interface> essid \"ESSID_IN_QUOTES\"\nsudo iwconfig <interface> mode Managed\nUnfortunately there is not an easy way to configure this from the command line. This requires that you edit the /etc/resolv.conf file and manually enter the domain name server(s) you want to use. In many cases users can specifiy their router, their internet service providers dns servers, or use opendns (or use all three). Up to three nameservers can be specified.\nsudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf\nand add the nameservers you want to use, one to a line, in the following format.\nnameserver <nameserver>\nusing this technique with static IP addresses, network manager has to be uninstalled because it keeps trying to reset the connection.

On Ubuntu 14.04 after installing nsca package, I cannot start the service because of this error (retrieved from syslog):\nnagios nsca[621]: Cannot write to pidfile '/var/run/nsca.pid' - check your privileges.\n\n\nA: It is not an elegant solution from the system point of view. But it is a simple, secure, fast method. It uses upstart config, instead of \"deprecated\" init.d script.\nSince Ubuntu 14.04 you must override default startup settings for nsca daemon. This is because the /etc/init.d/nsca script cannot create a pid file in /run. Since 14.04 release this directory is writable only by root. Therefore we can create a separate init config file for starting up nsca server.\nCreate an init startup script, in /etc/init/nsca.conf:\n#!upstart\ndescription \"NSCA Nagios Server\"\n\nenv DAEMON=/usr/sbin/nsca\nenv USER=nagios\nenv PIDFILE=/var/run/nsca.pid\nenv CONF=/etc/nsca.cfg\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on shutdown\n\nrespawn\nexpect fork\n\n# log by default - syslog\nexec start-stop-daemon --start --exec $DAEMON --make-pidfile --pidfile $PIDFILE --chuid $USER -- -c $CONF\n\nRemove links for starting up:\nupdate-rc.d -f nsca remove\n\nRemove old startup script.\nrm /etc/init.d/nsca\n\nCreate symlink for working autocomplete:\nln -s /lib/init/upstart-job /etc/init.d/nsca\n\nReload init:\nsudo initctl reload-configuration\n\n\nA: I had to remove \n--make-pidfile\n\nfrom Vladimir's answer to get this running properly as the nsca server itself already creates a pid file. Also make sure that you have the same values in \n/etc/nsca.cfg\n\nWhat helped a lot is to enable logging of the nagios server. I used this  guide to enable it.\n", "Q: USB Mouse and Keyboard stop working unexpectedly On my laptop I've attached USB mouse and keyboard. They work well when I start the computer. The problem is that after some time they stop working. Laptop's touchpad and keyboard have no problems but the other devices work normally only after restart of the laptop. If I unplug USB mouse and keyboard and plug them in again nothing happens. The other USB Devices work properly.   \nIs there a way to fix this problem permanently or a way to fix it every time when it occurs without restarting?\n\nA: My experience, for what it is worth.\nI had a similar problem with a Dell e6420 laptop, purchased used with Windows 7, and Ubuntu 14.04 added after the fact by me. The touchpad was turned off, and a Logitech wireless mouse with 'Unifying receiver' used. The primary application is as a Minecraft gaming machine.\nAfter apparently random periods of time these symptoms would appear: the mouse pointer would move, but the mouse buttons and keyboard enter key would stop working. The only consistent work-around I found was a power reset. The quite extensive embedded Dell diagnostics reported no hardware issues.\nI noticed that these symptoms primarily occurred with a userid set up with restrictive permissions, and configured to auto-login on boot. Using the \"Users and Groups\" administrative application (sudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools) I selected the offending account, hit the \"Advanced\" button, selected the \"Permissions\" tab and ensured that all check boxes were ticked (In my case, I added ticks to the only three that were not previously selected: tape drives, floppy drives and send and receive faxes. To my mind, the three have no apparent link to mice or keyboards). \nWith this as the only change, after a reboot the symptoms disappeared. \n\nA: it's because battery save. it's better to install tlp\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2014/03/tlp-05-released-install-it-in-ubuntu.html\n", "Q: Is uninstalling via software center the equivalent of \"apt-get purge\"? Is uninstalling via software center the equivalent of apt-get purge?\nOr perhaps it is apt-get remove?\n\nA: It is equivalent to apt-get remove. purge removes configuration files, etc., which the Software Centre does not.\n", "Q: How can I update only the flash player for chromium when I have set the 'Automatically check for updates' as 'Never' ? I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 today. I have installed only Chromium browser at it. As I don't want the different softwares in my operating system to get updated(as I want save my bandwidth), how can I update only the flash player of Chromium browser(to play songs on my browser online) ? \nDoes the 'Update Automatically' works for all the softwares of the Ubuntu or only for the Ubuntu operating system ?\nI remember that, in order to save my bandwidth in Windows 7, I used to disable-update the operating system and different softwares explicitly. There was no option to disable-update the Google Chrome browser and I wanted just that browser to get updated(for better view of the webpages).\n\nA: Which version of flash are you using ?\ndpkg -l|grep flashplugin\n\nIt could be (1) flashplugin-installer or (2) pepperflashplugin-nonfree\nFor (1) run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --reinstall flashplugin-installer\n\nFor (2) run:\nsudo /usr/sbin/update-pepperflashplugin-nonfree --install\n\nNote:\nIf you're using (1), I suggest you switch to (2) because it is the latest flash version; run:\nsudo apt-get purge flashplugin-installer && sudo apt-get install pepperflashplugin-nonfree && sudo /usr/sbin/update-pepperflashplugin-nonfree --install\n\n\nA: You can use the following command to update the chromium browser in a cli(terminal):\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\nthe apt-get install command updates the package to the latest available if a package is already installed.\nAs far as I know the flash player of chrome/chromium is built in and can't be updated separately. \n\nA: A word of warning: disabling security updates for system and applications is not good idea.\nChrome/Chromium browser currently uses PepperFlash build of flash player (specially modified version of Adobe Flash player). The difference between the browser builds is, besides other, that Chrome has PepperFlash build in, but Chromium get it via package pepperflashplugin-nonfree.\nTo disable all updates and keep the browser only (with flash) possible way is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Chrome instead of Chromium ( https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)\n\n*Open \"Software & Updates\" app, select \"Other Software\" tab and clear all checkboxes except the Google Chrome one (http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main)\n\n*Enable automatic updates\n\n\nA: In order to install flashplayer in Chromium you can follow the below:\nThese instructions are copied from the Ubuntu wiki\nStep 1, Check to ensure the Multiverse software repository is enabled\nFirst, one must ensure the Multiverse software repository is enabled. Launch the Ubuntu Software center app if it isn't already running.\n\nClick Edit and then Software Sources. Under \"Ubuntu Software\" tab, mark the \"Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)\" box and close. You will probably need to type your password to do this system-level change. \n\nAfter you turn on this new repository, the system will scan it to learn of new packages. Wait until the progress spinner goes quiet. It may take a minute or two on a slow internet connection. \nStep 2, install pepperflashplugin-nonfree\nNext, you can simply start the Ubuntu Software Center and get the Pepper Flash Player - browser plugin. The package name pepperflashplugin-nonfree has \"nonfree\" in the name because it refers to its ownership by Adobe Systems and free-speech qualities, not that it costs money. The browser may ask your permission to run \"xdg-open\" to launch Ubuntu Software Center.\nStep 3, run installer\nThis part may be intimidating because it's unfamiliar, but there's not really any magic here. You're going to run Terminal, paste a command to run, and wait for it to finish before closing the Terminal.\nSo, tap the Super/Windows button or click the Ubuntu symbol in the upper left and start typing \"Terminal\", and click on \"Terminal\" when it appears. \nA terminal will appear with your computer name and a blinking cursor. Take a look at it, so you know what it looks like when your computer is not doing anything except waiting for your command. In it, paste sudo update-pepperflashplugin-nonfree and press Enter. That will run a while. \nWhen it's finished, you'll see that computer name and blinking cursor again. Type exit and hit Enter, to quit. You're done! Go enjoy your new flash player. Now close Chromium and start it again.\nNote\n\nYou'll need to restart your browser for the new plugin to take effect. \n\n", "Q: How do you get to the root directory that I need to delete a file in? I need to get into the root directory to delete a file. How do I get there?\n\nA: This will get you to the root from command line: \ncd /\n\nIf you are using ftp it might go to the root of your ftp (not per definition the root of your system).\nI would be careful if I was you: in general nobody creates files in \"/\".  Removing needs to be done with sudo in front of the rm and you need to be using an admin account.\n\nA: From a cli/terminal you can use the sudo command to assume root privileges, which you need to delete stuff from your root directory. If you're unfamiliar with cli commands you issue the command gksudo nautilus to open the file browser with root privileges. Do be carefull when deleting stuff in the root directory or you might break your system.\n\nA: Assuming you are using the graphic desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*click on the icon top left to open a \"search\" bar. Type \"term\" -\nshort for terminal.\n\n*Once the terminal window opens enter cd / (as\nmentioned above)\n\n\nTo delete files I would suggest using\nrm -i /yourfilename /your/file/name\n\nso that you can preview what is getting deleted - especially when using a wildcard (* and/or ?)\n", "Q: How to fully remove VLC Player? I installed VLC player, but now I want to be fully rid of it, so I typed in the following command in Terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge vlc\n\nAnd it told me that it had purged it, but then in Terminal when I typed in vlc, this was the output (although no GUI launched):\nVLC media player 2.2.0-pre2 Weatherwax (revision 2.2.0-pre1-15-g5178b24)\n[0000000001f3bab8] core interface error: no suitable interface module\n[0000000001f21118] core libvlc error: interface \"globalhotkeys,none\" initialization failed\n[0000000001f21118] core libvlc: Running vlc with the default interface.

Type 'help' for help.\n> \n\nAnd if I type in help I get a proper response from the program. And it also allows me to type in and execute any associated command.\nSo how can I fully remove VLC Player so that when I execute the command vlc it tells me that it does not know that command?\nI am currently running Ubuntu 14.10.\n\nA: To remove a package and all its dependencies in one command, you can also directly pass the package name as argument to apt-get autoremove:\nsudo apt-get autoremove vlc\n\nIf you prefer to purge the packages (to also clean up all configuration files), the way to go is this:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge vlc\n\nHowever, this will not work in your case, because of the complex dependency tree of vlc. autoremove only removes automatically packages which currently have no installed reverse-dependencies. That means as long as there are other packages which may depend on vlc's dependencies, they will stay. Those other packages are probably vlc-plugin-* packages which depend on vlc but get not removed with that first run yet...\nHowever, if you keep firing sudo apt-get autoremove after that first line, apt-get should slowly start to realize that there's more to remove.\n\nA: Try to run these commands.\nsudo apt-get remove vlc\nsudo apt-get remove browser-plugin-vlc\n\nsudo apt-get purge vlc\n\n\nA: Use aptitude, a sometimes more intelligent alternative to apt-get.\nIf you run sudo aptitude remove vlc, it will detect possible conflicts that would result of removing vlc and suggests to remove all those other \"hidden\" dependencies which apt-get would have missed on the first run.\nIf you haven't installed aptitude yet, that can be done using sudo apt-get install aptitude.\n\nA: vlc depends on vlc-nox which installs the vlc command that you see. Remove it specifically, or use autoremove:\napt-get autoremove\n# or\napt-get remove vlc-nox\n\n\nA: None of the above will actually remove all vlc packages, (usually 6-7). Better to do - \nsudo apt-get purge vlc-data\n", "Q: Lightweight C/C++ editor with code completion and debugging Ever since the debugger plugin for geany stopped working (see below), I am looking for an editor for C/C++ source files with the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Code completion (i.e., Intellisense-like completion of variable and function names as well as parameters)\n\n*Basic debugging capabilities (start/stop debugger, step-by-step execution, evaluate variable values on mouse hover or in a separate window)\n\n\nThe editor should be as lightweight as possible. Eclipse, for example, has some nice features but it just too large in terms of disk space after installation. In case it is relevant, I am using Xubuntu (14.04) on one machine and an Ubuntu (14.04) Minimal installation with Xfce on another machine, for both of which I need a lightweight editor.\nSo far, I tried Code::Blocks, which is nice, but requires me to create a new project to enable debugging functionality, which is annoying. I just want to use my custom Makefile and my C files without any additional project files or output folders.\nI previously used geany, which I really liked. However, since I set up my 14.04 machines, the debugger plugin crashes the whole application every time I want to use it. I even tried compiling the newest version of the plugin myself, but it still crashes, as confirmed also by others in the bug tracker. Furthermore, C++ code completion in geany has never been really good.\nAre there any alternatives out there, preferably free and available via apt-get?\nThanks in advance\nBest regards\nAndreas\n\nA: You could give a try to the default text editor, GEdit (it looks pretty decent on Xfce with a gtk theme).

I wanted to play a bit with a grep command using regular expressions and found out that they behave differently from what I expected. For example, consider a file temp with the following content\nhelloworld \nhello_world\nhello world\nhello how are you world\nhello wor   ld\nhello_*_..world \nhelloEworld\n\nwhen I run\ngrep 'hello.*world' temp\n\nit returns\nhelloworld \nhello_world\nhello world\nhello how are you world\nhello_*_..world \nhelloEworld\n\nas expected. But when I run \ngrep 'hello.+world' temp\n\nit returns nothing... Though when I add \\ before +\ngrep 'hello.\\+world' temp\n\nit returns the correct output\nhello_world\nhello world\nhello how are you world\nhello_*_..world \nhelloEworld\n\nwhile adding \\  before * in the previous command and running\ngrep 'hello.\\*world' temp\n\nreturns nothing...\nWhy doesn't the grep 'hello.+world' temp command work without the \\?\nWhy is it exactly the opposite for *?\nWhen should I use \\?\n\nA: There are various classes of regular expressions that GNU grep supports:\n\n\n*\n\n*Basic Regular Expressions (BRE) - the default. Doesn't support + directly, but does support *. You can make + make sense when you escape it \\+. From GNU grep documentation:\nIn basic regular expressions the meta-characters ‘?’, ‘+’, ‘{’, ‘|’,\n‘(’, and ‘)’ lose their special meaning; instead use the backslashed\nversions ‘\\?’, ‘\\+’, ‘\\{’, ‘\\|’, ‘\\(’, and ‘\\)’.\n\n\n*Extended Regular Expressions (ERE) - the option -E enables this. Supports both + and * directly.\n\n*Perl-compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) - the -P option enables PCRE. Supports syntax similar to Perl's, such as lookaheads and lookbehinds.\n\n\nBRE and ERE are usually POSIX-defined standard classes, so you should find them on any grep which aspires to POSIX compatibility, and expect to behave similarly.\n", "Q: Reinstallation of GRUB fails I have installed W7 as a second OS with dual boot on my notebook which was already running Ubuntu 14.10. \nW7 was installed on the HDD.

Please open a terminal then type (or copy-paste) the following command:\n sudo chroot \"/mnt/boot-sav/sdb2\" apt-get -f install\n\nBut when I run this command I get:\n  debconf: Perl may be unconfigured (Can't locate strict.pm in @INC (you may need to install the strict module) (@INC contains: /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.20.1 /usr/local/share/perl/5.20.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl5/5.20 /usr/share/perl5 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.20 /usr/share/perl/5.20 /usr/local/lib/site_perl .) at (eval 1) line 2.\n  BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 1) line 2.\n ) -- aborting\n E: Can not write log (Is /dev/pts mounted?) - posix_openpt (2: No such file or directory)\n Setting up install-info (5.2.0.dfsg.1-4) ...\n Not a directory: /usr/share/info.\n dpkg: error processing package install-info (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\n Errors were encountered while processing:\n install-info\n E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI tried to run sudo apt-get install -f and sudo apt-get autoremove but didn't help...\nHere some additional infos of the disk/partitions:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo parted -l\nModel: ATA WDC WD10JPVX-08J (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 1000GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B\nPartition Table: msdos\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End     Size   Type     File system  Flags\n 1      1049kB  106MB   105MB  primary  ntfs         boot\n 2      106MB   253GB   253GB  primary  ntfs\n 3      253GB   777GB   525GB  primary  ext4\n 4      777GB   1000GB  223GB  primary  ext4\n\n\n Model: ATA LITEONIT LSS-16L (scsi)\n Disk /dev/sdb: 16.0GB\n Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\n Partition Table: msdos\n Disk Flags: \n\n Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags\n  2      1049kB  16.0GB  16.0GB  primary  ext4         boot\n\n\n Model: MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ8C2 (scsi)\n Disk /dev/sr0: 4700MB\n Sector size (logical/physical): 2048B/2048B\n Partition Table: mac\n Disk Flags: \n\n Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name   Flags\n  1      2048B   6143B   4096B                Apple\n  2      1152MB  1155MB  2327kB               EFI\n\nAnd\n Disk /dev/loop0: 1 GiB, 1115594752 bytes, 2178896 sectors\n Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n Disk /dev/sda: 931.5 GiB, 1000204886016 bytes, 1953525168 sectors\n Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\n I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\n Disklabel type: dos\n Disk identifier: 0x00098003\n\n Device     Boot      Start        End    Sectors   Size Id Type\n /dev/sda1  *          2048     206847     204800   100M  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n /dev/sda2           206848  493502463  493295616 235.2G  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n /dev/sda3        493502464 1518438399 1024935936 488.7G 83 Linux\n /dev/sda4       1518438400 1953523711  435085312 207.5G 83 Linux\n\n Disk /dev/sdb: 14.9 GiB, 16013942784 bytes, 31277232 sectors\n Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n Disklabel type: dos\n Disk identifier: 0x38b890f8\n\n Device     Boot Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type\n /dev/sdb2  *     2048 31277055 31275008 14.9G 83 Linux\n\nand\n ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo blkid\n /dev/sda1: LABEL=\"System Reserved\" UUID=\"F878F91778F8D57A\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"    PARTUUID=\"00098003-01\" \n /dev/sda2: UUID=\"8AB0009CB00090BD\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" PARTUUID=\"00098003-02\" \n /dev/sda3: UUID=\"5eede873-4ba1-4979-8cd3-91954305dd24\" TYPE=\"ext4\" PARTUUID=\"00098003-03\" \n /dev/sda4: UUID=\"22edd7a2-9794-4192-be60-8d595047f72d\" TYPE=\"ext4\" PARTUUID=\"00098003-04\" \n /dev/sdb2: UUID=\"0cd95271-f784-4e78-94aa-ebd8d80a3e52\" TYPE=\"ext4\" PARTUUID=\"38b890f8-02\" \n /dev/sr0: UUID=\"2014-10-22-19-43-11-00\" LABEL=\"Ubuntu 14.10 amd64\" TYPE=\"iso9660\" PTUUID=\"4a022e4f\" PTTYPE=\"dos\" \n /dev/loop0: TYPE=\"squashfs\" \n\n\nA: Ok I finally found a solution:\nSince the /home, /usr/share and the rest are on different partitions I needed to mount everything correctly:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/usr/share\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/home\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run ;

I've went through the LightDM documentation and saw a related question, but I still can't make it work (I tried to switch both to xmonad and i3).\nIn my /usr/share/xsessions/ I see the desktop files (for both i3 and xmonad), and I created a file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-i3.conf with the following content:\n[SeatDefaults]\nuser-session=i3\n\nStill, after rebooting I don't get i3 (same goes for xmonad). I'm not sure how to debug this problem.\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nA: The SeatDefaults section, as expected, set the default values. However, once a user has already logged, the session they used (even if it was the default left unchanged) is taken as their session choice. So changes to SeatDefaults no longer apply to them. They'll have to manually select the session from the menu next to their username (usually a gear icon).\n", "Q: Ubuntu themes directory I downloaded a few themes from various ppa's, and i don't like the button for closing, minimalizing etc. Are those themes stored in some kind of directory where i can edit their files? I'm using Unity Tweak Tool for applying them. Thank you!\n\nA: Default themes directory is /usr/share/themes/ but it's editable only for root.

Using the AnyConnect client, I have had no problems, while OpenConnect gives me strange connection issues (but only with some programs).\nI suspect the problems are caused by the fact that the VPN provider does not support IPv6. Connecting to http://whatismyipv6.com using the AnyConnect client, an IPv4 address is displayed, while using OpenConnect, my (non-VPN!) IPv6 address is shown. The AnyConnect client seems to force all connections through the VPN, even if IPv6 is unavailable. The following is a screenshot of the Statistics -> Details page in the AnyConnect client:\n\nHow can I achieve the same using OpenConnect? In Network Manager, under \"Edit connection\", there is an \"IPv6 settings\" tab, but the only relevant setting seems to be \"Method\" with the options \"Ignore\", \"Automatic (VPN)\" and \"Automatic (VPN) addresses only\" – I don't know what the difference between them is, but none of them seem to do what I want. Is the --disable-ipv6 flag that can be given to openconnect related? How would one use that in Network Manager?\nNote: I have seen this question about disabling IPv6 with OpenVPN, but the answer given there is unsatisfactory – I don't want to manually and globally enable/disable IPv6 every time I connect to or disconnect from the VPN.\n\nA: Default Route\nYou'll need to change your default route.\nIf you type route in a terminal, you'll see where packets will be sent, based upon their destination address.  By default, your VPN will only set up a route to route traffic on a specific subnet over the VPN.  You can set this gateway to be your default gateway, if that's what you want to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.254 eth0\nBe sure to change the 192.168.1.254 with whatever IP your gateway is for your VPN.\nOpenConnect Routing\nOpenConnect, by default, forces you to set up your own routes.  You can change this behavior by installing vpnc vpnc-scripts and adding the following to your openconnect command:\n\n\n*\n\n*--script=/etc/vpnc/vpnc-script\nNote:\nI prefer using OpenConnect vs AnyConnect.\n"]
