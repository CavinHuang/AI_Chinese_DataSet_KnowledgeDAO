When using Safari from iPhone/iPad I can scroll back to the top of the page in one touch by touching the upper bar of the device. Is there any similar trick for scrolling to the bottom of the page? Is there any way of scrolling down fast?\n\nA: There is no keypress or gesture to do this unfortunately.\nBut here is a quick way to achieve a similar thing.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new bookmark in safari (of any web page)\n\n*Edit this bookmark (press edit in bookmark screen)\n\n*Rename the bookmark to End\n\n*In the address field cut and paste this text \njavascript:scroll(0,document.getElementsByTagName( 'body')%5B0%5D.scrollHeight);\n\nOnce you save this bookmark, you will be able to hit the bookmark button, select End and it will take you to the bottom of the web page.  I know it's not as simple as the current scroll to top feature (this solution requires two taps), but its really the only option at the moment.\n\nA: If you are willing to jailbreak, the application Action Menu has a Scroll feature which can scroll both to the top and bottom.\n\nA: Adding to the answer by @RobZolkos, this more readable script will work in newer versions of iOS. In Rob's Step 4, you can substitute the text:\njavascript:scroll(0,document.body.scrollHeight);\n\nThe source claims this works in iOS 8 and newer. It worked for me under iOS 9.\n\nA: If you use an external keyboard, ⌘ cmd ↓ will scroll to the bottom of the page, and ⌥ opt ↓ will scroll one page down.\n", "Q: Third monitor on a 2008 iMac I currently have a 20-inch Early 2008 iMac (iMac8,1), with the iMac display and an external LG display. The graphics chip is an ATI Radeon HD 2400, which, as far as I can tell from the specs, only supports two monitors. Short of getting a new computer (which appears as if it would support three monitors), what are my options for getting a third display to work?\n\nA: You can purchase a USB to DVI adaptor.  There are heaps of them on the market\neg http://www.gefen.com/kvm/dproduct.jsp?prod_id=8863\nThis will allow you to keep your existing setup and power another monitor from the USB port.\nJust make sure that you purchase one that is Mac compatible as a lot of them on th market are not.\n\nA: I use a Matrox DualHead2Go (http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/gxm/dh2go/) to drive two external monitors from my iMac (roughly the same vintage as yours, I think).  It works really well.  \nThe Matrox PowerDesk software that comes with it lets both the Mac and Windows running under Parallels treat them as two separate monitors, even though they're really configured as one big virtual monitor.  No such luck with Linux running under Parallels, though.\n\nA: You can use thunderbolt to hdmi or thunderbolt to vga cable to connect the other monitor.\n", "Q: What do I save to ensure successful downgrade to iOS 4.1 on iPhone 3G? I'll do the upgrade from ios 4.1 jailbreaked (on an iphone 3g with a foreign locked sim) without updating the baseband.\nMy baseband is 05.14.02 (bootloader 5.9).\nSo I should to obtain an iphone 3g ios 4.2.1 jailbreaked with the 05.14.02 baseband (I'm not interested to use it for phone calls).\nI would to know what I have to save before the upgrade to revert to the original state (ios 4.1 jailbreaked) in case of failure.\n\nA: You need to save the SHSH blobs for your phone.\nThis can be done by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allowing Cydia to save them for you automatically.\n\n*Using TinyUmbrella to back up the blobs to your computer.\n\n*Install iSHSHit from Cydia, which can access your SHSH blobs, save them on your phone, and send them as email attachments.\n\n\nCurrently Apple is blocking access from Cydia to the servers that give the SHSH blobs out, so options #2 and #3 are left.\nFinally, Apple is no longer signing for 4.1, so unless you already backed up SHSH blobs somehow, you will not be able to downgrade.\n", "Q: cant open any apps on my ipad I got a iPad (1) and no mbp or windows for itunes so I hooked it up to another persons mac to get the latest updates for it.\nIt was all good for a while till the battery died the other day.

It's free, made by Apple (so definitly not fake) and works on iOS 5 (which your iPhone 4 supports)\n\nA: You can use this application.\nIt uses an hidden file stored on the iPhone recording an history of location. It has been a little buzz since yesterday when it came out on almost all media worldwide.\nFrom the description of how to tool is working, it will even work with a backup file of the device.

I have videos on the iPad that can be played back by VLC.\nBut the only output I get when connected to the TV is sound, no video.\nIs there any way to get them to play through the HDMI using VLC, or alternatively move them to Cinemax without connecting to a PC and iTunes\n\nA: According to Apple's documentation, the AV Adapter for iOS supports mirroring only on the iPad 2. On the iPad and iPhone, video out has to be supported by the app itself, whether Apple designed it (YouTube) or a third party app (Netflix, Hulu).\nBecause VLC for iOS hasn't been updated in quite a while (indeed its no longer available on the App Store for legal reasons), I wouldn't be surprised that the VLC app just does not support video out, although I don't know for sure if that's the case.\nThere is recourse if you jailbreak, DisplayOut, which enables mirroring on VGA, HDMI, component, or composite outputs for the original iPad, iPhone, and fourth gen iPod Touch. If you are able to install this you would then be able to output VLC on your iPad via the HDMI adapter.\n\nA: If you are going to need to do it with VLC, you will need a jailbreak. If jailbreaking is not an option i would transfer the videos from your ipad onto your mac and watch them in Front Row\n", "Q: Tcl/tk for Mac OS X 10.6, not possible to download? I've upgraded git today and in its README file I found the following excerpt:\n\nIf you don't already have Tcl/Tk Aqua\n  installed on your computer (most MacOS\n  X installs have it), you will get this\n  error message. To resolve it, simply\n  go to the website for Tcl / Tk Aqua\n  and download the latest version:\nhttp://www.categorifiedcoder.info/tcltk/\nIf you have an older version of Tcl /\n  Tk Aqua, you'll benefit from\n  upgrading. There have been many\n  usability improvements since the\n  version that comes shipped with MacOS\n  X Leopard.\n\nI tried the link and it redirects to Daniel A. Steffen LinkedIn page, who is the lead developer of Tcl/Tk for Mac, as far as I understand. I tried googling to find alternative links, but they all redirect to the same LinkedIn page. From this I gather that either this alternative version is already included in the Mac OS X, or there is some ongoing conflict. Can anybody enlighten the situation?\n\nA: Tcl/Tk Aqua is available from this page\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/tcltkaqua/\nThis page has the latest version.\n\nA: As an alternative, Tcl (beta) is now available as from ActiveState\n", "Q: Is it possible to run 10.6 and 10.7 side-by-side and share a user profile? I would like to know if it possible to share an user profile if you have both 10.6 and 10.7 installed on the same machine (different partitions).\nSo far my experience was not a good one but maybe I did something wrong.\nI am interested mostly in sharing iTunes library, Outlook 2011 database and other user setting.\n\nA: You can specify the same home folder, but I'd suggest leaving them separate since you'd potentially have incompatible preference, cache, and other \"Library\" files between the two versions of OS X.\nPerhaps symlink the corresponding preferences for the apps that you want to share data.\niTunes Library is easily shared, just hold the Option key when launching iTunes the first time to specify the library to open (it will remember it subsequently).\nSince Office 2011 wants to use the Microsoft User Data folder within ~/Documents, you'll likely have to symlink this folder from one of the profiles.\n\nA: In general reverting a user folder to a prior version of the OS is a world of hurt. In specific, mixing that pain with the pain of beta / unreleased / unfinished software can really foul things up. A serious effort is expended to make upgrade scripts so that your data can make the jump from 10.6 to 10.7 and there isn't any effort into making that reverse trip.\nOnce the newer OS touches the preferences, files, databases - it's a one way trip. Even a third party app uses API calls from the OS that can make internal caches and data stores incompatible. There are no scripts or undo on the upgrade to revert these changes and pull out the new items so that they work on the older version of the system. Running both systems will amplify this bad effect: go forward and change things, go back and break, go forward and change broken things, go back and break them in new and novel ways.\nAt best, you will get a nice warning from the program when it detects that the settings and data from a newer version can't run and the program will gracefully quit. At worst, data will be lost and/or corrupted.\nNow - lots of things will still work (mostly) and you will get to learn a ton about how things are stored and how software behaved as it breaks. \nIf your goal is to learn and play, have at it! Seriously - it's a great learning exercise. Well over half of my most valuable knowledge of systems was gained from seeing them break, poking around to see how exactly it broke, disassembling and understanding the system, attempting to fix, failing and then reinstalling if it can't be fixed. This is a great way to learn what has changed under the hood between 10.6 and 10.7 preview assuming nothing will ever be used again and you don't mind walking away from the machine by erasing it and starting fresh.\nFor a machine you want to use for real work and data, it's a really bad idea.\n\nA: If you can link them in a Terminal this should be possible\n", "Q: Cursor selection behavior When clicking something on the Mac screen, the cursor will \na) take up residence as directed, \nIf I click again, it will \nb) select the whole word, \nIf I click again, it will\nc) select the whole passage. \nIn Windows, I can click a fourth time, and the cursor will return to \"a,\" the \"residence\" mode.  On the Mac, it stays in \"whole passage\" mode. I have to move the cursor out of text, so restore it to \"a.\"\nI frequently click a fourth time and expect it to return to mode A. I don't like having to correct this and move the cursor.\nHow can I make the fourth click return to mode A, \"residence\"?\n\nA: Clicking will reset to the \"residence\" mode provided that you leave enough time after the previous clicks that it isn't treated as a quadruple click.  At least, that's the way it works for me in Chrome on my MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: Resources for a Mac-only office What are some good resources about running a small office (25 or so computers) with Mac computers only (though perhaps with a Windows or Linux/Unix file server)?\nIn other words, what information and options are available that would help understand how to standardize and maintain a number of Mac clients in an office?\n\nA: If you are in a basic office scenario, I dont think you would need much beyond a good setup and deployment of Apple Remote Desktop, and a proper application of Google Apps for your Business. \nApple has plenty of reading material on ARD, and most of it is actually useful, for instance, the ARD 3.1 Admin Guide talks about performing basic maintenance remotely and automatically, describes how to create reports, install applications, the whole nine yards.\nOn to the Google section, and there are two big pieces that I would recommend: \nWhy Google Docs?\n\n\n*\n\n*Easily share documents, though for super quick stuff I recommend iChat\n\n*track revisions\n\n*collab editing\n\n*offsite storage\n\n*get free stuff like the GAS\n\n\nWhy Gmail?\n\n\n*\n\n*The insane storage\n\n*spam protection\n\n*letting google handle all the email crap (99.9% SLA aka 8 hours of downtime a year)\n\n*the centralized control of groups and shared contacts\n\n*all which sync with mail.app and your address book.\n\n\nYou also get a plethora of other Google products for your business like Google Groups and Google Video, but I dont think those would be that useful in the organization you mentioned.\nI could go on, but it is a great small business package, and it is cheap as dirt (50$ per user per year). The biggest cost I find with Google Apps is some user adoption work (though Google makes it painless as possible).\nYou can even sign up for Google Apps for your domain and try out 50 users at a time, or go with the 30 day free trial of Google Apps for your business (different, better, the one you actually want), that way you don't have to make a big purchase, and still see if your users would be amicable to the change.\n", "Q: iMac Display Replacment I have a 2007 iMac 24inch, and I’m starting to notice the display is giving out (very opaque lines across a section of the screen, which sometimes do not appear.  It is the display though, as I confirmed this at the Apple store), and my warranty has expired (162 days past). The cost of a replacement is $500+, which would be insured up to two years if Apple replaced it.  I just don’t see the benefit, as the monitor is just starting to show this, and I’m not really sure how much more time I will get from the current display. \nDoes anybody have any good experienced with third-party vendors? Or, a good place to purchase a new display? I live in San Francisco.  I’m looking for a cheaper display, otherwise, I might just wait until this one dies completely, then hook another monitor up to it, and mirror the display.  I would rather buy a Mac Pro vs dishing out 500+ into my current iMac.  Any suggestions, ideas?\nNote: This is not the glass in front of the display, it’s the display itself.\nEdit: I had to make a small edit. My warranty has expired 162 past the orginal date, sorry for the confusion.\n\nA: I would go back to the Apple store to speak with a technician again. Apple repair service has historically been warranted for 90 days or the remainder of the existing coverage (one year or three from original purchase if you have AppleCare) so if you are outside the first year the numbers don't add up. It should be written on the back of the quote they provided you. They might even give you some options for other local service providers that have passed the hardware repair tests to work on Macs but you can always look them up yourself.\nThe internal LCD panels for that model are integrated with a frame, and a driver board so you're not just buying a commodity 24\" LCD panel. You are also buying expertise in case it's not the LCD panel but a video card or the cable. I don't know of many shops that can beat Apple's current labor rates of $39 so you would hope to get a good feeling about why the shop can beat apple's price so much on parts. I always feel better when a shop can explain to me why the parts they use are cheaper than the manufacturer's parts so I can make a good decision.\nIt's not as hard a repair as say the graphics card or the logic board in that model, but you'll find lower labor rates and better parts prices from shops that do a high volume of that model repair.\nOnce you've got some quotes you can make a better call in your situation - it might make sense to buy an external monitor even if it's more costly that the repair - especially if that investment will carry forward to an eventual new mac.\n", "Q: Can I copy the PDFs I have on my Mac to the iPad? Can I copy the PDFs I have on my Mac to the iPad ?\nI want to download them from example from Google Scholar with the Mac (or iPad) and then read them on the iPad.\n\nA: There are 3 main routes to get PDF to your iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag them into iTunes and have iTunes sync them in the iBooks tab. Other apps will allow management of PDF as files at the bottom of the apps tab in iTunes. \n\n*Use another program like PhoneView to drop them directly to the iPad via USB.\n\n*Move them within iOS - mobile mail, mobile safari and other apps will detect that iBooks (and other apps) can read PDF's and offer to move them for you. There are truly hundreds of apps that will receive PDF just like iBooks will. Just a few that are mature, widely adopted and well designed are iDisk, Dropbox, AirSharing but I'll keep this focused on your transport question and leave the comparison of which app on iOS is best for it's own thread. \n\n\nWhich one is best depends on your workflow, but knowing all three may help you be more nimble.\n\nA: Use Dropbox. You should already be using Dropbox, of course, because it's awesome. But it's also one of the easiest ways to get docs onto your device.\nDrop it in your dropbox on your desktop, fire up the iPad Dropbox app, download the file, and choose which iPad app you want to open it in. Ta da!\n\nA: Yes you can, drop them into iTunes or email them to an account you can check via the iPad. You can choose to either read it in the Maill app or read it in iBooks. Or just use Safari on the iPad to go to http://scholar.google.com/ and download the PDF to iBooks right there.\n", "Q: How can I keep certain apps from showing in the command-tab switcher? Pretty much self-explanatory... I just have a bunch of utilities (LaunchBar, DeliBar, Tags, etc...) that I never need to tab to and so are just in the way. \n\nA: If these applications offer the ability to Hide the Dock Item, and live only in the Menu Bar, then they will not show up in the Command+Tab switcher list. Review the preferences within each application to see if this feature is supported.\nLast I knew, there were no stable solutions for hiding Dock Icons without adverse application affects.\nI have numerous applications that live in the Menu Bar only, and most have an option to show it if necessary:\nAlfred, Sparrow, iMenuMeters, Divvy, Last.fm, Flux, Little Snitch, and Tunnelblick.\n", "Q: What's the most robust way to backup an iTunes library? I have an iTunes library on my WinXP PC.  This library includes tons of music, some podcasts, and a few T.V. shows.  What's the best way to back up the whole iTunes library?\nSpecifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*All music, album art, podcasts and videos preserved and recoverable\n\n*All album art preserved and recoverable\n\n*All playlists preserved and recoverable\n\n*All settings, such as compilations and volume adjustments, preserved and recoverable\n\n*Catalog can be restored on Win and Mac iTunes installations\n\n\nIt would be awesome if there were a way to do incremental backups instead of having to do the whole process every few months.  \n\nA: You simply need to backup the entire iTunes folder and optionally the alternate folder(s) where the media is stored.\nTo ensure your media is consolidated so you don't have to track more than two folders for backup, be sure to allow iTunes to consolidate and organize your music.\n\nThe files stored are readable by both mac and windows so you can place them on the new machine, perhaps re-link the directory structure since a Mac won't know what to do with C:\\My Documents\\Music\\Itunes\\whatever but everything including the counts, downloaded apps, artwork and playlists will all transfer. You may need to find the folder where iTunes stores iOS device backups as that may be in a different location but that's easy to recreate by plugging your device into the new iTunes and finishing one backup.\nIt's still a good idea to export the library as XML to cover you for times when the iTunes database gets corrupt but this will work across all versions of iTunes in the past.\n", "Q: Is there any way to get rid of the sound made when a screenshot is created? Obviously other than muting the computer. I just want to create a screenshot without having that \"camera sound\" come out.\nIs there a way to disable this sound?\n\nA: After launching Grab, open preferences (in the menus, click Grab => Preferences) and uncheck \"Enable Sound\".\nA screenshot of the preferences here:\n\n\nA: You can turn off user interface sounds, though that will remove the empty trash sound and the like.\n\nI havent tried it, but the file itself resides at /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/Resources/SystemSounds/system/Grab.aif, you might try moving that temporarily and seeing if you can screenshot still.\n", "Q: MacBook battery/replacement battery does not work My MacBook battery failed a few months back. For a few weeks, my computer would go to sleep a few seconds after removing the power cord. (It could be awoken by re-attaching the power cord, and it would be in the same state as I had left it.) After a few weeks, it would shut down instantly after removing the power cord.\n(Note: This happened a few months after I began heavily using a dual-boot of Ubuntu on my MacBook, as well as upgrading the Mac OS to Snow Leopard. This is a 2008 black 13-inch MacBook.)\nI assumed this meant that the battery was completely shot, so I just recently got around to buying a new one. (I know, I should have dealt with this sooner.) It just arrived today—I bought it from a respected eBay seller—but it does not appear to take a charge. One thing that I have noticed is that my computer now stays on for a few seconds after removing the power cord, then goes to sleep; when I attach the power cord, I can wake it up again and it hasn't been powered down. (Just like the way my old battery acted at first.) However, my battery indicator still shows just an \"X\" where it should show a charge.\nI've done some research and found that resetting my computer's PRAM and resetting the SMC have been known to fix these problems. However, I have done both—to no avail.\nOne last thing: For the past few months or so, whenever I do software update, I always have a firmware update (pictured below) that never seems to actually be applied.\n\nI have pretty much deduced at this point that it's probably not a problem with the battery, but rather something with the computer or how the computer interacts with the battery. If someone could shed some light on this, I would be eternally grateful.\n\nA: I'm thinking it has something to do with the failed SMC update.\nCan you do an update of the SMC  Firmware independent of Software Update.  Download the update here http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1312\nOnce you are satisfied that the update has been applied successfully, keep your new battery on charge for 24 hours.  Let us know if it fixes the issue.\n\nA: The computer should not go to sleep seconds after disconnecting the power cord. I suspect you got a dud battery. Contact your respected eBay seller and ask for a replacement or your money back.\n\nA: Always buy original Apple batteries. I had also bought a battery for my old iBook G4 from eBay, it also did work.\nSo, my advise is to buy original Apple parts and accessories.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem. The key clue is the 'X' icon - the new battery is bad, and the Mac is unable to recognise it. \nThe other replies suggesting an official Apple battery are the safest option. However, you might want to look into getting something from iFixit (good quality control, reasonable price) or even Amazon (price will likely be lower, and they have an excellent return policy).\n", "Q: Is there a way to stop the MobileMe synchronization from Terminal? It happens to me that, sometimes, the MobileMe synchronization starts when it should not, when Mac OS X is busy doing something time-consuming. In such cases, I try to stop the synchronization using its menu extra, but for some reasons the synchronization doesn't stop.\nIs there a way to stop it from Terminal?\n\nA: Try this :\nsudo kill -9 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DotMacSyncManager.framework/Versions/A/Resources/mobilemesyncclient\n\nI don't use Mobile Me so cannot test this but this is the location of the Mobile Me sync command.  So killing it should stop the syncing.\n", "Q: Help \"Rebuilding\" a Mac Pro G3? I've got a gutted Mac Pro G3 tower which I'm thinking of building a machine into. What form factor should the motherboard be and what are some good starting points for parts?\nI'm not necessarily looking into Apple parts per sé. I'd be fine installing Windows in there too.\nEDIT:\nThe tower looks like this, except the front drive and panel is missing.\n\n\nA: I don't know what motherboard setup they used, but it might be ATX. Can you post some images of the innards and the backside? Then we might be more able to say what would be doable.\n(Edit: it'd definitely possible: here's instructions from someone doing essentially what you're talking about: http://www.inventgeek.com/projects/p4mac/OverView.aspx.)\nI have a Sawtooth PowerMac G4 and it has a fairly standard ATX motherboard. I'm planning on pulling its innards out and putting a microATX board in there. I'd recommend getting the ATX specifications and a ruler and seeing if all the holes are in more or less the right place. So what you're thinking of is definitely possible.\n", "Q: Getting IP address of hotspot connection I want to find out the IP address of my iPhone Hotspot connection.\nI can enable it, and connect to it with a laptop, etc - but I want the IP address so I can telnet to the iPhone (I've set up the socket server software on the iPhone).\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Look at your 'router' or 'gateway' address.  Open up the network control panel, select the iPhone connection, and the address should be displayed there, no?\nAlternately it can be found by issuing an 'ifconfig' command in the terminal.\nFailing all that you could get the external IP by browsing to www.whatsmyip.com and use that instead.\n\nA: Depends what you mean. Do you need to check the \"public\" address? IE the address of the iPhone on the internet? In that case visit www.whatismyip.com.\nDo you want to see what address your iPhone is to your laptop connected via wifi to your iPhone? In that case on Windows you can check by going to properties under network. On mac you can Goto the Airport Icon, Open network preference, advanced, TCP/IP or open a terminal and type ifconfig.\n", "Q: My iPhone 4 running on 4.2.1 and I was wondering if I could restore the phone? My iPhone 4 running on 4.2.1 and I was wondering if I could restore the phone to the same firmware by dowloading the original firmware and holding SHIFT in iTunes and clicking restore???\n\nA: You may restore your iPhone to 4.2.1, but you need the SHSHs for your device as Apple servers only allow 4.3 firmware at the moment, I think.\n", "Q: Docking station for Macbook Pro that lets you use the book + external monitor Does a docking station exist for MacBook Pros that let you dock it and keep the book open, so you can still use the keyboard, trackpad and monitor plus let you have an auxiliary monitor connected. I am debating ordering a Thinkpad with dock vs. a MacBook Pro but the user I am ordering it for loves her two monitors and was using a Win XP desktop. We are going to switch her to a mobile machine but the \"docking\" solution is very appealing and manually hooking up a second monitor all the time is not that appealing. \n\nA: There isn't that many on the market (most users are happy to connect the mac cables manually).  However this solution looks pretty nice :\nhttp://www.bookendzdocks.com/\nHope this helps.\nPS Here is another solution, \nhttp://www.hengedocks.com/\nbut doesn't allow the macbook to remain open, so you'd need an external monitor, keyboard and mouse.\n", "Q: Why does iPhone navigation bar disappear when browsing certain sites?

At first I thought I was launching the Facebook app by mistake but I verified that's not the case.  Any idea why this happens? \n\nA: Yes, mobile sites can be programmed to remove the navigation bar whilst browsing the site.  Makes for a better user experience when these elements get out of the way.\nThis is documented here  http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/MetaTags.html\nIn particular the apple-mobile-web-app-capable element.\n", "Q: Downloading all App store purchases? So there is no \"good\" way of seeing all my purchased items in iTunes (only the very cubersome \"purchase history\" screen). Is there, however, a way to download all my purchases to the computer? e.g. when I install iTunes on a new computer?\nThere is the store/check for available downloads button. However, it has no effect in my computer and I suspect that it's not intended for apps, but for music/videos purchased from iTunes (which are not available at my country).\nIs there another way?

What is the font that's used in Mac OS X's graphical user interface (GUI), in the menus, dialog boxes, etc.? Is it different from what was used in the classic Mac OS (i.e. OS 9 or older)? If so, what are the fonts back then? I like the font but never knew what it was.

Combined with the Add Folder Actions (where you can assign an Applescript that runs when a file is added to a folder), you should be able to create an Applescript to do this (using the touch command above).\n", "Q: How do I get \"wget\" for Snow Leopard? There's no wget command. How do I get it?\n\nA: You will need to install Xcode with Unix Dev Support, then you can download and compile the source, or try macports, or homebrew.\n$ brew install wget\n$ sudo port install wget\nOr you could try a graphical form which includes wget, like http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/24787/cocoawget\n\nA: To expand on Michael Granger's answer: curl (included on all Snow Leopard installs) is really quite powerful, and can do a lot of what wget does (and a number of things it doesn't).\nBut, as noted on the curl FAQ:\n\n1.3 What is curl not?\nCurl is not a wget clone. That is a\n  common misconception. Never, during\n  curl's development, have we intended\n  curl to replace wget or compete on its\n  market. Curl is targeted at\n  single-shot file transfers. \nCurl is not a web site mirroring\n  program. If you want to use curl to\n  mirror something: fine, go ahead and\n  write a script that wraps around curl\n  to make it reality (like curlmirror.pl\n  does).\n...\n\n(For reference, here's that curlmirror.pl script)\n\nA: If you don't want to use either homebrew or macports there is a great set of instructions here, reproduced below (using a slightly more up-to-date version of wget).\nThese instructions require both Xcode and the command line tools to be installed.\nFirst, use curl to download the latest wget source :\ncurl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.14.tar.gz\n\nNext we use tar to uncompress the files you just downloaded:\ntar -xzf wget-1.14.tar.gz\n\nUse cd to change to the directory:\ncd wget-1.14\n\nConfigure with the appropriate –with-ssl flag to prevent a “GNUTLS not available” error:\n./configure --with-ssl=openssl\n\nBuild the source:\nmake\n\nInstall wget, it ends up in /usr/local/bin/:\nsudo make install\n\nConfirm everything worked by running wget:\nwget --help\n\nClean up by removing wget source files when finished:\ncd .. && rm -rf wget*\n\n\nA: Probably the easiest and painless way to get wget is to install Homebrew. In fact, the very home page says:\n\nHomebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn't include with OS X.\n\nand their example is:\n$ brew install wget\n\n;)\n\nA: Alternatively, if you don't need wget specifically, Snow Leopard does come with curl which does many of the same things. \nE.g., fetching your flair via wget:\nwget http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/flair/2726.png\n\nvs. fetching it with curl:\ncurl -O http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/flair/2726.png\n\nNotably lacking from curl is wget's --mirror option, but it does have nifty fetching with patterns, which handles many of the same problems:\n# Fetch flair images for users 2726 through 2730\ncurl -O http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/flair/[2726-2730].png\n\n", "Q: How to check whether my Intel-based Mac is 32-bit or 64-bit I want to install new software that has these two versions, and I need to know which one to install.\nHow can I tell the 32 or 64 bit capabilities of my Mac?\n\nA: The arch command with no arguments will display the machine's architecture type.\nThe results (from the arch(1) manpage):\ni386    32-bit intel\nppc     32-bit powerpc\nppc64   64-bit powerpc\nx86_64  64-bit intel\n\n\nA: Go to the Apple Menu and select \"About this Mac\". If you have a Core Duo processor, you have a 32-bit CPU. Otherwise (Core 2 Duo, Xeon, i3, i5, i7, anything else), you have a 64-bit CPU.\nMac OS X is fairly bitness-agnostic, so either should work. If still in doubt, use the 32-bit version.\n\nA: This knowledge base article from Apple should provide you with the correct answer as it depends on how old your MacBook Pro is.\nBasically if you have anything newer than an 2008 MacBook you have a 64 bit processor and OS…\nHere is the cheat table\n\n\nA: Just run Activity monitor and find the process named kernel_task . Then look at the column Kind. If it says Intel, then you are currently running 32bit mode. If it says Intel (64-bit), then as the text says, you are running 64 bit mode.\nNote: You must show All processes, from te dropdown next to the search box (filter). \nThen you can check @Nate Bird's answer on what processor you have and the supported modes for it.\n\nA: To tell if you are running the 32-bit or 64-bit kernel (which matters for some device drivers), launch System Profiler and click on the Software heading in the Contents section.\nThe line 64-bit Kernel and Extensions will say Yes if you are running the 64-bit kernel and No if you are running the 32-bit kernel.\nNote: Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard is the last release that a 32-bit Intel Mac can run, Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and up are, by default, 64-bit. Additionally, System Profiler was renamed to System Information in OS X 10.7. \n\nA: Another option is to use sysctl in a shell:\n$ sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable\n\nIt’ll show 1 if the CPU is capable of running 64-bit programs and 0 otherwise.\n\nA: OS X doesn't have an overall 32/64-bit mode; it simply runs each program in the \"best\" available mode, based on what the CPU's capable of and what the program supports.  Many OS X programs come in universal binary format, meaning that they have multiple versions (some combination of PowerPC 32-bit, PowerPC 64-bit, Intel 32-bit, and Intel 64-bit) included in the same file.\nEclipse apparently doesn't come this way, so you have to decide which version to download.  I'm not familiar enough with it to know if it has to run in the same mode as what you're trying to debug; if so, run your program, and look for it in Activity Monitor to see what mode it's running in. If Eclipse doesn't have to be in the same mode (or the Java code just runs inside Eclipse), then you can use either one (unless you're on a 32-bit-only CPU, i.e. Core Solo or Core Duo).\n\nA: In a terminal window type uname -m. If you get x86_64 then you have 64bit OSx running.\nThe full output looks something like this:\nDarwin Macbook-Air.local 11.4.2 Darwin Kernel Version 11.4.2: Thu Aug 23 16:25:48 PDT 2012; root:xnu-1699.32.7~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 i386 MacBookAir4,2 Darwin\n\n\nA: Run this on the command line:\ngetconf LONG_BIT\n\n\nA: As you may have seen from all the answers - macs are different than other Operating Systems (OS) in that the 32 bit and 64 bit dividing line is all blurry. You can have 32 bit code run on a 64 bit CPU.\nA nice overview of this subject is at Apple's 64-bit Transition Guide Keep in mind, this transition was started before Tiger was released on April 29, 2005 and is effectively complete.\n\nWhat Is 64-Bit Computing?\nFor the purposes of this document, 64-bit computing is defined as\nsupport for a 64-bit address space—that is, support for concurrent use\nof more than 4 GB of memory by a single executable program—no more, no\nless.\nBeginning with version 10.4, Mac OS X supports command-line 64-bit\nexecutables on G5-based Macintosh computers and 64-bit-capable Intel\nMacintosh computers.\nBeginning with version 10.5, Mac OS X supports full-featured 64-bit\napplications on G5-based and 64-bit-capable Intel Macintosh computers.\nBeginning with Snow Leopard, Mac OS X uses a 64-bit kernel on some\nIntel computers.\n\nAlso - CPU that are \"64-bit\" still have parts that are only 32 bits wide. Similarly, CPU that are \"32-bit\" also have parts that are 128 bits (or more) wide. This is why most people focus on the address space for a specific program rather than whether the hardware is \"64-bit\" or how much of it is \"64-bit\"\n\nA: Run in Terminal:\nsysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable\n\nIf it gives 1, it means your computer has 64-bit architecture.\nOr use arch command which could return either i386 (32-bit Intel) or x86_64 (64-bit Intel).\n\nA: Run uname -a in the shell to show details about the kernel.\nYou can see RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 for 64 bit version\n\nA: Open Terminal.app and run the command below:\nuname -m | if grep -q 64; then echo \"64-bit CPU (`uname -m`)\"; else echo \"32-bit CPU (`uname -m`)\"; fi\n\nA: On the command line you could run ...\n(\nprintf '\\n\\n'\necho 'System Software Overview:'\nsystem_profiler SPSoftwareDataType | sed -n '/64-bit/s/[[:space:]]*\\(.*\\)/\\1/p'\nioreg -l -p IODeviceTree | sed -n '/firmware\\-abi/s/.*\"\\([^\"]*\\)\".*\"\\([^\"]*\\)\".*/\\1: \\2/p'\nprintf '\\n\\n'\necho 'Java:'\n#man java_home | cat\n#/usr/libexec/java_home -h  \n#/usr/libexec/java_home -V\n#/usr/libexec/java_home -X\n/usr/libexec/java_home -d 32\n/usr/libexec/java_home -d 64\nprintf '\\n\\n'\n)\n\n# sample output:\n#\n# System Software Overview:\n# 64-bit Kernel and Extensions: No \n# firmware-abi: EFI64\n#\n# Java:\n# /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home\n# /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home\n\nAs already stated by Gordon Davisson, fat binaries may include both 32-bit and 64-bit executables of a program (see also Multiple Architecture, Single Build).\nfile /mach_kernel /usr/lib/libSystem.dylib\n\n", "Q: AppleScript app started prompting to run or quit. How can I disable this? I'm not entirely sure why this has started happening since this is completely new behaviour and I haven't done any system updates but I have a nice little toolbar app for my Snow Leopard Finder.app that opens the existing folder/or files in TextMate.\nIt used to simply bring up TextMate with the chosen content but since today it instead gives me a prompt asking me to run or quit the script.\nHere is what the popup looks like:\n\nNow… this app/script isn't new, I trust the script and I don't want this popup everytime I use it.\nSo 2 questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I disable this annoying prompt?\n\n*Why am I all of a sudden getting it when yesterday everything was working fine?\n\n\nAny insight would be much appreciated.\nFor reference the script in question is this one: OpenInTextMate\nHowever the MateDot.app script I was using also is doing the same thing.\nThanks for reading.\nJannis\n\nA: When you create a script in AppleScript Editor and then save it as an Application, there is an option to show a Startup Screen, as shown in the image below:\n\nWhen that option is enabled, when you launch the script in the Finder, it will first show that initial dialog before continuing.\nAs long as the AppleScript script-application in question wasn't saved with the Run Only option (see the image above), you should be able to open the script in AppleScript Editor by dragging the script-application's icon onto AppleScript Editor's icon. (When a script is saved as Run Only, AppleScript Editor won't allow you to open it to see the source code). So, if you are able to open it OK, then you could Save a copy of it and make sure the Startup Screen option is disabled.\nAs for why this suddenly started happening when yesterday it didn't, I'm not sure. What version of OS X are you using?\n\nA: I know this is old - but it happened to me today on macOS Sierra 10.12.4.\nBased on this page I solved it be running chmod +rw applet.rsrc in the /Contents/Resources folder under the applet.\nStrangely enough, ls -l looks identical before and after chmod +rw applet.rsrc, but the prompt has stopped appearing.\n", "Q: How can I config my Mac to don't scape characters when I copy and paste some text on the console? Is there anyway to config my Mac to don't scape characters when I copy and paste some text on the console? Could anybody help me? It is driving me crazy to erase all \\ characters inserted after a simple copy and paste on the console.\nMany thanks,\nThiago\n\nA: If you are asking about pasting into windows of the Terminal application (which is not the same as Console application; neither of which are the same as the actual “console”), then you can uncheck the Escape non-ASCII input option in the “settings set” that you are using.\nWith Terminal active, open the preferences: Press ⌘ + , or select the Terminal > Preferences… menu item.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Settings icon in the tool bar of the preferences window.\n\n*From the list on the left side of the preferences window,\nselect the “settings set” that you want to modify.\nThe settings set of the previously active Terminal window will be initially selected.\n\n*Click the Advanced tab.\n\n*Uncheck the Escape non-ASCII input checkbox.\n\n", "Q: Where do terminated incomplete downloads go when using firefox? Where do terminated incomplete downloads go when using firefox?\n\nA: They should stay in the designated folder. Mine is /Downloads, and they can have either the filename.part or some weird name.part. Either way, they should be in your downloads or designated folder. If you cannot find it, right click and do show in finder, and it will open the folder containing it.\n\nA: To the \"great bit-bucket in the sky\".  Whenever I cancel a download with Firefox, it cleans up after itself.  Leaving partial downloads around is abnormal, e.g., if I crashed or killed Firefox during the download.\n", "Q: how can i get mp4 from the internet onto my ipod touch i have a URL like this for example: http://media.ch9.ms/ch9/2451/19bd8bd5-6f13-440a-a8b9-9ebd01582451/NYCDRMVVMS2_low_ch9.mp4\nand i want to bring that into itunes and then onto my ipod touch.\nwhat is the best way for going about this?\n\nA: Right click the link in your browser and save it in a place you can remember. Open finder and locate the mp4. Right click the file and click Open With > iTunes. You can also drag the video into iTunes if it is already open. Then you can sync the video by plugging in your iPod and selected it under \"Devices\" in iTunes. There is a tab for videos and you can select which videos from iTunes you wish to sync (just like music).\nAlternatively, you can visit the link in Safari on your iPod and stream the video, but you would of course need an internet connection.\n", "Q: No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key um...i don't know what happened..\nI just opened lid to wake up my mac then it freezed.

How can I make sure that it won't happen again?\n\nA: It's possible the drive is failing. Before doing anything else, backup your data. Holding the option key brings up the startup manager which shows any available volumes.\nDo you have multiple drives connected to your computer? Maybe it is trying to boot using the wrong drive.\n\nA: Before everything, try the solution that user \"Moon\" mentionned as comment of his question:\n1. Whilst holding down the \"alt\" button, press the Power button.\n2.

If you'd like help with that, then head over to stackoverflow.com, where that question has been asked a few times.\nAs for getting this to happen every 60 seconds, you could turn it into a launch agent and let launchd do it for you:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"\n \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.stackexchange.apple.12692</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/usr/bin/osascript</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>osascript</string>\n        <string>-e</string>\n        <string>tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \",\" using command down</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>ServiceDescription</key>\n    <string>Auto Keypress</string>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Second</key>\n        <integer>0</integer>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nToss that in ~/Library/LaunchAgents and you should be good to go (once you load the plist and/or log out and log back in).\n\nA: Use the \"Watch Me Do\" to enter \"G,\" then use the pause action to pause for 60 sec, then the loop action and select \"Loop Automatically.\"\n", "Q: Making MacBook faster? -> What preferences or other things might I miss, when install a fresh OS My MacBook 2,16 GHz (13\" white with the max. 3 GB RAM from about 2007) feels quite slow.\nI read somewhere that upgrading and keeping old user profiles can slow the Mac down my current user profile in OS 10.6.5 is based on that from 10.4 (which might be even based on 10.3 or so...)\nSo would it make sense to \"start fresh\"?\n\n\n*\n\n*What Preferences might I miss after a clean install\nor would it be enough to start with an empty new profile?\n\n*May I get problems with permissions?\n\n\nA: The best way to experience the \"how would start from scratch be\" without starting from scratch is to create a new empty user, remove all \"login items\" and work from there. That's as close as you can get. Of course there are other factors that you might have installed and might be slowing down your system (old extensions, drivers, etc that may be logging in excess, faulty services, etc.).\nIf you do perform a clean install (and have a backup on another drive), \"manually\" migrating is not that bad. You will have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag your apps from Old_Drive to the New_Drive (a good opportunity to not drag those old things you don't use anymore) :)\n\n*Before starting them up, find ~/Library and migrate Preferences and Application Support for the apps you want to conserve (tho sometimes trashing the preferences is a good fresh start).\n\n*Also check /Library/Application Preferences and all the libraries in general.\n\n*Copy over your Documents, Music, Pictures, Movies, etc. (Another great time to leave old stuff behind).\n\n*Reconfigure your new computer too, network, your dock, the finder settings you had, your wallpaper, etc. All that stuff.\nIn regards to your specific question, it's \"half correct\" in my experience. I upgraded from 10.3->10.4->10.5 but then Snow Leopard reappeared, tho I was going to Upgrade, my drive crashed and I decided it was a good time to start again. I had backups but didn't feel like migrating (because Migration assistance won't let you pick individual applications it's an all or nothing) and I had old copies of Photoshop and stuff that I didn't want behind.\nAlso the Differences between \"Snow Leopard\" were \"huge\" in terms of underlying OS, so It looked like a good idea.\nIt's a pain the first two days, but then you quickly begin to get things back and, to quote the movie The Abyss: \"the body will remember\". ;)\nAnother thing that may or may not be annoying, depending upon your software, is that you'll have to re-register some apps but you have 1Password with all your licences, don't you? :)\nFinally, you shouldn't do this without having a backup (bootable clone) of your current drive, JUST IN CASE. A Time Machine is \"ok\" but I wouldn't only trust that as the recovery process is much slower than a simple boot the new drive :) So if you have a cloned drive, you can always reinstall and see for yourself, if you don't like it, clone your drive back.\nGood luck!\nP.S.: To directly answer your concerns: You shouldn't get much trouble with permissions, nothing you can't really \"force\" and fix and preferences… well… all of them until you start copying stuff back! :)\n\nA: To make your Mac faster and easily clean it up I suggest using OnyX http://www.titanium.free.fr/download.php it is a small utility with lots of power!\n", "Q: Access localhost on iPad I want to access my web application on iPad for local testing (http://myMachine_Name). But here is the problem;\n\n\n*\n\n*I am having a local copy on my Windows machine with a Weblogic server running and the app server requires a VPN connection\n\n*Is there any way by which I can access http://myMachine_Name on the iPad , and given that my local machine would be connected to VPN.\n\n*Is there any iPad app which can help in testing..My main purpose is to have the fastest way to test any changes I make on the iPad and that I think would be to directly access http://myMachine_Name on the iPad Safari. But I do not know how.\n\n\nNote: By VPN, I mean it is connected to another network at a remote location. Also the iPad is connected to the internet via a Wifi connection on MAC which is on the same local network as my Windows machine..\nI think having VPN connectivity on the iPad might be an option, but I'll want to avoid that as that would require paying huge licensing fee.\nPlease let me know if I need to provide any other clarifications..\nThank you.\n\nA: You don't want to access localhost on your iPad because you're not running a webserver on your iPad. I'm not sure if I understand the question, but it sounds like you are running the webserver on you Windows machine and you can access it on that machine at http://windows-pc-name.\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean by \"the app server requires a VPN connection,\" but it sounds like you need to connect to the remote network in order to run the webapp. Generally all traffic is sent over VPN so that is probably why you can't visit http://windows-pc-name on your iPad's browser. I would see if you can configure your webserver to use VPN, and not have your Windows network connection go through VPN. That way the server can communicate with the remote network, but it won't interfere with anything else.\nJust in case you are using the wrong name, try http://192.168.1.101 or whatever you Windows Machine's local IP address is.\n\nA: you can not access your local computer to the ipad because ipad runs in web service well if you connect computer and ipad both of them to internet then you can access through ipad vpn.\n", "Q: Is it possible to upload iPhone apps to iPhone on an expired dev certificate? As the title says, is it possible to upload iPhone apps to iPhone on an expired dev certificate?

I have a MacBook 2,16 GHz with 3 GB RAM (white from 2007) and I wonder how much free space should there be on the start volume.\nI have a 100 GB partition for OS X (10.6.5) and a separate data partition of 300 GB (however the user directory is on the system partition).\nfree space on the start volume:\n30 GB after booting\n22..25 GB after one day of use\ngoes down to about 22 GB after several days of use (I usually reboot, when it reaches 22 GB).\n(there is also about 30 GB free on the data partition).\n=> Could that be a performance problem or is that enough free space?\nI have some large databases open in DevonThink Pro, mostly many pdf files open in Skim,  Safari seems to need quite some RAM and there are some non-native apps (TexMakerX and JabRef) which also get quite slow sometimes.\n\nA: I've run for 3 years with no more than 10GB ever free on my 160GB disk, and quite frequently as low as 500MB free. Things seem to work just fine.\nAperture complains loudly if there's less than about 1GB free: I think that would be a sensible minimum to stick to.\nYour system swap file does get recovered without a reboot -- if memory usage drops enough.\nI find that Caches, particularly those of Safari.app and Spotify.app are a big cause of unnecessary disk use. You can rm -Rf ~/Library/Caches whilst the system is running without any bad effects if you're about to run out of space!\n\nA: I'd say you have enough space. \nMost of the time, the decrease in hard disk space can be attributed to swap files (page files), aka virtual memory. Since the file is essentially a copy of what was in your RAM, the size of swap files are typically on the order comparable to the physical RAM size and rarely reaches like 10 times the size of your RAM (unless you have a real memory hog app).\nEven if it did, quitting the hog or restarting (like you do) should free them up and is never a permanent problem.\nI've never seen a case where swap files and temporary files reach 30 GB, which you have as your free space, free space should not be a problem.\n\nA: According to this About.com page written by Tom Nelson:\n\nI would say keep at least 15% of your startup drive free at all times...so that some basic OS X maintenance scripts will have sufficient free drive space to run. This includes OS X's built-in disk defragmentation system, memory swap space, and enough space to create cache and temp files when OS X starts up, while still leaving room for basic applications, such as email and web browsers, to use free space as needed.\n\n", "Q: Macports and scala I have installed scala 2.8 using macports. I have setup the SCALA_HOME env variable and I have added the bin directory to my path. \nIf I type scala-2.8 into my terminal I get the scala interpreter. \nProblem is, I feel like my netbeans isn't able to run and compile scala because of the \"2.8 part. If you download scala from the web and install manually you are able to just type scala and i suspect that's what Netbeans is expecting. \nI realise that I can get around this simply by using the web version but I would rather use macports if I can\nIs there any way round this?\n\nA: You need to install the port scala_select When run this will symbolically link /opt/local/bin/scala to the chosen versioned scala executable. In your case you can point it to scala-2.8\n", "Q: How can I convert JPG into PDF easily? Is there any way to batch convert .jpg files into single .pdf files?\n\nA: Never forget your little fellow Automator, sitting in a hard drive near you :)\nLaunch Automator, create a new workflow. Now you need to add two actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the \"Files & Folders\" select Ask for Finder Items and drag it. \n\n*In the PDFs Category, find \"New PDF from Images\" and also drag it.\nYour workflow should look like this:\n\nNow read the options for each Action and customize accordingly. Investigate similar actions (especially in the Files & Folders category) and perhaps the Photos if you want to transform your images from JPG to something else. In fact, go ahead and look all over automator, there are a lot of interesting things there. :)\nWhen you're satisfied with your Workflow, click \"Run\" on the top right corner. Watch the magic happens and depending upon the number of items and your CPU power, you might go grab a coffee/tea.\n\nA: I'm more at ease with commandline tools myself. ImageMagick is great for this. You can install IM through Homebrew:\nbrew install imagemagick\n\nAfter that you can simply do this in a Terminal:\nconvert *.jpg output.pdf\n\nand if the resulting PDF is a bit too big you can try:\nconvert -quality 60 *.jpg output.pdf\n\nOf course ImageMagick also works on other Unix systems, and even on cygwin.\n\nA: Do not install anything else. macOS already has what you need. Just use \"sips\"\nIn my example a file is called \"file.jpg\" and I want to convert it to \"file.pdf\". Accordingly, I enter this command here.\nsips --setProperty format pdf file.jpg --out file.pdf\n\nNow I want to convert all files with the extension \".jpg\" to \".pdf\". So what do i do I'm making a \"for\" loop that allows me to easily convert all files from \".jpg\" to \".pdf\". You can also change the \"for\" loop to convert png to jpg, for example. No problem at all, just replace formats.\nfor i in *.jpg; do sips --setProperty format pdf \"${i}\" --out \"${i%.*}.pdf\"; done\n\n\nThere is a hidden program in the image capture. This program enables you to convert images to PDF. Since the results are not nearly as good as I described with \"sips\" it is still there and it is good to know.\nIt doesn't really have a graphical user interface, but it can still be started via GUI. But I'll show it with the terminal\nThe program I'm talking about is\n/System/Library/Image\\ Capture/Automatic\\ Tasks/MakePDF.app\n\nChange to the directory with the terminal where the executable file is located.\ncd /System/Library/Image\\ Capture/Automatic\\ Tasks/MakePDF.app/Contents/MacOS\n\nNow we have to start it with our file that we have as a PDF\n./MakePDF /Path/to/image\n\nNote:\nI recommend that you select \"Adjust to 8x10\" on the shelf. This setting remains persistent. You don't have to keep changing it.\n\nA: I don't know if this works with .jpg files but the easiest way I know to convert text is to select print in the file menu, then in the lower left of the print menu select save as PDF.\n\nA: Preview has \"Export as PDF\" It's simple to use, and has always worked for me:\n\n", "Q: Snow Leopard killing internet access on home network Something weird that I think I've narrowed down to OS X. Everytime I fire up my MB Pro it kills internet access for all devices (including OS X) for about 5 minutes. Ping and DNS works fine but actually pulling content times out usually.\nReason I've narrowed it down to my MBP is that it only happens when I open up my laptop to work. My home PC is Win7 and will be chugging along nicely until my laptop comes online then it dies.\nAnyone else have this problem? Did some general 'net searches and found some similar issues with older versions of OS X but not with Snow Leopard.\nMy home network is cable via a Motorola modem to a Netgear router. MBP is connecting via WiFi to the network.\n\nA: Hard to say without being able to look at your network settings in your Mac and in your house in general, but I imagine your MB is creating a network conflict with your internet Router and therefore the other machines (and itself) end up sending the packages to the wrong place.\nThe first thing that came to my mind was that your MB Pro is not using DHCP and it's using the same IP Address as your Netgear router or Motorola Modem.\nThings to diagnose:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before even turning on your MB Pro, in your Windows machine, check your network settings. Write down your IPAddress, Your Subnet Mask, your Router and DNS Servers if any. Also note if you have DHCP Enabled or you're manually setting your IP.\n\n*With the above settings safely saved (on a piece of paper) turn on your MB Pro and check your network settings for your \"Airport\" -wifi- network: Go to System Preferences, Network and you will see your Airport. Note the numbers and post them back so we can try to see if the problem is this easy or there's something else involved. \n\nA: I am having the same problem with torrent client. Whenever I start it, all browsers give time-out error. \nWarner came and installed a new modem and upped my band from 10 to 20Mbps, but the Internet sagged after that. On both MacBook and MacBookPro. All the usual tv programs I normally watch load slower, the meters show traffic jumps from 100-20K to zero constantly. \n\nA: You will want to try changing your network adapter settings, under advanced settings/Ethernet.

Should I just go back to 10.5?\n\nA: Did Installer give you a specific error or was it an actual all out crash (with crash report)? You can find out more by checking the log window in Installer. It's hard to tell but if you've had issues installing items, there's something broken with your Snow Leopard installation. What format is your drive (HFS or UFS, Journaled or not, Case-sensitive or not)\nIf you haven't already, try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repair Disk Permissions (gasp an actual valid use for it)\n\n*Check your Disk using Disk Utility as well\n\n*Check out /var/log/install.log (you can use Console.app) to see what kind of errors\n\n*If Installer was actually crashing, check out the crash log (you can find it using Console.app - it may be under ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter or /Library/Logs/CrashReporter). There's another question here that explains How to read a crash report\n", "Q: How can I adjust the apparent color temperature of my display in OS X? I really like f.lux, which is an app that automatically adjusts the display's apparent color temperature according to the time of day and location (so that the temperature is in sync with Sun).\nHow to set the color temperature manually? I.e. without f.lux? \nSometimes I'd like to have \"tungsten\" (2700 K) colors during the day or morning, which would require fiddling with the location coordinates in f.lux. Sadly, there's no \"manual mode\" that I'm aware of.\nI'm looking for a OS X native / software based solution, that would allow me to set white point below 4500 °K, which is the minimum that Color Calibrator can set. Is this even possible?\n\nA: When using the Displays section of your System Preferences, if you calibrate it, select show advanced options, one of the windows is this:\n which to me looks like the white points you were looking for, be sure to uncheck \"Use native white point\" if you want to manually edit it.\n\nA: This solution requires F.lux to be installed (I assume it's at /Applications/Flux.app).\nCreate a text file (let's call it flux-day-color) and put it in /usr/local/bin (usr is under \"Macintosh HD\" and may be hidden).\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ ! -z \"$1\" && \"$1\" -ge 2700 && \"$1\" -le 6500 ]]; then\n  defaults write org.herf.Flux dayColorTemp -int \"$1\"\n  killall Flux\n  open /Applications/Flux.app\nelse\n  echo \"provide a temperature between 2700 and 6500 (rounded to nearest 100)\"\nfi\n\nIn Terminal, run chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/flux-day-color\nNow you can run flux-day-color 2700 in Terminal (or in another script) to change the day temperature. Note that the script restarts F.lux so you may see the display jump to 6500 K for a split second before applying your requested temperature.\nIt's also possible to schedule this to run at predefined intervals, but that's beyond the scope of this answer (and the question).\nIf you'd rather have a launchable app that can toggle between 2 temperatures,\nOpen Terminal and run these commands:\nbash\ncd /Applications/\nmkdir -p flux-day-toggle.app/Contents/MacOS\ncd flux-day-toggle.app/Contents/MacOS\ncat <<END > flux-day-toggle\n\nNow you'll see a greater than sign. Paste this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nDOMAIN=org.herf.Flux\nKEY_NAME=dayColorTemp\n\nLOW=2700\nHIGH=6500\n\ncur_val=`defaults read $DOMAIN $KEY_NAME 2>/dev/null`\nif [[ -z \"$cur_val\" || \"$cur_val\" -eq \"$HIGH\" ]]; then\n  new_val=$LOW\nelse\n  new_val=$HIGH\nfi\n\ndefaults write $DOMAIN $KEY_NAME -int $new_val\nkillall Flux\nopen /Applications/Flux.app\nEND\n\nWait for the prompt to appear, meaning the file was written.\nNow the finishing touch:\nchmod 755 flux-day-toggle\n\nNow you can launch the new app. You can customize the LOW and HIGH settings to your liking.\n\nA: Found a possible workaround for those who are interested:\nNocturne by Blacktree\n\nIt has a nice amount of options and is completely manual. Downside is it doesn't set apparent color temperature per se, but setting a white tint to RGB(255, 197, 143) has approximately the same effect as setting white point to ≈ 2600 °K (see Kelvin ⇔ RGB table on planetpixelemporium).\n\nA: Open system preferences, go to the Displays panel and choose the Color tab. Press the Calibrate... button and go through the steps. If you turn on expert mode, you will choose the white point using a slider, but if you don't you will get to choose between a few standard values. You can even do this multiple times, saving with a different name each time, and switch between them through the list in the color tab.\n\nA: A cool way is to let f.lux do the work http://stereopsis.com/flux/ It adjusts your screen colour temp. with the time of the day! Give it a try!\n", "Q: Porting Linux shell scripts The command\nshell$ ls . -R \n\nworks on Linux but not on OS X. This is because OS X command line options have to come before  the arguments,and not just anywhere as in Linux. \nIn particular, this means that any shell scripts I write on Linux will be unportable to Macs. \n Question  How can I fix this on the Mac? \nI can either take care to write portable Linux scripts, or I can install MacPorts so that  ls  and other commands will be picked from MacPorts and not the Apple provided binaries. Is there any better way?\n\nA: Short answer: whichever suits you.\nIf your Unix background is mainly from Linux, you’re probably used to GNU commands. As you’ve noticed, they can be different from other Unix/Unix-based operating systems. Depending on how complex your scripts are, you can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*make simple changes (like using ls -R . instead of ls . -R), which will work in most (if not all) Unix/Unix-based system and not only on GNU-based ones,\n\n*or install the GNU utilities from MacPorts if you think that there’d be too many/complex changes, or if you prefer to stick to the GNU commands you’re already used to.\nIf you want to take some time and write portable scripts, do it. If you think that’s not worth it, then don’t. Just bear in mind that not every Unix/Unix-based system uses GNU by default.\n", "Q: Control-F2 \"Move Focus to Menu Bar\" only works occasionally I don't want to use my trackpad too much due to a strain injury, hence I use the Control F2 \"Move Focus to Menu Bar\" a lot.\nHowever this feature only works occasionally, it can work for hours and then suddenly stop working, sometimes I can fix in the Keyboard Shortcuts pref pane by unchecking and checking the \"Move Focus to Menu Bar\" checkbox, at other times it takes a restart of the system.\n\nI'm a big Apple fan-boy, and I always marvel at the cool features in OSX, this is the first time I have a Windows-esque experience with the OSX UI :(\n\nA: When you're sure you've got your Fn key settings the way you want them and it STILL doesn't work:\nMy solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go back into Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts pane.\n\n*For the item \"Move focus to the menu bar\",\nassign a DIFFERENT function key, other than F2.\n(Something you're not using, like, say...^F9...or whatever.)\n\n*Now use THAT key instead.\nSounds kind of nuts, I know.  And it's annoying to use a different key.  But I've found that ^F2 just won't consistently work after I've been using enough 3rd party programs, particularly if they're complex.

I currently have an AirPort Express (Newest N version) that is connected to my AirPort Extreme Base Station via ethernet. I have no other use for it (printer, wifi extender, etc.) other than it being a conduit for my MacBook Pro's iTunes library to be streamed to my stereo and controlled by my iPhone, my wife's iPhone or any guests with iOS devices.\nI was thinking about selling my AirPort Express and getting a new Apple TV if I can get the same functionality as my current setup. In addition to this potential setup, I don't lose anything, but actually gain all the features of the Apple TV (Netflix, iTunes Rentals, etc.) and the possibility of jailbreaking it to run XBMC or Plex. \n\n\n*\n\n*I know the Apple TV can be controlled via the Remote app on my iPhone, but will I have to turn on the TV and wake up the Apple TV?

My current setup is AppleTV -> stereo via HDMI, and stereo -> tv via HDMI. The stereo turning on wakes up the AppleTV, but if the stereo is left on, starting to stream something via AirPlay also wakes up the AppleTV.\n", "Q: Is it possible for two users to remotely log in to a Mac simultaneously? Can two users share a Mac remotely? What software would be used?\nI'm wondering if this is a viable idea for two developers to share a Mac for app development.\n\nA: Yes - Lion makes the distinction between sharing the current screen and letting a different user log in. This brings multiple login to Mac OS X in an official way.\nWhen you connect from another Lion mac - this window shows how you can select either access method.\n\nA few VNC client apps (Like Screens for iOS and Screens for Mac supported this when Lion was released. Several popular VNC clients didn't work initially due to this change (and may need updates to work with Lion's new screen sharing method). \n\nA: If what you need is to connect to the same Mac machine with two different users in two different sessions, as Terminal Services for Windows can do, this is the answer: currently, with the default system, this is not possible. However, alongside the future Mac OS X 10.7 Lion —that will be released summer 2011— it will be possible to achieve with the updated Screen Sharing.\nIf what you need is to connect to the same Mac machine with the same user in the same session, you already can connect to that machine with any VNC client, if Screen Sharing is enabled.\n\nA: If you are using anything less than 10.7, you can enable Lion-like screen sharing with Vine Server.

You can probably tell that the mail has reached the recipient's mailbox but that is it.\n\nA: The one way you can \"sort of\" get a return receipt like you're asking for is IF the system Mac Mail is connecting to has the capability.\nFor example, you can get request receipts with MS-Exchange. If you setup Apple Mail to communicate with exchange – you probably also have access to a web-version for your email system, which will probably let you setup read receipts for the messages you send from the web client.\nBut no, if you're just using Apple Mail with a typical POP, IMAP or Mobile-Me setup you're not going to have access to a read receipt feature.\n", "Q: OS X Private Folder - Runaway file \"crash recovery\" 126.61GB!

Apparently Apple enabled multitasking gestures on the iPad in a 4.3 beta but later removed them... However those that managed to get them have maintained them through future updates (at least up to 4.3.2).\nThis site http://www.tuaw.com/2011/03/13/want-new-gesture-controls-in-ios-4-3-on-your-ipad-heres-how/ describes a way to re-enable them if you do a collection of steps and buy an app but that seems a bit drastic for basic functionality.\nAre there any other free options to re-enable this feature?\n\nA: Both the latest Xcode 3 and the latest Xcode 4 allow you to mark an iPad with the latest 4.3.x as being \"used for development\". You can cancel if asked for your developer program credentials (which cost $99) and still have access to the gesture switch on the iPad.\nXcode 4 is only available presently as a $5 download from the Mac App store or with the $99 paid Mac Developer program as a restricted download. The free developer account (which still allows you to get Xcode 3) is fairly painless to set up as long as you can agree to all the conditions. You can see the various free and paid programs at http://developer.apple.com/programs/which-program/ - it used to be simpler but the free account is still fairly powerful but not on the cutting edge with pre-release\nAs with anything that is in software development, all things subject to change often and YMMV.\n\nA: It's not basic functionality, really, it's special developer-only functionality; flipping a software switch is technically simple but it's pretty advanced (and often problematic) functionality in terms of how the OS is affected. As such your iPad has to think you're a developer before it will allow you to change the setting. \nThe two ways to convince it you're a developer: \n\n\n*\n\n*Join the paid iOS Developer Program for $99/year, download Xcode, and register your device.\n\n*Pay $5 to download Xcode and register your device.\nOnly Xcode is capable of flipping that switch, outside of (potentially) jailbreaking.\n\nA: Based on my reading of that site, it is free. You can download XCode for free. You do not need to pay $99 to join the developer program.\n\nA: You should be able to enable this functionality on a jailbroken iPad via an app in Cydia. There are several out there that do this same feature for iPod Touches and iPhone 4s as well (in case you have them).\nSee http://www.chiphazard.com/2011/04/08/enable-multitasking-gestures-on-ios-4-3-1-without-xcode-or-sn0wbreeze-jailbreak/ for nice instructions on how to enable for iOS 4.3.1.

It is a PASCAL-like procedural language owing to it's original development in the 1980's.\nIt now supports the SQL language as well.\nWhile the program is not for the faint of heart, I promise you will NOT outgrow it.\nYou will most likely be interested in the 4D Developer Standard.\nIt has everything you need to get started.\n\nA: Just like Microsoft Office includes Microsoft Access, NeoOffice includes a database application as well as part of the office suite:\nhttp://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php\nIs this what you were looking for?\n\nA: Bento is by the FileMaker team, but is super simple. It comes with a whole bunch of samples, does most of the heavy lifting for you, and has a solid database engine underneath.\nIt's available on the App Store, and for iPad too.\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bento/id413293930?mt=12\nhttp://www.filemaker.com/products/bento/\n\nA: Sorry for delay, was on vacation...\nI will edit my original short answer to give more extended answers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Original question asks about something similar to MS Access. I believe that MS Access was copied 4th Dimension, old good database from French. Its problems although IMO: pascal language, slow as access, expensive.\n\n*Bento have die just few days ago. FileMaker is similar to Access, although less powerful.\nThese two products include own db engines and they have own server versions (near to 1000-1500$).   \nOther solutions are to use database server as mySQL/PostgreSQL and some GUI Manager app. Some already was mentioned: \n\n\n*\n\n*mySQL Workbench - works only with mySQL\n\n\n*\n\n*pgAdmin - works only with PostgreSQL\n\n*Navicat - exists editions for single DB or Premium edition (~500) to all dbs\n\n*SequelPro - for mySQL only, free\nand others.  \n\n\n\nSince my first post was about Valentina Studio http://www.valentina-db.com/en/valentina-studio-overview and I was asked to provide more info, here it is. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*I have found this application in April of 2013. It has totally free edition without limits. Perfect GUI for mySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and their own Valentina DB. I am using it up to now and so far all right.\n\n*Was asked about relational support, 1:M, M:1, M:M links. All this present in Valentina Studio for all that dbs. Diagrams can be used in free edition also. \n\n*But there is no forms as in Access. Guys say they will add forms in nearest months, then this will be FileMaker killer IMO :) We'll see. Because note again, they have own Valentina db engine and Valentina Server, as FileMaker and 4D. \n\n*I very recommend to check this video introduction http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wAd1IrwKAs Notice how perfect are diagrams and Data Editor.\n\nA: Filemaker Pro will be your best bet overall. It is easier to use than Access, and will give you what you want and more. It's going to be a learning curve with anything if you're used to Access, so just jump in to one of them.\nFilemaker Pro - \nhttp://www.filemaker.com/products/filemaker-pro/\nIf you're wanting to do something SQL related though, then I'd check out the following: Sequelpro; Querious; Navicat; or MySQL Workbench.\nSequelpro is best out of all of these though, in my opinion, and it's completely free. Bam!\nhttp://www.sequelpro.com/\n\nA: Sequel Pro is a really nice GUI for working with MySQL databases. You can even connect to remote databases like you would connect to a server via ftp/ssh\nhttp://www.sequelpro.com/\n\nA: MySQL is a very popular open-source relational database. Sequel Pro (http://www.sequelpro.com) is an awesome,  free Mac app for working with MySQL. I use it every day at work. I couldn't do my job without it!\n\nA: I agree with the previous post.  \nKexi crashes too often. I installed it into VirtualBox Ubuntu running on a MacBook Pro and gave up after 30 minutes and five crashes resulting in data loss.\nLibreOffice Base is native on the Mac, similar to MS Access but has a clunky interface and very poor copy/paste. Export is a bit limited as well. You have to go through the spreadsheet, save as CSV and then import into SQLite, but at least it's possible, sort of. It has the familiar Relationships View, Query Builder and Forms but so far unable to build a form with one-to-many dropdown box, still trying it.\nMy advice is to start with LibreOffice Base.\n\nA: SQLite Professional is a good option and should do what your looking for. Its a SQLite frontend that will allow you to import csv files and execute queries on the results. I should note that I'm the developer.\n\nA: Bento by Filemaker may be able to do this.\n\nA: Why not MySQL with MySQL Workbench?\nIt's an amazing GUI, you can of course view and edit the databases contents, but also create databases graphically with all kinds of relationships. It's worth checking it out:\n\n\nA: I would suggest looking at the latest offering from QSA Toolworks - they've taken over Helix an incredible relational database that doesn't use any coding whatsoever. Helix (the product) comes in a number of variants Helix RADE (Rapid Application Development Environment), Helix Engine (to allow databases to be used by those who don't have the Helix RADE element), there's also Helix Server and Helix Client. Check out http://www.qsatoolworks.com. This product has been running on Mac since 1983!\n\nA: Symphytum\nA personal database software for everyone who desires to manage and organize data in an easy and intuitive way, without having to study complex database languages and software user interfaces.\nPortofino\nA free and open source web framework that helps developers create outstanding enterprise applications by addressing three specific needs: productivity, features and architecture. A wizard allows the developer to create a web application by connecting to an existing database quickly and easily.\nKexi\nConsidered as a long awaited Open Source competitor for Microsoft Access, Filemaker and Oracle Forms. Kexi is an integrated data management application. Its development is motivated by the lack of Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools for database systems that are sufficiently powerful, inexpensive, open standards driven and portable across many operating systems and hardware platforms. It runs on OS X with Fink.\n\nA: check out http://servoy.com/ _____________________ \n", "Q: Turn on/off Portrait Orientation, Depending on the Time of Day Compared to the iPad, the Touch's orientation lock is quite clunky. Oh well, I say. I only use it twice a day, on at 10pm and off at 7am—the time I spend in bed with the little gadget.\nBut it gets clunky, like I said, and it'd be nice to realize that it's nighttime and I'm likely in bed, drinking water and trying to sleep, and turn on orientation lock.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: This is certainly not possible with the stock software provided by the iOS and I haven't seen any application in the AppStore that does such thing. Should be \"relatively\" easy to do, but I'm not sure who'd want a software like that (other than you) ;)\nEDIT: Now that I think about this, I'm not sure if the API for controlling that is public or private. If the later, then you can't really create an app that \"modifies\" the Phone's Settings, so my best guess is that you'd be out of luck.\n\nA: This Jailbreak application will do exactly what you want:\nhttp://thebigboss.org/2010/02/12/sbschedule-sbsettings-profile-manager\n", "Q: How do I prevent my iPod nano's screen from going to sleep? I have broken my desk clock and am trying to use my square nano to show me time instead.\nThe problem is that when I set the screen to show time and leave it for some time the screen dims and eventually shuts off after which I have to get the screen back again by going to the menu.\nIs there a way to make sure that the screen does not turn off? Dimming should be okay to save power, but it should at least show the time when I touch the screen.\n\nA: Go to the stop watch and press start, now slide back to the watch face and it should stay on.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no a way to prevent the iPod nano from going to sleep mode.  \n\nA: There is a way but I still haven't tested it there is a menu called iTerm on the ipod nano 6g.You can enter it by clicking all buttons at once.Wait a few seconds and it will appear then you enter \"power\"--->\"power drain mode\" and it shoud keep the screen from locking.Of course it won't last long because the battery will be completly used-up.This is for more information.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA9qcY-G3O0\n\nA: This works for me with my BOSE docking station.\n\n\n*\n\n*Play music on loop\n\n*Open Clock\n\n\nThe iPod stays running. \n\nA: Settings>General>Date and time>Turn on the \"Time on wake\" feature.\nConnect a headphone jack. Plug in charger. Play a song.  Press the power button once to turn the screen off and then again press it to bring the clock on. Now the clock should stay on even after you die as long as you dont disconnect the charger and the headphone jack . Cheers!\nThank me later.\nAdded tip: You can connect a broken headphone jack if you dont intend to listen to songs, to avoid the hassle of headphone wires.\n\nA: Best answer I found was to let it go to sleep (save battery power) but set the power on button to bring up the clock first (in clock setting menu).\nNote that if you then look at the music, for example, it will reset it back to show music first even though the switch says clock.\n\nA: Connect your iPod, browse the device (E:) and then in the direction bar type \"ipod_control\".\nYou will get into the Ipod_Control folder then change the properties so you can see all the hidden folders (Right-Click > Properties > Uncheck the Hidden box).\nThen enter de Device Folder and you will se a file called \"iPodSettings\" open it on note pad.\nAnd just simply search for the Energy Saver <EnergySaver>1</EnergySaver> and change the value to 0, Save the file and that's it your iPod now will never enter to SleepMode again. \n", "Q: How to make items copied into a folder respect its permissions? I shared a folder of pictures on my OSX 10.6 MacBook with my wife, who accesses it from her 10.5 MacBook.\nI created an account for her and gave her read/write permissions on the folder (via the Get Info).  However, when Image Capture dumps new images into the folder, they aren't readable or writeable by her.  I have to click 'Apply To Enclosed Items' for her to get access to them.\nI want any file created or copied into that folder to be automatically readable and writeable by her.  Is there a way to set this up?\nThanks!\n\nA: There's an option for and access control entry (the thing you created in Get Info) to be inherited, but Get Info doesn't give you the option to enable it.  Also, you'll want to make sure you have full access to items she's added/edited there, and the easiest way to do this is to create a group for the two of you, and allow access to all group members.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a group (in System Preferences -> Accounts pane), and check the boxes to make both yourself and your wife members.\n\n*Open the Terminal utility, and run the command:\nchmod +a \"group:admin allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" /path/to/the/folder\n\n(replacing /path/to/the/folder with the unix-style path to the folder you want to grant access to.  If you aren't sure what that is, just paste in the rest of the line, including the space before /path/to/the/folder, and then drag-and-drop the folder from the Finder into the Terminal window, and it'll paste in the path for you.)\n\n*The access control entry you just created will be applied to new files and subfolders created inside that folder, but won't apply to the files and subfolders that're already there.  So, Get Info on the folder and use the Apply to enclosed items option to apply it to the existing items.\n\nA: I am not familiar with OS X per se, but this is more a problem with Unix's non-ability to allow you to set default permissions.  And because OS X is based off of Unix, they have similar problems.  There are a few workarounds, but they all take a lot of setup time.  Try looking for inherit permissions linux to see some solutions.  \nThe problem is that Unix uses umask (default permissions for files and folders) when new files/folders are created.  An article on a possible work around is here: http://web.archive.org/web/20180809020449/www.bashguru.com/2010/03/creating-user-group-and-shared.html\n", "Q: Is it possible to have a Mac drive a display as a mirror image (and not simply rotated) I need to flip the screen of Mac X 10.4 either vertically or horizontally. I should emphasis that I do not want to rotate 180 degree I want to have mirrored output. Is there any way of driving a Mac's display as a mirror image (and not simply rotated)?\nSeveral answers have jumped on rotation, so please don't confuse rotation with actual flipping. A mirror image (either vertical or horizontal) distorts text in a similar manner to taking a sheet of nearly transparent paper and literally flipping it so you see the words from behind the paper.\nHere is an illustration of rotation (not what this question seeks)\n: rotate display 90, 180 or 270 degrees.\n\nWhat I seek is horizontal display flip.\n\n\nA: Do you need to flip an built-in display (like on an iMac or MacBook), or an external display?\nI'm afraid it's only possible to flip an external display. Here's how to do that (tested with 10.6, but 10.4 should be similar):\nGo to System Preferences-> Displays. Go to the Display tab of your external monitor's window. For Rotation: select either 90 or 270.\nYou can still mirror your displays.\n", "Q: Trigger 'Gather Windows' programmatically (or other quick way) I'm trying to make myself a little script that I can run on the fly that gathers all my open windows onto the main display.\nI think a good starting place would be to be able to trigger Gather Windows (as seen in System Preferences-> Displays) by a shell script, AppleScript, or Automator action.\nCan anyone either tell me how to do the above, or point me at a utility that will let me bind a key to do gather windows (freeware preferred)?\n\nA: Use AppleScript Editor to save the following as script or application:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.displays\"\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\" to tell first window to click button \"Gather Windows\"\n    quit\nend tell\n\nMake sure you have enabled support for assistive devices in System Preferences » Universal Access.\n\nA: This article includes an AppleScript that gathers all windows.  \nIt's the only programmatic way I know of to mimic the behaviour of the \"gather windows\" command in System Preferences.\n\nA: Have you looked at the following list to see if any of these do what you want?\nWhat Window Management Options exist for OS X?\n", "Q: iphone sleeps in recovery mode i am trying to restore 4.3.1 custom firmware made by sn0wbrzee with expert mode.\nat the last moment of restore itunes shows 1015 error. so i try to reboot, but iphone not rebooted.\nat last I jailbrak with redsnow and iphone rebotted and i see my firmware was 4.3.1 with bb 6.15.00, but after 10 mints it sleep forever.\nafter this situation i tried for hours and hours by various method.but no result i get.\nand now when i try restore it by itune during recovery mode, i tune shows 1601 error during the step \" preparing iphone for restore \"\nplease help. i become hopeless. also please say can i get back my lovely i phone, or i lost forever this.\n\nA: This should help resolve the error 1015:\nhttp://iphonerumors.blogspot.com/2010/11/bypassing-itunes-1004-1015-error-when.html\n", "Q: In Finder's List view, is there a keyboard shortcut to go to top/bottom of list? Before Leopard, hitting the Spacebar would take you to the bottom file in List view -- but that now initiates QuickLook. As far as I know there has never been a keyboard shortcut to go to the top of the list. Or am I just ignorant?\n\nA: Yep!  You can use opt-↑ to jump to the top of the list and opt-↓ to jump to the bottom.\n\nA: Control-Option-Up and Control-Option-Down appear to work in El Capitan.\n\nA: In macOS Big Sur (Version 11), when viewing items in list view in Finder, the keyboard shortcut  Control-Option-Up Arrow selects the first/top item in the list and the keyboard shortcut Control-Option-Down Arrow selects the last/bottom item in the list. These keyboard shortcuts do not work in icon view.\n\nA: In MacOS Monterey, the best shortcut is +⬅️ (fn+left arrow) to scroll to the top in list view or icon view in finder. fn+arrows can also page up or down, or scroll to the bottom in finder. These also work in other apps like Safari, Chrome and any apps with scrollable content.\nThis likely also works in Big Sur and earlier MacOS releases as well, like Mojave, High Sierra, Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite, etc because I've known about this for a long time.

I think once you do this and re-sync your ipad a lot of your problems (that you have posted about on here today) will be resolved.\n\nA: Restoring is far too drastic for this issue until all other avenues are reasonably explored. if resetting network settings (under settings) or a simple reset doesn't fix it (power off by holding sown sleep button and holding it again to turn back on), looking into wifi network issues would be the next step.

How could I solve this problem.\n\nA: This page from Apple details how to charge an iPad.  It recommends plugging it into either the 10w Power Adaptor that comes with the iPad or a high powered USB 2 port.  Some USB2 ports are not high powered and will either not charge the ipad or only trickly charge it very slowly.\nThis article details how long it should take to charge the iPad with various techniques.  As you can see charging the iPad with the charger it comes with takes about 3 hours (to 80% capacity).\nIf you are not getting satisfactory charge times (and are using the recommended chargers), then you should book to have your iPad checked out at an authorized Apple repair centre or Apple Store.\n", "Q: Do I really need an iPhone 4? I have an iMac for day to day use, with LaCie backup, and a MacBook Pro for use on the road, also with LaCie backup, and a mobile phone, too, of course. I do not care much for the mobile phone I have (a 2 year old Motorola model), so I am thinking about swapping it for an iPhone.\nBut I don't want to swap the Motorola thingie for yet another gadget that I won't like. So, iPhone fans, tell me, what's to like about the iPhone? What will it give me that I don't have between my mobile and my MacBook Pro?\n\nA: The iPhone (apart from the obvious phone/messaging features), will give you an ultra-portable computing device to carry around with you when you are not near your iMac or don't want to open the Macbook Pro.  \nThis will give you the ability to check your emails, browse websites, listen to music, watch podcasts and even record and edit videos.  You will also be able to read books and take part in the eco-system of hundreds of thousands of 3rd party applications that available on the Apple App Store.\nBest of all, because all your devices are from Apple, you benefit from not only knowing how most of these items work and are configured, but the huge benefit of interoperability.  You most probably have your music in iTunes already, so you're music can be synced with your new iPhone.  Your web bookmarks are probably already in Safari, so can be synced with Safari on the iPhone.\n", "Q: OS X Server FTP server I'm running an OS X Server with the following services turned on: Web, MySQL, DNS, AFP, Firewall. I'd like to also start FTP, and I did this, but I can't seem to make it work properly. I'm sure there is a way, but I can't find a way to make it work for me.\nWhat I've done so far: - activated the FTP service - opened port 20-21 in the Firewall - forwarded ports 20-21 from the router to the Server\nI use Coda to connect to my FTPs (as I do a lot of web development). When I type in this server's address + credentials it tries to connect for about 2-3 minutes before actually succeeding, and when it does it lists the following directories: \"Public\" (with a shortcut icon), \"Users\" (with a shortcut icon) and a file named \"???\" which it tries to open right away. Doing [cmd + k] in Finder also results in a 2-3 minutes waiting.\nAlso, I have no idea where to create new users for the FTP (just for the FTP) and how to give them permissions to specific directories (without useless ones like \"Users\" or \"Public\").\nI've come to the conclusion that the built-in FTP server might not be the best option for me, but I have no idea what I should try. Using a separate app is not the ideal scenario for me as I'm trying to avoid keeping extra apps open on my server.\n\nA: I suggest you use what comes with OSX, namely sftp/scp, included with every OSX since the age of dawn. \nEnable SSH in the sharing (Remote Login), configure what users have access and then try to use sftp from the Terminal (if you are familiar with it). Try \nman sftp\n\nto see the help. \n\nDESCRIPTION\n       sftp is an interactive file transfer program, similar to ftp(1), which\n       performs all operations over an encrypted ssh(1) transport. \n\nYou have the benefits of \"ftp-like\" plus everything is encrypted. \nIf you still want to go ahead and use ftp, I suggest you take a look at ftpd conf file, located in /etc/ftpd.conf and /etc/ftpusers \nIn any case, take a look at the man page for ftpd.conf and ftpusers:\nman ftpd.conf\nman ftpusers\n\n…to see other options you can add there (because the default one will be most likely empty or with little things in it).\nThere's no pretty program to configure FTP on OSX (there is on the Server version as far as I can remember).\nPlease note that FTP is not a very secure protocol by default and hence it should be running inside a chroot. (hint: man ftpchroot).\n\nA: I would go with vsftpd. Some time ago I wrote about setting up vsftpd on Mac OS X.\n\nA: Give Rumpus a try. Much easier FTP server solution with a very easy to use GUI, but its still got tonnes of options. We use it at work to deliver content to clients and also to receive content from providers. Extremely easy to use, but is also very configurable. \n(my second post in a row about rumpus... dont worry, they dont pay me, just a very happy customer!)\n", "Q: When I power off the iPod, and restart it, does it re-open all previously open applications? On the last week I powered off the iPod at least once per day, but today I noticed that in the multitasking tray there were applications I have not used in the past weeks. Are those applications running, or the tray simply list them because I used them?\nIf those applications are really running, is there a way to stop the iPod from running the same applications that were running before I powered it off?\n\nA: These applications are not necessary \"running\".  The multi-tasking tray doubles as a \"recently used\" list.   So although you may not have run these applications in the past week, they are listed in the order they last ran (however long ago that was).\nSo, to answer your question, no the iPod doesn't restart all previously open applications.\n\nA: They are not really running - but many of them are basically just 'images' of memory for the application. As part of the quick-switching and resuming feature that was brought as part of iOS 4's multitasking - they store images of their memory then stop execution to not use other resources. Then when you switch to them, they can relaunch from their saved state. \nWhen you restart the iPod, usually the apps that register themselves as using this type of multitasking will show up in that tray because either they have this memory image still stored, or the OS loads them as 'available' switch-to processes because it knows they support that. \nAs Rob said - it is also usually in the order of when you last used them.\n", "Q: Workflow for dealing with incoming files to keep the file system tidy?

File and information manager. Quite powerful. http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/\n\nA: There is a utility to help deal with automatically organizing incoming files called Hazel.\n\nA: What you need is DEVONthink. DEVONthink can help you organize your files in its database. When you have a new file in the filesystem, you simply drag it to the “sorter”, the inbox of the database.\nAfter DEVONthink collects the file, it can apply auto classification rules and automatically group the file according to a group you defined. It can also tag the file just like iPhoto organizes photos.\n\nA: I use Hazel which you can download with a 14 day trial\n\nHazel watches whatever folders you tell it to, automatically\n  organizing your files according to the rules you create.

Command+Option+i will open the Multiple Item Info panel that should set the permissions for all files that have been selected (it also gives you total file size, and lets set label colors too).\nOtherwise you can select the folder the files you want to change are in, and use the regular get info window to set permissions on all containing files.\n\n\nA: Checkout BatChmod a free utility for changing file permissions. You can select a folder that contains the files you’re interested in, make the changes and apply those changes to all of the files in the folder.\n\nA: On Catalina, you can't use the above solutions. What you can do is select the folder in which all images are located, go to the usual get info and change permissions for the folder. Once you are done with that, click on the lock icon and get administrator access to change permissions. Once you enter your password, click on the small gear icon at the bottom of the get info window and select \"Apply to enclosed items\". Tested on Catalina. \n\nA: The Finder isnt able to natively change permissions of multiple selected files.\nThere is a 3rd party file manager application called Folklift2 which does have the ability to do this (amongst other things).

There may be applications available if you have a jailbroken phone.\nThere is products such as thecallrecordercard that may be off assistance, in that they allow you to record voice calls by using your iPhone and their service.\n\nA: Be aware that there are significant legal restrictions on recording phone calls, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction -- make sure you know what they are and follow them. For example, in most US states, you need to notify the other party they are being recorded and/or get their consent (Google can find you the specifics).\n\nA: Unfortunately, no native or simple way to do this - unlike many other phones.\nI believe one option might be using the speaker and any voice recorder, such as the Voice Memo built in app. Despite some limitations it could be enough if you don't care about the sound quality.\nSee if SpoofApp fits your needs. It's one of the first recording call apps out there, as already pointed out in another possible duplicate question, and it even moved from being on Cydia to the Apple Store. The app is free, the call recording is not as it's a \"complicated made simple\" service.\nIf you're fine with recording just VOIP calls, which can be done for free and within your device without needing to call a 3rd party number, try Mobile VOIP.\n\nA: Perhaps there is something out there to intercept the conversation on the hardware level using the headphone jack? Some kind of passthrough device you would plug into the headphone jack and then you plug your mic-equipped headphones into said device. There has to be something out like that.\n\nA: I have used a service in the past to record phone conversations\nthey were very helpful and did a great job in setting me up with a good solution. \n", "Q: Is there any app to copy Ctrl+C any text from Desktop (Windows) and paste Ctrl+V in iphone at anywhere?

This may help with your problem.\n\nA: You could use the built in Text Replacement and change ss to s, aa to a, etc. Fairly time intensive and doesn't really allow a good input of double characters, you would have to right click and uncheck substitution to type the word egg.\n\nA: There's a setting called Slow Keys, in the Universal Access panel of System Preferences. It appears to add a delay to prevent people with shaky fingers from typing repeated keystrokes. Looks like there is some speed adjustment settings but I've never used it before.

You can obtain binchunker via Homebrew or Macports.\nHere's some more info from the manpage:\nbchunk - CD image format conversion from bin/cue to iso/cdr\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       bchunk [-v] [-p] [-r] [-w] [-s] <image.bin> <image.cue> <basename>\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       bchunk converts a CD image in a \".bin / .cue\" format (sometimes \".raw / .cue\") to a set of .iso and .cdr tracks.\n\n       The  bin/cue  format is used by some non-Unix cd-writing software, but is not supported on most other cd-writing pro-\n       grams.\n\n       image.bin is the raw cd image file. image.cue is the track index file containing track types and  offsets.   basename\n       is used for the beginning part of the created track files.\n\n       The  produced .iso track contains an ISO file system, which can be mounted through a loop device on Linux systems, or\n       written on a CD-R using cdrecord.  The .cdr tracks are in the native CD audio format. They can be either written on a\n       CD-R using cdrecord -audio, or converted to WAV (or any other sound format for that matter) using sox.\n\n       It  is  advisable  to  edit  the  .cue  file to either MODE2/2352/2048 or MODE2/2352/2324 depending on whether an ISO\n       filesystem or a VCD is desired, respectively.  The format itself does not contain this feature and  in  an  ambiguous\n       case it can only guess.\n\n\nA: Stuffit Expander (Select StuffIt Expander Only if you want to download it from that site, dont get any adware crap) can open bin files, and from what I remember cue files are just information maps about bin files. \nI forget if you can view them as Volumes, but that seems like a secondary concern, converting them is a lengthy process if you have more than a few files.\n\nA: Have you tried Control+Click (right click) on the .bin file and open with Disk Utility?\n\nA: I've just used Unarchiver and its extracted all the files in the .bin and i've been able to get the .wmv files that way.\n\nA: You can get Daemon tools free trial for OSX to mount bin file.\n", "Q: Why is cron being deprecated? I just found out that cron has been deprecated in Mac OS X. Why is this, and will it eventually be completely removed from future releases?\n\nA: I don't even know if cron has been deprecated. man crontab seems to indicate that it hasn't:\n\n(Darwin note: Although cron(8) and crontab(5) are officially supported under Darwin, their functionality has been absorbed into launchd(8), which provides a more flexible way of automatically executing commands.  See launchctl(1) for more information.)\n\nDaemons and Services Programming Guide says that it has been deprecated though:\n\nNote: Although it is still supported, cron is not a recommended solution. It has been deprecated in favor of launchd.\n\ncrontab is also required by POSIX, and OS X is supposed to be SUS compliant.\nIn any case, cron won't probably stop working any time soon, and I don't know if it can be said to be slower or less secure than launchd. The cron process should use almost no CPU time or memory. Some advantages of using or learning cron are that it is also available on other platforms, and the configuration format is simpler.\n\nA: With the release of Mac OS 10.4, launchd was chosen to supersede cron in Mac OS. Here's a cached version of the launchd page from the Apple Developer Connection in 2005. It explains why cron was deprecated, as well as the benefits of launchd from Apple's perspective.\nThe summary: launchd was created to not just replace cron but also init, xinetd for better performance, and better control over configuration and the actual tasks themselves.\n\nThe launchd daemon offers a single, standardized, interface to any and all programs started automatically by the system. Furthermore, the configuration files that determine when to run a given program can also specify resource limits and environment variables, which simplifies setup and security for many programs. The same configuration file format is used whether a job is launched once at system startup or user login, on demand over the network, or at intervals.\n\n\nA: cron still ships on macOS 11 Big Sur, but that being said...\nThe wikipedia article on launchd has a very good summary, extended discussions as well as some great videos and external links for a deeper dive into this decision by Apple.\nIn a nutshell, launchd replaces 7 major tasks and a boatload of scripts (inetd, init and rc and associated shell script structures, crond, atd, watchdogd, SystemStarter) with one much more powerful open sourced tool.\nWhy:\n\n*\n\n*faster due to optimized control of launching and delayed launches until needed, more sophisticated sequences of actions are now possible\n\n*handles power efficiency concerns more in tune with new CPU design\n\n*more powerful overall than the old tools\n\n*unified and centralized process control\n\n*more secure by design\n\nWhen: 29 April 2005 (When OS X Tiger was released for sale)\nThere's nothing from preventing us all from using launchd to start cron now on Tiger, Leopard or Snow Leopard.\nShould future Apple stop shipping /usr/sbin/cron, it will surely end up like wget and other mature open source tools that get compiled and need to be added as a separate command line tool.\n\nA: Others have already answered why cron was superseded. As for the other question:\n\nwill it eventually be completely removed from future releases?\n\ncron is a required utility/service of the POSIX and Unix standards. Thus, there are only two circumstances under which cron would actually be removed from macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple decides that being an officially certified Unix system is not worth their time (unlikely)\n\n*cron gets removed from the Single Unix Specification (even less likely)\n\n\nIf one of those two things happens, then you might need to feel some urgency about porting your crontabs to launchctl services. Or just compile an open source cron and run it on macOS in order to run your crontabs.\n", "Q: Is Mac Right For Win Programmer? I'm considering a Mac purchase but I don't know if it is right for me.\nI use laptops and PCs mostly for programming, most of my time I develop in C# on Windows and Mono Linux (I'm considering to develop on Linux and test if they run on Win), other than that I use Java, Python, C, and Ruby (this is my hobby and freelance projects)\nI would also from time to time play some games.\nSo my current focus is to do my work on Linux (I'm having a hard time to switch) and do fun like games on Windows. But the Linux learning curve compared to Win is rather high.\nSo is Mac right for me?\nWhat's the learning curve compared to Linux switch from Win?\nNow I know that most if not all software dev platforms are for Mac, but can I use a VM to test Win capability? And are there any cost relating the dev tools for Mac that integrate tightly with the OS?\nCan I play games on this (e.g Civ 5, Hitman & others)?\nI'm considering a MacBook Pro with i5 (i7s are way too expensive on the mac).\n\nA: This is subjective but my opinion is:\nIf you are programming in C#, you should use Windows as Mono does not give all that is in Microsoft's version, especially if your users are on Windows.\nThere are several VMs: Fusion, Parallels and Virtual Box that can run Windows. \nOS X is Unix so is like Linux, so the learning curve will be similar to Linux although most Apple users think the GUI is better and easier to use. \nMono will run as well as on Linux.\nFor games, OS X has more than Linux but much less than Windows and running games in a VM will be slow.\nThus why do you want to leave Windows?\n", "Q: Using an iPad as a car entertainment system I am thinking about using iPads with headrest mounts to allow my toddlers to watch videos while we drive. I'd really like to be able to control the iPad from the front seat if at all possible, so that we don't have to get into the back seat and do things like slide to unlock, press play/pause, adjust the volume, etc.\nAre there any devices that could be used to remotely control the iPad from the front seat in this fashion?\n\nA: There is nothing that steps into the iPad at a low enough level as to simulate a swipe to unlock. Even the external keyboard connector could be extended, but that won't allow total control of the device even if you could operate things without seeing the display. There is no concept of a mouse or pointing device in the iOS or the iPad hardware.\nYou might want to consider a generic LCD panel / speaker system and an iPod touch or iPad with a cable that will reach to the front seats. You could queue up the entertainment and use the video out to present it to the passengers in the back until such time as they can learn iOS and be trusted to hold the iPad. It won't take long for that to happen or for them to show you every hidden feature you never knew existed or could be enabled in the iPad.\nThis use case screams for an AirPlay video receiver but those aren't shipping yet even in the living room.\n\nA: Slide to Unlock (as bmike mentioned) might be impossible.\nWhat you could take a look at is are the various DLNA / UPnP applications for iPhone/iPad. These would allow you to set the movie to be played and play/pause it of course.\nAlso, you could consider a iPad mount that supports IR headphones so you wouldn't be distracted by your kids entertainment on the back seat. (I'm not supposed to make advertisement, but you could Bing for iPad Mount with IR headphones).\n\nA: I can think of one way that you might have success, but it's pretty hacky and requires an additional iDevice, some method of connecting the three together wirelessly (either adhoc mode, an iPhone with tethering, or any of the other solutions out there that let up to five devices talk to each other), and the iPads must be jailbroken.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Veency from Cydia\n\n*Install VNC client on your iDevice up front\n\n*Make sure all the iDevices are on the same network (i.e., not each on a 3G connection, but either adhoc'd to each other or to another portable router/3G modem)\n\n*Remote into each iPad as desired via your VNC client. It's not pretty, but once you start the movie, you can stop controlling the iPad. You have control over pretty much everything (including the lock screen, IIRC), as well as volume (via the multi-tasking bar) IIRC, and definitely control over the apps running and videos playing. \n\n\nAll that said, I don't know of any way to keep the kids from playing with the iPad and getting places you don't want them to be (say, Settings), but the above is a start.\n\nA: Friend of mine uses BMW NBT (it supports DLNA) and ArkMC on iPhone. Now he able to stream music from device to car entertainment system. \n", "Q: iPad's Mail won't check for new messages in folders I have a number of folders and filtering rules on my various e-mail accounts (Gmail, personal email, company email, etc). The problem is that the Mail app only checks for e-mail on the \"received messages\" folder.\nThat folder is where unfiltered messages end up on, and the app does check that. The other structured folders, where the filtered messages go, are only checked when I enter them manually.\nIs there any way to automate the checking of e-mails for all the folders on your e-mail accounts?\n\nA: Short of getting a different mail client on your iPad I can get you more than half of the way there.\nSet up gmail as Microsoft Exchange server (leave the domain blank, add user and password and let it try to connect. When it fails, use m.google.com for the server and you can choose mail, calendar, address data to use ActiveSync)\nOnce the first mail sync starts, you can then choose days to sync and which subfolders will have push enabled. The mail badge count still only reflects unread messages in the Inbox, but you will get the mail notification sound/vibration for any new push message arriving in your selected subfolders. Your iOS device will be ready to go when you tap into the folders that have new push messages.\n\n", "Q: Help: spotlight can't see Firefox in Applications folder? (FYI, I'm using Snow Leopard.)  I used to launch Firefox using spotlight by just typing \"Firefox\" to locate it.  Since I didn't launch Firefox often, I didn't want it in my dock, so I just got in that habit.\nFor some reason, starting last week, spotlight can no longer find Firefox.  I type \"firefox\" and I get results (emails, jar files, and so on), but no Firefox.app.  It's still there, though, sitting my Applications folder and it launches fine when I click on it.\nDid I do something to break spotlight?  And how should I fix this?\nThanks, Rob\n\nA: This has helped on a lot of macOS boxes I've worked on (10.14, 10.15 Catalina beta 1, beta 2, beta 3 and beta 4), perhaps for different reasons now in 2019 than when OP originally asked the question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal/iTerm and run:\n\n*sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Firefox.app\n\n*Authenticate with your admin password.\nYour download was tagged by a macOS security mechanism as potentially dangerous, so the extended attribute com.apple.quarantine was set.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Since the OS didn't ask for user confirmation, the xattr was most probably already removed, but only from the top level package Firefox.app itself, but not its contents. \n\n*This is at least one scenario where an App  \n\n\n*\n\n*can be launched without user confirmation, but \n\n*Spotlight refuse to index. \n\n\n\nSee superuser.com/what-should-i-do-about-com-apple-quarantine for more.\n\nA: You can rebuild the total spotlight database by adding your entire drive to the privacy pane in system preferences. Although that might be needed, you could try just adding and then deleting the folder than contains Firefox to see if that helps. This avoids missing all spotlight results while the entire process completes. A rebuild could take anything from 3 to 12 hours, depending on several factors.\nDo be sure it's missing by showing all results - if it's not a top hit, rebuilding won't help. In that case try moving it into /Applications or perhaps looking into alternate app launchers (like LaunchBar) that allow you more control over where apps can be stores and more control over regenerating indexes. \n\nA: Erasing free space on the HD loses the Spotlight database; there are probably other ways too.  The terminal command \n\nsudo mdutil -i on \"/Volumes/<disk-volume-name>\"\n\nwill rebuild it.\n", "Q: My MacBook no longer connects to my iMac via screen sharing I have an iMac and a MacBook running Snow Leopard.\nI used to connect from my MacBook to my iMac regularly with screen sharing.  Has worked great for over a year.\nI recently got my hard drive in my iMac upgraded (from 250GB to 1TB), as far as I know the technician somehow \"cloned\" the drive, but I really have no idea what the process is.  All I know is the iMac works exactly as it did before, it now has a bigger drive,  except that screen sharing no longer works.\nThere were two \"admin\" accounts on the iMac.  \"rob\" and \"user\" (user was created by the technician during the hard drive upgrade.\nWhen I connect via screen sharing with \"rob/correctpassword\" it says something like \"connect failure, can't verify password\".  As a work around I would try \"user/blankpassword\", same error, then try again with \"rob/correctpassword\" and it would work.  I had to do this same thing every time to connect.  Rob-fail, User-fail, Rob-success.\nEventually I deleted the \"user\" account because I never used it, and now I can never connect as \"rob\".  Screen sharing is on, and like I said, this always worked before, but there's an authentication error every time.\nDoes anyone have ideas what's wrong, or suggestions for how to fix this?\n\nA: Things that have helped me with isolating the failure and eventually getting screen sharing working again:\n\n\n*\n\n*isolate the network - turn off\nWiFi and connect the two machines\nwith one ethernet cable. This\neliminates ports (other than\ninternal firewalls), DNS, and\nnetwork issues from mis-routing the\ntraffic.\n\n*Turn off screen sharing and remote management and set it up again changing the password to be sure the new password and sharing permissions are set for all users or your specific user.\n\n*Watch the logs in console app - the bonjour daemons, screen sharing daemons and network errors are all logged so you might get a clue if a program is having problems accessing a keychain or other issue\n\n*Add in a new user to isolate the desired user's preferences and files - it could be something corrupt in the desired user and you won't catch that unless you make a new account to isolate that potential cause.\n\n\nA: I have an identical set-up to you and Screenshare all the time. Here is what I've discovered that can stop Screensharing working (I have to reboot my router to fix these issues)\n(1) If I can see my iMac from my MacBook under the Shared tab (on the MacBook) and the device is identified as 'iMac', then Screensharing works. If the iMac shows up as 'imac' then Screensharing doesn't work. (Server address is afp://iMac.local when I check under Finder>Go>Connect to server when everything is working)\nI've just assumed there's a bug in the Linksys router that occasionally causes the problem, and I suppose a quick reboot fixing the problem is easier that discovering the real cause and fixing it once and for all.\nI should add that even when I can't Screenshare both the MacBook and iMac continue to have internet access: it's just that they can't talk to each other, which sounds like a device table problem in the router to me.\nI use the same fix if I attempt to Connect to the iMac by double clicking iMac under Shared on the MacBook, and then clicking the Connect button. If the router is working then I get the Connect authorization dialog into which I put the login name and password for the iMac. If the router doesn't want to connect me, I reboot the wretched thing and away we go.\nYou may have your accounts and passwords screwed up. If you are the admin and you can login without a password, then the  Connect dialog can be responded to with just your login name. Revisit the Account setup  in System Preferences.\nSorry this is a bit rambling.. it's late here and I'm tired! Best of luck\n\nA: Sometimes when drives get cloned over their permissions files can get messed up. I would recommend a) resetting the vnc password in system preferences. and b) checking your permissions using disk utility. Don't be alarmed if a lot of them are wrong, they're easily fixed\n", "Q: WiFi problem after 4.3.2 jailbreak I've just jailbroken my iPhone (3Gs, 5.13.04, iOS 4.3.2, Pwnage Tool 4.3.2). \nNow I'm experiencing troubles with WiFi, so I can't do an unlock. I have an AirPort Express router, it works well with other devices, the iPhone does have connection with the router (in the Settings -> Wifi menu there is a checkmark in front of my network) but there is no indication of WiFi connection and none of my applications see this connection.\nHow can I solve this problem?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I've found a solution, it is not pretty clear, but it works. \nFirst, I've rebooted my router\nSecond, in Settings -> General -> Network I've set Cellular Data and Enable 3G to OFF. After that operation WiFi indicator appeared and everything went well. \nHope it helps to those who experience the same problem.\n", "Q: How can I disable Bluetooth A2DP profiles on the iPhone 4? Simple question: I'd like to disable the A2DP profile for either (a) specific devices paired with the iPhone or (b) the profile entirely from the phone. How can I disabled the A2DP profiles? There used to be a program called Bluetooth Profile Selector for jailbroken iPhones. However, it stopped working after 4.3.1.\nHere's the detailed scenario on why:\nI have a stereo in my car that accepts a USB connector. This is how my iPhone is connected and plays music through. This way the audio quality is pristine, I can see the track information and control my iPhone from the headunit, and it charges my iPhone.\nThe headunit also pairs via Bluetooth for hands-free calling. However, because the iPhone supports A2DP, this is how it pairs to the headunit. I can do hands-free calling just fine, however it screws up the audio coming from the dock connector. Basically, the iPhone will begin playing music via the dock connector until it auto-pairs with the headunit. At this point, the iPhone automatically changes the output method to the Bluetooth connection. Manually changing this back over to the dock connector every single time is not something I wish to deal with.\n\nA: The app you are referring to has a manual process you can try, but it is not for the faint of heart: http://blog.ramondeklein.nl/?p=257\n\nHowto disable A2DP on the iPhone\nThe interesting directory is\n  /var/mobile/Library/Preferences, where\n  the iPhone stores the BlueTooth\n  settings. These settings are stored in\n  the PLIST format, so you need a PLIST\n  editor (Mac or PC) or you need to\n  convert them by hand. Transfer the\n  com.apple.MobileBluetooth.services.plist\n  to your computer or you can use iFile\n  to edit the file on your iPhone\n  directly.\nOpen the\n  com.apple.MobileBluetooth.services.plist\n  in your PLIST editor and make sure you\n  edit the A2DPService section and store\n  the devices you don’t want to use A2DP\n  in the UnauthorizeList (without the\n  letter “d”). This dictionary will\n  probably not exist yet, so you need to\n  add it by hand. You need to know the\n  MAC address, but it is probably listed\n  already in this file.\n<key>A2DPService</key>\n<dict>\n  <key>State</key>\n  <true/>\n  <key>UnauthorizeList</key>\n  <dict>\n    <key>00:10:60:D0:91:D0</key>        <!-- This is the MAC address -->\n    <date>2009-08-08T01:00:00Z</date>   <!-- Timestamp -->\n  </dict>\n</dict>\n\nTransfer the PLIST file back to your iPhone and reboot the device. Once it gets back on,  then the A2DP service should be disabled.\n\n\nA: Do you not just need to do this;\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect via bluettooth\n\n*Go to the iPod app\n\n*Click on the hidden button bottom right that only appears when you are connected to Bluetooth.\n\n*Select the output device that isn't your handsfree destination, it seems to remember this choice on my setup(?)\n\n\nThat worked for me when I had the same problem\n\nA: A new package was developed to disable A2DP and I can confirm it works.\nhttp://www.if0rce.com/en/bluetooth-service-manager/\n\nA: Another answer mentioning the Bluetooth service manager doesn't work in all cases. Specifically, it only disables A2DP and it doesn't disable it per device.\nI use a parrot car kit and would rather use my blackberry Bluetooth dongle I have in the car, unfortunately that little button that appears doesn't remember settings for me, kind of a pain to switch it while driving, it seems to change back to the parrot after a call also.  \n", "Q: iPhone 4 email encryption I have a nice new iPhone 4.  I can use it for my work calendar, but not my work email.  The reason why is because I work for a medical company and email is very protected.\nI have heard that the encryption that comes with the iPhone 3GS is laughable for real enterprise use.\nDid it get any better with the iPhone 4?  Or is that just an OS based thing?\nIf it is iron clad safe then I might be able to convince my company to let me get emails on my device.\n\nA: The article cited in your question is from before iOS 4 started using \"Data Protection, which is Apple's term for creating an encryption key based on the users lock code or password. Basically the hardware encryption is used, but only accessable after a user has created an encryption key (which is based on the entered Passcode), and as soon as the phone is locked or turned off, the key is erased.\nThe problem is that apps are only going to encrypt data if they utilize the Data Protection API, which the Mail app does: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4175\nIt's also what setup the groundwork for the remote wipe feature, which destroys the Key as well. source\n\nA: iOS 4 strengthened the enterprise security features. If you want to encrypt your profiles, install them after a secure wipe, require VPN to the mail server (or to everything for logging and extra security) and lock down the devices, it's pretty easy to satisfy the most privacy minded companies.\nThe enterprise developer program is opened up and has tons of resources including code examples on how to build, sign, encrypt and deploy proprietary apps if you are worried about the default mail app which is locked down quite well these days.\nOnce the devices are locked, it's not easy to get them and Apple's track record of patching holes like the one you listed over the past 4 years is fairly aggressive.\nWhether your company has the inclination to learn about, deploy, test and use these tools is something I'll leave up to you.\n", "Q: Why does iPhone and iPod touch auto-brightness setting work relative to a brightness you set rather than absolute? iPhone and iPod Touch aside, I've always considered manual brightness and auto brightness to be mutually exclusive settings.  Intuitively, auto brightness means exactly that - the device figures it out.  Why is the iOS auto brightness setting implemented relative to the manual brightness setting rather than absolute?  In other words, why is manual brightness even an option when auto brightness is selected?\n\nA: Because a one-size-fits-all auto-brightness setting is going to be unpleasant for a large number of users, either because the automatically-selected levels are either too difficult to see, too bright, or eat too much battery.  The automatic setting is based on the threshold you set specifically so that the device can \"figure out\" ideal settings within a range that you can tolerate.\nMore to the point, I have a question for you.  Is there a point on the auto-brightness slider that you're comfortable with?  If not, that should be all the proof you need that the slider is necessary!  If there is a setting that looks ideal all the time, you've got nothing to complain about - the system works for you.\n\nA: The reason why the brightness bar is still an option when auto brightness is on is two-fold. First, on the lock screen, when you are putting in your code or just checking time or whatever, the IPhone/IPod Touch uses the actual brightness bar setting for the brightness on lock screen. Auto-brightness only works after you unlock the device (by unlock, i mean the point in time where you can click on apps and such).\nAlso, the brightness bar sets a quasi-minimum limit, like, if you go into a darkened room like a movie theater, the auto-brightness  will dim the light, up to the level that you have your brightness bar. Kind of like the volume limit for music, except this sets a minimum value instead of a maximum. There are situations where this doesn't apply, which is why i called it a quasi-minimum limit.\nFor example, if the place you are in is like, literally pitch black (or as close to it as you can achieve, then the difference between your set level and the level the auto-detector wants it to be, is considered extreme, and the auto-detector will override the set level, and put it on the lowest possible brightness.\nHope this helps, seeing as I derived all of this from personal experience with my own usage of the IPhone 3GS and IPhone 4.\nOh, just a note, i mentioned that while on lock screen, the device will use your brightness bar settings, yeah, that only works when it's NOT on the charger. placing the device on charge will automatically put the new lock screen (the one that shows a picture of a battery) on the highest brightness setting.\n", "Q: How to change the location where iTunes stores backups of iPhones? When I sync my iPhone 4 with my iTunes, the latter starts to make a backup before doing the actual sync.  This backup often takes a lot of time to make, which is very annoying.  What is even worse (imo) is that the backup is stored on my C-partition (where my WinXP Pro sp3 is installed and running).  I consider a backup being data, and I wish to store data in a different location than the one used for my operating system.\nSearching the web, I found many people who were mad at the waste of time the mandatory backup caused, and I even learnt how to prevent the backup process from starting while syncing.  I could not, however, find any information for how to re-direct the location of backups made by iTunes, so I could choose a different partition than the default one.\nCould anyone in this forum advise how to accomplish this?\nThanks for any help.\nWilbour\n\nA: The iPhone backup is stored to he %APPDATA%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup, where the %APPDATA% is typically in the C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming.\nEven on Windows, you can create a symbolic link to redirect the Backup folder elsewhere.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close iTunes.\n\n*Create a folder on another drive (e.g. D:\\apple_backup) and move the contents of the above folder there.\n\n*Remove the (now empty) Backup folder.\n\n*Create a Backup symbolic link pointing to the new location:\nmklink /D \"%APPDATA%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\" \"D:\\apple_backup\"\n\nActually, while I was doing this, I have moved whole Apple Computer folder as there are more large files other than device backups. Note that for that you need to kill some background Apple processes that use these folders (like SyncServer.exe, etc.)\nFor more details refer to:\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/164275/how-to-change-the-backup-location-of-itunes-or-any-windows-app/\n\nA: The actual backup iTunes makes stores it in this folder if you on computer\nMac OS: ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\nWindows XP: %AppData%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nWindows Vista: %AppData%\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nWindows 7: %AppData%\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup \nThere is a GUID directory under it, you may have two since you chose new iPhone, or it might have overwritten the existing one, take a look there. If you have two then maybe the other one is your old one. Youd need to go into your iPhone and delete the iTunes_control directory and reconnect it to iTunes and see if it lets you pick that backup.\nIf you want to transfer iphone to computer, just follow these tutorials:\nFor PC: How to transfer or backup iPhone contents to Windows\nFor Mac: How to transfer contents from iPhone to Mac OS\nTaylor B.\n\nA: iTunes does not have a mechanism to store it's data (your backups) outside the home folder for your user.\nThis is more an operating system issue than an itunes issue. On mac there are lots of options to set up a user folder elsewhere or use aliases and sym links to redirect certain folders to a different location.  Most of these links don't work across volumes on a mac. Sorry to play ping pong with this question but it might get a better audience in super user as the best place to learn how to have the windows os fake a program to store files in an alternate location.\nYou might also look in the registry to see if iTunes has a variable for this Location that you could try to change.\nThe good news is that apple documents the locations of iTunes files as well as mobile backup files so you can plan and play around to see what works for you. You might just have to clean out old backups to make enough space.

I bought an external hard drive, plugged it into the USB port of my Airport Extreme base station, turned on Time Machine, set it to use that drive for backup.\nIt's backing up 350Gigs of data and it's literally taking days to work its way through.  \nIs this normal? It seems like it's taking a way too much time.\n\nA: 350 GB is a lot of data, especially to transfer wirelessly. It will take a long time. In the future, only changed files will be backed up, so the backup will be much faster. To make the initial backup faster, you could try connecting the drive directly to the computer using the fastest possible port (see this question for a discussion of which ports are fastest). You will still be able to use the drive through the airport for future backups.\n\nA: Over wireless, I'd assume less than 5gb per hour. More likely 2-3, putting your backup in the 5-6 day range.\nYour best bet is to use an ethernet cable to connect to the Airport Extreme while the first backup runs.  You should average 10+ gb per hour over a cable and I'd hop\n", "Q: iPhone EDGE Network Problem I have a factory unlocked, not yet jailbroken iphone 3g. I am running ios 4.2.1 and firmware 5.15.04.

I have a specific mail setup on my mac where I use Mail.app to access my Gmail via IMAP, and the app filters emails into folders (\"On my mac\" as opposed to in Gmail itself) for my different projects, school, etc. The problem is that whenever Mail.app moves an email into a folder (out of the main Inbox), it gets put in the Gmail Archive (All Mail), and then is no longer accessible via my iPhone - i.e. when I search for it, it's not there. Is there a way to make emails in folders available on iPhone/iPad, preferably actually synced with the device so you have the real folders from Mail.app available? \n\nA: Be sure that you are making folders that are stored on gmail using IMAP.\nIt sounds like you are moving the messages to a local folder (on my mac) and the correct behavior in that case is to delete the message from all IMAP folders.\nMail keeps a local copy of all messages - so you still have offline access, time machine backups going back in time, and all the benefits of local storage when messages are \"stored in a folder in gmail.\" Think of the location as the authoritative copy and not the only copy or even the most correct copy. When you make changes offline - those time stamps let the system sync your changes back to gmail once you reconnect and properly integrate changes with new mail that has arrived while offline.\nJust to be totally clear - here are some pictures...\nTry making a new IMAP folder like the picture below - you can rename it later if needed to see what creating a folder stored on Gmail looks like on your mail client.\n\nYou don't want it stored locally like this:\nYou can drag messages into the new folder or drag entire folder structures as long as you have time for the operation to sync / upload all the data to gmail servers. I have seen folders with 5,000 messages take two or three hours to upload even on normal internet with decent upload speeds so try first with smaller mailboxes to get the hang of things.\n\nA: You need to update your rules to move mail to the gmail IMAP folders rather than the ones from 'On My Mac'. When it does that, it is copying them out of the gmail box to your local mail store. \nYou could also have the rules set up in gmail which will parse them before sending mail to your device, so on both your Mac and iOS devices they would already be in the correct location.\n\nA: iOS 4.0 and newer seem to set Gmail up as IMAP, but older setups are probably POP3, giving you only INBOX access. If you (have) set up your Gmail account on your iPhone as Exchange account or IMAP (for iOS 4.x, just re-set Gmail up, for 3.x follow these instructions) then you can get out of the INBOX by touching Mailboxes button up left and then navigate to All Mail folder where you can see all your mail and search among them.\nIf this suffices, no changes have to be made to Mail.app filters.\n", "Q: Why is the menu bar showing the VPN \"Disconnecting\" animation  forever?

I'm in the process of trying to do the migration from the old one to the new one.  Her old computer was running 10.6.6 and the newer one is running Tiger.  I thought that it would be a good idea to update the new one to Snow Leopard before starting the migration.  When I set up the new computer I accidentally gave it a different short name than the old one has.  Will I be able to migrate the files if the short name is different?  If not, is there any easy way to change it one the new computer There is nothing else on there now.\n\nA: Run the Migration Assistant utility on the new computer, and it'll walk you through migrating the account to the new computer.  It's actually good that you used a different name on the new computer, since that means it can bring over the entire account (by its original name) and it won't conflict with the account you've already created on the new (/temporary) computer.\n\nA: If you are comfortable in terminal - you can quickly boot into single user mode to remove the offending user account and let migration assistant take another try at moving in without any name conflicts. This works for Snow Leopard as written with two caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*rm is forever and if you type wrong there is no undo and no questions asking if you are sure\n\n*Substitute her short name for apple below - you can see all the user folders with the command ls /Users\nOnce you mount the drive /sbin/mount -uw / these three commands will delete the user record for a short name apple.\n\n\n*\n\n*rm -rf /Users/apple\n\n*cd /private/var/db\n\n*rm .AppleSetupDone\n\n*cd dslocal/nodes/Default/users\n\n*rm apple.plist\n\n*halt\nThen when you boot the machine, it will start the setup assistant so you can choose to migrate to a clean mac.\nStep 1 deletes the old home folder - everything from that user will be gone forever. Step 3 tells the setup assistant to run. Step 5 removes the record from the local user database to clean up the record of the user and all user settings. Technically a few other places have a record of the user ID and what groups the user belonged to, but for 99% of the macs, this will let you start over again. This is much cleaner than mucking with changing short names if you are going to move everything over again and much quicker than reinstalling from scratch.\n", "Q: How can I get iPhone Mail to accept meeting invitations attached as .ics files?

The Gmail iPhone page also displays it opposed to the iPhone mail client but I cannot accept it. \nIs there any iPhone app / hack / workaround so I can accept invitations right inside iPhone mail or iPhone calendar (my Google calendar & contacts get pushed via Google Mobile / ActiveSync)?\n\nA: When I receive an invitation to my Gmail account, it auto populates in my Google Calendar with a question mark beside it.\nUnfortunately you can't accept - however it will now show in your calendar.\nIf the invite is sent from gmail, there is a link to select if you want to accept the invite.\nNot exactly the full answer you're looking for but, hopefully this helps.\n\nA: The iPhones mail app works fine for me or the google calendar in safari.

(And I can't write to files I own, etc.)\nI can workaround to access my account by su [my username], but I'm puzzled. Any suggestions?\n\nA: ssh can get confused if your short name is different between the two machines. You can check what your short name is on each machine with whoami. To go to a particular account, use ssh jhayward@mymac. If you still have trouble, use ssh -v jhayward@mymac. You may see things like checking ~/.ssh/config. If you want to avoid typing jhaward@ all of the time, you can make (or add to) the file ~/.ssh/config with the lines\nHost mymac\nHostname 1234.1234.1234\nUser jhaward\n\nediting each line for your particular case (the Host is your nickname, the Hostname is the IP address, or mymac.local or whatever you currently use for ssh).\nThen you can just use ssh mymac. \nIf you still have trouble, post some output from ssh -v but be careful to not post anything private (like IP addresses).\n", "Q: In Aperture, is there a way to confirm faces in bulk? In the Aperture 3 \"Faces\" view, when clicking on a person, there is a section \"John may also be in the photos below\". By clicking on the \"Confirm Faces\" button, you have the ability to click on each image to confirm. Is there a way to select multiple images or do this in bulk? I'd expect shift-clicking on the images to do it, but that doesn't work. There must be a better workflow. \n\nA: Instead of clicking on the \"Confirm Faces\" button, simply select all the photos that match (using shift-click or any other method) and then drag them to the space above the grey bar that says \"John may also be in the photos below\".   This has the affect of bulk confirming your selection as being John.\n\nA: Another way of confirming (or rejecting) faces in bulk is to drag (option) select over the faces you want to confirm (or reject). You can even mix in the same drag by pressing or releasing the option key to change between confirm or reject.\nFaces workflow has other tricks too (but nothing that makes its workflow smooth as one might expect in a pro app).  \nFor instance, holding option when your ready to confirm the selections changes the Done button to Update, which will allow you to continue with other faces that Aperture finds immediately confirming after pressing it.

How are the Windows machines and Mac browsers able to find the server, but Terminal can't?\nEdit #1:\n~: ssh root@server.local\nssh: Could not resolve hostname server.local: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\n~: ssh root@192.168.1.200\nroot@192.168.1.200's password:\n\nEdit #2:\nI already tried flushing the DNS cache by dscacheutil -flushcache.\nI'm on OS 10.6.\nOk, so why is Terminal confused about the domain name when browsers are not?\nAdding 192.168.1.200 server.local to /etc/hosts fixes the problem. I'm just wondering why it's not able to rely on the router's DNS.\n\nA: Mac OSX 10.6 does not respect DNS responses with a TTL (time to live) of 0 (which is what DD-WRT based routers are set to by default).  You will need to go into the DD-WRT router and into the Administation -> Services tab.  You will see a box called Additional DNS options.  Add the following value to this box :\nlocal-ttl=5\n\nSave and reboot your router and your Mac, and you should be able to see server.local in terminal (without having it in your hosts file).\n\nA: Mac OS X reserves the \".local\" extension for mDNS. As far as I know, it can't be turned off. You either have to turn on mDNS on your server, pick a different extension for your network, or modify your /etc/hosts/ file with an entry for your server.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro will no longer detect external display My MBP will no longer detect external displays. It was working fine a few hours ago at work, I got home and plugged in the external display as usual and turned on the machine and nothing. Using the \"Detect Displays\" does nothing. I have tried re-plugging the mini DVI display port adapter and have tried using a different monitor with a different monitor cable. I have tried shutting down and booting without the adapter plugged in and then plugging in the adapter. Nothing works. Is there some trick to force my MBP to see and use the external monitor?\nMore Information: When I plug in the display port the LCD screen goes blue for a moment. Checking the Graphics and Displays display connecter shows\nStatus: No Display Connected\n\nA: Try resetting the parameter RAM using these instructions\nYou can also try resetting the SMC using these instructions\n\nA: I have had a similar problem (albeit with a Powerbook) and I had to change my DVI-VGA (back then we didn't have Mini-DP). It was working until one day it simply stopped working. Since I had a lot of displays at home, I tried -like you- different cables and displays to no avail until I found another adapter and boom, it worked. \nAnother way to test this is go to an App Store or similar with your machine and your cable. Try to make it work there. If it doesn't, they will have extra adapters to rule out that possibility. If a new cable, display, adapter also fails, then your Mini-DP port could be failing and that requires an App Store anyway…\n", "Q: FTP sites open in Finder instead of in Safari I cannot log into FTP sites on my iMac (Intel Core i5, 2.8GHz, running OS X 10.6.7).\nI probably created the problem when I installed Firefox and it took over as the default browser. I changed the default back to Safari, but then every time I try to log into the FTP at school (ftp://sws.pcc.edu), Firefox launched instead. I found a utility that said it would allow me to control internet protocol associations, which it kinda did. I tried to set Safari back to FTP but now FTP's open in Finder.\nHow do get things back to allowing me to login to FTP sites in Safari?\n\nA: Safari does not support browsing FTP sites (displaying directory listings). Given a ftp: URL for a specific file, it will display or download it, but URLs for directories will be passed to the Finder instead.\n\nA: Try this freeware app called MisFox.  It will allow you to change the protocol helper for FTP.\n\nA: Navigate to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist.\nOpen the file up in a text editor (any will do) - if you have Property List Editor installed, I'd still recommend a text editor, as it makes the next step easier.\nDo a quick find in the document for \"ftp\" - once you've got the entry, it should look something like this:\n\n<dict>\n<key>LSHandlerRoleAll </key>\n<string>com.panic.transmit </string>\n<key>LSHandlerURLScheme </key>\n<string>ftp </string>\n</dict>\n\nFor me, Transmit is set to handle FTP. Change that line to com.apple.safari, save the file, and give it a shot. Make a backup first.

It asks for credit card info. but since I don't have a credit card, now I can't download apps(free ones) at all. \nDeauthorizing doesn't seem to help either. \n\nA: Try this procedure to create an iTunes App Store account without a credit card.\n", "Q: Iphone 3G shows 'no service' eversince I came back from Malaysia I'm using Iphone 3g for a year exactly and have no problems at all until recently I went to Malaysia. it says 'no service' where the carrier name supposed to be. so I assume its because since I'm out of the country, Singtel can't get coverage where Im at. I returned to Singapore 2 days later and still it says 'no service'. I tried doing all hard reset, clean restore, wipe everything out, tried toggling the airplane mode, still no improvement..

If what prompted the problem was leaving the country, its very possible that some provisioning happened with your account that isnt correct.\nOther than that? Yeah you need a new phone :(\n\nA: I would recommend updating the IPhone carrier settings and changing the date and time on your phone.

If text.txt doesn't exist, as usual, vim will create it in the buffer.\n\nA: You could simply use MacVIM to handle this.  When you install MacVIM it should give you an option to install the command line shortcuts.\nThen, in your Terminal, simply use mvim instead of vi:\nmvim /path/to/your/file.txt\n\nOr, if you are super lazy, add this to your ~/.profile:\nalias vi=mvim\n\nThis also allows you to associate text files with MacVIM in finder, so you always get the right application for your files, weather you open them in the GUI or not.\n", "Q: Can I use FileVault only for specific folders? Can I set up FileVault to encrypt only specific folders inside of my Home folder but not the whole Home folder?\nI want to do this because it's not very convenient for me to encrypt the entire Home folder because it's too large and there is no place for encrypted data, and it's also not convenient for me to keep all those files out of my Home folder.\nThanks in advance.\nEDIT: if it not possible, what are the other usable ways of encryption? \n\nA: It's not possible (at least not that I know) to specify Filevault's target dir. It will work by automatically working with your home folder by creating (if you are in Leopard or above) a Sparse Bundle (or a Sparse Disk Image if you are in Tiger). The reason for the change has to do with Time Machine (and to allow -to a certain extent- to backup a FileVaulted home).\nHowever, you can pretty much \"replicate\" the functionality of FileVault for a specific folder(s) by using Disk Utility to create an encrypted sparsebundle image of the Folder in question. You'd have to mount this image every time you want to use it but the \"effect\" is similar.\nYou can create symbolic links to the files and add the image to the login items if you have an application that needs the data in its original location (which is pretty common). You will possibly have to add the image password to the \"Keychain\" for it to be automatically expanded. \nIt would be important to read about Time Machine's limitations too, since a FileVault home directory can only occur when you're logging in (or out). In order to make Time Machine to act as a regular, you need OS X Server edition as a target.\nAccording to the wikipedia entry (which I should have quoted at the beginning since it has all this information, better written and more complete):\n\nFileVault is limited to encrypting home directories only in versions of Mac OS X prior to 10.7, and only those directories in their entirety. FileVault can encrypt entire disks starting with Mac OS X version 10.7\n\n(emphasis added by me)\nIt remains to be seen whether this is true or not, since we don't speculate about future versions, but keep that in mind. \nAs an alternative, there are \"multiple\" programs that will also help you keep a secure \"vault\" of things. I'm mentioning Exces because I got it from a Bundle a couple of years ago. I used it three times and it works; there might be free alternatives (as well as using the plain \"Disk Utility\").\nUpdate: Added the link provided by Kyle, because it explains how to do it, but kept my answer because it's \"longer\" :)\n\nA: When I need partial encryption and especially when the encrypted container needs to be portable, I turn my head to TrueCrypt, which is free & open source software, available for the major operating systems, and can\n\n\n*\n\n*create encrypted containers\n\n*create encrypted virtual disk images\n\n*encrypt entire disks\n\n*create hidden & encrypted volumes (by steganography)\n\n*even hide & encrypt the whole operating system (though this might be a bit too much for the need to encrypt just a folder structure)\n\n\nOn top of this all, it is rather fast and has many encryption options.\nContainers are encrypted files that hold a file system. Being a file, it can easily be moved, copied, briefed, re-briefed, indexed or numbered (or whatever it is what you do with your files). They're useful to be used with e.g. removable disks, when you need the files and encryption be used under different operating systems.\nThough, if you need to use the files only on (your) Mac, I would go for the most native way possible, as it is described in Kyle's and Martín's answers.\n\nA: For specific folder encryption have a look at Espionage:\nhttp://www.taoeffect.com/espionage/\n\nA: As far as I know, it's not possible.\n\nA: Due to the way Filevault operates, it's not possible to selectively protect files. However, you can create an encrypted disk image that you can store within your home folder that you can use to securely store files that you want to protect.\n", "Q: typewriter effect to keyboard stroke Is there any way to add (sound) typewriter effect to keyboard stroke?\n\nA: Here is a link to an article that explains how to do this natively (without any 3rd party applications).\nAnd here is an app - Typewriter Keyboard - that makes it sound authentically like a typewriter.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How do I use a PC keyboard on a Mac I have a very nice and expensive mechanical keyboard.

For example, I want the Ctrl key on the PC keyboard to act like the Command key on the Mac, so when I press Ctrl-C to Copy, I get the action I am used to.\n\nA: Just plug it in and off you go.  As for keyboard mappings, if you goto the System Preferences -> Keyboard, you can adjust the Keyboard modifiers there.  Just set the Control key to behave like the Command key.\n\nA: Additional to Martin Macaroni's answer, also have a look at KeyRemap4Macbook. For example, you probably have the 'Application Key' sitting between the super key and control key doing nothing at the moment. Using KeyRemap4Macbook you can change this key into a modifier key (⌥, ⌘ or ⌃). My PC keyboard also featured a control key on the right but my MacBook's keyboard didn't, so I remapped it to option like on my MacBook.\n\nA: I too, have a \"PC\" keyboard, and here's what you have to do (see attached image).\nOpen System Preferences and go to Keyboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once there, click in the \"Modifier Keys\"\n\n*Select your keyboard.\n\n*Change your keys to reflect your change.

Is it possible to configure Mail.app to use the growl notifications for incoming mail ?\nMaybe there is an external script doing that too ?\n\nA: You need to download GrowlMail, however every time MacOS X is updated the version of GrowlMail becomes outdated and won't run (under Snow Leopard, at least). \nI think that the current version of GrowlMail doesn't work with Mac OS X 10.6.7 at present. Details of why it keeps breaking are here. It is annoying but seems unavoidable.\n\nA: Growl is great, but there's a standalone extension that adds way more functionality to Mail.app. It's called Herald: http://erikhinterbichler.com/software/herald/\nHerald is continuing the awesome tradition of Mail.appetizer, if you remember that one from a few years ago. It is superior.\n\nA: I outlined my method of using Growl in conjunction with Apple Mail, mail rules and AppleScript here: Is there any way to get a pop-up notification on my iPhone or iPad when mail arrives?\nThe code for the AppleScript is also included in the answer I provided.\n", "Q: Two-Step Authentication, iPhone Mail.app, and SMTP I have setup Two Step Verification for my Google account and all is well getting into email from a browser, or from the Safari browser on my phone.\nHowever, I cannot get Mail.app to work. It just tells me the password is wrong. I am using an application specific password generated from the account access page in Google, tried two, still no go.\nHow can I get the Mail.app to actually work with this?\n\nA: Open up the keychain application and locate the password that it has stored for your gmail account.  Now delete it.\nThen retry the process you have, ensure you put in your application specific password, and then ensure you press the checkbox that says to save password to keychain.\nFurther instructions and Mail.app specific screenshots here.\nI believe that mail.app is using an older stored email and this is preventing access.

The image was created using Disk Utility.\n\nA: Yes if the compressed disk image looks like a whole mac with enough of /System and /Applications as well as /Users/foo then Migration Assistant will treat that mounted image as a viable source and you can pull just the  user account and data even if the rest of the information is incomplete.\nYou can also finder copy the folder into /Users once the image is mounted. D on't overwrite an existing short name, just drop the files in a new folder and don't worry about ownership as long as you can copy all the files from the image. Once the files are copied, create a new account to match the short name of the user folder and the OS will correct the permissions/ACL on the folder and enable that user as specified.\nYou may have issues if ACL are deeply embedded or you have non-standard permissions set, but generally I have not had any issues doing this for some time over many releases of Mac OS. Finder seems to drop the files as readable enough or warn you that some files on the image are unreadable so you can take further action if needed.\n", "Q: Opening finder instances extremely slow in browsers and quicksilver since 10.6.7 update Since the update OSX to 10.6.7 opening finder windows (such as when you want to save an image in a browser) takes between 5-10 seconds and then an additional 1-3 seconds to show places in the finder window. \nI have tried installing Onyx and rebuilding the links in LaunchServices, and this solved the problem but after a day or so the problem returned. \nThere most be some kind of permanent solution to this so I don't have to format and reinstall. \nAny ideas? \n\nA: Did you update to 10.6.7 using the Software Update utility? Or did you use the Update Combo?\nIt's not unheard of for the Software Update utility to muck things up. The advantage of using the Update Combo is that it rewrites everything, as opposed to doing a 'delta' upgrade.\nIt should be noted that the Update Combo package is now weighing in at over 1 GB.\nYou won't do any harm, and you may fix things, by running the Update Combo linked to above.\n", "Q: Why do my headphones hiss when I plug them into my iPod touch When I plug in my headphones to my iPod touch (first gen), I get a weird hissing noise that I don't get when I plug them into anything else. Also, If I plug different headphones into the iPod, no hissing noise.\nIs this interference? Or another problem?\nAside from getting new headphones or getting a new iPod touch, what are my options?\n\nA: The iPod touches (and most recent iPods, dating back to the 6th gen original iPod) have four contacts to allow stereo audio as well as the microphone and inline controls. (This uses a TRRS [tip-ring-ring-sleeve] plug instead of a TRS [tip-ring-sleeve] plug as usually seen on stereo headphones. More info at Wikipedia.) \nYour headphones, since you said there were three connectors, are almost certainly TRS. If you can shine a flashlight into the headphone hole, there might be a bent pin in there that is causing a poor connection or a connection to the wrong segment. The only way I can think of to fix this, however, is to try to shove it around with a paperclip or other stiff wire.\n", "Q: What certificates and/or files are needed to bypass iOS's passcode lock? Some forensic tools like Lantern 2.0 allow the use of a passcode bypass file to get around the passcode lock on iOS 4.2 and later. This means that if someone has your device they can get around the normal restriction to not sync until the device is unlocked.\nI'm wondering which file or files iTunes creates and stores to convince a locked iOS device to sync over USB. Even better would be an analysis of the specific keychain items are needed to bypass the passcode lock for iOS.\n\nA: The complete description of the feature on the Lantern site is \"Pass code bypass with certificate file from syncing computer\" so I don't think \"until the device is unlocked\" is the accurate way to phrase it. It seems that Lantern re-uses the pre-existing credentials set up between the computer and the phone.\nedit: And in re-reading your question it seems you may be aware of this. A quick perusal of the iOS developer documentation doesn't yield anything to me but you can likely determine this for yourself if you have a mac you sync your phone to.\nfrom a terminal window run the command sudo fs_usage -wf filesys | grep -i itunes and you should be able to see what files iTunes consults when you connect your passcode-locked phone.\n\nA: After several hours of looking and using fs_usage to trace files, I have come to the conclusion that the certificates are indeed stored in the keychain. (which in hindsight is a DUH moment).\nHere are the files iTunes reads on launch and during a sync on my mac.\n18:38:16.776  stat64                                 /Library/Keychains/System.keychain                                                      0.000010   iTunes              \n18:38:16.776  open              F=5        (R_____)  /Users/me/Library/Keychains/login.keychain                                            0.000007   iTunes              \n18:38:16.801  open              F=5        (R_____)  /Library/Keychains/System.keychain                                                      0.000016   iTunes              \n18:38:26.013  open              F=48       (R_____)  /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain                               0.000024   iTunes              \nI have been unable to uncover which specific keys or chain of keys are needed. They keychain in my home folder appears to not be needed since other user accounts on my mac see content of my locked iPhone even before iTunes launches. Whetherusbmuxd or another low level daemon is reading a system level certificate or the API to access iOS data relies on a common library for access in bypassing the passcode lock on iOS 4 is unclear. \nIt is clear that the iOS passcode won't protect from someone that can access the files on your hard drive (and has the detailed knowledge that isn't yet clear which certificate or file has the keys stored)\nFileVault won't protect you since the certificate appears to be stored outside the user folder.\n\nA: I believe you're talking about the escrow keybag, stored at  %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Apple\\Lockdown - this is the cert bag required for iTunes to connect and sync with previously paired iOS devicees without the user re-entering credentials. If you sync your iPhone to your Mac, and then copy the contents of the above folder to another Mac, you can access the device on the 2nd Mac without reentering creds.\nIf you're interested in a real deep dive of the technical details behind this, take a look at this presentation - http://conference.hackinthebox.org/hitbsecconf2011ams/materials/D2T2%20-%20Jean-Baptiste%20Be%CC%81drune%20&%20Jean%20Sigwald%20-%20iPhone%20Data%20Protection%20in%20Depth.pdf\n", "Q: Is it not possible to sort albums by artist on the iPad? So I recently picked up an iPad 2 and promptly loaded all my music onto it. Unfortunately I can't figure out how to have it display my albums grouped by artists like they are on iTunes.  Am I just missing something (probably obvious) or did Apple not bother to provide this functionality?\n\nA: On the iPad, you'll have to use the \"Artists\" tab at the bottom, then tap the desired artist to see their songs grouped by album.\nIt is silly that they don't let you sort the \"Albums\" tab by artist.  Hopefully they'll remedy this in the future.\n\n", "Q: Force simple UNIX path names for optimal us of command line apps? I want to force myself to use folder/file names without spaces etc. so I'm 100% certain I can open and run them from the command line.\nSome terminal apps which I use frequently hava a hard time recognisizing filenames that have spaces in them, and I want to prevent having to type \\ every time. \nIs there a way of forcing this (perhaps formatting my hdd in to a different file system)?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you just have to remember to do it each time you make a file or directory. There's no way you can do this via software tools or by formatting to a particular file system. After the fact you can use software to convert spaces to '.' or '-' however.\nObviously what you describe is an excellent idea and good practice when working in a *nix environment. You'll probably find that the more time you spend in the Terminal, the more inclined you'll be to create short, non-spaced file names. Unfortunately Apple themselves make your task an impossible one in that they often use multi-word file or directory names.\nAs to the first part of your question: You can be sure that you'll always be able to manipulate files in the Terminal, even if they contain many spaces, etc. It's just a case of 'escaping' the spaces by typing a '\\ ' where the space would be, as you point out.\nTab-completion can be a real time saver here, but it's generally better to avoid the problem in the first place.\n\nA: You can put the whole path in singlequotes:\n$ cd '/User Guides And Information/Welcome to Snow Leopard.app/'\n\nTab-completion even works properly inside a quoted path string. \nBut as @boehj says, there's no way to make spaces into non-troublemakers on an OS leve.\n", "Q: transferring itunes I recently bought a new macbook pro and it just came in (very excited). I want to wirelessly transfer my itunes library on my old mac to my new one.\n\nA: The quickest way to do this is to connect the two computers using Ethernet cable.\nSimply copy all of ~/Music/iTunes (from the older Mac) to ~/Music/iTunes (of the newer Mac).\nEverything will be as it was before. Note that you'll be overwriting some files in the newer Mac's ~/Music/iTunes directory. Don't worry though. That's what you want to do.\nYou may also want to open up iTunes first on the newer Mac and do ⌘+, to set up the preferences as you like them. In 'Advanced' you should 'Keep iTunes Media folder organized' and 'Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library'.\nThen shutdown iTunes and do the copy.\n__\nDOING THE COPY\nConnect both Macs with Ethernet cable. In System Preferences > Network you'll see 'Ethernet' on the left-hand side. You will hopefully have a green light indicating that the two Macs are connected properly and good to go. Incidentally you should ensure that the notebook(s) are plugged into mains power here.\nNote that ~ is a shorthand for /Users/[yourusername] so it can be used universally when giving instructions. In your case you need to click on the Finder (old Mac) and navigate to /Users/[yourusername]/Music/iTunes. In this sub-directory there'll be a bunch of files and directories including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Album Artwork\n\n*iTunes Music\n\n*Previous iTunes Libraries\n\n*iTunes Library\n\n*etc.\n\n\nYou need to select all of this by doing ⌘+a. Once it's all selected you do ⌘+c to copy the files.\nOpen up another Finder window. You can do this in many ways including 'control-clicking' on the Finder icon in the dock. In this second window, navigate to the corresponding directory on your new Mac. You'll see your new Mac on the left-hand side under 'SHARED'.\nYou've done ⌘+c in /Users/[yourusername]/Music/iTunes and in the second window you're sitting in /Users/[yourusernameNewMac]/Music/iTunes. Click on that 'iTunes' sub-directory and it will be highlighted blue. Press ⌘+v.\nThe process will start. Depending on how large your iTunes library is, and what grade Ethernet cable you have, you could be looking at waiting between 5 minutes to over an hour for it to complete.\nCODA\nOnce it's complete, you can ensure that both libraries are identical by doing ⌘+i on both iTunes sub-directories and comparing the number of bytes and items.\n\nA: The easiest method I havent seen mentioned here is iTunes Home Sharing.\nIf you are signed in and authorized on both computers, you can literally change a drop down to \"All songs not in my library\" and automatically let iTunes copy and import the songs for you.\nThe link: iTunes: Understanding Home Sharing\n\nA: The easiest is to back it up to an external hard drive and there's a short article on several ways to move a library to a new machine too.\nOnce you have consolidated all the files in one folder (which is the most important part) - you could also transfer the files over a network cable or wifi but that might be slower than an external drive. I would quit iTunes just to avoid a file being modified while the copy is progressing - but it likely won't matter.\nThe benefit of this over home sharing is your iPods and iOS devices will see the new library as the same as the old library and not want to erase the device.\n\nA: If you have a hub or switch at home, you can set up file sharing between the two and simply copy the files over to the proper folder. On your new Mac you may need to have iTunes rescan for new music, but everything will be set after that.\n", "Q: Why doesn't .bashrc run automatically? I put some alias commands in my .bashrc file, so that they might be loaded everytime I open a new Terminal window. Yet this doesn't happen.\nI have to select run script: in the Terminal>Preferences>\"MyDefaultTheme\">Shell prefpane and add:\nsource .bashrc && clear for it to work...\nThis seems odd since many tutorials only say you just have to add to the .bashrc file and all is good.\nNote that I don't run in bash when using the terminal, I like the other (default) one (don't know what it is) better, because it show me where I am all the time eg:\n>>d54c6b47b:~ romeo$\n\nin stead of:\n>>bash$\n\nIn bash all is loaded as should be.\nSo my question is, why didn't my .bashrc file load automatically and did I have to add the option to call it everytime?\nAlso some tutorial told me to do something like:\n$alias la=’ls -la’ >> ~/.bashrc\n\nwhich should write the alias to my .bashrc, this doesn't work either...\nNote that I'm a UNIX novice, so be gentle.\n\nA: I found that after installing rvm (auto-installer, no manual edits) it had created a ~/.bash_login file for itself, where I previously never had one.\nHowever, this mean that my ~/.profile setups and aliases no longer got loaded! Lots of shortcuts disappeared. I thought they ran sequentially, not exclusively :-/\nI added \n. ~/.profile \n\nto ~/.bash_login to chain things as I expected.\n\nA: I put everything into ~/.bashrc and just source ~/.bashrc in .profile.\nThis allows screen and xterm (and i guess tmux) sessions to inherit my environment as non-login sessions only run .bashrc, whereas login sessions (eg terminal or iTerm) only run .profile.\n\nA: Putting...\n[[ -s \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && . \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" # Load RVM function\n\n...in ~/.bashrc, and then source ~/.bashrc into my ~/.bash_profile  didn't work for the Terminal program that comes installed.\nBut then I went to the menu drop-down Edit > Profile Preferences, Title and Command tab, and selected Run command as a login shell from the command section of that page.\nAfter doing so, starting a new terminal shows the desired result when I type \n type rvm|head -1\n\ni.e. \"rvm is a function\". It did not do that until I made this change, and it's the only change I made after the .bash_profile and .bashrc changes described in other answers here.\n\nA: Been there, done that. What I came aware of, OS X doesn't read .bashrc file on bash start. Instead, it reads the following files (in the following order):\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/profile\n\n*~/.bash_profile\n\n*~/.bash_login   \n\n*~/.profile\nSee also Chris Johnsen's informative and useful comment:\n\nBy default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell. On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells (only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). This is why \"put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile\" is standard advice\n\nI usually just put the things that I'd normally put in ~/.bashrc to ~/.profile — has worked so far like a charm.\n\nA: There are two scenarios:\n\n*\n\n*You are using Linux\n\n*You are using Mac Os X\n\nFor both you want to source ~/.bashrc in your profile that gets loaded, or sourced, when your shell for your terminal starts.\n\nLINUX\nIn Linux, ~/.profile is automatically source in your shell when it starts. So, if you go to your terminal and type cd ~; ls -A, you will see all of your files and directories in your home directory (/home/usrname/). You should see a file called .profile. This is the file that is automatically \"sourced\" when you start the terminal.\nIf you want to add aliases and functions to ~/.bashrc (which is what I do), then you should (inside of ~/.profile add an if statement that checks if ~/.bashrc is a non-empty file and then source it.\nTo check if your ~/.profile already does this enter nano ~/.profile. This will open it up in a text editor (you can use gedit if you know you have it or even vim if you know how to use it). You may get an empty text file (you shouldn't), but if you do simply proceed. If you do not see a line anywhere that says source ~/.bashrc, then enter the following lines somewhere (put it in a reasonable place like at the end or beginning and not in the middle of an if statement):\nif [ -s ~/.bashrc ]; then\n    source ~/.bashrc;\nfi\n\nThis checks if ~/.bashrc is a non-empty file (with if [ -s ~/.bashrc ]), and if it is such, it sources it. Pretty simple. Now, you can add any valid alias, function, variable, etc to ~/.bashrc.\n\nMAC OS X\nBy default (prior to 2019 Catalina), Mac OS X sources ~/.bash_profile. To be able to add things to ~/.bashrc (which is, again, what I do in OS X, as well), then you follow the same procedure as linux. In the terminal enter cd ~; nano .bash_profile. Check for a line that says source ~/.bashrc and if it's not there add the if statement above (if [ -s ~/.bashrc ]; then source ~/.bashrc; fi).\n\nNOTES\nWhen writing an if statement, be sure to leave spaces between basically everything (for example if [ -s ~/.bashrc]; then echo \"found\"; fi does not work because there is no space beween ~/.bashrc and ] - the interpreter will think this is one word).\nIf you want to figure out how to check for stuff in an if statement better, go to terminal and enter man \\[; this essentially gives you the run-down of an if statement. For example, if [ -f /path/to/file ]; then echo \"it's a file\"; else echo \"not a file\"; fi checks if /path/to/file is a file and if it is prints to stdout accordingly. I always reference this as well for easier-on-the-eyes and quick reference: 7.2. File test operators.\nI hope this helps. I remember how confused I was when I started all of this stuff (which wasn't too long ago); so, good luck with your future UNIX endeavours!\n\nA: First of all let me tell you that ~/.bashrc is the file which is executed every time a second shell is called up (when running a shell script, for instance), and ~/.profile is called on every login.\nSo I recommend you to write . ~/.bashrc command in your ~/.profile file, and this command will execute the bashrc file every time you login.\n\nA: By the way, if you have activated ZSH, it replaces bash!\nSo all those ~/.bashrc files don't get loaded.\nYou have to set your aliases in ~/.zshrc instead.\n\nA: Just put that in your .profile file from your home dir and it should work the next time you start a new shell or after you run source ~/.profile\nThis link clearly states the order in which the startup files are read and loaded by the shell:\nhttp://hayne.net/MacDev/Notes/unixFAQ.html#shellStartup\n\nA: Sourcing .profile in .bash_profile did it for me\necho 'source ~/.profile' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n\nA: I ran into the same issue after installing rbenv on my remote server (Digital Ocean) Ubuntu 16.04.\nIt somehow created ~/.bash_profile. It's the same ~/.bashrc on an OS X system.\nAnd Ubuntu started to read only ~/.bash_profile, but not ~/.bashrc as it should.\nSo I just backed up my data in ~/.bash_profile with this:\nmv ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile.bak\n\nAnd renamed the old ~/.bashrc to ~/.bash_profile\nmv ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile\n\nIt worked for me. After my ssh login I have everything loaded in ~/.bashrc.\n\nA: In case this might help anyone else...\nMake sure you're editing the right .bashrc file for the right user. I had a similar issue using Vagrant. After running vagrant ssh my .bashrc file was not being run. The solution was simple in that I thought vagrant was logging in with the user named vagrant, and I was actually logging in as another user. So I was editing the wrong .bashrc file. After editing the correct .bashrc file my aliases were recognized.\n\nA: To keep with the OSX style login .profile and support the normal bash behavior .bashrc you can use a .bashrc file if you switch between regular nix and OSX by providing a symbolic link to your .bashrc file called .bash_profile. Just make sure this file doesn't exist already before trying this, but this is how I do it. \nln -s .bashrc .bash_profile\n\n\nA: /etc/bashrc is for global profiles on mac systems.\nYou can add: alias ls=\"ls -G\" to the top of this file\nand your good, everyone will have colorized files and folders\non the system so you will not have to set anything extra for each individual user. You will also notice along with \"sudo su -\" to root from yourself you will still have colorized files and folders with no extra headaches. \nAnother fun tip: When using mac's Iterm2, importing color profiles will render the coloring of the files and folders immediately according to your color scheme after having this \"/etc/bashrc\" option set.\n", "Q: How to install apps to Snow Leopard after a fresh reinstall and still keep the MacBook in a pre-first-boot state? I'm selling my 2007 White MacBook.\nIn line with many suggestions I've seen online I've securely wiped the drive and done a re-install but have hit a problem.\nThe machine came with OS X 10.4 Tiger but I've since upgraded it to Leopard then Snow Leopard.\nIdeally I'd like to give the new owner the new MacBook experience with the spinning Welcome text but I'd also like to stick them on the latest Snow Leopard.\nThe problem is, when I do a fresh install of Snow Leopard the machine won't have the iLife applications (they are on the original Tiger install disks).\nIs there a way I can get the iLife apps on there without needing to set up an account on the machine?\nIf not, what's the best thing to do?\nSetting up an account is something I'd rather not do (I know I'd be annoyed if I bought a second-hand MacBook and it already had an account on it).\nOn the other hand installing Tiger and giving them the upgrade disks also seems a bit poor.\nAny suggestions please?\nThanks in advance.\nFollow up:\nAll the answers below were very informative, clearly explained and probably equally effective.\nI chose the one that best suited my circumstances but hopefully they will all be of use to future readers of this question.\nThanks to all who contributed.\n\nA: You could definitely install iLife, boot into single user mode, delete the user account via this superuser link(also below, and do it in single user mode), and then in single user mode just type rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone which is like a toggle switch, it tells the mac to start from the initial boot. \n#!/bin/bash\n\n# cf. http://www.macos.utah.edu/documentation/authentication/dscl.html\n\nif [[ \"$(/usr/bin/whoami)\" != \"root\" ]]; then printf '\\nMust be run as root!\\n\\n'; exit 1; fi\n\nOPATH=$PATH\nexport PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin\n\nOIFS=$IFS\nexport IFS=$' \\t\\n'\n\ndeclare sudo=/usr/bin/sudo\n\nprintf \"\\e[1mDelete user account\\e[m: \"\nread user\n\nif [[ -z \"$user\" ]]; then printf '\\nNo user specified!

You can be more secure by using the srm command instead of rm and it will slowly shred the files - I use srm -sz -rf instead of rm -rf below to shred once and then zero out (which ends up being two passes and then a delete - plenty secure for my needs and not as slow as the default 35 pass overwrite before the delete)\n\n\n*\n\n*Do make sure the person buying the machine knows what they are getting recovery disks for. It's really nice to make a test account to run all the updates rather than hand them the Snow Leopard disk.\n\n*Set up your Snow Leopard Mac to add one admin account named test with no password and delete any other accounts using the test account. Reboot into single user mode by holding command + s and type these exactly:\n\n    /sbin/mount -uw /\n    cd /var/db\n    srm .AppleSetupDone\n    cd dslocal/nodes/Default/users\n    srm test.plist\n    cd /Users\n    rm -rf test\n    halt\n\nYou can now boot the mac to see the setup welcome movie plays and quit the assistant a few steps in using command + q when it starts asking name questions and it will shut down with no account created but all the applications preserved. It will remember your wifi settings, so delete those before starting step 2 or use ethernet/a safe public wifi to run updates if you're worried about that sort of thing.\n\nA: Install Tiger like normal, then boot off the Snow Leopard install discs and do an upgrade-install without booting off the internal drive and making a user account. \n", "Q: Can home and end keys be mapped when using Terminal? The Home and End keys on a MacBook Pro can be emulated with Fn + ← or fFn + →.  Or when certain settings are changed, with the ⌘ Command key instead of Fn.\nNone of these works in Terminal.\nAs I frequently need to go to the beginning or end of the line and would also like to jump forwards or backwards by word.\nHow can I jump around on a line in Terminal?\n\nA: For those that prefer to use the arrow keys, hitting fnShift+Left Arrow will take you home on the command line. Similarly, fnShift+Right Arrow will take you to the end.\n\nA: This is the most effective way to make it work also with vim.\nGo to Terminal -> Preferences -> Profiles -> Keyboard and add:\nKey: ↖ Action: \\033OH\nKey: ↗ Action: \\033OF\n\nA: It sounds like you are looking for some help using readline and bash, here is an insane list of keyboard stuff modified from: http://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/features_7.html#SEC45\nCtrla     Move to the start of the line.\nCtrle     Move to the end of the line.\nEscf     Move forward a word.\nEscb     Move backward a word.\nCtrll    Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.\n\nCtrlk    Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.\nEscd     Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word. \nEscDel     Kill from the cursor the start of the previous word, or if between words, to the start of the previous word. \nCtrlw     Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace. This is different than EscDelCtrla   because the word boundaries differ.  \nCtrld     Delete the character underneath the cursor. \nCtrl_     Undo the last thing that you did. You can undo all the way back to an empty line.\n\nAnd, here is how to yank the text back into the line. Yanking means to copy the most-recently-killed text from the kill buffer.\n\nCtrly     Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the cursor. \nEscy     Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top. You can only do this if the prior command is Ctrly or Escy. \n\nA: The other answers are great and more portable, but here's \"the OS X way\" for a regular keyboard (which is opposite of many other terminals).  Try the following:\nShiftHome - Beginning of Line\nShiftEnd - End of Line\nFrom http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/tech/macbits.html\n\nA: Mapping home and end keys with your desired functionality will easily solve the problem.\nMany answers have been posted, but in case you are using zsh, you can set home to:\n\\001\n\nand set end to:\n\\005\n\nby clicking preference - profile - keyboard.\n\nA: This can be set in Terminal.app preferences\nContext\nTo answer the one about how to get the beginning or end of the line, it appears that by default Terminal maps these keys to it:\n\n*\n\n*shift+home → beginning of line, equivalent to the \"home\" key in normal terminals\n\n*shift+end → end of line, equivalent to the \"end\" key in normal terminals\n\nInstructions\nIf you want home and end to work the \"normal\" way (and not require shift), go to the Keyboard tab of the Terminal profile preferences:\n[Terminal menu] → Preferences → Profiles tab (or settings on some versions of OS X) → Keyboard sub-tab\nThen modify/add these keys to be the following \"send string to shell\". Use the code for your shell, Bash or Zsh.\nmacOS changed the default shell from Bash to Zsh in MacOS Catalina (v10.15) and later versions (BigSur and Monterey). The instructions are different for Bash and Zsh.\nZsh\n\n*\n\n*home: \\001\n\n*end: \\005\nYou can enter these codes in the edit dialog by pressing ctrl-A for /001 and ctrl-E for /005. Thanks to @JW for the Zsh information.\nAnother, unrelated, option to map home/end keys for MacOS Catalina (v10.15) and later versions (BigSur and Monterey) is to use bindkey widgets:\nsudo echo 'bindkey \"\\033[H\" beginning-of-line; bindkey \"\\033[F\" end-of-line' >> ~/.zshrc\n\nBash\n\n*\n\n*home: \\033[H\n\n*end:  \\033[F\nYou can get the \\033 part by hitting the escape key within the edit dialog input, if you need to add it.\nIn later versions of Mac OS X, if the terminal screen shifts up or down when you press the home/end key, the home key may need to be set to \\033[1~ and the end key to \\033[4~ to get the results you want (no shift needed).\nConclusion\nThen home and end will work like normal again (phew).\nAlso note that \"alt + ←\" and \"alt + →\" by default in terminal map to word left and word right, another handy combo to remember.\nFeel free to modify this answer to add more useful key bindings, as it is a community wiki.\n\nA: You can move one word at a time with option+left and option+right.\nRegarding using home and end, Terminal's default bindings are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*shift+home → jump to beginning of line\n\n*shift+end → jump to end of line\n\n*home → scroll to top of scroll-back buffer\n\n*end → scroll to bottom of scroll-back buffer\n\n\nIn many other terminal apps (on multiple platforms), those modified and unmodified pairs are reversed (i.e. naked home and end are used to jump around the current line and the modified versions (whether by shift or something else) are used to navigate the scroll-back buffer). You can reverse Terminal's bindings to work that way if you wish by doing the following:\nGo to Terminal menu → Preferences → Settings/Profile tab → Keyboard sub-tab.\nThen modify the key–action pairs to be the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*↖︎: Send text: \\033[H\n\n*⇧↖︎: Scroll To Top\n\n*↘︎: Send text: \\033[F\n\n*⇧↘︎: Scroll To Bottom\n\n\nNote: \\033 is entered into the text-to-be-sent box in the Edit dialog by pressing the escape key.\nWhile there, you may want to similarly swap the bindings of modified and unmodified page up and page down, to keep things consistent: pressing a navigation key with shift represents a command to Terminal itself (to navigate the scroll-back buffer like a document), while pressing one without sends the key-press through to whatever's running within it (e.g. bash, less, nano, screen, etc.). The key–action pairs for that are:\n\n\n*\n\n*⇞: Send text: \\033[5~\n\n*⇧⇞: Scroll Page Up\n\n*⇟: Send text: \\033[6~\n\n*⇧⇟: Scroll Page Down\n\n\nA: Use control+a for HOME and control+e for END in Terminal.\nAlso use esc+f to move to the beginning of the next word and esc+b to move to the beginning of the current word.  (you Must be careful about current and next)\n\nA: I'd like to provide an alternative solution to this problem. This works great if you are a vi user. Vim Key Bindings in Terminal provides a way to use your terminal in a vim style. You can do this through typing set -o vi in terminal and feel free to put it in .bash_profile if you want. After this, your terminal is effectively a vim editor. You can use esc key to go into command mode and walk around in a vim way. For example, 0 gets you to the beginning and $ gets you to the end. You can also use I and A to go to the beginning and the end and go into editing mode right away. w and b let you move forward and backward by one word. And if you try to go into visual mode by pressing v, you will be given a vim editor and the text you have when you leave this editor will be executed in the terminal. \nBe advised that this vim key binding will nullify all the hotkeys you learned from other answers. \n\nA: here's the list in printable form, as desired :)\nhttp://pastebin.com/uCqwn7qs\nI also fixed a \"bug\" in the description. This is what you could originally read in the instructions:\nESC-d Kill from the cursor the start of the previous word, or if between words, to the start of the previous word. \nThis smells badly like a cut-and-paste mistake, since both partial sentences tell the very same thing. Telling from plain logic, first half must actually read \"from the cursor to the start of the current word\".\n\nA: \n... what about jumping around by word?

I'd assume something like:\nopen /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app\n\nBut that does nothing (maybe it's loading the Terminal application which is already open instead of launching a new Terminal window).  And of course it doesn't cd into a directory as I haven't specified that...\n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, if you open a folder with Terminal it will create a new terminal at that location. e.g., you can drag a folder onto the Terminal application icon, or into a tab bar to create a new tab, and there are Services (New Terminal at Folder) you can use from the contextual menu to open a new window or tab for a selected folder in Finder or other applications (or even a pathname selected in text).\nTo do the equivalent from the command-line (or a shell script):\nopen -a Terminal /path/to/folder\n\nThis is the command-line equivalent of dragging the folder onto the Terminal application icon. (You can also supply a full path for Terminal if you want to specify a particular copy/version of the application.)\n\nA: Here is a small script I knocked up :\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\non run argv\n  set dir to quoted form of (first item of argv)\n  tell app \"Terminal\" to do script \"cd \" & dir\nend run\n\nIf you save this and make it executable\nchmod +x script_filename\n\nand then run it \nscript_filename ~/Desktop\n\nthen it will open up a new terminal window and change to the directory in the argument.\n\nA: I'm not sure if the following works from a bash script, but at least I found out how to open specific tabs in specific directories:\nIn the Preferences, under Settings, you copy the profile that you would normally like to use.  Under Shell, you can tell it to \"Run command\": cd /some/directory.  You will also want to check \"Run inside shell\".  Optionally, you can specify a title under Window.\nAdd more profiles in this manner.\nThen close all terminal windows, then open a profile in a new window, plus another profile in a new tab, plus another profile in a new tab.  Now you have a window with three tabs.  Save this as a window group.\nFrom now on, whenever you have Terminal running, you can open this window group, and you will get a new window with these tabs in these directories.\nOpen question: how do I tell Terminal to open a new window group, from a bash script?\n", "Q: iPhone app to show me my locations database It seems that Apple stores GPS information (or GPS information of  hot spots) in the iPhone/iPad, and a hacker invented a tool to show the info on Mac. I think this is a pretty useful feature for automatically recording what I've been visiting.\nAre there any apps for iPad/iPhone to track my GPS info so that I can extract the data to display on Mac later? \n\nA: I'm afraid that, without a jailbreak, you won't find any apps that do this for you using your 'locations database' (the \"tracking\" you're talking about). There are two main reasons:\n1: According to Apple, the file is protected. Besides, apps don't get access to system files anyway.\n2: Such an app would probably scare some people, and Apple would never allow it on the App store.\nMaybe we'll see some apps for jailbroken phones, but I wouldn't expect anything to come to the standard App Store.\n\nA: There are plenty of Apps that can store GPS co-ordinates for you.  Have a look through the Navigation section on the app store.  Paths is a popular choice.  You can then export the data that is collected and use it in a variety of ways on your Mac (including Google Earth etc).\nNote: This does not use the GPS data that Apple have been storing.  This data will not be available after the next iOS update as written about here.\n\nA: While not exactly what you're requesting, Google Latitude has an app that does exactly what you want on iOS 4+. For iOS 3, you can use Longitude along with it as well, on cydia.\nLatitude basically keeps track of every place you've been. The app polls data in it ever so often and you can also \"check in\" from any web browser just by logging in.\nIt even has a funny chart of how much you've traveled compared with the distance to the moon:\n\n", "Q: Syncing Linux server data with data on my Mac I have a Linux server that stores some files, and I want to sync them with my Mac.\nI can mount the directory of the server, so after mounting it's just  directory to directory sync. There are thousands of files, so the sync tool should be smart enough to sync only the changed files. \nIs there any Mac software out there that does this automatically (or at a scheduled time)? The expected action is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the directory in a server.\n\n*Sync intelligently.\n\n*Unmount. \n\n\nA: You can combine the GUI-based arRsync tool for OS X with the use of /net to automount the share to achieve what you desire.\nThe remote share will be automatically mounted as long as you access as /net/hostname/exportname. So use that path in arRsync and when you fire the sync it'll automount and then scan and sync just the deltas.\nThere's good old command line rsync available if you prefer. It ships with OS X. Here is the manual page for it.\n\nA: Dropbox might also be of use. It provides automatic syncing of folders and does that in the \"smart\" way that you described.\nIt has clients of windows, linux and osx.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/\n", "Q: Simplenote or Evernote or something else?

Is there an app/prefPane handling this? Or do I have to change icon every time an app updates?\n\nA: You have to change the icon every time it updates because, as you have correctly pointed out, the Package is replaced and therefore your icon is overwritten by the original one. \nTo make your life easier, you might want to take a look at CandyBar, it makes that job easier :)\n\nA: One solution I've found is to create an alias for the application (Using 'Right Click' > 'Create Alias') and then store the actual application someplace out of sight. Then, you can change the alias's icon and it'll function exactly the same.\nSince aliases only redirect you to the app, they don't actually become updated when used, meaning that the icon should never change.\n", "Q: Can't change Google Chrome icon For every other application package I've looked at, there's a Paste option available in Edit menu after selecting the icon in \"Get Info\" dialog.

I'm sure there are apps for handling this, is there a way to do it without one?\n\nA: Right click on the package, \"show package content\", then go in the \"ressources\" folder and change the icon there.

I upgraded the memory from 4 GB to 8 GB (the Crucial kit) and since then I had this problem twice. Maybe it doesn't mean anything because I have the MBP for only 2 weeks and I upgraded the memory after a few days, so the statistics are maybe meaningless.\nMy question is: do you have this problem sometimes ? Should I check something in particular to try to avoid that ? Is it possible that the memory is incorrectly installed (very unlikely...) ? Is it in any case a memory problem ?\n\nA: *\n\n*No, this is not a common issue and should not occur under normal circumstances. It's an indication that something unexpected (and unrecoverable) happened. That screen is the final net for catching a problem before your computer is completely locked.\n\n*If you just got new RAM, I'd try removing it an using the computer for a few days. If the problem persists, there might be a hardware problem and since the computer is new, you can take it to an App Store.\n\n*If you have \"external\" peripherals (drives, Audio interfaces, etc.) try working without them for a while. \nLast but not least, act now that the box is new, don't let it \"wait\" because it didn't happen again in two weeks. If the above happened more than once in a short time frame on a new machine, there's something wrong. That's been my experience. \n\nA: Most likely, it's the RAM since it's the last thing you changed.\nYou can check the kernel panic logs under:\n  Console -> DIAGNOSTIC AND USAGE INFORMATION\nWhen I had RAM problems I noticed that my KP logs weren't consistent in either the process name or backtrace, which makes sense for a RAM problem but could also apply to other hardware problems.\nI was able to narrow it down to my 3rd party RAM using the stress test feature in Prime95. This was enough evidence to get replacement RAM from the merchant. Apple's hardware test never found a problem.\n", "Q: Charge an iPad on MacBook running Win7 There are half a dozen questions here why the iPad doesn't charge (or displays this at least) on most Windows machines. I have one more to add.\nOf course my iPad (1st gen) does charge on my MacBook (late 2008) under Mac OS X. However, when I boot Win 7 in Boot Camp, it says \"not charging\".\nAs I see, the logic board is capable to deliver sufficient power. Why does this change under Windows? And what could I do about this, since I do need to use Windows sometimes and I'd like to charge my post-PC device then.\n\nA: Despite the fact that your iPad says it's not charging under Windows, it will in fact charge if the display is off. Check your battery percentage, attach the iPad and turn off the display (standard locking by pressing the power button once); check back in 30 minutes or so and you'll see that you've definitely gained several percent, as much as 10% in that time.\nAs to why the iPad indicates that it's charging under OS X but not under Windows I cannot say. Fortunately it's lying. :)\n\nA: It's entirely possible that the OS does some negotiation with the iPad before running the USB port up to full current, and that Windows isn't set up to do that with the proper driver.\n\nA: I use a free program called Ai Charger made by ASUS. Works on all motherboards, not just ASUS http://event.asus.com/mb/2010/ai_charger/\n\nA: With my late-2007 Macbook, my iPod Touch gives me a \"charging not supported\" message when I plug into the front USB port but works fine on the back one. Have you tried both USB ports?\n\nA: It's charging. It just says its not. Happens to mine too. \n\nA: If you look at your iPad charger you will see it has 2.5A and a regular USB port can only give you 500mA. So it's quite useless to charge your iPad from computer. If it says 'not charging', then there is not enough voltage (the voltage may get lower when you connect 'hungry' devices). But I can't get why it may be different in OS X and Win.\n", "Q: Kernel panics; Apple hardware test error codes... Bad memory? My MacMini, which I bought new around Thanksgiving 2010 from Amazon, has been having quite a few kernel panics. They aren't consistent in any way, but they have become more frequent and now many apps seem to be crashing more as well and I have also noticed Spotlight and Alfred have become painfully slow.\nI was about to reinstall Snow Leopard and start from scratch after making a SuperDuper clone on an external for backup when I read on the Apple CD that you can run an \"Apple Hardware Test\" by holding \"D\" during startup.\nI figured it was worth checking out. Especially since my memory is non-original. I had put 2x 4GB Corsair sticks in it right away that I also got from Amazon a few months before then which I had used in my previous early-2009 MacMini. The memory seemed to have worked fine in both computers. All 8 GB were being recognized. These kernel panics only started happening a few months ago.\nNow the Apple Hardware tests, which I tried in every conceivable configuration; swapping slots, removing one then the other etc., did in fact show errors. I wrote down two of the error codes. I believe there were only two unique codes; I suppose the different stick arrangements I used is cause for the variances, but it's possible there were more, but I know for a fact they all started out with the same characters, 4MEM/9/40000000: .\n4MEM/9/40000000: 0xa90c1418 & 4MEM/9/40000000: 0xa95de698\nHowever, the strange thing is the Apple Hardware Test only showed this error when I had BOTH sticks installed; either stick in either slot on it's own showed no error. As I mentioned earlier, I tested all possible configurations because I had read that sometimes it could be a faulty slot.\nSo, with that information, does anyone have an idea how to fix my Mac. Do I need to replace one or both sticks? Is it something else? Is there an app I can use to help diagnose the issue?\nAs I'm writing, I realized I can still try using both the original sticks that came with the Mac at the same time, but I need to find them. I may wait until tomorrow to try that.\n\nA: It sounds like some sort of RAM issue for sure, and there are a few memtest based programs out there to try and run and see if you run into problems.\nRember is a gui based memtest, and applejack is a fairly well known utility script that also contains it.\nI dont know why you only got the error with a specific configuration of ram, but with 8GB of addressable space it can take a while to find the bad guy.\n\nA: I agree with hobs. I recently had a similar problem - random KPs that didn't point to any single process. I tracked it down using Prime95. It has a stress test which according to their README indicates that any errors are almost certainly tied to a hardware problem. Swapping RAM and running the test I was able to confirm that my 3rd party RAM was bad. I should note, Apple's hardware test never found a problem, nor did I find one with memtest (but I probably gave up too soon).\n\nA: I found my old stock RAM that came with my Mac and swapped it out and the kernel panics and app crashing stopped. I used it for a few days just to be sure. Then I went back and stuck in only one of the third party 4GB sticks and within an hour I had a few app crashes and a kernel panic. Then I swapped it with the other third party 4GB stick and after a week of use, it seems to be in working condition fortunately.\nSo ultimately, the answer is the app crashing and kernel panics were definitely due to faulty RAM.\n", "Q: Distributing an app for all company iPads If I build an iPad app for a company (for internal use), do I need to commit it to the App Store to install it on all company devices ?\n\nA: Please see the following links from stackoverflow.com:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS installing apps without app store\n\n*iPhone app without AppStore\n\n*Private iPhone App, without App Store?\n", "Q: What is the keyboard shortcut for editing a cell in Excel?

Ctrl + U appears to no longer work as a shortcut key for editing cells in Excel 2016 for Mac. Instead the F2 key must be used. Depending on the keyboard settings on your particular Mac, to trigger F2 (instead of increasing screen brightness), you may have to hold down the \"function\" key (fn) while also hitting F2.

However when I try to and open it, it tells me that I do not meet system requirements. I did a software update check and updated all of my software.\n\n\nWhy can can't I open Xcode? And what can I do to fix the problem?\n\nA: According to the crash log, it can't find the DVTFoundation framework that Xcode needs to run.  It seems extremely curious to me that Xcode is running straight off of the Desktop.  Xcode comes with an installer, which (by default) will put it and all other things inside /Developer.  You can change it to another folder, but even then Xcode is still within the \"Applications\" folder of the parent folder.  In other words, there's no way to get Xcode off by itself on the Desktop unless you copied it there or didn't install it properly.\nXcode, like a couple other Apple apps, requires a whole bunch of supporting things to run (like this DVTFoundation framework).  You have to leave it in the place where it was installed.  Moving it to another folder is a great way to make it not work (yes, I know this isn't ideal, but it is what it is).\nTo fix this, trash the Xcode.app on your Desktop and re-run the installer.\n\nA: Your copy of Xcode is running from your desktop folder (which should be fine) but it's not seeing a library / framework file it needs.\nIf you got Xcode from the app store - delete the app (and all other copies of Xcode 4 that may be on your system) and re-download it from the MAS.\nIf you are a paid developer - you'll want to re-run the installer to make sure everything is installed in the same folder. /Xcode4 is the default - but you should be able to let the installer install everything on your desktop and it should work, but you might have better luck leaving it in the default location. Do look for duplicates Xcode copies in case it's seeing an older framework from somewhere else on your. \nDon't forget the developer discussions where everyone uses Xcode daily.\n\nA: Confirm the location from where you are launching the XCode.app.\nIt has to be launched from /Developers/Application. Then only it will be able to find out all the frameworks & files.\n", "Q: How can I add some SSD goodness to my MBP? I have a decently modern (late-2010) Macbook Pro, with a 7200 RPM 500GB HD. I need this much space, but I'd like to have an SSD for compiling code, running the OS, and running games.\nIs there any way to add an SSD to my machine? Without voiding its warranty? If not, what's a good choice for a 500GB replacement SSD?\n\nA: Warranty coverage gets denied if you present your mac for service and it's obvious that damage has been caused that wasn't made in the factory. Adding anything that isn't user replaceable (according to the user manual from Apple) means special tools, special training, and/or limited availability of proper replacement parts. Not being static safe can cause damage to other components, so it's not so much \"can you install the hard drive\" and more \"will you not damage anything else while you're in there\".\nYou'll want to ask the seller if the replacement drive has equivalent temperature sensors and firmware to work with your mac and what their return policy is if you find your mac won't sleep or overheats with a replacement drive added. The risks are very low for DIY repairs if you take your time and can work on things small as eyeglasses screws. But the cost of failure could be a major repair - logic boards are often in the $600 to $800 range. Once you have a unibody back off, that part is exposed. Use care to not disturb the battery - a loose screw between the battery and case is a serious fire hazard.\nI find the manuals at ifixit.com to be a great place to see how involved a repair is so I know if it's worth investing in the tools and time to attempt a repair.\nArmed with more information, you can decide how much your time is worth and whether you want to pay a professional.\nThe pros will let you know to bring the mac back so they can put in the original HD for warranty service and they will ensure their work is up to Apple's standards so you don't lose warranty protection.\nDIY is an awesome feeling and less expensive when things go well.\nAs to specifics, there are some great mid price level SSD around and the kits for mounting a SATA drive in place of the optical drive from MCE and OWC look to be equally fabulous items. The new SSD that run at 6Gbps are starting to ship so the \"old\" models are starting to drop in price. I plan to take advantage of this price drop and grab an SSD myself in the June time frame. Adding about any SSD will add significant snap and more useful life to any 4 year old or less MacBook Pro.\n\nA: The warranty issue is a gray area and you will want an \"Apple Certified\" tech to do the drive replacement for you, and even then, you might be out of luck.\nIn any case, you can certainly change your internal drive for an SSD or add another SSD to the machine (effectively replacing the optical drive) and -should you require Warranty- put everything back where it was and pretend nothing happened :) If you are careful (and you should) when you install the drives, there shouldn't be anything to worry about.\nThe starting point for all this is OWC - Mac Sales, they have good drives and the \"kits\" to replace your optical drive. \nJust do it. You won't look back.\n\nA: Remiel has a great, detailed blog post on this.\n\nA: I've done this just recently, it is really worth the speed increase.\nHave a look at my post here for details on how to do it: http://applelife.tv/2011/05/add-solid-state-drive-ssd/\n", "Q: Low brightness setting doesn't \"stick\" in iBooks I like to read in iBooks with the brightness turned down, but I have to re-adjust this every time I open the app.  Is there a way to make my brightness setting \"stick\"?\n\nA: On the off chance you weren't already aware, you can modify the system-wide brightness by double-tapping the home button and swiping the \"shelf\" to the left.\niBooks can set a lower brightness than the system will allow outside the application -- so if you frequently set it lower than the system's lowest setting, you'll have to make that change every time you open the app.  As you can see in the screenshot below, when the iPad is at it's lowest system brightness, the iBooks brightness bar is at about 20%.\n\n\nA: It is well documented that iBooks uses a non-documented, private API to modify brightness and you can clearly see some of the side effects of this since that setting does not stick and is confusing since it doesn't stick across sessions because it is not using the main settings but instead temporarily overriding them.\nOnly Apple can say whether this behavior is by design or a bug, but as a user you might want to officially send them some general feedback as they clearly felt it was a good enough to ship. You can also leave a review for iBooks in the App Store but that's generally less effective than a bug report or direct feedback about a problem. If enough people request a change, it stands a better chance of change in an upcoming releas.\n\nA: I have been asking myself the same question for quite some time. Sadly I couldn't \"fix\" it. \nThe iPhone/Pad goes back to the brightness you have in the Settings every time, and in fact, the iBooks app, changes the brightness of the whole phone/pad, but as soon as it's \"suspended\" and \"woken\" it reverts back to the settings you had in the settings.\n\nA: There is a way to actually make your entire screen go darker\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to settings > General > accessibility > zoom > toggle on\n\n*Double tap with 3 fingers on the screen\n\n*Hit the drop down bar at the bottom of the window\n\n*Choose filter\n\n*Low light\n\n*Hit full screen zoom\n\n*Double  tap again\n\n\nTo make it as fast as sonic do these steps: Settings > General > Accessibility > Accessibility shortcuts > Zoom\nTriple tap home button for low light\n", "Q: What can you use the iPod 4th generation bluetooth for? I am wondering what I can use the bluetooth capability in the iPod touch fourth generation for? I tried to pair it to a Motorola headset, but I was not able to pair it. \nJailbreaking is not an option for me. :)\n\nA: The iPod touch 4th gen should allow you to do the following:\niPhone, iPad, iPod touch: Supported Bluetooth profiles\n\nWith A2DP:\nThis profile defines how high quality audio (stereo or mono) can be streamed from one device to another over a Bluetooth connection. For example, music can be streamed from a mobile phone, to a wireless headset, hearing aid & cochlear implant streamer, or car audio or from a laptop/desktop to a wireless headset.\nWith AVRCP:\nThis profile is designed to provide a standard interface to control TVs, Hi-fi equipment, etc. to allow a single remote control (or other device) to control all of the A/V equipment to which a user has access. It may be used in concert with A2DP or VDP.\nWith PAN:\nThis profile is intended to allow the use of Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol on Layer 3 protocols for transport over a Bluetooth link.\nWith HID:\nProvides support for devices such as mice, joysticks, keyboards, as well as sometimes providing support for simple buttons and indicators on other types of devices. It is designed to provide a low latency link, with low power requirements. PlayStation 3 controllers and Wii Remotes also use Bluetooth HID.\n-From Wikipedia\nIf you are having problems pairing, try out iPhone and iPod touch: Third-party headsets, headphones, and car kits\n\nA: You can use the bluetooth for:\n\n\n*\n\n*External keyboard\n\n*Stereo speakers or headphones (Not handsfree headset) for music and audio\n\n*Local multiplayer games with other iOS devices\n\n\nThere are a few other uses, but the above are some of the more common uses for it.\n\nA: Reading your responses to the other comments, I realize another potential problem for you.  Skype on mobile devices don't support bluetooth devices.  I'm sorry to be the one to let you know.  It isn't due to the iPod touch or Apple but it's an unsupported feature from Skype.  Here is the link that shows the list of supported and unsupported features for Skype mobile.\n", "Q: Is there a way to trace the reason 'fseventsd' process hogs CPU? I run Mac OSX 10.6 and noticed that a process 'fseventsd' was taking 100% CPU and 1.5G RAM. Doing a google search, I found that this could be tied to Time Machine. \nHowever, I do not run Time Machine on this computer.\nIs there a way to trace the source of the resource hog? Does it log to anywhere? A restart 'fixed' the issue, but I'm sure it will come back if I can't figure out why it began in the first place.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: fseventd is the filesystem event logging process, you can read a lot about it in the ars technica review of Mac OS X Leopard. You can use programs like fseventer to see the same kind of output it sees.\nFrom the article:\n\nThe FSEvents framework relies on a\n  single, constantly running daemon\n  process called fseventsd that reads\n  from /dev/fsevents and writes the\n  events to log files on disk (stored in\n  a .fseventsd directory at the root of\n  the volume the events are for). That's\n  it. That's the super-high-tech\n  solution: just write the events to a\n  log file. Boring, pragmatic, but quite\n  effective.\n\nYou can check that log though I dont know how useful it will be for you. I would not be that surprised to see Time Machine, which deals with many files, and sometimes many many tiny files, to possibly cause some issues with fsevents.\n\nA: Either one program was stuck in a very efficient loop writing changes that caused fseventsd to have a lot of work or it's an infinite loop itself processing an unresolvable data structure on one of the mounted volumes.\nIn the prior case - programs like fseventer that read the same stream of data will likely hang as well - you'll now have two processes at 50% utilization trying to process an infinite amount of data. (This is a great data point if you are poking to see what's amiss.) It's analagous to  questions asking why syslogd is taking all the CPU - usually it's some other program gone nuts causing it a lot of work.\nWhen/if it happens again - start quitting programs and consider logging out. You will know if the offending item is a system level process or a user level process. fs_usage might be useful to see what specific programs are IO heavy.\nfsck from a boot into single user mode is usually required if you have circular hard links or other degenerate file system shenanigans that can cause this sort of spike in activity.\n", "Q: How can I do a Full Backup of my iTunes library (including Playlists and Album Art) to an external Hard Disk? How can I backup my iTunes library (including album art and playlists) to an external Hard Disk 1?  iTunes only seems to allow full backups to discs.  \nFWIW, this is on a Win7 machine.  \n\nA: Luckily, Apple has heard your cries:\niTunes: Back up your iTunes library by copying to an external hard drive:\n\nConsolidate Library\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open iTunes Preferences: \n  \n*Choose iTunes > Preferences. \n  \n*Click Advanced.\n  \n*Make sure the option to \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to\n  library\" is selected.\n  \n*Click OK. \n  \n  \n  Note: After you click OK, iTunes\n  copies any files that are added that\n  weren't already in the iTunes Media\n  folder and places the copies in the\n  folder.

I know how to capture stuff I am doing on my computer as screencast but how do you build a dynamic presentations. What are the tools available for a mac user.\n\nA: I've used ScreenFlow to do this a number of times.  It's very simple to use and worth the $100.  You can buy it off the website or from the Mac App Store.\nAlso, until 13 May 2011, you can buy it as part of the MacLegion bundle, which means you'd get it (plus a number of applications) for $50.  However, that will be a non-MacAppStore license: http://maclegion.com/\n\nA: As Dave suggested above I'll use ScreenFlow.  As for animation, I'm not quite sure.  I can't tell from a screencapture.  My guess is that the buttons appeared clicked?  Well, to do this you would created two image files in whatever photo editor you prefer (like Photoshop).  One image would show the buttons not pressed, the other pressed.  On the screencast timeline you would simply put these two images side by side.  When played, it appears clicked (100% feasible in Screenflow).  Hope that helps you.  If not, please describe the animation in more detail.\n\nA: I did not view the linked video but, For very simple animations, I've used keynote: http://www.apple.com/iwork/tutorials/#keynote \nThere are a couple of very cool, simple things you can do. then export that presentation as quicktime (with a fixed time) and add it to your screencast.  \n", "Q: How can I enable SSH without using the gui or apple script on snow leopard? A while back here How can I enable Internet sharing without using the GUI or AppleScript? I asked if any one knows how to enable Internet sharing without using GUI or apple script, I still have that problem but I thought this one should be easier, I want to be able to SSH into my machine but sure enough I can't go to the \"sharing\" pane in the Preferences (It crashes). How can I start sshd? \n\nA: You can enable SSH from the Terminal with:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\n\n(note that you need to run this as an admin, and it'll ask for your admin password, which won't echo as you type.)\n\nA: Here's the command to start VNC sharing -- not SSH, but perhaps it will help you (be sure to replace the password with your own!):\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes -clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw PutYourOwnPasswordHere -restart -agent -privs -all\n\nThen you should be able to log in using a VNC client with the password you specified.\nHere's the command to stop sharing:\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -configure -access -off\n\nNote that the Sharing pane will NOT show that sharing is active when you turn it on this way via the command line!\nSource: http://technotes.twosmallcoins.com/?p=279\n\nA: sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on\nsudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off\n\n", "Q: EDID loss on HDMI switching I have a LCD tv hooked up to an HDMI switcher flipping between a Mac Mini (2006 snow leopard using a DVI - HDMI cable), cable tv and dvd player. \nTrouble is, whenever the switch goes away from mac the picture is blank when coming back. \nHaving looked into it extensively it seems that the mac polls for edid data from the screen once only. Once the screen is disconnected, the mac won't poll for it again and doesn't \"see\" the edid from the tv anymore - hence no output from the mac. To double check, when I vnc into the mac it goes to a default 4:3 screen not the widescreen. \nThere is a supposed hardware solution that buffers the edid and keeps it live - effectively fooling the mac to think the display is there all the time, even when switched to another source. This is a crazy solution requiring an extra box, extra power consumption and anywhere between £50 and £100 (upto $150). \nThen I found a little script called HDMI reviver, but that didn't work for me either. \nCan anyone explain (to an idiot) how to get the Mac to read, keep and store the EDID and always broadcast a signal, even when the HDMI switch isn't looking for it?\n\nA: I've noticed the same thing. I have not come up with an elegant solution (and in fact, you sound better educated on the problem than I am).\nThis definitely falls under the category of \"kludge\" but it does work. Access the TV-connected Mac from another Mac on the same network using Screen Sharing (technically this would work under any VNC connection). Go into System Preferences: Displays and click the \"Detect Displays\" button. You could speed this up a little by adding a Displays menu to the menubar--\"detect displays\" is right there, and easier to get at.\nThis suggests that it should be possible to script the interaction so that with a combination of a programmable remote, Remote Buddy, and a suitable macro, you could force the Mac to re-recognize the screen. Still not ideal, but it should be workable.\n", "Q: How to copy paste Xcode warnings? Is there a way to copy paste the content of this warnings in Xcode ?\n\n\nA: Yes.  If you go to the Issue Navigator (cmd-4), you'll see a list of build warnings and errors.  You can select one from the list and hit cmd-c.  You'll get something like this:\n\n/Users/dave/Developer/Cocoa/EmptyFoundation/EmptyFoundation.m:180:15:{178:2-178:6}{178:2-178:7}: warning: conversion specifies type 'unsigned long long' but the argument has type 'NSUInteger' (aka 'unsigned long') [-Wformat,7]\n\n\nA: I know it's possible in Xcode 4.

Take a look: http://support.apple.com/specs/#w89253hx64c\n\nA: You didn't specify whether you have the 15\" or 17\" model, but both support 8GB of RAM.  Crucial.com has a great \"Memory Advisor Tool\" to help you find the memory specs of any computer.\nHere are the specs of a 15\" MacBook Pro that matches the \"About This Mac\" screenshot you linked to above.\n\n\nA: Mactracker is excellent for this sort of thing.

I want to be able to put an 11\" Macbook Air into a backpack and run to work/gym with it. Is that safe to do that, given these devices have no moving hard drive parts? What about the other components, would they handle shaking?\nBonus points: is there any backpack made specifically for doing this?\n\nA: There are definitely no moving parts. I wouldn't worry about jogging with it. I wouldn't even worry about jogging with a non-flash drive equipped laptop if it was turned off. The drive spindles and heads are immobile when the drive is powered down.\nFor a pack, look for something that suspends the laptop away from the sides. Preferably holding it in something that'll absorb the shock a bit.\n\nA: I jog to school with my MBP 15\" everyday. So far I've had only 1 total hard disk failure, so I guess it'll be fine to run with a MacBook Air.\n\nA: I'm going to disagree with the conclusion of some here; that you should look for a sprung or suspended bag for your laptop.\nIntroducing an extra source of load oscillation may well increase risk of damage to both your laptop and to you. Movement means rubbing, which means skin damage. It could also increase the risk of things like knee injuries if you hit the wrong combination of factors.\nYour legs are the best shock absorbers you could hope for. I'd suggest strapping your laptop as tightly as you can so that it doesn't move around inside the bag.\n\nA: In addition to Ian's answer, you might want to check Brenthaven cases and backpacks. I've had a \"Trek\" one (and they seem to be about to release a new one) and they are very good for doing sports (I rode a bike). Maybe for jogging it's a little bit \"bulky\" but give it a look.\nThey are usually for 15''++ inch laptops.\n\nA: Your SSD won't risk data loss as a HDD might, but a computer is a mechanical assembly of parts with mass, attached to one another with fasteners (generically speaking - yes I know some of them are glued, soldered, snapped together, etc.)  Over time I would expect the repeated shocks could loosen things up to some extent.  I'm thinking specifically of the cover hinge, cable connectors, and parts held by small screws.  I'd at least look for the type of backpack that has an internal suspension for the laptop.\n", "Q: How to add user to a group on command line? With Linux/Unix, I can use useradd -G developers vivek to add vivek to the developer group.

I have been leaving my iPad plugged into my dock and just keeping the Remote app running to display the album art.\nWhich leaves me wondering, is there some sort of 'live news feed' app that I can get for my iPad just to display my rss feeds in a glanceable manner which will automatically update my rss feed?\n\nA: The best way I can think of to do this is to use Tweetdeck.  Tweetdeck scrolls tweets as they come in.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new twitter account eg joshhnews\n\n*Add your RSS feeds to this TwitterFeed service (free), and link it to the new twitter account\n\n*In TweetDeck follow this new Twitter account.\n\n\nYou will then see the news stream through live with clickable links to the articles etc.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: There is a twitter app called Trickle for iPad/iPhone that automatically scrolls through single tweets from accounts you follow on twitter in large text on the screen. You can configure the refresh speed between 1 to 60 minutes as well as how long each tweet is displayed on the screen. Not one I know of that will do this for RSS feeds directly but twitter is a great service for at a glance news. The Trickle app costs 99 cents on the AppStore and is universal\n\nA: If you happen to aggregate your feeds in Google Reader, it looks like GoReader for the iPad ($5) might work well for you.\nEDIT: As RobZolkos pointed out, GoReader only syncs automatically on startup.  After that, you have to manually tap the refresh button to fetch new articles.  Apparently, all current iOS feed readers work this way.  I'm not sure if this is a limitation of the SDK or if an auto-refresh feature has just not occurred to any of the developers.\n", "Q: How do I burn a single ( > 7GB) file to multiple DVDs? I have single file that is 7GB that I want to burn to multiple DVDs. Is there a way to do this that's built into Mac OS X? \nWhen I try through the finder, it informs me there is too much data and tells me to remove files and try again--so I realize it doesn't work that way. I've seen information about doing it through a shell script, but those seem too \"Unix\"-y, and this is something I'd like to be able to hand to a friend to copy.\nFailing anything built-in, can you recommend software (paid or free) to accomplish this task?\n\nA: The built-in way is to use the split command in the Terminal, which, yes, is Unix-y. Alternatively, .rar files can split a single file into multiple files. You might check out SimplyRAR for this route.\n\nA: Another alternative is to use Dual-Layer media. Dual-Layer DVDs give you 9.4GB per disk. Assuming > 7GB is not > 9.4GB, and you have a Dual-Layer burner, then you could do that instead of splitting the files up.\n\nA: If you want to go commercial, you have a few choices. In no particular order, these are two \"big\" players:\nRoxio Toast\n$79.99: Probaby one of the most complete packages out there. It explicitly says that it will copy a single Dual Layer to multiple single layer dvds (what you want) in their copy page. Expensive but complete. It has been one of the \"first\" programs to bring easy to use CD/DVD copy features to the Mac, because the Finder was very \"limited\" and not everybody wanted to use iTunes to copy their music (because it lacked certain features). Toast added all those missing features.\nDisco\n$19.99: A cheaper (with less features) and very decent alternative to Toast. It's a new player (compared to Toast) but it's a very simple to use application and I remember generating certain buzz because of the smoke effect while copying. It also mentions exactly what you need:\n\nHave more files than you can fit on a single disc but don't feel like manually weeding them out and dividing them? Well, Disco can handle it for you. If Disco detects the total size of the files you're burning is bigger than the disc, it will try to divide them amongst multiple discs so that they fit.\n\nAnd they even show a screenshot of how the program \"automatically\" informs you about the number of disks.\nI'm sure both programs offer respective trial versions so, decide for yourself if you need a super-I-can-do-a-lot-of-things type of program (Toast) or a more simple-I-do-a-lot-of-things-and-I-cost-less (Disco) type.\nMy (not requested) opinion is: unless your job consists of creating DVDs all day with different types of content and a lot of \"etceteras\", I'd go with Disco.

You can use as many devices to sync you want.\n", "Q: Checkers Game on Mac 10.4.11 I need to install Checkers game on my Mac 10.4.11 for my HCI project.

OEM versions are one or the other, so you will want to make sure you're ordering the right version - for a new MBP, 64-bit unless you have a compelling reason to go with 32-bit.\n2) OEM versions are tied to the hardware they are installed on and cannot be moved, ever.  This MAY be an issue if you are planning on using virtualization software against your bootcamp installation, since the VM \"hardware\" looks different from the real hardware.\n3) OEM versions do not come with telephone support from MS.\nThere is NO difference in the actual executable code, and so it would work just fine on an MBP.  As for the SKUs, again, it would make no difference.  The higher-end SKUs add additional features, not additional hardware support.\nI do have a few questions for you.  Which Windows application(s) are you tied to?    What are the specs of the hardware you are ordering?  Depending on your answers, it MAY make more sense to consider virtualization so that you can run that one or two Windows applications \"on top\" of MacOS and have access to both sets of applications at the same time.\n", "Q: Are there any ipad applications or utilities that allow you to enter handwriting into a text field? I've seen various iPad applications that allow you to take notes in your own handwriting. I'm wondering if there are any options for allowing a user to input handwritten data into input fields on web page and convert the handwriting into text.\nFor example, Windows Tablet edition had this functionality built in. They had an \"Input Panel\" button, which resembles a small window with a pen over it. You would then write your text in the Input Panel window and the Tablet PC would automatically convert it to text after a short delay.\nI'm hoping to find something similar for the iPad, if it exists.\n\nA: There is no native way to input handwritten data into input fields on a web page.  However there are a few workarounds (not elegant but may help).\nUsing an application like WritePad for iPad, you could handwrite your text, have the application convert it to text and then cut and paste the text into the browser.\n\nA: The short answer is that, no, it is currently not possible to enter text into webpage form fields on the iPad using your handwriting.  This would have to be implemented in a third-party browser or by Apple in their own Mobile Safari browser.  You could try submitting a Safari feature request with Apple (select \"iOS\" as your operating system).\nBe aware, though, that Apple is generally against using handwriting for input on their mobile devices because they see it as inelegant and unwieldy.  It adds complexity because it requires a stylus for best use -- plus, it's a tough programming challenge to get right.  Apple encourages their third-party developers to use simpler \"touch\" interfaces whenever possible.\nThat said, I would bet that Apple has some talented engineers working on handwriting recognition in a lab somewhere, so there's always a chance they'll release that feature \"when it's ready\".\n", "Q: Is a \"Not Charging\" iPad still drawing power when not sleeping When an iPad is \"not charging\" and is not sleeping, is it still drawing power from the USB port so it doesn't drain or at least drain slower?\n\nA: Yes.  It's just that the power it's drawing is not enough to both run the device and charge the battery at the same time.\n", "Q: Download iOS without connecting iPad Is it possible to download the latest version of iOS without connecting my iPad?\nI have ordered the iPad, but it has still not come. So can I download and keep the iOS update in the meantime? Because I think that the iPad would not come with it installed.\n\nA: It is possible to download these individually. Many blogs provide links when new updates come out to the direct downloads. For example, heres a page that has links to IPSW's for 4.3.2.\nIt will come preloaded with the OS, you don't have to worry about that. Though, depending on delays and when you get it (And when it was packaged), you may have a minor update to do (ie, updating from 4.3.1 to 4.3.2). \nWhile you can download these updates, its really not worth it - or there is no real reason to do so beforehand. And it adds an extra step to apply it. When you get your device, it will ask you if you want to update it (you have to option-click 'Update' in iTunes). This is a common way to apply beta iOS builds for developers. \nSo, to answer your question - yes, it is 'possible', but really not worth it whatsoever. And your final guess is incorrect - it will come preloaded with an OS. The only thing you have to do to start using it once you get it is plug into iTunes to activate it, then can either start using it, or apply applications, etc.\n\nA: In general, no.  IOS is downloaded by iTunes based on the connected device ir finds. While you can apply a firmware version directly, it would be the same version iTunes would download for you.\nBut really, why bother.  Your iPad will come with IOS installed, and if it's not the most recent version, iTunes will ask if you want to update it.\n\nA: iOS 5 now supports over the air updates, and no longer requires a computer to update iOS itself. \nIf you have an earlier iOS version, you'll still need a computer to install iOS 5.x, but once it's installed you can perform wireless updates by going to the Settings app, choosing General, and choosing Software Update.  It will then report if there's a newer update than what you're running and give you the option to download and install it. All new iOS device (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch) now come with iOS 5.x or later loaded, and so you will only need to do this with devices purchased prior to 2012.  Many late fall 2011 devices also came with iOS 5 pre-loaded.\nIt is highly recommended to plug in the device while doing an update as it requires a little more power than the average app, and if your device is low on charge it might not complete successfully, requiring you to attach a computer with itunes to perform the update.\n", "Q: Syncing Address book to Google Apps doesn't sync groups When I sync my address book on my mac to Google Apps (gmail) it doesn't sync groups. Is this normal?\n\nA: This isn't a supported feature of the address book/google sync.\nThis support article from Google (point 4) states that \n\n\"Currently, groups are not synced to\n  Gmail. We're hoping to add this\n  functionality in the future.\"\n\n", "Q: any way to remap keys for only one app? I've seen the system wide tools (that all seem to just manipulate the default key bindings) that allow you to swap keys around, but has anyone found a way to swap keys for just one application? (no, the app in question doesn't offer it, and the author was a bit of a prick about it when I asked if they could enable an option to adjust them.)\nI'm talking about real keys like home, end, page up, page down... not shortcuts.\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro might be your thing. Make a new command group which only applies to the application in question, then for each key you want to remap, make a new command with a hotkey trigger set to the real key and an \"Insert Text\" action set to what you want the key to be.\nThe only shortcoming I've found so far is that it can't handle the in-built volume control keys on an Apple keyboard. It can detect them & act upon the event, but it can't suppress the volume change. In fairness, nothing else can either. Most programs I tried can't even detect it. Keyboard Maestro is the king of the pile.\n\nA: I've been using BetterTouchTool for years and am constantly amazed at its flexibility. Despite its name, it is capable of intercepting/altering keyboard events as well, plus allows you to limit key mappings to particular applications.\n\nA: You can use Ukelele to make your own keyboard layout, and switch to it when you open the application.\n\nA: If it's a menu item, you can create a custom shortcut in System Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts>Application Shortcuts. It lets you (re)assign any menu commands to whatever keyboard shortcut you want, for a specific app only.\n", "Q: SMC issues on a MacBook Pro Thunderbolt I've bought few months ago a MacBook Pro Thunderbolt 13'. As a Linux geek, I'm really happy with this computer, and it usually works fine.\nUnfortunately, three days ago, I wasn't able to restart it. It stucked without booting when I pressed the power button. I look on Apple website, and there was a procedure that describes how to reset the SMC, and I did that. \nMy computer restarted (yeah), but unfortunately, I had problems with the display backlight (cf pic). So I stop the computer, and did the SMC reset thing one more time. I experienced problem to restart , but for the moment all the backlights issues seem to be solved.\n\nI'm now a little bit afraid about the reliability of this computer, and I have lots of question about this SMC I can't answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does that thing need to be reset? What is it exactly? As a geek, I like to know how my computer works :)\n\n*Can we reset it often without problems, or is there a limit on the number of time you can do it without harming the computer? I read differents advises ont he web saying 'go, on do it every week' or 'do it in last resort'.\n\n*If the restart problem still occurs, should I send the computer to the customer service for a global checkup?\n\n\nThank you for your help :)\nRomain\n\nA: normally the SMC (system management controller) should not have to be reset at all. However it is sometimes necessary when troubleshooting so when people say \"last resort\" that, they are simply saying is an uncommon problem. The SMC controls things like the fan in your mac and power flow (the reason macs are so much quieter than most computers). If this is not working properly and needs to be reset is is probably because of a hardware issue. Reseting it also does not hurt your computer. It simply turns the controller off and then turns it back on without affecting your hard drive, memory, etc. Finally if the problem does continuously reoccur you should go into customer service because it is probably a hardware problem and it is best to let them look at it.\n\nA: probably is a screen problem with some of led string backlight that doesn't work \n", "Q: Issues with document syncing between iOS and host computer I had an app in my iphone which i recorded a meeting, (TSA) it said it was ready to sync to document folder. so I syncd and they all disappeared.\nWhere is the document folder located?\nWhen itunes deletes from iphone is there any way to find those and restore?\nWhy did itunes delete apps that were installed?\n\nA: Did you sync with a computer that you don't usually use? If you lost the app, you lost it's Documents directory, and your recording is gone.\nHere's what is supposed to happen;\nYou're supposed to open iTunes and browse to your device. In the list of apps with the iOS Home Screen style view, there is a section at the bottom to select an Application, and manage it's Documents storage folder.\nYou do not need to sync in order to view up-to-date information in this screen. You are immediately able to save the data out of the app into a location on your computer.\nUnfortunately, if you've sync'ed your phone and lost the app you've also lost the data from within it. There is little likelihood for data recovery on a Flash Disk device.\n", "Q: Tweetdeck replacement for Mac Is there a Tweetdeck replacement for mac? A program that'll allow me to post to both my Twitter account and Facebook accounts with a single action?\n\nA: Try HootSuite. If you want it to become a desktop app, use this.\nOtherwise, you can use the official Twitter client and configure the Twitter Facebook App to post your twitter updates on facebook.\nYou can also use Google Chrome and Mozilla's Prism (as a extension in the browser or as a standalone) to do the same thing.\n\nA: I'd probably check out Socialite ($20).\n\nA: The latest Twitter API terms of service  specifically prohibit clients posting to multiple social networks with a single click\n\n5E: You may not use Twitter Content or other data collected from end users of your Client to create or maintain a separate status update or social network database or service.\n\nSo, even if clients like Hootsuite allow it now, I would expect them to not be able to do that in the future.\n\nA: Babble\n", "Q: How to connect my iphone to PC and edit my contacts and other things like I can do with my Nokia phone? How to connect my iPhone to PC and edit my contacts and other things like I can do with my Nokia phone?\n\nA: You can in iTunes define which online Service or PC program you want to use.\nIn the iPhone User Guide on page 55, are the below written.\n\nInfo Pane\nThe Info pane lets you\n  configure the sync settings for your\n  contacts, calendars, email accounts,\n  and web browser. \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Contacts\nSync contacts with applications such as Mac\n  OS X Address Book, Yahoo!

But not always. \nUsing CMD+Ctrl+D (my own binding) to delete a layer works... sometimes. But not always.\nI'm unable to grasp why it only works sometimes. I noticed switching tools sometimes makes it work but that doesn't always help. \nAnyone experience anything similar?\nI'm using Mac OS X Snow Leopard, Photoshop CS5 12.0.2 (English), a few custom shortcut binding but not many.\n\nA: One of my peeves about InDesign is that the document navigation shortcut keys (e.g. alt+spacebar) are tool/context dependent instead of globally available. Perhaps you are experiencing the same issue here. Also, some Photoshop activity requires you to commit or cancel the change (such as using the transform gadgets). While in this state, certain actions are not possible.\n\nA: on a windows machine you can toggle between language settings with SHIFT + ALT.\nI think on a mac it is either the same or CMD + SHIFT\nTry that and see if you shortcuts work again.\nI think this is the solution.\nIf this shortcut is incorrect i think you can find it here: System Preferences > International > Input Menu > Input menu shortcuts\n", "Q: Factory unlock iPhone 4 I'm in India.\nI bought an iPhone 4 some time back. The vendor informed me that it is a factory unlocked version (iPhone 4 is officially not launched in India yet).\nSo, my questions are\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to find out whether it is a genuinely factory unlocked version?\n\n*If it's indeed a factory unlocked version, will I be able to update to the latest iOS version without getting it locked?\n\n*Since it is either a Canada/UK version, will updating the iOS in India create any problem (auto IP detection, time zone blah blah)?\n\n\nI tried installing an .ipa file directly and it didnt work. What I'm guessing through that is that my iPhone is not a jailbroken one. I read somewhere that to unlock an iPhone, one needs to jailbreak it first. That concludes, it is indeed a factory unlock version since any GSM SIM works.\nDo you think my logic is correct?\n\nA: Your logic is not correct. For a while, there were people offering unlocking services for around US$170 who are believed to have bribed an employee of Apple or a mobile phone operator to unlock phones using the official channels, and those phones also didn't need to be jailbroken. There's no way I know of to distinguish one of those phones from a factory unlocked one.\nAssuming it is a genuine factory unlock, there should be no problems -- I have a UK factory unlocked iPhone 4 and have upgraded the OS several times, though I've never tried to do so in another country.\n\nA: \nIs there a way to find out whether it\n  is a genuinely factory unlocked\n  version?\n\nYes. Remove the SIM. Insert a SIM from a different network. If the phone works, it is unlocked.\nTo be sure that it's factory unlocked, you can restore to factory settings and repeat the above test.\n\nIf it's indeed a factory unlocked\n  version, will I be able to update to\n  the latest iOS version without getting\n  it locked?\n\nYes.\n\nSince it is either a Canada/UK\n  version, will updating the iOS in\n  India create any problem (auto IP\n  detection, time zone blah blah)?\n\nNo.\n\nI read somewhere that to unlock an\n  iPhone, one needs to jailbreak it\n  first.\n\nThis is basically true. But factory unlocked phones don't need to be unlocked, so they don't need to be jailbroken.\n\nA: Jailbroken iPhonea get relocked when you update the software, but factory unlocked iPhones remain unlocked if you update the software.\n\nA: You can simply use online unlock services to unlock your device. They are cheap & permanent and your warranty will still remain valid.\n", "Q: Restore OS after Harddrive upgrade I planning to upgrade my 2010 MBP's Hadrdrive from 160GB to 500GB, I have alrerady lot of data on the existing disk, including Bootcamp partition.\nCould anyone suggest how to do I go ahead with restoring the data? I don't want to recreate/reinstall bootcamp after upgrade. \n\nA: It looks like Carbon Copy Cloner cannot backup non-hfs+ volumes for you, which would be the main piece of software I would recommend for this. However, with the addition of Winclone, it seems you can do it without too much extra work.\nI would first get an enclosure so I can work with both drives at the same time, but you don't actually have to, you just might need another Mac to be the middle man.\nYou will have to recreate the bootcamp partition on the new machine using the bootcamp assistant, but Winclone will automatically shove your Windows data back onto the volume, even if the sizes are different (of course, destination needs to be larger or same size as your previous boot camp partition).\nSo for the easy part:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download CCC\n\n*Launch Carbon Copy Cloner\n\n*Choose the volume that you want to clone from the Source Disk menu\n\n*Choose a properly-formatted volume from the Target Disk menu\n\n*Set the Cloning method to \"Backup everything\"\n\n*Click the Clone button\n\n\nThis will put your Mac system on the new drive. Only use this method when it is staying in the same type of machine however, otherwise there can be issues. \nThen, use Winclone to backup your Windows partition, and save it on the drive. The instructions below are lengthy so I didn't paste them that much, but overall its check 3 buttons, it will unmount the partition and save it as a file.\nNext, switch the drive configuration, and boot into your normal system verifying all but the Windows partition is working. You then would need to run bootcamp, create a Windows partition, and follow the Winclone instructions to restore it from the file you created on your old disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.macworld.com/article/131253/2007/12/winclone.html\n\n*https://gigaom.com/2010/01/12/how-to-image-os-x-and-boot-camp-to-a-new-mac/\n", "Q: Outlook 2011, Where are the mails stored?

I found an article about running both OSes, and using the SL user account for both SL and Lion.\nShould I trust it? Is it safe?\n\nA: Unfortunately, at the moment Lion is still in pre-release phase, so I would not deem it to be safe nor trustworthy (until its officially released).   Even Apple's own guidelines for installing pre-release operating systems to testers/developers say to install it on a non-critical hard drive in case there are problems.\nIf you want to test it out, I would install it on a completely separate hard drive.  And without any critical data.\n", "Q: What are the high level steps and limitations for unlocking & jailbreaking an original iPhone My daughter has an original iPhone, aka iPhone 2G.  It is currently unlocked and jailbroken, but that was all done about 2 years ago.  She wants the latest iTunes now, so I am revisiting what the procedure and limitations are for updating, unlocking, and jailbreaking.\nI think the right high level steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup everything we want to keep. I\nam pretty sure the phone gets wiped\nduring the process. \n\n*Download iTunes\ncurrent release and install it and\nlet it do whatever it wants to\nupdate the phone. \n\n*Follow the\ninstructions in the iClarified guide\n\"How to Unlock/Jailbreak Your iPhone\n2G on OS 3.1.3 Using RedSn0w\n(Windows)\" at\nhttp://iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=7436\nwhich calls for RedSn0w 0.9.4, BL\n3.9, BL 4.6, and iPhone1,1_3.1.3_7E18_Restore.ipsw\n\n*Re-install apps via iTunes.

It's pretty straightforward following the points you listed above.\n", "Q: CTRL+4 and CTRL+5 not working in OSX Recently, I've noticed that my MacBook Pro 5,1 (mid 2009) running Snow Leopard 10.6.6 doesn't respond when I press CTRL+3 or CTRL+4.\nWhen, for instance, I'm in an application that has no bindings for the CTRL-keys and I press CTRL+2, I will hear the OS X alert sound, because the application receives a key combination it doesn't understand. This is the case for all CTRL+n combinations, except 3 and 4.\nNo matter where I try it — even in places where pressing the aforementioned key combination would have an actual effect — nothing happens.\nBut it doesn't just seem to ignore the keypresses; it numbs the keyboard. If I, for instance, hold CTRL and press 5 and 6, I will hear two alerts. One for each unknown key combination. If I then do the same, but with the numbers 4 and 5 (which usually are responsive), there's no sound. In fact, no matter what key I press when CTRL is being held down after having pressed 3 or 4, nothing happens.\nAt first I figured I probably added some shortcut to the key combinations by accident, but I can't find it anywhere. In System Preferences → Keyboard,  I've restored everything to default, but that didn't seem to change anything.\nI've tried with both the onboard keyboard, a wireless Apple bluetooth keyboard and a cabled USB Apple keyboard.\n\nA: I think this is a bug in Mac OS X and has something to do with the way the keyboard shortcuts for Spaces are processed. Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Spaces is turned on in the System Preferences with the standard 4 spaces layout, and standard key combination for switching to a space.\n\n*Open a folder in the Finder.\n\n*Press and hold CTRL, and press any of the number keys. If you press 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 0 first you will get a beep. Same if you press one of those keys again (still holding CTRL). If you then press 1, 2, 3 or 4, you will switch to that space number; or just stay in that space if you were already in it. If you then press any of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 0 again, it won't beep anymore.\n\n\nIf you simply turn off Spaces, the above won't happen and whatever order you press the keys in, they will continue to beep. If you change the number of spaces to only two, then 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 0 will give you a beep until you've pressed either 1 or 2. I don't know of an application in which those keys have a non-Spaces functionality and would do something useful other than beep, so I haven't been able to try what happens in such an application. In any case, I don't think you need to worry there's something wrong with your keyboard or the way you've configured the keyboard bindings; it seems to be a bug in Mac OS X.\nEdit: Try the above in a new folder in which you've created folders named \"1\", \"2\" and so on. I find the Finder's behavior in this case somewhat strange: if you press CTRL-8, it will beep yet also switch the selection to the folder named \"8\". But again, pressing 5 through 9 will neither beep, nor change the selected folder once you've pressed any of 1 through 4.\n\nA: I realize this is an old question but I had the same issue of unresponsive Ctrl+3 and Ctrl+4 keystrokes using OS X 10.8.4 and found a solution that worked for me using information from this answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist (I used XCode).\n\n*Update keys 120 and 121, which represent the Ctrl+3 and Ctrl+4 keystrokes respectively, switching enabled to NO for both.\n\n*Restart your computer.\n\n\nHopefully this helps someone else out there.  \n\nA: I use Ctrl+1 and Ctrl+2, instead of Ctrl+arrows to move to previous and next space, it saves me from letting go of the mouse.\nIn Terminal:\nopen ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n\n(Xcode should pop up)\nUpdate keys 118 and 119, which represent the Ctrl+1 and Ctrl+2 keystrokes respectively, switching enabled to YES for both.\nThen run:\nkillall Dock\n\nCtrl+1 and Ctrl+2 should come back.\nThis works with El Capitan.\n\nA: I came across this question while trying to understand why \"Ctrl-3\" didn't work to switch to the new desktop (third one) I had just created. I tried messing with ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist as suggested in other answers but it didn't help. The solution for my problem was much more trivial: it had to be enabled in the Mission Control keyboard shortcuts (from System Preferences).

I am a huge fan of HandBrake. It is the epitome of simple. Select a video file (or DVD), select a preset, select an output path, click Start. A certain amount of time later relative to the size/quality of the content, and you have yourself a pretty much perfect video file suitable for the medium of your choice.\nI've been looking for similar qualities in an Audio Converter, and more preferably, an Audio Extractor (from a given video file). I would love to be able to drag a video file into an application, specify that I want the Audio File in AAC at a given bitrate, click Start, and let the app do the rest.\nI am not averse to using Handbrake to suffice the conversion aspect of this, so long as the audio extraction after the fact is a simple process. The point is to take as few steps as possible.\nAny tips? Apps? Ideas?\n\nA: I would drag the movie into GarageBand.  GarageBand will split the file into audio and video, at which time you can delete the video track (leaving you with just the audio track).\nYou can then click the Send Song To iTunes option in the Share menu (see pic).  This will then come up with the various formats you want to export to.\n\nBest of all, this is free :)  as all Macs come with GarageBand.  Plus it also allows you to adjust aspects of the audio such as speed and volume.\nHaving said that, if you want a truly automatic solution, and are comfortable in the command line with Terminal, let me know in the comments and I'll come up with a script to allow you to do this.\n\nA: Quicktime 7 will do the work really easily.\nJust open the video, and go to File > Export > Sound to AIFF/AU/Wave > select your path and you're done! :)\n\nA: QuickTime Player 10 is able to export audio (without re-encoding), too.\nSelect File > Export > Audio Only…\nTested on macOS 10.12 Sierra with QuickTime Player 10.4.\n\nA: I finally found the exact combination I needed, and I found it in ffmpeg.\nI will expand on the question a bit and spell out the fact that I was already working with mp4 contained video/audio, so MP4 Video (.m4v) and AAC Audio (.m4a). I absolutely wanted an as-is version of the audio extracted from the video.\nFirst off, it's pretty easy to install things like ffmpeg, mplayer, things built off them, and similar open source packages nowadays. Between Rudix, Homebrew, MacPorts, and Fink (does anyone even use fink anymore?), third party software is a snap to install.\nSo, after installing ffmpeg, and having the ffmpeg accessible at the command line, I ran a command like this:\nffmpeg -i videofile.mp4 -vn -acodec copy audiotrack.m4a\n\nffmpeg: The command.\n-i videofile.mp4: The source video file.\n-vn: Do not record (do not consider) video data.\n-acodec copy: Copy the audio source as-is, here's where all the magic is. ffmpeg will write the audio data out as various supported codecs, but specifying copy leads a bit-for-bit exact copy of the stream. Coupled with disabling video via -vn leaves you with a lone audio track inside an mp4 container.\naudiotrack.m4a: The output filename.\nI can't believe something like this was so difficult and hidden for so long.\nSince I always intend to rip aac audio data out of an mp4 container/video, I wrote a quick little script to do it.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nINFILE=\"$1\"\nTMPOUTFILE=\"${INFILE%.*}\"\nOUTFILE=\"${TMPOUTFILE##*/}.m4a\"\n\nffmpeg -i \"${INFILE}\" -vn -acodec copy \"${OUTFILE}\"\n\nNow, I simply invoke rip_m4a_from_mp4 somevideofile.mp4 and I am left with an audio only version with the same filename, ending in m4a instead.\nSimple! For me anyways. No GUIs, lightning fast, this is just one of those things that the command line does better.\n\nA: You can do this directly in the Finder, starting with Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), as described at OSX Daily.\nThe short answer is, select the file or files in the Finder, then ctrl-click and choose Services -> Encode Selected Video Files. \nNote that you may need to enable this service in the Keyboard preference pane.\n\n\nA: The avconvert command powers the Services > Encode Selected Video Files option.\nYou can use it like so:\navconvert --quiet --preset PresetAppleM4A --source foo.mp4 --output bar.m4a\n\n\nA: I simply open the video file with audacity and then export the audio.\nI can set the exported audio file parameters during the export.\n", "Q: How to make screen zoom little bit less terrible? You know how you zoom-in whole screen with your magic-trackpad + ctrl + 2fingers in snow leopard?\nThe result is not-so-nice-looking screen. You can see pixels and basically the resolution is crapy... how do I fix that?\n\nA: There is no way of fixing that.  It is magnifying the screen, not a true resolution independent zoom, so as things magnify they will appear blocky.\n\nA: I don't think it is terrible!\nI occasionally do some graphic and web design work, and I do a lot of photography, and when I care about pixels the ease with which I can zoom in and see clearly what's going on down there is great.\nAlso, as a bit of a typography nerd, I like to have a look at the sub-pixel antialiasing that's going on :B\n\nA: You can make display little smooth in Pref panes > Universal Access > Seeing tab > Zoom options… > Check Smooth images (or type ⌥⌘\\) but RobZolkos right.\n\nA: As noted in the previous answers, the operating system doesn't re-render the information at a finer level of detail - it's like holding a magnifying glass on a printed page just shows larger detail instead of making the printing finer.\nThe only way to \"fix\" the zoom is to make the Mac draw things larger and let you scroll around to see a window of the larger information.\nWhat you want is called an Oversized Desktop. Basically you trick the system into sending data to the graphics card to render a 2000x1024 sized desktop. Then your mouse or other commands control and a viewport of 1440x900 with some of the data drawn offscreen.\nI don't know of a single program that works with 10.5 or later - but at least you know what to look for and this might spark someone else with a recommendation.\n", "Q: Any way to extract notes from iPod Touch backup? Is there any way for me to extract notes from an iPod Touch backup? I had forgotten to back up the notes on my old iPod Touch and subsequently lost all my notes on it. It's been a year and a half now, and the older computer with the backup has Snow Leopard clean-installed on it.\nIf I restore the older installation of Leopard with Time Machine, would it be possible for me to extract the notes from the iPod Touch backup? (1st gen, iPod Touch software 2.0)\n\nA: Restore your old backup folder from Time Machine somewhere on your hard drive.  Then using iPhone Backup Extractor, extract the notes.   Your iPod isn't used in this process.\nhttp://www.iphonebackupextractor.com/\nThis is probably the easiest way without resorting to wiping your iPod.  \n\nA: The obvoius way it to have a device that you restore the old backup (including the notes) overwriting whatever is currently on the device.\nYou can then see, edit, mail or sync the notes as appropriate.\nThe format of the backup files has changed pretty substantially for each major version and there are tools that read the files directly but I can't recommend and would welcome comments or an edit/separate answer to address specifically a tool to get at 2.0 version backup files.\nIt is possible to decode the files without restoring them but iTunes will take care of interpreting all versions of a backup file to upgrade it to whatever newer version you have on your device so unless you can't spare a device to rescue the notes, it's often not worth the time to dig up a special tool just to get the notes.\n\nA: This is the best tool out there for extracting everything (not just notes) from your iPhone\nhttp://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/\n", "Q: What does \"CMD + <\" do in AZERTY keyboard?

I've also tried to use the shortcut in many different applications, but most of the time it does absolutely nothing, with an occasional error beep.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: the shortcut is meant to go to settings of what ever program is running in the foreground (it will be the program in the upper left corner of your screen).

He wants me to put his phone on Straight Talk, but to do so I need to open a mobileconfig file which is usually emailed, or edit the APN with a tethering app through Cydia. I have installed the apps into Cydia through Cyder II, but Cydia still cannot load them without internet. Help me please, I've been hunting for and trying work-arounds for hours.\n\nA: I have heard many times of wifi greyed out, and generally it was right after updating their iOS with a new version. No amount of DFU seemed to fix it, and I think it is because the issue was with the firmware killing the iPhone's wifi.\nI am fairly certain Apple repairs these types of problems, you might even call them and see if they will replace it as their update possibly caused it. \nFor the second piece, If you are trying to get a network connection without wifi, prepare for some fun.

The new version (Papers 2) was released a few weeks ago, and while not completely rock stable, I really can't live without it !\nIt has pretty much all the features you asked. You can manage books (and ebooks), each entry in the \"database\" is linked to one or more files (.pdf most of the time).\nIn addition in Papers 2 the citation process has been completely updated, you should have a look at their website about that.\nThere also a version for iOS and synchronization between your devices is apparently very easy.\n\nA: The combination of Scrivener and BibDesk made me switch from Linux to the Mac some years ago.\n-- Your ebooks can be managed through it, even auto-filed with a name generated from the info you enter\n-- I get book information from the research libraries I use, using their Z39.50 interface (only a handful of libraries do not use that), but other sources like Google Scholar also work. It can share data files with Zotero, so you can also integrate Amazon data and much more.\n-- Bibliography listing: Works great once you figured it out. There is a learning curve, but it got better recently.\n-- manage cites, integration with Scrivener: is why I use it.\n-- sharing with iPad: would mean to share the book with iTunes. Tricky, as iTunes is very, very jealous for an application. Best option is to drag the file alias from BibDesk to the \"Automatically add to iTunes\" folder (I myself have a shortcut for that one in the Finder sidebar anyway); not a \"Press this button\" solution within the app, but your request is not what BibDesk is about.\n", "Q: Is there a utility that allows to open a terminal window with a shortcut? I often use the Terminal application, especially to commit code to a Git repository, and I don't want to have the window always open. Is there a utility that allows to open a terminal window using a shortcut?\n\nA: Check out iTerm2 (see also the Google project page). You can bind a key combination as a way to show/hide the terminal. In a way, you achieve the same thing as the before mentioned Visor; yet, iTerm2 offers more functionality than Terminal.app. \nCombine this with alfred/quicksilver and iTerm2 profiles for more hotkey awesomeness.\n\nA: DTerm may be exactly what you are after: it's like a file location aware terminal that pops in and out of view. So you can activate it while you've got a file selected in terminal (or XCode, or whatever) and take an action on the file (like commit a change) and then it gets out your way.\nIt's free and also available on the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Visor does that: http://visor.binaryage.com/\nIn case you just want a command line, use: http://decimus.net/DTerm/\n\nA: Use Quicksilver! You can setup hot-keys for launching apps. Plus it does a bunch of other neat things :)\n\nA: Alfred is a wonderful Quicksilver-like app that can do this, providing that you purchase the PowerPack.  I use this quite frequently; I just bring up the window and type > cd ~/Developer and then hit return.\n\nA: I like apptivate, it ain't free.. but it's superfast (unlike visor eg)!\nIt works for any app, plus you get a peek option, alowing you to peek into the shortcutted app.\n\nA: I just press Apple and space to bring up spotlight\nFollowed by typing 'te' which finds terminal and then hit return. \n", "Q: Settings to use in Garageband for creating sounds for an iPhone application? I'm trying to create sounds to be used with a mobile app for iPhone. Is there a default setting in Garageband? Or is there another best practices way to get this accomplished? The sounds are spoken word.\nI've tried different effects and settings (and no effects), but there is either a lot of background noise, or it is much too loud in the ad hoc version.\n\nA: If you use the internal mic of your mac or your iPhone you can not expect a good quality. You must use a real microphone like the one from Apogee.\n\nA: If you mean using garageband for creating ringtones, it's pretty straight forward and require no special settings. From lifehacker:\n\nUnfortunately Apple hasn't provided a similar tool for Windows users yet, and I imagine that won't happen for some time, if at all. But if you're a Mac owner, creating custom ringtones for your iPhone just became dead simple.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to redefine the keyboard shortcut for deleting files to [delete] loosing the [command]? Is it possible to redefine the keyboard shortcut for deleting files to delete loosing the command ?\nHow?\n\nA: Normally it is possible to customize your own keyboard shortcuts in the Keyboard pref pane, but you cannot re-map the Delete key.\nSo in short, no, it is not possible to re-map Cmd ⌘+Delete to simply the Delete key.\nEDIT:\nThis would be a \"hack\", but it just occurred to me that if you have a programmable mouse with an extra button, you may be able to assign the Cmd ⌘+Delete key combo to that button.  It won't work using the built-in Mouse pref pane, but there may be a third-party app that can do it -- e.g. USB Overdrive or Logitech Control Center (for Logitech mice, obviously).\n", "Q: iPhone restarts whenever a call is made I updated my iPhone yesterday and now whenever I take or make a call my phone restarts itself.\nIt was updated via iTunes on my computer. Each phone call can last between 1 - 10 minutes.\nI've never had this problem before.\n\nA: Sounds like either a bug or the update didn't work properly.  \nThat said, you should re-apply the update using these instructions from Apple support.\n", "Q: Why does my MBP not fully wake? I tried asking on apple forums, and they said do a SMC reset. Tried it, and it doesn't work. It always happens. Here's a video of what I am talking about, watch through the full video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25cWVrg8Bfw&feature\n\nA: This is hard to answer outright but I don’t have the privilege of creating a comment thread and asking some questions first, so I’ll just offer some possible scenarios. \n\n\n*\n\n*It is just slow. This can happen if you are low on RAM. It is difficult to be patient for this though because all you have is a blank screen, and it is very frustrating.\n\n*If it is like my Macbook, and you have a password set to auto-lock or auto-lock your display after 5 minutes, and it still does not appear like it is going to wake up, then go ahead and type your password in anyway without the dialog. This will usually unlock the display and bring it out of sleep mode in one fell swoop as it finally wakes up and registers the keystrokes.\nIf you don’t have a password set to lock or auto-lock your screen though, I am not sure what to suggest. I have used harmless keys like the arrow keys in the past, just pressing them and alternating between left and right until it comes out of sleep mode to force my computer to wake up, but this has extremely mixed results. There have been a larger number of successes tallied doing this, but not by very much, especially if I was low on RAM before.\nAs to why it is like this, the possibilities range from being low on RAM or just having a slow disk, to a bug in the operating system or more aggravating, a bug in the firmware. If you can duplicate it regularly, you can try taking it into the Genius Bar and see if they can work out what the problem is there, it might even be a known issue that has already been documented and solved for some on a case by case basis, or a software update may be in the works.\n\nA: This isn't a real solution, but I upgraded to Lion. I posted a similar question in the Apple forums, but there weren't any solutions suggested there either.\n\nA: Mine does this everyone now and then... Have you tried shutting the lid, waiting for the sleep indicator to pulse 3 times, then open the lid again.\nAlso, do you have an external monitor plugged in? Try unplugging it and plugging it back in again...\n", "Q: Will my warranty be valid in other countries if I buy an iPad in Korea? I will be in Korea for 5 months, I'm about to buy an iPad 2 there and I'll be back in London or France in September. I would like to know if my warranty will be valid in England or in France in case something happens because there are no Apple Stores in Korea, but only retailers.\n\nA: Yes. But with a cost.\nFrom Apple's iPad warranty docs:\n\nIf you seek service in a country that is not the country of original purchase, \n  you will comply with all applicable import and export laws and regulations and be responsible for\n  all custom duties, V.A.T. and other associated taxes and charges. Where international service is \n  available, Apple may repair or exchange defective products and parts with comparable products \n  and parts that comply with local standards. In accordance with applicable law, Apple may require \n  that you furnish proof of purchase details and/or comply with registration requirements before \n  receiving warranty service. Resources with more details on this and other matters on obtaining \n  warranty service are described below. \n\n\nA: UPDATE: Even in 2017, the situation is still the same and has not changed. This screen capture is from the Apple website dated 2017-08-04:\n\n\nAfter leaving a comment on @anthonyg's answer, I realised this question is 2 years old. Exactly two years ago, I was living in Thailand but before moving there I purchased two iphones (one each for my wife and me). \nThe long of it appears in anthonyg's question, the short of it was that both developed warranty issues and whilst my MacBook Pro was in getting something fixed under warranty, they (the authorised apple reseller/repairer) refused to take our phones because they were purchased in Australia. I called apple whilst I was standing in the store and they backed the repairer. They would not honour the warranty for the iPhones in Thailand even though the phones were well within the warranty period. \n\nA: From my experience, this will be fine. Apple doesn't seem to be fussy about warranty cards and the like, they just take the device, look at the serial number, and that tells when it was bought. I've had no problems with getting devices bought in the US serviced in Thailand, as long as it's within the warranty period. This has never involved any extra cost. \nUnlike some companies, Apple seems to accept the reality that these days, people are very mobile, moving from one country to another. This is different to, for example, cameras, where warranties can be quite restrictive. \n", "Q: Macbook Shutdown Problem My Macbook doesn't shut down ! It gets stuck on a blue screen with a loading image and doesn't shut down. I recently have updated my Macbook but I don't know if it is the problem or not.\n\nA: Are you able to boot into Safe Boot? You can find the instructions for that here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1455\nAlso, I would note the time you are shutting the computer down and then check Console and see what is logged at the time, perhaps that would give us some hints as to what is preventing your computer from shutting down. \n", "Q: How to make a simple app from an applescript! I've got an applescript that I use to open files such as test.txt in vim, using the terminal.\nI usually open a file by right-clicking it an selecting the service open in vim (this service is created by me and basically runs the applescript).\nHow do I build an actual program, that can be set in the \"open with\" option for a file?\nThis way, when I double click test.txt, the applescript gets run and the file gets opened in my vim in terminal.app.\nI would also like to create custom icons that will be applied to all files I open using this app (using the \"Change All...\" button).\nWhere would I begin?

Then go File>Save As and select Application as the file format. Then, to select the type of file you want it to be opened with, select the file, right click on it and select Get Info. Expand the Open With: tab and choose your applescript application and click on change all.\n\nA: Two obvious alternatives come to mind from not building the application in Applescript editor. \nThe first is to use Automator and the Run Applescript action. You may need to play around with the script to get the results you want with Automator but if you can it might open up some more option for your workflow as well. \nThe other option is to create a Cocoa-Applescipt application in Xcode (what used to be known as Applescript Studio). Using this option is not well documented, but you can find out more here:\nhttp://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/develop/index.html\nGiven what you saying about customisation this is definitely something you should look at. It is sometimes a bit of a hard learning curve because of the lack of documentation, but it is surprising how good an application can be when written in Applescript using this method. \n\nA: I explained how to do this with arbitrary shell scripts in this similar topic on SuperUser.\n", "Q: E-Mail with attachments (<2,8 MB) has a size of >3,5 MB in Entourage. Why? I just added two files as an attachment to an e-mail in MS Entourage 2004.\nIn Finder, the files have a size of 2,5 MB respectively 205 kB.\nWhen I send them as an e-mail, Entourage tells me that the sent mail has a size of 3,5 MB!\n\n\n*\n\n*Why? Does this have to do with AppleDouble encoding?\n\n*Is there a way to avoid that increase in size?\n\n\nA: This isn't an Apple or Entourage issue, this is normal behaviour that happens when attachments are encoded to be sent with emails -- encoding the data to the email format makes the attachments roughly one-third heavier. \nThis has nothing to do with the Apple filesystem. \nThere is no way to stop this happening. If file size is a problem, consider uploading to an FTP server, or using a system like Box.net, YouSendIt, or DropBox to share the files -- these methods don't require encoding and will not increase the size. \n\nA: To further expand Anthony's answer (which is correct), remember than when email was created, it was intended to send text (ASCII chars). When the idea of sending binary files became a reality, the e-mail infrastructure was already in place and working and it would have been too hard to change it to support sending binary data (plus it would have added complexity). \nIn order to solve the problem, the solution was to MIME encode the files (as correctly pointed by @mark in the comments).\nAs you can guess, this makes the size bigger, but allows the binary file to be represented in ASCII. Since ASCII has only 128 chars (and some are control chars!) because it was 7 bit, the 8 bit version, called Extended ASCII added another 128 chars to the mix (allowing accents and some other tricks), but that's just another story much better explained in Wikipedia and countless sites about it :)\nTo create a simple analogy, imagine you have to represent the entire alphabet using only vowels. You'd start creating combinations of the 5 letters you have to represent the missing ones, so for example the letter \"B\" would have to be represented as \"AA\" (just an example), then C would be \"AAA\", then D could be \"AE\", etc. \nAs you can see, I'm only using vowels, but I need more than 1 to represent consonants. This is more or less in simple terms what MIME does. It uses standard ASCII chars to represent a hell lot more, thus the increase in size. \nHope this helps you understand the process that goes on when Mail (or entourage) says: \"attaching…\". It's encoding the file :)\n", "Q: Is it possible to copy 'rich text' formatting on iPhone? If I copy text from Safari or another app, is it generally copied in rich text format, or plain text format? And if rich text, is there any way to paste it formatted, or see the HTML source of the copied text?\n\nA: Text is copied in rich form in iOS 3+.\nYou can try it by copying some text in Safari and pasting it to Mail.  \nBut pasted text format will depend of the app. For example, the SimpleNote app only paste in plain text format, since the service doesn't not support image and text styling.\nThere is no native way to see the copied text in HTML form. You'll have to find an app to do that.\n", "Q: dd to ISO from disc drive makes unmountable / unburnable image? I'm trying to dd from a disc in my DVD drive on my MacBook to an ISO, but the image always ends up as unmountable and unburnable. The disc is unmounted when I start the process.\nI've used dd many times before - in OSX and in various Linux distros - without any problems. Am I doing something wrong?\nThe syntax I'm using is dd if=/dev/disk1 of=~/Desktop/image.iso\n\nA: With CDs and DVDs on Mac OS X, the /dev/diskN entry seems to be the raw disc contents (i.e. it includes things like media error correction data).  For imaging, you want /dev/diskNs0 (or sometimes /dev/diskNs1 etc, especially on a multisession disc).  If the disc has a partition table, the mountable volumes will actually be e.g. /dev/diskNs1s2.\nBTW, you can also create iso-style images from the GUI with Disk Utility: select the session from Disk Utility's sidebar (note: the session will be the item directly under the disc drive in the sidebar; if the disc has a partition table, there volume will be listed separately under that, and it's not what you want), then go to the menu and select File > New > Image from .  Then, select CD/DVD Master for the image format.  It'l name the image with a .cdr extension, but the format is the same as a typical .iso image.\n\nA: In this case you can take one of two approached.\nUse ccd2iso to convert the dd iso. This will give you the results you are looking for.\nccd2iso is not built into Mac OS but it can be installed using homebrew.\nThe command would look like this:\nccd2iso inputfile.iso outputfile.iso\n\n\nAlternatively\nInsert your optical disc.\nAfter it has mounted enter the following in your terminal window:\ndiskutil info /dev/diskN | grep \"Block Size\"\n\nNote: The N in diskN represents the disk number assigned for the disk you inserted but what is important here is that you will get the block size of the CD/DVD for use in the next command.\nThe path of the optical disk drive being used can be found by typing drutil status into terminal.\nThe next command would be (you might not need sudo if you detached the disk using the DiskUtility GUI or otherwise):\nsudo dd if=/dev/diskNs0 of=my_disc.iso bs=2352\n\nNotice: The slice is included and this will yeild a disc image that mounts as you most likely experienced in the Linux platform.\nThe method described above was tested against a random disc and an md5 was calculated against the iso. That md5 was compared to the md5 calculated against the iso image of 3 other tools, Burn (GUI app), AnyToIso (free GUI app), and ddrescue using the the following command ddrescue -b 2352 -r4 -v /dev/diskNs0 ddrescue.iso log.txt and the all md5 results were precisely the same.\nReference: http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/audio-visual/documents/Preserve_DVDs_BloodReport_20140901.pdf see page 9 for more on dd\nThe reference does not suggest using the slice number (diskNs0) when the intended goal is an archival disc image. Without the slice number and block size specified I have found that an unmountable disc image results in Mac OS X but after converting the disc image using ccd2iso a mountable disc image does result and traversal of the directory is possible.\n", "Q: How can I set the screen refresh rate for a CRT VGA monitor in Leopard? I need to operate a CRT monitor in 100 Hz (1280 x 1024) on a Leopard Machine.\nThe same monitor was working fine on a Tiger machine in the mentioned range but I switched to Leopard and it does not show the 100 Hz option in the list any more (but I am sure the monitor can support it). \nIs there a way to manually modify the list?\n\nA: This handy utility SwitchResX can give you the option to adjust your monitor settings.\nThere is also this utility (which I haven't tried/tested)\n\nA: So far it seems that there is no way to do this.

Applications and other processes can keep your Mac awake if they are providing a service, such as file sharing or remote access.\nDo you have an active ssh session or terminal session running? This can also be responsible for keeping your iMac awake.\nBe aware that Apple does not officially support hibernation on desktop Macs. Your setting hibernatemode suggests you have this feature enabled.\nDisclaimer: I am involved with a commercial product called Power Manager, it can help make your Mac sleep more predictably.\n\nA: Sleep can be a tricky thing, Mac OS requires that there is no disc activity for a full minute after the time you set it to sleep. So somethings you may want to check is if the issue happens in Safe Boot, or if there is anything spewing into your log and finally if the issue persists in a new user account. \n", "Q: Putting in place PLC between time capsule and airport base station? Here is my configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Living Room\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro\n\n*NAS\n\n*Network printer\n\n*All connected to Time Capsule\n\n\n*Bedroom\n\n\n*\n\n*Hifi System (with line-in)\n\n*Laptop, iPod touch (any wireless device)\n\n\n\nAs of today, the connection between the two locations is too weak (see this question) for me to use devices wirelessly in the bedroom.\nWhat I would like to do is to add a PLC connection between the two rooms and place an airport base station in the bedroom to extend the wireless network.  \nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words, so check below my existing configuration and the things I want to add (green bullets and green arrows):\n\nI then have a lot of questions...  \n\n\n*\n\n*Will the wireless network created in the bedroom by the airport base station be an extension of the one in the living room or a new one? (first option would be easier to wander in the apartment without having to switch from one network to the other).\n\n*Will it still be possible to connect the other devices (printer, NAS) to the time capsule and would they be accessible from the bedroom (I suppose yes if wireless network is the same) and still from the living room wired network (I don't see why it would not be the case).\n\n*Do I have to connect the PCL as on the drawing or do I have to connect it between the modem and the time capsule? (edit: yes, replied to this one by myself)\n\n\nI also then plan to connect the Hifi system line in to the jack connection of the airport base station.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will it allow me to output on the hifi system songs from my iTunes library stored on MBP?\n\n*Will I be able to control it with Remote from the iPod Touch?\n\n\nYou can also propose other solutions which could work in my situation.\nMy first need was the network connection in the bedroom. The iTunes songs on the Hifi system was a bonus when I thought about Airport Base Station.  \n\nA: Yes, assuming the express (and the PLC link) is in bridge mode, you will have one network so AirPlay, AirPrint and Bonjour will work like you have one router and everyone is in range or plugged in to the ethernet.\nYou can use the same SSID on both wireless networks, but then you can't choose which network you are joining if you start on one and the connection is simply better. \nThe big downside of PLC or ethernet link is you don't get automatic switching of the base stations if a device starts on the main and doesn't leave the signal range. You can remedy this by reducing the transmit power on the main station to ensure that by the time you get to the bedroom, the existing link is lost and the device has to join the express.\nMaking two SSID networks allows you to know which base station you connect - not leaving it to the software to determine based on a short measurement of the two signal strengths when you \"join\" the network.\nWhether you have one SSID or two, I would recommend selecting different channels for both transmitters as far apart as practical or consider reducing the transmit power on one if you find bad interference in between the two wireless transmitters.\nUse the logs and statistics graphs in Airport Utility to see the transmit speeds and which base station your devices are connected when you choose where to place the devices and what channels to use.\n\nA: In order:\n\n\n*\n\n*It will be a different one, but I think if you give them the same SSID and WPA key and just put them on different channels things will hop relatively seamlessly. Configuring this might be \"fun\"; WDS might be a better alternative but I'm not sure how that works. \n\n*Yes, the Airport Express would just be another node on the same LAN, so it would have access to everything else on the LAN\n\n*Yes; as far as I know it will show up as an airplay device in iTunes once the Airport express is on the network. That's how the Apple TV works, at least. You would also be able to stream audio from the iPod touch to it as well.\n\n*You would control the MBP with the remote app; the MBP would be streaming its music to the base station. I believe you can also select AirPlay destinations from the remote app as well. \n\nA: *\n\n*If you provide the same SSID and key for the second wireless network, devices will in fact be able to switch between these two without user intervention. If you configure your Airport Express that it acts as a bridge you will even keep your existing IP-Address. The downside to this is that your devices are not aware of the fact that there are actually two identically named networks. This can lead to them 'sticking' to the currently connected network instead to the other network, even when the signal strength of the former is nearing zero.\n\n*If you configure your Airport Express in Bridge Mode you will be able to use all devices, services or whatever you also have connected to your \"main\" network, just as if you were directly connected.\n", "Q: How do I view an SSL certificate on my iPad from Safari? I'm trying to view the SSL certificate for a web site on my iPad.\nFor example, how can I view the SSL certificate for this site?\nhttps://encrypted.google.com/\nUsing Safari on the desktop, I can click on the small lock icon in the address bar to view the certificate details.\nHow do I do this on the iPad?\n\nA: I believe this feature does not yet exist in Mobile Safari -- probably because it's not in high demand, so it's not high on the development priority list.\nTry submitting a feature request through the official Safari feedback form (select \"iOS\" as your operating system so they know you're referring to Mobile Safari): http://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html\n\nA: There is an app \"SSL Detective\". Many professional IT colleagues use this tool:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://twocanoes.com/products/ios/ssl-detective/\nYou can download the SSL Detective app from the Apple app store.  It lets you connect to a URL on a port you specify and it will show you the certificates associated with that site (if any).  An in-app purchase will apparently show more details on the certificates (I didn't purchase the upgrade as the free version worked for my need).\n\nA: There is also a free app TLS Inspector. Works fine too.

The recent PR said that they do still collect some of this information for their anon database.\nDue to some changes in my wireless network (adding another base station), Find my iPhone isn't as accurate at my home anymore. It used to be very precise (could tell which side of the house a device was on), but now it shows the device across the street or in the trees. \nIs there a way to manually update or refresh this location information? You used to be able to go to skyhooks website to enter your location and MAC addresses, but since Apple doesn't use that anymore - thats not helpful. \n\nA: Apple has disclosed that when you opt in to share anonymous diagnostic information it will occasionally update their database with data seen on your iOS device. Simply connect each device to iTunes and use the \"reset all warnings\" command so you will have a chance to re-opt in or out to sending diagnostic location and crash reports to Apple.

I was running into issues playing Starcraft 2 on Windows 7 (32 bits): once in a while, the game would unexpectedly quit with \"Core: out of memory\" as the error message. I went to the Blizzard support forum with this problem, and they told me that my video and sound drivers are outdated by a year or two.\nNotwithstanding that I'm not sure how these drivers can impact the memory usage of the game, I don't know if upgrading is a good idea. I'm quite sure that it won't hurt the Mac OS side of my computer if I do (as the Blizzard rep suggested to double-check), but said drivers seem to come from Apple, and I'm not sure if my Mac would behave well if I upgraded them.\nHas anyone tried to upgrade the sound and video drivers for Windows 7?\n\nA: To answer your question - No, it won't hurt.  But it may not work.  As with any driver upgrade there is no guarantees.  But there is no harm in trying.  You can always revert back if it doesn't work.\nIf you find it doesn't work, hold F8 whilst booting into Windows to prompt you to boot into safe-mode.  When in safe mode you can revert your video driver.\nLet us know how it works out.

Goto the Options tab and change the Media Kind of the file from Music to Audio Book.  It will then appear in the right place.\n\n", "Q: Reset the PMU on macbook when the left shift key is dead I have a fairly new white Macbook, the kind with a built-in, non-user replaceable battery, model MacBook6,1.\nThe thing's Power Management Unit is clearly on the fritz-- the battery indicator says \"no batteries available\" (while clearly running off battery power), the magsafe adapter won't light up, and the fan is constantly running at full bore.  According to Apple, this calls for resetting the PMU as follows: \"On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.\"\nHere's the catch: The left side shift key, the control key, and the left side option key are all dead, due to an unfortunate beer spill some months ago.  The other shift key works, but the directions clearly call for holding down the LEFT HAND Shift-Control-Option keys, all of which are dead.\nAre there any other ways to reset the PMU, or am I SOL?\n\nA: If you feel confident enough the only other way I know is to take the MacBook apart, remove the battery, hold down the power button for 5+ seconds and then put it all back together again. Sounds simple but it could get messy if you haven't taken one apart before.\nIf you do take it apart you could use this time to try and fix the the keyboard and give the poor thing a clean inside...\n\nA: I know the article says to use the built-in keyboard, but it may be worth trying an external wired keyboard plugged in via usb.\n\nA: I've been all over the web today looking at this very problem.  One thing that WILL NOT WORK is an external USB keyboard.  It must be the built in keyboard.  When you hold down those three keys you are completing a circuit inside the Macbook.  The only other way I've found during my research is removal of the battery then holding down the power button for a while.\n\nA: you click Input language on the right top area and then click show keyboard viewer. Then you can press the keyboard by using your mouse.\n", "Q: Is there a utility that copies the pictures I have in my digital still camera in a directory? I sometimes need to copy the pictures I have in my digital camera in a directory of my Mac.\nIs there a simple utility that copies the pictures automatically, once I plugged in the digital camera in the USB port?\n\nA: I'm not sure if you can make it automatic, but \"Image Capture\" is probably the way to get them imported with the least amount of fooling with bigger programs that are trying to do more organization-type stuff than you want.\nBarring that, you might be able to do something with AppleScript or folder actions, depending on how your camera manages the \n\nA: The software that came with your camera should do the job. Failing that, you can use iPhoto to transfer pictures into your iPhoto library; they're just filed on your hard drive at that point. \nAlso, some cameras will mount as drives on your desktop on the mac. You can just drag-and-drop the files at that point to wherever you like on the Mac. \nIf the picture aren't on your camera's on-board memory and they're on a card that's in the camera, you can use a card reader to get the pictures off the card. Some macs now come with built-in card readers for that purpose. \n\nA: If you are comfortable in the command line, and know the source directory (usually its the directory on the memory card that is always there, regardless of the state of the photos, eg normally its called Photos or JPG etc).\nIf you know this you could create a LaunchDaemon script which uses the 'StartOnMount' key.  Therefore it would detect when the camera is plugged in (and the file system is mounted) and then run a bash script to copy the contents of the memory card on the camera to a time-stamped folder on your hard drive.\nThis would be a completely automatic process, which, depending on the bash script could also remove the old photos from the camera after it finishes copying them.\n", "Q: Shiny new Macbook Pro -- can oils and sweat damage the screen? I have a brand-new Macbook Pro. As I'm almost certainly going to eventually spill something into the keyboard, I picked up a keyboard skin. It only took me a few hours to get used to typing with it; skins have come a long way since the last time I had one on a Mac.  \nI'm noticing that there's now a faint residue left on the screen, possibly the sweat or oils from my fingertips and palms. (I notice that I lean on the edge of the skin as I type.) \nIs this anything that could eventually cause screen damage? \n\nA: The screen is glass, so it's highly unlikely that sweat can damage it.\n\nA: Although its unlikely that sweat/oil from fingers will do lasting damage to your screen (in the normal lifespan of a laptop), I would only caution on ensuring that when you periodically clean these stains off that you use a very soft cloth (like the black one that came with your new Macbook Pro).\nI've seen a lot of monitors that have been scratched through the use of incorrect cleaning cloths or abrasive cleaning solutions.\n", "Q: iPhone battery runs down frequently? My iPhone's battery runs down frequently after being fully charged, what can i do?\n\nA: Based on the \"iphone\" tag on this question, I'm going to assume you're talking about an iPhone battery.  The lithium-ion batteries used in portable devices have a limited \"lifespan\" (number of charge cycles) -- their maximum charge capacity diminishes slightly every time they are charged.\nApple has published tips on battery maintenance as well as general tips to get more life out of iPhone batteries.\nUnfortunately, iPhone batteries cannot be easily replaced by consumers, but Apple will replace them for $86 with a one-week turnaround.  There are also third parties that offer to do this cheaper, but it may affect your warranty if they are not authorized technicians.\nFinally, if you are really into DIY, you can buy the parts online and replace it yourself (about $30 including tools and shipping), though some have suggested that this is a difficult procedure.\n\nA: Poor battery life can be for a variety of reasons these include:\n• Location Services in regular use, like Siri geofencing in reminders/passbook or a GPS app using it a lot. Check Settings > Privacy > Location services (in iOS 6) to see what's using it.\n• A mail account that's not set up properly or had stopped working correctly from a restored back up, for example the outgoing mail server password not being entered on an IMAP or Exchnage account.\n• Push mail being switched on. Settings > Mail > Fetch, to see how it's set up.\n• An app that's misbehaving and using a lot of CPU time (you may notice the phone warm up a little). Check your logs in Settings > General > About > Diags and usage > Diags and usage data, for anything unusual. Also check Settings > Usage - Time Since Last Full Charge to see if the time used makes sense, have you been using the phone for as long as it says? If the Standby time and in Use time are the same then something is running in the background.\n• Using the phone in a poor reception area will dramatically lower battery life, even in its on standby.\n• A corrupt restore from back up.\nThings to do to try and resolve the issue:\n• Power cycle the phone\n• Reset user preferences. Settings > General > Reset > Reset all Settings.\n• Restore phone in iTunes and set up as new. (Most invasive option, but will sort the issue).\n", "Q: Can I make Safari under iPad save passwords? Is there a way I can make Safari on my iPad 2 save passwords or auto-fill forms.\nfor example, I want it to save the user/password for my wifi router so I can access it easily without typing the user/password each time I access it.\n(I am using the latest firmware on an non-jailbroken iPad 2)\n\nA: Yes. Go to the Settings app, and select safari. There will be a section called \"Autofill\", and you can enable it to save your passwords and auto-fill your personal information taken from the address book. Also, iOS automatically saves all Wi-Fi passwords, so there is no need to save it manually yourself.\n\n\nA: The best alternative I found is LoginBox. It's simpler than all of the competitors and logs into more websites, based on my tests.\nThe best thing about it is the ease of creating new logins and the speed of logging in afterwards. It also has a nice layout of the configured websites - a dashboard with thumbnail preview of all websites.\nBottom line, give it a try, IMHO it's much better than 1Password or LastPass and by far the best option to auto login, rather then using the form auto-fill options.\n\nA: Try LastPass, an online password manager -- http://lastpass.com/\nThe service has its own iPad browser that allows easy access to the service -- http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lastpass-tab-browser/id372722009\n\nA: Another app alternative is 1Password. It works the same way as LastPass, but also has just outstanding Mac integration across Safari/Chrome/Firefox. And 1Password supports Dropbox syncing so everything stays nicely up-to-date.\n1Password\n\nA: You should use TapIN. It's an iPad app exactly for that.\nI love it, saves me a lot of time every day :)\n\nA: Another alternative to 1Password is Wallet from Acrylic software:\nhttp://www.acrylicapps.com/\nI find the 1Password UI kind of clunky and while I've used it for a while Wallet just started offering this kind of syncing...\nThe idea is to attempt to use a cloud service instead of each browser's local memory to store this stuff so it syncs between devices and you're not wracking your brain for passwords on every device.\n\nA: I really prefer LoginBox which is simple\n", "Q: How can I restrict only iPad to be connectable to USB port of Mac? I would like to allow iPads to be connected to Mac for provisioning of applications on the devices, but would also like to prohibit any other device from being connected to USB port for security reasons. Would you please let me know what is the mechanism to be adopted to achieve this?\n\nA: There are two basic solutions for restricting access to computer ports -- software-based, and hardware-based.\nA software-based solution would probably be best in your case, but it might not be cheap.  There are security software packages available to block access to devices that are not on a \"whitelist\" that you establish.  One commercial example is Endpoint Protector.\nHardware-based solutions involve physically blocking access to certain ports.  The \"meathead\" way to do this is using epoxy.  People have done this, but it is generally not recommended as it is completely irreversible.  You would glue an iPad adapter cable into one port, then fill the other ports with a putty (to prevent epoxy from getting inside the computer where you don't want it) and glue over them.\nThere are a few USB port \"locks\" on the market that physically block USB ports -- for example, Kensington USB Port Lock ($15).  But you'd still have to epoxy an iPad adapter cable to your computer to allow iOS devices to connect while preventing access to other devices.\n", "Q: Is there an GTalk application for the iPad 2?

Is there any virtual machine which works on a PPC (non-Intel) Mac 10.4? I am killing myself finding a virtual machine for Mac 10.4. Everything that I found needs an Intel Mac.\n\nA: The primary solution for PowerPC Macs was Microsoft's now-defunct Virtual PC.  It was discontinued several years ago, so you'll really have to do some digging to find a copy.  (Be warned -- it runs slow as molasses.  You'd probably be better off buying a cheap PC.)\nThere's also Q emulator, which supposedly runs on PowerPC, but I have never tried it.\n\nA: There is a download link for Virtual PC 7 on this video that you may try.\nIf you're really desperate, the Darwine project released a few experimental builds of Wine that worked on PPC several years ago, but the project was dropped due to very poor performance, and I expect that you need to do a lot of hacking to get a program up-and-running…\n\nA: https://www.qemu.org/\nhas worked for this\nman. here is a video\nhttps://youtu.be/B-qhSxI0NtE\n\nA: Om my PPC PowerMac G3 I did have one installed the copy from my friend however the machine had a kernel issue due to trying to install a modified OS X Leopard and I had to restore the disk.

I'd watch the Wolfram Alpha app as they'd be my obvious choice for someone that would enable a \"mail the data\" to their servers for a solution.\niOS is certainly powerful enough to solve this class of problems, but we're still waiting for someone to invest the time in releasing an \"app for that\". \n", "Q: When does the keychain unlock itself? I am using the \"lock when sleeping\" preference of the login keychain. When I use my computer after wake up, as expected i have to enter my password when an application (such as the webbrowser or instant messenger) try to access a keychain entry. However, sometimes the login keychain is unlocked after entering the password, sometimes it remains locked and the application gets single-time access. What rule does that follow? System is up to date 10.6.\n\nA: There is a setting that can lock the Keychain after a period of inactivity.  So if you have unlocked it after sleep and then find after a few minutes that it is locked, it probably means that this option is turned on.\n\nIt's also possible that on some items you haven't checked 'always remember' and so it is popping up the request for credentials via keychain.\nYou can also repair your keychain using this guide.\n", "Q: Is there any way to change the output filename for qlmanage? Is there any way to specify the output filename and directory that qlmanage uses?\nWe are using qlmanage to convert word documents to HTML, and it writes Preview.html to its temp directory.  You can specify the output directory with -o, so right now we create a new directory for each file we write, which works fine, but... not optimal.  \nNo mention of such a facility in the command line options, but i thought i'd ask in case there is some undocumented trick.\nthanks,\nian.\n\nA: You can use textutil to convert Word documents to HTML and specify the output filename; it uses a different converter, though, which may not be acceptable for your uses.\nWith regard to qlmanage, you're abusing Quick Look here already.  The output is a directory, not a file, which is only designed for Quick Look to consume.  That Preview.html is a fixed filename is by design; otherwise the Quick Look displayer wouldn't know where to start.  That you're able to extract the HTML output yourself is a nice side effect, nothing more.\n", "Q: Right-click on a MacBook Pro running Windows 7?

Moreover, I was able even to login (in blind mode) and really check if the machine is running, because my Internet sharing has been started as soon as Mac OS starts. So my network has been accessible in other computers and I was sure that the problem has been just in my monitor.\nThan I tried to turn the computer on/off manually by holding power button many, many times. And it almost always did the same process, starting with a typical Mac sound at the beginning. But later on, it stopped to make this sound, however turned on with a sound of checking the CD, running ventilators. But I am not able to login anymore and seems login view is not loaded anymore. Monitor is still not turning on at all. Perhaps, this could happen, because I was pushing on/off button too many times or so?!\nBut right now, I am having it turning on, just with ventilators, case light and a sound of checking the CD, and that's it. Computer is opened and located here on my table ready for any checks...\nI already has been in Apple center and they made a 3 days diagnostic, saying my motherboard is broken, but I don't believe them at all. Services are made very bad here in Austria. I was trying to explain that I was able even to login, but the conclusion has been final - motherboard and -$50.\nSo, I don't trust in their checking at all and wish to hear your opinions, if this is motherboard or some other stuff could be broken?!\n\nA: It could very well be a broken logic board.  But try to do the following and see if it fixes it :\nReset System Management Controller as per these instructions\nReset PVRAM as per these instructions\nDoing these two resets generally fixes most hardware based issues on Macs.  You can also eliminate that its your monitor by trying to see if you can replicate this problem on other screens.\nBut I would trust the advice you've been given by Apple on this one.\n\nA: Since almost all the electronics in a laptop are on the same board (the motherboard), it in entirely possible that the part of the motherboard that the monitor plugs into is broken and the rest isn't, but you still have to replace the whole thing. Sorry to say, but the repair center you visited is probably right.\n\nA: It could be that your laptop is in \"clamshell\" mode.  In other words, it thinks the display should go to an external monitor.  \nI had a Macbook Pro that would do this if I ever shut the lid before disconnecting the external monitor.  When I opened it back up, it would try to display everything on the external monitor -- and would act very much like yours does.  It would accept inputs from keyboard and mouse, the backlighted keyboard would come on if I covered the sensors, etc.  \nSo, hook it up to an external monitor and see if it shows you anything.\n", "Q: Cursor navigation in Terminal I quite often find myself needing to move the cursor to the beginning or the end of the line.\nIs there a keyboard shortcut or other magic trick to move the cursor apart from the arrow keys. \n\nA: ^ + A for the beginning of the line\n^ + E for the end of the line.\nWorks with Cocoa control too.\n^ = Ctrl\n\nA: You can also hold down the alt key and click with your mouse wherever you want the cursor to jump to. \nNote however, that this only works on the same line the cursor currently is on, so if you have a long command wrapping around two lines, you will have to jump to the beginning of the second line, jump one character back (so you´re on the end of the first line now) and then can use the alt+mouse to navigate again. \n\nA: Meta + B is equivalent to ctrl+← in Windows, while \nMeta + F is equivalent to ctrl+→\nby default the Meta key is the Escape, but that's configurable.\n\nA: You can use vi-style line movement and modal editing on the command line by adding set -o vi to your ~/.bash_profile.\n", "Q: Remote control iPad I've been looking around and only found a couple of enterprise (price) level solutions for remote controlling an iPad/iPhone.

Changes are good, though, that your other, more expensive options are probably better. Put it this way: I installed it, played with it, and then have barely used it since. The experience isn't good enough for me. (Plus, I'd rather save the iPad's precious resources for actual apps.)\n", "Q: Are there fonts that include musical note characters? On my Mac, there is a font that contains the BEAMED EIGHT NOTES Unicode character, but there are no fonts that contains the MUSICAL SYMBOL PLUS NOTEHEAD or the MUSICAL SYMBOL QUARTER NOTE Unicode character.\nAre there fonts that contain such characters?\n\nA: Try installing the Musica font from page. This will install the musical notes you need (free). You can then test it out on this page.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The Musica typeface, available on Unicode Fonts for Ancient Scripts) has both of the unicode characters you mention; I tested it with the Character Viewer on Mac OS 10.6.6 and it seems to work fine.\n\nA: (The links to the Musica typeface don't seem to lead anywhere useful.)\nUptake of the Musical Symbols in Unicode has been very limited: there were already fonts that allowed music symbols to be incorporated into text blocks, such as the Bach Musicological Font (which is now hard to find); and notation applications use their own fonts, whose symbols tend to use the 'ASCII' glyph range.\nHowever, over the last few years, a standard for music notation symbols in Unicode has been formulated, called SMuFL. SMUFL-compliant fonts will also include glyphs in the Unicode reserved locations that you are after.\nThe SMuFL reference font, Bravura, comes in two versions, one for notation software, and the other, Bravura Text, for use in text. Either of these will include the characters you want. You can download the fonts here.\n", "Q: Magic mouse two button click stopped working My Magic mouse two finger right click stopped working 4 days ago.

It's easy to use two fingers by accident, but you have to lift your first finger and click only with the second to trigger the right click behaviour.\nI used a traditional clicky mouse before my Magic Mouse, where you can happily rest both fingers on the mouse while clicking either side, so the Magic Mouse took a bit of getting used to and this tripped me up too.\n\nA: There was an update that caused the two-button click to fail; maybe the next update will take it back.\n", "Q: After importing pictures into Aperture how can I find them in Finder?

It has its issues, but it works fairly well.\nIf you have want to mess with it there is an article here:\nhttp://www.macstories.net/tutorials/how-to-turn-your-iphone-and-ipad-into-airplay-speakers/\n\nA: It looks like you might have to wait for the iCloud (and even that isn't exactly what you ask since it won't likely be remote controllable and will require internet access). \nNo one has admitted to cracking this nut with a third party app.\n", "Q: Quick OSX startup I am totally new to OSX so sorry for this beginners question.\nIf I would like to reduce the startup time (from being completely without power to being able to use Safari) of a new (HDD only, no SSD) iMac as much as possible what do I need to do? Does using hibernation or something help ? What would that time approximately be? By how much could I improve this time if the iMac had an SSD?\nUPDATE:\nTo make my question more clear, I need to cold start (be it from hibneration or some other nifty OSX thing that you could suggest) the Mac frequently because it is completely without power (unplugged) when not in use. I want to minimize that time as much as possible and would like know what average time I can achieve and with or without SSD. So I know whether it is worth getting a SSD.\n\nA: What you may want to look into is the hibernate mode that your mac uses. You should read the man page for 'pmset' for further details ('man pmset' from a terminal window) and be sure you understand what it means.\nBy default on non-portable macs, the sleep mode keeps memory powered on while most of the machine sleeps. This way it only takes a couple of seconds to wake and sleep, BUT, you need to keep the machine powered.\nOn portables, by default, in addition to keeping memory powered, it also saves a copy to disk, so that in the event of loss of power, the machine can resume from the disk copy, though this takes longer. In this mode the mac typically takes about 15 seconds to sleep, and about two to wake.\nThere is another option - copy memory to disk, and then remove all power. This mode means that it'll probably take 10-15 seconds to 'sleep' and about the same to wake, but power can be removed completely once memory is copied. Setting this mode requires a terminal command:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode = 25\nOnce this mode is set, you will be able to sleep your mac, remove power, reapply power and wake it up. The sleep and wake phases will probably take about 10 seconds. Depends on disk speed and the amount of memory installed and used.\n\n\n*\n\n*barry\n\n\nA: It will always depend on the individual situation -- hardware specs, startup programs, etc.  But when I swapped my 15\" 2009 MacBook Pro's 250GB 5400rpm boot drive with a 120GB Intel SSD my boot time dropped from about 90 seconds to about 50 seconds -- just like that.  The difference in speed really was amazing, and worth every penny, in my opinion.\nTo speed your bootup time in software, you should reduce as much as possible the number of programs that run on startup.  You can find some of these in System Preferences -> Accounts under the \"Login Items\" tab for each user.  Delete any entries that don't need to be there.  (If you're not sure what something does, it's best to leave it alone.)\nAs someone new to Mac, this may be more advanced than you want to get into, but there are some other startup items run by \"launchd\" that won't appear in the System Preferences pane.  You can use the excellent app Lingon ($5) to view/edit these items.\n\nA: Apple Macs have an excellent sleep/hibernation system.  On my 2011 Macbook Pro, I just close the lid and the Mac goes instantly to sleep.  On an iMac there is a menu option or keypress to put the iMac to sleep instantly.\nTo wake, on a laptop just open the lid, on an iMac press a keyboard key or move the mouse.\nThe computer will startup almost instantaneously.  At most there will be a 2 or 3 second delay, particularly if you've put the computer to sleep with a lot of programs running.\nWith the small amount of power these devices use during sleep, and the fact that they spin down the hard drives during sleep, it is definitely a more beneficial way to stop and start your Mac that powering it up and down each time you want to use it.\n\nA: Welcome to a mac. You will find that the longer you use a mac, the less you add customizations and system modifications that make the system less stable. \nOver time the mac gets faster and faster so you only have to reboot once or twice a month. Just put it to sleep and you can easily reduce your cumulative startup time to 1/30 th of what you are used to by avoiding them as much as possible. \nDo fire up activity monitor as over time memory will leak and you will have to log out and back in to clean up allocated ram and ocassionally reboot. \nSSD generally make cold start times between 4 and 10 times as fast as a spinning hard drive. The more apps you start at launch, the more dramatic the startup difference. \nDo read the man page for pmset to enable hibernation if you don't spring for a SSD - that will allow the machine to read the sleep image rather than fully bootstrap from nothing. \n", "Q: Is Snow Leopard Server a good candidate for everyday use as a main OS? Although similar questions have been asked before [1,2] non of them fully address whether OSX 10.6 Sever is a good candidate for everyday use on a top of the line computer. For the really lazy;\n1 - Discusses on the importance of having a high spec computer in order for OSX Server to perform to its best.\n2 - Discusses on the appropriateness of using OSX Sever in a software development environment.\nGetting on to the nitty gritty, my question is more focused towards whether using the aforementioned OS is a good idea for an advanced used (not so much in network related subjects) that desires to do both Software Development, Image/Video editing, and setting up shared services such as; Calendars, Webservices (Wiki's + Websites) and email.\nWhen I say top of the range, I refer to the recently released iMac configured to the following specs;\n\n\n*\n\n*Quad-Core i7 3.4Ghz (Boost to 3.8Gz)\n\n*8 Gb of DDR3 RAM\n\n*2 Gb ATI Radeon HD 6970M\n\n*2 TB of storage. Partitioned 1:1 between Mac and Windows\n\n\nIn terms of internet connectivity I run a 50Mbps fibre-optic downlink with 5mbps uplink. \nThe reason why I believe OSX Server will be an option to consider for me is the fact I plan to work on a startup with a colleague (with no IT Background) but we live in different countries for now, so the ability of;\n\n\n*\n\n*Having an easy to use wiki\n\n*The ability to create VPN for accessing NAS files\n\n*The option of remotely setting up business related software and beta releases on their PC\n\n*Facility for sync and collaboration (Mail, Calendar, and Document access editing)\n\n\nseem to represent an added value between the two. I obviously understand that having the server setup in a computer that will be getting switched off and on will disable the services, but appart form that is there any other advantage or disadvantage I am unaware of?\nIf you are familiar with any software that possesses similar functionality to what am looking for, please feel free to put your suggestions forward. \n\nA: To answer your question, you can work perfectly under Server (given the above machine) in fact, if you disable some of the services, the OS X will be very similar to the regular version. On the other hand, you can always rely on Google docs and calendars, Remote Desktop and even OpenVPN if you really need an internal network. \nI mean, configuring the above (even on OS X Server) carries a lot of overhead, backup planning and maintenance. \nFocus on your \"startup\" and leave the unrelated tasks to others. Will having a server at your place (with all the electricity costs associated) make your start up better? earn money faster? \nAnyway, that's a topic for \"startups\". The answer is yes, that computer is more than capable to serve as a server for all those tasks and much more. \n\nA: No. I love mac server and have used it for years and it's one of the best UNIX servers for small businesses - but for all the details you ask in your question, it's not the right choice for the functionality you mention. The mac you have is plenty powerful but will you really take down your server to boot into windows?\nServer running as your everyday mac won't help you be a better developer.\nServer won't help with image and video editing (and may slow them down)\nServer is overkill for a small company's (less than 5 to 10 people's) needs for calendaring, wiki, web and email - especially one with no IT background.\nA cisco small office VPN router costs less than $150 if you don't want to run the equivalent VPN software for free on the non-server Mac OS.\nGet server and use it because you want to learn by doing, not by making up marginal reasons to justify it. (I don't think you're doing that but wanted to make the point that running server takes time and expertise)\nServer is designed and tuned for multi user performance and not single user workload. Some consumer programs don't run as well in Server (or are not supported on server), but the vast majority will work fine even if you can't call up Microsoft or Apple for support once they hear you are running on a server OS. Servers are designed and tuned to run for a long time and you don't want to be rebooting them to take away the services they provide. You can't optimize for both a client workload and a server workload so there is no free lunch and one or both will suffer if combined.\nIf you only want to play and learn the answer is YES - run server on your desktop, but your question includes you providing real services for a running business. Only you can decide which tradeoff is most important for your situation, but there are a few to be aware of before going down this path. \nRunning a cheap server (or even look into vmware to virtualize your server os on a larger iMac or MacPro to isolate the server OS from your desktop OS). In practice, you won't likely be slowed down with a distinct (or virtualized) server on the local network (even slow 100Mb ethernet). Your wiki and VPN will be blazing fast with only a handful of users connecting.\nIt's really hard for even a workgroup of 25 people to bog down a current mac mini server. They really don't need fast CPU or disks. Adding low end RAID storage and FireWire 800 allows the mini to scale up. It takes a special video workload or hundreds of users to need Mac Pro Server. You can learn most of what you need on OS X client by starting up the server processes on the client and save yourself the $499 license fee. I would wait since Lion is announced to have server included at no extra cost.\n\n\n*\n\n*most of what you need to learn is free or the cost of a Lion OS.\n\n*if you depend on services - having a client workload detracts from the server workload - better to have a mac mini for the server that you can let run 100% focused on the server workload.\n\n*servers rarely are used to capacity so old hardware is often useful as a server well past their usefulness for an interactive client workload. Pick up a used mac for a song and run server locally or co-located.\n\n*security - are you comfortable gaming and install apps all the time on your server where your corporate information is stored? You might want that locked down and unchanging which restricts normal client flexibility. Your server admin account should be highly secured since servers are online 24/7 and high targets for crackers/hackers.\n\n*maintenance - every change you make on the server could interrupt services which is why businesses isolate and control their server OS to a much larger degree than client OS. It costs time and money to do otherwise.\n\n\nA: Because Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server are (besides a few plists and bundled software) identical operating systems, you certainly could use Mac OS X Server as your everyday operating system, just like you can run Mac OS X as a server; see diymacserver.com.\nBut—other than having a few additional applications for administering Mac OS X Server itself, you don’t any extra capabilities.\nI agree with some of the other commenters—use the great web apps that are available for calendaring, project management, collaborative document editing—a wiki.\nFinally, if you need to do development, get XCode if you don’t already have it. Vagrant is great for being able to quickly setup specific environments, like Ruby on Rails with MySQL and Apache running on CentOS, for example.\n\nA: For production uses, AWS is pretty great. They have a lot of very reasonable tools for network security (VPCs and security groups) and really easy high availability (auto scaling, ELB etc.) They also have free classes for startups (two days of training will put you ahead of most of the competition)\nEmail and calendar are probably easiest handled with Google Apps for domains. (Also includes drive for file sharing, and sites and docs for shared documentation)\nHowever, I might still run a Mac server for the corporate environment simply for ease of use and reasonable default security. For example, I spent several days setting up several varieties of VPN on Linux. When I've set this up on MacOS server it took five minutes. Configuring the firewall and disk encryption on Mac are also pretty easy.\ntl;dr \n\n\n*\n\n*AWS and Linux in production\n\n*Google Apps for domains for email, file\nsharing and documentation\n\n*Mac OS for any remaining local services\n(if any)\n\n", "Q: Stop motion movie with iMovie11 How can I make a stop motion movie with iMovie.\nI just want to play around, so I don't want to buy iStopMotion.\nAll tutorials I've found are with iMovie09 or older. \nI have some 50 pictures in a folder, that I d'like to use for that...\n\nA: There is a really cool video tutorial on YouTube that shows you how to make stop motion movies with iMovie 11 from photos in your iPhoto library (although can be any folder source).\nCheck it out here.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Is it possible to view passwords through Terminal?

Avoid conflicts before they occur. \nObserving conflicts\nIf a conflict does occur: Loïc Wolff's answer should be good for some but not all types. \n(A shortcut set in your unnamed menu bar app might be in conflict with something, but not appear as a conflict in System Preferences … and so on.)\n\nA: You can check on the Keyboard shortcuts Preferences panes if the shortcut is alreaady attributed.\nIf it is, there will be a yellow sign with an exclamation mark to notify you that it's taken.\nIt might not take in consideration global shortcuts from other apps. But at least, you'll have native ones.\n\nA: While there are various sites including Apple that list the default combinations, I'm not sure of any way of listing your own (including any changes you might have made). I'd say the handiest way is to try the combination you want and see if it does anything. If not, you should be good to go. If it does something, you'll need to change one or the other.\n", "Q: Purchased video on iTunes rather than gifting, can this be corrected? My friend tried to gift me a film in the iTunes store but he says that somehow he \"received\" it by mistake (his mistake, most likely).\nWhat are his options now.  Can he:\n\n\n*\n\n*Return the purchase\n\n*\"Gift\" the purchase to me\n\n*Call someone to correct the error and reassign the item to me instead?\n\n\nA: bckbck is correct in terms of the letter of the law.

They're aware that mistakes happen, and are sometimes happy to rectify them for you - though they are not obliged to do so.\nAll iTunes customer service is carried out via email. Here's a link to an email page your friend can use to explain the issue to iTunes customer service.\n\nA: No.\nFrom the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions:\n\nAll sales and rentals of products are final.\n\n", "Q: The new iMacs come with AMD HD 6770M or HD 6970M. How do they compare? the 27\" versions of the new iMac come with either the AMD HD 6770M or HD 6970M GPU. How do they compare performancewise? Is it worth its money?\n\nA: You can compare these graphic cards at Tom's Hardware\n\nA: It seems the answer is 'not huge, but noticeable', maybe 15-20%. I'm not sure what the price tag difference is off hand, but if you're working on graphics apps, games, video - get what you can afford, with the iMac's not being upgradeable in that sense, what can it hurt to do so? With an all in one I'm a big believe in buying what you can afford to get.\nThat said - if you're going to replace the machine next year? Don't worry so much.\n", "Q: Git: command not found during Git installation (Mac OSX 10.6) I am trying to install Git on my Mac (OSX 10.6) following the official Git tutorial.\nI had no problem until I had to set my username and my email.\nEvery time I tried I got -bash: git: command not found\nI tried echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile + restarted the Terminal.

Does any one have a definitive answer?\nI am reading so many answers that tell you both thing, one tells you that it is not a problem at all and the other one is very definite NO...Is there any developer over here that has a jailbreaked iPhone that is using it to test the application in development?\nFrom what I heard from friends, Not over the web, Apple don't allow that and is checking for that, but over the web I've read that it is not a problem....\nI will eventually remove the  jailbreak that was installed on my lovely iPhone, but I want to know if to do it now or can I wait with that because I want the person that installed it to remove it and give me the iPhone I asked for....never mind, if I can wait, I prefer to do it this way (might take weeks of month as we do not leave in the same place) but if I have to, I will do it by myself and that's all..\n\nA: I've used my former lost jailbroken iPhone to develop, yes. But you'll need more than jailbreaking, though, granted, jailbreak is a must (except in very specific cases):\n\n\n*\n\n*Actually the only very rare specific exception I know of is the Unity 3D's amazing Remote - but that does (currently) limit phone features that can be tested. No gyroscope for instance.\n\n*The regular way is hacking Xcode. Of course the limitation here is deploying: only with USB.\n\n*Another way could be something like TestFlight - while I'm not sure this can be done without a proper developer license, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a way to do it Over the Air.\n\nA: The jailbreak does not affect the functionality of the phone except to allow MORE things to run on it, so there's no reason to think it won't work for development.\n", "Q: What is iTunesHelper? In my account settings under Login there is an app called iTunesHelper. What does this app do? Can I remove it from the login apps without affecting iTunes, or will it be put back?\n\nA: It is a program that launches iTunes whenever an iPhone/iPod/iPad is plugged in. If I recall correctly, if you remove it, iTunes will no longer automatically launch when an iPhone/iPod/iPad is plugged in.\n", "Q: How do I automatically reconnect to wifi when the connection is lost? I'm on OS X 10.6. When I'm downloading a torrent, the connection is sometimes lost.\nAnd because of this, the download stops too, and the only solution I found to reconnect is to manually turn off the WiFi and turn it back on.\nIs there a program or trick to restore the network connection automatically? \n\nA: While this doesn't solve your problem immediately, I can say that I had the exact same issue with my iMac and OS X 10.6. My solution? Get a new router. From that point on, the wireless connection was far more stable, and while the issue itself exists (say I make a lot of changes in the router that requires the connection to drop -- my iMac won't always reconnect), the router itself seems to make a big deal in the connectivity. (I went after one of the newer N routers; my previous router was a G router.)\nOther things to try (before shelling out $$$):\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your router's firmware is up-to-date (Mine was, unfortunately)\n\n*See if you can install a custom firmware (like DD-WRT) that might solve the problem (this is really dependent upon router type, so not all routers are supported)\n\n\nA: This will do it\njust replace  with your network name\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# turn on wifi if it's turned 'Off'\nif [ $(networksetup -getairportpower en1 | grep -c 'Off') = '1' ]\nthen $(networksetup -setairportpower en1 on)\nfi\n\n# cycle wifi power if missing 'IP address'\nif [ $(networksetup -getinfo Wi-Fi | grep -c 'IP address:') = '1' ]\nthen $(networksetup -setairportpower en1 off; network setup -setairportpower en1 on)\nfi\n\n# initiate connection if not connected to the correct network\nif [ $(networksetup -getairportnetwork en1 | grep -c '<networkName>') = 0]\nthen $(networksetup -setairportnetwork en1 '<networkName>')\nfi\n\n", "Q: Mail.app: Clear Address Auto-Fill Cache How do I clear the auto-fill address field cache in Mac Mail?  I have loads of old addresses that I do not send email to.\nA removal and reinstallation of the email accounts does not affect the cache.\n\nA: See the menu Window -> Previous Recipients - you can select all and delete or be more selective.\nOnce that's done you may also want to prune your address book or disable mail from auto-filling from there as desired.\n\nA: Alternatively, if there's only one email address you're worried at the moment just add it to an email then right click on it and select \"Remove from Previous Recipient List\" and it will no longer come up. \n", "Q: Plugging a MIDI Device in a MacBook Pro What options are there for plugging a MIDI-device that offers only a standard DIN-5 MIDI connector into a MacBook Pro?\nThe marketing print on the box of my Rock Band 3 Wireless Keyboard talks about plugging the keyboard into a computer for use as a general MIDI instrument when not playing Rock Band, but there's no cables inside the box to accomplish this, and again, the only port it offers is a DIN-5 port.\n\nA: Simple and cheap: USB to MIDI connector. If you need to plug in more than one MIDI device there are dedicated MIDI interfaces. Additionally, many A/D audio interfaces - that you might also use to record input from analog devices like guitars or microphones - include MIDI ins/outs.\nWithout more information about your specific needs I can't say the products I linked to are the best choice, but they are representative of the vast array of options for plugging a MIDI device into your MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: How to use an iPod touch with big fingers? I've had an iPod touch for over 6 months now, and while I've gotten better at hitting buttons and icons with practice, some things remain virtually impossible to tap.\nFor example, the tiny circles (one above the line, one below the line) for selecting text are pretty much impossible to hit.  Auto-complete options (like the \"I\" if I type \"i\") are similarly difficult.\nI don't think I have poor motor skills: I'm a musician!  And while my hands are big, I don't think my fingers are especially fat.\nIs there anything I can do to make it possible to use these features?  For example, is there some interaction I don't know about (the iPod touch manual is basically non-existent), or is there a setting to make the tiniest controls appear larger for me?\n\nA: One option is to use the Zoom function from the Accessibility options. From the Settings app, choose General > Accessibility > Zoom and turn Zoom on.\nZoom provides several features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once Zoom is turned on, you can double tap with three fingers (assuming you can fit three of your fingers on the screen at once!) to zoom in or out. \n\n*With three fingers you can drag your fingers around to change the area of the screen that is zoomed in.\n\n*Tap with three fingers then tap again and drag your fingers up and down to  zoom in and out more.\nThese should make the targets a bit easier to hit although it will probably slow you down a little.\nThis function was discovered by a friend who accidentally turned it on after a few drinks and couldn't work out hour to turn it off. An iPod touch is really hard to use when zoomed in if you don't know why it is zoomed in.\n\nA: I don't think there are settings that will enlarge controls, but you can try modifying your workflow in some ways. Also, I don't understand the \"i\" vs. \"I\" example. Doesn't the auto correct require zero interaction on your part? Or are you trying to reject the auto correction?\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold on the keyboard to make letters bigger, and make sure you've selected the correct one\n\n*Rather than try to drag the little dots for selection, press select all. Later, after you paste, delete what you don't want\n\n*Get an iPad\n\n*Get an external keyboard for the iPhone (supported in iPod Touch 3+, iPhone 3GS+)\n\n*Use one of the many styluses (or styli) available for iPhones.\n\nA: Researchers have found that iOS registers your taps as further away from the center than they actually were.  You could try tapping slightly inside where you think you need to, to get it to register properly.\n\nA: I do have big fingers, though far from huge or fat, and my learning curve on using iPhone was quite steep - it took me some time to get used to hitting the right place. To me, I had to realize the exact position I had to press and nowadays I can even use the tiny circles for selecting text, even if I still miss it sometimes.\nMy recommendation? Practice. Play games! A good start is Catcha Mouse. I remember that one was a serious challenge for me in the beginning and now I can never miss a spot on it. ;)\n", "Q: How to connect to MacBook to a Windows 7 machine that is connected to a Ubuntu machine via VPN? I don't know if I at the right posiution with this task.\nI have ubuntu running on a server. A notebook has Cisco VPN Client installed and is connected to this ubuntu server. Because I dislike working through putty I want to use my more beautiful terminal of my MacBook. Is it possible to connect to this ubuntu server through the Windows 7 NoteBook without having to establish a VPN connection on the MacBook?\n\nA: This might work by using putty as a tunnel on the Windows machine, and allowing remote hosts to connect to the tunnel. If the cisco vpn connection is set to disable local network traffic (which is quite common) then it almost certainly won't work. Also Cisco VPN client doesn't support Internet Connection Sharing. It seems like a complicated way of doing things - why not just enable the VPN directly from the Mac - the client is built-in to the OS and takes way quicker to connect than Cisco's own client.\n", "Q: Best way to uninstall; backup programs on Mac Macbook laptop has a few programs .. in which I'd like to uninstall \nand then keep the programs on a disc or external hd. \nShould I clone the program? (best suggested freeware? eg. Clonezilla or ..) \nor use a software such as Time Machine or Carbon Copy Cloner?\nWhat are other best tips on speeding up Mac OS settings? (tuning particular features, functions on control panel?) \n\nA: To uninstall programs, just delete them. \nTo back them up, the best idea is to keep the installer. In most cases, this is the .dmg the app came in. If it came from the App Store, there's nothing to keep. Other programs can come with installer packages (.pkg) or apps; these are what you'd keep in this case.\n\nA: Simply \"trashing\" apps from the Applications directory can leave behind little files all over your system.  For complete installation, there are several apps that can find and remove the accompanying \"helper\" files.\nTwo of the more popular options are...\n\n\n*\n\n*AppZapper ($13) -- very simple, best interface\n\n*AppCleaner (free) -- free version of above\n\n\nThere is also an app called Hazel ($22, free trial available) that can \"watch\" your Applications folder, and offer to delete the helper files when an app gets trashed.  (Probably not worth it for the \"uninstall\" feature alone, but it also automatically organizes my Downloads folder and keeps my desktop clean.)\n\nA: If the already installed programs are not useful for you from future P.O.V., then simply uninstall them from your Mac hard drive. It will also improve the Mac performance significantly by freeing up the Mac hard drive space. \nAlso, both CloneZilla and Time Machine are free programs, and you can use any one of them as per your requirements. However, sometimes using these free program can results in un-necessary data loss problems (that is why I avoid free programs).\n", "Q: How can I create a shortcut to switch to a specific keyboard layout?

They don't appear otherwise per this article from Apple's knowledgebase.\nI can't find any way around this limitation. However, there is a built-in keyboard shortcut for switching between keyboard layouts, if not for switching to a specific keyboard layout. You can find this shortcut in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard & Text Input:\n\n", "Q: Using Garage Band sounds for commercial purposes Im making a Drumming app for the iphone and the ipod touch.\nI was searching for good drum samples around the internet, but couldn't find anything fitting. Then i thought of garageband and its drum kits which contained the samples that i needed.\nWill apple allow me to use the garageband's kit sounds separatly and for commercial purposes?\n\nA: Actually, you can't. The linked article specifies exactly that you can't:\n\nto create your own original music\n  compositions or audio projects. You\n  may broadcast and/or distribute your\n  own music compositions or audio\n  projects that were created using the\n  Audio Content, however, individual\n  audio loops may not be commercially or\n  otherwise distributed on a standalone\n  basis, nor may they be repackaged in\n  whole or in part as audio samples,\n  sound effects or music beds.\"\n\n(emphasis mine)\nYou can create as many songs as you want using all the sounds you have in the loops and sell the songs. But you will be packaging the sounds (or repackaging) as audio samples of your application which seems to be forbidden.\n\nA: No you can not - what you ask is akin to distributing the loops on a standalone basis as loops. But you're free to incorporate them into your own commercial works. There's an Apple KB article on it: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2931\n", "Q: Why do the new iMacs have mobile video cards? I noticed that the new iMacs graphics cards are AMD Radeon HD 6970M.  \nWhy do the new iMacs have mobile video cards? What are the implications of those cards? Are those cards as powerful as dedicated desktop graphics cards?\n\nA: Four factors are in play for choosing how to design a system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Space\n\n*Cost\n\n*Performance\n\n*Reliability\n\n\nI certainly won't speak for Apple's engineers, but buying in volume lets a video chip manufacturer pack more performance in a lesser cost package. Any performance that isn't balanced with the rest of the system is wasted performance. One would presume this was the optimal choice for the new iMacs given the state of components available.\nPerformance is also about efficiency - so if the raw benchmark is big enough to drive three huge monitors on the 27 inch model, why not choose a smaller mobile chipset, manage less drivers in the OS, reuse the same chip on the mobile line and free sourcing, engineering, testing and repair inventory assets for other more pressing problems to solve?\nWe will soon have benchmarks to see whether the designers did their jobs well this revision. My limited testing shows the new iMacs to scream compared to old MacPro and iMacs which were no slouch in the graphics department by my standards.\n\nA: Yes these Mobile GPUs are very powerful. You might also find them in 14 pound Alienware \"Gaming\" Laptops for instance. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro, external display black screen with 1680x1050 I have bought a new monitor Samsung SyncMaster 2243. I have been using it normally on windows with 1680x1050 resolution for almost a year now. I tried to connect it to my MacBook Pro via VGA to Mini display port adapter. It worked fine but 1440x900 resolution showed up. So I tried to set it to native display resolution 1680x1050 and now only thing I see is black screen. It works only for a few seconds per minute approximately. There are flashes. I cant lower the refresh rate, there is 60Mhz and no option to select lower.\nDo you have any ideas what to try? Apple documentation says that Mini display port to VGA adapter supports 1920 resolution.\nThank you\n\nA: Apple today released an update that addresses external display support in Macbook Pros.  Give that a try.\n", "Q: Mac app to show hard drive consumption/usage? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I find more disk space? \n\nIs there a program or app that i can use to tell me where all of my hard disk space has gone? I'd like a graph (pie chart) if possible, but I prefer free/low cost over the aesthetics of such a program.\n\nA: Disk Inventory X is a great tool for this. While its not a pie chart, it is a visual graph of your usage, as well as relative sizes to other files. Colors are also used to group like files together. I have used this a few times to find what was using up extra disk space. \nIts free too. \n\nA: DaisyDisk should suit your needs. It costs $19, but has a free trial available. Paying for the app gives you: \n\n\n*\n\n*No \"nag-screens\", badges or overlays\n\n*All functions, including the in-app deletion, are available\n\n*Free updates\n\n*Priority support by e-mail\n\n*One license can be used on multiple Macs\n\n\nSo registering isn't exactly required and there isn't a time limit, but there are some features that you don't get with the free version.\n\nA: I've been using GrandPerspective for several years now and been very happy.\n\nA: WhatSize is my tool of choice and has a free trial. If I didn't need the extra functionality it allows, I would also check out a free trial of DaisyDisk. Although it's more focused on pretty animations and presentation than full function (at this point in it's life), there are advantages to getting DaisyDisk through the Mac App Store. GrandPerspective makes my head hurt but I know many people who swear by it instead of at it.\n", "Q: Function keystrokes 'ate' by host when running Win7 in a VirtualBox I'm a recent Mac convert, but still need to use Windows for work related tasks. A man's gotta eat & pay for internet access.\nI have VirtualBox setup w/ a Windows 7 VM. The VM has Visual Studio 2008 installed, along w/ various needed utilities. Everything works great or as expected except for the fact that pressing most of the F keys (F1-F12, excluding F5 & F6) are intercepted by the host OS and processed. I know you can press Command+Fn+F to accomplish this; however, a lot of quick access commands are assigned to the F-keys. (Especially F9-F11 for debugging). These are accessed quite often and the 3 finger combo gets old, fast.\nQuestion:  Is there anyway w/ VirtualBox to, perhaps only in full screen mode, to have the host OS pass those through or otherwise not process them w/o the need for Command+Fn?\nI've tried googling but haven't had much success.\nTIA\n\nA: With 10.6 and a USB keyboard, the Fn keys pass through to the app; OS-X only intercepts the media functions.\nIn your OS-X's Keyboard SysPrefs pane, is: \n\nUse F1, F2, etc. keys as standard\n  function keys\n\nselected?\nWith this selection, my (unshifted) F-keys pass straight through to my VBox VM.  With it unselected, I need to use the Fn key to generate type them (even within OS-X).\n\nA: also note that in Keyboard ==> Keyboard shortcuts ==> \"Mission Control\" settings disable F11 and F12 for show desktop and show gadgets, excuse me, show dashboard.  \n\nA: Not that I'm aware of, no. However, if you have a full size keyboard, there's a second Fn key to the right of the Delete key which can be used in place of the Command+Fn combination.\n", "Q: iMac fans stopped, what must I do? Just a minute ago my iMac's fan stopped spinning (sound like it broke). I heared no noise coming out of it anymore and I quickly checked iStat which reported a fan rotation speed of 0 rpm (usually 1500 rpm). I turned my Mac off immediately.\nWhat should I do? I am in the Netherlands so there are no Apple Stores here.\nI also don't want to turn it on again because that could result in a CPU meltdown (usual CPU temperature was 42°C). Very little chance the fan turned off because the CPU was cool at that moment, since I was playing Minecraft, converting four videos and playing one at the same time.\nMy iMac is a model from 2010, 21 inch. What can I do?\n\nA: You should certainly request help online or through the phone - (31) 0900 7777 703 - in either Netherlands or the country where your mac was originally sold. Fans are pretty easy to diagnose remotely since it's almost always the fan unit failing (or when it's not that, the next most likely cause is simply reconnecting the fan cable) so you can often ask for a parts and labor quote to help you decide what to do.\nYou seem to indicate it's the CPU fan. It and the hard drive fan are very hard to replace as you have to disconnect and remove the LCD panel, the logic board and many of the other parts. The optical fan is more amenable to a DIY repair. All the connectors are very delicate and if you break them, the cost to repair can be pretty large. (Think $800 to $1100 for a whole logic board). iFixit.com has good take apart manuals and once you have a quote or two from authorized service providers, you might decide to get inside to reconnect the cables and at least look around.\nMy advice is don't do anything yourself until you're sure Apple won't cover it by calling them first to get a quote. The main hardware warranty has great links for getting service worldwide - since it's quite long I'll pull the links here for quick reference:\n\n\n*\n\n*International Support Information \n\n*Apple Authorized Service Providers \n\n*Apple Retail Store \n\n*Apple Support and Service Phone Contacts Worldwide \n\n*Apple Complimentary Support\nLastly, don't be afraid to run it for short time and low CPU use to get more information and be sure which fan went out. The CPU will reduce clock rate when it gets warm, then it will go to sleep for 30 seconds if that doesn't keep it cool, next the OS will shut down (all of the above events get logged at default settings except maybe the clock rate). The CPU will also shut everything off abruptly if all of the above fail. Don't run for weeks or hit the CPU with 100% tasks and expect it to last for years with the CPU fan off, but other things will have to fail for it to be a melt / fire hazard issue. I also wouldn't run it needlessly and risk MLB failure needlessly.\n\nA: I'd try and SMC reset (remove power plug) from iMac for at least 15 seconds. Then plug it back in and see if it's fixed. If not, you're going to have to bring it to a repair centre to get sorted. I wouldn't worry about attemtping to start it again - it won't melt down that quickly and it has a thermal cutout system to prevent such issues so will shut itself off before it gets too hot.\n\nA: I had fans go out on my iMac (2012) and I put a high velocity fan behind it, where the air goes into that slit along the top in the back. The iMac aluminum chassis acts as a heat sink and the fan cools the back of the iMac enough to keep it from getting hot, drawing heat away. If you have to run the mac at all, at least do that. Otherwise you will see your mac shut down on you.\n\nA: You can force the fans to be always on or off. You toggle this behavior by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown Mac and unplug power for 5 seconds.\n\n*Hold the power button down while you plug the power back in the Mac.\n\n*Release the power.

You'll need to check manufacturer specs for the drive you have in mind, as they vary, and a newer 7200 may even use less than an older 5400. But in the overall scheme of your MacBook pro, the differences are so small as to have a very negligible effect - possibly a few minutes in worst case.\nThe benefits in performance will definitely out-weigh the power issues.\nThat said, when I tried a 7200 in my previous MBP (Late 08 Unibody), I ended up putting the stock 5400 back in as I'd gotten used to almost silent/vibration free use of the machine, and the newer drive was noisier and vibrated a little bit more - now it's all relative, it was still better than my Dell work laptop, but I ended up putting it in a case and using it as an external backup drive. \n\nA: If you look at the power consumption specification of drives on manufacturer web sites eg here you'll see that the idle power usage varies by about 40% between 5400 and 7200rpm models.  That doesn't mean that the battery will run out 40% quicker, but it will have a slight impact.\nI recently weighed up this option when purchasing my new 2011 Macbook Pro and went with the 7200rpm as the speed benefit far outweighed the negligible shorter battery life.\n\nA: I read all the specs.  Here's what happened to me.\nUpgraded stock 250GB 5400 drive in MBP to a 640GB 7200 RPM.\nMUCH louder and battery life went from 5+ hours to < 2.\nI'm thinking about going the other way and replacing it with a SSD for speed and move all of my pictures to the iMac.

If you trash something on an separate volume, however, Finder will move the item into the volume’s /.Trashes/<uid>/ directory instead (because moving a file to a location on the same volume is very fast, but copying a file from some other volume to your home directory’s trash directory could be quite slow).\nTry checking your main trash directory (in a Terminal window):\nls -ld ~/.Trash\n\nIf the result does not look like start with drwx------ and show your user’s “short name” twice (the second is actually a group name), then your personal trash directory has probably been fouled. You can move it aside then logout and login again:\ncd ~ && mv .Trash .Trash.old\n# now logout and re-login\n\nThis should create a new ~/.Trash directory for you. You may want to investigate the contents of the .Trash.old file/directory to try to determine its origin.\nIf the problem is with a per-volume trash directory, you should be able to use the same idea: move it aside, eject it, then remount it (disconnect and reconnect an external disk, reopen a disk image, use Disk Utility to remount an internal volume):\ncd '/Volume/whereever' && mv .Trashes .Trashes.old\n# then eject and remount\n\nYou may need … && sudo mv … if the volume has “Owners Enabled”.\n\nA: You might want to try repairing file permissions with Disk Utility.\n\nA: If you don't want to reboot or reformat, just open a Terminal and delete files or folder with rm.

What can I do to be able to switch to space 1 easily with my mouse only ? I touch about an Exposé corner but there is a limited list of actions possible... I though about the 3rd mouse button but there is no space command in there...\nAny idea ? Any trick ? \nEDIT : I see that on the 3rd button mouse, there is a \"Other...\" item in the popup action list. Choosing this opens a dialog where I have to choose an applescrit (as far as I know). Is it possible to make a script that switch to Space 1.\nPS : I really want to shift to space one in 1-move or 1-click. I know how to go to Space 1 using only the mouse, But not \"at once\".\n\nA: The mentioned BetterTouchTool can definitely do it via keyboard shortcuts.\nAfter you install BTT, switch to Normal Mouse tab. There you click on + Add new mouse button and then click 3rd button inside the Click here to select mouse button.\nNext, if you already haven't set up keyboard shortcuts to switch directly to a space, just pick any of the three modifier keys (CTRL, Option, Command), click inside the Custom Keyboard Shortcut field and press the key along with number 1, e.g Ctrl-1.\n\nNote: if you have already set up such a shortcut, you have to disable it before trying to enter the shortcut to BTT, because OS X would otherwise capture this event and BTT won't get it.\nNow close BTT window and go to System Preferences > Exposé & Spaces > Spaces and select the appropriate modifier from the To switch directly to a space: list:\n\nNow you should be able to switch to Space 1 directly with Middle click.\nPS. I should mention that I have Magic Mouse and have BTT set up with three-finger gestures to switch spaces from mouse - very convenient.\n\nA: You could enable the icon for the menu bar in the System Preferences -> Expose & Spaces -> Spaces -> Show spaces in the menu bar\nor\nDefine the 3rd mouse button \"To activate Spaces\" on the right side at the same System Preference\n\nA: I presume you mean like flinging the mouse towards the space? I don't think you can do it other than by dragging something there - you could grab an icon from the desktop or a random window and fling it in the right direction - it'll pause briefly at the edge before moving into the space. If you use an icon from the desktop, they are common between all spaces, so it won't go amiss. \nOther than that I don't think there's a way - of course Lion will bring some gestures that work with the trackpad or the magic mouse, but I don't think it's what your really want.\n\nA: I am interested in how you propose to use the mouse to instantly switch to another Space. The only thing I can think of would be some kind of gesture, unless you are willing to sacrifice e.g. the right mouse button to enable this. \nIf you want to use gestures, perhaps you should give FlyGesture a try. It's free too. Using FlyGesture, you can have a gesture execute the keyboard shortcut needed to switch to the next Space, or even a specific Space.\n\nA: In addition to the mentioned methods above, you can drag a window to an edge or corner of the screen and that'll make spaces switch to the space in that direction.\n\nA: You can install this pref pane that does just that.

I was under the impression that iPhones (at least) could browse the Internet while on a call. But when I switch to Safari while on a phone call I get an alert view saying I can't use data on a call. \nAnd it doesn't matter if I'm in 3G Edge or GPRS (the dot) coverage. \nWhy is this, and why hasn't it always happened? And more importantly how can I change it?\n\nA: This is coming from an American, but the 3G coverage should allow simultaneous data and voice.\nFrom Apple's Website:\n\nYou can tell iPhone is connected to\n  the Internet over a cellular data\n  network if you see , or  in the status\n  bar at the top of the screen.\nIf you're outside your carrier's\n  network, you may be able to use a\n  cellular data network from another\n  carrier. Roaming charges may apply.\nNote: If not on 3G, while iPhone is\n  actively transferring data over the\n  cellular data network—downloading a\n  webpage, for example—you may not be\n  able to receive calls. Incoming calls\n  may go to voicemail.\n\nGPRS and EDGE will fail at offering both voice and data, and it might be that you initiated the call on an EDGE network, and moved over to the 3G areas, either way I would recommend resetting network settings on the phone.\nSettings>General>Reset>Reset Network Settings\n\nThis will reboot your phone, reestablish network connections, and forget your wifi passwords.\n\nA: From my experience here in Brazil's GSM, if you're browsing and then either pick or make a call, the 3G (or even Edge sometimes) continues to work while on the call, though that doesn't happen always and sometimes I do receive the warning as well, not only on safari but anywhere I try to connect.\nSomehow seems like the problem is in making the connection while within a call. And that sucks. But I've never could solve it. I could never connect to the carrier internet if I didn't connect soon before entering any call.\nWhile wifi obviously works all the time.\nBut if everything was working fine before and now it isn't anymore, as hobs said, the last thing you can do to fix it is Resetting the Network Settings.\n\nA: \"GPRS and EDGE will fail at offering both voice and data, and it might be that you initiated the call on an EDGE network\"\nTrue, if the network and the device do not support DTM (Dual Transfer Mode, look it up from Wikipedia). For example, Vodafone network in the UK does support this feature, which works with several devices (phones). I guess iPhone is not one of them, though.\n", "Q: Keynote stretch line animation Is it possible in keynote 09 to stretch a line through an animation without making it more broadly?\n\nA: I would do the animation of the line as a Magic Move. To do that, start with the line on a slide. In the Slide Navigator, duplicate the slide. On the second slide, adjust the length of the line (and position if you wish). Select the first slide in the Slide Navigator and apply the Magic Move transition.\nI like using Magic Moves for things like this because it makes it easier to deal with multiple elements on the slide.\n\nA: If the line ends at the edge of the screen, easy: make the line the full width needed, put most of it off-screen and animate in with a move.\nIf the line doesn't go all the way to the edge, you'll need to do a similar thing, but with some fakery. Remove the line and take a screenshot of the area between where the line starts and the edge of the screen. Make the line the full width needed and replace to where it should be initially, leaving the tail trailing off-screen. Then, put the screenshot of the background back on the slide atop the line to hide the line's tail.\nIf you have other animating objects over where the line's tail is, make sure the line and the fake background are below them so they don't intermittently disappear. With many objects it can be tricky, but definitely doable!\n\nA: Add the line as you want it to be at the end of the animation. Then add a square which is the same color as the slide background. Arrange the square over top of the line so that it is no longer visible. Use a wipe, build out animation on the square to make the line gradually appear beneath it. This creates the illusion that the line is growing. \n", "Q: How to browse iPod from terminal How should I use the terminal to browse and manage my iPod Touch? I mean is there any way to do this just with terminal, not with installing MobileTerminal or something like that, or sshing into the iPod.\n\nA: Enable disk mode, then in terminal\n$ cd /Volumes\n\nthen:\n$ ls\n\nand then cd into the directory that's your iPod.\nFrom there, you can use ls and cd to browse your iPod from Terminal. \n\nA: The free iPhone Explorer makes a drag-and-drop interface GUI interface to the iPod.  From the image below shows a path to the device so, once it's mounted, the terminal should be able to find it there (I don't have an iPod to test this.)\n\n\nA: It depends on the iPod's version. If you have the older iPods with \"Disk Mode\" then yes, they can be mounted like an external drive, and then you can see the hidden files and folders containing your music library.\nIf it is an iPod touch, you will need to jailbreak it to achieve this as far as I know.\n\nA: The answer by @hobs suggest you ssh to the iPod, but you state in your question you do not want to do this. The alternative would be to install sshfuse locally, and then use ssh to mount the iPod. You can now just cd to it somewhere on your local filesystem.\nThere are also other add-ons for the jailbroken iPod that will let you mount it locally. Browse the 'highlighted' apps section in Cydia.\n\nA: iPhoneDisk is a free application which will mount an iOS device as if it were a hard drive. You can then use Terminal to access it through /Volumes. iPhoneDisk requires you to install MacFuse to work. It will even work with a non-jailbroken iPod, although you won't be able to access the full filesystem in this case.\n\nA: For that and much more I always recommend iExplorer from Macroplant:\nhttp://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/\nPerfect tool to do anything you want.

I tried several programs to convert a SWF file to a video format and so far none of them seems to work.\n4media Converter\nVideo xConverter\nPinguin\nffmpegx\nEasy WMV \n\nI expect a video in any format that I could play in iOS, like .MOV, .AVI and other. Any ideas?\n\nA: Because the video is buried inside a full SWF file you won't be able to convert it -- it's much like if you had a Mac app that happens to play a built-in video: you're effectively trying to convert the app to a video, two very different kinds of things.\nInstead you'll need to extract the video. You can use a task-specific extrator, and since you asked for a free way to do it, I suggest the Flaex app. There are a couple of other paid extractors for the Mac including Flash Decompiler and SWF Decompiler. I don't have first-hand experience with any of the extractors so I can't specifically recommend one. \nThe other possible not-free way to extract the video is by opening the swf file with the full Adobe Flash Pro, or have someone do it for you. Note that Adobe provides a fully-functional 30-day trial, so at least in the short-term it's a free option as well.\n\nA: Give Handbrake a try.\n\nA: You can jailbreak your iPhone (free), then download Cydia (free), from cydia download OpeniBoot (free), and using OpeniBoot you can install Android 2.2 (Froyo) which has flash player on it. Unfortunately, this upgrade only works on the first gen iPhone, iPhone 3G, and 1st gen iPod Touch.\nThat's probably your best free bet out there.\nHowever, if you on the other hand have video, not an animation, most conversion apps (VisualHub, etc.) will do the trick.\n\nA: Are these videos from the internet? DownloadHelper (Firefox add-on) normally gives you options on the downloads, and there is usually a non-flash version in there.\nEdit:Have you tried EasyWMV?\nEdit2: FlashVideo Converter might do the job.\n\nA: I suggest you try Adapter. It is free and claims it will convert any format to any other format.

This would help me make an informed decision about which route to take.\n\nA: There are actually three options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual boot with Boot Camp.\n\n*VM using Parallels, VMware or VirtualBox.\n\n*VM using Parallels or VMware running the Boot Camp Windows installation.\nThe third gives you the advantages of the first two, i.e. you can make the decision which option to use every day or hour whenever you want. The second option also has three sub-options: you can run Windows fullscreen, in a window, or combined with Mac OS.\nNow, generally the first option is ideal when\na) You really want to use Windows, not Mac OS, but thought that Mac hardware is nice and that Mac OS is a good extra.\nb) You really want to use Windows sometimes.\nc) You want to run games or other programs that want direct hardware access via the OS only.\nd) You fear that system resources are not enough to run both Mac OS and Windows at the same time.\nThe second option is ideal under these circumstances:\na) You really want to use Mac OS all the time and only need Windows sometimes.\nb) Or for specific applications occasionally.\nc) Or for specific applications all the time (for example Microsoft Access or some such Windows-only application).\nFor all three running Windows in fullscreen mode will work, for a) and c) running Windows in a window is good too, and for c) running Windows in combined mode (called \"Coherence\" or some such thing depending on VM product) can be quite good*.\n(*I run Powershell a lot because I use it at work and need to study all the time and Powershell is the only Windows program I run all the time. Hence I like the fact that using Parallels it is the only Windows window I see on my desktop.)\nThe third option is ideal if you really want two computers in one, leading to combinations of all reasons above. I use Windows 7 and Lion with Boot Camp and Parallels myself.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: There are many \"fans\" of both approaches, and I could write a pages-long essay here about all the differences, but it really boils down to performance (Boot Camp) vs. convenience (virtualization, which I'm going to call by its numeronym \"v12n\" for brevity).\nThe v12n apps have been excellent since Apple migrated from PowerPC to Intel, and they get better every year.  You will probably find that v12n is enough to handle Visual Studio, and you will love the convenience of not having to reboot, being able to run Windows seamlessly in full-screen mode, and still having easy access to the \"Mac\" side of your computer if/when you need it.\nI'd recommend trying v12n first because it's relatively easy to do.  Both Parallels and VMWare offer trial versions of their software, so it would only be a matter of an afternoon to try both and see which would be best for you, if either.\nBoot Camp requires repartitioning your HDD, so it's definitely more involved, and not as easy to remove if you find it's not for you.  In your case, use Boot Camp if any of these apply...\n\n\n*\n\n*You prefer the Windows environment over Mac OS X and won't need/want to boot into OS X\n\n*Your VS development will require messing with hardware drivers (tough to do with v12n)\n\n*Your VS development requires accurate performance benchmarks (have to run natively)\n\n*You find that v12n has quirks that you cannot tolerate\n\n\nA: The biggest pro of VMWare/Parallels is that you don't have to reboot to switch into Windows. I'm a web developer and I have a similar setup - Mac Pro running 10.6 with Windows 7 in Parallels. This lets me use all my favorite Mac development tools (Espresso, CSSEdit, etc.) and then test in IE6/7/8/9/10 at the same time. No way would I want to reboot every time I want to test something in IE!\nThe biggest pro of Boot Camp, on the other hand, is that it's free. All you need is your copy of Windows.\n", "Q: Mac Pro fan makes constant noise. Why? I have a 2009 octocore Mac Pro. A few weeks ago it started making a constant noise. It sounds like a fan. The computer is not particularly hot. I checked with Temperature Monitor and CPUs/disks/etc. are around 40C. Only the Northbridge chip and sink are at 73C and 65C.\nIs there anything obvious that my Mac needs or that might have caused the fan to get so loud?\n\nA: In this Apple support article, Apple says that resetting the SMC can fix fans that are constantly spinning for no reason.\n\nAfter performing normal\n  troubleshooting, these symptoms may\n  indicate that an SMC reset may be\n  necessary:\nFans The computer's fans run at high speed although the computer is\n  not experiencing heavy usage and is\n  properly ventilated....\n\nHere's what it says about how to reset the SMC on a Mac Pro:\n\nShut down the computer.Unplug the\n  computer's power cord. Wait fifteen\n  seconds. Attach the computer's power\n  cord. Press the power button to turn\n  on the computer.\n\n\nA: I don't know if this was really the solution but it seemed to work.\nI opened the computer, took out the CPU board and blew the dust off it and the fans and the entire computer. Apparently that did it. Maybe I should do that once a year. The last time I cleaned the computer was last year when I put more memory in.\n\nA: Also, I would verify that this is not the issue: http://macsaregreat.com/?p=63\nI had an older Mac Pro that was constantly running its fan, and it turned out it was just a dusty graphics card.  YMMV\n\nA: I had the same problem... fan running constantly in a Mac Pro. I checked all sorts of stuff, including looking into the housing. It was more or less dust free. The I realised that the graphics card (ATI Radeon 1900, I think?) had it's own fan BUT the intake to that fan was absolutely covered in dust! A solid wall of dust (even though, every 6mos or so I'd wave the vacuum around the computer).\nOnce I pried off that layer of compacted dust from the graphics card fan, the machine is running silently!\n\nA: You can try resetting the PRAM. \nThere's more info on the Apple support boards , including further steps you can take if this doesn't work. Also, there's a thread about what settings will be nuked when you reset the PRAM. \n\nA: After reading the responses I used my compressor to blow the dust out of my 2008 Mac Pro and it solved the whistling problem.  I was also amazed by the about of dust the housing had gathered over the years.  Thanks to all who posted responses to this question.\n\nA: I'm a bit scared to admit this, but here goes…\nWe have a bunch of Mac Pro's in office. One of them (in a rather quiet room no less) started making a persistent high frequency continual buzz. It was definitely a moving components, because shutting the computer down would stop the sound. Tracing the sound eventually led me to the video card. Despite how low it was spinning, the video card fan was spinning nevertheless. When I would press my finger onto the middle of the fan (forcing it to stop spinning), the sound went away.\nAt that time the computer was highly highly mission critical, so downtime more than a few minutes was not a good idea. The Apple Store had none of our video cards in stock, and they were unwilling to take my word on the diagnosis and order it.\nSo, I engineered a 0.01¢ fix. I took a piece of scotch tape, and stretched it across both sides of the fan (the fan is raised with a plastic housing), and smoothed down the middle on the fan's plastic. The fan stopped spinning, and the sound disappeared. The office was quiet again.\nNote that this is probably a TERRIBLE IDEA, because it restricts air flow across the video card which is a very hot device anymore. I honestly don't suggest this fix.\nBut, what I am saying is that you should check out your video card fans, and you can temporarily stop it to see if it resolves the audible issue.\nAnd really, you can try this with every fan, not just the video card fan. Do be careful, however. Despite being plastic, some of these fan blades can hurt.\n\nA: resetting the SMC worked for me.\n\nA: Here is the answer after 3 years of noisy fan issues, My first solution was to replace the front fan in my Mac Pro Quad - this failed and was not the issue - second method was to pull the main board battery off the Motherboard, this worked but is very dangerous and if not done properly can damage the motherboard - the third solution is simple switch the machine off, pull out the power lead for 15 seconds, replug and wait 5 seconds, start machine, PROBLEM SOLVED. The problem is caused by the Pram remembering an incorrect command, resetting pram does not help, what is needed is to remove the power to the top level of the PRAM. My gut feeling is that it is an intel conflict with large volumes of ram but it is easily silenced.\n", "Q: Airtunes is giving me dropouts I got an Airport Express to use to wirelessly extend my existing Airport Extreme (which is plugged into my cable modem). I'm also using the Airport Express to send music to the stereo. Unfortunately I'm getting audio dropouts. \nHow do I track these down? Could I save the Express some work by running an ethernet cable between the two units? Are there any other settings that specifically affect Airtunes? \n\nA: I had this problem several months ago and was able to solve it by disabling the built-in iTunes equalizer.  Just uncheck the \"On\" box.\nNot guaranteed to work for you since there are so many factors that could be affecting it, but it worked for me.  Hope it helps!\n\n\nEDIT:  A couple more notes...  I have a pre-N Airport Express (circa 2008) wirelessly \"attached\" to a Time Capsule base station (essentially an Airport Extreme with a HDD built-in).  Before, when I was having this problem, I had my Express extending my wireless network.  During the course of correcting this problem, I changed it to simply join my network and NOT extend it.  I'm not sure if this contributed to the solution, but I just wanted to mention it in case it turns out to be significant.\n\nA: The real problem is the protocol between the Mac/iTunes and AirTunes. For some reason known only to Apple there is very little buffering in the AirTunes and any interruptions at all will cause the input buffer on the AirTunes to be emptied. The answer is to minimise interruption to the flow of data to the AirTunes device:\n\n\n*\n\n*Avoid WiFi anywhere in the setup.\n\n*Connect iTunes Mac to your router/hub as well as the AirTunes both via Ethernet cable.\n\n*Only have  iTunes on your mac running, close Chrome, Word, etc.\n\n*By all means COMPLAIN TO APPLE, this product is a disgrace\nI have 3 different generation airtunes running on various networks and ALL exhibit this problem. I have tried every \"fix\" documented on the various forums. I am an IT professional.\nOut of desperation, I also tried using an Apple TV connected to a DAC via optical cable. Guess what? Same problem!\n\nA: Running Apple Maintenance seems to have taken care of the problem, at least for the time being. From the info text for v.3.8:\n\nAbout Maintenance\nA simple Automator Action fused with AppleScript aimed at keeping your Mac running healthy. \nFeatures include: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*List item\n  \n*Repair Permissions \n  \n*Verify Preferences \n  \n*Update Prebindings \n  \n*Periodic Clean-up \n  \n*Clean Cache \n  \n*Update Locate, Whatis, LaunchServices Databases \n  \n*Rebuild Spotlight Index \n  \n*Force Empty Trash Tiger users please use Maintenance 3.7 which is\n  bundled with 3.8\n  \n  \n  What’s New in this Version\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*New Action: Rebuild Spotlight Index \n  \n*New Action: Force Empty Trash\n  \n\nIf the dropouts return and running the program doesn't take care of the problem, will de-select this as the answer.  \n\nA: I bit of a work-around. But Airfoil is the best $25 I've spent, when it comes to streaming audio with the Airport express.  And you're not limited to just airtunes.  it's amazing.  try it. I've never had any problems in more than three years of use. \n\nA: It looks like you have solved your networking issue, but to answer the question clearly - AirPlay will work over any network connection.\nWired connections are far less susceptible to interference, packet loss and pauses - so if you can't get a reliable wireless network, running a physical cable is a sure fire way to ensure you have a solid network and airplay video / audio has enough bandwidth and low delay to play seamlessly.\n", "Q: How can I keep my Macbook Pro cool and avoid fan noise? I use my MacBook pro for audio recording. With the summer coming up, the fans tend to come on more often, which can be a problem. Recording audio is fairly processor-intensive (especially when using plug-ins for monitoring), making this problem worse. This was actually less of an issue with my iMac G5 than it is with the Macbook Pro that's replacing it. \nThe obvious solution is to record in an air-conditioned room with good ventilation. However, that's not always possible. \nIt would at least be nice if I had some warning so this doesn't happen without warning in the middle of a take. How would I monitor this situation? Do the fans come on when the temperature gets to a certain point? Is it strictly related to CPU and hard drive load? Is it possible for me to install something that will let me know how long I have until the fan noise starts? \n\nI'm using a Macbook Pro 13\" 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5, with conventional hard drives (i.e., not SSDs), 8MB RAM, OSX 10.6.7\n\nA: Fan speeds are related to the temperature of your laptop.  If you're just interested in monitoring the temps, iStat Menus ($16) has an excellent temperature monitor that sits in your menu bar and can track any of the dozen temperature sensors built into your MBP.\n\nThere are a few apps which purport to allow you to control your Apple laptop fan speeds.\nEDIT: Updated Aug 2018\n\n\n*\n\n*Macs Fan Control -- $15, last updated Mar 2018\n\n*smcFanControl -- Free, last updated Oct 2016, many users report that they can set fan speeds high, but not low\n\n\nI've found that the best solution to keeping my computer cool and the fans off, even when really tasking the processor, is to put it on a little stand to allow plenty of airflow underneath.  The one I swear by is a Podium Pad from 2004 which was discontinued long ago -- but there are many alternatives.  If you keep your laptop on your lap, almost any simple lap desk can help a lot, keeping the computer on a firm surface to let the fans do their work without smothering them with fabric/skin.  There are also active cooling pads with fans in them, some of which are very well-reviewed.\nFinally, I'm not sure what you're recording, but you could try using a directional USB microphone to eliminate extraneous noise from your recording environment.  There are many excellent options on Amazon for under $100 (be sure it is Mac-compatible before purchasing).\n\nA: I used to have that problem and a mix of a good laptop stand (I use a Griffin elevator stand to make sure it's not sitting directly on a heat-retaining desk) and keep an eye on iStat. \nIf you can access those stats somehow, you might be able to create your own script to pop a silent notification (Growl or otherwise) when it hits a certain temperature at which the fans are likely to launch into rocket-takeoff mode?\n\nA: Use Ice.\nIf you don't know what I mean, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VblFBTDw8U\n", "Q: Saving .htacess passwords on iPad I know it is possible to save form username/passwords on the iPad's Safari browser. The thing I can't do is to save .htaccess username and passwords. In case you don't know what those are, it's when a webpage is protected and you can't even see the page without authenticating. It usually displays a popup window so you can authenticate.\nIs it possible to save this type of credentials?\n\nA: This is HTTP Authentication and the iPad cannot \"remember\" the credentials of these sorts of logins.  It has no problems with a normal web form however.\nIf you are happy to have your username and password stored in plain text on a bookmark in Safari however, there is a way to allow you to login without filling out those details again.\nJust visit the site with the following formatted url :\nhttp://username:password@domain.com/\n\nRememer to change the 3 obvious variables (username, password and domain).  This should log you straight in.  You can save this as a book mark and then use that going forward.\nThe username and password must be URL encoded if they contain any special characters.\nJust remember that anyone who picks up your iPad could view the bookmarks and see the clear text username and password, so I wouldn't use this on your banks website :)\nHope this helps.\n\nA: For a more secure solution, I'd suggest 1Password for iPad. It has many useful features, not the least of which are auto-generation of strong passwords (so you can use a different password on each site) and strong encryption of your passwords. You can use 1Password with HTTP Authentication.\n", "Q: Is it possible restore or update your iphone if you only have tethered internet? I totally bricked my iphone for a couple of days last time I tried to upgrade my OS.\nI didn't realize that upgrading the OS requires access to Apple during the installation process. I only have wireless Internet that is tethered from my iPhone.\nSo last time I tried to upgrade, I downloaded the OS, then proceeded to run the installation, which  shuts down my iPhone in order to install files. After that though, it requires some sort of verification from apple.com and because my iPhone is already shut down, i have no Internet access.\nI ended up having to go to a friend's house to the install cos she has WiFi.\nSo is it possible to upgrade with tethered internet? Is there an option where you can do the verification before re-installing. It just seems strange cause although it may be rare to only have wireless internet, I'm sure I'm not the only person to have ever encountered this, and there was never a warning message that it couldn't be done before the installation.\n\nA: As you said, yes, you do need to have a connection to download and verify the install, not just the download. Its the computer doing the update that needs an internet connection - not really the phone. \nIn your case, the phone is currently in the update, which is probably running a very 'light' iOS bootstrap while your computer does the update. OS features like tethering would not be running then (nor anything much really), and so your computer would not recognize it as a connection, and the iPhone can't really do the verification in its state at that point either. \nThe only way you could really do the update with tethered internet is to have another iPhone that you are tethered to. \n\nA: Yes. Before you upgrade, back up your SHSH blobs (the thing that apple uses to verify) with The Firmware Umbrella. After backing up, start the local TSS server using TinyUmbrella (remember to run as admin) so that iTunes will connect locally and grab the SHSH blobs, not requiring any Internet connection.\n", "Q: When do the Macbook Pro fans turn on? As a complement to this question about keeping the Mac cool so the fans don't get triggered: \nAt what temperature does the mac turn on the fans? I know that a high CPU load can cause the fans to go on, so it's not just temperature-based. Are there specific processor temperatures that trigger the fans to spin up? \n(I've got iStat installed, so I can monitor the internal sensors for high temperatures. I now need to know what temperatures to avoid.) \nMy Mac is a Macbook Pro 13\" 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5. \n\nA: The short answer: We can't tell you exactly.\nThe algorithm that controls this is sure to be Apple-proprietary. I'm sure they've spent lots of work perfecting it, so they wouldn't share it for other hardware manufacturers to 'take'.\nBasically, Apple's algorithm tries to strike a balance between not turning on the fan when unnecessary, like for a short spike in load, (so the computer is quieter and the battery lasts longer) and not letting things get too hot. Just how hot things are allowed to get probably depends on the components in your computer, the various temperatures of those components, how well the computer is ventilated at the moment, the ambient temperature, and maybe even things like load average.\nBottom line: If the computer's doing a lot of work, the fans go on to cool it off. There's no way to say exactly what temperature triggers the fans because it varies based on a lot of things.\nSorry I can't provide anything more concrete.\n", "Q: autosave in osx lion Will it be possible to disable the Auto Save feature in OS X Lion?\n\nA: Since Lion testers are under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) it may be difficult to get a definitive answer on this here.  From my reading of what has been released so far, and reading between the lines to Apples intent on bringing iOS (and in particular the iPad) functionality/experience to the Desktop, I would say that the Applications written for Lion will use that feature, and it will not be able to be turned off.\nI say this because I think that the autosave and version system will be deep in the guts of the OS and once an application is written to use this feature, it won't be an option.\nThat's not to say that people won't find a way around it.\n", "Q: Choose a default app for opening files with no extension? Is it possible to set a default application to open files with no extension?  I'm not referring to files with hidden extensions, but those completely lacking an extension -- e.g. README, CHANGELOG, mbox, etc.\n\"Open With\" => \"Change All\" on these files doesn't work, returning the error shown below:\n\nIdeally, I would like the system to try opening all such files in TextMate.  I know I can drag files onto Dock icons to open them in specific apps, but I'm looking for a more seamless solution than that (especially since I have my Dock auto-hide, which makes it much more cumbersome).\nI am familiar with the QLStephen QuickLook plugin that can enable QuickLook for some of these files, but I would prefer a solution with selecting/copying/editing capabilities.\n\nA: You can do this using Magic Launch. After installing, you can create rules to launch based on various criteria. You need to create a rule for text apps where the extension is blank. You can set up more complex logic if you need it.\nhttp://michelf.com/software/magic-launch/\n\nA: Update for Catalina:\ndefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.3;}' '{LSHandlerContentType=public.unix-executable;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.3;}'\n\nThis sets the default to Sublime Text 3. If you want to have any other app you have to simply replace com.sublimetext.3 with the app id of your favorite app.\n\nA: You can add a default application for public.plain-text in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist.\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.apple.textedit;}' '{LSHandlerContentType=public.unix-executable;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.apple.textedit;}'\nRestart to apply the changes (logging out and back in isn't enough).\nI've added this to a duti configuration file:\ncom.apple.textedit public.plain-text all\ncom.macromates.textmate public.unix-executable all\n\n\nA: Take a look at RCDefaultApp (freeware). \n\nRCDefaultApp is a Mac OS X 10.2 or higher preference pane that allows a user to set the default application used for various URL schemes, file extensions, file types, MIME types, and Uniform Type Identifiers (or UTIs; MacOS 10.4 only). \n\n\nA: A bit late this, the question \"How to avoid typeless files opening in terminal\" being a bit old. However:\nThe solutions above involve changing the existing rules, which can have unwanted side-effects. I find the easiest is to exploit the existing rules for typeless files and changing file permissions to get the result I want.\nSpecifically: Switch off the executable bit on the file, because that's what's telling file service to open with terminal with \"chmod -x filename\" where filename is ... the filename.\nThis can be automated to some extent (with caution): In my case, I have a lot of README files on a machine. I can use \"find\" to find all \"README\" files. And then use \"awk\" to construct a command to remove the executable bit on all of them as follows:\nfind /$HOME -iname 'README' | awk '{ print \"chmod -x \" $0 }'\n\ntype that into the terminal if you want to check what files will be changed: The output will consist of a listing for each README found looking something like this:\nchmod -x //Users/jimpsmith/things/README\n\nAnd to change all those permissions execute all these lines by feeing them to bash as follows:\nfind /$HOME -iname 'README' | awk '{ print \"chmod -x \" $0 }' | bash\n\nJust beware of using wildcards too liberally and finding you're accidentally removed the executable bit from some executables that erroneously match.\n\nAn easier way would be to just run\nfind /$HOME -iname 'README' -exec chmod -x '{}' \\;`\n\nor (to see what would happen)\nfind /$HOME -iname 'README' -exec echo chmod -x '{}' \\;`\n\n", "Q: Jailbreak an officially unlocked iPhone My iPhone 3GS was unlocked using O2's official method.\nI am considering jailbreaking but am unsure if this will affect the unlock status of the handset.\nThe jailbreak options available seem a little bewildering, so is there a specific jailbreak method which doesn't unlock and will leave my iPhone with the official unlock?\nWhat I really don't want to happen is to jailbreak and have the phone lock again on the next iOS update.\nI am currently running iOS 4.3.3 and use iTunes on Windows 7 x64.\n\nA: It won't affect the unlock.  A legitimate (ie sanctioned by the carrier and not hardware/software) unlock happens at the carrier level and jailbreaking doesn't affect that.\n\nA: Follow this wizard: http://www.iclarified.com/jailbreak/iphone3gs/firmware.php\n", "Q: Exchange 2010 Sync for iPad 4.3.2 I can enter all my Exchange 2010 data and it looks like everything is fine, but my contacts, calendar, and mail are never loaded from the exchange server, and mail gives me errors (\"The connection to the mail server failed\") when trying to connect. Do I need to update iOS or change Exchange 2010 settings?\n\nA: The iOS 4.3.3 update changed the location cacheing dynamics, so Exchange wouldn't benefit in the least.\nDeleting the Exchange account and re-entering the information is a good first step, before considering a restore. Does it actually confirm a connection to your exchange server when you've entered the information? If it doesn't, then we're at good odds the iPad isn't the problem at all.\nIf the server settings are good, and you're setting up the Exchange server in the proper area of the Mail accounts area, then I would consider following with @luca590 and restore.\n\nA: You should probably back everything up on itunes and restore your Ipad. Then your contacts, calender, etc. should load up automatically.\n", "Q: Mac App Store has become dog slow after 10.6.7 update on latest MacBook Pro Ever since rolling out the 10.6.7 update on my latest MacBook Pro (15\", i7), I have found that Mac App Store has become awfully slow. Starting it alone takes anywhere from two to four minutes for the application to become functional and start responding. During that time, the application seems to get lost into the 'not responding state', with the spinning beach ball showing up. \nI looked into the output of Console.app, hoping to find any clues as to what's going on. I found a series of entries to the effect of:\n5/6/11 1:55:58 PM   [0x0-0x95c95c].com.apple.appstore[16533]    Fri May  6 13:55:58 mbp App Store[16533] <Error>: CGBitmapContextGetBitsPerComponent: invalid context 0x100610e10\n5/6/11 1:55:58 PM   [0x0-0x95c95c].com.apple.appstore[16533]    This isn't a bitmap context. Forcing destination format to ARGB_8 for CGContext.\n\nWhat is strange is that I have a late-2009 white MacBook model which is booting the same version of OS X: 10.6.7. Mac App Store loads quickly on that machine. However, in the output of Console.app on that machine, I also see similar errors. I am wondering whether these errors have anything to do with the sluggish behaviour of Mac App Store application on my MacBook Pro (clearly, it works fine from the sluggish point of view on my slower, older white MacBook). \nIf you require any specific, particular information, I'd be more than happy to provide it. I'm looking for any insights, clues as to what is going on, and what I can possibly do to fix it. \nMany thanks.\n\nA: Did you by any change change the Certificate settings in Keychain Access?\nIf so, that's the source of your problem. Go back to Keychain Access > Preferences > Certificates and turn Certificate Revocation List: off.\nThe Mac App Store should be snappy again after that.\n\nA: The App store is basically an XML parser that uses webkit to process html5/css/javascript. Focus on your network and differences between macs that work well and those that are slow. It's likely having problems getting the content from Apple's servers.\nThe usual suspects are overcomplicated or corrupt network preferences, DNS servers that are slow or misconfigured, other runaway processes or interface problems. Do check wired or wireless connection that is different than the one you usually use in case you have a hardware issue - but you should see equal issues in iTunes app store / safari as well.\nThe only obscure thing is if your installed product database was somehow corrupt and the MAS is churning trying to figure out what is already installed either locally or for your account on their server end of things.\nYou may have to sample the app or profile the network to poke deeper. If you are up to poking deeper, Daniel Jalkut stumbled upon a debug menu for the MAS app. He notes that \"nobody knows for sure what these options do, and you might do serious damage to your Mac or your App Store account by playing with them\" so I would urge caution. Looking or logging the XML or clearing cookies should be harmless.\nHave you asked Apple for support? I consider anything that prevents iTunes or MAS from working a billing issue since I want them to be able to bill me for my next purchase! \nLastly, have you verified the date is correct on the troublesome mac?\n\nA: If you use Googles DNS servers, then you will find that they direct to servers which may not be as geographically close to you as if you were using your own ISPs dns servers.  This is a known issue and affects load times of both the App Store and downloads from iTunes.\nTo determine if this is in fact the case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Mac App Store whilst using googles dns server and time how long it takes.\n\n*Change your dns servers to your isp ones and flush your dns cache in terminal using the following command dscacheutil -flushcache\n\n*open the Mac App Store and time how long it takes.  Should be significantly quicker.\n\nA: I've had exactly this problem about 10 minutes ago, on 10.6. Even the console.app logs were the same! I applied the combined upgrade, as I had an older version of 10.6, and yet the problem appeared.\nMy first idea was to upgrade not only OS X, but also Safari and apply all the other updates that Software Update suggested (except iTunes). Then the computer restarted and App Store started working properly, installing applications without freezing up.\nSo if somebody comes around with this problem, I recommend to try installing all the updates first. Let me know if that helped you also!\n", "Q: how to print or export annotations in a pdf file? I have a pdf file containing annotations from someone else (I assume they are made in windows with some Adobe software, but I'm not sure).\nThey look like that:\n\nand can be displayed in Preview.appor Skim.appon the left of each page:\n\nHowever, I'd like to print them (together with the pages) and/or find a way to export them to a text document.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: This is probably too late but I think I know the answer, so maybe it'll help someone. What you probably want to do is\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert notes to skim notes\n\n*Go to File > Export > choose File format either Notes as RTF or Notes as text.\n\n\nThis answers your 'export to text document' questions. I don't see how you could print the PDF together with the text in the anchored notes, though.\n\nA: Skim has a \"Take Snapshot\" feature which allows you to print anything which is visually on the page. It also has a \"Convert Notes\" feature which turns PDF annotations into \"skim notes\" which you can then manipulate.\nAll of this is under the File Menu:\n\n\nA: I just ran into this problem using Mac OS 10.14.6\nLoading in Preview with annotations and saving as PDF still left the annotations invisible in Chrome's PDF viewer.\nSo I did \"Save as Postscript\", then loaded the .ps file in Preview, and did \"Save as PDF\", and the annotations showed in Chrome.\n\nA: There is a really simple yet robust tool for extracting highlights, notes and images from your pdf-files available at: http://www.sumnotes.net . Not only it supports various advanced features like exporting to DOC and TXT formats, but it also allows you to send extracted highlights into your Evernote account or email. All desktop browsers and operating systems are supported. We are in cloud, so no installation is needed. Try it out.\n\nA: I faced the same problem. To resolve it I created a free service to extract annotations from PDF to CSV: http://exportpdf.info . It exports only sticky and text notes, it does not export highlights and images. You can edit/print CSV files with any major editor like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.\n", "Q: Can you force applications to open in full screen? Is there a way, like an app or a system preference, that will open applications in full screen, all the time. By full screen I mean taking up all the screen real estate. I know it doesn't match apple user interface guidelines but I have a friend for whom it would make life easier. \n\nA: Currently, no. Through the Macs history (as you pointed out with the HIG), Macs have had a 'zoom' feature versus a maximize one like Windows. Many times this will make the window full screen, but not always. \nWith Mac OS 10.7 due out this summer, having a full screen application is one of the new features, where the application will take up everything on the screen. Since 10.7 is still under NDA, not sure if there will be a way to have the application always launch full screen or not.\n", "Q: iPod touch syncs to my new computer correctly - apart from my Apps. How to fix? I have a 4th generation iPod touch.\nI used to sync it with my old Windows computer and everything worked fine.\nI then switched to a Mac, and followed a procedure for porting my iTunes library over.\nThe procedure was something like: Consolidate library, export library. Copy the generated file over and iTunes Music folder to a temporary folder. Update the file paths. Import the file onto the new, and let the Mac iTunes reorganise it in its new structure.\nThis worked fine, except that it didn't copy my apps across. When I selected \"sync with this computer\" the first time I plugged in my iPod to the Mac it seemed to work, except then I noticed that it wasn't syncing any apps. Those I bought on my iPod aren't snced to my Mac, and vice-versa,\nIs there any way to force my apps to sync from my iPod to my Mac? (Preferably keeping save data).\nThey both use the same iTunes account.\nThe iPod is jailbroken, in case theres a Cydia app I can use to achieve this.\nEDIT: Just to clarify, the rest of the iPod data - music, videos, iBook books, etc. sync fine.\n\nA: Try going to the App store on the iPod and purchasing a free app.  It will ask you for your App Store account credentials.  Once this works, try syncing again.   It should then move across all the apps.  Make sure that Syncing apps is ticked in iTunes too (by default it is but check anyway).\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Try copying your iTunes data from the PC and then move it to the Mac. Then authorize the Mac with your iTunes credentials.\n", "Q: Backing up Bento for iPhone I've been looking at using Bento for iPhone / iPad on a few projects where data will be logged in the field and then synced with a main database held on a Mac. My worry with this system though is that if there is a problem when the Bento database syncs with the Mac and the databse gets corrupted, there may be a complete loss of data. Ideally I'd like to, for instance, email the data from the iPhone / iPad before the data is synced so that even if the databse is lost, at least we have the data and can manually enter the data onto the main databse on the Mac. I have not yet however found out any way of getting the Bento data off the iPhone apart from syncing with a Mac. Does anyone know of any other fix for this?  \n\nA: Bento has no capabilities to sync over the network, no printing (you can print documents attached/embedded in a record but not the actual record itself). It was designed to be totally simple. That makes it the wrong tool for protect data to the extent of allowing backups or export/import like you ask.\nThe API are there to use MobileMe syncing on both the mac and the iOS - but the engineering wasn't done to make that work in the Bento universe. There are many solutions that will work at greater (but still affordable) cost, though.\nIn your case Filemaker Go connecting to a database that is served with FileMaker Pro will ensure your field data is always syncing to and from a central server as long as the network allows connectivity.\nHere is a nice summary of how Bento and Filemaker Go compare. Bento has been very reliable for me and I haven't heard of anyone losing data, but user error or a lost phone before you return to sync will clearly cause lost data.\nThere are many note taking apps that sync off device to a server (Simplenote is the one I use) and even more GTD / Task Management type apps (like Things or Todolicious or the big kahuna OmniFocus) that you might be able to leverage to avoid losing data via sync services. \nIn the end - FileMaker Go + Pro is orders of magnitude cheaper than custom app developmen,t not to mention ridiculously faster to implement. If the cost of losing one set of data exceeds easily calculated FileMaker deployment costs, then your decision is trivial to make. Don't forget to estimate the cost of going back to recreate the data.\n", "Q: Why does iOS remove aps from folders upon update? Has anyone else seen the issue where apps are removed from their folders when you do a mass update from the App Store? I've seen it with my iPhone 4 and my original iPad. It only seems to happen when it's the most inconvenient lol...like updating 20+ apps at once. I don't think it's a jailbreak issue; I don't even have Winterboard installed on either device. \nI just wanna know if anyone else has seen this behavior, or knows why it happens.\nThanks!\n\nA: I've seen similar issues on both my iPad and iPhone, so it is possible they may be in some way related, though my problem can occur with one app update or many.\nI run into apps jumping out of their folders most when one app in particular has problems downloading or installing. (For example, I will often see an app in a perpetually installing state.) The only way to fix this reliably is to Respring or reboot, and that's when my apps jump out of their folders.\nI'm not sure it has anything to do with being jailbroken, because I have seen similar behavior on my iDevices when I couldn't jailbreak them (though not as often). I suspect when an install or download goes awry and Springboard is restarted, it simply resets things on that app and treats it like a new install (which would explain why mine always end up after all the other icons and never intermixed). \nA similar phenomenon is purely jailbreak related. If you have folder enhancers on your device (say, Infinifolder), and your device has to go to Safe Mode (or something else freaky happens), iOS puts the apps into a very funny order, and often out of folders. I think this is because the folder enhancers don't quite correctly keep iOS's own map of where things are up-to-date (and can't in some cases, especially if you have a folder in a folder or more than 12 or so apps in a folder), and iOS has to figure out somewhere to put them.\nDefinitely weird, odd, and even annoying (especially when all your apps jump folders and your well-ordered screens have to be rebuilt. sigh.)\n", "Q: Can I automate location changing so I don't have to drive the choice manually? Wondering is anyone knows of an application that can change settings on my Macbook Pro depending on the wireless networks it detects?\nIe, If I was at work, connect to the Work Wireless, Change default printer, chance location, change wallpaper etc. \nI seem to remember seeing an app at one stage, however after much Googling I cannot find it. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: AirPort Location** takes snapshots of the system settings you select and re-applies them the next time you use your machine at that location.\n** Update Oct 2016: Airport location appears to be no longer maintained, but still available at [MacUpdate.com][2]. It may be limited to older versions of OS-X. The same site suggests [ControlPlane][3] provides similar functionality; I have not used it.\n\nA: ControlPanel is an actively maintained, advanced fork of MarcoPolo that works on Mountain Lion. It supports using your GPS location as well as many other factors in determining what various settings should be. I am actually surprised these features haven't been built into the core OS. The source code is on GitHub.\nFrom the site:\n\nControlPlane supports multiple contexts where a context is defined as\n  a location or activity you are performing.  Using evidence sources you\n  can create a set of rules that tell ControlPlane what context to apply\n  to your environment.  When ControlPlane enters or leaves a context a\n  set of Actions are performed.\n\n\nA: Are you thinking of MarcoPolo?  It can infer your location from a variety of things (visible wireless networks are one of its \"evidence sources\"), and adjust settings based on what it finds.\n\nA: There is one more alternative: Locader, right now it changes wallpaper only, but in the future more location based functions will be available.\nYou can set different places, and when you're there, wallpaper will be changed to the one, that you selected.\n", "Q: Codebox, or another code library manager? Since I have Papers for all my documents, iTunes for my music/videos I'm only missing a good \"code library manager/snippet manager\" for all my pieces of code (especially for small projects or test code, as the bigger ones are easy to archives but little piece of code usually get more or less lost).\nSo I found Code box but there's no trial version available. I looks like it has the features I want, so something like Paper but for code.\nMy question is: is it worth buying it ? Would you recommend another one I could test first ?\n\nA: You might also consider http://www.mcubedsw.com/software/codecollectorpro.\n\nA: Have you seen Snippets?  It's very comprehensive, easy to use and has a 30 day trial.\n\nA: Try Snipper App. It's a native MacOS snippets manager with modern, lightweight GUI, syntax highlighting, and Markdown support.\n", "Q: How do I clean the apple mouse so that it can scroll down? My current apple mouse works fine for moving, clicking and scrolling down.  The scrolling functionality with the tiny ball on top is not working while going down.  I had the same issue back in 2008 at a different company with a similar mouse.  Does anyone know how I can clean the mouse?\n\nA: My favorite movie on Apple’s support site is this gem on cleaning mouse balls! I also like using a clean white piece of paper to roll the mouse upside down on it. Do use the grey cloth if you'd rather not see what comes out.\nThe general cleaning info is nice too.\n\nA: I have also suffered with the \"Dirty Mouse Ball\" problem with the Mighty Mouse.  To get it working again, I would hold it upside-down and spin the ball quickly in many directions.  \nThis worked the first few times, but later, I found it was not doing the job.  I then started using a barely damp microfiber cloth while holding it upside down and rolling the little ball around as much as possible.  This seemed to work a little better.\nEventually, I found myself having to clean the thing multiple times a week and got tired of it.  I replaced it with a Logitech mouse and then later the Magic Mouse and Track pad and I don't miss the little ball at all. \nUltimately, I suggest that you just replace the Might Mouse, even if you have to go with a non-Apple product.  Otherwise, I think you will find yourself spending more time fighting the ball than using it.\n\nA: I'm assuming this the Apple Mighty Mouse - a nice mouse to use until it gets dirty. I had several before I move them all to the Magic Mouse. \nAnyway, easiest way I found to clean them was to turn it upside down and put a sheet of paper on the table. With a light pressure, move the mouse all around the paper sheet for about 30 seconds - this seems to shift some of the finer bits of dirt out of the ball area.\nFor more serious bits of dirt that may be lodged or a longer lasting solution, you'll have to open it up - it's a bit tricky but there are guides out there - google for them  - personally - I'd just upgrade to a better mouse.\nIf you do have AppleCare with the Mac you got the mouse with - Apple should fix/replace it for you.\n\nA: Here's a video of the process.\n\nA: It is not difficult to disassemble and clean the 'finger crud' from the mouse if you can deal with some small parts. If it's not working you can't make it much worse and the first time you do it could take from 30 to 60 minutes. \nBreak the ring bezel (just below the side buttons) loose by wedging a knife blade between it and the top. Towards the rear of the mouse you will see the pivot pins on each side. Prying near one of these will separate the top from the bottom. The 2 ribbon cables can be freed by prying up both sides of the black locks. Remove the 3 screws that retain the ball cage. At this point you may want to take a picture of how the 4 magnet shafts are laid out in the cage to aid in reassembly. An old toothbrush and some rubbing alcohol will clean the crud from the ball cage and magnet shafts and ball. Getting the shafts and ball assembly put back together with tweezers is the worst part and is not too bad. Complete the reassembly and a small piece of tape at the front and rear to hold the ring bezel to the top should leave you in good shape and not $50 poorer for having bought a new one.

The US Supreme Court ruled that \n\nnothing in the agreement prevents you\n  from making copies of DVDs. Nothing\n  requires that a DVD be present during\n  playback.\n\nSo yes, it is legal. source\n\nA: Actually, it's pretty straight forward.\n\n\nA: I would recommend the program RipIt by the little app factory if by official you mean a commercially available and supported software to accomplish the task of ripping a commercial DVD into a format that will work with iTunes to play DVD content on iOS. There are free solutions, but I prefer paying for an interface and a manual and most of all, support and someone paid to develop new fixes to the ripping software when new discs come out with different tricks to prevent ripping. (It's a game of cat and mouse between the movie studios and the rippers unfortunately.)\nThe company is very responsive in supporting its customers and has been around for some time. Well worth the money for the time and aggravation it saves me. Their passport bundle is a great value if you will use more than two of their products.\nIf you want legal advice whether doing this is wise, do check with a local lawyer.\n\nA: The best, and also a very legal, way to go would be Handbrake (as styfle says), however many DVDs come now with a digital copy, where you get a code which can be used to download a copy for iTunes (full DRM so only in iTunes), from there you can sync it to your iPhone. This method is probably easier for a non-techie (although Handbrake is pretty simple), but it's a lot more restricting.\n", "Q: How to prevent ssh from adding my key to ssh-agent on Snow Leopard? I recently started using Snow Leopard (after using Leopard for a few years), and I noticed that when I ssh using a passphrase-protected private key, ssh will automatically add the key to ssh-agent. Question 1: How do I prevent ssh from behaving this way (doing the auto-add)?\nI am not looking to disable the auto-launching of ssh-agent. I actually use it, but I want keys to be added manually (via ssh-add), not automatically.\nMy current workaround:\nI've edited /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist to run with the argument \"-t 1\" and that works well. But I'm afraid that some software update will revert it.\nQuestion 2: If I put the modified plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ will the one in /System be ignored for my user? This would qualify as a stable workaround.\n\nA: Automatically Added Keys\nThere are three ways SSH keys are added to ssh-agent in Snow\nLeopard.\n\n*\n\n*manually, with ssh-add,\n\n*automatically, by ssh when you supply a key’s passphrase via\nthe GUI prompt, and\n\n*automatically, by ssh-agent when it first starts.\n\nThe last two methods are Apple extensions: there are no “automatic”\nadditions with stock OpenSSH. All references to ssh, ssh-agent,\nand ssh-add below are to Apple’s Snow Leopard versions unless\nI prefix the program name with the adjective “stock”.\nYou can disable all of Apple’s keychain-oriented SSH modifications\nwith a (undocumented?) preference setting:\ndefaults write org.openbsd.openssh KeychainIntegration -bool false\n\nKeys Added Automatically By ssh\n(This is the part I missed in the previous version of my original\nanswer since I usually use a “stock” ssh.)\nWhenever ssh tries to use a passphrase protected SSH key to\nauthenticate itself to a remote host, it will issue a GUI prompt for\nthe SSH key’s password. The key is also loaded into the agent (if\nthe passphrase is correct) whether or not you mark the “Remember\npassword in my keychain” checkbox.\nThere are two (undocumented?) ways to prevent ssh from issuing\nthis GUI prompt (and thus adding the SSH key to the ssh-agent):\n\n*\n\n*A preference setting:\n  defaults write org.openbsd.openssh AskPassGUI -bool false\n\n\n\n*An\nssh_config\nentry (or -o option to ssh) that specifies AskPassGUI no.\n(see keychain_read_passphrase in\nkeychain.c;\nthe oAskPassGUI parameter comes from the AskPassGUI\nconfiguration setting)\nWhen AskPassGUI is disabled, ssh will prompt you in the normal\nway for the key’s password (i.e. through the tty).\nYou could also avoid automatic adds from ssh by using a “stock”\nssh (e.g. OpenSSH compiled by\nMacPorts,\nHomebrew “duplicates” from\nhomebrew-alt, or\nFink).\nKeys Added Automatically By ssh-agent\nThe keys that ssh-agent automatically adds are those that have\ntheir passphrases stored in a keychain.\nThese “remembered keys” are automatically added when a new\nssh-agent starts.\nThere is no command line or configuration option (other than\nKeychainIntegration, described above) to prevent ssh-agent from\nautomatically loading the “remembered keys” (see the call to\nprocess_add_from_keychain (defined in\nkeychain.c) from main in\nssh-agent.c).\nIf, however, you can arrange to lock the keychains that store your\nSSH key passphrases, you can click Cancel when ssh-agent asks to\nunlock the keychain(s) and effectively get ssh-agent to skip\nadding these “remembered keys” when it first starts.\nIf there is no ssh-agent running, your first use of ssh will\nlikely trigger launchd to start an ssh-agent which will load all\nthe “remembered keys”. This makes it seem like ssh is loading the\nkeys into the agent, but it is really the agent itself that is\nloading the keys. It only does this automatically when it first\nstarts.\nThe -k option of ssh-add provides a manual way to add the\n“remembered keys” (see add_from_keychain in\nssh-add.c\nwhich ends up as a message to the agent which calls\nprocess_add_from_keychain from process_message in\nssh-agent.c).\nlaunchd Configuration\nYou are right that a system update could overwrite your modification to the file in /System/Library/LaunchAgents/. You should always avoid changing things under /System/; most things can be (re)configured without making changes there. In this case, it looks like you should be able to override the system default launchd job specification on a per-user basis with a file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/.\nFrom what I can tell1, entries are loaded in this order2:\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/LaunchAgents/\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents/\n\n*/Network/Library/LaunchAgents/ (not present on most systems)\n\n*/System/Library/LaunchAgents/\nIt does not seem to be documented, but only the first job configuration for each Label (e.g. org.openbsd.ssh-agent) will be kept. Any configuration from a later directory with the same Label as a configuration from an earlier directory is effectively skipped.\n\n1\nSee\nNSStartSearchPathEnumeration  used in launchctl.c\nand defined in\nNSSystemDirectories.h/NSSystemDirectories.c.\n2\nlaunchd also looks in the LaunchDaemons/ directories next to the various LaunchAgents/ directories for other types of jobs.\n", "Q: Prevent a Mac from waking up from keyboard or mouse? I put my PowerMac at work to sleep so that I can use Wake-on-LAN to do remote work on it. However the office cleaner often touches the keyboard or the mouse button unintentionally. So the question is:\nHow to disable mouse and keyboard wake up; to just use the power button and wake-on-LAN to wake/sleep instead?\nDon't tell me to disconnect mouse and keyboard.\n\nA: The solution I can offer is to use Sleepwatcher and add the following to your ~/.wakeup script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nWR=`syslog | grep -i \"Wake reason =\" | tail -1 | awk '{ print $11 }'`\n\nif [[ \"$WR\" =~ EHC[0-9] ]]; then\n    pmset sleepnow\nfi\n\nThis won't prevent your Mac from waking via keyboard or mouse.

My displays are color calibrated every other month or so with a hardware calibration tool. When I take a screen shot of a profile aware app, such as photoshop or lightroom or some web browsers, I don't want the screen shot to be adjusted for my monitor. Is there an easy way to do this besides my current approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*goto system preferences, display, color calibration\n\n*change the profile to a generic monitor one\n\n*start the color aware application (most seem to require a fresh startup to deal with the change)\n\n*take the screen shot\n\n*change my profile back\n\n*restart the application\n\n\nTo address @barryj's assertion that color profile only matters if I'm using a camera to take a picture of the display. Here are two screen shots of the same image, one with the default color profile applied to the monitor, and one with my custom profile applied, just to show you how much of a difference it really makes.\n\n\nA: The fact that the monitor's profile gets embedded is the only way the OS can preserve the appearance of colors in your photos. If you open a photo in Photoshop, take a screen capture (let's say for now via the built-in OS tool), then open this screen shot in Photoshop (and preserve the profile in the file) and compare both side to side, then you will see that the colors are visually similar even though the numbers for each pixel is different from one to the other.\nThis is all normal behavior. The colors you see on your screen on a calibrated and profiled monitor is actually raw values sent by the OS to the graphics card which then \"assigns\" the monitor profile to the values in real time so that the colors look like they should on the monitor. This is the simple explanation of course, there is much more going on in the background.\nIn the color management world there is only 2 options when you wish to play around with colors and profiles: assign or convert colors. When switching from one color space to another (i.e. from RGB to CMYK), your only option is convert since the laws of physics apply here. Within the same color space, if you assign profiles (or remove them, i.e. assigning nothing) you preserve the numbers while sacrificing (to various degrees) the appearance of the colors. When converting, you preserve the appearance of the colors while sacrificing the numbers in the file.\nIn your case, you need to convert the screen shot to a device-independent profile like Adobe RGB, or a device-dependent but easy to play with like sRGB. You can do that in Photoshop or Preview, as long as you do convert and not assign. Removing the profile is not really helping, since the numbers will have no meaning...\n\nA: My Mac's screenshot colors were off and I was terribly confused. I found this question and started investigating.\nSummary\nUse the display color profile sRGB IEC61966-2.1 when you want to take screenshots.\nHow I debugged it\nI created an image using GIMP that had a section of yellow RGB(255, 255, 0) and inspected it with the \"Digital Color Meter\" MacOS app. I thought the Chrome browser's color picker was acting kind of strange so avoided it.\n\nNotice 3 things:\n\n*\n\n*On the left, the color information of the file is not present.\n\n*Top right, you see the color meter show RGB(255, 255, 0). This is the color value that will end up in your screenshot file.\n\n*On the bottom, the monitor profile is set to sRGB IEC61966-2.1. This was the only profile that I found gave me accurate screenshots.\n\nCompare that with the readings when I activate other color profiles. The following Color LCD profile shows RGB(255, 253, 84) on the color meter. This was the default color profile, and although it might not be obvious on your screen, on mine it made the strong yellows look whiter, more like a banana. The worst part was that I just couldn't figure out which colors were the underlying real colors by analyzing screenshots.\n\nThe Generic RGB profile shows RGB(255, 255, 11) on the color meter.\n\nAnswering the original question\nI believe the answer is no, though you could develop a method. You can't have a color profile and take non-color-corrected screenshots. Looking at the MacOS APIs for capturing the screen:\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/1454852-cgwindowlistcreateimage\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturescreeninput\nThere doesn't seem to be a parameter that would allow ignoring the display color correction. What you could do is implement a tool that:\n\n*\n\n*Sets the color profile to sRGB IEC61966-2.1 by using CMSetSystemProfile\n\n*Takes a screenshot\n\n*Then sets the profile back to whatever color profile was active earlier.\n\nAlso, there might be other APIs I'm unaware of.\nHere's my original test png:\n\nImage embedded color profiles complicate things\nIf I take a screenshot when the Color LCD profile is active, the Color LCD profile is saved in the screenshot metadata. So even when I open that screenshot later when the sRGB IEC61966-2.1 profile is active, it's only slightly color-distorted to RGB(254, 255, 0), but some apps disregard the attached color profile, like the website photopea.com which will cause dramatically incorrect colors RGB(255, 254, 84).\nThis investigation was really confusing. Hopefully folks that read this get slightly less confused.\n\n\nA: MacOS screenshots embedded color profile, but you can change this in some apps as Photoshop or Preview.\nSo if you take a screenshot of the same image in 3 different calibrated monitors , they will look different when put together in same screen the 3 resulted images, BUT if you open them together in same Photoshop file, you will see the colors are exactly the same, as they would share same color profile.\nSo any screenshot would be always somehow \"color corrected\" , if don't, any screenshot you would take in your i.e. monitor A) would be different of the original image as your are watching it color corrected already.\nThe only way to have a standard screenshot all over your monitors, is having the same standard profile in every monitor, the problem is no monitor in the world shows same colors as default, so software must trick/correct this.\n\nA: This problem is made worse if you have a 2021 MacBook running macOS Monterey.\nAn easy solution would be to change your screen's color profile to sRGB, which I tried. The problem: Apple decided that using this color profile, your screen should be super dim and you shouldn't be able to adjust the brightness anymore.\nAnyway, after trying a few things, I changed the preset back to Apple XDR Display (P3-1600 nits) and set up an Automator Folder Action to Apply ColorSync Profile to all my screenshots.\n\nFor my uses (taking screenshots of websites) - this solved the problem. Hopefully Apple will bring back the ability to use other color profiles.\n\nA: MacOS comes with a bunch of scripts for manipulating image color spaces - Embedding profiles, matching an image to a profile, or 'proofing' an image through one space into another.\nIt's likely that either Matching an image to a given profile, or proofing it from one assumed profile to another, will do what you want.\nThe scripts are found in /Library/Scripts/ColorSync, and if you use the Scripts menulet, you can access them from the menu bar.\nThey are of course a front-end for the sips command line tool.\n\nA: Try opening up the screenshot in \"Preview\" and then under the \"Tools\" menu select \"Assign Profile...\" and change the profile of the image that way.\nIf that works, you should be able to automate the process with either a folder action and AppleScript to Automator.\n", "Q: How to get started with interfacing USB devices to iPad? The iPad would be the perfect handheld device for controlling some USB devices. I would like to get started with programming iPad applications which would communicate with USB devices.\nI guess I could use the dock port USB adapter to communicate with home made USB devices. How should one go about programming communication through that dock port and adapter? I need some directions. Don't know where to look, where to start. Not even sure if it is possible at all.\nI ask because I know most devices are not recognized. The drivers are not automagically installed as on desktop or laptop computers. I want to get started with programming low level communication so that the application itself on iPad would possibly manage the whole USB communication with its device.\nThank you very much,\nAny helpful input is welcome. Haven't found a lot of successful stories so far.\n\nA: You cannot directly interface with generic USB devices from a stock OS iPad unless you are a manufacturer in Apple's MFi (http://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/) program.  There appears to be a ton of paperwork involved to just apply.  The external accessories API is of no help on stock OS devices, unless you are manufacturing your own custom MFi-compliant device.\nAlternatives\n\n\n*\n\n*If your USB device can pretend to be a MIDI instrument or controller, you might be able to interface with it over USB by sending/receiving MIDI messages from the iPad.\n\n*Another option is to use a small inexpensive board, such as a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and use it to programmatically transfer USB data via WiFi to an iOS device.\n\n\nA: You probably want to look at the Apple External Accessories API documentation:\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/ExternalAccessoryPT/Introduction/Introduction.html\nNote that this does not just give you access to the device's USB port - to talk to a device it is my understanding that the device has to be designed to support this API as well.\n", "Q: Is there a way to verify the URL of a page loaded in a browser window inside an iPhone app? Specifically, I'm trying to make a purchase inside a certain iPhone app using Paypal. Instead of the app opening for me a paypal url in the Safari, it seems to be loading the paypal url in a browser window inside the app. I can't see the url of the page and in general can't be sure that the app isn't intercepting my paypal credentials.\nIs there a way to see what the url is of a browser window opened inside an app? Is there to verify that it is a genuine browser window and that the app can't eavesdrop on what I'm typing/submitting inside the window?\n\nA: Two Questions:\nVerify URL\nConnect through laptop. Use packet sniffing tools to check what requests go out.\nPerhaps: Disable 3G. Wrap with WiFi in Faraday cage, make sure no other covert incoming or outgoing communication.\nEavesdrop\nCat and mouse. Basic tools and basic skills will detect basic phishing/eavesdropping. But the above URL verification would not catch other simple methods like the website re-broadcasting it elsewhere, or the app recording and transmitting at other times.\nStill, you could read the EULA.\nGiven what is currently known about Apple and Google, Verizon and AT&T, Paypal and credit card companies, your ISP, business focii, data breaches, government agreements, other gov't interactions, etc. it is probably safest to assume that everything is tracked and recorded, whether you are using the phone or not.\n\nA: You may be able to tap and hold on a link on the webpage, copy the URL, and paste it into Notes or something. However, it's still no guarantee that you're  not being phished though.\n", "Q: Is there a way to purchase Cydia apps from a regular browser and not from inside Cydia? Is there a way to purchase Cydia apps from a regular browser and not from inside Cydia?\n\nA: Yes, there is. The home page\n\nA: I don't think you can purchase from Cydia on any website, but there are websites which allow you to view the packages available from Cycia, such as Cydia Search. You can use these sites to determine what you want to download on your computer so that you only have to do the actual downloads from your iPhone. If you look enough, you can find some applications that you can download using your computer, but they do not come through Cydia.\n\nA: Since the Cydia source is hosted and not actually in-app, @luca590's link is most appropriate right now for access to the store.\nOtherwise, when Lima releases, it'll be a different ballgame.\n", "Q: Keynote and presenter note fonts Is there a way to tell Keynote to change the font for all the presenter notes in this file to a specific font?

There are a few ways to reset the login password of an OS X user account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Starting up in single user mode, running mount -uw /, launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist, and dscl . passwd /Users/username.\n\n*Starting up in single user mode, removing /var/db/.AppleSetupDone, restarting, creating a new admin account, and changing the password of another account from System Preferences.\n\n*Starting up from a recovery partition or installation media, opening Terminal, and running resetpassword.\n\n\nIs there some way to prevent people with physical access to a Mac from using them?\n\nA: It can be prevented. Boot up your mac with your Mac OS X install DVD, and after it has loaded, go to utilities and select Firmware Password Utility. Select the checkbox \"Require Password to start this computer from another source\" and type in a password.\nThis password will prevent people from:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting CD/DVDs\n\n*Booting into Single User Mode\n\n*Booting into another OS stored on another partition or disk\n\n\nNo. 2 is the one where people type commands in it to reset the setup data in which they can go through the setup procedure and set up a completely new administrator account.\nHowever, the best way is to keep your mac with yourself. Anyone with root/administrator access can bypass this feature, by typing a few commands in the terminal. Keep your password secret and complex.\nIt is also worth mentioning that the EFI password is easily crackable. Some people had success with resetting the PRAM and gaining access, while others used exploits in the OS X system to gain root access and disabling the password using terminal commands. The way Apple encrypts is also very lax and you should make it very much different from your OS password.\n\nA: If you have 10.7 or later, another option is to enable FileVault 2. It makes starting up in single user mode require entering the password of an account that has been allowed to unlock FileVault, like normally your own user account.\nStarting up from the recovery partition won't require a password. But the list of volumes in Reset Password.app will be empty:\n\n", "Q: Force Quit Connecting Screen Share This has happened to me a couple of times now.

My question is a little vague, I'm sorry. I'll try to make it clear.\nI recently bought my iPad, and I fell in love with the calendar. I would like to start using it as my main calendar application, inputting all my future appointments and weekly tasks into it. I am afraid, however, that my iPad will become unavailable due to an empty battery, destruction etc. So what then?\nThus I wonder if Apple has some sort of online calendar to which I can sync my iPad calendar every time it's online or connected to a PC.\nI'm very sceptical to syncing it with Google calendar, seeing as the calendars work a bit differently. In my GC I have layed out my tasts and appointments in \"theme\" separated colorcoded calendars. It seems my iPad will only let me work with one calendar, and the Google calendar will show up as a different calendar. I don't want it to work like that - rather I'd like to have full control from both the iPad and the synchronized online calendar.\nIf anyone understands what I'm after, I'd love an answer :-)\n\nA: You have to tell Google Calendar which calenders to sync by using Google Sync. It's a bit convoluted, but once it's set up you shouldn't have to do it again. I've done it and use Google Calendar and my iPad exactly as you describe.\nGoogle have the instructions here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Google Sync with iOS Calendar\n\nA: It's not a free service, but many people really like Apple's Mobile Me service, which consists of mail, calendar, photo sharing, etc. that all works over the web. You can do a two month trial for free and see how it goes. http://www.apple.com/mobileme/\n\nA: You're saying that you only get one calendar available on your iPad - did you enable the other calendars from your iPad with m.google.com/sync ?? \n", "Q: Browse website developed in BootCamp via OS X/Safari If I develop a website in BootCamp under something like http://localhost:3458 can I browse that web site from within OS X?\nI was thinking maybe using Parallels/Virtual Box to point to the BootCamp partition and get it running and then from within Safari somehow point to that virtual machine's localhost.\nThis would be good so websites could be developed in Windows/Bootcamp and then viewed from OS X to see if they render ok.\nWould be also good to run up another virtual machine to look at the virtual machine with the web server on it eg/a Linux VM looking at the Windows VM to see how the website looks in Firefox etc\nCan any of this be done? \n\nA: You won't be able to browse the website on the Windows BootCamp - as Windows wont' be running while Mac OS X is. You possibly could browse to the bootcamp file system via safari, but the webserver wouldn't be running, so that may not be valid testing if your site is anything more than static files.\nYou could as you suggest used Parallels/Virtual Box or VMware Fusion to run the Bootcamp Windows instance while the Mac is running - one issue with this though is that if you switch between running Windows as a VM (under one of those products within Mac OS X) and between it running natively via bootcamp (i.e. Mac OS is shutdown, but windows is running) then you may have to keep reactivating windows, as it considers the hardware to be different when you boot it under the alternative method.\nWhether or not testing from a Linux machine is important or not, would be up to you. Linux browsers would be a pretty low statistic for most websites. You could easily run Firefox in both Windows and Mac to do your testing - personally, I'd feel also doing it under Linux might be overkill.\n", "Q: Assigning hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts) in Mac OS X 10.5.8 for audio playback I will begin by mentioning that I am a SQL/ASP.NET programmer and I work in Windows environments. However, I am in a very small department that has a mishmash of Macs and PCs, and to most of the people here I'm \"Generic IT Person,\" so occasionally I'm asked to troubleshoot Macs. I don't know squat about Macs, but since it usually involves clearing a printer jams, this hasn't been an issue. Until now.\nIn this case, one of our staff has recently started transcribing on her Mac using VLC media player and Word. She wants to be able to control audio playback from the keyboard while typing. We have figured out how to assign keyboard shortcuts in VLC, and these work fine, but only if VLC is the active window. We figured out that the F7-F9 keys will move backward, forward, play and pause (the icons were a big tipoff here) while she was typing, but she needs to do very short backward jumps. If she holds down the F7, it will skip back 10 secs or so at a time, but timing when to let go takes some real finesse.\nI figured these function keys must work because they are globally assigned. I found the Keyboard Shortcut interface in the System Preferences/Keyboard & Mouse panel, and I tried assigning F6 to VLC's menu item named \"Skip Backward\" (or something like that; I don't have it right in front of me). This works, but again, only when VLC Player is the active window.\nSO, the long and short of it is, is there a simple way to assign a very short backward skip function to a hotkey combination that will work on VLC player while Word is the active window? Or do I need to admit defeat?\n\nA: The function keys work because they are system-wide \"media player control keys\".  Keystrokes always go to the system, which usually passes them exclusively to the active application, but some have special handling.   There's a chance that you could reconfigure VLC so that the system-wide media key that means \"rewind\" does skip back instead.  Check that out.  \nOtherwise you're going to need some kind of additional keyboard shortcut app like QuicKeys.  (See also these suggestions).  Don't give up yet!  You almost certainly can cobble together a solution.\n\nA: Admittedly these only work when VLC is an active menu, but they are useful.  On a Mac, try this:\ncommand + arrows (left and right) -- skip tracks\ncommand + shift + arrows -- skip 1 minute\ncommand + option + arrows -- skip 10 seconds\ncommand + control + arrows -- skip 3 seconds\nYou can customize these shortcuts in the \"preferences\" panel under the main \"VLC\" menu (press command comma).  The sixth tab is called \"hotkeys.\"  Have fun!\n", "Q: OS X: Read mbox formatted files in /var/mail (local mail) graphically I have a local development environment that is sending email to the mbox file at /var/mail/myusername.\nI can successfully view those emails with the command line mail program, but I'm looking for a way to read the emails graphically (they contain HTML).\nI've read the article at: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20040313194905606, but I've also read that this method does not work in Snow Leopard (10.6) because Mail.app no longer uses standard mbox files, but rather has it's own format based on sqlite.\n\nA: An easier approach would be to use the mutt command line client that will natively access /var/mail/[username] without having to take extra steps for conversions and forwarding.\nThis is easy with MacPorts or homebrew (you probably want only one of these managers installed)\nsudo port install mutt\nbrew install mutt\n\n\nA: You can convert the mbox format to a maildir format and use the hint in the article you mentioned.

With Finder I can click on the Desktop and then use ⌘-N to create a new Finder window. What I am looking for is a method for performing the same function for Terminal windows.\nHow can I create a new Terminal instance in the current space, regardless of whether or not there is another Terminal instance in one or more other spaces.\nThanks.\n\nA: You can create a new service using automator (from the applications folder). At the top of the automator window, enter: Service receives 'no input' in 'any application'. Then, in the workflow, add 'Run applescript'. Make the applescript contain the following:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        do script \"\"\n        activate\n    end tell\n\n    return input\nend run\n\n(You can add any command you like into the do script line between the \" \" (e.g. something useful to run when terminal first opens like uptime if you like, or just leave it blank).\nSave the service as 'Open Terminal' or whatever name you like. It should now appear in your services menu.\nThen if you want to add a keyboard shortcut, you just need to go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts tab, select services in the left hand menu, and find your new service (its probably near the bottom). Just click in the space to the right of your service name, and assign it whatever keyboard shortcut you like, and hey presto! it should all work\n\nA: In the application assignments in System Preferences -> Spaces, either set Terminal to \"Every Space\" or delete the entry. Then it should be no problem to open a new Terminal window wherever you want, e.g. by clicking on the dock context menu \"New Window\" (works even if you have the \"When switching to an app, switch to space with open windows from that app\" option enabled).\n\nA: tell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script \"\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\nTo make this work under Lion, type the above into a new AppleScript window and save it. Invoke the script through a command launcher like QuickSilver or assign it to a keyboard shortcut. This should work, even if you have set the \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\" setting enabled in Mission Control. The trick is to do the activate command last, rather than at the beginning.\n\nA: If you use the dock menu to open a new window it opens in the current space.\n\nA: You can disable OSX switching spaces automatically when you switch applications using the following commands:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO\nkillall Dock\nWorks on 10.6.8\n", "Q: Why is my ethernet connection between two Macs so slow? I'm currently trying to port all my old stuff from an old Power Mac G4 (MDD) to a newer Power Mac G5 (Late 2005). Both have gigabit ethernet and so I decided to connect the two via ethernet cable (Cat6). Both are running OS X 10.5.8.\nHowever... I'm only getting speeds of up to about 40Mbit/s, and it's taking hours (nearly a whole day in total) to transfer about 200GB. Are there any reasons why it might be so slow, and is there any way I can speed it up?\nThanks!\n:-Joe\n\nA: I already have this problem in the past and solve it by disabling internet sharing. I don't know why disabling internet sharing speedup bandwidth but it maybe useful for you.\nYou can also try another ethernet cable.\n\nA: You could try FireWire Target Disk Mode. Boot the source computer while holding down the T key and connect to the destination computer. The source's drive(s) will show up on the desktop and you can copy files that way. \nI don't know if it will be any faster; the bottleneck could be your hard drive speeds. \n\nA: Considering they're older Macs, you're probably hitting the hard drives' I/O limit.\n", "Q: How can I remove a folder from the itunes library I added a folder (a network share) to the iTunes media library (File -> Add Folder to library).\nI didn't find a way I can undo this operation.\nWhat am I missing? how can I remove this folder from the iTunes library?\nI am using iTunes 10.2 in Windows 7 32bit.\nEdit: I configured iTunes not to copy media files locally.\n\nA: It depends on your iTunes preferences. \n1.If iTunes is running default, iTunes actually copied all that media to your local drive, and you would have to delete it manually via sorting by \"Date Added\" to remove it.\n2.If you have iTunes set to reference the files, when you disconnect the drive iTunes has some pretty annoying behavior where it will try to maintain the link but it will become a ghost music icon, the best way to get rid of these is sort by \"Date Added\" in your library and remove them manually.\nThese behaviors can be checked under iTunes preferences, I copied this pic from the Apple support site under HT1751:\n", "Q: How to know which iOS apps are restricted to a country?

Unfortunately I was not aware how my symbols have been arranged in that way, I cannot find any menu entry nor do I remember the short cut that I might have pressed accidentally. Do you know how to invoke this function? Since I tried out some Apple menu items I found, I now ended up with the desktop arranged by the grid. But I prefer the bunches.\nUpdate: Ops, it happened again. I hardly assume this automatic arranging of my desktop happens when I connect an external display in mirror mode having a smaller resolution. Now it looks as follows:\n\nNotice the stacking of symbols in the top right that is the result of a formerly \"Clean up\" command in the desktop's context menu. But anyway, Mac OS created these 5 bunches again. As there is obviously a feature like that implemented, I am curious if I can run it also manually without connecting an external display to make it happen.\n\nA: Once the desktop fills up, finder will tile and stack icons with a very small offset. I'd guess the algorithm had a bug or your .DS_Store file was corrupt and the system thought it had more icons to pile than it ended up with.\nI dont know of a way to intentionally trigger the effect, but it would be nice to have four or five tidy stacks nice and deep rather than using the whole desktop.\n", "Q: Find gateway address and netmask? I come from the land of windows, where the ipconfig command shows four important pieces of information: IP address, netmask, gateway address, and MAC address.\nHowever, on a Mac, ifconfig only shows IP address and MAC address.\nWhere can I find the gateway address (e.g. 192.168.1.1) and the netmask (e.g. 255.255.255.0)?\n\nA: On most Unix-like systems, including OSX, that information comes from netstat -r (r for \"route\").\n\nA: With ifconfig on OS X you can find netmask :\ninet 192.168.1.2 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255\n\nnetmask 0xffffff00 means 255.255.255.0\nAnd for finding gateway address use arp -a or as geekosaur said use netstat -nr | grep '^default'.\n", "Q: Chessmaster for MAC Is there any cheessmaster version for mac?\n\nA: Chessmaster does not have a Mac version, but there are a few other chess programs that run on Mac, including the built-in Chess program, which you can find in the Applications folder.\nHere's a partial list of Mac chess programs: http://osx.iusethis.com/tag/chess\nIf you're really hung up on Chessmaster, you could run it under Windows on your Mac using either virtualization (e.g. Parallels, VMWare) or Boot Camp.

After sync'ing, I only saw purchased apps in iTunes, not those free ones.\nDoes this mean, if I don't sync iPad 2 before upgrade, only purchased apps will be removed from my iPad 2? \n\nA: Prior to upgrading, attempt the \"transfer purchases\" option in iTunes. With your iPad plugged in, go to \"File\" --> \"Transfer Purchases from iPad\". See if that transfers over your free applications as well. (I've had to do this sometimes to get all mine to transfer.) Note that this may take awhile to do.\nAlso note that this only transfers free applications from the app store, not built-in apps like the calendar, camera, etc.\nAnd finally note that I've had occasions where even after I've transfered purchases multiple times, and can verify that everything did transfer correctly, that the upgrade process still insists that there are purchases that haven't been transferred. At that point, knowing I've done everything I can do, I ignore the warning and proceed with the upgrade.

I'm running Mac OS X 10.6.3, and find myself switching between the Dvorak and U.S. Extended keyboard layout.  Ideally I'd want a Dvorak layout with the international character support of the latter (e.g. Option-u for umlaut, Option-6 for circumflex, etc), but such a thing didn't turn up during some quick googling.\nCan I download such a keyboard layout somewhere or, failing that, is there a tool to create such a layout?\n\nA: Option-U does work under Dvorak -- but you have to use the Dvorak key-mappings, so really it becomes Option-F.\nIf you're still not happy with it, you might try this online tool to create your own custom keyboard layout: http://wordherd.com/keyboards/\nIt hasn't been updated in six years, so no guarantee it will work on the latest versions of OS X.\n\nA: The Dvorak keyboard layout on Macintosh already has international character support, the exact same support found in the US keyboard layout. There is no need to switch from one to the other if your primary language is English and you need to type occasional words or sentences in other Western European languages.\nI have been using the Dvorak layout on Mac since about 1988, and for all the years since then, I have been using it to type in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German, without any modification or re-mapping of keys at all. The \"dead-key\" diacriticals are all available; it is only a matter of memorizing their locations.\n\nDvorak\n\nDvorak with Option key held down to show \"dead-key\" diacritical combinations along with other characters needed in Western European languages\n\nU.S. layout\n\nU.S. layout with Option key held down to show \"dead-key\" diacritical combinations. Note that the exact same set of \"dead-key\" diacriticals are available on both the Dvorak and U.S. layouts, and they are assigned to the exact same keys although those keys are of course in different physically-mapped locations. The same goes for all the other characters used in other Western European languages.\nIf you need other characters that are not provided on either the U.S. or Dvorak keyboard layouts, then of course you should investigate other keyboard layouts specific to other countries, nationalities and languages.\n[Just last week I had to use Adobe InDesign and WordPress to handle text from an orchestra concert program including two words in Czech with characters that I had not encountered before, and neither of these keyboard layouts provide support for that!]\n", "Q: FaceTime added to Dock on Start Up I've encountered an interesting issue, and I am wondering if anyone else has experience with it.\nEvery time I restart my Mac, FaceTime is added back to the Dock. If I remove it from the Dock, it disappears. Restart, and it's back. I can remove other things just fine and they stay where they are, if I re-arrange FaceTime in the Dock it stays in its new position. Only when I remove it does something put it back.\nRecent System Changes that might be causing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI Update was just installed, it seemed to start happening as soon as it rebooted from installing this.\n\n*XCode was upgrade from 4.0.1 to 4.0.2\n\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist and rebuilt my Dock from scratch. After restarting, everything was exactly where I wanted it except the FaceTime app was added back.\n\n\n(Anything else I try, I will edit and post here)\nHas anyone else had problems with applications getting \"stuck\" in the Dock? How'd you fix it? FaceTime is neat, and I use it occasionally, but it isn't worth a dedicated spot on the Dock.\n\nA: Remove them from your dock, then go under the go tab in finder to your hard drive, then to library, and then in the prefences folder find com.apple.dockfixup.plist and move it to the recycle bin. Problem solved. This worked for me and I am running Lion so, hopefully it will work for you...\n\nA: This could be caused if your machine is managed -- more accurately, if your machine connected to an open directory server. Or perhaps to a OS X lion server, managing your machine's preferences.\n\nA: Open Activity Monitor, kill the \"apsd-ft\" process, remove FaceTime and then install it again.\nThere's also another solution I found on google (link here):\n\nI was able to finally fix the problem by using the option in Onyx for LaunchServices rebuild. No more Facetime icon on reboot.\n\n", "Q: How do I use Applescript with Keynote?

I recently upgraded from Windows to a Mac, and now I have two Macbooks. Would they work better with my wireless if I got an Apple Airport a/b/n router? (I couldn't find anything about this on Google or anywhere else.) \n\nA: It's not so much that AirPort routers will work \"better\", but I can guarantee that setup of AirPort routers when using Mac computers is much easier than other routers.  The AirPort Utility really makes setup a breeze!\nThis comes from years of experience as a network admin and having personally owned/used at least one of just about every major brand of home router.  If you can afford an AirPort router, you won't regret the purchase.\n\nA: The Apple Airport router will work better in the sense that it allows you to use some additional features, including \"Wake on Demand\" (included with Snow Leopard):\n\nThe Wake on Demand feature of Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard lets your Mac continue to share items (such as music, printers, files, or your screen) when it is asleep.\n\n", "Q: Recover partitions or data after partition map becomes corrupted (HFS+) So back story about my hard drive. I bought a USB 3.0 enclosure and a well rated and trusted brand WD 2tb hard drive to put in it. For many months now it had been running flawlessly on my iMac, formatted 100% as HFS+. After I decided to sell my iMac, I made a complete backup image of my iMac's hard drive as a single image file onto this external. It worked great and under Windows 7 with Macdrive installed, I could mount and access my old computer completely as if it was still running. (Note that the image file was 257gb in size, and I have about 1tb worth of self ripped movies, music, and my professional photography work.)\nNow here's where I went wrong (as this is all my fault). My Windows machine has a vast library of games running on Steam's gaming platform. About 200gb worth. And I store those files on a separate hard drive than the boot drive of my Windows machine. The issue is that drive had some bad sectors and when Steam began to access files within, Windows would hard-lock on me and I'd have to cut the power. After it happened a couple times, I decided to make a backup of my files and try to fix the drive and reinstall Steam. Well I got as far as half the backup. You see, instead of trying to find what games would lock the system (by individually selecting a game and verifying the files in Steam to see which ones lock up the system) I just went ahead and ran the backup tool to place all the files onto my trusted external.\nHalfway through the process the computer locked up and I had NO CHOICE but to cut the power and reboot. Upon entering Windows again, I'm greeted with a \"you need to format this disc before you can use it\" dialog. Great. Further inspection with Disk Management revealed the entire disc was not partitioned.\n(Info about the working setup; I had one partition that spanned the whole disk but because it's a mac it had a small EFI labeled partition at the beginning. It is a 2tb drive partitioned at about 1.8tb. HFS+ filesystem of course, journaled.)\nI attempted to run testdisk in Windows to find and restore the old partitions. First attempt found the correct partitions on quick analyses and the write function actually wrote it. Unfortunately no files appeared. So I rebooted with a gparted live cd to see what happened and decided to get rid of the partitions I just restored. I don't know what I was thinking...\nLong story short, it was my fault and I'm desperate for getting my info back. Running testdisk from a Mac reveals HUNDREDS of found partitions in a deeper search.\nMy next thoughts are; would it be a better idea to format the entire disk from a Mac, to restore a standard disk layout of an EFI partition and the main partitions, and run a data recovery wizard? Or is my data long gone? I haven't written any information to any part of the disc except the partition map.\nSome recent updates; I have located the correct partition and restored it with TestDisk. Unfortunately the partition is unable to be accessed still even though I know it's the correct partition. Do I need to restore the small 200mb EFI partition that Mac formatting creates? If so, would it be a valid solution to format the whole drive on a Mac (quick) and remove the large partition it creates and restore the partition I know is correct using testdisk?\nEssentially I'm looking to restore the partition as if nothing went wrong. Where all my data is just up and running again. I am not adverse to recovering the data however, I don't have a large enough secondary storage solution to transfer recovered files to.\n\nA: DiskWarrior\nIt worked wonders for me, and so did it for many other people. However, for very serious cases like yours, it took about 3 months continuously to completely restore all my data back. However, this requires a Mac.\n\nA: SpinRite\nIt works wonders on any issue with normal hard drives, also works well as a maintenance tool to keep your drives in good shape. \nIf SpinRite can't save your data, then it will be way cheaper to just re-download the games than try and have the data recovered.\n", "Q: prevent launchctl from starting a anonymous process I have installed dnsmasq and now I want to be able to start it with launchctl. The problem is that every time I start the app launchctl starts an anonyous process instead of using the specified label.\n10247   -   0x100107c30.anonymous.dnsmasq\n-       0   com.example.dnsmasq\n\nBut I want it to be\n10247    0  com.example.dnsmasq\n\nThe problem with the anonymous process is that I can't stop it with launchctl.

If it fork()s into the background, launchd can't tell; then when it talks to launchd, launchd creates an anonymous entry for it.  Make sure dnsmasq doesn't background itself.\n(The - listed for the regular launchctl list output indicates that the original dnsmasq process exited.)\n", "Q: Disk utility hanging I'm trying to reformat the hard drive on an iMac G5 prior to selling it. I've booted the Mac from the installation DVD that came with it, opened Disk Utility, and told it to erase the drive using both security options for zeroing out and rewriting the data. However, Disk Utility seems to be hanging: I let it run for over 12 hours and it didn't finish; I needed to unplug the Mac and restart it (the program wouldn't even let me force-quit it.) \nI started the process again, but it still seems to be going extraordinarily slowly. Is there something wrong with this, or does it just plain take a long time? I'm not hearing the hard disc spinning; it sounds like it's hung again. \n\nA: How big is your hard-drive? It's entirely possible that it would be normal for zeroing out the sectors to take that long. I'm only extrapolating here, but I've had secure-deletions of the trash take an hour or more for a few gigabytes, so if the hard-drive is large, I could see it taking quite some time.\nThe other thought is that there is some problem with the drive that prevents the format from completing. You might want to check the drive for errors and/or bad sectors. It is possible that you would have eventually encountered the error on the hard drive yourself (potentially causing instability, data loss, etc.).\nFinally, if you look at Activity Monitor, does it look like the disk utility is doing anything? Check your disk I/O statistics there as well and see if anything is still going on with the disk in question.\n", "Q: Is there a way to turn off an external Apple Cinema Display remotely and continue to use the computer? Here's the situation: I often access my Mac Pro remotely using Screen Sharing and sometimes TeamViewer. The problem is that when I do this, everything I'm doing can be seen by those near the physical computer. It also uses a considerable amount unnecessary power to have the displays on but not actually being used.\nIs there a way to turn them off and not just blank if possible, while still using Screen Sharing or TeamViewer Free?\n\nA: I don't think this is possible with Screen Sharing.  (That would go against the \"spirit\" of the Screen Sharing feature, which is to help people troubleshoot a problem or work collaboratively on something.)\nThis is not a free alternative, but if you use Apple Remote Desktop ($80), you have the option to \"curtain\" the screen, which not only hides what you're doing, but locks the remote computer against local access.  It also has many powerful system maintenance/monitoring features.\nAs far as saving power, could you simply turn off the local display before you leave the location?  You should also set the display to sleep when it's not being used (in the Energy Saver pref pane) -- in that case, it would only be drawing power while you're connected and using it.  Also, if you're using one of the new LED Cinema Displays, keep in mind they are energy efficient devices, so the power draw isn't as much of a concern as with standard (non-LED) displays.\n\nA: If your computer is running or is capable of running OS X Lion, or OS X Mountain Lion Screen Sharing is able to use a feature called Virtual Display to allow remote user a view that does not mirror the actual screen on the Mac, not sure if energy saver is able to know about the Virtual Display and not keep the Physical display active, but it is worth a try.\nAs noted in What's new in Lion: AirDrop and screen sharing\n\nScreen Sharing\nunder Lion has been significantly enhanced. To begin with, it’s now possible for you to not only view the display of another Mac, but also share the screen for any account you have access to on that Mac, even when someone else is using it with another account.\nFor example, let’s say a remote Mac has two user accounts—Joe and Jane. Joe is currently working on that Mac in his account. From another Mac, Jane can select that Mac under the Shared heading in a Finder window, click Share Screen, and enter her user name and password in the resulting dialog box. When she clicks the Connect button, a Select Display window appears. Within this window are two options—Ask to Share the Display and Connect to a Virtual Display. If she clicks Ask to Share the Display a message appears on the other Mac indicating that Jane would like to share the screen. If Joe clicks Share Screen, Jane can see what’s on Joe’s screen as well as control Joe’s account.\n\nAdditionally according to OS X Mountain Lion: Share the screen of another computer the feature is also available in the brand new Mountain Lion OS too.\n", "Q: Disabling the \"keep pressed\" function of OS X sticky keys I use the accessibility feature called sticky keys in OS X, what it does is that if you press a command modifier key (Ctrl, Cmd, Alt, Shift, Fn), it stays \"pressed\" until you press another key. This is very useful if you often use your keyboard with one hand, and actually quite convenient even when you use two hands.\nThe thing is that if you press a modifier key twice it stays \"pressed\" until you press it again. While it is sometimes handy, for me it would be preferable if this aspect of the functionality could be disabled, since I trigger it accidentally every now and then.\nI realize that if this is at all possible it probably means fiddling with some system file somewhere, that's fine. I just want to see if someone out there might know where to look? :)\n\nA: You can't turn off the \"key lock\" functionality (last checked on OS X 10.8.2). You can however install KeyRemap4MacBook, which allows you to make modifier keys sticky without this \"key lock\".\n\nA: I believe you have to press it 3 times to release it.\n\n\n*\n\n*First Press - Locks the modifier key, and unlocks it after the next key press\n\n*Second Press - Locks the modifier key for multiple other key presses.\n\n*Third Press - Unlocks the modifier.\n\n\nExmaple:\nPressing Shift twice while sticky keys is on would be the same result as turning on CAPS lock.\n\nA: I've seen this behavior even when \"sticky keys\" is turned off in system settings, by unchecking the \"enable sticky keys\" checkbox.  I was seeing shift stuck \"on\" only for OS actions (not for normal typing) after coming back from a lock screen.  \nTo resolve this, I turned sticky keys on (Mac Settings) and then toggled them off again using the shortcuts above. \n\nA: You can get this behavior by using a third-party program called \"Karabiner-Elements\"\nLeave Enable Sticky Keys unchecked in System Preferences > Accessibility > Keyboard > Hardware.\nInstead, open \"Karabiner-Elements\" and click Simple modifications. Then select Add item > From key > left_shift and under To key > sticky left_shift. Repeat for right_shift and optionally Option, Command, Control.\nYou might also want to investigate the function \"sticky left_shift (pressing and holding down is disabled).\"\nI've noticed problems with Apple's sticky keys feature ever since upgrading to Mac OS 12.2. And a discussion about it on support.apple.com indicates Apple is unwilling to fix it.\n\nA: go in to system pref, accessibility, keybord (left column) sticky keys, options, then \"press shift five times to toggle sticky keys\"\n", "Q: Is there an iPhone app that can give me a push notification of a new email? I want an app that can push my emails so they show up with the blue screen and with my notification tone.\nI've tried Im+ but it's a chat also and I just want to push my emails.\nI have Gmail, and I only want to push Gmail mails. \nIs there an app that can do just that?\nNote: I want the blue icon that appears with a sound. (This is the exact same thing that happens to SMS and any other push notification. \n\nA: I think you might be confusing \"push\" and \"SMS\".\nPush allows an email client to receive a message shortly after it has been sent, without waiting for a \"fetch\" window at n minutes.\nIf you just want all mail to show up as SMS (text message), you can use Gmail's built-in forwarding to achieve this.  It will forward the email as soon as it is received, and all SMS messages are delivered in a \"push\"-y manner, so this should do what you want.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Gmail's \"Mail settings\"\n\n*Select the \"Forwarding and POP/IMAP\" tab\n\n*Click the button to \"Add a fowarding address\" and enter your phone's SMS text number (you can find a very comprehensive list of carrier email-to-SMS addresses here: http://www.emailtextmessages.com/)\n\n*Verify that you own the address (they will send a verification code to the address, and you'll enter it in Gmail)\n\n*Select to \"Forward a copy of incoming mail to\" that address you just entered\n\n*Choose to \"keep Gmail's copy in the inbox\" if you would also like to be able to access your email the traditional way\n\n\nYou don't need to sign up for any third-party service, it's free, and you'll get your SMS messages immediately.\nIf you only want to forward a subset of your email, you can set that up in Gmail as a filter with a rule that forwards to your SMS email address.\nKeep in mind the limitations of SMS, though.  The theoretical maximum length for an SMS is 255 concatenated 160 character messages, but most carriers will limit it to only a few messages -- so you might lose a lot of body text on longer emails.  But it will serve as good, fast notification that a new email has arrived.\n\nA: You can get push notifications for Gmail by setting up Google sync.\n\nA: You might want to take a look at Boxcar. It may not be exactly what you're looking for, but it might work.\nSince you don't seem to like Boxcar, then perhaps you can simply check on Google about different alternatives. You may come up with something like \"How To Send Email To Any Cell Phone (for Free)\", which again, I don't know if it's going to be useful, because you don't mention much other than an existing 6€ alternative is too expensive.\n\nA: The Google Search app can accept push notifications for your Gmail account.

Audio will not come out of the loudspeaker, but the ear piece works, the headphones work and plugging into iPhone speakers via universal connector works. Oddly, the loudspeaker works when on a call and setting to loudspeaker.\nI think the audio is constantly being routed through the universal connector, for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It tells me that the device is is plugged into is not compatible with iPhone, despite not being plugged into anything at all.\n\n*It connects to my speakers instantly, normally there is a slight delay is it needs to redirect the audio.\n\n\nAlso, I tried plugging it in and out of the speakers with audio running, without and it various other variations.

As great as some of the \"child-friendly\" apps are, the stock UI of iOS devices is not designed to keep curious children at bay.\nYou could always load up an app for kids with built-in parent controls.

If you want an SSD, you have to get one big enough to hold all your data.\nAs for the 27\" iMac and the upper model of the 21\" (which have two drive bays):\nPerformance. Yes, you can fit the OS on a small SSD, but that's not the only thing that will benefit from being on a faster drive. Any operations that involve a lot of reading/writing will be faster if they're working with files on an SSD.\nConvenience. Unless you set up your apps and Finder especially well, it will take a little more time to get to stuff on a secondary disk.\nQuietness: SSDs don't chatter like HDDs. If you have both an HDD and SSD, you'll still hear the noise. Silent computers are nice, IMO.\nApple-ness: One of the things many people like about Apple computers is that things are mostly seamless ('Just Work'). Having one big, fast, quiet drive is more seamless and Apple-y than one small, fast, quiet drive and one big, slow, loud one.\nOne more reason Apple does it: Because they can: Add SSD. People buy SSD. Profit!\n\nA: You have to think beyond the OS. How many times are you booting up your computer (or putting it to sleep) a day? \nNow how about launching and working with files? A lot of times a day I guess.\nYou don't want to keep ONLY your OS in the SSD, you want to keep often used apps, your music if it fits (and you access it very often) or your photos, etc. That's what takes time on a hard drive. On the other hand, since they are still not big enough to replace mechanical drives (and it they were the prices would be prohibitive) then you still have to have a traditional drive for long term storage. \nApps in SSD Drives launch in 1-2 seconds. Everything is faster. \n\nA: If you have very important data, it makes sense to store that data onto an SSD rather than a traditional HD. So Apple giving you the 256GB SSD option totally makes sense to people like photographers who want to keep their Aperture library on the SSD rather than the traditional HD.\n", "Q: What causes permissions to change? In Mac OS X, what causes the change in file permissions?\nFor example, consider that the operating system was terminated abnormally. \nOn a subsequent boot, randomly (or possibly those files that were open at the instant of termination) files have their permissions changed. They differ.\nWhat is the cause?\n\nA: The answer above is wrong - if one bit on the disk changes, the ECC on the disk will correct it, or the e.g. a application image will become unusuable - cause a \"segmentation violation\". Change a bit in the node that refers to a file - and the file may be useless. \nDo not muck around when you answer \"bmick\". You obviously do not know enough about hardware and operating systems. In better servers, even the RAM will use ECC to avoid single bit errors.\nI see this consistently in the Java VM framework. And the bug is probably what you describe: That a new version of Java VM has changed SUID, the Disk Utilty use a wrong repository for what file permission is supposed to be.\nNow Apple, the \"Disk Utility\" is GNU Open source. Update your repositories when new 3rd party OS components are installed. This makes the software run with apparent hang-ups. The modifications blocks access to files and makes the applications hang and even loose files and make databases corrupt.\nTo help you, Thunderbird works fine on Linux/Ubuntu, and I can even access the MacOS files from the Ubuntu partition. On MacOS I loose files - and get \"Permission Inconsistency\". You can look at the Linux list of bugs with HFS+, where they describe this error - that file permission is changed, where this is blamed on the journal update of files that remain open when the system is taken down - \"Synced()\".\nNow, HFS+ on Linux will close the files, and flush the journal. MacOS' journal is not flushed on time, and updated later, and when a \"Force Quit\" is done you risk an error. Then you update with the wrong answer you introduce errors and for others to replicate these errors are very difficult, because they have exercised extensive effort to find out what they do wrong. \nWe will not use Ubuntu to correct MacOS, it is so much easier to use Ubuntu without the bugs.\n\nA: First of all - random errors creep into any system. Modern hard drives have billions of bits stored and when you ask for a file to be written as 0101011 sometimes the machine writes 0101001 and if it's writing the permissions bits, there's your answer. If you do the math, assuming 99.99% accuracy would mean more than one error is on everyone's hard drive most of the time.\nThings get cut off in the middle of finishing. Electrical noise crops up and messes up the signal, cosmic rays hit your memory chip and flip a bit, some program code isn't perfect so the math gets done wrong.\nThen you have all the times another program wants to change the permissions and there is disagreement. Permission errors are usually logged to the system log so when you have a problem, have a look, maybe run permission repair to fix up the programs installed by apple.\nWhen in doubt - go to the source:\n\n\n*\n\n*Troubleshooting permissions issues\nin Mac OS X\n\n*About Disk Utility's Repair Disk\nPermissions feature\n\n*and some warnings and errors should\njust be ignored\n", "Q: iTunes fails to subsribe to a podcast I am using iTunes 10.2 on Windows 7 32bit\nI am trying to subscribe to a video podcast (Tekzilla) and I am getting an error message.\n\nI've been trying to do that for a couple of days and I'm getting the same error message so I guess the problem is on my side, somehow....\n\nA: Try subscribing directly to the feed.\nUnder the \"advanced\" menu, select \"subscribe to podcast…\".

Xcode 3 comes with the GCC 4.2, LLVM-GCC 1.5 and LLVM 1.5 so everything you need to compile C++, C and ObjC code.\n(Remark: LLVM 1.5 can't compile C++ code, so you have to switch back to LLVM-GCC or GCC for this.)\n\nA: XCode does NOT come with the latest GCC and G++ (it comes with 4.2), so you still need to do your own install if you want the latest features.

I have the latest gen iPod touch: which has an HD camera with mic. I\nwant to record class lectures and such but the files are massive that\nit produces: 4+ gigs for 1 hour using the built in app. Is there a\nsetting or another app that will allow extremely high quality audio\nand video without the cost of such a large file?\nCurrently I record, sync, encode then watch.  My 1 tb HDD is filling up quickly.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: \"Extremely high quality audio and video\" will take up a lot of space, so you'll have to compromise on quality if you want to save on file size.\nI would suggest using HandBrake to re-encode your videos at a lower bitrate or smaller size.\n\nA: I understand you want to record directly on iPod in any given lower quality to get smaller file sizes, but this is highly unlikely to happen. If you do encode the big file to a small file using something like HandBrake already, you might have realized it does take a long time to encode even on a desktop. So, I'm not sure if the iDevices have the processor power to do it on the fly, but maybe they do.\nThat being said, I'd say your best bet to save on file size and disk space is using a video service and just uploading your video on the cloud. You might go with Qik or maybe even Youtube, they'll encode to a very small file for you and you can even download them later - saving you the job to encode and you don't even need to fill up your disks if you don't want to - but if you do the files will already be as small as possible.\n\nA: There is an App for that called (Video Camera+) and will allow you to record video at a lower resolutions thus recording at a smaller file size.\nLast I checked it was 99 cents.\nVideo Camera+\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-camera/id441433868\nIt is very much like the built-in iphone camera app but it will ad the option to reduce the 1080p to a range of lower resolutions.\n", "Q: iTunes is sometimes \"Connecting to Store\" again and again iTunes is showing this \"Connecting to Store\" alert.

We have an iMac with several accounts (two admins, one normal and one parental controlled).\nMy son's account (the parental controlled) will not let me change the desktop wallpaper!  Seriously?  I even told it to allow him to run system preferences (once) and even though I chose another wallpaper image, it won't work.\nSURELY there is a way to change the simple desktop wallpaper for a managed account without opening the terminal?\nThanks for any tips.\n\nA: You can set the wallpaper to automatically show images from a certain folder, switching images every X amount of time. This way, your son can put the image he wants in the proper folder and remove the old picture, and the next time it is changed it will choose the only picture there.\n\nUse the + button to select the proper folder, change the stretching rule to fit your needs, and check the box for automatically changing the picture. If you don't set it to automatically change pictures, it will look for the last picture used and show a blank screen when it doesn't find it. You can force the image to be reloaded by logging out and back in, or by executing killall Dock from the Terminal.\n\nA: Have you tried making an automator application to take a dropped image and call the \"Set the Desktop Picture\" action?  \nAny image dropped on the icon should work once you allow the application to run.\nMy guess is some other problem is preventing this since I've tested several restricted accounts and all of them allow desktop pictures from the control-click, control panel as well as the application suggested above.\n", "Q: How do I clean up the simple finder for a parental controlled account? We gave our son a parental controlled account on the iMac (Snow Leopard) and while we were able to limit the apps, we don't even want him to see the restricted apps.

When he opens it, it tells him that the program is denied.  But I prefer out of sight, out of mind.\nAny tips appreciated.\nThank you.\n\nA: As you've confessed your developing skills, I'll just limit myself to tell you that, as far as I know, it's not possible to hide applications from a user that has Parental Controlled accounts, even with simple Finder. I believe Apple considered that it was too much trouble. \nWhat I'd do is move your son's applications to his /User/son/Applications and restrict access to /Applications for him. \nYou may be wondering: \"but wouldn't that mean I'd have to duplicate apps I also want to use?\". And you'd be right.\n:)\n\nA: Parental controls are basically a control-permission layer...and don't modify the underlying OS, which is what you're asking for in hiding/relocating Applications for your son. Seeing an app is benign. If you insist on making it work, you have to remove the applications in question from the main Applications folder and install them in a user-specific location (ie. ~/Applications/ -> Home folder vs /Applications/ -> Macintosh HD).\n\nA: Ah, there is a very simple answer to this question: System Preferences > Users & Groups > \"Enable Parental Controls\". In the Parental Controls section, check only the applications you want to allow your child to use.

It has been a very long time since I had to do a multi-session CD, but I remember doing this way or in a very similar way.

It comes on everyday and the podcasts are uploaded to a website so users can download and listen to them for free. The website isn't very navigable, however, and it's extremely hard to play the podcasts from my phone (and, therefore, my car).\nI have a long commute and I would love it if I could either access these podcasts via some kind of iphone app or maybe even a mobile-friendly website. I am first trying to figure out which would be better (iphone app vs mobile friendly website) and how sketchy you think it would be for me to develop the app (or site) and then offer it to the radio show for them to upload their podcasts. Alternatively, if they didn't want it, I would just download the podcasts from the site and re-upload them to mine.\nPlease note I am not trying to make any money off this, I am only trying to make it easy for people like me (with long commutes) to enjoy this particular radio show without having to navigate the existing (dysfunctional) site- risking the lives of dogs, squirrels, and other drivers in the process.\n\nA: It's not a podcast if they just upload files and tell you where to find them. The whole point of a podcast is that they are referenced explicitly in a feed of some manner, such that a utility can automatically make them available in whatever manner you need.\nLike iTunes for example. It (by default) updates the feed occasionally, and downloads new episodes when they're available, suitable for immediate listening, or sync'ing and listening on-the-go.\nAnything else is just silly, and probably means the site operator doesn't really know what they're doing.\n\nA: There are tons of apps on the store that help with podcasting without having to re-host the files.\nHave you looked at Podcaster? \nAs to hosting them - it's a fine line between you being allowed to download the podcast to your mac and then stream it (time shifting) or sync it (space shift or a copy) to a device to listen away from the computer. If the files are reasonably secured and only accessed to you (so you are not rebroadcasting them to others) you should be on fine ground to defend your actions if anyone decided to sue you.\nI would say do whatever makes you the safest on the road so a well designed app to stream from the main server seems like a no-brainer to me rather than setting up a server and re-hosting the files whether or not it's legal.\n", "Q: Reset Mac OS X Bluetooth service? Any way to do this either via a utility, command-line, or otherwise? I regularly have my headphones and moused paired which causes the Bluetooth service to crash nearly daily. Sometimes I can just repair the devices but other times the service breaks completely. When that happens I have to reboot; very annoying indeed.\nIs there a \"Factory Reset\" option for Apple Bluetooth keyboard, mouse, trackpad?\n\nA: There's a command-line tool for the bluetooth service called blueutil — you could try if it can help you.\nAlternatively, you could reload blued:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\n\nThis should first kill the service if it's still on and the second enables it again.\nI don't know if this fixes your problem, since I don't have BT service dying on me to test it :)\n\nA: This (and only this) worked for me besides restarting my machine. \nFrom Restart Bluetooth Daemon on Mac OS X without restarting\nsudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\nsudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\n\n\nA: Go to the Activity Monitor, and under process names there should be one called \"blued\", click it, then \"Quit Process\", Force Quit, then the bluetooth service should have restarted on its own.\n\nA: On newer OS X, you can access these advanced features from the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. Hold shift and option (only) when clicking on the icon:\n\nThe debug menu has most of the action oriented items you'll need:\n\nI've never seen resetting the module work better than powering it off, but I'm sure theres cases where that saves a trip to the repair shop.\nLogging is useful, but the logs are very very large, so keep that in mind and set a reminder to turn it off tomorrow.\nOn older OS, you needed a developer tool to systematically remove pairing records and HID devices. Bluetooth Explorer ships with Xcode 3. (as of today, early June 2011 - this is something available at no cost if you agree to the terms of the free developer program. It might also be bundled with Xcode 4 - available with paid download or paid mac developer program -  but I can't vouch for that) You can also browse the developer documentation for free to learn more about bluetooth implementation.\nThe explorer has a detailed window with many settings to automate resetting devices for testing. Here is a portion of the window showing that not only are the local mac settings cleared, it will reach out to Apple Bluetooth devices and reset their internal state as well.\n\nSince bluetooth has to start very soon in the boot process (and is part of the setup assistant since new macs that have no accounts have to know how to set up Bluetooth keyboards and mouse out of the box) it's not just a simple user preference file but instead a system level preference and stored in several locations.\nYou will be able to make your mac factory fresh to test bluetooth with the Bluetooth Explorer.\n", "Q: Smart Cover back uncovered issues? Are there issues while using a Smart Cover for the iPad 2 arising due to the fact that the cover only covers the front?\n(Not a buying recommendation, just a question about a specific plausible issue with a peripheral.)\n\nA: One of the main reasons people would go with a Smart Cover over a full case is to avoid adding extra bulk.  The Smart Cover provides good protection for the screen at a minimal size/weight cost.\nI use an iPad 2 with a Smart Cover daily, and it's really a great alternative to a case in my opinion.  To provide extra protection without bulk, I have added an InvisibleShield (thin scratchproof film) to the front and back of the iPad.\nThat said, if you are clumsy or will be using your iPad in more hazardous environments, you should probably go with a full case.\n", "Q: Is there a preference file where MobileMe username and password are saved? I am looking for a preference file that contains the MobileMe username/password couple that I would need to pass to a script that starts the MobileMe synchronization. What I am trying to achieve is to start the synchronization when some conditions are verified, and disable the automatic synchronization that is started from the Mac OS X.\nIs there a preference file that contains the MobileMe credentials for the currently logged in user?\n\nA: On Mac computers, no password information is stored in plain-text preference files -- it's all kept securely in the Keychain, which you can view using the Keychain Access utility.\n", "Q: What is the best way to listen to music in my shower/bathroom from iTunes? I have all of my music catalogged in iTunes, and have no intentions of changing the software I use to listen to it. Therefore, I came here to gain some advice on the easiest/cheapest way to listen to my music in my shower. It's a big plus if I can use a remote to change the song while showering. Previously, I used my iPod touch docked in batter-powered speakers placed on my bathroom counter. The speakers had an included remote. This method worked great, but my iPod has since been broken and I do not think it was a great idea to expose it to the high-levels of water vapor in the first place. Would the cheapest method be purchasing another iPod? Or would an Air-play supported speaker system be the best option?\n\nA: You generally shouldn't bring any electronics into an area with that much water vapor on a regular basis unless they are labeled for such use.\nIf you search for waterproof speakers on Amazon you'll find many affordable options, including several that are designed specifically for iPods.\n\nA: Airport Express + Waterproof speakers (mounted).

I lifted the keys that had got soiled by the chocolate. I took out one of the scissors but that is not necessary because I could clean the other scissors thoroughly while still on the assembly. I took cotton swabs and lightly dipped on that alcohol I mentioned and dried them. I washed the keys I had plucked from the keyboard with warm water to get all the stains out. After drying them well I assembled them and turned on the computer. In fact, this is the same keyboard I am typing from.\nI think you all can try this. I was absolutely lucky because the chocolate did not ruin anything. The liquid sensors on the touchpad and the keyboard had turned red which means the liquid had come through.

I can’t take it in yet for a battery change (which most people say is the cause for the keys spat-zing out), and I still need it for work.\nThe best go in-between was getting a wired keyboard to use with it. I thought of going for a wireless option but couldn’t find one. Either way, I was so happy to finally be able to type out all letters without having to copy and paste them, you can just imagine how arduous that was!\nThe wired keyboard worked excellently for about a month now, up until today when the shift, ctrl, a, q, w, z, x, c, v, m, n, and full stop keys would just type out some random symbols. I have literally spent the whole day researching and trying out every troubleshooting solution suggested. Funny how few cover Macbooks, so I was just trying whatever I could.\nI even just updated my OS but that did not solve the problem. I was this close to popping the back open and unwiring the keyboard connector, as some have suggested, but then I thought, why don’t I clean up the USB ports. \nGuess what, that did the trick. I also toggled around with the Options buttons of my actual Macbook keyboard like some had suggested in case they are stuck, and most of the keys on the onboard keyboard are working too!\nSo, I had to come back and share, albeit a long story. I just hope that it can help someone not waste an entire day like I had to. \n\nA: In my case, I have an external keyboard which started doing this (Keychron K6).\nThe keyboard has a switch for selecting between MacOS keys and Windows keys.\nI realised that the switch was not 100% set on the MacOS option. Fixing that sorted out this issue.\n", "Q: What is meant by Lemon Experience? I am not sure that is this the place to ask this question, but I heard of Lemon Experience on Mac. What does it mean? is it some hardware failure or software issue?\n\nA: I believe the phrase you've heard is probably in reference to a faulty/dud piece of equipment, as per the definition:\n\"(informal) a person or thing, esp. an automobile,\nregarded as unsatisfactory, disappointing, or feeble\"\n\nI don't think it's something Apple or Mac specific, and in fact is probably more often used with non Apple products.\n\nA: In the US there is a body of law known as \"lemon laws\" that arose from car sales.

(Can FCE scrub MTS files?)\n\nA: You can import the raw video through whatever means you like, and utilize Handbrake ([enter link description here][1]) to transcode it to mp4 format, which iMovie can use. This way, you can make use of the H.264 codec to encode your 1080i videos, retaining full quality, and compressing them better than Apple's compression schemes. Personally, however, as one video guy to another, if you're going to deal with a lot of HD, just shell out the cash for a bigger drive, like an external or something. It'll save you headaches in the long run, trust me.\nGood luck and happy transcoding!\n", "Q: Where does DoodleCam save photos I have download an app called DoodleCam.

What purpose has the admin user account? If I'm installing something via console (as a normal user, not admin) I have apparently to log in as admin and then log in as root user (via sudo -s because su strangely doesn't work).\nDoes anyone know what the main reason for this is or how to fix it?\n\nA: This is by design. A non-admin user is defined by not being able to use sudo (and the graphical equivalent in the mac windowmanager). You can still enter the admin user and password using sudo -u or the graphical equivalent but short of compromising/modifying the built in controls, that's how the system is designed to work.\nThe su command doesn't work as you expect since the root user in Mac OS X is disabled by default for security reasons. Sudo has enhanced logging and sudo -s gets you the same shell as su - would when a root user is enabled.\nSo if you don't want to change to using sudo you can enable root on your mac.\n", "Q: Erase all personal settings from mac I want to leave the software on my mac and the profile and all that but I want to erase all passwords and history and personal settings from the mac so that a new colleague can use it?\n\nA: The safest way to do that is to encrypt your account with File Vault and then create a new account for the new user. Then it doesn't matter if he has admin access he can't ever access your files without your password.\nEven erasing the account doesn't really get rid of the files. They could be recovered with a file recovery program. File Vault is the easiest way to keep things private.\n\nA: Simply create a new user account in System Preferences -> Accounts.  The new user won't have access to any of your personal data from your account.\nIf you're sure you won't be using that computer any more and you have a copy of all your data that's important to you, you can delete your own account from the new account afterwards.\nEDIT:\nI think this is overkill for most cases because creating a separate account will already protect against casual snooping.  But if you're really worried about the colleague trying to access your files, the best option is to do a multiple-pass, low-level format of the hard drive (Disk Utility can do this when booting from the OS X install disc), then reinstall a clean copy of OS X.  That will take about 30 extra minutes of your time and provide complete peace of mind.\nProtecting your account with FileVault would provide good security, but if you're never going to use the system again, you should really get your data off the machine.\n\nA: This answer on how to restore a mac to a factory fresh appearance will do the trick for you. Secure erasing your old user folder or using Disk Utility to wipe all the free space would be a good precaution if you want to be sure the data is overwritten (barring an SSD being installed). \n", "Q: How do I modify Word 2011 for Mac so I can see tracked changes inline and notes simultaneously? Background: \nIn Word 2011 for the Mac, it's possible to view tracked changes inline -- that is, see the changes made on the screen within the text itself, as opposed seeing them in a balloon off to the side. (Such a balloon would read \"Text deleted - \"on the screen\".) \nHowever, there's currently no way of doing this while simultaneously viewing comments. \nYou can view comments as well as changes simultaneously, but the only way to do this is in balloons off to the side, so you have balloons reading \"This text is confusing because [reason]\" and also ones saying \"text deleted - [foo]\". This is extremely confusing. \nTo clarify, here are some threads on the MS forums about this: \n\n\n*\n\n*tracking changes and comments\n\n*Track Changes Office 2011\nMy question: \nIt's pretty clear there's no workaround that will allow authors and editors to view changes inline, while simultaneously seeing notes with their pointers to the text being referred to. (Seeing notes within the reviewing pane while in draft view doesn't work, since you can't easily tell which notes relate to what text.) Is it possible to use VBA to change this behavior in Word on the Mac? Or would this simply break in future revisions?\nThis is an important missing feature in Word for the Mac. (You can do this in Word for Windows.) Reading through the above threads, this has been the case for the last two major versions Word for the Mac. \nI'll consider add-ons, scripting, pretty much anything that won't destabilize my system. (If the answer is that this is impossible, well, I won't be happy, but at least I'll know.)\n(I'm running a MacBook Pro with OSX 10.6.7 if that helps. Currently running Word 2011, v.14.0.1.) \n\nA: You can get pretty close to what you want by turning off balloons. \nIn the \"Track Changes\" section of Word's preferences, uncheck the button that says \"Use balloons to display changes.\" \n\nNow additions and deletions are shown inline, and comments are shown as highlights with a reference.\n\nYou can view the comments by hovering over the highlight.\n\nOr, you can display the \"Review Pane\" and view the comments (with additions and deletions interspersed) over there. Less distracting than balloons, though.\n", "Q: Iphone 3G Games I play Tap ranch which at times gives free points for downloading free apps.

Thanks for helping. \n\nA: My understanding is the device UDID is being sent in to the servers for each game. \n \nJust click on the serial number in iTunes to reveal your UDID.\nThey see that your device showed up as a first launch of that game, so they don't actually know that you bought the app today and downloaded it.

Is there a way to add songs to iTunes and avoid make duplicates in the process ? I've a couple of macs and I want to merge all my songs on 1 mac and then be using home sharing...\nIs it possible to avoid duplicating all the songs that are already in the \"destination\" iTunes Library ?\n\nA: You should have a look at the utility \"Dupin\", it allows to check for bunches of duplicates and resolve the conflicts.\nI would test it for a few duplicates so you see how it works, and then I would just import everything and clean afterwards.\n\nA: iTunes will only create one entry in your Library for each music file on your computer.  In other words, if you try to \"re-add\" any file to your library that is already being managed by iTunes, iTunes will not make a duplicate.\nIf you have duplicate music files between the two computers, that is a much more complicated issue to handle automatically.  One method involves using rsync.  Be aware that with any automated merge method, it's always possible that you might lose your iTunes metadata (playlists, ratings, play counts, etc) -- and even having backups might not help you recover it easily.\nPersonally, I would manually add files from the smaller library to the larger library a little bit at a time and think of it as an opportunity to re-organize my music collection and get rid of music I don't listen to anymore.\n\nA: When you import a song from a CD or download a song from the Internet, the song file is placed here:\nHome/Music/iTunes\nWhen you add an item already on your computer to your iTunes library by dragging the file to the iTunes window or choosing File > Add to Library, iTunes places a copy of the file in your iTunes folder. The original file remains in its current location.\nYou can change this setting so that the item appears in iTunes without being added to the iTunes folder. You might want to do this so that, for example, you could save video files in a location other than your hard disk.\nTo add files to your library without adding them to your iTunes folder:\nChoose iTunes > Preferences, and click Advanced.\nDeselect the “Copy files” checkbox.\nFrom now on, when you drag a file to your library or choose File > Add to Library, the item appears in iTunes, but the actual file isn’t copied or moved.\nTip:   You can temporarily reverse this setting by holding down the Option key while you drag files to the iTunes window.\n\nA: I created this Mac OS X service that imports files/folders into iTunes, while skipping over already-imported files.\nIt won't stop importing of duplicate files (i.e., if the same file is in two different directories), but it should do the trick if you've copied all of the files into the same directory first.\n", "Q: How to upgrade a jailbreak iOS without loosing Cydia applications?

The iOS app was good.\nTrillian is a great application on both iOS and OSX but has some stupidities built in (like the copy to clipboard bug I mentioned earlier).\nWhat I'm actually looking for is something better than Trillian.\nPS: since I'm a developer, open-source is a plus\n\nA: I'm not sure about the unified session requirement - I've never seen that in any IM client.\nHowever, I find Adium (http://adium.im/) is the best Mac IM application (and it's open source!).\nAs for the iPhone, have you considered IM+ (http://www.shapeservices.com)?

Anybody have something like that hooked up yet for watching TV and other content on demand?  I've tried pvr's from Tivo and Windows Media Center and they have their shortcomings.  I'd like to have TV recorded on a server and accessible anywhere in the house.  At the TV I'd like to use an Apple TV to access it.\n\nA: You could jailbreak your Apple TV and install Plex or XBMC and point them at your files. As new files are added, they should find them and let you play them. The nice thing with these two applications is that they will play a lot more than what Apple has decided the Apple TV will play on its own. \nIf you don't jailbreak your Apple TV, the only way to accomplish anything close to what you are after is to use iTunes Home Sharing. Unfortunately this requires another computer with iTunes running in order to connect and serve content. (It does, however, work quite well, as I can attest, having done this with most of my media content.) Since you want to get at TV content, it would have to be stored in a form that iTunes would import (and you would have to figure out a way to import it automatically). At that point, you are probably going to find the jailbreak route the easier and better of the two.\nIf you are looking for a direct interface from the Apple TV to manage the recording process (e.g., as in a Tivo-like recording interface), I know of nothing that does this, yet. The jailbreaking scene for the Apple TV (2nd generation) is still pretty new, but they are doing new things every day.\n\nA: I use a Mac Mini with EyeTV.

Next week when I download more I'd like to add them to the CD (if there's space) in a directory called \"podcasts-2\".\nI used to do this on a Windows box using DeepBurner. It super simple but for some reason I've had no luck on my new Macbook Pro. I tried creating a \"new image from folder\" using the Disk Utility application but that didn't play in the car.\n\nA: You should use iTunes to burn the MP3 CDs. If I remember correctly, MP3 CDs are very slightly more complicated than just a folder on MP3s on a CD. iTunes does an excellent job. I've also had luck with LiquidCD.\n", "Q: Installing the most recent version of Ruby on Snow Leopard I downloaded and compiled the latest version of ruby 1.9.2 which was installed in /usr/local/bin/ruby, however the system officially recognizes /usr/bin/ruby which is only 1.8.7 which came installed on the machine. How can I get the new ruby into place?\nIn this instance I need to replace the ruby version and be able to use the updated version for command line work and rails development.\n\nA: You should use RVM, the Ruby Version Manager. It allows multiple side-by-side installations of Ruby without affecting the system Ruby installation, which as another commenter pointed out can potentially be problematic (or at the very least, tiresome to maintain).\nIt allows you to quickly and easily install the latest patchlevel of Ruby, past Ruby versions, or even alternate implementations like JRuby, MacRuby, or Rubinius.\nTo install:\n$ bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)\n\nOnce it's installed, setting 1.9.2 as the default is as simple as typing:\nrvm default 1.9.2\n\nAnd if you feel like switching back to 1.8.7 temporarily:\nrvm use 1.8.7\n\n\nA: What do you mean by \"get the new Ruby into place\"?\nIf you are trying to run it from the command line using just the command ruby, the system will search each of the paths specified in /etc/paths in order until it finds a match.  In Snow Leopard, the default /etc/paths file looks like this:\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n/usr/local/bin\n\nSo when you enter ruby at the command line, the system looks for /usr/bin/ruby first, finds it, and doesn't check the rest of the paths (so it never gets to /usr/local/bin/ruby).  To confirm this, you can enter which ruby at the command line, and the system will print the path of the executable that it would use for that command.\nIf you want to run your newer version of Ruby from the command line, simply enter /usr/local/bin/ruby instead of ruby.\nIf you are using another program that is using Ruby indirectly, there's probably an option somewhere to specify the path to ruby.\n\nEDIT: As a last resort, you can overwrite the built-in system version of Ruby with your newer version.  Use the following commands, and enter your administrator password when prompted:\ncp /usr/bin/ruby ~/Desktop/ruby_OLD\nsudo cp /usr/local/bin/ruby /usr/bin/ruby\n\nIf something breaks, put it back with this command:\nsudo mv ~/Desktop/ruby_OLD /usr/bin/ruby\n\nAs others have mentioned, though, using a tool like RVM to manage Ruby would be a better idea than upgrading the built-in installation.\n\nA: The way to get any self installed program to be found before an Apple supplied ome is to add the directory of the new program (e.g. /usr/local/bin) to the fromt of the PATH environment variable.\nIf you are running ruby from the shell edit ~/.profile or if from a GUI ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist\n\nA: If you truly want to replace the existing /usr/bin/ruby (which is simply a sym link to /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/Current/usr/bin/ruby ) just overwrite the existing file with the one you compiled being careful to match file permissions.\nThe reasons to not do this are many, but it's that simple given a literal interpretation of your question.\nMost people change their path to include the newer ruby before the system one since that is simpler and less likely to break other things that depend on the installed version of ruby and associated dylib, gems, rdocs, and such remaining the same.\nOne of the benefits of homebrew and fink and RVM and MacPorts is that they help automate the staging to an alternate location and support modifying your path.\nYou can do the same with the ruby you have in /usr/local/bin by manipulating your path variable and using which -a ruby to double check your work afterwards.\n\nA: You might want to take a look at Homebrew, which makes it easy to install the latest Ruby - brew install ruby is all you need - and many other packages without interfering with anything already on your system, to a location that's (almost certainly) already in your $PATH.\n", "Q: computer boots up and fades to blue repeatedly I have a MacBook Pro running 10.4.11 from 2006 or 2007 with a problem during start-up.  The computer will boot and then after showing the desktop, menu bar, and dock (but before icons appear on the desktop), the screen will fade to blue.  After a few seconds the desktop will reappear and then fade to blue again.  This cycle continues repeatedly.  Does anyone have any ideas?  Thanks.\n\nA: Had a similar issue recently.  Try zapping the PRAM, it worked for me.  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379\n\nA: That sounds like a very strange problem.  First of all, if your system is ever running well enough to let you use it, try checking the Console (/Applications/Utilities/Console.app) for any error messages that might shed some light on the problem.\nIt's tough to diagnose without seeing the problem firsthand, but from my own personal experience, I might suspect overheating, as the first visible sign is often quirky display issues.  Your MacBook Pro is definitely old enough to have accumulated a lot of dust and other gunk inside which can cause ventilation problems and lead to overheating very quickly.\nDoes this problem happen every single time you boot the machine, regardless of how long it has been turned off?  Does the display respond to input at any time during the strange cycling?  (Can you move the mouse cursor around, and does it stay where you put it?)\nIf you are lucky enough to have an Apple Store nearby, you could have it checked out at the Genius Bar (make an appointment first) -- though they won't fix it for free because it's definitely out of warranty by now.\n\nA: Yes - as long as this happens each and every time, you will be able to figure out what process is crashing fairly easily. It will likely be logged in /private/var/log/system.log and the console log but the messages may be obscure or hard to discern from \"the normal noise\". You might try a few steps to isolate the issue further before attempting a fix.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into safe mode\n\n*Make a new admin account (for debugging)\n\n*Turn off auto-log in (so you have more control)\n\n\nNow when you reboot your mac - you can log into the new account and see if the system itself is crashing or if the user account has problems. Assuming the new account is fine, then log out and log in to the old account with the blue screen issue. Sometimes just a safe boot clears out some bad startup items and fixes this issue - other times it's related to the changes you have made to the account over time and you will have to take further action to remedy the failure.\nOnce you've narrowed down the cause to being system-level or user-level you can then proceed on the steps to fix. The process to fix these differ, but in a nutshell: user issues get fixed by disabling whatever is crashing or moving just the user files that are not corrupt to a new user (by hand or via archive install and not preserving the user folders) Archive install and preserving will usually correct a system issue in the unlikely case that the new user has the same looping blue screen as the existing user.\n", "Q: What's the best way to use IRC on the mac?

It happens even when there is not app running. I don't know if it's an heating problem or just the fans that are randomly triggered...\nDoes someone else encountered this weird behavior since a couple of months ?\nEDIT : In fact, it seems that this problem has nothing to do with OS X upgrade. The problem is an heating problem and it related to some flash video reader that takes all the CPU power to display the video.\n\nA: Airflow are certainly dirty. You can check it by opening your MBP. Find your model at iFixit and follow guides to access right and left fans.\n\nA: Flash also gets my MacBook's fans blowing after just a couple of minutes. I block it in my browser, but still need it sometimes. Not sure that anything's changed, though new versions of the Flash player (and the one built into Chrome) have certainly come out. \nFlashBlock is your friend for Chrome, ClickToFlash is your friend for Safari, and a different FlashBlock is your friend for Firefox.\n\nA: Spotlight also revs up the fans.  Usually this means that something is writing to your filesystem.

(slot-in drive) I tried everything on this page: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=mac/10.4/en/mh1750.html except Open Firmware (Intel macs doesn't support this).\nThen I tried using the terminal but this didn't work either.\nEvery time I bootup my mac the drive tries to eject it but it can't. I ran the Apple Hardware Test (hold d on startup) and it sayed that all is fine. (it also tested the slot in drive).\nAnd I put my mac upside down and booted it up (hoped that the cd could come out) but it didn't work. (same problem)\nHow can I get that out of my slot in drive? Mayby with a tweezer?\nAny ideas?\nPS: in finder there's no visible cd and in the diskutility there's nothing too\n\nA: Recent Apple portable optical drives (i.e. anything < 5 yrs old and not a Mac Pro) no longer have the \"paper clip\" levers so your best bet is to take it to a technician that is able to open the mac and safely retrieve the stuck media. If you are curious, iFixit does publish fairly good mac repair guides so you decide to pay someone or DIY. You'll have better luck trying to trigger the eject lever deeper in the right hand side with something thinner than a ruler.\nThe mechanism is obviously stuck or obstructed if you hear it trying to eject when the software commands an eject.\nForcing things more often causes additional damage rather than somehow inducing the internal eject mechanism to work again. If you are gentle and can tickle the eject lever or gently guide the CD out, your chances of success are that much higher. The cases where a light touch won't work is a signal that permanent damage to the device or the media is imminent.\nIt's almost always cheaper to buy a USB external if the internal breaks, so factor that into your calculation if you just want to yank out the stuck drive no matter the long term health of your optical drive.\n\nA: This article from Apple explains how to troubleshoot slot loading drive problems http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2801?viewlocale=en_US\nTry rebooting the MacBook while holding the trackpad button down, it should eject the disk shortly after booting\n\nA: On the right hand side of the drive, behind the slot, is actually a little switch you can hit with a paper clip that has been straightened. \nYou aren't really going to see it, but the best way is to take the paper clip, but it up against the side of the slot, then push in. It should hit a little switch, and continue to push a little more and the disk should slide out. \nIt would be somewhat like this older iMac article, but you won't be able to see it due to the fabric or whatever that is on the slot. \nJust be very careful while doing this. Ive done it a dozen times between Minis, PowerBooks, MacBooks, iMacs, etc. \nEdit: This link on MacRumors defines the process as well. \n\nA: Once I've managed to overcome this problem with a pice of cardboard. I inserted the cardboard in the CD slot and made sure to hold the CD by pressing it down. When I rebooted the Mac it actually tried to read the CD and since it was stuck it ejected the disk out. Now I'm not sure if this would work in your case but wouldn't be that difficult to try without damaging the CD disk.\n\nA: Try ejecting the CD from within Disk Utility.app\n\nA: I have a mid-2010 Mac mini, and a new CD became stuck in the optical drive after importing its tracks to iTunes.  The Mac software was telling the drive to eject the disk, and I could hear it trying, but the disk would not come out of the drive slot.  Something was blocking it.  It was clearly a mechanical problem, and something inside was blocking the disk from ejecting properly.\nWith computer shutdown and the power cord disconnected, I finally tried a smooth plastic membership card (like a credit card with no raised lettering on top).  I gently slipped the short edge of the card straight into the right side of the slot (about a third of the length of the card).  I could feel it slide over the obstruction, and felt and heard the obstruction move a little (then I could hear it \"click\" up and down again, as I slid the card in and out very gently, so it apparently it had become stuck in the \"up\" position and wasn't retracting down properly).\nThen I plugged in the power cord and booted.  After I logged in, I selected the optical drive, and did a normal Eject operation.  The disk popped right out, as it should.\nI seldom use the optical drive, and this Mac mini has been running almost continuously for 3 years now as a media hub in my home network.

In OS X there is a lock icon in the lower right of the Get Info screen.  What is this icon called?  What does clicking this icon do?  \n\nI am running on an account with administrator access. I have the ability to change permissions of some folders (one on my desktop) but not others (one in the Applications folder).  The \"lock\" is locked in both cases.  When I tried to Terminal → su → chmod the folder in Applications I still had no luck, until I pressed the 'lock' button.\n\nA: Clicking the lock icon will prompt you for an admin password.  After you provide it, the system will allow you to change the permissions for that file or folder in that \"Sharing & Permissions\" pane you see at the bottom of the Get Info window.  This is a feature of the underlying Unix operating system that allows different privileges for a user, group, and others.\nNote that you are always allowed to change permissions (whether the icon is locked or unlocked) when you (your user) is the owner of the file -- e.g. most of the files in your own user folder such as your Desktop and Documents folders.  But when you are not the owner, you'll have to unlock this option to change the permissions.\nThere's a reason this feature is \"locked\" against casual access.  It's not really something you want to touch if you're not very sure what you're doing.  Messing with permissions can cause access problems, security problems, or both.\nFor more details, check out this Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_permissions#Traditional_Unix_permissions\n", "Q: What happens at the user/OS level when an SSD finally wears out? I have been reading up on SSD technology current as of 2011 and don't know of any first hand reports on what happens when an SSD eventually fails due to over use. I am most interested in the SSD that apple includes as a factory option - but aftermarket information is certainly welcome. \nIf there are no overt signs of aging and wear, might it be possible to measure how much extra storage space remains to cover for failures and wear leveling? (assuming the SSD controller will pool memory and avoid bad/overused blocks before failure)\nI am somewhat familiar with failure modes of hard drive storage but looking for similarities or differences between HDD and SSD. For example, the OS can detect (presumably using fsck and journaling) problems writing new data reliably to a HDD and warns you the drive is now mounted in read only mode. Tools like Drive Genius allow all sorts of testing specific to HDD but I'm unaware of tools that dig into SSD for whatever data may be available.\nRather than guessing or predicting how long an SSD will last, are there objective measures we can take to document how storage is aging and check in on wear leveling statistics to measure what happens when SSD are close to the end of their useful lives?\n\nA: \n\"Does it just get slower and slower\n  running garbage collection more and\n  more often trying to find a place to\n  store data as the flash storage system\n  degrades?\"\n\n^^ This is what I've seen on two occasions (Aftermarkets tho, possibly the same in Apple drives).\nThey didn't entirely stop working because I eventually replaced them, since things become like a Windows XP after three years of use and no maintenance.\nAnother SSD I remember failing did it probably from day three, when it failed to mount on a few occasions. Then it failed to mount again later the same day until it eventually never mounted again. It was under warranty and I replaced it. \nThe SSDs I still have (non Apple) don't show signs of shrink, probably because the space you lose is not a lot compared to the size of the drive. I'm guessing that would be the case. \nAlthough drives tend to live 2-3 years (SSDs), I'd say be prepared for a -possible- change after 1 year.\n\nA: My aftermarket Intel SSD had a bad sector, which was reported by Disk Utility.  From my understanding, the SSD will get slower and eventually have more bad sectors, which will be noticed if you do a Disk Utility scan.\nWarnings because of SMART-data reporting more disk errors than acceptable aren't build into the OS, as far as I know. Disk Utility does show SMART errors, but not in much detail. Tools like SMARTReporter will give you warnings when your SSD is degrading.\n\nA: After 4 years of abusing all manner of Apple selected SSD, I can conclusively say that the drives I have used are more reliable than HDD and have exhibited none of the potential drawbacks or cost associated with HDD failure modes in practice.\nFor the first few computers I purchased, I did pay for AppleCare for several reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*I had decent discounts on it\n\n*I figured I would probably push the SSD harder than the average user and I was happy placing the risk and responsibility on Apple to repair my Mac should I choose to use it too much.\n\n*I wasn't confident that third party SSD repair parts would be viable\n\n\nThe last two years, I have not gotten AppleCare and still am very happy with SSD. My macs run the following programs routinely and exercise the storage to the 80% full level:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes match and now music constantly adds offline songs and removes them as I fill up the drive\n\n*I use local snapshots for Time Machine which also keeps all manner of file around until I reach a low storage point and backup files get purged programmatically by the OS\n\n*Splunk - ingesting and storing system logs from multiple macs - this tool is high IO\n\n*LAMP/MEAN stack running pretty much constantly\n\n*Xcode - moderate use\n\n*Virtual Machines - moderate use\n\n\nI haven't yet had a failure, so my results are that the SSD are over engineered and other components will fail before the drive. Of course some people will see failures, but that those are both rare and less than the HDD failures people had to deal with in the past.\nMy advice would be to not place any extra thought on SSD durability for OS X/Mac hardware and just size your computer for your storage size needs and your speed requirements. If you get AppleCare and 3 years of Apple backing the drive, great. If you don't and then have to pay for a repair or pay for a third party SSD replacement, great too.\n", "Q: How to contact Apple for the Mac store billing support? I've recently registered to the Mac Store and provided the credit card though I didn't plan to buy anything immediately. Some people say that there is an option \"no card\" when registering, but I didn't know that, so whatever.\nAfter the registration I was charged 2 euros, without any explanations.\nI've searched throughout the Apple's website but I cannot find any way to contact the support. I am all the way redirected to some manuals, while the support with the real people seems to be available for the devises' sales only.\nAll of this is not about the 2 euros, but about the disappointing experience.\n\nA: It's a three step process - with pictures below!\n\n\n*\n\n*Click support in the Quick Links tab\non the right hand side of the App\nStore app.\n\n*Click billing in the web page\nthat opened as a result of step 1.\n\n*Feed in all the information and wait\nthe 24 hours or so it takes to get\nan initial response.\n\n\nIt is so worth it to ask for a refund or help (especially in your case where you didn't intend to buy yet) - everyone wins in the end as developers and Apple really don't want a sale that ends up with an unsatisfied customer. \nThe system is not perfect nor is it set up to allow previews of purchases, so no one should feel bad requesting a refund or two. Especially so if the program wasn't explained well or is seriously faulty. Would you want a $ and change if it made someone have a lasting bad impression of the work for which you get paid?\nDo feel bad if you find yourself abusing the system or on your 10th refund request with no good reason and just not getting the picture.\n\n\n\nA: Try this form: Mac App Store Customer Service\n\nA: Mac App Store Customer Service\nIn my experience, they do a great job.\n\nA: The link has already been given in other answers.\nDid you check in the Purchasedsection of the App Store application? If something has been bought, it has to be there and it will be a valuable information to add when filing your complaint, whether there is something or not.\n\nA: If you got emailed a receipt from Apple or itunes.com for the charge on your credit card, there is a URL link next to each item on the receipt, entitled \"Report a Problem\".  Use that link to report a problem.\nIf you do not get a receipt from Apple or itunes.com after a few days, you may want to have your bank check for some sort of fraudulent activity.  Also make sure you have a properly secure password on your iTunes account.\n", "Q: Why is syslog not logging where I tell it to log? I've configured syslogd like so:\n*.debug /var/log/messages\n\nI want pretty much everything logged in /var/log/messages. \nWhen I run\nsyslog -s hello\n\nI get the message showing up in /var/log/message.\nI tried restarting syslog using\nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist\nps -x | grep [s]yslog\n\nto check that syslog is not running, then\nlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist\n\nto restart.\nI checked /etc/syslog.conf to make sure it doesn't change, and it doesn't. Still I get messages logged to /var/log/message.\nIs there another place to set this?\n\nA: I can confirm the following worked on my Mac running 10.6.7:\nI added the following line to /etc/syslog.conf (where <tab> is a tab character):\n*.debug<tab>/var/log/messages\n\nI HUP'd the syslogd process using sudo kill -HUP <syslogd pid>.\nAnd tested it with logger -p debug test_msg and syslog -s hello.\nsyslog created /var/log/messages on the fly as I used the logger and syslog commands.\nThe man page for syslog.conf(5) specifies the use of tabs between the fields.  However, I tried using a single space instead and that worked as well.  Based on the man pages for syslog and syslogd, /etc/syslog.conf appears to be the only configuration file you need to worry about.\n\nA: Thanks. After using vi to create the file instead of a python script, I noticed that it was logging as expected. I did a diff of the files and noticed one had a newline while the other did not. Apple must remove the last character of the file expecting it to be a newline, which is why without the newline it logged to /var/log/message instead of /var/log/messages. I have fixed the python script. Your note about the tab made me try the diff on the file, so thanks!\n", "Q: Dock Notifications Displaying Odd Red Icons Instead Having an odd issue.

I've not worked out getting microphone input to the iPhone but am guessing it's might not be possible. \n\nA: You could use http://www.airserverapp.com/ .

I am looking for information about what macs are considered unibody and wondering if there are any notable advantages and/or disadvantages to this fabrication style. \nAnswers that address marketing material as well as lifecycle data or experiences for largish deployments of macs with real life failure rates or data would be great to read.\n\nA: The unibody design makes the case lighter and stronger. Since it is machined, there is minimal error in the creation of the case. For more information, watch the video on http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/design.html. The first unibody MacBook Pro was the 15\" model released in 2008 and had a removable battery. I believe that all other unibody models (and only unibody models) have integrated, non-removable batteries.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Charger has stopped working properly - any short-term fixes? I have a MacBook Pro 15\", about a year old. Today, the charger started working only intermittently. I've seen a few other people talking about similar problems, and most people say it's a problem with the charger.\nHowever, I'm on a working holiday and the only Apple suppliers in this city are very expensive. If I have to, I'll buy a new power adapter, but I'm hoping somebody might know some fixes I can use to get me through the next couple of weeks until I'm back in the UK.\n\nA: This is a very common problem and has happened to me twice in the past -- unfortunately the adapters are very fragile at the tip.\nApart from getting it replaced, you can try gently wiggling the thin wire connection right where it meets the metal adapter tip.  Pushing it in towards the computer can also help.  Sometimes it will start working again if it's in just the right position, but it's easy to knock out of place again.  Either way, it will be difficult to live with for two weeks.  :[\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, the gentle wiggling/pushing should be done while the adapter is attached to the computer.  You can judge your success by whether or not the computer starts/stays charging.  Keep the computer on a stable surface while you do this, and if you get it working, don't touch it -- or it will likely stop working again.\n", "Q: Image files organizer for OS X Is there a good image file organizer for OS X? \nI'm looking for something with good previews for image files, and that will allow me to tag the files.\n\nA: I use Adobe Bridge, which comes with lots of Adobe apps (list, starting at $250).\nIt does all you want, and a lot of other stuff too.\nSome of my favorite features, other than those that you mentioned:\n\n\n*\n\n*Full-screen previews\n\n*Powerful batch renaming\n\n*Cache export\n\n*Configurability / flexibility\n\n*Speed\n\n\nAnother option is Adobe Lightroom ($250). It combines a Bridge-like manager with a reasonably-powerful editor.\n\nI realize that Bridge and Lightroom certainly aren't free, but Bridge really is my favorite image manager.\nIf you want something that's free, the built-in iPhoto app is a good option, although it's far less powerful. It's got some nice features like face recognition and location-based sorting.\n\nA: Google Picasa meets most of the requirements you are mentioning - preview, tagging (it is excellent in identifying faces, so listing photos of a person in hundreds of photos is pretty easy with picasa).\nHowever if you are looking for an organizer of both photos & images then Lightroom is the choice. It is not free but productivity gain easily compensates its price.\n\nA: How about Google Picasa? It's free and can manage many image types and it does all that quite efficiently. There are several advantages and disadvantages which I'm sure you can find out by searching in the net but here is a comparison iPhoto vs. Picasa.

I am doing a project on Hispania (an old Roman province) which today is currently Spain. My spell check has switched languages to spanish (for this reason i think). However I need it to be in English because my project is not in Spanish. When i go to Tools>Language... and set it to english it ignores my change in the settings and continues to check in Spanish. Can someone please help me change my settings. Thank you \n\nA: Just to eliminate the possible culprits and short of reinstalling the Office. Please check in you PowerPoint in the Tools > Dictionary ... what language is indicated. If it's Spanish there try to set it to English and see if that helps. Probably after setting this you would better close entirely PowerPoint and then open it again.\n\nA: On those slides where spell check is working in Spanish, select the text on those slides, then do the Tools » Language » English procedure you described above. Language is formatting applied to specific text. You can mix languages sentence by sentence (or even word by word) and if it is appropriately marked, spell check will follow.\n\nA: If you are just annoyed by the feature, you can disable it in Preferences -> Spelling by unchecking the box for Check spelling as you type:\n\nYou can re-enable it after you're done working with this document.\nIf you need to keep English spell check, double-check your system language setting in System Preferences -> Language & Text -> Language.  I doubt this has changed without you noticing, but there's an off chance PowerPoint may be taking its cue from this setting.\nI've always had issues with multiple languages in Microsoft Office, so during installation, I disable all languages except for English.  This would be a surefire solution if you don't need the extra languages, but it would require you to uninstall and reinstall Office.\nFinally, I would strongly encourage you to look into Keynote ($20 through the App Store) as an alternative to PowerPoint.  There would be a bit of a learning curve while you get used to it, but it's quite powerful, the interface is sleek, it runs perfectly, and I find that it's easier to make things \"look nice\" in Keynote than in PowerPoint.  Most U.S. university classrooms will have a video hookup that you can use to run your presentation from a Mac laptop, but if it's not an option for you to run your presentations from your Mac, it can export PowerPoint-compatible files pretty well.\nYou're not struggling with a Microsoft operating system, so why struggle with Microsoft software?\n\nA: Simplest answer / your language tool has defaulted to a language you do not want it to be.  So...\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into TOOLS menu,  \n\n*Select Language..., You will see your list where\nyou have all the standards including Basque, Catalan and Spanish\n(Castellano) etc.   \n\n*Make your choice and select default.\n\n\nYou have now changed your function of spelling for all documents.\nUse this facility to check specific text by first selecting your text and then select the language just don't select default.  This way you can check just a word, a sentence or a whole document easily as advise by a couple of the posts above.\n", "Q: PDF export from Pages document Here is the dilemma that I'm having with the PDF export on Apple Pages. When I export my Apple Pages document into PDF and open it in any PDF viewer (let's just say Preview) then I don't get the TOC on the Sidebar. Just to clarify we are not talking about the cases when you do include TOC in your document and have it in the text of the final PDF. When I look at the Pages PDF Export I can see Thumbnails, Contact Sheet but in TOC I see just the name of the file.\nDoes the Apple Pages PDF Export actually have such a feature to customise the final PDF?\n\nA: Unfortunately Apple's PDF export doesn't create the standard PDF Table of Contents, you'll need to use other software to add one to your existing PDF.\nThere are a variety of options at a variety of prices:\nOpenOffice Writer: A hassle, but it's the only free option I've seen. You'd export your Pages file as Word or rtf and then open it in OpenOffice Writer and then export to PDF; it will generate a PDF table of contents as part of the export.\nPDF Outliner: Just $4.99 in the Mac App Store, it's probably the best combination of cheap and easy. It's specifically designed to add a PDF Table of Contents to your document.\nPDFpenPro: At $99.95 it's not cheap but it does pretty much everything the full version of Adobe Acrobat does and is much, much cheaper.\nAcrobat X Standard: The real thing from Adobe for \"just\" $449.95. If you only need to do this now and you'll be done creating PDF Tables of Contents within 30 days you can download the free trial. After 30 days, though, you're out of luck.\n\nA: Try pressing CMD+Shift+D to show it in Preview but if you're looking for an embedded ToC in the PDF, you'll need to add that.\n", "Q: Can I install OSX on a cracked screen macbook using target disk mode? I'm planning to sell my old macbook that has a cracked screen, but I do want it to go with a fresh install. Obviously, I can't make a new installation using an external monitor since the external monitor won't work when booted from cd. \nSo my question is if it's possible to target (firewire cable and target disk mode) my old macbook's drive from my new mac when doing a fresh installation.\nthanks in advance, \n\nA: Yes I have tried this with both 10.5 and 10.6 and it works fine. \nOr you can try the Remote Install Mac OS X feature in the utilities folder.\n\nA: Overall, there are generally not huge problems using another mac to install the OS on to a target mode drive (same as installing to an external drive). The install will work fine and an OS will be present on the drive, but the areas where this will fail are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a restore DVD on a mac that is a different model (retail OS discs have all drivers for macs requiring a lower build number than the retail disk - restore media have a very specific model's drivers only)\n\n*If the build level is incorrect, the mac may or may not boot properly - and some drivers needed for the mac that eventually runs the OS might not get installed.\n\n*If the installer selects the wrong drivers due to the machine running the install being different than the mac that eventually runs the OS - you may have some problems.\n\n\nBasically, when a new hardware model is released (new thunderbolt, new logic board design, new battery technology in a portable) - that change is introduced into a separate OS build. I have never seen a public listing of these specifics broken down by model number, but over time these special builds generally get merged into the \"main\" OS.\nSince retail OS DVD change versions maybe once or twice a year, there is a window of time where installing the OS from a machine of type A and running that OS on a machine of type B will have issues due to needed drivers being missing from the retail OS DVD. This chance is much larger if you are using the newest macs and installing across product lines (MacPro to Air / iMac to MacBook).\nIn practice, the core OS usually works and you can boot the mac and most of the hardware will work. Also, usually you can download the latest combo update and hope that it pushes updated drivers when it is run, but there is no guarantee that installing the OS on one mac will work for all other macs across the board. \nPeople that run large installations and clone one image on to dozens or hundreds of different macs can attest to the ways this breaks certain hardware from time to time. Recently, iMacs wouldn't show a wifi card or produce sound when running an OS installed from anything but those new iMacs.\nFor older hardware -  doing the install and running the OS - the chance of total success is very high. Stack the odds in your favor by ensuring the retail DVD you use has a build number higher than the minimum build for the model you have.\nFor 100% success, just make sure the mac doing the install is the same as the mac running the OS and use the DVD that came with the mac.\n\nA: I've done this with a Tiger install a few years ago and the Tiger had zero problems working later. I'm sure there shouldn't be any problems with Snow Leopard or Leopard. (Hint: tell us what version you want to install) ;)\nOn the other hand, you can always remove the drive from the old machine, put it in the new one, perform the install and put it back in the old one, unless you're using a specific DVD version that came with the machine instead of a pure/full OS X install DVD. If this is the case, the new machine will probably refuse to install with that DVD (no matter where the target drive is, for all the machine knows is that there's a \"firewire\" external drive connected). Install DVDs that come with Macs are usually tied to those models, so a MacBook OS X Install DVD won't install an iMac. \n(Mostly, tho there has been a few exceptions to these rules and some hacks, but nothing simple). \nSince the driver-base for a full OS X DVD is the same regardless of the machine, the OS X installed on the new machine will perfectly work on the second one.\n", "Q: Prefer iPhone when synchronizing playlists between iTunes and iPhone When synchronizing Playlists between iTunes and an iPhone, by default, the playlists of iTunes are preferred - even if the iPhone's change is more current. I prefer to change my playlists on the go on my iPhone, so I want to change this behaviour. Is that possible? \n\nA: I'm unaware of any settings that this will work with iTunes/iPhone out of the box. But you could give iGadget X a try:\n\n** iPad, iPod touch and iPhone Support **\niGadget (Windows and Mac) now supports\n  the iPad, iPod touch and iPhone.\n  However, due to the limitation of the\n  Notes feature on these devices, only\n  the Music Transfer, Playlist Transfer\n  and Music Listing functions are\n  available when used with the iPad,\n  iPod touch or iPhone.\n\n\nPS: It's shareware ($19.99)\n", "Q: Sugar Sync & menu bar icons I'm wondering if there's a way to stop SugarSync (or any app) putting itself in the OS X menu bar (top right) when launched.\nSugar Sync doesn't have this option in it's preferences.\nI've managed to get Sugar Sync to appear in the Dock by going into the app's package contents and editing the property list. \nBut I can't figure out if a similar approach can be used to disable the menu bar item.\n\nA: There is no way to do this for all apps.  If it's possible, it's something the app developer would've had to choose to allow and so would only be possible on an app-by-app basis.  \nfree idea for those who want this bad enough to go make it themselves:\nCreate a library to inject into offending apps that makes -[NSStatusBar statusItemWithLength:] return nil.

They have simply had their partition identifier changed via software like Partition Magic, GPartd or some other similar tool.\nI have already taken a look at the command line options provided by diskutil and can not find anything to make the equivalent changes under Mac OS X.\n\nA: Often \"hiding a partition\" is simply setting them to not mount at boot. Have you looked in /etc/fstab for a noauto line that prevents one of the Volume UUID from mounting in the default manner?\nYou should be able to read all the partition, volume and filesystem information in terminal or Disk Utility (both of which are in the Utility menu of the install app)\ndiskutil list, diskutil info disk0, and diskutil info disk0s2 should get you started.  diskutil will list all the commands if you just run it without any commands listed.\nOf course, if the utility is using non-standard drivers or encrypting/obfuscating things you will have a harder time getting into the drive without more detailed information on how that specific utility did it's work. If diskutil can't see the partition then it's not actually hidden but gone. Tools like that run the risk of you using the space that is marked as free unless they do a good job of modifying the size of the device and hacking the partition table data.\nIn response to your edit - if the partition tables are changed to be non-standard you can undo the damage by being very good with writing hex values using dd  - if you get the it right, you can reverse the changes that were made to alter the file system definition data. Using gparted or another tool that is built for the task would sure be safer and probably easier.\n\nA: A linux live CD (like Ubuntu) should be able to view and modify partition information using command line tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*fdisk\n\n*cfdisk\nI'm not sure why you are needing a command line only solution, so just to be complete, you can get into the full disk utility from a Mac OS X install CD.\nAlso, that same linux live CD would give you access to gparted, which is a very good partition editor for linux.\n", "Q: Does a Snow Leopard reinstall require rebuilding my Development Environment? I'm having some pretty major problems with Mac OS X. Frequent crashes, Dock randomly disappears, general sluggishness, etc. & I think it's time to reinstall.\nI heard about a feature called Archive & Install. It sounds like it just re-installs essential system files and doesn't touch anything else. But my question is how much of my development environment will remain intact? I've installed some packages with Homebrew & RubyGems while following Ruby on Rails tutorials. Would I have to reinstall all those? \nI'm guessing my Mac apps are safe, even though they're all installed under \"Macintosh HD/Applications\", and not under my User account? \nWould love some advice, thanks.\n\n\n*\n\n*Rene\n\n\nA: If you are wanting to just reinstall Snow Leopard on top of itself, running the installer from the disc will not wipe out your development environment. I've done this myself with no issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*Be sure not to pick Erase and Install. Archive and Install is not what you want either. You essentially want to do an upgrade (can't recall what the exact option is at the moment, but I'm pretty sure it's the default).\n\n\nOf course, always run Time Machine anyways in case something catastrophic happens.\n", "Q: How to factory reset a 2010 MacBook Air? I have the late 2010 MacBook Air and need a way to do a factory reset on it.  Maybe factory reset is the wrong phrase, but I would like to delete all of the information from it so that nobody could access any of my information.\nAny idea on how this can be done?  (I do not have a Mac OS X disk.)\n\nA: The Macbook Air should have shipped with a small USB drive that contains the installation software.\nIt won't be easy to do what you want to without booting from something other than the System disk in your Mac.\nAssuming you have the USB drive that shipped with the Macbook Air (you should have unless there is a good reason why you don't have it), you should insert it and boot from it, by holding the option (alt) key just after you hear the chime when turning the machine on.\nAfter holding the option key for a short while, you will be presented with a choice of boot volumes, one of which should be the OS X installer.\nRun the installer and follow the instructions to reinstall the OS, at which point you should be given the option to wipe the current install and start fresh.\nIf you want extra security, you can use the Disk Utility while in the installation mode, by choosing it from the Utilities menu that is at the top of the screen.\nFrom there you can erase the disk, choosing from a range of security options when doing so.\nIf you don't have the USB drive you will have to obtain one somehow - which may mean taking the Mac to an Apple Store.\nFailing that, maybe you'll be able to acquire a install disk image from some place on the web and install it to an external drive that you can boot from. Not going to help with that though.\n\nA: It's easy to re-install the operating system. It's a free service at most Apple retail stores and you can always re-order the install media from apple if you lost it.\nAs to preventing someone from reading the data - that's normally done after the clean erase install. You can use disk utility and a test account to write random data over the free space once or twice to make it nearly impossible to get anything back. I haven't seen a credible source show that modern drives are any more secure after one or two passes (as compared to older technology where NSA/FBI expense units could still retrieve data after an erase attempt.)\nSSD are a bit more tricky with wear leveling and extra space hidden from the OS - but unless you are worried someone will take the flash storage apart to retrieve this \"hidden data\" - the same two passes is shown to erase 85% of the blocks or more which for most people is enough.\n\nA: Apologies if my answer is not applicable to your MBA as I have an late '11 MBA. \nBut for my MBA, the above answers would be incorrect. Actually, they're technically worse than incorrect but it's not that important. To properly 'erase' all data from an SSD, you need to boot into a Linux distribution from an external drive (USB or SD or CD), open a Terminal and get to root however you prefer - I use:\n$ sudo su -\n\nbut if you boot using partedmagic.com (which I think is your best option), you will be automatically logged in as root when you open a Terminal. \n# hdparm -I /dev/sda\n\nThis is to determine if your SSD is \"locked\" and it likely would be; at which point things will either be difficult or very easy. If it's locked, see below. If it's not locked, it's easy:\n# hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass Eide /dev/sda\n\n(this is to 'lock' your drive for the ATA Secure Erase command, the \"Eide\" password can be another password of your choosing)\n# hdparm --user-master u --security-erase Eide /dev/sda\n\n\nThough for the life of me I cannot understand the difference between \"Secure Erase\" and \"Enhanced Secure Erase\" (especially as they are both completed in mere seconds (with Enhanced actually slightly faster, but I'm sure that's not the reason it's 'more' Secure than Secure (go figure), what I do is - quite simply - to do both: \n# hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass Eide /dev/sda\n\n# hdparm --user-master u --security-erase-enhanced Eide /dev/sda\n\n\nYou can add --verbose to all of those to get more information, but I'd be lying if I claimed to have a clue about the output ;)\n\nNow if your SSD is locked (and I imagine it will be), you have to get it unlocked somehow which is so much more complicated than it should be. Your best bet is to download Parted Magic and click Start > System > Erase and it will open a GUI menu showing your available drives, select your SSD hard drive, confirm the next screen, and then it will offer you the option to put the drive 'to sleep' - which is easy to do on any system but OS X. With OS X there is no guarantee but this thread is probably the best list of options you can try if simply closing your lid for a couple minutes then opening it doesn't put your drive to sleep or if the Parted Magic option to 'sleep' your drive doesn't allow you to boot back into the saved state. \nHope this helps.

You can use any old text editor and save the script as plain text. If you don't want to store the scripts in the /Applications folder that's fine as well - it won't matter where you store them as long as they are readable and executable.\nIf you save the file as script.bash.command - you won't have to associate terminal with .sh or .bash since it runs command files by default. When the script ends, the terminal session is logged out, so it will run the command and exit letting you see the results but if you want a working window you have to open another window in terminal.\nWill that work for you?\n\nA: Maybe you need something like DTerm?

At work I use the Microsoft Natural ergonomic keyboard and a Logitech mouse. ControllerMate has hardware profiles for both, and I have many of the MS-specific keys remapped to other functions.\nLike yours, my keyboard also has an otherwise useless Mail button. With Controllermate open, if I press the Mail button while viewing the Microsoft keyboard profile, the list of available key sequences automatically jumps to the one it just received. You can then program that key to do whatever you like, even when ControllerMate isn't open.\n\n\nA: I think the answer about ControllerMate is a good one, but since you asked in a comment about a configuration file, I'll mention that the most powerful, \"raw\" way to configure your keyboard settings is by creating a custom keyboard layout.  I would guess that this is how apps like ControllerMate modify keyboard keys, but I can't say that for sure.\nYou can use an online generator for this purpose (it's old, but the .keylayout files it generates still work under Snow Leopard) or a GUI like Ukelele (free).\nWhen doing it this way, you would add the resulting .keylayout XML file to /Library/Keyboard Layouts (for use by all users) or ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts (for use by only the current user).  Then you would enable the custom layout in System Preferences -> Language & Text -> Input Sources.\nFor your third-party keyboard, it would still be tricky to find out the key code in a given mapSet for those \"useless\" keys for \"Back\", \"Forward\", \"Mail\", etc.  Personally, I would go with a GUI program that allows me to \"press and set\" so there's no extra research or guesswork on my part.\nSo in short, I am not saying that this method is easier or even more powerful than using an app like ControllerMate, but it should at least help explain how keyboards can be re-mapped under OS X without a \"middleman\" program that has to stay running in the background.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but future generations might like to know about a more recent tool. It's called Karabiner and can remap tons of things, and has defaults for mapping the F* keys to their Appley equivalents.\n\n", "Q: Safari is not showing style sheets For some reason, starting yesterday, Safari will not show ANY style sheets for any webpage I visit.

Normally when you install Parallels, it adds a folder to the dock which acts exactly like the default Applications folder on the Mac, except for all the Windows apps.\nIt even organizes them in folders exactly as the start menu on the PC is organized.\nI accidentally dragged it out of the dock, and I'm not sure how I can restore it.\n\nA: The way I was able to resolve the issue is by launching Parallels and then going into the \"configure\" settings. Next, I went to the Options > Applications, and checked \"Show Windows applications folder in Dock\".\nApparently when you drag the folder out of the dock, it will automatically uncheck this setting for you. In fact, if you try adding the folder manually and then launching Parallels, it will automatically remove the manually added folder.\n\nA: In Finder, use the command Cmd+Shift+G (\"Go to Folder\") and enter the following path, then click \"Go\":\n~/Library/Caches/Parallels/Applications Menus\nIn there, you'll find folders of applications based on the operating system(s) you installed under Parallels.

I've got a large folder of music with lots of aliases to tunes that are spread throughout subfolders of the main tunes folder. For example I might keep the original files sorted by artist, and then have a folder for a genre with a bunch of aliases to tunes (or folders of tunes) for that genre, like a playlist.\nNow that I've got a new laptop how can I transfer the whole folder without breaking the aliases?\nI tried using the symbolic link options of rsync but that doesn't seem to work with OS X aliases.\nBTW I'm not interested in replacing the aliases with a copy of the original, I really want to keep the aliases :)\nIs this something Time Machine can help with?\nThanks!\n\nA: Aliases are not the same as symlinks.\nSymlinks just point to a path (relative or absolute).\nAliases first track the file's unique ID and then the path.\nSince there are two pieces of information stored in an alias - they are more robust and will follow a file that's moved based on the unique ID. The downside is that the unique ID is based on the file system so copying the file elsewhere mints a new ID so the alias doesn’t map to the new location by design and implementation (currently at least).\nFinder (or the very powerful ditto) are your best bets for moving aliases intact. Worst case you could use disk utility to make an image of a folder that contains everything needed as a subfolder and then move that to preserve the relative locations of the files and isolate the effects of a short name change (/Users/whatever) in case you wish to change that. Once the original mac is disconnected from the new mac - the aliases will reconnect as desired to location of the files on the new mac.\n\nA: I believe aliases will be handled correctly if copied through the finder, even to external media.  If you are doing it through rsync you will probably have issues.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Forum Posting\n\n*Script to possibly convert Aliases to Symlinks\n", "Q: Twitterrific doesn't save my last read tweet I'm giving Twitterrfic a test drive. I'm not sure about the issue but it looks to me the Twitterrfic doesn't keep my last read tweet after a relaunch.\nI mean Nambu and Twitter official client save my last read tweet, thus I can scroll through all the new tweets. Twitterrific scrolls me to the newest tweet.\nI can't read the tweets while I'm offline.  \nAny way to make Twitterrfic behaves like Nambu or Twitter?\n\nA: Two possible things happening here. \n1) You have \"Always scroll to top\" turned on in Twitterrific's prefs. Head to the settings app to check and make sure it's turned off.\n2) You're receiving more tweets than the timeline can hold and so your previous reading position is \"off the timeline\". When this happens, Twitterrific defaults to the top of the timeline (the most recent tweet).\nThis is changing in the 4.1.1 update however so that even if you receive more tweets than the timeline holds, it will take you to the bottom instead of the top.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to make aliases go away when main file is deleted? Is there a way to (automatically) delete all aliases when the file they are an alias to is deleted?\n\nA: No - aliases are a combination of a sym link pointing to a place as well as a unique file ID to track that file if it moves so the alias won't be broken if the file still resides on the original volume. (the file ID changes across volumes and an alias will only remain valid if the relative path is correct if and when the file ID half is broken by a deletion).\nSo - for this to work, the system actively tries to reconnect the alias after a delete of the original file by design so automatically deleting an alias would ruin that chance to reconnect.\nEven though your question makes great logical sense, it amounts to a re-design of what an alias is engineered to do.\nA hard link is what you want to use if you want it to go away when the file is deleted finally.\n\nA: Not really as an alias could be on an external disk pointing to your normal disk. If the external is off line then that alias cannot be found when the original is deleted\n", "Q: Some SSH commands do nothing?

I've read the forums and tried...\nto plug in and out my headphones (I even used two different pairs\nI blew into the headphone port (similar to an old Nintendo system)\nSomething to note:\nMy alarm works and when I unlock the phone during the alarm I get the click sound.\n\nA: I have this problem happen occasionally with many of my audio \"gadgets\".  I generally follow troubleshooting steps in this order and have always gotten it working again.\nStep one is plugging/un-plugging headphones.  This almost always corrects it (but apparently it has not in your case).\nStep two is power-cycling the device.  For an iPhone, I would recommend resetting it by holding down both the sleep/wake and home buttons until you see the Apple logo.\nStep three is carefully checking the port for damage, or an object that might have become lodged in there.  And if it's not fixed by this point...\nStep four is getting it serviced by the manufacturer.  Sometimes problems are simply beyond our ability to fix them ourselves.\n\nA: The biggest cause of this problem is fluff!\nIf you store the phone in a pocket or a bag fluff can get into the headphone socket, it doesn't cause any harm but after a while it can build up and block the connectors, when you compress the fluff against the inside of the connector the phone thinks there are headphones inside.\nThe solution first, and easy to do, suck the air out using you mouth or use a small pin to scrape it out.\n\nA: I had this problem after spilling some water on my pocket (ok it was a water fight), although the phone was in a slip case the headphone socket was exposed and a small droplet of water got in shorting my headphone socket. Considering you have been running, sweat or even rain water could have made it's way in. \nSolution\nIn the end the only way i could get the water out was to use a bike pump with the adapter for pumping up rugby and foot balls. It is small enough to fit into the jack. (It needs to be small enough to allow for the air you pump in to come back out the sides, my little adapter is about 1.5mm thick.) Use the pump then to force the water out although be careful because the adapter is very small so the air pressure is huge. I kept the screen lit during this so i could see if anything was deforming. \nNote: Do not try and blow it out as there is too high a risk of you putting in more moisture from your breath. \nAlso I'm not sure if the air canisters are a good idea either, then tend to make things very cold. \n\nA: I spilled cola into the headphone socket. Then I read about sucking the air from the headphone port. Use your mouth and suck the air inward; don't blow air into the port, as you may put more moisture into it by doing so. \n\nA: Forget mechanical methods.. and why blow air in instead of drawing it out?\nI just put a vaccuum over the jack outlet, cupped around the large hose end with my hands and presto... months of problems over!  (And I didnt have to buy compressed air).\n\nA: To get out of headphone mode, try to turn on airplane mode and turn it off; or update your iPhone system.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Mac won't boot with new RAM installed I have a Mac mini (Macmini3,1).

I eventually gave up and put the old RAM back in and it worked.\nIs it possible that the RAM is bad and I should have it replaced?

I can't seem to find a simple way to filter mail that is either to or from a given address. It seems that you have to duplicate the address and use two conditions e.g.\nFrom - contains - fred@nowehere.com\nAny recipient - contains - fred@nowehere.com\n\nI would have hoped that \"Any recipient\" might include \"From\" but it seems that it only  includes \"To\", \"Cc\", \"Bcc\", etc.\n\nA: Rules are unfortunately quite limited, but you can sometimes use Smart Mailboxes to help you work around the problem.\nFor example, if you need a Rule that performs an action when the conditions (A OR B) AND C are met, you can set up a Smart Mailbox called 'X' that contains all emails where (A OR B) is true, then a second Smart Mailbox called Y that contains all emails where (C is true AND Mailbox Is X).\nIf necessary, you could then set up a rule that does whatever processing you need to do on the contents of mailbox Y, and run it manually as required (select all messages in mailbox Y, then Message->Apply Rules).\n\nA: This question showed up on my radar again because my comment was voted up, but there are still no good answers so I'll go the extra mile. ;) It's an interesting exercise.\nYou say that you \"have a lot of filters and some of them have several email addresses so I would have to go through all these duplicating every From: test and making it an Any recipient: test - a maintenance headache as well as all the initial pain\"\nThis maintenance headache could be removed through the magic of Applescript. The following script takes messages selected in Apple Mail, goes through all the \"sender\" fields to find new senders that don't already have one of these \"from/any recipient\" rules, and if not creates a new rule with your \"from/any recipient\" rule conditions.\nI'm not sure exactly what you're doing with the Mail Rules, but I'll presume you're setting up folders for each Mail \"conversation\" with each email address. I only search the  \"from\" header to set up these as an email might have many recipients. It's rough and ready, and you'll want to modify it yourself.

The charger provided with your iPhone can provide up to 1000 mA.\nSo in general, I would expect it to take about twice as long on a typical computer.\nHowever... many newer Apple computers can actually provide up to 1100 mA USB power (according to this Apple Knowledge Base article) for a limited number (1 to 3) of devices plugged directly into the computer (i.e. not via a USB hub). The iPhone will supposedly draw 1 A when connected in this way (according to the System Profiler at least), so as far as the published specifications go, it shouldn't make any difference.\nSome opinion/speculation: It seems strange that the page linked to by LudoMC claims a significantly longer charge time from a laptop that's listed among those capable of delivering 1100 mA to a single device. It makes me wonder if Apple's laptops are really meeting the 1100 mA spec they claim, or whether there was another device connected to the laptop in the test (they don't mention any other devices, or the lack of them, nor do they mention the greater-than-standard power capacity of their MacBook, so they may not have been aware of it and/or the fact that only 1 device can utilise it).\n\nA: Here is a page where you have the result of the comparison of charging an iPhone4 from USB or power outlet.\nHere is their conclusion:\n\nStating the obvious, the iPhone 4 takes longer to get a full charge on USB than an outlet. What you may not have realized is how big the difference was, an extra 30 minutes! That’s 23% longer to get a full charge on the USB.\n\n\nA: Officially, no.  In practice, the chargers that plug into a power outlet can deliver more current than what is mentioned in the USB specification, so are noticeably faster at charging many devices.\nIn addition, when not plugged into the computer, a device is usually off more of the time, and devices that are off charge faster.\n\nA: When I charge my mobile through power plug socket, it takes just one (1) hour to become full charge i.e. from 1-2% to 100% as well as through CPU charging, it takes one hour fifteen minutes to become full charge. But, battery lasts long in CPU charging, because drainage of battery charging is slowly reduced. Whereas in power socket charging, drainage of battery charging is quickly reduced. Therefore, I suggest all of you that though charging time is much longer via CPU charging than power socket charging, yet it will be better to charge a mobile via CPU charging so far as drainage of battery is concerned.\n\nA: Other answers are good, but an important thing has not been explicitly mentioned is that you can actually use a PC to charge iOS device quickly. This depends on whether your system has available drivers.\nFor example, on Linux systems since kernel version 5.7 there's a driver shipped which adds fast charge. Quoting the description, as it may be interesting in this thread:\n\niOS devices will not draw more than 500mA unless instructed to do so.\nSetting the charge type power supply property to \"fast\" tells the device\nto start drawing more power, using the same procedure that official\n\"MFi\" chargers would.\n\nLinux systems aside, I think Apple computers can do that too.\n", "Q: Is there a way to password protect individual apps? Is it possible to password protect a specific Mac application?\nFor example, I am interested in protecting Mail because even if you cannot retrieve new emails, you still can read all the already received emails.\nThis is not a question about security. It's about sharing a device within a family. I don't have crucial information. I just want to avoid my girl or son to send accidentally emails from my account or prevent them to read some of them.\n\nA: Yes - several ways to password protect your mail are practical. Since you are concerned about children/family members, the easiest might be to just restrict those apps using Parental Controls on your account. At some point they can have their own accounts, and you can lock your whole account.\n\nHere are the options I see as workable for the general case of locking apps or the data apps can access.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make your account a protected parental account and white list the apps you want to allow. You will know the separate admin user/password to allow launch of prohibited apps. Voila - any app you want is now password protected.\n\n*Move the app into a password protected disk image and then make an alias to store in the Applications folder. (deleting the original app first) When any program tries to access the app, you get a chance to enter a password and finder will mount the disk image. You can also script permission changes and other technical trickery to require a password before running the script to make the app runnable again. \n\n*Store the application data in a password protected encrypted disk image. Here are some common apps and the folders where they store user data.\n\n*Store your mail app on a removable drive - there is a cottage industry about making standalone app packages to run apps from USB drives. \nKeep in mind things like spotlight and other apps using frameworks within apps won't work so well until the images are mounted. If your user password is secure (from the people you don't want seeing the data) then you can store the disk image passwords in the keychain.\nAlso - unless you protect the data files - it's only security by obscurity and someone could copy your data elsewhere or just look at it from spotlight or other apps like text edit. They also could bring a copy of the mail (or whatever other) app from another computer. Apps can run from anywhere and not just the Applications folder once an admin user blesses them for the first run on that system.\nTherefore #3 is the only way to go. Lock up your data and don't worry about the apps.\n\nA: Here is a Mac utility that will do what you're asking for. It can password protect individual apps.

Secured console.\n\nA: Separate accounts is the solution to this problem.\nEmail might be the obvious one, but there'll be some important files, or bookmarks, or open banking tabs, etc that could be equally bad for a child to randomly delete/open/mess with.\nSeparate accounts (with only parents as administrators) means you can keep everyone's files, emails, settings, etc separate, even though applications are accessible by all.\nIf user X uses the Mail application, their emails and account settings are only accessible when they are logged in. When user Y opens Mail, they will have their own accounts/mail, even though both are using the same Mail application.\nYou might have a shared account for adults, and another for kids, or individual accounts for each person. With separate accounts, you will want to lock the computer (via screensaver, or returning to the login screen) when you leave it. But even if you forget, your kids will want to use their own account (with their own bookmarks, or save game files, or high scores, or documents, etc) rather than yours, which will help prevent any accidental access/damage. Even something as simple as not having to log out of facebook from whoever last used the browser (each account has its own browser settings, which remember who is logged into Gmail, facebook, icloud, etc).\nYou can also prevent some users from accessing particular applications, websites, etc via Parental Controls in System Preferences.\n\nA: It's an old thread I know, but I had the same problem like you…\nHere is the solution:\nAn application called iLock.

Every time you run it, it will ask you for your password (just like some installers do). After it's done running, it will disable access to the regular Mail application. So run the script once, then try running the Mail app. It won't run. Note that it means ALL users on your machine will be prevented from running Mail directly, not just your user.\nIf you ever want to allow Mail to run normally again, run this command at the Terminal:\nsudo chmod +x /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail\n\nYou might be able to omit the \"sudo\". Use sudo if you get \"Operation not permitted\". Note that sudo will ask you for your password to allow privileged operation.\nCaveats\n\n\n*\n\n*If you didn't need the \"sudo\" command above to do the chmod, that means a savvy user might be able to figure out how to enable the Mail app again. You can tighten up security by changing the owner of the MacOS/Mail file to root. That's left as an exercise for the reader.\n\n*If someone is able to copy the Mail app to your computer (e.g. via USB drive) they can still get access to your mail.\n\n*The ruby script is meant to work for most OS X application bundles. I don't recommended tweaking the ruby script unless you really know what you're doing because it's doing certain things as root (the privileged user). Tweaking the applescript code should be harmless; but you should know how to adjust the chmod command to make your app directly runnable again.\n\n*If the path to the app in the applescript file has spaces or other special characters, you'll have to do something like putting single quotes around the whole path.\n\n*Edit: User Austin suggested that this procedure doesn't protect the .emlx files. I actually don't use the Mail app so I'm not familiar with the data storage. Similar issues apply to all apps - because this solution does not hide user data.\n\n\nParanoia\nIf someone who knows ruby get access to your logged in user, they could modify the ruby script in a way that wreaks all sorts of havoc when you run the script, since it runs as root for part of the time. If you think this might happen, you should make the script only writable by root. You'll also have to make sure someone doesn't replace the script with their own - they can do this if the folder is writable by you. If you're starting to get scared by these warnings and don't know how to protect yourself, you probably should forget about this solution and just remember to lock your screen when you leave the computer.\n\nA: You can just set parental controls on the account and then determine which apps can be used.\nAlternatively you could set a password on your screen saver and also define a suitable \"hot corner\" to activate the screen saver - that way when you step away from your computer you can just move the mouse into the hot corner to effectively lock the screen such that it require a password to gain access.\n\nA: Hmm. I've wanted to do this for a while now. Let's take another example that doesn't keep local files unless it's told to - chat programs like Skype or Trillian, for example. The trouble with parental controls is you can't be an admin user on the machine AND have parental controls on your admin user account.\nMy suggestion would be to simply do the following:\nchmod 600 /Applications/Trillian.app ; chown `whoami`:staff /Applications/Trillian.app\n\nThis stops anyone from running it, but marks it as yours\nThen to run it, \nsudo /Applications/Trillian.app/Contents/MacOS/Trillian\nThis gets past the 600 (rw- --- ---) access permissions above, and you will have to enter an admin password to run it.\nYou might also look into the setuid bit and see if that helps (make the app run as another user, in other words).\n\nA: What about setting up separate user accounts with their own apple id, email with parental restrictions or no email at all. Apps can be shared by different accounts. Depending on the age of your kids, if they have administrator ability i.e. your account, they might be able to harm your account without meaning to. With you being the administrator you can control what they can do with their account.\n\nA: Quick and dirty: Open disk utilities, make a password protected disk image in your applications folder, move any apps you want protected in there. You'll have to enter the password once to use them evertime you log in then you can just unmount the disk image so people on the same account can still use your computer w/o access to those apps.\n\nA: If you want to use an app for achieving this, it seems there's not really much choice on the \"free\" range. AppLocker and AppCrypt allows only 1 app to be locked in the free version, and there's a few other apps that offer free trials for 15 days or so. Otherwise there's the paid options.\nI guess the way to go for a free solution (for more than 1 app) is to go with Kelvin's script method.\nHere are the apps I managed to find:\nFree(mium):\nAppLocker\nAppCrypt\nFree trials:\niLocker\nMacAppBlocker\nPaid:\niLock\nLock Pro\nPersonally, I've just tried and still use AppLocker. I only need it for one app so for me the free version is just fine. Is very easy to use and rock solid. Recommended!\n\nA: Mac App Blocker \nDoes exactly what you're asking for. From their website:\n\nWith Mac App Blocker, you can password-protect EACH application on your Mac. Keep your apps and your Mac safe. Set a timeout value to automatically exit the protected application so even when you leave your computer unattended, you're still protected.\n\n", "Q: How can I embed a linked local image in an Apple Mail signature? I think my question says it all (and yes, I've googled and searched StackExchange already) - but to clarify:\nI want to embed an image, which I have locally, in my html email signature (i.e. my logo, linked to my website). I create a html file (and made a web archive of it) with referencing to my local image like  src=\"file:///Users/myuser/path/to/image/jpg\".\nOpening the web archive/html page in Safari displays the logo fine.\nNow, when I use this html signature, Thunderbird is smart enough to embed the local image properly with a binary mime type of image/jpeg, however, Mail just doesn't do anything with it and just leaves the html code untouched, still referencing to the local file (and even that doesn't work/display when I receive my own mail on my Mac where I actually have the file at that local place; probably sandboxed?!).\nI've already googled and all of below are not working:\nHow can I embed an image in an Apple Mail signature?\nHow can I add some html to my Mail.app signature?\n(and their respective linked articles on the web).\nThe only way I could get the local image to display in the received email is to drag & drop the image from the Finder into the Mail signature preferences window, but then, I still have the problem that the image is not linked to my website, and I see now way to edit the html source of it in any way. \nI've already tried to drag & drop the image, then open the web archive file under /Users/myuser/Library/Mail/Signatures in Safari, fetch the html code (which holds code for an embedded object), modify the source code (adding a link around the image), save it as web archive and overwrite the old file. However, after doing that and restarting Mail, the image doesn't show, but instead shows a place holder saying \"Missing Plug-in\".\n(I don't want to use remote images on the web, since many clients mostly ask users to display remote images firstly, before actually displaying them - embedded images therefore work better, as they will be displayed instantly in most cases/email clients' default configuration.)\n\nA: Here is my solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the picture in Preview (or open the html in a browser)\n\n*Cmd-A to select all, Cmd-C to copy\n\n*Create a new signature and paste in the contents\n\n\nI have verified that this solution works for local pictures and simple html snippets.\n\nA: I have found that Mac Mail does not allow for embedded images in their signatures. If you are designing an HTML signature, I would use the img src tag to load a remote image. Try using googleplus or googledocs to save the image you want to include. You can then control it using HTML and CSS styles.\n", "Q: most Mac-compatible linux distribution I want to install Ubuntu on my iMac. But I don't want to use Unity. I want to use Gnome 3. I can install it over Ubuntu (as I do on my laptop) but I know that Fedora and OpenSuse use Gnome 3 natively.\nAlso, I use Ubuntu on my laptop because of drivers. It was a pain in my ass to install all working properly on Fedora and CentOS. So finally I've installed Ubuntu and it works fine for years.\nSo now I understand, that here is another bunch of drivers on my iMac and maybe here won't be any problems with Fedora.\nOk. Actually, the question is what is the best distribution (best, I mean most compatible with drivers wireless devices: Mouse, Keyboard etc) to use on iMac. As a second OS and as OS in my VirtualBox.\n\nA: I look at this issue the other way (which may not help you at all as you mention video driver issues and you want full linux access to the GPU).\nMy take is \"Which virtualization environment works best with the linux distributions I want to use?\"\nFor me the answer is VMware Fusion, then VirtualBox and lastly Parallels. And I really haven't heard any significant issues with all three of these in the last several months.\nThe reason is that my time is so much more precious than whatever marginal increase in speed I would have gotten installing linux natively.

So far I've tried most of the usual troubleshooting tips found by googling the issue (deleting caches & preferences, signing out & back in, rebooting).  Nothing's helped at this point.  I've deleted the app from the Applications folder to try to re-install it but when I click Install, the wheel on the top left just spins for a few seconds then nothing happens & the install button reappears.  I don't have any problems on a different Mac.  I do have the same issue if I create another account on this Mac, so it must be a system setting somewhere...\n\nA: I'm not sure why this worked, but I just downloaded the apps through the app store on a different Mac, then copied them over to the problematic Mac.  Since then, there have been other updates applied with no problem.  I'm not sure what the problem here was.\n", "Q: Removing entries from the MobileMe synchronization list Some applications can synchronize data using MobileMe synchronization; the problem I have with those applications is that they are still listen in the MobileMe preference panel, under the \"Synchronize\" tab, even when they have been uninstalled. I use a tool to remove any files associated with an application, when I don't need it anymore.\nIs there a way to refresh the list of settings to synchronize, and avoid that removed applications are visible in that list?\n\nA: The program injected data into ~/Library/Application Support/SyncServices/Local/TFSM by calling code to add their sync schema to Mobile Me's local sync database. You want that program to call unregisterSchemaWithName before you delete it so that data is deleted out of MobileMe.\nThe Local SyncServices folder governs iOS device sync as well as MobileMe sync - so use care to keep those devices away from your mac if you with to proceed in a manual clean up.\nIt's a really bad idea to simply delete files out of that folder if you are not prepared to have sync break in very ugly ways (I have seen people end up with 10 copies of each contact, calendar item and bookmark by moving / disturbing things in SyncServices) If you have a great backup and don't mind erasing everything from MobileMe and re-syncing from a computer - have at hacking the folder. There's no better way to know how things work by breaking them. Apple has an eloquent warning that starts... \"As if it were a swarm of bees, you should stay away from the SyncServices folder.\"\nYou can see what a sync schema looks like by reading the database of files on your mac in the terminal locate syncschema. These files and folders define how data gets injected into the sync database with the registerSchemaWithBundlePath call and may have clues on cleanup scripts or steps.\nYour best bet is to contact the vendor and ask them what steps to take to undo their changes. Apple has been changing the internals of how mobile me works lately, so there are no for certain steps that work across all versions of 10.6.x and your specific data in MobileMe. Since MobileMe is a paid service, you might also get general guidance from Apple Support in cleaning up the preference pane even though it's a third party data addition. They did add hooks and intend to let other apps to the sync party so they might reasonably help you clean up after the fun is over.\n\nA: The tool I used 3-4 years ago was Syncrospector. It allows to unregister clients, and schemas; what is shown in the MobileMe preference panel are the registered clients.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to have the Mac App Store check for updates automatically? So a bit of an annoyance with the Mac App Store: if it isn't running, it doesn't seem to check for updates. 2 apps I use quite a bit, Evernote and Twitter have both had recent updates and it's taken me a few days, or in the case of one Evernote update, a week to find out about the update (and Evernote included a fix I wanted).\nIs there a way to have the App Store check for update on a schedule and notify me somehow, ie dock icon badge or a bounce or through the OSX software update?\n\nA: The App Store doesn't offer that functionality by default, and you can't configure or script it to check for updates. So...\nThe closest you're going to get is automatically opening the App Store so you can look at the icon to check for updates. Here's how to make the App Store open automatically at an interval:\nOpen iCal and add a new event. Call it something like Check App Store for Updates. Double-click it on the calendar and click the Edit button. Set the repeat menu to Every day or Every week.\nYou can get it to check at some interval in between (say, every 3 days), by using the Custom... option.\nSet the alarm menu to Open File. In the newly-showing second menu under alarm, choose Other... and select the App Store in your Applications folder. Set the last menu under alarm to on date.\nThis way, iCal will automatically open the App Store at the interval you specified under the repeat menu. Its window will pop up to remind you to look at its icon. When you do, you'll see the number of available updates.\n\nA: The Store already does check for updates automatically. Leave the App Store icon in the Dock to be notified of available updates. (Little red counter.)\nI am not sure how often it checks, though. In my experience it happens shortly after session login.\n", "Q: Location of services created in Automator Long-time ago i created a service in Automator, which still works.\nBut i want to change the code and it isn't located in either /Library/Services/ nor ~/Library/Services/ as they are both empty\nHave i lost the source code or can i restore it otherwise?\n\nA: Did you try ~/Library/Workflows/?\n\nA: As others have said, services are normally in one of the Library/Services folders (~/Library/Services, /Library/Services, and /System/Library/Services).  If just looking there doesn't turn it up, another option is to spy on what files are being opened when you invoke the service, with something like:\nsudo opensnoop -n WorkflowService\n\n... and then running the service, and looking through the results to see if you can spot the relevant file.  If it isn't an Automator-based service, you might have to leave off the -n WorkflowService (although you'll have a lot more irrelevant files to sort through because you'll be seeing every file anything in the entire OS opens).\n\nA: The location of the user created services is under:\n~/Library/Services/\n\n(tested Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.4)\nother locations you get by entering following command in Terminal:\nmdfind .workflow\n\n\nA: Edited to add\nAutomator services are definitely supposed to be stored in ~/Library/Services, based on my Googling. I just created a new service in Automator and it placed it there.\n\nPerhaps ~/Library/Application Support/Automator/\nAlternately, when I last made a service I believe that I had to save it as an .app first, so you might search for apps.\n\nA: Try searching for .workflow in Spotlight to find all workflow files in your user folder.  The service will be called Whatever the Service Name Is in the Services Menu.workflow.\nIf you prefer the Terminal, this command will do the same thing, searching the current directory and all the folders underneath it:\nfind ./ -name \"*.workflow\"\nEDIT: Corrected a small mistake in the Terminal command.  Apparently -type f doesn't work on .workflow files.\n\nA: The best way that I know to find workflows or anything else is to use the app: \"EasyFind.app\".  Unlike the Finder and Spotlight and even the Unix command-line, EasyFind.app can be configured to search everywhere, and it has a Unix-style pattern-matching capability.  For example \"*.workflow\" can be used to find any Service on your entire hard-drive.\nBest of all EasyFind.app is free and legal.\nEasyFind.app\n\nINSTEAD of using extra programs you can run your Terminal and enter command:\nmdfind .workflow\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nI found following ~/Library/Services/ does exist, on my 10.8 OSX.\nBut I can not see it with Finder, only from Terminal. \nI aslo find this:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/1161156/view_library_folder_in_lion.html\nThat explain it little better.   \n\nA: If the Services of workflow is generated by system, It will located in \"/System/Library/Services\".\nBut if you workflow(services) added by yourself from Automator, it will located in \"/Users/[your username]/Library/Services\".\n\nA: It is a hidden folder:/Macintosh HD/Users/<username>/Library/Services. The best way to get there is either create a new service in automator and save it and follow steps below, or if you have one created already follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard and click the Shortcut tab.\n\n*Find the service that you created\n\n*Right click on the service and Open in Finder.\n\n\nIt will reveal the hidden folder.\n", "Q: Verizon iPhone 4 - no Exchange push? I used to have a 2nd generation iPod Touch, and had it connected to my email account at work (Exchange 2003).  The iPod got push email as expected, and would often ping before Outlook (2010) would on my PC.  I have since upgraded to a Verizon iPhone 4, and it does not get push email, or anything else from Exchange.  I've deleted and re-added the account on the phone, and have verified that the delivery setting under Settings is set to Push.  If I open the Mail app, then it gets email just fine.  It won't even fetch it on its own; I have the interval set to 15 minutes, but I've never seen it receive email without the Mail app open.\nIs anyone else experiencing this?  Is it a bug introduced in the Verizon iPhone's branch of iOS?\nI'm currently running iOS 4.2.8 on it.\nUPDATE: I got some logs off of the device, and have found this error a few times:\n(date and time) unknown dataaccessd[47] : EAS|connection died with error Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1004 \"Could not connect to the server.\" UserInfo=xxxxxx {NSErrorFailingURLStringKey=https://x.x.x.x/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync?User=xxxxxx&DeviceId=xxxxxxx&DeviceType=iPhone&Cmd=Ping, NSErrorFailingURLKey=https://x.x.x.x/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync?User=xxxx&DeviceId=xxxxx&DeviceType=iPhone&Cmd=Ping, NSLocalizedDescription=Could not connect to the server., NSUnderlyingError=0x2f17f80 \"Could not connect to the server.\"} 0x2f2cf20\nIn the links in the answer posted by berberich, Ping is discussed as a command that the device issues to the server in the process of negotiating the push (if I understand correctly).\n\nA: I have a Verizon iPhone 4, and while I'm not using it with an actual Exchange server, I have several Gmail and Google Apps accounts setup as Exchange accounts that push emails to me without issue.\nI would try two things if I were you:\n\n*\n\n*Setup a Google account on your iPhone as an Exchange account if you have't already, and see if those emails get pushed to you. If so, you can confidentially narrow the issue down to your specific Exchange server at work.\n\n*Talk to your IT department at work and see if they have any errors logged related to ActiveSync. They might be able to determine if this problem is server-wide, or specific to your account.\n\nBased on what I've read, this could be an issue related to your Exchange 2003 server at work. This Microsoft TechNet discussion is marked \"solved\" with an answer that links to an Exchange Team blog post titled \"Direct Push is just a heartbeat away\" that provides technical details for Direct Push/ActiveSync.\n\nA: I figured it out.  I had the account set up to point to the internal IP address for our mail server, which obviously only works when I'm on wifi in the office or I have a vpn connection from outside.  We have external exchange webmail access to our email, so I tried setting the mail server setting on the phone to that server name (mail.mycompany.com).  It worked like a charm.  My guess is that the phone drops off of wifi while asleep to preserve battery life.  The iPod Touch does not because that's its internet connection, which it needs for push notifications to work.\n", "Q: Mac Mini + HP 3065 - resolution I bought the new Mac Mini and connected it to my HP 3065 screen using the DVI cable + supplied HDMI to DVI adapter.

Anyone have any experience with it for personal VPN use?\nEdit: I did come across this post that explains how to set up the l2tp vpnd service that ships with Snow Leopard, but haven't had a lot of luck getting it to work myself yet. A number of commenters on the post have succeeded though, so others reading this should give that a try.\nOn the client side, it looks like all you need to do is add a VPN network interface in System Preferences, so once the server is working, that part is pretty easy.\n\nA: I do have my own OpenVPN server running on Linode, and I use Tunnelblick to connect to it. Works flawlessly.\nThere's a guide on Linode's library to help you set things up.\n\nA: If you have a old computer laying around at home or maybe a virtual machine on a Mac at home, you could install Linux on it, assign it a dynamic DNS (search to locate a free provider) to give it a domain name, and then setup a PPP VPN server on the Linux box (the pptpd service).\nThis does require that the machine is kept on, and that you open some ports in your firewall/router.\nStep-by-step instructions to set-up pptpd on Debian/Ubuntu are available at http://www.howtogeek.com/51237/setting-up-a-vpn-pptp-server-on-debian/\nIt’s free and you’re absolutely in control of your own data. As an added bonus you get secure remote access to your services on your home network (such as file and iTunes sharing).\n\nA: I've once set up an IPSec based VPN server using Openswan which allowed me to use the built-in IPSec support of both macOS and iOS very easily.\nHere's an installation guide that should meet your requirements.\n", "Q: How to \"type to search\" in current folder Prior to owning Mac, I used Ubuntu with Nautilus (the default file-browser). With Nautilus, you could simply start typing something, and it would select the folder / file matching the characters you typed.\nI'm a programmer who simply just needs to quickly navigate folders so you might understand why I would prefer this over the normal finder search which is slow, searches file contents, and the entire contents of your disc.\nIs there a simple equivalent of this type-to-select functionality for finder?\n\nA: Yes, if you start typing, it'll select files/folders with what you type. The only difference between this functionality and Ubuntu's is that OS X's equivalent of this feature doesn't show what you're typing.\n\nA: Follow these instructions to change the default search location in Mac OS 10.6 and newer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Focus Finder and bring up the Preferences dialog\n\n*Switch to the Advanced tab\n\n*Change the When performing a search option to ‘Search the current folder’\n\n\nThis is probably more preferable if you’re know what you’re doing. The default which search the entire computer is intended to help out inexperienced users who have no idea where they just saved their files.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Back To My Mac DNS or routing information from the command line? I often want to ssh to a Mac and would love to make use of of iCloud to look up IP/DNS routing information. Can this be done without signing up for a dynamic DNS service and configuring it on each Mac in addition to iCloud?\nLet's assume of my on-all-the-time Mac at home's hostname is \"maui\" and it's running Snow Leopard. When I'm on my laptop connected to the home network, I can ssh maui.local. It sure would be nice to be able to ssh maui.whatever.icloud.com or whatever would work. I'm guessing I would need \"maui\" and my iCloud name to let it know which machine under my account needs reaching.\nDoes anyone know if this is possible through API or command line? I've browsed the public developer information several times but don't see anything promising. Any pointers or code examples would be welcome.\nP.S. Please don't suggest free DNS accounts as I'm really interested in MobileMe exclusively for this question. I know those will work but I'm looking to avoid installing anything else or another account/external dependency on these Macs.\n\nA: This has changed a little with 10.7 and you'll want to note that this uses IPv6 almost entirely so test with ping6 and traceroute6 to debug things.\nIt's no longer done via @computername.mobilemename.members.mac.com, it's now done via members.btmm.icloud.com, and its no longer as simple as your mobilemename.\nStep 1: Find out your iCloud BTMM domain\nEither of these commands will provide your BTMM domain:\n# dns-sd -E\n# mDNS -E\n\nThe output is formatted slightly differently, but what you're after is the numeric ID, it'll be something like 12345678.members.btmm.icloud.com.\nStep 2: List Computers\nYou can use these tools to browse that domain for services, e.g. for ssh servers:\n# dns-sd -B _ssh 12345678.members.btmm.icloud.com\n\nOr if you already know the hostname just access it directly as computer-name.12345678.members.btmm.icloud.com. (Any spaces in your computer name will be hyphens in this domain).\nYou can only access this from a computer that is also set up for BTMM on the same account, because this hostname will resolve to an IPv6 address that is really the end of an encrypted network tunnel between your BTMM computers.\nIf you want to see the IPv6 address for a specific host, you can type\n# dns-sd -G v6 computer-name.12345678.members.btmm.icloud.com\n\nAnd it'll output something like:\n17:37:47.504  Add     2  0 computer-name.12345678.members.btmm.icloud.com. FD11:993E:64AE:4DEA:011F:FBD1:F444:11A1%<0>  152\n\nStep 3: Connect\n# ssh username@computer-name.12345678.members.btmm.icloud.com\n\nNote\nI'm not sure if that number will ever change, so you may or may not need to repeat Step 1 at some point later on...\n\nA: I read a few articles on the underpinning of Back To My Mac and supposedly some people have effectively connected via ssh, check out the discussion contained in this Macworld post.\nThe best post in the thread is as follows:\n\nUse the following format for\n  connecting as a differnent username:\nssh\n  user.name@hostname.username.members.mac.com.\nIf you do this regularly and wish to\n  save having to use the username all\n  the time for ssh and scp then create a\n  file called ~/.ssh/config with\n  contents like the following:\nHost\n  hostname.username.members.mac.com.\n  User user.name\nHost host2.some.domain.com. User\n  username2 Port 2222 LocalForward 3389\n  internal-pc:3389\nThe second host in this file also\n  includes using a port other than 22\n  and allowing access to a Windows\n  computer called internal-pc with\n  Remote Desktop by connecting to\n  localhost with the Remote Desktop\n  Client.\n\nNow obviously Apple has switched .mac to MobileMe, so I dont know if that has switched to .me.com, and frankly I dont have a MobileMe account to test it. \nEdit:\nAnother interesting post you may want to try is at the veery bottom\n\nTurns out it is even easier! :P\njust open the Terminal go to Shell >\n  New Remote Connection...\nthen choose ssh and there you have\n  your BackToMyMac Computer listed (if\n  the OS sees it).\ntype in your username and click\n  connect.\nvoila, you can even see the connection\n  string used. And you can also use\n  ftp/sftp... from this dialog to your\n  remote Mac.\nWay easier than typing in some shell\n  command like suggested in the original\n  tip.\n\n\nA: You can ssh to your machine which has \"Bac to my Mac\" enabled like this:\nssh -p 22 username@computername.mobilemename.members.mac.com\n\n\nA: Big thanks to hobs and ghoppe who both had workable solutions. The main problem is that MobileMe Back To My Mac uses IPv6 addressing if available and perhaps exclusively, so I didn't think to use ping6 or traceroute6 and ssh is apparently smart enough to resolve either IPv4 or IPv6.\nssh -p 22 username@computername.mobilemename.members.mac.com. works very reliably for me in testing today.\nSince this tripped me up as I was expecting ping and host and nslookup to work, I figure I'll put up a nice summary of what worked for me. (with pictures! - I really like pictures)\nTo summarize sftp, ssh, ping6, and traceroute6 should work with this naming scheme.\nApple's built in terminal (and iTerm) is great to make sure your user name and remote short name are correct. The name is the short host name (what hostname prints out) and not necessarily the longer sharing name Finder will show for the remote Mac).\n\nHere is what the Terminal shows when it discovers Back To My Mac machines running. The menu item is New Remote Connection... and the shortcut is Shift+Command+K. It shows how the finder name \"Mikey's Mac\" might be different than the short host name mi\n\n\nA: That's because the IP addresses for resolution are version 6.\nIf you use ping6 or traceroute6 you can reach your host as well.\n", "Q: How to silently update OS X and reboot if necesary? I am looking for a silent (unattended) way of updating OS X that would not require use intervention.\nIs this possible, how?\n\nA: $ sudo softwareupdate --list\n$ softwareupdate -a -i -R\n\nThis tool - even if updates come from the App Store app, does not update any purchased apps. You need the GUI to update those apps at present time since Apple did not include a tool to automate those updates.\nThe first just scans for appropriate updates. The second installs all updates and only restarts if the updates call for a restart.\nPlay around to see what works best for you. It's trivial to automate these using launchd if that suits your needs as well.\nI've had better luck rebooting the Macs before the update. If I'm going to cut users off with unsaved data, I'd rather do that first and let the update go cleanly. Updating a program that is currently running is something I like to avoid.\nHere is a nice article explaining the details from Apple. It works fine on non-server version of Mac OS X as noted at the end of the article.\n\nA: The softwareupdate command was updated with MacOS release 10.13.4 with a --restart option. Use\nsudo softwareupdate --install --all --restart\n\nAnd the computer will restart if needed\n", "Q: Active Directory login takes from seconds to minutes on OSX Login screen loads a very long time occasionally. It's annoying to wait for 5 minutes just to be able to use the MacBook. I have not been able to find a reason why it sometimes takes a very long time and sometimes loads instantly.\nI have a MacBook Pro with in OSX 10.6.6 and Active Directory corporate Windows network  controlled username and password. I also use a setting that requires password login after 15 minutes of sleep or screensaver in case I forget my laptop on a train or something.\nWhat can be done to solve this issue?\n\nA: There are several ways to get a Mac to work on an Active Directory network. Apple has some issues with it's Samba implementation that seem to cause these sorts of issues. I have been using software from Likewise to join our Macs to our domain. Starting with version 6.1 (currently in pre-release) the issues that you describe are greatly reduced (not eliminated) -- it still takes me about 45 seconds to log in.\nIf you have administrative control over your Mac, then you will certainly want to read up on migrating from your current AD implementation to Likewise. If you are not a admin, then you will need to speak to your IT department. It is important to note that Likewise should be installed as a local admin, and upgrades should not be applied as a domain user (even if they are an admin), but as a local user. \n", "Q: Syncing address book contacts through iPad and iPhone? Is there a way to sync Address Book contacts added from an iPad, on iPhone and Mac without having to manually sync with a USB cable and through the Mac?\n\nA: There are a number of options, these solutions assume you want to sync your contacts to Apple's Contacts.app on your iOS device and not a third party app.\nMobileMe\nApple's service is the most straight forward (it should just work) and offers other benefits such as storage.\nMicrosoft Exchange\niOS devices can use Microsoft's Exchange protocol to update the device's email, calendar and contacts. If you are running Snow Leopard you can use also connect your Address Book, iCal, and Mail to the same exchange server and your contacts will sync between your iOS device and your Mac's Address Book. A free option would be to use Google sync on your iOS device which uses Microsoft's exchange protocol. However Google Sync doesn't work for desktop applications like Address Book right now. So you would have to find a way to sync your Address Book contacts to Google which is possible.\n\nA: With Snow Leopard's address book, you can sync you computers contacts to your gmail. Go into address book preferences/accounts and then choose the option to sync with google. See this link on how to do that.\nhttp://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=AddressBook/5.0/en/21507.html\nThen on the iPhone or iPad go into settings/mail,contacts,calender and set up ur gmail as Microsoft Exchange. See this link on how to do that.\nhttp://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740\n\nA: You can host your own calendar (CalDAV) and contact (CardDAV) server using Mac OS Server ‘Leopard’ or Server ‘Snow Leopard.’ These will sync over the Internet to iCal and Address Book on your Macs, and to your iOS devices.\nIf you don’t want to get an expensive Mac Mini Server you could go with using an old retired notebook or even a virtual machine with a Linux installation. The open source project DAViCal will provide you with both CalDAV and CardDAV services.\nI am personally using an installation of DAViCal too keep my Macs and iOS devices in sync using a older machine I have at home as the server. I would recommend this solution as you remain in control of your own data. Getting it up and running requires some work, but you would be able to congratulate yourself with the accomplishment. There are step-by-step tutorials for setting up both Linux and the DAViCAL software available.\n\nA: Here is a useful guide about syncing contacts between iOS devices. I used to have MobileMe set up and used it in combination with the Address book. I am on a Windows PC now and manage my contact through Windows Contacts for my PC a third party app to transfer contacts between my iPhone and iPad 3 (I currently do not use the same iCloud account for both).\n\nA: You can sign up for Apple's MobileMe service. It is $99/year and is the only option (AFAIK) for what you want to do.\n", "Q: How much broadband data does Apple TV use in the menu screen? We have a house in a rural area where broadband data is capped at a really low rate (only 9 GB per month upload and download total, then $10 per additional GB) - the only way to get broadband other than satellite is through a local provider that uses a wireless signal.\nOnce we have set up our Apple TV (which we have used very easily at a location with unlimited broadband), will it use data at all while we are streaming content from iTunes?\nSince the Apple TV menu shows you the Netflix, YouTube and iTunes Store options, among others, I assume some data usage is inevitable.  Does anyone know how much - more importantly, how little - that data usage would be if we are just quickly checking the menu, rather than actually streaming a movie from Netflix or downloading something from iTunes?\nThe other option is to disconnect the wifi router from the modem when we watch Apple TV - but that's a hassle.\n\nA: If you consider a movie to be changing data 24 frames per second and compare the size of the menu art compared to the size of a movie screen you will quickly realize the menu items are negligible.\nYou will blow through a months worth of menu data in less than 4 minutes of a TV show through netflix or one short youtube video.\nDo watch your data consumption - streaming music is moderate use - streaming video is heavy use.\n", "Q: Upgrade the hdd in the new mid 2011 iMac without buying an Apple certified hdd? It has been recently discovered that Apple uses a new 7 pin hdd connection in their mid 2011 iMacs. When a none Apple certified hdd is installed the fans kick on during boot and system fails to start. Is a way to override the check for an Apple certified hdd either through a software(ktext?) or hardware(jump pins) modification?\n\nA: HDD Fan Control is supposed to effectively solve this problem, which they reiterated today at TUAW.\n\nCheck OWC's blog post about it and the comment by OWC's Grant from this morning: they're getting close to figuring it out.\n\nA: I would stay away from the hdd fan control, mainly because it isn't a long term fix. Although it is an easy solution now, all it would take is a software upgrade from apple to cause it to be useless... a patch could then be made by hdd fan control, but there may be a time delay, in which you would be stuck with the imac fans spinning at nearly 6000rpm instead of the idle speed of 1000rpm... its loud to say the least.\nIf you want a hardware fix, i've come up with a solution. I'll expand on it a little without going into too much technical detail. (sorry my reply is a bit late, i only just came across this message online)\nFor starters, a standard SATA power cable uses only 4 cables, despite having a 15pin connector. This is because the pins are broken down in sets of 3, and each cable type can be combined after it leaves the connector. (the main reason for this is because the current on each individual pin cannot move fast enough on a single pin to power the 3.5\" drives, so they have to have 3x 12v, 3x 3.3v, 3x 5v then 2 sets of 3x coms, which are then combined onto 1 cable... so the 4 cables used are 12v, 3.3v, 5v and coms)\nWithout going into too much technical detail, two coms tracts send the data from the internal SMART disk of the hard drive to the main logic board. The difference between Apples drives and an industry standard drive is that the firmware revision differs... The logic boards in the 2011 iMacs can only communicate with certain revisions of this firmware, and after testing nearly 100 different drives, i have been unsuccessful in finding a revision that works with it without changing the hardware or running the software. (which isn't free by the way, its a £20 download, but you can download a sample of the app to test it beforehand)\nWith the 2009 and 2010 iMacs that use the internal SMART disk to convey the hard drives temperature, i have found certain industry standard firmware revisions do work with it, but each manufacturer uses a different connection type, as they dont use the SATA power cable to send the data, but instead use a separate 2 pin connector cable that goes to the logic board directly. As there is no central source of firmware revisions that will work with it, maintaining stock of the drives that do work has proven to be a pain, as testing a drive from each stock with a 2009 or 2010 machine is not the easiest option. (suppliers are not able to specify firmware revisions when shipping drives in my experience, so restocking a specific revision that previously worked is not possible)\nNeedless to say, i found a sensor that operates at the same frequency as the internal SMART disk for the 09/10 imac, and its part number is 593-1029 (you can look it up on www.thebookyard.com) its listed as the LCD cable for the same range, but it is compatible with the hard drive port, as i have done rigorous testing on this. all you need to do is replace the current sensor cable, then adhere the sensor to the drive (then it will act as a surface temperature sensor instead of an ambient temperature sensor)\nAs for the 2011 iMac problem, the easiest solution was to make a cable myself. So, instead of explaining the whole process in all its technical glory, here is the link to the part on the site. http://www.thebookyard.com/product.php?products_id=10085\nAs for an easier to fit solution, i am currently working on an adapter solution that will not require loosening the screws on the logic board to fit a replacement cable. (As the SATA ports are on the underside of the logic board by the graphics card port)\nI have also written a small blog about it here if you want a bit more detail, otherwise i can explain the process in more detail if you'd prefer. \nhttp://thebookyard.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/the-aluminium-imac-ranges-and-their-hard-drives-2011-hd-problem-resolved/\nBut all is not lost, as there is always a solution! Even if it takes a bit of creative finagling to do so.\n", "Q: How can I un-jailbreak an iPhone 4? I have purchased an iPhone 4 about six-seven months ago. Roughly two weeks into using it I have decided to jailbreak the iPhone for ideological reasons (I am not a big fan of The Man telling me how to manage my stuff)\nHowever, after all these passing months I can honestly tell that I have not even used any of the jailbreak features even once.\nI recall jailbreaking erased my entire phonebook, SMS logs and all other data. Since that was only about two weeks without much usage - I didn't mind too much. This time it seems a bit more worrisome, as the phonebook and SMS contain a lot more information, some which I do not want to be lost.\nI should mention that only part of my phonebook is synchronized with my google account (is there an easy way to transfer the rest?), and that I use Linux and a windows on VirtualBox where my iTunes fails to backup the data on my iPhone (this might be redeemable with some very hard work, though.)\nMy question, if so, is whether or not all my non-Cydia-and-otherwise-non iTunes-apps will be gone if I just run an upgrade through iTunes, and whether or not this upgrade is going to obliterate my phonebook and/or other databases?\n\nA: As long as you backup your iPhone by syncing with iTunes, it'll restore every non-jailbreak thing just fine. The only exception being your login information for accounts and whatnot, unless iTunes is encrypting your backup.\nYou can verify your backup by going to iTunes' preferences and selecting the devices tab.\nI'm not sure if it's still an issue, but if you happen to be using a tweak like \"Five Icon Dock\", you'll want to remove the extra icons from your dock, otherwise when you boot-up after restore, Springboard will constantly crash.\n\nA: just do a backup on your iPhone (in iTunes right click -> select Backup, on the name of your phone in the left hand column under Devices) and then Transfer Purchases the same way when the backup completes. This saves SMS, call logs, the camera roll, app data, phone book, folders, etc... just about everything on the phone except the media (audio and video). When that is complete just click on restore in iTunes, wait for it to complete and it will be un-jailbroken. After the iPhone restarts at the end of restore process it will tell you an iPhone was previously synced with this computer, click restore from backup and make sure the most recent backup is selected then Continue. When this is complete your iPhone will be un-jailbroken with all of your data back on it.\n", "Q: Your Apple ID or password was entered incorrectly - Eror while login I tried to login with my apple id to develper.apple.com and application loader\nBut is giving the error -Your Apple ID or password was entered incorrectly\nI know my login credentials are right.\nPlease help..\n\nA: Click the \"forgot you password?\" link and request a new password.\n", "Q: Can I have custom GarageBand track icons?

How can I know where does an app locate its configuration files such as in ~, /Library, ~/Library etc, other than browsing and guessing?\nI mean is there some command like findfiles this.app that prints them out or something?  \n\nA: There are a few programs which can give you insight into file system usage while programs are running. \nThere are a few good terminal ones like lsof, but I really like fseventer for its simple graphical interface and play/pause button.\nAll you would do is run your program, run fseventer, and if you make a change to your preferences or configuration and it is stored in a file, it will show you the process touching the file.\nIf it is something like Entourage which stores its rules in files but then keeps them in memory until quit/start, you may want to close other programs and launch your program of choice to see what it loads, then quit it to see the reverse process.\n\nA: Applications in Mac have their own application identifier. They use this identifier for naming their preference files and other files such as caches. To find this identifier, view the application's package content (right click and select) and go into the contents folder and open Info.plist in TextEdit.\nAn example of an application identifier is:\ncom.CompanyName.ApplicationName (for companies)\n\nor\norg.OrgName.ApplicationName (for organizations)\n\nSo the application identifier for Google Chrome, for example is:\ncom.google.Chrome\n\nTo actually find the identifier, open TextEdit, and press Cmd+F to open the Find dialog, and type CFBundleIdentifier. The line after this is the application identifier.\nAfter finding the application identifier you can find the files easily in the usual folders. However, spotlight does not search such items, and you would have to use a terminal command:\nfind ~ -iname \"com.company.application\"\n\nto search the whole hard drive:\nsudo find /  -iname \"com.company.application\"\n\nFor other files, you can use fseventer, as hobs pointed out, to search in real time for what the application accesses, writes and reads on the hard drive.\n\nA: Found a good tutorial which scans for files modified after a defined timestamp.\nhttp://www.westwind.com/reference/OS-X/finding-settings.html\n", "Q: How do I install the 3.0 iPhone simulator on Xcode 4? I want to install the 3.0 iPhone simulator on my Xcode 4.0.2 installation. Is there a way to do this?\nI want to test my app against 3.0 to make sure it runs correctly (due to some changes in UIScrollView mainly), but I don't have access to any device with 3.0. I know that the simulator != the device, but testing against the 3.0 simulator is better than nothing.\n\nA: Xcode, the iOS SDK and the Simulator come bundled together in one installer because they share libraries and other stuff in the Developer folder.  Mismatched combinations probably won't work.  Even if you somehow manage to install the 3.0 Simulator with your current Xcode+SDK installation, it would probably crash.\nSo you need to find a complete installer for an old iPhone OS 3.0 SDK with Xcode 3.x, and install with that on a Mac that to get a working iPhone OS 3.0 Simulator.  You may or may not be able to get an SDK/Xcode combination that old that runs on OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, so you may need to find an older Mac that can boot into OS X 10.5 Leopard as well.\nAdded:\nAnyway, a developer should only be supporting 3.0 devices by actually having one around on which to test their app, before setting the Deployment Target that low when submitting an app for live customers use.  Customers are not supposed to be some test dummies for random developers.  \nJust test apps on the oldest, lowest OS version, device you can find (beg, borrow, buy used and dented, drive across town), and use that as your Deployment Target.  If you can't find a device that old, neither can the vast majority of the customers for your app.\n\nA: Install the old version of Xcode, do a clean, set it to the old iOS build target (say iOS 4.2) and build it. I am using 3.2.5 and managed to actually find a few limitations in iOS 4.2 that 5.0 was happy with. You can download old Xcode and Simulator versions here: http://iphonesdkdev.blogspot.com/2010/04/old-versions-of-iphone-sdk.html. But, you need to have install the old Xcode + SDK to use the old iOS in the simulator.\n", "Q: Bluetooth mouse that doesn't require a USB dongle Since my Macbook only has two USB ports, I'd like to get myself a mouse that can pair with the Mac's built-in bluetooth. The obvious choice is the Apple Magic Mouse, but at $70 it's pretty much overkill. I don't need the touch functionality, since the Mac's trackpad already does a great job with that. \nI'm mostly looking for something that allows me accurate control, isn't too large (so I can toss it in my backpack), and isn't too expensive. And looks nice next to the Aluminum Macbook, or course. :)\n\nA: The Logitech V470 Cordless Laser Mouse for Bluetooth® may suit your needs.\nBTW: I've used Logitech mice for a long time now and can say that they're built very well. They're a pleasure to use. The MX1000 is the greatest mouse ever built in my opinion. I've yet to use a Bluetooth mouse though.\n\nA: I've used the RadTech BT500 for some time and love it.  It's small, rechargeable, works well, and silver in color, to look good next to aluminum Macs.\n\nA: Read about the Mad Catz R.A.T M. It is a mobile Gaming Mouse which doesen't require a dongle.\n", "Q: What is default (factory pre-loaded) iOS for iPhone 3gs I was so happy with my iphone when I bought it. It was so fast... now, after dozen of upgrades i hate my iphone....\ndoes anyone remember what was the original version of iOS when they bought their 3GS\n\nA: The 3GS originally shipped with iOS 3.0, which was called iPhone OS 3.0 at the time.\n\nA: The 3GS is still available for sale today, and it ships with the latest version of iOS 4 pre-installed.\nThe 3GS was launched within a few days of iOS 3.0's launch, so for a long time it was sold with that pre-installed.\nSo the answer depends on when you bought your phone. But it should not be slow with the latest version of iOS. I know several people running iOS 4 on their 3GS without any problems.\n\nA: Some iPhone 3GSs even come with iOS 5 preinstalled. Before that, the 8 gb models would come with iOS 4 installed. Before that, they came with iOS 3. That's the list of preinstalled iOSs. The 16 and 32 gig models only came with iOS 3. Sadly, they were discontinued on September 12th , 2012.\n\nA: go to \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone\nand then go to \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history\n", "Q: Can I get an app for free if I already purchased it on the same account, but on a different computer? I bought the Xcode app from Apple's Mac App Store last night on a computer which I ended up returning. I now have a new Mac. After logging into the App Store, I am asked to repurchase the app.\nShould I do it? Will it know that the app has already been purchased on this account? Is there a way to re-download it instead of repurchasing?\n\nA: Yes, if you download the same app off of the same account it will be redownloaded for free without charging your account again.

It is not the exact model that is listed as \"AirPrint\" compatible.  Is there a way to get it to work any way?\nI would love to be able to print from my iPhone.\n\nA: Its not quite AirPrint, but have you tried the official HP ePrint Home & Biz application?\nI have it installed on my iPhone and it picks up and prints to HP Photosmart C4500 really easily. Also, installing this application adds a \"open with\" option when you are viewing a compatible document (pdf/doc/etc) in the web browser / email application etc. That means you just click \"open with\" then select Hp ePrint and it opens the document straight into the app ready for printing. you even get a print preview as you would printing from your desktop.\n", "Q: Cannot capture VHS video in iMovie 09 I'm trying to digitise several (as in about a hundred) VHS tapes, but I've run into two problems before I've even begun.\nI've got two major problems; The first being iMovie 09 won't capture VHS from my VCR (but it will capture analogue output from a DVD recorder) and the second is iMovie isn't giving me any video/audio preview when capturing video.\nI've connected my VCR to the Canopus ADVC 100 ports on the front of the box via a scart to RCA composite cable. Then I've connected the ADVC to my MacBook Pro (Snow Leopard, 10.6.6) via the 4-pin FireWire port on the front to my Macs' 9-pin Firewire 800 port using a 6-pin to 9-pin adapter.\nWhen I switch on the ADVC, iMovie detects it and properly names it in the \"Camera\" drop-down box and opens the capture window with a blue screen. Sometimes (if I've just opened iMovie and this is the first capture I've done) it says \"Play\" in the top left hand corner of the preview. Since this is the first time I've used any analogue-digital hardware and iMovie, I'm not sure whether this is significant or not.\nIf I try to capture footage by clicking the \"import\" button, whether my VCR is playing or not, iMovie says it is recording (the red recording dot appears in the timer) but the timer does not start counting, as if it knows there is no signal and thus nothing to capture. Nothing is captured when I stop the import. I've tried two different VCRs but couldn't capture from either.\nHowever, if I capture DVD video from my DVD recorder (using a different composite cable to connect the RCA inputs on the front of the ADVC to my DVD recorders' RCA outputs), the capture works (the timer increments), but there is no audio or video displayed in the iMovie preview window. I've read in other threads that there will be no audio because this is apparently not supported as of iMovie 06+, but I've not read anything definite about there being no video preview. So this is my second problem - no preview available - just a blue screen.\nI've also tried plugging the yellow RCA video plug into a RCA video - S-Video (7-pin) adapter cable and plugging that into the 7-pin S-Video \"Video in\" input on the back, but that made no difference to anything. I've tried using a different 4-pin to 6-pin Firewire cable (with the same aforementioned 6-pin to 9-pin adapter) but didn't make any difference either.\nMy DIP switch settings are 1 = ON (I'm trying to capture PAL VHS video recorded on PAL VCRs and iMovie is set to PAL as well) and the rest are set to OFF.\nMy Mac is able to detect the ADVC (it appears under \"Firewire bus\" in the System Profiler when it is powered on).\nOne last point to make - the only VCRs I have available are the kind which are integrated into the TV unit, i.e. a TV-VCR combi unit. Would using a standalone VCR make a difference?\n\nA: Yes, use iMovie HD. I switched back and used the ADVC with iMovie HD, and it worked fine.  iMovie 8.0.6?  Seemed like it was importing the whole time, but: where was the file? OY. Glad I kept iMovie HD.\n\nA: I would recommend not using iMovie '09, at least not for the capturing part. Use iMovie HD (it should be on the install disc for iMove '09), and if needed, move the clips over to iMovie '09.\n", "Q: What is the quickest Mac OS X app to use to remove the background of an image to make it transparent? I followed the instructions in How to use Preview for Basic Image Editing: Remove Backgrounds and Extract Shapes to use the Preview app to remove backgrounds with an image. The problem is that the \"Instant Alpha\" tool sometimes does not capture all the pixels and can't figure out how to use the rectangle tool to remove those remaining pixels. I tried highlighting the pixels and then pressing delete but it doesn't work. Can someone explain how to do it or recommend another free, lightweight Mac OS X tool to remove background to make it transparent? I do not want to use Photoshop or anything else expensive.\n\nA: You said \"free,\" but you also mentioned \"nothing expensive like Photoshop\"; there are solutions to your problem that do cost something but are nowhere nearly as expensive as Photoshop.\nPixelmator is great for certain kinds of quick image editing. It's only $30 right now, though that will probably go up when the next major release finally comes out; I believe it's normally $60.\nThere's also Acorn, which is very similar and perhaps a hair's breadth easier to use, though since they've already had their first post-App Store major version release, it's more expensive at the moment ($50).\nIf it absolutely must be freeware, do have a look at Seashore, mentioned in a comment by Ian C.\n\nA: Just selecting an area and hitting delete just as you do with the Alpha tool should do it fine.  I tend to get a good outline with the alpha tool, then zoom in and use the lasso selection tool to draw around any stray pixels - remember to complete the lasso yourself, or it may complete it for you and if the end is not near the start, it will just draw a big line between the 2 across whatever is in its way.\nYou don't say what OS you are using, but I've done it this way in every OS since Tiger...\n\nA: The best simple image editor is Seashore. It's an open-source Cocoa app built around GIMP's technology. That means it provides advanced photo editing capabilities for free and does it in a simple-to-install native app.\n\nA: You can use GIMP, which is free, but it runs in X11, which you will have to download separately. The GIMP has tools that are similar to Photoshop's tools.\n\nA: You can Create Your Own Transparent Image Files With Preview\nBasically using Instant Alpha button, select the area you want to make it transparent, then delete the selection, then it will be done.\nJust see the link below.\nhttp://www.cultofmac.com/216093/create-your-own-transparent-image-files-with-preview-os-x-tips/\n\nA: The best app for Mac OS X to use to remove the background of an image is BackgroundEraser (only $1.99). You can remove quickly any background.\nThere's also a video demonstration.\n\nA: It can be complicated. Go to Super PhotoCut in the App Store. It is really super to instantly remove background from photo within a few seconds. I used it a lot which saved me much time.\n\n", "Q: How to connect a Facebook account to Adium? For some reason I can't get Adium to connect to Facebook. Facebook refuses to log me in every time I try.\nI have the right email address and the right password... but it keeps asking for password.\n\nA: Facebook updated its chat system, breaking Adium's support. You can still connect to Facebook but you need to setup the account as a Jabber account.\nYour username will be Your_Facebook_Username@chat.facebook.com. The server is chat.facebook.com. The port is 5222 and you should not use SSL.\n\nA: On April 30th 2015, Facebook disabled Jabber support. There is currently no way to connect to Facebook's chat service from Adium. The developers are aware of the issue, and work is being done in Pidgin (whose protocol library Adium piggy-backs on) to make Facebook chat functional again.\n", "Q: using gcc, g++ outside of xcode on mac I'd like to spend some time aside from the IDE for a bit and use command line gcc, g++ compilers.\nWhen i use my terminal, they however, can't be found. \nHow can i install them?\nI honestly am surprised why these two don't come standard.\nPlease let me know.\n\nA: If you have not already done so, you should install the development tools that come with your Mac in one of the OS discs, which include gcc. So gcc and other such programs are standard, but not installed by default (I suppose the thinking behind this choice is that either one does not need them and won't miss them, or he won't have no trouble in installing them when needed).\n", "Q: transfer iTunes from Windows 7 to OSX I store my music on a network location \\192.168.1.6\\music   I added that folder to iTunes on Windows 7.  I want to use a new Mac and I'm wondering what's the easiest/fastest way to transfer all the iTunes settings, metadata, playlists, etc from Windows to OSX?\n\nA: Just copy over the \"iTunes\" folder which should be located under your user's music/my music folder. If you can't find a folder there named \"iTunes\", you must have moved it to another location. To check, go to iTunes preferences and read the location under the \"Advanced\" tab.\nUsing any means wether it be network file transfer or using a USB Drive, move the \"iTunes\" folder to the \"Music\" folder in your mac's user account\n", "Q: Activity Monitor not showing correct memory usage? I have a strange memory issue: I've been running out of free memory for months now, which I thought was OK, since I use the Creative Suite apps and Xcode regularly, all of them is quite memory intensive.\nBut somehow the situation seems to be getting worse. Today I logged off to free up some RAM, then when logged back in, all the 4 GB of my RAM was used. (I've uploaded the list to here)\nI exported the processes, and added the memory usage, but they add up to 684 MB only.\n(\"All Processes\" is selected in Activity Monitor)\nHow could I check which process is using up the memory in the system?\n\nA: Most of the difference was marked probably memory marked as inactive. Any app can still use this memory, so it's not marked as used by some process.\nFor more info about inactive memory, see this thread.\nWired memory usually makes up a much smaller portion. This is memory used by the OS; it isn't available to your apps.\nFor more info, see the Apple article Reading System Memory Usage in Activity Monitor.\n", "Q: Change Snow Leopard Terminal window dependant on SSH Server I can find it hard to differentiate between my dev and production server.

In my previous question I had asked about backing up the content of the iPhone in order to un-jailbreak my iPhone.\nI was told that simply synchronizing with iTunes should do the trick, and I did that. However I did not get a certain answer about the media.\nWhen I had applied the jailbreak patch I recall it completely obliterating everything I had: contacts, logs, apps and even mp3s and such.\nI fear that after applying the update to my iPhone all my music will be gone (it will still be on my computer, but transferring all those files again and setting up playlists is something that generally I wish to avoid)\nSo all in all, after applying the update to my iPhone, what happens to my music, playlists, photos, videos and voice memos?\n\nA: A normal update doesn't delete your content, but I don't think you can delete your jailbreak with an update. You can always try. If it fails, you'll have to restore. Then you'll lose your music and apps from the device. ;-)\n", "Q: How to configure Terminal to be \"Putty-like\" when it comes to copy-paste with mouse? As a long time Putty user, I love how upon selecting a text it gets copied  into the buffer and upon right clicking it gets pasted back in.\nIs there a way to configure Terminal to behave the same way?\n\nA: If you have a three-button mouse (e.g., the Apple Mighty Mouse scroll ball can act as a third button), Terminal will paste the current selection if you Middle-Click (just like X11 and xterm). It is the same as invoking the Edit > Paste Selection command, which has the keyboard shortcut Shift-Command-V.\nAs of OS X 10.8, selecting text in a terminal copies the text to a pasteboard and Paste Selection pastes the contents of this pasteboard (akin to X11’s PRIMARY). It now behaves very much like xterm under X11. As a result, Paste Selection and Middle-Click are now available when there is no selection, pasting the same text until something else is selected, and the text persists when quitting/reopening Terminal. The pasteboard has the identifier com.apple.Terminal.selection and is available to other programs.\nAlso, you can drag-and-drop selected text to Paste it. You can of course drag to other terminal windows (or other applications), but you can also just drag a few pixels and then release to Paste into the current terminal.\n\nA: NO need to download anything. In Terminal do\n\n\n*\n\n*select text to copy\n\n*to paste, click the middle button of the mouse, or\n(cmd + shift + v)\n\n\nI just tried in Yosemite.  \nAlso works in High Sierra.\n\nA: shift-⌘-V works on El Capitan. Feel free to edit if you have information about earlier releases\n\nA: Highlight the command and press Shift-Cmd-V to paste the highlighted data.\n\nA: Terminal is limited in its configurability but iTerm2 is a Terminal replacement that does what you ask and more. Including bookmarks for ssh sessions not unlike puTTY.\n\nA: Simply install http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/ which includes both these options in the preferences.\n", "Q: Location of error icon Where is the location of the error and the warning icon?\nI'm talking about the red octagon with a ! inside it and the yellow triangle also containing a !.\nExample: http://www.askdavetaylor.com/1-blog-pics/mac-usb-device-removal-error.png\n\nA: /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/AlertStopIcon.icns\n\nA: I remember that some system app had both icons in its application bundle, which you can open by dragging it to Preview.app.\nA little note: Apple doesn't want you to use these icons as they are reserved for the system only.\n\nYou can find the Warning icon by dragging /System/Library/Core Services/Problem Reporter.app to Preview.app. Save the ICNS file as PNG and you're good to go — even though it's not a 512 × 512 image.\n\nYou can find a small error (32 × 32) icon at /Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DevToolsInterface.framework/Versions/A/Resources/XCBuildBadge-Error.png.\n", "Q: Sips not working with pict, qtif and sgi files The terminal command sips -s format pict /path/to/image.ext --out /path/to/output.pic ouputs Error: Unsupported output format com.apple.pict even though if you do man sips and go down to format, there is written that it supports jpeg | tiff | png | gif | jp2 | pict | bmp | qtif | psd | sgi | tga.\nIs this normal and can you fix it anyway?\n\nA: Not the definitive answer but be careful with sips.

It's possible to get iTunes to start a song in the middle, say, after a long introductory section. (This is great for party mixes, where one doesn't want to interrupt the energy of a mix.) \nIn a similar vein, is it possible to get iTunes to pause for several seconds after playing a song? For example, in an album of several associated pieces, it would be nice if iTunes would pause for around 30 seconds after the last movement of one piece and the first of the next piece. (All within the same album.) This would be particularly useful for classical music, where each movement is its own track, but several such pieces are jammed onto an album. \n\nA: You're asking two questions here. \n\nIt's possible to get iTunes to start a song in the middle?\n\nYes, for each individual track, you can press CMD+I (get info) and get to this tab:\n\nWhere you can check Start Time, Stop Time or both and specify a time. \nPart of a Gapless album is useful too, since it will not leave a gap time between tracks (nice when you have live albums or such).-\n*Is it possible to get iTunes to pause for several seconds after playing a song?*\n\nThis is not natively possible within iTunes and you'll have to perform further research, try to find an App that does it and/or create some sort of Applescript.

You may be able to find it by hovering your mouse over the wifi icon in the taskbar, or if not open a command window and run 'ipconfig'.\nOnce you have the ip address, you can browse to it from the iPad at the URL:\nhttp://a.b.c.d/\nwhere a.b.c.d is the IP address of the laptop.\nYou will have to ensure your Windows firewall is allowing access and ensure IIS is listening to this IP address - by default it listens to all IP addresses on the machine, so unless you changed it, you  should be ok.\n\nA: Try hostname instead of IP. And make sure that your webserver is allowing access from other IP as well instead of just 127.0.0.1/localhost\n\nA: You need to find out what your server software is listening for. Is it just a hostname? an IP-address? Usually, you should be able to use the http://hostname.local address, and it should work over the ad-hock network.\nA clever little network utility called Localghost should work with any ad-hoc network you create on the same machine as the server, by the by. If you have special hostname needs.\n", "Q: Why is my iPhone clock running behind 20 min? My iPhone clock is at 15:32 when the actual time is at 15:52! why is it twenty minutes behind?\nThe time zones are all correct and I have a screenshot that I will upload soon.\n\nA: I recently had a similar problem and this solved it.\nCheck that your time is set automatically by going to Settings.app -> General -> Date & Time -> Set Automatically to 'ON'\n\nA: It will also update if you just go to airplane mode and back out.\nAnd if you ever lose signal and get it back.\nIt gets info from tower (or repeater). Towers are correct, but many repeaters are old and cannot be remotely administered thus can have bad time on them. If you lose signal then get signal again from a repeater (common in cities with tall builidings) it could be wrong depending how old it is.\n", "Q: marking iCal events as private and sync it with exchange, windows mobile I am using Outlook/Exchange at work and iCal at home.

While brew installed dependencies (tiff and little-cms) it finished just fine, but when it went to compile imagemagick itself, it crashes.\nDuring make install for imagemagick, the system fans just spin up then my computer shuts down.  \nI've looked at mkmf.log and CrashReporter, but nothing is in them about this install.  \nI'm using Xcode is 3.2.6 with iOS SDK 4.3.\nAny other log files I can view?  Any ideas?\n\nEDIT - I noticed that this was happening during compiling only.  Also noticed that fans started to spin up before crashes but never got a chance to spin to max speed.  I guess somewhere along the way, either one of my fans went out, or something of the sort.\nSo I did the following:\nI downloaded and installed MenuMeters, then smcFanControl.\nI set the Higher RPM in smcFanControl to max.  Right before I started to install apps which needed compiling like imagemagick I turned smcFanControl to max and monitored CPU temp.  So far I've been able to install without crashes, but now I know I need to be replacing my mac soon.\n\nA: Maybe this is a hardware error.

I've been looking around to find out how to change MIDI sounds for the Built-in MIDI synthesizer inside Mac OS X, haven't found anything, is there a way to do that?\n\nA: Louis Boux wants to substitute the default DLS soundfont of General MIDI sounds used by QuickTime to another DLS soundfont. Such soundfonts are files that end in .sf2 format.\nIt was possible to do this in earlier versions of QuickTime, such as QuickTime 5 or QuickTime 6, back around the year 2002 and earlier. In fact, I did this myself on older systems. However, QuickTime X cannot read an .sf2 file directly. It must be converted into .dls format.\nBy way of background, when you click on a standard MIDI file linked to a Web page, for instance, QuickTime plays it back inside your Web browser using QuickTime's built-in MIDI sound library, which is of poor quality. This sound library was licensed from the Roland company some 15 years ago and has never been improved upon.\nThe soundfont that I was able to use as a substitute in older systems is a GeneralMIDI soundfont which is provided with MakeMusic Finale Reader, which is free.\n\nA: If you can download standard MIDI files and you want to play them back to hear a better-quality audio rendering that QuickTime can provide, you would do well to purchase Finale Notepad 2011 for US $10. It will open a standard MIDI file and attempt to create sheet music standard notation from it. But even if you don't want the sheet music notation you can then use Finale Notepad to play back what it has imported as audio, and it will do a quite good job of that. You can download a free demo version of Finale Notepad 2011 which will function for 30 days.\nNo version of GarageBand has ever provided a complete General MIDI soundset, meaning providing a sample library for every single musical instrument defined in the General MIDI Specification. Thus, when you import a Standard MIDI File into GarageBand, it matches up the track names and instrument names in the standard MIDI file to whatever GarageBand has on hand. Some sounds, like piano or guitar, it handles very well, but less common instrument sounds are not represented at all in the standard GarageBand sound library and so GarageBand does not know what to do with those instruments and substitutes other, inappropriate instruments and sounds.\nIf you want to try and convert the Finale Notepad 2011 sound set to a format that QuickTime will recognize, as you described above, here is where to find the file.\nOnce you install Finale Notepad 2011, you can find its Soundfont file at:\n/Library/Application Support/MakeMusic/Finale Notepad 2011/Audio Support/synthgms.sf2\nThe SoundFont is 41.7MB in size.\nMake a backup copy of the Soundfont first, and try to convert the copy.\nAnd thanks for providing more information on how to convert it. I'm going to try this myself, as I also have a Windows 7 machine here at home.\n\nA: You can have Apple DLSMusicDevice recognize an .sf2 file by putting the .sf2 file in ~/Library/Audio/Sounds/Banks/.\nThen you can go into GarageBand and Edit the instrument on a particular track, choose DLSMusicDevice as the soft synth for that track, click on the manual edit button, and choose a different sound synth other than \"QuickTime Music Synthesizer\".\nHowever, this only works from within GarageBand or any other music playback device which can access the DLSMusicDevice as an AU (Audio Unit) virtual instrument plugin. This does not affect the operation of QuickTime in playing back a Standard MIDI File.\nMost multi-track Standard MIDI files will already have the correct General MIDI instrument sound specified at the beginning of each track using a MIDI program control message. A further complication within GarageBand, however, is that there is no way for the user to directly specify which instrument sound is chosen for which track. To do that, you need to send the correct MIDI program change message from an external device such as a MIDI controller keyboard, and record that into a track, as GarageBand has never given the user a way to specify MIDI program change commands internally.\nMost of this information I gleaned from this web page put up by Murray Ewing from 2005.\n\nA: I have documented a method of taking the 41MB General MIDI sound set from Finale Reader 2011 for Mac, which is in .sf2 format, converting it into DLS format, and then hacking QuickTime X and CoreAudio Components in Lion to use the Finale Reader 2011 sound set instead of the stock QuickTime Musical Instrument sound set. This involves using Extreme Sample Converter for Windows, which costs €69, but has a limited free trial download. If anybody is interested you can contact me via email.\n\nA: What are you trying to do? You can always import MIDI files into GarageBand, or play them in a 3rd party player like Rondo. But maybe you're trying to do something else?\n", "Q: iTunes library export when the media is on an external HDD Back when I was using my MBP as a desktop pc I had moved my music archive to an external disk and changed the \"iTunes Media Location\" within iTunes Preferences. Now that worked without any complications for a long while. A couple of months back I got an iMac to replace my old and worn-out laptop, and I figured it wouldnt be more complicated than to change the media location on the iMac to point to where the media is. Oh, how terribly mistaken I was... \nAfter a long wait of importing I realized that all my playlists and an overwhelming majority of my ID tag information has been lost during the importing. I have been reading about the subject, and I understand that iTunes makes use of an XML file as well as a \"library\" file that is located under ~/Music/iTunes. \nMy question is as follows; am I royally screwed or can I save my library by using the xml and library files from my laptop? I would hate to go over tens of thousands of songs, which I have collected and nurtured like small audio babies through out my college years...\nAny idea would be appreciated! \nCHeers,\n\nA: Restore he ~/Music/iTunes directory or just the files in that directory - it contains all the metadata.\nThen change the iTunes Media Location and all should be OK.\nNote for others - when starting with a new machine it is easier to use Migration Assistant to copy from the old machine connected as a firewire target disk then all preferences etc are copied over.\n\nA: What you should have done immediately after you bought the new iMac was to connect the external hard drive containing the iTunes library and before you launch iTunes hold down the ALT/OPTION key on keyboard. iTunes will then ask you to point it to your iTunes library.\nSo go ahead and try this to see if you iTunes library opens like you had it on your old computer.\nAlso, in the future when transferring an iTunes library from 1 computer to another or onto an external drive, navigate to ur iTunes library in finder, copy/move it to your desired location and hold point iTunes to it by holding down ALT/OPTION before clicking to launch the App.\n", "Q: Use MacVim as standard Terminal? I used to love the terminal.app for many reasons.\nI especially liked the way I could navigate to a file and edit using vim it all in one app, without having to leave the keyboard. \nBut, since the terminal.app doesn't support many of vim's rich features, I decided to make the step to MacVim. \nThis breaks the symmetry though, I have to use terminal.app to navigate to a file, edit in MacVim (using mvim of course), quit MacVim and open up the terminal again. \nIsn't there a way to use MacVim in stead of terminal to do all this? I'm not talking about iTerm 2 etc, these apps don't cut is for me. I'm talking about true unix command line in MacVim.. \nThis should be possible, I guess, only... is it?\n\nA: This is an old thread, but just in case someone else has this question:\nmvim -v\n\nA: If you are looking to navigate and open your files from within VIM, there are a couple things I suggest trying out.\n:Sex\n:Sex in VIM or MacVim splits the screen and lets you navigate the file system to find a file.  I have this bound to ;o in my install.  \nNERDTree\nNERDTree is a VIM add-on that gives you a navigable tree view of the filesystem on the left-hand side of VIM.  :NERDTreeToggle ~/path/to/whatever/ will open NERDTree for you, and the root of the tree will be ~/path/to/whatever/.  In my VIM installs I use my home directory, and have it aliased to Control+o in .vimrc:\nmap <C-O> :NERDTreeToggle ~/<CR>\n\n\nA: You're confusing the terminal with the text editor, as other commenters have pointed out. Still, there are a number of ways to make the terminal more vim-like, or vim more terminal-like.\nIf it's vi-style keybindings in the terminal you're after, add set -o vi to your ~/.bash_profile (assuming you're using bash). This will allow you to use vi-style keybindings at the command line (hjkl movement, modal editing, etc.)\nIf you just want to be able to execute unix commands from within vim, prepend ! to the beginning of those commands at the (Mac)Vim command line. For example :!pwd will print the working directory.\nThere are also plugins like Conque which allow you to run a shell from within Vim, which sounds like it may be exactly what you're after.\n\nA: At least now, in 2020, this is built into MacVim. You can open the terminal with :terminal and you can navigate to and from it by tapping <C-w> twice.\nFor more information on usage, type :help terminal.\n", "Q: Why bother updating my iPod touch? I tried syncing my iPod Touch, but the recently purchased/acquired apps were not sent to iTunes. Then I tried to update the iPod and got a message that before updating, I should move the apps to the iTunes library (the implication was that they would be erased if not in the iTunes library). That seems like a lot of work just to update my iPod, especially since I don't know of any actual benefits resulting from the update. What benefits will I get from updating my iPod Touch?\n\nA: Depends on which version of iOS you're on. You gain all features and bug fixes implemented since then and possibly support running more software, or get more features with the software you have. The same as with any computer, really. This Wikipedia article might give you an idea.\nIf you're happy as-is, you might not want to bother. But don't come crying when a long-fixed bug, or maybe a hardware problem (no backups?), eats your music and apps.\n", "Q: Good/inspiring uses of automation on Mac OS X I have been a mac user for quite a while now (about 5-6 years) and I would consider myself rather tech-savvy. That being said I have very little insight to the automation capabilities that have been introduced to OSX a couple of years ago. There are smart folders, folder actions, and other applescripts, as far as I know. \nAs I haven't come across a good tutorial, or some other resource for these new capabilities within OSX, I was wondering if people could give a couple real-life examples of how they are using these.\n\nA: Smart Folders are 'virtual folders'. They're useful for automatically adding or removing items that fit certain criteria.\nFor example, I have a Smart Folder called 'Wallpapers'. I've made the criteria for entrance to this Smart Folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*.png filetype\n\n*2560x1600 pixels\n\n\nAs such files appear (or are removed) anywhere on my system, so they'll be added to or removed from the Smart Folder.\n\nWhen I'm done I can just delete the Smart Folder without deleting the files that reside inside it.\nNB: The default behaviour is to add Smart Folders to the Sidebar. You can uncheck that option when you create the Smart Folder or you can simply drag the Smart Folder out of the sidebar to anywhere you wish. I've chosen the Desktop.\nThis link has a good overview of how they work.\n\nA: Mac OS X Automation\nAn AppleScript. Services, and Automator site from Sal Soghoian, Apple's Product Manager for Automation Technologies. Lots of explanations, examples, and links to tools and useful sites.\nThe training section is particularly helpful if you want to learn more, with tons of useful video training.\n\nA: AppleScript is cool, you can use it and Automater to some really cool stuff from simple batch file renaming to extremely complicated things, like manipulating Illustrator, Photoshop or other files. Very generally speaking, you use AppleScript to drive the applications that you use daily to do the repetitive tasks that can be automated. I've done things like create a script to process emails as they come in. I've written scripts that plat graphs all kinds of stuff. \n\n\n*\n\n*A good resource I have found is macscripter.net\n\n*I have also learned a thing or two from the guys at applescript pro\n\n*This is also a great book AppleScript: The Definitive Guide,\nThat should get you started.\n\nA: Automator is useful whenever you need to do something to a bunch of files at once. For example: \n\n\n*\n\n*Resize a bunch of image files to a maximum width or height\n\n*Add a watermark to a bunch of pdfs\n\n*Merge several pdfs into one\n\n*Get or set PDF metadata\n\n*Change which application opens files\n\n\nMany of these things would be easy if you had just one or two files, but if you want to do it to 30 at once, Automator is a time saver.\n\nA: I find where Applescript really excels is inter application communication. An example of a workflow relatively easy to create with Applescript and that I have previously used:\nCreate a database with location data and photographs in Bento\nSync the databse with an iPhone and then go out into the field and log the information you are interested in\nRe-sync the databse with a mac when returning from the field. \nYou can then use Applescript to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Export the data from the Bento\nDatabase to Google Earth\n\n*Take an image from Google Earth\n\n*Insert the photo and the Google Earth\nimage into an automatically created\nreport in Pages\nIf you have 10's or 100' of data points this sort of workflow can save days. \n", "Q: webcam not working anymore I was using Skype, and suddenly the internal iSight camera stopped working.

Is there any way I could lock up my Mail client so that only I can read my emails(which are present locally on the machine)\n\nA: I would think a good way of doing this might be to package your ~/Library/Mail folder within an encrypted disk image.  As long as it was allowed to grow to an acceptable size, I think it would work.  You would need to move the Mail folder into the disk image, then create a link from your ~/Library folder, called Mail, to the \"real\" mail folder on the disk.\nIn order to get to your mail, (I imagine), firing up Mail.app would follow the link to the disk image, which would prompt for your password, as it needs to mount.\nOnce you're done with your mail, you would be able to dismount the disk image and voila.\nNever having tried this, I have no idea if it would work.\n\nA: This question is more or less related.\nSome answer will allow you to protect the launch of Mail.app\nHowever, like some people said on the question, it won't fully protect you, since the mail database is accessible on your file system, and it's not password protected.\n", "Q: Site for checking so-dimm memory for MacBooks Is there any website, where I can check which memory (RAM) is suitable for any MacBook or Apple computer?\n\nA: Apple provide the technical specifications of all their machines since the mid 1990s\nVarious memory sellers include this information in an easier to access format e.g. Crucial\n", "Q: Sending email with images on iPad?

I have a number of stickies that I place there with common terminal commands I use, but I have the nasty habit of hitting cmd+v instead of cmd+c when I select the command, and cmd+z doesn't undo the paste, which means I have to recreate the sticky.\nAre there any widgets where I can lock the contents, and maybe even auto copy-to-clipboard on click/select?\n\nA: I'd like to introduce you to a different approach. I had a similar problem (not the copy/paste error, but that the notes were not really too cool to work with). \nThis was a long time ago, but since I switched to the free Notational Velocity, I haven't had issues, with the benefit of a very fast (instant) indexing and search in all the trash I want to save :)\nGive it a look, it's open source and very simple to operate.

I want to boot from the install disk to run Disk Utility because I'm having a Time Machine problem (that's not the problem). So I grab the install disk and hold down C as the computer starts up. The logo appears and then it goes straight to the login screen. I did it again, still the same thing.\nSo I double check and saw that Startup disk is set to Snow Leopard disk and there is nothing plugging into the computer besides the power cable. \nSo I did it again, still went straight to the login screen. So I tried booting into safe mode by holding down shift key, still the same result. Also tried it with booting into the Hardware Test with the Application Disk, still booting straight into the login screen.\nThe computer itself works fine, in fact I'm typing with it. The DVD drive works because I just finished playing one of the West Wing DVD and the supplied Apple disks works and load setup just fine.\nThere have been no hardware modifications in the last 6 months.\nCan anyone help with my weird problem please?\n\nA: Press and Hold C button should take place immediately after you switch the MBP on. Delay could cause it to go with the normal boot sequence. Continue to hold until you see the gray screen with the apple on it\n\nA: Try resetting the PRAM by holding down ⌘ + ⌥ + P + R during startup. What SHOULD happen is the machine will chime, the screen will go black and it will chime again. At this point, you can hold the C key and boot to the DVD. Let us know if this works or not.\n\nA: I've heard of issues on some Macs seemingly ignoring the C key on boot. Try holding down ⌥. This will go into the boot menu, and will prevent the default OS from booting, even if nothing else is detected (i.e. external drives, such as optical media). From here you can see if the DVD is available to boot from.\n", "Q: Is there a way to speed up the way Mac responds to my trackpad clicks? I'm new to Mac and Xcode. I realize there's always a significant delay when I click the trackpad and when Mac responds to my action, around 300-500 ms or so, which is very annoying for me. I'm using a new MacBook Pro with plenty of memory and processing power. \nIs it a \"feature\" of Mac? How can I turn if off?\nEDIT: OK, I think it has something to do with the \"tap to click\" feature which I'm currently using. If I press to click, there's no such delay. Anyone has any idea how to fix then?\n\nA: Do you have trackpad dragging enabled?  If so, it has to wait a moment after you tap in case you tap again and turn the action into a drag -- until then, it can't tell if you want to just click, or click-hold-drag.  The only way to eliminate this delay is to turn off trackpad dragging, so there's no ambiguity about what it should do when you tap.\n\nA: *\n\n*Goto System Preferences > Trackpad \n\n*Change the Tracking Speed, Double-Click speed and scrolling speed as necessary. \n\n", "Q: Picasa Mac: timeline or chronological view? In Windows Live Photo Gallery, there's a timeline view (see below) that shows all the Months/Days that any photos in my collection were taken.  I found this very convenient. Is there something similar for the latest Picasa for Mac?\n\n\nA: Not possible, unless the photos are sorted this way on your disk and you use the folder view.\nIn the albums view, all you can do is sort the albums by date, but then they are not grouped by year/month.\nThe picasa timeline feature is not available in the latest release of picasa mac. \n", "Q: how to switch windows faster...? I used to switch windows using win+1..9 on windows 7. Now switching to mac, i wonder if is there any equivalent feature in snow leopard? Or maybe there exist some third-party application support that? \n\nA: There are quite a few commands which let you do this in Mac OS X:\nCmd+Tab for switching applications\nCmd+` for switching windows within applications\nF3/F9 for Exposé (shows all windows in a graphical way, on trackpads you can do a 4-finger swipe down)\nF10 for showing windows of a specific application in Exposé\nF11 for showing desktop and shoving all other windows to the side, on a trackpad its 4 finger swipe up\nThere is also Spaces which is like having multiple desktops, where you can switch to and fro. You can enable it in the Exposé & Spaces prefrence pane in System Preferences and suit the keyboard shortcuts to you liking\n\nA: I don't think that either Expose or Spaces quite do the job well. I bought and use Witch, from Many Tricks. It allows you to switch not only between applications (as you would using Command-Tab), but also between different windows of each application.\nI like the way that Witch gives me preview windows for each application's windows, and that it is fully Spaces-aware. It has a ridiculous amount of options to fine-tune its behavior to your liking. Well worth the $14 US for me.\n\nA: Optimal Layout, an app I developed, lets you start typing in the name of the app/window/tab you want to switch to - this is a really fast way to switch windows if you are a touch typist.\n\nA: If you want a quick simple way of switching apps from a list, try out contexts, reminds me of dmenu from Linux.\n\nA: I haven't used Win7 but I guess you are asking about Expose. F9 key or Four finger swipe down on trackpad that shows all the window and select the one you want to switch to.\nyou may find the F10 key useful if you want to see all windows of an application.\nEdit:\nThe keyboard shortcuts are from external standard keyboard. Apple keyboards have special keys, F3 & Cmd + F3 or Fn + F3\n\nA: hold command and press tab and it will switch between apps\nalso in system preferences see expose and spaces you can set these up to uses f-keys or use buttons on mouse or set hot corners\n", "Q: How do I display long list of client on a page using keynote In keynote each page has a fixed size. Just to impress people I am developing a page which will list around 40 clients.\nI want the list of client names to appear one after another and the list will scroll down.  Sort of like the reverse of a credits scroll at the end of a movie. How do I do that with Keynote?\nFor simplicity you can also imagine as having a single page that lists from 1 to 100 vertically.\n\nA: I hope I unterstood what you want...\nI tried to create an example: scroll_example.zip\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create all your client names\n\n*Group them all to one object (if they're all in one textbox, skip this step)\n\n*Create an action for that object -> Move\n\n*Set the action from bottom to top and specify the duration\n\n*Place your object outside your slide and end position of the move action is of course in your slide (see the example) \n\n\nA: If you wanted to do side to side you could add each item as a separate text item, and then apply a Drift build-in animation. Unfortunately Drift only does left to right, or right to left. But it provides a nice organic move in and move out with acceleration and deceleration. \n", "Q: How to move Mail messages from Apple Mail back on to Hotmail server? When I first configured Apple Mail, I mistakenly opted not to keep a copy of mail on the Hotmail server. I've now changed that, but would like to move Inbox items that are on Apple Mail back on to the Hotmail server.\nAny ideas how I can do that? \n\nA: *\n\n*Setup a second account in Mail for your Hotmail account.

Or can it damage the battery?\n\nA: Long-Term Storage\nIf you don’t plan on using your iPod touch for more than three weeks, Apple recommends that you store it with the battery charged between 50%-75% and the device completely turned off, not just put to sleep.\nIf you store it when the battery is fully discharged, it could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding any charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may experience some loss of battery capacity, meaning it will have a shorter life.\nI'm not sure if this will apply to your situation or not, seeing as it was intended for iPod's and not iPhonee's, but I would think that the concept would be the same.\nThis is the apple page where I got the information from.\n\nA: I would agree with what @Senseful says above but with a caveat about storing electronics in refrigerators. I suspect that they're not especially dry environments so if you are storing a device in one, a sealed container containing a dessicant might be the best way to do it.\n\nA: This answer is somewhat outdated as Apple has added very robust and intelligent overcharging, over rate charging, temperature controls and adaptive charging to extend the life and avoid many of the situations where 2010 to 2015 era battery and charge system tech could result in less service length than ideal.\nEven for 2010 era, what is described is still certainly safe - just turn it off and enjoy your trip. Newer gear makes this even more safe to do. You really have to go out of your way to exhaust batteries - and only random failures result in swaps in my experience now.\niPhone and all other Apple Products shipping in the last 5+ years (excepting the Apple Battery Charger which are NiMH AA cells) have lithium polymer (lipo) batteries. The MacBook Pro and Air batteries are a bit more sophisticated than the iPhone/iPod/iPad batteries but the underlying chemistry is the same.\nIt is safe to store them for months and it's best to charge them 50% and turn off the device for long term storage. All lipo batteries work best when they get a normal serive charge and discharge cycle once a month, but slowly draining from 50% to 0% over 6 to 12 months and then getting charged back to 50% is quite safe for several years of storage.\nI wouldn't worry about leaving it off even 5 months if you starting over 50% but less than 70% charge in a not-hot location.\n\n\n*\n\n*The worst thing for a battery is to\nuse or charge it above 95 degrees F.\n\n*The next worst is deep, deep\ndischarge (well past when the device\nshuts off) - make sure you charge up\nthe battery past half before long periods of \nstorage.\n\n*Repeated long storage while full.\n(don't make a habit of leaving it\n100% full and off for months at a time)\n\n\nI still have my original iPhone going strong (for occasional testing) by waking it up every 6 months at a minimum. If I leave it around 2/3 full and wake it six months later - it's usually got more than 1/4 battery left. I then use it for a few days charging and discharging fully before shutting it off again.\n\nA: As long as you keep the phone in a cool, dry place, it will be fine.\nYou only need to be worried about battery damage during storage when it is long term (e.g. months/years), in which case you would want to keep the battery at 40% and keep it in a cool place such as a refrigerator.\nMore info can be found at batteryuniversity.\n\nA: Yes.  You can store an iPhone for much longer than a week with around a 50% charge on the battery.  I store my old iPhone test spares often for several weeks between uses, and haven't seen the slightest problem.  Apple probably stores repair spares for far longer in their stockrooms.\nBut if you just don't want to run up any charges, take it with you and use it as an iPod, but leave it in Airplane mode for the entire duration of the trip.  If you're paranoid about accidentally turning on cellular data, you can also remove the SIM card, which will prevent any cellular billing to your account.\nOr leave it at home plugged in to the charger, off or on, but locked and in Airplane mode.\n\nA: Absolutely, You will notice that your iPhone was at full charge when you turned it on for the first time, despite it traveling around the world in shipping containes, and siting in a shop store room. Chances are that period was longer than a week and has not harmed your device, another week will not do any harm.\n", "Q: Wireless keyboard on iPad2 I finally got my wireless keyboard for my iPad and I'm quite disappointed. Beside the media controls the whole stuff from the dock-keyboard doesn't work on the wireless one. What's even worse is that I have to disconnect the keyboard when I take the iPad away from the desk and go to the balcony. Is there any way to get the soft-keypad back, when the wireless keyboard is connected without going to the keyboard and pressing the eject-key?\n\nA: Go to Settings -> General -> Bluetooth and switch bluetooth off.\n\nA: Your question seems very similar to this one:\nRe-enabling virtual iPad keyboard with paired Bluetooth keyboard\nI think that the same answers will apply.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Server 10.6.7: Disable Apache?

Sort of. You can pass it command line args to get the kiosk mode as follows:\n/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --kiosk --app=192.168.168.53\n\n=> This opens a chrome window without any window decorations, maximized to full-screen (like any other Mac App that is maximized.\nFor all the Chrome command line args check out:\nhttp://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#load-extension\n\nA: Have you considered using Opera as a browser for the signup. It does provide a kiosk mode that is easy to enable:\n/Applications/Opera.app/Contents/MacOS/Opera -kioskmode -noexit\nThe documentation has information about a 'Go To Home' timeout mode that will restore the kiosk after a set interval.\n\nA: There's a plugin called Saft which enables kiosk mode in Safari. (Saft has been discontinued as of late 2012; it doesn't work beyond Safari 5.0.5.) If the computer is being used in public, create a new guest user in the system preferences and use this one for the fair. Even if somebody breaks out of the kiosk mode, they can't see your private data or mess anything up.\nIf you want to stay with Chrome, there's an AppleScript on Superuser, to launch Chrome in kiosk mode.\n\nA: It's tricky but I managed to get Chrome in a proper kiosk mode. By editing the Chrome's Info.plist in the package contents you can force it to hide the menu bar in presentation mode (set LSUIPresentationMode to 3). The Continue where I left off setting might help.\nUse parental controls to block or white list websites.\nThere is a Chrome plugin called kioskmodehelper that limits tabs and hides ui elements.\n\nA: try eCrisper from http://ecrisper.com\n\nA: If you setup a new user in System Preferences and setup the parental controls to let it have a simple finder then you can allow only Chrome to be opened and you can set it up so that the only webpage allowed to be accessed is your webpage.\n\nA: Open Script Editor and using the following:\nset strUrl to \"https://example.org\"\ndo shell script \"/Applications/Google\\\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\\\ Chrome --app=\" & strUrl\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"f\" using {command down, control down}\nend tell\n\nThis will open a url in app mode as kiosk isn't available on Mac.\nIt then sends the keys ctrl + cmd + f to enter fullscreen as the older shortcut cmd + shift + f no longer seems to work.\n\nA: None of these answers worked for me as a command line solution.

You can do the following using the Terminal.app or X11.app to consume all remaining free space on your hard drive: \nyes \"Foo Bar Baz\" > ~/bigfile\n\n*Secure-erase the file:\nsrm -m ~/bigfile\nThis in effect simulates the Disk Utility's \"Erase Free Space\" feature without needing admin access. More on this method can be found here.\nFinally, you might want to cover your tracks a bit by deleting your shell history. Assuming that you are using the default Bash shell, you can delete your ~/.bash_history file.\n\nA: The best way to securely delete your data is to get around the protections that are built in to prevent new users from accidentally deleting things needed to make the system run. \nYou can always take it to a local tech shop or Apple Store and get a fresh install or have them reset the admin password. Trained techs with access and permission from you can usually have you a new admin account in less than 10 minutes. This service might be free or very reasonable since the effort needed is low and all shops will have the tools and training for a quick job.\nYou can get around not having an admin account yourself in many ways: \n\n\n*\n\n*Booting the mac in target mode and\nconnecting it with another mac\n\n*booting in single user mode - here's how to erase a user totally\n\n*removing the drive (MacPro or some portables is very easy) \n\n\nIf you delete the file /private/var/db/.AppleSetupDone the setup assistant runs and you can make yourself a new admin user. You can always use that to make another shell account with the same short name once you have deleted the data you want cleared. You can even demote this user to a non-admin account and shut down the mac leaving it empty and clean but not suspiciously wiped.\nIf for social reasons you don't really want to erase everything (or you don't want to accidentally delete something you want to return to the company) you will have to spend more time to separate things and can use the terminal to delete MOST of your files. I like to make a new user and explicitly move and organize everything I feel compelled to hand back to the company in return for the salary they paid me. If the acceptable use policy allows you to use company property for personal use, there shouldn't be an issue with you cleaning up and securing your personal data before relinquishing company property and data.\nBack to technical details, you won't be able to delete the folders in your home folder and some data (like safari history and data that was synchronized) is protected from deleting. I'll show at the end how to see those files and you can then use Safari to reset browsing, or choose to let that data go back with the mac.\nThe four commands used are ls (which shows a file listing), srm (does the shredding and then deletes the files), wc (used to count all the files), pwd (used to show your home folder short name - doesn't do anything else). I named my mac me and the user's short name is short. Your mac will likely be different and your file counts should be higher since this was a test account without much data.\nLast login: Tue May 17 08:29:31 on console\nmac:~ short$ ls -laR|wc -l\n    1339\nmac:~ short$ pwd\n/Users/short\nmac:~ short$ srm -rf *\nsrm: Desktop: Permission denied\nsrm: Documents: Permission denied\nsrm: Downloads: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Application Support: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Assistants: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Audio/MIDI Drivers: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Digidesign: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Audio/Plug-Ins: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Audio/Sounds/Alerts: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Audio/Sounds/Banks: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Audio/Sounds: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Audio: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/ColorPickers: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Compositions: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Favorites: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/FontCollections: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Fonts: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/iMovie/Plug-ins: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/iMovie/Sound Effects: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/iMovie: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Input Methods: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Internet Plug-Ins: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Keyboard Layouts: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Logs: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/PreferencePanes: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Preferences: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Printers: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Screen Savers: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Sounds: Permission denied\nsrm: Library/Voices: Permission denied\nsrm: Library: Permission denied\nsrm: Movies: Permission denied\nsrm: Music: Permission denied\nsrm: Pictures: Permission denied\nsrm: Public: Permission denied\nsrm: Sites: Permission denied\nmac:~ short$ ls -laR|wc -l\n     240\nmac:~ short$ \nIf you want to see all the 240 (or whatever) remaining files, just change ls -laR|wc -l to ls -laR|more and use the space bar to page through the listing of the files and folders that Mac is preventing you from deleting.\n\nA: Since you do not have any administrator privileges, I would recommend a complete wipe-out of your home folder.

Makes sense, since the black glass and plastic would absorb light that the white glass and plastic would let through, likely causing washed-out pictures (or the software adjusting the white balance incorrectly, losing details in lighter and/or darker areas of the image).\n\n*Reports also indicate that the proximity sensor has been modified. Though it's quite possible, if the iPhone uses a capacitive proximity sensor such a change shouldn't be necessary (if it uses an infrared proximity sensor then the same light change issue would require a change). It seems more likely that the change was made for the ambient light sensor which is right next to the proximity sensor, since the ambient light sensor would have light change differences as well.\nOther than the the phones are identical. The new one is no faster, for example.\n\nA: Its supposed to be identical, but 0.2mm thicker \n\nA: There is only a Color Difference between both devices.\n", "Q: Why is the time always wrong on my ipad?

Also, setting to automatic actually results in the time being 15 mins fast instead of 5!\n\nA: I had this problem all the time on my original iPad 3G (with sim but without data plan) running iOS 4. Once I updated the iPad to iOS 5, the problem was fixed.\n\nA: The cause of this is quite an old one, the iOS version originally supplied with the iPad did not support automatically updating the date/time based on location, not even on the 3G version.\nhowever with the introduction of iOS5, it was added for all iPad versions.\n", "Q: Preference Panes can't be opened, says it doesn't work on PowerPC I can't open my network preferences anymore.

I've had a good experiences with the app before, but I won't be using it again.\nThe solution was reinstalling all the affected installations.\n\nA: You might try removing the following cache files (make sure System Preferences isn't running first):\n/Users/<username>/Library/Caches/com.apple.preferencepanes.cache\n/Users/<username>/Library/Caches/com.apple.preferencepanes.searchindexcache\nThen relaunch System Preferences and see if it works okay.\nIf not, can you open up the Console.app application (in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder) and see if anything is printed out to it while you try to launch System Preferences. If so, please post it here.\n\nA: Since your preferences pane is not working - you are limited what you can do. My guess is some old preference pane plug in is calling PPC code or your files are corrupt and look like PPC code to the system.\nCan you get into the accounts pane and make a new admin account for testing by booting in safe mode (shift key held down)? If not, boot in single user mode and delete the one file and run the setup assistant to make a new admin account.\n/sbin/mount -uw /\nrm /private/var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nexit\nFrom there you can see if the system is bad (if the new user is broken similarly) or if it's a user file issue.\n", "Q: Replaced /usr/bin/vim - now I get error messages I tried to upgrade from the default vim install on Mac OS X (vim 7.2) to the one used by MacVim (vim 7.3) by creating a symlink:\nln -s /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim /usr/bin/vim \n\nHowever, now I get the following error messages:\nsk@supernova:~/ > /usr/bin/vim\nE254: Cannot allocate color Red\nE254: Cannot allocate color White\nE254: Cannot allocate color Blue\nE254: Cannot allocate color Red\nE254: Cannot allocate color Grey\nE254: Cannot allocate color Blue\nE254: Cannot allocate color Brown\nE254: Cannot allocate color SeaGreen\nE254: Cannot allocate color SeaGreen\nE254: Cannot allocate color Yellow\nE254: Cannot allocate color Red\nE254: Cannot allocate color Blue\nE254: Cannot allocate color Magenta\nE254: Cannot allocate color DarkCyan\nE254: Cannot allocate color LightMagenta\nE254: Cannot allocate color Grey\nE254: Cannot allocate color Blue\nE254: Cannot allocate color Magenta\nE254: Cannot allocate color Red\nE254: Cannot allocate color Yellow\nE254: Cannot allocate color Black\nE254: Cannot allocate color LightGrey\nE254: Cannot allocate color DarkBlue\nE254: Cannot allocate color Grey\nE254: Cannot allocate color DarkBlue\nE254: Cannot allocate color Grey\nE254: Cannot allocate color DarkBlue\nE254: Cannot allocate color LightGrey\nE254: Cannot allocate color LightBlue\nE254: Cannot allocate color LightMagenta\nE254: Cannot allocate color Blue\nE254: Cannot allocate color LightCyan\nE254: Cannot allocate color LightGrey\nE254: Cannot allocate color Grey90\nE254: Cannot allocate color Grey90\nE254: Cannot allocate color LightRed\nE254: Cannot allocate color DarkGrey\nE254: Cannot allocate color LightGrey\nE254: Cannot allocate color Cyan\nError detected while processing /Users/sk/.vimrc:\nline    1:\nE185: Cannot find color scheme desert\nPress ENTER or type command to continue\n\nAnyone knows how to fix this?

Please use an\n    alias or the mvim shell script instead.\nMacVim comes with a startup shell script, mvim. You can alias it to vim if you'd prefer to use it instead of the system vim. If you want to start vim in the terminal rather than as a gui application, set the alias to mvim -v. Add export EDITOR=vim to your ~/.bash_profile to make sure that any terminal applications are using the now-aliased vim.

I drag-and-drop 2 folders to the places group in finder's sidebar. Now i want to remove it.

This problem happened after i install paragon ntfs driver. It works fine before that.\nDo you have any suggestion to solve this problem?\n\nA: If you're running 10.6.7, dragging to remove from the sidebar changed: Try Cmd-dragging it off. (You've already tried other ways that should have worked and didn't, so I'm not hopeful, but it's worth a try).\nThis solution works for dead favorite folders in 10.7.2.\nI have just fixed a similar problem: An OSX shortcut was pointing to a folder on an HP NAS box which had been deleted so right-click menu was only 1 item. I recreated the folder on the NAS box so I could right click on the Mac to choose from now multiple list 'Remove from sidebar'. Also install free NTFS 3G (linked on Apple site) to access native Windows HDD.\n\nA: It's rather simple. Right click on the folder and click \"Remove from Sidebar\".\n\nEDIT:\nSince you specified that after installing the Paragon NTFS driver the folders became un-removable, i suggest that you disable the driver (from the System Preferences preference pane), restart your Mac, and see if the problem persists.

There isn't much that you can mis-configure unless you jailbreak or start mucking with custom iPhone carrier settings profiles. \niPhone data can break or be misconfigured on the carrier end - even if SMS and voice calls work, there can still be a problem with the data service so you may need to get help from your carrier that is providing your data access. It could also be a software issue and Apple is the best place to get that sorted.\nYour question is basically how do I systematically troubleshoot iPhone data and/or teach myself how to operate my new phone. (no offense, but it's hard to determine from a one sentence question what your level of comfort is with iPhone data terms and how it may break.)\nYou might want to get some help from Apple or the carrier since the internet works as long as you are in working Wifi or your data plan is active on the iPhone. Troubleshooting an issue by back and forth on a discussion board is very hard so it's best to get real-time assistance when you are sitting in front of your computer to update the software if needed.\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/iphone/ has some great getting started tips if you want to work through it yourself.\nSpecifically http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1976 documents the concepts and has an express lane link to get support directly from Apple to narrow down the cause - if 3G is showing in the menu bar it's not some obvious error or switch but something obscure or a carrier issue.\n\nA: If its still not work, go to General > Reset all setting :) It works for me :)\n\nA: To access the internet you need 2 things\n\n\n*\n\n*Active Carrier Data Plan\n\n*The configuration options for that carrier\n\n\nThis is usually uploaded from iTunes when the handset is activated or direct from the carrier.

When I received it, it just doesn't boot: when I pushed the power button, it started for less than a second, and then it automatically shutted down. No chime, no gray screen, no apple logo.\nI opened it, removed one of the memory risers, and kept pressed the diagnostic button when I started it. After doing it, the Mac booted properly. When I reinserted the memory raiser, it just won't boot, but the power led stays on anyway (not shutting down after 2 secs)\nSo, I returned the mac to the owner and it worked by one day. At the next day he had the same trouble. I instructed him to open the case, press the Diag button, and it just started again.\nBut, I have a few questions: is this related to the SMC? As i seen before, letting the computer unplugged for 15 seconds is \"enough\" to reset the SMC, and Mac Pro, from Early 2008 doesn't have a SMC_RST button. What I'm doing when I press the Diagnostic button then? Why it boots when I do that?\nAnd, on the other hand, where can I find a place to interpret what diagnostic leds are telling me.\nThanks guys!\n\nA: From what you've described/tried so far this sounds like it's a RAM related issue.\nKeep track of which RAM is which (label each stick) and experiment with different configurations. The most important thing to try out would be swapping the RAM between the reisers and testing. This should help you ascertain if it's the particular reiser that's at fault or the RAM in that reiser.\nAlso, make sure that the RAM configuration is correct!\nCheck that it is here\nYou may also want to consider the PSU, logic board or CPUs - really though only an Apple tech with access to known good spares can really confirm this.\nRegarding the SMC; When you unplug the machine for more than 15 secs the SMC resets. This is the official way to reset the SMC, hence the lack of a reset button.\nWhen you press the diag button you are doing nothing more than telling the system to light up some extra diag LEDs that are usually not lit during standard boot procedure.\nSee this table for a list of boot/diag LEDs\n\n\n*\n\n*Note the LEDs which will not light unless the diag button is pressed\n\n\nThe system will boot when you press this button because the LEDs are used to check that the system is getting through the various POST (power on self tests) during boot. The LEDs can tell you where and why the boot is failing.\n", "Q: Force iTunes update overnight using cron I was wondering if anyone knew a command line 'command' I could use in a cron to force the iTunes podcast updater to run overnight.

Is there an app for iPad to assist in wireframe design for iPad and iPhone apps?\nI don't mean actual development, just placing standard widgets and the things you usually do with photoshop and associated kits.\n\nA: I've adored Briefs app since running across it a few years back. Nothing comes close to the power and design of this app. It for a long time was probably too powerful (sadly) to ever ship on the iTunes store - but the app has finally launched on the Mac and iOS App stores.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://giveabrief.com\nThe trial Mac version is free as is the iOS app, Briefscase, which run the briefs. Heavy users of the app will want to buy the actual app on the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Blueprint is, in my opinion, the most powerful and most useful, and comes the closest to the promise of Briefs. You get customizable standard controls, it's easy to work with, and most importantly it allows you to set up actions associated with taps, swipes, and rotation. The key is that not only can you work out a complex app interface, but you can then distribute the completed mockup so that other people can play with it using the free Blueprint Viewer app. Super, super handy. \nThe only downside of Blueprint, imo, is that you can't easily create mockups that don't look like a finished app. When working with outside clients or with semi-clueless management, if you present something that looks finished they'll sometimes confuse it with the idea that the app actually is close to being finished. Rougher wireframes are also useful for getting people to focus on the functionality and not how it looks. Still, a great app, the best imo.\nNow to the also-rans:\nInterface HD holds a lot of promise, especially the idea that it can generate some basic Xcode template stuff, but it's very unfinished and doesn't feel very polished. Definitely more promise than followthrough at this point.\nUI Sketcher is designed for rough sketches and can be used for a variety of projects, not just iOS design. Unfortunately that lack of specialization means that it's not actually very good at iOS app mockups. It's so crude, really, that I've never been even slightly satisfied with a result. Maybe if I used a stylus.\niMockups and SketchyPad do have more iOS-focused controls and options, but both fall prey to the UI Sketcher problem of being designed for other things, too. Additionally neither feels sufficiently complete or polished, and everything is harder to do than I'd like. I've used iMockups to create something I actually presented to clients, but felt the need to constantly apologize for the ways the wireframes weren't quite like I intended the app to be. SketchyPad exports to Balsamiq Mockups format, so if you're already a big Balsamiq fan then it might be a good match for you. Both are definitely a step up from the looseness of UI Sketcher (or any other sketching app), but just aren't good enough to actually use for real work.\nI've not used Mocking Pad, but it appears to be nearly identical to iMockups.\n\nA: Briefs and Briefscase might work for you, though the design app is a Mac app. \nThis Google search on ios prototyping on iPad also leads to a number of solutions. \n\nA: Interface HD does this.\nYou could also use Keynote with the excellent Keynotopia templates. \n\nA: WireframeSketcher comes with dedicated stencils for iPad applications. You can use links for simple interactivity. You can even test your prototype on iPad by exporting it to HTML that you can put online via Dropbox.\n\nA: I have found AppCooker to be robust enough to create a mockup with 40 > screens. You can specify your own tappable areas and links between the screens so that those mockup screens come to life.\nHowever I'm really interested in finding alternatives too: AppCooker is great. Don't get me wrong. However I really wish that it had the ability to handle different layers. It requires a lot of cloning and violates the DRY principle: if you want to change an element that's already been copied into 5 different screens, well, you gotta make the change 5 times! Not fun.\n", "Q: Can I make an iTunes playlist comprised solely of songs that lack iTunes genius information? I'm looking to make some lemonade with the \"lemon songs\" that iTunes genius doesn't know how to catalog. One such example currently is an obscure song called \"Polythene Pam\" by some beatles boy band with bad haircuts walking on abbey road.\nI'm aware that for some people, this song has enough matches for genius to make a playlist - I want to exploit my specific library to make a list of all the songs that currently won't make a playlist. Basically is there a way to get at genius results and create a playlist based on that status in a systematic way.\nI'd love to make a smart playlist to exploit this and collect tracks for listening based on the idea that \"if genius can't match this song to others in my library, it's worth a listen\". This song is either too new (or obscure) and genius won't match it on anyone's library no matter how complete, or that song is so different than the others in my library that it stands out as a singleton.\nBasically I'm asking if the Smart Playlist criteria are extensible as I want a Has Genius flag similar to the Has Artwork flag to make a playlist where this is false.\n\nI'd also consider a script or third party software that could periodically make a traditional playlist if I can't automate it with a smart playlist. I am not looking for alternatives to iTunes or genius. Thanks for any ideas you might have!\n\nA: I'll answer that it's not currently possible in hopes that someone can answer this and prove I'm wrong on this.\n\nA: With respect to songs that Genius doesn't understand, I have an overwhelming reliance on beaTunes to create playlists. You can run an analysis to inspect and determine a song's BPM, harmonic key, and color, all of which go into making a more accurate playlist that you define.\n\nA: I'm not sure this is possible because the genius information isn't stored in the iTunes tag system that you can see. Genius actually has its own library that lives right next to your iTunes library. I assume that when you click on the genius button, iTunes checks to see if there is any information in the separate Genius library file and then reports back to you. If you could write a script to read that file then you might be able to do it, but I'm not sure that you can add the flag. Your best bet might be to add a comment when you do see that dialog pop up. Not automatic like you want, but as good as it gets I suppose.\n", "Q: How can I get photographs off the iPhone 4 wirelessly? My new iPhone 4 takes pretty good pictures (for a phone); they're comparable to a lower-end point and shoot. Very convenient.\nBut it's a pain in the butt to get the pictures off the phone. I have to manually plug it into the computer and import somehow (I use Windows Live Photo Gallery). It works, but it's cumbersome.\nIs there a way to get a whole bunch of photographs off the device wirelessly?\n\nA: Eye-Fi has an iPhone app that will perform essentially the same function as the Eye-Fi SD Cards (wirelessly transfer photos to your computer and/or the web).  More information can be found on their website - the catch is that you need to have an Eye-Fi card.  No, it doesn't appear to actually use the card, but they give the app away to card owners.\n\nA: Your iPhone 4 supports iOS 5.0, which can now sync photos wirelessly using Photo Stream.\nFor setup instructions, see http://support.apple.com/kb/PH2605\n\nA: I use PhotoSync to transfer pictures wirelessly from iPhone <-> iPad, and from iOS devices <-> computer. They have little computer utilities on their website to send and catch the photos on a PC or Mac. It handles bulk transfers too. I've had good luck with it so far.\n\nA: DropBox\nThe iPhone app lets you upload photos and videos. You can them sync them from DropBox to your computer when you get home. The only downside is that you have to select each photo in your Camera Roll at a time. Can't do mass uploads from the iPhone.\n\nA: I'd go got DropBox, although it is true that you used to have to upload images one by one the latest version now has bulk upload. When you choose upload it shows you your camera role, you tick which photos you would like to upload, tap go and it uploads them all. \nI have matched this with Hazel on my laptop for it to watch my DropBox folder and any Photos taken on my iPhone that appear in DropBox are then moved to my desktop (or other folder). Although the same action can be performed with out hazel but with a little knowledge of AppleScript. \n", "Q: How to copy video files from OS X to iPad over Wi-Fi? I'd like to copy video files from my computer (OS X) to iPad over WLAN. I'd prefer simply share a folder on OS X and then be able to copy files from that folder when iPad is connected to the same WLAN.\nWhat solutions there exists for this (apps, OS X native share)?\nI have been using Dropbox, but it's too slow as it is round-tripping the file transfer through the internet connection, not the WLAN.\nVideos are MP4 files, so they don't need to be converted.\n\nA: AirSharing is a swiss army knife of turning any iOS device into a wireless file server. There are many others, but this program has three versions that have stood the test of time.\nThe \"copy when connected\" nut will be harder to crack. Unless someone steps up with a ready made solution, you will have to set up SMNP monitoring of your router and trigger a sync when the iPad MAC address is logged as joining the network. You could also poll bonjour locally, but SNMP seems more elegant to me since it will log and push that join without constant monitoring on the mac end.\n\nA: Maybe you don't even need to copy it. you can stream those video directly on your ipad with AirVideo \n", "Q: Is there an alternative dictionary for OS X?

If you use Quicksilver, you can get results from dict.org. Quicksilver is an application launcher, like Spotlight. Note that it is a beta. I haven't had any problems with it, but just be aware that it still is in development. You can type in the word that you want to get a definition from and then select dict.org. It will return the result in a window. I don't know about speech synthesis. I'm not sure if it has speech synthesis or not. Let me know if you do decide to use Quicksilver, as it can be confusing.\n\nA: You can add dictionaries to MacOSX's built-in dictionary app., and have access to its functionalities (cntrl-click).  You will find the installed dictionaries in HD/Library/Dictionaries ... or ...

Tried google and the safari extensions gallery but got nowhere.\nOn top of this, I need a version for mobile safari, but I'm not sure if that is even in the art of the possible.\n\nA: It's not an extension but the Quix bookmark has a handy host command that works with any browser - even mobile safari.\n\nA: The Firefox plugin to use now is DNS Flusher.\nThis Quix Bookmarklet might not work like intended. If you change DNS for a website, and want to know if you see the old or new one, this won't work reliably. It does not get the host info for your computer, but that for the Quix webserver. They may be different. \nWhen you use this bookmarklet, it probably never has visited your website, so the host info it gets is the latest, totally fresh. Your laptop still might use the old cached info. \nIf you change your local hosts file, it will never work. DNS Flusher will work in this case. \nSo if you just want to know the IP of a certain website, no problem, Quix will do its job. If this is about changing DNS info, don't rely on it, use Firefox with DNS Flusher, or use a Terminal (available for iOS and Android as well). \n", "Q: Alternative backup solution for a mac? I know that we can easily use time machine. However, i wonder if there exist any other way to backup the data on my macbook? Since I do a lot of modification to the system and sometimes make it has kernel panic, I would need the backup program to be able to restore everything from a bootable cd (the backup file can be on the hard disk).\nSo, if your solution offers a bootable backup, that's great, but I'm more interested in equivalent functionality of Time Machine where multiple snapshots are available.\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner is a nice application. It is free.\n\nA: I would do this in the reverse way.  Use Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper to make a bootable clone of your working disk, to an external hard disk.  It doesn't need all of your data on it, just the system. Use this copy to do your experimentation with.  If something goes wrong, just make another clone of your system disk.  This keeps the main system disk always in working condition.\n\nA: A combination of SuperDuper for complete bootable backups, and something like Crashplan for offline backup is a good bet.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use SuperDuper to make one or more bootable 'known good' back up disks (these can be on separate partitions of a USB drive for example). This gives you a complete backup of your entire system that you can restore quickly.\n\n*Use Crashplan to back up data files offsite, and to other computers if you have them. This means that even if your computers and disks are damaged or stolen, you still have an offline copy of your data. \n(Note, a true offline copy will take much longer to restore but it is really a backup of last resort, i.e. when all else fails)\n\nA: To create bootable backups which contain everything including system files, you may want to look at Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper.\n\nA: The KISS Principle would suggest restoring your system from the OS X DVD that came with your Mac.\nFor personal files, I think the best backup option is cloud storage, like Dropbox (2GB free, $10/mo for 50GB, $20/mo for 100GB).  It instantly syncs files between all your Internet-connected computers, and you can access them from your mobile device(s), too.  No extra charge for data in/out, so it's a good solution for restoring all personal files from scratch after reinstalling the OS.\nCommon sense also advises against storing important personal files on a computer that you're making significant system-level changes to, especially if you've \"broken\" your computer in that way before.\n", "Q: How can I convert MKV files and burn them to DVD? I have a 5+1 theater system(can use USB or DVD) which doesn't support MKV play. \nHow can I use my Mac to burn the .mkv files into high quality dvds ? \n\nA: You could convert the mkv file first with something like Handbrake or iSkysoft's iMedia Converter, then burn it to DVD. Handbrake and iMedia Converter will give you more options for converting than Toast.\n\nA: Sounds like you need Toast Titanium. Toast will take individual video files and put them into a DVD player compatible format. It doesn't have many options for the DVD's menus, but it's a quick and easy way to burn video files to DVD. It also has many supported formats.\n", "Q: Can I keep my iTunes library on an external drive? My main computer is a MacBook Pro that's running out of space, mostly due to my iTunes library, especially the TV shows.\nI have a few questions all related to solving this problem.\nFirst the most basic: where is the iTunes library directory? What is its filesystem location?\nIf I move my library from the laptop and to an external USB-connected drive, will my music and TV shows still play?\nAnd here's the tricky part: I'd like to keep some of my music on the local drive so I can actually listen to it when I'm out and don't have the external drive with me. Is there a way to do that?\nI don't need to preserve ratings or play counts.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: Where is the iTunes library directory? What is its filesystem location?\nGo to iTunes > Preferences.... Choose the Advanced tab. There you will find the path to your iTunes folder.\nIf I move my library from the laptop and to an external USB-connected drive, will my music and TV shows still play?\nYes, if iTunes knows where to find them. See following question.\nI'd like to keep some of my music on the local drive so I can actually listen to it when I'm out and don't have the external drive with me. Is there a way to do that?\nUnder the Advanced tab in the preferences, make sure Keep iTunes Media folder organized is checked. Choose Change... next to iTunes Media folder location to choose a new location on your external drive. Then click OK.\nNow go to File > Library > Organize Library, select Consolidate files and click OK. iTunes will now copy your files to your external hard drive. The files on your internal drive will be retained.\nGo to your original iTunes Media folder on your internal drive and drag it to the Trash. Do not empty the trash before making sure that you can quit and relaunch iTunes and play songs without any trouble.\nNow move any music files you want to be on your internal drive to a folder on your internal drive. When you move these files, iTunes will not be able to find them, as iTunes will look for them in the folder on your external drive. This will result in dead listings with exclamation marks if you try to play them. See this answer to remove dead listings: Verify that entries in iTunes are actually on disk.\nNow go to iTunes > Preferences... and to the Advanced tab again. Uncheck Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library. Choose File > Add to library... and select the media files that you moved to your internal drive.\nCheers.\nFor the record, it is also possible to have more than one iTunes library and choose which one to load when starting iTunes. The above solution allows you to have one library with files at different locations.\n\nA: Where is the iTunes library directory?\nDefault location:\n\n/Users/username/Music/iTunes\n\nYou can also find it out by Right click on any song in your music library and selecting the \"Get Info\" option.\nYes. You can copy it to an external HDD and define the new location in iTunes preferences.\n\nPreferences > Advanced > iTunes Media folder location\n\nAFAIK it is not possible to have multiple libraries.\n", "Q: What is the optimal setting for importing CDs? When you use iTunes to import a CD you have several options -- \"AAC Encoder,\" \"AIFF Encoder,\" etc.\nI'd like to have the best possible sound quality and avoid any sort of lossy compression.\nWhich setting, if any, allows me to do that?\nI noticed the \"Apple Lossless\" option, but it sounds a little proprietary. I'm suspicious. So I guess my goal is the above, but using a cross-platform standard file format if possible.\n\nA: I would recommend using the AAC MPEG4 set at 320KBS. We have done blind tests between this & uncompressed in a hi-fi shop, and no one has been able to tell the difference. AAC is a great codec & 10 years newer than MP3. The other option (if you have the room) is to leave them uncompressed.\n\nA: Apple lossless is the way to go in iTunes. For the best possible quality. AAC is darn near good enough for almost everyone and saves space so be sure to test both before doing a ton of encoding.\nI like to be able to update iTunes whenever a new version arrives and depend on easy syncing across computers (home sharing and streaming) as well as across devices so I try not to add plug ins or non-supported formats unless the need is great.\nIf you are worried about the proprietary nature of Apple Lossless instead of FLAC (the best free lossless alternative), it is very simple to batch re-encode the entire library to AAC / MP3 or AIFF/WAV or burn to a CD at full resolution.\nThe benefit of stock Apple Lossless format is about 50% compression rate with no loss of data or sound quality.\nI would guess most people that don't use an external DAC and premium headphones ($400 to $1500) with audiophile amplifiers will rarely need AAC bitrates more than 240kbps for most recordings. Going higher is generally a waste of space for little to no discernible impact on listening enjoyment.\nBasically, it's only worth encoding higher if the recording is precious and archival in nature or you really do hear a difference for that one piece that makes it worth re-encoding at a lossless level.\nYou can always start with Apple Lossless and convert later to FLAC/AIFF or downsample if you feel constrained by Apple's software.\n\nA: FLAC is a free lossless audio codec. It's pretty much the cross-platform standard. AIFF and WAV are both uncompressed, but they take up more disk space. A three minute AIFF is about 30MB. A three minute FLAC file will be about 18MB.\nThe only downside to encoding and listening to your music with FLAC is that it requires jumping through a few hoops on the Mac. As you noticed, iTunes supports its own lossless codec. You'll have to do your encoding outside of iTunes. Here is a list of Mac-compatible FLAC encoders. Here is an article on how to play FLAC files in iTunes.\nAlso, this is an interesting and relevant discussion on another stackexchange site about the perceived differences (or lack thereof) between different audio codecs and compression rates.\n\nA: In an Apple only enviroment moving away form 'standard' file formats it's a BAD strategy in my opinion. \nFlac, Ogg and such are nice, but when/if you'll have to move to different personal computers, operating systems, devices (your iPhone, or Android or plain cellphone) you'll regret going with those.\nSo personally I do VBR mp3 at the highest quality possible...\n", "Q: Tabs to spaces in BBEdit How can I configure BBEdit to insert 4 spaces (or at least spaces up to the next column which is a multiple of 4)? I've checked \"Auto-expand tabs\" in the preferences, but it doesn't seem to be doing that.\n\nA: This has stymied me for quite some time, and today I found the way to enable this for open documents. At the very top of the Document in BBEdit in the left hand corner, you will find the path of the file you are currently editing immediately preceded by a small gear icon. Click the gear icon and place a check in the box next to \"Auto-expand Tabs\".\n\nA: The Auto-expand tabs preference must also be set for the Language mapping setting. Also, the setting won't be applied until you create or open a new document.\nSee Languages in BBEdit.\n", "Q: Frequent crashing and unresponsive OS X About six months ago, my MacBookPro's (summer '09) HDD died. A solid, irrecoverable failure - flashing folder question mark, utterly invisible to Disk Utility, Disk Warrior, being housed in an external housing from different machines, the Genius Bar wonder disc (you knew they have one, right?), everything. \nSo after testing my backup strategy to its limits, I bought a new drive (Seagate Momentus XT 500Gb). This drive is updated with the latest firmware SD25 and I'm generally happy, the hybrid drive is everything you'd expect: nippy and reasonably huge. On a good day, my cold boot from off to active is less than a minute (much less). \nBut. And it's a huge but (and I have to assume it is something related to the drive): \nIt is crashing on me frequently: daily, sometimes multiple times daily, spinning beach balls, unresponsive when the Mac's lid is opened, failing when the screen saver kicks in; you name it, sometimes it could just be my typing something quickly into the Firebox toolbar. \nFortunately turning it off and restarting has, up to now, always worked, but many of the apps don't like it and many apps complain, fail and need reinstalling and I'm getting to the end of my patience. \nI'm pondering on just reinstalling Snow Leopard (or waiting for Lion or whatever's next) and seeing if that solves it, but I've no real confidence in that as a solution. \nA little background: I'm a professional Windows developer and a Mac user for a number of years, so I'm comfortable with the idea of logging, tracing, debugging and so on, but I'm a little lacking in the deep knowledge of where to look for clues on the Mac. \nSo I'm looking to the hivemind: if I'm not to just backup everything up and do a clean install, what should I try before that? Or should I just try that? Why should I believe that would work? \n\nA: Interesting.  I have a ST9500420AS, is it the same drive?  Mine is loud but I don't have any issues with it.\nDoes anything show up in the console during/after this occurs?  /Applications/Utilities/Console.app\nAlso, if you can make the problem re-produceable, you could try fseventerhttp://www.fernlightning.com/doku.php?id=software:fseventer:start, or even a simple command into the terminal (lsof > ~/Desktop/open_files.txt) to figure out what might be going on.\nIt almost sounds like it might, might be a hardware problem rather than software, but we may as well rule out the latter first.\n", "Q: Is there a reliable, automatic subtitle downloader for Mac OS X? On Ubuntu I use SMPlayer or SubDownloader, which both reliably retrieve subtitles from opensubtitles.org. SMplayer even does this automatically for the file you are currently viewing.\nSo far I've tried SolEol, FileBot, SubDownloader (which is a bit behind on versions for Mac OS; seems like the API URL for opensubtitles.org changed) and Undertext. None of them work reliably, some of them not at all.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I was searching for this same answer, and found a great solution. \nSubliminal will allow you to set up a cron job, (or manually enter from CLI) whole directory trees, and download subtitles. You can also set it up as a post processor for SABNzbd or SickBeard or CouchPotato.\nIt's working great for me.\n\nA: I found Subtitles recently. It looks nice and clean and seems to work quite well (I had lots of problems with Unicode support in subliminal).\n\nA: I developed a free app to download subtitles on the Mac.\n\nYou can download it from here.\nIt downloads from OpenSubtitles.\nIt is not a signed application (I'm not willing to pay Apple two times, as I develop for iPhone and not for Mac), so you have to allow it to run through System Preferences → Security & Privacy.\n\nA: I, too, have made a free utility for this purpose.\nYou can grab it fresh here: Sublime.\n\nA: Subsmarine from cocoawithchurros provides a commercial solution.\n\nA: I am using SPlayerX. It is a media player can auto download subtitles depending on the video you playing.\n\nA: I use XBMC and it works like a charm!\n\nA: I recommend Subtitles Wizard Plus for this use case.\n\nA: I wrote a Python Script myself to download Subtitles.

I am about to take a long flight and would like to take my 13\" Macbook Air (late 2010 model) to watch some movies. I don't have a DVD drive, so I will be ripping DVDs (that I own), encoding them, and transferring the video files to the Macbook Air. I would like the battery to last as long as possible. What encoding methods should I use so that the Macbook Air uses the least amount of battery?\n(I will be using Mac the Ripper to rip the DVDs and Handbrake to encode the video files)\nUpdate: According to some notes by a Stanford student in 2009 about video encoding: \n\nH.264 better video quality but more processor intensive, than MPEG-4 (easier for older or legacy machines). MacBook Air couldn't keep up! Video takes full advantage of processor for encoding and decoding. MPEG-4 worked fine on the original MacBook Air. \n\nNot sure, but it makes it sound as if H.264 makes the Macbook Air work harder, thus draining the battery more quickly.\n\nA: You can measure the best for yourself by trying a few settings.\nIn general, you want the encoding to play without stretching or pixel doubling (and no pixel shrinking) so make sure to pick something that fits your screen naturally. H.264 is by far the best since the GPU does the decoding and it's more power efficient than the CPU for processing video. The data rate can be too high - but most people choose a rate to make the movie small so that's not usually an issue.\nFire up activity monitor from the Applications/Utilities folder and see the CPU usage graph while you are playing various movies. The terminal command pmset -g pslog is also nice to have running while you are testing so you can see the battery estimates over time. If there are no spikes in CPU use the estimate will move down linearly - so you could measure the same 10 minutes or so of a movie and convince yourself you have a good compromise.\nThe default handbrake settings are probably just fine, so start there and play as needed.\n\nA: H.264\nIt is Apple's preferred codec. Though on it's site it doesn't say anything about battery life. The closest article that I can think of that explains how h.264 is better than another codec for battery life is Chris Foresman's post about flash's effect on the MacBook Air and that generally had to do with displaying ads. However I know that on my MacBook my fans don't kick on when I watch h.264/html5 on youtube verses watching it in flash which kicks my fans on. But I doubt you will be converting the video to flash.\n\nHaving Flash installed can cut battery runtime considerably — as much as 33 percent in our testing\n\n", "Q: Option-Delete deletes word with white space in front So this has been driving me crazy for a while now: when you have a lot of blank space before a word, you go to the beginning of the line and push option-delete, it will delete not only the blank space, but also the next word. All editors in Windows and Linux will only delete the blank space. Is there a setting for this? This is an absolute must-have for me when, for example, trying to format code in XCode. As an example:\nThis is line 1 (caret->) |             this should not get deleted\n\nPushing option-delete, I expect this:\nThis is line 1 (caret->) |this should not get deleted\n\nBut instead, I get this:\nThis is line 1 (caret->) |should not get deleted\n\nThis is particularly nasty when you copy-paste code from somewhere, and get something like this:\nUIImageView *imgView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:\n                                              CGRectMake(0,0,100,100)];\n\n....and you want to quickly consolidate into one line.  Does anyone have a fix for this?\n\nA: I select the entire space and word as per your example. Then keeping Shift and Option pressed, I use the left arrow to select the empty space. Works like a charm and is only one extra keypress.\n", "Q: Do I need drivers to use a full-sized Apple keyboard with my MacBook Pro? I have a 2009 MacBook Pro and just purchased a wired Apple Keyboard with numeric keypad. I really wanted dedicated navigation keys, and it is working great in Eclipse after a bit of configuration.

You won't have any restrictions on the apps you install other than your existing restrictions of disk space, ram or your graphics processor. \nI would suggest upgrading your machine to 4GB of ram as both Snow Leopard and windows 7 like at least 4GB of ram. \n\nA: Although Microsoft say that 2GB RAM is sufficient for running Windows 7, you'll feel a need to upgrade for the more memory intensive software.  Likewise, many people have successfully ran Snow Leopard with machine specs similar to yours, some even using VMWare/Parrellels (and thus sharing resources, not that I recommend this for low specs).  But I guess the same goes in that you'll feel the struggle when you find you need to run a few 'heavier' applications at once.\nRegarding any apps/software that may not work after the upgrade, then your best bet is to check the minimal system requirements for each application that you may use/want to use.  The last thing you want is to upgrade and then find that your machine doesn't meet the required specs for software crucial to your work, studies or even leisure.\n\nA: A lot of my friends own this MacBook (i'm in a school) and I've helped them install Windows on it. So far, no problems have occurred, and they seem pretty happy about it. 2GB of RAM should be enough for normal uses (my friends play CPU-intensive games, and have no problems too), but if you need to run memory-intensive applications, I recommend that you upgrade your RAM.\nThere should be no problems with Windows interfering with Mac OS X (separate partitions, and only read access for HFS+ partitions in Windows). However, if you install 64-bit Windows, some applications may not support it. You can still run 32-bit applications though. Remember to follow the Boot Camp Install Guide found here, and make a backup in case you do something wrong.\n\nA: Snow Leopard will run just fine on that hardware. As far as windows 7 - you will want to watch closely if you care to have the \"Aero\" experience. \nW7 is more ram hungry than SL - so you might upgrade if you like more speed and more apps open at one time or if Windows 7 feels slow but you certainly meet the minimum specs to install and try it first.\nYour windows and associated software will need to support the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M - so just check the product pages to see if your hardware meets their specifications. Nvidia markets that card as 9400G on PC hardware so you might not see 9400M if the vendor doesn't realize it's just the mac installation of the G chip.\nMost games and major software will run well or have a page listing in much detail which graphics cards are needed for better frame rates or advanced features such as a CAD or rendering software that is highly optimized.\n\nA: You should try virtualization as well. There is vmware, parallels both pay solutions and  virtualbox which is free. Virtualization might not be a good option because of your ram limitations. You might have one of the early gen macbooks that could not address over 2-3 gig of ram. \n", "Q: Submitting apps to the iOS app store I'm going to collaborare with several customers to develop iOS apps, and I was wondering how should I deal with app store subscriptions ?\nShould I subscribe by myself and pay 99$ per year (and have the apps with my development username) or should I ask to each of my customer to subscribe ?\nAlso, how many apps can I submit per year ? Is there a limit ?\nthanks\n\nA: There's no limit to the number of apps you can submit.\nI've found that it's better to have your clients sign up for their own developer accounts and to add you as an administrator of the account. That allows you to create certificates, etc., but the app shows up under their name.\nIt also means that they can easily do whatever they want with it down the road. You can't transfer an app from one company to another, but you can effectively hand over your entire developer account, allowing them to sell the app to someone else if desired. If you keep it under your company/name then it'll always be there.\nLastly, it allows them to view their own iTunes Connect sales/download information without having access to your other clients. Without it you'll have to provide portions of the reports yourself, or summarize for them, or whatever. Probably seems reasonable now but two years from now, say, there's a good chance you'd rather be out of the loop, especially if the app isn't selling well but they still need to know.\n\nA: I think the answer to this lies in the legal claims that your customers have in your work. If they own the intellectual property, then signing yourself up and taking in all the sales (I'm assuming these apps will be paid, not free) may make for a bad situation.\nNot knowing all the details, and I suspect also you may not be able to elaborate, this is as much as I could really comment on.\n", "Q: Using DisplayPort hubs, splitting the massive meta-screen I've recently started a programming company with my girlfriend and we're doing a lot of pair programming. I'm looking into the various solutions for driving multiple external monitors from a MacBook Pro. It looks like the solutions are to either find a DisplayPort 2.0 monitor and daisy-chain them (too expensive / rare), use a USB video card (lol, lag), or use a DisplayPort hub.\nThe problem with DisplayPort hubs like this one are that they apparently show up to the computer as one big display, X times as wide as each of the individuals. My question to you, AskDifferenters, is if there is a way to make the system believe that they are individual monitors, either in hardware or in software.\nThanks!\n\nA: The Matrox TripleHead2Go includes their Powerdesk driver that can apparently send windows and the dock to specific displays. I'm not sure how far the illusion goes that they are indeed separate displays instead of the one logical display they represent.\nHave you actually tried USB monitors? If used for coding and/or docs, I don't think their theoretical lack in bandwidth creates much of a practical problem. If you plan on gaming or watching videos on them, that's another matter. I wouldn't rule them out for ordinary work-type jobs without checking them out myself first.\n", "Q: iPhone Tweak to override http links to other Apps Is there already an app or would it be possible to have an app which:\nCatches http:// links that are clicked from any application and can redirect them to other apps other than safari.\nFor example a link to twitter could be set to goto Tweetbot, so  http://twitter.com/adamdempsey would be clicked but it would actually load tweetbot://user_profile/adamdempsey\nI know obviously this would be for jailbroken phones only, just asking if it could happen?\n\nA: There's a JailBreak tweak called Browser Changer, and it does almost exactly what you want. It's in the standard repositories in Cydia, and it's free. I've used it to make all links automatically open with Dolphin Browser. It works quite well, but it can only make one app open all http links, so other than that, there isn't anything that does exactly what you want.\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, it is not possible to write an application that listens to http://anything. The fact that http://maps.google.com addresses shell out to the Maps application is a special case likely built explicitly into MobileSafari.\nAll other iOS applications may register on a special URL. For example, many Twitter clients register for the twitter:// protocol and usually have references like twitter://messages, twitter://replies, etc.\nUnfortunately I don't know of a specific app to support customizing this in the Jailbreaking community.\n\nA: There is now a tweak called LinkOpener by HASHBANG Productions on the BigBoss repo which does exactly this with Facebook, Twitter and eBay links.\nThey are working on a new version with setting which will allow you to choose if you have multiple applications, eg TweetBot and Twitterific etc.\n", "Q: Prevent shutting down iPhone when passcode lock is on If my iPhone is stolen and the thief shut the phone down, I wouldn't be able to locate it anymore.\nIs it possible to disable the possibility to shut down the phone when a passcode lock is set up?\n\nA: Yes, but you have to be jailbreak and go through Cydia for this.\nThe add-on is called iGotYa.\n\n\n*\n\n*enables \"Prevent OFF\"\n\n*acquires location of a stolen device (sends via email of choice, or via sms)\n\n*takes a picture of the person which holds your device if they enter the wrong passcode\n\n\nA: It's worth noting that I'm fairly sure that a long press (15+ seconds) of the power button initiates a hardware reset, which is completely impossible to block with software. \nThink about what would happen if you had no hard-reset option, and the software than handles turning off your phone crashed. You would never be able to restart it again, and it would be effectively bricked until the battery wore down, and it shut off due to lack of power.\nBasically, for any complex electronics device, it certainly will crash, so there has to be a way to override any software power controls. Every computer electronics device I have ever seen has had some mode which you can use to reset it, for just this reason.\n\nA: This is currently exactly how the iPhone is designed. I agree with your issue.\nMy answer was about to be: \"Perhaps if you Jailbroke your iPhone you could install some modification software that would prevent someone from shutting it down when locked\". However, there's naturally yet another level of indirection.\nOne of the things that you will never be able to prevent, is the device being put into DFU mode. A phone is put into DFU mode by holding down both the Sleep and Home buttons for 10 seconds, then let go of only the Sleep button (continue holding the Home button) until the phone wakes with it's \"connect to iTunes\" notice.\nDFU mode is one of the few pure hardware modes. After putting a phone into DFU mode, it cannot be used until restored against an instance of iTunes. Which also means that the data will invariably be lost because it will be wiped upon restore of new phone setup.\nA few notes:\nNo computer is completely secure when physical access is allowed by an unauthorized user. No amount of BIOS passwords, login passwords, or anything extended authentication will be unable to be overcome. Physical access is total access.\nWhat I'm saying is that you should spend less of your time attempting to thwart theft, and instead set up a mechanism for safeguarding your data.\nSync regularly, configure your iPhone to wipe itself after 10 failed pin attempts, set up Find My iPhone so you can issue a Remote Wipe command.\nNote that I'm not saying not to not bother mitigating theft. Getting a K-Lock if you're in a display position, a secure case so it's harder to lift from your pockets (or don't put it in your pants pocket) are all worthwhile steps to take.\n\nA: Perhaps consider Cylay? Requires jailbreak, but can hinder shutdown.\n", "Q: Switch Cmd and Control keys for one app only I use a mac at work and a home. However, at work I need to log into a Windows virtual machine (using either CoRD or MS RDC) several times each day to do some work. Switching between using control instead of command for common keyboard shortcuts is driving me mad, so I was hoping there was a way to switch these keys only when I am in Windows. That way I wouldn't have to fight my muscle memory for tasks such as cut, copy and paste. (Permanently switching my mac to use a Windows layout is not a solution btw. I like my mac keyboard layout)\nI have looked at Ukulele, but it doesn't allow rearranging of modifier keys.\n\nA: It's a common issue and it looks like it was answered on superuser side of this web site - Assuming you are happy with a solution for Remote Desktop, this looks to be a duplicate of https://superuser.com/q/263647/76395\nHave you had a chance to see if that program will help remap the keys as desired?\n\nA: Ultimately you may simply need to train your fingers to switch between Command and Control. This is what I did years ago, since I go back and forth between Mac and Windows all day long. It still frustrates me on occasion, but I have grown used to it.\nHowever, would there be a way to use AppleScript to create a script for toggling System Preferences: Keyboard: Modifier Keys... on and off for when you go into your VNC or Remote Desktop session?\n\nParenthetically, Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop for Macintosh tries to handle this for you and gives you a few options for customizing keys and mouse behavior--though not what you are asking for specifically in this case.\n\n", "Q: why is my snow leopard mac speaking 'welcome to rmit' when i join a network? I did a class at a university - RMIT. \nTheir network required a complex set up, which their tech support did for me.\nI also set up Locomatic to switch locations when I went home and used my home network.\nEvery now and then, when I join my home network, my laptop says in a synthesised voice 'welcome to rmit'\nLocomatic is now disabled, and I have deleted all the RMIT network and location details. \nI've called rmit tech support but they claim to have no idea whats going on.\nI've given up on RMIT tech support being part of a solution.\nAny suggestions where I could look to solve this?\nI have growl installed, the only other non apple sys prefs are mysql, flip4mac and Tex distribution. It could be a script using the say command, but as the voice is quiet and happens unexpectedly, I've never managed to listed to it carefully enough to confirm it is one of the apple voices and not an audio file. \n\nA: Something is running a process when you connect to your home network. You said \"Locomatic is now disabled\" - have you actually uninstalled it?  Probably worth a try.  Here's the Manual.\nYou might also lay a trap for say by temporarily renaming /usr/bin/say to sayx, writing a wrapper script in /usr/bin called say that calls sayx and passes its arguments to it, but which doesn't exit when sayx returns.  The next time your system speaks up, you can look at the process list with ps -f or Activity Monitor and trace through the Parent Process IDs to find out who launched what, leading to the announcement.  In fact, I'd probably do this first to make sure I know about everything that might need cleaning up.\n\nA: Do you have Growl installed? Any other non-Apple System Preferences? It would help to know if there is anything different about your setup when you get the \"voice from the past\".\n", "Q: How to use (sync) Apple Address Book with multiple accounts from Google? My impression is that by adding an \"Exchange 2007\" account to the Address-book does not work with Google Mail.\nI tried to configure Google by using the iPhone method: exchange server on m.google.com but it doesn't seam to work.\nI need to sync contact from 2 different gmail accounts (to be able to see and edit them as separated addressbooks)\nAny ideas?\n\nA: There are third party, paid, services available to sync multiple Gmail, Address Book and Exchange accounts. I can't speak to the effectiveness of any of them. I signed up for Soocial and then decided I didn't care if the two gmail accounts I use had out-of-sync address books -- I just sync one with my Address Book and iPhone now using the built-in sync manager in OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Soocial\n\n*Sync'Em\n\nA: You cannot use the built in functionality since it only allows one account and password. Apple's Mac Address book does allow three formats of contact exchange with a remote server and no hard limit on how many accounts may be added:\n\n\n*\n\n*Exchange 2007 - usually a paid server license is needed for this\n\n*CardDAV - an open and free standard\n\n*LDAP - another open and free standard\n\n\nSadly, none of these is supported per Google's discussion boards. Although many people have asked, I don't see any indication if or when they might allow or sell access to your data using one of these protocols. You will be good to go if this happens.\nUntil google enables one of these or Apple changes the Address Book, there is a workaround.\nIt's not nice, but you could learn and set up (or pay for) a server somewhere that will talk to your mac using one of these three standards and talk to google using their API. Kludges like this are sometimes fragile and slower than a direct sync but if your need is urgent enough, it might be worth the hassle.\n\nA: Basically syncing to MS Exchange involves two different protocols. The full blown Exchange RPC protocol is what desktop clients use while mobile clients use the newer ActiveSync protocol.\nThe problem is that only iOS devices support ActiveSync, not Mail.app nor Address Book and Gmail does not support Exchange RPC protocol. So your only option is to use Google Sync for contacts, IMAP for e-mail and CalDav for iCal syncing.\nEDIT: to sync multiple Gmails, first set up one Gmail as shown below, and then use some third party syncing application to sync the other Gmail account. E.g Soocial allows to sync 1 Gmail for free.\nFirst open Address Book and go to Preferences. There click the Accounts button and select your (probably only) account there. Next, enable Google sync:\n\nAnd enter your Gmail credentials:\n\nAfter this your Address Book should start syncing to Gmail. It probably greets you with several collisions if you had contacts in both places, which you have to resolve manually.\n", "Q: How to monitor file access for an OS X application? I am looking for the OS X corespondent of FileMon, that was later included in ProcessMon.\nBTW, it is essential to be able to filter by process.\n\nA: Instruments—a part of the Apple Xcode development suite—can monitor all file access and writes. Open it from /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app, select your application or process, and press Start. You have extensive filter options available in the menus.\nOlder versions of Xcode are storing the App at /Developer/Applications/Instruments.app\n\nA: There is the command opensnoop. Run without arguments, it may overwhelm you with output, but it can be run with arguments -n name to limit output to processes named name.\n\nA: \nlsof\n\ncommand on the Terminal.app can do that for you?\nuse the man lsof to catch up with it's use.\nCheers\n\nA: The faster way is:\n$ lsof [path_to_file]\n\nThis solution doesn't require the root password and gives you back the following, clear, result:\nCOMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF     NODE NAME\nFinder     497  JR7   21r   REG    1,2   246223 33241712 image.jpg\nQuickLook 1007  JR7  txt    REG    1,2   246223 33241712 image.jpg\n\n\nA: Also available are iosnoop and iotop depending on your specific needs. These terminal commands can be piped through grep to watch for filesystem events from a specific process or against a specific file.\n\nA: No one has mentioned Activity Monitor, found in the /Applications/Utilities folder.\nClick on the Process Name in the list, then hit the \"Inspect\" button on the toolbar.\nThere are three tabs in the resulting window: Memory, Statistics, Open Files and Ports. The Open Files and Ports tab will show all the open files being used by the process.\n\nA: Launchd is the main system level tool for monitoring files (and a folder is a special file) since it's always running. Hazel is one program that helps put a pretty GUI around launchd WatchPaths. Look here for lots of tips on launchd as well as hundreds of tutorials, a good wikipedia article and the Apple dev docs.\nfseventsd will log some changes - so you might use FSeventer or access those files if launchd isn't your cup of tea.\nfs_usage and lsof are process aware command line tool to tap into the IO subsystem as it's running. The fs_usage buffer can get overloaded so if you want something more guaranteed and less of a \"take a quick peek\" it's less dependable for total correct results as the other commands.\n\nA: There's a graphical interface to lsof type information. It's donationware from HAMSoft and it's called What's Keeping Me. Designed to answer that \"Why can't I delete this from my trash?\" question that comes up every so often on OS X, it also happens to be a handy way to watch for open I/O handles on running processes if you're just curious about what's going on. It allows you some simple search and filtering.\n", "Q: How do I run terminal in sudo mode? I was trying to install npm, and I got\nnpm ERR!

Therefore, type: sudo su.\n[william@NCC-1701 ~]$ sudo su\nPassword:\n[root@NCC-1701 /Users/william]$ \n\nIf you haven't used root before, you should be made fully aware that one wrong character typed as root will delete your entire operating system, including your photos, emails and financial documents. Be extremely careful and always triple-read what you type before hitting enter. Otherwise, good luck!\n\nA: sudo -s is far easier than enabling the root user since it just starts up a shell with root permissions as a one step, on demand action. Not only is it fast, but it doesn't need to be reconfigured when you don't need the root user and doesn't expose the server to any more risk or vulnerability that adding a root user would entail.\nOf course for npm you could just follow the directions and type:\nsudo -H npm \"install\" \".\" \"--force\" \"--global\"\n\nThat still makes the npm command \"root\" and skips the log out step to get back out of root.\n\nA: I ran the same issue trying to install ionic, you only need to run the same command with sudo:\nsudo npm install -g ionic cordova\n\nThe system will request the current user’s password.

However, I wrote a post about this topic, if anyone finds it useful. Please note I managed to locate the download on cnet, see my note at the bottom of the blog post.\n\nA: Windows does not support this keyboard layout without a lot of custom modification. You can install a keyboard driver for Windows from the Mac Install Disk (the one that came with the machine). But this does not include the keyboard layout.\n\nA: I have a French keyboard and had to create the proper keyboard layout \"from scratch\" (well I took the nearest working keyboard layout and modified it to behave like it does under Mac OS X, including dead keys and option/shift+option combos). To that end I used the official keyboard layout creator from Microsoft.\n\nA: Try changing the keyboard language from Control Panel on Windows 7 to match that of your actual keyboard, different languages map their keyboards differently. Eg. English keyboard starts QWERTY, German keyboards starts QWERTXZ\n\nA: If it helps anyone visiting this thread 6 years on, as I have: On Windows 10, I had to go to Settings > Advanced Keyboard settings and choose my keyboard again from the \"Override for default input\" settings - then my keyboard worked as expected.\n", "Q: Pages Equation Editor - Inserting Equations - Blank Spaces? I am trying to place Mathematical equations in Pages and it appears it doesn't have this feature (why not apple? glare), however looking online I was advised to use Equation Editor which I seem to have installed.\nOnline people are reporting this works fine, but in my document when I copy and paste across I just end up with blank spaces. Does anyone know why?\nThanks for your time,\nMBP - 10.6.7\nPages - '09 4.04\n\n\nA: Well, I'm not sure if Equation Editor would work with Pages since it is a Microsoft product and comes with the Office. I might be mistaken but this would seems to be a case of apples and bananas. \nOn the other hand if you have LaTeX installed in your system and are familiar with it then you might try to use a small and free utility called LaTexit. You can check this explanation to get you started on using equations in Pages.\nAn Addition:\nAn alternative way to insert equations into Pages would be to use Grapher utility which is included in the standard OSX install. Check in your Applications > Utilities to find it. Not only this utility allows you to produce graphs but it also allows you to copy the equation in variety forms (PDF,TIFF, ... LaTeX equation) into your document. The program has quite good \"Equation Palette\" where you could in principle create your equations to be pasted somewhere else.\n", "Q: Macbook pro trackpad stops working after plugging in USB mouse in Windows 7 under bootcamp We have a new Macbook Pro which we've installed Windows 7 under boot camp.

When I unplug the USB mouse the track pad still doesn't work.\nHas anyone else experienced the behaviour? Is there a solution to it?\n\nA: During boot camp assistant partitioning, it prompted you to create  windows support folder. After installing windows you should have run setup from this folder. If you run it again and reboot, you should have your track-pad driver restored. When you run it again, select repair.\n", "Q: HDCP Error on MacBook Pro with no External Display I occasionally receive the infamous HDCP error (as seen below).\n\nHowever, I don't have an external display connected. It happens on the MacBook's built in display. This happens MID VIEWING. It starts playing fine, then randomly I get this error. I can always restart it, but it's become a pain. Any ideas?\n\nA: What programs are you running?  This can happen if, for instance, a VNC session is started, or one of the many airplay applications (servers) runs, or if a screen capture utility runs.  They create a third virtual monitor which isn't HDPC compliant, and if they happen to do it while you're watching your movie, you'll receive this error.\nCheck through your services and background apps to see what is running that might need or use display access.  If you don't notice anything, see if you can disable all your background apps and test it again.

To\n  connect a DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, or\n  VGA display, just use an existing\n  adapter.\n\n\nA: Simply plug in one DisplayPort/Thunderbolt display or video adapter per port. That gets you two screens in addition to the iMac screen. \nThere is a little confusion over multiple displays on one thunderbolt chain and real experience is limited since no thunderbolt monitors are shipping widely as of mid-August 2011. \n\nIf you care about the details or difference between thunderbolt or displayport, How the devices chain is a little different. \nIn this configuration (video out, one display per port) all Mac accessories that physically fit will work. I haven't heard of any third party devices that break when used with Thunderbolt instead of DisplayPort.\nThe only limitations where an older DisplayPort-only device will fail to work with Thunderbolt is the video-in mirroring feature. It looks like someone that has a new Thunderbolt MacBook Pro can send the video from the portable to display instead of the iMac (the iMac becomes a monitor with the Mac running behind the scenes - not displaying on the iMac). It looks like an older DisplayPort portable such as an Air or older DisplayPort out Macs won't be able to send video to the new Thunderbolt iMacs like they could to the older DisplayPort iMacs.\nI personally hope a firmware update on either or both ends might make this work later, but today, this is simply wishful thinking.\n", "Q: How to convert a CorelDraw file to Adobe Illustrator CS5?

Any tips?\n\nA: Either the software isn't seeing the proximity sensor or your hardware needs a repair.\nI have had good luck testing the phone immediately after a normal reboot (slide to power off and letting it shut down) Then place the phone flat on the table, press sleep/wake to power it on and once it starts - just call 611 or another free call before starting any apps. Place your whole hand over the top half of the glass and play with the sensor that is near the receiver / front camera to see that the screen goes on and off as designed.\nRestoring the phone (and sometimes setting up as new) is needed to reset the software when it fails. Calling or going to an apple store for assistance or repair is the next step once you've decided it's not fixable from simple software.\n\nA: I was having the same issue and it got resolved when I removed the screen protector.\n\nA: I tried all the above and nothing seems to help so I will probably be making a trip to the apple store for help.\n\nA: I had this problem. I have an iPhone 4 and an otter box case. The screen was not turning off when I was on a call. If I covered up the top portion of the phone, it still would not turn off. I then took the phone out of the case; against my ear the screen would turn off as ell as when I covered up the sensor. I then put it in a lifeproof case; it turns off against my ear and with my hand covering the sensor. \nMy conclusion is that the otter box is somehow covering the sensor (although it has not always done this). I would recommend experimenting with/without a case and other cases. \n\nA: Was facing the same problem as soon as i put a tempered glass screen on it. Solved the issue after the removal.\n", "Q: Is there any way to schedule software update? I have software updates set to check weekly, but it seems to happen at random times during the day. I'd really like to have it run at a specific day and time - say 4:30 on Friday - so that I can just let it run on my way out the door, rather than having to let the computer restart in the middle of a workday. Is it possible to schedule the software update that granularly? Obviously it can't be done via system prefs, but maybe there's a hidden setting somewhere (or a utility I can download) that I'm not aware of as a Mac newb.\n\nA: If you goto the Software Update preferences, you can set it to daily, monthly or weekly. Obviously, this a very basic update scheduler. If you want to update weekly at this time just goto preferences and select weekly, now.\nYou can also do it using an Apple script + softwareupdater as described here.\n\nA: Emmy - if you want to automate this without a user approving the changes, see this thread. How to silently update OS X and reboot if necesary?\nOtherwise just use iCal to schedule and set an alarm to open the file \n/System/Library/Core Services/Software Update.app\n\nas shown below:\n\nThere are tons of ways to script this, but iCal is really simple for this task.\n\nA: You can automate this by date and time using 'launchd'\nhere's an article about it. Note: This will download the updates in the background automatically, you won't see the apple software update window. So you won't have to push any confirm to install buttons.\n", "Q: Determine cpu usage in safari tab Is it possible to somehow determine which of my safari tabs has the most cpu usage?\nNOTE: I haven't turned on any flash (i'm using a \"plugin customs\" extension) in my tabs so it's really hard to figure out visually which of the tabs is a cpu hog\n\nA: Chrome will do this. \nI know your question is about Safari but bear with me. Chrome works slightly differenty from most web browsers in that each tab is created as a separate process rather than just as separate threads. This means that if a tab starts misbehaving or crashes then it won't bring down the whole application\nThis also means that you can bring up the Chrome task manager and it will tell you about the CPU and memory usage for each time.\nWith Safari though.... I don't think this is possible.\n\nA: Unfortunately you can only monitor per application/process, and even if in different tabs, it's just on the same application.\nMy suggestion is to close tabs and check which one was the culprit (obvious answer but probably the only way).\n\nA: Safari does have Javascript Profiling and Timeline Recording.  Enable display of the Develop menu and you can use these as a way to determine what in Safari  is hogging CPU.\n\nA: In Activity Monitor, you can mouse over the safari tasks and it will pop-up which URLs are on that task.\n", "Q: Console.app bounces but does not start In a (possibly related) recent question I outline some background to a decidedly unhealthy Mac Book Pro (patched up to date with the latest 10.6 updates). \nA suggestion was to try to see what clues might appear in Console.app ... but Console.app doesn't start. It bounces in the dock, then reports that it can't open. \nWhere can I find the logs that Console.app reflects? \n\nA: Logs from Console.app are in 3 different places:\n/var/log (which is actually /private/var/log)\n~/Library/Logs (~ means your home directory)\nAnd /Library/Logs\nWhen looking for general errors, one of those locations should provide insight. Note that Console.app also shows Crash logs, and specifically lists some special log files that may not be in one of the above three directories. However, those are special purpose and won't necessarily provide any insight into the issue at hand.\n\nA: There are 2 system logs available in osX \nyou want a quick peek at the system messages?\nsyslog -w \n\nNow there are a bunch of byzantine options to this poorly named command, but\nsyslog -w -F raw\n\nWill show you a nicely formatted and labeled set of fields and values, here, let me demonstrate by displaying Safari, as it wildly tries to copy my website pages to oddly named static pngs, I'm sure for wholesome reasons.\n[Time 1305838473] [Host 8va] [Sender \\[0x0-0x19019\\].com.apple.Safari] [PID 846] [UID 501] [GID 20] [Level 5] [Message ImageIO: could not open '/Users/kb/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/Webpage Previews/.88C02C6F0DC6F52CA71726B72D215E75.jpeg-6GlG'] [ASLMessageID 3432443] [TimeNanoSec 256702000] [ReadUID 501] [Facility com.apple.console] [Session Aqua]\n\nNow, this message is here because that directory is actually /dev/null, but Safari does not know that. \nman syslog\n\nman asl.conf\n\n\nA: One other place where you can find some clues is the system.log. You need root privileges to access this file.\nsudo less /var/log/system.log\n\nIf you have Onyx installed, you can easily view all log data in one place.\n\nA: Typically when Apple built-in apps won't launch it's typically because something has gone south in launchd. Launchd is the mac unix process that spawns applications. Usually, once one goes they all start to go.\nFortunately, a reboot typically fixes this.\nIf this behaviour started right after an upgrade, a good diagnostic fix is to find the combined update and rerun it. Typically updates are deltas. 10.6.4 -> 10.6.5 for example. If a delta gets flakey, go to http://support.apple.com and look for the combo upgraded which puts down all deltas from the dot zero to present.\nFinally, when built-in OS software starts to fail, while you can poke around and try to patch it up; go hit up an Apple Store Genius. The service is free and they will also take a look at the hardware to see if there may be a memory or mother board issue.\nIn general, if a reboot or a reinstall of the OS doesn't fix OS misbehaviors; you'll likely be directed to save what files you can from the drive, wipe and reinstall from scratch.\n", "Q: Finder View Options In Finder's view options:\n\n\n*\n\n*I assume that \"Always open in list view\" pertains only to the current folder. True?\n\n*I assume that \"Use as Defaults\" pertains to the icon size, text size, and columns for that type of view—icons, list, columns, or cover flow—and is folder agnostic. True?\n\n\n*\n\n*For example, I set the list view to use the small icon size and 10 point font. Would that propagate across all folders opened in the list view or is that specific to just the current folder?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: \"Use as Defaults\" means for all windows, and in your case for all list view windows.\n", "Q: What is the best way to make a conference call/broadcast video from an iPhone? This is the scenario: there's a wedding and a couple of friends can't make it, because we're in different countries. One friend is willing to transmit the wedding live with his iPhone, but we haven't found anything that allows us to conference call (Facetime and Skype conference call seem to not be supported on iOS devices, but I'm not sure).\nThere's five of us that want to be connected simultaneously, perhaps the best option is to \"broadcast\" the call to a service such as justin.tv?\n\nA: For broadcasting the video, you can use Qik. It will allow for live interaction during the broadcast over chat. Here's the iOS app.\n\nA: Take a look at Ustream Broadcaster (iPhone App). Whatever you stream from your iPhone can be watched at http://www.ustream.tv/user/yourusername\n", "Q: Can I reactivate my Peggle Nights in-app purchase on my new iPad without being charged again? I own Peggle for iPhone and bought the Peggle Nights addon from within the app. I installed Peggle on my new iPad, but Peggle Nights isn't available.\nI've seen other iOS games (like 100 Rogues) that have a \"check for purchases\" feature alongside \"purchase\", but Peggle doesn't have this. If I click \"purchase\", will I be charged another $4, or will the app just reactivate my purchase?\n(After a few back-and-forth emails with PopCap support trying to get them to understand my question, they punted and suggested I ask Apple.)\n\nA: iTunes Store: About In-App Purchases\n\nIf you lose your In-App Purchases\n  because apps were accidentally\n  deleted, or if you had to restore your\n  device without a backup, you may be\n  able to download some of your in app\n  purchases again for free. Not all\n  In-App Purchases are eligible for free\n  download again.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Replenishable In-App Purchases and    subscriptions cannot be downloaded again for free, and must be  repurchased. Examples include but are not limited to: extra ammo additional health, extra experience points, or other one-time services. \n  \n*Non-replenishable In-App Purchases    and auto-renewing subscriptions can be downloaded again for free. Examples include: bonus game levels a map/city guide, a daily news subscription, or other recurring  services.  \n  \n*To download an In-App    Purchase again, you must download it from within the installed app using the same iTunes Store account name for the original In-App Purchase.\n  \n\nIt's an addon that is not limited, ergo a non-replenishable In-App purchase. So I would say it has to work.\n", "Q: Mac won't boot: Way to mount drive and delete one file? My macbook is currently a brick. I added a /etc/launchctl.conf file that must be malformed. The OS now crashes even when attempting to start in safe mode:\n\"launchd System bootstrapper has crashed: Seg fault\"\nI tried booting from a 10.6 boot CD but it just spun and spun. I have been able to boot an Ubuntu Live CD and mount the mac partition, but the hfsplus partition is always mounted read-only.\nThere must be an Apple utility I can use to get to a live terminal and delete this single file that is preventing my laptop from booting? If I can get the OSX install CD to boot will there be a utility that can help me?\n\nA: You can boot into single user mode by holding Command + s at startup.\nSingle user mode starts you directly at the console, bypassing core Mac OS X startup processes. You should be able to remove or alter the offending file from there.\n\nA: Don't forget there's always Target Disk Mode, too. Start the Mac and hold down T until a Firewire icon appears - you now have the world's most expensive external hard drive. :) Plug into another Mac (or a Windows PC, maybe?) and you can access the hard drive on the machine in Target Disk Mode.\n(Note that this doesn't work on Macs without Firewire. Mac Book Air users, you're bang out of luck.)\n\nA: Start in single-user mode (like that other guy said). It'll say \"If you wish to make modifications to files:\" and give you two lines of commands. Type the second one, or type the first one for a File System Check, then press Enter. Then, if you want to delete a file (let's call it \"brokenfile\"), type (without quotes): \"rm brokenfile\", then press Enter.\n\nA: I used a Microsoft install disk erased my hard drive and started over. Problem solved for me. I already had what I needed backed up on an external harddrive. \n", "Q: File named zero I've got a lot of files named 0 all over the place on my filesystem. They contain some digits (mostly also zeroes) inside.\nI'am wondering what they are and where they came from? I'm running OS X Lion Developer Preview 3, but I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nA: You might try running the command\nsudo dtrace -qn 'syscall::open:entry /arg1&O_CREAT/ {printf(\"%5d %s file:%s\\n\",pid,execname,copyinstr(arg0));}' | grep '[:/]0$'\n\nin a terminal window. The dtrace output will list the process ID, process name, and filename argument for any open() call with the O_CREAT flag set, meaning it will create the file if it does not already exist. Drop the final grep bit if you want to see all potentially file creating open() calls, but then the output might possibly overwhelm you. Hit ctrl-C when you're done with it.\nIf something keeps creating files named 0, the culprit ought to show up in the output.\n(Edit: Fixed the grep invocation.)\n", "Q: Time Machine sparsebundle corrupted on disconnect I've been using Time Machine over wifi and have had a recurring problem with corrupted sparsebundles. The scenario is a relatively new Airport Extreme, a MacBook with Leopard, and a partitioned Western Digital drive hooked up via USB to the Airport.\nThe backups work fine, if I'm just around the house, or if I remember to stop Time Machine and give it a few minutes to wind down before leaving. But if I just close the computer and run out the door, and am away from the network when I wake the computer, I come home to a corrupted backup, which generally cannot be repaired with Disk Utility (once or twice Disk Utility has been able to fix it).\nThis has forced me to delete my entire backup and start from scratch on several occasions. Is there any way around this problem, other than being vigilant about stopping backups before I leave? \n\nA: Sadly this is why the Airport Extreme isn't supported for time machine. It doesn't have the smarts to repair the filesystem or handle a disconnect as reliably.  This isn't an issue with time capsules or a server than can clean up when the backup gets interrupted. \nYou will have to nurse your setup as described, but the lifespan of sparse bundles on airport as USB disk are limited. \nPerhaps a firmware update or change to Mac OS X will make things better, but for now it's something to watch. \n\nA: This may sound like a weird answer, but this same thing (error backing up to an external drive connected to my Airport Extreme - sparse bundle error) happened to me last night. And my setup is very similar (MacBook, Western Digital External (1TB), Airport Extreme, Time Machine over Wifi). After fiddling for a while and searching various forums, I simply turned off the external drive for a few minutes and then turned it back on. The Airport eventually found it on the next Time Machine backup attempt and I am back in business. Who knew. If you are still stuck, try doing that and see what happens. I have my Time Machine settings set to not back up when not on AC power btw. This prevents the backup from running when I am in a room other than my office or for instance at Starbucks. I had the Time Machine backup start once when I was away from my lan with the same type of error. \n\nA: I have had the same problem now a couple of times on a Time Capsule even after upgrading to Lion 10.7.3... \"Disc image xxx.sparsebundle could not mount\". I simply switched the TC off and back on again, and next time Time Machine performed a normal backup without reporting any problems...\n", "Q: How can I recover a Mac HDD? Should I take it out and put it in a HDD enclosure. assuming its a 2.5\" drive, should i buy a HDD enclosure and just slot it in?\nAnyone know of a half decent FAQ that will help me with this task.\nFinally any special gotchas when reconnecting this external drive to my iMac desktop machine? Do i have to use firewire or can I use USB 2?\nSorry for what seems like lots of questions but they are related.\n\nA: No special firmware. No gotchas. USB 2 will work 'out of the box'. Just slot it in a 2.5 inch HDD enclosure (assuming it's a 2.5 HDD) and away you go.\nThe company that makes the external HDD enclosure you choose will provide instructions regarding how to put the HDD in the enclosure.\n\nA: Not sure about the circumstances of the corrupted drive, but what I've always done is used Apple's Disk Utility to first determine the extent of the corruption.\nIf the machine is not bootable, then boot using the OS X install DVD.\nIf Disk Utility cannot correct the error, then you're probably in for purchasing a recovery utility. I have not found a free one.\n\nA: iMac HDDs are generally 3.5\". Any enclosure for that size either with USB or Firewire should be fine. Here is a link to couple of recovery software. This website has several useful guides on how to replace your HDD.\n", "Q: Where are the Thunderbolt components? I've been looking around for a few weeks now and still dont see any Thunderbolt adapters, like a SATA/eSATA adapter or anything similar, is it still too soon ? i just havent seen anything on Newegg or anywhere else.\n\nA: Check out Apple Thunderbolt Display:\nhttp://www.apple.com/displays/\nIt's a Thunderbolt - Firefwire, USB, Ethernet, and Thunderbolt adapter.\n\nA: Currently Thunderbolt is advanced hi tech Vapor Ware.\nThere are a few prototype external drives floating around but until I can physically plug something multiple Thunderbolt enabled devices (as promised) in to my MacBook Pro it doesn't exist.\nI love my MacBook Pro but Apple mis-represented Thunderbolt in it's initial marketing.  The multi monitor display capability specs were removed from the website.\n.\n\n\nA: See the recent Computex event for information on that. Promise and LaCie demoed Thunderbolt-capable storage devices slated for a Summer release.\n", "Q: Native Paid VPN Service I was in a situation where I wanted to use a tunnel-all VPN, and went to Hotspot Shield's site. Much to my dismay, they ship an installer in order to use their service.\nIs there a commercial, high-quality VPN service that supports one of the built-in OSX protocols definable in the Network Preference Pane? L2TP over IPSec, PPTP, or Cisco VPN?\n\nA: As it turns out, TUAW had an article on this subject earlier this month. How I missed it (or didn't remember it) is beyond me.\nDue in part to price (as opposed to karmatic's suggestion), and also the features, namely choice of hosting regional, I'm going to sign up for OverPlay.\n\nA: vyprVPN is a pretty good paid service. It supports openVPN, L2TP/IPsec and PPTP protocols. \n\nA: expressVPN or vyprVPN, each is very good, for more good VPN services, visit this page.\n", "Q: Is there any software for mac to create this particular 3d histogram? Is there any software for mac to create this particular 3d histogram: \n\ngiven a matrix of value?\nI've tried with Numbers but it doesn't have 3d histograms.\n\nA: Mathematica is able to do this.\n\nA: You can do things like that in MatLab or the free clone Octave. There's a script here. \n\nA: Grapher is probably the app you are looking for. It is already installed on your Mac by default.\n\nA: Gnuplot mught be ablo to do this. I've seen pictures where something like this is done:\n\n\nA: Microsoft Excel works for this sort of graph as well.\n\nA: R Studio (the wonderful IDE for R) can do this. It's the kind of the thing it was meant to do really. Free, open source and, IMO, easier to grasp than Octave (and free, wherease Matlab is most definitely not). You'll likely want the RGL addon to do a 3D plot.\nThere's a StackOverflow question that deals with how you go about plotting the 3D histogram in R.\n\nA: LibreOffice (~ OpenOffice ~ NeoOffice) to give some free office applications.\n", "Q: How to send text with telnet in Terminal? I would like to send some text to a port on my machine using telnet in the Mac OS X Terminal.\nI start telnet using:\ntelnet localhost 8080\n\nThen I type some text. Is that text send automatically or do I have to do something to send the text?\n\nA: When you typing the text in telnet, by default it operates in Linemode which send the packets per line, so you just need to press Enter to send the command to the remote host (since terminal character processing on the client side). This is in order to reduce network traffic and it is very useful for long delay networks while typing the command line. If you need to send packets per character typed, then you need to switch to binary mode.\n\nTo test Telnet in Linemode, you can run the dummy server to be listening on the local port, e.g. by using netcat (install if needed):\nnc -vl localhost 1234\n\nthen in another terminal connect to your server by:\ntelnet localhost 1234\n\nand start entering some text to check when the data is received.\nHit Control-] (^]) and type quit to finish.\n\nIt is also possible to send data using Bash shell by the following command:\ncat > /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/1234\n\nthen start entering text. When finished, hit Control-D.\n\nA: The answer depends on what the remote end supports:\n\n*\n\n*Newer Line\nMode\nwhere character processing is done\nlocally while the remote only sends\nand receives control packets during\ntyping and receives whole line when entering some end-of-line char (e.g hitting ENTER).\n\n*Character-at-a-time where\neach char is transmitted as it is\ntyped.\n\n*Old line-at-a-time - fully\ncompleted lines are transmitted.\n\nWhat the remote end does with the received input, depends on the remote end. Most server processes (HTTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP) tend to wait for end-of-line (EOL, newline) char before processing input. Some others may wait for end-of-file (EOF, ^D) before starting to process the input.\n\nA: Here's a simple Python server:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport socket\n\n\nTCP_IP = '127.0.0.1'\nTCP_PORT = 5005\nBUFFER_SIZE = 10  # Normally 1024, but we want fast response\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ns.bind((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))\ns.listen(1)\n\nconn, addr = s.accept()\nprint 'Connection address:', addr\nwhile 1:\n    data = conn.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)\n    if not data: break\n    print \"received data:\", data\n    conn.send(data)  # echo\nconn.close()\n\nSource\nSave it as server.py, and run it python server.py.\nThen try to connect using the terminal\ntelnet 127.0.0.1 5005\n\nThen just type anything and press return\nThe server print the data in the console and send it back to you.\nThat way, you'll know what you have to do to send data via telnet.\n\nA: After connecting using telnet hit the escape character (usually CTRL + ]). If you do not know your telnet escape key type telnet without parameters and it will display it, from there you can go back or use open [ip] [port],\nOnce connected, you hit the escape key (CTRL + ])which will send you back to telnet where you can then type\n\nsend [message]\n\nIf you'd like to get back to sending every key, just hit a random key that isn't a part of telnet's command list.\n\nA: Try using send command after you've opened connection to the destination host.\nsend \"some text\"\n\nFor more information about send see man telnet\n", "Q: USB Stereo Microphone for iPad? What are working stereo USB microphone options for the iPad? It needs to be usable as an audio input into recorder apps? Presumably plugged into the iPad through the USB camera connection adapter.\n\nA: Blue Microphones' Yeti and Yeti Pro stereo USB microphones can be used in any recording app on the iPad via the Camera Connection Kit.\nThe manufacturer confirms that this is possible, and has detailed directions for setting it up (including a video) on this page.\nNote that you will need a powered USB hub.\n\nA: The Tascam iM2 is a stereo condenser microphone that attaches directly to the dock connector of your iPad. Tascam's PCM Recorder app interfaces with this device to record in stereo.\n\n(source: gadgetreview.com)\n\nA: I think what you desire most is to purchase one good USB microphone which can be used with multiple computing devices besides just the iPad.\nHere is another strategy: Get an iPad-to-audio interface that you can use to connect to conventional microphones.\nThe Alesis iO Dock is one possibility on the high-end.\nThe Tascam iXZ Audio Interface is another.\nIK Multimedia, Apogee and Line 6 also make similar products but they are designed for guitar input, not microphone input. Trying to get one of these to work with a microphone would be tricky due to differing impedance levels and preamplifier requirements.\nIn other news, Apogee has a forthcoming (probably quite expensive) studio-quality monaural microphone that can be plugged directly into an iPad. This should be great for podcast recording.\n", "Q: Is there a free Office App for the iOS to read Word, Excel, PowerPoint & OneNote files? I've looked around the AppStore for this but have not found one yet. Maybe my keywords are all messed up. Is there an app that will allow me to read files created by Microsoft Office on the iOS?\n\nA: These can be displayed by IOS with no software involved, other than OneNote.  The trick is getting the files onto the device.  Email is one way; you can view these files, other than OneNote, as attachments, using the ioS Mail app.\nAnother alternative is to use a sync service client (e.g. dropbox) to access the files.\n\nA: Microsoft has an official OneNote for iOS on the App Store. It was free for a limited time when I got it. It is still buggy, but should get better as it is the official app. As far as the other Office file types, I know of an app called Documents To Go. I cannot officially recommend it since I do not own it. I just know it's out there and that it supposedly allows you to open and edit Office files. You may want to check it out. \nI do agree with David's answer in that if you just need to open these files, Dropbox is a very decent solution. I use Dropbox to open files I create at home using Pages and Numbers (I do not use Office, but if I did I would still use Dropbox to open the files I had created on my iPhone). Dropbox will not allow you to edit the files, but to quickly open while on-the-go it is a very good solution. Good luck. \n\nA: I have a sky drive account so that I can access One Note anywhere including my desktop and on my iPad.  I put the skydrive app on my ipad and then uploaded the spreadsheet I needed to access on the go.  Not a perfect solution, but one that will work in a pinch when away from my desktop.\n", "Q: How to view man pages in a web browser? Which .conf file do I need to edit in order to view man pages in a web browser? I'd like to use Google Chrome to do this.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: One way to do this is to put the following command in ~/.profile:\nexport PAGER=\"col -b  | open -a /Applications/Safari.app -f\"\n\nThe PAGER environmental variable controls what program man uses to display man pages. the col command removes all of the backspace-formatting from the man page. The open command saves the output as a temporary text file and opens it with Safari.app.\nOr you can edit the PAGER variable in /private/etc/man.conf. You could also probably edit the NROFF variable and eliminate the need to use col -b. See the man page for man.conf.\n\nA: You can add a function to your ~/.bash_profile:\nfunction gman () {\n     man \"$1\" | col -b > \"/tmp/$1\"\n     open -a \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app\" \"/tmp/$1\"\n}\n\n\nA: http://www.bruji.com/bwana/ is exactly what you're looking for.\n\nA: Similar to the solution by graham, but opening the HTML version in the browser:\nfunction htman {\n    groff -Thtml -mandoc -c $(man --path $1) > /tmp/$1.html\n    open /tmp/$1.html\n}\n\n(Use >! instead of > for zsh to allow overwriting of the file.)\n", "Q: Is there a Safari Extension that automatically tracks my daily time usage on Safari? I am looking for an extension in Safari that automatically tracks my time in Safari.  Specifically, I want:\n1)  When I start Safari, the timer automatically starts/resumes.\n2)  When I stop Safari, the timer pauses.\n3)  The timer would reset every day or at a frequency I specify.\nThe basic idea is that I can track my daily usage on the internet at work, so that I don't spend too much time goofing off.  \nI don't think there's anything in the official Safari Extensions gallery.  There is WebWatch and My Work&Time, but the former doesn't satisfy criteria 2 and My Work&Time is not automatic.\nI'm running Safari 5.0.5 on Windows XP.\n\nA: Its not a Safari specific solutions, but Slife works pretty well to do what you're saying. \nhttp://www.slifeweb.com/\nNot only will it monitor how much time you spend on Safari, but also on everything else.  So now you can get an entire picture of what you do during the day.\n", "Q: Network Drive for backup (and archive and iTunes)? I have several Macs (10.6) on a wireless home network and want to add a network HDD, primarily as a drive for Time Machine to back up to. Having heard bad things about Apple's Time Capsule, I'm currently looking at buying a Western Digital 1TB NAS and connecting it via ethernet cable to a wireless router on the network. I have no experience using Time Machine, although it looks pretty straightforward.\nBefore trying this, I'd like to know:\n1) Will this actually work? WD claim their drive is 'Time Machine ready', but how should it be formatted/partitioned? Has anyone had experience doing this? Is there a better make of drive for around the same price?\n2) Assuming it's ok for backups, can I also use part of the drive to store my iTunes library (and take the pressure off my iMac's little 80Gb HDD)? If so can I use the same partition as the backup? Ditto for manual archiving of some old movie files...\nThanks.\nEdit: I've just seen this other post, which has some good things to say about the Western Digital MyBook World Edition...\n\nA: I don't have a WD but my LaCie D2 Network 2 also has Time Machine support, and it works well.  You don't partition or format it, you just flag a share as needing to support Time Machine and the device takes care of everything for you.\nAs for sharing a partition between backup and iTunes, that's not a good idea because Time Machine will eventually use all available drive space for backups, using any extra space to increase the number of versions of files it can keep.  The LaCie drive deals with this by letting you create as many shares as you want, and putting a quota on the share available to Time Machine so that it won't take over the rest of the disk.  I'm nowhere near my quota so I don't know how well it works though.  Presumably WD has done something similar.\n\nA: From reading your question and the answers so far, I'd like to clarify some terms in hopes to help you find what will help you best. Having a hard-drive manufacturer say their drive is Time Machine ready simply means that it is already formatted for the Mac. But you can always bring any external drive and format it for the Mac using Disk Utility. Of course, doing this will erase the drive, so keep that in mind. \nOnce you have your hard drive, then the next thing to clarify in the discussion is Time Machine Vs. Time Capsule. Time Machine is a Mac OS X feature that will back up your data in the background. However, this feature only works with a hard drive physically attached to your mac. As far as I know, it will not work over a network. \nOn the other hand, Apple sells a product called the Time Capsule (do not confuse this with Time Machine). The Time Capsule is a wireless network hard drive that Time Machine actually supports. Adding a Time Capsule to your network would be the only official way to use Time Machine over the network. \nFinally, regardless of whether or not you're using a Time Capsule: When you use Time Machine on a hard drive, you can continue to use the remaining space on the hard drive for storing whatever you want (like your iTunes library in your example). In other words, using Time Machine will not make use of this drive exclusive to Time Machine. The only thing to keep in mind is that Time Machine will create a folder at the root of the drive where it will keep its backup sets. Leave that folder alone and you should be fine. :)\nMy current set up consists of a 1 TB Western Digital hard drive attached over USB and backing up using Time Machine. Time Machine will create sets for each one of the last 24 hours, each one of the last 30 days, and each month until it runs out of space. In order to make the best use of the drive, and this is a tip I wanted to share with you, I have configured Time Machine via System Preferences to ignore the Downloads folder and my iTunes Podcasts folder, which have tons of data that I do not need to back up. \nYou may also want to consider looking at a Pogoplug. I do not own one (yet), but it looks like a compelling alternative to create a shared media hard drive on my local network. \nHope this helps sort things out. \n\nUpdate: As it was pointed out on this thread, there is a way to get Time Machine to work over a network. It involves modifying preferences files via the terminal and while it is not a difficult process, it is evidently not an officially supported method to use Time Machine--otherwise, the System Preferences UI would allow you to select network drives other than Time Capsules. The name of the configuration value that must be modified, \"UnsupportedNetworkVolumes\", hints at this as well. \nSo while the answer to the question \"Is it possible?\" seems to be yes, my advice for the tweak suggested on this thread is to use it at your own risk. I can't help to think that there could be a technical reason why Apple has not allowed network drives to be used for Time Machine out-of-the-box. Perhaps they haven't obtained optimal results. Perhaps a Time Capsule is better designed for working with Mac OS X and the way Time Machine itself it designed. Or... and this is also a possibility, Apple is only blocking network drives to sell more Time Capsules. \nIn any event, if you experience excellent performance with Time Machine using an officially unsupported network drive, please post to this thread and let us know how it works. Good luck. \n", "Q: Can I make a locked iTunes 'house account' for a library? I manage the computers at a public library.  We just got a donation of two iPad 2's.  I'd like to be able to lend the library patrons the iPad with the iTunes account setup (without a credit card) just for free apps/songs.\nIs it possible to create an iTunes account with a “user” password that allows free apps and songs but restricts the user from changing the profile unless they have the “master” password?\n\nA: In a nutshell: No, this is not possible without custom modifications, like with the display models in Apple Stores. It'd be better to set up the apps and content you desire, and then lock out the functions through the parental controls to prohibit any foul play. The last thing you need is legal issues, which validly could happen. App Store apps can be downloaded after purchase by simply authenticating on a separate device. Music and other entertainment forms cannot, and hence will be stuck on the iPad if a customer decides to buy them on the iPad, leaving you guys on the hook for any transaction problems that might occur.\nTread carefully.\n\nA: Should anyone be looking for this post iOS 6, there are many solutions to manage iOS apps in the manner asked.

Tried Butler among others, and it seems to come down to needing a script, and the only type of script (or workflow, action etc) is one that will just mimic the actions of opening the pane, the driver within, and then the pulldown change. All too glitchy and long for the immediacy I require. If it's not as fast the Display Toggle action then it's no use. Maybe a shellscript can do these as a system event directly? \nI started this quest first by trying to hack/remap/script the Display Toggle feature as a keyboard shortcut, but after trying every 3rd party app or hack there is, I just don't think it can be done. I can't even capture the button action because of the HID nature of the device. \n\nA: There is apple script in this page How to switch tablet input between multiple monitors on a Mac.

But 90% of the time when I visit a forum site, it's because I'm following a search result; I never ever want to install the app. Is there some setting in iOS that disables this kind of prompt?\n\nA: These sites are using JavaScript to detect Mobile Safari's user agent and displaying an alert.\nYou can disable JavaScript in Safari's settings but it's probably not worth the lost functionality.\n", "Q: iPhone Safari formatting In previous versions of Mobile Safari, when I used Google Reader on my iPhone and clicked through to open an article on the New York Times or another news site, it would open in a mobile-optimized format. This made articles really easy to read on my iPhone, since I didn't have all the junk on the Times website competing for screen space with the actual article.\nBecause the format appeared to be universal, it was clearly being done within Safari (or by the mobile version of Google Reader) and not by all these sites. But for a while (perhaps since iOS 4.x) articles are opened in in their normal formats, without being modified at all for mobile browsers. \nIs anyone familiar with this change and what might have caused it? Something in the mobile version of Safari or of Google Reader?\n\nA: It's a Google Reader setting. Scroll to the bottom of the Google Reader mobile page. Select \"Settings\". There's a checkbox you can tick that says \"Reformat linked web pages for mobile browsers\".\nIf you're using Google Reader a lot on your mobile phone, you may like a dedicated app. Reeder is great.\n", "Q: Display facebook profile pictures full size on call I synced my friends' Facebook profile pictures with the facebook iPhone app. When I get a call from someone it has the picture displayed in small in the top right corner.\nWhen someone calls whose contact photo I've taken with the iPhone itself, however, it looks like this:\n — the picture is \"full screen\".\nIs there a way to (automatically) get the Facebook profile pictures displayed this way? My iPhone is a 3G jailbroken on 4.2.1, so a Cydia tweak would be absolutely fine.\n\nA: I am still learning iPhone development so hopefully someone more knowledgeable pitches in on this idea surrounding phone calls and pictures and makes it known to the Facebook Dev. Team that the sync is not how people expect it, I ran this experiment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to a contact\n\n*Edit the contact\n\n*Edit the photo (Don't Move or Scale just tap Choose)\n\n\nNow when you try, though the picture is the same, it is maximized to the edges of the screen. Though if you have huge friend lists 500+ , it could a lot of data though going through the sync (so maybe getting the high quality version may not be a good idea). Also notice the edited photo is not saved in your Photo Library. So I am thinking that where \"Facebook Sync\" saves the photo is different from where edited Photos are stored.  \nI dont know if this is a restriction/security with the OS SDK such that pictures saved from apps for contacts are stored differently than those taken via the Camera or the Photo Library.\n\nA: SmartSync for iOS does what you want. However, not all providers support high res contact images. Gmail, for instance, doesn't as far as I know. iCloud does.

This morning I found that the sync worked just fine and the entire library is handled beautifully on the iPad.  However, I just noticed that the size of the iPhoto library on my Mac has pretty much doubled.\nThe iPad user guide says that iTunes will make optimized copies of my photos where necessary.  But is this much really necessary?  Almost every photo is a jpeg from various digital cameras, no strange formats.  Then there are a few dozen short videos from an iPhone or another digital camera.  Everything should be viewable on the iPad just fine as it is, shouldn't it?\nThe new bulk of my iPhoto library is essentially filling the drive on my aging Mac.  After doubling from 21GB to 43GB it has left me with less than 1GB of space.  (And I'm pretty sure some of that original 21GB is also wasted in a similar manner.)  Is there a way to get it to sync the library with other devices that doesn't involve doubling the library size?\n\nA: You could probably do a database repair. Hold down command+alt+shift and click on iPhoto's icon to start it. You should be presented with a window and multiple commands. The rebuild database and rebuild thumbnails options should help.\nI know that when you sync photos to an iOS device, photos are scaled downed then synced to the device, and these scaled down photos are stored within iPhoto's library. But it wouldn't explain the library doubling, though... strange.\nMake sure you have a backup of the library before doing this operation, you never know...\n", "Q: iOS development forums?

Since few people use CRTs these days, most users now have only one option: Automatic. The problem with the Automatic option is that OS X incorrectly detects many third party LCD monitors as CRTs, and consequently, disables LCD font smoothing.\nYou can force OS X to use LCD font smoothing on all displays with this Terminal command:\ndefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2\nThe number 2 here corresponds to Medium - Best for Flat Panel.

I've got 2 questions regarding password security and IPhone\nIf say I access the internet and key in my gmail password. Exactly how \"safe\" is this action?\nWhat about if i install an app and key in my apple id password. How \"safe\" is this action?\n(Btw I'm using IPhone 4 if its useful to the question..)\n\nA: No matter if you're on encrypted WiFi, unencrypted WiFi, 3G, etc. if the site's title has a lock next to it, you can be sure that your password cannot be captured by anyone snooping the traffic. The lock means that you and the website are using a secure, encrypted connection.\nKeep in mind however, that if after you log into the site and the lock no longer appears, you're vulnerable to anyone running a copy of Firefox with Firesheep installed. They won't get your password but will essentially be able to be logged in as you.\nFor sites that do not keep a secure connection (a lock in the title bar) after logging in you should avoid using them on unencrypted WiFi. As far as I know, Gmail uses a secure connection all of the time.\nWhen you enter your password for App Store purchases, even though there isn't any real indication, your phone is establishing a secure connection between it and Apple. It's very safe.\n\n\nA: It depends on how you are connected to the internet. Lets say you are on your own wi-fi network. The iPhone is as safe as any other device you use to connect to Gmail. However if you are using a public network it is a different story. Especially, any traffic sends through http protocol can be easily read by a hacker. AFAIK Gmail uses https which makes it relatively safe even on a public wi-fi network. If you use 3g network it should be OK. Although it is not really difficult to set up a 3g transmeter for less than $1500 ;)  \n", "Q: What's fastest: iPhone 4 tethering with bluetooth, usb or the new hotspot feature? I'm going to use the internet on a MacBook 5,2 and I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 4.3.1 and it's jailbroken (and using TetherMe), if it makes any differences.\n\nA: Fastest to slowest:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB\n\n*WiFi hotspot\n\n*Bluetooth\n\n\nKeep in mind the power draw of the options. From most battery efficient to least:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB (It helps that it's also charging at the same time.)\n\n*Bluetooth\n\n*WiFi\n\n\nA: Bluetooth with iPhone's specifications has a max. throughput of 3 MBit/s. So this could be a bottleneck if you get higher 3G speeds.\n", "Q: Why does the iPad use nearest-neighbour scaling rather than Retina scaling for iPhone apps When Apple announced the iPad, one of the features was the possibility of running iPhone apps, optionally scaling to 2x size with blurry results.\nFast forward to the announcement of the iPhone 4 and Retina display. The iPhone 4 uses the same apps as the legacy iPhone, only scaling images that don't have a higher resolution available. For everything else, the final render is as crispy as an app designed for the Retina display would be.\nBoth piece of hardware need to do exactly the same thing: scale up an app designed for the lower resolution legacy iPhones to twice its size. However the scheme used by the iPad ends up with blurry text and buttons, while the iPhone4 keeps everything crispy. Why didn't Apple change the scaling code to the same one used by the iPhone 4 with iOS 4?\n\nA: I don't think that Apple cares that much about 2× scaling mode. It was more important when the iPad first launched as there were hardly any native iPad apps. These days, I don't think many people are running iPhone-only apps on their iPads, let alone in 2× mode.\nIt's possible that Apple feels that retina-izing 2× mode would make some developers feel that their app was \"good enough\" in 2× mode and decide that it wasn't necessary to develop a native iPad version.\n\nA: For what it's worth, there is a jailbreak mod in Cydia called 'RetinaPad'. It makes the iPad use retina graphics (if available) and it makes a huge difference. I miss having it on my iPad 2 (which is currently not cracked yet). However I don't use many iPhone apps on my iPad. Only ones where there is no alternative or it makes sense to. Apps that come to mind are Pastebot, Eliss, Vimeo, Juxtaposer, PhotoForge2, Rdio etc.\n\nA: There are two strong reasons, one of which I got from an Apple engineer and the other of which has been implied by a few Apple employees but not stated outright.\nThe first reason is that the iPad 1 simply doesn't have enough RAM to do the emulation while rendering the Retina graphics, particularly while animating them. This come directly from someone who was involved, so I'm as certain as I can be that it's true. Of course this is a deal-killer, making the next reason unnecessary except for the fact that the iPad 2, which has double the RAM, still doesn't use the Retina graphics.\nThe second reason is that the poor quality of iPhone app graphics on the iPad encourages developers to build universal apps or to additionally build an iPad version of the iPhone app. These universal/iPad apps make the iPad much more appealing to consumers and sells more iPads. It's particularly important for apps that use standard Cocoa Touch controls where the double-sized text, double-sized picker controls (the spinners), etc. actually look pretty bad and aren't terribly usable (in the UI/UX sense), and the 1X/2X button is kind of a hack. If iPhone graphics looked nearly as good on the iPad there'd be much less incentive to build the other apps, especially if there was little competition for yours.\nI suspect that if Apple/Steve Jobs felt the iPad would have sold well if it only ran new apps built especially for it then there wouldn't be a compatibility mode at all. Instead they were able to launch the iPad saying that there are a couple of hundred thousand iPhone apps that would run on it in addition to the few thousand iPad/universal apps available.\nIt is possible to build an iPhone-specific app that substitutes Retina graphics if you do it \"by hand,\" overriding the OS's default rendering. Matt Rix's excellent non-universal iPhone puzzle games Trainyard and Trainyard Express look and play great on the iPad for this reason. It just takes a bit of extra work.\n", "Q: What exactly is free incoming calls per second billing? I'm using iPhone Lite and was wondering:\nWhat exactly is free incoming calls per second billing?\nIs it the same as free incoming calls?\nAnd do I only have 3 free month caller number display?\n\nA: *\n\n*Free incoming calls - you receive calls for free\n\n*Per Second Billing - your calls are timed per second, not per blocks (etc. 5 seconds per x cents), and is for outgoing calls (when you call people, not when people call you)\n\n*3 month free caller number display - you get to see the number of the person calling you for 3 months\n\n", "Q: ipad ssh application with solid copy / paste support I have been using iSSH on the ipad when I need to ssh to my servers; however, one of the glaring problems with iSSH is that you don't have copy / paste support within the iSSH terminal application (supposedly it is there if you will run VNC, but that is not an option).\nHas anyone got an ipad ssh application with good copy / paste functionality?  I need to be able to copy text from within the session and paste it into a browser (and vice versa).\n\nA: Panic Software recently released Prompt, the best iOS SSH app I've seen.

After that when I click on add, I get a list of home,work,fax,etc. But no second mobile number.\nMy 5 years old Nokia phone let me add custom labels to any phone number, like I can add a number and name it \"boat phone\" , gmail contacts also can do it.\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: A custom label will have to suffice here. I have many contacts with their cell phones listed as 'mobile', and then a custom 'Google Voice' labeled number.\n[edit]\nAn alternative to this is to make the change via Address Book.app on your computer, then sync the contacts to your phone.\nCustom labels are available in all contact adding/modification screens.\nFirst, browse to a contact, and tap the label name (to the left of a phone number, e-mail address, etc.). You will see the list of labels.\n\nSecond, swipe all the way to the bottom, and tap on \"Add Custom Label\".\n\nType in a new Custom Label;\n\nAnd then it will be displayed next to the number.\n\nIt will now appear in a list of custom labels on later access.\n\nA: You probably have your Google Sync turned on. Go into Settings on your iPhone, choose \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\", choose the Google account your contacts are synced with, turn off \"Contacts\". Now you can create multiple fields with the same label.\nAfter turning this feature off, some of your contacts may no longer appear on your phone, or they may appear with missing information. But they are still on your Google account, you can export your google contacts and re-import them into your phone instead of syncing them. Or you can sync again to bring all your contacts back.\n", "Q: Clickthrough Hotel WiFi Access Page, and Sparkle I'm currently at a hotel that forces you to click through an \"accept screen\" before being able to access the Internet.\nThe way it works, as best as I am able to tell, is;\nWhen you make your first port 80 HTTP request after joining the wifi network, the proxy server intercepts your request, and takes you to a screen in which you must read the terms of service, check a box, and click the submit/accept button.\nThe problem is that it does this only for first request, then denies all additional port 80 requests, and disallows all other requests until then page is acknowledged.\nThe issue at hand is that this page only appears for the first HTTP request, and with the myriad of sparkle-update powered software I have running, I'm suspecting that the confirmation screen is being delivered to one of these apps, instead of too my browser.\nI've tried logging in with holding shift after entering my password (disables login items) which disabled everything except for MenuMeters, and still I could not get the foxy confirmation screen to come up.\nI rebooted into safe boot mode and was able to get the confirmation screen to come up. So I rebooted normally. Unfortunately, I could not access the internet after doing so, and I suspect the confirmation screen once again became trapped behind a menu bar app.\nIs there some step I'm missing that may drastically reduce the difficulty I'm having with this confirmation step?\n\nA: What about an application level firewall like noobproof(free) or little snitch(paid) to block any requests and then only authorize your web browser?\n\nA: Had a similar issue at a DoubleTree a few weeks ago. Switching to Safari to surf to the first page fixed the problem.

It was working poorly for the last month or so and the last 4 times I turned it on it booted correctly once, issued a boot sector not found twice and a kernel panic the remaining time.\nI have backups but I'd rather try to get the information from that hard drive (it's more up to date). My original plan was to just plug it in and let macosx migrate the account, but I don't think that's such a good idea as the hard drive is so flaky.\nMy current plan is to copy everything to a directory using rsync so I can re-issue the command as many times as needed until everything is copied succesfully.\nDoes anybody have any advice?\nI also have some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once I have everything in an alternate directory, how do I restore the configuration of a running macosx? Should I do it with a sparate account.\n\n*My current installation is using  FileVault. Should I try opening and then rsyncing or should I try rsyncing the big bundle file? \n\nA: Use the drive as little as possible.  Plug it into an enclosure or simply boot the machine in TDM mode and connect it to another machine.\nPull over only the files you need (to minimize the time you spend accessing the drive).\nYou may want to do something like, just your ~/Desktop, ~/Documents, ~/Pictures, ~/Library/Mail, and ~/Library/Mail Downloads.\nDo either:\na) the biggest folders last, again, so that if the drive suddenly dies on you, you got as much stuff off it as possible, or;\nb) the most important folders first, such as any pictures you don't have backed up.\n\nA: Can I suggest you go back in a time a month and hit the person using the computer with a a large stick screaming \"Always immediately replace a failing drive. Always immediately replace a failing drive. Always immediately replace a failing drive. Always immediately replace a failing drive.\" I suggest you do this until blood is oozing out his ears because that guy back a month is extremely slow on the uptake.\nBoot off another drive. Pray to whatever God you most trust (or Stephen Fry if, like me, you are an atheist).\nAnything that is totally irreplaceable, such as photos, get off as quickly as possible using drag and drop in the Finder and forget the rest. (Of course you might want to ask yourself why you put the only copy of irreplaceable photos on a failing disk drive. Take out the stick again while asking the question.)\n\nA: If you have a PC available, you could run Spinrite on the drive to try to recover the data on those bad sectors.\n\nA: Sometimes it's best to use Terminal to copy data from a failing drive, it's always worked for me. \nMount the failing drive using either Target disk mode or using a Hard Drive caddy(Enclosure). \nIn Terminal use the command SUDO then drag the folders you want to copy into the terminal window in the format \"SOURCE then Destination\"\nThere is a space after a SUDO command. \n", "Q: Why can't I run `su`? (and how should I do?) Whenever I try to issue su I get this:  \n$ su  \nPassword:  \nsu: Sorry\n\nNeedless to say, I'm entering the correct admin password which does work with sudo. What I want is not having to enter sudo each time.\n\nA: Modern solution: sudo -u\nTo run as another use, use sudo -u.\nFor example, to run a text-editor such as nano:\nsudo -u someuser nano\n\n…and enter your Mac admin user password when prompted. At this juncture, it is your Mac admin user who is invoking sudo, not the someuser user so you do not enter the someuser password.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo means to run something using superuser privileges.\n\n*-u means “run a specified command as this specified user”.\n\n*someuser should be replaced with your desired user name.\n\n\nTo simulate an initial login as a particular user, including running their startup scripts, use -I.\nsudo -u someuser -i nano\n\nThis runs the nano app as the user someuser but only after having run the startup scripts for that user.\nIf we opt to not specify a command or app to run, we get an interactive shell running as that user.\nsudo -u someuser -i\n\nOld-school: sudo su someuser\nAnother approach uses the su command in combination with the sudo. The su command means “switch user”. \nsudo su someuser\n\nOr, to include running the user's startup scripts, add the hyphen.\nsudo su - someuser\n\nroot user\nThe root user in Unix-related operating systems have absolute power to do anything. \nApple has chosen to disable the root account in macOS, to avoid security vulnerability exploits and to protect you from shooting yourself in the foot. Apple created the idea of the Administrator user accounts who have many powers, more powers than a Standard user account, but not absolute power like root has. See this Apple Support note for discussion.\nIf need be, you can enable the root user in macOS and then switch to that user. This is strongly discouraged. I would go down this path only as a desperate last resort.\n\nFor discussion of this within the context of the postgres user running the Postgres database system on macOS, see this Question on the sister site, DBA Stack Exchange.\n\nA: In MacOS X, the root user is disabled by default, therefore su will not work. As others have stated, it's best to use sudo. \nIf you must enable the root user, see Apple's technote: Enabling and using the \"root\" user in Mac OS X.\n\nA: You have two options. The first is to use sudo -s - this will give you superuser access, but you will still remain 'yourself' (so to speak), so things like ~ will still be your home directory. Alternatively, you can use sudo su, which gives you a shell as the actual root user of your Mac.\n\nA: I think you can't do this as a \"normal\" user...\nIf there is another user account with admin rights you have to use this one\nrestricted user$ su\nPassword:(the root password here)\nSorry!\n\nrestricted user$ su - (an admin account here)\npassword:(the admin account password)\n$ su - root\nPassword:(The root password here)\n# -> You are root user now\n\n\nA: For instance, if you need move files or use git using the CLI then, in that case, the best solution will be to use the sudo -s command. After that command, you don't have to keep entering the password again and again.\n\nA: I had this same problem and as @Nohillside suggested, there is no way to access root through the su command as a normal user just using su. As stated, adding the admin account to the su command is recognized. I was able to connect as root that way. It's not something I will do often. I just wanted to test it and the result was an immediate connection.\n> admin-server:~ admin$ su\n> Password:\n> su: Sorry\n> admin-server:~ admin$ su - admin\n> Password:\n> admin-server:~ admin$\n\n\nA: Try the password alpine?! Legend has it that alpine was the root password on macOS for many years! You can get to root from an admin account shell with:\nsudo su \n\nI recommend then changing the password for root with:\npasswd\n\nAfter this I can just run su and type the actual root password. Handy for going root from a regular user account.\n", "Q: Using Car Speaker As Music Player in iPhone I have an ordinary bluetooth speaker.\nI connect to the device using bluetooth and when someone calls me I can hear my ringing tone through the car's stereo and hear the caller's voice through the car's stereo.\nProblem is, I can't use this device to play music through the car's stereo. The device only uses the car stereo if someone is calling me.\nIs there an app (maybe something from cydia) that can fix that problem? I basically want every sound from my iphone to be played through the car's stereo INSTEAD the iphone's speaker.\n\nA: If your stereo does not register that it supports the A2DP profile, then it likely will also not handle A2DP communication. It is not as simple as finding an app that will \"fix the problem\", because the problem is likely that your Stereo does not support audio playback. The level of difference between A2DP for audio playback and HSP for maintaining calls is enormous.\nPerhaps you may be able to talk to the dealer and see if there is a firmware update for the stereo itself, something they can do to enable this feature. But otherwise, no App can solve it alone.\n", "Q: How does the defaults domain ‘Network’ work? (/Network/Library/Preferences/) How does the Network preference/defaults domain work on Mac OS? I see it referenced in a lot of Apple documentation, but I don’t understand this particular preference domain.\nI get the user defaults in ~/Library/Preferences, and the administrator-provided defaults in /Library/Preferences. But the Network domain puzzles me.\n\nThe preferences system stores preference data in files located in the Library/Preferences folder in the appropriate file-system domain. For example, if the preference applies to a single user, the file is written to the Library/Preferences folder in the user’s home directory. If the preference applies to all users on a network, it goes in /Network/Library/Preferences. (source)\n\nCan anyone reference some use-case based documentation? or explain how it works?\nWill other Macs on the same network magically start respecting the Network preferences?\n\nA: The network library is intended for client computers bound to a network domain server.  A domain server acts as a central repository for configuration information -- mostly user accounts, but also (among other things) mount records.  Mount records tell the client computers to automatically mount a certain file server share point automatically.  If you use this to tell all the clients to mount a particular share point on /Network/Library, then you can put Preferences, Fonts, etc folders inside that share point and they'll be automatically available on all clients in the network domain.\nThis used to be a common way to manage network clients in NextStep (the predecessor of OS X), but is very rarely used in OS X.  There are better ways to do most thing now, like putting managed preference settings directly in the network domain.  At this point, the network library is more of a historical artifact than anything else...\n\nA: The /Network domain is just another of the operating system’s domain for storing settings, frameworks, plugins, etc. Here’s the search order of domains:\n\n\n*\n\n*User (a user’s home directory—~; a typical folder is ~/Library/Fonts)\n\n*Local (root level folders such as /Applications, /Library)\n\n*Network (/Network is a mount point for shared resources; see below)\n\n*System (everything beneath /System)\n\n\n/Network is the place to put things that you want each user who logs onto your server  (or accesses your network filesystem) to have access to without installing them for each user. For example, if you support a bunch of programmers, you can put coder-friendly fonts (Anonymous Pro, Vera Sans Mono, Inconsolata, etc.) in /Network/Library/Fonts. PreferencePanes, plugins, ColorPickers and the like would go into their respective folders within /Network/Library.\nApple documents this in their File System Overview document.\n", "Q: Third-party service that syncs preferences? Like MobileMe Are there any third-party software or services that offer synchronization of user-preferences the same way that MobileMe does?\nI’m thinking of the user defaults that live inside ~/Library/Preferences/\nWith conflict resolution and merging of property lists, of course.\n\nA: I've got a system set up with Dropbox to do something like this.  I have several settings files (.profile, .gitconfig, ~/Applications, etc) living in my Dropbox, and then I run a script to iterate through them and set up symlinks to their appropriate location.\nYou could probably do something similar, perhaps even by symlinking your entire ~/Library/Application Support folder.\n", "Q: Will I ever spoil my iPhone by placing it on top of my laptop? Does anyone know if I will ever spoil my iPhone by placing it on top of my laptop?\nI mean I don't know about these electronic/magnetic stuff and I want to know if there may be any problem putting them close together (especially when my laptop is running and heated)\n\nA: Your iPhone will not spoil if placed on your laptop. Unless it is so hot that your iPhone warns you about its temperature.\nConcerning the electronic/magnetic stuff, your laptop will not give out that much amount of stuff to spoil the iPhone, unless your laptop is a microwave.\n\nA: Though it won't likely damage your laptop or phone, it's a general rule of thumb not to place two electronics on top of each other.\nWill you spoil your phone at that moment? Very low chances. Will you ever spoil your phone by doing it?

No configuration changes have happened and another machine still on 10.6.6 works correctly.\nIf you've experienced this and resolved the issue, please advise.\n\nA: Not sure if it's the same issue, but I've had problems with the 10.7 built-in Cisco IPSec client from within my work network - there are some cryptic references (i.e. tech-speak I don't understand) to what Apple changed at the bottom of this support discussion.\nSwitching over to a tethered 3G connection fixed the problem. I mention it here in case someone stumbles across this page & it helps them.\n\nA: Apparently the Cisco client doesn't work in 64bit mode, so you need to reboot and hold down the 3 and 2 keys whilst booting to boot into 32bit mode.   That should make it work.\nInfo here.\n", "Q: Copying Time Machine backup, destination takes more than original size, are hardlinks being expanded? I'm copying the backup folder of Time Machine, but it's taking too long, the backup is 90GB and the copy already reports 160GB and there's 60% to go yet, so I suspect it's copying hardlinks as different \"solid\" versions of the files.\n(which would take up much more space than I have avaible, which is 300GB)  \nI tried making a partition of 120 GB to fit it by restoring from disk utility, but it said there wasn't enough space.  \nAlso tried to restore to a sparse bundle on a partition with 300GB free, but didn't work either.  \nIs there a better or smarter way of doing this within my 300GB space?  \nedit & PS: The only alternative if this doesn't work is keeping only the last backup and saying bye bye to the older ones.\nPS 2: Time Machine just recognized the old Backup folder and resumed from it even when the OS was freshly re-installed.\n\nA: If you are using an entire drive for time machine backup, I would suggest using Carbon Copy Cloner latest version with block-to-block copy. I have seen people use Disk Utility for this but I haven't got this to work.\nAs noted in this answer CCC does not work for TM backups now (since BigSur?) see CCC site\n\nA: Use rsync. rsync is included in MacOS X, it's widely recognised in the unix world and it  can be used locally and on the network and can preserve hardlinks, attributes and permissions. Check the manual page for more information, IMHO this should work:\nrsync -avHE /Volumes/Source/ /Volumes/Destination/\n\n(archive, verbose, preserve hardlinks, preserve extended attributes).\n\nA: Starting from January 2020, CCC is not allowing clone tasks for Time Machine volumes, see this official docs: https://bombich.com/kb/ccc5/can-i-use-carbon-copy-cloner-clone-time-machine-backup\nHowever another application SuperDuper! does the trick. It's free for tasks like a simple clone. Make sure to select \"Backup - all files\" option after setting the source and destination partitions.\nIt took 11 hours to move 900GB of data to a new drive, but it worked really well under macOS Big Sur. I've already finished my first new backup tasks to the new drive.\n\nA: Not the exact solution, but now that I reinstalled the OS, with great surprise and joy, I find that Time Machine resumes backing up with the same backup folder from before, just calculated the differences and off it went. :D\nAs I wasn't going to restore the full backup, none of it actually, I thought Time Machine would need to start over with an empty backup, that's why I wanted to backup the TM backup folder, but it's not needed\n", "Q: Is there a way to access Google Contacts using iPhone? I have all my contacts in Google Contacts, so I was wondering is there anyway I could sync them with the contacts on the phone? \nEdit: Now I've set it up properly, however there are still no contacts in my phone! Do I need to do anything else after syncing to get the contacts to my phone?\nEdit: For some reason I can read my emails using my phone but still no contacts!\n\nA: Google has made it easier to do this by implementing CardDAV for iOS5+.\nHere's the link: http://support.google.com/mail/answer/2753077?hl=en\nInstead of using a Google Exchange account you'll do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail, Contacts, Calendars >>\n\n*Add Account... >>\n\n*Other >>\n\n*Contacts: Add CardDAV Account\n\n*Server = google.com; user name = [fullEmail]; pw = [gmailPw]; desc =\n[optional].\n\n\nIt worked great for me on an iPhone5 with iOS 6.1.2.\n\nA: Sure.

Can I remove the keys or how can I get the sticky food from underneath the key?\n\nA: You can clean these keys.  You need to lift up the individual keys from the bottom, there is a hinge that they click into at the top. DO NOT FORCE, they will come up. A guitar pick like device will helps. Once the keys are up, you can clean up the gunk underneath. \nThe keys that are not square get pried up from the side, and some have small metal springs that may get lost if you're not careful.\nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Where are environment variables specified when .profile, .bash_login, .bash_profile cannot be found?

When I check / or ~, however, I do not see a .profile, .bash_login or .bash_profile.\nWhere is this being stored in Mac OS X 10.6.7 ?\nThanks,\nScott\n\nA: It sounds like you are using bash.\nbash first runs /etc/profile. /etc/profile (on Mac OS X 10.6.7) runs path_helper(8) which is where your default paths get set. After that it runs /etc/bashrc which doesn't do much. Once the default configuration is set, it moves on to the user login scripts.\nbash looks in your home directory for .bash_profile, .bash_login, and .profile in that order. bash will run the first of these that it finds and stop looking.\n\nA: Usually those files should reside in your /etc directory. In case when you don't have your local copy of say .profile then the system uses /etc/profile .\n\nA: Have a look at the following links.

I always leave the Airport on on the macbook so that's on too.\nIt's now in \"sleep\" and the lid is closed.\nWhen I go to the LogMeIn dashboard it says offline... is this because the Wake-On-Lan is not working? Has anyone had this issue or know how to fix it?\ncheers\n\nA: It is not possible for the Macbook to go out of sleep when the lid is closed and no external display and input devices are connected. Your best option therefore is to keep the lid open.\n\nA: The checkbox for wake-on-LAN only allows the ethernet interface to respond to what's called a \"magic packet\" that will then cause the system to wake up. I don't know what the LogMeIn dashboard looks like, but if it's just a status report for the other computers on your local network, then it is reporting the state of your MacBook accurately. If the Dashboard has the capability of sending the magic packet, then that is a step you will need to execute before the machine comes back online.\nIf it doesn't do this, you'll need an extra tool to send the wakeup call.\nJust making sure, you're doing all of this from within your local network, right?\n\nA: LogMeIn specify another requirement that you may not have met:\n\"Please also confirm that at least one other LogMeIn host on the same LAN is online and available\"\nI presume this is required so that LogMeIn can communicate with that \"live\" host and send the magic packet from that host to the Mac that you want to wake up.\nDetails found here: http://community.logmein.com/t5/Free/Wake-on-LAN/td-p/31061\n", "Q: How to cd to a directory with a name containing spaces in bash? I tried cd \"~/Library/Application Support/\"\n-bash: cd: ~/Library/Application Support/: No such file or directory\nalso cd ~/Library/Application Support/\n-bash: cd: ~/Library/Application Support/: No such file or directory\n\nA: You can alternatively just drag a folder to the Terminal window too, the complete file/folder path will be auto-pasted on drag.\n\nA: You need to escape the space in \"Application Support\"\nTry $ cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/\n\nA: The core issue here is how the shell (bash) does quoting and how that affects tilde expansion and splitting into “words” (arguments for the program being run).\nbash only treats the leading tilde specially if it is not quoted. In addition, the following slash must also not be quoted.\nAt the same time, bash parses command lines into “words” based on non-quoted whitespace. The cd command typically requires exactly one argument (the destination directory). A command line like cd foo bar means to run cd with two arguments: foo and bar. If you only wanted to send a single foo bar argument, then you need to quote the space:\n(e.g.) cd foo\\ bar (see more quoting example below).\nIn your particular situation, you need to leave the tilde and the following slash unquoted while quoting the space in the directory name. Your cd \"~/Library/Application Support/\" trial ends up quoting too much (the tilde and its slash), while your cd ~/Library/Application Support/ trial quotes too little (it omits quoting the space in the directory name).\nThe most common solution is to use single-character escaping to quote just the space:\n    cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support\n\nYou can also use single or double quotes around either just the space or the space and some other bits of that argument (but not the ~/!):\n    cd ~/Library/Application' 'Support\n    cd ~/Library/Application\" \"Support\n    cd ~/Library/App'lication 'Support\n    cd ~/Library/Application\" Supp\"ort\n    cd ~/'Library/Application 'Support\n    cd ~/\"Library/Application \"Support\n\nThese kinds of quotes have different meanings, but they are identical in these examples. Single quotes protect literal strings while double quotes allow various expansions and substitutions in the quoted region.\nOften, you can just let the shell do the work for you.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Globbing (wildcards):\ncd ~/L*/Ap*\n\nYou can use shopt -s nocaseglob to make globbing case insensitive:\ncd ~/l*/ap*\n\n\n*Completion:\nPressing Tab after entering cd ~/L will probably expand it to cd ~/Library/.\nPressing Tab again after entering Ap (you now have cd ~/Library/Ap) will probably expand it to cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/ (the shell automatically inserted the escaping backslash).\nYou can use bind 'set completion-ignore-case on' to make completion case insensitive:\ncd ~/l Tab → cd ~/Library/; ap Tab → cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/\n\nA: You can use the Tab key after pressing the first few characters (this will then \"fill in\" the rest of the folder for you e.g. type cd ~/LTab fills in cd ~/Library/ then type ApTab and it will fill in the rest for you.\nIf there is a space between words and you don't want to use the methods above, put a \\ (backslash) before the space, e.g. cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support.\n\nA: When you double-quote a path, you're stopping the tilde expansion. So there are a few ways to do this:\ncd ~/\"My Code\"\ncd ~/'My Code'\n\nThe tilde is not quoted here, so tilde expansion will still be run.\ncd \"$HOME/My Code\"\n\nYou can expand environment variables inside double-quoted strings; this is basically what the tilde expansion is doing\ncd ~/My\\ Code\n\nYou can also escape special characters (such as space) with a backslash.\n\nA: You can try this for spaced folders/files by\nIf the file or folder name contains\n1)file name.extension \nthe command should be\ncd ~/file\\ name.extension/ (or) cd ~/\"file name.extension\"/\n\nA: If the normal ways don't work, trying substituting spaces with %20.\nThis worked for me when dealing with SSH and other domain-style commands like auto_smb.\n", "Q: Mouse/Keyboard won't connect after being powered off my iMac has recently developed an odd issue:\nIf the mouse, or keyboard, is powered off (power button, or because I pull the batteries), and then powered on again, the device will not connect to the machine again without the whole system being power cycled.\nThese are:\n* Magic Mouse\n* Apple Wireless keyboard\nOn a late 2009 i7 27\" imac.\nRunning all the latest patches.\n100% battery on both devices.\nNo matter how many times I click the mouse, or press keys on the keyboard will it reconnect.\nIt had happened previously, but after a few minutes it would usually resolve itself.

I have booted up into my Windows boot camp partition and the screen remains off as if the lid is closed. Plugging in an external monitor also works in Windows.\nGiven the link to iFixit (which I hadn't thought to look at) I'm going to have a look at the sleep sensor and see if there is any obvious fault. Failing that, I have found a couple of nearby service centres at the link provided by bckbck in the comments. Thanks.\n\nA: The sleep sensor or MLB is likely faulty. A visit to the genius bar might be a good next step. Also posting the system.log sleep messages might help us determine the reason the mac is triggering sleep - search for \"cause\" using the console.app\nEDIT: Thanks for adding the console messages - the system is certainly getting a signal telling it the display is shut. It's possible (but very unlikely) a new OS install from scratch would let the system read the sensor properly (software corruption can never be ruled out without trying a clean install). It's very likely the component in your mac housing the sleep sensor went bad as when the sensor fails on it's typically the sensor and not the cable or logic board at fault.\n", "Q: how can I convert the values of a table into percentage values rather than absolute values? In Numbers, how can I convert the values of a table into percentage values rather than absolute values ? \nThe percentage are computed per column. The sum of the cells in a column is 100%.\ni.e. http://d.pr/NNwn\nthanks\n\nA: If I'm not mistaken you could do that more or less easily: \nSay for example column comedy. \nThe total is 534 (sum). \n\n\n*\n\n*132 (1st row) is the 24.71% (132 x 100 / 534). \n\n*3 (2nd Row) is the 0.56%… \n\n*1 is the 0.18% \n\n*398 is the 74.53%.\n\n\nThe sum of 24.71+0.56+0.18+74.53 == 100% (minus rounding, add more decimals for more precision).\nSo if you add a final ROW with the SUM  (below technology for example) you can cause each cell to perform a Cell * 100 / TOTAL_OF_COLUMN and get your %.\nWhat am I missing?\n", "Q: Airport guest network when the network gets extended I'm looking to extend both the main SSID and the separate guest network from an airport extreme base station for more range. What apple networking hardware is needed? I presume two express would do the trick, one joining each SSID - but wonder if I can do it with less hardware. Advice or tips appreciated. \n\nA: Apple express would be your best/cheaper option than getting another extreme. You could use third party hardware, but the results are inconsistent as Apples bridging is slightly different to the standard. \nYou could use power line networking if you wanted to extended it further than the current wireless network provides. This assumes you're on the same phase of power and wanted to pony up the extra cash. \n\nA: I jumped in and got two airport express - one to extend the 2.4 GHz network and another to extend the 5 GHz network. The setup is working for more than one day so i'm calling it a success.\nIt appears a second extreme cannot simply extend all three potential networks (the guest Vlan on the 2.4 channel and the two normal channels.)\nI ended up not extending the guest and instead ran an Ethernet cable to move the base station where the guest network was needed and extended the main net back to where the extreme was and Internet access remains.\n", "Q: Mac doesn't recognize hosts on local network I have a Linux server in my cupboard. My Windows machines can connect to it via its hostname. I have never configured any DNS server; all I did was assign the Linux box a name when I installed Ubuntu on it. It's running a Samba file server. \nMy Macbook Pro doesn't recognize the host name. How can I make my Macbook find the machine the same way the Windows machines can? The Linux machine's IP is dynamically assigned via DHCP so I don't want to add a permanent entry to a hosts file or similar.

You click, drag, and let go one of these tabs and it becomes an independent terminal window. After a while, you want to take this terminal window and reattach it as a tab to the previous window. How do you do it ? I have seen the merge windows option in the menus, but that merges all windows into one, which I would then have to revert.\n\nA: You need to click and drag the tab from one window onto the tab bar of the other window to reattach it. \nIf either window has no tab bar because it is currently showing only one tab, Command + T to open a new tab, perform the action, then close any tabs you don't need. This works for both Terminal and iTerm2.\nFull credit to Dan Jameson in the comments for this obvious solution.\n\nA: The answer is to hold down command + shift + option whilst dragging the body of the terminal (not the tab) back to the terminal you wish to merge.  \nSource: http://azaleasays.com/2014/03/05/iterm2-merge-a-pane-back-to-window-or-tab-bar/\n\nA: I had troubles merging windows with the Hotkey Window profile.  I eventually found a way to un-split the windows by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferences > uncheck Hide tab bar when there is only one tab\n\n*Set Tab position to Bottom\n\n*Press your hotkey to show the Hotkey Window\n\n*Click & drag the tab into the Hotkey Window's tab bar\n\n\nA: For Terminal (as opposed to Terminal2):\nIf the window you want to attach has just one tab (I.e. no tab bar) then add another tab. Then drag the tab of the one you want to the tab bar of the window you want to add it to.\nI found it took a bit of jiggling before th image changed from an thumb nail of the window to just the tab.  This is the signal that your are in the right place!\nIt took me a while to realise I needed to add another tab but is is logical.\n\nA: You need to, in the window you want to move, go to View-> Show Tab Bar (if the tab bar isn't showing already).\nThen, drag the tab of the window you want to move onto the window you want to move it to.\nUpdate for iTerm 2: In iTerm 2 the setting is no longer exposed in the View menu.  Go to iTerm > Preferences > Appearance > Tabs and check \"Show tab bar even when there is only one tab\". Note that in early releases of iTerm 2 the setting was \"Hide tab bar when there is only one tab\".\n\n\nA: I have iTerm2 (Build 1.0.0.20130302) here - there's no View > Show Tab Bar. But as Chris Page suggested, disabling Hide tab bar when there is only one tab (in Preferences > Appearance) helps. The single windows can then be moved and merged again.\n", "Q: Hard wired link between webcam and led indicator? In light of stories about stories about secret monitoring over laptop webcams (such as this one or this one), I wonder about the reliability of the green LED next to the camera that indicates that it's in use.\nIs there a known hard-wired link between the camera on a MacBook Pro and the indicator that is impossible to circumvent in software?\nWould such a thing be possible given the hardware of the camera?\n\nA: I just read another article about that on Ars Technica\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes the LED is hardwired\n\n*But it can still be bypassed\n\n\nOnly downside of this article, it was only tested on \"old\" (late PPC, early Intel) macs. \n\nA: Today I stumbled across a proper publication regarding this topic: Researches from the Johns Hopkins University recently published the paper \"iSeeYou: Disabling the MacBook Webcam Indicator LED\", showing that they were able to deactivate the iSight status LED on older MacBooks even without root access by replacing its firmware.\nIt appears they were able to do so by bypassing the standby signals sent by the USB interface; thus while the LED gets the order to \"standby\", the camera stays on.\n\nA: Correct. It is not possible for someone to disable this. When the logic board or LCD panel fail, or sometimes after a severe power outage, this light can get stuck on, requiring hardware service, or a reset of certain components. Keep the tape if you like, but the techs will knowingly shake their head and chuckle.\n", "Q: How to open older .imovieproject files (folders) in iMovie '09 How do I open older .imovieproject files (they're actually folders folders) in iMovie '09?\nI don't want to import the assets of the old project, I want the actual project to open on iMovie '09.\n\nA: You can't, actually. iMovie '08 and subsequent versions are a completely different program from iMovie HD 6 and previous versions.\nHowever, the last released version of iMovie HD does still run on modern Macs. It used to be a free download for users of iLife '08, but Apple has since removed it (IMHO, to \"encourage\" power users to upgrade to Final Cut Express, since iMovie '08 was utterly useless if you happened to have been one of the few who knew what they were doing).\nIt is still possible to download and install iMovie HD through some avenues of questionable legality.\n\nA: Had this question myself since I couldn't get the folder to be registered right due to the incompatibility.  Then I realized the \"Media\" folder in my .IMovieProject folder contained an MOV file I could just re-use in a new project.  Shame to loose my minimal editing, but at least I have something.\n", "Q: Is buying iPhone apps like a subscription or a one time purchase? I've got a couple of questions regarding buying iPhone apps. \n1) If Fruit ninja is $0.99 does it mean that if I buy it i will have to pay $0.99 every year? or is it a one time payment (what other hidden payments are there?)\n2) Is there anyway we can be tricked into buying something that is not what we thought it is.. like if i search for fruit ninja (or some other game) how big is the chance that there is a \"con app\" waiting for me to buy but isn't actually the original one.\n\nA: 1) It's a one-off payment.\n2) Apple don't allow duplicate app names in the store, so as long as you make sure that the name of the app you're buying exactly matches the name of the app that you want, then you should be OK. Or if it's a popular app, like Fruit Ninja, just buy it from the listing of most popular apps.\n\nA: Just a few words of note:\nIt is possible for a developer to submit a major upgrade to an app (albeit with a different name) and require payment again. This was pretty common in the days before iOS - major updates required you to repurchase your app, point releases were free. Perhaps the most infamous case on iOS was when Tweetie 2 came out - users who had paid for Tweetie, even just days prior, were now expected to buy the app again if they wanted all the new features. \nThat being said, very few iOS developers do that, and will generally will make it very clear when a situation such as that arrises.\nThe other note is that some applications will offer in app subscriptions to content, specifically magazine applications. As far as I know it's not possible for regular apps to do so but I could be mistaken there. But, again, generally speaking this is for a specific type of app and you won't likely encounter it often.\n", "Q: Upgrade Apps from iPod to iPad I'm considering buying an iPad 2. I already have an iPod Touch and was wondering if there is a way to upgrade apps, either for free or pay the difference, that I have already purchased in order to get the iPad specific version, or do I have to rebuy anything that I would want on the iPad? I know it can run iPhone apps, I'm just looking at the apps that have specific ones for each device.\n\nA: It depends:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are a few universal apps (the ones that will have a + icon in their purchase area), which means that they run in a native UI on both devices. Many developers have added this to their apps for free to the user. In this case, you probably even have the updated version already, and it will work just right on your iPad. Some examples may be like Instapaper, NewsRack, 2Do, The Incident, Infinity Blade, etc. \n\n*Other apps differentiate between the two versions, usually a normal version and what many call an HD version. Since this is a different app, they usually are priced differently and can not be updated between versions. An example would be Flight Control or Angry Birds, both have a different iPhone and iPad app, where you would have to buy both.\nThere is no way currently to upgrade to the better version for a discount between devices. So to answer your question, you would have to rebuy anything you want on your iPad (that's specifically made for iPad) that wasn't provided for free from the developer in an upgrade to the app (where the developer made the app universal with an update).\n", "Q: Cheapest option for split screen video editing? I'm wondering what the cheapest option for achieving a split-screen effect with different video clips is. This is on new iMac hardware with the latest version of iMovie '11, as well as QuickTime Pro 7 and iMovie HD '06 installed. Obviously I know Final Cut Express can do this, but I am hoping not to have to pay so much for what should be a simple thing.\nEdit:\nOkay, my first bounty. Fun times. Here's what I know: http://imovieplugins.com/ has some very cost-effective one-off effects for iMovie HD. However, it seems quite difficult to install these on 10.6. If anyone has a way to do so, I'd consider that a good answer.\nAlso, I am aware that the open-source Blender can do this, though the learning curve there is a bit much for me. An easy step-by-step guide for that would suffice if nothing else comes up.\n\nA: The cheapest option is to use quartz composer to assemble the individual clips and mix them down. It is not designed like iMovie or Final Cut Express with shortcuts and ready build transitions, but it is free with Xcode 3. You have to register and agree to Apple's developer tools restrictions before downloading Xcode 3. You want the free program at the bottom of the page.\nA more expensive solution would be something like ScreenFlow where you could make several self contained movies and then play them back for recording on the screen. By arranging and synchronizing multiple quicktime windows on your desktop you could record what you see on your screen. I have seen amazing works that were recorded as a screen capture. It's also not ideal, but if you are good, you can do wonders. Quicktime has free screen recording as well, but ScreenFlow makes it easier to crop out parts of the screen, catch the audio and automate moves and edit.\nLastly, Final Cut Express is the best tool and it sells for under $200 US.  It is the same engine as Final Cut Pro, but lacks all the other tools like Motion and Color that assist in cinema quality effects and editing.\nOnly you can know your budget and how much your time is worth. Start free and only pay for software when your time is worth more to you than the cost of the tools.\n\nA: If you need this for just one project, why won't you download the 30 days trial version of Adobe Premiere?\n", "Q: Full Screen with Microsoft's Mac OS X RDP client? I have a MacBook Air and I'm using Microsoft's RDP client (Remote Cesktop client) for OS X to remote in to Windows machines.  Is there any way to get the client to use the full screen?  There seem to be no options for this in the menu bar on on the dock icon.\nIf not, are there any alternative RDP clients for Mac OSX that will allow me to go full screen? (I'm not really a VNC fan, in any of its forms)  It seems a shame to waste my screen real estate, especially since I am on only a 13\" screen.\n\nA: There's also Royal TSX, which is similar to CoRD but much more powerful. It is a commercial app, but provides a shareware version that allows you to manage up to 1 document, 10 connections and 10 credentials for free.\nIt also offers native OS X fullscreen mode and an extended fullscreen mode that minimized the UI down to only the tab bar being visible.\nCheck it out at: https://www.royalapplications.com/ts/mac\nDisclaimer: I'm the developer of the mentioned product.\n\nA: In more recent version of Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac, the combination is: Command-1 to switch between Window and Full Screen.\nIf you're trying to exit Full Screen, you can also hover your mouse at the top of the screen, it'll show up the menu as below.\n\n\nA: I think the best option here is to use Microsoft Remote Desktop. This is different than the Remote Desktop Client you mention. It has a orangish / red icon and can be found in the app store for free.\nDuring setup for the connection there is an option for resolution, have that selected to \"native\" and you should be able to take advantage of full screen. \nI have also found this very useful for connecting with dual monitor applications. \n\nA: Click View menu > Full Screen at the very top of the screen. Or press Command-2.\n\nA: For an alternative that does full screen, try CoRD.  http://cord.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: You can try Ericom Blaze, a software-based RDP acceleration and compression product that accelerates RDP performance by up to 10-25 times and delivers higher frame rates and reduces screen freezes and choppiness. \nEricom Blaze works with any standard RDP host, including VDI, Terminal Servers and remote physical machines.\nYou can read more about Blaze and download a free evaluation at:\nhttp://www.ericom.com/Blaze\nYou can also check out a demo of someone using Blaze to connect from a Mac to a Windows PC:\nhttp://ericomguy.blogspot.com/Blaze4Mac\n\nA: Control-2 will take you back and forth from full screen to windows mode when using Microsoft RDP on a mac.  You can also configure your RDP preferences but must exit and then log back into the RDP session for them to take effect.\n\nA: Before you type in the name of the Computer, select RDC > Preferences... (or Command + ,). This will turn on additional settings at login including a Display tab where you can change the Remote desktop size to full screen.\n\nA: RDP 8 is Command 1 for Full Screen, Command 2 for Scaling.\n\nA: For this remote desktop client for mac, in addition to the above preferences settings, changing the specific display settings for the current session helped it for me. \nClick on edit the current session (pencil icon) and then set it like below \n", "Q: iPhone 4 taking blurry pictures pictures taken on my iPhone4 recently became blurry. No software updates were performed, and not water damage exists. Even pictures taken with lots of light show some blur and look foggy.\nAnyone else had this problem? - What could be the possible reasons/solutions?\n\nA: Is there any chance some water vapour found its way into the phone / lens assembly?  Were you using it any place where condensation could have occurred inside the phone?  Radical temperate / humidity changes?  I've never seen this, but I guess it could be possible.  I remember folks experiencing this with first generation iPhones.\nAre the foggy bits always in the same place in the photo?\n\nA: A thick skin or cover causes the foggy effect with the flash.  You can force the effect by holding several fingers above the flash and lens and take a photo.  Reflecting light from the flash can cause the problem.\n", "Q: Is there a way to turn on indicator that a directory item is a shell script in Terminal? When I do an ls of a directory and a shell script is listed as a directory item, is there a way I can have a visual indication that it is a shell script ?\nFor example:\nFrom /opt/local/bin \nls -l\n\nDisplays port from MacPorts as an ordinary item:\nport\n\nCan I have color coding, bold or some other way to see this ?  I know I can use file to check if it's a script, executable, etc., but that's an extra command I have to issue and is no better than trying to run port and then getting an error and typing ./port.\nThanks!\nScott\n\nA: Try typing ls -G in terminal, you should see colored listings by file type.  If the scripts aren't being shown in a different color, this means that they are not marked as executable, so you will need to type sudo chmod +x <filename> to make them so.  Then they should appear in a different color as opposed to directorys etc.\nIf you prefer not to always type ls -G then you can put the following command in your .bashrc file in your home directory  alias \"ls\"=\"ls -G\"  Then restart terminal and you should see colored output whenever you just type ls\n\nA: You can set this in your ~/.bash_profile file to enable colors equivalent to ls -G:\n#!/bin/sh\nexport CLICOLOR=1\n\n\nA: As I’m not a fan of colours — they depend on the current terminal colour settings to look good — I prefer to use ls -F.\nBorrowing from SCO Unix, I define an lf alias in ~/.bashrc:\nalias lf=\"ls -F\"\n\nExecutable files such as shell scripts show up with a * at the end of their names. Similarly, / for directories and @ for symbolic links.\n", "Q: Program to delay audio output I have a video that has audio several seconds in front of what it should be. I'm looking for an independent program that will delay the sound output. Is such a thing possible and more importantly is it free?\n\nA: Yes, You can use VLC. You can adjust the audio during video playback. Perfect for when you have sync issues. \nWith the most recent version of VLC (Version 1.1.9) the keys to adjust the audio during playback are: \ng - Audio delay up \nf - Audio delay down \n", "Q: Is it ok to set the MacBook Pro to never sleep when plugged in? I'm having some issues with my remote desktop software and the Wake-on-LAN feature.\nOn that note, is it ok to set the MacBook Pro (17\" 2009 unibody) to never sleep when plugged in?\nAm I somehow shortening the lifespan of the Mac by doing this?\nI'll probably be doing this 9 to 5 as it were while at work during the week.\nAll other energy settings are default including all on battery settings and the hard disk and screen off settings for plugged in.\nCheers\n\nA: You can leave your MacBook Pro running when plugged into an external power source. This should not dramatically reduce the life span of your computer.\nBe sure to allow the display to sleep after idle time. Leaving a typical display powered on constantly can reduce the life span and cause problems.\nWhen your Mac is not plugged in, try and follow Apple's notebook battery advice. Apple recommend running down your MacBook Pro's battery once a month or so. This will help maximise the battery's life.\n", "Q: Automator or AppleScript Rename Workflow Is it possible to automate the following action:\nExample\nFolder name: \"TEST\" the name of the file inside the folder is: \"Evelyn.jpg\".\nHow do I rename the folder using the name of the file inside of it:\nResult\nFolder name: \"EVELYN\" the name of the file inside the folder is: \"Evelyn.jpg\".\nAny ideas how to achieve this with Automator or AppleScript?\n\nA: Here's a script:\nset thefolder to \"path:to:folder\" as alias\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set filename to name of first item of folder thefolder\n    set oldDels to AppleScript's text item delimiters as string\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \".\" as string\n    set itemname to first text item of filename\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDels as string\n    set name of thefolder to itemname\nend tell\n\nIt gets the name of the first item in the folder, clips off the extension, and renames the folder.\nNote that it doesn't convert to uppercase as in your example.

To simplify things I was wanting to set it up so that all ipads could sync to the same PC. \nIs this a legal issue with syncing purchased apps to more than one ipad? Would I need to purchase apps x 20? (Music won't be used on these)\nDoes iTunes have anything built into it to help with this? I'm thinking this has to come up often. Schools purchase iOS devices and want them to be identical.\nAny other issues I should know/think about? \nThank you.\n\nA: There are no legal issues in syncing purchased apps to more than one iPad as long as you are the owner, which in this case is the school. All you will need to do is to verify in each iPad your iTunes account so that you can sync the apps to each iPad. It has to be same account on all the iPads.\n\nA: I agree with Thiago that this shouldn't be a legal issue.  If you have 20 iPads and want to sync them all to one computer, you might want to consider looking into getting a cart or cabinet that syncs and charges all of them automatically.  If you're interested there's more info available at www.ipadcart.info\n\nA: Thiago and SKL are right - there is no legal problem in purchasing an app once and syncing it on all of your iPads.\nThere is one app, that should be helpful - iPhone Configuration Utility. It will help you deploy and manage your configuration across devices. Also a great resource is the iOS enterprise support page - it's full of documentation, that should be useful in your scenario.\n", "Q: Crop multiple pages in a pdf file I can use Preview app to select a region and crop a page.

From time to time I need to edit some text in a text box on my iPad. One example is adding a bookmarklet to Safari; many techniques suggest you add a bookmark then edit it afterward. Clumsy, but it works.\nHowever, I often struggle to edit the text, and I wonder if I'm just missing something really basic. In the case I just had, I needed to remove a few characters from the beginning of a long bookmark. On my PC I would hit Home and then Delete a few times. I'm sure the Mac is similar.\nI can't figure out a non-clumsy way to do this on my iPad. The only way to even navigate in a text field (I.e. move the cursor) seems to be to select text and then move the selection box left; that seems clumsy at best as the select point is often lost. This is especially difficult when there's a long block of text in a short edit box but even in a full-screen editor cursor placement often seems approximate at best.\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: Touch and hold your finger over the word in the spot after you want to delete.  A magnifying glass will show you the exact position of the cursor.  Once you have the cursor in the right place you can then backspace over the text you want to delete.\n", "Q: Delete songs from iPhone but keep in iPod I want to delete songs from iPhone but keep in iPod in iTunes. when uncheck songs from library, this erase from both devices. Is there a way to remove all the songs just from iPhone?\n\nA: Create two separate playlist, one for the iphone and one for the ipod.  Drag in the songs you want for each playlist and then just sync these playlists to the appropriate device.\n", "Q: How to disable Acrobat Reader in Safari? In Safari, the default PDF-Viewer in Safari is \"Preview\". \nUnfortunately, since I installed the Acrobat Reader, this default changed to the Acrobat Reader, which is extremely annoying.\nHow can I change this back to \"Preview\"?\n\nA: A thread on macworld covers this. Should work by either by removing the plugin from the internet plugins folder or by changing the settings in the Adobe Reader preferences. The plugin is pretty annoying, I never installed the Adobe Reader again.\n\nA: Go to the \"Help\" menu in Safari and select \"Installed Plug-ins\". This will open a new tab displaying information about all of the currently installed plug-ins. Find the entry for Adobe Acrobat. Below it will be a line that reads something like:\nAdobe® Acrobat® Plug-in for Web Browsers — from file “AdobePDFViewer.plugin”.\n\nNote the name of the file from that line.\nOn your hard drive you will find a Library folder.  In that folder will be another folder called Internet Plug-Ins. Inside that folder you should find the file that was shown in the \"Installed Plug-ins\" tab. The full path should be /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/AdobePDFViewer.plugin. That file needs to be deleted.  Dragging it to the trash will do the trick. \nIf you are not sure you want to delete the file, you can move it to another location. For instance, you could create a new folder named \"Disabled Plug-Ins\" in the \"Installed Plug-Ins\" folder, and move the file to the new folder.\nThen quit & relaunch Safari.\nAdobe acknowledges this is a \"known issue\" and recommends this procedure.\n\nA: The following solution below works well (for me) but misses a few steps. Here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Safari\n\n*Find both the AdobePDFViewerNPAPI.plugin and the AdobePDFViewer.plugin files in \"Library/Internet Plug-Ins\"\n\n*Copy both files to your desktop (you might be prompted for the admin password) -- leave this folder open as well\n\n*Right-click on one of the files (doesn't matter which one you do first) and select \"Show Contents\"\n\n*Make the edit as per below to the Info.plist file\n\n*Repeat steps 3 & 4 for the other file\n\n*Copy both of the .plugin files back to the original folder (you might be prompted for the admin password)\n\n*Start Safari\n\n\nOriginal content is below:\nThe other answers completely remove acrobat reader. While I dislike acrobat reader, it is simply the only choice when there are PDFs with acrobat forms which preview is not great at handling. So a better approach could be to retain the plugin for the PDFs with forms (which has a separate mime type) and open our simple PDFs with preview.\nTo do this, open the file: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/AdobePDFViewerNPAPI.plugin/Contents/Info.plist and remove the following block of code:\n    <key>application/pdf</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>WebPluginExtensions</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>pdf</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>WebPluginTypeDescription</key>\n        <string>Acrobat Portable Document Format</string>\n    </dict>\n\nRemoving this will un-register acrobat reader plugin from being utilized for simple PDFs while Acrobat reader will continue to open the PDFs with other form data.\n\nA: The solution is found on Adobe's help site:\nPlace AdobePDFViewer.plugin and AdobePDFViewerNPAPI.plugin in a new folder.\n\nA: the best solution is just to put Acrobat Reader in the trashcan. It's 400 Mb of recovered space on my HD\n", "Q: HTML5/CSS3 text editor for OS X? I am looking for a text editor that supports HTML5 and CSS3, allowing you to add/edit new properties, like rounded corners and so.\nIt doesn't have to be a visual editor but it has to have support for CSS3 and other new stuff like rounded corners.\n\nA: There are two all-in-one solutions specialised for web development: Coda from Panic and Espresso from MacRabbit. Both have their pros and cons, just try them out and see which fits better for your needs. Hype is going through the news recently, but is more tool to create interactive and flashy HTML5 sites (as far as I understood it).\n\nA: I use Espresso on a daily basis. You'll need to the HTML5 sugar and the CSS3 sugar to get the code completion. \nEspresso also have a preview functionality that helps a lot in developing a page with minute differences.\n\nA: If you have Textmate, there's are CSS3 bundles available.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://code.google.com/p/webkit-css3-bundle/\n\nA bundle of advanced CSS3 features supported by Apple's open source Webkit and Safari browsers. These features are primarily limited to those prefixed with -webkit.\n\n\n*http://zeroedandnoughted.com/css3-textmate-bundle/\n\nI’ve combined the previous CSS3 TextMate Snippets into a bundle, which was a lot easier to do than I thought it would be. I’ll detail how to make your own in a future post.\n\n\nA: Please use \"Visual Studio Code\". This is simple to use and you can switch from mac to windows and vice-versa without problem. There is a lot of extensions to write code without error and faster. Many tutorials and projects are coded on Visual Studio Code. Many firm use it. \n\nA: For HTML5 there's a new App, called Hype which seems to be very interesting (see the videos). \nFor CSS Specific stuff, I had great success with CSSEdit from MacRabbit, but I'm not a graphic designer so my success is very limited in that area :)\n", "Q: Rsync Backup Script I'm having some issues backing up some data.\nBasically, I have FileVault enabled on my Macbook Pro and want to backup a folder I use - however, I don't want to use Time Machine (at work, I have one plug and I have to hot desk, meaning a large external is out) and the backup will never leave the site (I want to plug it in, backup and then drop back into my locked drawers). Data is currently about 1.5GB in total size made up of ~50MB files. Importantly, I need versioning and cannot use an off-site storage for this data.\nI was trying the following code (which is slightly modified from a Linux script I have).\n#/bin/sh\n\n#Backs up Work Data\n\n#Rotate backups\nrm -rf /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/5\nmv /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/4 /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/5\nmv /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/3 /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/4\nmv /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/2 /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/3\nmv /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/1 /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/2\ncp -aL /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/Store /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/1\n\n#Backup Command\nrsync -rtDv --delete /Users/xxxx/Work\\ Data /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/Store\n\nAnyhow, the script fails to run nice - running the rsync command works but then the move fails and no symbolic links are created. Drive is formatted in Mac OS Extended.\nEDIT: The creation of symbolic links and mv commands seem to be where it fails as it copies the data to the Documents/Store folder fine.\nCan anyone help? Or recommend a program that will backup and keep a version?\n\nA: When using rsync there's an important distinction between paths with a terminating / and paths without. Try changing:\nrsync -rtDv --delete /Users/xxxx/Work\\ Data /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/Store\n\nto\nrsync -rtDv --delete /Users/xxxx/Work\\ Data/ /Volumes/DOCSBACKUP/Documents/Store/\n\n\nA: I totally overlooked the fact that rdiff-backup works on the Mac using Macports.\nTherefore all sorted by using that.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 camera - how does the HDR mode work? I recently got an iPhone 4. When I turn on HDR on my camera and take a picture, it takes 2 pictures, both of which look grainy.\nOne appears brighter than the other but I don't \"see\" any other difference.\nAny idea why this happens or is this how it is supposed to be?\nThanks.\n\nA: Here is an article that provides a really good run down on what HDR is and how it performs on the iPhone.\nBasically it takes three photos at various exposure levels and combines them.  So you get a \"normal\" photo at regular exposure levels and the HDR version (1 photo composed of the three).   Results vary depending on light conditions etc.  I've had some really great results and some shockers.   \n", "Q: Can I force my computer to use a specific route to the Internet? Here's my setup: both me and my roommate have an Ethernet plug in our rooms to which is assigned a distinct public IP address. Also, my roommate bought a shiny wireless router for his/our various Internet-enabled devices, to which my Mac is connected (because his computer is connected on it, and it's sometimes useful to be on the same subnet).\nHowever, our connections are metered separately and I would find it unfair to make all of my computer's trafic go through the wireless network, and thus, his connection instead of mine. I recall that when I was living at my parent's place, AirPort used to take priority over Ethernet when I was connected to the same router with both. Now it doesn't seem to be the case, but I'm still not sure how my computer decides which network interface it'll use to reach the Internet if they're all connected to it.\nIs there a way to force my computer to use my Ethernet connection for everything Internet, only if an Ethernet cable is plugged in?\n\nA: You may use the \"service order\" functionality of Network pref pane.\nGo to System Preferences > Network > Click on the gear bellow the network list > Set Service Order...\nThere you may choose the order of which the networks will be used.\n", "Q: Looking for a lightweight MP3 player for OS X I'm looking for something, preferably free, to play MP3s in OS X in a way they don't automatically get dumped into iTunes. Any suggestions?\nSongbird is not lightweight.\nVLC I use for videos.\n\nA: Quicktime player. Quicktime player.\n\nA: This probably isn't what you're looking for, but it so happens that the very lightest of lightweight music players is preinstalled on every Mac. No, it's not QuickTime, and it's not QuickLook—you already knew about those, and they're not as lightweight. We can do better.\nOpen a Terminal and type:\n\nafplay path/to/song.mp3\n\nYour music will begin playing. No, there's no UI—you said you wanted something lightweight, didn't you?\nTo stop the song, press ^C.\nTo pause, press ^Z, then resume with the terminal command fg.\nIf you want playlists, you can do that too:\n\nafplay song1.mp3 && afplay song2.mp3 && afplay song3.mp3\n\nEnjoy listening to music with the satisfaction that none of your precious processing power is being wasted on modern extravagances.\n\nA: I've been looking for the perfect lightweight OSX player for a long time and still stick with Cog\nChange the update feed to Nightly in the preferences and you'll get 0.08 that runs in High Sierra and lower.\nUPDATE: An active fork is now available at https://kode54.net/cog (thanks OleGG for the mentioning it)\n\nA: I usually default to using VLC but it has one annoying (to me) limitation: playlists do not persist when you close the app. (At least, I can't find a way of overcoming this in the preferences.) I have used Cog, but after recent updates of OS X (I'm now on Mojave) it seems very flakey. So....\nPine Player\nAfter a bit of a search, I've now found Pine Player (\"Price: Free\") which is also available in the App store. It has some other nice features, too, but is a fairly simple player and so lacks some features that users might like to have (e.g., I don't think it varies speed of playback). But it is a nicely implemented audio player with \"persistent\" playlists, and that's exactly what I'm looking for. Works well for me!\n\n\nA: If you prefer a dedicated app rather than use Quick Look, check Vox, the lightweight music app for Mac OS X.\nIt's free but you can donate.\n\nA: On Finder, click the mp3, press space or ^+Y.\nIt will open a Quick Look window and that will preview your mp3.\n\nA: SimpleSong seems to be exactly what you are searching for - this is as simple as it gets, basically just a searchbar. You can now also drag tracks from the finder to the dock icon, to open the tracks as a playlist. \n", "Q: How does one make screen captures with a shadow? How to do beautiful print screens, with shadows on the border, like this image?\n\nIs the shadows automatic? A Mac tool? Do I need to manipulate the image in other programs like Adobe Photoshop?\n\nA: No, you do not need to. This feature is built into Mac OS X.\nTo do this, press ⌘+Shift+4 then press Space. The selector will then change into a camera icon, and you can take a screenshot of the selected window with a shadow.\n\n(I couldn't capture the camera icon)\nEnd result:\n\n\nA: Actually I prefer NOT to capture with the shadow at all. There is a command line procedure for suppressing the shadows, but you can accomplish the same thing through the GUI of TinkerTool.\n\nInstall TinkerTool and then under its \"General\" tab, un-check the box next to \"Include shadow when capturing window\".\n\nA: The shadows aren't automatic.  There is a free tool called ImageShadowAdder that can do these for you.   \n", "Q: Suppress vibrate when docked? When I dock my iPhone in the charger (desk stand), it briefly chimes to say it's charging. If it's on silent, then it vibrates instead of chiming. When I go to bed and put the phone in the bedside charger, the noise from either is very annoying.\nI want to suppress the vibrate-on-charge. How can I do that? \nIt's already jailbroken so suggestions in that genre are fine too.\n\nA: The only way I've found to deal with this on a non-jailbroken phone is to set the side switch to the non-silent setting, plug in headphones and then dock the phone. The chime sound will only play through the headphones and the phone will not vibrate.\n\nA: For the vibration:\nSince you jailbroken your iPhone already, use Silent Charge.\nFirst, open Cydia and go to Manage>Sources>Edit>Add. Add the ModYouri repo (http://repo.modyouri.com) and select Add Source:\n\nAfter adding, browse through the repo and find the Silent Charge package and install it.\n\nAfter installing the package, Cydia will ask you to reboot. Reboot, and viola~! No charge vibration! If you want the vibration back, uninstall the package.\n\nFor the sound:\nInstall WinterBoard and Silent Charge Classic (you can get it from the ModMyi repo). After installing both, launch WinterBoard and select Silent Charge Classic, and respring. Your iPhone should not make any sound after installation.\n\nA: I found that PowerSoundDisabler  is most up to date and solves all this: http://www.ijailbreak.com/cydia/powersounddisabler-cydia-tweak/\n", "Q: Prevent maximum screen brightness in lockscreen? I've set my screen brightness to about 50%. This works fine for me, except that the setting seems to be ignored while displaying the lockscreen while being charged: then it's 100%. I've got a desktop charging stand on my bedside table, and this is exactly the place where I don't need maximum brightness!\nHow can I make my iPhone respect the brightness setting even when locked and charging?\nThis is an iPhone 4 with iOS 4.2.1. In an earlier question, I asked about the brightness while charging - but this question is specifically about the lockscreen brightness.\nIt's already jailbroken so suggestions in that genre are fine too.\nUpdate:\nThe auto-brightness setting is ON because I like that it dims at night but goes bright during the day; I have tried it OFF but I had to adjust the brightness manually too often during every day. I'm not aware of any jailbreak-specific setting regarding brightness.\n\nA: iOS 4 and 5 were notorious for having this issue. They frequently ignored the ambient light sensor and were so stubborn, they refused to adjust the screen brightness to compensate. iOS 6 has corrected this issue.\n", "Q: What is the release schedule for the next Mac Pro (desktop)? I work on many projects at once and my MacBook Pro is not cutting it anymore. I will be purchasing a Mac Pro (desktop) soon, but want to make sure a new model is not on the verge of coming out. Does anyone know the release schedule for the next Mac Pro?\nThanks, Chirag\n\nA: I would wait.

I have:\nan iPod with an Apple Composite (RCA Red/White/Yellow) cable\nI want to connect this with a TV that has:\n\n\n*\n\n*Component in (Red/Blue/Green/Chartreuse - there's a bunch of them)\n\n*DVI in\n\n*HDMI in\n\n*VGA in\n\n\nGiven this setup, what is the least expensive/least painless way for me to hook my iPod up to this TV (if I can get this done with a simple trip to Radio Shack this evening, that is ideal [and no, nowhere around me has the iPod Component AV Cable :(])\n\nA: For now, you can plug the composite cable into the component input, plugging the yellow video cable into the green (Y/brightness) input and the audio in normally. This will work as you expect, except the video will be in black and white.\nA better solution would be to just get the Apple Component output cable and use that. Unless it's a 4th gen iPod touch, you won't be able to get VGA out and no iPod released to date will output DVI or HDMI. (Though the 5th gen touch should output HDMI since the 2nd gen iPad does now, but that's speculation.)\n", "Q: VPN connection in OSX fails after a certain amount of reconnects When using a a IPSec VPN in OSX, I'm getting prompted to re-enter my password every ~45 minutes. After a certain amount of re-connects, no further connection will succeed. I have to restart the laptop by then, which means a restart a day.\nIs there a way to reset the IPSec cache etc, so that I don't have to restart?\nOSX, latest version, using www.witopia.net as provider.\n\nA: This is actually a bug in Mac OS X, all Cisco IPSec connections have a timeout (hard limit of the lifetime) of 3600 second (60 minutes) because of the soft and hard limit of IPSec connections it is most of the time around 45 to 50 minutes.\nYou can check the files (with an active IPSec connection) in \n/var/run/racoon/\n\nfor the limits.

If you'd like that kind of functionality you might want to use an alternative chat client like adium\n", "Q: iPod doesnt show songs, iTunes and Explorer does I have a black iPod Classic 160GB. I use iTunes on Windows 7 to sync songs. I can see the songs that are synced with the iPod, iniTunes. However, after ejecting, the iPod shows 0 songs. Going to settings show the decreased free space. Opening up My Computer, and I can see the songs in the ipod_control\\Music folder. I have also set the songs to not be a part of a compilation, as suggested in this question. However, I have been unsuccessful in getting the iPod to show the songs. I am tired after fiddling with it since 2 days now. What gives?\n\nA: First, remove all songs from the device (from within iTunes) and then try re-adding them. If that fails to have any effect, remove all songs, unplug the iPod, re-plug, and add a few back. (Don't bother checking for songs in Explorer; that's not going to help.)\nIf that doesn't work, back up any data that has made it to your iPod and restore the firmware in iTunes. Then try to add a single song and see if that works. (Add a playlist with one song, then try dragging one over manually, if you prefer that setting.)\nComment on what worked or didn't: if nothing works, I'll come up with more things to try.\n", "Q: How can I prevent Opera from closing the window if the last tab gets closed? I've set Opera to allow empty workspace which should not close the window when the last tab is closed. As closing the window in MacOS doesn't close the application, as does in Windows, maybe this configuration is ignored in MacOS, is it?\n\nA: This sadly seems to be not available on OSX. You can work around it by pinning a speed dial tab: \n\nAs this is not closable via Cmd-W, it will prevent Opera from closing the window on the last tab. I use this for full screen browsing.\n", "Q: Transmission frequently locks up when writing to Samba share at more than 3MB/s For every torrent I download, I set its destination to my fileserver, which my Mac is connected to via Samba. When download speeds are higher than about 3 megabytes a second, Transmission will lock up (beach ball) for 10-15 seconds, work for about 10-15 seconds and then repeat.\nMoving the data files to the local OS X drive completely eliminates this behavior, even at speeds above 5 MB/s. Finder doesn't seem to have any problem writing to the share at speeds even higher than that.\nI posted on the Transmission forums that, when saving to the Samba share, I would constantly see \"Prefetch failed, Operation not supported\" debug messages in the Transmission log; literally hundreds of them every second for every torrent being downloaded. I suspect this has at least something to do with it, but haven't gotten a response on their forums.\nOther than \"Just save stuff on your local disk then, dummy\", is there anything I should try?\n\nA: *\n\n*Download latest version of Transmission\n\n*Still having trouble, then limit the DL speed to 2.8MB/sec\n\n\nI find that when I use Transmission at speeds less than 3.0MB/sec, I tend to not have the problems with a SAMBA share that you are having.\nIt writes to the disk in a different manner than what a direct connection does. Torrents create an empty file(s) that represent the downloadable content. Then they write to this file. Direct connection sends a request for the allocated space to the share/server and sees if it is available. If yes, it proceeds to start filling in the gap with the data until the transmission is complete and the end of file is written to the file system.\nIf you want an alternative option, create the download, add it to Transmission, but pause the download for a few minutes - THEN start the download as per normal. That way it should have enough time to write the inflated empty file first, and then start writing the data into it.\n\nA: Just to make sure of a couple of things. When you say \"which my Mac is connected to via Samba\" do you mean that your file server is a Unix/Linux box running Samba or do you mean that your Mac is connecting to a Windows server using SMB?\nThe Mac since OS X 10.7 has not used Samba as either server or client but replaced it with an Apple implementation of SMB. So unless you are using 10.6 or earlier then you are not connected using Samba on the Mac.\nBack to your problem. Almost certainly the problem is on the server side, I would have a careful look at the server software logs and perhaps turn the log level up for a couple of hours while you run some tests. If you are running Samba then I'd carefully tune it to see if you can configure your way out of the problem.\n", "Q: How to import Apple Mail accounts? I'm copying the old Mail folder over a fresh OS install.\nI Copied over ~/Library/Mail & ~/Library/Application Support/Mail\nMails and mailboxes imported all right ( even better results than using Import Mailboxes menu option )\nBut the accounts didn't import. Where are they stored?\n\nA: Account data should all be in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist.\n\nA: Newtron's advice is spot on. For some account types, you will find that you'll need to import the appropriate keychain entries as well.\n", "Q: Powering on while the lid is closed in clamshell mode For a recent MacBook Pro, lid closed, non-Apple keyboard: can I map some key (like F15) to be the same as the Apple power key so I can do a full shutdown and start up without opening the lid?\n\nA: Launchers like Alfred.app allow you to assign keyboard shortcuts to run commands (it has built in ones for restart and shut down).\nThere is a default shortcut alt+cmd+eject for putting the computer to sleep.\nAdditionally, control+alt+eject will log you out, and;\nshift+control+eject will sleep your displays (and keyboard lights if you have them).\nAs for booting the computer without using the power button, I'm not sure that's possible, as I don't think the laptop gives power to the keyboard while it's powered off. \nYou could setup something like scheduled startup/shutdown, to automatically boot at the set time. Find this in the Energy Saver preference pane.\nUpdate: Newer laptops don't have an eject button, but instead the button in the top right corner of the keyboard is the power button. The above shortcuts will work with the power button i.e. shift+control+power for turning off the displays.\n\nA: I do not believe this is possible.\nYou can schedule your Mac to power on automatically using Energy Saver or our Power Manager software. This requires setting specific times for starting up and shutting down.\nIf the lid is closed, your Mac should start up on schedule. It will then immediately go into sleep mode because the lid is closed. This appears to be a deliberate design choice by Apple's engineers to avoid overheating your Mac.\nTo run with the lid closed, you must start up with lid open and have an external display connected. Only with an external display connected can you close your MacBook Pro's lid and avoid automatic sleep; doing anything else is not supported by Apple.\nThe exact behaviour you will see also depends on which MacBook Pro you have. Power features and capabilities tend to change between hardware revisions.\n", "Q: Are there any limitations when using AirPort Express in a Windows environment? I have 3 Windows laptops on my home network connected via a wireless router.  I have been through three wireless routers in six months and have found them to all be poor quality. They inevitably flake out and drop connections (even though I live in a 600 square foot basement suite).\nI am willing to shell out the cash for whatever wireless router will be bulletproof. I have heard good things about Airport Extreme. I am a very technical person as I am a Java developer for a living, is Airport Extreme right for me?\nI will not have a Mac on my network in the foreseable future so all administration of the router will have to be done on my Windows Vista (32 bit) machine or one of the Windows 7 machines (x64).\n\nA: Apple offers the software AirPort Utility for Windows, which is required to configure the router (there's no web-interface). Apart from that there are no limitations to Windows machines. However, I have no idea how good the software for Windows is. On the Mac it's great and easy to use, as you'd expect.\nAs you say you're a technical person: the AirPort itself doesn't offer many options, it just runs (since more than 3 years for me now, without problems). So if you plan to put linux on the router and do some crazy firewall, natting, whatever that is more than standard, it's definitely nothing for you. It's not a toy.\n", "Q: CNET on Mac - page not found I've been having this problem for some time now - first I thought it was some temporary thing with CNET servers, but it doesn't seem so.\nI can see the index pages of CNET sites (download.cnet.com, news.cnet.com), but when I delve deeper by clicking some application link on download.cnet.com or get direct link to some news from Twitter, I get error 'page not found' as seen on the image:\n\nIt seems that all links that point to CNET URLs having .html in them yield errors constantly. Other pages (e.g Mac software etc) are mostly OK (at least for the first click, but repeatedly refreshing gets me few random errors too)\nThis happens with all my browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera), whereas it does not happen with IE 8 running on Win 7 inside a VirtualBox on the same Mac, so it is not related to my network, but with my Mac borwsers somehow or Mac OS X.\nBTW, all other websites are totally OK and this is only related to *.cnet.com sites. I have extensions and add-ons in Safari, Chrome and Firefox, but Opera is vanilla as I only use it for testing purposes, so could not be caused by some extension.\nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X 10.6.7\n\n*MacBook Pro 6,2\n\n*Safari 5.0.5\n\n*Chrome 11.0\n\n*Firefox 4.0.1\n\n*Opera 11.10\n\n\nA: Possible solution: changing first preferred language in browser.\nIt might fix the problem if you choose English as you first preferred language in browser settings. When requesting a page, browsers sends list of preferred languages for content. (For example, based on these settings Google redirects you to your local Google site.)\nChanging preferred language:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox 5: Tools->Options->Content->Languages.\n\n*Chrome: wrench-icon->Options->Under the Hood->Web Content->Languages and spell-checker settings  (instructions)\n\n\n\nIt might be working on your virtual machine if default Windows (in VM) language was set to English. Then browsers would also choose English as your default content language.\n\nWhen my default language was set to English or German I had no problems navigating cnet sites. After setting my first preferred language to Lithuanian I was getting same errors as you.\nIt appears that this is internal cnet bug.\nTested on Windows XP Firefox 5, Chrome.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make Adium open links with Google Chrome? When someone sends me a link in Adium I'll click it and Safari will open up. I'd like links to be opened by Google Chrome instead.\nI've had a look around the web and in the preferences but for the the life of me I can't figure this simple one out.\nAny clues?\nNB: My default browser is Google Chrome.\nEDIT\nI'm running version 1.4.1 (i.e. up-to-date). I use this SkypePlugin. Apart from that it's plain vanilla Adium.\n\nA: Try to disable the Skype plugin, it must be tempering with the way Adium handles URLs opening.\n", "Q: Can the verizon iPad update to ios 4.3? I had an email from Apple the other day saying \n\"Our records indicate that one of your apps requires iOS 4.3 or later.\nCurrently, iPhone users on the Verizon network are not able to upgrade\nto iOS 4.3 and are unable to find any apps requiring iOS 4.3 or later\non the App Store. Unless your app is using iOS 4.3 functionality, such\nas AirPlay, we recommend changing the iOS Deployment Target build\nsetting of your app to an earlier version of iOS.\"\nI don't have any iPhone apps on my account that require 4.3 , I do however have an iPad app on the store that requires 4.3 . Could this just be a mistake? Can people who own a Verizon iPad download my 4.3 app?\n\nA: iPad 1 from Verizon was a normal iPad with a Verizon hotspot, and they can update to 4.3. According to Apples website, iPad 2 from Verizon (which now has a CDMA chip inside) can also update to 4.3. \nVerizon iPhones can not update to 4.3, and that may be what this is about. Verizon iPhones are still 4.2, and so therefore if you are targeting 4.3 - those verizon iPhone users can't use your application. Their email states that this is just Verizon iPhone users.\n", "Q: Can the iPad detect the shape of a contact on its screen? For example, could the iPad or iPhone accurately detect the difference between conductive pieces of plastic in the following shapes?\n\n\n\n\nA: A multitouch gesture recognizer can see when it's been touched in more than one discrete spot, and can understand the position of each of those touches. So that's \"shape-ish\". But no, there's no way to know a square versus an octagon is touching it.\n\nA: Edit\nWhile it's still unlikely that such shape detection is possible (that would be so cool for boardgames or D&D maps or whatever), Ten One Design has successfully used private APIs to determine the size of the touch (which they refer to as pressure detection). http://youtu.be/OgTcyjzXfTg?t=32s shows it in action.\n\nThe touchscreen likely isn't sufficiently sensitive; there's a lot of very clever math going on behind the scenes to make it seems as smooth as it is. The actual resolution is something like 1/16 of an inch.\nBut worse, as @Dan points out, it's not really detecting shapes that way, the signal is much more crude.\n\nA: The digitiser will track the number and location of touches, so if the shapes were distinguished by, say, conductive blobs on each apex then it should be possible to identify them individually. \n\nA: There is no public API in stock iOS for detecting the size of a touch.  \n", "Q: Make Solid-state scrolling trackpad behave like Multi-Touch trackpad I am using an early 2009 MacBook.\nIs there any way or any APP that can make Solid-state scrolling trackpad on my MacBook behave like Multi-Touch trackpad\nSolid-state scrolling trackpad supports two-finger scrolling, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities, while Multi-Touch trackpad supports inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities.\nCan gestures from Multi-Touch trackpad, be available to Solid-state scrolling trackpad?\n\nA: You could try with some software like Better Touch Tool, but that's not guarantied it will work, since it's more of a hardware limitation.\nAnother solution would be to buy a Magic Trackpad.\n\nA: Sadly, there is no way and no app to add this functionality. \nThe hardware simply wasn't designed to track two (or more) independent touches. You get two finger (wide contact point) scroll but that's it.\nYou would need to add more hardware like a video camera to see three fingers and analyze the movement optically (or add expensive circuitry and somehow hook into a free port like bluetooth, USB and add a kernel extension to get that added input to the Human Interface system.) It's more practical to find a buyer that wants your mac and put that money towards a mac with true multitouch hardware than to add multitouch capability after the fact.\n\nA: I recommend reading this article from TUAW. It basically says that the internal chipset on the new multi-touch trackpads is different to older trackpads and that is why out-of-the-box, Mac OS X Snow Leopard will not be able to add the gestures to your trackpad. \nHaving said that, the same article points you to this hack in MacRumors in case you feel a little adventurous and want to try and hack your OS to change how it works with your older trackpad. I cannot vouch for this method as my Mac already has a multi-touch trackpad so I have not used this hack. I also do not know of anybody who has used it. I am only pointing you in that direction in hopes that it is what you're looking for. \nIf there's a hack, there might just be a way. :) Good luck! \n\nA: I've experimented with a lot of hacks and apps for the trackpads to simulate the Magic Trackpad's gestures, but still avoid adding another accessory to carry around. Personally, I've found JiTouch to be wonderful in this respect: http://www.jitouch.com/\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Is Jailbreaking And Enabling Bluetooth File Transfer On iPhone 4 Financially Secure? I want to use iPhone 4 for sensitive information. Will jailbreaking, downloading unofficial apps (not registered in Apple's App Store) and enabling Bluetooth file transfer cause a chance of sensitive data theft? Can unofficial app turn out to be malware?\nIs sim free iPhone already jailbroken?\n\nA: \nWill jailbreaking, downloading unofficial apps (not registered in Apple's App Store) and enabling Bluetooth file transfer cause a chance of sensitive data theft? \n\nThere's a chance, but if you download from verified sources and check the repository you're going to be downloading from (google searches, etc.) you should be okay.  There's always a risk, but as with any risk, if you're vigilant about things you'll be fine.\n\nIs sim free iPhone already jailbroken?\n\nIf you're talking about an iPhone without the sim card, no, that doesn't mean that the phone is jailbroken already.  It just means it's the phone without the sim card.  iPhones have removable sim cards in them.\n\nA: Briefing\nJailbreaking is unofficial so no iphone comes jailbroken unless a individual have purposely installed it. If sim-free iphone is a factory unlocked one as you implied in a comment, there is no direct relation and it does not come jailbroken at all. And never will.\nAs Brad said, even official apps have a good chance to be malware. But, granted, \"unofficial\" ones do have higher chance.\nI'd say the biggest risk you have on jailbreaking, though, is leaving it open for some exploits. Two of the most common ones would be ssh root alpine and breaking through the lockcode.\nAnd with not jailbreaking the biggest risk you have is connecting on unsecure wifi.\nWith jailbreaking you have the possibility of arming yourself with more tools both for exposing and fixing security holes so it all depends on how savy you are.\nAdvice\nI would not use anything I don't deeply understand to store sensitive information, and it's not jailbreaking the main issue here. If you lose your iPhone, or someone steal it with the intent to steal information from it, you're basically screwed - specially if it's not jailbroken with heavy tweaks and customizations because it makes it all the easier to find exploits.\nThat's why Windows has so many malwares - because it's heavily used worldwide and most people will use it with default configurations - so it's way spread out with more people trying to break it and sharing information on how to do it.\nI hope you get the point.\n", "Q: Problem with iPhone LCD after repair I have repaired an iPhone with a 3GS glass. Then I realized it was for an iPhone 3G. So, after replacing it again with a proper 3G glass the LCD just went black! What have I done wrong?\n\nA: I had the same problem before, when I replaced a cracked iPhone screen for a friend. When a 3GS digitalizer gets in contact with an iPhone 3G LCD they send the wrong signals to the motherboard(through ribbon cable 3) and then the graphic part of the motherboard brokes. So you will probably have to replace the whole motherboard, be more careful when buying new glass next time, check the modelnumber first! \n", "Q: Why is my Macbook Pro 2011 video garbled after sleep? Occasionally when I open my new (April 2011) Macbook Pro I'm greeted by an unusable system with a garbled display.  Most often I have to force a reboot (hold down power button for 10+ seconds), but occasionally it will fix itself if I close the lid and re-open it.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the problem, or what should I look at to find the problem?\n\n*Are there other things I could try to wake this laptop from this state?\n\n*I can't reliably reproduce the problem, so it doesn't seem that taking it to the genius bar is going to yield useful results, but tell me if I'm making a bad assumption here and I should take it back.\n\n\n\nSystem info:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBookPro8,3\n\n*ATI Radeon HD 6750M\n\n*Intel HD Graphics 3000\n\n*If anything else is relevant, let me know and I'll post it.  It's a standard 17\" MBP, though I've added memory (notably this problem did occur prior to adding memory as well)\n\n\nA: It was bad memory.  I had upgraded to 8GB, but at some point suspected the memory for some other problem, so put the original Apple 4GB back in.  Both problems went away (tested for 3 months) so I ditched the 8GB and got 16GB of higher quality memory that more closely matched the timing specifications of the original Apple memory.\nSo far, after two months, I haven't seen this or the other issue yet.  So in this case it was bad (or wrong) memory.\n\nA: Definitely take it to an Apple Store if you have one close by. Even if you can't reproduce it right then and there, show them the photo above. It might be a hardware problem (loose connection, faulty graphics chip, etc.), so you'll want to get it looked at by a professional.\n\nA: I know that's an old post but i would like to share this [1] video I've just uploaded about an old Macbook Pro Late 2011 which is suffering same or similar glitch. While disassembling the screen I noticed touching a sensor on the display electronic board \"fixed\" the issue.  \nIn the video, what' i'm touching is the cable which connects the screen to the display logic board. So the issue seems to be in the wire or the socket which interconnects the screen to the display logic board located on the bottom of the screen.\nJust in case it helps someone to identify the issue.  \n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlmsRSH_Azk\n", "Q: Scrubbing chapters and not losing stop points on audiobooks on iPod nano \n*\n\n*Is there a way to scrub through a chapter on the 6th gen nano? I have only been able to scrub chapter to chapter which isn't useful when you become distracted and want to rewind 30 seconds.\n\n*Is there a way to not lose the stop point in the audiobook when you plug into the computer to recharge battery?  When I connect the nano to my computer to recharge (auto add etc. is all disabled) the place you stopped at is lost.\n\nA: If it works the same as an iPhone, on the headphone cable press the volume down button (-) 3 times in quick succession and hold it down on the 3rd press. This goes into a rewind mode that rewinds as long as you hold the button down.\nYou can go into a fast forward mode in a similar manner with 2 presses and hold down.\n", "Q: Share folder in VirtualBox Host=Mac OS, Guest=Debian how can I share a folder in VirtualBox between my host-OS Mac OS and my installed guest-OS Debian 6?

The receipt is in the original owner's name.\nThe new owner would like to purchase an AppleCare warranty for the machine in their name so there's no trouble in case they would ever need the warranty. \nIs this possible?\nIs it enough to simply purchase the AppleCare, fill in a form with the new owner's name, and thus connect it to the machine for warranty purposes?\nIs it necessary to purchase AppleCare in the first place? Here in the EU, there is a mandatory 2-year warranty anyway. I guess my broader question is how Apple deals with changes of ownership for their products. Would one have to expect any trouble when making use of the warranty if the owner's name has changed?\n\nA: I called Apple Support with just this question two years ago.  They seemed completely uninterested me showing that the machine had been properly transferred to me; my claim that I had it was good enough.  I bought AppleCare for a Macbook from Amazon.com and registered it with Apple received the final paperwork from them promptly, no further questions asked (this was in the US).\n(FWIW, I did get a receipt and acknowledgment of the transfer of ownership to me from the seller in case it should ever become necessary, such as in an insurance claim).\n", "Q: What features from a typical wireless router is Airport Extreme missing? Are there any features that Airport Extreme is missing that typical routers always have?\nFor example virtual servers, dmz?\n\nA: Have you seen the Technical Specifications for AirPort Extreme, that should cover most of the questions. There are no virtual servers and no DMZ, but IPv6, Port Mapping, Shared Disk/Over-the-Air-Time-Machine-Backup, Shared Printers, DHCP and NAT, some features are Mac-only, of course. Wireless 802.11n with various transmit power options. That's about it. As I said, no toy, but it works 100% reliable, even for techies.\n\nA: The main limitation is you get one VLAN and it's called the guest network. You don't get fancy VLAN, QOS traffic shaping or routing treatment of advanced routers like the cisco corporate line, but it's very full featured for a consumer or small business router.\n", "Q: How to automate execution locate.updatedb by using a bash script I am looking for a bash set of commands that will enable me to schedule the execution of /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb once every day.\nPlease respond only with a set of command line commands, because I want to include this in a \"setup\" script (in order to be able to reuse it when I go to another machine).\n\nA: After additional (re)search I found an easy solution:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist\nThis is also persistent, so it will run updatedb daily.\n", "Q: What cheap option is there to use a Mac to produce quality 'Videosongs'? Some of you must be familiar with Videosongs, like this:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uolz7V12evc\nThe idea is:\n\n\n*\n\n*What you see is what you hear. (No lip-syncing for instruments or voice)\n\n*If you hear it, at some point you see it. (No hidden sounds)\n\n\nI want to know how can I use my MacBook Pro to create videos like those. Which software do I need? Can I do it only using the pre-installed applications in my Mac? If no, then which cheap software do I need?\nI'm just a enthusiast so I know very little about producing music videos in a Mac.\nEdit 2011-05-27\nThe difficulty I see in this particular case is how to be able to merge multiple video/audio channels so they are all synchronized. Mixing the audio of course is something that must be done in a specific audio/track software but then I have to sync it back to several small videos and eventually repeat some of the videos. So my question is which software for Mac would be a better fit to accomplish that? Which one for audio and which for video? Can it be done only using GarageBand and iMovie?\n\nA: I can't see any difference to other home/amateur movies? What's so special about it? Have you tried iMovie? Comes with iLife, usually pre-installed on new Macs. Another option would be Final Cut, of course. But that takes some time to learn.\n\nA: I guess it depends more on your creativity than on the tools you use. You could do it all with your webcam using Photo Booth, in one take, but then you wouldn't be able to overlay multiple tracks and the audio/video quality would be bad.\nThe basic gist of it is: first you have to create a basic track, probably with some kind of metronome, so you can use it as a base for the instruments and vocals (note they always have headphones while recording, so they can listen to the base track). Then, for each instrument, set up a camera to capture the video and a quality microphone to record audio.\nYou can mix the audio together in GarageBand, and then sync the audio with the video you recorded at the same time using iMovie. It's a lot of work and can take a long time, but there's no \"secret\" to it.\nIf you want more \"pro\" tools you could use Logic Studio for audio and Final Cut for video. But for simple videos, I guess it would be overkill.\n\nA: Your best bet would be simply asking them how they do it, I bet you'll get better answers than here.\nBut I'll re-enforce the guessing already here with my own, because I've never did anything like it as well, but I do have some contact with musicians and studios from far.\nMy guess is: there isn't any simple solution as you request, though I'd like to see one too. And probably the easiest options are indeed adobe, final cut, garage band and imovie. As long as you record all with cameras that will have the same default format, it should be simple enough using just the later 2. The troublesome part as Rodrigo Sieiro said, would be syncing it with the audio if you can't record it at the same time already synced with the camera.\n", "Q: How do I erase old user and become the new user on a iBook G4 I just got from a friend? My friend gave me his iBook G4.\nI could not login because I did not know his password.\nI have the 2 DVD Mac OS Install disks of the laptop.\nAfter I installed these OS X Install discs, once again I was asked for the old user's password.\nHow do I do a complete wipe out and then reinstall the OS so I can become the new user? \n\nA: Dont hit 'continue' after putting in the Install OS disk, instead go to top-left screen where there is a menu with an option to change login password. \n\nA: If you don't happen to have an OS install disk lying around and don't know the other user's password, consider booting into single-user mode (hold down Command-S while booting (see this article)), running\nmount -rw /\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nreboot\n\nIt will reboot and go through the setup again. After it finishes, you'll be at a fresh adminstrative user account, and you can just trash their home folder.\n\nA: When installing the operating system make sure you do an erase and install via the 'options' button during the install. Otherwise all the data will still be there. \nAs you have a G4 I can assume the install discs are either Tiger (10.4) or Leopard (10.5)\nYou can find the installation options here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1545\nI think this is the cleanest way about completely resetting the machine. \n\nA: I had the same issue, and upon researching the possibilities I found one, and only one, that worked. Its actually very simple. Here goes -\n1. Boot up computer, holding down apple + s key after you hear the chime, then let go after you see apple image.\n2. When you get a flashing text prompt, enter the following 3 lines, making sure to press the  key after each entry - \n mount -uw /\n rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n shutdown -h now\n3.The computer will automatically shutdown, so you will have to press the power button again. But this time it will boot up like it did the first time it was purchased. You can now begin from scratch, entering your own information/ Be advised, however, setup will take some time.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro randomly restarting I'm new to daily Mac use, but I think I have my settings correct. My laptop is kept plugged in at work - never runs on battery. In my Energy Saver system prefs, I have Computer Sleep and Display Sleep set to Never on both Power Adapter and Battery, all options (hard disk sleep, wake for network access, reduce brightness, start up after power failure) are unchecked. There is nothing set up in the Schedule area to turn on or off at specific times. \nAt least twice a week, though, when I go to lunch (which is never at the same time) if I'm gone for more than an hour or so, when I come back the computer has restarted itself. Not gone to sleep, or shut down, but completely restarted.\nIs there a system log somewhere I could look at that would show me what was happening at the times the computer restarted? Or is there some other setting I'm missing that's making this happen? Although I try to remember to save all my work before I leave just in case, every so often I forget, and I'm getting sick of losing work (or even just losing system state and having to restart all my programs, reopen all my files, etc.)\nUPDATE\nI don't know if anyone is still following this; I'll post as a new question if I don't hear back in a few days. It's been restarting fairly regularly the past few weeks; I just haven't had time to check the console and figure things out.

General.\n\nA: You can try to find a clue in the system log.\nsudo less /var/log/system.log\n\n\nA: There is an EFI Firmware update that supposedly resolves this issue on some Macbook models. Click the Apple logo on the top left of your screen and scroll down to Software Update. If there is a firmware update for your Macbook, it will appear here. Download the update and follow the instructions - this should resolve the problem.\n\nA: Sorry to say, whenever any Mac laptop has done this—and they have, or used to, when I owned Powerbook G4's … it meant impending logic board (motherboard) failure.\n\nA: If the Mac is under Applecare, I would call them and give them a chance to fix it.\nIf it's not under Applecare, bring it to the Apple store.  You can book a Genius appointment at the Apple web site and they'll help you out.  It may be related to the \"running hot\" issue and they may have an advisory out to resolve your issue.\nI've had great success in dealing with the Genius people at the store and there's no downside to giving them a shot at it.\n", "Q: How to sort files entirely by date? Is there any way to sort all files in a particular directory by date, even ones in subfolders? For example:\ndrive root -> documents -> mysite -> dev\nDrive root contains a bunch of individual files, plus a folder called documents. Documents contains a bunch of files, plus a folder called mysite, and so on. What I want to see is just a list of files sorted by date, from all the folders, rather than having to open each folder separately and seeing only its files sorted by date.\nI have Cocoatech's Pathfinder installed, so if it isn't possible in the standard Finder, maybe there's some way to do it in PF?\n(If the folder tree were really as simple as my example, it wouldn't be an issue, but what I'm really looking at is a website's build directory, which contains about 5 levels of subdirectories, and I need to see all files sorted by date so that I can move whatever changed today (regardless of which folder it's in.)\n\nA: If you don't mind using the terminal you could try this:\nfind . -type f -exec ls -lth {} +\n\nThis will list files from current directory and all directories below, sorted by modified date. A variant not listing modification date would be:\nfind . -type f -exec ls -t {} +\n\nBut I believe that it would be better to just list the files that have changed the last 1440 minutes\nfind . -mmin -1440\n\n\nA: You could use spotlight to do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, select the folder that contains everything.\n\n*File -> Find or cmd+F\n\n*Now, you need to do some sort of search or else nothing will show up. Pick something that all relevant files will satisfy, for example \"Last modified date is within the last 100 years\"\n\n*If you aren't already doing so, view the results as a list (View -> as List or cmd+2)\n\n*If there is no header that says \"Date Modified\" you can get one by going to (View -> Show View options) and selecting it in the \"Show columns\" category.\n\n*Click the Date Modified column header to sort by this value.\n\n\nOne thing to consider:  Folders also show up in the list. Perhaps you can get around this by requiring size to be greater than 0.\nIf for some reason spotlight is not working for you, you could do use a python script, like this one:\n#! /usr/bin/python\n\nimport os, time\n\nfor path,dirs,files in os.walk(\"/path/to/folder\"):\n  for file in files:\n    fullname=path+\"/\"+file\n    mtime=os.stat(fullname).st_mtime \n    mtimestring=time.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\",time.localtime(mtime))\n    print \"\\\"\" + fullname + \"\\\",\" + mtimestring\n\nSave the output to a .csv file and use your favorite spreadsheet program to do the sorting. Or you could alter the script to do the sorting for you.\n", "Q: Multiple IP addresses for same host name in /private/etc/hosts? I have a corporate mail account (exchange 2007) that uses a self-signed SSL certificate.  No matter what I do, Mail always complains about this when I connect.  If I look at the details it always says the certificate name post does not match the dns name I used to connect.\nI had the bright idea to add an entry in /private/etc/hosts that mapped the name post to the external IP of the server.  This works beautifully and the certificate error is gone and everything works when I am out of the office.\nThe problem with this is that when I am in the office I need to access the server by its internal address, and the only way I could connect was to remove the line I added to hosts, or to change the IP from the external IP to the internal IP.\nNow for the question: Is there a way I can format multiple entries in the hosts file for the same host name, but with different addresses?  I know this is done with real dns servers, but it appears not to work in a hosts file.  The idea is for the name lookup to return both IP addresses and Mail will fail over to the second address when the first does not work.\nI know there is a setting in Mail for internal and external names for the server, but using this brings back the original certificate errors. After some thought, I also wondered what would happen if I make a second entry for the same name but using IPv6 instead of IPv4?  Should have IPv6 some time later this year, and if I understand correctly you can have one name listed twice in hosts when one address is IPv6.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the answer is no. The hosts file is a static lookup file, and because of this it has no concept of multiple-address per name failover, round-robin, or other features baked into the name resolver.\nYou can specify multiple names for a given IP address, but not multiple IP addresses mapping back to a single name.\nDare I ask, why can't you access the external interface of the mailserver while internal to your office? We configure all of our clients to use Mail/Jabber externally so they never run into this issue.\nDespite conventional wisdom, using the external interface when internally does not \"pull all the way across the internet\", if configured correctly, of course.\n", "Q: Finder Cover Flow Icon Preview not working I'm not sure what happened but I noticed recently that the Cover Flow icon previews were missing from my files in Finder.  I'm using OSX 10.6.7.  See the screenshot below - I'm expecting a preview of the file to be shown rather than the black document icon.\nHow can I get the preview back?  The View Options have \"Show Icon Preview\" ticked.\nQuicklook still works on individual files, just not in Finder.\n\nEdit\nError message reported in Console:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/QuickLook.framework/Resources/quicklookd.app/Contents/MacOS/quicklookd: /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickLook.framework/Resources/quicklookd.app/Contents/MacOS/quicklookd: cannot execute binary file\n(com.apple.quicklook[5107]): Exited with exit code: 126\nEdit 2\nOutput of command suggested by @jm666\nlipo -detailed_info /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickLook.framework/Resources/quicklookd.app/Contents/MacOS/quicklookd\nlipo: can't figure out the architecture type of: /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickLook.framework/Resources/quicklookd.app/Contents/MacOS/quicklookd\nAfter seeing the error message, I restored the previous version of quicklookd from my Time Machine backup and the problem was resolved.

(you can see it in activity monitor)\n\n*Are there any messages about quicklookd in the console.app? (system.log and All Messages would be good places to start)\n\n*Are you running any custom utility software or added any plug-ins to modify quicklook or Finder?\n\n*Anything else major changed of late?\n\n\nYou should be able to determine if quicklookd is failing to start or has a problem with a specific plug-in. It's too uncertain to know what went wrong and the steps to fix depend on what has broken.\nEdit If quicklookd won't run in a new user and gets the same errors, then reinstalling the OS should write a new quicklook. The plugins you list are probably harmless and you can either try removing them first or reinstalling. I would go the reinstall first, but can't predict which it will be. \n\nA: Have you tried running \"Repair Disk Permissions\" from Disk Utility? \nIn the past I've found that fixed an issue with icons not displaying correctly.\nAlternatively look at a tool like Onyx can run a more comprehensive system maintenance, so that might be worth a shot. \n\nA: I'd first start with something that doesn't modify any data, to remain least intrusive. Try Command+Option+Esc for the Force Quit Applications window, and relaunch Finder. If that doesn't fix it, I'd probably reboot and test.\nThe next step for me would be to boot in safe mode, by holding down Shift when you turn on the computer. If it's running 10.5.x or earlier, you'll see a spinning gear and the boot will take some time. 10.6 will show a progress bar. You can get more information on the function of a Safe boot here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564.\nIf the issue persists passed that point, then I'd likely start manually removing more caches (~/Library/Caches/), or proceed as @BendiLow suggests with permissions, etc. OnyX can help in system modifications, but to date, I haven't seen anything in the app that specifically would affect the Cover Flow index.\n", "Q: Untick the 'Open Safe Files' preference in Safari with Terminal After all the fuss over Mac Defender, I thought it might be a good idea to disable the open safe files option in safari for the users in our network. I'd like to do this with the 'Send Unix Command' via Remote Desktop. \n\nHow can I use terminal to disable this preference in Safari?\n\nA: You can use the defaults application to change the preference for this using the following command: \ndefaults write com.apple.Safari AutoOpenSafeDownloads 0\n\n", "Q: How can I troubleshoot Kernel Panics on my iMac I recently started to see kernel panics on my iMac, that I believe has something to do with my hard drives.

In that case, it's pretty easy to keep eliminating possibilities until the source is obvious.\nHere is the best writeup of Mac specific information on Understanding and Debugging Kernel Panics. It is very technical, so take what you wish and move on to the steps below.\nLike anything, it's best to isolate the problem to avoid chasing down thousands of potential causes. It's best to be systematic about how you isolate issues, so here are the two articles I would start with in the case of a kernel panic. You will start with general steps and then isolate software before hardware and eventually reinstall the OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Isolating issues in Mac OS X - great general reference, links to specific sub articles\n\n*Mac OS X: How to troubleshoot a software issue\nIn your specific case - the last code on the stack seems to point to Spotlight (mds) processing NTFS (windows) data so you might pay particular attention to any windows drives that are connected in case there is a relation to the crash. Keep in mind, the stack trace is sometimes wrong and you see some innocent bystander was running on the CPU at the time of the crash. Good Luck!\n\nA: If I had to guess, I'd say it was caused by the ntfs driver. Since the driver  itself is very stable, I suspect something is going on with your drives that is causing it. I suggest checking your drives' SMART status as well as check in the console to see if there is anything interesting there.\nEDIT 5/28/2011:\nThe mds process is likely the trigger, and it's failing on processing something on one of your NTFS-formatted drives. This could either be Spotlight crashing on reading a file or the driver itself crashing. To determine if the driver is at fault, you could try the NTFS-3G driver (http://macntfs-3g.blogspot.com/ -- they also have a commercial product called Tuxera) and see if the panics continue to occur. (Side benefit: you can write to your NTFS drives.)\nFurthermore, have you added or installed any files recently? If there is a specific file that is causing mds to crash, removal of the file should take care of the problem. (That said, mds itself shouldn't cause a full kernel panic.)\nThe kernel panic here is what tells me that something is either going on at the driver level (which should be the only things that cause panics -- normally) or at the hard-drive level. I would again suggest checking the drive status to determine that a drive isn't failing and causing the Apple NTFS driver to panic. In this case, I would expect the NTFS-3G driver would either throw an error or panic as well. If the drive is failing, it will be visible in your drive's S.M.A.\n", "Q: Why is my Macbook pro's screen better than my Desktop Monitor? This is probably a calibration issue, but why is it that my Mac doesn't need any kind of monitor calibration but my desktop's monitor do? \nWell, I actually really want to get a monitor, so I am wondering what specs should I look at to get it as close to my macbook colors as possible without a need for calibration.\n\nA: Your external display, unless it is manufactured by Apple will require calibration. This is because the default settings on monitors are for every day use and for any kind of display card. While the internal displays on Apple products are calibrated specifically for the video card that is in that machine. \nIn regards to display types it all depends on what you want to do? Video/audio production, graphic design, gaming. \nIf its for gaming you'll need something that has a good refresh rate for motion graphics. Same with video, audio production doesn't really matter. \nWhen it comes to graphic design you will need to ensure that your display can reproduce the color spectrums you are working with. \nThe cheaper the display the cheaper the technology in the LCD. \nFor really nice color reproduction and refresh rates you will be looking for a display that uses S-IPS/H-IPS LCD panel. For middle of the road you'd be looking at PVA/MVA technology which has ok color reproduction and ok refresh rates. Then there is TN panels which are the bargin screens. \nYou can read more about LCD technology over at Wikipedia. \nI would recommend an IPS display from either Samsung, Dell or Apple. \n", "Q: Internet Sharing supports WEP but not WPA? I am trying to make a WiFi hotspot through my MacBook. It has Snow Leopard 10.6.7 on it.\nThe thing is that when I go to sharing and then configure internet sharing, it only gives the choice of using WEP password encryption. \nIs it possible to use it with WPA or WPA2? If yes, how?\n\nA: It is not possible to use OS X's internet sharing feature to create a WPA- or WPA2-protected network [through v10.7 Lion, see below]; WEP (40- or 128-bit) or no encryption at all are the only available options.\nNote that the original title on this question (\"Airport supports WEP but not WPA?\") was a bit misleading, as this is only a limitation on wireless networks created with internet sharing.  Mac computers can join WPA and WPA2 wireless networks, and have been able to for years and years.  Similarly, Apple's Airport base stations (except for early models) can create WPA and WPA2 networks.  It's only when the Mac is acting as a base station that this limitation exists.\nUPDATE: In OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), the normally-visible security options changed to WPA2 Personal or no encryption. WEP is still available in 10.8, but only if you hold Option while clicking on the Security pop-up menu.\n\nA: I advise everyone concerned by the security of their wireless network\nto fill a feedback at Apple:I need a secure network! about this security bug.\nYou have to know that WEP & WPA are just fake security.\nThere are many weapons available on the web to enter such falsely protected networks within a few minutes.\nWPA2 (in fact 802.11i) is a true security function for wireless networks. Every wireless card on the market implement WPA2. It is a\nhardware function.\nIt is up to any decent operating system to manage it.\nLately Mountain Lion permits to start a wireless network secured with WPA2.\nThis real security improvment isn't advertised within the many features\nbrought by Mountain Lion. Probably too late a move for such large a weakness.\n", "Q: Can I use 2 iPhones as walkie talkie? (without internet!) I want to use 2 (or more) iPhones as walkie talkie (i.e. they talk each other without needing internet/voice call).\nOf course this should work with wifi, because it doesn't make much sense a to have bluetooth or usb connection for this application...\n\nA: There's an app for that™.\nWiChat will allow you to chat with the Bonjour protocol, that is, chatting with people on the local network without connecting to an external server.\n\nA: There are several apps that will do this in the iTunes Store. The search to use is \"walkie talkie\". I recommend you look first at Walkie-Talkie - iOS. \n", "Q: \"scheduled tasks\" - what's the OSX equivalent \nPossible Duplicate:\nOSX: Is there a built-in scheduler program? \n\nI'm a \"born again OSX user\", coming from 20 years of Windows ;-)\nI'd like to run a batch file that does maintenance for me - backup, some other stuff every night at a given time. On windows you have something called \"Scheduled Tasks\" what allows you to handle that. Couldn't find something equivalent on OSX. Is it not implemented on the GUI Level and you have to go to command line for that? something like \"cron jobs\" on linux?\n\nA: They are called cron jobs in Unix-like systems. From the terminal man cron and man crontab.\n\nA: OSX is built on a foundation of BSD-style Unix. You can find cron in /usr/sbin/cron, and if you're seeking to just schedule the execution of a command-line utility with command-line parameters, then cron is probably the easiest and most efficient way to get it done.\nIf you're seeking to get a service run once at boot-time, or to have a maintenance daemon or bot running all the time, then you can use launchd (and launchctl) to do that. If you want a maintenance application to get run when you first log-in, then you can do that with the list of \"Login items\" in your entry in the Accounts preference pane.\nYou can also seek to build a workflow using the Automator application (found in your /Applications folder), and then use an iCal alarm to go off on a particular schedule to trigger that workflow.\n", "Q: iTunes shows App Updates Badge, but no updates are available On my iTunes page, it is showing a 7 next to Apps to indicate I have 7 apps with available updates.  When I click on the link to show available updates, regardless of which iTunes account I have, it always shows \"No Updates are available\".  How can I see what apps it thinks I have updates for, or reset that counter?\n\nA: The common cause of this is when you have purchases in one library that belong to two Apple ID's. You will have to sign in to that second Apple ID to download those updates. This means iTunes is working as it was designed (although it is confusing since the Apple ID for each purchase is \"hidden\" in the info and not easily displayed.\nA less common instance is when there is a problem with either the on line store or your local files that store the apps.\nHere are two articles that will help if you simply have more than one account making purchases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which account did I use to make a specific purchase?\n\n*iOS: Changing the signed-in iTunes Store account\n\nA: Another cause for iTunes to do this is when you purchased an app in one country's store and you changed it to another country. That's what happened to me.\nUpdates are only available from the AppStore country you bought the app in (but the badge may still be displayed).\n\nA: Another cause for iTunes to do this is when you purchased an app in one country's store and you changed it to another country. That's what happened to me.\nUpdates are only available from the AppStore country you bought the app in (but the badge may still be displayed).\n\nA: This happened to me, my wife and I use separate computer accounts but they both use the same iTunes store ID. Occasionally I would have to go into my wife's computer account and run the app update in iTunes there to get rid of the badge in iTunes under my computer account.\n", "Q: iCal Google Sync -- how to get rid of folders (delegates)? I've got my calendars in Google, but when I sync them with iCal I get all these ugly folders. How can I clean this up?\n\n\nA: Since late 2012, you can add additional calendars to your main CalDAV account by going to https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect. After you have done this, you can uncheck the delegate calendars in the iCal settings.\n\nA: Short Answer: You cannot easily clean that up.\nLong Answer:  When you have delegate calendars, that typically means that you are given permission to view (maybe edit) someone else's calendar.  This is why there is special interface to deal with delegation and they are grouped in their own section of the calendar list.\nBehind the scenes, google treats each calendar you create as its own principal (almost like its own account), so iCal treats all the non default calendars as delegates.  To confuse things further, you can actually can share google calendars so iCal could never tell the difference between an actual shared calendar and new calendar you added.  \nThe only solution is to move all your events into the default calendar or move your calendars to a service which handles multiple calendars in a better way (Yahoo, Exchange, iCalServer)\n", "Q: How does iPhone's facetime work even when the phone function is off? It's a bit inconvenient that iPhone's FaceTime can only be used on WiFi. And yet you call people by using their numbers.  \nBut my mom's iPad only has wifi and she has no number, and I call her iPad via my iPhone by using her email address. I don't quite understand how it knows her iPad and makes the connection? Is it through her Apple ID? \nWhat's doubly confusing is when I traveled to Europe for a couple months I put my iPhone account on hold; so text and phone did not work. I kept the wifi on though. But I was blown away that mom could still call me from her iPad. Somehow FaceTime worked though WiFi with my phone number even though my phone account was turned off? I'm assuming it somehow associated my number with my Apple ID, but wow, I'm confused?\n\nA: Initially Apple used the phone number as the FaceTime \"account\" and non-user-visible SMS validation as the \"password\" to avoid forcing end users to enter/remember/forget yet another set of credentials. \nThe SMS validation happens behind the scenes - but SMS does have to be active on the phone at the time of first verifying (and potentially when re-verifying?) your FaceTime account on Apple's servers. If you switch off FaceTime in the Phone settings, wait a few seconds and turn it back on - you can see this checking process. The status message will change to say \"Waiting for activation...\" until Apple's servers verify your account. Once it says \"Your phone number will be shared with people you call with FaceTime.\" the account is verified.\nYou can now use AppleID for credentials for devices that do not have SMS and an easily accessed/understood phone number. SMS is needed one time at activation to ensure Apple's push notification goes to the correct device - there shouldn't be a problem dropping SMS later once the device is registered.\nThis data lets the address book facilitate dialing and location over WiFi. Apple runs servers that let each device check in and request to initiate a call if the receiver is online anywhere. There is no technical reason why FaceTime cannot use cellular data for the call (bits are bits) but in practice the carriers would probably have to charge more for supporting everyone video chatting on networks that are currently straining to contain the data already flowing over them.\nOn devices that allow an email address - if someone calls you - all the devices currently on ring but only one picks up. For example, it's possible to receive incoming FaceTime calls ringing on a Mac, an iPod touch and an iPad - and any one can pick up the \"call\".\n", "Q: Running OS X and Windows simultaneously Using Bootcamp is it possible to run OS X and Windows simultaneously such that I can command-tab between the two?  I've run Windows using Bootcamp a few years ago but at that time a restart was required when switching between OS X and Windows.\n\nA: Bootcamp is designed to allow you to change your operating system while the computer boots.\nNothing allows you to swap purely back and forth between operating systems that way. What you can do is use software that runs Windows in OS X with hardware virtualization, a huge step up from the software virtual machines of old.\nThere are three good options: Parallels, VMWare Fusion, and VirtualBox, the last of which has the advantage of being free.\nIf you want more technical details, particularly the ones that drove an edit to improve this answer, read the comments below.\n\nA: VMware Fusion has a nice feature in 3.x called Unity that allows Windows applications to run on the Mac desktop without running in a window that also runs Windows.  This means that you could have Word 2010 running with the look and feel of Word 2010 on Windows 7, but as another application Window on your Mac.\nWindows must still be booted as a VM - it's just that VMware Fusion hides this.  Applications in Unity mode can be pinned to the dock just like regular Mac OS X applications.  Launching them launches VMware, which boots the VM and then spawns the application.\nThis is akin to Wine on Linux, except a full VM of Windows is running - no API translations, full Windows fidelity.\nYou can alt-tab amongst Mac and Windows apps.\nSee: http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/06/vmware-fusion-unity/\n\nA: This is still true.  \"Bootcamp\", as the name implies, is a way to boot into a non-Apple operating system, and your computer can only boot into one operating system at a time.\nIf you want to use Windows programs side-by-side with Mac programs, you'll need to use a virtualization program like Parallels or Fusion.\n", "Q: Address bar in Safari gone! The address bar in my safari broswer has disappeared... I have quit my safari browser and reopened it, but the problem persists. This is what it looks like  I have no idea why this is happening, but i use safari as my main browser so it has all my bookmarks, etc so i can't really just stop using it. Please help, thanks.\n\nA: With the introduction of Safari 6.0, the command key sequence changed for this from command + shift +  |  to command + option + T.\nIt's also the first item under the view menu, 'Show Toolbar' or 'Hide Toolbar.'\nedit: in Safari 7.0 and OS X 10.9, this feature is still available through View > Hide Toolbar or View > Show Toolbar, however there is no command key sequence.\n\nA: Right click in the empty area > \"Customize Toolbar\" > drag the address bar back up.\nYou probably accidentally command-dragged it out.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro external monitor maxes out at 1360x768 I have a 13\" MBP with a mini DP to VGA. I have it hooked up to my new Samsung 23\" display that has a max resolution of 1920x1080, but it seems that I can't pick a resolution higher than 1360x768. The adapter is from CablesToGo and states that the max resolution supported is 1920x1200 so I should be fine.\nNote: I've tried on 2 MBP's and the resolution is the same on both.\n\nA: Turns out a reboot was necessary for it to display correctly.  Once that was done all is good in the world again.\nNOTE:\nWas never able to get this to work properly with a VGA adapter - a reboot is always required.  The only solution was going to HDMI.\n\nA: Seems like there may be a faulty piece of hardware somewhere.\nThe Display Port to VGA adapter is a fairly complex adapter including a digital to Analog converter circuit board, it is not just passing copper wires straight thru like older DVI based adapters did, eg Mini-DVI. I would try connecting the adapter to different LCD Monitors and see if it is also providing incorrect maximum resolutions for those displays too.  If the answer is yes then contact Cables to Go, and let them know the issue with the adapter.\nIf no, it might not be a bad idea to test the the Samsung display if you can't find a fault in the adapter. Try connecting the Samsung display to a native VGA source and see if the monitor is working correctly, because the display itself has a analog to digital converter that if malfunctioning could produce erroneous maximum resolutions as well.\n", "Q: My external harddisk is readonly on mac I am having a 1Tb external harddisk. Its working perfectly fine on ubuntu and windows. But On mac its read-only. How can I change this.\n\nA: Your external drive is most probably formatted on Windows and is then in NTFS format.\nCheck this question which will give you the different possibilities you have.\n", "Q: How to auto show unarchived files in Finder? Currently Archive Utility is configured to unzip all archives opened by me in their directory.\nWhile this is good it is not enough for me, I want it to show me the result in Finder.\nHow can I obtain this behavior, is there a hidden switch?\n\nA: Instead of Archive Utility.app, I recommend The Unarchiver. It'll show the extracted files  in Finder. (I'm not sure if it's default behavior but you can change the setting in preferences.)\n", "Q: Do I get same charging speed when I use a MacBook's usb port to charge my iPad? I like to use my MacBook Pro's usb port to charge my iPad, but do I get same charging speed as compared to using the included power adapter?\n\nA: From the Apple iPad Charging Support Doc.\n\nThe fastest way to charge your iPad is with the included 10W USB Power Adapter. Your iPad will also charge, though more slowly, when attached to a computer with a high-power USB port (many recent Mac computers) or with an iPhone Power Adapter. When attached to a computer via a standard USB port (most PCs or older Mac computers) iPad will charge, but only when it's in sleep mode.\n\nYour 10W iPad charger (which is different to your iPhone / iPod charger) is the fastest way to charge your iPad. It is faster than your Mac or PC's USB port.\n", "Q: how to select multiple consecutive files in icon view in finder? in Windows it is easy, just shift + click, but in Mac I cannot do the same trick. I am fed up with cmd + click every single file\n\nA: There's no exact equivalent that I'm aware of; I usually rubberband-select a region and then command-click the ones I don't want.\nMouse down at the top left of the area you want to select, drag to the bottom right of the area, release.  A rubberband will be highlighted as you drag the mouse; all icons within the rubberband will be selected.  It's also possible to chain these by holding Shift or Option for the second and successive selections, so you can add additional selections or deselect icons selected previously.\n", "Q: Is there any keyboard short cut to input mac key symbols like shift, cmd, ctrl \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I type a command character (⌘) in Mac OS X? \n\nDo I have to copy paste those ⌘ stuff from online sources?\n\nA: EDIT: I found another way to do this, and is much easier and less complicated.\nGo to the Language and Text preference pane and select the Text section.\n\nFrom there, you can substitute typed-in text with the symbols that you want. For example, I set commandkey to be replaced with ⌘. This makes it much easier to type in the symbols. \n\nNo, you do not need to.\nGo to System Preferences, and open the Language and Text Preference Pane. Select Input Sources, and select Unicode Hex Input:\nAfter doing this, select Unicode Hex Input as your language input (as shown below), and you can enter the characters using the unicode hex of the character, by holding ⌥+ABCD, where ABCD is the unicode hex.\n\nThe unicode hexes are (the ones you requested and a few others):\n\n\n*\n\n*Shift Key (⇧) - 21E7\n\n*Command Key (⌘) - 2318\n\n*Control Key (⌃) - 2303\n\n*Option Key (⌥) - 2325\n\n*Backward Delete (⌫) - 232B\n\n*Caps Lock (⇪) - 21EA\n\nA: Nothing predefined, but you could probably create some, if not via the Keyboard prefpane then with something like KeyRemap4Macbook.  You don't need to go online to get a copy-paste source, though; use the Character Viewer.  (You probably want to turn on the keyboard and character viewer in the Keyboard prefpane; then you can click on the flag in the menubar and select Show Character Viewer.\nFor what it's worth, I handle special characters I use often with a PTHPasteboard pasteboard that is docked to a screen edge and autohides; that way I can just slide the mouse to that screen edge, scroll if needed for the appropriate pasteboard entry, and click to insert it.\n", "Q: What is the minimum hardware needed to run Xcode 4? I understand from the Apple developer site that Xcode 4 requires an Intel Mac running Snow Leopard, but I can't see any advice on hardware spec (other than Intel).\nI imagine it could run on an old Mac Mini with 1GB of Ram, but that perhaps I'd be pulling my hair out before too long.\nWhat is the minimum sensible spec to run Xcode? This would be for developing iOS apps, so I'd be running the emulator too. It is only for home use and my own education, so I don't have a big budget, so I'm looking to buy off eBay or similar. As I already have spare keyboards, mice and monitors I'd probably get a Mac Mini.\n\nA: 1GB of RAM will kill you: frankly, I can't imagine that it would meaningfully run. I'm currently using a 2009 MacBook (not Pro) with 4GB of RAM, and for the first two or three hours Xcode runs pretty well. \nAfter that, though, it gets slower and slower. On a pretty small project Xcode will be using multiple gigabytes of RAM with the OS swapping 2-3GB to disk. Before long I not only have to quit Xcode, I also have to restart the machine to get things back up to speed. (To head off potential commenters, no, it's not something else on my system, it's Xcode 4: no other piece of software, including Photoshop operating on a 20+ GB file, fails to clear up the swapping speed problem after quitting the app.)\nI can safely say, both from my experience and from talking to others, that 2GB of RAM is the bare, bare minimum, and it's not going to be a good experience. I'll be replacing this system soon, but in the meantime I'm upgrading to 8GB because I'm losing too much time to only having 4.\n", "Q: preview merges pdf and result in huge file size? I used preview to merge 5 pdf files, of total size of 800k. All pdf have no graphs. However the resulting file size is 10MB...\nI then tried Acrobat, under similar simple method I got a combined pdf of 750kb.\nSo why is preview so inefficient? Or Have I just misconfigured sth.?\n\nA: I can't really answer as to why it's so inefficient, but i've had the same problem, and i got around it by using free Quartz filters from Jerome Colas.\nThis post on the Apple discussion boards has the details, but the link is broken, an extra * on the end breaks it, it should be https://public.me.com/jcolas.\nDownload, unzip, and add the \"Filters\" folder to your Library folder.\nTo use, open a PDF in Preview, click File > Save As, then select Quartz Filter, and the level of compression.\n\nI believe that Jerome is exposing something that already exists in OSX, but certainly, it's a good solution that works well for me, allowing me to get a good balance between quality and filesize.\n", "Q: How come Quicktime plays .avi files but iTunes doesn't? I think I might be missing something but it seems like Quicktime is happy playing my .avi movies but iTunes isn't. So I have to go through the rigmarole of converting .avi to .mp4 with iTunes before viewing in iTunes or on my iPod Touch. This of course means I end up with two versions of the same file (three if I need to view on iPod). Is there some solution to the issue?

And I've noticed that to be able to control brightness I need to open the Display.prefPanel  and modify the brightness of the displays individualy.\nIs there a way to do this simultaneously? Maybe with a third party app? If not, is there a way to assign a keyboard shortcut to the second display brightness?\n\nA: I just started using Dimmer Than Dim, a free app in the App Store. I only have one display (iMac), however.\n\nA: F.lux is worth a look, it changes the colour temperature and brightness of your monitor(s) based on the time of day.\n\nA: Shades can do this.\n(I am pretty sure it can, I only have one monitor attached at the moment, so I can't verify.)\n\nA: Lunar has Sync Mode which automatically detects changes in brightness on your iMac screen (even those made by the light sensor) and syncs them automatically to the LED Cinema display.\nIt doesn't use a software overlay. In fact, Apple vendored displays get special treatment as Lunar uses an implementation hidden inside macOS Display Services to control them natively.\nNote that you have to connect the USB port of the LED Cinema to the iMac to enable the DisplayServices method of changing brightness to work.\nDisclaimer: I'm the developer of Lunar\n", "Q: I need to get my pictures from the iPad to my PC I got my iPad in february, and got it syncing with my PC.

Simple question: Can I install an application that was downloaded to my iTunes into my iPad/iPhone without syncing it with the computer?\nI am abroad and without access to wi-fi, only network cable, so the trivial solutions of \"download directly through the iPad\" and \"sync it with your computer once and be over it\" won't work (unless I start syncing with two computers at the same time, and I recall it gave me trouble in the past).\n\nA: You can try the install with iPhone Configuration Utility:\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/FA_iPhone_Configuration_Utility/Introduction/Introduction.html\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution.pdf\n\nA: No. \nTo install apps into your iPad you would need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install it via the App Store (on your iDevice)\n\n*Sync it through iTunes\n\n\nThat is, if you don't jailbreak. However, I will not touch on the subject as it may break Apple's license for apps (and void your warranty).\n\nA: You might be able to download the application (some applications have their own website so you dont have to use iTunes to download them) then drag it into your iPad.\n", "Q: Batch adding names to mac os spelling dictionary I work at a school, and I would like to add a number of unique names to the local dictionary so that they won't be flagged as misspelled by the spell checker. \nI've discovered the local dictionary at ~/Library/Spelling/\nI also see that words are added to the localdictionary text file each on individual lines. \nHowever, when I try to paste in a large number of names (or to simply replace this file with another) I find that the new entries aren't recognized by the spell checker, even after killing the applespell process, or restarting altogether. \nIdeally, I'd like to set this up so I could create a script to install this custom dictionary on all computers at the school (this works in MS Office).

(examples inside the post) I'm wondering what is the app that used to make this kind of these videos/screen-casts with awesome 3d effect.\nI found these two videos which I guess both made using the same app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Analog: http://vimeo.com/23201595\n\n*KickOff: http://vimeo.com/23480804\nAny idea?\n\nA: They don't use any one app. I'm guessing they first change the desktop background to green and capture the screen with some screen capturing app, like Quicktime X for example.\nThey record and then they edit the video in either After Effects or Apple Motion, where they can key off all the green and make it a \"3d layer\". They take a screenshot of their windowless desktop and throw it behind the recorded window, maybe add some soft lights to create a dim shadow and after that its all a mater of playing with the camera.\nIn After Effects or Apple Motion you can also make the effect of \"switching between monitors\", like on the kickoff video. You simply put it all inside another composition, that atop the picture of a Macbook air, and then move it all together. You can think of Apple Motion and After Effects as the \"Photoshop\" of videos: you can make pretty cool stuff with them. I use After Effects ;)\n\nA: I agree with @kevin9794 that these videos have probably been done in AfterEffects. Please note that the \"Analog\" video is technically more advanced: the Mouse cursor is a separate item that has all properties of a real 3d object: depth, shading, generates shadow etc. \nIf I had to do it, I would do it like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen-record application in use\n\n*Set up 2D plane in AfterEffects (AE) composition, map recording onto it\n\n*Set up same-color infinite plane behind, so that camera never sees recording edge\n\n*Animate camera motion across recording\n\n*Export animation geometry / path to 3D program (e.g. Cinema 4d), there rendering the 3D pointer arrow with the same camera movements\n\n*Import rendered arrow into composition. Tweak shadow and depth of field effect.\n\n\nNot quite easy, but certainly manageable with a bit of time and attention to detail.\n", "Q: Syncing without creating a mess?

My iPhone4 is weird. The bottom touchscreen can be slid (to unlock) but it's really hard to tap the app in the bottom area. It seem the bottom screen is not sensitive but I can slide to unlock.

When I first boot my MacBook Pro with Core i7, 8 GB ram, and 7200 rpm hard drive running Mac OS X 10.6.7, it still takes a long time (10 or so dock icon bounces) for latest Firefox 4.0.1 to open.\nWhy is it so slow? Is it something on my part? Or is Firefox just that slow to open? Thanks!\nP.S. As a comparison, it doesn't take long a all (a few seconds) for Firefox to open on my Windoze machine.\n\nA: If you have installed many fonts (font packages), you should disable the ones that you don't use. Also try running Firefox in safe mode (without addons). FF4 should start for about 2-3 seconds.\n\nA: Simply because it is a Mac. It takes longer to open an application than other operating systems, but once it is open it remains open so the program will load faster afterwards. \nThis is because on a Mac, the X button on top doesn't close the application but rather hides it (unlike a Windows which closes it with the X). Short term this can be a pain in the ass, like I always see it. It might be helpful if you do not shut down your Mac so that all the applications are still running in the background, hence opening a picture, word file or browser might be faster.

I think it would be bearable if I could just scrap symbolichotkeys and refresh without having to logout.

I've been using this iPad for almost two months now and it is only in the last couple of days that it has started behaving in this way.\nI can think of several reasons for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The battery indicator is out of whack (14% actually means 0%) and needs to be calibrated. If so, how do I do this?\n\n*There is something physically wrong with the battery such that the charge beyond ~14% is unusable.\n\n\nI found someone with a similar problem here but there is no resolution reported.\nWhen I recharge the iPad, it is able to charge back up to 100% but would subsequently drain down to 14% as before.\nDoes anyone know what's the best thing to do in this case?\n\nA: So as it turned out, it's a case of a mis-calibrated battery indicator. Here's what I did to re-calibrate it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use iPad until it switches off by itself\n\n*Charge it back up\n\n*After a couple of minutes, it should turn itself back on. Check the battery indicator to see if it's around 2% (as would be expected). If it is, then allow the iPad to be fully charged back up to 100%. If it is not (i.e. it is around 14% as in my experience), proceed to the next step.\n\n*Disconnect the iPad from the charger and let it discharge completely again\n\n*Repeat from (2).\n\n\nIt took my iPad one cycle of the steps above to get its battery indicator re-calibrated and it has been working fine since. If this doesn't fix your iPad it's probably worth getting AppleCare involved.\n\nA: Take it into your local Apple Store for a replacement. If you don't have an Apple Store nearby, contact AppleCare.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 space used but not allocated I've been using the (iPhone) app Flash Drive, which you can use to start a http:// server on your phone and connect to it using Finder and transfer files. I recently transferred a .mkv file of over 1gig to my phone. It took a solid 5mins to complete, and then after it said done, the app's size showed up as zero KB on the phone. Even through Finder, the file shows up as zero KB, so I deleted the files individually via Finder. Now, the space is allocated on my phone, but the files don't show up any where. I connected using my FTP/WebDAV client to see if there are any hidden files (.XXX) taking up space, but nothing, just the same files I see through the app's interface.\nAnyone have an idea how I can get the unallocated space back? I restarted my phone using the regular method, but still the space is taken up and I'm deadsure that I didn't put anything else on my phone which could have taken up the space except the two separate incidents with the .mkv file.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I don't know the specifics of that particular App, but allocated space for 3rd party applications in the iPhone is restricted to themselves. That means that Application 1 cannot read Application 2 data. This security measure greatly limits the ways we have to share data among applications (and has made Dropbox very popular).\nGiven the above, it's very likely that the app Flash Drive uses its own space for storing the file(s) you upload (because it doesn't really have any other place to put it unless you jailbreak your device).\nWith that said, deleting the application from the phone and (just in case) fully restarting it, should recover the space. You can later re-copy the application to your phone by connecting it to iTunes again.\nIn order to delete it, make sure it's closed (i.e. not running), touch and hold the App's icon until it wiggles and touch the (X) on the corner of its icon. It will ask you if you want to delete the App and the Data (or warn you about it). Go ahead. Then shutdown your phone and restart it again. \n", "Q: applescript (osascript) for changing Terminal.app profile Is here a way to changing the Terminal.app profile from the command line?\nHere is already couple of questions about changing colors, but I need change the whole profile from the \"Basic\" (what is my default) to \"Homebrew\" or \"Pro\" from the shell script.\nLooking for only clean command-line solution (e.g. without clicks, global shotcuts etc.), so probably with osascript.

Is there a way on OSX or with a 3rd party software to use both a Wi-fi and an ethernet connection, thus having the sum of the connection speeds?\nOr maybe making some applications connect to one connection and other apps connect to the other?  \nP.S. I don't want to bridge one connection over the other.\nP.P.S. Both are different connections with two different ISPs and both are paid for, there's no wifi stealing if you might ask.\n\nA: Even with multi-homing on iOS 7 starting to allow traffic over LTE and WiFi simultaneously, there isn't a good way to accomplish this on OS X Mavericks and lower.\nI have run Link Aggregation on macs since 10.4 and it's really nice when you have a gigabit switch. You will need a switch that runs LACP and two physical ethernet ports like is typical on G4 & G5 PowerMacs days and of course the entire MacPro line. This is built into the OS X network stack and you need nothing but the hardware and a compatible ethernet switch.\nMac OS X won't show LACP as an option without two ethernet ports. I don't know of a switch that does LACP over wireless or allows mixing of wired and wireless interfaces. You might be able to trick the OS some way, but without the switch to cooperate you'll have to rewrite LACP on the switch for that to work.\nIt's much easier to segregate certain traffic over specific interfaces by modifying your routing table. This will allow you to send some traffic over wifi and others over the wire.\nFor example netflix and such could be routed over one connection if you set up a route to their network to prefer one gateway IP on the ISP you prefer. It's not feasible to tell an application to use only one interface as that has to be \"baked\" in to that app and not common practice. What is common practice is to use local routing tables (or routing tables on the router) to steer certain traffic to one gateway. More sophisticated routers have quality of service where you specify some metric like VOIP or video conference traffic is a priority - so when the network is overloaded in some specific, measurable way, then non critical traffic will be shaped or steered to a different route to keep the fast network clear for  better responses.\nThese routers and the knowledge to run them do not come cheaply. I'd guess $3k us for the hardware and triple that for training and software licenses on the routers. \n\nA: You can have only one default gateway, so you have to pick one interface as your default route. If you add static routes for specific IP networks, you could have traffic directed out the other interface for those networks, but that's going to be painful to maintain. The route/ISP that you send traffic out, will be the same one that return traffic comes on.\nUnless you were able to run some dynamic routing software on the machine, then you can't do what you want to - i.e. combine both ISPs to increase your bandwidth. I'm not saying it's impossible, but that's the job of a proper hardware router, not your client computer.\n", "Q: Synchronizing iPhone and Mail.app inboxes I have IMAP configured on both my iPhone 3G and MacBook and I have push enabled on my iPhone.\nWhen I receive an email and read it on my MacBook, shouldn't it mark it as unread on the iPhone too? \nI didn't really notice it before, but recently, it has been annoying me that once I have viewed them on my MacBook I have to view them on my iPhone to mark then as read.\nJust checking for new mail in the iPhone doesn't suffice.\nIs there a way to make sure the changes on the Mail.app inbox are applied immediately to the iPhone?\nI have my own email servers on my own domain(maquib.com hosted on dreamhost). My brother who also has an account and configured the same way has also noticed this.\nHere are some screenshots of how my iPhone and Mac are configured:\n\n\n\nA: I don't think it's an iPhone configuration problem.\nMaybe a Mail.app problem, it seems it's no syncing back the changes correctly. Except I don't think there's a preference to change that.\nIt's most likely a server configuration problem.\nTo be sure, we'll need more information about your mail servers. Do you have access to the configuration? What is maquib.com? From the look of it, it looks like your personal server (with a project to make a Mac OS Tiger app!)\n\nCan you try to download Sparrow? (there's a free version)\nAdd your account on it and see if the problem is still there. That way we'll know if the problem is on the server or on the software side.\n", "Q: Spotlight sometimes can't find a file. (that actually exists) I don't really understand how Spotlight works, I sometimes search for a file that I know it exists, and Spotlight doesn't find it.\nThen I browse to it and it's there.\nThe volume or folders where it is in are not excluded from Spotlight, I've made sure of that.\nShould I (and how?) rebulid Spotlight's index? or otherwise do something so every file can be found?  \n\nEdit: I searched for textwrangler and Spotlight found it, also found it with barebones, so it looks like not every pattern that would match the filename works the same for Spotlight.\n\nA: Spotlight generally only searches at the beginning of words. It can find barebones because it is right after a period, or textwrangler for the same reason, but not wrangler. (It also understands underscores, hyphens, and CamelCase as marking the beginning of words.)\nTo work around this, instead of doing a straight up spotlight search do a search in Finder (with cmd+F or cmd+option+space). Leave the search box blank, and click the plus button next to where it says \"Save.\" Then make your query \"Name\" - \"contains\" -\"wrangler\" and you are good.\nYou also need to be careful because I think the file you are searching for is considered a system file. If you are searching within the Preferences folder you will get the right result, but if you are just searching within the home folder or on the entire hard drive, the system file won't show up, unless you push the plus button again and add to your search query \"System files\" - \"are included.\" Since \"System files\" isn't in the dropdown box by default, you will probably need to click \"Other...\" and then find it. You will have the option of adding it permanently to the dropdown box.\n\nEdit: Added image for clarity\n", "Q: Recover docx files We have just discovered that none of the passwords on our word documents work any longer, and I need a recommendation of an application that I can use to recover the files.\nI believe the files had been created on a windows based computer, so I do not have much of a problem with using a windows based program if required.\n\nA: This applies to .docx files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a back-up copy of the file\n\n*Change the extension from .docx to .zip\n\n*Open new .zip file\n\n*Extract all files\n\n*In the extracted folder, navigate to word\\settings.xml\n\n*Open settings.xml\n\n*Remove the tag w:documentProtection, don't forget to include the < and />\n\n*Save file\n\n*Copy to modified settings.xml to the actual .zip file (over write)\n\n*Rename .zip to .docx\n\n*Open file\n\n\nMicrosoft Office 2007 and up are xml files that can be edited if you know what to look for.\nI just want to add that I am NOT responsible for what you do with this information.

HDD is 2 TB, RAM is 8 GB.  I've got Aperture 3 installed and updated, with a photo library totaling 180 GB.\nWith increasing frequency, Aperture fails to launch.  The icon bounces for a while in the dock (maybe about 30 seconds) and then stops.  I have iStat Menus installed, and I see no real change in system activity while the icon is bouncing.  If I open Activity Monitor, I see the Aperture process listed, and I have to force quit it.  Once this happens, whether I force quit Aperture while it's bouncing or afterwards from Activity Monitor, things just don't behave; other applications fail to launch in the same way.  If I try to restart after failing to launch Aperture, I get a blue screen with an activity indicator that never goes away.\nI've also had iTunes freeze, and it will often lock up the whole operating system, so that absolutely nothing responds besides moving the mouse.  This requires a hard restart to resolve.  It's a moderately sizeable iTunes library that serves as the source for media played on an AppleTV (latest generation) elsewhere in the house.\nI also recently imported a lot of new footage into iMovie '09, and Spotlight has been continuously indexing since.  That was several days ago, and I see nothing in iStat Menus to indicate that the index process is doing anything; the Hard Drive IO section is as active as it is when the computer is idle.  The last time I tried to update my Time Machine backup, it spent several hours in the \"Calculating Changes\" status before I stopped it.\nI've tried repairing the Aperture database and repairing permissions and the Macintosh HD, to no avail.  My best guess is that something is wrong with the directory structure, and I'm going to have to back everything up and reinstall the OS from scratch.  But is there a simpler solution?  Anyone have any ideas?  Any utilities I can use that are more advanced than Disk Utility at finding HDD issues, physical or not?\nUPDATE 6/3/2011: I ran DiskWarrior's file and folder utility on my drive last night, and it found that iPhoto's mosaic plist was corrupt.  I moved it out of ~/Library/Preferences to my desktop and pulled up System Preferences, hoping to get the Mosaic screensaver working.  After I selected the Desktop and Screen Saver pref pane, the whole system locked up and I had to force restart.  I also tried renaming my Aperture library and launching Aperture to see if it was a library problem, and it still bounced forever and then stopped, while still appearing as a process in Activity Monitor.  And I noticed while renaming the library that its size showed up as about 600 MB, when I know it's supposed to be over 180 GB.  I'm going to boot into DiskWarrior and run its directory repair, then reinstall Aperture and hope for the best.\n\nA: Since more than one application is having issues, it's unlikely to be two bugs and more likely to be a system or hardware issue.\nBefore spending a lot of time, make a new user and see if that user has issues as well. You could have bad luck and lots of corruption in your user folder and this will let you know if the problem is with the apps/system/hardware or not.\nDrive Genius might help to run more involved tests, but it might be cheaper to just buy a spare external drive and back things up. You can zero the drive and clear all bad blocks - give that hardware the best chance to work again. You will know soon after restoring your data on the newly erased and installed mac if the problem is resolved.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: This ended up being solved by the nuclear option: backing up, wiping it clean and reinstalling everything.  I did that in order to install Lion.  Now everything works great.\n", "Q: Do apps on jailbroken iOS devices have uncontrolled access to all my data? I'm thinking about jailbreaking my iOS device but one thing worries me. Apple's restrictive developer API has one big advantage: apps can't tinker with my data outside the app unless I allow them to.\nCan apps on jailbroken iOS devices access my e-mails, iTunes account password (through keylogging) and other sensitive information without my consent?\n\nA: Yes. Any jailbreak-only app could potentially do everything you describe because they can acquire root access and run outside of iOS's sandbox.\n\nA: The author of Cydia (\"saurik\") recently answered some similar questions on Reddit - here's one comment:\n\n...you should also ask the following modified question: how does Apple reassure people that the apps in the App Store are safe, and are not doing things like uploading their address books to third parties, or tracking their location?\nThe answer is \"they can't\": apps are allowed to use the address book and your location, and without reading through the source code (itself an error prone form of analysis) you don't know what the app actually /does/, so you can't make any claims about whether it does these specific things you consider evil or not.\nAt the end of the day, you really need to just not install software from vendors that you don't trust (and to be 100% clear: I mean the person who actually wrote the software, not the person who sold it to you), and anyone who tries to provide you assurances otherwise is just selling you the proverbial snakeoil.\n\nAnd from a second comment:\n\nYou are correct, however, that applications in Cydia are not checked to see if they are malicious, but neither are applications submitted to the App Store: neither we nor Apple are looking at your source code. There is nothing that keeps a normal App Store application from reading your address book, tracking your location, and uploading all of this to a server; in fact, nothing keeps these same \"approved by Apple\" applications from using local-to-root kernel exploits in order to bypass the sandbox and take /all/ of your data, including installing a rootkit on your phone.\n\n\nA: No, they could not, assuming you choose an appropriately difficult root password. If an app 'silently' attempted to gain root access and provided other capability in order to be accepted into the official App Store it would have a better chance to gain root. A crucial factor in an answer to this sort of question is proper choice of passwords. If there are exploits that do not require root password, then ignore the negative answer.\n", "Q: Why are my DVD disks in the wrong format?

If they do no resolve the issue, it is likely related to the inverter board, which sends power to your display backlight. It's relatively common in this model MacBook.\nIt shouldn't be to expensive to repair, but I would not recommend doing it yourself. It's taken me hours to do that repair, and that's in an Apple Store with all the right tools, Apple Technician Guides and the proper training.\n\nA: It's probably broken (usually by heat).\nMy friend got similar problem and the service changed his graphics \"card\" in the notebook.

I heard that when you rip an Audio CD to MP3 with iTunes it hides your email address (or some other identifying information) in the MP3. Is this true?\nIs there any way to remove this identifying information?\n\nA: I've seen reference to various iTunes Data Anonymizer applications. This should be a reasonably comprehensive list of where you should and shouldn't be worried.\n\n\n*\n\n*DRM Encumbered Files (protected AAC media) do not carry direct personal information such as your name. They do of course have personal information to the extent necessary to examine and validate your license, but this is information that should only be able to be understood by Apple.\n\n*So called \"iTunes Plus\" unprotected MP3 files do contain your personal information. A cursory search led me to Privatunes. Note that I am not vouching for this software. Your mileage may vary. Make a backup of any files you have before running them through this, or any other modification software.\n\n*Files encoded via the CD Ripper does not tag data into the encoded files, no matter what format or quality you choose. Nor will arbitrary media files you choose to import into iTunes.\nDid I miss a means in which data may become \"available\" into iTunes?\n\nA: Two separate questions. For the first, \"Is my name encoded in the file\", you shouldn't trust the ID3 tag, as perhaps it is encoded elsewhere.\nIn the Terminal, if you run the strings command on a file, it will give all the ASCII strings contained therein. I've done this on an iTunes-purchased MP4, and my name and email is there. I did it on an MP3 that I ripped, and my name is not there. However, I ripped this MP3 using iTunes about 5 years ago, and perhaps this has changed and information is now encoded in the file.\nIf you are not Terminal-savvy\n\n\n*\n\n*open it (it is in /Applications/Utilities)\n\n*type strings (with a space at the end)\n\n*go to the mp3 in iTunes\n\n*select \"Reveal in Finder\" in the context menu\n\n*in Finder, drag the file to the Terminal\n\n*the Unix path to the file should appear\n\n*press enter\n\n\nA lot will scroll by. Perhaps after the path to the file appears, but before pressing enter, add commands to make the output easier to scan like |grep -i YourName or |less.\n\nA: @Jaso @mankoff Just quickly, a few points on that answer (since I don't have enough points to comment just yet)...\niTunes Plus (all that you can buy now) isn't mp3 at all.  It's AAC.  It might not be DRM'd any more, but it does seem to have a checksum, so you can't simply open the file, find ASCII, and start editing.  I've got both my account's name (eg, johnDoe@me.com) and the name Apple has on my account (eg, John Q. Doe) embedded in AACs that I've purchased from the store recently.  Changing them in a text editor breaks the file.  It won't play.  You probably could edit those fields if you had the right tools, but it's not trivial.\nMp3s purchased from Amazon have a tag that says stuff like Amazon.com Song ID: 212209761, but that's it afaict.  Much less Big Brothery.\nNow things you rip with iTunes seem to be clean, at least if you rip to mp3.  I'll take a look at the AACs that are produced when I have a music CD handy.\nSo to sum:\nStuff you rip: Likely free of any identifying marks.\nStuff you buy from Amazon: Minimal identifying marks.  Probably nothing you can't edit easily.\nStuff you buy from iTunes Music Store: Identifying remarks (your account name (likely an email) and the name they have on file for that account) that can't be removed straight-forwardly, assumedly from checksums against the file that are run when AAC files are played.\nThis (among other googled up jive) seems to support these conclusions.\nIANAL.

How can I configure my iPad 2 interface languages, to allow using English as system language and, when writing, be able to have Spanish word recognition auto-complete?\n\nA: In the latest public release of iOS, you need to follow these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on the Settings icon. \n\n*Tap on General.\n\n*Tap on International. \n\n*Tap on Keyboards. \n\n*Tap on Add New Keyboard. \n\n*Select Spanish. \n\n\nThe Spanish keyboard is now added system-wide in addition to your default keyboard (let's say it was English for this example). Now whenever you see a keyboard layout on your screen, you will see a new button with a globe icon on it on the bottom-left corner of the screen, right next to the \"123\" button that switches to the numeric/symbolic keyboard. \nThe globe button works like the \"123\" button in that it alternates between your International keyboard layouts. In this example, it will alternate between English and Spanish layouts. The spell checking and the auto-complete only work for whichever language you have have selected. In other words, you won't get English auto-complete when the layout is Spanish, which makes sense.\nI use this feature all the time when composing e-mail messages in Spanish. Here's another tip: Tap and hold on the \"n\" key to get access to the \"ñ\" character. Also, tap and hold on any vowel to get the \"á\", \"é\", \"í\", \"ó\", \"ú\" and \"ü\" characters. \nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Safe to Repair NTFS Drive/Partitions When Paragon Is Installed Is is safe to repair NTFS drive/partitions with Paragon installed?

Just curious about whether it is iPHONE, IPHONE, or just never written in all capital letters. Is there a style guide or something on this issue?\n\nA: There is an Apple Publications Style Guide, and it says to not use all caps for emphasis. (Apple Style Guide, PDF)\nI can't recall ever seeing all-capital letters in an Apple publication. In the design world, all-capital letters are generally considered hard to read and, in most fonts, ugly, so it's my guess that Apple would avoid the use of all-caps. \n\nA: As initially mentioned by Neil, the Apple Publications Style Guide is the place to look.\nFrom page 34:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*What to capitalize: Follow these rules when you use title-style capitalization.\n  Capitalize every word except:\n  \n*\n  \n*Articles (a, an, the), unless an article is the first word or follows a colon\n  \n*Coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor, for, yet, and so)\n  \n*The word to in infinitives (How to Start Your Printer)\n  \n*The word as, regardless of the part of speech\n  \n*Words that always begin with a lowercase letter, such as iPod and iTunes\n  \n*Prepositions of four letters or fewer (at, by, for, from, in, into, of, off, on, onto, out, over, to, up, and with), except when the word is part of a verb phrase or is used as another part of speech (such as an adverb, adjective, noun, or verb).\n  Starting Up the Computer\n  Logging In to the Server\n  Getting Started with Your MacBook Pro\n  \n  \n\nThat is, the i in words like iPod and iTunes (and iMac, iPhone, iPad, etc.) are never capitalized.\nI don't believe that, given a choice, Apple ever uses all caps, although the only specific rule I've found is on page 33:\n\nDon’t use all caps for emphasis.\n\n\nA: The only official name is \"iPhone\".

I recommend Hydra, but TextEdit will do just fine.\n  \n*Search for something that looks like the following:\n<key>CFBundleTypeExtensions</key>\n<array>\n    <string>txt</string>\n    <string>srt</string>\n    <string>suffix1</string>\n    <string>suffix2</string>\n    …\n\nand so forth, with the suffices the app is able to open contained within the tags. Then you simply delete [or add --newtron] the suffix for items you don't want [or want] the app to open.\n  \n*Save the file, and close it (or quit the editor).\n\n\nA: One follow-up to newtron's solution:\n\nThere you'll find a file called Info.plist. This is an XML property list that stores all sorts of information about the app.\n  Open the file with your favourite text editor. I recommend Hydra, but TextEdit will do just fine.\nSave the file, and close it (or quit the editor).\n\nYou can't save the edited .plist if your account doesn't have the correct permissions (the issue I'm dealing with now--even at admin status you won't have read+write permissions over some files and folders...). To save changes to the .plist files you need to give your user read+write permissions. \nSome of the default Mac applications make this difficult to do and I'm currently searching for a solution (will update) to do this with TextEdit.\n\nA: This worked for me : \nRight click your app and goto contents and open /Applications/*****.app/Contents/Info.plist\nOpen Plist in Xcode as SourceCode and then place this :\n        <dict>\n            <key>CFBundleTypeExtensions</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>jpeg</string>\n                <string>jpg</string>\n                <string>png</string>\n                <string>gif</string>\n            </array>\n            <key>CFBundleTypeIconFile</key>\n            <string>AutomatorApplet.icns</string>\n            <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>\n            <string>AutomatorApplet.icns</string>\n            <key>CFBundleTypeOSTypes</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>GIFf</string>\n                <string>JPEG</string>\n                <string>PNGf</string>\n            </array>\n            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n            <string>Viewer</string>\n        </dict>\n\nI had 'AutomatorApplet.icns' in Resources Folder.\n\nA: Check out the tech-recipes.com for detailed instructions. As @Anriëtte pointed out the app should appear on the Open with menu if it can open the specific file.\n", "Q: What is the difference \"FTP on the Go\" and \"FTP on the Go Pro\" for iOS? What is the difference \"FTP on the Go\" and \"FTP on the Go Pro\" for iOS? and which is better?\n\nA: Looks like the main difference is that the Pro version is universal. That means it will work on iPhone and iPad whereas the normal version only works on iPhone.\nFrom the website:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Optimized for iPad, but also runs perfectly on an iPhone or iPod touch.\n  \n*View many files at once in the tabbed viewer. This lets you easily copy between files, compare, etc.\n  \n*Switch between browsing and full-screen viewing or editing with just a tap.\n  \n*Quick-scrollers let you scroll through files or folders super fast.\n  \n\n", "Q: chmod/chown hfs+ Volume I have just saved some data from a crashed PC to my external HD, which is a HFS+ Volume using Ubuntu live (regular copy no dd). \nNow I am lost: I don't have any privileges in the Folder i copied on my Macbook. I tried changing it using chmod and chown, both as regular user and as root, but I always get a \"operation not permitted\".The owner for all those files is \"999\".\n\nA: Part1:\nMaybe, you will need repair permissions - easily done with Finder.\n\n\n*\n\n*press CMD-I on the top directory where are your files in the external HDD\n\n*click on the lock symbol (right bottom corner)\n\n*enter your password\n\n*and adjust the 1st line at the permission section (Me) for \"Read & Write\", and from the cogwheel select \"Apply to enclosed items...\"\n\n\nThe above should repair permissions - but - probably will not help (as you already told)\nPart2:\nIf the part1 not helped, probably (and only maybe!) you have an broken ACL list. (because files are copied at another OS). OS X HFS has not only usual chmod modes, but maintain ACL (access control list) too.\nTry this in the Terminal.app - DON'T copy&paste all at once, enter the commands one by one...\ncd /Volumes/MOUNT_POINT/directory/with/the/backed/up/files\n# where MOUNT_POINT is the drive name as appears in the Finder.  \n\npwd\n# DOUBLE CHECK the pwd\n# if you do the next on the wrong place - you can corrupt your system\n# YOURE WARNED!!!\n\n#this will remove all ACL informations recursively from all files in your current dir\nsudo chmod -RN ./*\n\n#this will change recursively the ownership of the files -> to you.\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) ./*    #change ownership of files to you\n\ncd      # go home\n\nnow you can quit Terminal.app and check access to files via Finder and you should repeat the first part - changing permissions via Finder's -> CMD-I ...\n\nA: As Karmatic has said, it may likely be an issue with ACLs, but I would advise against changing your users UID as that seems like a backward solution and may break things (like the inability to login or access some critical files). You want to fix the files, not break the user UID ;)\nIf the problems lie with ACLs, or rather ACEs (which are the rulesets for ACL, or better known as access control entries), then you need to repair them. You can list a directory or files ACEs using the ls \"e\" function.\nRun the \"ls -le\" command from Terminal. You should see output like this:\ngalvatron:~ cksum$ ls -le\ntotal 0\ndrwx------+  4 cksum  staff   136 28 Aug 22:25 Desktop\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\ndrwx------+ 10 cksum  staff   340 17 Aug 23:35 Documents\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\ndrwx------+  8 cksum  staff   272 29 Aug 11:24 Downloads\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\ndrwx------@ 55 cksum  staff  1870 26 Aug 21:15 Library\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\ndrwx------+  6 cksum  staff   204 29 Aug 02:02 Movies\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\ndrwx------+  7 cksum  staff   238  7 Jan  2011 Music\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\ndrwx------+ 10 cksum  staff   340  8 Aug 15:31 Pictures\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\ndrwxr-xr-x+  8 cksum  staff   272  9 Jan  2010 Public\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 29 cksum  staff   986 28 Aug 15:08 Sites\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n\nIn the above example, you can see that I am the owner and the group those directories belong to is \"staff\", which I am a part of. Then you can see that each one has the same ACE, in this case, not everyone can delete the directory. So if we put it all together, there are no ACEs that protect the directories from read or write, but there is no that protects it from deletion, so that you either have to be the owner, or part of that group to delete it. It is also of note that ACEs are ordered lists, in that, the first rule hit is the one that applies, and all the rest get ignored. For example, if you had a rule that allowed write to a file, and then one that prevented write right after it, the file would be writeable.\nACLs were introduced in Tiger and remain largely unchanged. Ars Technica has a terrific rundown on how they work (they supersede chmod btw) and how to manage them: http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2005/04/macosx-10-4.ars/8\nAnd it is of note that OS X's Repair Permissions command only repairs system files critical for the operation of the OS, not user files.\n\nA: Last time I had such a problem a check disk helped. Since you mentioned ”crashed” and alternative operating systems: Could it be that the disk is marked as dirty?\n\nA: I had a similar situation when I tried to access system files of a NAS drive through my iMac. As @jm666 already pointed out this happens due to ACLs. When you create a user in Mac he/she gets a unique ID(uid) in the range of 500+. You can find your current uid by running,id on the Terminal.app. However Linux uids starts at 1000(e.g. Ubuntu).\nIf all the other solutions didn't work you can try to create a new user on your Mac and a group with a id similar to linux user and you should be able to access all the files with read/write permissions.\nHere are the steps you should follow.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the System Preferences and create a new user (e.g. kevin)\n\n*Open the Terminal.app(/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)\n\n*Run id kevin to find kevin's uid. \n\n*Run sudo dscl . -change /Users/kevin UniqueID 504 1000 (assuming his current uid = 504)\n\n*Change the owner of kevin's home directory by running sudo chown -R 1000 /Users/kevin.\n\n*Login as kevin and access your linux files.\n\n", "Q: How to get \"out\" of the full screen in applications on iPhone? I'm often using some news applications (like WP.PL) which sometimes enter in full screen mode on my iPhone. It means all the buttons dissapear and there's only text/photos to read. Swiping left/right switches between news but all I would like to do is to get out of the full screen and continue reading with ability to change categories etc.\nI tried multiple options and 99% of times it gets out of full screen mode but it's more of a random pushing the glass (multiple times) than actually \"knowing\" how to leave full screen. \nIs there some sort of finger combination for all applications or is per app setting I have to leave with ?\n\nA: It's a per app setting. but most app follow the standard settings.\ntry tapping once in the middle on the screen and see if the controls now show up.\n", "Q: Network Shares disappeared after adding shared volume to boot items I wanted to add a have a network share mount on boot so I added it to the users boot items.

Are there pre-made charging stations? Should I just buy a surge protector with a ton of plugs? Do you have any other idea or advice? \nI wanted to have a single computer to synchronize all the iPads. Will I have to synchronize them individually? If not, how many iPods can be synchronized at the same time? \nI have 12 iPads I need to charge and synchronize. How can I do this efficiently and attractively?\n\nA: Datamation offers a multi-charge/sync setup now, and apparently Parat solutions has one in the works.\nIf you're looking to build your own, the Datamation unit uses a Cambrionix C3 board with 16 USB ports for charging and syncing. You could integrate it into your own solution. \nYou could also just get a 12+ port USB charger, however charging and syncing may take significantly longer this way.

I'd like to set up my own custom kinds to make it easier to sort files in Finder views.\nI know that I can use the Get Info palette to customize which application opens a file but that's not exactly what I'm talking about.\nReally, the problem is I work with a lot of source files in plain/text format and as a result they all end up being displayed as TextWrangler Text File.\nThing is, I do prefer having TextWrangler be their default application, I just want them to have a more descriptive Kind is all.\nClarification Kinds basically describe the nature of the file, distinct from the extension. In the old days of System 7, they were stored as special metadata attached to the file. Not sure what the mechanism is in OS X. But basically, you can add the \"Kind\" column to your list view and it will basically describe what that file is. I'd like to be able to create or set up custom Kinds, to make it easier to sort by that column.\nMore details\nThe main place I'd be using this is not the Finder but Cyberduck, which appears to use the Kind column and only the Kind column for sorting by file type. So obviously if I could customize the Kinds available that'd make it easier to sort within CyberDuck. So I suppose if someone knows a hack to make CyberDuck sort files by extension, that'd work too.\n\nA: You could make new CFBundleDocumentTypes entries in  /Applications/TextWrangler.app/Contents/Info.plist.

Sadly, Gmail will only do this for POP3, but after a quick Google, it appears some of the links on this page may be useful for that purpose (though I can't vouch for any of them in particular).

One way you overcome this with print is you put a coloured film over the text you're reading - and it really amazing how it improves their comprehension and their fluency (you can see an example of the overlay here).\nI'm looking for a way to 'tint' the screen with software in the same manner on the mac. There is a windows solution, and a paid solution, but I'm looking for a free, cheap or built in way to achieve the same result. I've googled, and found a couple discussions but no solution. \nAre any of you aware of any software or system preferences I can use to either: \n\n\n*\n\n*tint the whole screen a colour (ideal)\n\n*change the background colour of windows / documents to one similar to the tint (better than nothing)\n\n*achieve a comparable result. \nIf you have dyslexia and have found a workaround for this challenge I'd be really grateful for your input as well!\nI thought that this would be achievable with the color setting in System Preferences but I don't think it allows the tinting sense. I might be wrong though. \nThanks for your help!\n\nA: I would suggest that you look at Nocturne:  \n\nIt allows you to invert the screen colors and create a night mode, which is much easier on the eyes.  It is also under the apache license, so open source and free to use.  \n\nA: I don't use it for this, but it's one of the options available in Black Light.  You might also be able to create a custom color profile (System Preferences > Displays > Color > Calibrate...) in expert mode, but unless you can do it just by tweaking the color temperature or gamma then it'll probably require some expertise to adjust the color curves.\n\nA: I know this may be a bit off-topic, but have you checked out this font for dyslexics\n?\n\nA: I don't know if this is what you are looking for (and this is an old thread so you might have already found a solution) - I have dyslexia and find that a coloured overlay helps me read so I created a small, open source Java program to create an overlay on screen. It can be found here. Hope this helps\n\nA: Try   -8. That should invert the colors.\n\nA: I have been looking for the same thing. So far the only solution I have been able to come up with is only applicable in Word. If you go to Format and Background you can change the colour of the \"paper\". This setting does not apply during printing so you won't accidentally waste all your ink. \nI know I have the ability to get software free through my university, though I don't know if it serves this function — have you contacted the suppliers to see if they will offer your school free/discount services?\nMaybe you could contact the British Dyslexia association about this sort of thing. \n\nA: I noticed that this is an old thread so you might already found a solution. Although it doesn't fully change the whole screen's colour (it's more like a reading bar with tinted colour), the app Overlays! is a completely free app that enables to partially change the background colour. It is customizable so you can change the overlay colour and its opacity.

Is it an LCD or an older CRT monitor? \n\n*I was thinking this could be an issue with the monitor overheating and switching off, but it's currently not the summer where you are. Does the monitor have a fan that stopped working?  \n\n*Does this happen when you boot into another user? What about if you boot onto another volume? \n\n\nA: Ok so I bit the bullet and took it into an Apple reseller repair shop, who (after 7 days) identified that there was a known defect with the motherboards in my range of macbooks, so it was covered with zero cost.\n", "Q: Convert a partition from case-sensitive to case-insensitive I have installed snow leopard on a macbook ans selected case-sensitive file system when partitioning the disk, presuming that it's a standard thing and I'd rather have this system behaving as close as possible to *nix shell.\nAlthough when trying to install Photoshop CS5 recently I got an error message saying that case-sensitive file system cannot be used for installation. Apparently reason is some issues in Apple installer system, which Adobe developers cannot find their way around.\nSo it looks like I will have to convert the case-sensitive FS to a case-insensitive one.\nAre there any tools capable of doing that? Doesn't have to run under macos, anything will do, really (bootable CDs etc)\n\nA: I don't believe its possible to convert your file system once this is selected. The reason you can't convert is because of the possibility of file name duplicates. All you can do is clone the drive to an external HFS+ that isn't case sensitive and then format your internal drive. And clone it back to the internal. \nI would recommend using Carbon Copy Cloner for its ease of use and the fact its free. \n\nA: There is a FUSE solution called ciopfs (case insensitive on purpose file system).\nI quote:\n\nciopfs is a stackable or overlay linux\n  userspace file system (implemented\n  with fuse) which mounts a normal\n  directory on a regular file system in\n  case insensitive fashion.\n\nThis may be what you're looking for.\n\nA: It is possible to migrate a case sensitive file system onto a case insensitive file system if you don't have name like:\n/directory/file\n/directory/FILE\n\nin which case these 2 files should be copied with the same name\nthus causing an overwriting. Any decent program to propose this file\nsystem migration should warn you about this name collision.\nIf Adobe Photoshop refuses to install on a case sensitive file system\nthis is coming from an internal protection to avoid crashes.\nThe truth is that Adobe Photoshop\nwas never written to take care of the case of internal file names.\nThis is the reason why Adobe Photoshop will never run on Linux, OpenBSD,\nFreeBSD or any other Unix.\nAdobe never considered quality of software and security as serious\nbusiness objectives.\nTheir recent scandal with customers accounts is the due reward of such a bad care.\nThis is a shame.\nBut…\nyou have the freedom to pay to support them in this way.\n\nA: iPartition claims to be able to do this (for HFS+, not APFS), although I haven't tried it (and it costs money).\nUpdate: Coriolis Systems has shut down, and made iPartition free (although donations are welcome); see the Museum section here for the software and license key. Personally, I applaud this; it's better for everyone when discontinued software is made free rather than unavailable.\n\nA: I converted the default case-sensitive HFS+ partition to a case insensitive one after discovering the problem after installing a new MacBook.  I assume here that you have enough disk space on your internal hard drive to duplicate the data and system files that you already have installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Disk Utility to shrink the size of your existing boot partition to just big enough to contain the existing files.  \n\n*Create a new partition that is only Mac OS (Journaled) and is NOT case sensitive.\n\n*Backup the original drive to the new partition.  I used SuperDuper! but you can use rsync.\n\n*Boot holding down the Command key and select the new partition.  \n\n*Delete the old partition with Disk Utility and increase the size of the new one. \n\n\nA: Update on iPartition.  Over the weekend I used v. 3.6.2 to convert the 1 TB internal flash drive on a MacBook Pro running Sierra (10.12.6) from case-sensitive to case-insensitive.  As noted above, you have to make a separate bootable disk with iPartition on it.  Since recent macOS installs require so much room, Coriolis Systems deleted the option for generating a DVD for boot several versions back.  I used an external clone of my system drive.  \nSince you are booting off a new disk, you have to re-activate iPartition after rebooting, so make sure to copy the license image (a png with a QR code on it) over to the external bootable drive as well as the app.\nOnce booted on the external drive, it was simple to select the filesystem for conversion, uncheck the box for \"Case Sensitive\", and click Go.  After maybe 15 minutes, it was done.  Rebooting off the internal drive worked fine, as did all of the apps I tried for a quick test.\nA few caveats:  iPartition does not currently support the new AFS, so it will NOT run on High Sierra (10.13). It does not support CoreStorage, so if your drive in encrypted by FileVault 2, you have to turn off FileVault and wait until the decryption process runs to completion before you start. If you have a Fusion drive, you're out of luck.  Also, it warns you that if you have any files in a directory with names differing only by case, it will rename one of them as part of the conversion.\nAll in all, it was a fairly easy process, and well worth the price of the software.\n", "Q: Sporadically slow WiFi connection on MacBook Sporadically, but frequently, the WiFi connection on my MacBook gets exceedingly slow. I'll be browsing around with no problem one minute, and then the next, everything will slow to a crawl. I can't figure out any rhyme or reason to it. It seems to fix itself if I turn WiFi off and back on again, but that could just be my imagination...and even if so, it doesn't last.\nTwo things that make this weirder: one, my iPhone will continue working fine when the MacBook's WiFi craps out, even if they're right next to each other (so that would seem to rule out interference). Two, the WiFi on the MacBook never drops - it just gets very slow. Yet, while it's doing this, the WiFi status icon will show full strength, and Network Diagnostics will report that everything is normal.\nAny ideas or anything I can try, please let me know!\n\nA: Turns out the cause of this was...the baby monitor! If the monitor is on and close to the MacBook, it apparently interferes with the wifi. If I simply move it far enough away, that seems to resolve the interference.\n", "Q: How I retrive a lost password without changing or resetting it I have Facebook on my iPhone and it works well because it has the password stored on it so I don't have to put it in every time I log in. Now I want to use Facebook on my new computer, but I forgot the password since I don't have to enter it each time I log in.\nI really don't want to change the password because I have done that before and keep mixing them up.\nSome one help me please.\n\nA: Passwords on iOS are stored in a keychain, like in your MacBook. Here are sevaral possibilies, but honestly, I've never tried any.\n\n\n*\n\n*Retrieve the keychain from the iPhone backup - when you backing up your iPhone, the keychain is backed up too. This backup is encrypted, so you will need unlock it. Instructions on how to do this can be found elsewhere on the Internet.\n\n*Both phones are already jailbroken - the easier way, if you know unix, ssh and command line, but probably this is not your case, and you would void the phone's warranty.\nSo, it is not an easy task to get access to your girlfriend's Facebook account. ;) /joke/\n", "Q: How to quickly jump to another application without using command tab I am trying to do a screencast and I use ⌘+⇥ to move from browser to my IDE . During editing I need to remove all the screenshots of me moving from one app to another since that is distracting.\nI was wondering if there is any utility I can buy or if there is a trick so that I can quickly move from my browser to my IDE. \nNote that my browser and my IDE are of the same size while doing screencasting so they overlap each other. I just need a trick so that browser comes to the top just like that and when I need IDE to the top I can bring IDE to the top with some key combinations on my keyboard.\n\nA: If you press ⌘+⇥ quickly, you switch to the last app used and the icons don't show up.\nTo make sure it works, ⌘+⇥ to your browser. Then to your IDE. Then, quickly press the ⌘+⇥ shortcut. You'll immediately switch to the browser. Do the same again to immediately switch back.\nHope this does it for you.\n\nA: Just tested this and it works well. \nYou will be able to launch each app with a keyboard shortcut of its own by using nothing more than two simple Automator Services, and the Built in keyboard shortcuts.\nIn this example I am using Preview and Safari.\nCreate to new Automator Services.\nOpen Automator and choose 'Service'\nFirst Service.\n1,Add a 'Launch Application' action.\n2, set the Actions application to 'Preview'  by using the drop down in the action.\n3,  set Service receives to:  'no input' in 'Safari' \n(Do this by using the drop downs at the top.)\n4, save the Service As Launch Preview\n\nSecond Service.\nUse the menu file ->New.\nAnd again choose 'Service'\n1,Add a 'Launch Application' action.\n2, set the Actions application to 'Safari'  by using the drop down in the action.\n3,  set Service receives to:  'no input' in 'Preview' \n(Do this by using the drop downs at the top.)\n4, save the Service As Launch Safari\n\nSystem Preferences\nNow open System Preferences -> Keyboard.\nGo to the Tab:Keyboard Shortcuts\n1, Select 'Services' in the left hand pane.\n2, In the right hand pane, scroll down to the bottom where 'General' services should be.\nYou should see your two new services.\n3, Double click the blank white space in front of the service name.

And will not be called when in a third application..\n\nA: There are a number of utilities out there that can launch applications with a key combination. I use Butler, and I used to use DragThing, but there are quite a few out there. These utilities generally allow you to assign a key combination to launching anything. If this is an application and the application is already running, then they'll simply bring that application to the foreground.\n\nA: In BetterTouchTool, you can assign F1, F2 keys to switch between apps, or whichever series of keys you want.  \nFor a more sophisticated example of how I use BetterTouchTool:\nI've change F1, F2 to be Google Chrome Tab 1, and Google Chrome Tab 2, respectively.  And F11 and F12 to be Sublime Text Tab1, and Sublime Text Tab2, respectively.  \nYou can assign key/key combinations to specific applications made by Script Editor, ie Applescripts.\nSimple applescript to open Google Chrome Tab 1: \n    tell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\n    keystroke \"1\" using {command down}\n    end tell\n\nSave the script as an application, and then link a shortkey in Bettertouchtool to box \"Trigger Predefined Action\", once the box opens, scroll down to \"Controlling Other Applications\" and click the arrow for \"Open Application/File..\" \nCheers!\n\nA: If you really don't want to use ⌘+⇥, instead try ctrl+F4 perhaps?\n\nA: You can use ⌘+space to quickly find programs, but for quick switching you may want to check out BetterTouchTool.\nSee this page on superuser for more details.\n", "Q: How can I open FLAC files in iTunes without doing any kind of conversion? I have done this before but it no longer works. Some combination of the XiphQT component and the FLAC Import component allows one to open FLAC files natively in iTunes. After an update I was no longer able to open FLAC files in iTunes. If this was directly related or not I do not know.\nI've tried Fluke, which has been no help, especially since the SetOGG script no longer works on Mac OSX 10.6.\nHere is the link for the XiphQT component: http://www.xiph.org/quicktime/download.html\nThe other component is called FLAC importer, available here:\nhttp://people.xiph.org/~arek/flac_import/\nPS: I use the FLAC files (all of which are legitimate rips or downloads to mix with. Keeping an extra copy of each in ALAC, MP3 or AAC format would just be a terrible waste).\nConclusion\nThe situation is pretty much helpless. iTunes will never support FLAC and it's unlikely that ALAC will be supported in all DJ'ing software (which is of particular interest to me and is why I asked the question).

So...I have an iPad and MacBook Pro. \nI bought my iPad because I thought I needed it but now I'm thinking to sell it since I just found out that Xcode offers an iOS simulator. \nIs it possible to develop a fully working iOS app without actual test hardware?\n\nA: Clearly: No. The simulator does not offer hardware access (gyroscope, accelerometer, etc.) and also, you just don't get the feeling for your App, which is very important in iOS development. You can't use the gestures and you don't know how it reacts if you work with it. so it is definitely not advisable. I tried to use the simulator in the beginning, but some frameworks don't even run on it.\n\nA: well, it is possible, but you won't be able to do the on device testing. You can develop all iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod) and mac applications on mac computer/ laptop; you can test those apps on simulator as well, but for actual testing on device - you need these devices, as simple as that.\nSo finally, it is possible but it won't be assuring you the quality/ performance of the app unless you test on physical device.\nI hope I've been able to help. :)\nBRs\n-Sudeep\nAgicent Technologies\n\nA: Yes, it is possible, but in most cases it's not a good idea. You can certainly use the app and use a lot of things, but -as already mentioned- some frameworks are not present on the Simulator.\nOne of the notably absent frameworks is the InApp purchases, so if you're targeting that, you won't be able to simulate it (I haven't tried in Xcode 4 tho, but I'm sure it doesn't work).\nAlso already mentioned are GPS, Accelerometer, Cameras, etc. You can't have those (off the record, as bad as Android 'Simulator' is, you can certainly use some of those in the Android Sim).\nIs it recommended? It depends. Nothing will give you better feedback about your app than a real device, however, for certain simple applications, the simulator is definitely more than enough.\nConsider (use Google) which features you need for your app, and then take your decision based upon what's available. Don't underestimate the Simulator, but don't try to replace a real device with it because you'll be disappointed.\nIf you're targeting iPhone and iPad, you'll want to have both, the UI feels (and should) be different.\n", "Q: What is the best Homebrew version for an iBook running Tiger? I have an old iBook running Mac OS Tiger, and I want to install the Homebrew package manager on it. Which branch should I choose ?\n\n*\n\n*The Tiger one?\n\n*The PPC one?\n\n*Another one?\n\n\nA: According to this issue, it seems like the Tiger branch is the most exactly accurate in that case.\n\nA: In this case and noting we are 10 years later I would suggest using macports instead.\nMacports continues to support all versions of osx going back to Tiger including all possible CPUS, this includes binaries for most, if not all, of these. Homebrew prefers to update itself and drop support for older OS. This makes it essentially only support recent (usually N-2) versions of macOS.\n\nA: Looks like they add PPC support on the Tiger (see this commit), but the default behavior was to redirect to the PPC branch.\nSo I'd say go to the PPC branch to be safe.\n\nYou might want to contact the developer, too.

I don't have access to my computer right now & there's an app that I really could use right now but I forgot the name of it so I can't just go to the app store and re-install it simply because I can't find it.  \nI don't, and won't have access to my computers iTunes for a few days. Otherwise I could just plug in my iPhone to my PC boot up iTunes and go through my list of thousands of apps that I've purchased and sync it to my iPhone. So if anyone knows ho I can get a list from my iPhone of every app I've purchased it would be very helpful.  \n\nA: If you are running at least 4.3, you can use the iCloud beta to see every app you ever purchased. If you open the Updates tab of the app store, there should be a Purchased button at the top. Tapping on this will give you a list of every app you purchased on your current account. I would suggest choosing the \"Not on this iPhone\" tab so you don't have to look through as long of a list. Once you find the app, tap the cloud icon to download it.\n\nA: Apple primarily provides billing information via iTunes on PC and Mac. The computer that syncs the iOS device also has logs on which apps were active on certain days as part of the diagnostic logs. Without that computer, your only recourse is to ask for billing support online and leave an email / phone number. You can eventually get a human with access to your purchase records and once they are sure you are who you say you are - they might be able to pinpoint a few purchased based on time. They also may not be able to or want to help if you can't answer the questions about your account or the purchases are too numerous.\nHave you thought of the receipts apple emails you after each batch of purchases? Perhaps you can identify the seller or the app name that way. The iPhone will search messages on your mail server if your mail provider allows that so even messages in the past are easily located via mobile mail on the  iPhone or a webmail interface.\n\nA: For some reason apple hides some of your purchases, to unhide them go to itunes on your computer, then Account, then Hidden Purchases.\nYou should then be able to download these purchases or choose to unhide them so that you can access them through the normal purchase tab.\nNote: This worked for me on Mac Mountain Lion with iTunes 11\n\nA: Goto updates for apps and touch the purchased \n", "Q: Is it possible to Move a bootcamp partition from one drive to another? When I got a new MacPro last year I formatted one of the additional (i.e. non-boot) drives with Bootcamp and installed Win 7 x64 on it. This set up has been working well these last 12+ months but I recently realised that the drive I've installed Windows on is a slow WD 'Green' eco-drive. Its rather slow at times as is only really designed for backups or storage rather than heavy use (I'm a .Net developer and use VMs extensively.\nSo what I'd like to now is move the Bootcamp partition onto the boot drive that came with the machine and keep everything running as it currently is.

I've done a number of things lately like relocate masters, regenerate thumbnails, etc. but I can't pin it down to a specific date and besides I was fairly certain that the ratings metadata was stored separately from all of that. I'm trying to avoid having to restore the library from Time Machine.\n\nA: To keep the answer general enough for anyone - I'll add some precautionary steps that you can ignore as appropriate.\n\n\n*\n\n*You might want to set up a vault\nto back things up as they are or\nkick off a backup before trying to\nrepair the database.\n\n*The sure thing is to recover from a backup before the database got corrupt. The ratings are stored in files separate from the images so there are three repair/rebuild options. See the Aperture Troubleshooting article. It's unlikely the file with the ratings lost read permission, but that would be ideal and rapid to fix. The other options are less \"safe\" when the database is corrupt and could result in losing work or making the system worse. It's not designed to make things worse - but it's a rare occurrence and your library is broken so even the best attempts to fix it could hurt and not help.\n\n*Lastly - you will have to restore from TimeMachine (or an Aperture Vault if you set that up) and re-import or re-perform the changes since that back up.\n\n\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: huge Chrome Time Machine backups My 1TB Time Machine drive just filled up, apparently due a bug in Chrome.

I've modified the answer so the exclusion path is more specific than what I use. Honestly though: just sync your Chrome settings to your Google Account and then you don't need Time Machine to do this for you and you can just blanket exclude everything under ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome.\nJust exclude the offending directories under ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome from the Time Machine backups.\nIn more recent versions of Chrome/OS X, some of these folders may be located in:\n/Users/$USER/Library/Caches/Google/\n\nTo do this...\nClick on the Time Machine icon in your task bar and select Open Time Machine Preferences... or go to System Preferences -> Time Machine.\nIn the preferences pane click the Options... button.\nClick the + button to the bottom right of the Exclude these items from backups: list.\nIn the Finder window that pops up navigate to ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default and then select the following for exclusion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Application Cache\n\n*Archived History\n\n*Archived History-journal\n\n*databases\n\n*Extensions\n\n*History (wish there was a way to put a wildcard on this)\n\n*Local Storage\n\n*Sync Data\nYou might have repeat the exclude step for each of those.

It's time to sell my previous MBP.  I've already copied off all of the data I want to keep and deleted the obvious suspects.\nWhat is the preferred approach to prepping a used Mac to be sold to an unknown third party that does not include a complete wipe and reinstall?\nIf possible, I'd like to leave the activated programs on it. (Perhaps, that is a horrible idea and contrary to prepping for resale.)\nIs it enough to create a new user, log in as that user and delete the previous user?\nI apologize for the basic question; I realize the nuclear option is probably the recommendation, but I'm thinking it would help my resell value to leave the activated software in place.\n\nA: After creating new user and deleting the old one, at least wipe free space to remove securely your data. However, a lot of data can be retrieved from remaining (for example temporary) files. So that the only secure option is full wipe. And remember to unpair your hardware from any other devices/network services (Bluetooth, MAC address etc).\n\nA: If you are really concerned with the next owner recovering your files, which can be done even if you emptied the Trash, then you should format the drive:\nOpen Disk utility, select the drive, select the erase tab and click on security options, then choose one othe following:  \n \nI don't know why the sale doesn't include a wipe and reinstall, but I don't see why it shouldn't as a mac always comes with a licensed OS, you just format the drive and reinstall MacOS and you're done.\nYou can't erase the drive you are currently booted to. You have to boot from an external drive with Mac OS X installed, or boot from the Install DVD.\n\nA: You should wipe and reinstall. Reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*personal info. Anybody can attach your Mac in target disc mode and copy the whole HDD for later analysis. Even if a file is removed by emptying the Trash, or via the \"rm\" unix command, there is a possibility to recover it (because it deleted only the reference to HDD sectors and not wiped the sectors).\n\n*applications - If you have any applications, you probably want to use them later too. If you sold the MacBook with them, the buyer will use them too - double install usually means disabling your legal activation key.\n\n*with clean reinstall, you delete everything - for example /Library/Application support too, where much applications saving some infos (non personal, but anyway).\n\n*another example - the logfiles in the /var/log directory. Here are tons of informations that can be gained from them (for example mail addresses) and so on...\n\n*erasing the Home directory is simply not enough (see above).\n\n*as @Petruza already said - the only way is to wipe the whole HDD and reinstall the OS X.\n\nA: You can erase your hard drive by putting in your Mac OS X Install DVD, and boot from there.

You can then run all updates and leave things just as you wish and restore a first boot experience to the new buyer.\nDo remember to deauthorize iTunes on that machine, unpair bluetooth and networks / forget network passwords. If you wish to be exceptionally thorough, you might delete old log files and crash reports. The console app will let you poke around and see if any cause you concern. I wouldn't just delete the entire directory (as some of these directories have special permissions and the system will fail in hard to realize and fix ways if the directory containing a log file is missing.) Typically the log file itself will get recreated at next boot, but the programs that maintain the files generally assume the directories have been set up properly and they won't make entire directories. Just realize you are mucking around in the bowels of the unix system my modifying or deleting these files and directories may make the mac you sell less stable or cause issues to the new owner who may be ill equipped to solve.\n\nA: When we sell our old macs at work on, I use a data shredder and do a clean install of the OS.

If I sleep the display again (with hot corners) and wake it up again it's fine. Anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: I have had the same problem with Maverick (in clamshell mode) / external monitor (Samsung SyncMaster 2443) when I lock my screen and use my bluetooth mouse or keyboard to wake up the computer. \nI was able to fix the problem in 2 ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*open the lid, login and unplu, replug the external monitor (pretty annoying)\n\n*when the multicolor static shows, press CTRL+SHIFT+Eject as if to lock the computer again, then wake up the computer again and I now have the normal login screen as normal (not ideal but less disruptive solution).\n\n\nI hope this helps !\n\nA: Since the mac engages the graphics card with the same precision each time you wake from sleep, it's likely a timing issue on the monitor. (I loose or noisy cable could have the same effect, but much less likely and you would probably have other issues if that were he case)\nHave you seen if you can reduce the number of settings the monitor has to scan on detecting a new signal.\nYou can test this by power cycling the monitor the next time it happens.\n\nA: This happens to me with an external monitor connected via HDMI. I've found that it usually resolves itself by removing the DP -> HDMI adapter and re-plugging it in again.\n\nA: The is a firmware update that can help resolve this issue:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201158 \nOne reason I think it occurred for me is the adapter that was in use. \nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Official OSX client for Twitter, https? Does the official OSX client for Twitter (the one available in the App Store) use https? I'm unable to find any info about this on the Twitter site and my searches aren't turning up much either.\n\nA: wireshark says yes, the Twitter OSX client is using https.\n\n199.59.148.139    TLSv1   Server Hello, Certificate, Server Hello Done\n\nI did not check if it has anything to do with the https account settings, so it might use http if you didn't opt-in for https.\n", "Q: Connections to some sites time out from OS X but not from Windows, how to diagnose? For the past couple of weeks I have noticed some sites take longer to finish loading. GMail would be one example; after the site is loaded and fully usable, the spinning indicator in Chrome’s tabs will remain for a couple of minutes. Safari behaves the same. Right now reddit doesn’t load at all. Pinging www.reddit.com results in 100% packet loss. Their address resolves to an Akamai IP, so if everything delivered via Akamai is timing out, that would explain why quite a lot of sites are affected.\nLoading those same sites from my boot camp partition works like a charm, same goes for my iPod, so the router as well as the ISP can be ruled out as the reason for this. What can iIdo now to diagnose the problem?\n\nA: \"Do pages often \"stall\" and then time out halfway through loading? (And then you hit the \"stop\" button, and refresh, and magically, they appear?) I just had this happen, and fixed it by manually turning \"off\" IPV6 (from the default setting of \"Automatic\") in the Advanced area of the Network settings control panel. \"\nI found this tip to work in conjunction with setting my DNS to google or freeDNS.\n\nA: Safari has a debug option to let you inspect the hundreds of elements that have to load for large sites. \nLook at the timeline and errors parts first. \nAlso, you might want to check for any extensions or other toolbars or code that runs within safari to filter the data before safari renders your page. \nA third tip would be to make a new user on the Mac to be sure cookies or local storage on the Mac isn't contributing to the gmail wep app problems. \n", "Q: Is there an iPad app to play movies from an SD card? Is there an iPad application which is capable of playing iPad compatible movie files from an SD card via the Apple Camera Connection Kit?\nI prefer App Store apps, no jailbreak apps please.\n\nA: The \"Camera Connection Kit\" is called that for a specific reason. The USB and SD Card readers are meant to either directly connect your camera to it, or just the SD card from it.\nThis means also that the readers only function with the Photos application, and nothing else. This is also the reason why most external keyboards don't work anymore.\nThere is no SDK access to the Camera Connection Kit, so third-party apps may not use it.\nIIRC, Movies taken by your camera are imported into the Photos app as well. I do not recall whether or not you can view them from within the Photos app.\n\nA: This looks like what I was searching for:\nzoomIt \nIt's a piece of hardware that connects to the iPad. With their application you can then access SD cards. According to their app description you can:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*display/view a file with a format supported by SDK3.0 or higher\n  \n\nUnfortunately it costs another 60$ and I already bought the Apple Camera Connection Kit.\nIf anybody tested watching movies with this thing a little comment is very welcome.\n", "Q: How Do I Uninstall Google Voice Voicemail from an iPhone? I installed Google Voice Voicemail on my wife's iPhone, thinking she would like it. You know, the thing where you put in the funky long set of numbers and dial somewhere, and kapoof, you now have Google Voice Voicemail instead of iPhone voicemail.\nNow she tells me she doesn't like it, and wants to go back to the old Apple iPhone Voicemail. How do I revert this back?\n\nA: Simply turn off voicemail for calls to google voice using the web interface for that google voice number.\n\nIf you activated the carrier settings like in the image below, click the instructions to reverse those changes with the carrier. You could also call your carrier for help since it's a feature that has different commands on a per-carrier basis. They will be most familiar with their settings and order to undo the change if Google doesn't help undo it.\n\nWithout your carrier forwarding all calls to Google, you can still keep Google Voice and have both voicemail systems separate. \nThat will simply forward the call and let the iPhone and carrier handle the voicemail.\nLastly, you don't have to delete the google app for this to work, but that might make things simpler if your wife doesn't want to call out using the Google Voice number anymore.\n", "Q: Is it possible to set restrictions on any iOS app? I want to put a passcode restriction on the Video app (and others), but the options I see in Settings are only for a few things. Is there a way, native or third party, to do this?\n\nA: iOS only allows you to block built in applications and features, and age-rated apps from the App Store.\nIf you jailbreak, there is a tool for specifically locking apps individually called iProtect on the Cydia Store. However, it costs $8.99.\n\nA: Apple provides an iPhone Configuration utility Mac application that allows installing various restrictions on an iOS device from the Mac.  It's an Enterprise utility, but you don't need to be an enterprise to use it.\n", "Q: Can 2010 MacBook Pro power 2 daisy chained FW800 external HDs? I have a 15 inch MacBook Pro (model MacBookPro6,2) with 2.66 gHz Intel Core i7 and 8 GB RAM from mid 2010.\nRight now, I use a LaCie Firewire 800 bus powered Little Big Disk Quadra which works well. There are two Firewire 800 ports on the Little Big Disk Quadra, so I am wondering if I can daisy chain another Firewire 800 bus powered external hard drive to it? Will the MacBook Pro be able to power both?\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes - I have routinely used up to 4 self powered devices one one FireWire port.\nTom's hardware report that at idle most laptop sized spinning hard drives use less than 1.5W idle and less than 4W at peak - so firewire should start to run out of power between 8 to 10 drives chained together assuming your mac is putting out at least 80% of the design power and they don't all spin up at exactly the same time.\n\nA: Yes this will work. That's the point of firewire, being able to chain multiple devices off the single port. You might see some data speed slowdown if both devices are accessing the bus at the same time. But at 800mbit you'd have to be doing something pretty hectic for it to be noticeable. \nEDIT: \nAccording to Wikipedia each port should give you 45Watts of power, which should be enough to drive a second bus powered device. \n", "Q: Reinstalling OS X server on headless Mac mini I have just started the Mac Server Essentials certification course and I'm stuck at chapter 1!\nI have a MacBook Pro, a Mac mini server and a WiFi router as a switch between the two. I don't have it connected to my home network yet because I will be going through a lot of different exercises playing with services, installing/reinstalling etc.\nSo how do I do a clean reinstall over an existing install of the server OS if I don't have a separate display and keyboard. Every remote solution I can find first involves booting the mini from an external optical or USB drive which requires a keyboard and display attached to the mini.\nIn reality I could attach them, but I'm trying to learn how to do it in a real life situation where it might not be possible.\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: Start the Mac Mini in Target mode. You'll need a keyboard, hold down the \"t\" key as it boots. \nConnect the mac mini to your MBP with a firewire cable.\nBoot the MBP and hold down the option key. \nSelect the  macmini as the startup disk. You should be able to install and configure the mac mini. Then just shutdown and disconnect everything. then restart the mac mini on its own.\nMake sure the mini is set to connect to your wireless. So when you boot the machine on its own it connects right away. Also be sure to enable remote desktop access.\nThis is how I setup my macmini recently.\n\nA: I've had to set up dozens of Mac OS X servers over the years, and in real life, I've never come across a time when I couldn't find a keyboard, mouse and display to at least temporarily connect to a server machine for the initial install. If you're studying this in order to learn how to handle real life situations, I wouldn't recommend concentrating on this one. In twenty years of working with Mac servers, it's never come up for me.\n\nA: Pages 13, 14 and 15 of the installation manual try to explain the concept of remote installation. Basically, the headless mini can rely on server admin running elsewhere to initiate and configure the installation.\nhttp://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Mac_OSX_Server_v10.6_Worksheet.pdf\nYou simply need the IP address and the serial number of the mini (for authentication) and to prepare the mac in target mode for the erase / install. You may need a keyboard temporarily if the mini is no longer bootable and cannot be accessed via ssh.\nEverything runs from the server admin tools on any Mac on the local network. Ethernet is best so you don't have to join a WiFi network and can temporarily connect a keyboard to get it in target mode and then disconnect everything (except the network) while the install proceeds.\nDeploy Studio is also nice for network installs - once you are familiar with the steps, you can navigate with a keyboard only and no display. This is more work to set up than the Apple method (especially for the first install) - but once it's set up, you can automate large deployments with great ease and speed.\n", "Q: iOS iTunes latest podcasts not showing up On my iPod touch running iOS 4.1, the iTunes store app (purple note icon) lets me search for podcasts and download episodes. In my RSS feeds I often see a new podcast episode announced, so I load up the podcast in iTunes and inevitably the most recent episode is absent. Has anyone else experienced this problem, and are there any solutions to this? besides:\n\n\n*\n\n*use Instacast\n\n*sync to PC/Mac iTunes\n\n*wait a few days for it to show up\n\n\nA: I hear this more and more. iTunes on the PC directly uses the RSS feed and can be downloaded immediately. The podcasts in the iTunes store are cached, meaning that a process has to go out and update it. You have no control over this. If you don't want to continuously sync with iTunes, get a podcast app for the iPod Touch. I like Podcaster though there are many others. This app like all of the others uses the direct RSS feed and can pull down the show immediately.\n", "Q: install windows 7 32-bit using boot-camp on snow-leopard I have Snow-Leopard running on my MacBook. I want to install Windows 7 32-bit Professional. I have already purchased copy of Windows from Amazon. I never'ed install Windows on my MacBook till date, so I don't know what to do, and how to install it.\nPlease share your experiences of installing Windows using Boot-Camp.\nI need screen-shots or video that can help me with installation.\n\nA: Thousands of tutorials can be found using Google or YouTube, for example:\nhttp://www.simplehelp.net/2009/01/15/using-boot-camp-to-install-windows-7-on-your-mac-the-complete-walkthrough/\nhttp://gizmodo.com/5387353/how-to-survive-boot-camp-and-run-win-7-on-a-mac\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM2495dmO0I\n", "Q: Is X11 still used today? I have had X11 installed on my Mac for quite some time (as long as I have owned it I think) and have never used it. Do applications still use X11 or is out outdated at this point? Should I \"learn\" how to use it because I may use it in the future? The reason I ask is that I read that you can run X over SSH and I thought it might be useful to run a window manager to get some graphics from a remote machine. Then I realized I have never used X11 and launched it only to become confused. So should I use X11 and why?\n\nA: X11 is still used extensively for very expensive *nix-based CAD/CAE software packages.\nI used it to run the free Gimp editor on Macs for which I couldn't justify installing Photoshop.\nBut unless you need some specific *nix software package that uses X11, there is much general need for it on a Mac.\n\nA: X11 is used for most Unix GUI apps. All Linux GUI apps use X11 and it is often the easiest way to port them to run on OSX to keep using X11. the only Linux GUI apps which don't use X11 when under a simple port are some of those using Qt and Java apps where the underlying GUI has been ported to OSX aqua.\nCommand line apps like ssh and other Unix utilities don't use a GUI and so port directly.\nYou can use Macports, Fink and Homebrew without using a X11 app - it depends on what apps you port.\n\nA: The following is a list of popular programs that require X11:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gimp - open source photo editing\n\n*Inkscape - open source vector drawing program\n\n*FreeCiv - open source version of the Civilization games\n\n*Scribus - open source desktop publishing software\n\n\nBasically, if you plan on using only commercial software, you don't need X11. If you plan on using open source software, you may want to keep X11 around just in case. Many open source projects used to require X11 but now have native Mac versions (OpenOffice, for example).\n\nA: Yes. X11 is very much still in use as it is a very powerful windowing system and there is nothing that Apple has released that replaces the core functionality of X11.\nI wouldn't spend time learning X11 in the abstract until you have a need to produce code that runs on X11 or you need to run software that is written for X11.\nIn a nutshell - it is a very flexible client/server system. The server runs where the keyboard and mouse and display are. The client is the program running locally or remotely on a different computer. For example I can run protein folding engines on large servers that are in a university across the country (or world) and interact with the user interface in a cafe on my MacBook Pro.\nI have a choice of a wide variety of window managers to use. The virtual and extended desktop concepts in X11 are very different than Mac's typical you only get a screen if something is physically connected or enable spaces.\nThere are several downsides in that the system is different and to use it, you have to do some learning. Also - it doesn't map perfectly to Apple - cut and paste can be disorienting, mouse buttons have different functions, keyboard mapping can be tricky, and the uniformity of the Mac interface is disturbed as most X11 programs come with a wide variety of widgets. Even the most die hard fan of X11 chrome has to admit that a lot of it is \"quaint\" and some of it is really hard to use for people that expect the Macintosh user interface experience. (This is more of a culture thing - some countries have delicacies that are off-putting to others - it's not right or wrong - just different heritages and long assumptions on how something is \"supposed to be done\".)\nCheers and good luck!\n\nA: Yes.\nI personally don't use it because I have Linux installed beside Mac OS X.  But many of my coworkers and fellow students use X11 in Mac OS X frequently.  This is largely because we need to do plotting a lot, and so we use Gnuplot quite often.  Gnuplot has a Mac native terminal (GUI) (I think), but it's no match for its X11 and wx (requires X11) terminals.\nAlso many other cool stuff (usually cross-platform programs) require X11, for example Wireshark, Audacity (a wave editor), and Inkscape (an awesome vector image editor), etc.  Of course Audacity and Inkscape both have their Mac OS X native equivalent, but most of them are large and expansive.\n\nA: Hm. It is interesting to see how much linux-users converted into OS X world. Here is my 0.02$. (as a heavy Linux user in past).\n\n\n*\n\n*When me converting into OS X (from Linux - approx 6-7 years ago) I started using heavily X11 based applications, simply because i know them much more than X.\n\n*today, I have only ONE application installed what is X11 based and using it sometime - gimp - because I don't want spend much money for a photoshop. Anyway, because i'm not an photo-editor-expert, maybe will find some easy-to-use freeware native cocoa app and will throw gimp out too.\n\n*X11 is really very powerful. Its base design is 30 years old and this showing how stable it is. But have a cost (pros) too - but this answer is not the right place discuss them.\n\n*So, if you have NATIVE variants of your applications, you probably will not need to use it.\n\n*Maybe will need to use it, when:\n\n\n*\n\n*you haven't native version of some app, what is exists for X11\n\n*you are in heavy X11 envinroment, where is a common way executing things like xterm --display somecomp:0 or soo...\n\n\n\nA: I do web-dev and media stuff and I personally think there's no use for X11 on a Mac as long as you're not a unix network administrator or something. There's still no native port of Wireshark, but beside that I don't use X11 at all. Beside Fink and MacPort there's also Homebrew, which is much easier than the other two and there's no X11 required.\n", "Q: How to default UTF-8 encoding in Text Encoding in Mail.app? I'm using Mail.app.\nOften times I would write on reply emails typed in foreign language (Chinese, Japanese), and the receiver will see garbled text (e.g. a bunch of ??? or squares).\nThe way I solve the problem is: before sending each of these reply email, I go to \"Message\" -> \"Text Encoding\" -> select \"Unicode *UTF-8*\". But as soon as the email is sent, text encoding is set back to \"Automatic\". On my next email, I have to set the text encoding again to UTF-8. \nThis is annoying. Is there a way to set UTF-8 as default text-encoding, and not Automatic?\n\nA: Open Terminal.app and type:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail NSPreferredMailCharset \"UTF-8\"\n\nIf it does not work, you can revert by using\ndefaults delete com.apple.mail NSPreferredMailCharset\n\n\nA: One way to ensure all your email goes out as UTF-8 is to include a Unicode dingbat or similar character in every message, as part of your signature or otherwise.\n\nA: It's really odd there is no \"standard\"/\"normal\" way to set the default encoding to a user's choice.\nBy adding a Unicode dingbat character in a signature is more like a trick. The terminal command solution is not working. Even if it's working, it's very odd for a user to set something like this.\nI can't believe Apple lets this happen.\nIt's the most annoying thing after I changed to use Mac. I have to choose the encoding every time I send an email. How ridiculous!\n", "Q: How can I encrypt photos on an iPhone 3GS/4? How can I encrypt photo files on my iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4 with a password and without any quality loss?\nIs there an app for that?\n\nA: I'm now using CryptMyPic, as it's the simplest and most secure I've found so far. \n\nA: There are several apps for that. My Eyes Only™ Photo is one that gets good reviews. \n\nA: Private Pal may do what you need, and more, with full encryption on text and large files, flexibility to create customized folders with own icons. Also supports preview for doc, xls, pdf, jpg, mp4, etc. Bulk import photos, search, fav and recent list, multi-account ...\n\nA: Ben the Bodyguard is an app that buzzed for a while. It's now available and can encrypt photos, but also contacts, passwords, notes (and probably more).\n\n\nA: This doesn't meet your criteria but it may be of interest to others searching on the topic:\nSpyPix allows you disguise one photo within another using steganography. This is by definition a lossy process. It's not encryption as we generally define it, but it's a reasonably safe way to \"hide\" a private photo in your photo libary or to share a private picture (or secret message) with a confidante. \nAt the very least, it's fun to play with.\n\nA: I have used iDiscrete for some time. It generally works well with regard to photo security although I could not find a specific call out as to whether is encrypts the photo's once secured. From their website:\n\n\nFor less than the price of a cup of coffee, iDiscrete is the most\n    fully featured privacy application available for the iPhone. Rather\n    than requiring a suspicious looking password, iDiscrete employs its\n    patent-pending Touch Sequence Protection™. This works by bringing up a\n    nondescript \"Loading\" screen upon entry to the application, which\n    registers touch input in 8 discrete locations. The user has predefined\n    their desired Touch Sequence, which can be as simple or as complicated\n    as they wish. The Loading screen will only grant access to iDiscrete\n    if the correct Touch Sequence is entered. Otherwise, when the Touch\n    Sequence Timeout expires without receiving the correct sequence, the\n    app will boot to a generic-looking text entry interface.\n\n\nThe security system is simple and straightforward to setup. A brief overview of the product can bee seen in this video. The compelling feature for me is that the application support multiple file times and is not just limited to pictures:\n\nThe application is priced reasonably at $2.99 in the Apple APP store: direct link\n", "Q: How do I change the time format used by ls command line on osx? I want to make ls display time in ISO format (military format). How can I change this behavior?\nOn Linux I knew that I could force ls to display time in long format by usin --full-time but this doesn't work on OS X.\nUpdate: I know that the format used by the command is based on the locale settings. The problem is that on OS X I was not able to use the trick of setting LC_TIME=en_DK.\n\nA: If you install gnu coreutils then gnu ls is available, which will do as required. If you use brew as a package manager, it's as simple as:\nbrew install coreutils\ngls -l --time-style=full-iso\n\n\nA: OS X's built-in ls command does not take time formatting arguments, but the stat command takes strftime format strings so you can get an approximation of what you want by doing:\nstat -l -t '%FT%T' *\n\nThe %FT%T produces an ISO8601 local timestamp. Add a %z if you want a UTC offset.\nBut while the timestamp is right, the rest only approximates what you'd get from ls. For instance, ls -l properly aligns fields into columns, can colorize output, and of course it lists directory contents rather than requiring you to pass all filenames as arguments. You can at least reproduce the proper alignment by piping the output through tr to convert all spaces into tabs:\nstat -l -t '%F%T' * | tr ' ' \\\\t\n\nAlternatively, I think it should be possible to get ls -l to produce an ISO8601 timestamp by defining a custom locale, but I have not seen it done.\n\nA: stat -l -t '%FT%T' *\n\nThat worked fine for me. I needed to see both file size and time stamp. Wonder why Apple saw fit to discard the pretty-much-standard time mod o/p from ls -l. I even hauled out my UNIX in a Nutshell!\n\nA: Using macOS Monterey 12 the following works for me:\nls -lD '%FT%T'\n\nI'm using an alias that also preserves colored output:\nalias ls=\"ls -D '%FT%T' --color=auto\"\n\n\nA: ls -l --time-style=iso works fine for me.\n", "Q: Changing keyboard input language on Mac OSX How do I change (switch) the input language in Mac OSX  (English->Russian->Hebrew).\nIn Windows it is done by pressing alt-shift. \nWhat is the equivalent in OSX ?\n\nA: The shortcuts are ⌘␣ and ⌥⌘␣ by default, but can be changed in Keyboard.prefPane:\n\n\nA: According to the Language & Text preference pane, the shortcuts are:\n⌘-space (command-space) - previous input source\n⌥⌘-space (command-option-space) - next input source\nOf course these shortcuts are already being used by Spotlight, so if you have that active they won't work.\nFortunately, you can just click the Keyboard Shortcuts button to choose the command shortcuts you'd prefer.\nEither way, you should see an Input menu in your menu bar, probably next to the battery indicator. If you don't, you need to go to \nSystem Preferences > Language & Text, click on \"Input Sources\", and check the languages you want to have added. At that point, the Input menu will show up and you'll be able to set the keyboard shortcuts.\nNote that you can also just choose the language you prefer from the Input menu if you don't care about using a keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: Go to  > System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources.\nMake sure an entry for each of 'English', 'Hebrew' and 'Russian' are checked. (I don't know which encoding you'll choose, e.g. 'Hebrew' or 'Hebrew - QWERTY'). Also ensure the uppermost box, 'Keyboard & Character Viewer' is checked.\nNow you'll have something that looks like this:\n\nYou can select your language with the mouse or you can activate keyboard shortcuts, as seen below:\n\nBoth these keyboard shortcuts are already taken by other functions. These are functions that I use far more frequently than when I want to, in my case, shift between 'Australian' and 'Thai'. So in my case it's not worth making a keyboard shortcut to switch languages. This may be different for you however.\nIf you wish to activate, say, ⌘Space, you'll first need to disown that from whatever is currently using it. In my case ⌘Space opens a Spotlight search box and I use this all the time.\n\nA: Since 2011, things have slightly changed!\n \nThe tab Shortcuts in the keyboard panel now has a new sub-section Input Sources (see screenshot). By default these are unchecked. If you enable both commands they will be available by hitting ^ ControlSpace or ^ Control⌥ OptionSpace.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to the Keyboard pane in System Preferences\n\n*Select the Input Sources tab\n\n*Click the plus button on the bottom left\n\n*Select your language\n\n*Choose the appropriate language layout\n\n\nIf you still have trouble, refer this brief tutorial : http://www.infozub.com/2013/11/how-to-change-keyboard-language-in-os-x.html\n\nA: After adding desired input sources as user63024 said, you need to check the Shortcuts tab (in my case System Preferences > Language & Region > Keyboard Preferences > Shortcuts) to check whether all your input sources are checked. \nThen you can see the shortcuts to switch between them. And of course you can change them if you want. But remember, if you see the alarm icon beside the shortcut, it means some other option uses this shortcut key already, so you have to change one of those shortcut keys as a shortcut key has to be unique.\n", "Q: Should I be worried about my iPhone overheating? There have been a few times where my iPhone (and iPod as well) has gotten slightly warmer than I would like after extensive use or a specifically  demanding app (infinity blade). Should I be worried about my iOS devices overheating?  If so what are some steps to prevent this and overall protect the device?\n\nA: Yes and no.\nThe newer iOS devices have internal temperature sensors and will let you know when the internal temperatures are so high that damage is of concern. You basically get locked out of the device until it's cool enough to run again. \nAs long as the sensor is working, it is safe to use the device up until it shuts itself off. This protection should cover you from charging or operating the device and causing harm to the components in the short term as well as drastic long term damage to the battery.\nIf you are concerned about the long term health of the battery - then yes, do worry about temperature. At 0°C - you can expect to lose between 2 and 6% of the capacity per year depending on the average charge in the battery (the lower is at 40% average charge - the higher is 100% average charge). If the temperature is 25°C - these losses jump to 4% to 20% capacity loss. If you store/use the phone for one year at 40°C which most people would consider very hot to hold - the losses in capacity are 15% to 40% annually. Charging the battery this hot or hotter is even worse for the health of the battery.\nSo, a few times of limited use under 40°C shouldn't be of concern, but leaving it in a very hot car (> 50°C) can be very damaging if it's charging or there for hours or days.\nWhenever you can keep it cooler, and not fully charged for long periods of time, your battery will degrade less over time. You can weigh the need to use the battery when warm with the eventual replacement cost of $79 if you should ever just need a battery swapped out by Apple.\n\nA: Since you used the word \"slightly\", I'd say no, you don't need to be worried.  Generally if your device gets heated when you doing some heavy duty stuff (for example like you said, playing infinity blade), I don't think it's a problem because in this case, most heat comes from the CPU, which has a fixed maximum power.  The device is designed to withstand that power and should be able properly transfer that heat to the environment (that's one purpose of the steal band around iPhone 4).\nHowever if you device is just doing nothing, and you feel it's hotter than usual, you may need to check and close some background programs.  If it's still hot, turn off the device and see if it cools down.  If not, there probably is something wrong with the battery.\n", "Q: How do I change the OS X Mouse Pointer's color? I have some visual impairment, and I often have problems finding my mouse pointer on the screen.  I want to change the color of the pointer.\nI know in \"Universal Access\" you can change the size, but it still doesn't help that the cursor 'blends in' with everything else on my screen.  I want to make my cursor bright green or red.\nI'm using OS X 10.6.7.\n\nA: Anything that allows you to change the color is paid software. Here's MightyMouse.\nUnfortunately, it looks like MightyMouse has been discontinued :(\nI would recommend this free software that displays a circle around your cursor. When you haven't moved your mouse for awhile and you move it, it'll display a circle around the pointer. Here's the software.\n\nA: I think this application may help you:\nMouseposé\n\nA: Try Omnidazzle you can not change the color, like I want to but you can see a thing round the mouse to find it by pressing a key. Try it.\n", "Q: photo recovery after iPhone \"Erase Data\" Is there any way to recover the photos from an iPhone which has been \"erased\" after several consecutive failed passcode attempts?\nUnfortunately, these photos were not backed up.  Apple techs grudgingly suggested that the data was still there...\n\nA: Which iPhone OS and model do you have? The newer ones encrypt the data and the erase deletes the key. The chances of DIY recovery are slim. If you pull it off, you probably can get hired for iPhone forensics and make some serious salary doing that professionally.\nOlder devices are more amenable to typical recovery efforts. Either way you will need a forensic tool like PhoneView to access the filesystem. Once mounted you could try something like Data Rescue. Neither tool was designed for this, so you should try the free versions first before spending money on them.\nThe professional data recovery houses will likely charge an arm and a leg to get your data back - but at least you can get a quote if you really need them back at all cost.\nBe sure to double check your camera roll isn't backed up to iTunes or on Time Machine. It would be far simpler to restore the device to an old backup and get the photos off intact. You would lose any photos taken after the backup time, though.\nIf you have enabled data security (iOS 4.3 and iPhone 4 are one combination that enables this security), you're likely deep in the hurt locker. See iOS 4: Understanding data protection to tell if you enabled data protection. In a nutshell, that means the filesystem was encrypted and the erase destroyed the key to the encrypted files. You will need industrial grade forensics to get things back if the phone was powered off immediately after the erase. Using it after the erase will rapidly overwrite the scrambled data irreversably.\n\nA: If you sync your iPhone with iTunes and do routine backups of it, you can restore it with just a single click (using iTunes). Connect your iPhone to iTunes, and right click it from the devices list and select \"Restore from backup\". Your photos should then, be recovered from the backup onto your iPhone, up to the date of the backup.\nHowever, if you did not sync and backup, it would pretty much be very very difficult to recover.\n\nA: You can try an application like iExplorer, which should give you access to your photos. If that doesn't work, pull out the heavy artilary and jailbreak the iPhone to gain root level access to the file system. The full path to the Camera Roll directory on iOS is:\n/private/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/\n\nOnce you are jailbroken, enable your Mac's sshd server\n\nssh into the iPhone and copy the entire directory back to your (hopefully you have a) Mac, and can use the Terminal:\npilcrow@mac:~$ ipconfig getifaddr en1\n192.168.1.76\npilcrow@mac:~$  arp -a\n?

Goodluck mate.\n", "Q: Can I extract application data from an iOS device? I have a third party application on my iPad (Stanza) which has some data that I'm interested in doing some analysis of on my Mac (read statuses). Is there any way to get the data that the application has stored?\n\nA: There is a tool called iPhone Backup Extractor.\nIt lets you extract app data from an iOS backup, which you create with iTunes.\nI posted a detailed tutorial on how to use it on my blog: http://adriansieber.com/how-to-extract-data-from-ios-apps-on-mac-os/\n\nA: There is no need to jailbreak.\nAn application like JuicePhone will do the trick, if you have a MacOS X computer. Just make sure you turn off encryption for the backup.\n\nA: I use PhoneView to access (read and write) that data directly on the iPhone. It does not require you to jailbreak, but if you do, you can have more access. It doesn't care if your backups are encrypted as it just asks you for the password before reading the files on the iPhone. I am a very happy customer and have gotten support from eCamm even when I am running beta Mac OS versions with beta versions of Xcode and beta versions of iOS. It is rock solid on the shipping versions of the software and won't hold you back if you like to live on the edge or develop for iOS.\n\nA: In my opinion the best answer is the FREE answer.. which is use ifuse. The details in my answer to an iPhone question. The process/experience of downloading and using iExplorer made me mad enough to find the right answer.\n\nA: Depending what data you want to access, on macOS Catalina (10.15.5) I was able to just connect my iPhone 11 running iOS 14 to my computer with the lightning cable, and then access my phone through Finder.\nScrolling to the far right of the options, there is one called 'Files', which shows me a list of the apps on my phone, and by expanding them, the files accessible within each app (see below):\n\nI'm not sure if this is the same level of access to files the other apps mentioned above can give you, but this was sufficient for my needs, and much cheaper/easier than using a 3rd party app.\n\nA: Jailbreak you iPad if you haven't, and install OpenSSH.  Then just scp the stuff you want from the iPad to your computer.  Most application-related data are in /var/mobile.\n\nA: I use PhoneDisk. It sits on your menubar, and auto-detects when you connect your iPhone via USB cable. \nIt can read files directly from your iPhone without having to jailbreak, so it doesn't make any difference if your backup is encrypted or not. To read files from a specific app, select \"Change Connection Root\" and then the app you want. It will mount the app dir as a disk that you can navigate through Finder.\n\nA: I'm amazed at how many options there are here. I don't use any of 'em, including the one I'm suggesting: Macroplant's iPhoneExplorer. But I doubt they can get much better. This will work both on jailbroken phone or not accordingly, over USB. And it's free. Obviously it's not as feature-full as PhoneDisk, which is simply awesome: they're from the same Macroplant. JuicePhone do look cool for its different purpose (exploring the backups).\n", "Q: Command line: Sending a zip file via e-mail I am using \"mail\" to send e-mails from command line on my OSX 10.6\nthe \"< filename\" however doesn't work quite well, as I don't really see the file as \"attachment\" on any standard e-mail client. Is there any solution for this with the standard tools that come pre-installed with OSX 10.6?\n\nA: The quick and dirty way to send an attachment is to uuencode the file and mail it.\n\nuuencode report.pdf report.pdf | mail -s \"Here is the report\" bossman@company.com\n\nIf you want to do it easily and build a proper MIME encoded message, you could install mutt, and use the -a flag to attach your message. \nIf you don't want to install anything else, you could build your own MIME message by hand, or use the perl MIME::Entity module to help you:\n\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse MIME::Entity;\n\n$message = MIME::Entity->build(\n  Type    => \"multipart/mixed\",\n  From    => \"me\\@company.com\",\n  To      => \"bossman\\@company.com\",\n  Subject => \"Report attached\" );\n\n$message->attach(Data=>\"Here is the report, as promised.\");\n\n$message->attach(\n  Path     => \"./report.pdf\",\n  Type     => \"application/pdf\",\n  Encoding => \"base64\");\n\nopen MAIL, \"| /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -oi\";\n$message->print(\\*MAIL);\nclose MAIL;\n\n\nA: The easiest solution to your current situation is to use uuencode to encode the file format and mail it. Try this line:\nuuencode /your/file.zip file.zip | mail -s subject recipient@mail\nAnother possibility is to use perl/python scripts to do that job (maybe better), but the above solution just works(tm)\n", "Q: Professional video editing on Mac I'm totally unaware about Macs and video editing. I have an iMac and a Sony camera that produces .mt2s files. I've heard that the Mac is the best for graphic and video editing, so I was wondering how should I work with this file format on a Mac?\n\nA: Sony codes their recording in their own format, hence the .mt2s, and they want you to use a Sony Laptop to edit the footage. Anyways, there is a Mac app called, MPEG Stream Clip, that converts the footage to any format you want at any frames/second you want. You can download it for free from Squared 5, http://www.squared5.com/svideo/mpeg-streamclip-mac.html. \nIt is a great piece of free software.\nAs for video editing software you can use Apple's iMoive (for the amateur) or purchase Apple's Final Cut Pro (wait until July, they are releasing a new version).\n\nA: AVCHD is not an editing codec but an acquisition codec, which means that in order to be able to edit the footage, it will need to be converted/transcoded into a more suitable format. \nAnother bottleneck is that most AVCHD camcorders, record interlaced video, which is not suitable for computer/web use but only for televisions. Which means that if you plan to use your resulting video in computer screens, you'll need to de-interlace the video (preferably prior importing to editing software, but after the initial transcode). Canon released some camcorders which record in 1080p (progressive - no need for de-interlacing) format, but I don't think a lot of models support this function yet.\nThere are various workflows for these tasks, which they depend upon the available software you have.\nMy personal workflow from my 1080i60 Sony videos (already copied to hdd) to Final Cut is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rewrap the AVCHD videos to a Quicktime compatible format using ClipWrap ($49). This process is really fast, because it won't alter the video files, just replace their container/headers.\n\n*De-interlace the videos and transcode them to an editing codec (Apple Pro Res) using Jes Deinterlacer (free)\n\n*Import them to FinalCut\n\n\nFor sure they will be other ways also to reach to the same result, but in order to help you more, please let us know of what software are you planning to use for editing your videos (I suppose iMovie will be your best choice).\n\nA: I've done some semi-pro video editing (summer camps, bar mitzvahs, weddings) on both PC and Mac. (I'm currently a Mac user and app developer.) Mac OS X seems to have a smoother user experience, but that has nothing to do with video editing per sè. \nI've never heard of m2ts files before but a quick look at the links shown by others here (or Google) seems to indicate that it is an HD file format. To handle the video files, your best bet is to try a professional grade tool, such as Adobe Premier (Mac or PC), or Apple's Final Cut Studio. These programs may support editing the files uncompressed (although you'd better have some solid hardware for decoding HD video in realtime). Even if they don't, they might support conversion to another filetype.\nIf you don't want to pay for a professional tool, and are not interested in trying the demo (at least for premiere, I don't know if Final Cut has a demo), then you can try a third part program, like handbrake. (I haven't had luck with handbrake, but it's been highly recommended to me by others.)Mac OS X comes with the excellent iMovie. It's not professional grade, but definitely worth a look. I don't know if iMovie can work with m2ts files though. \nRegardless of what you choose, I strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with a video editing program. Pick a tool and explore it thoroughly. Trust me, you'll enjoy video editing that much more when you've picked your toolset and can command it. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: Time Capsule Setup Woes I received a 2TB Time Capsule today, and replaced an Airport Extreme. However, after replicating the settings from the Airport Extreme on the Time Capsule, there was no internet connection (amber light). I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*turning DHCP on and off\n\n*manually applying the IP Address and DNS settings that the old router had\n\n*turning NAT on and off\n\n*playing with everything, pretty much\n\n\nbut to no avail. If I set the IP address of the Time Capsule manually (green light), my computer still could not connect to the Internet. My computer is hooked up to the Time Capsule via Ethernet).\nConnecting the Airport Extreme back in allows everything to work fine. It receives an IP Address with no problems when configured via DHCP and public IP sharing. These same settings prevent the Time Capsule from working.\n\nA: If the old Airport Express was connected directly to your cable/DSL modem and the new Time Capsule replaced it (again, directly connected), you may need to reboot the modem (generally by unplugging it and plugging it back in, maybe holding down the reset button) to reset its DHCP. You may also need to do this in a particular order, generally 1) shutdown Time Capsule, 2) reboot modem, and 3) restart Time Capsule.\nReason: some broadband modems seem to only assign one internal IP at a time and only check for a device on startup.\n", "Q: Implications of disconnecting the closed lid sensor/battery level indicator As a follow-up to this question MBP Mid 2009 thinks the lid is closed permanently I have identified (with a lot of help from google) where the closed lid reed switch is connected to the logic board, disconnected and insulated it.\nThe immediate side-effect of this was that my laptop now turns on every time without needing an external monitor or some voodoo where it would sometimes boot if I kept pressing the power button every time it went to sleep, this is a good thing.\nA less positive side-effect is that I now have to manually put the laptop to sleep before I close the lid, not a huge problem if I'm honest. (Oh and the battery indicator lights no longer work, even less of a big deal)\nMy question is this, can anyone think of any other negative impact this may have on the machine over the long term? I'm considering just leaving the laptop as-is now.\n\nA: The negative side is that it may power on (via paired bluetooth mouse or keyboard) while in your bag. Everything else is like having installed InsomniaX on your book.\n", "Q: Can I cancel a download of a Mac Store app? I just got a really large Mac App Store app, (2GB), but Im having some trouble with my diskspace... \nIs there a way to completeley cancel the download of the app? I mean not just pause it but cancel it. The icon on the dock kind of stresses me out, and it reappears even if I drag it out.\n\nA: Another way to do this by enabling the AppStore Debug menu.\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of AppStore.\n\n\n*Quit AppStore.\n\n\n*Open a terminal and execute the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true\n\n\n*Open AppStore again and a Debug menu is now present.\n\n\n*Debug Menu -> Reset Application.\nThis will reset the current state of the AppStore, including current downloads. You will have to sign back in to see available downloads.\nIn my case I was able to stop the not yet finished download of XCode 4.0.1 in favor of just starting up the Xcode 4.1 download (since Lion only runs 4.1).\nI wish I could have done Debug Menu -> Show Download Folder and just deleted the directory in com.apple.AppStore that was obviously 4.0.1 (based on size), but this didn't register in the AppStore. I wonder if the sqllite file in that same directory is where this status is stored.\nIf you are not comfortable leaving the debug menu enabled just run the above terminal command again, this time setting it to false.\n\nA: In the Mac App Store \"Purchases\" tab, hold down the Option key, this causes the “Pause” button to turn into “Cancel”.\nI tested it on 10.8 Mountain Lion, but don't know if it works on previous OSX version.\nAdded comment - This works on Sierra as well.\n\nA: Can't believe I just found this solution.

I was trying to upload a picture of a part that I needed and it would let me .\n\nA: Mobile safari before iOS 6 does not have access to data from the camera roll or photo application by design.\niOS doesn't have a common space to store files like computer users have come to expect. Instead, each app is \"sandboxed\" and can only see the data it created/downloaded. Apple provides API for one program to request data from another. Mobile Safari would need to have hooks to allow a web site to ask to use the photo chooser for image upload to work. So the design makes it hard to upload files in the way most web sites expect on iOS.\nThe best you can do is use another app like the flickr app to push photos to the internet and then link back or upload from a URL. It's clumsy but works without you waiting for mobile safari to change or updating to iOS 6.\n\nA: You can't upload files from any iOS device because apps can't access files from other apps. Since shared files, such as the photo library, are available from all apps, Apple could have chosen to let you upload photos, but for whatever reason they decided it was better to not have uploads at all.\n\nA: I found this new app:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webuploader/id448687892?mt=8\nThat is the center app you want\n", "Q: How to increase \"tracking speed\" beyond the maximum?

The normal maximum value is currently 3.0. Applying the changes requires logging out and back in.\n\nA: Mouse Curves is a preference pane that allows you to customize the tracking speed of the mouse and trackpad. \nhttp://triq.net/mac/mouse-acceleration-preference-pane-mac-os-x\n\nA: For those who come here searching for mouse speed up (as me), change the command/property mentioned on the answer of @user495470 to com.apple.mouse.scaling. \nSo:\ndefaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling -float 5.0\n\nis what you're looking for.\nHere is  @Kodos Johnson :)\n\nA: BetterTouchTool does that, and lets you add application specific gestures as well!\nIn BetterTouchTool, open Preferences. In the left bar under Advanced Settings choose either Trackpad or Magic Mouse. There is a slider that adjusts the tracking speed.\nI don't think I could use a mac without it, at this point. I have my browser-tab-management and finder shortcuts mapped to multitouch gestures.\n\nA: Ordinary trackpad-dragging can be done in segments, the same way mouse-dragging can be done in limited space, by lifting & repositioning {the mouse; your fingers} and making another swipe.

Are there any e-book readers for iPad that allow the user to highlight a block of text and share it, either by email or blog post?  \nUse case: \nWhile reading the fifth chapter of The Brothers Karamazov, the user has an insight into The Grand Inquisitor sequence and wants to blog about it.  The user highlights a sentence and activates a share feature, and the e-book reader copies the highlighted section into an email, or posts it to Instapaper, with appropriate annotation.\n\nA: Amazon supports a \"public notes\" feature.  When you create a note or a highlight on a section using a Kindle or any of their apps, including the iPad app, it's uploaded to the Amazon servers and visible to you at https://kindle.amazon.com/kindle.

The mom is on a business trip and kids stay at home. Each of them has a iPad. The mom hopes that when she turns to next page the kids' iPad can do the same thing so they are always on the same page.\nAny idea how to do that?\n\nA: Ok, I like this question..\nIn order to accomplish this we need the following components:\n\n\n*\n\n*A VNC server running on the children's iPads. VNC basically shares screen over the network. A VNC for iOS is called Veency and it's available in Cydia once the iPad is jailbroken.\n\n*A VNC client. I recommend iTeleport - works and feels great.\n\n*Since Children's iPads are probably with a fake (NAT-ed) ip, we should somehow connect to the home network. A VPN server on the gateway should do the trick. Once connected to the vpn server, the mother's iPad should see all devices in the home network.\nOnce connected to the children's iPad via VNC, you'll be able to see everything the kid sees on the screen. This can be accomplished also from computer or iphone.\n\nA: If the mom uses a computer rather than an iPad, you can easily do this with Google Plus:\n\n\n*\n\n*The mom should initiate a hangout session with the child on the web version of Google Plus from her computer.\n\n*The child accepts the hangout invite using the Google Plus iPad app.\n\n*The mom can then choose to broadcast her screen's contents rather than what her video camera is recording.\n\n*She then opens up a reading application on her computer such as Amazon's Kindle reading app.\n\n\nThe child should be able to see exactly what the mom is seeing on her screen, while at the same time being able to hear her voice.\n\nThe problem with both parties using iPad's is that Apple's SDK prevents applications from capturing images of the screen outside of that application. If this is a necessity, then the only hope would be to jailbreak the iPad and find a solution that let's you do that. \nThe only other way is if you had an application which had both an e-book reader and screen sharing capabilities into it. The most popular e-book applications (iBooks, Amazon Kindle, etc.) don't have such a feature at this time.\n\nA: There are several possible approaches, all of which require a central server.\n\n\n*\n\n*quick and dirty: just poll an http server every 10 seconds to save/read the status (current page)\n\n*use apple push notifications (the device can recive and act upon them silenty if it's already running). This is a bit more complex but may put less charge on the server than a million users polling for changes\n\n*use socket connections: you'll need a dedicated server for that too but this will probably provide the most instantaneous effect (just like a realtime chat does)\nThen there's the whole part where you link devices into the same reading session. You could send an email with a clickable link featuring a protocol handled solely by the app (eg. Myappbooklink:userid,sessionid)\nIn any case such a system would require a server system that is able to scale in case of success.\n", "Q: Generic TWAIN driver for OS x?

I have tried looking around the site and link-hacking, but nowwhere have I been able to find a minimal Xcode.\nI don’t really care if it's Xcode4 or not, I just need it for Homebrew to work. Is it possible to find this somewhere?\n(If not, is it safe to simply delete /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform and /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform)?\n\nA: When you run the Install Xcode and iOS SDK installer, during the \"Installation Type\" step, you can uncheck the iOS SDK box, and leave the Xcode Toolset checked. This will skip the 8.35 GB iOS SDK install.\n\nA: In early 2012, Apple started packaging \"Command Line Tools for Xcode\". It's a much more manageable 140 MB.\n\nA: You can buy just Xcode 4 from the Mac App Store for $4.99. I believe it is just Xcode, it is a 4.25 GB download.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Why do external hard drives run so hot while mounted and idle on a Macbook Pro? When my external drives are mounted and idle on a Macbook Pro, they run hot.  Why?  I do not have the same experience with NTFS volumes on my Windows box, where's the difference in idle disk usage?\nNo... time machine is not running on these drives.\nExternal HFS+ Drives I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Seagate 3.5\" 7200rpm in Seagate USB enclosure\n\n*WD Green 3.5\" 7200rpm in rosewill USB dock\n\n*WD Black 2.5\" 7200rpm in rosewill USB dock\n\n*Seagate 2.5\" 7200rpm in macally firewire 800\n\n\nA: It's simple. Heat comes from the drive motors spinning - so more heat implies more time spinning. (And since these drives spin at constant rates - it's more the duty cycle that the motors are on, then how the motors are being controlled that affects heat generation.)\nI will assume you have selected \"Put hard disk(s) to sleep when possible.\" in energy saver since that needs to be checked for Mac OS X to tell the drives they are no longer needed. When they are idled the heat generation is less.\nIf you asked to idle the drives by selecting the choice above, then you need to find what process is polling the drives which keeps them in a non-idle status. The fs_usage command would be a great place to start to monitor what writes/reads are happening.\nOnce you know what processes are responsible, you have a chance to change things.\nAlternatively, you can use Disk Utility to unmount the drives. They should sleep well but at the cost of not being mounted.\n", "Q: Change Account Password to Blank I recently changed an account password by accident, and was wondering how to set it back to a blank password via the shell. I have root privileges. Please help :)\npasswd USER doesn't accept blank passwords\n\nA: The passwd command rejects the idea that you can have a 0 length password. \nInstead use dscl which is more accepting of the notion that the password is nothing.\ndscl . -passwd /Users/foo\n\nYou can press enter to make the new password blank and then may get an error and have to enter the old password if you are not root\nOnce you authenticate (or are root already) the blank password will be set for the account in question. \n\nA: You can set the account password to no password using the Users and Groups Pane in System Preferences.\n\nA: macOS no longer allows this using the System Preferences and this is why.\nmacOS and iOS turn on sharing of all your photos by default so that Apple can keep all the photos of billions of people on their servers.\nAdditionally they by default turn on iCloud end-to-end encryption for some specific things on your devices and that end-to-end encryption is secured using your local device login password.\nApple wants you to store all your life on Apple servers and they cannot do that if you do not have a local device password. So that is why you are not able to NOT set a password.\n", "Q: Is there a way to capture text messages into an image? On the iPhone, if you hold down the Power button + Main button, it'll take an image of what's on the screen.  I've used it in the past to capture and print out text message exchanges.  \nIs there a way to do this if the text message exchanges span multiple pages?\n\nA: Only by scrolling and capturing repeatedly and then assembling in a graphics program. Nothing built into iOS currently does it, and SMS data is completely inaccessible to App Store 3rd party apps (protecting your privacy).\n\nA: Try PhoneView. It can convert your SMS logs to PDF files for viewing or printing.\n", "Q: wireless connection with macbook pro I have a macbook pro (mid 2008). Right now I'm experiencing problems with the wireless connection at work. It goes on and off. Every time I loose the connection I have to turn Airport off and on again, and it works. But  this happens quite frequently. \nThe administrator says that he does not see network problems. Any idea of what could that be?\n\nA: Go to Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration and trash the com.apple.airport.preferences.plist file.  \nReboot and a new file will be regenerated. This would eliminate a corrupt file.\nIf the problem persists, you may have some interference in your cube so moving any printers or other electronic devices further away might help.\n", "Q: Using the Seagate FreeAgent Desk for Mac on PCs Is there any way  I can use the Seagate free agent Desk  Hard Disk for Mac on a PC?\nNotes: When this disk is plugged into a PC(running Linux, say) the disk is recognized as a separate drive, but we can't do anything more than browse the top level directory. I debugged this problem with the help of an expert at USB devices about a year ago , using a USB debugger. My vague memory is that one of the USB commands is misinterpreted by a non-Mac OS, and thus we can't read from/write to the disk.\n\nA: If it's formated FAT-32 with MBR based partition scheme, pretty much every OS out there should be able to read it without any trouble or 3rd party drivers.\nThe only downside is FAT-32 does not support files over ~4.2GB. If that's a problem, I would suggest NTFS. This requires a additional driver (NTFS3G) to write files (NTFS works read-only on OS X only), but is supported on pretty much every platform out there as well (Windows, Linux, Android, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenSolaris, QNX, Haiku, and more...).\nThe GUID partition scheme is much more recent then MBR based partition maps, so it is not as widely supported. Everything should support MBR. If you're Ok with just Win Vista/7, OS X, and any recent Linux Distro, the GUID partition scheme should also work.\n\nIt's worth noting that the issue with listing files you mention in the question is very strange. It sounds to me like a corrupt volume on the drive (E.g. a bad drive, or someone yanked the power in the midst of a write, and something got corrupted). I have had many external drives (15+), and never had any issues with the underlying USB system that weren't fixed by just disconnecting/reconnecting the cable.\nThe USB Mass-Storage device class protocol is extremely well understood, documented and tested, and having a device implement it improperly (Particularly from a company as large as Seagate) at this point is vanishingly unlikely.\n\nA: This is for the GoFlex Mac but it will probably work on the FreeAgent drive.\n\nHFS4Win.EXE Windows Software to allow\n  a GoFlex for Mac, GoFlex Desk for Mac,\n  or GoFlex Pro to mount as a drive\n  letter in Windows without having to\n  reformat.\n\nhttp://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&name=goflex-mac-downloads&vgnextoid=8ce597a0090ec210VgnVCM1000001a48090aRCRD\n", "Q: Using hosts file on Mac OS X Snow Leopard I have added two new host entries in \n\n/pricate/etc/hosts\n\n 127.0.0.1/wys/sub-folder local.wys\n 127.0.0.1/les/sub-folder local.les\n\nI have flushed the DNS using\n\ndscacheutil -flushcache\n\nI now want to access local.wys and have content served from\n\nlocalhost/wys/sub-folder\n\nThis doesn't work, I have tried 127.0.0.1 and localhost in the hosts file.\nAny ideas?\nThanks,\nJake\n\nA: A friend of mine provided the answer via email....\nAlmost.\nThe purpose of the hosts file is to serve as a local supplement to a dns lookup (on linux, you can actually specify whether it asks DNS or the file first).  As such, it is only used to return IP addresses.  You need to use this in combination with Apache VirtualHosts to make apache respond to a host using a specific directory.\nSo... you hosts file should look like\n127.0.0.1 local.wys\n127.0.0.1 local.les\n\nFind your apache configuration directory.

If you look at Apple's keyboards nowadays, you'll see that on the \"F\" and \"J\" keys there is a little groove line under the letter. \nWhy does this exist? What purpose does it serve?\n\n\nA: Actually, this is a feature of all keyboards, and has been for as long as I can remember. Most keyboards use a line, but older Apple keyboards used a dot.\nThe goal of the ridge is to allow people who type without looking at the keyboard to easily find the right keys to put their fingers on. These keys are referred to as the home row.\nBoth Qwerty and Dvorak keyboards (image) have these notches where you place you index fingers on the home row, which shows that the notches correspond to a location and not a particular letter.\nBottom line: If you don't look at your keyboard, these are an important feature to let you put your hands where you need to. If you do look at your keyboard, these don't help you.\n", "Q: Is there a complete and detailed description of what Migration Assistant copies over? Does it copy all files in ~/Library ?  Including cache files and even things like Flash cookies?  What about user created files/folders in / ?\netc etc\n\nA: Migration Assistant is fairly well documented in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4413 - basically if a newer or equivalent version of a file is not present, it gets moved by default.\nIn your case ~/Library is moved if you select that user - you can't deselect it like some other folders in the home folder.\nApplications (which includes /Library/Application support as well as /Applications) move when that is selected.\nFiles in / only move if you choose other files. Everything goes AFAIK. Even ByHost preferences that no longer are used since the host has changed.\n\nA: The Migration Assistant will write to the logs, like every other application and service.

When I set up the syncing either through general preferences or through the mail app the only syncing option is Notes. I've tried deleting and recreating the account and readying the iPad but with no luck so far. MobileMe syncs with my iPhone so I dont think the problem is there. What could I look at next?\n\nA: To help you in focusing your troubleshooting - here are the variables:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your MobileMe account status\n\n*The network between the iPad and the MobileMe servers\n\n*The steps you take to configure it\non the iPad\n\n*The software on the iPad\n\n*The iPad hardware\n\n\nYou seem to have tried #3 again - so unless you have never successfully entered a MobileMe account into an iOS device and had it work, it's unlikely having someone else do the entering will help solve your problem.\nTo really rule out #4 - I would transfer all purchases and back up the device. Then I would rename the device to \"test\" and restore it. Once it's restored, I would not load a backup and set it up as a new device. Second thing after joining a network would be to try MobileMe setup. If it still fails you can rule out #4. Then you could restore your backup to get everything and the iPad name correct again.\nYou'll need to take your account to another device to rule out #5. This is unlikely since if the hardware is failing, everything should fail equally. There's no little chip inside the iPad that computes the sync data - it's all software for that.\nEliminating #2 should be easy and it's highly unlikely to be the cause - possible, but very unlikely.\nLastly, you will need to get help from Apple MobileMe support if you need someone with access to the servers to see if your account is having problems. I needed their help last year to realize that my iDisk was over quota and syncing having errors as part of that space was needed to store my data during a sync. MobileMe is an evolving thing and something that caused problems in the past might now be fixed and new things could be causing your account to not show other data to be synchronized.\n", "Q: Only show active windows in the current space in Mac OSX when pressing CMD-Tab I'm new to Mac and have the following wish:\nI would like to have one instance of an application (app1) on space1 and another application (app2) on space2. When I pres press CMD-Tab I see every open programs in every space. For example I'm in space1 and press CMD-Tab then I can switch between app1 and app2. But I would like to see only app1 when I'm in space1 and no app2 when I'm in space1.\nIs there some setting where I can change this behavior?\nThanks for your help.\nMatthias\n\nA: I'm afraid you cannot do that, since the Dock (where this menu belongs) cannot be distinctly used on each space.\nBut, what it might be handy is to disable the option: \n\"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\" from System Preferences > Expose & Spaces > Spaces.\nThat way, even if you select an application which is not present in the current space, you wont be moved to that space.\nAfter all its just a matter to get used of it. After a while, even you'll be ok with it or you'll just deactivate spaces at all (the latter happened to me).\n\nA: Well, there's nothing built into the OS that will help you, but it is possible. Dock Spaces and Hyperspaces are two great products that extend Spaces and offer some of the function you desire.\n\nA: You can assign an application to a particular space (sometimes called desktop). Go to some space -- perhaps an empty one. In the dock, right click on the icon for your app 1. You will see a pop-up which includes options. Select options, then \"assign to this space\".\nMove to a different space with Mission Control. Repeat the process for app 2 (right click on the icon in dock, select options, assign to this space).\nMove between the two apps by choosing the assigned space for whichever one you want to use. You will see one but not the other in the corresponding space space. You can configure how you move between spaces in system preferences.\n\nA: It might not be relevant to you anymore, but possibly to others searching for the same functionality.\nIn any case, Command Tab Plus does exactly what you were requesting, i.e. it isolates spaces. Unfortunately it is not free, but there is a free trial version.\n\nA: HyperSwitch is still in Beta, but I've been using it, and it is stable most of the time (sometimes I need to restart the Mac for it to work again, but it is not common).\nReally ill-designed, poor behaviour.\n", "Q: MacBook Screen Does Not Work, External Monitor Does Update 2012-03-19: I never figured out what the problem was because the screen started to work again after reinstalling OS X 10.6 for a second time. I sold the Mac on eBay a few months afterward (I explained the full history ;).\nOriginal Post: My Late-2008 Aluminum MacBook Unibody screen doesn't usually turn on. External displays work via the Mini-DisplayPort.\nSometimes when power is not connected, the lid is open, and I have the external display connected, the internal monitor will work! When it works, it stays on until reboot.\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964 (SMC Reset)\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379 (PRAM and NVRAM Reset)\n\n\nI've been told by an independent, authorized Mac repair company that the logic board needs to be replaced. That seems a bit excessive to me, although I've read many similar diagnoses online.\nAny other ideas?\n\nA: I had a similar issue - if I had a monitor connected, my macbook screen would sometimes stay dark. I found out that that was only happening if I connected the external monitor while the laptop lid was closed. If I connected it while the laptop screen was on, it will stay on.\n\nA: I would put a lot of weight in a technician that sees many macs as they really don't have any reason to mislead you. You can also get a second opinion if you don't feel the one you got the first quote listened to your concerns or explained how he arrived at that guess.\nDo make sure you look carefully - when the backlight goes out on a LCD - there is so little light coming through it is hard to tell if the panel is drawing fine and the light is missing or the panel isn't being driven.\nWithout opening the mac and trying to replace things (and especially when it's intermittent) it's hard to know for sure what one piece is failing. If you ask a tech to put percentage chance you will find most situations have multiple causes, but one is much more likely given experience and symptoms.\nThe next time it goes out - you can use a flashlight to narrow down if the panel itself is not getting signal or it's just the backlight by looking for the menu and other graphics on the screen getting drawn.\n\nA: bmike is correct about the backlight. A good method to test if there's any doubt is a flashlight shone on the screen to determine if video or backlight has failed. Another good test is if the issue changes with the monitor hinge being moved from an open-to-closed state.\nGiven that you have consistent video output on an external display, the suspect would first be your LCD panel over your logic board.\nAlso to bckbck: Opening your Mac does not void your warranty. That's why RAM and HDD are considered DIY parts on newer units, and Apple supplies installation manuals for users. You are free to do as you wish with your own hardware. Any modifications you make that damage the unit, however, are on you and not under warranty. That's as far as it goes.\n", "Q: Opening MacWrite documents I have some old documents that were created with MacWrite (I think it was MacWrite Pro). Is there any software that will run on a modern system that can read these files?\nAlternately, is the file format documented somewhere so that I can write my own program to translate the files?\n\nA: MacWrite II (ver 1.1v3) runs in Sheepshaver ... I don't have MacWrite Pro in there, so that maybe means I tried it and it didn't run.\n\nA: An early version of AppleWorks is your best bet for something that has a chance to run on Leopard or Snow Leopard in the classic environment.\nSome of the early mac source code is getting released by the Computer History Museum but I don't know of the file format being documented well enough to be of use to a programmer. It might be easier to locate someone with a working classic mac than to reverse engineer the file format.\nBest of luck!\n", "Q: Mac App Store: Don't show updates for an uninstalled app I downloaded the free trial ('lite') version of an app on the Mac App Store. I didn't like the app, so I uninstalled it from my computer.\nHowever, the App Store wants me to install updates for this app that I no longer even have.\nIs it possible to tell the Mac App Store that I don't want to be notified about updates for a particular app?\n\nA: Nathan - I made a mistake on a mac where I wasn't the main administrator.   I sure meant to delete the app and even dragged it into the trash, but a day later when the update bubble was still there, I found I didn't really delete the app (In my case it was installed on a different user on a multi user system and rather than move to the trash, it copied itself to the trash). Once I really moved the app to the trash with an admin user and rebooted, the update badge disappeared.\n", "Q: Why does OS X prevent access to a folder if it ends with the word \".service\"? I am sharing a win 7 folder and trying to access it from Osx.\nEverything works but if the folder is named something ending with the words \".service\" the folder is not accessible any more, the icon is changed and if I try to access it I get the message below.\nIf I remove the word \"service\" the folder is accessible again.\nThe machine is hosted inside a VmWare Fusion machine but I don't think this could be a problem, maybe something related to osx-bsd naming for services.\nAs I am working on folders where I can't change the names is there a way to prevent this behavior?\n \n\nA: If Finder thinks it is a bundle, maybe you can right-click on it and \"Show Package Contents\"...\n\nA: I don't think there's anything you can do to prevent it.\nOSX has decided, for whatever reason, that it's a service bundle (something intended to show up in the Services menu).  I'd consider filing a radar about it, but have no idea how likely it would be that Apple would do anything about it.  (Were it my call, I would have done something like requiring a bundle to have a valid Info.plist and treat it as a normal directory otherwise.)\n", "Q: Why do I have to drag my new apps into the application folder? I'm a new Mac user and I've been installing a few different apps for different things. A lot of these use .dmg files.\nWhy exactly do they all expect me to drag the icon into the application folder? What is the point of this?\n\nA: The /Applications folder is just a convenient place to store all of your applications. You can theoretically store them anywhere. Some software (such as Butler) will automatically search for applications in these standard locations, so if you store them elsewhere (such as /Users/Shared/Applications) such software won't find them by default.\nGenerally there are three standard places to store applications, and 99% of Mac users only work with the first one:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications (available to all\nusers)\n\n*/Users/username/Applications\n(available to the logged in user who\nowns that folder)\n\n*/Developer/Applications (available to\nall users, used for Xcode software)\n\n\nA: You don't have to put your new Applications in the Application folder - it's just the default place to put them.\n\nA: You can create /Applications/Imaging, /Applications/Internet, etc. if you want categorize them. Just don't move any of the standard applications into these folders because further updates will expect them to be directly in /Applications.\n\nA: An application on a Mac is just a folder full of files with a .app extension. However, macOS hides this fact from you and displays the folder as a file with an icon. Now when you download something it's very uncomfortable to download multiple separate folders (without a download manager). Therefore this \"App Folder\" has to be put inside a single file somehow. This is  accomplished one of three ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a .zip file (a container that compresses its contents to save space)\n\n*Using a .dmg file (which is a flat file filesystem–as opposed to a hierarchical file system)\n\n*Make an installer (which, however, also has to be either in a .zip or .dmg because installers are folders on a mac, too)\n\n\nSince most apps are self-contained and do not need anything outside of the app folder, an installer is not only overkill but also slower than just distributing the app folder.\nYou can obviously launch apps from wherever you want; it's only a custom or a recommendation to put them into /Applications as it easier for you to find it again and it works with multiple users.\n\nA: Keep in mind there are plenty of applications that assume they are in a folder called \"Applications\" and apps that looks for other specific apps in the \"Applications\" folder.\n\nA: DMG files are compressed and read-only. Applications frequently need to be able to update or change components inside themselves; at a minimum, when a new version is detected and it offers to install an update - it won't be able to delete itself and put the new version in its place. Indeed, you'll probably find that running an application off a DMG will result in an \"was downloaded from the internet\" message on every launch. That doesn't happen if you move it to the right place.\nRunning an application off a locked DMG is a sure-fire way to run into problems. Just drag the application to some place on your hard disk - preferably one of the Applications folders.\nThere are certain locations on your Mac that have special significance to the system - these are places where the Mac goes looking for launchable applications when you double-click a document. They include the top level Applications folder, and a folder called \"Applications\" in your personal home folder. Mounted DMGs are not part of this, if only because they're not always mounted.\n", "Q: Piping audio from arbitrary program to Airport Express What are my options for sending audio from VLC on my MacBook Pro to my Airport Express?  (I know about AirFoil so far.)\n\nA: Honestly I'm not aware of any (free) options that I can vouch for.  I've used a couple of solutions with little success.  What I can offer, however, is some praise for the AirFoil solution which has served me well over the past couple of years.  \nIn terms of VLC, I would also add that there is an issue with syncing the audio to the video when using AirPort and VLC (or any other video player).  The Rogue Amoeba folks get around this by supplying their own video player, the Airfoil Video Player, which is capable of handling most video inputs and also making sure to keep the video display in sync with the audio.\nSo, while this doesn't answer your question as to other options, hopefully what I can do is allay your fears about wasting $25 on a product that may or may not work.  In my experience it works exactly as advertised.  And I've had good luck getting responses from the developers when I've had questions or minor issues.  \nHighly recommended software.\nGood luck in your search.\n-Steve\n\nA: A free alternative to AirFoil would be Raopx, the catch is that it requires for the end user to compile it...so it's entirely dependent on how you feel and your comfort level. \nWifi2Hifi is a fantastic app that allows you to stream audio to your iOS device, but doesn't involve the Airport Express. Theoretically, you could use your iPhone to connect to whatever you have in mind, but if you're thinking of video, you have to consider audio and video being in sync... which AirFoil does for you quite marvellously I might add.\n", "Q: Is it ok to mix 2 GB and 4 GB DIMMS in an iMac (mid 2011)? I've been told it is important to use matching DIMMs when installing memory to take advantage of the 128 bit throughput. I'm looking to buy a new 27\" iMac (mid 2011) which has 4 memory slots. If I put matching 2x2GB in 2 of the slots and matching 2x4GB in the other two slots, will that reduce its throughput or cause any problems? \nDo all 4 have to match or do each set of 2 need to match?\n\nA: Yes - it's OK to mix. The more RAM you have, the more files can be cached over time and the more processes can sit resident in RAM for faster switching between tasks running at the same time.\nI haven't read the tech note on the latest iMacs, but in general I have never seen a benchmark that shows any mac ever ran slower with more memory. (even the initial intel GMA integrated MacBooks where having non matched RAM where there were only two slots did noticeably slow the graphics performance). The iMacs of the past several years all need high quality ram that matches their specifications fairly exactly - but run well with whatever lineup of good ram is installed.\nIf it makes a difference, the tech note and consumer installation guide will tell you in which order to install RAM and will call out when matching pairs will make sense due to the architecture of that machine. Again, more ram is always faster.\nAlso - when you are buying a new mac - often the seller will credit the value of the pre-installed RAM as new memory if you want to buy up to have larger chips (2x4GB) and then you can add the second later as needed.\n\nA: Kenny,\nTo your first question, yes, you can mix memory sizes.  \nTo your second question, 4GB of matching memory will be faster than unmatched memory, but 8GB of unmatched memory will be faster than 4GB of matched memory. At some point you stop getting gains from more memory, but that depends on what you're doing.\n\nA: Just to add to your peace of mind, my 21\" iMac (prior version) is working beautifully at 2x2 and 2x4 (12 total) GiB. Way faster than before (4GiB really isn't sufficient for what I do), and I don't see any oddball slowdowns.\nI got good quality memory that matched the MHz (1333) of the existing memory. Works like a charm.\nThat said, I didn't try going to 16 GiB, so I can't vouch that 16GiB isn't faster than 12, but for me, 12 is more than sufficient at the moment. When the time comes, I'll switch out the older 2x2 sticks, but I don't see that it will make a huge improvement.\n\nA: Yep, totally okay to do. All Intel-based macs support dual-channel memory, so in a nutshell: You'll get the best performance with equal-size RAM sticks, but it won't kill it if you don't. Luckily, most RAM is sold in pairs these days.\n", "Q: How can I write a script to open multiple terminal tabs and execute code in them? I want to be able to open the terminal application and have it either automatically run a script that opens several tabs and run an arbitrary set of commands in each. For example I would like one tab to open, change directories, and run a rails server; have another open, change directories, and tail a log file; etc..\nIs there a way to do this either with a shell script or applescript?\nI found this question but it seems to hang if I want to open tabs with commands that don't end (like running the rails server).\n\nA: This is a little bit hacky, but you can achieve this in AppleScript. If there is a predetermined number of tabs you want, and preset commands you wish to run, this isn't difficult.\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    -- Activate it.\n    activate\n\n    set targetWindow to 0\n\n    -- Get a window that's not busy.\n    -- If there are no open windows, open one.\n    if count of windows is greater than 0 then\n        repeat with currentWindow in windows\n            if currentWindow is not busy then\n                set targetWindow to currentWindow\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    else\n        do script \"\"\n        set targetWindow to window 1\n    end if\n\n    -- Do command 1.\n    set firstCommand to \"cd ~/Desktop; clear\"\n    do script firstCommand in targetWindow\n\n    -- Open a new tab.\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Terminal\" to keystroke \"t\" using command down\n\n    if count of windows is greater than 0 then\n        repeat with currentWindow in windows\n            if currentWindow is not busy then\n                set targetWindow to currentWindow\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    else\n        do script \"\"\n        set targetWindow to window 1\n    end if\n\n    -- Do command 2.\n    set secondCommand to \"cd /Applications; clear\"\n    do script secondCommand in targetWindow\n\n    -- And so on...\nend tell\n\nOf course, replace firstCommand with whichever command you actually want to run, and so on. For whatever reason, Terminal doesn't really have an accessible way to create new tabs through AppleScript, so the long, hacky looking line in the middle just tells Terminal to type ⌘T to open that new tab, and then new commands will execute in it.\nYou can run this AppleScript as is, or use it in Automator to create a new service, which you can then execute from anywhere using a keyboard shortcut if you'd like.\nExtras - If you want to fire some script/command in the newly opened terminal session, you can refer this \n\nA: Here is a shell script that will do what you want - for both Apple's Terminal or iTerm (we have users of both).\nFor your tabs that you open, this will execute another batch file in each tab, such as one for tomcat, one for you db, etc.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction tab () {\n    local cmd=\"\"\n    local cdto=\"$PWD\"\n    local args=\"$@\"\n\n    if [ -d \"$1\" ]; then\n        cdto=`cd \"$1\"; pwd`\n        args=\"${@:2}\"\n    fi\n\n    if [ -n \"$args\" ]; then\n        cmd=\"; $args\"\n    fi\n\n    if [ $TERM_PROGRAM = \"Apple_Terminal\" ]; then\n        osascript \n            -e \"tell application \\\"Terminal\\\"\" \\\n                -e \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to keystroke \\\"t\\\" using {command down}\" \\\n                -e \"do script \\\"cd $cdto; clear $cmd\\\" in front window\" \\\n            -e \"end tell\"\n            > /dev/null\n    elif [ $TERM_PROGRAM = \"iTerm.app\" ]; then\n        osascript\n            -e \"tell application \\\"iTerm\\\"\" \\\n                -e \"tell current terminal\" \\\n                    -e \"launch session \\\"Default Session\\\"\" \\\n                    -e \"tell the last session\" \\\n                        -e \"write text \\\"cd \\\"$cdto\\\"$cmd\\\"\" \\\n                    -e \"end tell\" \\\n                -e \"end tell\" \\\n            -e \"end tell\" \\\n            > /dev/null\n    fi\n}\n\ntab path_to_script1 sh script1\ntab path_to_script2 sh script2\ntab path_to_script3 sh script3\n\n\nA: Since it is so trivial to open a new tab, I would suggest making the execution of your commands as trivial as possible, and doing this the old-fashioned way.\nYou called out two specific actions, so let's work with those. Note that I'm going to be making a lot of assumptions based off what I know of Rails, but not necessarily specific to your project.\nTo cut a long story short, alias a command to do what you want it too, or create a trivial shell script to do what you want to.\nCreate a shell script named myapp.start, with the contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd Development/rails/myapp\n# Do any common environment initializations here, such as RAILS_ENV=development\nscript/server\n\nYou will likely also have to make a file named .bash_profile in your home directory, or modify one already existing, and add a line like;\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/bin:${PATH}\"\n\nThen, create a bin directory in your home folder, and move the myapp.start script into it. Ensure also it has the owner execute bit at a minimum (chmod 700 myapp.start).\nThen, open Terminal.app, type myapp.start, and you have rails running. Alternatively, type mya then press Tab, and let autocomplete fill the rest, press return. Boom, server running.\nBy extension, you may already understand how to do a log file tail, but I'll continue on anyways. Create another file in ~/bin named myapp.taillog, with the contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntail -F ~/Development/rails/myapp/logs/development.log\n\nAgain, place it in the bin folder, chmod 700 ~/bin/myapp.taillog, then after starting then rails server, quickly hit ⌘t, type myapp.taillog, and you have a log file being printed.\nTwo commands, two additional keystokes (opening the tabs), perhaps that's sufficient?\nThere are two very obvious improvements here. One is to write a shell function capable of \"discovering\" the names of rails apps, so you don't have to write a shell script for each, the writing a sub-command designed to start webbrick/your rails server of choice, and commands for tail -F'ing a few key log files routinely.\nThe second improvement is that it is likely that you could write an AppleScript that does the necessary terminal interaction, and appropriate command execution inside each one. But frankly, I suck at AppleScript and work in bash code and perl code all day, so I'm offering advice relevant to my skill set :).\n\nA: Although you might be tied to the Apple terminal based on the wording of your question, iTerm is superior to the default terminal emulator for scripting and managing multiple windows.\nThe concept of bookmarks allows easy management of a set of windows.\nScripting of iTerm using AppleScript/Automater is simpler, more powerful, and better documented on the developer's web site. (compared to terminal)\nDo check it out if you find the scripting of normal terminal to not meet your needs. I also highly recommend you look into customizing your unix shell to set up aliases for frequently used commands. You will use them in scripting initial tasks for new windows, but also anytime you are in a shell and need to switch tasks rather than having to open a new window.\n\nA: Scripts are nice and all, but you could also just use Automator to record a 'Watch Me Do' where you open Terminal, and throw a few Command+N's in for your preferred # of windows. Et voila.\n\nA: There is a great answer to a very similar question over on StackOverflow, but it probably belongs over here now, so I'll just copy/pasta it in here.\n\nThis is absolutely possible, but it will take some work on your part.  The first thing you need is to set up each window/tab you want in your Settings.\nI have 4 tabs that I open automagically every time I open Terminal.  DB Shell, Editor, Server, and Shell.  These are all within the Sasquatch (don't ask) project, thus the naming.  Each of these should then have a unique command associated with them.\nIn this case, I'm executing vim.  If you happen to have a specific directory you'd like to start off in, you can use something like vim ~/projects/main/.  Really whatever you want to go in there is the command the shell will execute when it opens.  Now you need to open all your windows/tabs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close everything.\n\n*Open a new window for each of your profiles.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Shell menu => New Tab/New Window => Select the profile you created above.\n\n*Repeat for each window or tab you want.\n\n\n*Once you have all of your windows and/or tabs open, save them as a Window Group.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Window menu => Save Window As Group....\n\n*Give your Window Group a name (this is helpful later).\n\n*If you want this group to open every time you open Terminal, check the box at the bottom of this screen, and then hit save.\n\n\n*Close out of all of your Windows/Tabs (time to test it!).\n\n*Open your new Window Group.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Window menu => Open Window Group => Select the group you just made.\n\n\n\nThis should pop up all the windows you just had, in the same position.  Each of the commands you set up in Settings should be launched in their respective tabs.  \n", "Q: How to use terminal to copy a file to the clipboard? I got a file on desktop, file name is ded.html. To copy the file, I click the file and press cmd+c.\nNow how would I do the same thing using terminal ?\n\nA: To copy a file to a destination, use the cp command.\ncp /path/to/file /path/to/destination\n\nSee man cp for more information.\n\nA: If I'm understanding the question right, what you're after is pbcopy and pbpaste.\nOpen a terminal and run:\ncat ~/Desktop/ded.html | pbcopy\n\nThe file is now in your clipboard.\nTo put it somewhere else (i.e. paste it) run:\npbpaste > ~/Documents/ded.html\n\nNow you should have a copy of ded.html sitting in ~/Documents.\n\nA: Lri’s answer is headed in the right direction, but it has a couple of flaws: there is no need to use Finder (the clipboard is part of the StandardAdditions OSAX), and giving a run handler is a much more reliable way to pass arguments from the command line (since 10.4). Making both of these changes greatly simplifies the “escaping” that needs to be done to enter the program in a shell.\nHere is my version (wrapped in a shell function—you could put this in (e.g.) your .bashrc to make it available in your shells):\nfile-to-clipboard() {\n    osascript \\\n        -e 'on run args' \\\n        -e 'set the clipboard to POSIX file (first item of args)' \\\n        -e end \\\n        \"$@\"\n}\n\nfile-to-clipboard ~/Desktop/ded.html\n\nA file that has been put on the clipboard with this script can then be pasted in Finder to copy the file to another folder.\nosascript can also be used as a hash-bang interpreter (since 10.5). Put this in a file (e.g. file-to-clipboard)\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\non run args\n  set the clipboard to POSIX file (first item of args)\nend\n\nMake the file executable (chmod +x /path/to/where/ever/you/put/file-to-clipboard). Then run it like so:\n/path/to/where/ever/you/put/file-to-clipboard ~/Desktop/ded.html\n\nIf it is stored in a directory in the PATH, then you can omit the path to the “script” file.\n\nA: Here's a simple Shell/Bash script. Just paste it in your .bashrc file (or the like):\nfile-to-clipboard() {\n    if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n        echo \"file path/name:\"\n        read FILE\n    else\n        FILE=\"$1\"\n    fi\n    pbcopy < \"$FILE\"\n}\n\n\nA: Thanks to @Lri and @Chris Johnsen. Another option for you:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\non run args\n  set abs_path to do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/greadlink -f -- \" & (first item of args)\n  set the clipboard to POSIX file abs_path\nend\n\nYou can put this into a script, and place that script in any folder in your PATH. This combined the idea of using osascript in hashbang and using readlink for relative path. This would achieve the same as @Lri's bash function, but has the advantage of not adding anything to your bashrc. You might need to install readline. You can do so with homebrew\nbrew install readlink\n\n\nA: There is no way to achieve what you are trying to do using the command line. While Apple offers the pbcopy and pbpaste tools to allow basic copying of text, you cannot use these tools to copy a file in the sense you're looking for.\nWithout going in to too much technical detail, when you 'copy' a file in the Finder using ⌘C, you're not actually copying the file itself, just making a reference to the file on the clipboard and marking it as a file reference. When an application receives this reference when you paste, it has the responsibility of sorting things out, figuring out what you pasted, and ultimately, working with the file as it sees fit. In essence, when you copy a file in the Finder, it saves the path to the file in a certain way to a certain clipboard, and when you paste, it receives that file path and knows to create a new file using the contents of the old one (copy a file to the clipboard, delete it, try to paste it somewhere else, and see what happens, for instance).\nIn this sense of copying and pasting, the tools available at hand are not enough to do what you need. As boehj suggested, you can try to copy the contents of the old file into a new one, but this will only work well for text files. Any binary files you get will be corrupted (try doing this with an image – it becomes corrupted).\nThe traditional command line will fail you in this way, but you can take a look if you'd like into doing this in AppleScript, then invoking that through the command line with osascript.\n\nA: Executing pbcopy < filename command in the Terminal copies the contents of the file named filename.\n\nA: The function below only works with a single file and not with multiple files. It requires GNU readlink which you can install by running brew install findutils.\ncopy(){ osascript -e{'on run{a}','set the clipboard to posix file a',end} \"$(greadlink -f -- \"$1\")\";}\n\nEdit: I removed the tell app \"Finder\" block.\nEdit 2: Reverted back to a version which supports relative paths.\n\nA: With support of relative file:\nclip_img() {\n    osascript -e 'on run argv' \\\n        -e 'set currentDir to do shell script \"pwd\"' \\\n        -e 'set the clipboard to (read POSIX file (POSIX path of (currentDir as text & (first item of argv) )) as JPEG picture)' \\\n        -e 'end run' \"/$1\"\n    # osascript -e 'clipboard info'\n}\n\nrun clip_img path-to-file to copy image to clipboard, and path-to-file could be relative. The file could be jpeg or png files.\n\nA: I'm only 11 years late but I think I have an alternative, albeit, hacky solution. Here's my script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nfzf -m -e | xargs -n1 open -R\n\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using command down'\n\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"w\" using command down'\n\nopen -a \"Slack.app\"\n\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down'\n\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to key code 76'\n\nexit 0\n\nA few disclaimers:\n\n*\n\n*This assumes a macOS environment.\n\n*In the script, I'm using a command line tool called fzf which is not needed. It just makes searching for things easier. You can get it from brew install fzf if you're interested.\n\n*My use case was to find a way to search, find and send gifs quickly in Slack. So I named it 'fzygif'.\n\n\n(The following description references the line numbers in the image above:)\n\n*\n\n*Line no. 3 - fzf -m -e is to allow for multiple files to be selected as well as to search using the exact term used. The result is then piped into xargs -n1 open -R which then applies the open command to each search result, one at a time.\n\n\n*Line no. 5 - Next I use the osascript -e command to simulate Cmd+C which is the Apple keyboard shortcut for Copy.\n\n\n*Line no. 7 - Next I use the osascript -e command to simulate Cmd+W which is the Apple keyboard shortcut for Close Window (just doing a little housekeeping along the way; this could be omitted).\n\n\n*Line no. 9 -  Next I open Slack (the intended target for my recently copied gif; open whatever app tickles you).\n\n\n*Line no. 11 - Next I use the osascript -e command to simulate Cmd+V which is the Apple keyboard shortcut for Paste.\n\n\n*Line no. 13 - Lastly, I use the osascript -e command to simulate \"key code 76\" which is the Apple key code for Enter. This is to automatically send the gif in Slack after it's pasted (this too could be omitted).\nSince a gif is worth a thousand words?

I just upgraded from a 2010 13\" MBP to a 2011 15\" MBP.\nWhen I boot off the Snow Leopard DVD and go into Disk Utility to erase the drive, should I do a simple erase or should I also zero out the drive?\n\nA: You want reinstall your old MBP, because want sale it? So zero out.\nWant install OS X into the new MBP - don't need zero.\n\"Zero out\" is for the security. see here too. And if you come from the DoD, CIA etc.. ;) and you have classified informations on you notebook - use the multi-pass zero-out. ;)\nFor those who have heard that there is someone who has seen such a person who knows how wear-leveling works, ;) TAKE IT EASY :)\nI show you how wear-leveling works when erasing a whole SSD sector-by-sector. (and not file-by-file). \nFor the simplicity imagine than your SSD has only 10 sectors, with numbers from 0 up to 9.\nAgain, for this example we don't need differentiate between static/dynamic wear-leveling, only need to know, than SSD somewhat counting the write-count into each sector on SSD.\nThe scheme is the following:\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nmy DATA          .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\nusage count      0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 \n\nfor the fresh ssd we have usage count \"0\" for all sectors. (in reality this is not true, but for this example it is ok), and we haven't any data on the SSD.\nOk, after a while of usage of normal usage of SSD we get for example the next:\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          .  .  x  x  .  .  x  .  .  .\nusage count      5  6  6  6  5  5  7  6  4  5\n\nso, we have physically occupied sectors# 2,3,6 (so, my data ARE really in these sectors, and does not matter what OS think where they are) and the SSD maintain his usage table. You can see the usage table (bottom row) is nearly leveled. (why is not exactly leveled does not matter for this example, and also we not need discuss how SSH maintain the his free sector table, but need to know, than the SSD's free sectors table has nothing with the OS's free sector table).\nSo, come erase the whole SDD sector-by-sector. What this mean? The OS will write some data (not always zeroes) into each sector sequentially on SSD.\nThe OS send a command to SSD \"write these zeros onto sector 0\". The SSD's wear leveling choose on block with the lowest number of writes and write the zeros into. In our small example this will be sector 8, so we get:\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          .  .  x  x  .  .  x  .  -  .\nusage count      5  6  6  6  5  5  7  6  5  5\n\nI draw with '-' the written sector for the erase process. So the OS \"think\" than got erased the sector 0, but this is not true, because the wear-leveling erased the sector 8.\nNext, the OS want erase sector \"1\". The wear leveling choose the first sector with lowest number of write, so sector 0 in our example.\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          -  .  x  x  .  .  x  .  -  .\nusage count      6  6  6  6  5  5  7  6  5  5\n\nfor the sector 2 - got written into sector 4\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          -  .  x  x  -  .  x  .  -  .\nusage count      6  6  6  6  6  5  7  6  5  5\n\nsector 3 -> 5\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          -  .  x  x  -  -  x  .  -  .\nusage count      6  6  6  6  6  6  7  6  5  5\n\nsector 4 -> 8 (AGAIN got a write into sector 8, because it has the first sector with the lowest number of writes)\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          -  .  x  x  -  -  x  .  -  .\nusage count      6  6  6  6  6  6  7  6  6  5\n\nsector 5 -> 9\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          -  .  x  x  -  -  x  .  -  -\nusage count      6  6  6  6  6  6  7  6  6  6\n\nsector 6 -> 0\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          -  .  x  x  -  -  x  .  -  -\nusage count      7  6  6  6  6  6  7  6  6  6\n\nsector 7 -> 1\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          -  -  x  x  -  -  x  .  -  -\nusage count      7  7  6  6  6  6  7  6  6  6\n\nsector 8 -> 2\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          -  -  -  x  -  -  x  .  -  -\nusage count      7  7  7  6  6  6  7  6  6  6\n\nsector 9 -> 3\nsector number -> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \nMY DATA          -  -  -  -  -  -  x  .  -  -\nusage count      7  7  7  7  6  6  7  6  6  6\n\nAs you can see, after the 1st pass, (the OS think than got erased all sectors) but in the reality sectors 6 and 7 got not touched.\nIn the next pass, the sector number 6 still not get erased. But in the 3rd pass GOT erased. In the reality it is more complicated, but the base principe is:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you erasing the whole drive sector by sector (and not at filesystem level, so not file-by-file), you will get leveled all sectors on write\n\n*while you can not ensure, than all your files got erased on 1st pass, on multi-pass you can ensure this, just because of wear-leveling.\n\n\nNow i show, why some users get confused about the erase. Imagine:\n\n\n*\n\n*we have an empty SSD - all sectors has zero usage count. The SSD has for example 10 sectors.\n\n*we write one file, what got written into the first sector on SSD because this sector is the first with the usage count 0. So the sector #0 will have usage count 1. (again, this is not true in the reality, because of inode table, or FAT tables at the start of SSD - but for the example is ok)\n\n*so, the other 9 sectors are free (and has usage count 0). When you rewrite THE FILE 9 times, you physically got writes into the sectors 1-9, so after 9th rewrite your file is STILL IN SSD and possible to recover it. That is because you write only 1 sector at the time (rewriting only the space occupied with the file).\n\n*in the SSD with 1000 sectors, we can not ensure physical rewriting of the file (with length of 1sector) either in 1000pass erase.\n\n\nBut with the multi-pass erase of the ALL sectors (sector-by-sector) in SSD, you will get cleared all sectors and all sectors will have the same write-count at the end. (and the oldest FILE get erased first).\nJust ask, if something is not fully clear.\n\nA: Zeroing out the drive is typically done for security purposes, but there is also another benefit to zeroing out an SSD - performance. The firmware of an SSD does a lot of complicated tricks to increase disk performance and reliability, but they become less effective the more data the drive has to retain. Since deleting a file or reformatting a disk does not actually turn the bits on the disk back to zero, the drive firmware must still manage that data. If you zero out the drive, you allow the firmware to stop managing all that data and in turn it's able to offer better performance on the data that you have.\n\nA: What I've read on this subject is that it doesn't matter so much what the sectors contain (whether it be 1's or 0's) so much as whether or not the device controller knows that the sector has been erased (as alluded to on this ocz forum post.\nIn this case, the device controller thinks you actually want to store all zeros in all those sections, so it actually doesn't help (it does the opposite of what you want).\nInstead you need to use a special utility to inform the controller that everything has been erased. See this thread\nPlease note: I haven't actually tried any of this stuff myself. I just have been doing research in anticipation of purchasing an SSD for my 2011 MBP.\n\nA: I'm not sure why everyone jumped on the idea that this concerned an SSD...\nStill, while I can't speak to Kyle's answer, as Apple's firmware and hardware differ from other SSD's on the market...unless you're paranoid and intend to sell the older unit, I wouldn't bother with it (7 & 35 pass wipes exist because 0 pass is not infallible).\nBack on topic, though: It's worth noting that the normal 2010 MBP 13\" didn't come with SSD. That said: Erase, re-partition (1 partition, GUID), and reinstall. Enjoy!\n", "Q: iphone voip services allowed? Does Apple and either AT&T or Verizon currently allow voip services to be used? Essentially, would a user be able to have phone services by using just a data plan?\n\nA: From a technological standpoint this is possible - Skype makes voice calls just fine over 3G data on my iPhone. However, as far as I know, AT&T and Verizon do not permit you to run phone devices on their network without a phone plan, so it's unlikely that you will be able to do what you're looking for, as least officially.\nI have heard that some people have had success transplanting the iPad SIM into an iPhone, but it's not something that's guaranteed to work and AT&T may block its use at some point in the future, if they haven't already.\n", "Q: App to Ensure Healthy Coffee Consumption? If I don't drink enough coffee my brain doesn't function.\nIf I drink too much coffee, I end up over-percolating my brain.  \nIs there an app that will recommend how much coffee you should consume to keep your consumption at the optimal rate, so that your brain functions but doesn't over-function?  \nIdeally, the app would go so far as to slide back your coffee consumption so that your body doesn't get used to an amount so that it requires more.\n\nA: so there's an interesting web tool I would recommend: http://chartmyself.com/\nYou can use it to figure out just how much coffee you're drinking and how much you can get away with not drinking.

After downloading Inconsolata's OpenType file I changed TextWrangler's preferences so that Inconsolata becomes the font for the editor window. \nThis worked just fine and the text is now properly rendered using Inconsolata. I take that as a proof that the font is properly recognized by the OS in general.\nThen, I tried to tweak Terminal's preferences to also use Inconsolata. To my surprise, the Terminal window shrank to this:\n\nFor a test, I tried to increase the font size to 288 in order to check whether the text is simply rendered really small and therefore seemingly creating a blank window. Unfortunately, to no success.\nI tried to switch the fixed-spaced font in Mail and as the result, a mail window that previously displayed a message just went blank. I tried TeXShop and was able to successfully changing the editor font to Inconsolata.\nIt seems as if the change works well in some apps and fails entirely in other apps. Does anybody have an idea why this is the case?\nHow can I use Inconsolata in the Terminal (and Mail) under MacOS X 10.6.7?\n\nA: I can't reproduce your problem on my Mac (10.6.7). I downloaded the \"OpenType file\", opened it, installed it into Font Book, and configured Terminal to use it without incident. Maybe try deleting the font from your system and trying again?\n\nA: Try to clear and rebuild your font cache with the following:\nsudo atsutil databases -remove\nsudo atsutil server -shutdown\nsudo atsutil server -ping\n\nThe above is \"my standard answer\" to font problems.\nAfter your reply, I tried to download the font too. Installed it and in the Terminal.app got the same result as you. So +1 to the question - I'm interested too.\nSo,\n\n\n*\n\n*removed the otf version (does not work)\n\n*I downloaded the ttf version from the Google Fonts Directory\n\n*removed my cache as above\n\n*installed the ttf version\n\n*and works.\n\n\nafter it, for the test:\n\n\n*\n\n*removed the ttf version\n\n*cleaned the cache\n\n*installed the otf version\n\n*does not work\n\n\nso again for ttf - and have a working version in my Terminal.app\nHaven't any idea why the otf version does not work. ;(\n\nA: Apparently there is a problem with OpenType fonts in Terminal since Snow Leopard. See this thread on Apple Support: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2775619?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: there's a pretty simple solution for this problem.\nJust convert the .otf file to an .ttf file.\nI used FreeFontConverter for that and now inconsolata works in my Terminal.\n", "Q: iPad 2 cannot connect to home wifi network Hello I have a new iPad 2 and two wireless networks at home. I can only connect to the one from my Actiontec DSL router, not to my Linksys WRT320N. I have followed all the steps on http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1398 and cannot get it to connect. My iPhone and other laptops connect to this network just fine. I have tried setting the router in N, and B-G Mixed modes. I have the network set up using WPA2 Personal and have tried it with encryption turned off too. I have reset everything.\nAny other ideas for troubleshooting?\n\nA: Do you have MAC address filtering enabled on your Linksys?  On more than one occasion when I did, I screwed around with a new device for an hour before I remembered to enter its MAC address to the router.\n\nA: Even if you get it to connect finally to your network, given the trouble you are having now, you will also probably end up with the wifi drop problem.\nThere is currently no solution to it other than turning off your wifi and reconnecting or deleting your network settings and reconnecting. Apple has not to date done anything to correct this problem (you can search around and find lots of people complaining about this one).\nIf you're still in your return period, you might want to think about taking the stinker back and getting a tablet from a company that can at least get the basic telecommunications functions of their tablet right.\n\nA: One suggestion is to check that the DHCP scope range of your WiFi router has enough IP addresses in the pool for an additional device.  Out of the box most routers obviously have defaults of many IPs but it's easy to set it to only a few IPs available when locking down you home network but then forgetting about the limited IP range a few months later.\n\nA: Assuming the article was followed to the letter, including resetting Network Settings, I have to ask: Does the iPad see the network in question? How about other networks?\nIf yes to both, and you're fully up to date in your firmware, then you've actually exhausted all suggested troubleshooting steps, short of restoring the device in iTunes, and the obvious restart and hard reset options previous to that.\n\nA: Linksys routers allow you to enter capital letters in the SSID. Some devices won't connect to a wifi network though when it has a capital letter in the SSID. Remove the capital letter and everything works fine.\n", "Q: This Device isn't Eligible for Requested Build restore error in iTunes So a search around Stack Exchange and days on Google hasn't rendered any solution. You guys are pretty much my last hope short of restoring my Mac, etc.\nI'm attempting to restore iOS 4.3.2 on to my iPhone 3GS, currently running said version. The issue occurs on modified and legit firmwares.\nShortly after attempting to do so, I'll get a message: \"This Device isn't Eligible for the Requested Build\" and the restore fails. Searches show a common theme of people who have modified their Mac hosts file, prohibiting or modifying the Mac's connection to gs.apple.com. Be it a hash or removing the entire entry, neither has any effect on the issue, even following a restart or forced cache flush for the hosts file.\nSince it's a system-wide modification, a new user shouldn't have any effect. I've also compared the basic entries to a known-good hosts file and nothing is missing or broken.\nHopefully you've got some answers!\n\nA: I would take your phone to another computer that works well to restore devices (hopefully that exact device if possible). With so many variables in the restore process, it's nice to be sure it's not a malfunctioning iOS device before reinstalling Mac OS / iTunes.\nOnce you rule out the device having issues - do run through these two articles (and yes, you may have done most or all the steps). You might want to try forcing your phone into recovery mode. Power it off, plug in USB to power or a computer and hold the home button until it goes into recovery mode. This will erase everything if you restore from recovery mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes: Advanced iTunes Store troubleshooting - covers time, firewall, hosts, etc...\n\n*iTunes: Specific update-and-restore error messages and advanced troubleshooting - covers restore mode, and other potential issues.\n\n\nA: Okay, finally today I came upon the answer, though the 'why' behind it makes little sense. The iOS device would not restore on 4.3.2 on multiple computers, versions of iTunes, and using modified and legitimate .ipsw files to test. Though admittedly anticlimactic, what ultimately did work, however, was to restore and update to 4.3.3\nWhy that is, I haven't the slightest clue...but it works now.\nThanks for the input from everyone!\n", "Q: Changing the resolution of the iPod Touch 4th generation My son was playing with my iPod Touch 4th generation and changed the screen resolution.

It has the standard color well for setting the color; you can use any width for the line.  24 px looks similar to the basic picture frame.  And you can use various line styles for the edge.  This is substantially easier than the double box method.\nIn addition, you can do this on a template with those media replacement place holders, and it will be done in descendent masters. \n", "Q: Is it Safe to enter Google Password in 3rd party apps? I would like to get a RSS reader application for my iPad.  It will need to be able to sync with Google Reader because I use Google Reader on my phone and at work.  However, I am concerned about providing my Google password to a 3rd party application.  If I enter my Google password in a 3rd party app, I am assuming that the app could easily send my password back to a home server, store it, and then do anything they want with it.  Is that not the case?  Do Apple or Google provide some kind of password hiding scheme so that 3rd party apps can use passwords without actually being able to see them?\n\nA: If you're worried about it, my suggestion would be to use Google's 2-step verification on your account. Basically, when you're signing in to your Google account from an untrusted computer (one you haven't successfully signed in with before) then in addition to your password you will also need to provide a 6-digit code that can be generated by an iPhone app or texted to your phone. That way, even if your password is compromised, no one can log into your account without your phone.\nFor apps like RSS readers, Google also lets you set up randomly-generated one time use passwords to sign into those apps that you can revoke at any time. \n\nA: How are the app ratings on the App Store? Anyone complaining of their password being stolen? Is the app popular? Using a third party app that ties into Google's API's is like any other app, and requires a degree of trust. If you have reason to not trust the app, don't use it...but realize, too, that your normal use of Google Reader isn't significantly more secure from attacks.\nIf you're concerned about encryption, those authentication tokens and passwords aren't sent in the open for any joe to read; It's as secure as you can hope for.\n", "Q: How do I have my iPhone rotate the homescreen?

I have installed all the drivers supplied by Apple and ran all the updates, but that didn't change anything. I think it's related to the color calibration, since Windows reports it's using \"sRGB IEC61966-2.1\" which was created in 1998. Yeah. \nI tried importing the one from OS X for my display, but that just turned everything a dull brown. I also tried Windows 7's own display calibration wizard, but that just ended up looking horrible. What can I do to get decent looking text and pictures in Windows on this thing?\n\nA: Well, whenever I have a customer with this concern – and they are rare – I normally set the gamma profile to 2.2-ish, then grab the .icc profile for Windows, install it, no more problems. Basically not much different from your attempts...but sadly the only recommendation I could provide.\n\nA: The calibration wizard in OS X is better than the one in Windows but the ICC profile output from the OS X calibrator can be used in Windows. See reference on superuser.\n\nA: Well\nYou can go to this folder in your mac partition\n\nD:\\Library\\ColorSync\\Profiles\\Displays\n\nAnd you will see a icc profile that OS X use to produce color in it's system.\nFile Name like\n\nColor LCD-E2D0B55C-862D-4B0E-BA07-E1BD2579493F\n\nThen Double click to install icc profile to windows.\nNext when you finished install icc profile from mac you NEED to apply to Windows system too.\nGo to program name \n\nColor Management\n\n**You can find this program by use windows search in start menu(If you're on Windows 7)\nOr you can type the name of program on Start Screen (If you're on Windows 8)\nOpen it.\nThen click Advanced tab and then click The \"Change system defaults...\"\n(Another windows will appear now)\nClick \"Add...\" \nThen Select you ICC Profile that recently installed before.

(Boot Camp is just too much of a hassle.)\nIt appears I can allocate only 256 MB of video memory to the VM?\nIs that the limit? Am I out of luck if I want Windows to have more video card memory?\n\nA: Parallels will intelligently cap you at what the Mac OS can operate on, so if that's where it maxes out, and you're running the proper, up to date version of Parallels and Windows, then yes.\nYou can also make adjustments to the Windows OS itself to free up memory (ie. reduce visual elements and effects).\n", "Q: Why doesnt my iPod show album art? I have the iPod 160GB Classic Black. In my music library, each music album is organized into folder on my hard disk, each folder having album art. Why doesnt my ipod display that album art while playing? Just to clarify, the problem is only with some albums, not all.\nEDIT: Is there a specific name that the jpeg file should have?\n\nA: Storing the art in file id3 tags is the only method. Yes, doing it via iTunes is tedious,  it can be automated though.\nMass taggers exist on OSX, software such as beets or bliss. However they download cover art from online websites (google images, discogs...).\nIf you're interested only in copying your folder image to mp3 tags, I'm not aware of an existing tool that do that in batch mode. But a python script could be written for that purpose quite easily using mutagen library.\n\nA: Go into iTunes and make sure the album is set up to have that album art. If it isn't, right click the album and click \"Get Info\" then drag the album art into the area for it in the \"Artwork\" tab. If this still doesn't solve the problem, try restarting your iPod, I have had an issue with my iPod (which is an iPod touch, but the issue might be the same) where album art won't show up until a restart.\n\nA: The album art preview would generate from the image imbedded in the file itself.

Turn on Airplane Mode in the settings. Immediately hard reset the iPhone (Sleep/Wake (Power) + Home button held simultaneously until the Apple logo is seen). Once the iPhone restarts, disable Airplane mode, allow it to connect to Wi-Fi. Usually this will have removed the app by now.\nIf unsuccessful, the next step will be to sign out of your Apple ID in Settings or the bottom of 'Featured' in the App Store, and repeat the process above.\nFailing those two, the process can be repeated while incorporating signing into a different Apple ID to get it unstuck...and lastly a restore in rare cases.\n", "Q: Optimal keyboard shortcut for keyboard layout switching on OS X? Considering that Spotlight is already using ⌘+space and that you cannot use combination of modifiers alone, I would like to see an ergonimic alternative.\nI can't use the following combinations due to conflicts with other software\n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl+space - auto-complete in IDEA\n\n\nA: I use ctrl + ⌥ + space. It's typeable via left hand, doesn't collide with the search window shortcut (as ⌥ + ⌘ + space does) and I haven't found any other overlap yet.\n\nA: I'm using ⌥ + ⌘ + space as it doesn't trigger autocomplete in Eclipse, Idea or Quicksilver/Spotlight/Alfred.\n\nA: How about ctrl + ` (backtick)\nEasy to type that with your left hand.\n\nA: I use ctrl + space which is may be the best option I found out to be useful and ergonomic.\n\nA: I use ⌘+⌥+C to trigger my clipboard manager.\nI haven't found it overlapping any other keyboard shortcut, and the keys are close enough to be pressed using one hand (the thumb for the modifiers and the index for \"C\")\n\nA: I use ⌘+⇧+\\ (next to Enter). Works fine for me.\n\nA: What's wrong with the default ⌘+⇥? (or ⌥+⌘+⇥ to switch in the opposite order)?\nIt's perfectly ergonomic to have your thumb on the ⌘ key and use on of your others to press the ⇥ key.\n\nA: I use ctrl+⌥+⌘ for \"global\" keyboard shortcuts.\nctrl+⌥+⌘ +S seems like a good \"switch\" shortcut.\nYou could probably also use ⌥+F[1-12] key if you install Apptivate [$3 on the Mac App Store].\n\nA: I've always been using Cmd+Alt+/ and been pretty happy with it. I don't remember having any conflict with any app.\n\nA: I use caps lock to switch language. 1 keystroke.  You can set this in system preferences/keyboard/input sources:\n\nUnfortunately this only works if you are switching between a Latin input source and non-Latin input source like Russian, Greek, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, etc.\n", "Q: Does using Spaces slow down the system? Did anyone experience if using Spaces slows down the system? Is there are difference between using 4 spaces vs 9 spaces?\n\nA: *\n\n*your application windows are opened already (and rendered) no matter what space they are in.\n\n*if you do \"show spaces\" (either with \"corner\" or hotkey), OS X must transform each space into the \"reduced\" form so you can see it on-screen.\n\n*\n\n*If you have 8 windows in 4 spaces, only 4 spaces will render\n\n*if you have 9 spaces, the OS will render 9 spaces (and the same 8 windows).\n\n\n*each Space eats additional memory\n\n\nI'm using 9 spaces and here is my own experiences:\n\n\n*\n\n*There in NO difference if you have enough memory (no swapping to HDD to render everything)\n\n*There IS a difference if you don't have enough available memory to avoid a swap to the HDD (perhaps too many apps are open). In this case, when you do \"show spaces\" there is an increase between showing 2 spaces vs 16 spaces (but nothing that is really bad or terribly noticeable)\n\n\nSo,\n\n\n*\n\n*spaces does not slow down your system noticeably (in the most cases), but\n\n*definitely eats some more memory (but a small amount), so you may get swapping a little bit sooner, and swapping is that what is really slowing down your system.\n\n\nps: these are my experiences, others may have other opinions.\n\nA: Although there is some very tiny overhead tracking the views of 4 or 9 windows - and your graphic card may be stretched to render more than X items at once - so it feels slower and renders slower animating the in/out of the spaces.\nAs far as the apps and the system - each window that is running simply gets coordinates. If it's marked on screen 1 and offset X and Y or no screen and X and Y - the system does no extra work. Each window must be tracked and only windows that are somehow visible get refreshed. Spaces adds no extra work or saves any work as far as the application is concerned.\nIf you tend to open more apps due to spaces organizing them - that will slow the machine down - but it's not inherent that spaces makes anything on the system or app level slower other than an added graphics drain to animate the changes. When you are not switching - it's probably faster since fewer windows have to draw into active viewports if you have less \"on screen\" at one point in time.\n", "Q: installing python2.4 on osx10.6? I prefer installing stuff from their source and dont use package managers generally. Has anyone here tried building python2.4 from source here? If so, had any luck with the same? \n\nA: Probably you have some troubles building it from a sources. My 0.02$:\n\n\n*\n\n*check here https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/lang/python24\nIn the files subdir you can see the needed patches to sources, but especially the patches needed to the Makefile and configure, for the successful build.

I am using iWeb11 and already have purchased two domain names and configured one of them with ME, this works fine but I would just like to be sure that I don't need to buy an additional ME account if it isn't absolutely necessary. Thanks you in advance!\n\nA: Each account only allows one domain name to be listed. To get full separation, you will need either a family pack (for 5 accounts) or multiple main accounts on MobileMe.\nSince iWeb does allow multiple sites, perhaps you could use forwarding or redirect for the subsequent custom domains. Making a CNAME pointing www to your mobile me entry point is the cleanest way to pass traffic, but there are other ways if you don't mind the hassle and exposing your mobile me hosting when the redirect shows the URL where you are hosting.\nMost web-savvy people can tell a domain is hosted from mobile me even if you use the \"offical\" one domain per account method - it just is easier to keep your mobile me name from the address bar of most web browsers that way.\n", "Q: Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter and Widescreen (FullHD) Monitor Just got myself Apple Mini DisplayPort to VGA to connect my early 2011 (pre Sandybridge/Thunderbolt) 15\" MacBook Pro to Samsung SyncMaster 2494HM monitor.\nThe monitor is currently connected to my PC via DVI, so I wanted to use its VGA port to connect my MBP as I frequently need to use them both at the same time and want to avoid shuffling cables.\nAnyway, I have a problem with making it work in FullHD (1920x1080 Widescreen, monitor's native resolution).\nThe widescreen part in particular.\nBasically if I choose its native resolution it doesn't fill the whole width of the screen. When I selected it for the first time it was on full width until I clicked Refresh Rate dropdown menu - no changing involved as was only able to use 60Hz anyway). Then, oddly enough, it switched to something between 4:3 and 16:9. So everything is a bit... too narrow.\nInterestingly full width widescreen works perfectly on other 16:9 resolutions, but the res is basically too low for the 24\" screen.\nAnyone has any idea why's that and how to fix it?\n\nA: The solution for me was to hold down the Option key while clicking on the \"Scaled\" radio button in Display Preferences. That offered many more display resolutions, including widescreen ones.\n\nA: I can't remember where I found the solution for this issue, but I had to remove /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist and restart the machine.\nThis seemed to reset any remembered displays and the the resolution and aspect ration returned to normal.\n", "Q: Tilde with hiragana-input I'd like to type the two characters \"tilde\" ('~') and \"fullwidth tilde\" ('～') with a german keyboard, since I need those characters quite often, for example when writing hiragana in romaji, for example 'っ' which is spelled ~tsu or song titles, for example \"惑いて来たれ、遊惰な神隠し～Border of Death\".\nI tried the combination Alt+N, which produces '~' with the austrian keyboard map enabled, but does absolutely nothing in hiragana-mode.\n\nA: Could you not create entries for keystrokes to generate these characters in the User Dictionary?  I think the Kotoeri Help tells how to do that in general.\nAlso you can make a wave dash by typing nami dasshu or part of it in Kotoeri and hitting space once or twice 〜\n\nA: Wow, never seen a 'fullwidth tilde' before. You can open the keyboard viewer (System Preferences -> Language & Text -> Input Sources, enable \"Keyboard & Character Viewer\" to see where special characters are. Click on the language flag in the top menu and select \"Show Keyboard Viewer\". On the virtual keyboard you can see all characters and modifiers that are available. I checked the German layout briefly, and can't find the long tilde, though. But I guess you can find it by using the Kotoeri/Hiragana layout.\n\nA: You could do that through services. You need the \"Get Specified Text\" action. Set input to \"no input\" and choose appropriate application. Also set \"Output replaces selected text\" if needed. In the text edit area type \"~\". Then duplicate the service, but replace \"~\" with \"～\" instead. Save them.\nOpen System Preferences and go to Keyboard->Keyboard Shortcuts->Services. Look for services you just created and assign desired shortcuts to them. That's all, now you can paste those characters in any app which supports osx services\nI've created these services for you, you have to unpack the archive to the ~/Library/Services folder.\n\nA: Without repeating loads of the original post, you can take a look at this answer on this site, and follow the instructions to enable such special characters to be inserted using the press-and-hold method of text input - in the example below I used special keyboard character indicators, but you could make \"~\" bring up your own custom list, including the ones you need.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Dual LCD Would it be possible to customize a macbook so that it has 2 screens instead of 1?\nwhat i mean is, could i hook up the lcd from another macbook and connect so that it has 2 screens..\nif it could work, would i have to connect it via minidisplayport or is there a way to connect it to the video board..\nessentially something like this..\nhttp://www.freeonsmash.com/news/2008/12/12/apple-macbook-tribook/\n\nA: Check this, maybe cover your needs:\nhttp://www.screenrecycler.com/ScreenRecycler.html\n\nbut it is commercial 30$.\n(You sure know this: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924)\n", "Q: How can I backup my system to a remote server (AFP, Samba, or NFS share)? Here's the goal: I have a backup server with a ZFS filesystem with built in compression and snapshots. All our machines backup there nightly with rsync, and then a ZFS snapshot is taken, so we have backups of how eveach machine looked at the end of every day.\nThe problem is that with Mac OS X, the resource forks are not copied since the remote machine does not support resource forks. What I would like to do is rsync to a .DMG file which resides on the backup server. This way, I'd have an exact, bootable image of how my system looked each night.\nAs a bonus, the backup server is also a NetBoot server, so this would actually allow me to boot from how my mac was at any point in history.\nI created an image of my Mac's drive and copied it to the backup server. Now, when I open it on my mac and run rsync, it runs for a period (sometimes more than an hour, sometimes less) and then gives me a ton of I/O errors. The image is stored on a RAID array, I am sure there are no I/O errors.\nI think the connection with the Samba share may be getting overwhelmed... I've tried with AFP also, and I get the same result... What could be causing this and how can I resolve it? Or, any other ideas on how I can update the remote DMG file?\n\nA: Setup a new volume on your Nexenta/OS box for your backup and set it to share out as an iSCSI LUN. Then use one of several iSCSI initiators for MacOS X to attach the backup volume on your back. On your mac, format the volume as HFS+. Now you can use CCC or rsync, etc. to do your backups.\n\nA: Have you looked into using Carbon Copy Cloner? I use this to a manual bit-for-bit backup of my SSD to a network drive once a month or so and it works flawlessly. I know it does incremental backups, and I've had no trouble dumping my drive over gigabit ethernet.\n\nA: Not the exact answer to your question, but you can rsync resource forks too. Here are really nice articles about:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.afp548.com/article.php?story=20050219192044818\n\n*http://www.kremalicious.com/2008/06/ubuntu-as-mac-file-server-and-time-machine-volume/\n\n*http://quesera.com/reynhout/misc/rsync+hfsmode/\nps: do you use solaris or freebsd?\nSo, what im tried now:\nI have a remote OS (not mac) and mouned it via fuse/sshfs (over the slow ADSL).\nsshfs user@example.com:/path/to/dir /Users/me/Mount/myfs -oauto_cache,reconnect,volname=MyFs\n\nOn my macbook entered this:\n/usr/bin/rsync -avE /Users/me/tmp/bk /Users/me/Mount/myfs/tmp/test\n\n(the /tmp/test already exists on the remote computer)\nand got this:\nbuilding file list ... done\nbk/\n._bk\nbk/.DS_Store\nbk/._.DS_Store\nbk/Icon\\#015\nbk/._Icon\\#015\nbk/test.rtfd/\nbk/test.rtfd/.LSOverride\nbk/test.rtfd/TXT.rtf\n\nsent 311127 bytes  received 186 bytes  15186.00 bytes/sec\ntotal size is 6874  speedup is 0.02\n\nAs you can see, resource forks are converted into dot_underscore files and copied into remote location. (for example, the custom icon for the directory bk too).\nTherefore i don't understand, why you can't rsync into remote zfs?\n\nA: I don't know why, but the connection to the server was being broken during the file copy and I am assuming it was because the high amount of data being transferred at such high speed was more than the backup server could handle; it would become unresponsive for a short period and the Mac would forcibly disconnect the DMG, and the backup would fail.\nI found a solution: before backing up, in System Preferences, I lowered my Ethernet NIC's speed from 1000Mbps to 100Mbps. Then, the backup seemed to work flawlessly, because the data rate was constrained and the backup server didn't get overwhelmed.\n", "Q: Removing gray part of BBEdit/TextWrangler How can I remove the gray part in BBEdit/TextWrangler.\nI want it to be white as the other part.\nScreenshot (see part marked with red square):\n\n\nA: It is called the page guide.

I was just wondering what the published accuracy of the GPS chip in the iPhone 4 was...?\nI also understand that increased accuracy can be had if the hardware has WAAS capabilities. It is this true? Does the chip the iPhone 4 have WAAS capabilities? How accurate are chips with WAAS?\n\nA: No WASS or any differential signaling is built into the iPhone. Apple doesn't publish performance data for GPS or the chipsets/algorithms in use.\nIt's just standard GPS precision (which tries to be precise to 1m on the earth's surface but never is for a variety of reasons) In practice, iOS is usually accurate within 5 meters when the dot shows no circle on the map app (called good or low Dilution of Precision). If Selective Availability (SA) is ever turned on again, all bets are off as the government can intentionally introduce errors of 70 or more meters if desired.\nThe assisted part of the iPhone GPS makes it faster to get a fix based on assumptions that can be made by trilateration based on cached cell tower and wifi hotspot locations. This doesn't make GPS any more precise or accurate since it's the best signal for iOS location data when it's present.\n", "Q: Can I change the icon of a mounted disk in Transmit? I noticed these icons in the resources folder of Transmit:\n\nI was wondering how I can change the standard cardboard mounted disk icon with the transmit logo to one of these.

Is there an activation fee?  Anything else I should be aware of?\nUPDATE:\nIt seems there is less knowledge as to what Verizon's policy is, and as luck would have it they're my current provider.  I would like to know what their policies are also, if anyone happens to know.\n\nA: So long as it's an unlocked iPhone, you can use any SIM card to activate the unit. It doesn't actually have to have a plan attached to it. I'm not aware of any carrier on the world that only supplies contracts and foregoes monthly plans, so there should be no issue with your carrier of choice. Contacting Verizon is a wise idea with respect to their policies, as without further details your question is pretty broad.\n\nA: You want the SIM card that activates that device as an iPod. The owner can remove that from his plan so it will never be used again with a carrier but will allow you to restore and use the phone as an iOS device until you get your own SIM card.\nI don't know about the verizon phones, but jailbroken AT&T ones are working fine these days with prepaid SIM and you of course will be welcome to join AT&T with their standard iPhone plans and rates if you don't want to deal with jailbreaking.\n\nA: You can take the phone to any AT&T store and they will give you a new SIM card and create a new account or change the phone if you already have an account. You are not on a contract with AT&T because you did not buy the phone at a subsidized price by them. There is an activation fee, but if you call AT&T Customer Service, they can remove that for you. AFAIK, this only works with AT&T as I have personally done that, for Verizon it might work differently.\n", "Q: How do I install Homebrew on Tiger?

Should we get Lion right away or wait for 10.7.2 or something? I'd bet most people (specially fan boys) will say to get it now. \"Simple\".\nedit: What you guys have to say now that Lion has been around for a while? Is my current accepted answer still the rule? I see sooo many bad reviews as never before from any apple release (other than Final Cut X).\n\nA: As an IT-service company we use several OSes. We use Freebsd on our internet servers, and Linux, Windows and OS X on desktop clients. I'm personally an OS X user since 10.1(Puma) and have never used Mac OS 9 (I have a strong unix background).\nOS X's stability and upgrading smoothness is unmatched by either Windows or Linux! Only Freebsd is comparable.\nWe usually upgrade live servers with freebsd and clients with OS X immediately after release, and have never had any problems. (I mean any.) This is probably because we don't use any \"special\" applications, just common Apple products like iWork, iLife, and Omnigroup products, etc.\nOS X (the system) runs immediately without any flaws. There can be some problems (as @boehj told above) with third party applications, but 95% of the applications usually work without problems, because developers build them in advance. You can already see applications that are Lion-ready.\nSo, if you are not a hardcore OS X user, ofc, you can wait a while \"to make sure\", but from my experience: it is enough check how your application run under Lion (by visitng the developer site) and if they are ok, simply upgrade & go. :) Forget the \"windows service-pack\" syndrome :). \nAs Kerri said above - ofc, backups are good. Not just when upgrading, but \"just because\". In 10 years I have never needed to restore anything because of an upgrade. Ofc, we restored when we moved from PPC->Intel and when switching to new Mac models, but never \"just because the upgrade went wrong\". I'm pretty sure that apple decided selling Lion ONLY as a download via the AppStore (without media) that the upgrade process would be well tested.\n\nA: This \"wait for service pack 2\" or \"wait for 10.x.2\" stuff isn't very helpful imo. \nWhat might be more helpful is planning your upgrade process - remember your computer should be working for you instead of the other way around. \n\n\n*\n\n*To me, this means that if you enjoy\nplaying with new OS features above\nall else then yes, upgrade as soon\nas possible to start enjoying them.\n\n*If you use your computer for leisure and aren't interested in how it works, as long as it does, then upgrade reasonably swiftly if there is a new feature you think will improve your use of your computer.\n\n*If you use your computer\n\"professionally\" - e.g. you make\nyour living from using FCP, or\nLogic, or CS5 or whatever on your\nMac then it would be prudent to wait until the people who make the application(s) you use professionally have certified them for use on the new OS, released any patches, etc.\n\n\nAnd in all of those cases, but especially the last one, make a good backup before upgrading (ideally a disk image with something like Carbon Copy Cloner if you're in the 3rd category above) so that you can roll it back if you have trouble.\n\nA: M-Audio's FireWire Solo drivers (and others) didn't work out-the-gate with Snow Leopard.

I seem to remember getting sound card functionality (i.e. drivers from M-Audio) around 10.6.2.\nIf you don't have anything in particular like in this case, you'll probably be OK (see caveat).\nMy personal view is to wait and let the 'proper' beta testers do the hard work for me - this applies to any software - before I jump in.\nThere can be no absolute answer here unless you use a specialized piece of equipment that requires drivers and those drivers aren't ready yet.\nCAVEAT\nWhen Snow Leopard was released there was a very significant bug related to guest accounts and deletion of data, where \"logging into a guest account and then logging out [could] delete user information on all accounts.\" This was only fixed in 10.6.2. (Snow Leopard also shipped with an \"an obsolete and exploit-vulnerable version of Flash\".)\nApple referred to the bug in the 10.6.2 release as \"an issue that caused data to be deleted when using a guest account\".\nNow, I'm not saying this will happen to you. But I am saying that it's often wise to wait a little while for major bugs such as this one to be ironed out before you jump on a new release.\n\nA: I tend to wait about one week before upgrading to a new version of Mac OS X. That's usually enough time for any glaring troubles to be revealed and for workarounds to be found for any that might affect me.\n\nA: By and large - the QA of Mac releases is so good for general consumers, that there rarely is a show stopper that causes mass pain. For most, waiting a day or a week or a month is no different than jumping on day zero.\nThe answer to your question is much more a factor of how much customization you make on your mac and what software you NEED to have running.\nProfessionals that can't afford down time usually clone their boot drive so they have a known and fixed amount of time to get back to the last version if the upgrade doesn't go so well for whatever reason.\n(So - it takes minutes to shut down, connect the external and boot from it and get back to work - and it takes hours to wipe the new OS from the internal drive and go back to the saved version. Disk Utility and Super Duper / Carbon Copy Cloner all make this \"undoing\" of the upgrade easy for non-professionals and professionals alike.)\nIt's easier to generalize about having a backup, a plan and time to upgrade than trying to pigeon hole what bugs might cause some few people trouble.\n\nA: My advice over the years to customers is always to wait until the \".1\" or \".2\" updates arrive from Apple. For example, right now the version you can purchase is Mac OS X 10.7.0. While it is quite stable, in a few weeks, Apple will probably release an update to 10.7.1 and it will come with some bug fixes and improved implementation of some new features. If you wait, you will likely have fewer problems to contend with.\nThat being said, I have been testing 10.7.0 and I'm quite impressed with how stable and useful it is right now. But I still have a full system installation on 10.6.8 on another disk partition, and I can dual-boot into either one if I need to work with a program that I already own that is not fully Lion-compatibile.\n\nA: With Apple OS updates, I stick to this advice a bit closer.  This is similar to each new Windows release too.  If you have lots of non-apple hardware and driver specific devices you depend on or use often, wait until the manufacture of the device supports the new updates with new drivers or states their hardware is compatible.   Like beohj, my experience with this was with some M-Audio products (Sound card, recording interface, etc.). This was with the release of 10.5 I think.  I jumped the gun on upgrading, but it was a couple months before I could use my audio equipment properly when new drivers were released.\nIf you don't have any aftermarket driver dependent hardware or own all apple hardware, upgrades will go pretty smooth for the most part.  Apple does a decent job of making sure all their hardware will continue to work.  If you run into issues with anything aftermarket, it might be months before you see updates, so proceed with caution.\n", "Q: Personal Encyclopedia app I figure I should ask this before I start writing my own...\nI'm looking for an app that I can use as a repository of information about a subject.  Here's the sort of features I want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Individual \"articles\" where I can write about the things I've learned/discovered/theorized\n\n*Be able to tag these articles with keywords (like tags on this question)\n\n*Be able to group these articles into folders of related stuff.\n\n*Smart folders would be especially nice.\n\n*Be able to write these articles in a simple format.  Markdown would be wonderful.\n\n*Be able to search through the articles to find stuff/Spotlight integration.\n\n*Must be a native Mac app. Not a web app. Having a companion iOS app would be a major bonus.\n\n*Article versioning would be nice.\n\n*Automatically detecting related articles (even a simple algorithm) would be nice.\n\n\nBasically, I think I want an off-line, personal Wikipedia that I can write in Markdown. Do any of you know of an app (or apps) that does what I'm looking for?\n\nA: You might try also DEVONthink which is a bit expensive but works for me.\n\nA: Voodoopad or yojimbo would be nice starts. Ask @ccgus fir the pitch\n\nA: Trunk Notes might work, but it's coming at the problem from the other end as it's an iOS app instead of Mac OS.  It uses dropbox for sync, though, so you could edit the files on any machine.  A Mac translator/renderer to work with it would be cool.\nEdit:  Looks like someone is trying to make a desktop app to work with it:  http://code.google.com/p/trunkdesk/.  I have no idea how well it works as I haven't tried it yet.\n\nA: I understand, than one of your basic criteria was \"desktop\", so the following is only from my personal experience:\nIn the past (years ago) I'm faced this problem too. Tried VooDooPad (it is really nice personal wiki) and several other desktop apps. I was used VooDooPad long time and still a part of my \"knowledge base\" is still in it.\nBut, now I'm using a open source wiki http://www.foswiki.org . While don't want talking about its features, pros and cons - I must say: moved into foswiki because simply needed share my personal knowledge base with my wife and son and friends... (remote access). Email and syncing is not a solution it is a pain.\nSo now, you're sure will start with some desktop app, because now this is your best idea. Like me in the past.\nBut my prediction is: you're sooner or later will need share knowledge with others, with remote access, security and so on. And transforming things into something new is not always an easy task.\nMy best advice now:\n\n\n*\n\n*wait a month - Lion arriving\n\n*upgrade to Lion (you get automatic version control).\n\n*buy for 50USD the Lion Server (new strategy from Apple - the server is really cheap)\n\n*start use the build-in Lion-Server-wiki, with fulltext, versioning, sharing.. etc.\n\n*don't make buying decision before you installed Lion (1 month) :)\n\n\nA: After a bunch of research, I've decided to go with Evernote.  Getting all of the features that I want will require the paid subscription, but I think it'll be worth it.  It also has some nice features of text detection in images and integration with many different file formats.\nIt does not have Markdown integration (that I found), but I found it easy enough to change the default font to something monospace, and if I really need formatting, it supports rich text as well.\n", "Q: Booting Mac OS 10.6.7 from an external hard drive if internal drive running Ubuntu? I have a old Mac Mini. (1.66 GHz Intel Core Duo)\nRunning Mac OS 10.6.7\nThat is not able to upgrade to “Lion”.\nAlso several large external “Firewire” hard drives.\nWhat I would like to do is install and run Ubuntu on the internal Mac Mini drive, and then boot into a clone of my current Mac OS from the external drive, once in a great while.\nIs this doable?\nI now run rEFit on the internal system so that I can boot into the Ubuntu system on my external drive. I would like to reverse this.\nI can not afford to buy a new mac at this time.\nBoot loaders are a mystery to me. Do I need to install rEFit on the Ubuntu system?\nThank you in advance\n\nA: The myths page from the rEFit author has a lot of information about the subject of booting operating systems that are usually booted via BIOS (i.e. Windows and Linux). \nIn particular:\n\nMyth: You need rEFIt to install/boot Linux\nYou don’t. The firmware’s built-in boot volume chooser (hold Option to activate it) will recognize Linux boot CDs as well as bootable hard disks and let you boot them. (They may be labeled “Windows”, though.) For triple-booting you’ll get only one item in the built-in chooser, but you can use GRUB, LILO, or NTLDR to act as a second-level menu to choose between Windows and Linux. The gptsync tool can be compiled to run on Linux.\n\nWhile you can install some Linux distributions on a GPT-partitioned disk, it's much easier to repartition the internal disk and put an MBR partition table on it, depending on the version of Ubuntu you are going to use.\nThis is all described at the Ubuntu MactelSupportTeam site. The fact that you are going to boot Mac OS X every now and then does not change the approach; in fact it is even recommended on that page.\nBefore you make any changes, just make sure you have at least one, better two backups of all your data.\n\nA: I can't really answer your question but I should point out that Lion CAN run on core duo macs, it's just being limited by one file which states which macs can't be used. This is just because the core duo macs are old, but are still capable.\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/04/08/hack-mac-os-x-lion-for-core-duo-core-solo-mac/\nThat link will explain how to do the easy hack (which is literally just deleting one file)\n", "Q: Leave Apple Developer organisation and buy personal membership I have an Apple Developer Account, but it's in organization that I no longer work for. How I can leave this organization and buy my own membership in the Apple iOS developer program?\n\nA: It wasn’t as easy when you asked, but now it’s quite easy to add a new AppleID and then switch roles. Even if the company does not want to do any of the work, you can set up a new AppleID and promote that to the owner and then eject your desired account.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/roles/\nWhen that is done, you can reapply. I would open a support case with developer support before you start to be sure they can help and you are cleared. They have been exceptionally helpful to us in getting past employees that quit and move the company accounts around as needed. Just give them time to check on things - the more a rush you are in, the more they wonder you’re trying to pull a fast one.\n", "Q: Can applications purchased through the App Store be used after deauthorization? If I deauthorize a computer from the account used to purchase a certain app, will that app continue to work as usual?\n\nA: The Mac App Store does not currently have the concept of an \"authorized\" or \"deauthorized\" computer. If you download an app legitimately from the Mac App Store, it is DRM free (at least with regard to execution), and completely functional on your computer.\nThe immediate answer to your question is actually that you cannot deauthorize your computer in the Mac App Store :).\n", "Q: Free OS X solution for getting screenshots, cropping and annotating them I am looking for a simple/fast, free solution that will allow me to get screenshots from different windows, crop areas that are interesting to me and adding some comments to them.\nIt's main use case would be to track UI changes in applications, so it would be a good idea to support layers.\nOn Windows I was using Paint.NET but this is not available on OS X. Also, do not recommend GIMP, it's free but not simple and loads really slowly.\n\nA: If you prefer an all-in-one solution to the Grab + Preview combination, try Skitch.\nThe lite version is free and should be enough for your -described- needs.\n\nA: If you are interested in a portion of the screen, try Cmd+Shift+4, which turns the cursor to a crosshair; you can then select the portion of the screen and it will be captured to your desktop. By the way, Cmd+Shift+3 captures the whole screen. As far as annotation, you can follow jm666's suggestion and use Preview.\n\nA: i am using jing from techsmith for a long time now and enjoy it very much:\nhttp://www.techsmith.com/jing/\nyou can even record screencasts in the free version. and it's cross platform (windows and osx).\n\nA: Use Apple's built-in Grab.app to capture screenshots, Apple's built-in Preview.app to crop, and the open-source Inkscape to annotate the bitmap.\n\nA: You can do everything from OS X’s Preview app.\nUnder File you’ll find Take Screen Shot. After you take it, the image will open directly in preview, and you can use the Annotate options under Tools, and more that appear from Show Edit Toolbar under View.\n", "Q: Change an app from \"all users\" to \"this user only\" I've been on my mac for quite a while now, using only a single account (mine).\nI've added a new account for my girlfriend recently (yes it's getting serious), but I have a little problem. \nI'm a physicist and therefore use a lot of domain-specific apps (matlab, macvim, latex, ...) which my girlfriend doesn't need. \nHow can I change these apps so they only show up in my account's applications folder (I am the admin). Vice versa, I would also want that none of the apps she installs are visible on my account. \nHow would this be done? Do her privileges prevent her from installing global apps?\n\nA: You have two questions here. ( and ~ is short for the /Users/current_user folder)\n1) For apps only to show up in your account - move them to ~/Applications \n2) If a user is not part of the Administrators group then that user cannot install apps in /Applications which is the normal place for shared Applications. Non admin users can install apps in their home folder ~ but not another user's Applications folder nor the system Applications folder.\n", "Q: Delete/disable app-installed services? I've written a bunch of services for my own use that I use frequently, but recently it's getting tougher. \nI installed some apps (such as Skim.app, apptivate) that introduce their own services (eg. Open URL in Skim) which I don't need/use. These services clutter up my services list though (Skim alone add about 4 services to the list you get when you right click a Finder item). \nIs there a way of removing these services from the list? I've tried looking for them in ~/Library/services but they aren't there. Where should I look?\n\nA: In 10.6, you should be able to disable them by unchecking them in the Keyboard->Keyboard Shortcuts->Services list in System Preferences. For previous versions of OS X, there's a handy little app called Service Scrubber.\nHunting down and deleting services for apps you've already deleted can be troublesome; there are some detailed hints and tips in this article. Summary: find all the Info.plist files on your system that contain \"NSServices\", using a terminal command like:\nfind / -name \"Info.plist\" -exec grep -l \"NSServices\" {} \\;\n\nand (carefully) edit the suspect Info.plist files by hand.\n\nA: If you dislike the way Services are now handled, please leave feedback at http://www.apple.com/feedback/ \nNot only are Services now hidden in System Preferences/Keyboard/Keyboard Shortcuts, but also newly installed apps freely add all their services, and worse, by default check them all.\nOne must go to Keyboard Shortcuts to even learn what was installed, and to uncheck any unwanted, in a small window that does not resize, from a list that gets absurdly long.\nThere are Services folders in System/Library/, /Library and ~/Library, from which you can trash any you won't use.\n", "Q: Can I install apps on Lion without using app store? Is it true that I can only install app from app store in OS X Lion? \nCan I not install app from any other source?\n\nA: Not true - mean sure can install apps from dmg.\nThe Lion remain a full-blown OS, with all common functions, like Terminal.app, root access, Developer system, and so on. When here is no way block installing applications if you will have a root access, so Apple sure will NOT TRY do this.\nThe following is only my opinion:\nOn the other side - most of developers will sell their apps via AppStore (because it is easy), so here will be less \"demo downloads\" (what was possible activated by simple serial#). IMHO, over the time will be here more and more application in AppStore in two versions, like for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*SudokuLite.app (like current demo versions) - free,\n\n*Sudoku.app (full paid version)\n\n\nA: No, it's not true. Without breaking the NDA I can say, that many developers made their software Lion compatible and distribute it from their sites.\n", "Q: How long does it take to get confirmation? I am an iOS developer and I just enrolled in the mac developer program. The site says i'll get confirmation in 24 hours, what is the 'normal' time in which confirmation is usually received?\n\nA: It depends. It can take a few hours for a personal enrollment to several days for a company enrollment. If you want your company name (rather than your personal name) to show up on your apps, you'll need to take the extra time to confirm.\nI also suspect that during times of peak enrollment (say after an announcement like at WWDC) that the confirmation takes longer simply due to the number of people applying to play with the beta. \n", "Q: how do i access my @me.com email account I just set up a new @me.com email account through iOS5 beta and was wondering if there was a way to access through the web, or if anyone knew the imap server info.

I would like that typing www.site1.dev in the url bar serves me the site in that directory.\nSo I outcommented the include vhosts rule in the httpd.conf file, and in the httpd-vhosts.conf pasted this code based on the apache docs:\nNameVirtualHost *:80\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot /Users/me/Sites\nUseCanonicalName off\n\nVirtualDocumentRoot /Users/me/Sites/%0\nAllowOverride All\n\nRewriteEngine On\n</VirtualHost>\n\nYet my browser can't find the server. What am I doing wrong?\nI did notice that in my sharing system prefs the IP my ISP gives me, and their domain is included in the link created there to access my sites folder. I would expect a simple localhost there not an ipaddress....\n\nA: You need to update you httpd-vhosts.conf to something like this:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/Users/me/Sites/www.site1.dev\"\n    ServerName www.site1.dev\n</VirtualHost>\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/Users/me/Sites/www.site2.dev\"\n    ServerName www.site2.dev\n</VirtualHost>\n\nHaving each domain separately in your config allows you to have separate server options for each, e.g. Rewrite config, separate log files, etc.\nThen, update your /etc/hosts and add this at the end:\n127.0.0.1   www.site1.dev\n127.0.0.1   www.site2.dev\n\nThis step is particurarily important as this is where your OS looks first when resolving domain names. Otherwise it will not know what www.site1.dev is.\nThen simply restart the server by disabling Web Sharing and enabling it again.\nTo make sure your config works you can check apache logs (access_log and error_log) via Console.app (Files > /private/var/log > apache2).\n", "Q: Is there a fullscreen Terminal app that is faster than iTerm? I am used to using the Terminal in full screen on Ubuntu. On Apple, the native Terminal app doesn't do full screen, and iTerm, which does, is very, very slow when you use a multiplexer like tmux in the Terminal. I'm using iTerm 0.10.\nDoes anyone know of an OS X Terminal program that can go full screen and that is responsive when running tmux?\n\nA: Try iTerm2. It's supposed to be significantly faster than iTerm, but since I've never used the first version, I can't say for myself.\nI have no complaints about it, that's for sure.\n\nA: Interestingly, at Apple's special event on June 6, 2011, one of the items in the additional features slides when they were talking about Lion was \"Full screen terminal.\"\n\nSo just waiting until next month will probably get you want you want as part of the system software.\n", "Q: Why are Ctrl+a and Ctrl+f broken in Snow Leopard?

But then the fan starts running on high in a few seconds, as if the laptop is not getting enough ventilation. Is this normal? \nI would think that the Air would be designed in a way to allow it to be ventilated adequately in this kind of use case. \n\nA: Just because the fan starts running faster does not mean that the machine is overheated.\nIf you really want to, you can open the Air's lid after the external monitor is connected. The Air's screen will stay off but the machine should stay cooler and not have to run the fans at a high speed.\nApple even has a knowledge base article for \"clamshell mode\".\n", "Q: When sharing calendars on iCloud, how do I show other people that I'm occupied, but not why? Now that I will be able to share iCal calendars (e.g. on iCloud, MobileMe), for events that are marked as private is there a way to make other people only see that I am occupied at a certain time but not why? Can I somehow make an event private?\nIf this still will not be possible, what is the current workaround for this? How could I set up this scenario? \n\nA: The availability picker on Lion (when it even works) only shows the binary status with your busy times blocked.\n\nThe CalDAV request to show busy times just shows that you are busy, not why.\nIf you don't share private events (or keep that secure with a password to subscribe), your event details are as secure as anything on a web server with controls before you can retrieve the data. (not perfect security, but not wide open to anyone)\n\nA: As a workaround, you could move the private events to separate calendar, also published, but configured as above. Of course your subscribers would need to add it to their subscription.\n\nA: The issue being raised is bigger than MobileMe or iCloud.  It's fundamental to how we all work today.  If we aren't all on the same google docs account or the same exchange infrastructure we need to be able to share calendar information.\nThere are a couple of good solutions that I have used and seen people use in the past.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Google Calendar and have iCal sync - share the Google Calendar and enable Sharing but check \"Share only my free/busy information\"  This solution works on all platforms and is free.\n\n*Use tungle.me.  It syncs with iCal and gives your people a nice purple-y interface\n\n*Change the way you calendar slightly (sounds strange but I know someone who did this).  Create a separate calendar that you will share with people and on that calendar you (manually) block out your free/busy time.  The benefit of this is that you have total control and there is no extra syncing.\n\nA: There is a service called Tungle that seems designed to do what you need.

I've always been a Mac fan and the way game developers treat Mac users is just sad. \nNo big games (with the exception of Portal 2 and Starcraft 2) have been released for Mac this far. I've always been into gaming, but playing Starcraft 2 over and over gets really boring once you think about all the possibilities you would have if Mac ran Windows games natively.\nI know there are several ways to play Windows games on a Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*You use Boot Camp on your Mac to run Windows. The problem here is: Should I buy a Mac just to install Windows on it? (I believe you have to own a copy of Windows, too which costs additional money as well.)\n\n*You buy Parallels Desktop (costs money!) which doesn't require you to reboot your Mac every time you want to use Windows. This program also requires you to have a copy of Windows (money!).\n\n*You can install custom \"wrappers\" which allow you to run or install Windows software on your Mac. The wrappers require an installation program like Wine(Skin), Cider, CiderX and so on. Wine is free, but you still need to have a copy of the game.\nMy question is: can I play the games that I bought for PC on Mac the 3rd way? Would this be legal?\nMy Problem with the first two is that they both would cost me a lot of additional money - it's like paying for one game about 5 times.\n\nA: I take issue with your premise: NO BIG GAMES (with the exception of Portal 2 and Starcraft 2) have been released for Mac this far.)\nEvidently, you're unfamiliar with Steam. I don't know what your definition of \"big games\" is, but in my mind Civilization V, Counter-Strike, Assassin's Creed 2, etc. qualify. Best part about Steam is that if you buy a game, you can download it for Windows and/or Macintosh.\nYes, if you want to play Windows PC games the best option is to use Boot Camp. And yes, you have to buy Windows to install in Boot Camp. Of course, if you were to purchase a Windows PC you would also have to buy Windows. \nSo, I'm not sure what you expect here… Apple should throw in a copy of Windows for free? Apple should spend money and resources to incorporate Wine or Cider into the OS and go through the tremendous support and legal headache while simultaneously cutting its developers off at the knees by allowing Windows applications to flood the ecosystem? — not that it would ever happen… ;)\nApple's last OS update, 10.6 was a $30 upgrade. 10.7 Lion will also be a $30 upgrade. Seems to me your beef should be with Microsoft's pricing of Windows. (Oh, and lazy/cheap game developers of course. heh.)\nTo answer the central question: Wine and Cider are both legal, since they use no code or binary data from Microsoft's implementation of Windows.\n\nA: In no way playing game under Wine/WineX/Cider running under MacOS or linux could be considered illegal.\n\nA: Here are some big games too:\n\n\n*\n\n*all games from Blizzard (for example World of Warcraft)\n\n*Sims\n\n*Call of Duty\n\n*and more others (check for example Amazon.com - Mac games)\n\n\nRunning games under Wine is not a \"legal\" problem.\nI know one old case, where someone got a game-ban because he played WoW under Wine and the Warden (wow build-in antihacking watcher) report this as illegal activity. But this is an old case, now playing Wow under Linux and Wine is pretty common, so probably will not be any problem with other games too.\nAs @Robert told, here is another problem. Performance issues. Some games will run fine under emulators, some others not. You need check forums or google for reports.\nFor some games you can use VirtualBox too (what is like Parallels or VmWare), but im not sure about its DirectX performance. (Parallels has good DirectX performance), but again as for your BootCamp, will need Windows.\nAt least - Wine is legal platform - if the game run with it - you can use it.\n\nA: I don't think you'd be causing yourself any legal problems by using Wine, though how well it would work for all games might be another thing. I think you'll get the best results from bootcamp. \nI appreciate you don't want to spend a lot on a copy of Windows, which is fair enough if you'll just use it for games, so have you considered looking for an \"OEM\" copy of windows - a lot of software and hardware re-sellers will sell those and that's about the cheapest option.\n", "Q: Since yesterday I can't login to iOS developer forum.

It works quite well on all devices I have tested with, but I am having some iPad troubles.  Let me explain my steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I go to Settings, WiFi\n\n*Select my test network\n\n*Immediately upon connecting to the WiFi, Safari slides up from the bottom (sans URL box, with \"Log In\" at top) with my captive portal page.\n\n*I login to my captive portal page\n\n*I am redirected to Apple.com, which loads fine\n\n\nThe iPad is now allowed to use the internet, and all is well.  The problem is, the iPad doesn't see it that way.\nThe \"Log In\" form of Safari never slides back down out of the way, as I would expect.  If I press Home open up Safari, and try to open a page, I am immediately given the error:\n\nCannot Open Page\nSafari cannot open the page because it is not connected to the Internet.\n\nThere are no connectivity issues at all, and the iPad indeed can connect to the Internet.  It just believes that it can't.\nA few things that the problem isn't:\n\n\n*\n\n*DHCP/DNS/IP Addressing issues... I assure you it has a valid IP address as assigned from DHCP, and the correct DNS addresses, and gateway.\n\n*WiFi Connectivity... Signal is strong, I am sitting 5 ft. away from the AP, and I can continuously ping the iPad with no packet loss or high latency.\n\n*\"Turn it off/on again\", or \"Forget the network and rejoin it\" are not solutions, and do not solve the problem\n\n*A problem with my captive portal...  The captive portal itself is fine, and there are no problems with it.  Again, the iPad can load apple.com from its own \"Login Safari\" just fine.\n\n\nI believe the problem is that Apple has written some code, trying to be \"intelligent\" that detects when my captive portal page logon is complete, so it can save any form data for posting to the server later for automatic logon.\nMy question is...\nWhat cue is Apple looking for to know when captive portal logon is complete?\n\nFor what its worth, I stumbled across a forum thread discussing the captive portal detection.  I'd rather not outright disable it... I just need to find a way to make it work.\n\nA: alright I may have some light to shed on this:\nI just got off the phone with an Apple Engineer and he said a few things to me that make sense.\nHe has stated that the \"crippled browser\" should never be displaying any other page than\nour captive portal page. He stated that if after logging into captive portal I am redirected\nto www.apple.com/library/test/success.html the iPad's \"crippled browser\" will close.\nIf I see another page (like I saw apple.com and not http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html which would have closed the browser.) it is likely that the system hosting captive portal is not directing me to the exact original page requested. Which was http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html \nIt could in fact be truncating or altering the original URL, which is possibly why I see apple.com's main page in the \"crippled browser\"\nNo resolution yet, as I still need to confrim that the wireless controller is indeed doing this, but it makes sense, and might help.\n", "Q: OS X Lion - download once and install on multiple computers I have multiple computers which I will be installing Lion on.

I need to free up some space and I know I have audio files saved on the iphone that are just orphaned..\n\nA: Backup the phone using itunes and then restore to defaults and reload the backup. That should delete any files not in the itunes database. If the files are used by other apps they might still hang around and you might need to tell itunes not to load that app any more.\n\nA: Have you tried the free iPhone Explorer, or iPhone Disk (US$19.95) for Mac or Windows? They enable you to view your iPod or iPhone in the Finder, browse the file directory on the device, and copy or delete files on the device directly, without using iTunes.\n\nA: yes, but the only way i know of requires mobil terminal, which requires jailbreaking and is unfortunately only available on software no later than iOS 2.0\n", "Q: Resolving Time Capsule Problem Broke IPv6 Tunnel Some time ago my Time Capsule's light was blinking amber. When I opened the Airport Utility, it indicated that my IPv6 tunnel was down, I assume due to the remote IPv4 host being down. I was given the option to Skip or Ignore the problem. I believe when I skipped the problem, the light remained blinking amber, it wasn't until I chose the 'ignore' option that the light returned to solid green.\nSince that day, I've been completely unable to use my IPv6 tunnel.\nConsidering that World IPv6 Day is underway, I would love for my tunnel to work again... How do I undo the damage I've previously done?\n\nA: It appears that my Client IPv4 (as configured on the TunnelBroker website) had gone out of date. I was unaware my IP address had changed since after changing ISPs some time ago.\nBut I figured it out. Bring on the v6!\n", "Q: How can I get a me.com e-mail address? Was this a service only offered with Apple's Mobile Me? Is there anyway I can still get an e-mail address ending in @me.com?\n\nA: It's basically not possible to make a new MobileMe account while the transition to iCloud is happening. There are some loopholes (like adding a new account under an existing Family account) - but most will have to wait until iCloud is released. The official word on that is a vague - in the fall of 2011.\nFrom the Apple preview page covering Contacts, Calendar and Mail as part of iCloud:\n\nMail that delivers. Free.\nWhen you set up iCloud, you get a free me.com\nemail account. iCloud automatically\npushes new email messages to all your\ndevices, so your inbox is up to date\neverywhere you check it. And iCloud\nkeeps all your folders in sync, no\nmatter which device you’re using.\n\nThat was posted June 6, 2011, and I think that's pretty definitive. Free me.com accounts for all. It's unclear if you can get a new one today, but when iCloud opens to the public, you'll be able to sign up for one.\nThe sign-up page for MobileMe was disabled when iCould was announced at WWDC. People with unredeemed paid memberships can request a refund as they can no longer create a new account. Also, the free trials are suspended - presumably until iCloud opens this fall. The MobileMe transition FAQ documents this in detail and should be updated if things change before iCloud details are released.\nThe only way to get an account is if you already have a Family Pack with unallocated sub accounts. It is not clear if and how that sub account will transition to iCloud, but that may be an option for some to establish MobileMe email after June 6, 2011 and before iCloud opens for business.\n\nA: Definitive answer on this is now at Apple's KB as of 15 Jan 2015\nExtract:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*If you created an iCloud account on or after September 19, 2012, your email address ends with @icloud.com. Learn more about @icloud.com mail addresses.\n  \n*If you created an iCloud account before September 19, 2012, or moved to iCloud with an active MobileMe account before August 1, 2012, you have both @me.com and @icloud.com email addresses.\n  \n*If you had a working @mac.com email address as of July 9, 2008, kept your MobileMe account active, and moved to iCloud before August 1, 2012, you can use @icloud.com, @me.com, and @mac.com email addresses with your iCloud account.\n  \n  \n  In each case, you can sign in to iCloud with either your @icloud.com email address or the Apple ID that you use with your iCloud account.\nIf you created one or more email aliases for your account, be aware of the following:  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You can change or delete an email alias, but if you delete an @mac.com or @me.com email alias, you can't add it back to your iCloud account.\n  \n*You can't sign in to iCloud.com with an email alias. Sign in with your @icloud.com email address or the Apple ID that you use with your iCloud account.\n  \n\n\nA: You can actually just go into the \"Mail, Contacts & Calendars\" section of your system preferences on your Mac.  Click the add account option on the left and then click the iCloud option on the right, it will give you the option to generate a new apple ID account with an option to make it a free @me.com account.\n\nA: Steve Jobs mentions in WWDC 2011, that \"We'll give you a me.com email address,\" when speaking about iCloud.  So - if your question was in reference to whether the @me.com addresses will disappear with the coming of the iCloud service, no, I don't think so.\n\nA: From this Apple Support page:\n\nCan I create a new MobileMe account?\n  You can no longer create a new 60-day trial account or start a new subscription using a code contained in a MobileMe box. However, if you have a Family Pack subscription, you can still create new family member accounts. \n\nEdit: I hadn't targeted the actual question very well: \"How can I get a me.com e-mail address?\".\nTurns out, you only need to create an Apple ID using your an existing email address which you will need to verify; then using iOS 5, OS 10.7, or Windows Vista or later, and create an iCloud account which will include your choice of an available @me.com address.\n\nA: On a Mac running Lion or higher, click System Preferences, select iCloud.\nIf you have selected another account, logout.\nClick on Create an Apple Id ... rest is self-explanatory and go through the steps.\n\nA: Ah hah! So I found a tricky way to get my me.com address. I downloaded the iOS 5 developer preview onto my iPad 2. The new iOS gives you the option to create a me.com e-mail address.\n\nA: I have been looking for a way to get @me email id and finally after a lot of search found a way here\n\ngo into the iCloud settings on your Mac and check Mail, you will be\n  prompted to create a @me.com address.\n\nI'm not sure whether there is any other way to create @me address from me.com or icloud.com but the above worked for me!\n\nA: I don't recall seeing it mentioned during the process of signing up for iCloud but @me.com addresses/aliases are automatically created alongside your @iCloud.com email address.\nFor instance, if John Doe created an iCloud account today and subsequently obtained his John.Doe@iCloud.com email address he could also receive email sent to John.Doe@me.com without doing any extra work on his end.\ntl;dr - If you already have an @iCloud.com email address you can automatically receive email sent to the same address ending in @me.com.\n", "Q: I'm looking for an iPhone app to collect money (determine money goals) I wonder if there is an application (on iPhone) to determine money goals, for example I can set an aim \"vacation on Hawaii - $5000\" and see the progress from 0-100% after adding money.\n\nA: Moneywell will look at what you are saving but shows the amount you have saved not the %age but you can set monthly/weekly budgets so that money is saved as you go along.\n\nA: I suppose Numbers would do the trick.\n\nA: Mint's budgeting features and goal tracking would seem to do what you want, but I don't know if those features are carried over to the Mint iPhone app to the point where you would be happy with them.

I have another Mac, 15\" MacBook Pro(Mid 2010).\nMy White MacBook got corrupted, and not booting up at all. I need to re-install Snow Leopard on it, but I have lost OS X Install Disc that came with it.\nI have Snow Leopard Install Disc that came with MacBook Pro, but I don't know if this particular disc is optimized for MacBook Pro only, or can work with any Mac desktop or notebook.\nGenerally MacBook Pro have 4 GBs of Memory, while White MacBook have 2 GB.\nMay be, install disc that came with MacBook Pro is optimized to run on 4 GB, and not on other Macs.\n\nA: Retail discs are usually early releases (10.6.0 or 10.6.3) lacking driver support for newer hardware models.\nDiscs bundled with specific hardware models have full driver support and are usully more recent versions (10.6.5 or 10.6.6) but are also restricted to running on just that model or release series. They also contain install packages for any bundled applications such as iLife or iWork.\nIn most cases the retail disc should work and you should immediately apply the latest Combo update to add any missing drivers or feature support. If the retail disc gives you any errors you'll need the bundled disc.\n\nA: Gray discs are hardware limited.  That is, designed to be installed on only one piece of hardware.  Black discs are able to be installed on any hardware.\n\nA: The only reason Apple came out with the additional Snow Leopard retail disc was to update the (bundled) install disc from version 10.5.6 or earlier.  No worries.. even if you don't have a Snow Leopard disc just do what the others have said and go to the 'Apple' (upper left corner) and select 'Software Update' and you will be updated to the latest version of Snow Leopard.\n", "Q: Adding \"Lookup in the dictionary\" in the pop-up list in Firefox?

I have a working HE.net IPv6 tunnel configured on my Apple Airport Express but the rest of the machines on my LAN aren't picking it up automatically.  Connected machines work fine if I configure IPv6 on them manually.\nSniffing the network appears to show that there aren't any RA packets being sent.\nI seem to recall reading that the Airport will only send RAs if it has a private (RFC 1918) address on its ethernet port.  Mine doesn't - I have public IPv4 addresses.\nCan anyone confirm this, or offer a work around?\n\nA: Make sure your Airport Express is updated to the latest firmware. Up until recently the Airport Express would get an IPv6 address for itself but would not issue them via DCHP which is why you needed to do it manually. This may be what's happening for you. The Airport Extreme only gained DHCP support for this at the last firmware update so I'd assume the Express did too but I don't have a newer AE to know for use and the older model doesn't support IPv6 at all.\n", "Q: Find logged on user and network home directory with a bash script I am trying to use a script to find the username and home directory of the user that is currently logged on to a Mac. This is what I have, and it works, but is there a better (i.e. simpler) way to do it?\nuser=`logname`\nuserHome=\"eval echo ~`echo $user`\"\nuserHome=`$userHome`\n\nThe script will almost definitely not be run by the logged on user.\nThis is Mac OS X 10.6, joined to an Active Directory, and a network user is logged on.

All human readable.\nIs it possible to inject this part of the Touch's backup into the iPhone's backup and then sync it?\n\nA: Theoretically, it is possible to replace parts of the backup package, but in practice, I have no real success with that plan. Often the format iTunes uses to store the data changes with versions of iTunes and editing files under a database's nose can lead to corruption.\nIt's easier for me to connect both devices and quit the program to make sure it's a clean boot when you resume the app. Then I use PhoneView to read the preferences from the app bundle on the correct device and replace that folder on the bad device.

If you wanted to move the active window, you would press a key and drag the window by clicking anywhere on the window. If you wanted to resize the active window (proportionally), you would press a key and turn the wheel.

Unfortunatelly, it didn't.\nI had to use Patch  to flash the hdd's firmware and set it hard to sata1.\nAfter burning cd, rebooting (hold c to boot from cd), you execute run.bat which does the job.\nThen I had changed the cd to dvd installation disk with 10.5. \nThe disk was visible under the diskutil.\nI created partition and rebooted again.\nAfterwards the hdd was visible when restoring time machine backups.\n\nA: Wikipedia shows MacBook 2,1 as either a late 2006 or mid 2007 pre unibody MacBook (white or black) and RamJet notes that 2.5\" drives greater than 500GB do not work with pre-unibody macs.\nYou might have luck visiting http://support.apple.com/manuals/YourSerialNumber to confirm the marketing name and the manual might list the SATA requirements for replacement drives.\nIf you have reset the NVRAM, reseated the HDD and tried resetting the NVRAM after the reseat, then it's looking like something hardware has failed or the drive won't work with your hardware.\nSince Apple wants and only supports you when you install Apple approved drives (since they make sure the fit and firmware are all compatible), your best bet is to contact Samsung to see if that drive is tested or needs certain pin settings / firmware for use with Leopard and your mac. Also, the place you bought that drive might be willing to help you.\nI'm hoping the information I found is wrong and you have success, but it doesn't look good for that drive in your mac.\n\nA: I just tried three new hard drives and a 2006 Macbook wouldn't recognize any of them making them impossible to format with the OS X 10.4.6 Install discs.

How can I back up the phone numbers on my phone?\n\nA: If your whole contacts (Name, Cel, Email) are stored on Gmail, you can use it to sync over the air directly to your phone.\nFirst, create a backup of your contacts and delete the ones you have in your iPhone (this will prevent any merging issues).\nGo to Preferences > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account\nAdd your Gmail account and when prompted, turn on the \"Contacts\" option. This will import all your contacts from Gmail directly to your phone.\nYou're done! your Gmail contacts should be now in sync with your phone, if you use Outlook as your main application to edit your contacts, remember to sync it with Gmail first.\n", "Q: Why does the webcam on my Dell SX2210 go all green and purple? I'm using an aluminium unibody MacBook (pre unibody 13\" MacBook Pro) running 10.6.7 with a Dell SX2210 external monitor. The monitor has a built in webcam and USB hub. When I try to use the webcam with my Mac I often a very strange looking green and purple picture, as shown below.\nThe problem isn't specific to just one app as it's the same in both Photo Booth and Skype. Also the iSight built into my laptop works just fine.\nThe strange thing is that for a couple of minutes after plugging in the USB cable the picture is fine, but then it starts degrading - at first just a couple of of spots of green show up, and then it gradually spreads.\nI've had the monitor for nearly 2 years now and it definitely didn't do this when I first got it. However recently I've been wanting to use Skype more and found that it's doing this.\nI didn't install any drivers for it so I guess it's just using standard USB video drivers built into OS X.\nI don't have easy access to another Mac or PC to try this with but I have tried a different USB cable, to no avail.\nI'd greatly appreciate any suggestions!\nExample of problem\n\nA: That sounds like an issue with the camera - is the monitor still in warranty?

I currently have an iPhone 4 (GSM) and I'm signed up to the iOS development program, meaning I can install iOS 5.0 on it. The problem is that I use this same phone as a personal phone, I'm wondering if it's a good idea to install a beta OS on it or not. I'd really like to be able to take advantage of some of the newer features that iOS 5.0 introduces right now rather than having to wait until the fall.\nThe main things I'm concerned about are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Major limitations (e.g. if an entire app or one of its major features doesn't work on the beta, I'd want to know about it).\n\n*Data loss\n\n*Being able to sync with Google Accounts (I currently use Google Sync to synchronize as much data as possible, ideally I want to keep using it in addition to Apple's new sync/backup service. Is there any way to do this or are they mutually exclusive?)\n\n*Any other issues you can think of which should cause me to be wary.\n\n\nA: It's important to understand that when Apple uses the term \"beta\" they only mean \"somewhat functional, most major features in place\". It could fail repeatedly, and definitely, definitely has a ton of bugs, many of which could be data-destroying or could lock up the device.\nIn the last 4-5 years a lot of web apps -- and Google does this a ton -- use the term \"beta\" to mean \"not quite feature-complete but otherwise good-to-go\". This alternate meaning seems to have unintentionally led people to believe that it's what \"beta\" always means.\nWhen Apple changes iOS 5 to \"golden master\" status they'll mean that it probably still has bugs that need to be fixed before it goes live but should be pretty close to the final version, barring any late-breaking discoveries, and should be pretty safe to use. That won't be until right before it's released, however.\n\nA: Apple actively states that you should in no way install development releases on any hardware you rely on. More specifically they state that \"you should install this on dedicated development hardware\" meaning a second phone.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are even the slightest bit concerned about stability, don't install it.\n\n*If you are not going to use it to develop/test against, don't install it.\n\n\nAnd, my personal favorite:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have to ask this question, don't install it!\n", "Q: Using the external accessory kit could one iPhone charge another iPhone with a double headed dock connector? Using the external accessory kit could one iPhone charge another iPhone with a double headed dock connector?\nOr would the power supplied be so small that it wouldn't worth charging it that way?\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend using this cable at all. The iPhone dock connector uses the pin 23 to provide 5V of electric flow. Since you're using a double headed dock connector, the most reasonable technique the manufacturer used is just to split the same cable that comes from the USB head into the four pins each dock connector should at least have to provide power and sync capabilities (or two pins if it only charges the iPhones).\nSince the current must at least drop by half on each phone because of the splitting, neither would be properly charged. If both iPhones seem to charge, the least dangerous consequence would be that the charge time will be at least doubled.\nUsing this technique can (worst case scenario) disrupt the device's PMU. My advice: don't.\n\nA: Chargers usually deliver a voltage a bit higher than the battery voltage - otherwise there would be no reason for net flow toward the battery.  The delivering battery voltage may not be enough to charge the receiving battery fully - but it would do something if the receiving battery is low (beyond where voltage dips) and the sending battery is charged well.  \nThe other problem is that manufacturers (Apple especially) use special codes delivered by the charger when first plugged in that let the phone know it's ok to start receiving charge.  This is a form of proprietary handshaking that lets the manufacturer only (and others that have sniffed the code) make chargers.  If you can embed a microprocessor to handle that (or better program the phone to do that) then you're all set.\n\nA: As per this question: \nHow much current/power can be drawn from iPhone 30-pin connector?\nThe current one iPhone can supply to any device connected via the docking connector is so small that it wouldn't charge the other iPhone's battery - it would simply help power the other iPhone.  If you turned the target iPhone off, then I suspect you might get a 50-100mA charging current, which is 1/20 or 1/10 of the normal charging current, but due to the inefficiency of conversion if your source phone started out at 100%, and your target phones started out at 0%, and you turned off all the wireless features of the source phone, you still wouldn't end up with even a 50% charge on the target phone once the source phone hit 0%.\nAnd it would take 8 or more hours to do it, as well.\nHowever, for an emergency charge that might give you enough power to make a call, it might work if you plug them together for an hour or so.  I don't see any particular advantage to doing this, if you have enough foresight to buy the right cables and accessories, then you might as well buy a AA battery based iPhone charger instead and carry that where you would otherwise keep your special iphone to iphone charging cable.\n", "Q: I want a twitter feed to alert my iPhone On my iPhone, I'd like to get a push alert when there's a new tweet from a twitter account.

Now I don't want to download that application any more because I'm on 3G plan which is costly. I paused it but don't know how to delete it. Can anyone help me on how to delete a paused app download?\n\nA: If you can't delete the paused download (which, I'm thinking, suggests you aren't on the most recent release of iOS), then the simplest option that doesn't require a restore is going to be to find a WiFi hotspot and let the app finish downloading. Personally, I'd go that route (especially if out-and-about or on vacation, etc.) before wiping my data and having to restore again.\nAlternatively, leave it on paused until you get home to your primary network. Your phone doesn't care two cents about your paused app downloads, so it shouldn't get in the way of anything.\n\nA: I can confirm that paused downloads get removed by rebooting in iOS 5. \n\nA: I've successfully deleted them like any other app: press and hold on the icon until all of the icons start shaking, tap the X in the red circle on the icon and confirm the deletion, then press the hardware Home button to end deletion mode.\nI will say that these have all been apps that failed to complete downloading, nothing that I've intentionally paused, but I'd think it would be the same.\n\nA: *\n\n*Download and open iTools.\n\n*Click Filesystem.\n\n*Go to the downloads folder.\n\n*Delete everything.\n\n*Reboot iPhone.\nAfter reboot, don't enter your Apple ID.\n\n\nA: Slide left on download and delete.\n", "Q: How to set Apple Magic Mouse permanently with Mac? Recently I bought Mac and Magic mouse. I am new to Apple hardware. I  was trying to install mouse with mac. I installed it successfully. But whenever I restart the machine I need to configure magic mouse and pair with mac again and again.\nIs there any way so that Mac remembers this magic mouse just like wifi names?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You shouldn't have to continually pair the mouse after every restart, this indicates there is a problem.\nFirst thing I would try is to power everything down, and then turn the mouse back on (small switch on the bottom) so that the mouse is \"discoverable\" before restarting. Ensure you follow these set up instructions after restart.\nMake sure you have installed all system updates. OS X 10.6.2, for example, fixed a problem with bluetooth pairing.\nIf this still doesn't fix the problem, you could try to Reset the System Management Controller (SMC) (see this Apple support document.)\n", "Q: Excel CSV export encoding According to my tests, Excel on Mac, when asked to save data as CSV file, uses MacRoman encoding. My questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does it always happen or there is some setting that controls it? \n\n*If there's a setting, is there a way to make it save as UTF-8? If not, is there a way to export Excel file with characters not in MacRoman preserving these characters? \n\n\nA: I have found a blog post which outlines an Applescript solution to a similar problem. I've adapted it to your needs. Note that I haven't done any proper quoting of cell values or anything, it will need some tweaking to be more robust. It's also not the fastest solution in my minimal testing… but it's a start.\nThe key is write X to openFile as «class utf8»\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n    activate\n\n    set outFile to (path of active workbook)\n    set fileName to (name of active workbook)\n    set outFile to (outFile & \":\" & fileName & \".csv\")\n    set openFile to open for access file outFile with write permission\n    set eof openFile to 0\n\n    set lastCol to count of columns of used range of active sheet\n    set lastRow to count of rows of used range of active sheet\n\n    repeat with r from 1 to lastRow\n        set rowStr to (value of cell r of column 1 of active sheet)\n        repeat with c from 2 to lastCol\n            set cellVal to (value of cell r of column c of active sheet)\n            set rowStr to rowStr & \",\" & cellVal\n        end repeat\n        write rowStr & return to openFile as «class utf8»\n    end repeat\n    close access openFile    \nend tell\n\n\nA: Having done a fair amount of research on this I think I can safely say that you can't change the export encoding. However what you could do is add a step to your export procedure whereby after saving the csv to disk you could open it in a text editor (I used Coda but quite a few others will do this) and use that to then save it out using another encoding.\n\nA: Why not just simply open the created file in TextEdit and then use cmd+shift+S to save a duplicate and then choose from dropdownlist UTF-8?\n\nThe big advantage is that you do not have to know explicit the encoding created by Excel like in method proposed by Bart. For my language (polsih) it was not Macroman, but some variation of it.\n\nA: I found the easiest thing to do was to just let excel export to csv in its own dumb way, then open up a terminal and do the following:\niconv -t UTF8 -f MACROMAN < file.csv > file-utf8.csv\n\n\nA: Simply use an editor like \"Editra\"\n- Open the csv-file\n- Change the encoding, e.g. to UTF-8, by klicking the encoding-type in the status bar of editor window\n- Save the file again (it is now UTF-8)\n- Done :o)\n\nA: Use Open Office to save the csv file. There you can choose the encoding.\n", "Q: Debugging Wifi issues on my iPhone Sometimes I try to connect to a Wifi network and the only things that connect are the IP Address and the Subnet Mask - the other fields (DNS, Router, Search Domains) are still blank. My iPhone shows it's connected to the wireless network (three blue bars in upper left corner) but I never get connection in this case.\nWhat is actually happening when I only get Subnet Mask and IP Address? What can I do to troubleshoot the issue? I feel like I have a really vague notion of how to troubleshoot any sort of Wifi issue besides \"turn everything off and back on again.\"\n\nA: In a nutshell - you are seeing the difference between a local physical network and the IP infrastructure needed to route packets out of that local network.\nProbably the iPhone obtained the IP address and the network via BOOTP instead of DHCP.\nThe best resource for troubleshooting is this article by Apple. Since it is more general than your question - I'll go on a bit in case to cover background and some concepts.\nThe three bars means your hardware can talk to the base station hardware. It will pass packets and discover all devices connected to that network. Since some networks are not ever connected to the internet - you only need an address and a netmask but not the other information.\nOnce the basic link is up, From a network perspective - the iPhone allows for three methods for configuring the IP4 WiFi network stack. Do note that IPv6 and other automatic route finding protocols like Bonjour may allow some things to work when DHCP fails - but you don't see them in the preferences and not everything will work in this case.\n\n\n*\n\n*DHCP \n\n*BootP \n\n*Static\n\n\nWith Static - you are on your own and have to know and enter all the fields by hand. BootP is an older method for a device to ask for network information from a router and DHCP servers typically answer either flavor of request transparently. (i.e. most DHCP implementations react and supply information if asked via BootP protocol too - DHCP has more bells and whistles, so it's more common these days)\nIt is a valid DHCP response from the server to send back any, all or none of the information so you really need to know how the router is set up to know if information is being lost or corrupted when it's sent or if the router simply isn't sending that information. In practice if the router is not received in the DHCP response the router sends in response to your phone's request for DHCP information, the iPhone sends all information out to the physical device that answered the DHCP request and hopes for the best.\nIn practice - I almost always see the routers field (DHCP option 3) filled - so the most likely problem when this happens is a software malfunction in the router or simple bad networking due to range, interference, overload or incompatibility.\nMany DHCP servers have BOOTP disabled and don't answer BOOTP requests,\nas the client would end with insufficient information to connect and use the internet. \nSome client may use BOOTP at first and if it doesn't work they will request the information with DHCP.\nWith BOOTP only some predefined fields like IP address and network (subnet mask) can be sent to the client, but not a geatway needed to reach beyond the local network (Internet).\nDHCP has many options defined for the client, like routers (DHCP option 3) as default gateway to the Internet, domain-name-servers (DHCP Option 6) for DNS name resolution and many other.\nIf you have access to the router or can experiment over time and with other WiFi clients (phones, laptops, pads) you might be able to tell if the router is overloaded/broken/interfered or if that's just how it is answering DHCP requests - just with the basic information. In all likelihood - if your phone works on other networks, you didn't somehow break it just for this one network and you can wait it out or try again (which helps if the root cause is temporary interference or overload), or stay off that WiFi until it's fixed by the owner.\nApple devices seem to use the last method used to configure the interface (BOOTP or DHCP). Furthermore they seem to stick to that setting for a long time, not trying the other method after a few failures.\nThe best order for client devices to use would be DHCP first and BOOTP as a last resort. BOOTP nowadays is only useful for devices which boot (the OS/installation) from the network and even here DHCP should be used to get the full configuration of the client.\n", "Q: App for Cropping and Resizing an image Is there an application where I can crop an image then resize it into custom dimensions?\nI would like to crop it like with the built in Command+Shift+4 , then in a window I could select the dimensions.\nSo is there an app for this?\n\nA: But of course Preview!\nTo resize: Choose Tools > Adjust Size, then enter the size you want to change the image to, then click OK\nTo crop: Click the \"Select\", then click and drag to select the area of the image that you want to retain.

Have not opened it yet, so I can return one of them.\nSo, can someone point me to the place of this top-secret information?\nUPDATE: To clarify the question - I am interested in the HD video recorded with the built-in camera. The intention is to replace the old P&S camera with this device. Thought that, if not Apple, maybe current users comment on that. A rough estimate is enough. Don't need a detailed to-the-last-byte calculation.\n\nA: Time is based more on the size of the files versus a limit on the device. As in, You can only put (less than, due to OS and formatting, etc) 8 or 32GB (On a 8GB, usually you have a little over 6GB to play with, on 32 I think more like 29GB or so). \nThe 'time' capacity was just done using an average file size and the capacity. The same would be for 'songs' or 'videos' it can hold, like how iPod Classics were 20000 songs in your pocket. \nSome quick notes found from a random site while searching:\n(For Audio)\n\nWell first of all with addressing\n  overheads , indexing etc actual\n  storage space is more like 7.95Gb 15Gb\n  and 29Gb respectively .Generally\n  speaking , the number of songs which\n  can be stored on your device depends\n  on the filesize of each song.No two\n  songs are the same size usually , a\n  number of factors can affect this. The\n  two main factors affecting the size of\n  an audio file arequality( Bitrate and\n  bitdepth) and time ( how long the song\n  is). Therefore to predict the  number\n  of songs your 8,32 or 16Gb Ipod Touch\n  can hold , a few assumptions will be\n  made based on the average user's mp3\n  listening practice. Here we will\n  assume each song is Cd quality\n  (44.1KHz sample rate) 128Kbps bitrate\n  and  4 minutes long i.e 3.75Mb per\n  song.   An 8Gb can hold about 2,120\n  mp3's songs A 16Gb drive could store\n  about 4,240 mp3's On a 32Gb drive you\n  could store about 8,480 mp3's\n\n(For Video)\n\nTypically you can get a DVD movie at\n  700mb when you download it. This gives\n  On an 8Gb drive you could store about\n  10 movies On a 16Gb drive you could\n  store about 21 movies On a 32Gb drive\n  you could store about 44movies You can\n  compress the movie down to a much\n  smaller filesize and it will still\n  look good on the small screen ,\n  allowing you to cram many more movies\n  in there. Apple claims the Ipod Touch \n  can hold up to 10 hours , 20 hours or\n  40 hours of video with the right\n  factors.Their claim is based on H.264\n  1.5-Mbps video at 640-by-480 resolution combined with 128-Kbps\n  audio.\n\nAs you can see, its not really an exact science of capacity of time. Same goes for CDR and DVDR's - the times are just estimations due to usual encoding and such. \nI think Apple dropped this type of information from its advertising/tech specs because especially with the newer devices (which may need more space for OS) it would look like the storage capacity went down (as in, used to be x number of songs at y GB's, now x minus some number of songs at the same y GB's). The only one I see it on anymore is the iPod Classic, and if you have one with that large of a drive, you probably aren't counting much anymore either. \nIn your case I would probably keep the larger one (unless you need the money), because its never to bad to have extra space. \nUpdate:\nDo to the updated question (wondering about HD video recording), according to this site, one hour of HD video is about 4.73GB. So with the 8GB you would get maybe less than an hour and a half, and with the 32GB about 4 hours. \nAnother site has even more information on calculations.\n", "Q: simple MP3 player with folders I've been using SoundJam MP since it came out and many years ago I found a beta version that worked on OS X and that's the reason I can still use it.\nUnfortunately, with OS X Lion, PPC support is gone and I need to find a similar app for my music listening.\nMy main objective is to find a software that allows me to add folders with MP3s and allows me to sort it manually and even sort the files inside the folder, instead of (as iTunes and others do) having the app sort it by album/artist, because I have several MP3s that aren't even tagged and I want to control it and not let the app sort and \"mix\" (wrongly) for me.\nI've searched a lot and tried so many apps already without success (ex: cog, instinctiv, neutrino, songbird, vox).\nAnyone knows of such a software?\nP.S. the app can be either free or paid (reasonably priced).\n\nA: Hm, I'm maybe not fully understand the question, but the VLC player cannot do the job?\nYou can drag into the playlist window any music files (in fact any multimedia files), can rearrange them manually and so on..\nso use the VLC as a music player and not as a video-player.\n", "Q: Does it make sense to Quit apps before Sleep? Will quitting (Cmd+Q) large apps before closing the MacBook lid make getting up and running again faster? \nI have the impression that my MacBook needs more time to recover from sleep if I have large, memory-hungry (LibreOffice, heh) applications open, but that doesn't make much sense from what I believe sleep mode is (e.g., powering down disk and screen but not memory).\n\nA: Yes and no.\nWithout knowing the model of MacBook and level of Mac OS X - you may have safe sleep enabled by default. Safe sleep writes the entire contents of RAM to the hard drive, so anything that is still hitting the hard drive for IO might slow things down until the OS has suspended all the active applications in preparation for this write. It is theoretically possible this suspending process could take more time - but in practice I have never seen reports that it is measurable.\nRecovering from sleep is the same since that means that power was not removed and the RAM contents were maintained. I would guess that the number of apps running does affect greatly how long it takes for the mac to become responsive again. Every app will start processing events (keyboard, mouse, periodic checks to save) so there will be a burst of activity to \"catch\" up to the current time. Newer OS also use launchd to kick off processes that should have been started while the machine was asleep. For example, the daily clean up script runs daily at 3:15 AM - so if the mac was asleep at that time, waking it up at 10am means the 3:15 script gets started as part of the waking from sleep which might slow things down. Add in several other processes on a full mac - and you get the slowness you are observing.\nThe no would be if you don't have it asleep over a time when events are started by launchd and if your apps are efficient or don't need to \"catch up\" - it really depends on your mac and the specific programs running.\nIn the end - if you want a more responsive mac when waking it and quitting apps makes that happen - do it! Don't worry of other people have different experiences. The apps you quit are most likely still in virtual memory (which is saved during sleep) so launching them again will be faster than an initial launch which is the entire reason why sleep exists. (unless you have less than 1/4 total RAM listed as inactive RAM in Activity Monitor).\n\nA: IMO That defeats a bit the purpose of the sleep.\nWhen going to sleep, the mac saves the RAM content to the HD and depending on the HD speed and also the RAM speed it may be slower in your mac.\nObviously if the RAM content isn't very full it will probably take less time to sleep and wake up but as I said, for me sleeping doesn't make sence if you have to quit the apps beforehand.\nOther thinks can be slowing down your mac, maybe you could do some maintenance (ex: repair permissions).\n\nA: If you don't intend to restart the app when you wake your Mac then yes, your overall time could be shortened.\nIf you're just going to launch the app again on wake with the same documents and such then no, you're not saving time overall and are likely losing a bit of time.\n\nA: I think the long and short of this is that it is going to be about the same amount of time to either sleep with the applications running and restarting or sleeping with no applications running and then having to restart each application (I would actually bet that this is more time consuming). Both approaches will take about the same amount of time in non-scientific testing and closing all the applications does sort of defeat the purpose of sleep. Either way this is probably well under a minute...\nIf it is taking more time than that, then I too would recommend running maintenance on the macbook.\n", "Q: Record ipod gameplay I want to record Plants VS Zombies and upload the gameplay video on YouTube.

It's the type of webcam one often sees at Customs checkpoints at airports around the world. It also looks a bit like HAL.\n\nThe problem is that it's only fully supported under Windows. I'm after a third-party solution because:\n\nYour Logitech camera must be UVC\n  (Universal Video Class) compliant in\n  order to be used on your Mac OS 10.4.9\n  and above computer. These standard UVC\n  drivers are provided by the Operating\n  System and will only provide minimal\n  camera support.\n[...]\nNOTE: With the exception of the\n  QuickCam Vision Pro for Mac and the HD\n  Pro Webcam C910, all other UVC cameras\n  are not officially supported on the\n  Mac and some features or application\n  support may not work.\n\nI wonder if someone can point towards a third-party driver that'll make this thing run like it does on Windows?\n\nA: First thing I'd try would be Macam. Your camera is listed as 'it depends (UVC)' on the supported list, which suggests it's getting most of its functionality from the built-in UVC driver anyway. But it's free, so you've nothing to lose by trying it...\nEDIT: Scratch that. The details page for your camera says it doesn't yet work with Macam at all, only with the built-in UVC driver.\n\nA: Somebody finally made a little app that supports the pan and tilt movement for the Logitech quickcam orbit sphere AF for OS X\nZoom is not (yet) supported\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/orbit-command/id666312129?l=en&mt=12\nCosts you €10\n", "Q: best free software to make/open rar files Which is the best software to open/make rar files in Mac OS?\nI am new to Mac and I want to open rar files.\n\nA: The Unarchiver will open them and almost any other compression format.\n\nA: The Unarchiver is probably the most highly regarded piece of OS X software out there for expanding archives.\nSimplyRar is free and can help you create RAR files, but the developer doesn't seem to be active any more. Not sure how well it works in the latest OS X release.\nRarMachine from CandyWare is $8 and can do RAR archive creation. That's pretty close to free.\nEntropy looks pretty snazzy. But $18.\nRAR is a proprietary, closed source format. You usually have to license it to build a tool that creates RAR files. They make the unarchiving available for free because it helps them sell licenses for archiving. Hence RAR-creation utilities rarely being free, but unarchivers being available for free.\n\nA: If you are comfortable using terminal app, then you can uncompress a rar file without installing any software on your mac book. Open the terminal application on mac and go to the location where your rar file is and type the following command (replace the compressedfilename with actual file):\ntar xvf compressedfilename.rar\n\nThe above command will uncompress all files from the compressed rar file in current directory. You can type ls command to view the list of files, or use Finder to view all extracted files.\nx - extract the the compress file,\nv - verbose,\nf - name of archive file\n\nA: I just found this application: http://archiverapp.com. Looks promising!\n\nA: Default Terminal is also the best tool to open rar & zip. If you are comfortable with the terminal then try it without download any third party software in Mac.\nFor zip files\nIn the terminal (at .zip location):\nunzip <filename>\n\n\nFor rar files\nTry using Homebrew...\nIn a terminal type:\nbrew install rar\n\nNow to use it just navigate to your file directory and type:\n\n*\n\n*To view the rar file:\n\nunrar l <filename>\n\n\n*\n\n*To extract the rar file in the same location:\n\nunrar x <filename>\n\n\n*\n\n*To extract the rar file in the desired location:\n\nunrar x <filename>\n\nIn case you face any permission issue: Developer cannot be verified.\n'rar' cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.\nFollow this process:\nOpen System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> General -> Click the lock to make changes.\n", "Q: How do I boot from my Mac partition?

So, my MacBook Pro froze three times today, two of which about two minutes after startup. I could hear fans making noise. When I say 'freeze' I mean that both input an UI don't work.\nI tried Apple Hardware Test (not the extended test, the quick one).

Should I still send it to Apple? And if so, now that I'm unable to reproduce the problem, what should I tell them?\n\nA: some basic things - but you probably already done them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Console.app (check log-files)\n\n*ActivityMonitor - check activity for HDD, memory, swap etc...\n\n\nhere are other helpers (command line) - but 1st you should check the above two...\nStart with \"all messages\" or \"system.log\" and try search for repeated messages what can suggest something. But you will see much cryptic (but otherwise harmless messages) - it is hard to advise. Simply read thru - maybe you got some idea.\nHere is an nice dashboard widget - iStat Pro - what show your fan speed, HDD activity etc.. Maybe can give an idea what is doing inside...\n\nA: Since so many, many, many things could be causing this - you might want to try to first narrow down whether it's hardware, system software or user software.\nMy first step would be to Safe Boot. This runs disk verification and repair and disables much of the non-essential plug-ins, third party apps and helps eliminate them as a cause. If it's still sluggish - you might look into hardware tests or isolation there.\nIf that resolves it, you might proceed systematically down the checklist for a continuous grey screen at boot or make a new user to test if it's something specific to your account.\nGood luck - please edit or comment if you can rule out some of the causes or need more detailed advice.\nBased on the edit showing crash reports being submitted before sleep - I would add two steps to my general suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*turn off/disconnect all networks to\nensure it's not a pause/network\nissue.\n\n*See what programs are crashing in /Library/CrashReports and also in ~/Library/CrashReports - the system will pause to collect the crash, and if it's a system level process - the respawning / continuous crashing might be the root cause.

Originally I was going to ask a question about how to get LaTeX working in Anki, but as I was writing the question, I was trying to solve the problem myself. I thought others may benefit from my findings, so I decided to post them here. If you notice that any of my steps are wrong, please let me know. And I was still unable to get it to work, so if you scroll down to the end, you can see where I'm stuck and still need help.\nThe current issue is: How can I install libgd?\n\nI'm trying to make Anki work with LaTeX. The only information I could find about how to do this is from this page:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*[...] to use LaTeX, you have to install it separately - it is not  bundled with Anki\n  \n*[...] on OSX use MacTex\n  \n*Dvipng must also be installed.\n  \n*On OSX, if you use MacPorts or similar to install LaTeX, make sure latex and dvipng are linked in /usr/bin.\n  \n\nThe standard installation of MacTex takes up 3GB, far more than I believe is necessary, since I am not going to use its GUI application. I just need the LaTeX library, if I understand it correctly, which should be way less than 3GB. Therefore, I'm installing the BasicTeX version instead, which only takes up about 100MB.\nI'm not sure if I already have Dvipng installed or not, so I'm restarting Anki to see if it works or not. I got the following error:\n\nError executing dvipng. [...] Output written on tmp.dvi [...]\n\nSo I probably need to install dvipng... The Install readme has the following information:\n\nInstalling dvipng should be simple: merely ./configure',make', and\n  `make install'.\nPrerequisites:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The GD Graphics Draw library, libgd\n  \n*The path-searching library kpathsea\n  \n*libpng and libz\n  \n\nAgain, I'm not sure which, if any, of these prerequisites I already have installed, so I'm just going ahead with the installation in hopes of error messages guiding me to the right path.\nAfter executing ./config, it gives the error:\n\nconfigure: error: cannot find/use libpng\n\n... which I think is weird since the readme states:\n\n To be able to compress and write PNG files to disk, dvipng (or\n really libgd) uses libpng which in turn uses libz. These should be\n available on any modern system, if not, download them and install\n them.\n\n\nI went to the libpng website, and tried finding a \"current binary\" that works with my OS (10.6/i386), but it seems that none of the latest 3 versions have a binary that is available to download. So I went to the \"old binaries\" section, which took me to this website, which has libpng v1.4.5. I installed the \"Individual Installer package\" for libpng.\nNow that it's installed, I tried installing Dvipng again, and it now gives the following error:\n\ncannot find/use libgd\n  This drawing library can be downloaded at http://www.boutell.com/gd\n\nWhen I go to that website, I see it says that the page moved and that it is currently down. There is only a link to the source files and no binary distribution. I'm not sure where I should go from here... should I download the source and compile it somehow? Once it's complied what do I do with it? Do I run some file it generates? Would I move files it generates to specific folders? How would Dvipng know how to access it? I'm unfamiliar with how to do something like this, so any help would be appreciated. \n\nHere's a summary (so far) of the dependency hierarchy which must be installed in order to get LaTeX to work with Anki:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacTeX: Installed (got the BasicTeX version to save a lot of disk space).\n\n*Dvipng: Not installed (can't install without libgd).\n\n*\n\n*libpng: Installed (got the Individual Installer package).\n\n*libgd: Not installed (not sure how to install this).\n\n*???\n\n\n\n\nOther questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a better, reliable method to know if any of these dependencies are installed rather than running an installer which depends on them and hoping for a meaningful error message?\n\n\nA: I was having this exact problem but the command \"tlmgr update --self && tlmgr install dvipng\" did not work and I got the error I need to run the program as an admin.\nThe user account I was using was an admin account.\nWhat I did instead is run each command separately as sudo:\nAt the Mac OS X Terminal prompt:\n$ sudo tlmgr update --self\n\n(wait for this command to grab updates and compete)\n$ sudo tlmgr install dvipng\n\nThis worked and installed tlmgr updates as well as dvipng, causing Anki to display LaTeX output!\n\nA: If you have Homebrew installed, the easiest way is:\nbrew install basictex && sudo tlmgr update --self && sudo tlmgr install dvipng\n\n\nA: Your question was very helpful to me in getting LaTeX working with Anki, but I've found there's an easier way to get dvipng:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MacTeX.  I installed BasicTeX-2011.pkg (MacTeX-Additions-2011.mpkg is NOT required).\n\n*Open the terminal, type \"tlmgr update --self && tlmgr install dvipng\" and press enter. It will update TeX Live Manager and install the latest dvipng.\n\n\nOnce you do that, you should be all set.\n", "Q: Install Snow Leopard without Leopard I have a MacBook, which was running Leopard.\nIt got corrupted, and even I want to upgrade to Snow Leopard.\nSo I purchased Snow Leopard Retail Box.\nNow, I want to install Snow Leopard, but I cannot start Leopard.\nHow can I perform clean install of Snow Leopard, without needing Leopard.\nVideos Links are welcomed too.\n\nA: Insert the Snow Leopard DVD into your DVD drive.

That made it even worse, so I bought a special very thin mousepad.  Maybe it's a little better, but still sucks compared to other mice when physically moving it around.\nToday I went to the Apple Store to see if there's maybe a special mousepad I need. The employee showed me their sample magic mice and said that's just how they are.\nIs this true?  I love the Magic Mouse in every other way, if it was only physically more smooth, it would be absolutely amazing.  Is there a mousepad that works particularly well with it?\n\nA: I have a five year old magic mouse that's still going great.\nI had the same problem with the mouse feet wearing down  to the point where the battery cover was making contact with the desk. It became gritty and not very pleasant to use. I then coated the feet with teflon tape and also covered the worn spot on the battery cover. The tape is extremely thin and won't affect tracking. It feels like the mouse is new. The tape is durable - I haven't had to change it yet and the roll contains enough tape to do a LOT of mice.\nThe tape I used is ½ inch wide. I applied it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove battery cover and measure the length of the feet. Cut a strip of tape the same length.\n\n*Start from inside the battery cover by aligning the tape to the vertical part of the feet (at this point the tape should be perpendicular to the bottom of the mouse case. Use your fingernail or something like a toothpick to seat the tape to the fee.\n\n*Gently roll the tape around the feet and under the 'v' between the feet and the mouse case. Again, your fingernail works great for this.\n\n*Use a single edge razor blade or exacto knife the trim the excess tape.\n\n\nEnjoy your 'new' mouse.\n\nA: Personally, I don't have a problem with the amount of friction when using the Magic Mouse.\nA quick google revealed there are products, eg. \"Fliders\" that add \"slippers\" to the bottom of mice, and they have a Magic Mouse specific product. I don't have any direct experience with them or connection to the product in any way, but for $10 it might be worth a shot.\n\nA: I evenly spread some Talcum Powder on the Mouse pad and now the Magic Mouse is floating like a Air Hockey Mallet.\n\nA: The skates can get somehow coarse, which in turn adds friction. I simply added some Teflon tape to mine and it's been smooth ever since.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nI wound up taking a box-cutter and physically shaving down the two long mouse feet in the middle, so they only contacted on the ends.\nIt certainly helped, but as near as I can tell, the problem really boils down to the plastic used to make the feet. \nOne other thing that did help was a hard plastic mouse pad.\n\nA: I solved the problem by applying a little bit of vaseline on the two long magic mouse feets and then rubbing them gently with the back of a knife. After that, I used a kitchen steel wool to rub both feets again.\nThe mouse now slides over any surface like a SpaceX falcon rocket Lol\n\nA: There's not much you can do to make the mouse lighter. The only factor is less weight batteries which typically have less energy or more waste.\nFor reference AA battery weights in grams:\n\n\n*\n\n*24 - Duracell ProCell Alkaline\n\n*26 - Eneloop NiMH rechargeable (1500 to 1900 mAh)\n\n*28 - Energizer NiMH rechargeable (2500 mAh)\n\n*≈18 - Eneloop Lite NiMH rechargeable (950mAh)\n\n\nOnce you've slimmed down the weight, consider altering the friction.\nHave you considered waxing or lubricating the table a bit? If not - then you could get some high quality silicone grease (home depot plumbing or scuba stores) to make the plastic runners a little more slick. It is safe and thick enough that it will stick rather than come off immediately.\n\nA: I'm a hobbyist who uses a self-healing cutting surface to razor-cut paper.  I discovered by accident that this \"board\" is an excellent surface for the magic mouse.  It's available at Michael's or other craft stores.  It measures about 13\" X 19\"; this being a good size for paper-cutting, I left it as is, but you could cut it up to make several mousepads if you chose to.  Actually first find out how to cut it up, since it's self-healing!\n\nA: The Magic Mouse has the slight drag by design.  It needs this to prevent the mouse from sliding all over the place when you use the surface of the mouse with finger gestures.  If it was smooth gliding there is no way the mouse could be effectively used as a touch mouse.\n\nA: I simply took cellulose tape strips and stick them on the rubber feet under the mouse. It works great! Its as smooth as it can be and simple to do.\n\nA: After reading the advice here and looking at the various tapes I just stuck Scotch Magic Tape to the skids on my Mac mouse, and it has reduced the grating sound. That'll do the job for me at the moment.\n", "Q: Strategy for storage on Mac Pro with SSD I've switched my 2008 MacBook Pro to SSD, and love the speed increase.\nI'm now keen to do the same on my 2007 Mac Pro desktop. I've currently got 1Tb + 2*500Gb disks installed.  My strategy is to go for a startup disk of about 128Gb, with the 'bare minimum' stored on it, then leave the rest of my data on the traditional hard disks.\nSo, if I'm mostly doing Java (Eclipse) development, plus a couple of VMWare Fusion Windows installations (used for testing), what is it most worth putting on the SSD?  And what shall I just leave on the magnetic disks.\nMy gut feeling is that it's worth putting my Java IDE plus sources on SSD, since in compilation there's lots of disk access.  The Fusion VMs can probably sit on Magnetic disks, I don't mind a penalty starting them up: it's just once per week or so.\nSugestions welcome...\n\nA: I have been building out Mac Pros for a while with SSD for the boot, user accounts and all the apps that fit.\nPlacing the large user data that doesn't fit as well as large Apps on the magnetic storage has worked well as the system and user caches stay on the SSD. You absolutely want your code and build scratch / temp files / object files on SSD for speed reasons.\nThe simpler the better - I have been using software RAID to span the HDD so the users all see three volumes whether or not they have one drive partitioned, a mix of SSD/HDD or full SSD/HDD and external drives for data and/or TimeMachine.\nMacintosh HD - SSD unless lower performance is OK.\nData - all the HDD striped (optional on non SSD macs)\nTime Machine - internal if possible - external\nOn the fastest macs - we are thinking of striping 3 SSD as DATA - moving the Time Machine to external storage as buying large (teraByte) SSD is still a costly proposition.\n\nA: One recommendation is to actually monitor disk usage. Similar to the adage in software development that says instead of trying to guess how to improve performance, run a profiler that will tell you what parts of the software get used the most and could be improved.\nWhile you could use the Activity Monitor that has some per-process information, better information can be found via the command line with sudo fs_usage -f filesys.\nSince you are fairly sure the system will reside on the SSD, I wouldn't try to monitor the bootup phase. Start the above command as early as possible and then try to do a normal workflow. Output includes a path name for each file accessed. Analyze results to see what files are actually being accessed the most and go from there.\n", "Q: Video editing application for Mac I'm interested in starting to edit videos and I'm looking for a good video editing application. It shouldn't be too complicated but one should be able to do advanced stuff with it too. I currently got iMovie but it's too simple for me. \nAny tips?\n\nA: I can recommend Final Cut Express and if you want it real pro - Final Cut Pro. Note that a major new Final Cut version is nearly out - probably with the MacOS X Lion. Also note that some price drop is expected for both products, probably you should wait a month.\n\nA: IMHO with imovie you can achieve NICE results, especially, when you starting to edit. \niMovie has several very nice features (some are not obvious at the first look), and probably you still do not discover them all.\nUsing professional applications like FinalCut and so on, i'm not recommending for someone who starting to edit. But, opinions are like slaps - they're always different. :)\nMaybe, can you be more exact - what feature you missing from iMovie?\n(0,02$) :)\n\nA: As iMovie (surprisingly capable and free) and Final Cut Pro X (extremely capable and not at all free) have already been mentioned, I'll just point out the two other common answers:\nAdobe Premiere\n\n\n*\n\n*Expensive and you have to pay every month\n\n*Extremely powerful, surely falls into the \"complicated\" category like any powerful video editor. \n\n\nDavinci Resolve\n\n\n*\n\n*Available for free! There's a paid version but almost all users will be fine with the free one. They make money by selling hardware that works with the software, which is why they can give it away for free. \n\n*Extremely powerful and complicated to use all the features (you can do EVERYTHING with it including 3D animation). The basic editing features are not that hard to learn though. \n\n*Has serious performance problems on older computers. Even with all the elaborate optimization tools in place, I still can't use it on my 2013 MBP to edit a video with a title on top. \n\n*Did I mention it's free? If you have a new/powerful computer it's definitely worth at least trying Davinci Resolve out. \n\n", "Q: White iphone Home button defect? Recently 1 week back I bought a new white iphone... I have found 1 problem in iphone... Actually the problem is: white iphone home button is little bit deep.. i can feel edges/corner while pressing home button. I think it shouldn't be like that. \nAnyone have faced similar problem ? ... Is this problem with every white iphone devices ? ... or only my device is defective ?\nThanks\n\nA: I can feel the edges of the button on both my black iPhone 4 even when the button isn't depressed - so your description alone doesn't necessarily mean there is a defect (but you should be very happy with your new purchase and it could very well be a defect). \nIf you can go to any retail (cell carrier or Apple) store and compare your device to others (or have friends with any iPhone 4 to compare) it will be very easy for anyone to agree if your phone's button is different than the rest. No matter where you bought the phone - Apple will exchange it if the hardware is defective at no cost.\nYou also can return a new phone to the seller within 30 days - but getting it in the hands of an Apple tech will be the fastest way to know it's covered or a defect - or if it's just a normal variation of the manufacturing process.\n", "Q: Magic Mouse is frequently losing its connection to MacBook Pro My Magic Mouse is intermittently losing its connection to my MacBook Pro. \nFirst the mouse becomes unresponsive and a few seconds later, a picture of the mouse appears on the screen wit the words \"Connection Lost.\" Then about 10 seconds later, the connections is \"magically\" re-established, without any action on my part. \nAny ideas on what this could be due to and how I can stop this? I have changed the batteries and they are brand new. My software is also up-to-date unless there is a special bluetooth update that I have to go get somewhere.\n\nA: Batteries are loose\nApple designed the Magic Mouse battery compartment according to the official specification for AA batteries. Unfortunately, while Apple engineers were quite precise, the manufacturers of batteries are not. In practice, batteries vary in size, just enough to be problematic in the Magic Mouse.\nGiven that the batteries are hanging inside the mouse with only the tension of the terminal receptacles to keep them in place, incorrectly sized batteries can easily be pulled by gravity, falling down ever so slightly, just enough to lose contact with the electrical pads. \nWiggling the mouse is enough to re-establish contact between battery and the pads. For a while, until they fall again. Thus the annoying disconnect-reconnect-disconnect-reconnect loop.\nPiece of thin cardboard\nThe solution is to use scissors to cut a piece of thin paper cardboard the size of the batteries. Lay this piece over the batteries before engaging the metal cover on the bottom of the mouse. The cardboard should touch only the batteries, but not the surrounding compartment of the mouse. Your goal is to get the metal door to push the paper up against the sides of the batteries, just snug enough to prevent the batteries from falling downward.\nI have found the perfect thickness of cardboard to be the box enclosing a 12-pack of soda cans. A business card might do. You need about a millimeter. Thicker than sheets of paper. Card stock might do it, but may not be thick enough.\n\nA: The battery connection is very sensitive on the magic mouse, which makes the  batteries move around slightly when you use the mouse which is enough for it to loose power. Try tapping on it and you'll see. \nWhen this happens, you need to shake the mouse or open the hatch. This usually works.\nThey should have used the traditional spring to keep the batteries in place.\n\nA: I found that just removing the batteries and cleaning the terminals with a paper towel on both the batteries and the mouse fixed the problem.  I think the people who used paper spacers on the sides of the batteries and aluminum spacers on the negative end of the batteries actually just cleaned the terminals by removing and installing the batteries and the spacers didn't do anything.  May be some coincidence but no loss to try.   \n\nA: How old is the Macbook Pro? Is it still under warranty? Have you replaced the hard drive recently? I presume you've gone through the troubleshooting procedures on Apple's support page.\nThe first thing I would do is shut everything down, ensure the mouse is turned on first, then restart.\nI've done a bit of a search on Apple's forums and I found this. It outlines how someone had a similar problem and did a bit of surgery on the Macbook to fix a loose connection.  Not sure if it would be of help.\nOf course, the easiest solution, if not the most elegant, would be to purchase a USB bluetooth adapter for $20 or so and see if that solves the issue. If not, it must be an interference or mouse hardware problem.\n\nA: \nSimply fold the post-it and put it between the batteries to solve the problem.\n\nA: Are the batteries in the mouse old and about to die? That is what happens to my Dad's mighty mouse when the batteries are about to die and need a recharge.\n\nA: It's not that the battery compartment of the Magic Mouse is too big, it's that the positive connection plate is recessed too deeply behind the plastic end cap... and on some brands of batteries (notably Amazon) the tip on the positive end is too short to reach. Putting a small wad of foil in the hole where that tip fits will fix this. If you have the expertise, soldering a small bit of copper on the positive battery tip is an even better fix.\nI don't know if you'd call this an Apple error or a battery manufacturer error, but there does seem to be a mismatch.\n\nA: I had the same problem and tried all the usual apple troubleshooting procedures. Nothing worked for me. Finally, I came across these posts by Michael Kummer and Brad Moon.\nTurning off Apple’s Handoff feature worked for me!\nFrom Brad Moon post:\n\nSimply open up your System Preferences, select General, look for a setting called Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices and make sure it’s un-checked.\n\n\nYou lose the ability to start writing an e-mail on your iPhone then “hand it off” to automatically continue working on it in Mail on your Mac, but it might be worth sacrificing the feature to finally nail a maddening Bluetooth mouse problem.\n\n(I reported this also to a similar question: Lost bluetooth connection with mouse.)\n", "Q: Can I disable Wi-fi on a Time Capsule? Is it possible to disable Wi-fi on a Time Capsule device and use it only wired ?\n\nA: With Airport Utility, select the time capsule; Airport tab; Wireless tab.  In the Wireless Mode dropdown, choose 'Off'.\n\n", "Q: How do I change the default boot option on rEFIt? I have two copies of OS X (10.6 and 10.7). By default rEFIt boots 10.6. However, I want to make it boot 10.7 instead.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: You will need to edit the rEFIt configuration file. Since version 0.14, the configuration file has supported adding a default boot selection, as documented in the news section of the website.\nHowever, there isn't very clear documentation on how exactly to do this on rEFIt's website. You could just open the conf file, or view the default on their SVN repo here. This blog does have an example and some documentation that I've used before in a similar situation. You'll want to use the digit option instead of the OS type option (1-N, vs L,W,M).\n", "Q: How to see what files were changed in TimeMachine? I tried TimeTracker, tms and timedog but none of them works with OS X 10.6\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Since Time Machine uses hardlinks to store unmodified files (and directories), this would mean that changed files in the latest backup will have a link count of 1 since they are unique. Use this together with find to generate a listing: \nfind /path/to/your/latest/backup -type f -links 1 -print \n\n\nA: You can use the built in tmutil and GNU gsort:\nbrew install coreutils\n\nTo compare between two specific backups:\ncd \"/Volumes/TimeMachine/Backups.backupdb/My Mac\"\nsudo tmutil compare Date1 Date2 | gsort -h -k2\n\nFor just the difference between the current backup and the previous backup:\nsudo tmutil listbackups | tail -n 2 | awk '{ print \"\\\"\"$0\"\\\"\"}' | xargs tmutil compare | gsort -h -k2\n\n\nA: Lion has come out with the tmutil command and the man page shows that it will crawl a specific backup and report very detailed information on your specific backups. The verbs compare, uniquesize, and calculatedrift look most useful if you don't mind the terminal.\nI still use BackupLoupe on Lion (as well as on older OS) and have high praise and thanks to the team that built it every time I need to use it. I should probably send them more money, too. It's that good.\n\nIt makes it very easy to see what files are taking the most space between backups and also is indispensable for knowing when a specific file has been changed by tracking each time it is saved as a new version going back in time. It works on a local database so you are not crawling the filesystem each and every query - just once each time to collect the deltas for each backup.\n\n\nA: The problem with that find command seems to be that HFS allows hard links on directories as well as regular files.  As a result, files that have not been backed up for a while will show up with one link but one of their parent directories may have many links.\n", "Q: Change carrier text without jailbreak I was wondering if there was any relatively easy way to change the carrier text on my iPod touch 3g (running ios 4.3.3). I've tried editing the com.apple.springboard.plist and adding the SBFakeCarrier key, but it appears that has been removed as of ios 4.2.1. Is there any similar solution?\n\nA: Here's a relatively simple method that does involve jailbreak but ends up with a non-jailbroken iPod and a fake carrier setting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak your iPhone (stay with me)\n\n*Download Cydia App: 'MakeItMine' by Erika Sadun\n\n*Change the carrier name\n\n*Connect your iPod and create a backup on iTunes\n\n*Restore your iPod to factory settings\n\n*Restore your backup\n\n\nYour iPod touch should now display your fake carrier and be non-jailbroken.\n", "Q: Using the Apple Battery Charger with non-Apple batteries The Apple Battery Charger's product description page states:\n\nThe Apple Battery Charger can recharge one or two batteries at a time. It's optimized for Apple-supplied batteries and it works with AA NiMH batteries from other companies, too.\n\nDoes anyone know the required specifications for using non-Apple batteries? \nThe Apple supplied batteries are AA Ni-MH Min. 1900 mAh 1.2V HR6.\nI have some Powerex AA Ni-MH Min. 2500 mAh 1.2V, so I'm wondering if they are compatible. I'm also curious what other non-Apple batteries are compatible.\n\nA: Apple Batteries are Rebranded Sanyo Batteries\nAccording to engadget, the Apple supplied batteries are actually Sanyo Eneloop HR-3UTG, so it appears that's one option for buying additional batteries to use with the Apple Battery Charger.\nPowerex Batteries Don't Work\nAccording to the Apple Battery Charger Manual,\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Flashing Amber: May indicate any of the following conditions:\n  \n*\n  \n*The batteries haven’t been properly installed in the charger.\n  \n*An unsupported type of battery is in the charger.\n  \n*The batteries may be faulty or damaged and should be replaced.\n  \n  \n\nWith that information, I tried charging the Powerex 2500 and 2700 batteries but received a flashing amber light.\nLooks like I need to buy some of the Sanyo Eneloop HR-3UTG batteries.\n\nA: I too had original apple batteries and the orange light was flashing.

But certification rules will not allow us to use WiFi for this.\nWe are open to becoming enterprise developers because the software will be on a couple of thousand iPads. \nIs this possible?\n\nA: Using the iPad camera connector with the USB port seems to work with certain items (headsets, etc.) that aren't cameras, leading me to believe that there is a full USB hardware implementation in there but there simply aren't any drivers. If this is true, you could get a USB Ethernet dongle, write iPad drivers for it in your camera-viewing app, and use Ethernet to connect to your cameras. I doubt that would get on the App Store, but that's not a problem, given that you will be using the Enterprise distribution method. This might also preclude charging the iPad while it is connected, so you may have to design and manufacture your own power-and-ethernet dongle.\n\nA: There are ethernet connectible cameras out there (DLink makes some, D-Link DCS-1000 for example), that will give you an ip address (and or port) to it's internal webserver that you will be able to hit (I do the same for my home security camera).\nhttp://www.nextag.com/ethernet-camera/shop-html for an example list.\n\nA: Are we talking about live video here? Then I'm pretty confident that you are out of luck (assuming that blutooth isn't an option either).\n\n\n*\n\n*Factor one is the issue already mentioned: No hardware or drivers to connect to.\n\n*Factor two is the lack of Apple frameworks supporting such a setup, so development becomes quite expensive\n\n*Factor three - and IMO the final nail in the coffin - is the limited input bandwidth of the iPad connector.. It is good for some audio, but it's simply not enough for video input.\n\n\nA: If you don't want to use Wi-Fi or 3G, then you have to use the camera connection kit. You can insert an SD-card or just use the USB port\n", "Q: How to enable ssh login for _www user? In order to deploy files the the apache server running on OS X host I want to ssh/scp to it using the _www user.\nI do not want to use root because I want to be sure that I always put the files with correct permissions.\nThe problem is that I am not able to login with _www. I did change the password for the account but ssh login still fails after asking me the password two times.\n\nA: The _www user is designed to never have a shell and many of the user attributes needed for ssh to run are missing. Once you log in as any other admin user, you can easily sudo over to user _www to get file permissions correct.\nmac:~ me$ dscl . -read /Users/_www\nAppleMetaNodeLocation: /Local/Default\nGeneratedUID: FFFFEEEE-DDDD-CCCC-BBBB-AAAA00000046\nNFSHomeDirectory: /Library/WebServer\nPassword: *\nPrimaryGroupID: 70\nRealName:\n World Wide Web Server\nRecordName: _www www\nRecordType: dsRecTypeStandard:Users\nUniqueID: 70\nUserShell: /usr/bin/false\n\nmac:~ me$ sudo -u _www -s\nPassword:\nbash-3.2$ id\nuid=70(_www) gid=70(_www) groups=70(_www),61(localaccounts),12(everyone)\n\nYou can compare with a real user to see the missing attributes. If you want to hack, you could try making the NFSHomeDirectory writable and editing the shell - but that would leave all sorts of user files in /Library/Webserver - and your custom mods might get wiped out each update or cause unintended effects down the road.\nAny reasons why you don't just create a apache admin user with a UID less than 500 so that it won't show in the log in screen as a normal user?\n(or simply use a normal user to ssh in before using sudo to become _www)?\nIt's a lot less work and more secure. _www is intentionally placed in a sandboxbox to reduce the chance that web browsing does bad things to a running mac.\n\nA: As mentioned, you couldn't ssh directly as _www because the password may not be set, and the shell may be set to /usr/bin/false. \nAlternatively, you can ssh in as a regular user, and if your user has admin privileges you could do this:\n(me@local)$ ssh me@myserver\n(me@myserver)$ sudo -u _www -s\nPassword: (type it in)\n(_www@myserver)$ whoami\n_www\n\nI've just done this on both Mac OS X Snow Leopard and Lion. It's great for checking that permissions are setup correctly.\n", "Q: Upgrading the from OS X 10.6 to OS X Server 10.6 in-place to remove the 10-user FTP limit in client? Is there an easy way to upgrade from OS X 10.6 to OS X 10.6 Server, or a workaround to eliminate the 10-user limit for ftp connections?\n\nA: No - server needs additional packages to be run at install time and there is no general upgrade path or migration assistant to move a client mac to server.\nEven at $499 Snow Leopard Server provides a lot of bang for the buck - but if you can compile open source and don't need this NOW a free solution might make more sense.\nI've never had to bypass the limit - but my first step would be turning off the mac delivered ftpd and compiling Pure-FTPd (you need to use PAM when you compile for Max OS X)\nOnce you confirm the new binary works as planned for more than 10 users, you can dig into launchd and set it up to call your ftpd instead of the built in one.\n\nA: I find the smoothest, easiest to rollback method is to use disk utility to partition to the hard drive and add a volume you want to put a fresh OS on.  Then do a fresh install and move over the needed data.  Working DNS and Open Directory is recommended, there are docs from Apple and books available on the topic.\nFTP is deprecated in Lion server, and the hacks to re-enable it severely compromised security in my testing.  It's not a secure protocol by default, so I would recommend finding another way to server the resource in question.\n", "Q: How can I turn off the screen on the macbook when I have an external monitor set up? I have an external monitor and want my macbook screen to go blank or black so I can focus on the monitor instead. On my windows machine Function F5 does this.\n\nA: Turn on your MacBook without the external display connected.\nClose the lid and it will go to sleep.\nConnect your external monitor and an external keyboard via USB.\nNow wake it up by typing on the external keyboard. If you don't have a USB keyboard (you might be using a BT keyboard and mouse) you can use the Apple Remote to wake up a MacBook when its lid is closed.\nThe MacBook should wake up with the external monitor as its one and only monitor.\n\nA: Hold down the decrease screen brightness button at the top of the keyboard, it will get dimmer and dimmer, and at the end jump to a black screen (the screen's light will actually be off). To turn the screen back just press the increase screen brightness button.\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be an out-of-box way to do it in Mac OS, but with this third-party plugin https://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor does the trick!

(Can you tell I'm a fan?)\n", "Q: Rotate iPad Video out when connected to a monitor I have a HDMI -> iPad adapter that I'm using to connect my iPad to a monitor to do a demo at a tradeshow. The monitor I'm using is placed vertically, so I need to rotate the video out from the iPad to match it. I couldn't find any way to do this in the settings app. \nDoes anyone know a way? (Cydia apps are fine too)\n\nA: There's currently no way to do this system-wide.  If you make the app you're using for the demo, you should consider making the app do the rotation for you.\nDesign the app so when it's in landscape mode it displays a portrait mode screen (ie, the app always appears rotated on its side).  Then hold the ipad in landscape mode, turn rotation lock on so it stays that way, start your app, then use your app with the correct orientation.  Turn your monitor on its side to see the faked portrait mode.\nYou can also do this for presentations if you turn all your slides on the side.\nHowever there's currently no way to do this for apps not designed for it.\n\nA: When I connect my iPad to an HDMI connector, the video orientation changes as I move the iPad around. So if you need Portrait mode, then hold the iPad in portrait mode.\n\nA: You should use a monitor with rotation capabilities! \nIpad sends vertical image and monitors fit that image so that all parts of the image are show, that causes black sides with a centered image on a normal horizontal screen. \nJust get a monitor that rotates incoming signals. It will be full screen on monitor full portrait on ipad.. voila!\n", "Q: my wife just got an iphone 3GS. we both have apple IDs, but her iTunes on her iPhone shows my username my wife just got an iphone 3GS. we both have apple IDs and use a macbook together, but her iTunes on her iPhone shows my username and the credit amount that I have. When buying a song or an app, my user account info pops up. How can we have her username and log in information appear on her iPhone?\n\nA: Are you using the same user on your MacBook? If so, you're probably using the same iTunes too, which probably is set to your Apple ID. To use a different ID, you need to switch accounts every time you sync the iPhones. To sign out, choose \"Store\" > \"Sign out\" in the iTunes menu bar.\nThankfully, this whole hassle will be over when iOS 5 is released.\n\nA: You could also simply authorize both accounts to run on your computers at home (store--> authorize this computer), and then, on the actual IPhone, go to settings--> store--> log out, then just log back in using her account.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro resale value -- should I replace the battery? Non-technical question here, sort of. I'm planning on selling my old MacBook Pro on Craigslist. It's in great physical condition, with the exception of the battery, which is nonfunctional. It's never been replaced, but after use and age it can no longer hold a charge.\nShould I replace the battery before listing the laptop? That is to say, would the cost of cutting the price to list it \"without battery\" be greater than the cost to buy a new one? (Not to mention then I have to decide between a $20 hit-or-miss generic replacement or a $120 legit Apple battery.)\n\nA: I think if the rest of the laptop is still in good condition, then replace it.\nFor one thing, it leaves a bit of a bad impression with a potential buyer. You're giving them a machine which works only with the plug and if they wants to use it on battery they'll have to go out and work it out with Apple himself. Personally I'd expect a pretty hefty price reduction for that.\nIf you replace it on the other hand, you can clearly state so in the description (eg \"battery was recently replaced for $120 and should now allow you to work for a full X hours while not plugged in\" or whatever) which actually increases the price and the value of the laptop.\n\nA: I would not replace the battery, but simply make clear that it doesn't hold a charge.\n\nA: Replace it. As someone who buys on Craigslist, I would pay more for a 100% product than a %75 product, and be quicker to buy.\n", "Q: How to draw a curve line on Pixelmator This is probably one of the most important / useful feature in any image editing software - any knows how to draw curved line in Pixelmator?\n\nA: The best you can do in Pixelmator 1 is arcs using the oval selection tool. Select an area with the selection tool set to the circle/oval setting and then trace the selection (Edit -> Stroke) on a new layer. Once traced, erase the part of the trace you don't need. Reposition, stretch and mangle with the layer tools.\nPixelmator 2 adds vector drawing capabilities. It'll be available this summer and it will be a free upgrade for anyone who purchased Pixelmator 1 via the App Store.\nUpdate: Pixelmator 2 was released via the App Store today and the pen tool lets you draw and manipulate curves now. Works great.\n\nA: Pixelmator (1.x) is a raster-based image processing software and doesn't support curved line and other vector functions.\nEdit: It seems that the next version will have some vector tools: http://www.pixelmator.com/sneak-preview/\n", "Q: Saving online videos (e.g. YouTube) and moving them to iPad for later offline viewing? I am looking for a solution that would allow me to save online videos, especially YouTube, to the iPad for later offline viewing.\n\nA: Safari and Chrome\nI had no luck getting any extensions working. YouTube intercepts right clicks on video and shows a youtube context menu instead of the native context menu and thereby blocking the download button.\nFirefox\nDownload YouTube Videos as MP4 and FLV 1.3.8 is an extensions which is compatible with Firefox 11 (as of march 2012). It shows a download button below the Youtube video area.\n\nThe download format is .mp4 which is fine to use on an iPad.\nStill, if you want to convert the downloaded video for your mobile devices, you can use a simple tool like the MiroVideoConverter, which is available in the Mac App Store for free.\n\n\nA: Check out Zamzar, which allows you to enter the URL of a YouTube movie and translated it to, for example, MP4, which can then be added to your iTunes library and synced to your iPad. Once the translation has finished, you'll get an email with a link to download the new file.\n\nA: Most solutions I found on the net were not working anymore but I found this Safari extension that worked just fine https://github.com/jonathanboom/YouTube-video-downloader-for-Safari\n", "Q: Can I continue to use Win XP in Boot Camp when I upgrade to Lion? I bought my MacBook in mid-2008 with Leopard (10.5.2) pre-installed. On it, I installed (Japanese) Windows XP using BootCamp. I am now up to Snow Leopard (10.6.7) and I can continue to use Windows XP (currently at SP3) with no problems. If I upgrade to Lion, will I still be able to use my existing Windows XP installation? (N.B. If I can't, I shan't upgrade.)\n\nA: The bootcamp partition is not affected. The only thing Apple did different in Lion is that the bootcamp drivers packaged with Lion installations only work with Windows 7, however, if you already have the Snow Leopard drivers installed on you XP side nothing will change...if you need to install a new bootcamp partition you will need to get the bootcamp drivers from your Snow Leopard DVD. \n\nA: This may have been a problem during the Lion install when it resizes the partitions on the drive, it may have screwed up the XP partition when installing the Recovery Partition...this should only be a problem if your drive is almost full...I have a setup similar to yours (SL on one partition, and XP on the other under Bootcamp) I had 450GB free...I didn't have any trouble.\n", "Q: How to move all iPhoto video files to an external disk or a NAS? The main harddrive of my MacBook Pro is filling up. So I need to move some files to an external medium.\nI use iPhoto to import my photos and (HD) videos from my digital camera. I want to keep all my images in iPhoto, but I'd like to move the space consuming videos to another medium.\nIs there simple, possibly automated way to move all the video files (.mov) that are in my iPhoto library to an external folder (NAS or disk)?\n\nA: Try this (not automated, because i don't like automated delete for anything):\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a \"smart album\" in the iPhoto with the condition \"Photo is Movie\". With this you get all movies into your new smart album.\n\n*press info (for check how much MB they're occupied)\n\n*Simply drag&drop movies out of the iPhoto (long time)\n\n*ensure (double check) they are really OK\n\n*move the movies from the smart-album into the Trash\n\n*empty\n\n\n(triple check before deleting - do not blame me, when your computer get destroyed or so)\n\nA: Just came across this, had a similar need.\n Suggest the following changes. \nFollow steps\n1: Make a \"smart album\" in the iPhoto with the condition \"Photo is Movie\".\n2: Select a movie in the smart album created at step 1.\n3: Press ⌘-a (select all)\n4: Choose Export in the File/Menu\n5: In the Export Dialog, choose kind:Original, then Export\n(optionally, you can choose subfolder :Event Name. This will put the movies in folders based on the event name)\nThis will export all your movies. Now you simply need to delete the movies out of iPhoto.\nI have not found a way to do this in an efficient manner since Apple in their wisdom did not allow you to use delete on movie objects in a smart folder (you can for pictures.. odd, bug I find a lot of these inconsistencies in Apple products), instead you must find the actual file in the event folder and delete from there. You can use the smart folder to take you to a given movie in the smart folders source event by bringing up the context selection menu and choose show event.\n\nA: If you've upgraded from iPhoto to the new Photos app:\nFor any video files you've imported, you can find the originals at:\n~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters  \n\nThis way, you don't need to do an export; you can just copy.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, go to Go > Go to Folder \n\n*Enter ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters\n\n*Navigate to whatever video files you want and copy them to your destination. \n\n\nA: I'm facing exactly the same problem, and I have to say that by far the easiest solution is to upgrade to Aperture ($80), and use it to move the videos from the iPhoto Library (Aperture & iPhoto share the same library format) to the external drive or NAS. The files will thus change from \"managed\" to \"referenced\" status. Aperture can do this easily on a per-file basis. Most experts do not recommend using referenced (externally-stored) files with iPhoto.\n", "Q: How to find closest AppleCare service provider A friend is considering buying a MacBook pro AppleCare package. She lives on the Canary Islands, and is getting a new MacBook soon.\nIs there any official information on what kind of AppleCare services are available there? I don't seem to be able to find that information anywhere on the Apple site - and I don't speak Spanish, so searching apple.es is out of the question. \n\nA: You can use http://www.apple.com/buy to find a reseller or for third-party AppleCare support. For the Canary Islands, you could use http://www.apple.com/es/buy; either open a UK/US version of the same page side-by-side, or use Chrome to translate it.\nIn any case, I can see a result when searching /es/buy/ for \"Canary Islands\" under \"Servicios\":\nUNIVERSOMAC, S.L.\nROBAYNA, 13, LOCAL IZQ\n38003 - SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE\nTel. +34 922 226 086\nAuthorised Training Centres\nApple Authorised Service Providers\n\n\nA: Apple has a great short list of international web sites and phone numbers to get support. It might be worth a call to make sure you understand how to get service in Spain and if they are OK with a purchase of the Mac or AppleCare from outside the country or if it's better to buy one or both from within Spain.\nThe Warranty is established at the time and country of sale. I think it's possible to buy AppleCare in a country different than the purchase of the mac - but you might want to talk directly to Apple before buying either at 1-800-MY-APPLE. \nYou might save time and hassle by getting an OK in writing or an email to buy here and get service there.\nNo matter where in the world you are - you technically have to go through the support organization that is in place for the country where the mac was first purchased and/or the country where AppleCare was purchased.\nI have never had issues when I buy directly from Apple and get service from Apple worldwide. The US applecare arranged service for me in Spain well before they opened Retail Stores in Spain.\nYou can call them directly in the country of purchase, country of convenience or pretty much any Apple owned employee. For countries where Apple has no direct sales presence, you may be limited to that country and have to deal with that country's official support vendor and not with Apple directly.\nWhen you are in a country with an Apple Retail presence, you almost always can get great service from them or an independent but Authorized AppleCare vendor. Countries without that presence may be just as good or more limited and depend more heavily on the vendor that handles support and not Apple itself. \nThe Apple warranty and repair policies although full of legal terms, the section that describes what is covered and how to get service written in plain english and is short in length. This page shows the specific AppleCare plans around the world and this chart shows some of the coverage differences for other non-CPU AppleCare service plans. \n", "Q: Examples of apps in the Mac App Store not made with objective-c/c/c++? Are there any apps in the store made using mono, ruby or lisp or put together in another alternative way. \nDo you know of any?\nThe reason I'm asking is because I'm already making apps using cocoa/objective-c, and I really love ruby and obscure languages.\n\nA: It looks like Briquette is written in MacRuby and made it into the MAS, so it looks like there is at least one alternative to Objective-C for MAS apps.\n\nA: I'm fairly certain that Crush the Castle used some sort of Flash-to-ObjC converter.\n\nA: This app is a QT app according to this thread, so QT is ok I in the MAS I guess.\nHowever this doesn't shed any light on wether alternative languages are allowed in the MAS.\n\nA: QuickAlarm was primarily written in MacRuby along with some Objective C routines.\n\nA: There are loads of electron applications. WhatsApp is in the Mac App store, for example.\nPerhaps it isn't in as an obscure programming language as you might have been thinking of but nonetheless, Electron is an option other than Objective-C or Swift.\n", "Q: I have a shared folder called \"Foldername\" that shows up on another computer as \"Foldername-2\" I shared a folder on my computer, called \"Foldername\". My account on the computer is UserA, my wife's account is UserB. I gave UserB read+write access on Foldername, and \nclicked the \"shared folder\" box.\nOn my wife's compuer, I log in to account UserB, and do \"Connect to Server\" and select my computer. It asks for the password for UserB, and it connects. In the dialog to select what folder to connect to, it lists \"Foldername-2\".\nI have searched both macs for anything named \"Foldername\" and there is only the one. Any idea what is causing this? It's not a huge deal since the folder appears to work, it just worries me that the OS seems to think there is a duplicate somewhere in the system.\n\nA: The -# suffix is appended to an item in OS X when another item with an identical name already exists in that directory. Is there a chance you're enabling a shared folder that's named exactly the same as a folder that already exists in that directory?\n\nA: You can check all the folders which your machine is sharing via:\nSystem Preferences > Sharing > File Sharing\nThere, on Shared Folders list, you can see all shared folders and resolve the naming conflict by providing unique names for each one of them.\n", "Q: TCP Test Tool for Mac OS X I have been using this simple TCP Test Tool on Windows. It is a very basic GUI for listening ports and making TCP requests, yet it was very handy. However I could not find anything similar which works on Mac OS X.\nDoes anybody have any suggestions?\n\nA: You might also find Wireshark useful.  I found a good video on Youtube to getting it setup.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxeHm0BKdwc\nAll the steps in the video may no longer be necessary as the changelog for version 1.6.0 says the following:\n\nWireshark is now distributed as an installation package rather than a drag-installer on OS X. The installer adds a startup item that should make it easier to capture packets.\n\n\nA: The closest free tool might be Nmap and the associated X11 GUI called Zenmap.\nIt's great, powerful, but the free means you will spend some time getting it set up and running since it's not like buying a desk but more like directions and only the hard to obtain parts needed to make yourself a desk.\nYou can download all the source for these and compile the programs. For someone familiar with command line and building open source unix tools it might be 30 to 90 minutes of effort to figure out any build errors and correct them. \nI don't see an up-to-date package that lets you download and run Zenmap and it runs under X11 so if you are new to X11 - do read up a bit here or on the Apple discussion boards - it's just a little different than a normal mac program so you might also spend some time learning X11 before you will be running the tool.\nI don't mean to make any of this seem overly hard. A motivated but absolute beginner can get this all done in a day with luck - just that it's not something you will have running in 5 minutes. Your curiosity to debug networking might make this a great journey in learning how the software really works by looking at the code and seeing the tool actually run.\n\nA: I can definitely recommend Packet Sender for sending and receiving TCP and UDP packets.\nHere are some of the advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*More focused than WireShark (which core functionality is capturing and analyzing existing traffic) and Nmap (which is mainly a security tool)\n\n*Super-simple utility with GUI, no learning curve\n\n*Open-source and free\n\n*Cross-platform\n\n", "Q: Can I adjust the time delay for when the dock re-appears? I like to hide the dock unless I need it.  There is a slight delay before it will reappear.  Is there a Terminal setting I can change so that the dock will instantly appear when I move my mouse to the bottom of the screen? I like how things work but want to tweak the timing.\n\nA: *\n\n*defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.6 reduces the delay and makes the animation for showing and hiding the Dock faster.\n\n*defaults write com.apple.Dock autohide-delay -float 0.05 only reduces the delay before the Dock is shown on hover.\n\n*defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-fullscreen-delayed -bool false only removes the additional delay for showing the Dock in full screen.\n\n\nA: You can manually set the time it takes for the dock to appear using the defaults write commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*autohide-delay → custom appearance delay with dock animation\n\n*autohide-time-modifier → custom appearance delay without dock animation\n\n\nFirst, activate auto-hide in System Preferences → Dock → Autohide or type ⌘+⌥+D\nThen open the Terminal and type:\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock autohide-delay -float 0; killall Dock\n\n\n\n*\n\n*0 is the time it takes for the Dock to appear in seconds. You can choose floats and integers e.g. 2, 0.5,...\n\n*killall Dock causes the Dock to restart\n\n*the syntax is the same for autohide-time-modifier\nRestore the default behavior using...\ndefaults delete com.apple.Dock autohide-delay; killall Dock\n\nAccording to MacOSHints this trick was found by reverse engineering from the developer Christian Baumgart of Hyperdock.\n\nA: You can use Cmd-Opt-D to toggle the dock being visible and it seems to happen immediately. Unfortunately, using this moves the windows most applications to make room for the dock. The keyboard shortcut you use can be customized in Apple>System Preferences>Keyboard>Keyboard Shortcuts.\nDepending on what you're using the dock for, you might want to check into other solutions. Personally, I never use the dock and leave it always hidden. For launching applications I use Butler. For seeing what's currently running, Cmd-Tab works for me.\n", "Q: Map Right Command Key to Escape? Quite simply, I'd just like to modify the right command key to escape and that's it. Keep the left command key as is.\nThe only tool I've been able to find for this is ControllerMate but I'd rather not pay $14 to map one key.\nCan anyone suggest a free alternative?\n\nA: You can download Ukelele. It is an free keyboard layout editor, and you can make a new layout for your keyboard where simple redefine the keys. In the package are sample keyboards and a manual/tutorial too.\n\nA: Ukelele or keylayout files can't be used to change modifier keys to other keys. But you could use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::ESCAPE</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nThis would only change pressing the right command to escape:\n__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::ESCAPE\n\n<only>VI, TERMINAL</only> would apply the settings only when MacVim, Terminal, or iTerm is frontmost.\nSee the source for the key code values and predefined settings.\n", "Q: Can OS X play AMR files? I have an AMR-format audio file which I recorded with my HTC Desire. I would like to send it to somebody who has a Macbook Pro.

I don't have any AMR files to test it, though.\n\nA: I'm sure, VLC will play them. \n", "Q: Find folder on network drive, based on username using bash shell in Automator. I'm new to Automator, but I've had a Mac for quite some time, and I'm not a total noob. :)\nHere is my problem:\nUsers need to make a backup (to desktop) of a folder located on a network drive. The folder name on the network drive is the same as the user's short username.\nThis is no problem if the user selects the folder themselves; I´ve made a workflow that does this. But I need this script to automatically find the folder on the network drive, based on the username and copy it to the desktop.\nAny ideas how to find that folder and pass it on as my inputfolder variable? I assume I need to use a bash shell or applescript command in my workflow?\n\nA: With the information provided, I think the following should work (screenshot follows):\nRun Shell Script\necho \"afp://192.168.0.115/foto/\"\nIgnore input \nGet Specified Servers \nConnect to Servers \nNew Folder\nName: Backup\nIgnore input \nSet Value of Variable\nVariable: Destination  \nRun Shell Script\necho \"/Volumes/foto/$USER\"\nIgnore input \nCopy Finder Items\nTo: Destination variable (drag the \"Destination\" variable from the variable list to the \"To\" menu)\nCheck \"Replacing existing files\" if needed.  \nVariation for Incremental Backups\nIf you want incremental backups, you could replace Copy Finder Items with New Dated Folder, also setting its Destination to the Destination variable, and setting the \"Action with passed items\" option to \"Duplicate passed items to the new folder\". Make sure to enter something in the \"Name\" field, otherwise it won't work. To keep the backups listed in chronological order, you can set the Format to be Year-Month-Day and check the following options: \"Leading zero for day\", \"Leading zero month\", and \"Month as number\". \n\n\nA: Finally you told what you have done. Now need to know what is the result after your 3.Connect to Servers. Because, the path depends on it.\nCheck the next screenshot, the connect returns /Volumes/minidata and the script add only the foto part.\n\n", "Q: I Installed The Unarchiver from the App Store - where should it be? I'm a long-time The Unarchiver user. I noticed today that it can be installed and package-controlled by the App Store.\nI'm a total App Store novice.\nNormally The Unarchiver sits in /Applications/Utilities/. I didn't uninstall The Unarchiver before I installed it from the App Store.\nIs there a way of determining that the version of The Unarchiver in /Applications/Utilities/ is the one from the App Store? Further, is there a way in the App Store to see all my software installed via the App Store at a glance?\n\nA: App Store apps end up in /Applications.\nI'd uninstall all copies of The Unarchiver using something like TrashMe and then reinstall via the App Store if it's the App Store release that you really want. The App Store's ability to upgrade non-App Store purchased software is hit and miss.\n", "Q: How do I delete forward on a Macbook Pro? I know this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fn + backspace - \"del\" key (delete letter to the right) <-- where's the Fn key in the MBP?\n\n*Alt + backspace - Delete last word\n\n*Command + backspace - Delete whole line\n\n\nNow... there is no Fn Key on a MacBook Pro. What key combination should I use, or it's a matter of simply: It's not possible?\n\nA: I use crtl + K  to kill the rest of the line, effectivly deleting all text after the cursor on that line. \n\nA: MacBook Pro 2006 Non-Unibody Fn Key\nEdited based on the comment:\n\n\n\nMacBook Pro 2011 Fn Key\nI suspect you've just missed it, as noted in CajunLuke's comment. I checked several international keyboards as well.\n\n13\"\n\n\n15\"\n\n\n17\"\n\n\nA: As an alternative to Fn+delete, you can also use control+D to trigger a forward-delete, at least in most places.  Some older apps may not support it, apparently.\n\nA: My MacBook Pro had a Fn key at lower left, and the pictures I can find confirm this (the keyboard changed several times and mine was an early model).\n\nA: Don't forget the software keyboard viewer in case your hardware key for function is moved or you might have an international keyboard instead of the standard US layout.\n\nA: Once again Keyboard Maestro comes to the rescue.  I set Shift-Delete as a hotkey to trigger a fn-delete keystroke.  Works a charm.  \nKeyboard Maestro is worth the price for the time saved.  For instance, I set 1 to backspace twice and type my email address,2 returns my wife's email address, etc, etc.  \n", "Q: How much space is recommended for a Windows 7 Bootcamp installation besides Snow Leopard? How much space is recommended for a Windows 7 Bootcamp installation besides Snow Leopard? I thought of 30 Gigabyte. Would that be sufficient?\n\nA: My Parallels virtual HDD has 12GB. But I using windows only in sometimes.\nThe space is depend on what you want install into windows. And really need BootCamp? Parallels or VMware or VirtualBox(free) is fine - why you need BootCamp?\n", "Q: How Do I Run Xcode I just downloaded and installed Xcode on my MacBook Pro, but I don't see it under Applications or Utilities.  I also don't see a shortcut at the bottom.  How do I run it?\n\nA: Xcode is located in /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app. Double-click it to open it. If you want, you can make an alias to it in your applications folder.\n\nA: After you buy Xcode from the App Store you will be left with an 'Install Xcode' application in your Applications folder -- run that. It'll do the actual install and after all of that is said and done you'll have a /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app application in your PATH.\n", "Q: Does overcharging an iPhone degrade its life? I often like to charge my iPhone for long periods at a time (like say when I'd get home I will just plug it into the charger regardless of how much battery there is left).\nWill this spoil my phone by overcharging or will it in any way, degrade my phone?\n\nA: An iPhone (in working order) stops charging when it reaches 100%, even if you leave it plugged in.  Or are you perhaps asking about a malfunctioning iPhone, where for some reason this cut-off is not working?\n\nA: It's fine to leave the battery plugged in after the counter reads 100%. Apple's official iPhone Battery guide doesn't mention overcharging the lithium-ion in every iPhone.\n", "Q: Where can I buy the four hard drive screws for my MacBook Pro 2011 15\" (pic) I'm trying to find four replacement mounting screws for the 2.5\" hard drive in my MacBook Pro 2011 15\".\nHere's a pic of the four screws  (one attached to hard drive).\nI tried Googling and can't find anything. Are these screws available online?\n\nA: MacRecycling offers these screws as well. They seem to be quite pricey though!\n\nA: You can find them, and most any other Apple repair parts, at ifixit\n\nA: I'm not sure why the tutorials are suggesting T5's. Historically the proper Torx is a T8. \nRegardless, they're meant only as pegs to stabilize the drive inside the body. You don't need these explicitly. So long as you have something with compatible threading and reach, it will function the same.\n\nA: I used to use a service called \"The PowerBook Guy\" which has morphed into Keane Mac Repair: http://www.keanesf.com/. Another resource for parts and fixing stuff.\n\nA: In a pinch, I discovered that the lowly Q-Tip offers the perfect solution.  The shaft is the exact same diameter.  Just nip off the cotton, then insert the shaft fully into each hole, and cut with wire cutters allowing about 1/8\" to stick out.  Works just great!\n", "Q: What memory to buy for macbook pro 17\" early 2011? What brand/model of memory do I need to buy for a macbook pro 17\" early 2011 model?  On Apple's memory page, they just say DDR3 1333mhz SODIMM.  So I went to purchase some from Newegg and happened to notice in the comments people complaining the mushkin RAM was not working on their macbook pro...\nI just want to find the lowest priced working 8gbytes RAM.\nAlso, I assume Apple put 2x2gbytes in and I need to purchase 2x4gbytes to replace it.  Is it possible they put 1x4gbytes and so I only need to buy 1x4gbytes to add to it?\n\nA: As long as the technical specifications (DDR speed, clock, physical size) line up to what Apple lists for your model MBP, you should be fine.\nTo answer your second question, that isn't possible. MBPs (along with every laptop I have ever opened up) contain only two RAM slots.\n\nA: I`d suggest go to http://www.transintl.com/ memory page you will find all information about mac memory.\n2nd option use Scanner app\n", "Q: Is it possible to export all my iPhone contacts to my iPad 2?

AirPrint is a function on iOS that allows you to print from your iPad (or whatever) to certain wireless printers.  Sadly, there are only a dozen or so compatible printers.\nHowever, on the article on AirPrint on Wikipedia, the article states that it is possible to make the feature work with ANY printer that is connected to your mac. Specifically, the text says:\n\"For other printers, AirPrint support can be added to an existing CUPS Server with DNS based Service Discovery, by manually adding DNS-SD printer service discovery records to a name server.[7]\" \nThe footnote takes a person to a very techie article about DNS stuff:  http://www.dns-sd.org/ServerStaticSetup.html ... but it is not written in a way an average power user could understand.\nMy question: What is an only-moderately-techie set of instructions that will tell me how to configure this, using this method, so that I can have my iPad print wirelessly to an HP P1102w printer that is connected (via wifi, in fact) to my mac?\n\nA: I know this isn't directly what you asked for, but if you are looking for a non-techie approach to sharing printers via Airprint, you could do far worse than to use Printopia.  It's not free, but it isn't expensive and it works very well indeed.\n\nA: It's not \"non\" techie, but there's a more detailed explanation at\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2751128?start=0&tstart=0\n(I intend to try this, but have not yet...)\n", "Q: How to change power savings settings on iPad 2, iOS 4.3.3 After a few minutes, if I haven't touched the iPad 2's screen, it goes dim and then turns off. I suppose this is a power savings behavior; however, when it is connected to my computer I don't want it to power down. How can I change the power savings settings?\n\nA: Go to settings>general>auto lock>never .\nor\nIf you have the smartcover you can also set that as the on/off trigger. \n", "Q: Can tables from Pages be reused in Numbers to create graphs? I created a table in Pages '09 and pasted it into Numbers '09 to see if it worked, then I created a graph for it, still in Numbers, but the graph displayed no data as you can see from the screenshot.\nSo is it because the table came from Pages or there's something I must do before it works ?\nI'd like to know if it's safe to create tables in Pages or if they are going to be trapped in it, in that case I'll prefer to create them in Numbers and then paste them into Pages.\n\n\nA: I have had the best luck keeping the data in Numbers and only pasting tables and graphs into Pages. But that is because I like the added tools in Numbers and not that I've had any issues pasting back or forth.\nI've done a few tests and can't replicate your issue on '09 versions of both iWork programs. Have you experimented pasting the data from pages to numbers as values (or paste and match style)? It is a long shot, but the two things that come to mind is pasting into a new spreadsheet (in case the one you are using has some sort of issue) or pasting data that is somehow formatted to cause an obscure problem.\n", "Q: limit resource use of java app I'm using the 'Diablo' app to mine bitcoins on my work computer.\nBut since I need to use that computer, I don't want it to consume all my resources as it is wont to do.\nAnyway to limit it to use only 3/4 cores or half of the GPU or whatever?\nThanks.\n\nA: It's generally hard to throttle java - doubly so in this case where the app in question is designed to solely focus on crunching as many numbers as possible. Luckily, the diablo miner has an -f option to dial back the computations.\nIt's trial and error, but you can read up on this huge thread and search for CPU for more details.\n\"-f 1000 will greatly reduce mhash speed, but increase desktop interactivity. -f should be a multiple or divisor of 60, lower values increase speed but decrease desktop interactivity, higher values do the opposite.\"\nIt's best to get GPU only going as CPU mining is very expensive in terms of heat and electricity as well as reduced performance.\n", "Q: Viewing a PDF with links on iPad Are there any (hopefully free) iPad apps for viewing PDFs containing links?\nFor instance, I have a long PDF with a table of contents in the beginning containing links to later parts of the PDF. These links work when reading the PDF in Preview on my laptop -- when I click on the link for a specific section, the Preview jumps to that section.\nUnfortunately, on my iPad, none of the PDF readers I've tried so far support this functionality. Are there any apps for the iPad that work like Preview?\n\nA: GoodReader is not free but supports linking.\n\nA: I just checked iBooks and it followed links to other parts of the document. It will also follow links to the browser if you allow it. Of course iBooks is free and there are a few ways to get pdf files loaded. It should be noted that navigation is far from full feature but it will probably improve over time.\n", "Q: How many HD video minutes do I get per 1GB of free storage? I have 7GB free. If I give that to someone to record, what sort of ballpark figure would I get for a HD video recording? There may be about 10 individual videos being recorded over a couple of hours, if that makes a difference. Maybe just one hour long one.\nI just want to know a rough figure but ideally with some maths so I can work it out myself.\n\nA: The iPhone 4S takes video at 1080p and 30 fps and initial tests are showing that video takes 200MB per minute. At roughly 12 GB per hour, what seemed staggering a year ago is now quite quaint with the iPhone 4 recording at less than 5 GB / hour.\nMacWorld reports that an hour of iPhone 4 video is 4.8 gig.\n\nThe iPhone records its 720p HD video at around 10 megabits (Mbps) per second. That translates to about 80MB per minute, as we noted above, or a staggering 4.8GB per hour. (Hope you sprung for the 32GB model!)\n\n\nA: I just made a 15.5 minute test video with my iPhone 5S. File size is 1.31 GB, or 85 MB/minute. 7 GB of storage would handle 82 minutes of video.\nOf course the complexity of the video and audio should have an effect on the compression, so this is just a rough guideline.\n\nA: It's impossible to estimate without looking at the footage first, or at least having a description of what will be shot (a crowd of people running around at Grand Central or 2 people sitting on a bench), the lighting conditions (night, with no lights, or day), the way it will be shot (on a locked tripod or over the shoulder, panning left and right like a maniac), etc...\n\nA: 1gb from a\n\n\n*\n\n*Webacm-30 mins\n\n*iPhone 5s-55 mins\n\n*iphone 5-45 mins\n\n*iphone 4s-30 mins\n\n*iphone 4-27 mins\n\n*iphone 3gs-23.5 mins\n\n*iphone 3g-17 mins\n\n*iphone 2-6 mins\n\n*iphone 1-3 mins\n\n*camera-1.25 hour\n\n*film cam-3 hours\n\n\nA: It is scientifically proven that 1gb will take a 58 minute video for an iPhone 6.\n", "Q: How do I install the VLC Web Browser Plugin in Firefox? I am running OS X Version 10.6.7 and Firefox 4.0.1. I am trying to install the Web browser plugins for 10.5 and later (release 1.0.5), there is not a newer version of the plugin at the moment. I downloaded the dmg, ran the installer with firefox closed, then rebooted. Launched Firefox and went to about:plugins. It was still not listed.\nI went to /Library/Internet Plug-Ins and saw VLC Plugin.plugin which I assume is the location it is supposed to be in. I went ahead and tried the page I needed it for and it still says I am missing the plugin.\nIf it matters I am trying to use this with a Foscam Networked camera on my local lan. They added support for audio in firefox by using the vlc plugin (supposedly). \nI am currently working on the assumption that I doing something wrong. Any suggestions would be appreciated, although I assume it is possible that the plugin is not compatible with the current version of firefox, or foscam has done something wrong.\n\nA: After posting the question, I went ahead and tried it in Firefox 3.6.17 and it worked. So apparently the VLC Web Browser Plugin does not work in Firefox 3.6.17. The best solution at this point is to just feed the stream directly into VLC instead. It seems to work in my case.\n", "Q: What app to use for high res webcam photo capture? Photo Booth does 640x480. I know the HD webcam on the 2011 MacBook Pros can do better than that. What app can I use for taking full resolution stills?\n\nA: Photo Booth in Lion does 1080x720 captures in JPEG when the hardware supports it.\n\nA: Try the free Skitch (also available from the Mac App Store). One of the many things it can do is a Cam Snapshot. To take one, invoke Skitch, then choose Capture > Cam Snapshot. You may need to fiddle a bit with the size of the snapshot to get full resolution.\nThis worked to the max resolution of the iSight on my older MacBook Pro; it's worth a try on the current models with their FaceTime HD cameras.\n\nA: I searched for that too. The best option for me was to use VLC.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open VLC\n\n*Type Cmd+R\n\n*Choose your camera and the resolution that you want (that your camera is capable of)\n\n*Then type Cmd+Option+S to take a snapshot within VLC (aka your photo)\n\n\nYou can also tweak the settings of VLC to chose the name of your output (which can contain variables), and its type (png, jpg, tiff).\n\nA: Kinda roundabout, but you could try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Quicktime.\n\n*Choose File -> New Movie Recording.\n\n*On the little down arrow to the right of the record button, choose maximum quality.  Also drag the record button holder to least obtrusive location.\n\n*Command-3 to fit to screen.\n\n*Take screen shots with command-shift-(3 or 4).\n\n\nA: Quicky by BlackOp is my choice.  it lets you do lossless webcam video capture.

It is at: http://www.orbicule.com/macnification/\nHowever it is dated, probably won't work with Catalina, is unsigned and comes from a non https secured website.\n", "Q: How do I call myself using Facetime? I have Facetime on my MacBook and Facetime on my iPad.  Of course I also have one Apple ID account.  Sometimes the family uses the iPad while I'm away.  I'd like to be able to call \"myself\", that is my iPad from my MacBook.  How do I do this?\n\nA: The short answer - you can either call a phone number (iPhone + FaceTime) or an AppleID (iPod/Mac/iPad + FaceTime) and you can't call another device with the same number.\nTo call back to your mac (or any other AppleID device) - you'll have to make a second account with a different Apple ID. Similarly - there's no easy way to get the phone number into another device since that gets authenticated over SMS in the background and not user/password for AppleID.\nIf you are calling from an iPhone - you can call your AppleID devices (they all ring and any one can pick up), but for AppleID based calls - you need to call a different AppleID unless Apple ever changes the current software.\nLast clarification - AppleID is just a string but most people use an email address since that is more likely to be unique to one person.\n\nA: Go to the Settings app in your iPad. Navigate to Facetime on the left column. Under \"You can be reached for video calls at:\", click \"Add Another Email...\" You should be able to call your alternative email address from your MacBook.\n\nA: OK, just tried it.\nI have my iPhone number stored in my Macbook Air FaceTime list, and my primary email stored in my iPhone FaceTime list.\nCalling my phone number from the Macbook works fine; calling my email address from my iPhone also works fine.\nOS 10.10.5\n\nA: In this case I dont think it is possible with the way Facetime is configured. \nFacetime has some sort of reverse dialing mechanism associated with your apple id. That means you need to dial out to a different unique id. \nIf you create a second apple id for this purpose and associate it with the iPad or the macbook, you should be able to call them when you are away.\n\nA: You need to make sure that the email or phone number is the main device and different one each device.\n\nA: It is possible. I tried it as well.\n\nI hope this pic will help you to set up.\n.

I've tried everything: rebooting the phone, restoring from an iTunes backup, side-loading the app from iTunes, but nothing has worked.\nWhen I turn Airplane Mode on and then off again, I get an alert popup that says \"Unable to download application. It will be available for download when you log in to the iTunes Store on your computer\".\nI've tried what it recommends, but nothing seems to work.\n\nA: The springboard has several mechanisms to prevent this from being a permanent situation, but sometimes it falls down. Normally you can cancel a download cleanly. I generally follow this advice to \"help\" the springboard finish or abort the download transaction:\n\n\n*\n\n*(just use the X to cancel the download) - How can I cancel an app installation on the iPhone?\n\n*(reboot the phone) - Why are my updating iPhone apps \"waiting...\" forever?\n\n*(reboot with airplane mode and sync) - How to fix apps \"waiting..\" forever after sync?\nHowever, you could have your springboard stuck and a restore is needed. This is discussed here:\n\n\n*\n\n*(last ditch efforts and restore as new) - How can I remove this half-downloaded app from my iPhone?\nWith the information you provided, it's difficult to tell which of the two causes is happening on your phone.\n\nA: After a week with Apple Customer Support, we resolved the issue by reinstalling iOS with a factory restore, setting up as a new device, then restoring the phone from a backup. \nTo clarify, a factory restore is not the same as erasing all content and settings. A factory restore can only be done by connecting to iTunes.\n\nRestore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to factory settings\nA factory restore erases the information and settings on your iPhone,\n  iPad, or iPod and installs the latest version of iOS or iPod software.\nGet your device ready\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Check that you have the latest version of iTunes on your Mac or PC.\n  \n*If you want to save the information on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod, make a backup.\n  \n*Go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud, then turn off Find My iPhone. For an unresponsive device or one that won't turn on, learn\n  what to do. If you forgot your passcode, get help.\n\nRestore your device to factory settings\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open iTunes on your Mac or PC.\n  \n*Connect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to your computer with the cable that came with your device.\n  \n*If a message asks for your device passcode or to Trust This Computer, follow the onscreen steps. If you forgot your passcode, get help. \n  \n*Select your iPhone, iPad, or iPod when it appears in iTunes. For an unresponsive device or one that won't turn on, learn what to do. Or\n  get help if your device doesn't appear in iTunes.\n\n  \n*In the Summary panel, click Restore [device].\n\n  \n*Click Restore again to confirm. Then iTunes erases your device and installs the latest iOS or iPod software.\n\n  \n*After your device restores to factory settings, it restarts. Now you can set it up as new.\n\nExtra notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to preserve Health and Activity data when making an iTunes backup, you will need to encrypt your backup.\n\n*During the new device setup, make sure to select Set Up Manually when prompted for Quick Start. You should not restore from another iOS 11 device.\n\n*After setting your phone up as a new device, you may want to make sure you can download apps on your fresh device before restoring from your backup.\n\n\nA: I've been fighting with this for several days now, and I think I finally cracked it. Check your iTunes Downloads (iTunes->More->Downloads) in iOS for stuck downloads. I had a music video that appears to have been gumming up the works.\nPrior to pausing that download I had tried rebooting, logging out of iTunes and all the other suggestions on lots of other blogs/sites/forums.\n(Sorry, I have this answer in a few place, the question has a few duplicates)\n\nA: Looks like your problem issue was solved by itself but next time here's one thing you can try: jailbreaking.\nAt very least you'd be able to ssh into the system and try to see what's wrong and perform a high number of tests if you're willing to go deep enough into the rabbit's hole.\nFor the record, I've had similar issues while installing apps, except they never lasted for even 1 day.\n", "Q: How can I copy and paste multiple texts?

I've installed python 2.7 with the dmg-installer of the official python page. After typing which python in terminal, I get this:\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python\nBut when I want to install a package with easy_install, for example like this easy_install pycassa, I get the message Installed /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/pycassa-1.1.0-py2.6.egg, what is obviously the wrong path. So when I try to use the installed package with import pycassa I get the error \"no module named pycassa\".\nSo how can I fix this issue best?\n\nA: Find out where easy_install is by in terminal \nwhich easy_install\n\nI suspect that it will be /usr/bin which is Apple's python 2.6\nEDIT: I don't have the python.org python so this is from memory.\nTo use easy_install for the python.org 2.7 use /usr/local/bin/easy_install or /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/easy_install\nAlso easy_install is not in the Python standard library so you would have to install a package either setuptools or distribute I think the latter is now the preferred one.\nTo check what easy_install does look at the first line and see what python is used in the #! line\n\nA: It seems that your installation of setuptools is obsolete.\nIf you want your \"easy_install\" match your updated python version, follow these steps:\nDownload the corresponding .egg file at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files\nRun it as if it were a shell script: sh setuptools-0.6c9-py2.7.egg\nThis will install the new \"easy_install\" executable, compatible with your current version of python.\nHope this helps.\n(more details at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#cygwin-mac-os-x-linux-other)\n\nA: After installing a new version of the setup tools you may find that you have multiple copies of easy_install installed. \nTry: 'which easy_install' \nIf its not the right version, you'll probably find you have other links 'easy_install<tab>' should show something like:\nPER-MMSX:actions doug$ easy_install\neasy_install      easy_install-2.5  easy_install-2.6  easy_install-2.7  \n\nUse 'sudo easy_install-2.7 ' to ensure that you're using exactly the right version.\n", "Q: iPhone has addresses - will that first sync remove them? We have an older iPhone (8GB, 1st gen, jailbroken) that my girlfriend got from a friend (now on sabbatical, so no tech support). It's running iOS 3, the last version possible on a 1st-gen phone - I think her friend  saw her old nokia and took pity on her. \nHe erased the phone prior to her getting it, and she's spent some considerable time manually adding phone numbers. Now she'd like to back up her addresses and put some music on it so I downloaded and installed iTunes on her PC (XP) but I was concerned that the first sync might remove her addresses. \n• She's got no prior installs of iTunes or an iPhone, so nothing to overwrite\n• I don't see a way to back up addresses to the SIM, only get them from the SIM\n• It's on XP (I use a mac) and so where would addresses sync to?\nThis should just sync and go, right? \nBonus question: \nI don't think she's got anything running her contacts on, and worse - she's only using a Hotmail account. Does the  iOS3 allow the phone to sync with any external systems like Gmail? \nThanks!\n\nA: She shouldn't lose any contacts by syncing with itunes. She might easily end up with duplicates, though, if the same address is in both places. As I understand, every item in the address book is equipped with a UUID. When you delete a record on one device, the UUID is put in a list of deleted records, and so the corresponding record is deleted on other devices during a sync. But that is supposed to be the only way records are deleted from syncing.\nDisclaimer: The above is what I have inferred from observation. I haven't seen it in any authoritative documentation, so there is a possibility that it is not entirely accurate. Use this advice at your own risk.\n\nA: She will loose contacts. \nMake sure that before you sync (as soon as you connect your iphone, iTunes will open, but stop it from syncing by unlocking your iPhone by sliding it open), you select the Merge contacts option in the iPhone's Info Tab in iTunes.\nI've lost a lot of contact from my iPhone simply because of this reason.\nThe best option is to download applications like Funambol to backup your iPhone's contacts and data to the Internet. You'll need to create a free Funambol account on the internet first.\n", "Q: Access a printer on the network that is connected via USB to a Windows 7 PC I have a Canon PIXMA iP5000 printer that is connected via USB to a Windows 7 PC.

A relative told me that iOS can playback YouTube videos.\nI thought that YouTube requires Flash. How come this is possible without Flash in iOS? \n\nA: YouTube videos are offered in multiple formats, not only Flash. If viewing on an iOS device, then you get H.264 format.\n\nA: Safari will show what the developper of the given website provides as alternative content for browsers (user agents) that do not support Flash. In many cases this is just nothing or the hint to download Flash player plugin. Youtube videos are played by the built-in youtube app of iOS.\n\nA: There is a Youtube app built in which does not require flash.

If you prefer, you can use -a or -and in between them, but these are redundant. You can also use -o or -or for the OR operator, and you can use parentheses – which must be quoted to protect them from the shell, as in \\( and \\) for grouping.\nFor the full details, run: man find\n\nA: It is considered dangerous to use -exec rm without first ls. You should probably check that first. Reverse check is also a good hint to tell you if your timing is correct.\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime -30d -exec ls -latr {} \\;\n\nOR\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -atime -30d -exec ls -latr {} \\;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Constrain your find result.

Always dry-run first. IMHO it is better using this:\nfind /Volumes/Groups/Projects/530_BFAMI/test/ -ctime +30 -print0 | xargs -0 -n1\n\nthis will show the dry-run and only when you satisfied you can add the rm to the end\nfind /Volumes/Groups/Projects/530_BFAMI/test/ -ctime +30 -print0 | xargs -0 rm\n\nIf you start using this piped to xargs version, you can always add more filters, like:\nfind /some/where -mtime +3d -print0 | grep -ziE '\\.(jpg|png|gif)$' | xargs -0 rm\n\nand similar (more) powerful combinations.\n\nA: Try this: find . -ctime +30 | xargs rm -r 2> /dev/null\nFor some reason, this runs rm twice.

Just like the newly presented iMessage but instead of just between iOS devices, with the Mac too.\nI've looked at Handoff. It can only send links to the iPhone from the Mac.\nI've looked at Droplr. It requires public sharing on a Twitter account. Not what I want.\nI've been using email and have been recommended Evernote. But these solutions require a document that I must create, wait to sync, and/or later delete to free up clutter. I just want to send a quick message.\nI just want an app/application pair that can quickly share links, notes, and pictures between devices, like iMessage.\nDoes what I desire exist?\n\nA: Apple OSX Mountain Lion has been announced, it includes a few of the iOS apps on the mac desktop such as Notes, Game Center, reminders, twitter and message.\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/\n\nA: The best solution I have found for quick and seamless transfer of clips, pictures and links is PasteBot.\nCurrently it works for WiFi sync, but in practice, my phone is always with me when I get home and I don't really need the data to get to the mac sooner than when I'm back home. I would expect them to try to extend the syncing to use the iCloud API announced but still in beta testing - but there's no promise it will work just like iMessage over the air using sync.\nI don't use PasteBot to share links since I use pinboard.in and instapaper for that and they work so much better for me than getting the links over a clipboard. The announced Reading List sync between iOS and Safari on the desktop might also serve your needs.\nGood luck - there are many options and hopefully you find one that works best for you.\n\nA: I agree iMessage is the best solution.  For those that (for whatever reason, may not be able to use this) here is a solution for quick notes sync.  I created a contact on my iPhone called \"My Notes\" and put what text I want on the notes section and it instantly syncs with Address Book on my mac.  And at the desktop I do the reverse,  I go to the same contact and add a note in the notes section and it syncs instantly.\nQuick, no file to create/save/manually sync/whatever.  \nHowever, it's only for quick text notes, not photos/files/etc.\nI thought it was cool ;)  but iMessenger is more complete and now it's available... but hey, it's good to have choices.\n\nA: Evernote does this. Photos, notes, screenshots, audio memos, etc. can be  captured and shared between your Mac and iPhone. \n\nA: I don't know iMessage and I can't see why you need this, but there is Syncopy. Hope this does it.\n\nA: iTunes.\niTunes will sync Safari bookmarks, Notes app notes and photos.\niMessage doesn't sync anything between devices. It's like GMail for text messaging. You access your text messaging conversations from any device.\n\nA: RE: \".. I just want an app/application pair that can quickly share links, notes, and pictures between devices, like iMessage.\"\nThere is nothing I know of that does everything you require as simply as iMessage, but I can give you my solution for this (since this is something that I also require).\nFor quickly sharing links & notes between iOS devices and a Mac (as well as PCs running Windows or Linux), I use simplenote.\nYou can create a free account and then start using simplenote on all of your devices, simply through their web login (you can also buy a neat simplenote app so that you can store your notes offline, when you are not connected to the internet, but this is optional).\nFor quickly sharing photos between iOS devices and a Mac, I use instagram.\nFinally, for when I don't want to write a note to myself, but just simply take note of a particular web site (or URL), I use instapaper (which is free a web based service that you can use, as well as an optional iOS app that you can buy).\nPlease note, since instagram and simplenote both have published their web api's, there are a number of instagram and simplenote clients that you can install on your Mac (again, this is optional, since you can just use their free web based service).\nThe following are optional apps you can install on a Mac :\nFor the Mac, I use nvALT, which syncs my simplenote notes without needing to use a web browser to login to their web site.\nAlso, you may find Screenstagram a nice instagram screen saver on the Mac.\nFor a full fledged instagram client, try instaDesk, or Carousel.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Check out the iOS app called Notefile. It syncs seamlessly with the Notefile widget on Mac.  Its syncing is just about instanteous with all devices. \n\nA: There is no need for third-party apps whether free or paid.\nNotes on iOS syncs with Mail.app on OS X across accounts; iCloud not required. \nAs far as pictures, they do require iCloud syncing. The photos part are synced to ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub each photo into a file. There exists a script that does copy the photos into a directory of your choice. You can search for it.\nFor movies I have not found a simple and elegant way to have them sync over the air yet; without the clutter of third-party solution of course.\nI hope this does suffice.\nIt would be nice to click and hold on something you want to share in iOS and request that it be sent to OS X. Right click on something you want to be sent to iOS and have it sent that way as well.\n\nA: Looks like Apple answered my prayers themselves:\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/messages-beta/\nWhat a lot of posters weren't getting is that I don't want to use synced notes and email because that requires a tedious \"compose\" stage and also leaves behind a bunch of clutter that I either have to search through or delete later.\niMessage lets me quickly send a new message and/or file, lets focus on the latest message, and automatically gets rid of earlier messages over time.\n\nA: Currently, the best app for this is DeskConnect.\n", "Q: It is required to have a mac to build iphone application or we can use VirtualBox to emulate the MAC OS X platform? It is required to have a mac to build iphone application or we can use VirtualBox to emulate the MAC OS X platform and do the same task ? Is there any license restriction ?\nThanks.\n\nA: It is required that you be running OS X and you can't virtualize OS X on non-Apple hardware (by terms in the EULA, not for any technical reasons). Therefore it follows that you need a Mac computer to build iPhone software.\nSee this question and answer for a discussion on virtualizing OS X: Is there a way to evaluate OS X without purchasing Macintosh hardware?\n\nA: Yes, you would have to use a Mac computer.\nRunning MacOSX as a virtual machine would be against Apple's licensing terms.\n\nA: If you want to comply with all Apple's license restrictions, then, yes, you need a Mac to build and sign iOS apps using Apple's latest SDK tools.\n", "Q: Reassign Trackpad Gestures?

What tool or application would you recommend to help me write and sync the subtitles with the video?\n\nA: Never tried this, but is is cross-platform: http://www.aegisub.org/\nAfter i read your comments - IMHO you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make .srt subtitles in any tools what you can manage to work (timing)\n\n*Optionally repair .srt files in any texteditor - skip this if not needed\n\n*Test the .srt subtitles with VLC or Quicktime/Perian\n\n*If everything is OK - embed subtitles into video with http://code.google.com/p/subler/\n\nA: An open-source, cross-platform solution is Jubler\nI didn't try it, but it has a good amount of users on iusethis.\n\nA: While I've never used this to create raw subtitles, here's the couple of programs I've tried for a similar purpose: \n\n\n*\n\n*Subs Factory for creating the subtitles ($7.99). I've actually used it to editing subtitles, but well.\n\n*Subler for embedding them into the mp4. I've used this once or twice about a year ago, and it did what I needed.

I've worked with it in a movie producing company and it delivered very well.\nIt has FinalCut integration (import/export) and works with tons of formats.\nFrom the site:\n\nzeitAnker Annotation Edit gives you a sophisticated interface to attribute and subtitle video or audio in very short time. Therefore we developed techniques hardly found elsewhere and took the chance to build a clean and extensible product from scratch.\n\n\nA: A little bit of digging around turned up Submerge from bitfield. I have not used it, but it looks pretty decent and is listed on Apples's Downloads site. bitfield also has an app named iSubtitle in the Mac App Store which appears to do the same thing.\niSubtitle is $19.99 in the Mac App Store, while Submerge is only $9 from bitfield's web site.\n\nA: Subtitle Edit Pro\nI haven't tried it myself, but there is this piece of software: Subtitle Edit Pro.\n\n\n", "Q: Microsoft Word right-to-left (RTL) support I have on my Mac - Microsoft Word 2010, now … I want to write from right to left ( not only text-align right, but direction ltr).\nI'll be thankful for some help. :)\n\nA: Word 2016 has this language feature if you can upgrade Word. \nThere's no right-to-left support for Microsoft Word 2011 for Mac presently.

Normally with computer hardware (laptops/desktops) we plan for replacement every 3 years. Is it reasonable to expect the iPad to have similar service life or is it more likely that we'll be needing to replace these after only 2 years or less?\n\nA: I think, in the long run, what matters is how well you want to be supported by Apple (especially in a corporate environment). For me personally, if the iPad 3 doesn't have anything all that great, I'll stick with my first-gen iPad if it is working well. But chances will be good that by the time the iPad 3 (or 4) is out, there will also be an increasing number of applications and features in the OS that require a newer iPad, and sooner or later, Apple discontinues support for the older hardware.\nTypically (like a good number of companies), this support is extended to current-gen and previous-gen devices. Given how often a new version of iOS is released, in addition to how often the hardware is rev'd, I would suggest that two years is probably the best life-time in the corporate environment. I fear that at three years, you would have some people on unsupported hardware (and out-of-date OSes -- security risk) for at least a period of a few months, if not a year. \nOf course, physically, the iPad should still be kicking after three years if it is treated well; battery life might not be quite as good, but it should still be sufficient. The bigger issue is your company's willingness to be out of support on older generations for a period of a few months to a year. (Of course, this is a gamble. Apple could surprise us all and release iOS 6 in a year or two that would work from iPhone 3Gs to iPhone 5 and all the iPads. But it isn't likely.)\n\nA: It's difficult to say; iPads just haven't been out that long. I suspect that the key issue for iPad replacement will be the battery lifecycle. Any lithium ion battery has an optimum number of charge/recharge cycles. Apple's iPad battery page says:\n\nA properly maintained iPad battery is\n  designed to retain up to 80% of its\n  original capacity at 1000 full charge\n  and discharge cycles. You may choose\n  to replace your battery when it no\n  longer holds sufficient charge to meet\n  your needs.\n\nThat same page also says \"Charge cycles vary by use, environment, settings, configuration, and many other factors.\" So as an IT department, I would implement a charge/discharge cycle policy to which your users should adhere, to get maximum time and value from the batteries.\nMy personal guess is that it will depend entirely on what apps you will be running, and what version of iOS those apps will require. But I would guess that for standard business use (mail, web browsing, some specialized apps), that a 3 year replacement cycle will work fine for iPads.\n\nA: It could be possible to use them for 3 years, though with Apple's pattern for updates would suggest more for around 2. Usually with the new version of iOS, the current hardware is supported fully, the previous generation of hardware is supported fully (except for minor hardware additions), but then generations before that only get some of the update and it usually slows down the device.\nAlso, you should also think of iPads/tablets as content-consumption devices. In other words, it will be good at things like browsing the web, reading emails, listening to music, but when it comes down to creating things like documents, writing long emails, recording good sound, the iPad is going to fail miserably compared to a laptop. So before you make any decisions, make sure that it can do everything you are expecting it to do.\n", "Q: Are their drivers for the Apple Keyboard in Windows 7 64bit?(Bonus point: Where's Print Screen?) I am using the official wired Apple Keyboard with my Windows 7 64bit Desktop, is there a source for official drivers anywhere?\nI'm kinda fine with the default setup, but I'd really like the ability to printscreen! I am in the UK, but wouldn't mind switching language if that makes all the keys work in he right place.\n\nA: I use a Apple Keyboard on W7 Daily.\nThe key thing is to use a utility that lets you remap the keys.\nPersonally, I use a little utility called KeyTweak (It's Free!), but there are lots of other alternatives.\nThis lets you set unused keys to whatever you want - I have F13 set as print-screen, and F14-F19 set as media playback keys (play, pause, etc).\nIt can also let you fix the windows/alt keys so they are in the correct place, if that bothers you.\nThere are a couple of caveats, namely I have yet to find anything that lets you make use of the \"fn\" and eject keys. However, the additional (unused) F13-F19 keys compensate for that.\n\nA: You can find the drivers in the Mac OS X Install DVD (if you have it) at \\Boot Camp\\Drivers\\Apple\\x64\\AppleKeyboardInstaller64.exe.\nIf you do not have the DVD, you will have to remap the keys, as mentioned in Fake Name's answer.\nTo take a print screen (with the drivers installed), press F13 or Fn+F11.\n\nA: This post help me to get the keyboard driver working:\nApple Keyboard driver for Windows\n", "Q: delete duplicate aliases created by itunes when adding songs stored in my external hard drive I have all my songs in my external hard drive, which is encoded in ntfs. When I add them to itunes, using File -> Add To Library ... it create an alias of each file in my /Users/<user_name>/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music  folder. \nSo far so good, but sometimes it gets confused and create 2 aliases for one same file (meaning the same file on my external drive). It also happens when I want to rescan a folder I have already added to iTunes, it will create a duplicate alias for all the files that were already there in iTunes.\nSo I end up with loads of duplicate aliases in my iTunes Music folder. It looks a bit like that:\n<whatever the song name>.mp3\n<whatever the song name> 1.mp3\n\nSo the second file is a duplicate. What I want to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the aliases from the finder\n\n*Delete the duplicates in itunes\n\n\nAs I have a lot of music, it would take a long time to delete everything manually. As I happen to be a software developer, I have written a script that deletes the duplicate alias files (in finder). \nBut then I end up with an iTunes library full of duplicates, that points to nothing since the alias as been deleted. \nIs there a way to delete from the iTunes library all the files that can not be found ?\n\nA: Try Dupin or Dupin Lite. Dupin is $15 from the developer's site, and Dupin Lite is $8 from the Mac App Store. I recently purchased the full version and used it to delete duplicates from a 57,000 song library. It did a very good job. It's filtering mechanism is highly customizable. It is not super fast, but it ran through my library in less than a day.\nTo specifically deal with your issue, you can set the rules to keep the file with the shorter filename. This will get rid of the commonly found \"whatever the song name 1.mp3\" file, while keeping the \"whatever the song name.mp3\" version.\nAlso, dougscripts.com should be your first stop for any iTunes maintenance scripts. I have found the following scripts especially useful in cleaning up large iTunes Libraries:\nArtist - Name Corrector\nSuper Remove Dead Tracks\nSearch-Replace Tag Text v2.0\nTrack Parser\nRemove n Characters From Front or Back\n\nA: I'm in the middle of this painful task myself.  If you have a Windows OS, you may find the following tools in Command Prompt useful after you open command prompt and change directories to your music directory:\n\ndir /s /b \"* 1.mp3\" > found.txt\n\nwhich searches all subdirectories (/s) and in a very basic format (/b) lists every single file that ends with \" 1.mp3\" and exports it (>) to a new text file called found.txt.  It's very important that before you delete anything vital that you comb through this list to temporarily transport false positives such as \"02 My favorite long chapter - part 1.mp3\" to a separate directory BEFORE you start attacking every file that ends with \" 1.mp3\".\n\nerase /s \"* 1.mp3\"\n\nafter completing the previous step, cross your fingers and hope that you have safely transported all false positives to a safe directory, then press enter and watch the command prompt permanently delete every offending file.\n", "Q: Open PDF using Google Chrome I like the fact that I can use Google's built in PDF viewer instead of a separate application (Adobe Acrobat).

Have you asked the developer if they can implement this as a feature?\nOnly the Apple icons are movable on my 10.6.7 systems so it certainly isn't easy for a developer to get this working and may be impossible in practice. \nThe only workaround would be to have a script that delays the radium start as the leftmost item is the last to load. If you had a launch script that slept for 3 minutes and then killed, relaunched that app - it would be leftmost until another started...

It handles saving files as root automatically, as well as having easy ways to edit invisible files.  I much prefer it for editing config files and the like.\nEDIT: Be sure to get the version of TextWrangler from the Bare Bones Software web site, not the version from the Mac App Store -- the App Store version has the save-as-root feature removed to comply with Apple's rules.\n", "Q: iTunes says this computer is not authorized I have a iPod touch, iOS 4.3, running iTunes 10 on Windows 7.

Why does iTunes keep telling me to authorize this computer if it's already authorized?\n\nA: I found the issue. Turns out the email address I had used to register with Apple had a dot in it. I do this because to the Gmail it's the same things, and it allows me to filter out stuff that I may not want. So I tried authorizing with that ID, and it worked.\n\nA: Go to Settings on your iDevice.\nScroll down to iTunes & Apps.

I just read that apple is now selling unlocked phones? I also read somewhere earlier (probably Wikipedia) that jailbreaking was made legal.\nIs jailbreaking and unlocking the same in this context?\nAddendum:  If they are different, does it also mean that jailbreaking doesn’t unlock the phone? and the steps to unlock are different? I was under the impression that when I jailbroke my phone (using redsn0w), it also became unlocked.\n\nA: As the other answers say, unlocking and jailbreaking aren't the same thing.\nThere are two ways to unlock a locked phone: You either talk the owner of the lock (i.e., the phone company whose network the phone is locked to) into giving you the unlock code (something which, AFAIK, AT&T won't do under any circumstance), or you do without the unlock code. The latter method requires a jailbreak, since the unlock software certainly falls under the “not approved by Apple” umbrella.\n(On a side note, in Europe, phone companies are required by law to give you the unlock code for an unlocked phone once your initial contract (for a year or two?) is completed.\n\nA: iPhones have a built-in mechanism that ensures that all code running on it is under the control of Apple (this is called \"code signing\") and the \"key\" required to sign your code is one of the things Apple charge you for as an iPhone developer.\nJail-braking disables this mechanism, and allow you to run arbitrary code.  This is potentially very dangerous, but may be required to do things not allowed by Apple.   A great deal of effort is being done by Apple to stop jail-braking.\nAn unlocked phone is one not tied to a specific phone company, allowing you to subscribe at any phone company if you want to.\n\nA: Factory unlocked = not locked to one carrier. In some countries, it is only possible to sell factory unlocked phones (by law).\nUnlocking = To convert a locked iPhone into an unlocked one. This can be done via different methods.\nJailbraking = Is an activity that allows a user to install non-Apple-approved software onto the iPhone (and to carry out other non-Apple-approved functions).\n\nA: No.\nApple has been selling unlocked iPhones for a long long time since the iPhone 3G, where some countries required phones to be unlocked, and sold the iPhone 4 unlocked by themselves in some countries.\nJailbreaking allows you to install and modify what is in your iDevice.\nUnlocking allows you to use it with other carriers (GSM only, CDMA iPhones have no SIM card).\nJailbreaking does not unlock your phone. The jailbreaking tool that you used (redsn0w), probably has a built-in unlocking tool.\n\nA: No, they're not the same thing.\nJailbreaking is a process where the iOS software and device firmware that Apple ships is modified to allow unauthorized/unsigned code to run. \nUnlocking means that you can use a GSM iPhone with any GSM carrier, not locked to one carrier in exchange for a discount or an exclusive sales agreement.\nJailbreaking is the first step needed to unlock a phone. Jailbreaking allows additional root access to the device and allows for other app store mechanisms to load apps and code onto the phone.\nSome utilities, like redsn0w, will automatically unlock certain models of iPhone in addition to jailbreaking. \nApple has sold authorized unlocked phones in several markets worldwide.\nAs of June 2011, Apple will sell unlocked GSM phones in addition to the locked to Verizon and AT&T models. Some carriers will unlock an iPhone once your contract is up. There is a lot of confusion in the US on this point due to conflicting law of software licenses and Library of Congress exemptions that permit users to modify their phones for the express purpose of unlocking them when not bound by a contract to one carrier.\n\nA: Ambiguity of “Unlocked Phone”:\nBootloader Unlock aka Jailbreak Vs. Network Carrier Unlock\nBootloader Unlock = Jailbreak\nJailbreaking or bootloader unlocking allows you to gain root privileges and install custom firmware. Do not unlock the bootloader if you are wanting to disable the carrier subsidy lock. \nNetwork Carrier Subsidy Unlock\nThe ability to use the phone on any carrier, Do not unlock the bootloader if you are wanting to disable the carrier subsidy lock. Jailbreaking and unlocking are not the same thing. You can call a carrier to get a Master Subsidy Lock, also known as MSL. With that number in-hand, you can go about unlocking your device or (phones manufactured from February 2015 onward), MSL will be replaced with the DSU (Domestic SIM Unlockable) system, allowing carriers to unlock devices over the air.\n", "Q: Centering slide window in keynote I'm editing a keynote and i would like to center the slide I am editing in the middle of the window, simply for editing.

I mean are all VPN connections (specially the Cisco VPN client) designed to work the same way..i.e. they always require 3 inputs; Host, UserId, Pwd\nOR that depends from one connection to the other?\n\nA: The VPN is a function of the specific version of iOS and not very well documented in the user guide. The information needed to establish a connection is more a function of the configuration on the VPN server and less about how the iPad data gets entered (except the details must match for the VPN to work)\nA better resource is the iPhone configuration utility (more of a total iOS configuration tool) and enterprise deployment guide that goes into much more detail on what VPN protocols and settings can be used with iPad. They have step by step guides on setting up a VPN or having iOS devices join existing VPN. \nhttp://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/\n", "Q: Pages document saved in MS Word format is not well-formatted? I use pages but most of my friends/clients don't. If I save a Pages document in MS Word format and send it over to them, most of them see it all garbled.\nEven when I open the doc file in Pages, it is messed up (text over graphics and so on). So to fix this, I open the doc in Pages, fix every thing and save it again (which is a very cumbersome process)\nIs there any setting which we can use to ensure this doesn't happen?\nThanks\n\nA: It's difficult to answer your question without more concrete examples of \"all garbled.\" But the answer is probably \"no, there's no one setting to make everything work out the way you want.\"\nSince the two programs are very different, it's challenging to get a one-to-one correspondence of document formats when you export out of Pages to .doc format.\nIn general, my advice is that your exported .doc files will look closer to your Pages documents if you use Pages' Word Processing mode, rather than its Page Layout mode.\nMixing images with text, especially in a page layout fashion (with text wrapped around images and the like), is especially problematic, since the .doc format isn't as well suited as Pages for that sort of thing.\nIf you want your associates to see just what you are creating, you are probably better off to send them a PDF from Pages than to try to use .doc format. If they need to make changes/edits/comments to your work, I would suggest that you send them the initial text (without inline images) in RTF, then incorporate their changes into your Pages document by hand, then produce your final document in Pages and end up as PDF.\n", "Q: Can I Save Open Dialog Windows Size and Filesystem Location? Sometimes I have to upload, attach, open, insert, multiple files into various programs and websites.  Often I have to do many in a row.  Every time I \"Browse\" to add a file, OSX or Finder takes me back to its default location and the window defaults back to this little square that I have to then widen and navigate back to the directory I was just in, every time.  Can OSX be told to always use the last file location and window size for an Open dialog, no matter what program is being used?\n\nA: That functionality is how the Finder works at present. Sizes made to a dialog in an app should be saved across open actions (but the window position isn't saved as this window gets drawn to be centered and a bit below the active window.) Changes to the underlying window are supposed to affect the open dialog.\nAre you using safari or some other program to \"browse\"?\nHave you looked at software like DefaultFolderX to add better tracking of the recent folders? I don't know if it will help with the sizing, but it has been doing the default folder trick for ages and ages and is very stable and well supported. \nLastly, do check how the Apple apps like Safari, TextEdit and Pages work. Many third party applications don't implement file open / file save / file choose according to the user interface guidelines. Much of this is fairly technical but documented at developer.apple.com in the Human Interface Guidelines. See the open and choose discussion here if you want to know how this happens in code.\nIn a nutshell - OSX does save folder and size while a program is running but not generally saved after the speficic application is quit. A programmer can make their program do anything - so even if OSX wants to go to the last folder, if the program says to always open the home folder you will need a plug in like DefaultFolder or that program to change.\n", "Q: Is there a way I can share a disk image as a remote DVD drive? I would like to upgrade one of my laptops to Snow Leopard but the DVD drive doesn't work.\nSo can I share a disk image to use it with Remote Mac OS X Install tool?\n\nA: If you can manage a cheap 8GB USB flash drive, try read these links\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.maciverse.com/install-os-x-snow-leopard-from-usb-flash-drive.html\n\n*http://osxdaily.com/2009/09/02/install-snow-leopard-from-external-firewire-or-usb-hard-drive-or-how-to-upgrade-to-106-without-a-dvd-drive/\n\nA: Sure - all macs support network boot. You might look at Deploy Studio for help in setting up a server that can network boot images stored on the remote machine. Borrowing a USB drive or another mac in target mode with a working DVD might be faster - but with a little set up - network booting is very doable.\n", "Q: 2008/9 Mac Pro wont turn on, front pannel LED is constant white My mac pro doesn't want to start up.  \nI purchased some new memory installed it (and cleaned up some of the dust on the inside of the box) and now the machine won't boot up.  I get a constant white LED on the front, no fans, no chimes, no other lights light up (RAM riser boards)?\nI have removed the new RAM and replaced it with the old, in an attempt to just get the machine to boot.  No luck.  \nSo now the box is back in its OEM state, but still wont boot.  I've tried the 15sec unplug / hold the power button down for 5 sec rest and  that didn't seem to work.\nAny idea what might be going on?\nI also swapped out a known working RAM riser from another box and still can't get it to boot up?\n\nA: Sadly, the most likely cause is that you zapped your system board. If you used a household vacuum cleaner to remove the dust, this is highly likely.\n\nA: I would take all the RAM out and see if it can tell the RAM is missing - you should get three beeps. If it can correctly tell no RAM at all is installed - proceed to try one stick at a time. If it fails with no RAM - start with the Express Lane or your hardware tech of choice since the logic board isn't working well enough to even see the RAM that you have installed.\nMost of the time, it's a bad stick of RAM or just needing you to re-seat the RAM, but update your question with the results of this test and the causes will be narrowed down from the several things that can cause this boot failure condition.\n\nA: Hold the power button and alt, then enter your wifi. Then now you loaded into Mac OS Recovery. click redownload OS X. Follow all the steps then ur done :)\n", "Q: Way to limit CPU speed to prevent temperature spikes? I have a 17 inch MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt.  Occasionally, it heats up and the fan has to kick on.  This happens typically during heavy CPU utilization, but also seemingly randomly when doing mundane tasks.\nIf I could half the speed of my CPU, it would still be more than fast enough for most of my day to day tasks.  Is there a way to reduce the CPU speed for the entire system?  Will this minimize the heat related issues and prevent the fan from kicking on?\n\nA: It's not practical, but that model of MacBook Pro will run the CPU lower if the battery is disconnected since it can't count on the battery to work as a capacitor and the CPU/GPU can over draw the power supply.\nAlso - you could try gfxCardStatus to shift to the lower power GPU to reduce that source of heat.\nIf you are still running Snow Leopard, there are some CHUD tools in the performance testing folder of Xcode that let you to disable cores on processors which would let the system get less work down and generate substantially less heat. I don't know of a program to do this on Lion as the latest Lion build of Xcode didn't ship with the CHUD tools.\n\nA: Yes there is. Check out CoolBook at www.coolbook.se! Good luck!\n\nA: You can try\n launchctl limit [some options]\n\nalthough that is more for individual jobs.\nI don't think that it will help.\nI tried renice(8)ing the flash plugin process a few times to stop it from revving up the fans, but I now suspect that it's writing something to the drive, which triggers spotlight ( mdworker )  I know that Chrome downloading the Safe Browsing dataset keeps my fans spinning... \nYou should not have to do that however. \n", "Q: How can I use my iPhone 3G economically in China?

I don't have much time and want something low on the 'things can go wrong' scale. Oh, and I have a dinosaur 3G, and a 4G.\n\nA: You can turn on airplane mode, but enable WiFi (Or you could get an iPad with only WiFi), then make calls through FaceTime, or Skype equivalent.\nImpossible that you could be charged, but you would have to be near a Wi-Fi source for it to be useful.\n\nA: Turn off Cellular Network, 3G and Data roaming.

Is it possible to set up a printer, so it will always print in black and white?\n\nA: @ughoavgfhw's answer is incomplete. Some applications (like Google Chrome) will not use the last used preset, but will use the default preset. In order to have such applications adhere to your default settings, you have to interact with the underlying printing system CUPS. These steps will get you there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run cupsctl WebInterface=yes using the Terminal application (only required once).\n\n*Browse to http://localhost:631/\n\n*Go to Printers\n\n*Select printer to modify\n\n*Choose Set Default Options from the second drop-down\n\n*Under Basic set Output color to Black (this step might be different for your printer)\n\n*Hit Set Default Options and presto!\n\n\n\n\n\nA: You can define a preset from the print dialog.

I was not able to use the iPhone because it was still bundled with a Canadian service provider and could not even go into the operating system. \nI called the service provider but they won't help me unlock because I've stopped the service. \nWhat can I do now?\n\nA: The programmer chpwn has created a web site where you can see if you can unlock your iPhone at http://caniunlock.com.

If iTunes does do this is there another way to get them added to my phone without compression?\n\nA: iTunes does indeed compress large images when syncing to the first-party Photos app on an iPhone or an iPad. It calls this process \"image optimization\" and it even gets its own progress bar when you sync your device.\nCurrently, the solution is to use some other third party image vieweing app. GoodReader, for example, can handle high resolution images, and there are many others.\n", "Q: Can I install mac mini and wireless keyboard/mouse without USB keyboard/mouse?

I am using latest macbook pro.\nAfter selecting the file using mouse I hit delete and then \"command and delete\" and none of them work.\nSo finally I hit ctrl + mouse click and then I chose \"Move to trash\".\nIs there a way to delete the file using only keyboard?\n\nA: command+delete works just fine. Highlight the file (single click or use your keyboard to select it), then hold command and without releasing it, push delete. This moves the file or folder to the trash.\nNote that delete is in the same place as Backspace on a Windows keyboard.\n\nA: The full procedure to delete a file from the desktop, without the mouse, that should work almost anywhere in OS X, includes the following.  \nCommand-Tab to switch applications until the Finder is the active application.\nIf any Finder windows are currently open, press Command-Shift-D to open a new window containing the Desktop folder, or Option-Command-W to close all active Finder windows and make the Finder's desktop active;\nTo highlight the icon, type the first few letters of the icon's name, or press the arrow keys until it is selected (highlighted);\nCommand-Delete to send the icon to the trash;\nOptionally, Command-Shift-Delete to empty the trash.\nLearning the keyboard shortcuts takes time, but many of the steps in the Finder can become natural, almost \"automatic\" with enough practice.\n(This answer gives the key names in U.S. English.  The Command key is also labeled ⌘; The Option key is also labeled ⌥; The Shift key is also labeled ⇧; and as mentioned by Styfle, the \"delete\" key is called \"Backspace\" on other operating systems.)\n\nA: I had an issue with command+delete not working to delete things on the desktop that looked like apps I had installed earlier. Turns out they weren't files, but instead mounted DMG files that needed to be ejected with ⌘+E.\n\nA: Just in case if someone uses external Microsoft Sculpt Ergo keyboard + Macbook Pro 2016. I'm able to move file to Trash with 'Win'+'backspace' keystroke. \n\nA: highlight, then SHIFT + DELETE; click ok\n\nA: TLDR: Use CTRL + d on Windows.\nIf you find yourself using Apple hardware in a Windows environment (like running Bootcamp on a MacBook Pro or just using an Apple keyboard in Windows), you may notice that delete is mapped to the Windows Backspace key which is never involved in deleting files.\nBut you can still send files to the recycle bin with CTRL + d.\n", "Q: How can protect all privacy from someone that needs to use my Mac? A friend of mine is going to stay here for two days, and I am sure he will need to ask me to use the Mac (and PC) in the study room.  (which will be tons of work to move them and no matter where they are moved, the friend for sure will ask for use of a computer).\nIn such case, what is the best way to protect my privacy, so that he won't be able to look at my Documents folder, Photos folder, etc, and all of my Firefox, Chrome, Safari's History, Bookmarks, and Stored Passwords?\nI can create a temporary account, I think, and log in using that tmp account, but will that protect looking at my default user folders on hard disk, and also, the Safari / Firefox / Chrome etc were installed so that they can be used by all users, so do I also need to remove all those History, Bookmarks, Stored Passwords, on each browser?  (and it is not good to remove the bookmarks and stored passwords because I may need them later).\nIs there a better way?\n\nA: Just make sure your admin account has a good password that isn't written down anywhere (or add some numbers you will remember to your usual password.)\nFrom there, you can make a guest account for them - as long as it isn't an admin user - they can't grant themselves access to your files.\nIf anything is truly sensitive - don't let them near the mac. It's easy to boot any mac from an install disk and access your files since my operating system won't care what your password was. Your guests would only need time, a little knowledge and curiosity (or worse) to have access to anything that isn't otherwise encrypted on your Mac. You can (should?) make encrypted disk images to store any sensitive information that you wish to protect from someone that would access your mac against your wishes.\nSee this article for an explanation. Even if you store your password in your keychain (less secure) - a technician can't see the contents of the folder unless they crack your password (or your keychain/log in password). It will just be scrambled bits.\n\nA: I enable the Guest Account in System Preferences, then go to the login screen when someone else wants to use the computer.  That way they get a totally clean user with none of my personal settings, and anything they do is wiped from the system when they log out.  It's super handy.\n\nA: If you want really 99.999% security, the only way is to encrypt your data. (Because in the worst case, it's possible to open your Mac, take off the HDD, and read it in another computer).\nTo enable encryption, you can use FileVault:\nSystem Preferences > Security > FileVault\nSee: Use FileVault to encrypt the startup disk on your Mac\nPs:\nHonestly, I never tried it. Maybe someone can post more about it.\n\nA: If you enable Open Firmware in addition to using the Guest account option, you basically you would need to start disassembling the Mac to get at the information.\nbmike is correct in saying with an install disk or single user mode you can reset the password, but if you have a Guest account with Open Firmware you are going to be pretty safe. BE CAREFUL HOWEVER: Apple does not support Open Firmware and it can be a pain if you forget the password. \nFrom Apple's article:\nFeatures of Open Firmware Password Protection Intel-based Mac computers\n\n\n*\n\n*Blocks the ability to use the \"C\" key to start up from an optical disc.   \n\n*Blocks the ability to use the \"D\" key to start up from the Diagnostic volume of the Install DVD.\n\n*Blocks the ability to use the \"N\" key to start up from a NetBoot server.\nBlocks the ability to use the \"T\" key to start up in Target Disk Mode (on computers that offer this feature).\n\n*Blocks the ability to start up in Verbose mode by pressing the Command-V key combination during startup.\n\n*Block the ability to start up a system in Single-user mode by pressing the Command-S key combination during startup.\n\n*Blocks a reset of Parameter RAM (PRAM) by pressing the Command-Option-P-R key combination during startup.\n\n*Requires the password to enter commands after starting up in Open Firmware, which is done by pressing the Command-Option-O-F key combination during startup. \n\n*Blocks the ability to start up in Safe Boot mode by pressing the Shift key during startup.\nRequires the password to use the Startup Manager, accessed by pressing the Option key during startup\n\n\nA: Short Term:\nIf all you want is to protect your browsing history and some personal photos from prying eves/accidental bumping for a couple of days (or weeks) all you need is a new user, without admin privileges.\nJust make sure that all your personal data is in your home folder (UserName/Documents, UserName/Pictures etc). Anything outside, and especially in the Public or Shared folders are, well, open public (most of the times)\nAll your browser cache/history/bookmarks are also stored per user.\nSo creating a new user should satisfy all your requirements in the short term.\nI assume your friend isn't going to come with a OSX in stall disk, or another mac (or PC) and some cables to remove the hard disk and connect it to them.\nLong term:\nAs almost all others have said, Encryption is the only foolproof way to save data. File Vault (System Preferences - > Security) can help. You can also create encrypted disk images (Applications -> Utilities -> Disk Utility)\n", "Q: Recommended way to back up a Macbook before upgrading its OS? I'm planning on upgrading a friend's Macbook from OS X Leopard to OS X Snow Leopard. I think it's a good idea to backup all the data before upgrading the OS, in case something goes wrong. The problem is that the important data is not clearly stored in a single location — e.g. it may be scattered all throughout the system since my friend doesn't store all his data in one location, so it's very difficult to know which files/folders I should or shouldn't back up.\nIs there any recommended procedure I should follow or a built-in (preferred) or 3rd-party tool I should use to back up the data before an OS upgrade?\n\nA: Hard to answer, not because of technical difficulty - but psychology. ;) So I will take the answer a bit easy...\nA. The simple way\nMake a Time Machine backup (if you do 1st times will get a full backup) so you will be able to restore anything that you created on the Mac. For this, you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*one external HDD (big enough), connect it\n\n*go to System Preferences\n\n*use this external HDD as Backup disk for the Time Machine\n\n\nB. As A. but with a bootable Time Machine HDD\nFor this, you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*one external HDD (big enough)\n\n*your OS X install DVD\n\n*turn off Time Machine, if you have it on\n\n*connect HDD\n\n*insert install DVD\n\n*start /Applications/Utilities/DiskUtility.app\n\n*select your external HDD\n\n*go to \"Restore\" Tab\n\n*into \"Source field\", drag your Install DVD\n\n*into \"Destination\", drag your external HDD\n\n*triple check (so DON'T ERASE YOUR INTERNAL HDD!)\n\n*press Restore and go to have a lunch\n\n*after the restore, exit Disk Utility\n\n*eject Install DVD\n\n*go to System Preferences and enable Time machine\n\n*select your external HDD as BackupDrive\n\n*Make a full Time Machine backup\n\n\nWith the above, you get a BOOTABLE Time Machine HDD. When things go wrong, you can hold down Alt when your Mac is booting and select this HDD for BOOT and restore from it without needing the install DVD (faster restore).\nC. Want even more?\nMake working copies of your HDD. Like above, you will got a BOOTABLE external HDD, but not for install purpose, but for working from it. So, you can boot it and continue work as from your internal HDD.\nFor this you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*get a donationware: CarbonCopyCloner, or\n\n*make a normal install into external HDD, boot it, and use the MigrationAssistant.app to migrate data from the internal HDD to freshly installed external HDD\n\n\nDo you know that paranoia is the right state of the system administrator's mind?\nDo B and C - So you will need two external HDD's. It is the best, because you can drop your backup HDD from the table, and after this crash-test, the drive will be probably unusable (broken). :) Anyway, for this solution, you need to not crash-test both drives.\nWith this, you will be able to WORK immediately (from the external drive) and restore from the Time Machine (from the second external HDD).\nKnow Murphy?\n\n\n*\n\n*Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

I believe it is only when I click via the full \"press down\" method, it does not happen during a mere light-touch-to-click.\nSo you are using your trackpad, and you go to it to drag something, for instance, but you then find the darn contextual menu popping up on the thing instead!  Agh!\nI am guessing I may take it in for a regular exchange (ugh, it was bought on USA apple store online and I am in thailand now) ... but thought I would see how wide-spread or solvable it is.\n\nA: Do you have checked this in the SystemPreferences -> Trackpad?\n\nThat's mean, than when you do a full-click on the right(left) bottom corner thats mean right-click. For the disable, simple uncheck.\n\nA: To resurrect this thread - this was driving me crazy. I thought my MacBook trackpad was failing but I recently went back to using a Magic Trackpad and found the same problem there. What happens is I mostly single click with my thumb but if any of my other fingers touched the trackpad it would fire off a right click.\nI was hoping there was a solution where you could specify that the two contact points would have to be close to each other. I couldn't find anything like that.\nBut I did find MagicPrefs, which lets you customize gestures, taps, and clicks. What worked for me was to set the two-finger click to fire a right-click, and to set the applicable zone to the top 3/4 of the trackpad. This way thumb clicks, which are always at the bottom of the trackpad for me, didn't count as a double click and then fallover to a single click. \n\nA: I don't want to give up right clicking.  But I have had the same problem.  However I think it might be caused either by hitting too close to right click corner or one of my other fingers either accidentally touching the trackpad or perhaps being detectably close.  Try clearly pointing with one finger and the others withdrawn.  When doing this you seem to get a \"regular click\".  Working for me - try it. \n\nA: I sometimes scroll on my Macbook when I meant to drag.  In my case it's usually due to another finger touching the trackpad or palm pressure too close to it.\n\nA: I think the problem are the rubber of the magic trackpad. Try changing them.\n\nA: I have the same problem...  I can avoid it by arching my fingers and clicking with just the tips, but I find that unnatural and uncomfortable, since my fingers are not as flexible as they once were.  I think the trackpad sees my single click as a double click because the fingers contact it over a larger surface, and the pressure applied by the flat finger is probably not even.  It seems like something that the trackpad software should handle, but there is no way to adjust the sensitivity settings for clicks.\nThere is no fix other than changing the way your fingers move over the surface.\n", "Q: Do Macbooks with protective cases fit into the BookArc Desktop Stand?

I have concern regarding this behavior.\nWhen I use Time Machine as a standard user, it backs up everything (including data of users I do NOT even own). I realize that I still cannot access it, but how legit it is to allow me to backup everything on a system used by multiple users on an external hard drive and take it away with me?\n\nA: You need to be an admin user to turn on Time Machine or change the disk - if you are an admin user you can see all the data on the machine.\n\nA: As @mark pointed out, standard users cannot set up Time Machine and do many things needed to maintain a system. Therefore, all a standard user can do is copy files or install an application in the user folder to set up backups of the data that is readable by that user.\nI have only tested CrashPlan as an administrator, but I see no reason why you couldn't use that to get incremental backups over time of one user folder (or a subset of that folder). You can install applications in your folder as a normal non-admin user.\nBy making a standard user - the admin is responsible for letting you do anything that is in your scope and in this case - Time Machine was allowed for you by virtue of making your account, so that's why you get to start that process.\nThe fact that you have access to the backup media has nothing to do with software or permissions. If you choose to take that data, you can simply do that without any concern for how the system is set up or designed.\n", "Q: Replace cracked iOS app with purchased app without losing data I've done jailbreak a few weeks ago to try some new apps and games before buying them.\nToday I've updated my iPod touch to a new version and I've purchased some apps I liked. To sync iPod touch with new app I have deleted the previously cracked app and then I realized that all data associated to that app was lost. \nI don't want to loose data from other apps. How can I re-install with purchased version of the same app without loosing data?\n\nA: If you don't want to wait for an update, there's an easy fix. First install and open up iFile from Cydia. Navigate to /var/mobile/Applications/, tap the gear in the bottom-left corner and make sure \"Application Names\" is set to On, and then find the app you want to update and/or buy inside that folder. In the app's folder, there will be a file called iTunesMetadata.plist; delete it. Now go to the App Store. Search for the app, and you'll notice that the App Store thinks it's not installed on your device. Click the \"Buy App\" button and purchase the app. It won't overwrite any of your saved data from the app, and you'll have legally purchased it. This will also work for any apps that you want to reinstall without losing their saved data.\n\nA: Wait until there is an update, then install it. A notification will come up saying that you haven't bought a previous version of the app, and it will ask you if you want to buy it now. Say yes.

This is usually where developers store their data and you can copy anything from there out onto the desktop then copy it back in when you've installed your kosher version.\n\nA: Before removing applications from my iPod touch I backup all information with iTunes, then have removed all cracked apps and synced with iTunes.

Around a month ago I noticed the machine is constantly freezing all the time for a fraction of a second, it's really regular and barely noticeable in general use. It's more obvious when scrolling down a long page in Safari (5.0.5) but really noticeable when playing YouTube clips, there's constant pauses. The odd thing is that video played by VLC (1.1.9) is totally smooth. I'm thinking it might be a Flash (10.3 r181) thing as it seems Safari-bound.\nI can provide any diag information if anyone would like to help me out (ps -a, top etc. just ask). Thanks in advance.\n\nA: EXACTLY that symptoms had my friend, he noticed it mostly in Excel an in the gaming - random freezing, first about a half second, later (1-2 months) became worse between 0,5-30 sec. \nIt was a HW problem. He bring his notebook to apple service, something (don't remember what) got changed and everything is OK now.\n\nA: I had the same problem. It was the motherboard. Check the serial, Apple did replace (for free) a whole bunch of boards because of a failure.\n\nA: Strange as it may sound, it could be the SSD. I have an OCZ Vertex 2 in my MacBookPro7,1 (2010 13\") and I discovered that something in iStat Menus was causing disk I/O to stop for a few seconds every now and then. This would manifest itself not by completely freezing the system, but things like when launching apps the icon would bounce and bounce until the I/O resumed, and Chrome would refuse to open new tabs. I got around this by disabling the CPU and sensors widgets in iStat and I haven't had any problems, but there could be a similar app on your system that is causing the problem.\n", "Q: Recommended carrying bag for macbook pro 15.4\" What are some recommended carrying cases for MBP 15.4\" \n\nA: BrentHaven makes amazing cases.  I used a backpack of theirs for four years of school for my MacBook Pro (the first Intel one they released), and it performed admirably.  Superb protection.\n", "Q: Numbers: divide in a column I have a price list:\n12,560\n14,340\n11,890\n...  \nIs there a simple way to divide these cells by a number at once?\n\nA: The \"spreadsheet\" way to do this is to do the division in another column.\nLets say your data is column A, starts a row 1 and goes to row 10 (that's A1:A10 in spreadsheet reference language).\nIn a unused column, row 1, you could enter:\n=A1/10\n\nAnd the copy and paste that formula from row 2 down to rows 2 through 10 in that column. Numbers will automatically increment the A1 reference in the pasted cells.\nThe divisor (10 in this case) can also be a reference if you like. Just make it a fixed reference so it doesn't automatically increment as you copy and paste. Lets say B1 holds the value you want to divide everything in column A by. You'd use:\n=A1/$B$1\n\nas the formula and copy and paste. The $ in front of the column name and row number tell Numbers not to auto-adjust those values as you paste the formula around to different cells.\nHere is an example Numbers '09 file.\nColumn A is data\nColumn B is A divided by 10\nColumn C is A divided by whatever value is in E2, change E2 and you'll see the values in Column C change.\n", "Q: Sync errors between iCal and Google Calendars For the most part iCal and Google Calendars via CalDAV just work for me. But irregularly, throughout the day, iCal will start bouncing in my dock and display a warning like the following:\n\nWhat I know about the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*It happens randomly. I can hit Refresh All in iCal and this sync error won't occur.\n\n*The account with the error can change. It's not always a problem with the same account. I keep three Google calendars in sync with on iCal instance.\n\n*It happens randomly throughout the course of a day. I can't predict when a sync will fail with this error.\n\n*It does happen at all hours. I've had the pop-up show up at 9 am, and 9 pm and even 3 am.\n\n*I've been unable to tell if the error results in an out-of-sync state between iCal and Google Calendar. That's what makes me nervous.\n\n\nHow can I make these sync errors go away for good?\n\nA: This is a common error. The iCal auto setup has created an incorrect address for you. There should be no \"slash\" / at the end of the address i.e. it should be\n/calendar/dav/youremail@domain.com/user\nTo fix it, go to Preferences / Accounts and change the address, removing the final / from the Server Path setting.\nAFAIK Lion no longer has this bug.\n\nA: On visiting the URL mentioned with my email address, I get:\n\nMethod Not Allowed\nError 405\n\nSo maybe Google changed something on their servers which prevented iCal from syncing. Try looking through Google's blog to see if any changes have been made, and how to fix it. \nAd@m\n\nA: A similar error tends to happen to me when I have recently switched wireless networks or my computer first comes out of sleep and I have iCal already loaded, but it hasn't reconnected to the wireless network.\nHave you noticed any correlation to your internet connectivity and the issue?\nSo far, I haven't noticed any sync errors and I just hit OK.\nIn the iCal prefs under Accounts, what do you have with your Refresh calendars interval?  Have you tried messing around with that?  Perhaps changing it to every 30 minutes or every hour might help.\n\nA: I've had this experience myself and have been using iCal with Google Calendar for several months now. Perhaps you are adding events too quickly. I found that these steps helped in resolving my issues:\nFirstly, I'd suggest backing up all of your calendars. To do this just log into the Google Calendar site with your username and password. Once logged in, access the settings tab in the left column and go to the 'calendars' pane. Once you're there, there should be an \"Export Calendars\" link somewhere on that page. Click on this link.\nYour calendars should all appear in a folder within the Downloads folder automatically (if using Safari). Once you definitely know that this is complete, remove all of your calendars on the Google Calendar settings page (DON'T UNSUBSCRIBE!). Once they are gone, then re-import them to the online Google Calendar Settings page using the \"Import Calendars\" link.\nYou will most likely have to set up iCal again, particularly if you have multiple calendars which appear as delegates.\n", "Q: What services/apps can cause my iPod to be remotely wiped? I've learned that simply by adding an Exchange-based email account to my iPod's Mail app, I am implicitly allowing the administrator of the email system to remotely wipe all data from my iPod -- even though neither the (sparse) documentation nor the user interface seems to warn of this.\nI don't find this acceptable, so I simply read my Exchange mail through the web interface.  No problem.\nAre there other apps or services which implicitly allow other people to remotely wipe my iPod?  For example, if I add a Gmail account to the Mail app, am I granting the ability for a Google action (intentional or otherwise) to wipe my iPod?  If I use the Facebook app, does Facebook have the ability to wipe my iPod?\n\nA: The remote wipe is part of Apple's own code - so any program that wants access to that API has to work with Apple to ensure it follows Apple's policies of not surprising end users.\nThis feature is well documented in the enterprise documentation as well as part of MobileMe Find My iPhone terms of service.\nThe things that currently will wipe an iOS4 device: (the first two depend on physical posession of the device - the second two require some sort of data connection to the Apple (or Exchange) servers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore the device over USB (in recovery mode if a passcode prevents normal restore)\n\n*Turn on the failed passcode erase trigger and enter the code wrongly until the erase threshold is passed\n\n*Turn on Find My Phone and activate an erase through another device using Apple's push data servers.\n\n*Turn on Exchange remote wipe and activate it through the Exchange server's push data service.\n\n\nI don't know of any apps that have hacked this interface. Ones in the App store would likely get caught before they shipped. Ones in cydia or jailbreak community might be more prevalent, but I'm not familiar enough to say if there are any in the wild so I'll leave that for someone else to answer here via an edit or in another answer.\n", "Q: Apple Magic mouse problem I am having one problem with the Magic mouse; after 3-4 hours of continuos use, the Magic mouse automatically loses connection with my Macbook pro.\nDo you have any idea? Why is it happening?\nIs it a defect? Should I go for replacement?\n\nA: The issues you're describing very common, along with many reasons why; fortunately there are some workarounds that might help.\nThe first reason you could be losing connectivity is because many macs have improper antenna configurations for the Airport and Bluetooth modules. This causes the signal to either be extremely weak, or just flaky in general. It get's progressively worse if the batteries on your mouse are starting to run low - much worse! Another reason is the Mouse itself having an aluminum battery cover that shields the bluetooth inside of it from having a decent connection.\n[Here are a few ways that might help resolve some of the issues] \nFor starters take off the bottom battery cover and see if you have better responsiveness and connectivity. It works for me, although I have one of the macs with a backward antenna configs, so without doing that I basically have no connectivity. Another surprising fix is to download BTT (Better Touch Tool). I was very skepitcal about a third-party app helping remedy the situation, although I must admit that it helped tremendously. I'm not sure what mechanism the developer used to revive my mouse, but he's helped countless thousands I'm sure. If those two work-arounds don't do anything the last thing you can try is to re-wire your bluetooth antennna to hopefully make things work again.\nThe Magic Mouse has been plagued with these issues from day one, and besides getting another mouse that does the same exact thing there's not much else you can do. Oddly enough, the replacement that I got actually squeeks like mouse, and is worse than it's predecessor, which I'm currently wondering how to troubleshoot. Take a look at the article I've linked below; they might have a few other fixes that I might not have covered. \nLink: The Not So Magic Mouse \n\nA: This is way too late to help the poster, but it might help others who look. I've found that my mouse has a tendency to lose connectivity. Even a simple tap against the edge of a mousepad or any hard object like my keyboard will knock it out when the mouse is feeling touchy. It can be especially bad if the batteries are weak. The fix is simple though.\nClean the contacts on the batteries, as well as the mouse itself. Some rubbing alcohol on a cotton Q-tip seems to do the trick, and no more mouse problems for at least 6 months.\n\nA: Battery connection problem. It's a design fault imo. Try wrapping a paper around the batteries like he describes here.\nTwo approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Place a piece of paper on top of the batteries, roughly centered. Tuck any excess paper around the edge of the batteries. Close the hatch.\n\n*Place a small piece of alu foil on the negative terminal on the batteries.\n\n\nThe first wedges the batteries more sturdly in place and the second adds more area for the contacts.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Time Machine with Airport Express + USB External Drive? I'm wondering if it's possible to connect an external USB drive to my Airport Express and then run Time Machine backups onto that? A bit like a makeshift Time Capsule.\n\nA: No - airport express doesn't share drives, just printers.\n", "Q: Where can I find a replacement screen for my 13\" MBP? I have purchased Macbook Pro 13 inch, and it was shipped by DHL, but when I received it, the screen was damaged. So, I want to buy a new one.\nWhere I can find it? Because I want to buy and install it.\n\nA: You should contact the company you bought it from, they should replace the Macbook Pro for you. If for some crazy reason they won't, contact DHL and see if there was insurance on the package, you might be able to get it replaced by them.\n\nA: I always look on ebay for spare parts.  Screens can be found there between $30 & $500, depending on model & housing needs.\niFixIt.com can also be a resource, but I didn't see any screens for MBPs when I looked a minute ago.\n", "Q: Is there a way to configure Mac OS X Snow Leopard server as an Internet gateway with bandwidth tracking per user? I'd like to use Mac OS X 10.6.7 Snow Leopard Server as an Internet gateway.  My router would connect to the Internet facing NIC on my Mac Mini server and the internal NIC would connect to a WiFi access point.\nI want to be able to track the bandwidth users on the WiFi network are using, but I am aware of the fact that MAC addresses on wireless clients are easily changed.\nHow can I do bandwidth accounting based on WiFi clients without MAC addresses, logons each time and having the Internet gateway server act as a DHCP server ?\nUPDATE - It appears I want to run RADIUS for WiFi auth and usage accounting...is this available in server/daemon form for Mac OS X 10.6.x Snow Leopard Server ?\nThanks,\nScott\n\nA: There's a RADIUS server in OS X Server, and it can easily be used for Wi-Fi authentication.\nHowever, traffic accounting is a different thing here. Mac OS X uses Freeradius, which can collect this information, but it is unconfigurable through Server Admin. So, you'll have to set up this by editing proper configuration files manually. \n", "Q: How do i enter my numeric password in iPhone 4 in VoiceOver mode? My iPhone 4 is in VoiceOver mode. It`s currently locked and not accepting my passcode which is absolutely correct. And now it's saying iPhone is disabled.\nAny solution?\n\nA: Try triple tapping the home button. \nIf that fails you, it might be more involved to rescue the device. \nEither connect the iOS device to iTunes and disable voiceover or learn enough of the voiceover interface to get to settings and change them on the device. \nFor many people, VoiceOver is not at all intuitive at first go and really optimized for people that learn how to use it. This learning is an effort unlike the normal iOS interface that toddlers can get with no real training needed. I would say learning VoiceOver is like learning to ride a bike - not hard, but easier if you have someone guiding you or you practice on soft ground while learning and falling.\nTips on using VoiceOver\nThe touch interface is totally different in VoiceOver. First you have to tap once to select the number, then you double tap anywhere on the screen to select the spoken element.\nIf your password was 1228, you would:\n\n\n*\n\n*tap once on 1, then double tap anywhere on the screen to enter 1\n\n*tap once on 2, then double tap twice anywhere on the screen to enter 2 twice\n\n*tap once on 8, then double tap anywhere in the screen to enter 8\n\n\nTips on disabling VoiceOver from iTunes\nIn iTunes you select summary and click Universal Access, then choose either Zoom or Neither rather than VoiceOver.\n\n\n\nA: I had the exact same problem.  After an hour of searching, the answer was so simple it made me laugh; tripple tap the home button.  \n", "Q: Is there a way to pickup iPhone calls on my Macbook Pro? I have my iPhone headset plugged into my Macbook Pro so that I can listen to some proper music and have my Iphone 4 lying next to my MB Pro.\nNow, of course, it would be really really fancy if there was a way I could proxy my incoming iPhone calls to my MB Pro via Bluetooth (essentially turning my MB Pro into a bluetooth headset) so that I can still pick up calls with my iPhone headset, even though it is plugged into my MB Pro.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: This is a feature apple brought with the lastest OS X : OS X Yosemite. \nOS X Yosemite is still a beta and will be released publicly in fall 2014. \n\nA: As of June 2011, BluePhoneElite was providing this feature, supporting a great range of mobile phones, but it became abandonware! :(\nTheir website is suggesting Phone Amego as an alternative. It may worth to check it out.\n", "Q: Deleting iTunes App Store purchases from my account So... Over the period of 2 years owning my beloved iPhone 3GS, I have found many useful apps that I use very frequently. However, in the process of finding these apps, I have also downloaded much, much more crappy apps.\nWith the introduction of the \"Purchased\" section on the App Store, many of the hundreds of apps I downloaded (mostly crappy) have popped up again. The apps are an eyesore and clutter up the whole space. Is there a way for me to delete them (from my account) forever, or at least hide them?\n\nA: Sorry but there is no way, at this time, to remove purchased (include free) apps on iTunes AppStore. Same problem with the Mac AppStore.\nI've already asked for this feature at iTunes Feedbacks, and you can do the same to make Apple understand what we want.\nThe ability to hide purchases from the iOS app store should cover most real-life situations where you would normally delete a past purchase. It also protects those who have lost control of their accounts and someone maliciously deletes past purchases. The idea that the past is unchangeable, but we wish to hide some items from prominence works for many.\n\nA: iTunes 10.5 is now released and contains this feature.  Go to iTunes Store > Purchased > Apps and then you can click the X to Hide purchases.\nNote that there is still a new section \"Hidden Purchases\" where you can view the ones you've hidden (and the ability to unhide them.)\nThere is no capability to actually delete a past purchase, just to hide them from view.\n\nA: you can hide any purchased items. Instructions for OS X 10.01/iOS 8/iTunes 12 (though similar to the previous versions).\nIn the Mac App Store:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Purchases\n\n*Rclick on the app you want to hide \n\n*choose \"Hide Purchase\"\n\n\nIn the iTunes store on your iOS Device, slide from right to left and choose hide.\nIn the iTunes store in iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Apps section of iTunes\n\n*Click \"App Store\" (last item)\n\n*Click \"Purchased\" (on right, near account info)\n\n*Find app you want to hide and click the \"x\" in upper left of icon\n\n*When asked if you want to hide the purchase, click \"Hide\"\n\n\nA: No, but customer feedback certainly drove this feature and more feedback might bring about the filtering you desire.\nI would use recommendations more if I could select some downloads to ignore.\nControl over filtering out purchased items from the re-download list would make that feature so much more useful.\nControl is always nice, but once one has 300 apps on iTunes and have deleted 100 after never using them again, the list can have a large portion of duds as it stands. \n\nA: According to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5772 (How to delete content you've downloaded from the iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store, or Mac App Store, Last Modified: May 13, 2014)\nApps\niPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap and hold the app you want to delete.\n\n*The apps will begin to jiggle.\n\n*Tap the X on the app.\n\n\nMac or PC\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*From the Library pop-up menu, choose Apps.\n\n*Click the app you want to delete.\n\n*Press Delete on your keyboard.\n\n", "Q: How to retrieve current wattage info on OS X? Is there a way to retrieve the current watt usage info on OS X Snow Leopard? I'm using mid-2010 iMac, so I'm not looking for just battery-related apps.\nDoes OS X even monitor power usage? Do I need to use an external reader between the power cord and the outlet?\nI'm most interested in command-line/applescript based solutions for more convenient logging & stats, but I'm open for alternatives.\n\nBoth (@bmike's & @michaelmichael's) answers are undoubtedly correct. The meta–question in here was that is there any sensors/readers already on the PSU, that would work kind of like the way \"kill-a-watt\" works. I sense the answer for that is \"no\".\nI know, it probably is just a wet dream, but a watt meter on board would be ideal for the computer to shout: \"Look how eco-friendly I am; using just these watts!\"\n\nAh!\n@Kerri Shotts' suggested iStat Menus 3 do get the wattage readings from some sensor, along with volt and amp stats. So the meters are there, but how I could access them programmatically?\n\nBounty! Will be given for solid command-line sensor reading solution or for recommending exceptionally good 3rd party software (like one with statistical and historical data tools at minimum).\nJust to inform: the aforementioned iStat Menus 3 lists the following power related sensors:\n\n*\n\n*Voltage Sensors (Volts)\n\n*\n\n*AC/DC\n\n*AC/DC\n\n*AC/DC Shunt\n\n*CPU\n\n*CPU 1.8V S0\n\n*CPU CTT\n\n*Graphics Module\n\n*Memory\n\n\n\n*Current Sensors (Amps)\n\n*\n\n*AC/DC\n\n*CPU\n\n*CPU VTT\n\n*Graphics Module\n\n\n\n*Power Sensors (Watts)\n\n*\n\n*AC/DC\n\n*CPU\n\n*Graphics Module\n\n\n\nIt does state \"sensors\", but they might be calculated as @msanford commented. How can I get my hands on that data programmatically?\n\nA: All of the data in iStat is just from keys in the ioregistry. You can pull a dump of it from the command line using ioreg:\nioreg -w 0 -l\n\nThat is going to be a lot of data to look through, you can carve it up in various ways. I do not believe the actual data you want is provided on iMac, the system monitors temperature in a number of places, but since it does not run on a battery it is less important to know the instantaneous current being pulled by the system, and thus probably not worth the cost of a sensor.\n\nA: There is a paid application called Hardware Monitor that provides access to pretty much every sensor available on a mac including voltage, current and wattage which I believe you are looking for. It does include a command line utility to read this information. \nI used this to track down a faulty logicboard in an iMac last year and found it worth the €7. It includes the ability to output the sensor values to a CSV which can be helpful for logging and visual display of the data. I'm not sure if it does PSU readings (as I don't have the app on the machine I'm on atm) but it hits pci, slots, cpu and lots of other. \nYou can find the software here : http://www.bresink.com/osx/HardwareMonitor.html \nI'm not associated with this company at all, just found the tool to be very useful in my diagnostics arsenal. \n\nA: IANAEE (I am not an Electrical Engineer), but as I understand it's not possible to accurately measure a computer's power consumption via software.

It's possible to get a calculation and with some calibration, it might even be pretty accurate. \nIn reality since that data isn't exposed or recorded, you might have to measure externally. Decent home energy counters are between $150 and $300 w\nYou could rent or buy a unit that measures the power through the outlet and then run some test to see how much power the mac takes over an hour in certain conditions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Off\n\n*Sleep\n\n*Idle\n\n*Various CPU loads\n\n*Maximum CPU, everything going\n\n\nThen you could correlate these with CPU usage monitoring that is trivial over time using top and be able to add things up.\nIt all depends on what you really want to do with the data other than learn how the hardware works and have some cool graphs.\n\nA: system_profiler SPPowerDataType seems to provide the most relevant information. On laptops it reports voltage and amperage which can give you the power consumption (mVolts × mAmperes × 10^-6 = Watts). It also reports Wattage, but that's actually a piece of metadata reported by Apple's power adapter, third-party power adapters can show blanks here. Since desktops do not have rechargeable batteries, there's no way to calculate power consumption by measuring charging and discharging of battery.\nBut wait, there's still hope! Apple publishes a lot of source code, and googling for Wattage or Power+mV hints that certain kernel extensions can be queried about power consumption. Unfortunately, I cannot come up with a working script right now, but it seems possible.\n\nA: system_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep Wattage\n\nDoes the trick for me on MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016)!\n\nA: // Build with: gcc psudata.cc -o psudata -framework IOKit\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <IOKit/IOKitLib.h>\n\ntypedef struct {\n  uint32_t key;\n  char ignored[24];\n  uint32_t size;\n  char ignored2[10];\n  char cmd;\n  char ignored3[5];\n  float val;\n  char ignored4[28];\n} smc_t;\n\nint main(void) {\n  mach_port_t mp;\n  CFMutableDictionaryRef d;\n  io_iterator_t it;\n  io_object_t svc;\n  io_connect_t ioc;\n  smc_t req, resp;\n  size_t sz = sizeof(resp);\n  uint32_t vk  = ('V' << 24) + ('D' << 16) + ('0' << 8) + 'R';\n  uint32_t ik  = ('I' << 24) + ('D' << 16) + ('0' << 8) + 'R';\n  float v, i;\n\n  IOMasterPort(MACH_PORT_NULL, &mp);\n  d = IOServiceMatching(\"AppleSMC\");\n  IOServiceGetMatchingServices(mp, d, &it);\n  svc = IOIteratorNext(it);\n  IOObjectRelease(it);\n  IOServiceOpen(svc, mach_task_self(), 0, &ioc);\n  IOObjectRelease(svc);\n  memset(&req, 0, sizeof(smc_t));\n  memset(&resp, 0, sizeof(smc_t));\n  req.cmd = 5;\n  req.size = 4;\n  req.key = vk;\n  IOConnectCallStructMethod(ioc, 2, &req, sizeof(req), &resp, &sz);\n  v = resp.val;\n  req.key = ik;\n  IOConnectCallStructMethod(ioc, 2, &req, sizeof(req), &resp, &sz);\n  i = resp.val;\n  IOServiceClose(ioc);\n\n  printf(\"%fV %fA %fW\\n\", v, i, v*i);\n  return 0;\n}\n\n\nA: This doesn't satisfy the command-line requirements, but give a try to iStat Menus 3. It gives you readings on just about every sensor in your machine (which for me includes AC/DC Watts, CPU Watts, and GPU Watts). I'm sure it isn't 100% accurate, but it was more than accurate enough in tuning my machine to work within the limited constraints of my APC battery.\nAll that said, my machine is a 2010 iMac, so depending on your machine, it may or may not work. In addition, I don't see power readings specifically for the HDD (which should be minimal), or anything specific to the display (that said, reducing LCD brightness reduces the wattage quite a bit, so it is counted in total).\nWorth a try at least. IIRC there is a free version, but it was so worth it that I went ahead and paid for it. I'm a bit of a control freak, so I have memory, temperature, disk activity, network activity, etc., in my menubar and love it. :-)\n\nA: Here's an ioreg command that prints most of the power information without 'grep'.

I would like to use my built in webcam on my MacBook as a remote security cam (really, I'd just like to be able to check in on our dog at home while we are away, security being a secondary concern) and be able to view it on my iPhone and potentially on my work PC as well. Although, if it was just working for the iPhone that would be plenty enough.\nIs there any software/apps out there that will do that currently?\n\nA: Sure, there are lots of applications that allow you to remotely view a feed from any camera connected to a Mac, including the built-in camera: EvoCam, RemoteSight, SecuritySpy, or if you're handy with command-line tools, iSightCapture.\nMost of these products stream the feed from the camera to a web server, which you can then view on your iPhone or work computer.\n", "Q: iCal sending decline e-mails when it purges old calendar entries I have iCal version 4.0.4.

There is no easy way to delete the notification or temporarily ask mail to not send mail before the purge happens.\nJust wait until Mobile Me changes again and all your old accepted invitations get an email that you are again accepting their past invitations. ;-)\n", "Q: How to sync all Gmail with iPod touch? I entered my Gmail info in the Mail app on my iPod touch, and I can now read my email on my iPod.  That's great as far as it goes, but I want to sync all of my email to my iPod.\nRight now, it only seems to load a couple hundred messages, plus any that I specifically choose to read - which I suppose is good for minimizing bandwidth usage, but the whole point of syncing email to my iPod is so I can read messages when I have no network at all.\nIs there a button or setting to sync all email that I just haven't found yet?  Or one of those cryptic unlabeled icons?\n\nA: If you add your Google account as an Exchange account you can theoretically sync an unlimited amount of Email on your device. To do this, follow the instructions at Google to use Google Sync with Gmail (http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=138740) and after that change the option \"Mail Days to Sync\" to \"No Limit\". The Option \"Show XX Recent Messages\" will be ignored (this is actually intended behavior, see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2723).\n\nA: I don't think the iOS has an option to keep all email from an account. I believe the maximum is 200 messages.\n", "Q: Safari can't connect to the server \"localhost\" Okay, I am a beginner with all this, so don't expect me know much.

Is it possible to route calls from the iPhone through the external speakers and mic (with or without bluetooth)? Put another way, is it possible to use my MacBook Pro, external speakers and microphone as a speakerphone for the iPhone?\n\nA: There are several bluetooth solutions, that should be useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Phone Amego ($29) - This should do the trick. Works and has interesting features. I recommend it.\n\n*BluePhoneElite 2 - No longer developed and supported.

I would like to lend my iPod Touch 4 sometimes, but I would like to block access to my e-mails (as well as Facebook), is there a way?\n\nA: Delete your mail account and log out of facebook?\n\nA: there is no way to \"hide\" your email account or facebook settings with the default OS (i dont know about jailbroken)\nthe only way you can cover this is as Lyken says, remove the email account from your phone and logout from facebook\nwhat you could do, is restore the ipod to factory default (after syncing to make a backup) lend the device, then when you get it back, you could restore the phone again this time from your saved backup from before\n\nA: If you jailbreak it you can use Lockdown Pro. I locked all my apps except games which my little brother uses all the time.

I can't believe it isn't there.\n\nA: If you tagged them correctly using the \"Total Tracks\" tag, then they should all be \"Track 1 of 1\".\nAnother option might be something along the lines of \"Album contains 'Single of the Week'\", but that does not cover any single tracks you bought.\nOther than that there is no way to do it except manually.\n", "Q: Sequential LiveFont display with different text sizes in Motion I'm making some text-based animations in Motion, using LiveFonts to emulate handwriting. I want the individual letters to appear one after the other, so I set the \"sequence\" value in the inspector to 100%. This works great.\nThe problem occurs when I try to mix text of different sizes in the same text object. For example, say I have something like this:\n\nWhen I run the animation, the big text and the small text start animating simultaneously, instead of in sequence from left to right. Here is what it looks like in the middle of the animation:\n\nI haven't been able to figure out how to fix this, after tinkering around for some hours, but I am a Motion n00b so I'm probably missing something obvious.\nFor the time being, I've been using a workaround of making separate text boxes for when I need to use different font sizes, but there is a lot of formatted text in this animation and placing all the text boxes just so and getting everything perfect in the timeline has proven quite tedious.\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: After some more tinkering, I found that I could get it to work by selecting the different sections of text and adjusting the \"Hold First\" attribute in the Format inspector. This is still a little tedious, but not nearly as bad as making multiple text boxes.\n", "Q: Remap \"Home\" and \"End\" to beginning and end of line Most of my computing time is spent in Linux (with occasional time in Windows). On these platforms the Home and End keys universally jump to the beginning or end of the current line.\nI am gradually getting used to using the one Apple computer in my life, but it is still frustrating than these keys seem to be bound to the beginning and end of the document and there doesn't seem to be any key at all for the line based actions.\nMy question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there existing keybindings I'm missing for beginning and end of line? (I mostly use a Terminal, Chrome and LibreOffice)\n\n*Is there a way to rebind the functions of these keys to the functions I am familiar with?

Using moveToBeginningOfLine and moveToEndOfLine, like @Lri does, may cause inconsistent behaviour.\nThere are whole bunch of other differences between the Apple shortcuts and literally everybody else's shortcuts that I added. For example, ControlLeft and ControlRight are supposed to move between words; not AltLeft and AltLeft. I don't think this is exhaustive, but it's working pretty well for me right now.

Google Chrome and Slack are two that don't seem to respect the DefaultKeyBinding.dict file.\nTo fix the remaining apps, I used BetterTouchTool (legacy) / BetterTouchTool (current) to create app-specific keyboard shortcuts binding Home and End to OS X's native shortcuts Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E.

E.g. changing the page up / page down keys so the cursor also follows on page up / down.  \nJust download the addon, and in the System Preferences panel, browse to the For PC Users section, and check Use PC Style Home /End.  \nNote, I picked (Change Home to Command+Left) instead of (Change Home to Control+A), as if I picked the first, and if the line was wrapped, home would take me to the beginning of the wrapped line, several lines above, instead of taking me to the beginning of the current line.\n\n\nA: I accomplished this using Karabiner Elements.  \nYou need to update the rules section of ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json with the JSON array from code below.

An excellent solution for customizing the workings of your input devices!\n", "Q: Why iPhone apps on iPad are scaled in Pixel Double mode instead of iPhone 4 Hi-Res mode? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy does the iPad use nearest-neighbour scaling rather than Retina scaling for iPhone apps \n\niPad runs iPhone apps too. Sometimes people want to make it bigger and they click the \"2x\" button. Then the OS scales the app with pixel Doubling, which makes it look ugly because the whole app is pixelated. \nNow that iPhone apps can be rendered at doubled DPI on an iPhone 4 with crystal clear quality, why doesn't Apple use this mode to display iPhone apps in 2x on an iPad? Is there a consideration other than time constraint?\n\nA: It is likely to encourage developers to write native iPad apps instead of just relying on the higher resolution of retina artwork. \n", "Q: Spy apps for iPhone 4 / jailbreaking without notice My friend is in a rocky marriage, and has had a lot of money removed from her bank account using a forged signature.\nHer husband has changed his behaviour lately, including spending much more time with his personal grooming etc.  She's really worried he may be cheating on her, and responsible for the missing money.\nI've done a google search and found this spy app.  It says the phone needs to be jailbroken.\nIf her husband's phone is not jailbroken yet, will jailbreaking it be evident to him?  Do you have any other recommendations for spy apps on iPhone?\nThanks.\n\nA: Jailbreaking will install Cydia on the iPhone, which isn't very easy to remove. A jailbreak may also cause general instability of the device, unusual behavior of apps, increased memory load, security problems (especially if the root password is left unchanged) and other problems. The device will change - even just subtle, but enough for someone used to the standard behavior to notice.\nOn a side note, I don't think that installing spyware on other people's devices is good idea. It may even be illegal, depending on your jurisdiction. A marriage counselor may be a better idea.\n\nA: When you jailbreak, Cydia will be installed. Since you want it to be unnoticed, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak using your favourite jailbreak tool\n\n*The jailbreak tool may install Cydia, or a loader to install Cydia. make sure you install it first.\n\n*Install the app through Cydia\n\n*Install SBSettings (and it's related packages)\n\n*Go to the settings of SBSettings (swipe the status bar) and select Hide Icons. Find Cydia and the jailbreak-related apps and hide them. It will respring the iPhone when you are done.\n\n\nThere will be an option under Settings (the iOS one) for Activator, which helps with the launching of SBSettings. I strongly recommend that you leave it there, but it is noticeable. \nLastly, it may be illegal, depending where you are, to install such software.\n", "Q: Using Airport Express connected via Ethernet to extend Airport Extreme wireless lan? I was wondering whether it's possible to use an Airport Express that is connected via Ethernet (using a powerlan/-line bridge-set inbetween) to extend an Airport Extreme network?\nBasically the two places are a tad too far away from each other so connecting the Express to the Extreme via WLan hardly works reliably & I thought I read somewhere that the lan connected method should work, but after going through the Airport Utility Wizard that actually seems to offer this method & it restarted the Express, my Lan stops working.. for some reason.. heavy packet loss from my mac to the Extreme (via ethernet aswell) and all that... if I unplug the express from lan, it all of a sudden works again perfectly fine.\nSo basically the question is and if its doable, what do I have to do to make this work?\n\nA: what you want to do is setup your express to be a \"bridge\" for your airport extreme network, you want to create a \"new\" wireless network (but if you use the same settings as your extreme, most macs should seamlessly work and switch as required)\nmake sure your airport express is configured not to do any NAT or give out IP's as that is maybe what is conflicting with your network currently, also make sure you give it an IP in the same subnet as your airport extreme and also that it does not conflict with any other machines\n\nA: So apple says to just set the same network name (but different device name), and password for all devices, and put them all in bridge mode.\nThis seems to work, but it doesn't.\nI have a 4th generation time capsule and an airport express 802.11g (2007 model), and although I can connect to both networks when I am in range, the connection is interrupted when I am listening to a radio stream, while walking from one to the other.\nNote that the networks overlap, there is no gap with no reception from either, when I tried this.\nQuite frustrating.\n\nA: you're creating a network loop, that's why it starts freaking out.\nstupid Airport Express can't extend wireless network by connecting to backbone network via Ethernet. If you choose \"extend wireless network\"... on Airport that you want as an extender, it takes the signal from nearest Airport, not from Ethernet. You can connect client PC to this Ethernet and it would get a connection from air.\nBecause you connect Ethernet to a backbone, instead of a client machine, it creates a loop (wire connection to backbone from other airpot - extending connection through air - putting it back through a wire)\n\nA: In my experience the only reliable way to set up a combination of Airport Extreme + any number of Expresses to extend the network was not to use \"let this Express extend Airport network\" feature. Instead, configure each Express to create network of its own with the same SSID, only making sure that they are 5-6 channels apart and use the same security/password.\n\nA: I have successfully used an AirPort Express 802.11n (2nd Generation) to extend the network of an AirPort Time Capsule (4th generation) using Airport Utility 6.3. It didn't quite work the first time I tried it though: I had to do the configuration over wired Ethernet, from the Time Capsule.\nDoing it this way, the Airport Utility will detect what's going on, and will suggest extending a network over ethernet.  You do not need to change or configure anything apart from the name of the Airport Express device itself.  (The device, not the network name--the network is shared with the Time Capsule.)\n(In my particular configuration, the Airport Express and Time Capsule are connected via a Powerline device (devolo dLAN 500 AVmini), so I can report that this configuration works as well.)\n\nA: Was searching for this specific issue and the best answer is on the Apple Support site -- https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202056\nI chose the roaming option.\n\nA: If you're using Airport Utility 6.x, you'll need this answer here (it worked for me):\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5244532?tstart=0\n", "Q: FaceTime: Connect Mac to iPhone I just bought my first Mac, and I want to use FaceTime with someone who has an iPhone.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: FaceTime is a US $1 app on the App Store. You will need to enter an AppleID into the app to send or receive calls, but the software holds your hand through this process, making a new AppleID if needed for you.\nOnce you have that installed and running, make sure your contact's iPhone is in the address book and dial them up.\nYou can call out to AppleID that are used on the Mac and iPod/iPad and you call to a \"phone number\" to iPhones that are in WiFi.\nThe nice easy support page for FaceTime on the mac is http://www.apple.com/support/mac/facetime/\nA short list of hardware requirements is here. \n", "Q: Scanning over ethernet, natively in OS X? Yesterday, I purchased an HP LaserJet M1212NF.\nIt, like many other printers, can't scan over ethernet natively in OS X.\nThat is, I can scan using the stupid HP utilities that I hate (not going to happen), but I can't do it from Preview, Image Capture, or the \"scan\" button that's supposed to show up on the right-hand side of the pane after double-clicking the printer in the print & scan control panel.\nThis is a problem for me because part of my workflow is to scan documents using 3rd party apps in order to immediately organize, tag and file them.  But these apps rely on OS X recognizing the scanner, which it isn't.\nDoes anyone have any experience hacking the drivers, or otherwise making OS X behave in the way that I expect?\n\nA: Harv,  This is not the answer you want to hear.  I went with the Brother printer/scanner models because it was clear that the HP drivers that they supply to Apple often do not support network scanning (there may be a few exceptions).  The Brother drivers do.\nThe other recommendation I have seen is to use the drivers that come with the OS, not the installable ones.  In some cases, it seems that the scan works when the installables are not present.\nAlso, if the printer has SMB sharing, that sometimes needs to be turned on (usually only available on the higher end models with hard drives).\n~Hilton\n", "Q: How to show a list of processes that are launched upon a login? There are some processes that are launched upon a login, how to get a list of these processes?\nI want to prevent some processes from being launched automatically. \n\nA: launchd and the Login Items pane of Accounts preferences are the two places that normally start a process when you log in.\nIf you don't see the item in System Preferences -> Accounts -> specific account ->  Login Items then you will have to look into launchd.\nBasically the LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons folders in ~/Library\nLastly, if they are not there, then it's a system level launchd task that you might want to use launchctl to show or look in /Library instead of the user level library.\nMost people just have to manage the preference pane. Here is a snap of mine showing the Activity Monitor selected and ready to be deleted if I press the – button.\n\n\nA: You need to investigate launchctl(1) because there are a couple of contexts you will need to account for .\nThe easiest way is to look at the plist files in:\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons # System Context. Faceless. root lives here.\n/System/Library/LaunchAgents  # Loginwindow, or Aqua, where you live, context\n/Library/LaunchDaemons\n/Library/LaunchAgents\n~/Library/LaunchDaemons\n~/Library/LaunchAgents\nIn the file you will see the default state of that daemon or agent.  That is a sure way to tell if it is running at boot.  \nI mention the above degrading, foolish and time consuming method, because it is good to see all the stuff running.  They claim the resources used are low for a loaded yet dormant daemon, but since 95%+ of them are set to RunOnDemand... to me that's running.\nDon't actually do that for real though. There is a much easier way. \nRemember\nWhen you log in and open Terminal/iTerm, you are in Aqua context.\nLoginwindow context is when you see the login window, unsurprisingly, and a ton of things run off that.\nIf you\nsudo zsh  # why not be comfortable?\n\nor some other method to get a root shell, the root user will be in System context, which is the context that all the daemons in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons run in. \nI mention all this because the tool provided:\nman 1 launchctl\n\nhas a verb, \nlaunchctl list\n\nwhich you might think from the man page, lists all the running services.  You might feel it plausible, to switch to root, to get a higher level view of what runs when you login.\nSadly, each user sees his own context. \nlaunchctl managername \n\nwill tell you what it is.  \nFor root, its System.\nFrom my nifty hidden admin user, it's Background, which is the same thing you get by typing \n>console\n\ninto the username box for login\nYou can use the verb\nlaunchctl bslist  \n\nWhich tells you what services are active, for you.  It's different for _spotlight, for the hidden admin, for root, for macports etc.\nAnswer\nThe command to see the whole tree, is \nsudo launchctl bstree [-j]  \nwhatever you see when you run that after booting is what is running system wide.  For your identity:\nlaunchctl bslist \n\n", "Q: How to install Windows 7 on Mac mini server? Previously I installed Windows 7 on a Macbook Air without problems using Boot Camp Assistant and the excellent directions here.\nNow I am trying to install Windows 7 on a Mac mini server and I encounter error with every approach I take. I already have a bootable USB disk with Windows 7 installer.\nFirst I tried to install Windows 7 directly booting the installer. Installer refused to continue displaying an error mentioning something about GPT drive.\nSecond I tried to install using Boot Camp, but it does not exist on Mac mini servers!\nSo I copied the Boot Camp Assistant app from Macbook Air, and selected the option \"Download the Windows Support software for this mac\". It was not able to find and download anything.\nI thought I could handle the driver issues later, I used Boot Camp Assistant to make the 500 GB harddisk Windows installable. Then I booted into the installer, selected BOOTCAMP partition and formatted it. Installer did not continue displaying 0x80300024        error.\nI run out of ideas and am rather frustrated. Are there any simple instructions on how to install Windows 7 on Mac mini server? Or how can I solve my problem and install?\n\nA: Boot Camp requires a $29 Snow Leopard OS X DVD (not the server DVD) and an external drive. The MacBook Air SuperDrive works excellently with no driver hassle.\nSorry I don't have a list of drivers and steps to make up for the work done on the OS X since I'm a wimp and will pay good money to save an hour or two my time. Apple only bundles the Windows Drivers for it's hardware with the client version of OS X (AFAIK)\nI hope if someone else has done the hard work, they post their experience. The official Apple solution is simple and works well.\n\nA: I was able to figure it out.  First I tried installing Windows 7 via USB thumb drive however that didn't work. So I purchased an Apple USB SuperDrive and used my Window 7 Home Premium DVD and Boot Camp Assistant to accomplish the task.\n\nA: finally I did it. all I did I run win7 installation by using DVD player not by USB. All you need is a Boot Camp, Apple's DVD player and Win7 DVD.\nI did it after 6 months of trying by googling.\n", "Q: Can the iPhone play Quicktime VR files? Couldn't find anything anywhere.

On my Mac and PC I could setup a separate profile to use my color printer in black&white mode. Is it possible to do the same when using air print from iphone/ipad?\n\nA: The built-in AirPrint doesn't allow this sort of functionality as of iOS 4, but if you get the HP ePrint app, you should be able to do B&W printing and manage other settings. This of course only works if you have an AirPrint/ePrint HP printer, it won't work with any other printer that you've hacked to set up with AirPrint.\n\nA: Printopia for Mac will let you configure what settings the printer will use when you AirPrint. For example, you can select to use B&W only.\n", "Q: Remote access to PowerPC Leopard Server I have a PowerMac G4 at my office running Leopard Server that I'd like to be able to access remotely. Normally, I'd just use VNC / SSH, but it's behind a router that I don't have admin access over (it's in the office next door and we're in a piggybacking agreement, I just don't feel like asking him to forward ports, etc). I think \"Back To My Mac\" generally can take care of this, but it's going away and you can't subscribe to MobileMe anymore anyhow.\nIs there any software out there that can either UPnP it's way around this situation or somehow create an outbound connection? I suppose it being a PowerPC throws a wrench into the plan also.\n\nA: Try PortMap -- it's free, universal binary (PPC and Intel), and supports a variety of routers.  Just have it map ports 22 (SSH) and 5900 (VNC).  Note: I'd recommend  using nonstandard public ports, to cut down on the number of password-guessing scans you'll get, and also making sure you don't have any accounts with easy-to-guess passwords (because you'll still get a few scans, no matter how creative you are with port numbers).\n\nA: I've been using LogMeIn.com for all my remote Mac access. Works amazingly well. Totally free for basic use. No router or firewall changes are necessary.\nPiko\n", "Q: Which Trans Music Manager equivalents exist for OS X?

Free and open-source software is preferred, but paid-for alternatives would be considered.\n\nA: I haven't personally tried it, but AudioSlicer may be a good candidate\n\nAudioSlicer is a Cocoa GUI application\n  for Mac OS X that finds all silences\n  in an audio file and allows you to\n  split it into several smaller audio\n  files and to name/tag them properly.\n\nDoesn't seem to do the Gracenote tag fetching, but you could use Jaikoz (tag from MusicBrainz db) or SimpleTagger (tag from Amazon db) for that.\n\nA: Open in QuickTime Player and save as iPhone.\n", "Q: Lion - automatic file versioning - details Can anybody explain some details about how is implemented the automatic file versioning in the Lion?\n\n\n*\n\n*It is transparent for any file? (for example, for files created in the Terminal.app with shell command like ls >file.txt and ls -l > file.txt mean than the file.txt got versioning?, or\n\n*every application should call some versioning API at the save?\n\n\nA: The only information has released to non-Mac Developer Program members is the following.\n\nIf you have a document-based application, Lion offers an efficient, built-in auto save feature that stores changes to the working document instead of creating additional copies on a disk. Versions automatically records a history of changes made to your documents and lets your app display a Time Machine like interface so users can browse through previous versions. ADC\n\nThere is more information available for Mac Developer Program subscribers. The information, however, is currently restricted by a non-disclosure agreement . The information will most likely be made available for everyone once the final version of Lion is released. This is how Apple have done it in the past.\nPersonally I am a bit disappointed that Apple chose to go with ‘something else’ instead of the native handling of this offered by the ZFS file system.

Because I might just want to go to bed after this one song (but don't want to stop it midway – It's a classic).\n\nA: There's no command as such, but you can stop iTunes from playing after completing the current song by using the column browser to switch to any album other than the one of the current song. When the current song is done, iTunes will stop playing. \n\nA: No there is no command in iTunes but with Applescript you can add fuctionality. For iTunes and Applescript see Doug's Applescripts for iTunes and they have one to stop after the current track.\n\nA: There is no built-in option to do this, but there are several third party apps that are made for your situation.\nBerceuse ($2)\nThis one that does exactly what you asked (and more).\nBasically, it lets you set a number of tracks to play, amount of time, or entire playlist to play before performing a set action (shut down, sleep, pause, etc.).\nIf you're looking for a free version, there are two options that are timers only (set them to the length of your song to play just one more).\niTunes Sleep Timer (free)\nThis is an AppleScript that lets you very simply launch it and enter a number of second to continue playing for.\niTunes Timer (free)\nThis is a dashboard widget that lets you drag a slider to set the time to continue playing for.\n\nA: iTunes 11\nClick on the Up Next button and press clear.

I like to keep the lid down, and have it running almost all the time, 24/7.\nThere are several laptop stands and cooling pads out there, most of which I've seen the laptop is placed horizontally on. But there are some that hold the Macbook vertically.\nMy question is: Which is better to help cool the Macbook, a vertical or horizontal stand? Is it negligible?  \nIf it helps, say the Macbook is being used for something graphics intensive where it heats up quite a bit. My concern is that when the lid is down, and the heat can't escape as easily.\n\nA: Bookarc looks great, but closing the lid means thermal problems. It's not meant to be used that way, and under full load, this probably will lead to noise and overheating. I was planning to buy a stand (since I use my MacBook Pro with external monitor and keyboard), but inadequate cooling stops me, however keeping it open all the time accumulates dust.\nHere is my \"Reverse V\" method\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect all cables (video) and close the lid.\n\n*Wake from external mouse/keyboard. This will force using only the external display.\n\n*Open the lid to about 20-40 degrees. Internal display will remain off. The Macbook will be in a \"V\" like shape.\n\n*Put it on the desktop in reversed \"V\" form on something soft. I recommend old polyurethane mouse pad or shaped polystyrene.\n\n\n\n    /\\\\\n   /  \\\\     - MacBook\n  /    \\\\\n===========  - mat/soft mousepad\n\nPros\n\n\n*\n\n*Perfect cooling. Warm air gets up, there are no obstructions to the vents and all parts are exposed to colder air.\n\n*Cooler means less fan noise under load.\n\n*Takes less space than fully opened notebook.\n\n*Better bluetooth/wifi reception because lid is not fully closed (compared to fully closed one).\n\n*Less dust accumulation.\n\n\nCons\n\n\n*\n\n*You cannot use your internal IR receiver.\n\n*Some people will not be comfortable to run their HDDs from this position (10-20 degrees vertical inclination). I think it's perfectly safe.. and I have trustworthy backup system.\n\n*If computer sleeps, you should do the steps from 2-4 again or the internal display will be on.\n\n*Looks kinda strange compared to the great looking vertical stands available.\n\n\nA: If you close the lid on your MacBook and have a look at the black section on the back of your device you will notice a small gap on the lower end. \nThis gap is designed as the primary heat exhaust in clamshell mode. This is where the fans (which are running all the time, even when you don't hear them) blow the air out of the device. \nIf you add the fact that hot air travels up, it is quite obvious that the optimal way to position your device is vertically.\n\nA: According to this company, vertical is better.\nI use horizontal myself. I need the screen estate and the speaker (and occasionally the keyboard/trackpad when my bluetooth peripherals are out of battery). I'd say it's almost negligible. Aluminum is very good in dissipating heat.\n\nA: I think that in the absence of some kind of surprising physics formula, most of us would have roughly the same answer to that question. Namely, \"to get your answer, you would not necessarily consider vertical versus horizontal, but simply look at the stands and see which one allows the most air to circulate, unblocked, around the macbook.\"\nOne could guess that a truly vertical stand would only be blocking one of the thin edges of the macbook, while a horizontal one would block part of a large flat surface. if so, there you go...\nNote that I didn't even know you could keep the macbook running with the lid closed. I know that past mac laptops (that \"killer whale\" powerbook G3 I had so long ago) explicitly stated that the keyboard was one of the primary cooling elements, therefore there was no bypassing the automatic sleep-on-close.\nI own the Rain Design mStand, which holds it mostly horizontal, though angled. therefore it blocks part of the bottom.  Anyway, the macbook is pretty darn cool, but I'm not doing your \"close the lid while cranking the processor\" plan. BUT, I'd just say, the mStand looks pretty darn cool both when the mac is open and closed.\n\nA: Vertical exposes the most surface area and is best for convection moving the hot air away from the mac operating in clamshell mode.\nIn practice, a 5 or 10 degree tilt with a minimum of one inch clearance of air under the mac gets just as much airflow and cooling as vertical as long as the air temperature isn't too hot (<85 degrees).\nOn my four year old MacBook Pro - the internal temperatures and fan speeds are climbing and running it vertically rather than on a Griffin Elevator in clamshell mode. When my room temperature gets hot, vertical helps the fans stay at idle in clamshell mode.\nDo make or buy something secure to hold your mac and know that having the lid closed does insulate half of the surface area very well. Glass and trapped air is a very good insulator.\nAnd you can experiment with books or DIY and chart your mac's temperature using all sorts of programs. You can make the best noise, space, security, cost and temperature decision for your situation.\nAlso, 4 years and a few months down the road, we have custom cooling stands designed to help people with vertically oriented, cooling airflow for your MacBook operating in closed clamshell mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.svalt.com\n", "Q: Xcode problem with directory permissions I'm trying XCode4. I created a new project, told XCode to put in my ~/develop/ directory, but then I immediately get asked:\n\n“Test project” is locked for editing and you may not be able to save your\n  changes. Do you want to unlock it?\n“Test project” is currently locked\n  because you do not own the parent\n  folder and have no write permissions\n  for it.  \n[Don't Unlock]     [Unlock]\n\n...which isn't true: my ~/develop/ folder is owned by me (staff group) and has drwxr-xr-x permissions. I write to it every day. XCode is running as my account.\nIs XCode right? What can I do to fix this? If I press “Don't Unlock” it seems to work fine.\n\nA: If you navigate to that folder from Finder, you can click Get Info and manage the permissions from the bottom of the window. You can navigate there by using the Go To Folder menu item in Finder or directly navigating their.\n\nA: Launch Finder and right click on your folder and go to Get Info. After this process you can change the permission.\nIf you like Terminal for this job, this topic on StackOverflow will help you.\n\nA: After changing my home directory name Xcode gave the same warning on a project I was working on. The work around I used was to create a duplicate of the project.\n", "Q: User UUIDs on different Macs I have three Macs at the house and have the same user account setup on each of them. The users on two of the machines were initially set up using migration assistant to transfer user accounts.\nWhen accessing the Advanced Options menu under System Preferences > Accounts >  > Advanced Options, I notice that the UUIDs on each machine are different. The User ID and Group values are identical.\nQuestion: should the user UUID (different than UID) be set to the same on each of the computers? Any disadvantage if they are not? Does OS X use the uid (e.g. 501) to determine if the users on two different machines are the \"same\"?\n\nA: UUID means universally unique identifier. It sounds like the identifiers for the three accounts are unique. In other words, the system works.\n", "Q: Set Bitcoin.app to mount image before opening itself I have all the BitCoin data encrypted on an image on Dropbox. Is it possible to have a script that mounts the data right before I open the BitCoin.app ?\n\nA: No script needed. Store the app in the DMG. Keep the app (alias) in the Dock. Launching the app via the Dock will mount the DMG.\n", "Q: Sync photo without syncing apps Is there a way to sync photos in PC to iPad, without syncing the apps? I want to manage the apps only in iPad. The problem is that when I turn off apps syncing, iTunes asks me \"are you sure you want to remove 60 apps?\". I don't want to remove all my apps.\n\nA: iTunes will sync photos only if you turn on photo syncing in the \"tab\" for photos.\n\nIf iTunes is complaining about apps, it's likely that you once started to sync apps (or it got confused) - but it has nothing to do with app syncing. Sadly, if you want to use this iTunes library, you have to deal with the app issue or keep facing that alert.\nThink of it this way. Your photos are in a room that happens to have some rotten food. You can either move your photos to a new room or deal with the rotten food by holding your nose or cleaning it up. One didn't cause the other, but they just ended up in the same room as you.\n\nA: If you check \"manually manage music and videos\", the error doesn't appear (at least in my experience; YMMV).\n\nA: As Paul said, one way is to check the option for manually managing music and videos/photos etc, this makes sure that an iTunes sync will only sync apps, but requires you to drag/drop music onto the iPad and leaves your photos in place without any option to drag and drop them.\nYou do not say what OS you are using, but in XP & Vista at least you could try the Camera and Scanner Wizard to treat the iPad like a digital camera and give you export capability to take your photos off the iPad and onto the PC.  Depending on your setup you may have something like the Windows Live Scanner/Camera app instead.  If iTunes is setup to sync on connection, then these options never open automatically.  You can either hunt them down, or turn off automatic sync on connection to allow the OS to present options instead.\nThis doesn't allow you to upload though, so depending on your requirements (you say sync, but I'm not 100% sure if you really mean sync, or download) this may or may not be a suitable workaround.\n", "Q: What applications would be expected to setup a network interface \"stf0\" and \"gif0\" I've recently noticed that I have the following network interfaces setup on my mac:\nEthernet\nAirport\nFirewire\nvmnet1\nvmnet8\ngif0\nstf0\nObviously Ethernet, Airport, and Firewire are enabled by default.  I think vmware setup vmnet1 and vmnet8.  Where did gif0 and stf0 come from?  I'm sure I did not setup these interfaces myself, so now I'm getting paranoid about spyware.\nWhat applications might have automatically setup these interfaces? How do I disable networking through them?  Or is this a common setup and I shouldn't worry about it?\n/edit: gif0 appears to have the ip address 55.4.0.0 and stf0 appears to have the ip address 57.4.0.0.  Neither one of those is even remonetly similar to my actual ip address.  What's going on here?\n/edit 2: ifconfig reveals that neither interface has the flag \"up\" so they are not in use.  Thanks for the help jjungnickel.\n\nA: Those are Tunnel-Interfaces. They are commonly used to provide IPv6- or VPN-Services. They are usually always active, but not connected unless you set up your system to use them. \nYou can determine if an interface is enabled but not active by observing its flags using ifconfig <interfacename> to not contain UP. \nYou can look up the definition for those interfaces on the terminal with man gif or man stf, respectively.\n", "Q: Adobe Photoshop CS5 PC version running via boot camp I just bought my first MacBook Pro as I will be doing more work on the road, but I just realized my Windows license of Photoshop CS5 won't work on my Mac.  I guess it's OS-based?  Someone suggested installing Boot Camp or Parallels to run Windows via the Mac and use my Windows Photoshop CS5 license that way.\nAnyone ever tried this?  If not, I guess it'll be GIMP for me.\nThanks.\n\nA: Parallels is fantastic. You can either install Windows to a Bootcamp partition (so you have the option of booting straight into Windows), or just as a virtual machine. Either way, Parallels can then run in \"Coherence Mode\", which will allow Photoshop to appear on your Mac desktop as though it were a native application. I use Parallels for developing Windows software and for games, and the performance is brilliant.\nOf course, you could talk to Adobe about a crossgrade to the Mac version - if you don't already own Windows the cost may be comparable.\n", "Q: iPhone 3G blacks out and displays random static Last night the iPhone 3G (my friend's iPhone, not jail-broken) went black and a white fuzzy line would move around the screen.\nPowering off and starting again seemed to remove the problem.\nWe have not been able to reproduce the problem since yesterday. What hardware/software fault could be a likely cause for this?  So it would be possible to tell an Apple Genius next time it happens.\n\nA: It's the display connector cable inside the iPhone which can come a little loose. You can open it up and reseat the cable if it happens again. Ifixit.com have guides.\n", "Q: How can I combine multiple font files into one family? I have several font families that have different naming styles. The results is that instead of all those fonts showing up as one family, there's a separate family for each font variation (bold, black, thin, italic, etc).\nThis makes my font list messy. Is there a way to combine multiple font files into one family?\n\nA: If you're not afraid about command lines, I suggest you ttf2ttc. *.ttc files are TrueType fonts Collection\n", "Q: unexpected forced logout on iMac My iMac 24\" is about 3 years old.\nSpecs:\n2.66ghz Intel Core 2 Duo / 4gb RAM / OS X 10.6.7\nWhat happens is while I'm in the mid of using the machine, it suddenly goes back to the blue screen and then the login screen. So It's not a hard restart, more like a forced log out. This is the 3rd time it happened this week. It's never happened before. There was no warning, or slow down prior to the shut down. I also felt the top of the iMac to make sure it wasn't over-heating. It wasn't.\nWhat's causing this and what can I do about it? It's extremely annoying to lose work due to this unexpected behavior. \n\nA: The loginwindow process is responsible for logging you in and out - so if you don't get a chance to save your work, then that one process has crashed.\nLook for crash logs in the console app to confirm this. While you are there, perhaps look over the console and system.log files in the console application. You will have to take note of the times when the crashes happen and dig into the messages a bit.\nThey are noisy, and some errors are not - some harmless messages are very important. It's best to compare a good log out with a bad log out to see what changed (and get a feeling what messages are normal)\nYou could also punt and take it to someone that knows how to diagnose software issues, but it's clear that the login window process has quit and the mac is forced to kill all the other user level processes to attempt to stay running. This is by design and intended to get you to have it looked at since it is a serious software problem.\n", "Q: What are the Visor alternatives? Visor is a plugin for Terminal.app that allows usage of quake-console-style terminal access. Are there any alternatives to this Terminal.app plugin?\n\nA: Try TotalTerminal (http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/). It's by the author of Visor, but doesn't require SIMBL to function. And it works flawlessly on Lion.\n\nA: The hotkey window in iTerm2 works well for this, but with one catch - it only works if iterm2 is open (it doesn't have to be focused or in the foreground, but it must be running).\n\nA: For quickly executing simple commands, DTerm can be an excellent solution. It can execute simple, non-interactive commands without opening a terminal window, or you can press ⌘+↩ to have it execute the command in a Terminal/iTerm window.\nI think of DTerm as a sort of CLI app launcher, similar to common GUI app launchers like Alfred, Quicksilver, LaunchBar, or even Spotlight.\n\nA: Well, I always ask Alfred to give me the stuff I want, so my Hotkey would be\nalt + Space and then i this will invoke Alfred and select iTerm2\n\nIt's more than a keystroke, but Alfred gives me so much power :)\n", "Q: Where can you find out to whom a given Mac is registered? Is there a place in the OS that we can see to which person the OS is registered to?\n\n\nA: The registration information that you enter when you setup OS X is stored in a hidden plist file in the system. \nThat data is stored the file /var/db/.AppleSetupDone if you run the following command in terminal you should be able to see that information: \nsudo cat /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\nThis will show you the information entered. You will need to modify this information with a plist editor. For warranty claims Apple will know who registered the machine for AppleCare. \n\nA: I don't know whether the registration information is stored locally. If you call Apple, they can certainly tell you under which person the Mac is registered.  \n", "Q: How can I troubleshoot a WiFi setup that needs close proximity to function? My Macbook does not pick up wi-fi signals that my iPhone can pickup.\nI have an wi-fi setup at home and the router is in a room. Outside that room - or even in some corners, my Macbook Pro does not pickup wi-fi signal. But my iPhone can still use the wi-fi outside the apartment doors.\nOnce, I restarted my Macbook Pro while holding Command+P+M (or something like that). It had to do with the PRAM. That is the only hack I tried which I didn't know the full extent of its damages or capablities. Does this affect networking with Airport?\nHow do I fix this? \nEDIT: Maximum RSSI averages -39. This is when I place my router on my keyboard.\n\nA: Since there are a lot of causes - let's try to narrow down some things.\nIf you are on Snow Leopard - you can get some more detail on the MacBook to know if there is interference or if there is potentially a hardware error.\nHold the option (or alt) key and press the WiFi icon in the menu (you'll have to add it if it's not in the menu for this testing.)\nAll the mac cares about is transmit rate - it's the best number to tell how much data your mac thinks it can send reliably to the router. The higher the rate, the better. A high transmit rate is all that matters - even if the signal is weak, you still have a good connection if you have a solid transmit rate.\nNext is RSSI - it's less intuitive. I tell people think of sunlight into the ocean. If you are -20 feet below the surface it's really light. RSSI of -100 is really dark / really faint signal. In ideal environment - no noise, good antennas on both mac and router and good amplifiers reading the singals - you can still operate at -100, but any interference or extra distance, you could stop getting a signal.\nDifferent macs have different RSSI - so if you have a close match in hardware you can be sure the problem is the mac by comparing with another. If not, it's more guesswork. Your iPhone WiFi antenna is likely 10 times as big as the Mac's antenna so it's looking more like a signal issue than anything else.\nI hope this helps you decide what next steps to take to find the cause. \nYou can change the router, change the physical location or change the hardware. If a repair shop is close, maybe try a diagnosis there. If not, you'll have to take the mac to other locations with that router and try changing the things you can control.\nIt's not likely software since moving the mac closer to the router doesn't change the software, but you might check for updates if some new firmware does better with interference or error handling. It's a long shot so I list it last.\nEDIT - I am home and can report some transmit rates. On my older equipment, transmit rates of 24 to 54 are seen on an old linksys 802.11b router. My MacBook Pro gets transmit rates of 200 to 300 pretty much all around the house. Even when I have one bar in the menu bar for airport signal strength, these transmit rates stay high as the RSSI goes to -90 (which is getting far away from the base station)\n\nA: \"Take it to the Genius Bar.\" You definitely have a hardware problem. Your antenna leads are either disconnected, or they were damaged when someone serviced your computer.\nWith your AP on your keyboard, you should be seeing an RSSI of -20 dBm or better. Decibels are a logarithmic scale, and every 3 dB is a doubling of power. So if you're 19 dBm short of the signal you should be seeing, that means you're seeing less than one thirty-second (1/32nd) of the power you should be seeing. That's consistent with disconnected antennas, or cut or shorted antenna leads.\n\nA: You can try entering the following into Terminal.app:\n    /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport\nwill show a long help, you probably want add the \"-I\" argument - showing info.\n", "Q: Window management app on mac os x? I currently use \"Stay,\" and have tried other tools (haven't really loved any of them), but I am looking for a window management tool that does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Store my window locations\n\n*Have a separate profile for different monitor setups\n\n*Allow me to quickly modify the location with hotkeys\n\n*Automatically load my default settings when I attach/detach a display\n\n\nAny help would be great!\n\nA: Moom\n\nDivvy\n\n\nA: I never used stay but I am using Moom (Apple store) and pretty happy with it. It stores windows positions and has configurable hotkeys. There is no automatic settings for different displays but since you can assign hotkeys to configuration is not a big issue.\nIt is very stable.\n\nA: I like Spectacle. It's super simple, just a few options, but they do the trick for me. I mostly just use left/right/upper/lower half and fullscreen (calling halves multiple times flips through several options).\n\nIf you use Homebrew-Cask, install by simply running:\nbrew cask install spectacle\n\n\nA: I prefer DoublePane.

It helped me so far. \nFinder was at 70-100% CPU time before; \"sudo fs_usage\" showed a lot of \"attrlist\" calls on various files, it looked like it is reindexing something. I left it for the whole night, but nothing changed. My version is that yesterday I have cleaned up a lot in my iTunes, deleted a lot of small files and that triggered recalculating in Finder. Just my guess. \n\nA: A short form would be opening terminal and executing:\ntop -ocpu\n\nThis will show you the processes running and list them by processor usage. You will see terminal/top pop up to the top on occasion while it is running. But this will give you an idea what it may be.\nTypical culprits:\nSpotlight indexing\nAddress Book/calendaring sync\nSome rogue process or browser plugin.\nSee if this helps the next time you see as system slowdown.\n\nA: this is ONLY the finder taking all the CPU time,  so none of those solutions will work... especially looking for the CPU hog, because the finder itself is the CPU hog when it goes rouge. (starting up and having no other apps or processes running except system processes,  and seeing that spotlight is not indexing, and timemachine is not backing up.)  \nwhat worked for me is to delete the com.apple.finder.plist file in the /(put your user name here)/library/preferences/ folder...  then restarting.  (most likely because something went wrong with moving a file around in some window or desktop,  like now some file is off screen or on a secondary screen but feels the need to be on the first screen)\nthis i am pretty sure is what the OP was experiencing too..  (also this problem will return if you open the offending window with some file in it that is rouge (off screen) or simply way too many files in the window)  \nif your desktop is cluttered with dozens of files,  this will also bring the problem around again.\n\nA: I had the 100% cpu usage issue at different times.

It's a free, open source drawing tool. It allows importing of .PDF files and can save to .PDF as well.\n\nA: Apple's built-in Preview application (free) alone sufficient to make small changes in PDF documents. When you double click on any PDF file, it opens, by default, in Preview. You can use Preview app to merge, split, mark up, annotate, and sign PDF files. Preview is the easiest solution to view, create and edit PDF documents on Mac. \nWith long documents or for complex editing tasks, third-party PDF editors like PDFPen or this one (cheap alternative to PDFPen) are the best bet.\n\nA: For simple tasks like fixing typos, OpenOffice (free, ~161MB) or LibreOffice (also free, ~272 MB) do the job.\nNote: there is a paid version of LibreOffice (called LibreOffice Vanilla), which is available from App Store:\n\nLibreOffice Vanilla is based directly on the LibreOffice source code from The Document Foundation. It is recommended for users who want the convenience of installing from the App Store and getting automatic updates, compared to manually downloading and installing from The Document Foundation.\n\n\nA: PDF creation is built into Mac OS X.\nOpen the app you want to create a PDF from and choose \"File > Print\" or \"Cmd+P\" and choose \"PDF > Save as PDF...\" from the dropdown in the bottom left of the panel.\nYou can then use the Preview app to rotate, crop, combine files, and more.\n\nA: I can't recommend any free solution since I don't use them, but want to second PDFPen as the best in class at any price. It looks like SamucoPDF is the least expensive app in the app store currently, but it has mixed reviews on the text editing.\nIf you really have more time than money, you might check out Stanza Desktop or Calibre both of which offer to accept PDF as input into file formats that are easier to edit with TextEdit or another editor you may have accessible. Once you've edited, you can print to pdf since the OS provides that to any app that can print.\n\nA: PDF Studio does allow to edit text content and will work for minor text edits such as changing a few words or lines, changing font, size, color... The PDF format was not designed for Word processing and content editing is very tricky. It is usually recommended to go back to the original file (Word, Excel, etc..), to work with it and save it back to PDF. If you don't have access to the original file and need to do a lot of editing, including text reflow, wrapping, etc... you should probably bite the bullet and pay for Adobe Acrobat. \n\nA: There's also PDF Buddy, an online PDF editor that's really easy to use. It's a great alternative if you're not happy with Preview- especially on Snow Leopard where the Preview app is very limited.\n(Disclosure: I'm a co-founder of PDF Buddy)\n\nA: The best solution is indeed, Preview... It's built into Mac OSX and is the easiest to use if you want to create/edit/view PDF files.\nThanks Apple for thinking this through! :)\n\nA: You can just use Apple's Preview application, built-in in Mac OS X.\nIf you need more advanced features, I recommend Skim.\n", "Q: What are some tactile iPad apps to show to a graphic designer? I'm looking for apps that have faux materials in them like leather, wood, paper, etc. (Apple stresses \"tactile\" apps when guiding developers.) I'm trying to guide a graphic designer. What are some apps that I can show that get the point across? \n\nA: Your question didn't specify free apps so here are a few paid apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manage - currently $2.99 in AUD. Has a faux leather look.\n\n*Corkulous - currently $4.99 in AUD. Simulates a corkboard complete with sticky-taped labels and sticky notes.\n\n*Ruler 2 - currently $0.99 in AUD. Looks like a wooden ruler.\n\n*ABC News - this one is free. It's not tactile, but the lead stories are presented wrapped around a globe.\n\n\nThere is a free app called Stylapps that is a showcase for stylish apps, though not specifically for apps that look like tactile materials.\n", "Q: Delete calendar event from iPhone I received an e-mail with an .ics attachment and I opened it on my iPhone. I opened the attachment and added it to my calendar. Now I want to delete the event. How do I do that?\nMore Details:\nWhen I open most entries in the Calendar app, they have an \"Edit\" button in the upper-right, and then a \"Delete Event\" button on the Edit screen. But not this Calendar entry.\nI'm guessing that I can sync to my Mac and delete it from there, but that's not a good option since\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm at work\n\n*I don't use my Mac very often\n\n*Deleting an entry from the calendar shouldn't require a 5 minute process\n\n\nUpdate: Not only am I unable to edit anything about the event, but I can't even change the Alert time. There must be some way to edit events received via .ics.\n\nA: Was it added to a calendar? Or as a calendar?\nGo into the Settings under Mail, Contacts, Calendars and see if it was added as a full calendar.\n\nA: I just solved it by connecting to iTunes, choosing my iPhone, then Info, checking it to sync calendar to the Mac not only iCloud. DISAPPEARED! You can uncheck not to sync to the Mac after that again!\n\nA: The only way that I can see is if you had your calendar set up as an exchange calendar. If you're using google calendar you can do it in the web view, but as far as a standard calendar goes, there's no way to remove the event because it's not yours. You can talk to the person that sent you the email and see if he/she can remove you from the attendees list in their calendar, but I can't think of a way for you to do this yourself. It's possible that this functionality will be added in iOS 5 but I can't find a mention of it.\n\nA: Thank you for describing the problem so well.  I believe this is a bug or at least a major annoyance.  I have the exact same issue.  When receiving an .ics file via email and clicking on it on iphone, the event is added to my calendar, but cannot be edited in any way.  I cannot add or change an alert, cannot change the time, cannot delete future events (for a recurring meeting).  Completely read-only.  At a local level (on my phone), it should be possible to make changes to the event, and that is why I consider this to be a bug.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and think I finally figured out how to fix it, as long as you're automatically syncing your calendar with iCloud:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into icloud.com on a web browser, with your iTunes account\n\n*Enter the Calendar app in icloud.com\n\n*Double click the calendar entry you want to delete\n\n*There should be a \"delete\" button by the bottom left corner of the window that pops up\n\n*Click the delete button (it will say that all attendees will be notified that the event has been canceled, but this shouldn't actually happen if you're not the event owner)\n\n*Any devices synced to that iCloud account should automatically remove that calendar entry\nThis worked for me, to remove an .ics entry imported from Facebook to my iPhone/iCloud calendar via email. (Deleting it from your calendar on Outlook or a Mac and then syncing would likely work as well.)\n", "Q: Is there a way to sleep your mac through iPhone/iPad? In the remote that comes with Apple TV, if you pair it with a mac, you'd be able to press and hold the play/pause button and your mac will go to sleep. Is there a way to do the same with iPhone/iPad Remote app?\n\nA: If you just need the sleep/wake function, you may want to take a look at iNet WOL, which does a great job. It's the little brother of iNet Pro, a much more extensive network tool for the iPhone.\n\nA: I use Screens and Prompt to manage my macs remotely (whether it's the couch or from afar).\nThe little command osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to sleep' can be mapped to a function key or alias in your shell and will sleep the mac no matter how it gets called.\nScreens: Using the mouse itself requires no setup or you could customize a gesture to activate a Function key that calls the script to automate things a bit.\n\nA: Yes, you can search different alternatives on the iTunes Store. I've used jfcontrol in the past with great success. Not the prettiest application, but it deliver. You need a small (very small) server installed on the machine (it's just a little app that runs on the Menu Bar). Pretty much all these apps need a small server. \n\nA: Not out of the box, but there might be an app for that. What I would recommend is simply installing a VNC app on both devices - something like TeamViewer or LogMeIn. Then, you can  use your iPhone to navigate the system menu like you normally would. \n", "Q: Software/utility to completely erase cookies/cache What software (or using any other in-built tools) can I use to clear (by clear, I mean scrub from the disk) the cache & cookies in browsers, without affecting the bookmarks etc. I use firefox 4.\nDoes deleting them from the browser and running disk util to write zeros on the free space do the trick? Also, this is a shared laptop, so not much chance of drastic steps.\n\nA: The easiest way is to use a free (or paid) utility to do it for you.\nOnyx is a free one that does the job, you have an option to clear your browser's different values: \n\nCocktail is a paid ($14.95) nice utility too, that does what Onyx does and the UI is a little bit more elegant and give you some more flexibility:\n\nOf course, you will have to make sure that you securely empty your thrash if you really want to make sure nobody has access to deleted stuff. \nCocktail has a nice option that may interest you in this regard:\n\n…which should cover your secure concerns :) \n(if OnyX has a secure delete, I couldn't find it in the preferences).\n\nA: I have used Cocktail for many years and I am quite happy with it. It has many other useful features.\n", "Q: Where can I find good tutorials for an OS X newbie? I am using Mac OSX Snow Leopard.\nNow, I am giving my MacBook to my younger brother, who is quite new to OS X and Unix. He is using Windows for thelast 8 months, and is quite familiar with it.\nI need your guidance in finding Video Tutorials, that I can give to him so he can learn on his own about different things.\nPlease suggest some video tutorials from any provider, be it Lynda or Total Training. Even ebooks and books titles are welcome.\n\nA: As a newer Mac user myself I can highly recommend Screencasts Online (ref.) http://www.screencastsonline.com produced by Don McAllister.\nYour initial subscription is for 3 months because you can download or view online the complete library of shows. The ongoing monthly subscription is very reasonable and you can stop and resume the subscription as the need arises.\nThe quality is very high both in terms of production value and content.  He produces a weekly episode with a mix of topics for both new users and fairly advanced enthusiasts.\nSome of the episodes are free with the rest being members only.  The free shows can be downloaded as an iTunes podcast (search for \"screencasts online free version\" in the iTunes store).  This will give you an indication of the content and quality of production.\nFor a reach over to the bookshelf, find a specific answer situation I recommend David Pogue's \"Mac OSX Snow Leopard\" from \"The Missing Manual\" series. (ref.) http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596153298.do.   He writes with clarity, thoroughness and humor. \n\nA: Apple has some great short videos on different aspects of using a mac and OS X including coming from windows, video, music, photos, web and iWork and its all over at their 'Find Out How' website. \nhttp://www.apple.com/findouthow/mac/\n\nA: Apple has an entire area on it's website dedicated to people switching from Windows to Mac.  \n", "Q: Get Instapaper to save blog comments with article I recently bought the highly respected Instapaper app for my iPhone.\nOne thing I have noticed is that if I save an article from (most) blogs such as Coding Horror, the comments to the article are not saved in the Instapaper version.\nWhile in many cases the comments are mindless noise, and I can understand why Instapaper would strip them, there are some blogs where the comments are very much part of the conversation and I'd love to see them, formatted nicely, in the Instapaper output.\nDoes anyone know an easy way to achieve this?\n\nA: Instapaper uses various filters to figure out what to strip from the page and which content to keep (Coding Horror configuration is here).\nMy only suggestion would to be to write a script which takes the content + comments, puts them into a new page wrapped in a div which has the class instapaper_body and saves that to Instapaper.\n\nA: As mentioned in the previous answer, Instapaper deliberately doesn't copy comments.  One solution would be to copy all the text, and email it to your Instapaper email address (which can be found by logging in, then looking here http://www.instapaper.com/extras - 3rd item down.\n", "Q: Best way to View Powerpoint Presentations on Ipad I'm not a big ipad user, but I need ot know how to view powerpoint presentations on an ipad. I have noticed alot of people mentioned to convert it to a video, pdf slides or image slides. But I have also noticed that KeyNote seems to do alot of the same stuff as powerpoint.\nIs KeyNote the best way and will it allow editing too? What drawbacks are there? What is your suggestion for powerpoint on ipad?\n\nA: If you are looking just to view, you can convert your slides to PDF and use iBooks.  If you also want editing capabilities, Keynote is indeed the best way to view and edit slideshows on the iPad. it carries the advantage of being tailored for your device. Keynote is Apple's version of PowerPoint, so it can edit and view slideshows. Just so you know, you won't achieve 100% compatibility with PowerPoint, but it will be pretty good. I use Keynote and I'm continually surprised by it's abilities and it's depth. I say, go with keynote. \n\nA: I think GoodReader (I believe it is $5.99) is great for storing and viewing not just PowerPoint presentations, but just about any type of file. It can open huge PDFs without crashing. \nBut make sure you get the iPad version, otherwise you can't view the app in full screen. \nOr, you can jailbreak your device and install SBSettings, lighttpd, lighttpd SBSettings Toggle and iFile from Cydia. Slide from left to right on your status bar (where the time is on your iPad) and press More, Toggles, then turn on the toggle called \"lighttpd\" and press your Home button. Now open iFile and use it to copy your presentations to /var/www. Open SBSettings and tap Lighttpd to turn off the server and save battery power. \nBut the only way to edit presentations that's worth buying is Keynote, I believe. \nAd@m\n\nA: There's an online \"Office\" tool called \"QuickOffice\", that appears to allow you to essentially create and use PowerPoints:\nhttp://www.quickoffice.com/quickoffice_pro_hd_ipad/\n\nA: To retain Powerpoint dynamic content (animation, fonts, hyperlink...) you need to convert to HTML5. SlideGo has free tool to do that. You can then view it online with mobile safari. To view offline you can use the same site to export to Epub which still retain interactivity when view on iBooks.\n", "Q: How to move an iPod or iOS device from one computer to another without losing anything? I have a new (Windows) PC and I am fed up with booting up my old computer just to sync my iPad and iPod, so I have just decided to install iTunes and sync with my new one.\nMusic, Pictures and Podcasts are not a problem to sync, I have them all on my NAS and they are in my library.\nHowever, Applications are another matter.\nI have right clicked the device (My iPad) and done Transfer Purchases. I have authorised my computer and all the apps that were on my iPad are now on my iTunes.\nHowever, when I did sync, it still will not copy any new apps in my iTunes. I went to the device/Apps page and clicked the Sync Apps button, but I got the message that it is synced with another library and to sync apps will wipe everything.\nI proceeded because I don't have anything important on my iPad... The only thing that was annoying was it lost the order/groups.\nIt did lose all the app data, but apart from a few high scores, I do not mind.\n(I then performed an update and it did this again... I really don't understand that).\nAnyway, Now it is time for my iPod and I really do not want to lose the order, grouping or the app data and I was wondering if anyone knows how I can sync with my new computer without losing anything?\n\nA: Your question can be rewritten in short form:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes: How to move your music to a new computer\n\n*Where are my iOS backups stored? - expand the section About Syncing and Backups and you'll see\n\n\niTunes places the backup files in the following places:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\n\n*Windows XP: \\Documents and Settings(username)\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\n\n*Windows Vista and Windows 7: \\Users(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\n\n\nI linked to the official articles since things do change and cutting and pasting the steps today might not be right if things change in a month or two. Don't worry - the article about music moves everything except the iOS device backups. If your device is working, there's no need to move backups unless you want to keep older ones or save time the first time you sync with the new iTunes.\n\nA: I think the general process to use is to enable iTunes home sharing on your old and new computer, and then drag the apps from the old to the new one.  \nFirst, make sure that your phone is synced with the old computer (so you don't lose anything), copy over anything that needs it from one computer to the other, and then plug the phone into the new computer, and tell it to overwrite it.\n\nA: Other than using iTunes Home Sharing, which is very useful in this case, I know that if you're on the latest version of iTunes you can download all your past purchases and such. Your other option is of course to actually find the files that include your iPod backups and transfer those onto the same place on your new computer. If you're on Windows 7, the files are located here: \\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\ The apps themselves are located in the iTunes media folder which i believe resides in the Music folder on your computer. I havent used iTunes on a PC since the windows XP days so I'm not entirely sure how all of that gets organized anymore. Transferring the backups would be my advice though.\n", "Q: Mounting an ext3/4 Linux external hard drive to OS X I just bought two 500 GB hard drives for my Mac for the purposes of backing up ten older hard drives to it. One hard drive (200 GB, pretty much full) is from my Linux machine.\nI tried installing Linux via VirtualBox, but I can't seem to mount the external to my vbox installation. In either case, I get an error that it can't read the media, where I either must eject or initialize.\nIn Disk Utility, I can see all the hard drive partitions but I can't mount it or do anything with it.\nThe machine that this hard drive came from is dead now, and I don't have access to other Linux machines.\n\nA: You can mount ext2/3/4-Volumes using MacFUSE with the fuse-ext2 Driver.\n\nA: There's a commercial product from Paragon called ExtFS for Mac.\nI did test is for a few days a while back and it wasn't very fast but got the job (of reading my external ext3 drive) done.\nYou can try-before-buy, so you'll know if that's what you are looking for.\nBtw: I do have Linux in a VM on my Mac to access these files and I'll copy the files I need from the Linux VM via SSH to my mac. Or the other option I use enabling a Windows share on the Mac and copy the files from the Linux VM to the Mac using that share.\nThese files are on an external USB drive, so if your drives are internal you may consider buying a USB docking stating for SATA drive, e.g Sharkoon Quickport Combo. USB drives shouldn't be a problem to connect to a VM - unless as previously mentioned the discs where used in a RAID or with a volume manager like LVM.\n\nA: Have you tried booting your Mac from a Linux LiveCD and copying the data from the ext3/4 drive to an HFS+ drive, possibly one of your 500 GB drives?\n", "Q: Is there a way to execute on applescript when a server becomes available? I am trying to execute a script when a server becomes available (a bit like when the OS detect the presence of a time capsule device and it starts the backup.)  I didn't find a simple way to attach an applescript to an system event. Is there a way?\nI am not looking for anything that requires a compiler. I am simply looking at attaching to an OS event (a bit like \"Folder Actions\" I guess, but for a server.)\n\nA: You can use launchd for that purpose. Here is an example of a launchd config plist that will execute an AppleScript when a disk is mounted:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>Example</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/usr/bin/osascript</string>\n            <string>/Users/sakra/Documents/Test.applescript</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>StartOnMount</key>\n        <true/>\n    </dict>\n</plist>\n\nTo activate the config plist save it to the LaunchAgents folder in your Library folder as Example.plist.\nFrom the Terminal you can then use the command launchctl to activate Example.plist by running:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/Example.plist\n\nThe AppleScript will then be run each time a filesystem is mounted.\nTo deactivate it, run:\nlaunchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/Example.plist\n\n\nA: The only way I can think of is run an script with an idle handler that periodically checks to see if the server is available and if so executes another script or another portion of the same script.\n", "Q: Is there a way to forward individual voicemails on the iPhone I would like to send a voicemail I received to someone else for them to be able to listen to the exact same audio.\nIs there a way to forward an individual voicemail to someone else, whether by email or some other means?\n\nA: Hopefully someone else can provide an easier answer or an app that automates this, but the method I've found so far only works for jailbroken phones:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use iFile or some other file manager to access .amr files that are stored in /var/mobile/Library/Voicemail. The files are numbered sequentially and voicemail.db looks like its used to organize them.\n\n*Try to locate the correct .amr using timestamp.\n\n*Use file manager to email .amr file to myself or someone else.\n\n\nA sidenote is that doing this I was able to find some orphaned .amr files that seemed to not have been completely deleted (.amr files are still stored when deleted until they are cleared from Deleted Messages). I was able to safely delete these old voicemails (over a year old, probably persisting from backups) from the folder.\n", "Q: Vimperator Style Extension for Safari 5? Do we have a Vimperator style extension for Safari 5?\n\nA: Not really. I've been hoping for a good one, but I keep coming back to Firefox and Pentadactyl, a Vimperator fork.\nSafari does have Vimlike and Vim Keybindings, but Vimperator and Pentadactyl are miles ahead in terms of features. If all you're looking for is Vim-style movement and the ability to follow links from the keyboard, those should do the trick, but I miss a lot of the deeper features that Pentadactyl offers: javascript evaluation, quicklinks, ability to yank links from the keyboard, and much, much more.\n\nA: Vimari also offers some of the keyboard shortcuts from Pentadactyl.  \n\nA: An old question, but it seems that the plugin sVim does a decent job now.\n\nA: I found the extensions by Daniel Bergey useful: http://dbergey.github.com/\n\nA: Have a Look at: https://github.com/flipxfx/sVim \nIt's similar to cVim for Chrome.\n", "Q: Read Only Keychain Elements There is a way to add applications to a \"always allow access\"-list for a specific keychain entry. Those applications get read/write permissions to that entry. Is it possible to make keychain only grant readonly access to certain applications?\n\nA: The short answer is no.\nThis question straddles the line between a general discussion how the API works and how a user can use the tools as written.\nThe Keychain API only allows access - it's up to the programmer / developer to determine if a read or a write will happen and end users can't realistically change that behavior.\nUsing the built in Keychain tools and the Keychain app supplied by apple, you can't define a group of apps. You can't even select four or ten apps at once and add them in one step for a specific keychain entry. (The picker for adding apps simply won't allow you to select multiple apps or a folder containing those apps or aliases to those apps you wish to add together.)\nThe only workarounds would be to write a utility that knows how to handle a group of apps or a folder of apps and iterates over each and calls the keychain API to do the work. There is a basic dictionary or keychain in AppleScript, but it doesn't have any ACL specific commands, so you'll have to dig in the developer documents to see if it's even possible to automate with that tool.\n", "Q: Time machine backups and deleted files If I delete photos from my current iPhoto library which have been backed up on time machine, will it be possible to recover these photos from my time machine backup once they've been deleted from my hard disk/iPhoto library? or will time machine eventually delete them next time I backup?  does time machine keep my backups for a particular period of time before deleting them to make room for the next round of backups?\n\nA: By default, Time Machine keeps the following backups:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hourly for the current day\n\n*Daily for the past month\n\n*Weekly for all the other months\n\n\nIf there's space constraints then Time Machine will start to delete the backups, but otherwise it keeps them for as long as possible.\nTo get to the individual photos you will have to have iPhoto as the active window when you activate Time Machine from the menu bar. This lets you go back and see all of the photos. If you did it from the Finder it's more complex because iPhoto bundles its whole library into one big package.\n\nA: Time machine automatically deletes files off the backup drive in two cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hourly backups expire after 24 hours and daily backups expire after 31 days\n\n*When the drive doesn't have enough space to start a backup, old backups are permanently deleted.\n\n\nThe hourly backups fold in to one daily backup - so if a file A was backed up at 2 pm and file B was backed up at 4 pm, even though those backups get deleted, the files all fold into the remaining hourly backup that then becomes that day's backup. Similarly after a month - up to seven daily backups get folded into a weekly backup. You should be able to go back to get any photo you deleted during this period of folding and deleting by going to the closest time to when the file was added or changed.\nThe real problem is that the system is allowed to delete any backup except the most recent once the backup disk is full. So if you deleted some Fall pictures several months back - if the system feels it needs more space for a backup, it will delete all your old photos. Even if you select the warning, the system warns you after the deletion is complete* that they are already gone. Most of the time, you don't lose the entire history, but I have seen that happen twice\nTwo friends were really surprised to find one day their time machine only had one hours worth of backup.\nOne time it was a bug or an error - the system thought it needed 100TB of space and it deleted all the old backups except the one from one hour in the past. \nAnother was a friend that kept adding external drives over time for photo storage and adding them to Time Machine. The iMac only had 200G used on the 1TB drive, but three external drives with 300G of photos each caused the same deletion of all the old backups. The 1 TB time capsule couldn't hold all the files and deleted all the old backups and then popped up a message that it couldn't even start the backup process.\nI don't mean to make it seem like Time Machine is bad - just that I am in the practice of having a second hard drive to make yearly backups of all photos before I do the deleting. Time Machine is great to save me from myself accidentally deleting something as well as protect from a failure of my mac but I don't trust it to be the only storage place for something I may want later.\n\nA: Time Machine will keep old versions deleted/modified files for as long as it has disk space to do so.  There's no fixed period of time, but given that Time Machine only stores files that have changed, the odds are pretty good it will keep it for a long while.  It ultimately depends on the size of the your back up drive, the size of the disk you are backing up, and the cumulative size of files you change in the future.\n", "Q: Dual screens with different resolutions I have my MBP connected to another screen with a smaller resolution. Thus when I want to move a window on the other screen, I have to resize it first to that it fits, then I can make it full screen again.\nIs there a more convenient way to do that ?\n\nA: I recommend that you use a window manager. I use Divvy ($14), which lets me press a one keyboard shortcut to move a window to the other monitor and resize it to full-screen.\n\nA: I'll recommend a similar product Size Up which lets you move and resize windows with keyboard shortcuts.  Its $13 nagware, so free if you don't mind it pestering you occasionally.\n", "Q: Wake on LAN for MBP late 2009 Is it possible to wake my MBP via Magic Packets from power down? I read Is there a way to power up a Mac Mini remotely?, but that does not seem to work from power down. \"Wake for network access\" in \"Energy Saver\" prefpane is ticked.\n\nA: No - the only (recent) hardware that had Lights out Management (LOM) is the now discontinued Xserve. You will need separate hardware to control the power in response to WOL packets (or other signals) to start the current line up of macs from a powered down state.\nApple's current implementation is focused on sleep.

You may broadcast and/or distribute\n  your own soundtracks that were created using the Audio Content,\n  however, individual audio files may not be commercially or otherwise\n  distributed on a standalone basis, nor may they be repackaged in whole\n  or in part as audio samples, sound files or music beds.\n\nPretty much anything license related from Apple gets placed here fairly quickly after launch (FCP X cough, cough)\nA lawyer would be needed to tell you if embedding them in a flash game would fall under \"film, video and audio projects\". One would hope if your flash game embedded a movie sequence or soundtrack as part of the narrative,  everyone here might call that as \"in bounds\" or \"in the spirit\".\nJust taking the whole sounds (or even samples of those sounds in isolation and not mixed down) and using it for actions or events in a flash game seems to be more like repackaging as audio samples which seems clearly \"out of bounds\".\nI would purchase a set of sounds that are expressly marketed as for use in software rather than something intended for original soundtracks unless my lawyer gave me the explicit go-ahead.\n\nA: \nIf I'm distributing my own video editor, can I include these sound\n  effects?\n\nBe very, very careful about this and consult a lawyer and the license itself before moving any further than just hypothetical. Typically \"rights free\" refers to only components in a collection, not the collection itself.\nThe sound effects may be rights-free, but only for use in your own projects like a Flash game or movie. The combination of sound effects in Apple's software package, however, isn't going to be rights-free and wholesale redistribution of those sound effects, of even a subset, will probably be a violation of Apple's copyright, especially when including them in a competing product. Apple does not take copyright infringement lightly.\n\nA: All Final Cut sound effects are royalty free, you can use them however you wish.

I have a mid 2007 white MacBook. I don't currently have the money to get a new computer (even though I'd love to). I was thinking with all the good reports coming out with the SSD performance in MacBook airs, perhaps I could get a speed boost of my own by replacing the hard drive in my computer with an SSD. I don't need a very big one so I'm thinking of spending no more than $250, but hopefully less.\nThe first question I have is has anyone performed the upgrade on that model of MacBook and do you have recommendations for SSD drives and tips for doing the actual upgrade?\nThe second question is do you think that it's worth plunking a hundred fifty bucks into a machine thats getting to its end of life cycle. Perhaps the upgrade will give the computer some new life and I can feel happy with it for another year if I can't get the money together for a new computer right away. On the other hand, is it better to just put that $200 into a piggy bank to start saving for the new airs coming out?\nIf it will help answer this question this is how I use my computer:\nApps that are always running:\nTransmission\nDictionary\nPreview\nSafari (only a few tabs at a time)\nMail\nSkype\niChat\nThings\nNotational Velocity\niCal\niTunes\nApps that I will run on top of that when I'm doing some specific task (ordered from least intensive to most):\nTwitter\nMarsEdit\nKindle\nReeder\nPages\nNumbers\nKeynote\nWord\nExcel\nPowerpoint\niPhoto\nGarageBand\niMovie\nMiro\nI usually run one or both of the office productivity suites at full blast, with multiple documents open in each, when I'm working as a math professor. Sometimes I run Photoshop, XCode, Coda, but not that often.\nSo, hopefully that helps clarify my MacBook usage.\nAlso, if you recommend waiting, not upgrading to SSD, but just waiting to get a new computer, do you think I could do this kind of usage on a 13\" Macbook Air, or should I really think about getting the 15\" Macbook Pro?\n\nA: Here is a good article about the experience a user had with SSDs: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html\nBasically \n\nSSDs are so scorching hot that I'm willing to put up with their craziness.\n\nbut...\n\nJust make sure you have a good backup plan if you're running on a SSD.\n\n\nA: The cheapest 11\" air will run circles around your current mac and have great resale value where your mac is going to lose value very rapidly - better to sell it now and upgrade if you can swing that much money now.\nIf everything else is great and you love your mac - an SSD will be the perfect upgrade - it will feel like a new mac. \nI'm in a situation with my 15\" MacBook Pro. (last rev before unibody)\nI'll be going with a ramjet drive for in a month or so to speed it up / increase eventual resale value. I'm waiting for the Air's to get thunderbolt and will evaluate a new portable at that point since I'll want display mirroring to an iMac with thunderbolt.\nI'm leaning to an air or a 13\" MacBook Pro with apple SSD and I will remove the optical and put in a larger spinning drive using a mounting kit. I'm guessing the iCloud will make it easier for me to be without so much media and the air will be fine for my needs.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I don't have much experience with SSDs, but I just looked into making some upgrades myself. I asked an Apple rep if an AIR would suit my needs, which are similar to yours. (Xcode, Photoshop, iMovie, etc)\nAn Apple salesperson at the Apple Store told me that the MacBook Airs are at this point not able to handle Photoshop properly. (And those have the SSD already in them!) The performance boost of the Air is somewhat exaggeratedly explained as being the result of the SSD. It's a combination of SSD and the graphics/CPU being tightly integrated.\nI recommend waiting until the end of July 2011 when the refreshes are announced. Although the current Airs aren't what you'd want, an update might really change that. \nIf you can afford it, or save for it, I'd go for the MacBook Pro. Those are more expensive but are powerful.\n", "Q: Create and distribute printers Is there a way to create a printer on a machine. Then bundle up the Printer bundle and create an installer out of it for multiple users at a location. To avoid having to explain to each user how to install a network printer?\nThis is one of those enterprise issues.\n(10.6 specifically... at least for the next month)\n\nA: If your Macs are part of the OS X Server's OD, then you can use Workgroup Manager to assign printers to either Groups of users or Groups of Machines.\nIf you want to manage the drivers and the detailed printer settings, this link might help.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install an SSD and/or another hard drive after purchase in a 27\" iMac? I'm looking at buying a new iMac 27\" for university and want the hard drive + ssd but the problem is that its so expensive. So is it possible to install another hard drive without adding in the option? Also I don't want an SSD - I want more storage for the OS, so I would replace it for a 500gb hard drive if it would fit. Has anyone done this, or is it not possible?\n\nA: On the immediate downsides - You will need special tools and be handling some delicate parts. Also, there is concern that the temperature sensing since the 2009 model iMac causes the fans to run faster with non-apple drives.\nIf you really want to get dust between the LCD and the front glass on a brand new mac and take the chance of ripping a tiny ribbon cable - just do some research at ifixit.com or talk with a local tech that works on new iMacs a lot. Do also research fan control and know if you are not planning on an Apple specification drive to install.\nMy guess is Apple SSD are expensive because the parts are cherry picked to be the best of a lot (more so than the SSD consumers buy) and perhaps loaded with custom firmware and generally have temp sensors specific to the mac. I could be totally wrong, but even if you feel the drives are overpriced, Apple installing any SSD is better than a consumer due to the labor for for installing them is almost nil as they are installed at the most economical time - at assembly.\nIf you can't afford it now - why not expand to an external SSD over firewire or ThunderBolt later. They are totally silent and small. It just seems the risks of DIY on a new mac make it better for most people to pay a trained tech to do the install.\n\nA: The current line of iMacs has space for one 3.5\" and one 2.5\" drive. You can fit a SSD or HDD in either slot at a later point in time. But be cautious, this is not an easy task due to the space constrained nature of the device.\n\nA: Yes you can install an aftermarket SSD into the 27\" iMac but there are a few obstacles which you will have to overcome, like the Hard drive sensor cable and cleaning the iMac glass so particles are not stuck between the actual display and the glass.\n\nA: Other World Computing have a Turnkey Upgrade program which includes up to three internal SSDs and a three-year warranty.\n", "Q: How can I read a pdf with Firefox 5? I'd like to upgrade Firefox to the new version but I don't know if I'll still be able to read pdf on it with this this plugin. Is there another way ?\n\nA: The PDF Browser Plugin from Schubert|it recently added support for Firefox.\nIt's free for personal, non-commercial use.  I've found it to be a very capable in-browser PDF viewer.\n\nA: I've looked for a long time, and couldn't really find anything. I use the Open IT Online addon now instead—I like that it is integrated into the Download file dialog and gives an option to Open IT Online in addition to saving and opening in Preview. It supports opening in Google Docs, Zoho, and a few other services.\n\nA: You can use Adobe Acrobat, in the preferences you can set to open in web or open in Acrobat.\nIf you choose web, it will open in FireFox\nIf you choose Acrobat, it will download the .pf and open in Acrobat\nThis is currently the way I will do it as Firefox has gone from Firefox 4 to FireFox 10 beta. The reason is to catch up with IE in releases. (apparently) \n", "Q: How can I break a persistent association between .xcodeproj files and Xcode 4.2 beta? I've got Xcode 4.0.2 installed in /Developer, and the Xcode 4.2 beta in /XcodeBeta. My problem is that the .xcodeproj file type is now associated with Xcode 4.2 and I can't change it to Xcode 4.0.2.\nI've tried the usual thing of doing Get Info on an .xcodeproj file, selecting Xcode (4.0.2) in the Open with: drop down then clicking Change All..., but at that point the version of Xcode selected in the Open with: dropdown just flips back to Xcode 4.2 and the file type association remains with Xcode 4.2.\nIf I rebuild my Launch Services DB using lsregister -kill -domain local -domain system -domain user this removes any reference to /XcodeBeta/Applications/Xcode.app in the Launch Services DB (as reported by lsregister -dump), but the next time I start up that version of Xcode it re-registers itself with Launch Services and re-hijacks all my file associations. It's driving me potty!!\n(Incidentally, this also affects other file types associated with Xcode, e.g. .plist, but it's .xcodeproj that's really causing my pain.)\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Use RCDefaultApp prefpane. You can get it from http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/\nOpen it, select UTIs and scroll down to com.apple.xcode.project. \nOn the right you can change which filetype is associated to which application or disable the association completely.\n\nEdit: another alternative is Magic Launch, which allows the same kind of file association overrides.\nOpen it, drag an Xcode project file into the pane on the left, set the Default Application on the right to the appropriate version of Xcode.\n\n\nA: This is caused by Xcode using the same bundle identifier across versions. You could try to rename the Xcode.app of the beta to something like XcodeBeta.app. This should make LaunchServices think that XcodeBeta.app is in fact older and let you open the .xcodeproj files with the other version. It's not a real solution, but this is as far as I can tell the only way (short of changing Xcode's bundle identifier, of course).\n", "Q: Repartition an AirDisk When I first set up my 1Tb external disk with my AirPort Extreme I partitioned it into two 500Gb disks, one for Backup and one for Media storage but I have no memory of how I did this. I seem to remember being prompted when I first connected the disk.\nNow, over a year later the backup partition is filling up but I don't really use the media partition at all. So, i'd like to know if it's possible to re-partition this disk into a 800/200Gb split without wiping the disk and starting my backups over again?\n\nA: Disconnect the External Hard drive from the Airport Extreme and connect it directly to ur Computer, then resize the partitions in disk utility. \n\nA: Yes, if you partitioned in Mac OS Extended you should be able to.\nOpen Disk Utility (Applications > Utilities) and go ahead and select your disk from the list on the left. You should see your hard drive and the two partitions under it. \nSelect the hard drive, go to the Partition tab, and you should get a box split into two representing your disk. To resize the partitions drag one of them smaller an the other bigger, or select them and change the \"Size\" value on the text box into their respective new sizes.\nWhen you are done click \"Apply\". Again, this is just possible for partitions formatted as Mac OS Extended. The format should be visible in the Volume Information, right above size. It cant be changed unless you reformat (and loose all your data) so you would have to backup and \"wipe\" that partition if it's FAT32. \nTime Machine, im pretty sure, works only on Mac OS Extended, so there shouldn't be any problem with that partition. If you don't work with a Windows machine too then theres really no reason why the other partition should be FAT32 (FAT is used for Windows compatibility) so really, you should drive into no problems ;)\nIf you need any extra help just go ahead and comment!\nHope it helps. \nKevin\n", "Q: Fast e-mail client for OS X? I'm currently using Thunderbird for my e-mail needs on OS X. I manage 4 different e-mail accounts, one of which receives a lot of e-mail per day.\nAs the messages pile up, I notice that Thunderbird is getting more sluggish. Is there an alternative that handles large volumes of e-mail efficiently?\n\nA: I've switched full time to Sparrow largely because of how well it handles multiple email accounts. I'm willing to put up with some of its other quirks because of the fast account switching and unified inbox view. Switching between accounts is the fastest I've experienced of any tightly-coupled-to-gmail mail application I've used on any OS and the minimal UI appeals greatly to me. It's support for non-Gmail or non-IMAP accounts is only so-so right now, but if you fall within those use cases it's definitely a contender for a great mail client on OS X.\nSparrow does download your mail to local disk; it's part of what makes account switching so snappy (versus something like MailPlane where it's a UI wrapper around Gmail's web view). Between my 3 main Gmail accounts I've got just under 18,000 email messages for a total of ~3.5 GB of space on disk consumed by messages and their attachments. That should give you a baseline for comparison to your own account volumes and needs.\nIt stays in lock step with Gmail so I don't worry about backing up my local Sparrow directory with Time Machine -- Gmail has copies of everything and gives me the ability to undo any horrendous mistakes I might make with my mail accounts.\n\nA: Nobody's mentioned Apple Mail. I love it, particularly the Lion version.\n\nA: With IMAP it seems that MailMate is extremely fast and powerful, as already suggested. I'd try it out, to see whether it suits your need. I tried it once, but the poor gmail support at the time had made me drop it.\nThen there are a plethora of without-GUI apps, like mutt, which is highly praised by the UNIX-folks.\nIf you need a client with robust Exchange support, you can't go wrong with Outlook:Mac 2011. \nBut, just for the fun of it, why not trying Mail.app?\n", "Q: Is it a problem if kernel_task is routinely above 130MB on mid 2007 white MacBook? In trying to get the best performance possible out of this old guy, I've been looking into Activity Monitor more and more. kernel_task is usually above 130MB (142.9MB right now). Is this abnormal? If so, what could I do to fix it?\n\nA: Short answer:\nProbably not, but without knowing more details about the machine I can't tell for sure. \nLong answer:\nThe single largest block of ram in the kernel are the tables used for keeping track of memory permissions and VM mappings. For every 4KB of ram in your computer the kernel needs to keep at least 64 bytes of data to track what process is using it, etc. Consequently the amount of ram the kernel uses is directly proportional to the amount physical memory you have installed. On my Mac Pro with 48GB of ram the kernel routinely uses over a 1GB of ram, and that is entirely normal normal.\nI am guessing you have ~2-4 GB of ram, which would require 32 to 64 MB for just the tables, and the rest is in the ballpark for what the kernel needs for memory buffers, mapped text and drivers, and basic operations.\n\nA: I don't think this is unusual.\n\n\n*\n\n*On my Mac Mini which has been on for ~4 days, kernel_task is using ~430 MB, and ~5% cpu (I'm moving lots of files in the background)\n\n*On my MacBook Pro which has been on for ~1 week, kernel_task is using ~489 MB\n\n*MacBook Air with only Skype and Chrome open ~293 MB.\n\n\nSeems like you're actually doing pretty good!\nIt's worth noting that each mac (except the Air) has 10+ windows open. This may affect memory usage here.\n", "Q: Why is the screen saver not kicking in? I have  a Mac mini running 10.6.7. I have set the screen saver to be automatically activated after 15 minutes, and the session to be locked a while after that.\nBut sometimes, the screen saver stops working. The screen remains on and unlocked indefinitely.\nI sometimes suspend the machine manually (for example by pressing ⌘-⎇-⏏). This will suspend it properly, but when I come back to it sometime later I will often see that it is on again and no screen saver.\nThis problem appears after I have been using the computer for a while, and then doesn't go away until I turn it off (or perhaps just log out). It could perhaps mean that some screensaver process has died and not restarted automatically.\nCan anyone help me figure out what is going wrong, and what I can to to fix it?\nUpdate: In the end, I found the application causing it to not suspend. It was SqueezePlayer. I didn't any really good suggestions how to find the culprit, though.\n\nA: I cannot tell about screensaver for sure, but you can use pmset -g to show which process is disturbing sleep (think this first appeared in 10.6.7)\n# pmset -g\n[cut]\nsleep       0 (imposed by 1517)\n[cut]\n\nthis means that pid 1517 is preventing the system from sleeping.\n# ps ax |grep 1517\n1517   ??  Rs     1:59.76 /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd \n\nThis shows that this is the backup daemon running.\n\nA: I have seen this caused by some poorly behaved programs, notably Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup prevents the screen saver from working at all while it is running, whether full screen or windowed.  You might record ps -ef from when it works and when it doesn't and look for any additional programs running that might be blocking the screen saver.\nI've also seen some cheap mice develop \"jitter\" which makes the computer think it's being moved; this can also result in the machine waking up from suspend.\n\nA: Open up Activity Monitor and when you see the list of processes running, right click one of the column headings (e.x. \"Process Name\") and check \"Preventing Sleep\". This will add another column with \"Yes\" or \"No\" values per process. If you see one with \"yes\" in that column, it means that this process is what is keeping your mac from sleeping.\n\nA: MacKeeper actually has a user setting that was turned on by default to prevent sleep.  Click on the MacKeeper helmet in the title bar and look for the option.\n\nA: I also had this issue after upgrading to Sierra.  I got the screensaver up when it was less than 5 minutes but not 10 minutes or more.  I went into Apple/System Preferences/Energy Saver and changed Computer and Display Sleep to more than 10 minutes: this way, the screensaver kicks in before the sleep does.  Problem solved.  Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make a mouse accelerate like it did in Windows? 15 year Windows guy here, slowly going full Mac on everything and enjoying it.\nBut there's one thing that's killing me: the USB mouse acceleration curve in Snow Leopard drives me crazy. I've looked at utilities that claim to change it, but I haven't found anything that works (thanks Apple for removing the mouse acceleration curve function). I really want my mouse to move like it did in Windows.\nWhat I have discovered is that different mice seem to have slightly different acceleration (or I'm going insane). I use a cheap Dell optical mouse at work that's fairly similar to what I'm used to in Windows. But my Razer Imperator at home, despite costing a fortune, moves like molasses through OS X.\nI've tried the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad and have been unsatisfied with both.\nIs this actually an issue? I may be very well be imagining it. Have any other ex-Windows guys experienced this?\n\nA: No, unless you buy a specific mouse\nThe option to define custom mouse acceleration curves was present in OS X 10.4, but apple simplified it in 10.5, and removed it entirely in 10.6. \nMouse Curve is a supposedly forthcoming pref-pane that completely replaces the OS X mouse HID kext. However, development is really slow, or stalled.\nPersonally, I have poked about a bit in the kernel myself, but am unfamiliar with kernel programming. Fixing the mouse acceleration on OS X will at minimum require a custom kext, which is non-trivial to code.\nThe option that is out there is to buy a Microsoft mouse, and use it on OS X. Microsoft has released custom drivers for their mice that mimic the mouse behavior on windows.\n\nEssentially, the windows \"Enhance Pointer Precision\" option applies linear velocity-based acceleration to the mouse movements, e.g. the distance moved is proportional to the speed the mouse moves. Think of it as basically having the DPI of the mouse inversely proportional to the mouse's speed.\nOS X on the other hand, has a stepped acceleration curve, where the mouse moves at one DPI when slow, and another when moved faster then a threshold.\nThere are pref-panes that let you disable OS X's acceleration curve, but none that allow you to substitute windows.\nAs far as I can tell (and this is opinion), this curve is optimized for trackpads. In my opinion, it is more then useless for mice (using a mac mouse actually damaged my mousing efficacy on windows, which really affects my work (CAD Stuff)).\nPersonally, I have entirely dispensed with the idea of using a mouse on OS X, and ust bought a Magic Trackpad.\n\nA: Yes, using the command line of iMouseFix\nThe command line version of mousefix/iMouseFix is working for me on 10.6 with the Apple MagicMouse (some of the other suggested solutions don't work for the MagicMouse). I can quickly move the mouse between displays, but also do fine work with a setting of 8.\n/Application/mousefix/mousefix 8\n\nI have added the following to my .profile as they suggest in the README\nFYI, The binary download is mousefix.tbz2 at http://code.google.com/p/mousefix-10-6/downloads/list.\nAlso see the similar question at superuser - https://superuser.com/a/446200/66255\n\nA: I recently bought a Razer DeathAdder, and after a LOT of tweaking in Razer's own driver panel, it works beautifully with my Mac.\nYou should definitely check out http://www.razersupport.com/ and download the Mac driver.\nDifferent mice respond differently to begin with, and send that information back to the OS in any number of different resolutions. A gaming mouse especially is going to be sending MUCH different information back to your system than a typical desktop mouse. Razer's driver should have an acceleration slider that you can tweak to your liking, and should also be able to process that device's input in a way that makes more sense to your system.\n\nA: Check out Mouse Acceleration Preference Pane.\n\nA: a solution i posted in another question should help.\nNo third party software required.\n\nA: There may be news about a prospective mouse fix for Mac OS X: Project SmoothMouse.\nFrom the developer’s website (emphasis mine):\n\nThe current development phase is “pre-alpha”.

I have always purchased AppleCare with new Macs, and I seem to recall TechTool Deluxe being an important part of the bundle. I bought an iMac at the beginning of the year and neglected to pop in the AppleCare DVD at that time since I knew I was already registered for support and the TT app was migrated from my old computer.\nHowever, today when I got the urge to investigate some drive integrity issues, the migrated version of TT wasn't compatible with the current OS and I couldn't seem to find my AppleCare DVD. Some Google searching shows that as recent as last December, the app was available for download from apple.com, however, those links are now dead and Apple's product page makes no mention of TechTool Deluxe whatsoever. (Micromat's own website has a sneaky past-tense \"was\" in their product description now.\nSo, what's the low-down? When did the bundle expire--did the AppleCare I purchased in January contain this on the DVD? Am I screwed if I can't find that DVD, or are there other download options? Any reasons I might not want to use that software?\n\nA: Here's all the details:\nhttp://www.macgasm.net/2011/03/03/tech-tool-deluxe-longer-included-applecare/\nI totally agree with their recommendation of Drive Genius and Disk Warrior.

The calendars are stored as sub-folders of ~/Library/Calendars in Snow Leopard.\nIf you have multiple calendars, you can check the date each folder was created to see which one would be the Google calendar.\n", "Q: Why might a MacBook not detect an Apple A1152 Mighty Mouse? It seemed that the USB connection was OK.  \nIs there any way to solve this problem?\n\nA: With a problem such as this, the first thing you must always try is to connect a different USB mouse. If one works, and the other doesn't, then the problem is almost certainly with a defective mouse, and not with the computer. This is a basic troubleshooting step known as \"isolating the fault\".\nIn all problems of this sort (not just with mice) you need to test with a second peripheral that you know is working correctly, which we refer to as the \"known good\" item.\n\nA: Open system profiler and look at the USB connection area. You can refresh to see if it's seen on the system bus. If it is - look in the console app - system.log for more USB related errors.\nIf it isn't then it's a bad port / cable or mouse.\n", "Q: multitasking gestures I develop for iOS, and use an ipad2 with firmware 4.3.2, and xcode 3.2.5\nmultitasking gestures work fine,\nI got the ipad of a friend which has firmware 4.3.3, but my xcode doesn't recognize it,\n * so I want to make this friends ipad be able to use the multitasking gestures, is the problem of not recognition because of the x code?, does the 4.3.3 only work with latest xcode?\nthanks a lot!\n\nA: I think you'd have to use Xcode 4 (I did). But since you mentioned it worked with your iPad 2, try to first register the device in the developer portal.\n\nA: This does work with Xcode 3.2.6 and iPad if you make sure you connect the iPad to Xcode and check the box \"use for development\". You may have to enter an admin password and allow Xcode to scan the specific build (the exact wording of the dialog is hazy - but there is a step where Xcode gathers info about 4.3.3 on the device if your Xcode build shipped before 4.3.3 did.)\nI don't use Xcode 4 or 3.2.5 so I can't be sure this works in general and you may need to ask on the developer forums or check the release notes to see what the minimum level of Xcode is needed to work with 4.3.3.\n", "Q: Which sticky notes app you would prefer for iPhone which can synchronized to Google tasks?

I usually buy Apps in the Mac App Store and iOS App Store but I've always had the doubt, when I buy it, will the app be available in the future for the next releases or not?\nI never brought an App two times because of a major release, but is it possible?\n\nA: Yes it is definitively possible. As of now, Apple does not enable the developers to publish paid updates for their software. Due to that, developers sometimes release different versions to buy from the App Store.\nE.g. have a look at http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/photoforge/id314173066 and http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/photoforge2/id435789422\n\nA: There have been a few apps that had been pushed out as totally separate apps when a new major version came out: Tweetie 2 for iOS (then iPhone OS) comes to mind, for example. This lead to a huge controversy, but given the price range of most apps (below $5) it's understandable that developers sometimes push out a new app instead of a free update. If you use an app a lot for a year or two, asking for another two bucks or so shouldn't be an issue, right?\n", "Q: A way to use iPad as a sketching device during presentations (without cables)? I would like to use an iPad as a sketch board during some presentations. Idea is quite simple. I draw on the iPad and the people can watch it on the big screen. One way to do it its plain simple. Just connect a HDMI cable to the iPad from the projector and you're set. You can use any app you prefer for that.\nThe problem arises if you want to get rid of the cables. I do have a Mac, which can be connected to the projector, but where to go from there?\nI would imagine to use the Mac as some sort of the Airplay receiver, but then again one would still need a special sketching app, which supports this setup. Or is there a native way to clone iPad screen over to the Mac?\nAny help and ideas appreciated!\n\nA: I assume that you have your presentation or document you want to show on your Mac. If so, the setup I use is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install AirDisplay on your iPad and its client on your Mac\n\n*Install CocoPad on your mac.\n\n*Using AirDisplay \"link\" your iPad to your mac and mirror the displays.\n\n*Connect your projector and mirror the display\n\n*Create a new document in CocoPad and in the right corner choose a \"transparent\" canvas.\n\n*Bring the  transparent canvas on top of the document you want to scribble on and then scribble with your finger (or a stylus) on the iPad\n\n\nSince AirDisplay relies on a wireless network to become an external display, you may want to make your setup more reliable by creating your own wireless network. To do so go to System Preferences-> Sharing -> Internet Sharing and enable it. Connect your iPad to the \"created\" wireless network and the connection will now be rock solid.\nAnother option that you could try out is inklet with cocoPad but it is a bit more expensive but with that option you would not need an iPad.\nHope this helps\n\nA: The only way I currently know is not available yet: With iOS 5 you will gain the ability to wirelessly mirror your iPad's display to an AppleTV.\n", "Q: How can I get a video *into* the photo/video gallery on an iPad or iPhone? Let's start by assuming that I have a perfectly compatible file. (In my use case, I was literally trying to get a video I took on my iPhone, that lives in my iPhone photos/video gallery, onto my iPad, so this isn't about conversions or codecs.)\nNow, there are many ways to transfer and watch the the video, but I can't find a single darn way to save it with my other videos and photos:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it's short, or I'm willing to clip it, I can email it to myself, but unlike photos, clicking on a video enclosure doesn't allow you to save it to the native app.    You can open it in vlc, good reader, etc.\n\n*If it's under 180MB, I can upload it to Dropbox from the source device (iPhone for me) and then access or watch it on the destination device (iPad for me).  But I can't save it to photos from Dropbox on the iPad\nWhy do I care, if I can access it and even watch it as described above?   Two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*I like having things organized in one place.   I don't want to have to remember which vids are in Photos, vs. Dropbox, vs. Good reader, etc.\n\n*Most apps that use video (including Apple's own iMovie, for frack's sake) can only open and access movies located in the photos app.\n\n\nPlease tell me I'm missing something elegant, if not obvious?\n\nA: I'm surprised nobody has answered this correctly.\nThe solution is to open iTunes, click on your iPhone, go to the Photos tab, then Sync Photos for the folder that contains the photo and video subfolders you want to sync.  Each subfolder will then be sync'ed to your iphone UNDERNEATH the Camera Roll as new Albums, and these are treated seperately than the Camera Roll and will always remain synced.\nFurthermore, apps that can access the Camera Roll almost always can also access Synced Albums, so this should really work well for you.  I keep a whole bunch of old photos and videos on my iPhone at all times using this method and it works great.\nAs a bonus, unlike the Camera Roll, these Synced Albums don't get backed up in iTunes, so it won't slow down your Backup like a growing Camera Roll will.\n\nA: Apparently the only way to get a video into a Photos app on ios 10.{1,2} is to use airdrop. If you import video through the iTunes it will end up in the Videos application.\niMovie and 3rd party video apps can see videos only in the camera roll,\nthe videos (including home videos: the type is not important) in the Videos app can not be accessed by 3rd party apps (for editing or whatever).\n\nA: You are missing nothing obvious. Currently, I have to shoot video from a camera that works with the camera connection kit for iPad since that is the only way to get video into the photo roll at present.\nThe camera connector kit won't work to import video from iPhone to iPad.\nThe SD card reader won't let your iPhone write out video to a card.\nAs you've discovered, no app has the ability to add video to the camera roll other than calling the built in camera to capture it and store it in the roll.\nI've looked over the iCloud and iOS5 announcements closely, and even though it looks like video you capture will get backed up to the cloud as part of the nightly wifi application data backups, the Photo Stream demonstration very carefully mentioned Photo all the time and no videos were present in any of the files. I don't know for sure, but it doesn't look like anything is announced to change this in the near future.\nI have submitted a bug report against iMovie for iOS and perhaps if enough people do, it might get added. Also, consumer feedback might help too.\nI personally don't care if I can use wifi or bluetooth device to device, use the camera connector kit, go through the cloud. I'd just like to be able to edit video on iPad iMovie using footage shot from iPhone without needing to bring a PC and a USB cable for transfer.\n\nA: The easiest way is to use an app that allows you to download from the account \"Dropbox\" and save to camera roll.  I use \"Downloads Free\" by LS apps.  It has its own browser.  Navigate to your Dropbox account online.  Select your video and download it.  It gets saved under the files folder.  Select your video and  select save to photos option.  Photos refers to the Camera Roll.  Voila.\n\nA: I use Photo Transfer App to copy videos over WiFi from my iPhone to my iPad. \nIt works well for me. The videos appear in the Camera Roll on the iPad, alongside videos I took on the iPad itself.\n\nA: On iOS 11 I would suggest using iCloud Drive. Suppose you do not want to use a computer or any other apple devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can email the file to yourself, click the attachment, select “save to files”, and you can save it to iCloud Drive. (Sometimes there is an option to save to photos directly). Currently iMovie is able to import files from iCloud Drive, then you can save it to the Camera Roll.\n\n*Some online file storage apps can save photos and movies to your Camera Roll (e.g., Google Drive: use “send a copy” to save to video, or “open in” to save to iCloud Drive)\n\nA: You tap the camera icon and press either record (for a video) or capture (for a photo) then it will automatically save.\n", "Q: What are the main difficulties people face migrating from Linux to Mac OS? Coming from a Linux background what are the main difficulties I will face if I start to work on iMac? \nI use to work on Linux with consoles and I know I have a huge apps repository (synaptics) for almost all I need. I'm programming Java and Ruby all day long, so what are the main differences?\nDifferences like UI and passionate things I already know, so please tell me only useful things. (otherwise we'll keep this question for years)\nHave you faced this before? Is it a slightly migration?\nI'd be thankful. \n\nA: I did a switch from Linux just a week ago. I am using Linux for 15+ years. Lately, my Desktop distro of choice was Ubuntu.\nMac OS X is a BSD based system, so minor issues you will have to get used to is stuff like using ipfw instead of iptables.\nAs you will pretty soon realise Ubuntu (and other distros) simply mimic lots of Mac solutions when it comes to usability. You will find yourself being very familiar with a lot of GUI elements. \nThere is virtually no difference from a developer point of view. You can just install rvm and develop your Ruby apps as you used too. Main difference is, that now you can use the famous TextEdit! :D\nAs for the drawbacks:\nMac has worse package management and you might miss some fancy features of apt-get / dpkg (or yum / rpm). It's not groundbreaking however, and Homebrew will be sufficient in the end anyway. \nThere are various minor things like key shortcuts, window management which takes couple of hours to get used to. I for one can't get what's the idea behind how the window maximization works.\nIn the end, I must say that I don't miss a thing so far. I got everything I loved about Linux + beautiful system which can run StarCraft and Photoshop. :-) \n\nA: Some minor differences I encountered when I was using both Mac and Linux systems:  The most common Mac OS X file system is case insensitive, whereas Linux filenames are case sensitive.  There is no default and enabled account named \"root\" on a Mac.\n\nA: I'm not a Linux switcher, but I know several now die-hard Mac users who came from Linux. The biggest issue for all of them seems to be the fact that OS X only has one \"console\" (screen), while Linux offers a lot more and can switch between text and graphic consoles easily. While several parallel desktops are supported by OS X via Spaces, something like the console switching (AFAIK) doesn't exist for OS X. This isn't an issue if you're not used to it, though - I for one never needed it. The file system is slightly different since parts of OS X are based on BSD - the differences are minor though and easy to learn.\nSince OS X (IMHO, but I'm not alone...) offers a superior user experience in comparison with any Linux desktop environment, you should quickly get used to any differences.\n\nA: You can install many useful open source tools such as wget on your iMac thanks to the open source community. There are couple of projects you may want to look at.\n\n\n*\n\n*Fink\n\n*MacPort\n\n*Homebrew\n", "Q: Eudora email migration When Lion comes out, PPC Rosetta support for the Eudora email app is reported not to be available.\nWhich contemporary Mac OS X email clients might support the most painless and reliable importing and use of 10 years worth of of Eudora messages, contacts, filters, and settings?  Which current and supported email clients have the largest subset of Eudora's capabilities?\nWhat problems might I encounter during a complete Eudora export, and how might I avoid them?\n\nA: I've used Eudora Mailbox Cleaner to varied success for a few recent-ish switchers, with the added bonus (for me, at least) that it can import messages from Thunderbird. It is, however, a PowerPC app in itself, so you'd need to run it before upgrading to Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.\n\nA: I left behind eudora some time back, but loved the four part article on migrating 16 years of email from eudora to gmail by Adam Engst.\nEven if you don't want it there permanently, you can still use Eudora and test things. Gmail uses IMAP so everything will sync well to Apple Mail or Outlook (which is really quite good in it's 2011 version). Mailplane is nice, too.\nAs for clients - the Lion apple mail looks great - so you can get things tidy and then evaluate that once it ships.\nBest of luck!\nAlso - TidBits has some wonderful Take Control books and has two about preparing for and using Lion. The first on preparing is out, and the other is waiting for the general release of Lion / Devloper NDA to be lifted before shipping.\n\nA: Here's a Tidbits article on Switching from Eudora to Apple Mail from 13-Apr-2008.\n", "Q: Logic Studio 9 : Is it possible to use tracks or buses as \"virtual devices\" Inside Logic Studio, you can re-map all your track output to specific buses and use those buses as inputs for other tracks.\nI was wondering if it was possible to somehow use those buses outside of logic.\nBasically, here's what i'm trying to do : I want to link a track to my Skype audio input so I can create insane real-time voice filter effects.\n\nA: If Skype supported the ReWire protocol directly this would be no problem at all. You'd wire Skype's output to Logic 9, run it through your effects, and then wire the output from Logic 9 to Skype's input. But Skype doesn't support ReWire.\nSo instead you have to hijack it's audio input stream and feed it a stream from Logic 9. To do that you can use the most awesome SoundFlower app from the great folks at Cycling '74. It's free!\nSoundFlower presents itself as an audio device to your computer. Except its only use is to route audio between applications. The 2ch mode is what you'll need to accomplish your goal here.\nYou'll set Skype's audio (microphone) input to be SoundFlower's output -- lets say the left channel output.\nIn Logic you'd create a new Audio track that takes its input from from the built-in microphone on your Mac. To enable the internal mic in Logic go to Preferences -> Audio and under the Devices tab select the Core Audio sub-tab and pick 'Built-in Microphone' for device.\nCreate a new Logic project. Add a new, mono Audio Track with the input coming from the internal microphone. Connect output of the track to the SoundFlower input channel. Pile on whatever effects you'd like on the channel (no real need to use a sub-mix buss in Logic here). Watch the levels in Logic and Skype and adjust to taste.\nThere's going to be some latency involved in all of this. And whether your third party will pick up on that or not depends on how big the latency gets as you pile on effects.\n\nA: Use Soundflower to route Logic's output to Skype. You may be able to achieve the same effect creating an aggregate device, but Soundflower is free and easy to use. Have fun freaking people out with insane real-time voice filter effects.\n\nA: For this, you'll need two microphones. One can be anything, like a headphone, dynamic, condensed, etc. The other has to be anything on a stand. You have to use the second microphone as the Skype input, and the first one as Logic's. You then aim the second mic on the Mac's Built in output, the first you're talking into. Then you put all your effects on. Hope this helped!\n", "Q: Can I change my 2011 iMac's graphic card from AMD's to nvidia Quadro? I do lot of video editing work, mostly on FCP & Avid and I feel Quadro card is way to go.\nDo you think I can get it changed from Apple?\n-Reddy\n\nA: I don't even think the hardware would be compatible. Quite frankly, while you can open up the system and tinker with it, you have to worry about two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Form factor - The card is probably a different shape. Apple partners with other companies when designing a system and the fact that they put an ATI in there says something about the engineering of the machine.\n\n*Power & bus interface - These are likely less of an issue, but something to be aware of.\n\n\nThe iMac is a turnkey system, not an upgradable machine, like the Mac Pro (or, gasp, a PC). I'm sorry that this is not the answer you want to hear, but I don't think that Apple will do it. That said, it can't hurt to ask.\n\nA: Some cards can be made to work in OS X with custom ROM, however, OS X extensions do not support the card's hardwired device ID, so it would result in a Kernel Panic at boot. If the card is close to another officially supported card in OS X or use the same GPU, there's an easy hack which will allow it to operate in OS X.\nNVIDIA Quadro 4\nThis card is very close to GeForce 4 Ti series, using same GPU and PCB layout. Some even have dual DVI outputs.\nCustom GeForce 4 Ti ROM will make the card work as a Mac Card, but a Kernel Panic will happen every time you try to boot with original NVIDIA extensions.\nTo begin you'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*find the hardware Device ID of your card\n\n*have your card flashed and working with a Mac ROM, you can test your card in OS 9 (currently available ROM for Quadro 4 700 XGL)\n\n*have an editor capable of modifying plist files.\n\n\nFor the Quadro 4 700 XGL\n\n\n*\n\n*Device ID of the card is 025B (Quadro 4 700 XGL) 10DE (NVIDIA)\n\n*ROM is available online\n\n*Quadro 4 / GeForce 4 Ti series will use 2 OS X extensions to operate.  First is NVDAResman.kext (used by every NVIDIA card), second is NVDANV20Hal.kext (specific kernel extension for GeForce 4 series / NV2x GPUs)\n\n\n\nBefore physically installing your Mac flashed card, let's proceed with the Extensions hack.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your root disk (OS X installation) and go to folder /System/Library/Extensions\n\n*Back up the extensions you're going to modify (here NVDAResman.kext and NVDANV20Hal.kext). Keep one copy of each in a safe place, and one copy of each in your desktop. Last 2 copies are going to be edited.\n\n*Right-Click on the first extension you copied on your desktop and use \"show package content\" option. The extension will open as a classic folder.\n\n*Open the \"Contents\" folder and Open the file Info.plist with your editor.\n\n*Search for string IOPCIMatch and add your card's device ID.  Save the file and proceed to do the same with the second extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Copy the edited extensions packages to /System/Library/Extensions\n\n*Open the Disk Utility application and run the repair permissions utility on your drive.\n\n*Now install the card, and reboot your computer.\n\n\n\nCredit: http://themacelite.wikidot.com/kext-mod\n", "Q: How do I change the UI language in Snow Leapoard? I'd like to change my MacBook's languages of the UI. How would I do that in Snow Leopard?\n\nA: Open System Preferences, and then Language & Text. Drag the language you want on top and then log-off (or restart) your computer.\n\n", "Q: Will I ever lose the apps that I've bought? Say I've bought an app for $0.99. If I delete it, and then I require that app again, do I need to pay another $0.99?\n(OK, I really don't want to waste $0.99 just to try it…)\n\nA: You'll have all of your apps for the life of your iTunes account, and you can download them again at any time for no charge.  \nThe only exception is apps that have been removed from the App Store for legal reasons -- generally copyright violation of some form -- or if they're removed by Apple due to some rules violation, both of which are very rare.\nApple has been gradually improving its App Store interfaces so it's easier to determine which apps you already own. Until recently if you saw an app in the store that you already purchased the link to access it would still have the price: if you clicked it and you already owned it you'd be presented with a dialog that indicated that you'd already purchased it and asked if you just wanted to download it again.\nAs of now the App Store app on the iPad now intelligently replaces the price with \"installed\" if you have it installed (and, I believe, \"install\" if you've purchased it but it's not on the device), and the very latest iPhone App Store app seems to be doing it now, too. iTunes 10.3 appears to be doing it as well.\n\nA: To go along with what Matthew said, there is one way you can lose access to an app: if it is malicious, Apple has a \"kill switch\" that will delete it off everyone's devices when they remove it from the store. To date, they have never used the kill switch.\n\nA: No, you won't. If you download the app again using the same account you will not be charged again.\n", "Q: Macbook's harddrive free space changes seemingly randomly Over the last few days my hard drive has gone from a few GB of free space, to zero KB, absolutely full. I then deleted about 1GB of files, and now the free space has gone down to 640MB, and then went up to 690MB. This is without doing anything major. Over the past few days, almost all of what I've done is on the internet.\nIs this some type of malware (though I thought malware usually deleted stuff), and how can I see why this is happening, and what recently has been taking up so much room. (I've just switched my PC to ubuntu and it has something called Disk Examiner which shows you what is taking up the most room, is there something like that for Mac?)\n\nA: Checking the space\nYou can use OmniDiskSweeper to check what is occupied your space. It's free.\nOr, if you like command-line, run Terminal.app and enter this:\ndu -kx /some/directory | sort -nr > $HOME/DiskUsage.txt\nless $HOME/DiskUsage.txt\n\nyou will get sorted size-list (in kB) for all directories under the /some/directory.\nSwap files\nAnother check - swap file. If your apps take more memory as you have, the OS do \"swap\" parts of memory into HDD. (In the linux or FreeBSD there are usually dedicated HDD partitions (slices) but on OS X these are files.\nYou can check their size with:\nls -l /private/var/vm\n\nyou will get something like the next:\ntotal 12582912\n-rw------T  1 root  wheel  4294967296 23 jún 14:30 sleepimage\n-rw-------  1 root  wheel    67108864 15 jún 09:03 swapfile0\n-rw-------  1 root  wheel    67108864 23 jún 14:54 swapfile1\n-rw-------  1 root  wheel   134217728 23 jún 14:54 swapfile2\n-rw-------  1 root  wheel   268435456 23 jún 14:54 swapfile3\n-rw-------  1 root  wheel   536870912 23 jún 14:54 swapfile4\n-rw-------  1 root  wheel  1073741824 23 jún 14:54 swapfile5\n\nAs you can see, in my HDD are now 5 swapfiles with total size 2GB. When start too much programs (or have 50 browser windows or soo) sometimes the swap increases up 5 GB or more. Simply close applications and the swap will be freed.\nThe another 4GB file (sleepimage) is the space, where OS X store its memory content when going to sleep (SafeSleep - storing memory content in the file). While it is possible turn of the SafeSleep and get 4GB HDD space (or less, if you have less memory) via pmset command, i do not recommend this.\nBrowser\nWhen you browsing a lot, Safari storing some content into his cache/files. You can partially clear from the menu: Safari -> Empty Cache\nOr simply check your cache files in the $HOME/Library/Caches with the OmniDiskSweeper or the du -kx $HOME/Library/Caches | sort -nr command from the Terminal.\nYou can Trash everything from the $HOME/Library/Caches without problems, but (for the safe) is better relog or reboot after the delete.\nLogfiles\nAnother space-waste can be the Logfiles. You can check them with your Console.app (Utilities). (in the bottom left corner it showing the current size) - You can trash a big ones from the application directly.\n\nA: To find out what takes up space, you can use Disk Inventory X, http://www.derlien.com/, which is free, or DaisyDisk, http://www.daisydiskapp.com/, also in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: I agree with all of the above and I've had great luck with Disk Inventory to identify how many large files were quietly sitting there including many duplicates.  \nI can only add a number of suggestions of other small things that might collectively help you recover HD space.  \nI'm not sure what OS you're running but Snow leopard used 4 Gb less HD space that Leopard on my iMac.\niDVD and GarageBand are very large applications and you could uninstall them if you don't use them.  If you do use them, they have large folders with templates so possibly you could delete some of these templates.\nCheck activity monitor for memory pages outs.  This is similar to Windows pagefile and if this number is high, it means you're consuming HD space when there isn't enough ram to manage everything that is running on your machine.  Add more ram,   page outs goes down and frees up HD space.\nCheck to see if the Login Items that start automatically are really apps that you need to run automatically.  Go to system preferences, accounts, login items and delete any that aren't required by highlighting the app and clicking on the minus sign.  This can free up ram and reduce page outs.\nReduce the number of widgets in dashboard.  Collectively they may have grown and can consume ram and in turn generate extra page outs.  On my laptop, I had 12 and now get by with 2.\nSpotlight automatically indexes almost your entire drive.  Open system preferences, spotlight and de-select the items that you can exclude from indexing.  I reduced my indexing from 14 categories to just 7.\nIn addition to the main Trash bin, mail and iPhoto have dedicated trash bins to be emptied.  I never knew iPhoto had its own trash and recovered almost 1gb when I emptied the iPhoto trash.\n\nA: The one thing to remember is that MacOS is a Unix variant, and these kinds of systems use considerable amounts of disk space as system cache. In fact, even if you run out of physical ram, your system doesn't see this and immediately starts using available disk space to handle active tasks. It can be that just by running, you're using up that space. \nTypically for a Mac, you should always keep at least 5-7GB free, to handle memory requests, caching, swapping in and out, etc. 1GB is asking for trouble...you might also notice that the machine starts going slower and slower, especially now that it needs to search for available blocks of open space, randomly scattered across your disk. \nI would suggest a few things:\n• Back everything up now. I bought a 2GB external drive for €70, partitioned it for Time machine and File backup, and backed-up the disk (in one partition) and the files via Time Machine in the other. \n• Use an application like Snow Leopard Cache Cleaner to run through the system and flush caches and delete extra languages and old PPC-based code in apps. That will free up some space. \n• Try to clean off your disk so there's at least 10Gb free on the boot disk. Back up any large files to an external disk...OS X will automatically run in the background and defrag any files under 20MB on the fly, but you can use Snow Leopard Cache Cleaner to Optimize files afterwards. Move old, large files off (like an iTunes library) clean up the drive, and then migrate the important files back.  \nYou shouldn't need to reinstall anything - just don't let the drive fill-up!\n", "Q: Where can I download previous version of itunes? I am looking to download previous version of iTunes (iTunes 10.2.2).

How to do get the .ipa on my iPhone?\n\nA: You can use the iPhone Configuration Utility to side-load apps onto an iOS device without 'syncing' and erasing your current content.\nConfig Utility for Mac\nConfig Utility for Windows\nKeep in mind, though, that this will only work if the app is correctly codesigned and the device is correctly provisioned.\n\nA: You don't. Apple doesn't enable you to install ipas separately. If its downloaded from the appstore you can re download it directly on the device. Also, you cannot install ipas that are connected to your friends account, as they containcryptographic keys unavailable to you if you never downloaded the app.\n\nA: If you have bought the app with your own iTunes account, you can simply open the App Store-App on your device, go to \"Updates\", choose \"Purchased articles\" and choose \"Not On This iPhone\".

Deleting one of the plist files not all of them can sometimes leave the preference pane in a state of confusion.\nStep one is to get some change, then re-enable the automated change part.\n\nA: I discovered that the PathFinder application is the cause. Under its application menu there's a Show/Hide PathFinder Desktop item. I hid the PathFinder desktop and problem solved. It seems that the PathFinder desktop doesn't properly reflect the System Preferences. While it shows the first picture in the selected folder so it looks like your changes have taken effect, it seems to ignore the \"Change Picture\" checkbox.\nI think this must have broken in a recent update as it used to work, which is why I didn't flag the presence of PathFinder above.

I have a household with mostly Apple products with a Cisco base station. I was wondering if I can use an Airport Express as a range extender. If it works, it would be very attractive for me since I could also use it to play music from my iPhone through it.\n\nA: I would say without doing the research on the specific model (generation) of Airport and the specifics on the firmware on the Cisco device - they may work but it's certainly not guaranteed.\nIt's almost inconceivable the first part would fail. The express will join almost any network and AirTunes will work as long as it is in range.\nThe extending is where you want to do your homework if you need that to work as well to not be disappointed with a purchase. WDS is the main standard - so be sure you read up on the Apple WDS documentation as well as whatever Cisco provides.\nWDS in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad protocol, but it makes your network much more complicated and much more likely to fail since any one part failing cascades to the rest. Many people (even professionals) have lost days to trying to make WDS work and maintain/troubleshoot it when problems arise.\n", "Q: How do you add books to the Kindle app for iOS? I might be overlooking something very obvious here but I cannot see any of the books I add to the Kindle app. Listed below are the steps I follow to add the books. \n1. Connect the iPod Touch to my Windows computer and start iTunes.\n2. On iTunes, go to the Apps Section of iPod Touch.\n3. Using the new file transfer system with the iOS 4 (see screenshot), add the PDF and epub file type.\n\n-And voila, that should have done it.\n-But when I check the Kindle app on the iPod Touch, it only has the three default books it came with when I downloaded the app. (See screenshot below screenshot)\nI'm sure this is some error on my part but can't figure out what.\n\n\n\nA: The Kindle iphone app does not read pdf or epub files without conversion. \nThere are various tools you can use to convert from pdf and epub to the mobi format that the Kindle app can read. The one I use is Calibre, and it works pretty well. Epub files generally convert without problem, but pdf files might be harder, depending on how complex the pdf is. If there are pictures or columns you are probably in trouble.\n\nA: The simplest solution is not to use the Kindle reader for epub or pdf files, but instead of use iBooks for those.  It will display both of them very well without any conversion required, and it's free.\n", "Q: How can I tell OS X to flag a name as being misspelled? I have a co-worked whose name is Jennett. In Pages, I added her to my local dictionary (located at ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary) by right-clicking on her name and choosing Learn Spelling.\nHowever, OS X is not flagging Jennet with one \"t\" as being misspelled. \nHow can I make Jennet with one \"t\" be flagged as being misspelled?\nI assume this problem stems from the fact that jennet—a female donkey—is found in the OS X dictionary. However, given that I don't write much about donkeys, let alone female donkeys, I'd prefer to be notified when I'm misspelling a co-workers name.\n\nA: Removing words from the built-in dictionary is apparently more difficult than I thought it would be. Since your question is about how to prevent a particular misspelling of your co-worker's name, I have an alternate solution.\nYou can add \"Jennet\" to Mac OS X's text substitution list in System Preferences -> Language & Text -> Text\n\nIt will automatically correct the spelling for you each time you misspell it. You could add other variant misspellings for completeness, like \"Jenet\" or even make it auto-capitalize \"jennett\", but since most other misspelling variants don't have obscure English homonyms these will show up as misspellings.\n", "Q: How to fix apps \"waiting..\" forever after sync? I've got roughly 5 apps on my iPhone. \nThen I went to iTunes and downloaded 15+ apps. After that, I synced them to the phone and it says \"Sync Complete\", but the apps on my phone are showing \"Waiting..\".\nI've waited for over a day and the apps are still showing \"Waiting..\".\nWhat may be the problem here, and how can it be fixed?\n\nA: The springboard controls the layout of apps on iOS and is confused.\nGenerally, it's not a deep corruption of the database (which you fix by restoring the phone, setting up as new and installing things again from scratch) so here are some things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on airplane mode in Settings app (tells the download process to chill)\n\n*Restart the device (more chilling - starts fresh, frees up RAM)\n\n*Connect to iTunes\n\n\nThen you should be able to deselect the problem app (removing all traces of the attempted download) and then finally put that app on the device. The airplane mode is the most important thing since the device will try to fix itself and lock iTunes out until it realizes it can't. Once you have gotten the stuck app resolved, turn off Airplane mode to resume calls, data and WiFi service. If it doesn't resolve, you may have to erase the phone and restore it from a backup or anew.\n\nA: same issue for times...\ni just reset all setting and erased all data and restored and it fixed\n", "Q: Is there a way to send a growl notification when an application reaches a certain memory threshold? I've been noticing that Safari skyrockets in terms of memory usage. I've been getting some results by restarting it, but I'm wondering if there is an app or some easy script to run that would send a growl notification (or some other sort of notification) to inform me that it has reached, let's say 200MB, and then I would know that it might be time to restart it.\n\nA: If you will run any \"monitoring\" program, will consume memory. My Safari after the restart occupiing 128MB RAM, now when writing this reply has 156MB - so 200MB will gain realy soon. I have usually 600+MB Safari and it is not problem (i have 4GB RAM).\nDo you really want restart it after 200MB?\nYou can for example run the next shell script:\n#!/bin/bash\nmymax=200000       #in kb\ncheckinterval=60   #in seconds\n\nwhile :\ndo\n    ops=($(ps axu | grep Safari | grep -v grep))\n    [[ ${ops[5]:-0} > $mymax ]] && growlnotify -a \"Safari\" -m \"memory; ${ops[5]}\"\n    sleep $checkinterval\ndone\n\nwill every minute check your Safary memory usage. When the resident ram usage (rss) exceeds 200 kb the growl message will appear. For this you must have installed the \"growlnotify\" shell command from the Growl installation image -> Extras.\nYou can save the above into \"safariwarn.command\" and double click on it from the Finder. (will run as Terminal.app)\nOr, it is possible run as an application what you can make with the Automator.app.\n\nA: I found someone's brilliant solution to this exact request over on MacHints.\nIt's a four year old post, but the method should still work.\n", "Q: Make iTunes handle albums with different artists I'm a big fan of ocremix.org and I have quite a few tracks from that community. However, when looking at my music in Album view, it seems to be fairly arbitrary as to how it combines artist and album name when creating its groupings.\nIs there a way to force iTunes to combine all songs with the same album name into the same album in album view, regardless of the artist? Ideally I'd like to have a single ocremix.org album which I could open up and sort by artist.\nAlso, ocremix.org has a convention when multiple artists are participating in a single track to list them all out, separated by commas. Can iTunes handle this in some way?\n\nA: Select all the files you want to combine, make a right click and select \"Information\", go to tab \"Options\" and set \"part of a compilation\" to yes...\n\nA: This blog article deals exhaustively of this specific topic : http://www.blisshq.com/music-library-management-blog/2011/03/26/five-ways-organize-various-artist-compilations/\nTo sum up :\n  - as stated by strauberry, declare all files part of a compilation\n  - decide of a string that define your various artists albums (something such as 'Various') and set it as 'album artist' tag value\n  - keep compilation, album name, year and album artist tags identical\n", "Q: Video Container for 1080p video for SD DVD (using Apple suite) This may be a bit of a stretch to post here (in terms of whether people will have an answer), since this is a fairly specific question about video work, although I am performing the entirety of this work within FCP 7, Compressor, and DVD Studio Pro.\nI have 2 hours of footage edited from a HD Camcorder in FCP 7, and I need to get it onto a DVD. I want to use the highest quality container I can, and I want to be able to author and preferably burn the DVD within DVD Studio Pro. Unfortunately, DVDSP doesn't support MPEG-4, which is one of the nicest containers to put 1080p video into. It supports MPEG, which offers considerably less options for compression, and data rates.\nUltimately, my question is HOW can I export my video out of FCP (or Compressor) so that I'm sitting on a high quality file that will fit on one DVD and be compatible with DVD Studio Pro (4.7GB)? I just finished a 24 hour Compressor job with the default setting \"HD DVD 60 minutes\", but it gave me a 5.1GB file, which is of no use to me. The aspect ratio is also forced and it looks terrible.\nHELP!\n\nA: Just to get this 'answered' for anyone else who might come across this question.\nThere is no way to get 1080p or 1080i video onto a DVD. DVD's only support SD images (this goes for the disks themselfs, and the players). \nYou can however use BluRay to burn HD video, though this would require a BluRay burner and a BluRay player. \nHave a look here for more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video\n\nA: SD dvd only works with mpeg-2, and doesn't support HD signal, export your video as SD 16:9 from compressor, if you want HD on a disk has to be blu-ray\n", "Q: How can I find out what is deleting my ~/.Trash folder?

I have two Snow Leopard machines to upgrade, and considering the draconian data caps we have down here in New Zealand, I'm trying to avoid having to perform 8GB of downloads in order to upgrade them both.\nIs this possible, or is it a limitation of the architecture that a shared app has to be downloaded via the AppStore on both machines?\n\nA: Technically, the press says it will be possible and supported for businesses and schools, but you may need to pay for volume licenses. It's just not yet clear if this will be economical or feasible for individual consumers.\nIn general, you will have to download each purchase once for each mac. Updates will come up as small delta packages to reduce the load on you as well as Apple. Lion itself seems to be getting extra handling as a special case.\n\nA: Although it's a little early to tell (things may change until the final release, but it's unlikely) you should be able to download the Installer-App just once and use it to create a bootable DVD for other Macs.\n\nA: When you purchase a game or any other product from the Mac App Store, you can download it to several computers. Just log in using the same Apple I.D on the other computers and there is the option to re-download, so I suppose it will be the same for Lion 10.7 when it comes out. \n\n", "Q: In Safari, is there any keyboard shortcut to *hide* the Web Inspector?

Why does my MBP sometimes report VM Size: 300+ GB in Activity Monitor under System Memory tab, when my hard disk size is only 250 GB (total) and RAM is 4GB? I know it can't magically get that extra space, but what is it trying to tell me?\n\nA: It's all imaginary since virtual memory doesn’t need to exist until a program stores something specific. In this case, some combination of programs is saying to the OS they might some day use that much space. Don't worry unless:\n\n*\n\n*the swap space grows past your ram size\n\n*active + wired ram is greater than 75% of physical RAM. (3GB in your\ncase)\n\nBasically, this idea makes memory handling faster as the system is running. Since programs keep asking for more and more memory, the system lays out un-mapped chunks of virtual RAM with tons of space in between each process' allocation. This makes some very common memory calculations easier and faster and makes it very unlikely that the regions will ever overlap. When virtual memory regions overlap, it's more costly to pause things and re-map the memory under a running program.  All this mental olympics involving virtual memory makes your mac run faster.\n\nA: Shared libraries and frameworks are counted as part of the virtual memory for every application that uses them. \nIf you have 100 processes running on your computer, and a 5 MB library used by all those processes, then that library is counted as 500 MB of virtual memory. \nYou can also add up the numbers in the Virtual Memory column of the process list – a more accurate name for that column is \"Virtual Private Memory\". It does not include shared data.\n\n100 processes is not as high a number as it sounds (I currently have 75 on my MBP, and I am running much less than usual). \nSome libraries are used by almost every application on your system, even ones without interfaces. After adding up all of the shared libraries on your system, you have a large amount of data that actually takes very little memory. \nAs bmike mentioned, you should be more worried about the swap space, or active+wired ram. Right now, Activity Monitor tells me that I have 170 GB of virtual memory, but I'm only using 1.5 MB of swap space. \n", "Q: How do I uninstall Xcode?

Although I keep my system time & date in check using time.asia.apple.com, I can't \"Set time zone automatically using current location\". I get the error message, \"Unable to determine current location at this time\" every time I try this.\n\nDoes anyone know why this is happening?\nThanks.\n\nA: Apple uses one or more databases (I don't know how many) to map your ISP internet connection to a location in the world.\nIf you use the network utility to traceroute to that time server, you will see all the routers between you and that apple server. This software does the same thing and reports the hops - if Apple knows where any of the routers close to your mac are located, it will update the location. What it's telling you is it can't pin down where you are based on this information only.\nIf you can try connecting to a different network or a public network it might be more likely to know where you are. Many business internet connections pool the public internet access and the database is told to ignore that since the traffic isn't coming to apple close to your physical location.\nAre you on a home network? Can you call your ISP to see if they allow or prevent location of their customers? It's a problem with the people supplying you with internet and not anything on your computer, so you can't do anything directly to correct it other than change your ISP or figure out how to get it mapped.\n\nA: Had the same issue after traveling, and as @bmike mentioned, Apple uses your router to map your location.\nIn my case, the network location profile had some sort of an issue, and to fix it, all I had to do was create a new profile and restart.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences.\n\n*Select Network.\n\n*Click on the Location: Automatic dropdown.\n\n\n\n*Click on Edit Locations....\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click the + sign in the bottom left corner.\n\n*Add a new profile, and call it Home (or something else).\n\n*Select the new profile you created.\n\n*Click Done.\n\n*Click Apply.\n\n*Restart the device.\nThis will be as if you just registered a new device on the router, and the device will be able to grab the location again.\nIf that doesn't work, try changing the network, and redoing the whole thing again.\n\nA: Judging by the screenshot this appears to merely be a cosmetic issue. There is a location pin, a time zone and also a closest city.\nUnless you are not at that location, of course.\n\nA: I had a similar issue in mac os Catalina when I traveled to different time zone, it doesn't able to recognize the new timezone. later I opened the maps app, clicked on \"show your current location\" it was able to recognize my location, after that when I opened Date&Time, the error message disappeared, it was able to recognize the timezone.  \n", "Q: RAM Disk gets unmounted when coming out of sleep I have a script set up to create a RAM Disk at login.

It just ends up being writes and reads wearing on the SSD that don't need to be. So I wrote a script to create the SSD and required folders and placed symlinks in my Cache folder for my browsers. \nIt works 100% perfectly until I put the machine to sleep. Then when it wakes up the disk disappears, but somehow the browsers continue working without problems, but there is no indication that they are still writing to RAM or the SSD because no files seem to appear where they should be. If I recreate the RAM Disk, it is blank of course, but Chrome/Firefox/Safari won't start using it until I restart them.\nSo alternatively, is there a way to run a shell script after the computer wakes up? Maybe I could just recreate the RAM Disk when it wakes up again and hope for the best.\nOr maybe I should just scrap the whole thing.\n\nA: I've similar workflows around a ramdisk so I notice the same issue. I check and re-check the Energy preferences to no avail, so I started messing with the hibernatemode in pmset.\nIts default is 3 in Snow Leopard & Lion, and it's not a problem until Lion. Now I've change it to 0. The difference is that no system image is written on disk, so that while sleeping, if my MBP ran out of juice, all will be gone but this drawback is negated by Lion's Resume feature.\nNow, it seems my ramdisk stays around during/after sleep... See if you notice similar.\n\nA: I just came across this.

You can even manipulate files if you keep the assigned mouse button held in (i.e. you could grab some files and put them in the Trash; or you could attach a document to a Gmail email; etc.)\n\nNB: I just noticed that you were already aware of this technique via a touchpad swipe. Nonetheless, I'll leave it up here as an answer as mapping it to a mouse button is something I can't live without.\n\nThe other way to do this in a more 'permanent' fashion would be to use the ⌥⌘H combo. This, too, can be mapped to a mouse button as you can see below:\n\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\n\nA: No, there is no such functionality, but if you want to interact with desktop (as opposed to just taking a quick peek which can be done with Exposé's Show Desktop function) you actually want to have Finder active with no windows showing, here's how to get there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to Finder: ⌘+⇥ necessary number of times\n\n*Hide all the other apps: ⌘+⌥+H\n\n*Close all Finder windows: ⌘+⌥+W\n1.&2. can be done by ⌘+⌥-clicking on Finder icon in dock.\nI usually have Spaces turned on, so whenever I want to reach the desktop without closing everything I just switch to a fresh space.\n\nA: ⌘+F3\nThis should work great.\n", "Q: Skype with bluetooth headset on MacBook Pro I have AKG K830BT bluetooth headset which works perfectly with my MacBook Pro (Mac OS X 10.6.7). The only problem is while using Skype. It looks like Skype wants to use my built-it speakers disregarding the BT headset which is already successfully paired. So the result is that I can head system signals (e.g. a sound assigned to the activity of closing a Skype conversation window) in my headset but not the conversation.\nIs there any fix for this?\n\nA: In Skype's Audio/Video preferences you need to see the microphone and speaker source to the BlueTooth headset in order for Skype to use them. So CMD-` to open Skype preferences, click the 'Audio/Video' tab icon and then check your settings.\nIn my own Skype install you can see I have to set it to use my Plantronics .520 headset if I want to use that for input or output:\n\n", "Q: Control iTunes remotely on 10.3.9 (or maximum 10.4.11) I have this sweet old iMac 350 Mhz sitting in my dusty cellar.\nFilled with nostalgia I've fired it up and it is still working :)\nThinking about how to use it, since it has no fans and good integrated audio, I'd love to use it as stereo system in the bathroom or any other room...\nI would like to use it without keyboard and mouse and control completely itunes from my android device (or maybe another windows pc).\nMax system I can get on the buddy is 10.3.9 or with worse performance 10.4.11\nAny hints?\n\nA: I think the trouble you're going to run in to is that much of the remote control software for iTunes out there, especially for the smartphone market, requires an iTunes version that support Digital Audio Control Protocol (DACP, aka \"Home Sharing\"). Not sure you can get to an iTunes version that supports DACP if your highest OS level is 10.4.11.\nFor control from another Mac I highly recommend TuneConnect. Very cool little program that lets you remote control iTunes on another Mac from your current Mac. Even streams the cover art and playlist back to the remote app. It uses a daemon approach to controlling iTunes so it works with older, non-home sharing capable, iTunes installations. There's also the simpler iTunes Remote Control which works over Bonjour IIRC -- not quite as fancy, but it gets the job done. Both of those are free.\nFor control from an iPhone Apple has it's own iTunes Remote you can download from the iOS App Store for free. Works well. Requires home sharing be turned on in iTunes -- so you might be out of luck there if you can't run the latest iTunes on your older iMac.\nFor an Android device there's TunesRemote (which uses the home sharing protocol, so it requires a newer iTunes installation). TunesRemote is free and open source. There's also Remote for iTunes which also relies on DCAP and costs $5.\nFor control from a non-Mac machine your best bet is probably still VNC. Just get a remote desktop on the Mac and click away. I couldn't find anything that solves this particular problem. I'll admit I didn't look that hard. :)\n", "Q: How do I disable the \"fn + F8\" shortcut? As I need to use the fn + F8 shortcut within my virtual machine, I'd like to disable it in my host. \nHow do I go about disabling this particular shortcut, so that it can be used within my VM?\n\nA: Try installing KeyRemap4MacBook.

I currently use the official iTunes scrobbler, but it seems to drop data.\nWhat are the best iOS scrobblers for a jailbroken and a non-jailbroken device? I can't download the official Last.fm app because of stupid geographical restrictions.\n\nA: Get CloudScrob.\nFinally there is an app that ACTUALLY WORKS AND SCROBBLES CORRECTLY.\nThis app is the best scrobbler there is for iPhone, and I've tried a bunch of them. It scrobbles in batch mode after you've listened to a bunch of songs, and lets you preview and edit the list of songs before it submits them.\nAnd you use the iPod app to play the songs. Unlike iScrob where you had to use that app to play the songs.\n\nA: I am using the new ex.fm app, which does scrobble to last.fm for me. The ex.fm app is brand new, so the twitter integration is off and on, but last.fm scrobbling of the ex.fm streaming songs is working very reliably. It doesn't scrobble my iPod songs that are on the device yet - so I don't know if that's intended, a temporary service issue, or a bug needing a new build of the app.\n\nA: Your local songs on your device should scrobble to last.fm if you're playing them through the exfm app and have the newest version of the app. \n\nA: Track 8\n..is nice. It's a player based on the Metro UI of the Windows 8 and it supports last.fm s scrobbling.\nThe following is from the app description:\n\n♪ Scrobble your tracks to Last.FM, and share \"Now Playing\" tweets right from Track 8.\n♪ View background images of artists from Last.fm\n\n\nA: You can try my app QuietScrob, it's only for iOS 7 but scrobbles in background.\n\nA: I've been working on a way to Scrobble from the official Google Play Music app. It's still a work in progress and it requires a Jailbroken iPhone, but it works! \nhttps://github.com/octalmage/LastGoogle\n", "Q: Strange OS X desktop animation I've noticed a strange animation on the desktop of my January 2007 Macbook Pro.

I don't know how it's handled in India but in the US, the carriers charge extra for this.  Of course, here in Canada, the carriers provide it for free provided your data plan isn't one of the minimal ones.\nSo perhaps the problem is that you are not entitled to use it by virtue of not having paid for it?\n\nA: The same had happened to me (Germany, O2). \nLast year, after I had used the Personal Hotspot (WiFi)once, it disappeared from the menu.\nRecently (new iOS, O2 officially supporting the iPhone by now), Personal Hotspot (the bluetooth thing, actually) worked for 2 minutes or so, then went dead. Technically it is still there but I woun't get anything through to the net.\nI think it's something like this (not sure though):\nThe first time you use the personal hotspot, your phone checks with your provider wether it allows to share you mobile internet connection to other devices. If not, it then disables it.\nIf this is correct, the option should reappear when you purchase a 'shareable' data plan.\nMay need some kind of reset though, aswell.\n\nA: Ensure that your Data Roaming (located in Cellular under general settings) is turned on.

If it doesn't (i.e., I plug it in and nothing happens -- no disk is mounted, device is invisible to Disk Utility), my options appear to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the disk without unmounting, hopefully not wiping it in the process.\n\n*Reboot my computer, removing the device after the power-cycle.\n\n\nI'm a journalist who uses this thing for interviews. It's only happened once, but after a number of times unplugging it without rebooting, the device decided it needed to be formatted -- requiring me to run disk recovery software to save the files I needed that day for my story.\nWhile this is a big enough nuisance that I'm considering buying a new recorder, I could probably get by if I knew a way of ejecting the device without potentially compromising my data.\nHow does one safely eject disks that haven't mounted properly?\nThanks!\n\nA: Mac OS X does have built-in read/write support for FAT32, and read support for NTFS, so it should be able to at least see any Windows-formatted volumes. That said, it's possible that Finder/Disk Utility cannot see it, but the system might still know that it's there and something is connected, so we might be able to safely unmount it via the command line.\nTo see if that's the case, open up Terminal, and type\ndiskutil list. This will output a list of all the volumes connected to the system, even if they're not mounted. They'll appear under a header showing what physical disk they're connected to. In the example below, diskutil is able to see a disk with a NTFS Bootcamp partition, as well as an HFS+ partition.\n\n/dev/disk3  \n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER  \n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk3  \n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk3s1  \n   2:                  Apple_HFS mmotm                   409.0 GB   disk3s2  \n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                90.8 GB    disk3s3\n\nTo eject the pesky device, type in diskutil eject disk# substituting the # for the actual disk number (the part that appears after /dev/).\nThis has worked for me in similar situations.\n\nA: If the device is completeley invisible to Disk Utility, it is most likeley not detected by the OS and not being used, so unplugging it shouldnt do any harm. Yet, if you want to be completeley sure you dont loose any files, I suggest you shut down your computer. \nRegarding compatiblity, if it's supposed to be detected as a disk, and it does work on Windows this way, it most likely is a NFTS disk. You should be able to check the format on a Windows PC. Plug it in, and if its an ejectable disk check its properties. (Its a long time since I don't use windows, but I think it should tell you there, somewhere, if its an NFTS disk or not).\nIn case it is, here is a free NFTS driver for mac:\nhttp://macntfs-3g.blogspot.com/\nwhich should allow NFTS drives to be read by the OS. There are also paid alternatives, which offer increased performance and security to your files, but just for accessing a recorder, this should be enough.\nHope it helps!\nKevin\n", "Q: How do I prevent document preview over slow connections? Once in a while I have to work over a 3G network, which is reasonable, until I mount a file system on the other side of the world.\nWhen that happens OSX tries to show me \"previews\" of every single document in the finder, an operation which takes forever because it usually tries to download the entire document in order to generate the preview. After spending hours downloading a 5 MB file, it often decides, \"oh gosh, I don't know how to show thumbnails of Word files. I'll just show you a Word icon.\" In the meantime Finder is in bouncing-ball-hell for hours.\nIs there a way to prevent this specifically for network shares when I'm connected over a slow connection? Or, failing that, just prevent document preview for all network documents?\n\nA: The nuclear option: quit the Finder (use Activity Monitor, save an AppleScript containing the code tell application \"Finder\" to quit, or kill it from a shell prompt) and then use Terminal to do your file manipulation.  (Type open myfile.txt to open a file in the default app, like the Finder would if you double-clicked it.)\n\nA: Unless someone can find a hidden setting, you may want to look into PathFinder which has a preference to disable previews on network volumes. Also, for slow shares that can be accessed through ssh/sftp Transmit by Panic is more responsive than Finder.\nI use Transmit more often than PathFinder, but find having responsive network performance when on dial up or slow 3G more than worth the cognitive load of a slightly different interface.\n+1 to Siracusa for killall Finder and terminal workarounds.\n\nA: Actually, killing the finder is not enough in really slow networks or when folders contain thousands upon thousands of files (something common in work networks with a \"public\" folder).\nIn those cases killing the finder will result in the finder closing but never reopening properly. It's as if a background process that tries to parse it all gets disconnected but doesn't disappear, preventing the Finder from moving further.\nIn that sense it's similar to this:\nFinder becomes unresponsive when viewing network folders with large amounts of files (OSX 10.6.8)\n\nA: You can disable Icon preview in the view settings.\nFor example: right click the desktop and select \"Show view option\" and then uncheck the last box.\n\n\nA: As a follow-up to John Siracusa's answer, the shell equivalent to the AppleScript would be osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to quit'.\n\nA: I haven't seen a way to disable icon preview just for network connections, but you can disable it for specific folders or for all of Finder.  http://www.bombippy.com/archives/2008/02/how_to_disable.php\n", "Q: Google Chrome repeatedly displays monospaced fonts wrong as “Times New Roman” I observe an extremely annoying font problem in Google Chrome for Mac. When I visit a page like GitHub or Bitbucket (which use monospaced fonts, e.g. for code) I see the HTML sections that are meant to be displayed in a monospaced font displayed in “Times New Roman”. This pretty much makes these sites useless for me.\nI found a blog post that describes a similar problem and which suggests to clear Mac OS X’s font caches with these terminal commands:\n$ sudo atsutil databases -remove\n$ atsutil server -shutdown\n$ atsutil server -ping\n\nThis eliminates the problem but it only lasts until I restart the computer. I would have to issue these commands every time before I start Google Chrome after a computer restart to have monospaced fonts on these sites display correctly.\nFor clarification here are two screenshots that display the problem.\nThis is how it looks before I remove the font caches:\n\nThis is how it looks after the font caches have been cleared and how it should look:\n\nDoes anyone know of this problem and can provide a solution?\n\nA: I have been using Linotypes Font Explorer for quite some time now. There is a free version which is great. I have found less font issues on my Macs since using this app than with Suitcase, Fontbook or Fontcase, particularly with web sites. Once installed you can run a font cleaner which examines all your volumes on your Mac and eliminate sang potential problems\n\nA: Hmmm... I loaded this page as a test – I'm using version 23 of Chrome – and the text is being formatted correctly. Not in Courier, mind you, but in Menlo (which is effectively a revamped version of Monaco).\nYou may want to check Chrome's font settings – paste chrome://settings/fonts#font into the address bar – and see what it has decided to use as its fixed-width font. Curiously, in my case it seems to think that it should be using Courier, but (as I mentioned earlier) it actually uses Menlo instead.\n\nA: Just wanted to chime in here and say that not only did this exact issue hit me (Github showing with Times New Roman), but long after I fixed it the first time around (several months ago) I had an interesting regression. Tonight I pulled up Github to find this:\n\nI assume that this is due to Bitstream somehow getting clobbered in the font cache (as opposed to it not being installed the first time this happened).  Luckily the CLI commands to reset the cache posted by the OP still worked great for me (after also restarting Chrome).\nDoesn't answer the question about why this happens, but hopefully this answer might provide a little more info if anyone else hits this same bizarre issue.\n\nA: Try re-downloading the font you need into the Font Book.  Then it should work.  If the problem persists, try going through the settings in your browser.\n", "Q: iPad app supporting RemoteApp RDP protocol?

When I drink a beer I enjoy I like to snap a photo of it with my iPhone. I keep an event in iPhoto called Beer and in to this event go all those photos I snap.\nOver time the Beer event has started to get lost among all my other iPhoto events. The ones of the kids and wife, the relatives, the sunsets I'll never remember to look at again. So when I have a new picture of some beer I enjoyed to add to the all-important Beer event, finding that event and dragging the handful of photos in to it has gotten to be tedious.\nI do try to keep the Beer event at the end of my event list. So it's nearest newly added events when I import photos from my phone. But that doesn't always work out and, of course, I'd rather not have to remember to reorder Beer to the end of my event list every single time I import photos.\nI've tried cutting and pasting after import. But that still seems to require that find the Beer event by scrolling up and down through the Event view in iPhoto. Not something I enjoy.\nI can use the search box to search for \"beer\" and I do see the photos from that event, but I can't do anything meaningful with the search results like paste a lone phone in to the found event named Beer. The way the search results are listed is really as individual photos. I don't see a way to limit the search to events by names that I can then click down in to like I normally would in the Event view.\nI feel like I'm missing some fundamentally easy way to shuffle photos between random events in iPhoto. A click and 'move to event' type deal that would whisk away my favourite beverage photos to their safe home in my electronic memory.\n\nA: Perhaps doesn't directly answer your question, but sounds like you ought to consider creating a Beer album, rather than using a Beer event.\niPhoto Events are really designed for arranging temporally-related photos, i.e. photos that were taken in a similar time period. Albums are better for storing contextually-related photos, i.e. photos of the same thing over any period of time. \nAlbums work like iTunes playlists, in that the same photo can appear in multiple albums, or in no albums at all. (But it has to appear in exactly one event.) Albums are always visible in your sidebar, so you can easily drag photos from any event (including your \"Latest Import\" event, for example) into any album at any time.\nAll that said, somebody here could probably quickly whip up a little AppleScript for you that automates your current process. But not me :)\n", "Q: VMware fusion's Windows 7 takes long time to shut down (sometimes hang) I'm using Mac OS X 10.6.7 and VMware Fusion 3.1.3. I have Windows 7 on my VMware Fusion. \nSometimes it takes a very long time (30+ minutes) to shut down and sometimes forever (hang with the spinning curser saying it's shutting down..).  If I force quite VMware (and Win 7), the next time I start Windows 7 on VMware fusion it will take a very long time to start (15+ minutes), although it doesn't hang. \nWhat is wrong? I think there's something I need to clean up but don't know where.\n\n\nA: Upgrading to Fusion 4 will help some, but whether you upgrade or not, read VMware support article 1022625 to learn about the things that could be causing slowdowns and what you can do about them.  \nIn particular, I recommend you follow the instructions labeled \"Edit the virtual machine settings to reduce I/O usage by using more host memory\":\n\nAdd the following lines to the virtual machine's settings ( .vmx) file:\n\nMemTrimRate = \"0\"\nsched.mem.pshare.enable = \"FALSE\"\nprefvmx.useRecommendedLockedMemSize = \"TRUE\"\n\nIn short, Fusion's code base derives from a server environment where one server is running many, many virtual machines which all are using the same OS. That code base implements several strategies to allocate less host memory to an individual VM than the VM thinks it needs.  These settings turn those strategies off, which is a good thing for Fusion where you're typically running only one VM at a time.  In particular,  sched.mem.pshare.enable = \"FALSE\" turns off sharing pages of memory using copy-on-write, which does not work well the way Fusion uses it on MacOS and causes insane delays shutting down VMs which use large amounts of memory. \nI also recommend adding this to your VMX file at the same time:\n# Do not allow VM memory to be swapped\nPrefvmx.minVmMemPct = \"100\"\n\nI've asked VMware to make these settings the defaults for Fusion, but I'm not holding my breath.  Until then, I manually add them to every VM I create, because, unfortunately, putting these changes in user- or system-wide config files seems not to have any effect.\n", "Q: How can I tell if my iMac's hard drive is dying? A couple of days ago, my three-year-old iMac locked up.  When I rebooted it, it only displayed a folder icon with a flashing question mark.  After a couple more reboot attempts, it booted. I ran Disk Utility, which told me that the file system was corrupted and needed repair.\nI booted with my Snow Leopard DVD, did a repair with Disk Utility, and now everything seems fine.\nMy questions: Should I be worried about my drive?  Should I go ahead and replace it now, or wait to see whether there are any more problems?\n(FWIW, I've already purchased a replacement drive, and plan to replace it at some point. I'm really wondering whether I should do it as soon as possible, or whether it can wait until I have nothing better to do on a weekend.)\n\nA: Short answers to your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some concern over the drive is good, noticing there may be an issue and proactively thinking about what could happen is a good place to start. If you don't already, I would make a backup/clone of the entire drive or at least a backup of all the files important to you. Think if the HD goes bad tomorrow and you could get nothing recovered from it, what would you say \"I wish I had a copy of...\"\n\n*If you have a backup and see no performance degradation I'd say use the drive until it dies. Unless the new drive is bigger and faster. Then, you are killing two birds with one stone. Getting rid of a potentially bad drive and upgrading. \nSome background:   \nThe folder with a question mark means that upon booting the iMac can't find an operating system. This can happen because the hard drive is going bad, is bad or it can't find a startup disc (HD or other). This can be related to physical hardware or software issues.  \nHad you done any recent system updates prior to the machine freezing up? Sometimes after an update, example 10.6.7>10.6.8 some corruption can occur. If not, it still does not 100% rule out some sort of OS/software issue.   \nDid you recently boot from an external HD, netboot or optical disk? Sometimes the OS cannot find the last disk it was booting from and you will quickly see the folder with question mark flash on the screen, but then the machine sees an operating system and boots from it. I would look in System Preferences>Startup Disk and make sure you select the drive you want to boot from. Most likely, Macintosh HD, unless you renamed your HD. Press the restart button and now it knows for sure to use that drive to start from.\nDisk Utility is usually pretty good and seeing errors and then correcting them. This could be a simple directory issue that is now fixed and it won't happen again or it could be the early stages of a failing drive. You could purchase any one of many software disc checking tools to see if the drive is having hardware malfunctions or has bad blocks. Disk Warrior is excellent and so is Drive Genius. Unless you plan on using these utilities a lot, it may not make $ense to buy them and rather just use the replacement HD you purchased.  \n\nA: I would check the SMART status of the drive. It can be an early warning sign.\nOr better yet, you can try to run the Seagate Seatools for DOS on your mac via CD. It's compatible with every iMac, but if it works with your Mac, you can do detail diagnosis on the drive.\n\nA: The only true way to know is to isolate the drive from the mac. I wouldn't go in and replace a drive based on needing an erase install. Maybe on my third erase/install I would for a home machine.\nA work machine is different, since down time is usually more costly than paying a tech to replace the drive if it's failing diagnostics and to know professionally when it's time to do a swap.\nUnless there are hard problems like SMART failure, DriveGenius reporting failures of many blocks or a very large slow down of raw speeds, it might be too early to go in and do a swap based on evidence rather than a hunch.\n", "Q: how do we organize our apps in itunes library is there anyway to arrange or organize our apps in the itunes library?\nI mean i have well a ton of apps and it really helps if i could put them in folders / lists / or anything?\n\nA: No - there is nothing in iTunes to make it easier. You can also use Xcode and the iPhone configuration utility to get a little more screen real estate, but managing apps is still fairly simplistic. The configuration utility does make it possible to automate installing several apps, so that's a step in the right direction for some.\nI've filed bugs and sent feedback to Apple asking for more screen real-estate in iTunes to start making app management easier.\n\nThey have a 'Use Full Window for iTunes Store' view so it's not inconceivable they might do the same for iOS management at some point. Feel free to link to my picture in your bug report or feedback if you also want to ask Apple for this change.\nhttp://skitch.com/mbrad/fgj28/itunes-managing-ios-apps\n\nA: Since iOS 4.0, it is possible to organize your app icons into folders: just drag one icon on top of another, it will automatically create a folder for you.\nIf you have tons of icons to move around, you can be slightly more efficient in iTunes by  using SHIFT to multi-select icons (or folders). Then drag them all at once onto another screen, or into an existing folder (or out of an existing folder).\n\nA: It appears that regardless of settings, playlists and even the Library (if it's enabled) ignore all apps, and dragging apps to manual playlists doesn't seem possible. So the only options you have are those that are built-in, such as viewing the apps as a list (View>as List), selecting which columns are available (View>View Options) and sorting by the available columns.\n", "Q: Moving 'Sites' folder to Dropbox I'm trying to move my standard ~/Sites folder, or the global Sites folder (in Library/WebServer/Documents) to my Dropbox folder, and make this usable with Web Sharing, PHP, MySQL etc.\nSo far I have changed the httpd.conf in etc/apache2 to overwrite these lines:\n# original: DocumentRoot \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\"\nDocumentRoot \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/users/cannyboy/Dropbox/Sites\"\n# original: <Directory \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\">\n<Directory \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/users/cannyboy/Dropbox/Sites\">\n\nBut when I browse http://localhost I get:\nForbidden\nYou don't have permission to access / on this server.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how to get this to work?\n\nA: You could just move the Sites folder into the Dropbox folder - and then make a link/alias from the new Dropbox location back to ~/Sites.\nAfter you've moved the Sites folder into Dropbox you right click on the Sites folder in Dropbox, and then choose \"Make Alias\" and move this alias into ~/ (remember to rename it to Sites) - alternativ create the alias this way: Can I create Windows-style alias in Finder?\n\nA: I don't know default mod for Dropbox folder, but Sites have read access for anyone (such as apache web server) :\nls -Alh ~/\n\ndrwx------+ 26 Bil   staff   884B 25 jui 12:40 Desktop\ndrwx---rwx  22 Bil   staff   748B 24 jui 19:01 Documents\ndrwx------+ 11 Bil   staff   374B 24 jui 16:47 Downloads\ndrwx------  49 Bil   staff   1,6K 21 jui 10:07 Library\ndrwx------+  5 Bil   staff   170B 11 aoû  2010 Movies\ndrwx------+  5 Bil   staff   170B 26 avr 16:37 Music\ndrwx------   8 Bil   staff   272B 26 avr 10:35 Pictures\ndrwxr-xr-x   6 Bil   staff   204B  9 déc  2009 Public\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 17 Bil   staff   578B 23 jui 14:23 Sites\n\nTo change access of Dropbox, type in Terminal.app \nchmod a+r ~/Dropbox\n\nBut be careful, once you've change directory's mod, everybody can read view/read it's content.\n", "Q: OS X Kindle App: Where are the books located? I was expecting to find .epub or .prc files on my hard-disk, but didn't. Does anyone know: Where are the ebooks that the official Kindle App downloads located?\n\nA: The Kindle app stores AZW files, but only downloads them for Amazon-purchased content that you have opened in the Kindle app on that computer.\nThe AZW files are saved in ~/Documents/My Kindle Content.\nTheir names are random-looking (like B0043M4ZH0_EBOK), so it takes a little work to figure out which file corresponds to which book. Here's how you do that:\nOpen the book of interest on Amazon.com (make sure you're looking at the Kindle edition). It's URL will be something like this:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-ebook/dp/B0043M4ZH0/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&qid=1309013055&sr=8-2, but all you're interested in is the code after /dp/. In this case, it's B0043M4ZH0.\nSo, you know that the AZW file with the name B0043M4ZH0_EBOK is The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nA: Well, by going to the \"Content Folder\" in Kindle \"Preferences,\" and clicking on same, I found the .azw files, but greyed out. They are in ~/Library/Application Support/Kindle/My Kindle Content/.\nYou can also use the \"find\" command in Terminal: find  ~ -name '*.azw' to locate them.\n\nA: These files are now (October 2012) stored in:\n~/Library/Containers/com.amazon.Kindle/Data/Library/Application Support/Kindle/My Kindle Content/\n\nIf they move again you can find them by running the command:\nfind  . -name *.azw\n\n\nA: You can find (and change) the location of your books in the general preferences. Simply choose Preferences from the Kindle menu. In the General tab, you can find an entry Content Folder and a button to change it.\nThis works at least on a fresh installation of Kindle from the App Store, running Mountain Lion.\nAddition: Worth saying that if you change it that it will automatically move everything from the existing location to the new location so you don't have to worry about it losing track of your books.\n\nA: After reading the above, I created a new folder under /Documents and then changed the target file location in Kindle/Preferences. Kindle app then copied the files to their. Then they became visible. Before that I also couldn't find them.\n\nA: You can define the location of the files (and see where they are) in you application.\nUnder Kindle -> Preferences you will find the content folder. if you hover the mouse over you can see all of them one at a time.\n", "Q: For a Macbook Pro, what are some recommend power plan settings for Windows 7 via Bootcamp I would like to ask if anyone has some recommendations on some of the specific settings for Window power plans (especially advanced parameters) for a Macbook Pro. For me specifically I have an early 2011 17\".\nAs I understand it, OSX is better able to make use of the battery with specialized code that Windows lacks (or drivers from Apple perhaps?). I'm particularly interested in settings in Windows that make the most of the battery life as well as more generally any info that specifically addresses using Windows 7 with Mac hardware when it comes to power options.\ne.g. what is Hybrid Sleep in Windows 7 and what does it do for Mac hardware?\ne.g. what quirks to Windows power should be known when using Mac hardware?\n\nA: Yes, as has been found through testing, Windows 7 gets lower battery life than OS X, for light usage, because OS X has more fine-grained and integrated power management, in a nutshell. There's not much you can do about it in Windows, except for the usual tricks - put down your backlight brightness, disable inessential wireless services like bluetooth or wifi, and allow the system to sleep the display when not in use. \nIt seems your particular model (MBP 2011) doesn't allow the integrated Intel graphics to work under Windows - this is going to have a huge impact on battery life. Hopefully Apple fix this, follow the issue on their discussion forums.\nHybrid sleep is primarily a desktop feature, according to Microsoft. Read more at Microsoft's sleep and hibernation FAQ.\n", "Q: What is the best compression utility for Mac? What compression utility can you recommend that supports zip, rar, tar, etc... like 7zip and FilZip on Windows?\n\nA: My personal recommendation is BetterZip for a small price and the ability to create archives. A free alternative is The Unarchiver but this is limited to archive extraction only.\n\nA: Stuffit Expander is a good one that I hear a lot about. The built-in Archive Utility will hand just about every thing except for RAR files. For that I would use UnRARX, which is also free.\n\nA: I like Archiver (formerly known as Rucksack). But it's not free.\n\nA: I found Keka that is some different to use, but solve the problem. And Unarchiver is a good choice to decompress too.\nThanks all!\n", "Q: with magic trackpad, time lag between when i droped a something and when it actually dropped I'm using a magic trackpad.\nThere is a time lag for about 0.5 second between when i dropped a something, for example desctop icon, and when it actually dropped.\n\nI can drop immidiately by touching after I drop something.\nBut I don't want to touch every time I drop something.\nMagic mouse can drop immidiatelly without any extra operations.\n\nWhat is this time lag?\nAnd how can I solve this problem?\n\n\nA: Do you have one-finger drag enabled? I believe the delay is there so when you \"run out of runway\" on a long drag, you have time to move your finger to the other side of the pad and continue dragging.  The mouse doesn't need that delay because you can hold the left button (or finger sensor) while you carry the mouse. You may need to use the click-drag instead of one-finger drag.\n", "Q: Will Photoshop CS version 8.0 work if I update from Tiger to Leopard? I have just baught an Iphone and I have to upgrade my itunes, but it says my operating system is too old. I have an Ibook G4 10.4.11 with a 1.42 GHz PowerPC G4 processor. The support team are sending me out a disc to install Leopard operating system. However, I am worried that once I install it I may not be able to run Photoshop CS version 8.0. Will this be an issue, as I use it everyday. If so, I am thinking of returning the iphone.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. I heard that there maybe issues with intel based macs, but I think mine is PowerPC...\n\nA: Yes, 8.0 runs even in Snow Leopard.\nAlso:  look in the Help menu and see if there is a \"Deactivate\" choice.  (I think 8.0 is before that started, actually.)  If so, then you should deactivate Photoshop, install the new OS, then activate it again.\n", "Q: Airport Extreme Guest Network and Dual-band Does enabling the Guest Network on a 4th Generation Airport Extreme have any impact on Dual-Band performance?\nI have multiple 802.11/g devices that I want to use the 2.4GHz spectrum, and only occasional need for Guests.  However, when Guest access is required, it is usually required suddenly, so it would be nice to have it always on.\nDoes enabling the Guest Network necessarily disable the dual-band, or do these capabilities co-exist?\n\nA: Guest network is just a VLAN and doesn't otherwise affect the channels or the antennas.\nSo - the guests could use bandwidth because they are connected, so if you ignore those effects, the guest network just tags along with the main channels and settings which doesn't have any major effects on the system.\n", "Q: How do I watch Youtube videos without Flash on Safari? Is there a way to watch Youtube videos without Flash installed on Safari?\nIf not, are there any other solutions?\n\nA: Yes, most YouTube videos are also available as HTML5 videos. You need to sign in to YouTube and join the HTML5 trial -- see http://www.youtube.com/html5 for details.\n\nA: There should be a preference thing on YouTube to select HTML5, but they've reorganized the page so many times since I last tracked it down that I have no idea where it is now.\nInstead, I have ClickToFlash installed (it's under \"Most Popular\" in the Safari Extensions Gallery); open its preferences (Safari Preferences... > Extensions) and you can tell it to always use HTML5 for YouTube and other sites that support HTML5 in place of Flash.\n\nA: I use the FlashToHTML5 Extension, works great!\n\nFlashToHTML5 replaces the CPU and memory hogging YouTube Flash Player with a HTML5 player.\n  Not only will it look nicer, you will also notice that your computer will run cooler and faster. If you use a laptop, you will also notice that the battery life of a fully charged battery will increase.\n\n\nA: FlashToHTML5 appears to be very buggy almost broken with YouTube and Safari 6.0.2. The recently re-written Safari plugin YouTube5 is much better but only works with YouTube, Vimeo, and Facebook.\n\nA custom designed HTML5 player to replace the usable, but very limited built-in player.\n\n*\n\n*Support for Vimeo and Facebook video.\n\n*The ability to switch video\nresolutions within the player, without having to access Safari’s\npreferences.\n\n*Support for downloading videos from YouTube and\nFacebook.\n\n*A fully functional volume control, rather than just a mute\nbutton.\n\n*Support for displaying the video’s title, author, and source,\nin a video overlay, along with a link back to the video’s page on\nYouTube, Vimeo, etc.\n\n\n\nA: After uninstalling Flash, Youtube no longer worked on Safari. Turns out, I had left ClicktoPlugin active, and that somehow confused the site. Disabled it (i.e. just running plain Safari) works fine.\nWrote this in case others with legacy settings might experience the same. Check your Safari > Settings > Plugins\n\nA: These plugins should also work with Safari+Ninjakit:\nhttp://isebaro.com/viewtube/\nhttp://userscripts.org/scripts/show/169665\n", "Q: Extension for Safari to enable Google Translation WITHOUT adding a button? In the safari extensions there is a cool extension to use google translate on the current web page: \"Translate\".\nHowever I don't like the fact it is adding a button to the bar. I would like to make it work as in Chrome, where the bar automatically appears when a website is in a foreign language.\nthanks\n\nA: There's an extension called Translate, you can download it here:\nhttp://sidetree.com/extensions.html\n(second from the bottom)\n\nA: I'm using Franker. Translate only what i want (selected text or whole page), inject translated text into the page, no button (right click menu).\n\nA: You can drag the toolbar button off the menu bar and still get the context menu to translate a page. This is how I use it (I also use Franker for some inline translations)\n\nA: You could also add a custom search like http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=auto&u={query} to Alfred, or assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"Safari\" to URL of document 1\ndo shell script \"open 'http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=auto&u='$(ruby -rcgi -e 'print CGI.escape ARGV[0]' \" & quoted form of result & \")\"\n\n", "Q: Per-application selection of correct spell checker language on Mac? I am Norwegian, but I set up my new iMac with English as the primary language.\nMy question is this:\n\nCan I configure Mac OS X (possibly through a 3rd party application, free or not) to pick the right spell checker language depending on which application I'm typing in?\n\nI went and downloaded a Norwegian spell checker file, and for some reason, when I opened up Trillian (IM/chat) directly afterwords, and started typing, it gave me Norwegian spell checking hints. ie. Any Norwegian word I mistyped, and right-clicked on, it showed up a list of other, correct and similar, Norwegian words.\nAfter a few reboots and whatnot, Trillian is apparently back to English and will only list English words when I misspell them.\nNow, after this I've discovered how to pick which language to use the spell checker against, it's under Language & Text in System Preferences, Text tab, Spelling setting.\nHowever, when I'm in Chrome, as I am right now while typing this question, I rarely type in Norwegian, and when I'm in Trillian, I rarely type in English. Most of the time when I'm typing in Chrome, it's for emails or Stack Exchange-related posts, all in English, and only 1-2 of all my IM-friends are English so I only ever type in Norwegian there.\nThus, my question; can I configure Mac OS X to automatically use the right spell checker when I'm typing in a particular program, so that when I'm typing text in Chrome, it uses the English spell checker, and when I'm typing in Trillian, it uses the Norwegian one, and so on and so forth?\n\nA: You can't set it per application, but you can set it to support multiple languages and detect them automatically.\nTo do so (in Lion - although I've been using this at least since Leopard), open System Preferences, go to Language & Text, select the Text tab, set Spelling to Automatic by Language, then open the Spelling dropdown again, select Setup... at the bottom and check the languages you want to enable.\n", "Q: How can I set the Mac OS X screensaver when not logged in? When logged in to my user account, the screensaver selected in System Preferences is used. However, when on the login screen before logging in or using fast user switching a different screensaver is used. How do I set the screensaver used on the login screen?\n\nA: The screensaver for the login screen is the one set for the root (i.e. system) user account. To launch System Preferences as root, use sudo; a Terminal window run:\nsudo /Applications/System\\ Preferences.app/Contents/MacOS/System\\ Preferences\n\nThen you can change the screensaver settings as you normally would. Note that in order to use sudo, you needs to be an admin user.\n", "Q: Password protect folder without disk images? Is this possible?\nI know you can protect a .dmg file, but is there a more convenient solution, by using a third party application?\n\nA: The only way I can think of to do this would be to create a new user with the password you want to use for the folder, then use chmod to set rights on the folder to 700, then you'll use that new user's username and password to access the file.\n\nA: credit: snazzylabs youtube channel \nthere is an openssl encrypt / decrypt command (sth like that - i dont remember the exact syntax )\nopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -e -in (file path of file to encrypt ~users/user/desktop/filename- drag n drop) -out (filepath of new encrypted file ~users/user/desktop/filename2 ) \nif the command is right it will ask you for a password \nthis will keep the initial file (filename) and generate a 2nd file with the name you specified (manually) like in this case (filename2)\nkeep in mind that the encrytped file does not open  if you double click and there is no dialog box  or prompt from OS X to enter password and you will need terminal to decrypt it. \nyou will enter the same command but insted of -e after  cbc you will type -d (for decrypt i assume) \nalso in the -in (filepath) you will enter the filename of the encrypted file to be decrytped by the command not the initial filename\nopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -e -in (file path of file to DEcrypt ~users/user/desktop/filename2- drag n drop) -out (filepath of new DEcrypted file ~users/user/desktop/filename3 \nin this example filename is the file to encrypt , filename 2 is the name of the encrypted file generated by the command and filename3 is the name of the decrypted file . \nif you dont delete the initial file you encrypted you are going to have 2 files after the openssl enc .... command which isnt any good since all the info in filename is still accessible even if filename2 is encrypted.\nmake sure you can decrypt the encrypted file then delete all unencrypted versions.\nwith this method you will need to run the decrypt command every time you want to access the file and delete the generated decrypted file afterwards and keep the encrypted only . \n"]
