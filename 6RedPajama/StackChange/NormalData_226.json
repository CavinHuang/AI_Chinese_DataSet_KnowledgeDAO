["Q: Ubuntu Server on HP ML10 v2: keyboard doesn't work in installation I'm trying to install Ubuntu Server 15.10 on my Hp ML10 v2 (with Pentium G3240).\nI know about the controller raid driver problem, so I set in the bios the controller to AHCI SATA mode.\nI create an USB with unetbootin and boot the ISO from it, but when the installation starts, on the first screen (language selection) the keyborad doesn't work anymore.\nI use a wireless keyboard from Logitech, and tried to plug the USB reciever in the USB2 and USB3 port, but nothing changes.\nI've got also an old PS/2 keyboard, but the server doesn't have the PS/2 port!\nWhat can I do?\nUPDATE\nThe problem was the wireless keyboard!\nWith a simple USB keyboard all works fine.\nBut now I can't boot from the Ubuntu HDD...\n\nA: Yes, I was able to get this to work, using Ubuntu 16.04 Server LTS.  I put the detailed instructions that worked for me here:  How can I install Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server on an HP ProLiant ML10 v2 Server\n", "Q: My microphone has an extra channel full of random noise, how do I disable the extra channel? EDIT: I still have this problem as of 6/20/2016\nMy microphone works just fine in Windows 10. When I try to use Google Hangouts in Ubuntu I am almost completely inaudible over the random noise from my mic.\nGoogle Hangouts automatically changes my microphone settings, so muting the broken channel only fixes things for a few seconds. I want to disable the broken channel so that Google Hangouts can't use it.\nThis is a recording of me making snap noises. The bottom channel is the broken channel which is full of maximum volume random noise. The top channel sounds like the mic does in Windows 10.\n\nI am on a Gigabyte P25X V2 using the built-in microphone.\nuname -a:\nLinux Hyperion-K 3.16.0-60-generic #80~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jan 20 13:37:48 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\ncat /etc/issue\nUbuntu 14.04.3 LTS \\n \\l\n\nsome of lspci output:\n00:03.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor HD Audio Controller (rev 06)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset High Definition Audio Controller (rev 05)\n\naccording to alsamixer:\nCard: HDA Intel PCH\nChip: Realtek ALC282\n\n\nA: Install PulseAudio Volume Control from Ubuntu Software Center. Then go to \"Input Devices\" tab and silence one of the channels. You can also choose settings per application, start Google Hangouts and go to \"Recording\" tab where you will find your application, and here you can also change recording settings for specific application. Third way is to choose suitable profile in \"Configuration\" tab.\nI haven't experienced your specific problem, but PulseAudio Volume Control is very good application with a lot of options, it helped me solving various other issues many times, so I am almost sure it will help you with this case as well.\n", "Q: Hissing sound in headphones Today I tried Ubuntu on my laptop Asus n550jx 64 bit version. Everything works fine except there is constant static/ hissing in headphones (in laptop speaker too, but its too silent to be heard). It uses intel 4th generation sound drivers or something liek that, on windows realtek hd drivers. Also hissing is constant - it doesn't stop if there is no music playing or something like, pop only happens when Ubuntu boots. Hissing doesn't become louder if there max volume, it happens even if there is speaker on mute( sound of hissing changes thought).\nWhat have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mute built in microphone- no effect\n\n*Check playback settings with alsamixer. There was something loopback which turned off made hissing quieter, but its still annoying \n\n*Checked sound card power saving which was turned off \n\n\nSo its something like that...\nOh and there is no hissing on windows 10.\n\nA: The following solved it for my ux501VW laptop\nsudo apt-get install alsa-tools-gui\nsudo hdajackretask\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select both Show unconnected pins and Advanced override in the Options\n\n*Override Pin ID 0x16 Changing Device to: headphones\n\n*Click the Install boot override button\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nA: I know I am late to the party but I solved this on Ubuntu 17.04 by doing the following:\nOpen terminal and type the following:\nalsamixer\n\nand then press F6 and select your sound card. Use your arrow keys to decrease the volume where the hissing sound disappears (I solved it by decreasing it to green area only. See the screenshot). After that, adjust volume using standard volume control on Ubuntu (from Unity menu). You may have to do this every time you plug/unplug sound card but it has given me peace of mind really.\nHope it helps someone.\n\nA: None of the answers in this thread that worked for many other users, worked for me. I thought the problem was in my audio card driver so I did a little research and found this magic line.\nsudo setfacl -m u:username:rw /dev/snd/*\n\nIt solved the problem for me with no more hissing in my headphones. You can find the original answer here.\n\nA: I have no idea how it works, but the hissing sound goes away when i enabled auto-mute mode in alsamixer\n\nA: This worked for me http://xps13-9333.appspot.com/#background_noise .\nI could not make it run on boot, but its something.\n", "Q: Can I go from 15.10 to 16.04 I presume 16.04 will be LTS, so I would like to ask if I installed 15.10 would I be able to upgrade to 16.04 without much in the way of problems.\nOr if I installed 16.04 now, would it eventually become the release version?\nThanks\n\nA: You will be able to upgrade to 16.04 LTS from 15.10 or 14.04 LTS.\nIt is recommended to install a stable version.\nAnd also if you install a 16.04 beta now it will become a stable release with the standard update mechanism.\nBut please take in account that 16.04 is off-topic at this site untill it is released.\n", "Q: how to list file names when searching for strings passed by cat with pipe I want to search for a string in the files in a directory like:\ncat /etc/pam.d/*  | grep  pam_ck_connector.so\n\nbut I also want to list the file names in which files the string pam_ck_connector.so found. grep -l switch is apparently for that purpose but it fails in this case:\ncat /etc/pam.d/*  | grep -l pam_ck_connector.so\n\n(standard input)\n\nWhat is the correct algorithm to achieve what I want?\n\nA: This is a canonical Useless Use of Cat.

I once again installed Ubuntu 14.04 on that one with no problems.\nBut today I accidentally unplugged the laptop, and since the battery is dead, the laptop immediately shut off. \nWhen I tried booting, the blank purple Ubuntu screen came up for a second but then it changed to a blank black screen, with nothing but a blinking white underline character, like the one that prompts you to type in the terminal, but I couldn't type anything.\nThis screen also goes completely dark with no backlight after about 5 minutes, even though I set it to do that after 30 minutes. Moving the mouse brings back the black backlight.\nI tried restarting a few times, but this happens every time I do.\nI tried restarting it a few more times, and without me doing anything differently, it finally went straight to the GRUB menu. \nI selected \"Ubuntu\", and first, this back log screen came up for a few seconds:\n\nand then it took me to a purple screen that says Errors were found while checking the disk drive for /.\n\nI've seen this screen before, when the previous hard drives were starting to fail, but this current hard drive is only a few days old. I have the option to attempt to fix the errors, ignore, skip mounting, or manual recovery. Which one should I choose?\n\nA: There is a possibility of having some problem in the boot partition in which you have installed Ubuntu.\nGo with this instruction to check if there is any problem there or not:\nMake a bootable USB and boot your system with it. Find your main partition in which you have installed Ubuntu. You may use sudo blkid to get a list of all your partition. I assume that partition is /dev/sda1.\nMake sure that partition is not mounted. Then, in terminal, use this cammand: sudo fsck -a /dev/sda1\nIf it finished with no error, you can restart your system. It the problem be related to what I said, it should be solved now. Your issue must be solved.\n\nA: I get this all the time. I just type in my password as if I could see the login and then hit enter. Usually boots for me. \nNote Its not technically the same as the OPs problem. For those of us who boot up to a black screen; this is how I am able to move past that.\n\nA: Try entering the grub menu by pressing Shift or Esc after boot when you see splash screen. Choose advanced options and see there should be recovery mode. Try to boot with the recovery mode. Also could you please update your question with exact model of laptop?\nAlso when you see a blank screen try pressing Ctrl + Alt + F2 does it put you into the terminal saying something like tty2 on the top?\nIf you got into the terminal just login with your regular login details (password won't show when you are typing it in) once logged in try:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nWhat's the output?\n\nA: Generally I'd urge a cautious approach that would include cloning the drive and using a Live USB. But because the drive is only a few days old and your problem only started after an improper shutdown, I'd just press F. I get prompted for this every time I let my battery run dry, which happens once every few months (with only standard OS read/write to the drive). It completes its checks and I login in every time. \n", "Q: BSD compatible commands The BSD versions of a number of basic Unix commands, such as ls,  behave differently from the GNU versions used by Ubuntu.\nSome operating systems, including Solaris, provide BSD commands in addition to the \"native\" ones.  For example, Solaris 9 has a /usr/ucb directory in addition to the /usr/bin directory, with some commands names duplicated.\nIs there something similar for Ubuntu? I haven't found a relevant package, either one that's installable via apt or as source.\n\nA: Reading through this Unix and Linux post titled \"Any options to replace GNU coreutils on Linux?\", one option could be the Heirloom project toolset. It includes ls, among other things, and hopefully that ls behaves like you want it to. Of interest is this point in the highlights:\n\nMultiple versions of many utilities are provided to approach\n  compatibility with various specifications and Unix flavors, namely\n  SVID3/SVR4, SVID4/SVR4.2MP, POSIX.2-1992/SUSV2, POSIX.1-2001/SUSV3,\n  and 4BSD (SVR4 /usr/ucb).\n\nNote the last item: \"4BSD (SVR /usr/ucb)\".\nIt doesn't have an Ubuntu package that I know of.

When I try to sync my Gmail account it displays an error message about having the wrong username and password.\nI already made the necessary changes in Gmail; I followed all the steps from Gmail and Thunderbird tutorials. How can I fix this?\n\nA: You might be bumping into the latest Thunderbird bug with using the OAuth Authentication method.  Do you get a popup in a google https window that asks for your username and then will not let you click on \"next\"?\nIf so add the account to Thunderbird by allowing it to auto detect the server settings.  Then select \"manual\" and change the Authentication types from \"OAuth2\" to \"Normal Password\" for both incoming and outbound servers.  Note that for \"Normal KPassword\" to work you will need to log into your gmail account from a web browser and enable “Allow less secure apps” \nhere is the link to the google account setting. \nGoogle tool screenshot\nAlternately you can wait/force the install of the latest Thunderbird release in the beta class for the OAuth fix.\n\nA: I went to Account Settings > Account > Authentication Method and changed it from Normal Password to Oauth2\n\nA: \"allow less secure apps\" is no longer available. when I'm back on pc tbird I'll try the old password change.\n", "Q: How do I stream Stereo Mix Audio?

However, there are three entries on boot. \n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 10\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*Ubuntu Recovery\n\n\nIs there a way to change the icon for Ubuntu Recovery? Right now the two Ubuntu entries share the same icon. Or at least fold it into the other Ubuntu entry (where I press F2 and I get the option to boot into recovery/single user mode/etc...)?\nI looked in refind.conf but don't see anything for setting an icon for Ubuntu Recovery.\nAny help would be appreciated, thank you!\n\nA: Several procedures for changing rEFInd icons are covered in the documentation here:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/configfile.html#icons\nMy preferred method is to give the filesystem or partition a suitable name; however, that might not work for you. You might want to look into copying an icon file to the same directory as the loader and giving it a name to match the loader, but with a .png extension. Be aware that, because rEFInd supports multiple methods of assigning icons to loaders, there can be conflicting icons, but of course only one will be selected. Thus, if you try one method and it doesn't work, chances are that whatever IS setting the icon has a higher priority, so you should either try another.\nNote also that how to change the icons varies depending on what type of a boot loader it is, and that can be revealed by the description text. Each entry should have a text-mode description that you can see when you highlight it. These normally include the path to the EFI boot loader file, or sometimes an OS-specific customized description or something specific to a BIOS-mode boot (particularly on a Mac). Since you didn't report this information, or what type of computer it is (PC or Mac) in your question, I can't know with certainty how any of your OSes is booting, and therefore what methods might work for you.\n", "Q: chrome resolution changes when monitor is turned off Having an issue with Google Chrome resolution/dpi changing when I turn my monitor off. I'm pretty sure that this is all related to the scaling factor from Universal Access Panel. in which I have large text turned on. This setting makes Chrome have bigger tabs, but is not recognized when monitor is turned off. I have to shut down Chrome, and restart it it to recognize the Universal Access setting. \nTo see what is going on with my display settings while my monitor is turned off I used `xrandr'.  \nThe output of xrandr while monitor is ON is:\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767\nDP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 890mm x 500mm\n   1920x1080      60.0*+   59.9     30.0     24.0     30.0     24.0  \n   1920x1080i     60.1     60.0  \n   1280x720       60.0     59.9  \n   720x480        60.0     59.9  \n   640x480        60.0     59.9 \n\nThe output of xrandr while monitor is OFF is:\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767\nDP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 708mm x 398mm\n   1280x720       60.0 +   50.0     30.0     59.9     30.0     24.0     24.0  \n   4096x2160      24.0     24.0  \n   3840x2160      30.0     25.0     24.0     30.0     24.0  \n   1920x1080      60.0*    50.0     59.9     30.0     25.0     24.0     30.0     24.0  \n   1920x1080i     60.1     50.0     60.0  \n   720x576        50.0  \n   720x480        60.0     59.9  \n   640x480        60.0     59.9\n\nIn any case I  would like to figure out how to keep chrome's dpi/resolution stable so that I don't have to restart it each time my monitor is turned off/on. Here are two screenshots of before and after. \n\n\nPlease note that the second photo is what Chrome would look like if I did NOT have Universal Access with large text turned ON. \nSomething interesting that I noticed is that in this larger mode (second photo), the buttons and navigation don't actually correlate to the items on the screen. If I click any of the bookmark bar icons at the top with the mouse, the browser would not navigate to the right one. For example, if I clicked on the UTUBE short cut in the bookmarks bar it would take me to the $$$ link. It seems to be behaving as though the object & frame mappings are still 'calibrated' for when the scale was bigger.\n\nA: I discovered that Chrome has changed to the Aura framework, and no longer uses GTK framework. \nA simple workaround is to launch Chrome with:\ngoogle-chrome --high-dpi-support=1 --force-device-scale-factor=1.5\n\n\nA: As mentioned here, Chrome has changed to the Aura framework, and no longer uses GTK framework. This causes however some peculiarities. \nAs mentioned by Kalamalka Kid, who actually did practically all of the work, it can be worked around by running Chrome with the command:\ngoogle-chrome --high-dpi-support=1 --force-device-scale-factor=<scale_factor>\n\ne.g.:\ngoogle-chrome --high-dpi-support=1 --force-device-scale-factor=1.5\n\nHow to make Google Chrome start by default with the changed scale factor\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the global Google-chrome launcher from /usr/local/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications:\ncp /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n\n\n*Open the local copy with gedit:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop\n\nLook for the line: Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U, change it into:\ngoogle-chrome --high-dpi-support=1 --force-device-scale-factor=1.5\n\nNow after you log out/in, Chrome starts by default in your altered scaling.\n", "Q: xdotool does not terminate xdotool click 1 works as it should: the left mouse button is clicked once.\nOn the other hand, whenever I enter xdotool behave_screen_edge bottom click 1 in the terminal, the command does not terminate.

And it took about 90 minutes for me to move the 172GB data chunks to the right.\nlike this\n\n\n*After that, left-click on your swap partition and click swapoff\n\n*Now, you can resize the ext4 partition using the space you freed before\n\n*Apply changes.\n\n\nI've resized the ext4 partition on a LiveCD, but I don't think it's necessary. (you can resize it while logged in)\n\nA: You can extend partitions only which harddrive sectors are neighbours. i mean in this case you can not keep any partition between the root part and unlocated space.\nAs i can see the only expandable partition is the one named Telkom Stuff and it is most probably the drive you make space from. If you want to expand your root part, you need to reconfigure disk. Using an external harddrive you can backup your data and do whatever you want with your disk by deleting Data and Telkom Stuff partitions.

That can lead to infinite loops where you make copies of copies of copies of ...\n\nA: In a regular filesystem e.g. ext4, if you only have w permission in a file, you won't be able to read (cat) it, you need read (r) bit for that. Note that, root can read any file regardless of the permission bits.\nNow, /sys is a mount point of special sysfs provided by Linux kernel which is actually a virtual filesystem and works differently than regular filesystems. /sys contains device related info of the system.\nModifying something in /sys would directly alter kernel's internal data structure so it depends on kernel what it would permit or deny.\nFor /sys/module/nf_conntrack_ipv4/uevent, you have only w bit set for owner (root), even if you add r bit for root (which is a very bad idea), while reading the file you would get I/O error because by design the kernel would not allow anyone to read the uevents for the nf_conntrack_ipv4 module.\n", "Q: How does ubuntu ensure software security bfrom external developers I was reading on the hack against the Transmission Bittorrent Client. http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/03/first-mac-targeting-ransomware-hits-transmission-users-researchers-say/\nIt got me thinking about how would Ubuntu protect itself against this kind of thing. Do the Ubuntu Devs review all software that they put in their repositories or do they trust that software is secure and host it anyway?\n\nA: There are multiple levels of security/responsibility:\n\n\n*\n\n*Developers:\n\n\n*\n\n*write the source code -> check security of own code and from other developers\n\n*manage code repositories -> should check patches before accepting them, keep their repository secure\n\n*offer source downloads -> should keep download site secure, provide signed tarballs and checksums\n\n\n*Packaging toolchain:\n\n\n*\n\n*Packagers: should package properly (configuration options, config files, pre/post-install scripts), sign packages\n\n*Repository managers: Properly vet package submissions\n\n*Distribution managers: Keep downloads, checksums, signatures, etc secure\n\n*All of them: Make sure security fixes make it into the distro package repositories as quickly as possible.\n\n*More info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU\n\n\n*SecureApt:\n\n\n*\n\n*Makes sure that downloaded packages and updates have not been tampered with (checksum and signature checks)\n\n*More info:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SecureApt\n\n\n\n*Users:\n\n\n*\n\n*Because most code for Ubuntu packages is open source and the packaging/signing/etc process is documented, anyone can check for security issues in principle and report unusual behaviour.\n\n*Should update regularly, but also follow security news if possible in case software updates or .iso files are compromised for instance... :/ ( Example: http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2994 )\n\n*Check .iso files before installing from them (checksums+signature, avoid unofficial sources)\n\n*Not ignore warnings like \"WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!\": Why am I getting authentication errors for packages from an Ubuntu repository?\n\nDo the Ubuntu Devs review all software that they put in their repositories or do they trust that software is secure and host it anyway?\n\nMy guess is that they mainly trust the original developers (and users to report issues). But if any security problems are found, everyone involved should collaborate to get things patched as quickly as possible. If Ubuntu receives bug reports, they should transmit the information upstream (i.e. to developers) and the other way around, if developers find bugs, they should patch them quickly and notify downstream (i.e. packagers). And everybody should keep their private keys secure and revoke keys if they have been compromised.\nP.S.: You might find more info on https://security.stackexchange.com/ as well.\n", "Q: Dual boot Windows 10 over Ubuntu 14.04 I am currently using Ubuntu 14.04 and use it as my primary OS.

If that is the case, what are files with the entries of new admin user created?\n\nA: You don't add a user to the /etc/sudoers file to grant him to use sudo to become root, but you just add him to the sudo and adm groups:\nsudo adduser USERNAME sudo\nsudo adduser USERNAME adm\n\nThis is also what the GUI does when you select \"Administrator\" as account type.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 / Xfce4 / Xubuntu ==> Whisker Menu graphically corrupt upon Save, recoverable via logout/login Ubuntu 15.10 / Xfce4 / Xubuntu\n==> Whisker Menu \n\n\n*\n\n*Applications menu reduces to a truncated white line without \nclickable items upon Panel=>Edit Applications=>[Save]\n\n*Need to logout/login to recover from this predicament\n\n\nIs there an easy whiskermenu restart on the cmdline in order not\nto have to log out??

Would like to know how So recently I've started using google calendar as I like the event notifications etc. I also started using Thunderbird and downloaded an extension which allowed me to open google calendar in a separate tab. I was also looking for a way to integrate google calendar into unity (so I would get notifications for events). When I gave up on this, it turned out that I had managed it somehow (see screenshot). I now get event notifications as well as a list of events below the unity calendar. \nI don't know how I did this, but if someone knows how to do this, it would be helpful to know for the purposes of turning it on/off in the future. Perhaps it's Thunderbird's integration with unity? Or is my gmail account somehow connected with my unity sign-in? \n\n\nA: I had a similar problem.\nI switched to Gnome from Unity to try it out, connected to a Google online account there, and switched back to Unity. In Unity I could not see the Google account under online accounts but it's calendars showed nevertheless in the default calendar app and in the time/date on top.\nExcept deleting the account in Gnome, I don't really saw a solution.\n", "Q: /var/crash/ - should I send it?

The bug tracker is rather good at cleaning itself from dupes and incomplete bugs (or the maintainer of that bug is). \nThere is a very high chance it will get rejected as it will only accept crash report  for 1 problem.

So that could be an answer: 192 MiB will roughly be used from a vanilla install will a little overhead (otherwise I would expect the recommended number to be higher or lower). Anything more is nice but not needed.\n\nA: This will vary, depending how much RAM is installed -- up to a point, Ubuntu will use some fraction of the available RAM for system operation, and keep the remainder for applications.  If there's not enough installed RAM, Ubuntu will perform slowly due to excessive paging to swap, and if there's more than around 6 GB available, the RAM usage at idle won't increase further.  This is also affected by various settings that control swap usage -- how large the swap partition is, and \"swappiness\", which is a system setting you wouldn't normally adjust, that decides how aggressively the system will trade off free RAM for swap time.\nMy Kubuntu 14.04.2 LTS system (KDE Plasma workspace) uses around 70-75% of my installed 4 GB at idle after a fresh startup, but I do have some widgets that run immediately on startup; it might or might not use less without those widgets, as disabling them might simply reduce the amount of swap space used in the idle state.  If you have a lighter GUI (or run at command line) and no auto-start applications, you might use significantly less; if you have no swap partition and run a similarly weighty GUI, you might use more.\n", "Q: Wine cannot load programs \"cannot execute binary file: exec format error\" Recently, I tried to install wine1.8 and use it.\nHowever, when I ran wine in the terminal, this happened:\njanreggie@janreggie-T100TA:~$ wine\nbash: /usr/bin/wine: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error\n\nwine64 works good\njanreggie@janreggie-T100TA:~$ wine64\nUsage: wine PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS...]   Run the specified program\n       wine --help                   Display this help and exit\n       wine --version                Output version information and exit\n\nHere's when I tried to run Notepad:\njanreggie@janreggie-T100TA:~$ wine notepad\nbash: /usr/bin/wine: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error\njanreggie@janreggie-T100TA:~$ wine64 notepad\n\nand here's when I tried to load winecfg\njanreggie@janreggie-T100TA:~$ winecfg\n/usr/bin/wine: 1: /usr/bin/wine: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting \")\")\n\nHere're the details of my system:\njanreggie@janreggie-T100TA:~$ uname -a\nLinux janreggie-T100TA 4.4.0 #2 SMP Mon Jan 25 01:29:52 MST 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nSo what do I do now?\nThanks.\nEDIT:\nI tried to follow @mohit 's answer.\nThis is what happened:\njanreggie@janreggie-T100TA:~$ sudo apt-get install wine-bin\nReading package lists...

If you do not want to visit that link or cannot, to sum up, while attempting to use:\nsudo chown (...)\n\nTo change the ownership of a file inside of a USB drive, it was unsuccessful, as the file had the immutable flag set in its extended attributes. This was the solution that worked, removing the flag via:\nsudo chattr -i (Path_To_File)\n\nAs this was fixed, I basically put this in the back of my mind where I would remember it in case of repetition of the error. Recently, I was formatting a USB custom, and ran into the same error, except this time, nothing that was suggested to fix said error the previous time, has worked. Here's your command output that I know you all love:\nsudo chown david:david ~/USB5/Format/type.cr\n\nPlease note that I have checked this command, and neither the (~) general path, nor the specific path work. The following is my output:\nOperation Not Permitted\n\nOf course, I have tried the fix from before, and the file does not have the flag. What can I do to fix this?\nSuggested answer below:\nsudo mkdir /media/flash\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/flash -o dmask=000,fmask=111\n\nThis just hangs on the second command, I left the computer for over 2 hours, just hanging. \nEDIT: Changing to EXT4 Did nothing, same error.\n\nA: You can set up /etc/fstab as a way of configuring drives.  To pick out or identify a specific partition to mount, we can use the partition's UUID, which can be found with blkid\nsudo blkid\n\nIn order to mount the drive, you need an empty directory.  The user you wish to have access to the files needs access to this directory, including +x:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/MyDrive\nsudo chown me:me /mnt/MyDrive\nsudo chmod 770 /mnt/MyDrive\n\nWhere me:me is the user:group string.  On most systems, the first non-root user created at install will have the uid of 1000, and gid of 1000, but you can check /etc/passwd and /etc/group to confirm these numbers match up on your system for the next step.\n\nNow that you know which partition to mount, and you have a place to mount it, work on a new entry in /etc/fstab\nUUID=id-without-quotes  /mnt/MyDrive   ext4   defaults,noauto,uid=1000,gid=1000\n\nAdditional details about /etc/fstab can be found in the Ubuntu Wiki.  The details found in the wiki will help you fine-tune settings, such as auto-mounting when inserted, or setting default umask.  Another interesting option is the users option, which allows non-root users to mount the filesystem.\nsudo mount /mnt/MyDrive\nsudo umount /mnt/MyDrive\n\nIf you need to share these files with other users, create a new group, add all of the users to the group, and then adjust the gid to match the new group's identifier.  You can see other examples of this, such as httpd or nginx using the www-data user/group.\n\nA: I'm using Sparky linux (Debian testing), but I had the same problem and this may work for you.\nAfter trying all the command line suggestions and not having any success, what worked for me was simply using Gparted and formatting the drive to ext4 and then doing a reformat to fat32 again and all is well.\nIt was kind of strange as I had been using this 16gb Adata USB3 for a couple of years and never had any issues.

Should I create the users and the groups in Ubuntu or in Samba, or perhaps in both?

So create users and groups in ubuntu and also add those users password to the /etc/samba/smbpasswd file as windows compatable hashes using the command\nSmbpasswd -a username\n\n", "Q: lost file in home directory After deleting shortcuts placed on desktop (documents, downloads, pictures, etc) I have lost all files.

My computer has UEFI based BIOS and I want to start over from scratch.\nThe PC came with Windows installed - I later installed Ubuntu alongside.\nI want to completely re-build my whole disk and install only Ubuntu on it.  \nSo it is not about how to install Ubuntu, it is about how to prepare a disk.\nWhat is the most professional way and which tasks will I have to perform?\n\nA: You can do everything from inside the Ubuntu installer. The minimum effort option is to select one of the \"Use whole disk\" variants, which should already do the right thing.\nIf you want to customize the partition layout, you can use the partition editor inside the installation tool as well, the only important bit is that you need to keep one FAT partition for the EFI binaries. This can be fairly small, since all that really needs to fit is three kernels (backup and running, and enough space to install updates), but unless space is really tight, 256 to 512 MB is a good value.\nLast but not least: Ubuntu can only install an EFI bootloader if the system was booted in EFI mode, because the BIOS compatibility layer does not allow access to the boot menu, so the bootloader cannot be registered.\n\nA: The most convenient and reliable way to prepare a disk is using the GNOME partition editor. GParted is included in the Ubuntu installation media, but in some cases it is better to use the original. When you boot from the Ubuntu install media and you already have a swap partition,\nthe partition is mounted.

(CentOS dual boot) I recently tried installing Ubuntu 14.04 alongside CentOs 6.7. I did this without using a live cd or usb by mounting the iso image to a 1.3GB partition (sda3). I was able to add a grub entry and boot to the partition and install Ubuntu on some free space (sda4). However after reboot, I was not able to select Ubuntu from the GRUB menu, I could only select CentOs and the Ubuntu Installer partition.\nI have checked and seems that Ubuntu is properly installed in sda4 but I cannot access it.

The virtualisation layer is KVM and I installed Virt-Manager for VMs management I can't do on the Kimchi web interface.\nEverything runs fine, except when I'm connected to this server through XRDP, and I click the \"Send Ctrl+Alt+Del\" virt-manager menu item, nothing happens.\nOf course, if I'm logged into this server locally, this works.\nAny idea? Thanks.\n\nA: I could be a little off-base on some of this, so an adjustment based on information from upstream maintainers of the various projects could be in order.  But this is what I think I've observed:\n\n\n*\n\n*When SPICE is used with virt-manager, it requires XKB extension in the X server.  If not, virt-manager complains bitterly when run with --debug switch. (You get errors like (virt-manager:121855): vnc-keymap-WARNING **: Unknown keycode mapping '(null)'.).\n\n*Both tightvncserver and vnc4server X servers in the Ubuntu 16.04 repos are really old and not maintained - I think they are nearly abandoned.  They don't support XKB: setxkbmap -query reports that the extension isn't there.\n\n\nTherefore, I conclude that virt-manager isn't compatible with the above VNC servers, at least in its current incarnation.  Fortunately, TightVNC appears to support XKB and seems to work (as evidenced by setxkbmap -query).  But it's not in any official Ubuntu repository.  You can get the .deb files from here: https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/tigervnc/1.6.0#files\nAs of 2016-05-30 they don't have a released version supporting Ubuntu 16.04.  But you can find some nightly built packages that support it - they worked for me.\nIf you still have trouble, try installing x11-xkb-utils package also.  I had to install this to get X2Go Server working with virt-manager; until then, I was having similar problems.\nOnce you have TigerVNC installed and set to your default Xvnc server, xrdp should seamlessly use it without any special configuration.\n", "Q: How to remove Grub Rescue from my friend's laptop I have no idea how Linux works, but my friend has dual booted his laptop with Ubuntu and Windows 8 and he has formatted his Linux partition (I don't know why) and he gets into Grub Rescue every time he boots his laptop.\nI have booted from my bootable windows installation pendrive, and I have tried Startup Repair with luck, but his laptop can not boot without my bootable pendrive. I have tried some commands mentioned in this site: How to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on? , but commands like bootrec.exe /fixboot does not work.\nI would be happy here answers from you guys!\n**As mentioned, I am a Windows User not a Linux User. So I would prefer cmd commands instead of grub commands.\n\nA: If the computer came with Windows 8, it's almost certainly booting in EFI mode, which means that older recovery instructions intended for Windows simply will not work. Instead, you should use a tool designed to edit the EFI boot order. In your situation, the easiest solution is likely to be to use the firmware itself; many EFIs provide an options page on which the boot order is listed. You'll probably see ubuntu as the first entry, with Windows Boot Manager somewhere below that. Use the firmware's tool to change the order, then save the changes and reboot. Unfortunately, not all computers provide this functionality, and even those that do vary greatly in their user interfaces, so you'll have to poke around until you find the right option -- and it's not guaranteed that you will find it!\nIf the option isn't present, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into an Ubuntu live disk.\n\n*Launch a Terminal window.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr to see the list of boot entries. Note the BootOrder line and locate the entries for ubuntu and Windows Boot Manager.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr -o ####, where #### is the number associated with the Windows boot manager. (You can add other options, perhaps just cutting out the ubuntu item and leaving the rest intact.)\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nIt's possible to do something similar in Windows using EasyUEFI or the Windows bcdedit command, but as Windows is not currently booting, you'd need to use a Windows emergency disk, and I'm not sure of the exact procedures.\nAnother option is to mount the EFI System Partition and delete the EFI/ubuntu directory from it. With it gone, the computer will skip the Ubuntu entry and move on to the next one, which is probably Windows.\nAll of this assumes an EFI-mode boot. If the computer is booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode (because Windows was upgraded from an earlier BIOS-mode Windows 7 install, because it was self-installed in BIOS mode, because it came from a \"mom & pop\" computer shop that installed in BIOS mode, etc.), another recovery procedure will be required. In brief, you must re-install the Windows boot loader to the MBR of the disk. IIRC, the Windows command bootrec /fixmbr should do this; however, I'm far from an expert on this task and I may be wrong or missing some critical step.\n\nA: If you can boot into your Windows partition in any way (via UEFI menu for example) you could install a program called 'dualboot repair' and run the automatic repair. It helped me when I messed up GRUB multiple times.\n", "Q: Uninstall a package & getting a long list Greetings Linux experts;\nI'm learning Ubuntu Linux for 2 months now and I'm really enjoying it.

Some of the proposed solutions involved deleting a folder in my home directory:  ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0. \nHowever, whenever I delete that folder, it immediately recreates itself.  \nWhy is this happening? How do I determine what is responsible for this happening?  \n\nA: The folder belongs to gstreamer package: \n\nGStreamer is a development framework for creating applications like\n  media players, video editors, streaming media broadcasters and so on\n\nIt is likely that whichever video/audio player you are using is relying on that framework, hence it's creating the config directory for it. Deleting it is somewhat pointless, as it will reappear. \n\nA: This can lead to complications and confusion, but there is a method that often works to keep certain files and directories from being created. Put something else in its place.\nrm -rf ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0 && ln -sf gstreamer-1.0 ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0\n\nThat should create a symlink at ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0 which cannot be resolved. A reasonably robust application may complain, but will continue without using that directory. A brittle application will have an aneurysm and crash.\nRegarding your webcam application, deleting the contents of that folder clears the gstreamer cache. That is probably sufficient to eliminate that as a cause of your problem. gstreamer will store its cache data somewhere, so preventing it from using its default location would not change how gstreamer functions.\nYour princess is in another castle.\n", "Q: Distorted xrdp session issue I've installed xrdp and I am using xfce4 as my desktop software.\nIn order to configure my xrdp to connected to a previously disconnected session, I've made changes as per this answer.\nHere is a part of my xrdp.ini file:\n[xrdp8]\nname=returning\nlib=libvnc.so\nusername=ask\npassword=ask\nip=127.0.0.1\nport=5912\n\nI made these changes and restarted xrdp service.

Now, if someone could suggest a good method I want to uninstall what I installed without effecting windows and do a clean install following the right procedure.\nPurpose is to use Ubuntu as platform for developing deep learning Python/C++ applications using NVIDIA GPU (Geforce GTX 950M).\nWhat I did:\n1. Created USB stick with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for installation (at that point I did not know about booting in UEFI mode; all I did was change the order in BIOS). By the way my BIOS is in UEFI mode.\n2. Tried installing NVDIA graphics driver and lost GUI screen. Restored it back later though by going to the original driver.\n3. Tried number of things to fix the dual boot issue. (If I remember correctly, I think it had worked for the first time and then onwards it does not normally. I can do F9 everytime and then boot either or but I wish to make it through Windows or GRUB boot loader).\nPlease suggest. Thanks!\nEDIT:\nI believe oldfred's solution and guide will work. I haven't tried it yet but I will update this post as I get that done. (In the mean-time feel free to add in).\n\nA: To boot grub first:\n(Usually F1 to enter BIOS)\nLocate UEFI / Legacy boot order in your BIOS. Set to legacy first.\n(It seems you have installed Legacy)\nIf that does not help locate boot order and move your ubuntu disk to the top (Or under USBkey).\nIf this fails you might consider:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nPlease read the whole article. \n", "Q: is there a way to restart ubuntu through shell into specific compiled kernel?

However, in new releases, I just see the kernel source package, and not a pre-built signed image which provides the version number, so I would need to somehow map the source package with the associated release number.\nThanks!\n\nA: 14.04 and 14.04.1 had kernel 3.13\n14.04.2 - 3.16\n14.04.3 - 3.19\n14.04.4 - 4.2\nSee LTS HWE Stack\nThe idea is that new installs on new hardware may need a new major kernels. Older kernels also get security and some hardware enablement updates.\nBut if you initially installed e.g. 14.04.2, and did updates, the Ubuntu version number will change to 14.04.3, then 14.04.4, but you will still have kernel 3.16.\nIf you want to install kernel 4.2 to the system that was not initially installed from an Ubuntu 14.04.4 image, you can run\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-wily\n\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 14.04LTS on my new toshiba laptop and remove windows 8 I have bought a new laptop Toshiba with Windows 8 as operating system, and I wanted to change it to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I am familiar with, but every time I tried to boot my USB and install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my laptop it was in vain, because every time appears a message of failure.\n\nA: If it's a windows 8 laptop, it might be a problem with secure boot, a technology that keeps non-windows OSes from loading. I don't know if Ubuntu is able to boot with secure boot turned on or not, but turning it off is worth a try. I'm not familiar with Toshiba's UEFI BIOS, but there should be lots of guides online.

If you are not in Amsterdam, it is important you run the following command with the correct two letter country that corresponds to your actual location. Also, if you travel to a different country, you should set the correct country to where ever you travel to so that you do not violate local radio frequency restrictions.\nIf you are not in Amsterdam, you can find a full list of two letter codes that correspond to all areas by running the command cat /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab. Again, use the correct country code. \nIn this example, I will post commands that will set the local country to Amsterdam using the country code NL\nsudo iw reg set NL\nsudo sed -i 's/REGDOMAIN=/REGDOMAIN=NL/g' /etc/default/crda\nsudo sed -i 's/REGDOMAIN=/REGDOMAIN=NL/g' /lib/crda/setregdomain\n\nYou should now have access to channels 12 & 13 on frequencies 2.467 and 2.472 respectively. You may want to use one of these channels in the future if one of these frequencies becomes less crowded.\nNext, there are 8 wifi networks using the same frequency channel that you are using and this can cause the major connectivity and performance issues.\nYou should use a frequency that is not so crowded. There are:\n\n\n*\n\n*8 people are using 2.462 (channel 11). \n\n*3 people are using 2.457 (channel 10). \n\n*2 People are using 2.422 (channel 3). \n\n*4 people are using 2.412 (channel 1).\n\n\nFrequencies not in use are: \n\n\n*\n\n*2.417 (channel 2)\n\n*2.432 (channel 5)\n\n*2.447 (channel 8)\n\n*2.467 (channel 12)\n\n\nIt looks like the least crowded frequency is 2.432 on channel 5.\nI strongly suggest you configure your wireless router to use the 2.432 frequency on channel 5 to prevent issues.\n\nAlso if you leave Europe, you can unset the Amsterdam regulatory domain by running the following command: \nsudo sed -i 's/REGDOMAIN=NL/REGDOMAIN=/g' /etc/default/crda\n\nPlease post any errors or let me know if this doesn't help.\n\nEDIT 1\nBecause that didn't work, you can often compensate for these types of issues by increasing your tx retry threshold.\nBy default, this is set to 7 to save power but many have found this is not sufficient in some areas.\nRun the following command when you have these issues to increase retry from 7 to 12:\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 retry short 12 \n\nThe above setting is not permanent and you will need to run this command after a reboot. You can check the retry limit by running the following command:\niwconfig | grep limit:..\n\nNext, you should adjust some of the powersave functions set by the module. Although \"powersave\" shows off in iwconfig, you most likely still have some of these parameters set through the module that need to be disabled in order to get good performance. This is typical for realtek drivers. \nRun the following command to create a config file for your driver module:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf\n\nCopy and paste the following lines into the file:\noptions rtl8723be ips=0\noptions rtl8723be fwlps=0\noptions rtl8723be swlps=0\noptions rtl8723be msi=0\noptions rtl8723be swenc=0\noptions rtl8723be debug=1\n\nPress CTRL + o and then press ENTER to save the file. Press CTRL + x to exit nano.\nYou can set debug= from 0 to 5. I believe 5 is the most verbose and 0 is off.\nThe module settings here are permanent. If you want to edit these settings, just edit the file /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf. \n(Note: Some people suggest setting swenc=0 to swenc=1 but the difference probably isn't noticeable either way.)\nFinally, run the following command to reload the module:\nsudo modprobe -r -f rtl8723be\nsudo modprobe rtl8723be\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nAgain, please post any errors or future issues.\n", "Q: 2016 glibc vunerability We are inheriting some older O.S's at another facility and apparently their support person has moved on.

I just recently learned that sudo apt-get update only updates the list of packages to their most recent versions and doesn't actually install or update your software until you do sudo apt-get upgrade. \nIs there any reason why apt-get update is not some automatic thing? Would it make sense to include sudo apt-get update as part of an automatic startup script somehow so we don't have to manually do it before running what we really want (the upgrade)? \n\nA: Technically speaking, the GUI version of apt-get update does it automatically already - those already cater to the needs of a desktop user. Command line tools   are more of a technical type of user, typically admins , who know what they're doing. \nHowever, there's nothing stopping you from making a script out of it, and reviewing logs every once in a while. For example, here's a quick sketch:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmain()\n{\n  local DATE=$(date +%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M)\n  local LOGFILE=AUTO_UPDATE_$DATE\n  local DIR=\"/home/localuser/logs\" # where to store logs\n\n  apt-get update &> \"$DIR\"/\"$LOGFILE\"\n}\n\nmain\n\nAnd use that as script to run upon shutdown or reboot using /etc/rc6.d directory scripts or alternatively - cronjob to schedule this script at specific time of day. Remember though that checking logs will be your responsibility. \nIn future, there will come snappy - a newer system for transactional updates which is now is in very young stage and supposedly should come to 16.04.  My experience with it is somewhat limited, but on Raspberry Pi it does update automatically and reboots itself once newer version of packages are available, sort of how Windows update works\nAddition\nPer muru's suggestion one could use unattended-upgrades to automate the updates as well, and probably in a less verbose way than my solution.\n\nA: Sometimes you just want to see what would be upgraded or what new packages are available for install. This is especially important if you are managing a server as upgrading some packages can cause problems. For a desktop user that doesn't care, the graphical software updater hides all this from you anyway.\n", "Q: How to add files to /var/www/html/ without using the terminal?

When searching for solutions to cursor jumping around, I found a lot of references to touchfreeze - a package that disables the touchpad while typing. But it is no longer part of any repository that I can find. All links to it are invalid.\nHow can I disable the touchpad while typing?\n\nA: The package was removed after 10.04 (and 10.04 is no longer supported, which is why you can't find it in the repositories). From the publishing history on Launchpad:\nRemoval requested on 2010-07-28.\nDeleted on 2010-07-28 by Jonathan Riddell\n(From Debian) ROM; superior alternative exists, never in stable; Debian bug #587415\n\nThe Debian bug report mentioned says:\n\nPlease consider removing touchfreeze from Debian:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*kde-config-touchpad is far superior software with   many improvements over touchfreeze\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*excellent KDE integration\n  \n*far more feature-full\n  \n*actively developed\n  \n  \n*touchfreeze was never in a Debian release so far\n\nSp, perhaps you should look into this kde-config-touchpad, whatever that is, if it still exists.\n\nA: The other answers are excellent, but I'd just like to note that in the \"Touchpad\" pane of the settings screen for \"Mouse and Touchpad\" in 15.10, there's a tickbox that says \"disable touchpad while typing\" and which does what it says on the tin.\nThis is Cinnamon with a theme so Unity or other desktops will look different but I promise the button is in the same spot :)\n\n\nA: You do not need a separate application to achieve that. \nOn 14.04\nSimply run:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad disable-while-typing true\n\nor\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad disable-while-typing false\n\nto either disable or enable touchpad while typing.\nOn 15.04+\nYou can use syndaemon in the background\nTo add syndaemon to startup applications:\nDash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && syndaemon\"\n\nExplanation\nThe cleanest solution is to use:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad disable-while-typing true\n\nHowever, the key does not exist in versions, later than 14.04. I tested syndaemon on my 15.10 laptop, and it did the job perfectly.\nSyndaemon has a number op options, of which the following seem the most important to me in your situation:\n-i <idle-time>\n    How many seconds to wait after the last key press before enabling the touchpad. (default is 2.0s). \n-m <poll-interval>\n    How many milliseconds to wait between two polling intervals. If this value is too low, it will cause unnecessary wake-ups. If this value is too high, some key presses (press and release happen between two intervals) may not be noticed. This switch has no effect when running with -R. Default is 200ms. \n\nSee also man syndaemon\n\nA: In more recent versions of Ubuntu / GNOME (where this setting has been removed from the system settings UI), you can toggle this setting with the \"Disable While Typing\" checkbox on the \"Keyboard & Mouse\" tab of GNOME Tweaks (sudo apt install gnome-tweaks).\nTweaks is a useful tool for a lot of these under-the-hood configuration options (similar to the Tweak UI PowerToy for Windows), and is a lot more human-friendly than gsettings.\n", "Q: Cannot find liboost-mt I'm using the kinect to get 3D models of soil erosion and to scan vegetation and I'm trying to compile this application for the kinect: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/gpc/imucam/index.html ,however when I run make I get the following error:\n    linking record_frames from record_frames.o fps.o frame.o grabber.o interactor.o os.o pick_player.o player.o reader.o recorder.o source.o um6.o viewer.o writer.o\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_serialization-mt\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_system-mt\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_filesystem-mt\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_thread-mt\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_date_time-mt\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_iostreams-mt\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_regex-mt\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_mpi-mt\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake: *** [record_frames.bin] Error 1\n\nI read the makefile and found:\nDEF_BOOST_LIBS := -lboost_serialization-mt -lboost_system-mt \\\n          -lboost_filesystem-mt -lboost_thread-mt \\\n          -lboost_date_time-mt -lboost_iostreams-mt \\\n          -lboost_regex-mt -lboost_mpi-mt\n\nSo, my question is how can I call my libbost.so libraries in the makefile.

Are you on a 64 bit machine and if you are, can you install the 64 bit boost packages?  \n\nIn a terminal, run  \n uname -a \n\nto see if your OS is 32 bit or 64 bit (X86_64 indicates 64 bit).

You can simply install the needed 64 bit boost packages with:\nsudo apt-get install  libboost-filesystem-dev  \n\nor simply force the 64 bit package by using libboost-filesystem-dev:amd64 .  You don't even have to worry about uninstalling the i386 versions, they are different directories, but if you do remove them, use the \":i386\" on the package name to select them over the 64 bit version.  \nOn my 14.04 system, I downloaded the latest kinect package (containing imucam-R186M_2014-05-29), added a boost library I was missing, edited the makefile to remove the \"-mt\"s, and everything successfully compiled with one openni warning.\n", "Q: using VNC with SSH securely While I know there is a plethora of available information on how to set up VNC for remote desktop viewing, some of which outlines the importance of using SSH to ensure security, I want to know dome more information.\nI had a scare with a brute force attack so I disabled Apache and file sharing over my network to be absolutely sure I wasnt compromised. \nI am wondering if using SSH with VNC is a completely secure method of desktop sharing without having my network bombarded with brute force attempts?\nRunning 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: Security is complex and you are asking several questions.\nFirst VNC is insecure and one of the most common cracks. This is because, by default, the VNC connection is not encrypted. So there are thus 2 problems-\n\n\n*\n\n*People use insecure passwords (most common problem).\n\n*The passwords are in plain text and thus can be read by packet\nsniffers (uncommon).\nSo yes tunneling VNC over ssh will solve the second problem, but, ssh alone will not solve all your problems because:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH does not enforce strong passwords.\n\n*SSH introduces a new server that must now be secured.\nSee also http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/vnc/sshvnc.html or similar\nFreenx is faster and more secure than VNC and uses encryption, so solves multiple issues.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX\nNow your second question is about \"having my network bombarded with brute force attempts\"\nYour network will be bombarded with brute force attempts if you install a server that enables password authentication such as logging into an Apache web page, ssh, freenx, FTP, etc, etc.\nThe solution there depends on what you want to do about it and may include things such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enforcing strong passwords.\n\n*A few iptables rules - see http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/iptables#Additional_Tips (scroll down to \"Use iptables to reject/block failed connections\").\n\n*Securing your server, varies by server, for ssh see - http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/SSH_security\n\n*Using a service such as fail2ban.\n\n\nSo, you see, your question is quite broad and there are multiple measures you can take to improve security (this is a short list). See any of the various security guides for more information\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicSecurity\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/security.html\nAnd ask a more specific question about a more specific part of security.  \n", "Q: Team Speak Installation Problem: Verifying Archive Integrity...

I can't seem to mimic my 15.10 install to get it working.\nBios on the laptop has been updated to the latest 1.12. \nDo I need to file a bug report? Are there any other possible solutions I could try? \n\nA: I found a fix for anyone else who is having this issue. \n\n\n*\n\n*First get into terminal and type gksudo gedit etc/default/grub.\n\n*Next, the grub.cfg file should pop up. Find GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\" and within the quotes type in i8042.reset i8042.nomux i8042.nopnp i8042.noloop.\nSo it should look like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"i8042.reset i8042.nomux i8042.nopnp i8042.noloop\"\n\nHit save.\n\n*Next, you need to open up another terminal window and update grub by typing in sudo update-grub and finally restart.\nThis worked for me on Ubuntu 16.04 daily with 4.5 RC7.

Before I dive in to Ubuntu, and spend all the time reading and learning what I can, I prefer to use my own computer to store my stuff. Ubuntu's warning at the bottom of the browser stating Ubuntu uses cookies, for my benefit; sounds like Microsoft - not Open Source. Does one have to use the cloud, or can they maintain their own control over their data, and, does Ubuntu 'fee' use any kind of tracking/stalking monitoring tools - not counting cookies?\nEverything is free on the Internet, one just has to pay for it; either with currency, or privacy. Does Ubuntu do both? Yeah, yeah the Terms of Use and Privacy. Know of a free Philadelphia lawyer to explain it in English?\nI think Ubuntu could be the one to tell Micro$oft to stuff-it :) but it's not like installing Windoze, it's much more complicated. I hope Ubuntu tries to make it easier.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu is free. You don't have to pay for it in currency or privacy.\nPossible concerns:\n\n\n*\n\n*It used to be that Canonical stuck a deal with Amazon, and allowed searches on a standard Ubuntu desktop to go to Amazon after being anonymized by Canonical servers. It was on by default and could be easily disabled, but, following backlash, it's now disabled by default (see How can I remove Amazon search results from the dash or disable the feature?, Ubuntu with spyware?).\n\n*Tracking could be via the Popularity Contest, which tracks installation statistics - but this is also opt-in and anyonymous. (What is the 'popularity-contest' package for?)\n\n*There's also the recommendation system used by Ubuntu Software Centre, but that's going away soon and there haven't been many privacy concerns about it that I know of. (What data does the Software Centre use to give you recommendations?)\nAs for the cloud, Ubuntu used to have a cloud service called Ubuntu One, and it's long since dead. Now Ubuntu One exists as a single-sign-on (SSO) service for other Canonical products (Launchpad, Ubuntu Forums, Ubuntu Wiki, etc.). It was also opt-in while it existed.\n", "Q: mysql-workbench: Error log Permission denied I recently installed mysql-workbench by installing first apt-config.deb from mysql website and then install the actuall mysql with sudo apt-get install mysql-workbenh (I used sudo for almost everything).

When I was going to issue the commands sudo sysctl -w kernel.sysrq=1 and echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger with root permission, the console got stuck and showed few messages like the attached console image. I waited for a long time then reboot it, no crash log was written.  \n\n(2) By using JUJU charm: according to the steps in JUJU crash dump charm, I deployed ubuntu on host machine with juju deploy ubuntu and used JUJU GUI to deploy crash dump and add relation. This time it shows more details, but it gets stuck on CR2: 0000000000000000 like second attached image below. \n\nFrom other Q&A info in google, the next step expected to do after stuck console should be \n<blink>\n[    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpuset \n[    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpu\n[    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpuacct\n...\n\n\n(3) I only use MAAS to deploy Ubuntu OS on machine. And install kdump manually with the ubuntu kernel-crash-dump guide in (1). And the testing still gets stuck like \"first\" attached image. \nFurthermore, I change password of Ubuntu account by executing sudo passwd ubuntu to do testing via Ubuntu account permission since it was created by MAAS  (whoami shows Ubuntu account as root). But it shows the result of the \"second\" attached image.  \n(4) Install Ubuntu server OS and kernel-crash-dump manually on host machine.\nThe testing was success and the crash log was generated on /var/crash as expected.\nEach time the kdump config was checked before the testing by commands like example below and everything seems fine:\n<blink>\n# cat /proc/cmdline\nBOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-77-generic root=UUID=8e8764a1-3d79-4f6e-945e-f30e42ea5f5a ro crashkernel=384M-:128M\n\n# cat /sys/kernel/kexec_loaded\n0\n# cat /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_loaded\n1\n\n# kdump-config show\nDUMP_MODE:        kdump\nUSE_KDUMP:        1\nKDUMP_SYSCTL:     kernel.panic_on_oops=1\nKDUMP_COREDIR:    /var/crash\ncrashkernel addr: 0x2c000000\ncurrent state:    ready to kdump\n\n kexec command:\n  /sbin/kexec -p --command-line=\"BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-77-generic root=UUID=8e8764a1-3d79-4f6e-945e-f30e42ea5f5a ro irqpoll maxcpus=1 nousb\" --initrd=/boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-77-generic /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-77-generic\n\n\nI am still confused on why deployed Ubuntu OS by MAAS and JUJU can not execute kdump testing and have no idea to debug. \nThanks.\n\nA: After reproduce this problem myself using JuJu/MAAS, I found out MAAS deployment install quite a few packages:\nInstalling package: curl\nInstalling package: cpu-checker\nInstalling package: bridge-utils\nInstalling package: rsyslog-gnutls\nInstalling package: cloud-utils\nInstalling package: cloud-image-utils\nInstalling package: tmux\n\nSome of the packages recreate the initrd file to a much larger size:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 24964912 Apr 18 16:32 /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-85-generic\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 24978648 Jun  7 09:32 /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-87-generic\n\nSo the default crashkernel=384M-:128M parameter that added by kdump-tools became too small.

I tried to install Lightroom opening with Wine and it did not work is there any other app that will run windows programs?\n\nA: You can install lightroom using playonlinux which is a frontend for wine. Many apps that don't install well on wine will install using playonlinux.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\nIf using AMD or Nvidia, you reportedly must use it with Nvidia or AMD proprietary drivers. If you use intel graphics, some people have had success with i5 but it may or may not work.\nYou can install the Nvidia or AMD proprietary drivers by clicking on Additional Drivers and selecting them from there.\nClick here for more info.\nAlso here.\n\nAlternatively, now that you are using linux, you might as well use darktable as an alternative:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install darktable\n\n\nA: Just don't try to run by Wine or any similar. I've already tried with many different configs, and my only choice was create a Windows virtual machine on Virtual Box, and config it with a lot of resources. It's too heavy and there is not a lot of people trying to make it work, unfortunately.\nI'd suggest you dual boot (yes...), this VM try, and then, Darktable.

Run crontab with the command crontab -eand insert your command and the desired timing. To run a job at a certain time as root, just run sudo crontab -e when creating the rule. Rules follow the following scheme:\nminute hour day month weekdays yourbashcommandhere\n\nFor example, if you wanted to run the job every wednesday at 10am, your rule should look like this:\n* 10 * * 3 yourbashcommand\n\nMore info on timing options can be found here: http://www.adminschoice.com/crontab-quick-reference\n\nA: You can either run crontab scedule a certain command \n    Sudo crontab -e\nThen edit it like this\n\nMinutes hour day month weekday\n\nTo connect to openvpn server at every mondat 9 am\n* 9 * * 1   openvpn --config server.ovpn\n\nOr use at its easier but it works once untill you set it again\nSudo apt-get install at\nat 09:00\n\"Your commands press enter for multiple commands and ctrl+d to apply the job\"\n\natq \n\"To see sceduled jobs\"\n\natrm \"jobnumber to delete the job\"\n\n", "Q: take output from the mysql and stored into excel i have database under that one table. for eg test_table. in that\n  name age sex edu   job    timein              doj\n  yyy   33  m   bsc  comp   22/3/13 12:32:44    3/2/11\n  xxx   22  f   mca  soft   22/3/13 11:30:11    11/10/09\n  zzz   44  f   puc  clerk  22/3/13 12:00:24    5/11/08\n\ncommand\n mysql -u root -ppass123  -e \"use test_db; select name,age, sex,edu,job,timein,doj from test_table;\"\n\nhow to convert into excel\n\nA: Move to the directory where you would later like to have your CSV file saved.

I'm currently working on a project that requires me to connect remotely to a MSSQL database on a different server. \nAfter some research and crawling of this site and google I think one of the problems is that the current LAMP server I am working on using Ubuntu 14.04.2 doesn't have the extensions on PHP needed to connect to MSSQL. I think I know what extensions are needed but I am apprehensive of following through with the installation through fear of losing current MySQL configs and databases.\nIs this an irrational fear that I shouldn't worry about (i.e installing what PHP needs to run MSSQL functions doesn't affect MySQL in anyway) or am I right to be apprehensive?\nThanks,\n\nA: PHP packages has support for connecting to MSSQL server.  The support is included in php5-sybase package.  In PHP 5.6 you can still use the obsolete MSSQL functions, but I urge you to use pdo_dblib extension (it's compiled with freetds library, but it can be used to connect to MSSQL server) as the old extension has been dropped in PHP 7.\nHere's the link to the documentation: http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-dblib.php and don't forget to use dblib as your DSN prefix as the extension is compiled with FreeTDS on Ubuntu. \nThe additional modules won't affect existing modules.  If you install f.e. php5-pgsql it won't affect existing MySQL module, same goes with pdo-dblib.  It will just add more functions.\n", "Q: Issu while Installing Intel Parallel studio in Ubuntu 14.04 I am trying to install Intel Parallel studio in Ubuntu 14.04.

Is there a way to disable opening the dash when I press the \"Super\"/\"Windows\" button?\n\nA: One way to achieve this is to use CompizConfig Settings Manager.\nIt does not come preinstalled with Ubuntu by default, so you probably have to install it first:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nAlternatively you can also click this link to install it through your Software Center: Install\nWhen it's installed, launch it with the command ccsm or search it in the Dash.\nYou will see a window like this:\n\nSelect the Ubuntu Unity Plugin, then switch to the Launcher tab in there.\nThe first option is what you're looking for:\n\nKey to show the Dash, Launcher and Help Overlay\n\nYou can set a new shortcut or entirely disable it using the three buttons on the right.\n\n\nA: I suspect you want to stop Ubuntu/Unity from intercepting the Super key (which is the key with the Windows logo on it).\nOne possible solution would be to install the unity-tweak-tool as suggested in this question:\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nLaunch the unity-tweak-tool.

A 2-page PDF is easily 800kb, and three pages are well over 1MB. This is a problem, since I cannot easily e-mail 10 of these documents to someone quickly.\nExporting a page with around the same amount of text within LibreOffice results in PDF files at least 10 times smaller.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\nI cannot use image compression, since these pages contain only vectors.\nIncidentally, I am using Ubuntu 15.10.\nThanks in advance!\nEDIT: I have already tried Ghostscript with various -dPDFSETTINGS=/ settings. That, however, does not work, since it only applies to raster images. I have also tried converting to/from SVG, PS and EPS. I am still stuck with preposterously huge vector PDF files.\n\nA: cups-pdf has been broken for a long time.  It produces very large PDF files that encapsulate images and do not support text selection (for copy-paste).  \nA decent alternative is the Tea4CUPS virtual printer. \nIt works well most of the time for me, but sometimes printing with Tea4CUPS will abort -- in those cases, I resort to the Ubuntu built-in Print to File option.\n\nA: Maybe ghostscript can help you compress your PDFs, as it will reduce their size and also optimize them for viewing them on screen rather than on paper:\ngs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen \\\n-dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=out.pdf in.pdf\n\nAlternatively maybe the answers to this question might be helpful.\n", "Q: Start VeraCrypt \"Portable\" with relative path to a profilefolder? After extracting and executing the VeraCrypt binary from tmp, VeraCrypt creates a profile-folder containing the favourite Volumes and Configuration XMLs under .VeraCrypt in ~ as usual.\nIs there any way to start the binary with a relative, custom set path to a profile-folder like I can do with a command-line/script for Thunderbird Portable or Firefox with e.g.\n\"$PWD/thunderbird/thunderbird\" -no-remote -profile \"$PWD/profilefolder\"\n\n\nA: I can't find anything to that effect in the Linux documentation of VeraCrypt. Maybe a symbolic link from ~/.VeraCrypt to a directory on the removable medium suits your needs and can serve as a work-around.\nMy other idea is to file an enhancement request with the VeraCrypt project to respect the XDG Base Directory Specification and store their configuration files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/VeraCrypt instead of the current location. Then you could set the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable of the VeraCrypt application starter to point to a directory on the external storage medium.

I'm building a new computer on which I want to use Linux (probably Ubuntu) as it's OS. I already picked all the hardware except the GPU. I can't chose between Nvidia or AMD.\nLink to my build on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/ref=nav_wishlist_btn\nMy CPU is AMD's FX 8320 (3,5 GHZ, 8 core) so at first I picked R7 360X for my GPU but then I took a look at some forums and find a benchmark which was made about a year ago. Here is the link:http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=amdnv-phoronix-11&num=1\nFrom the benchmarks I could clearly see that Nvidia wins over AMD. I also know that AMD has never had a good drivers support on Linux and was always lacking behind, but I know that they had improved a lot in past few years.  I also know that there is nothing wrong to have an AMD's CPU together with Nvidia's GPU and that you won't have any decrease in performance. Please correct me if I'm mistaking. The question I want to ask you is the following. \nWhich one should I pick then? AMD's R7 360X or Nvidia's GTX 750ti?\n\nA: Even if this is opinion based, I definitely recommend to choose the NVIDIA GPU. Not only because of the performance benchmarks, most important of all is the drivers support for the operating system. Ubuntu always ships with the latest stable drivers from the NVIDIA long-lived branch. Additionally the latest official drivers are available from the Proprietary GPU drivers PPA. Generally the NVIDIA drivers support is way better than the drivers support  from AMD.\nThe installation process works easy and smooth, when everything is done correctly.\n", "Q: running shell script using c program I wrote a script to hide user input during runtime it works as a simple script but i want to integrate into c program but gives following errors:\nwarning: missing whitespace after macro name \n\nerror: expected ')' before 'Password' \n\ncan someone tell me what i'm doing wrong.\nHere's the c program: \n#include\"header.h\"\n#define SHELLSCRIPT\"\\\n#bin/bash\\n\\\nprintf\"Password Please:\"\\n\\\n\nstty -echo\\n\\\n\nread pass\\n\\\n\nstty echo\\n\\\n\nprintf'\\n'\\n\\\n\nsleep\"2\"\\n\\\n\necho \"$pass\"\\n\\\n\n\"\n\nint main()\n\n{\n\nputs(\"Will execute sh with following script:\");\n\nputs(\"SHELLSCRIPT\");\n\nputs(\"Starting now\");\n\nsystem(SHELLSCRIPT);\n\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\n\nA: Here is a fixed version of your code:\n// Compile with:\n// gcc     c-shellscript.c   -o c-shellscript\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define SHELLSCRIPT \"\\\nprintf 'Password Please:';\\n\\\nstty -echo;\\n\\\nread pass;\\n\\\nstty echo;\\n\\\nprintf '\\\\n';\\n\\\nsleep 2;\\n\\\necho $pass;\"\n\nint main()\n\n{\n\n  puts(\"Will execute sh with following script:\");\n\n  puts(\"---------\");\n  puts(SHELLSCRIPT);\n  puts(\"---------\");\n\n  puts(\"Starting now\");\n\n  system(SHELLSCRIPT);\n\n  return 0;\n\n}\n\nHowever, I don't think it is good practice to do things this way.\nIt is also much much easier to create a separate shellscript file and just call that instead, even if you generate the shellscript file from within your code.\nHave a look at these for more info:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3736210/how-to-execute-a-shell-script-from-c-in-linux\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/a/646260/105315\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/245600/using-a-single-system-call-to-execute-multiple-commands-in-c\n", "Q: Running command in a new bash shell process I have looked around as I would've thought this would be a rather common question, but nothing seems to be working for me.\nBasically I'm trying to SSH into a device (Raspberry Pi) to run a process.

What exactly do I need to do in my shell script to run a command in a new bash shell process?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can use ssh with -n option as,\nssh -Xn user@hostname <command> <argument>\n\nUse of -X is optional to forward X11. In your case,\nssh -n user@hostname node ./bin/www\n\nExample: To open a text file (file.txt) in remote machine with gedit,\nssh -Xn user@hostname gedit file.txt\n\nFrom man ssh\n-n      A common trick is to use this to run X11 programs on a remote machine.  For example,\n         ssh -n shadows.cs.hut.fi emacs & will start an emacs on shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11 connection will be\n         automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel.  The ssh program will be put in the background.\n\n\nA: To do this using shell:\nssh -t master 'bash -ic \"{ cd <my-location>; node ./bin/www ;} &\"'\n\nA bit strict using disown (nohup can be used too):\nssh -t master 'bash -ic \"{ cd <my-location>; node ./bin/www ;} & disown\"'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-t will allocate a pseudo TTY to enable job control\n\n*bash -i will make the shell interactive, otherwise the connection to the master will be closed\nIn your case, you can get away without the command grouping {}:\nssh -t master 'bash -ic \"cd <my-location>; node ./bin/www &\"'\n\n", "Q: Minecraft \"Connection Lost Timed Out\" Hello I have been running Minecraft fine on Ubuntu 15.10, but I decided to install Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS.

What should I do to fix this?\n\nA: I had similar problems with minecraft in recent weeks.

The documentation on HAProxy is astoundingly bad. I'm guessing it has something to do with rsyslogd?\nThe files are normally kept in the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory.\n\nA: From a blog post:\n\nThanks for this! It saved me a lot of time.\nOne thing I'd suggest changing -- in Ubuntu Oneiric (and I suspect in\n  older versions), the rsyslogd config you specify will leave haproxy\n  logging in both /var/log/haproxy_1.log and in /var/log/syslog. This is\n  because rsyslogd writes each message out using every rule in its\n  configuration that matches unless specifically told not to.\nThe \"& ~\" at the end of your file /etc/rsyslog.d/haproxy.conf means\n  \"once you've written something using the rule above, don't process any\n  more rules for this message\". But it won't stop messages from being\n  written out by rules that were specified before the one in\n  /etc/rsyslog.d/haproxy.conf\nNow, the default Oneiric config has a file called\n  /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf which does the default configuration,\n  including a catch-all \"write everything to syslog\" rule. And because\n  files from /etc/rsyslog.d/ are included in alphabetical order, the\n  rules in 50-default.conf are applied before the ones in haproxy.conf\n  -- so you get your haproxy stuff dumped into both files.\nThe solution is obviously to call your own rsyslogd config file\n  something like /etc/rsyslog.d/49-haproxy.conf\n\n", "Q: Best way to read a config file in bash What is the best way to read a config file in bash?\nFor example, you have a script and aren't willing to fill in all the config manually each time you call the script.  \nEdit 1:\nI think I didn't make it clear, so: what I want is... I have a configfile which is like  \nvariable_name value  \nvariable_name value ...  \n\nand I want to read that. I know I could just grep it for the arguments I'm looking for or so... but maybe there's a more intelligent way :)\n\nA: As mbiber said, source another file. For example, your config file (say some.config) would be:\nvar1=val1\nvar2=val2\n\nAnd your script could look like:\n#! /bin/bash\n\n# Optionally, set default values\n# var1=\"default value for var1\"\n# var1=\"default value for var2\"\n\n. /path/to/some.config\n\necho \"$var1\" \"$var2\"\n\n\nThe many files in /etc/default usually serve as configuration files for other shell scripts in a similar way. A very common example from posts here is /etc/default/grub. This file is used to set configuration options for GRUB, since grub-mkconfig is a shell script that sources it:\nsysconfdir=\"/etc\"\n#…\nif test -f ${sysconfdir}/default/grub ; then\n  . ${sysconfdir}/default/grub\nfi\n\n\nIf you really must process configuration of the form:\nvar1 some value 1\nvar2 some value 2\n\nThen you could do something like:\nwhile read var value\ndo\n    export \"$var\"=\"$value\"\ndone < /path/to/some.config\n\n(You could also do something like eval \"$var=$value\", but that's riskier than sourcing a script. You could inadvertently break that more easily than a sourced file.)\n\nA: Obviously, I am not the bash specialist here, but the concept should not be different in whatever language you use:\nAn example\nIn the example below, you can use a (very) basic script to either set a string, or print a string, as set in your config file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# argument to set a new string or print the set string\narg=$1\n# possible string as second argument\nstring=$2\n# path to your config file\nconfigfile=\"$HOME/stringfile\"\n\n# if the argument is: \"set\", write the string (second argument) to a file\nif [ \"$arg\" == \"set\" ]\nthen\necho \"$string\" > $configfile \n# if the argunment is \"print\": print out the set string, as defined in your file\nelif [ \"$arg\" == \"print\" ]\nthen \necho \"$( cat $configfile )\"\nfi\n\nThen\n\n\n*\n\n*To set a string into your config file:\n$ '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test.sh' set \"Een aap op een fiets, hoe vind je zoiets?\"\n\n\n*Subsequently, to print out the string, as defined in your \"configfile\":\n$ '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test.sh' print\nEen aap op een fiets, hoe vind je zoiets?\n\nOf course, in a real applied script, you need to add a lot of stuff to make sure the arguments are correct, decide what to do when input is incorrect, settings file does not exist etc, but:\nThis is the basic idea \n\nA: I am using this one...\n#!/bin/bash\n\nCFG_FILE=/etc/test.conf\nCFG_CONTENT=$(cat $CFG_FILE | sed -r '/[^=]+=[^=]+/!d' | sed -r 's/\\s+=\\s/=/g')\neval \"$CFG_CONTENT\"\n\nConf file is parsed with sed and then evaluated as simple variable asignments\nFirst sed parsing key values (supports also = surrounded with spaces)\nSecond sed removes spaces around = sign for valid variable asignment\nFuther sed treatment can be added\nAll other not matching text in conf file will be removed (including # or ; commentary and other)\nBe aware that single line shell commands can be also evaluated from this config file!\n\nA: #------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# parse the ini like $0.$host_name.cnf and set the variables\n# cleans the unneeded during after run-time stuff.

I was use dd command to copy my 500GB hard-disk into my new 1TB hard disk.\nAfter 9 hours system display message everything was successfully copied but I can't display any data into my new hard disk. I go through following steps.\nstep1:-\n\nAfter that system disply message :- step2:-\nbut now 1 TB HDD can't display anything. \n How to solve that issue?\n\nA: Recently I've had to use dd for recovery and image work.  I used it intensively some 10 years back for cloning drives and backing up partitions.  I must say that it's use is light-years away from direct and simple.  With respect to HDDs, you need to know exactly how the drive is structured at the lowest level.  For this you need other programs that you can trust (fdisk, sfdisk, cfdisk, etc.)  Trust only comes from experimentation with known objects and examining the results -- not from word of mouth.  I'm in agreement with muru's initial comment about wrong dd command, but more should be said.  if=/dev/sda starts reading at the very beginning of the device (byte address 0) while of=/dev/sdb1 writes to the first partition of device b.  The result is that your sda-MBR resides at sdb-part1, along with your OS, etc., and I don't know what will happen when it gets to the end of sdb1, if it's larger than sdb1.\nI'm guessing that sda is the boot device and you want sdb to also be your boot device, but maybe you just want sdb1 to be a backup clone.  Your question is vague about this. You might be able to copy partition to partition if they are exactly the same size but maybe the OS has meta-data about the partition filesystem that doesn't match, so it can't 'view' it.\nIf you just want a clone for backup then maybe your command is ok, but there are issues about reaching the end of the partition and over-writing the next partition, and whether your OS will object to the filesystem destruction on sdb1 (booting still from sda1(?)).\nIn principal, such might work, but it's probably better to write sda to sdb only and forget about booting from sdb, it's just a clone for reading.\nYou could probably write to file if you had extFAT or some system that accepted 500GB file sizes, but I doubt that you do.\nThere are dozens of other questions as well. If you wanted to transfer to sdb and later boot from it, you must know the bytes and sectors to copy and include that in your command -- making sure your output drive has the size necessary, again /dev/sda to /dev/sdb should work except for some problems that I've encountered.  Namely, what should dd do if it encounters a read error that is common on older used drives?  You can set dd to ignore them but what then does it write?  In my experience, it writes nothing, thus that 512 bytes (normal traditional block, but your disk might be different; newer drives may use 4096 byte blocks) is taken out of the write and all further bytes are shifted 'to the left' of where they should be.  This happens for each read error that maybe you've optioned to ignore because a read error stops dd cold and a restart is painfully hard.  In short, dd for cloning can be done, but it should be done in a bash script with an error recovery loop that fills unread blocks with nulls, the command should specify exact block counts, and you should know exactly the low-level format of the drives involved.  In the end, it's probably best for serious cloning to use a dedicated open source c executable that does what dd and sfdisk do but more professionally.  But, I'll admit that dd is useful.  It's like a Bowie knife on your belt -- impressive and powerful, but with limited usefulness.\nAlso, OSs can check for UUIDs stored in free space and other places on HDD and can object to booting if they don't match.  This is one of the black art areas of OS competitiveness.  Official software knows these things.)\nGPT tables are also important, even essential these days, unlike 10 years ago.  And EFI boot partitions complicate things too.  With the little I know about low-level disk formatting, I won't even waste my time trying to clone a whole disk.  Parts of the disk might be useful for very special problems.  Ignoring LVM and its significance, a partition might usefully be cloned but \nonly for reading back to the original drive (no OS mixing, boot changes, etc.) To transfer a bootable 500GB drive to make a 1TB bootable system, assuming the OS doesn't object to a different drive (hardware signatures?),\nthen my suggestion for a successful experiment would be to make the low-level formatting on the 1TB drive exactly like the 500GB drive -- I mean exactly!  You must examine the MBR and GPT tables with a hex editor.  Then dd the partitions byte-for-byte to the new drive.  Then, boot-up the 1TB drive (assuming success) and make another partition in the new 500GB of additional space, or expand the partition and live filesystem, if you have and trust such software.  Trust in this realm is hard to find because this stuff is difficult and disastrous if gotten wrong.  Better to buy a new system or software with a great reputation and SHA256SUMed so you can check its integrity.  Digital systems are by nature volatile and impermanent, so best \nto get used to change, if you need more than what you have.\n\nA: This problem was created by an incorrect dd command.\nAccurate dd command for disk cloning is:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb\n\nsda and sdb point to the hard-disks themselves, which includes the partition table as well. if= points to the input file (in this case, /dev/sda), and of= points to the output file (/dev/sdb).\ndd command is time consuming but it is more trusted and also default system tool so I gave priority to dd.\n \nAfter successful operation, the next step is to restart the system,\nthen your new hard-disk will look like this:\n\nHere is the second last step, that is also required after dd:\nUse Gparted utility to resize the extended partition.

If you just want to try Ubuntu you can use a LiveUSB without modifying your current install, or a virtual machine with something like VirtualBox. \n\nA: If you use Wubi \"No root file system is defined\" means that linux drivers cannot use your file /ubuntu/disks/root.disk. \nWubi.exe creates an empty file /ubuntu/disks/root.disk on Windows with Windows drivers and a setup file for Ubiquity. \nAfter first reboot Ubiquity should process the setup file automatically and should use the file /ubuntu/disks/root.disk.

Currently Ubuntu is working on integrating the GNOME Software Center into Ubuntu, and will be developing a method to integrate its upcoming snappy app packaging system into the GNOME Software Center.  As far as electron-based app submissions are concerned, I don't think there should be a huge problem if, in the end, it is just a deb file or snappy package.  At the same time, I could be wrong and it would be better to ask a more credible source about that.  I would suggest talking to some developers who have deployed and maintain packages in the Ubuntu Software Center.  Plus, you could also just simply offer a PPA or a deb file for download on a website, or from Github (like for example, Github does for its Atom text editor, which is another Electron based app).\n", "Q: How can I assign another static IP address to another LAN Card?

I've been using GNU Screen for some time and have become accustomed to the following workflow, where I will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Split a region into two windows (C-a \" or C-a |)\n\n*Open new shells up in these two windows and cycle through them as needed (C-a c, C-a n, etc).\n\n\nThis workflow means I can keep the window split vertically and have documentation open in the left pane, and cycle through various other shells (with other commands running) in the right pane without disturbing the left. I can't seem to do this in tmux.\nIn tmux I can obvious split a window into panes in a similar fashion, but I don't seem to be able to open new shells in each pane and cycle through them like I can in GNU Screen. Is this a deficiency of tmux, or have I just missed the relevant command in the man page?\n\nA: Either you're looking to reorder the panes or looking into something like having tmux windows inside of a tmux pane.\nFor the first one, check \nCtrl+b Meta+[1-5]\n\nFor the second one, that's a difference between tmux and screen.\nTmux differentiates between a window and a pane. Screen only has windows. That's why when you split and detach, it won't remember how it was (if things haven't changed).\nNow, in order to do something like that in Tmux, all I can think of is either nesting Tmux sessions or using join-pane: (v2.1)\n join-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]\n               (alias: joinp)\n         Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and creating a new pane, split it and move src-pane into the space.  This can be used to reverse break-pane.  The -b option causes src-pane to be\n         joined to left of or above dst-pane.\n\n         If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.\n\nBased on that I found this answer, https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/14301 that has a bit of an example you might want to use:\n# pane movement\nbind-key j command-prompt -p \"join pane from:\"  \"join-pane -s '%%'\"\nbind-key s command-prompt -p \"send pane to:\"  \"join-pane -t '%%'\"\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Problem with booting Windows 7 alongside Ubuntu 14.04 I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 alongside my Windows 7 Professional.

This could be considered a slightly more complex application to use than the Software Center\n\n*You can use text-based methods via a Terminal screen utilizing either aptitude or apt-get. Again these are considered more 'advanced' techniques than the Software Center and accomplish the same outcome.\n\n*You can install downloaded 'deb' packages from carefully selected sources away from the Ubuntu Repositories using either the graphical manager gdebi or the commandline dpkg.\n\n*You can add a Personal Package Archive (PPA) to your system and this will often fill any gaps in required applications or even more up to date applications than can be found in the Ubuntu Repositories\n\n\nThere are a few more options for installing precompiled software (see the link in the References below) but these are the basics.

I'm routing all traffic from the other physical machines through 10.14.0.1 with their eth0.  Each other machine is configured with eth1 being connected to the public switch and using the public fabric, but a undesignated ip.  The 'internal' cluster interface is managed and handles dhcp and dns, the public is unmanaged.  Each machine also has a seperate IPMI interface connected to the internal switch with static IPs assigned, 10.14.0.10/11/12/13 etc..\nEverything has worked as I expected.  I've installed using Autopilot and set the proper public subnet for openvswitch.  Landscape, Horizon, etc.. are issued a 10.14.0.0 address within the static and dynamic ranges.

I do pretty good by following instructions I find on the internet.\nI have an old Asus X75a laptop that I am replacing the hard drive in going from 1TB to 2TB. I thought what a great time to set up a dual boot machine!\nBut it is not quite working. What I tried was using Acronis I cloned my old drive to my new drive. Then I resized my partitions to make a partition for Ubuntu. I also made a small partition and formatted it as swap. Then I installed Ubuntu to the new partition that I made for it, formatted as ext4 mount /. That all installs quite nicely but then I never see an option to boot into Ubuntu, we go straight to Windows. (At least that works!)\nSearching the internet it seems that maybe my problem is UEFI? And that dual booting isn't possible. I feel like I am 80% there though and just missing something and can pull this off. Would greatly appreciate any help.\nThanks!\n-AJ\n\nA: First, check your firmware settings for anything referring to the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) or \"legacy boot support\" and disable any such option you find. (A few EFIs phrase these differently; they refer to \"UEFI boot support\" or something similar, which must then be enabled.) It's clear that you're booting your Ubuntu installation and repair media in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, but Windows is installed in EFI/UEFI mode. It's this discrepancy that's causing your problem.\nSecond, you must install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. There are two relatively easy ways to do this and many more harder ways. The two easier ways are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Repair -- This program will re-install GRUB; however, you must boot an Ubuntu repair disc in EFI mode for this to work. If you can't boot your Ubuntu install/repair disc after disabling your CSM, that means it wasn't prepared correctly; see here for more on that topic. Note also that, although Boot Repair usually works, sometimes it doesn't, and on rare occasions it will render the computer unbootable, so you should be prepared for that possibility.\n\n*rEFInd -- This program, which I maintain, is an alternative to GRUB, but with some important differences. You can download a USB flash drive or CD-R image with rEFInd from its downloads page, prepare a boot medium with it, and boot it. This should then let you boot both Windows and Ubuntu. If both options work, install the PPA or Debian package in Ubuntu. rEFInd will then take over as the default boot manager and everything should work.\n\n\nA: In the end I had to punt. I went into the Boot Set up and selected the reset to defaults option. That locked everything up. I kept getting some kind of invalid signature error. And it didn't matter what kind of combination of CSM/Secure boot settings I did. Nothing worked. So I formatted the whole drive, downloaded a Windows 10 .iso and installed that and then Ubuntu 15.10 next to it. It took me about 4 attempts to get the partitioning right and I still have way too big of a partition necessary for SWAP. But everything works. I reloaded all of my previously backed up files and I can access them all from Linux or Windows. Thanks again for all the help. I learned a lot along the way.\n", "Q: Draftsight \"failed to load modules\" I'm working on ubuntu 15.10 64-bit, before I was using 14.04 LTS.\nWhen I installed Draftsight with (Gdebi) every time I want to start Draftsight I get this message:\nFailed to load modules . the application will close please reinstall the application  \n\nNOTE: it was working well on the 14.04.\nI tried to reinstall it and I got the same message.\nI tried to install i386 files and also no new result.\n\n\nA: I had same problem for draftsight 2016 Sp1 in Ubuntu 16.04 and solved by install gstreamer0.10-x after I read this:\n\nqwerty1417235 commented on 2015-08-30 06:26:\n@Crispy24 installing gstreamer0.10-base instead of gstreamer0.10 and gstreamer0.10-plugins is ok.

For example:\nfun! s:set_bg(timer_id)\n  let &background = (strftime('%H') < 12 ? 'light' : 'dark')\nendfun\ncall timer_start(1000 * 60, function('s:set_bg'), {'repeat': -1})\ncall s:set_bg(0)  \" Run on startup\n\nThis will run s:set_bg() every 1 minute (60,000 milliseconds), and\nby setting repeat to -1 it will run indefinitely (rather than just\nonce).\nAs far as I've been able to see in my (short) testing, this doesn't\ncause any side-effects such as slow-downs or flickering. You can\nconsider changing the logic to set background only if it differs\nfrom the current value if it does (but looks like Vim is smart enough\non its own).\n\nFor your specific case, you can add the following in your .vimrc to use light background between 07:00 and 20:00 and dark otherwise:\nfun! s:set_bg(timer_id)\n    let &background = (strftime('%H') >= 07 && strftime('%H') < 20 ?

I installed lxd to use linux containers. For some reason I keep using lxc commands to install and start my containers. Since lxd seems to be close to lxc maybe there is a reason for that (but it is not clear).\nI wanted to bind two lxc containers to two different bridges, different from the default lxcbr0 one. I created br1 and br2 and gave them IP addresses. They work fine and are pingable.\nI am now trying to locate the place where I should change the configuration of my containers (cont1 and cont2) in order to have their eth0 (the interface name can be kept the same for each of those guests) bound to respectively br1 and br2.\nThe documentation states that \n\nThen, specify the host's bridge in the container configuration file in\n  place of lxcbr0, for instance\n\nWhere is this configuration file?\nAt the top of this documentation page, there is information about configuration files:\n\nThe following configuration files are consulted by LXC. For privileged\n  use, they are found under /etc/lxc, while for unprivileged use they\n  are under ~/.config/lxc.\nlxc.conf may optionally specify alternate values for several lxc\n  settings, including the lxcpath, the default configuration, cgroups to\n  use, a cgroup creation pattern, and storage backend settings for lvm\n  and zfs.\ndefault.conf specifies configuration which every newly created\n  container should contain. This usually contains at least a network\n  section, and, for unprivileged users, an id mapping section\nlxc-usernet.conf specifies how unprivileged users may connect their\n  containers to the host-owned network.\nlxc.conf and default.conf are both under /etc/lxc and\n  $HOME/.config/lxc, while lxc-usernet.conf is only host-wide.\nBy default, containers are located under /var/lib/lxc for the root\n  user, and $HOME/.local/share/lxc otherwise. The location can be\n  specified for all lxc commands using the \"-P|--lxcpath\" argument.\n\nIf I read it correctly, it does not indicate where the container config file is.\nThe configuration I would like to add for cont1 is \nlxc.network.type = veth\nlxc.network.flags = up\nlxc.network.link = br1\nlxc.network.name = eth0\nlxc.network.ipv4 = 10.10.11.0/24\nlxc.network.ipv4.gateway = 10.10.11.11\n\nand I tried to put it in the files /etc/lxc/cont1/config and /var/lib/lxc/cont1/config but none was taken into account: the container does not start, failing to bring up the networking. It works fine with the default config using lxcbr0. \n\nA: A bit late, but in case someone else is - like I was - searching for an answer to this \"obvious\" question:\nThe config file for a privileged container seems to be in /var/lib/lxc/${containerName}/config.\n\nA: Place configuration file for LXC container in any place and then specify this file when creating a container with -f option:\nlxc-create {-n name} [-f config_file] {-t template} [-B backingstore] [-- template-options]  \n\nfor example:\nsudo lxc-create -t download -f /any/path/u1.container.conf -n u1 -- -d ubuntu -r xenial -a amd64\n\n", "Q: Nvidia settings get reset every time I open NVIDIA X Server I'm on Kubuntu 15.10 with the Nvidia Proprietary driver.

Why? Just switched 4GBs to 16GBs of RAM. However, when I look at how much memory I have, it says 15.3. I'm just wondering why did my memory drop down when I just installed 16 GBs of RAM.\n \n\nA: Short Answer\nIt's probably just the kernel using memory. Instead of reporting kernel memory usage, Ubuntu instead subtracts form the total available. This is simply to let you know that the kernel memory cannot be freed in most cases. That memory is being used for things that are absolutely necessary, and so it will never be available.\nDiagnostic Commands\nI don't expect you to run all of these, but I've included them here for reference and completeness. Most relevant are commands 3 and 4. Also please note that all sizes are going to be in base 2 (e.g. GiB) and not in base 10 (e.g. GB) despite what the unit abbreviations might be.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can check how big your RAM sticks are claiming to be with:\nsudo dmidecode | grep Size | grep MB\n\n\n*You can check how much RAM is available for general use with (look for Mem and total):\nfree -h\n\n\n*You can estimate how much memory the kernel is using with:\ncat /proc/meminfo | grep Slab\n\n\n*You can check for \"stolen\" graphics card memory with:\ndmesg | grep stolen\n\n\n*You can look for specific hardware reserved memory by looking through:\ndmesg | grep e820\n\n\n*You can test to make certain all of your memory works by running memtest\nExplanation\nThe most likely explanation is simply that the extra space is being used by either your graphics card or the kernel itself. If you're not familiar, the kernel is the lowest-level part of the operating system, and any memory that it's using will not be available to you and so is not reported as free. The memory might be used for any number of reasons, such as the virtual memory tables, memory-mapped I/O, kernel processes, certain caches, shared graphics memory, etc.\nExample: Looking at My Laptop\nIt is very likely that adding the output of command 3 to your 15.3GiB will result in almost exactly 16GiB. This was the case in my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed RAM: 6GiB\n\n*Reported in System Settings > Details: 5.6GiB\n\n*Output of cat /proc/meminfo | grep Slab: 316652 kB\n\n*Converted to GiB: 316652/2^20 = 0.3GiB\n\n*Output of dmesg | grep stolen: 32768K\n\n*Converted to GiB: 32768/2^20 = 0.03GiB\n\n*Adding them together: 5.6 + 0.3 + 0.03 = 5.93GiB\nSince the Slab memory is not comprehensive, we can assume that the kernel is using the remaining 0.07GiB in places we can't see, and so this is a very satisfying result.\nSee Also\n\n\n*\n\n*How much RAM does the kernel use? (Unix & Linux)\n\n*Reducing reserved RAM (Arch forums)\n\n*Why is some RAM marked as hardware reserved in Windows 7? (Superuser)\n\n*Why does my system show 3.2GiB of RAM?

I installed the defacto google-chrome-stable application, and now if I have it open chromedriver fails to instantiate an instance and the automation hangs.\nIf I close google-chrome-stable and open chromium (as I am doing now to ask this question), I can run test automation however unity shows chromedriver with the google-chrome-stable icon in the launcher. I suspect that this is a symptom of what is happening, but I can't imagine what.\nHow do fix this so I can run them side-by-side, as I used to do with chromium?\n\nA: After reading through and doing some research, I realized that I had a very important misunderstanding of how chromedriver worked. From their README.txt:\n\nChromeDriver will use the system installed Chrome by default.\n... [section omitted for brevity/relevance] ...\n=====Architecture=====\nChromeDriver is shipped separately from Chrome. It controls Chrome out of process through DevTools. ChromeDriver is a\n  standalone server which communicates with the WebDriver client via the\n  WebDriver wire protocol, which is essentially synchronous JSON\n  commands over HTTP. WebDriver clients are available in many languages,\n  and many are available from the open source selenium/webdriver\n  project: http://code.google.com/p/selenium. ChromeDriver uses the\n  webserver from net/server.\n\nThis fundamental part of how it works is why google-chrome-stable started causing issues with it. It also means that even though I thought I was using chromium side-by-side with chromedriver, I was probably mistakenly sharing the same chromium instance at the same time.\n", "Q: Permanent permissions change to /dev/vhost-net I'm interested in making sure that /dev/vhost-net is read/writable by group vhost-net.

(e.g. re-encode)\nI'd appreciate any qualified comment on this issue.\nCheers\n\nA: First off let me say that there are going to be varying opinions on what is better as for quality,  and this type of question isn't usually best suited for this type of forum, however I will try my best to tell you what has worked for me.\nFirst answer: - 720 x 576 is actually a 5:4 ratio, so unless your source material is this ratio it will look a bit distorted. Essentially what you want to do is maintain the ratio of the original source material. You may wish to look into using anamorphic encoding. There is a good guide on the Hanbrake site HERE.\nSecond answer - This is a VERY loaded question with a plethora of possible answers. You may wish to visit the Handbrake forums to look at ways to maintain visual & audio fidelity.  \nOne recommendation I would make would be to lose the MP3 audio. This format is simply not used in modern encodes, as it seems to be lossy compared to other formats.\nAnother thing to take note of in regards to quality of DVD rips is that many older DVDs were made with interlaced frames  which seems fine when viewed on CRT televisions, however when viewed on a more modern television set the picture will often look like it has jagged edges, especially when there is lots of movement. To avoid this interlacing of frames there is a feature called deinterlacing in Handbrake. You can check the handbrake site on interlacing HERE\nThird answer - As for making smaller file sizes, if you navigate to the video tab in Handbrake and set the preset value to slow or very slow, you will get smaller file sizes and better quality, however this will come at the cost of the encode taking much more time to complete. \n", "Q: can i install 64bit ubuntu os in my laptop which runs on 32bit windows 7 home premium I have a laptop with the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 home premium 32-bit\n\n*Pentium Dual-core CPU T4300 @ 2.10GHz\n\n*4GB RAM\n\n\nCan I install Ubuntu-14.04.3 64bit?\n\nA: Running a 64 bit version of any operating system is primarily dependent on the processor the computer is using and whether it supports the 64 bit instruction set. If we look on Intel Ark (Source) for the model of CPU in the laptop it shows that it has support for Intel 64 which states that:\n\nIntel® 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server,\n  workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with\n  supporting software.¹ Intel 64 architecture improves performance by\n  allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and\n  physical memory.\n\nThis means that the CPU can handle 64 bit software such as operating systems and supporting applications.\n\nA: Yes you can.\nthere are two ways you can install 64Bit Ubuntu in your laptop machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*WMWARE:\nInstall vmware in your windows OS, you can use other virtual machine software too, like Oracle Virtual Box, Microsoft VM the best is VMWARE.\nafter installation you can either install Ubuntu from ISO or can download already installed Ubunut Vmware files and just use it.\n\n\n*Native Ubuntu:\nBetter to install Ubuntu OS along side windows OS on another physical partition rather than Virtual Machine.\nBoot from Ubuntu ISO USB/CD/DVD and choose \"Something Else\" on installation screen. then select or create new partition for Ubuntu. and let the installation begins.\n", "Q: php5 and phpmyadmin not installing I have installed mysql, mysql-server, apache2 and many more.

What I don't understand is the third option (none).\n/home/users    /export/users   none    bind  0  0\n\nAccording to the man page of fstab, it says the field options are like below, where the third field \"describes the type of the filesystem\". But in the NFS article it says to have \"none\" as the filesystem. How can you just not have a filesystem and then put files on it?\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n\n\nA: One uses the \"file system type\" none for bind and move mounts.\nThat means, whenever we are not mounting a new file system but simply \"move\" or \"copy\" an already mounted file system mount point.\nA bind mount just adds another location (mount point) through which we can access an already existing place from our file system. This can be an already mounted partition/device or any directory inside one. The move mount is similar but replaces one mount point with another instead of just adding a new one.\nAnd as such \"bind mounts\" and \"move mounts\" do not need to take care of the underlying file systems because they are already mounted, we specify none as file system type in /etc/fstab.\n", "Q: How can I get past login and password request?

Why not other pages?\n\nA: As suggested by Zacharee in the comment above the chrome extension 'Force custom fonts' does the job of changing the font on every webpage as you like and works better than the inbuilt chrome customization font setting.\n", "Q: What's the best way to transform a string into an associative array For the sake of exercise, I've written the few lines below in a bash script to transform a HTTP post input into an associative array. Following through on my learning, I was wondering, if there are different, maybe more elegant, ways to do this. I mean, I know there are different ways. I'm wondering which ones exist and what the advantages and disadvantages of each methods are.\nNote: I'm using post as input here. The exercise however is to build a array from a multiple name/value pair string. The input could be coming from any files or other input source.\nNote2: the string I'm dealing with could look like this: name=myName&age=myAge. So there are 2 delimiters. One separating name/value pairs (&) and the other separating the value from its name (=).\n#!/bin/bash\nread post;\ndeclare -A myArr;\nIFS_bck=$IFS;\nIFS=\"=\";\nwhile read name value; do\n  myArr[$name]=$value;\ndone < <(sed -rn -e 's/&/\\n/g p' <<<\"$post\");\nIFS=$IFS_bck;\n\nP.S. I'm not willing to start a religious war. I'm simply wondering how you would do this and why you would chose your proposal over mine.\n\nA: What you have doesn't look bad, but neither Bash nor sed play too well with splitting on multiple delimiters; personally I'd use AWK and simplify the script a bit (using AWK changing IFS becomes redundant; notice that you don't need semicolons at the end of statements in Bash):\n#!/bin/bash\nread post\ndeclare -A myArr\nwhile read name value; do\n    myArr[$name]=$value\ndone < <(<<<\"$post\" awk -F= '{print $1,$2}' RS='&|\\n')\n\nThe AWK command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reads $post;\n\n*Splits records on sequences of amperstands / newlines (splitting on newlines is a trick to prevent the while loop from failing on the final empty record);\n\n*Splits fields on sequences of equal signs;\n\n*Prints the fields separated by the default separator, a space.\n\n\n% cat script.sh \n#!/bin/bash\nread post\ndeclare -A myArr\nwhile read name value; do\n    myArr[$name]=$value\ndone < <(<<<\"$post\" awk -F= '{print $1,$2}' RS='&|\\n')\nprintf '%s %s\\n' \"${myArr[name]}\" \"${myArr[age]}\"\n% bash script.sh \nname=myName&age=myAge\nmyName myAge\n% \n\n\nA: I would do this just using bash itself:\n#!/bin/bash\nread -e -p 'Enter the string: ' post\ndeclare -A myArr\n\nwhile IFS='&' read name age; do\n    myArr[\"${name##*=}\"]=\"${age##*=}\"\ndone <<<\"$post\"\n\nprintf 'NAME: %s, AGE: %s\\n' \"${!myArr[@]}\" \"${myArr[@]}\"\n\nHere is what i get in the output:\nEnter the string: name=Foo Bar&age=40\nNAME: Foo Bar, AGE: 40\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The input string is spitted on & using IFS environmental variable\n\n*The name and age values are parsed using parameter expansion pattern ${var##*=}\n\n*You can get all keys using ${!myArr[@]} and all values using ${!myArr[@]}\nIn practice, I don't think you would just make an associative array of one element. If you have multiple elements, replace the last printf line with a simple for construct to loop over the keys:\nfor key in \"${!myArr[@]}\"; do\n    printf 'NAME: %s, AGE: %s\\n' \"$key\" \"${myArr[\"$key\"]}\"\ndone\n\n\nA: Yet another way, using just IFS:\n#!/bin/bash\ndeclare -A myArr\nIFS='&=' read -a post\nfor ((i = 0; i < ${#post[@]}; i += 2))\ndo\n    myArr[${post[i]}]=${post[i + 1]}\ndone\nfor key in \"${!myArr[@]}\"\ndo\n    printf \"%s: %s\\n\" \"$key\" \"${myArr[$key]}\"\ndone\n\nread splits the incoming line into words on all characters in IFS, so you can use both & and = in IFS to split on both. Given that the POST input always has a value for a key, this will work.\nHowever, this method can't check if there's a strict alternation between & and =. So, for example, age&myAge=name=myName will be parsed so that age=myAge and name=myName.\n\nA note about IFS\nYou have backed up IFS and restored it. But you only need IFS for read, so apply IFS only for READ:\nIFS='...' read ... # or\nwhile IFS='...' read ...; ...\n\nRestoring IFS is tricky, since an unset IFS and an empty IFS affect the shell differently, but are the same when you take the value of IFS itself. That is:\nIFS=\nIFS_BAK=\"$IFS\"\n\nwill give the same value for IFS_BAK as:\nunset IFS\nIFS_BAK=\"$IFS\"\n\nAn empty IFS is exactly that: an empty string. However, an unset IFS causes the shell to behave as if the default IFS (space, tab, newline) was used:\n$ foo='a  b  c'\n$ printf \"|%s|\\n\" $foo\n|a|\n|b|\n|c|\n$ IFS=; printf \"|%s|\\n\" $foo\n|a  b  c|\n$ unset IFS; printf \"|%s|\\n\" $foo\n|a|\n|b|\n|c|\n\nSo, if you'd found yourself with an unset IFS, and then tried the old backup-and-restore-IFS trick, you might get surprising results. It's better to restrict changes to IFS to be only for those commands that need it.\n\nA: You have said:\n\nSo there are 2 delimiters. One separating name/value pairs (&) and the other separating the value form its name (=).\n\nWell, we can split name/value pairs using & as IFS into variables, and use suffix/prefix removal to free the actual name and age values. \n$> cat post-parse.sh                                                           \n#!/bin/bash\nIFS='&' read PAIR1 PAIR2\n# if necessary use these as well\n# name_key=${PAIR1%%=*}\n# age_key=${PAIR2%%=*}\nname_val=${PAIR1##*=}\nage_val=${PAIR2##*=}\necho $name_val $age_val\n$> ./post-parse.sh\nname=Serg&age=25\nSerg 25\n$> \n\nYou've also said: \n\nThe exercise however is to build a array from a multiple name/value pair string. The input could be coming from any files or other input source.\n\nIf we want to store multiple key-value pairs, we can read input line by line (so no need to use sed to get rid of \\n there), and apply same concept I showed above:\n#!/bin/bash\ndeclare -A myArray\nwhile read input_line ; # read input line by line\ndo\necho $input_line\n  IFS='&' read PAIR1 PAIR2 <<< $input_line # split in two with &\n  # name_key=${PAIR1%%=*}\n  # age_key=${PAIR2%%=*}\n  name_val=${PAIR1##*=}\n  age_val=${PAIR2##*=}\n  myArray[$name_val]=$age_val\ndone\n# print out the array\nfor key in \"${!myArray[@]}\" \ndo\n   echo ${myArray[$key]} is $key\ndone\n\nSample run bellow uses here document but it could be anything, even a pipe. Point is, read command doesn't care where it gets input. \n$> ./post-parse.sh << EOF                                                      \n> name=John&age=25                                                             \n> name=Jane&age=35                                                             \n> EOF\nname=John&age=25\nname=Jane&age=35\n25 is John\n35 is Jane\n\n", "Q: Using Wine for Windows printer driver on Linux We have some old printers with Windows drivers only at my work space. Is there any general way to use their drivers through Wine?\nI have not found any decent and new documentation about the problem.\nEdit:\nWe have Sharp AR-5516, and according to http://www.openprinting.org/printers there are not any Linux drivers.\n\nA: No, you can't use printer drivers designed for Windows on Linux. Wine doesn't help either because it doesn't emulate the hardware interfaces on which device drivers rely. (Wine aims to emulate the programming interfaces used by Windows applications only.)\nIf you want to print from an application executed through Wine, the latter still requires a working Linux printer driver since all Wine does is to translate the application’s printing instructions to equivalent instructions understood by Linux’ printing subsystem (which is almost always CUPS these days).\n", "Q: Dual Booting on Dell 1545 with W7 & Ubuntu 15.04 I have been successfully dual booting the system with both W10 & W7.

I have a failing hdd, all I need from there is my music and movies folder, I have managed to copy all the other files from the failing hdd. But when I try to copy the above 2 folders, I get read write/input out put errors. These 2 folders are my life's collection and I really do not want to loose them. I read that the dd command copies files over as raw data, so i think that that might work in getting them backed up to my external drive. Is there a way for me to use the dd commend to just copy those to folders over to my external?. I cannot use dd to clone complete hdd, because the failing drive is 1 TB and my external only 300GB. The 2 folders together only comes to 224GB.\n\nA: You can use dd (or better ddrescue which tries to read data several times before it fails) only on files or similar file-like objects. On UNIX systems, a file-like object can be for example a partition (e.g. /dev/sda1), an entire disk (e.g. /dev/sda), a virtual character device (e.g. /dev/zero or /dev/random) or the input/output streams (e.g. STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR).\nDirectories are also represented by file descriptors in your file system tree, but are not counted as file-like objects in the case of dd because they can't be read as single object.\nSo using dd (or ddrescue) only works either on single real files that have to be located on a mounted and working file system, or on an entire disk or partition which it would then copy rawly no matter what file system it is formatted with and whether it is mounted and working or not.\nTo conclude: No, you can't dd a folder. \n", "Q: How to install intel hd graphics 3000 and nvidia geforce 610m My laptop is Asus A45v with core i3, nvidia geforce 610m, 6bg ram\nHow to install in Ubuntu : intel chipset and nvidia graphics?\nThanks if you answer.\n\nA: Intel drivers already are installed - install the NVIDIA drivers and Optimus.\nOpen a terminal and execute:  \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352 nvidia-prime\nsudo reboot  \n\nUse NVIDIA X Server Settings to switch between Intel and NVIDIA graphics.\n", "Q: How to create new user with Public key authentication?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nSomeone said that its shown. He also sent that image that is attached.\n\n\nA: Most computers come with one physical hard drive installed in them. If the computer comes with a pre-installed version of Windows, there will be multiple \"drives\" seen in Explorer, under Computer or This PC, such as Windows (C:), Recovery (D:) and Data (E:). A disc drive might show up as F:.\nThe \"drives\" you see here, however, are not actually each individual hard drives. They are called partitions. Partitions are sections of your hard drive and are essentially mini or virtual hard drives. Windows calls these partitions \"Disks\" or \"Drives\" so as to not confuse people.\nUbuntu works a little differently than Windows in this regard. Instead of pretending that each partition is its own physical hard drive, Ubuntu recognizes that they are partitions, and names them as such. When Ubuntu refers to a \"Drive\" or \"Disk\" (not disc), it is referring to the physical storage medium (the hard drive).\nPartition/Drive labeling on Ubuntu is also different from Windows. Physical devices get a letter, but in a different way. For example, C:, D: and E: become sda1, sda2 and sda3. The number refers to the partition number; 1 is the first partition on the drive, 2 is the second, 3 is the third, and so on. If there is more than one drive in the computer, you may see partitions listed as something like:\n/dev/sda1\n/dev/sda2\n/dev/sda3\n/dev/sdb1\n/dev/sdb2\n\nThe letter to the left of the number refers to the physical hard drive. sda is the first hard drive in the hardware order and sdb is the second. It doesn't matter which you plug in first. If your plug a drive into the secondary port on your motherboard, it will be labelled sdb.\nWhen you chose to \"wipe disk and install Ubuntu,\" Ubuntu didn't automatically read your mind and know which partition to erase, it erased the whole hard drive and installed Ubuntu in a new partition that takes up the whole hard drive space, except for a tiny other partition for boot files. \nYour file manager doesn't show C:, D:, E: and F: for two reasons. One, Ubuntu doesn't label devices like that. Two, you erased your whole partition, essentially destroying all information on it, before you installed Ubuntu.\nMaybe you're thinking that it's stupid for Ubuntu to label stuff so differently from Windows, but Windows is actually the cause for confusion here. Pretty much every other OS, including Mac, lists hard drives in terms of physical devices and partitions, not the unifying and confusing way Microsoft decided on.\nFurther reading on partitions: http://www.howtogeek.com/184659/beginner-geek-hard-disk-partitions-explained/\n", "Q: BQ Aquaris Ubuntu Phone sync with thunderbird on computer? How (with which app)  can I synchronize contacts between Ubuntu phone (BQ Aquaris) and Thunderbird on my computer?\n\nA: You cannot directly sync contacts with an Ubuntu phone at the moment.

There's currently no other supported way of syncing contacts between the phone and a PC.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Re-Installation problem I wanted to remove Ubuntu from my pc (which I had dual booted), and reinstall it.\nTo do this, I went to the disk management in Windows, formatted the space for Ubuntu, and reallocated the partition for Windows to use. \nSo when I again thought of dual booting with Ubuntu, using the advanced start up option in windows, my USB was not detected.

One of the first customizations that any new user to any operating system likes to do has to be setting his or her own wallpaper! Yes, this can be done in Ubuntu too. As long as the user keeps to the few wallpapers that come built in with Ubuntu, it should not be a problem. So the user has to play in the sandbox to avoid unnecessary headaches. For as soon as the user starts selecting his or her own pictures or one of the freely available wallpapers from the Web, things start to get complicated.\nProblem #1:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*User stores a JPEG picture file named bird.jpg in\n/home/user/Desktop.\n\n*User right clicks on the file icon and selects \"set as wallpaper\".\n\n*The file is copied from /home/user/Desktop to\n/home/user/Pictures/Wallpapers, and the file is set as the desktop\nwallpaper.\n\n\nWhy does the file need to be copied? For safety? In case the original file is moved or deleted?\nProblem #2:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*User opens /home/user/Pictures/Wallpapers.\n\n*User right clicks on the file icon for bird.jpg and selects \"set as\nwallpaper\".\n\n*The file is duplicated as bird (copy).jpg in the current folder, and\nthe file is set as the desktop wallpaper.\n\n*User right clicks on bird.jpg again and selects \"set as wallpaper\"\nagain.\n\n*The file is duplicated as bird (another copy).jpg in the current\nfolder, and the file is set as desktop wallpaper.\n\n\nWhy is it necessary to create dupes in order to set a certain file as the wallpaper?\nProblem #3:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*User opens /home/user/Pictures/Wallpapers and deletes all the\nfiles in it.\n\n*User opens Appearance dialog box.\n\n*User clicks on the plus button to add a picture to the \"Wallpapers\"\nlist.\n\n*User navigates to /home/user/Desktop, selects bird.jpg\nand clicks on Open button.\n\n*The picture is added, but not to the \"Wallpapers\" list. It is added\nto the \"Pictures Folder\" list.\n\n*User navigates to /home/user/Pictures/ and finds an empty folder\n(except for one sub-folder).\n\n*User navigates to /home/user/Pictures/Wallpapers and finds an\nempty folder.\n\n\nWhy is the picture file added to \"Pictures Folder\" list and not the \"Wallpapers\" list?\nIf the file is added to \"Pictures Folder\" list, why is the /home/user/Pictures folder empty? If \"Pictures Folder\" represents a folder name, what is its search path?\nProblem #4:\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*User does the steps 2 to 4 from previous problem description.\n\n*User closes the Appearance dialog box.\n\n*User opens the Appearance dialog box.\n\n*The \"Pictures Folder\" list has now magically turned up empty.\n\n\nWhat I would like to do is designate one specific folder in which I will keep all the pictures I want to be able to select from and use as my desktop wallpaper.\nThe reason I constrain myself to one folder is because of the problems I described above. I am willing to do it this way in order to avoid dupes, because I usually change the wallpaper by finding the file I want to use. I don't go hunting for the right settings dialog box first and then the file. (I guess I am doing it wrong from the perspective of Ubuntu evangelists.) I then use the mouse click context menu to do exactly what I want, and Ubuntu does have this option, but it's poorly implemented.\nSo I am willing to work around this shortcoming and use the Appearance dialog box (the \"right\" way), and a specific folder from which I can select wallpapers using the dialog box. But even for this to work, I need to get rid of the problem number 4 where Appearance dialog box doesn't want to display the files or locations I picked out earlier for it to show me as a list.\nHow do you guys deal with this? Just stick to the default wallpapers???...\n\nA: There are different forces at play. The canonical way to alter wallpapers is using org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri schema and key. The important part is that the picture has to be a local file. \nIn case of problem #4, the schema is being altered directly; note that all available options in the appearance settings  are from local folders.\nin case of other problems you've specified, it's being done through nautilus, and nautilus has possibility of accessing network-shared drives, which means user may attempt setting background image from there. Well, remember what i said - the image must be local ? That's the reason why nautilus will copy the file.\nThe exact code for that is set in nautilus-view.c file\nstatic void\naction_set_as_wallpaper_callback (GtkAction    *action,\n                                  NautilusView *view)\n{\n        GList *selection;\n\n        /* Copy the item to Pictures/Wallpaper since it may be\n           remote.

Instead it's a proposed release. Proposed releases are made available for early testing and validation by users and shouldn't be used to upgrade production environments without the understanding that this may break your deployment.\nAs for your question, there are two different versions of Juju. There is the Juju client installed on your machine and the Juju version deployed in an environment. juju version will print your client version, but each environment created will have it's own version. For example you may have a staging environment and production environment. Upgrading juju for those environments is two independent actions and is what juju upgrade-juju command is designed to do.\nSo, if you want to test Juju 1.25.4 before it's release you'll need to do a few things. First, you'll need to update your environment to use the proposed stream. Juju uses streams (stable, proposed, devel) to advertise versions of Juju agents available. You created the environment with the stable stream and since 1.25.4 isn't released yet it's not in stable. If you stop now and wait for it to be released, when 1.25.4 goes to stable, juju upgrade-juju will work as expected. You do not have to upgrade the Juju client to upgrade an environment.\nUpgrading Juju Environment\nTo continue, run juju set-environment agent-stream=proposed. You may get a warning about the key not existing, this is OK. Once that's run, you should be able to issue juju upgrade-juju to get 1.25.4 - after the upgrade I recommend moving agent-stream back to released or simply running juju unset-environment agent-stream to revert back to default.\nUpgrading Juju Client\nTo upgrade the Juju client, simply add ppa:juju/proposed and do an apt update/upgrade\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:juju/proposed\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install juju juju-core\n\n", "Q: Why Recurrent Grub Rescue Mode? I am using the product 5.25\" Tray-Less SATA Hot-Swap Hard for 3.5\"HDD Hard Disk off / on Button found here at the front of my Asus PC (2013 model) with Ubuntu 14.04.\nI set successfully bios that you can boot from the hot-swap system. \nHowever, I started to receive recurrent grub rescue errors after two month of use. I can fix the problem for one startup by pieces of instructions in the thread Grub rescue problem after deleting Ubuntu partition but it occurs after every shut down. Error at every startup\nerror: no such device: 48d470cc-7ad3-46e9-9646-622e16319f71\nEntering rescue mode...\n\nwhere I do the following which solves the thing only for one startup, after which the error comes again\ngrub rescue> ls\n(hd0) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos1)\ngrub rescue> ls (hd0,msdos5)\n(hd0,msdos5): Filesystem is unknown. \ngrub rescue> ls (hd0,msdos1)\n(hd0,msdos1): Filesystem is ext2. \ngrub rescue> ls (hd0)\n(hd0>: Filesystem is unknown. \ngrub rescue> set root=(hd0,msdos1)\ngrub rescue> set prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub\ngrub rescue> insmod normal\ngrub rescue> normal\n\nThe state of the OS may affect the recurrent grub rescue mode. \nI am receiving now many (2-3) internal errors from the system when keeping the system alive. I have received them few also before. \nI sent each time a report about the issue to developers with logs. \nHowever, no proceeding has happened with it. \n\nHow can you understand recurrent grub rescue mode in Ubuntu 14.04? \n\nA: These instructions are for regular BIOS machines and are not for newer EFI machines.\nDid you already run sudo update-grub after booting up Ubuntu? Running this command should update everything. \nIf not, you may need to reinstall grub to the MBR. Run the following command to do so:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nThen, run sudo update-grub again for good measure.\nAlso, make sure grub is installing to the correct MBR on the correct disk. You can install grub to any MBR on any disk (even a USB drive) by altering the command above so keep that in mind.\nPlease post any errors.\n", "Q: Wifi not working in Ubuntu in Acer aspire e5 I am trying to establish a wireless connection but it's not connecting.

I think I have a pretty good Idea how my TB drives will be laid out in a zpool using ZFS.  I also have a 120GB SSD. My intent was to install the program on the SSD.  \nIs that outside the pool?  \nIs that a different format (eg EXT4)?  \nShould I consider using the SSD elsewhere (e.g. some sort of cache)?\n\nA: You have three solutions depending on the use case.\n\n\n*\n\n*If your disks are going to store a lot of data not accessed often and which do not need special read or write speed. And if you have a need for programs which will fit on the ssd, you can use your ssd separately to your zpool and format it simply as ext4.\n\n*If you need high read performance on your ZFS pool, you should use at least part of the ssd as l2arc cache. The ZFS filesystem caches data in ram first (arc cache), and can use a ssd to store a level 2 (l2 arc) cache. It will contain the files uses most frequently.\n\n*If instead you need fast write performance on your zfs pool, you can use your ssd as SLOG, which will cache the write requests before they are sequentially written to the spinning disks. However, it is a good practice to use a mirror of ssd to store the slog, as losing the ssd may corrupt recently written data.\n\n\nIn the first and third cases, beware of the reliability issues linked to the potential failure of the ssd.\n", "Q: Showing file sizes in sorted order How to show a list of files from some directory root sorted in file size descending order from command line? \n\nA: From your folder:  \nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort --human-numeric-sort --reverse\n\nYou can set how deep it can look for files with -maxdepth parameter or without it to be recursive.\n\nA: If you want to list everything in the directory recursively, use either find or du with sort:\nfind /some/path -type f -printf '%s %p\\n' | sort -rn\ndu -h /some/path | sort -rh\n\nThe former will show only files, and size in bytes. The latter will show both file and cumulative directory sizes, in human-readable (using KB, MB, etc.) format. sort accordingly uses numeric for the former (-n) and human-readable for the latter (-h).\n\nWith more complexity, the best option would be:\nfind /some/path -type f -print0 | du --files0-from=- -0h | sort -rzh | tr '\\0' '\\n'\n\ndu can read a NUL-delimited list of files from input, and find can print NUL-delimited filenames using -print0. sort can then take the NUL-delimited list of sizes and filenames and sort them, and finally you replace NULs with newlines for convenient display.\nSince filenames and paths can contain anything except the ASCII NUL character, using NUL-delimited lines will processing them is the safest way.\nYou can also get find to print the size as seen in the first command, but with -printf '%s %p\\0' to still use NUL-delimited lines, and skip using du as the middle man.\n\nA: As @Terrance said, ls -lS sorts files in descending order.

Visiting the forum pages and attempting the suggested solutions have led me to a computer that no longer recognizes Ubuntu on my external hard drive or the windows 10 OS on the laptop HD apparently.\nSteps that have led down the dark and lonely path:\n\n\n*\n\n*I created a bootable USB with Universal USB installer using Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS iso.\n\n*I then booted from the USB and chose the option to \"try ubuntu without installing\".\n\n*I then plugged in my external hard drive (lets call it EHD) and double clicked on the desktop icon to install Ubuntu.\n\n*I chose my language and clicked \"continue\".\n\n*I was connected to the internet, power source, and I had enough drive space.\n\n*I chose to download updates while installing and install 3rd party software.\n\n*I then chose installation type => \"Something Else\".\n\n*I then chose /dev/sdc My Passport(1TB) for the device for boot loader installation.\n\n*Under /dev/sdc/ I created three partitions from \"free space\":\n\n\n*\n\n*1st: 50GB, Primary, Beginning of this space, Ext4, \"/\"\n\n*2nd: 15GB, Logical, Beginning of this space, swap area\n\n*3rd: 500GB, Logical, Beginning of this space, Ext4, \"/home\"\n\n\n*I then pushed install now and then shutdown the system and removed the USB when the installation was finished.\n\n*Now, with the EHD plugged in, the purple screen appears giving me options to boot windows or ubuntu and both options work great.\n\n*I shutdown, removed EHD usb (thinking I won!), and start up the laptop. It goes to the black GNU GRUB v2blahblahblah screen with the grub> command terminal. Hmm, first I tried changing boot order with Grub Customizer, that didn't work. Forums then lead me to believe that the bootloader was installed on the laptops hard drive (though I don't think I did - see Step 8). So I tried to follow this Dual-boot computer won't boot without external hard drive.\n\n*So I got Rescatux on a bootable USB to attempt to repair the windows MBR, and ran the program choosing the first sda partion options (it appeared \"common sensical\"). But now regardless of if the EHD is plugged in or not I get a friendly message saying \"Boot Device Not Found\".\n\n*I soldiered on though, hoping that I could at least get the EHD working. So I booted from the live USB and ran boot-repair. It seemed to function normally giving me the warning of requiring internet access. I had access so I said yes and it performed its stuff (i think it said Updating) but then after a few minutes the process started over warning of internet access again. It did that a couple more times after which I said heck with it and quit boot-repair.\n\n*I then shutdown, removed the live USB and booted the system with and without the EHD plugged in. Regardless it goes to the black HP Boot Error screen (though it will still recognize the live USB and let me boot from that).\n\n*That brings me to where I am now. I have a laptop and EHD that won't boot Windows or Ubuntu. I would greatly appreciate your help in the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fix my laptop so it boots to Windows 10 OS like it should. I don't want dual boot. Just 'ol windows.\n\n*Fix my EHD so when I plug it into my laptop, desktop, etc. I can boot to Ubuntu.\n\n\n\nMuch obliged for all your help in advance.\nUPDATE #1:\nThe link to the boot-repair info is http://paste.ubuntu.com/15338181. If you could interpret the results and proper solution I would appreciate it. Unsurprisingly there does appear to be some shenanigans going on.\nThe sda is my laptop hard drive (laptop came with windows 8.1 and then I moved to windows 10 when it was released), sdb is the live USB, sdc is the EHD. \nUPDATE #2:\nI tried to do a clean install with windows 10 and it wouldn't work. So I tried with windows 8.1 (since that is what came with the computer originally) by deleting each partition except one that had an OEM description (deleting that seemed a bit scary if I did't have to). It seemed to work but on restart after everything was done I once again got the boot error screen no OS found. This is the new boot-repair info http://paste.ubuntu.com/15340916 (the EHD is not attached so it doesn't showup this time). I looked at the hard drive in gparted and the partition sda3 says unknows (it was like this before the clean install as well). Suggestions on how to proceed?\n\nA: I did find a solution to my problem but unfortunately not the elegant one I had hoped. Perhaps it would have been possible near the beginning but things went down hill after trying Rescatux... shame on you Rescatux! :) jk, jk\nAnyways, the final solution after Update #2 above was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*I recorded what I believe is my windows key using the Ubuntu live USB terminal and entering the line below just in case things went south(...er):\n\n\nsudo xxd /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MSDM\n\n\n*I then did a clean install again within Windows 8.1 but this time I also deleted the OEM marked partition as well (I didn't delete that one before). Everything worked fine then and I was able to complete the install, upgrade to Windows 10, and reinstall the necessary drivers. For whatever reason not having deleted that OEM marked partition was preventing the clean install from functioning correctly.\n\n\nAlthough this worked, it was kind of the sledgehammer approach by turning the initial Ubuntu problem into a pure Windows problem. Hopefully when I try to make the external Ubuntu hard drive again I won't climb down this rabbit hole again.\nUPDATE #1:\nStill needing an EHD I repeated steps 1-11 and part of 12 (up to and including unplugging the EHD and getting the black gnu grub screen). For whatever reason, Ubuntu puts boot files onto my internal hard drive see boot-info before and after ubuntu install. So to get to Windows without the EHD attached type \"exit\" in the grub terminal and Windows will boot... Now to get rid of that pesky GNU GRUB screen and make  sure the EHD behaves properly.\n\nA: First of all, disable secure boot in the BIOS. If you want to repair your laptop to atleast boot into Windows 10, put in a Windows 10 install USB, select your language, select to Repair the computer, and then go to Command Prompt. Once in command prompt, run these commands bootrec.eexternalxe/FixMbr, bootrec.exe/FixBoot and bootrec.exe/RebuildBCD These commands should repair the bootloader for Windows only booting.  Regarding your Ubuntu installation on EHD, I don't know why its not working. I have proceeded in the exact same manner in the past and it always worked for me. I suspect it is because you did not disable Secure Boot or because the tool you used did something. But, I am not sure. I suggest checking from the live USB that you did not damage/change any of the partitions of the laptop using GParted. Confirm if /dev/sdc is your EHD and /dev/sda is your internal hard drive. If all okay, then I would recommend installing Ubuntu again on the EHD using the exact same procedure as you did (install bootloader in /dev/sdc and install Ubuntu in /dev/sdc). \n", "Q: Boot Loader (GRUB) disappears from BIOS Boot Sequence - Dual Boot Win 10 Trying to install Ubuntu alongside Win 10 (UEFI), and the GRUB2 I installed on a separate drive (using this Wiki: Grub2/Installing) disappeared after the first booting. My plan was to list the drive with GRUB installed, as my primary boot source in Bios Boot Sequence. \nI have two drives, one of which is an SSD used for Windows and system files, and another (2TB) for storage. My Windows boot, however, is sitting on the 2TB drive, which got me trying to load GRUB2 onto the SSD and setting the SSD as the primary boot drive. \nAfter installing Ubuntu, the option did pop-up in the Bios Boot Sequence menu, but when I tried to make the SSD as my #1 Bootable Device, the option was no longer there. I tried to see whether it stayed in the Boot Sequence, and it did not.\nIs this a common scenario for Windows to block / overwrite GRUB and what would be the solution to prevent this? \n\nA: First, please understand that in EFI-mode booting, you don't typically boot from devices (as in boot code in the first sector of a disk) or partitions (as in boot code in the first sector of a partition); instead, EFI-mode booting boots files that are stored on the EFI System Partition (ESP). The EFI boot loader to be used is referenced in NVRAM. I want to make this explicit because your question suggests BIOS-mode thinking that can lead you astray.\nThis brings up a second point: You don't have a BIOS. You have an EFI (or a UEFI, which is just EFI 2.x). BIOS and EFI are two completely different ways to boot a computer. Unfortunately, many people, and even manufacturers, refer to EFIs as \"BIOSes.\" IMHO, this is a mistake, since it leads people to think of EFIs in BIOS terms, which leads to problems. That said, there are some crossover conditions. Most importantly, most modern EFIs include a Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which is a way for EFIs to use old BIOS-mode boot loaders. If the CSM is active, the boot path gets very complex, which can create confusion unless you really understand what you're doing. Nothing in your post makes me think that you're running into CSM complications, though.\nWhat you describe is an entry in the NVRAM-based EFI boot manager that appears and then disappears. This can be caused by any number of things, including (but not limited to):\n\n\n*\n\n*User error -- You might have accidentally (even unknowingly) deleted it with a tool like efibootmgr in Ubuntu or the firmware's own user interface.\n\n*Program bugs -- An OS-level program might have a bug that's caused the deletion.\n\n*EFI bugs -- Many EFIs are buggy and can cause this sort of problem. You didn't say what brand and model computer you have, which may help confirm or deny this hypothesis.\n\n*Disk swapping -- Many experienced multi-booters unplug one disk when installing an OS on another disk. Some EFIs, though, automatically remove NVRAM entries for boot loaders that are inaccessible, so this strategy can result in the symptom you're seeing.\n\n\nIn extreme cases, if your NVRAM-based boot manager entries can't be stabilized, you may need to resort to using the fallback filename of EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi for a boot manager. You can put GRUB there by using Boot Repair, but you must use the Advanced menu to activate the option to do this task. (I don't recall exactly what it's called.)\n\nA: Please make sure that secure boot is completely disabled and Windows hibernation is also switched off.\nThen click on shutdown(restart) and press shift key along with that and follow the onscreen instructions and boot into Ubuntu Linux.\nOnce you login into Linux you need to install boot-repair from a terminal(Ctrl + Alt  + T)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nit should fix your problem.

Here's a picture of that:\n\nThis happened after I tried to open a video file in Ubuntu's default video player Videos which asked me to install additional video codecs or such (which was not successful, by the way). After that, my VLC player seems to have all but disappeared from the system. And now, I can't open files with Videos either. The program asks for additional packages which it is, again, unable to install.\n\n\nA: Maybe you have duplicate repository. I suggest you to do this command\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nThen be sure VLC is fully uninstalled\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get purge vlc\nsudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/vlc\n\nAnd reinstall it\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nI hope it helped.\n", "Q: Create an Ubuntu Install CD with NO network access required I'd like to create an Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS install CD, that will partition a hard drive (I need 4 partitions), and install Ubuntu on 2 of them - a primary and a backup. I want the install to avoid using network connectivity. Haven't been able to find any hints about how to avoid the network conn. Would anyone have some pointers? \n\nA: I don't think that 14.04 LTS install can be bundled in a CD. It's ISO is around 1 GB and most of the CDs cannot go beyond 650-700 MB.\nI had an old desktop(2008) which cannot boot from USB or DVD so i burned an Lubuntu into a CD drive that can fit into a CD. Once i installed that then installed Unity/Gnome via apt-get. Later upgraded to Ubuntu Linux into that old desktop via network(as it was having wifi card that i added later).\nIn your case you can also burn the Ubuntu 12.04 ISO to a CD.\nOther alternative is to use net installer - you can somehow get a wifi card for this machine if needed.\nI know this is not the exact solution to your situation/problem but some work around based on my past experience.\n", "Q: System Monitor with data logging Is there some application that allows system monitoring with value logging ?\nMost of system monitor application usually shows current system usage (CPU/RAM/HDD/NET etc) with (sometimes) small history log (few minutes back in time).\nI looking for application that allows me to check how my system was performing yesterday / week ago / etc.\nSomething like ex. cacti but without need of starting www server for viewing data.\n\nA: Please check out our Linux monitoring tool SeaLion. You can use it to schedule any command and then review the history of outputs in the dashboard. Data retention is a minimum of 7 days which can be extended further to 14 days depending on your requirement. You can also plot graphs from the metrics extracted from those outputs with a little bit of python. We are relatively new and looking for any and all kinds of feedback.\n\nA: You can make use of Enterprise Splunk to do the centralized log monitoring of your system as well as application components. For personal use free download provides indexing of up to 500MB per day which is very good limit. \nI am using it in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Desktop as well on another laptop(running Ubuntu 15.10 Desktop) for doing the centralized log monitoring, debugging and visualization.\nYou can download it from here\nI have installed it under /opt and it runs on the default port 8000.\nI am using splunk to monitor all the log files under /var/log and it looks like this. I can do a free text search on any of the error or string in the log files and it works great.\nYou can monitor multiple directories also.\nUsing splunk you can avoid doing a lot of shell scripting and pattern matching and good part everything is provided out of the box.\nThere are other tools like ELK(ElasticSearch Logstash Kibana) as mentioned here and SiLK.\nHope this helps.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu seems to not work with Lenovo Y700 even in Legacy Mode I have been trying for days to dual boot Linux and Win 8.1 with a Live CD install.

The last release AMD did can not be used because it is incompatible with the newer x.org display server. Most people will be able to the use the open source AMD video driver, but there are a few applications (certain graphics-intensive games, bitcoin mining) for which it is inadequate. Folk who rely on such applications might choose to remain on 14.04 LTS until adequate support lands in the open source AMD video drivers.\n\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Is Deprecating fglrx (Catalyst) In 16.04 LTS - Phoronix\n\nA: graphics for AMD Radeon graphics cards have been released for most Ubuntu versions and thus I would expect that they will also release one for 16.04.

My first try, I went to the Steam webpage, installed the installer there and opened it with the default option. I went through the install process and came up with an error stating that I was missing some 32 bit libraries. I searched the error on firefox and did what it told me to. I tried opening Steam again, resulting in a different error. (more 32 bit libraries, this time it was libGL) I looked this up as well and followed the instructions from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2233005. I tried turning Steam on again, resulting in the same error. After this, I decided to start over from scratch, so I deleted Steam through the application store and reinstalled it. I then tried to open Steam, resulting in nothing. No error messages, no terminal windows, nothing at all. I waited for 10 minutes before trying again, still nothing. \nWhat am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance for your help.\nEDIT: Organic Marble suggested typing \"Steam\" into terminal, which resulted in this message:   \n(gnome-terminal:1967): GLib-GIO-CRITICAL **: g_settings_get: the format string may not contain '&' (key 'monospace-font-name' from schema 'org.gnome.desktop.interface').  \n\nThis call will probably stop working with a future version of glib.\nIt also allowed Steam to open once again.\nRunning Steam gave me these messages:\n(gnome-terminal:3301): GLib-GIO-CRITICAL **: g_settings_get: the format string may not contain '&' (key 'monospace-font-name' from schema 'org.gnome.desktop.interface').

There are two ways to go about it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Long Way (safe): Go through and run sudo apt install [package name] with all known packages. It will tell you in the errors what others are needed. Add those to your list and keep trying until all dependencies are satisfied. This works correctly almost every time (I have had to do this around 45-55 times. It has never failed), but expect it to take 30 minutes to an hour and a half.\n\n*Fast Way (may fail to a degree): Run sudo apt-get -f install [package name] with one package at a time. (i.e. sudo apt-get -f install libgl1-mesa-dri:i386) That will force dependencies to install, but you sometimes get a slight error with Steam accepting the packages, depending on your release. 15.04 almost always fails in this way, but 14.04 LTS generally accepts them. \nIf steam doesn't accept them, you have to launch steam with a script. Do this to make the script:\n\n\n*\n\n*In terminal, type: cd Desktop && gedit launch_steam.sh && sudo chmod +X launch_steam.sh\n\n*When the text editor opens, insert this:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport LD_PRELOAD='/usr/$LIB/libstdc++.so.6'\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nsteam &\n\nMake sure your whitespace is correct.\nWhile this does work for opening the launcher, it often won't work for the individual games. If it doesn't, sorry, you are kind of out of luck if you don't want to create that script for each game. (replace steam with the command to run the game).\nExplanation: the first two commands create a shell script file on your desktop and the last one allows you to run it. The script allows you to force steam to use the proper drivers. The ampersand makes steam run in background (just its processes, don't worry, the window will still appear), rather than just open then stop.  If you made the script, you will have to open steam by typing this in the terminal ./Desktop/launch_steam.sh.\n", "Q: How does one properly copy a file into multiple folders and subfolders without overwriting the file contents in the destination folders? I actually tried an existing answer from:\nHow to copy a file to multiple folders using the command line?\nwhere I used the command:\nfind folder -exec cp file.txt {} \\;\n\nI wanted to use this because I wanted to copy one file named 'file.txt' to a directory named 'folder' and all its sub-directories without mentioning all the directories in the command. \nHowever, what this ended up doing was replacing the contents of every file in 'folder' and its subfolders with the contents of 'file.txt'. For example, if there was a 'foo.txt' inside folder, it would still retain the name 'foo.txt' but all of its contents would be replaced by that of 'file.txt'. This perplexed me and I tried the following interactive flag:\nfind folder -exec cp -i file.txt {} \\;\n\nand I got overwrite prompts for every single file in the directory 'folder' and all of its sub-directories, even though the names were all different. \nCan someone please help me figure out what's going on and what the appropriate command should be? \n\nA: You should restrict find to only listing directories:\nfind folder -type d -exec cp file.txt {} \\;\n\nAdditionally, in future, when you're cp'ing to a directory where the directory name comes from some other command, use the -t option to make sure it actually is a directory:\nfind folder -type d -exec cp -t {} file.txt \\;\n\nFrom man cp:\n-t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY\n      copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY\n\nSo, if a file is provided as an argument to -t, cp will automatically complain.\nAnother answer to that question does use -type d.\n", "Q: Errors when launching Windows 10 installation from grub My problem is that I have an Asus Zen book that I am trying to return through amazon after installing ubuntu on it.

It isn't a script, so you cannot take a look inside directly, you can check out its source code via running apt source klibc-utils or browsing the upstream repository at https://git.kernel.org/cgit/libs/klibc/klibc.git.\nSo the main function is in run-init.c , but it's just a wrapper for run_init function, which lives here in runinitlib.c\nrun_init does a lot of work:\n\n\n*\n\n*It jumps into the new root file system\n\n*Checks that this is the new root file system\n\n*Checks if it on initramfs\n\n*Cleans all directory (why waste the RAM?)\n\n*Mounts the new root file system\n\n*and runs init in the new root file system\n\n\nI believe, it would be very complicated to do all this work by a script, because of dependencies, but binary executable file can do it very ease.\n\nA: According to dpkg-query it's part of the klibc-utils package.

The relevant part of the .desktop file is:\nActions=NewWindow;NewPrivateWindow;Minimize\n\n[Desktop Action NewWindow]\nName=Open a New Window\nExec=firefox -new-window\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\n[Desktop Action NewPrivateWindow]\nName=Open a New Private Window\nExec=firefox -private-window\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\n[Desktop Action Minimize]\nName=Minimize Windows\nExec=sh /home/myusername/Documents/xdotool_sh/minimize.sh firefox\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nThe desktop action \"Minimize\" invokes a simple shell script, minimize.sh that has the following content:\n#/bin/bash\nname=$1\nfor i in $(xdotool search --class \"$name\"); do\n    xdotool windowminimize $i\ndone\n\nThe script uses xdotool, that can be installed from the official repositories, to find all the firefox windows, iterate over them and minimize them.\nThe script works and the launcher right menu option \"Minimize Windows\" works as well, but as soon as the windows are minimized, the mouse pointer gets in \"busy\" mode and stays like this for about 20 seconds (although the mouse actions are still responsive). \nDoes anyone know why starting a shell script from a right menu option in Unity could lead to this behaviour?\nEDIT: Apparently the wait period is inevitable, as explained in Jacob Vlijm's answer. Since the mouse remains responsive, avoiding the transformation of the pointer in the spinning wheel is a partial esthetic workaround, as explained on askubuntu.\nEDIT2: giving the system a fake window is a better solution, as explained by Jacob below.\n\nA: Just wanted to add an alternate fake_window implementation that is a little bit simpler and doesn't trigger python warnings on an Ubuntu 16.04 system.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport gi\ngi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0')\n\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nfrom gi.repository import GLib\n\n\"\"\"\nThis is a self-destroying window, to \"feed\" Unity a fake-window, preventing\nthe launcher to show a spinning wheel, waiting for a window to appear.\nInclude the command to run this script at the end of the (your) script.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef timer_cb():\n    Gtk.main_quit()\n    return False\n\ndef show_cb(widget, data=None):\n    GLib.timeout_add(500, timer_cb)\n\ndef fakewindow():\n    window = Gtk.Window()\n    # make our window transparent\n    window.set_opacity(0)\n    window.set_default_size(0,0)\n\n    window.connect(\"show\", show_cb)\n\n    window.show_all()\n\n    Gtk.main()\n\nfakewindow()\n\n\nA: Excellent question.\nThe cause\nNormally, when starting GUI applications from the Unity Launcher, the launcher waits for a window to appear. While waiting, it shows the \"spinning wheel\". It won't wait forever however; after about 20 seconds, the launcher assumes the window won't appear and gives up waiting.\n1. The main command of an application's launcher\nIn a .desktop file, concerning the first Exec= line (the main command), you can tell the launcher to wait or not, in a line:\nStartupNotify=true\n\nto make it wait, or \nStartupNotify=false\n\nto make it not wait.\n2. Quicklist items of a launcher\nFor possible quicklist (right-click) items of a launcher however, the default value is StartupNotify=true. Unfortunately, this value is fixed and cannot be changed by anything. \nThat means that if you start any command from right-clicking a launcher icon in the Unity Launcher, the launcher is expecting a window and waits for it, showing the spinning wheel.\nThe bottom line is that, although it can be explained, there seems to be no solution to the issue at the moment, other then creating a dedicated launcher for your script and add the line StartupNotify=false to the file.\nThe proof\nYou can test the behaviour yourself. Create two launchers:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Test\nExec=sh /home/myusername/Documents/xdotool_sh/minimize.sh firefox\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\n\nand:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Test\nExec=sh /home/myusername/Documents/xdotool_sh/minimize.sh firefox\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=false\n\nSave them as test1.desktop and test2.desktop, drag both launchers on to the Unity launcher. Click them and see the difference in behaviour.\n\nEdit; if it really bothers you, feed Unity a fake window\nIf you have many scripts in quicklists, and/or it really bothers you, there is another cosmetic solution; we can fake, invisible (fully transparent) to show a window, to be included in your script. your script would then be (e.g.)\n#/bin/bash\nname=$1\nfor i in $(xdotool search --class \"$name\"); do\n    xdotool windowminimize $i\ndone\nfake_window\n\nwhere the command fake_window will call our (fake-) window, making Unity end the spinning wheel.\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*Create, if it does not exist yet, the directory ~/bin\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as fake_window (no extension) in ~/bin and make it executable\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nfrom threading import Thread\nimport time\nimport subprocess\n\n\"\"\"\nThis is a self-destroying window, to \"feed\" Unity a fake-window, preventing\nthe launcher to show a spinning wheel, waiting for a window to appear.\nInclude the command to run this script at the end of the (your) script.\n\"\"\"\n\nclass FakeWin(Gtk.Window):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self, title=\"1526closeme\")\n        Thread(target = self.close).start()\n\n    def close(self):\n        t = 0\n        while t < 150:\n            time.sleep(0.2)\n            try:\n                pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"-f\", \"fake_window\"])\\\n                      .decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n                subprocess.Popen([\"kill\", pid])\n                break\n            except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n                pass\n            t += 1\n\ndef fakewindow():\n    window = FakeWin()\n    # make our window transparent\n    window.set_opacity(0)\n    window.set_default_size(0,0)\n    window.show_all()\n    Gtk.main()\n\nfakewindow()\n\n\n*Add to the very end of your script the command:\nfake_window\n\n\n*Log out and back in (or run source ~/.profile)\nThat's it, the wheel will now only spin for as long as the script runs.\nExplanation\nThe script does create a minimalistic window. The window however is fully transparent and has a size of 0x0 pixels and is thus invisible. It will destroy itself instantly once it exists. \nCalling the window at the end of your script, you will satisfy Unity's wish for a window, stopping the wheel to spin.\n", "Q: Booting external hard drive removed from laptop My laptop recently died, so I took the HD out of it, put it in a case to allow connecting it to a USB port and plugged it into my Desktop, a windoze box. When I tried made the USB drive the first boot device, I got a message saying there was no device installed. I've checked the UEFI settings and turned off fast  boot, but to no avail. Shouldn't this drive boot as if it were in the laptop? I have a USB flash drive with Ubuntu installed on it that boots fine, so what's the problem with the HD?\n\nA: There are quite a few reasons why this might not work, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drive failure -- As Alexiy suggests in a comment, the disk may have been the point of failure for your laptop.\n\n*Logical sector size changes -- Some external enclosures \"translate\" eight 512-byte logical sectors into one 4096-byte logical sector. When this happens, the partition table looks like gibberish and the disk can't be used with existing partitions.\n\n*BIOS vs. EFI booting -- If the old computer booted in BIOS mode and your new computer is EFI-based, you must enable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) to boot a BIOS-mode boot loader. If it's the other way around, you won't be able to boot your EFI-based OS on a BIOS-based computer. (At least not easily; tools like DUET and Clover can do it, but they're quite exotic and difficult to configure.)\n\n*EFI NVRAM variables are gone -- If both computers boot in EFI mode, you won't be able to boot an installation made on one computer after transferring the disk to another computer because part of the EFI boot process is a pointer to the boot loader stored in NVRAM, which of course remains on your old computer. You can work around this by using my rEFInd boot manager, even on a USB flash drive or CD-R if you don't want to install it permanently. rEFInd actively scans for boot loaders instead of relying on the NVRAM. Another option is to mount the EFI System Partition (ESP) of the target disk and copy the boot loader to the fallback filename of EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi, as described on this page of mine.\n", "Q: offline libreoffice Problem: when my laptop is offline, libreoffice freezes.

My dual-boot system crashed again - the Windows part, Ubuntu still worked fine - so I decided to erase the disk and install only Ubuntu Studio. First, I thought my hard disk was failing, but that can hardly be the case, if Ubuntu was still running fine? That is not the question, I might ask about that in another question.\nAs is evident from the output of Fdisk below, I only have Linux on my 1 TB disk (SDA) and in two partitions, root(ext4) and linux-swap. The SDB is an SSD, with Windows 10, cloned from the HDD on SDA. So in essence I have a dual-boot Windows-Ubuntu, but with each system on it's own disk.\nI want to dedicate at least half of the disk space, 500 GB, to a storage partition, for both systems, but also for backing up old documents.\nI know I can create an NTFS partition, but is it a bad idea to rearrange partitions, after I have installed Ubuntu? Is it better to do it before install, that is, choose Something else, delete all partitions and make new ones, before installing.\nYou may wonder what's the use of asking about this, if I have already installed Ubuntu. The answer is, I will probably reinstall anyway when Ubuntu Studio 16.04 is realeased late April.

All your data needs to be moved to a place on the disk that is free to move it to create the partitions you want. That is easy when you have empty disks, more difficult if the disks are used more then 80%. \nAs noted in comments: a power outage is the worst that can happen during a re-partitioning. And a resize will take longer the more filled a disk is so more chance for a power outage. Yes, it is a bit more risky than partitioning an empty disk if you can not trust your electricity provider.\n\nbut also for backing up old documents.\n\nUsing an internal disk to store copies of documents is just that: storing a copy of documents. It is NOT a backup. A backup should be made such that the system the originals are on can not affect the backup. Preferably that backup should also be stored outside your direct environment (ie. not inside your house). \n", "Q: Windows loads directly without showing the grub menu I have HP Pavilion 15 Notebook PC preinstalled with Windows 8.

I already have a second user for him, but he doesn't even get to the point where you can login yourself because he can't encrypt the drive.

E.g. if your LUKS partition is /dev/sda2, then:\nsudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda2\n\nWhile you're at it, also consider providing an --iter-time N (were N is the time in miliseconds) option to lower the risk of bruteforcing a keyslot. E.g. for a 2 seconds hashing time:\nsudo cryptsetup --iter-time 2000 luksAddKey /dev/sda2\n\nto list your current key slots:\nsudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda2\n\nAdding a new key slot first is also how I would recommende to change a current passphrase. First add a new one with the instruction above, reboot, verify the new passphrase works (you never know about keyboard layout mismatches etc.), then delete the old keyslot.\nsudo cryptsetup luksRemoveKey /dev/sda2\n\nYou'll then be asked to provide the passphrase to be removed.\nIn case you want to remove a key slot without providing the current passphrase, you can use luksKillSlot, but do that with great care and be sure to provide the right slot ID.\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 14.04 now can't boot windows 10 I installed Ubuntu so that I could still dual boot and run Windows 10 when I needed to but whenever I try to run any of the windows boot options from the grub menu I just get an error message and something along the lines of can't find disk image.\nI ran Boot-Repair and got this. It added a few items to the grub menu, but I still can't boot Windows.\nMy computer is a Lenovo u310 which came with windows 8 pre-installed and I later updated it to Windows 10. It has a dual hard drive system (it came like that) with a 500GB HDD and a 32GB SSD. I seem to remember that by default some of the boot files are on the SSD and I suspect that this may be where the problem lies, as the Ubuntu installer assumes you have only one hard drive.\nAs you'll see, that paste files is from a few months ago and after failing to get back into Windows at the time I just left it as it wasn't urgent at the time. It is now pretty urgent. \nI just tried to boot windows from a USB by installing the Windows 10 iso on a USB stick using GParted and and UNetbootin. I was going to try to use the Repair Windows option, however I can't seem to boot from the USB. I tried adding an option to do so in Grub using Grub Customizer, but when I try to use that option it says the Secure Boot is not allowing it to do so, and I am not allowed to disable Secure Boot in the system setup menu. I seem to remember that can be done in Windows, but I don't know how else to do it.\n\nA: Try it with Super GRUB 2 disk.\nYou can download it from here.\nThen install it in a USB using Unetbootin Now you could restart your system and make sure it is set in the boot option menu.\n\nA: I suspect you're running into this bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1091464\nThe three easiest solutions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Secure Boot -- I know you said in a comment that you can't do this, but you might want to try again. Resetting your firmware to its defaults may clear away whatever is preventing this change; however, this runs the risk of removing the reference to Ubuntu's boot manager in the NVRAM, which would then require additional repairs.\n\n*Install rEFInd -- My rEFInd boot manager is known to work around the problem. (rEFInd is more reliable at launching Windows than is GRUB.) If you install rEFInd from Ubuntu, it should copy Shim and work with Secure Boot enabled, with the caveat that you'll need to enroll refind.cer and/or refind_local.cer from the EFI/refind/keys directory on the ESP when you reboot. This is not hard if you know it's coming, but may cause panic if you don't expect it. See the rEFInd Secure Boot documentation for much more on this topic.\n\n*Use the computer's built-in boot manager -- Most EFI-based computers have an ugly and awkward but built-in boot manager. You typically access it by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key (usually F8 or higher) soon after turning on the computer (before GRUB, rEFInd, or anything else appears). This tool should enable you to boot to Windows, but on some computers it is so limited or difficult to access that it's next to useless.\n\n", "Q: vnstat does not show today statistics in conky I am using Xubuntu 15.10.

How do I config that in my Linux device?\nJust put in the DNS name and it will work? \nOr do I need to do more configuration ?\n\nA: Your Dynamic DNS is actually (almost certainly) pointing at your router not your Ubuntu computer. Even if you run it from a client inside the network, all DDNS can do is point at the public IP.\nI assume you have some port-forwards set up on your router to take the connection onto your Ubuntu server. The problem is that most home routers won't do internal redirects. So a local computer (regardless of operating system) will look at the DNS, get your public IP and try to connect. The router won't know how to forward this on.\nYou have a few options here, depending on what your router lets you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a DNS server inside the network (eg on your server) that provides its own interpretation of youraddress.no-ip.org that points directly to the right machine (with a local IP).\nIn essence, install BIND and configure it to get most of its DNS from your current DNS server but add overrides.\nBut then you need your network computers to use this as their DNS server so you'll need your router to specify this computer as the DNS server. Then when another local computer resolves (you might have to refresh its network connection first) it should get the local IP.\n\n*Just override the DNS on each local computer. Most systems allow editing /etc/hosts to assign IPs directly to DNS names.\n\n*Get a router that allows internal forwarding. This feature tends to become available in smaller enterprise routers so this isn't a cheap option.\n", "Q: flash player plugin problem I am trying to build pepperflash manually as it won't open from my software centre.

One of it's very nice features is it can convert .ods files to-and-from Google spreadsheets.\nI do this currently.  When I want to run calc locally, I do that.

As you point out, there is a problem with DNS resolution. There is something you can do to confirm that as the root issue:\nping 8.8.8.8 to see if routing works as intended. If you get a reply, it works.\nIn that case, you should make sure that the DNS setup is correctly handling both connections. In your case, it seems that the router's DHCP announces the router as DNS server, which then messes up your setup. Ways around that: \na) configure your router to not announce DNS via DHCP, or change the DNS server to 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)\nb) Manually set a nameserver in \\etc\\resolv.conf. Potentially, you need to disable local DNS caching with dnsmasq in network-manager configuration file\nEither solution should fix your problem.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on custom LVM I would like to install Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS on my desktop.

I need to download that directly from the website.\nI'm not home right now, so I don't have my script in front of me, but I'm currently doing it this way (mock URLs in my code sample).\nwget http://plex-website/downloads-page/plex-install-file-name-and-version.deb\ndpkg plex-install-file-name-and-version.deb\n\nUsing wget to download the file, and dpkg to install it. Works like a charm.\nThis is a fragile approach, though, because it depends on the specific version number of the file I'm downloading. Over time, that specific version number will change, so this script will become out of date.\nI'm looking for a dynamic way to write this so that I can download the file from the website without needing to hardcode the version number ahead of time. Ideally, something that I can use at multiple sites, because Plex is not the only one that I'll face this issue with.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I would scrape the website’s download page in order to get the URL for the desired package.\nExample: download the 32-bit version of Plex Media Server:\nurl=$(curl -s https://plex.tv/downloads | grep Ubuntu32 | cut -d\\\" -f2)\nwget \"$url\"\ndpkg -i \"${url##*/}\"\n\nFor other packages, you would need to examine the HTML source of the page containing download links. In the above example, I could see that the phrase Ubuntu32 only appeared once in the HTML source. Luckily, it is in the same line as the URL for the desired package: this URL is the first string of text enclosed in double quotes and the cut command provides a simple way to extract this string from the rest of the line.\nOther applications may have more complicated download pages which may require more complex scripting using sed, awk or possibly a more fully-featured language such as Perl, Python or Ruby.\n\nA: I dont know what file you are getting and from where but normally there is a shortcut to the latest / stable version e.g. http://plex-website/downloads-page/plex-install-file-name-LATEST.deb You could use that and it would also give you the same filename for the downloaded file that you could use in the dpkg command.\nAlternatively wget could be used with wildcards getting all possible versions and with some bash magic you could figure the highest of these.\ne.g. wget -r -l1 -np \"http://plex-website/downloads-page/\" -A \"plex-install-file-name-4.*.deb\"\n", "Q: Update asks for authentication When I try to update I get a message that some of the updates need authentication sources. The updates shown are Ubuntu base and NVIDIA X server setting.

Then I get this message:\nLos paquetes a instalar necesarios de fuentes no autenticadas.\n\n(since I use the Spanish version: it seems to mean the packages to be installed need sources that are not authenticated).\n\n\nA: it means your source of update has invalid certificate or certificate may be expired recently. in order to ignore that message, don't update your software when automatic pop-up shows. do it manually. in that no such message will be shown. i hope this will helps you.\n", "Q: How to disable .txt content icon preview?

I'd like users of my application to be able to install the application using pip because not all of its dependencies have made it into Debian yet, and I don't anticipate that situation changing any time soon. \nA PPA would be a good idea, of course, but in my case that would mean creating from scratch Debian packages for Python packages that are not my own and involve things I'm certainly not skilled at, e.g. SWIG.\nThe next best alternative to a PPA is Python's pip. And it works great! All the best advice says to use the --user option when running pip install. The pip developers say this and my impression is that Ubuntu actually defaults to this.\nHowever on Ubuntu I am seeing two problems when using --user with pip:\n\n\n*\n\n*The application executable is being installed into ~/.local/bin, which is not on the  default path in Ubuntu, in contrast to Fedora and possibly some other distros. (The setup.py uses setuptools' entry_points).\n\n*For some inexplicable reason, even though the .desktop file is in ~/.local/share/applications, the application does not show up in the Dash, even after logout. Unfortunately the man pages installed to ~/.local/share/man/man1 also don't appear when the user runs man from the terminal.\n\n\nI can ask Ubuntu users to create a ~/bin directory and add a symlink to my application in ~/.local/bin, but that won't solve the problem of the man page or the lack of a way to launch the application from the Dash. \nHow do I advise my users to best solve these problems?\nThe exact command I am advising users to install with is python3 -m pip install --user foo-1.0.tar.gz\n\nA: After talking with the Ubuntu devs on IRC, my understanding now is that Ubuntu follows Debian and adds ~/bin to the PATH if the folder exists. There are no plans to do the same for ~/.local/bin. So the end user must manually adjust their path, or add a symlink, etc. As an application developer I guess I'll need a special install script for Ubuntu and Debian users that does some of these things, which is a real shame, as I'm sure this hits every other Python application developer who relies on pip too. \n", "Q: How to fix Ubuntu touch calendar and a Google calendar out of sync? My Ubuntu touch calendar and my Google calendar are out of sync. \nThe remote calendar on Google is correct. How do I reinitialize the calendar on my phone? \n\nA: The only way I found to fix a bad synchronisation between Google calendar and the calendar app is following this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Settings > Account, remove the Google account.\n\n*Close the Calendar application on the phone (explained here how to do this).\n\n*In Settings > Account, create again the Google account.\n\n*In Settings > Account > Google, check at least the Calendar box.\n\n*Launch the Calendar app on the Phone. In the upper right menu (button with three horizontal bars), go to Calendars and select your Calendar again.\n\n*Synchronisation will start.\nAfter a surprisingly short time, your local calendar is reinitialised and identical, as far as I can see, to the Google Calendar.\n\n\nVoilà. Let us hope that the developpers of the app will soon fix all the bugs that cause the app to be out of sync.\n\nA: First, verify that the calendar application has access to your Google calendar by checking the Google entry in the \"Accounts\" section of the system settings. \"Calendar\" should be listed and the toggle should be switched to the \"on\" position.\nThen, in the upper right of the calendar application, press the three horizontal lines to display the menu. Press \"Calendars\" and check to make sure that the Google calendars that you want to sync with your phone are checked.\nFinally, go to the menu in the upper right of the calendar application again, press \"Sync,\" and the phone calendar should be updated to match the Google calendar. \n", "Q: Problem with Ubuntu 14.04 installation through wubi.exe I am facing the following problem during the installation of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:\n\n\nA: Wubi is not the recommended way to install Ubuntu.\nAlso it is known to generate a lot of issues.\nInstall Ubuntu the recommend way.  \nCreate a DVD/USB installation media and boot from it.\nStart the installation of the Ubuntu operating system ...\nYou can find many answers here explaining how to do it.  \nAlternatively you can install Ubuntu in a virtual machine.\nOne very popular and well working solution is VirtualBox.\nPersonally I recommend to perform the normal installation.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you still have Ubuntu ISO file, open it with Winrar or a program like Winrar.\n\n*Export the wubi.exe to this folder (Installation folder)\n\n*Run the wubi.exe again.\n\n\nIf problem is still here, download the iso file again and try 1., 2. and 3. steps again.

Are there security implications for blindingly adding third party repos to a workstation?  However, I've been very suspect of including non-offical repos. \nBackground and my particular case: \nI'd like to install a Juce. From what I understand, this is a stand alone utility to host VST (virtual instruments used in music production). I've found what appears to be it's source on github and have tried to compile that in a throw away VM. However, after receiving an errors on install (to which I may open a ticket here or on github later), I was curious to see if anyone had packaged it for Ubuntu.\n\nA: There are a few problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any repo can overwrite any package by default. You can pin a repo to only allow certain packages but that doesn't help against this because...\n\n*Those packages can write files anywhere. They'd have to not overwrite any existing  files but there are plenty of places you could hide a malicious file, which isn't to mention...\n\n*Packages can run anything as root on install and removal.\n\n\nSo yes, if you can't trust the controller of a repository (or trust that they're vetting the code that's going into the repo), you shouldn't be using that repo. A malicious package is game over.\n", "Q: Xampp port not working I've got xampp installed on ubuntu.

Tks\n\nA: When GRUB loads grub.cfg from the EFI partition, it sets your EFI partition as the root for GRUB. In order to load another grub.cfg from another partition, you would have to change GRUB's root so it knows where to look for the second config.\nAlso, loading the ntfs module may be required. So, your menu entry would look something like this:\nmenuentry 'Windows' {\n  insmod part_gpt\n  insmod ntfs\n  set root='hd1,gpt2' #This is where you tell grub where to start searching for the new config file\n  configfile ${root}/path/to/grug2.cfg\n}\n\nIf the ntfs module cannot be loaded, copy it from Ubuntu's /boot/grub/x86_64-efi/ntfs.mod to /boot/efi/boot/grub.\nOr you could hard-code it a bit more and make it more simple with something like this:\nmenuentry 'Windows' {\n  insmod part_gpt\n  insmod ntfs\n  configfile (hd1,gpt2)/path/to/grub2.cfg\n}\n\nNote, this is not tested, but if you have any issues let me know and I'd be glad to help.\n", "Q: DisplayLink ASUS MB168B+ issues First of all, let me tell you I am fond of Ubuntu and linux, using it every day since 4-5 years now.

Right off for me, on 16.04, with one caveat: it was unable to start the service it needs to run because I was on UEFI \"safeboot\", and the failure was very silent.\nGoing into bios and turning off safeboot fixed it for me. There's also mokutils, though that didn't work for me.\nFinally, there is a nice package on github for debian, though they hadn't updated with the new driver, so it wasn't quite working for me--just nearly. I messaged the repo maintainer, however, and by the next morning he had updated it. (Later edit: next computer I had, I used it, and it worked great for me.)\nI believe distro detection is now resolved in the most recent version.\n\nA: My monitor is ASUS MB169B+, and my OS is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nWhat I do to make it work:\n\n*\n\n*Download displaylink package from http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/ubuntu\n\n\n*Unzip the package, and cd to the folder\n\n\n*Run\n./displaylink-driver-1.2.65.run\n\nThe first time it complained of missing packages for dkms;\n\n\n*Run\nsudo apt-get install dkms\n\n\n\n*Run the script again\n./displaylink-driver-1.2.65.run\n\nAnd now it should install successfully;\n\n\n*Reboot the system\nIn the settings menu, I can set my display now, and it works well.\n", "Q: Problems with ethernet Ubuntu 14.04 I am a newbie with Ubuntu and I am having a very weird problem, hopping you guys can help me out.\nI set an Ethernet ip static for eth0\n   addr 192.168.0.100\n   mask 255.255.255.0\n   gateway 192.168.0.100\n\nWhen I connect my Ubuntu with my Ethernet network, everything is fine, I get the Ethernet connection.\nMy work also requires the Ethernet connection with another device, and now this is the strange thing.

Anyway, I found the solution after digging the Internet. Anyway, for someone that has the similar problem with me, you should check the version of the driver of the Ethernet and the version of the Ubuntu. \nIn my case, my computer uses the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and the Ethernet is Realtek Semiconductor RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller and the Kernal driver is r8169.\nYou should remove the driver and use the older version. r8168 works in my case.\n", "Q: cache/pip disabled immediately after instalation of pip I'm running Ubuntu 15.10. I installed Pyhon 2.7 through aptitude:\nsudo apt-get install python\n\nnow I'm trying to install pip using this guide. I downloaded get-pip.py, then I tried:\nsudo python get-pip.py\n\nInstallation worked fine, but I got these annoying warnings:\nThe directory '/home/administrator/.cache/pip/http' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled.

If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.\n\nSo I uninstalled all by the following command:\nsudo python -m pip uninstall pip setuptools\n\nAnd I tried a new installation without sudo:\npython get-pip.py\n\nbut I got the following error:\nOSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip'\n\nHow can I install pip (and wheels) in a proper way with caching enabled?\n\nA: First, Python 2.7 is pre-installed on every currently supported Ubuntu release already. So you would not have had to install it first. That's why apt-get has told you that python is already in the newest version.\nSecond, you should usually prefer the Python modules packaged for apt from the repositories over those you get with pip from PyPI, unless you rely on the features or bug fixes of the latest version. The repository versions are often more or less outdated, but proofed to be compatible with whatever other package that is requiring them.\nSo to install pip for Python 2, run this:\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\n\nIn case this old pip version is not working for your needs, you can later simply get the latest version (without uninstalling the old one!) using this command:\nsudo -H pip install --upgrade pip\n\nAnother tip for you:\nYou should learn about and use virtualenvs, virtual python environments. You can install Python modules in a viertualenv only without affecting other virtualenvs or the system. It's the safest way to prevent version incompatibilities and messing around with packages needed by the system and other programs.\n", "Q: Script used to run `run-parts` for portmapping using Java program upon failover doesn't work #!/bin/sh\n# Setup portforwarding on router depending on interface running scripts from a directory 10.0.0.30 being eth0 represented by folder 30 and 10.0.0.31 being wlan0 represented by folder 31\neth0_status=$(cat /sys/class/net/eth0/operstate)\nwlan0_status=$(cat /sys/class/net/wlan0/operstate)\nif [ \"$eth0_status\" = \"up\" ] && [ \"$wlan0_status\" = \"down\" ] ;\n    then\n      CURRDEV=eth0\nfi  \nif [ \"$eth0_status\" = \"down\" ] && [ \"$wlan0_status\" = \"up\" ] ;\n    then\n       CURRDEV=wlan0\nfi\nif [ \"$eth0_status\" = \"down\" ] && [ \"$wlan0_status\" = \"down\" ] ;\n    then\n       CURRDEV=\nfi\nif [ \"$CURRDEV\" = \"eth0\" ] ;\n    then\n       run-parts \"/opt/portmapper/30\"\n       echo \"Current device Ethernet\"\nelif [ \"$CURRDEV\" = \"wlan0\" ] ;\n     then\n       run-parts \"/opt/portmapper/31\"\n       echo \"Current device WiFi\"\nelse\n   echo \"No changes need to be made to port mappings\"\nfi\n\nScript currently works but for it to be less load I need variable checking to prevent the run-parts from executing every time the script runs.

Nevertheless Debian has removed the non-compliant JSON extension, and instead offered a replacement extension that is functionally equivalent.\nTo be clear: PHP itself has NOT removed JSON, it's still in master. This is a distro / package manager issue.\nRasmus makes it pretty clear:\n\nWe have not removed json and we will never release a version of php without json support built in.

So naturally I wanted to get rid of kde completely and get the defaults back so I installed ubuntu-dekstop. Restarted and that's it, black screen and nothing happens. But the strange thing is when I choose to boot with the upstart option it starts just fine. The question then is can I get normal boot to work again?

I find this finicky, so I disable it.  In MacOS only the left/right buttons are used. (boolean)\n\n*emulate_scroll_wheel = the module interprets horizontal and vertical swipes as wheel ticks.  The vertical function works fine by emulating both press and release for each tick, but the horizontal one only emulates presses and not releases which causes problems in the back and forth swipes in Chrome, so I disable it in the driver (see more in the driver section). (boolean)\n\n*report_undeciphered = no need to turn it on. (boolean)\n\n*scroll_acceleration = the faster you move your finger, the more ticks per distance it generates. (boolean)\n\n*scroll_speed = this tells it how many ticks to generate when you swipe your finger a given distance; I like it to be sensitive, so I set it to 55. (0 - 63)\n\n\nTo update the settings, the easiest way is to unload the module and reload it with the new settings.

Press F10 to boot the Ubuntu operating system.\nWhen the login screen appears press Ctrl + Alt  + F1 .Enter your user name and the password, then execute :\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*  \nsudo reboot \n\nNow install the latest official stable NVIDIA drivers.Boot the computer, when the GRUB menu appears ...\nHighlight the Ubuntu menu entry and press the E key.Add nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line. Press F10 to boot the Ubuntu operating system.\nWhen the login screen appears press Ctrl + Alt  + F1. Enter your user name and the password, then execute :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-361\nsudo reboot\n\nNote : Maybe it is explicitly necessary to select the NVIDIA adapter in BIOS.\nIn case you have installed the nvidia driver from their site then uninstall it as per that instructions.Uninstall that driver by running, as root, sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-361.28.run and follow the on screen instructions.\nNote : The solution I have provide has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 15.10 for two GPUs. Mine HP Laptop has Nvidia GTX 950M graphics card. While HP Desktop has Nvidia 610.\n\nA: Screen Blanks/Monitor Turns Off\nUsing a laptop with a GeForce Go card, or connecting the sole display via DVI on a dual-head system sometimes results in the screen not receiving a picture. This is caused by the driver outputting video to the VGA port on the graphics card, instead of DVI.\nThe usual hint that you have this problem is when you hear the startup sound but nothing appears on the screen. If you do not hear any sound, you are more than likely experiencing unrelated problems.\nThis is a bug about displays on digital outputs being blank when using NVIDIA driver, and can be resolved by editing your /etc/X11/xorg.conf:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to the console by using CTRL+ALT+F1, or reboot and select recovery mode from the GRUB menu.\n\n*Open and edit xorg.conf like this: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\n\n*Find the line that says: Section \"Screen\"\n\n*Insert a new line that says Option \"UseDisplayDevice\" \"DFP\".\n\n*Save the file by pressing CTRL+x and confirming to save. If you had to restart into recovery mode, type reboot, otherwise restart your display using sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart. \n\n\nfor more see here [Nvidia-ubuntu]\n\nA: It's just a simple glitch in any linux distro. It happens because the way we install the drivers either through .run file or an unknown package managers. Main cause is that these procedures does not disable default xorg drivers & make nvidia drivers unusuable. For Ubuntu there's officially a procedure inorder to install nvidia drivers securely.\n\n\n*\n\n*Before install, remove any previous existing nvidia drivers:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\n*Ensure your Ubuntu based distro has a builtin driver manager, if not:\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-driver-manager\n\n*Update graphics drivers repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\n\n*Search \"Driver manager\" through start & open it.\nWait until Information gets collected.\n5.Install suitable latest nvidia drivers & restart linux to confirm changes.\n\n", "Q: How to properly install ubuntu so it will boot on laptops designed for Windows10?

As per that Intel certifies Linux kernel 4.2 onwards for that wifi card. As per your logs you are still on linux kernel 3.13 which is not certified by Intel and may not work even after work around that you are trying to do.\nSo my advice is to upgrade to Ubuntu Desktop 15.10 which has Linux kernel 4.2 and it will work. \nI had Intel 3165 and struggled a lot with Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 LTS. Finally i decided to fresh install Ubuntu 15.10 and that fixed the problem. Same i will suggest for you - it will save time and efforts.\nYou can refer to my thread here\nI could only fix it by installing Ubuntu 15.10 which comes with Kernel 4.1/4.2. With the upgraded kernel in Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 LTS i used to get some what intermittent connection issues with the work around suggested in that thread.\nWhen you are installing Ubuntu 15.10 - i will suggest connect your laptop via Ethernet cable. Once everything is installed then you can test your wifi card also. It should work.\n\nA: I suggest you try newer firmware. With a working internet connection, please open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenELEC/iwlwifi-firmware.git\ncd iwlwifi-firmware/firmware\nsudo cp iwlwifi-7260*  /lib/firmware\n\nReboot and see if the wireless is now working.\n", "Q: Dual boot between Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.10 I have installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 on my Acer Aspire E E5-573G-52G3 and I was able to boot into Ubuntu one time.

To setup your UEFI/BIOS to boot to the boot loader.\nThe only thing you need to change is actually a small code in the MBR (Master Boot Record) inside the first hard disk (or the EFI partition). Change the boot code to point to your boot loader in Ubuntu. \nSave your changes.

I want to get it back to Firefox, so I opened System Settings, went into Applications -> File Associations, found the text/html setting, and moved Kate below my browsers. Imagine my surprise when, after clicking Apply, Kate jumped back up to the top! Also, opening a link through xdg-open still launches Kate. That's not supposed to happen, right? Is this a bug? Or is there something else I need to do?\nEnvironment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kubuntu 15.10 (current on updates)\n\n*Kate 15.08.2\n\n\nA: Making the suggestion by @user26687 the \"official\" answer...\nThis bug is already filed at kde.org against the KDE kcm_filetypes component.\nI used the suggested workaround:\n\nA workaround on the user side is to merge $HOME/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list to $HOME/.config/mimeapps.list, and create a symbolic link to $HOME/.config/mimeapps.list at $HOME/.local/share/applications. System Settings then works fine.\n\nIt sort of works. Sometimes (most of the time?) moving things up and down doesn't properly apply. Also, if I open mimeapps.list in a text editor and move things around manually, the System Settings dialog doesn't reflect it. However, at least I can open links in Firefox now.\n\nA: Having the same problem, I tried the solution mentioned in the original post, namely moving kate downwards in the list of applications registered for HTML. The difference is: I moved it downwards by three rows (clicked three times on \"Move down\").\nWhen clicking on Apply, Kate only jumped one row upwards. So a possible solution is to set Kate below the desired postition, then click \"Apply\" and see it jump right at the desired position.\nI don't know if it applies for everyone experiencing this problem. I hope it will help a few people...\n", "Q: KDE session cannot start on kubuntu 15.10 I run an Asus laptop on kubuntu 15.10.

I also have an IM client (Hipchat) open at all times, but I interact with it only rarely compared to the other two apps.\nA recurring annoyance is that after I interact with the Hipchat window and Alt-Tab back to (say) my editor, my muscle memory is tuned to expect another Alt-Tab to focus on my browser, but I end up on Hipchat again.\nIs there any way to cause Hipchat to be sent to the bottom of the stack or recency list or whatever it is, after it loses focus by any means?\n\nA: What you ask is actually to allow a specific application's window to only appear either on first- or last position, z-wise.\nWhen the gedit window (in this example) loses focus, it is sent to the last poition (z-wise, below the semi-transparent terminal window) instead of descending only one position:\n \n\nZ- position of a window\nWhile it can be done, we still have to overcome some serious complications; When the window is sent to the very last position, you will want to keep the z-order of all other windows. However, currently, there are no tools that can give us this z-order of windows. Both xdotool and wmctrl give us no information on this whatsoever.\nWhat we can do however is to keep track of the focus history of (all) windows. Since a window descends one position if another window gets focus, we can conclude the z-order of windows if we run a background script to watch the focus history of windows.\nThe solution two small background scripts\nThe solution below exists of two small background scripts, to run simultaneously. \n\n\n*\n\n*A script to keep track of the focus history: focus_history.py\n\n*A script to send the targeted application's window to the last position if it loses focus: set_z.py\nScript 1\nfocus-history.py\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport os\n\nrootdata = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.focus_history\"\nopen(rootdata, \"wt\").write(\"This is an empty line\")\n\ndef current_windows():\n    try:\n        return subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\ndef convert_format(w_id):\n    return w_id[:2]+(10-len(w_id))*\"0\"+w_id[2:]\n\ndef read_data():\n    return open(rootdata).read().splitlines()\n\ndef get_top(wlist):\n    try:\n        top = convert_format(\n            [l.split(\"#\")[-1].strip() for l in subprocess.check_output(\n                [\"xprop\", \"-root\"]\n                ).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines() \\\n               if \"_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)\" in l][0])\n        return [l for l in wlist if top in l][0]\n    except IndexError:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    while True:\n        time.sleep(1)\n        wdata = current_windows()\n        if wdata != None:\n            wlist = wdata.splitlines()\n            # get frontmost window (as in wmctrl -lG)\n            top = get_top(wlist)\n            oldlist = read_data()\n            if not any([top == oldlist[0], top == None]):\n                # clean up closed windows\n                [oldlist.remove(l) for l in oldlist if not l.split()[0] in wdata]\n                # remove possible other mentions of the active window\n                [oldlist.remove(l) for l in oldlist if l.startswith(top.split()[0])]\n                open(rootdata, \"wt\").write((\"\\n\").join([top]+oldlist))\n\nScript 2\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport focus_history\n\n# --- set the process name of your application below\nproc = \"gedit\"\n# ---\n\nfocus_hist = focus_history.rootdata\n\ndef get(val):\n    try:\n        return subprocess.check_output(val).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\ndef front_w():\n    get_front = str(hex(int(get([\"xdotool\", \"getactivewindow\"]))))\n    return get_front[:2]+(10-len(get_front))*\"0\"+get_front[2:]\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    pid = get([\"pgrep\", proc])\n    front1 = \"\"\n    while pid:\n        time.sleep(1)\n        frontpid = get([\"xdotool\", \"getactivewindow\", \"getwindowpid\"])\n        front2 = frontpid == pid\n        if front2 != front1:\n            if front2 == False:\n                zdata = [l for l in open(focus_hist).read().splitlines()]\n                wins = list(reversed([l.split()[0] for l in zdata if not pid in l]))\n                for w in wins+[front_w()]:\n                    cmd = [\"xdotool\", \"windowraise\", w]\n                    subprocess.call(cmd)\n        pid = get([\"pgrep\", proc])            \n        front1 = front2\n\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses both wmctrl and xdotool\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool\n\n\n*Copy script 1 into an empty file, save it (exactly!) as focus_history.py\n\n*Copy script 2 into an empty file, save it as set_z.py in the exact same directory as script 1.\nIn the head section of the script, in the line:\nproc = \"gedit\"\n\nreplace \"gedit\" by the process name of your application (between quotes)\n\n*Test- run the script: Before opening any (additional) windows, start script 1 by the command:\npython3 /path/to/focus_history.py & python3 /path/to/set_z.py\n\n[The script will recognize windows that were focussed at least once.

I've been following this website's instructions but once I reboot my computer and log back in and run uname -r, the Kernel is still 4.2.0-30-generic.

But I imagine that this must be a very simple program to make. \nCan I make it with C and/or shell script? \nI want to make a function that does something like bool setDesktopBG(ImagePath path) what are the main calls I must make in order to do it? Which packets should I access to do it? I never coded nothing related to the OS like this so I don't know where exactly to begin?\nAlso, is this question more suitable to Stack Overflow? If it's the case, I'll delete it and post there. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: What changes the wallpaper\nIn case of  Ubuntu's default behavior when it comes to backgrounds, that's set through gsettings. In a nut shell, it's a form of database for settings to various apps. The simple command is this:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"$FILE\" \n\n, where \"$FILE\" is the shell script variable that holds full path to image in the form file:///path/to/image.png\nThat's somewhat different from other desktop environments. Think of Ubuntu's Unity   and Gnome as having a layer above typical X11 server ( i.e. the layer above GUI environment ). In such environments as blackbox or openbox you'd need to call an external program. For instance , feh --bg-scale /path/to/image\nI assume you want to deal with default environment - Ubuntu's Unity.\nMaking a shell function\nHere's example of what I use in my .bashrc file.\nfunction chbackground {\n    FILE=\"'file://$(readlink -f \"$1\" )'\" \n    echo changing to \"$FILE\" \n    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"$FILE\" \n}\n\nThe function can be called like so \nchbackground WALLPAPERS-FOLDER/cool-background.png\n\nThis function has two important parts. First, we can either have full path or partial path to the file - that's what readlink -f \"$1\" takes care of - it returns full path to image. Then we turn that into a string by combining output of readlink -f \"$1\" and file://. Remember, Unix path is always starting with root folder, /, so we need only leading two slashes there. Result would be file:///home/user/WALLPAPERS-FOLDER/cool-background.png string and stored in FILE variable.  \nFinally we call gsettings with FILE as argument. \nThis function can be part of any script and called with any partial or full path as parameter\nPutting together a script\nHere's a script I sketched out in about 15 minutes that will make a list of images , and then select random image out of that list, and set background to that image. The script is also placed in my github  , sergrep repository repository and will be developed just a little bit more to include extra functionality, but for the most part , the code version here does the big job.\nIn order to automate this script , refer to How do i make a program autostart every time i log in ?\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n#\n###########################################################\n# Author: Serg Kolo , contact: 1047481448@qq.com \n# Date: March 10th 2016 \n# Purpose: Set random wallpaper\n#      To make it start automatically, add it as one of \n#          the Startup Applications in Ubuntu's Unity \n#          or Gnome \n# \n# Written for: https://askubuntu.com/q/744464/295286\n# Tested on: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n###########################################################\n# Copyright: Serg Kolo , 2016\n#    \n#     Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software is hereby granted\n#     without fee, provided that  the copyright notice above and this permission statement\n#     appear in all copies.\n#\n#     THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n#     IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n#     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

I am just curious to know the time taken by my system to boot.\nIn Arch Linux there is something like systemd-analyze.\nWhat is the alternative in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Right after boot, run dmesg command.

The uptime command executed right after you boot the system will give you a general idea. However, it will take you extra seconds to enter password and login. Better approach would be to set calling uptime > /opt/BOOT.txt as part of lightdm startup script. It will be executed once the login screen shows up.\nTo do that , open or create /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file with root permissions.\nIt should contain the following lines:\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-setup-script=uptime > /opt/BOOT.txt\n\nAfter your next reboot there will be file /opt/BOOT.txt which will tell you how long system has been up.\nAlternatively you could read /proc/uptime where the first entry is uptime in seconds\n\nA: systemd-analyze is there on ubuntu.\nYou can only use that if you are using systemd as boot. dmesg -d would give you time taken for each command on boot process to execute..\nYou can always get systemd-analyze by using\n sudo apt-get install systemd systemd-analyze \n\nA: You're looking for bootchart.\nsudo apt-get install bootchart\n\nIt drops an image as well as the compressed log in your /var/log showing processes and so on.\nPROTIP: You may have to run sudo update-initramfs -u -k all to get it to run at the earliest opportunity.\n", "Q: How to check OS version using php (script) file I have a Linux Server and only having ftp access for it I want to check Server full detail like OS version, RAM, HDD, installed packages etc is it possible using php script file to get information for the server.?\nI tried to get its details using phpinfo.php\n   <<?php\necho php_uname();\necho PHP_OS;\necho '<br />';\n$bytes = disk_free_space(\".\");\n$si_prefix = array( 'B', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB', 'EB', 'ZB', 'YB' );\n$base = 1024;\n$class = min((int)log($bytes , $base) , count($si_prefix) - 1);\necho $bytes .

I just read that the latest stable release 16.04 will no longer use the AMD fglrx driver, and thus purge it at upgrading to 16.04 LTS. My question is, since I'm using hybrid graphics with AMD Radeon R9 HD8700 and onboard Intel Graphics, switching between the Catalyst driver and Intel - should I just do a clean install of the latest version or choose to upgrade? I am not worried about the data, the computer is relatively new, but will it be safe to upgrade?\nIs there any place I can check the supported graphic cards for the 16.04 version?\nThanks.\n\nA: Actually there are many answers about this already.\nYou will have support for HD cards (probably) but by using the opensource driver (radeon) which works pretty fine.\nthe fglrx driver nor catalyst work anymore, is not just deprecated it won't even install.\nthere's a new closed source driver \"amdgpu-pro\" http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Radeon-GPU-PRO-Linux-Beta-Driver–Release-Notes.aspx\nbut its in beta and doesnt support old cards. My card is a r7 260x it says it's supported but still doesnt work because it says it's not being detected.\n\nA: If you're talking \"close source or open source drivers\" AMDGPU is the new fglrx for newer cards and display servers.  With a hybrid card, my guess is the best support would be out of this driver, but that idea lacks testing.  \nAlso, for anyone that doesn't know, deprecated means:\nWe plan to remove completely in the future, but it still works for now.\nJust for clarity.  \nWith corner cases, I always do a clean install.  Getting switchable graphics working exactly how you want, at current, I still consider a relatively risky corner case.

These two packages where somehow creating conflicts.

Following the OP's train of thought, I was able to solve this by running:\nsudo apt-get purge texlive* context dvipng feynmf fragmasater latex* luatex musixtex pmx propser tex4ht* tipa\n\nplus a few other dependencies that would emerge as I iterated on the apt-get purge command.

I can load Xubuntu normally but if I try to boot Windows I'm getting a 'peep' sound out of my pc and a black screen appears. \nIve tried to reinstall grub boot nothing changed. \nDo you have some ideas?\n\nA: This sounds like an issue beyond the grub in the Windows boot process.\nI would suggest to boot with your Windows installation DVD or with a Windows recovery USB (You can make one in Windows 10, if you have another PC with Windows 10) an do a repair/recovery (F8) . \nYou will probably need to reinstall grub afterwards since the repair process will most likely \"repair\" the masterboot record and remove grub.\nAlternatively: This might be a sign that your way should rather go via free open source  GNU/Linux than via proprietary  Windows.

How can I create a custom command so that I only have to type rubber text.tex or rubb text.tex (or something like this) for it to do the same as the long command above?\n\nA: I would use something simple, like\n#!/bin/bash\nrubber --pdf $1 && rubber --clean $1\n\nthen you save it in a folder in your $PATH and you are done.\nI usually suggest to create (if not present) the folder ~/bin to contain your user's scripts, and then add it to your $PATH variable, following this solution.\n", "Q: How to set up a disk-image I created an Android Open Source project that requires to be installed on an Ubuntu machine a lot of tools, packages. In order to facilitate contributions, I want to create a disk-image with all pre-installed tools and configurations. Is there a simple way to do that? Do I need docker?\n\nA: You could package it as ISO archive (or any other archive like tar, zip, ...) using the Archive Manager from Nautilus' context menu of a file or folder:\nOpen your Files Manager (Nautilus) and navigate to the location of what you want to package. Right-click on that and select Compress... from the context menu. The window below will appear:\n\nEnter a filename select a format/suffix from the drop-down list on the right. I selected .iso here. On some formats you can set a password or split the archive up into smaller chunks, but ISO does not support any of those Other Options. Then chose a target directory where to place the created archive and click on Create.\n\nOnce the archive is created, you can either normally open it using the Archive Manager (file-roller) or you can mount it like a disk image using Archive Mounter. \nTherefore navigate to the location of the archive in your Files Manager (Nautilus) and right-click on it. In the context menu, select Open with → Archive Mounter. \n\nIt will automatically mount the archive anywhere and you can access it through the list of devices in the left part of Nautilus.\nThe Archive Mounter should be able to somehow mount most archive formats.\nWhen you created an ISO archive, you also have the additional option to open it with Disk Image Mounter. That one does mount it like a real CD/DVD and uses the mount point /media/<<YOUR_USERNAME>>/CDROM.\n", "Q: Enable to write in Virtualbox's shared folder I have a Lubuntu 15.10 VM installed  in a Windows 7  host and running with Virtualbox Version 5.0.14 .\nI've created a permanent shared folder in Virtualbox's machine configuration and set it to be automatically mounted and unchecked the read only option\nWhen I try to copy a directory to this mounted folder I get this error message for every file in the source directory\nroot@foo /v/w/h/# sudo cp -r . /media/sf_C_DRIVE\ncp: impossible de créer le fichier standard «/media/sf_C_DRIVE/./.gitignore»: Erreur de protocole\ncp: impossible de créer le fichier standard «/media/sf_C_DRIVE/./composer.json»: Erreur de protocole\ncp: impossible de créer le fichier standard «/media/sf_C_DRIVE/./composer.lock»: Erreur de protocole\ncp: impossible de créer le fichier standard «/media/sf_C_DRIVE/./composer.phar»: Erreur de protocol\n\nWhich is literary translated to impossible to create the standard file /media/sf_C_DRIVE/./.gitignore : protocole error\nAny Idea about how can I fix this ?\nEdit 1\nMy user is already in the vboxsf group\nroot@jerbi /m/sf_C_DRIVE# groups jerbi\njerbi : jerbi adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare vboxsf\n\nSo it seems to be a mount error as I can't remount the folder getting this error\n/sbin/mounpt.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: Protocol error\n\n\nA: Fixed this by creating a new mount point in /home/username/share\n# ln -s /media/sf_C_DRIVE /home/username/share\n# chown username:username /home/username/share\n# exit\n\nThen I restarted the system and run chmod to the new directory in the startup\n$ chmod 777 ~/share\n\n\nA: The usual problem is that you must add yourself into the vboxsf group in /etc/group on the guest machine.

(aside: I reduced the font sizes initially and / or dpi , because the laptop display resolution 1360 x 768 doesn't leave much room for desktop operations; so reverting to the original setting is a distinct possibility) I logged off and on again without success, then rebooted and logged in again to find my DE returned to my preferred settings and thought nothing of it. Logging on today I see the same, and no amount of resetting or rebooting is curing the issue.\nAnalysis:\nI have discovered that no changes made to the Xfce interface via System->Appearance->Fonts make any difference to the rendering of my DE. Neither font face, style, size, anti-aliasing or DPI. In fact, none of the settings in the Appearance applet seem to have any effect on the desktop, from icons to widget themes, even after a reboot and I recall them responding pretty instantly in the past.\nSupposition:\nHas this applet lost the right to alter these configurations at a lower level? I don't even know how to test that theory, or where these settings are stored.\nInfo:\nThe installed system is 14.04, and updates come through sporadically in work. (better if I take the laptop home and let it update on my home network) Xfce About dialogue reports 4.10. Any other details or reports, just let me know what you want me to run.\nI hope someone can help me resolve this, as it's quite difficult to fit everything on screen this big.\n\nA: Can you change settings via the Settings Editor? Font and DPI settings are located under \"xsettings.\" You could also try changing settings by xfconf-query with a command like the following and also see if it shows any kind of error:\nxfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Gtk/FontName -s \"DejaVu Sans 10\"\n\nYou could see if this works to change the DPI:\nxfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Xft/DPI -s \"96\"\n\nYou may also want to make sure you are the owner of these files by running the following.

Although the issues in both questions have the same background, both the symptoms and the possible solution are slightly different.\nThe cause\nAfter starting GUI applications from the Unity Launcher (by clicking on the icon), the launcher waits for a window to appear. While waiting, the cursor blinks. It takes the launcher a while before it comes to the conclusion that its \"date\" (the window) won't show up. While waiting however, the launcher does not accept new clicks to execute the script (again).\nThe solution in the above linked question, adding\nStartupNotify=false\n\ndoes solve the spinning wheel of the mouse cursor, but does not make the icon responsive again.\nThen what does work?\nThe other solution in the linked answer however (opening a fake, invisible window when starting a non- GUI script from the Unity launcher) will also solve the issue of the blinking icon. \nFrom the linked answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create, if it does not exist yet, the directory ~/bin\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as fake_window (no extension) in ~/bin and make it executable\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nfrom threading import Thread\nimport time\nimport subprocess\n\n\"\"\"\nThis is a self-destroying window, to \"feed\" Unity a fake-window, preventing\nthe launcher to show a spinning wheel, waiting for a window to appear.\nInclude the command to run this script at the end of the (your) script.\n\"\"\"\n\nclass FakeWin(Gtk.Window):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self, title=\"1526closeme\")\n        Thread(target = self.close).start()\n\n    def close(self):\n        t = 0\n        while t < 150:\n            time.sleep(0.2)\n            try:\n                pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"-f\", \"fake_window\"])\\\n                      .decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n                subprocess.Popen([\"kill\", pid])\n                break\n            except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n                pass\n            t += 1\n\ndef fakewindow():\n    window = FakeWin()\n    # make our window transparent\n    window.set_opacity(0)\n    window.set_default_size(0,0)\n    window.show_all()\n    Gtk.main()\n\nfakewindow()\n\n\n*Add to the very end of your script the command:\nfake_window\n\n\n*Log out and back in (or run source ~/.profile)\nNow the icon will not blink for seven seconds if you run your script from the Unity Launcher.\n", "Q: Ubuntu MATE, Whole desktop crashes when exiting fullscreen video in chrome/chromium I have an issue where the whole desktop crashes when exiting fullscreen video in chrome/chromium.

An IPv6 host address is matched if 'prefixlen' bits of 'net' is equal to the 'prefixlen' bits of the address. For example, the [net]/prefixlen pattern '[3ffe:505:2:1::]/64' matches every address in the range '3ffe:505:2:1::' through '3ffe:505:2:1:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff'. \nTo use IPv6 addresses you must enclose them in []'s.

Now it happened to me today that my vagrant box was corrupted and it got newly created. In this process it deleted my whole database of course. I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it right, that vagrant or lxc does not react with a gracefull shutdown when getting a SIGTERM signal from ubuntu when I shut it down? And because of that vagrant boxes can get corrupted? I get this idea because a co-worker told me that this could happen and because of this and this\n\n*Is it possible to change the default behaviour of vagrant up, so instead of just creating a new container and overwriting the old one, when it doesn't find a right box. It informs the user and waits for user input. So I could stop vagrant up and do a sql dump before creatinx the box new? This question is probably a change request for vagrant, but I guess there is an easy workaround which I don't know?\n\nA: I'm not sure about stopping 'vagrant up' and doing an sql dump, but working upstream of this may solve your problem. Use vagrant with best practice to avoid corruption to begin with, then you should be golden (in terms of future practice). Always run 'vagrant halt' or 'vagrant suspend' prior to shutting your machine down. If you want a safeguard to ensure your vagrant boxes get suspended prior to shutdown (incase you forget to halt or suspend) follow this guide: https://www.ollegustafsson.com/en/vagrant-suspend-resume/\nTo my knowledge, once a box is corrupted, you have to destroy it and rebuild it. I've had to deal with corrupted boxes before and it is a PAIN because you lose your database(s). You can also do an sql import on a provisioned vagrant up, so that you're pulling sql from an external database.

Original BBB OS use too much space and RAM so we googled and found Snappy Ubuntu Core as a perfect solution. \nProblem is that I am new in Linux, and I find it hard to understand how snappy works, and where to start. This technology is relatively new, and I can't find tutorials, or books for absolute beginners. \nSo, I created NodeJs WebApp that runs on BBB for configuring and linking some inputs and outputs. Now I don't understand how to make snappy app of that, and run it on Snappy Ubuntu Core. I tried to write snapcraft.yaml file but I don't really understand what I need to put in the parts, or what parts really are. I just know everything can be a part :). \nSo, please can someone try to explain this to me like I'm a child, who grew up on Windows, and who knows NodeJS. I think it will be helpfull not only to me,but for many soon to be IoT developers. \nThank you\n\nA: I'm picking up the replies in the comments to the question here.\nsnapcraft has a nodejs plugin which makes bundling very easy. You can pass node-packages which are then bundled with the app, using the standard package.json file will work too.\nYou can also specify node-engine which will define the version of nodejs you want the snap to run on.\nA simple example of this can be found in the snapcraft code.

I want to look into the source code behind the command cd, but cd doesn't seem to have its own package so which package is it in?\n\nA: Find out what type a command is using the type command.\n$ type cd\ncd is a shell builtin\n$ type ls\nls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'\n$ type cat\ncat is /bin/cat\n\nYou can see, cd is a shell builtin.\nThis means, it's a part of your shell which is by default Bash. That's of course also the software package it's contained in.\nFor installed commands that are not shell builtins but executable files, use dpkg -S to find out the package:\n$ dpkg -S $(which cat)\ncoreutils: /bin/cat\n\n\nTo get help for built in commands, use the help command (which is also built in):\n$ help cd\ncd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]\n    Change the shell working directory.\n\n[... output shortened ...]\n\n\nA: The actual source code of cd is for\n\n\n*\n\n*Bash in builtins/cd.def at the end of the file\n\n*TCSH in sh.dir.c as the function dochngd\n\n*PDKSH (Public Domain Korn shell found in some BSDs) in c_ksh.c right at the top of the file\n\n*Korn 93 (Original Korn shell, old version) in src/cmd/ksh93/bltins/cd_pwd.c\nThe sys-call chdir for\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux kernel is in fs/open.c\n\n*FreeBSD is where the link at the beginning of this item points to\n\n*other BSD-type OSs and OpenSolaris work quite similar\n\n\nIt might be of note that the sys-calls are still not the end of the chain, that would be down at the individual file system level.\n\nA: Right, so as everyone has written, cd is built into whatever shell you use, because a process cannot affect the working directory of its parent. cd has a few bells and whistles tacked on (I mean pushd and friends, cd without an argument, etc.), but if you take the trouble to dig through the source you'll be underwhelmed: the main thing is that cd calls the chdir(2) system call.\nThere's not much to see because unlike, say, an environment variable like HOME, the \"working directory\" is a system primitive: It's one of the attributes that every process has, like (real) user id or scheduling priority. It is the starting point when opening files with relative paths.\n\nA: cd is necessarily a shell built-in. If the shell spawned a child process that changed the working directory and then exited, the parent process (the shell itself) would not be affected.\nAs to the source code of cd, all it needs to do is call chdir(2), which changes the working directory of the process. See chdir at opengroup.org which states:\n\nThe chdir() function shall cause the directory named by the pathname pointed to by the path argument to become the current working directory; that is, the starting point for path searches for pathnames not beginning with '/'.\n\n\nA: Here is a man page for cd but it not an official one since cd is part of the \"Shell Builtin Commands\". Just like some other commands ...\nalias, bg, bind, break, builtin, command, compgen, complete, \ncontinue, declare, dirs, disown, echo, enable, eval, exec, exit, \nexport, fc, fg, getopts, hash, help, history, jobs, kill, let, local, \nlogout, popd, printf, pushd, pwd, read, readonly, return, set, shift, \nshopt, source, suspend, test, times, trap, type, typeset, ulimit,\numask, unalias, unset, wait \n\nSee the man page for bash. From the link cd states:\n\ncd [-L|-P] [dir]\nChange the current directory to dir. The variable HOME is the default dir. The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing dir. Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:). A null directory name in CDPATH is the same as the current directory, i.e., ''.''. If dir begins with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used. The -P option says to use the physical directory structure instead of following symbolic links (see also the -P option to the set builtin command); the -L option forces symbolic links to be followed. An argument of - is equivalent to $OLDPWD. If a non-empty directory name from CDPATH is used, or if - is the first argument, and the directory change is successful, the absolute pathname of the new working directory is written to the standard output. The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.\n\n\nWhich package is the command 'cd' in?\n\nThat would be bash\n", "Q: Help to resize partition with Gparted I'm new with GParted and with linux partition in general..\nI followed this answer : How to increase swap space?\nBut my situation is a bit different and \"extend left/right\" is driving me crazy..

Setting it to \":0\" makes the script exit with\nNo protocol specified\nCannot open display.\n\n\nA: You can't for sure. You have to make assumptions.\nPretend you're cron and you're facing the worst case scenario for a second: there are multiple users logged in, and each user is running multiple X sessions.

I booted Kubuntu 15.10 and was in the process of manually organizing the partitions. I decided to abort the installation.\nAfter clicking back a few times I got a pop-up window asking me something about UEFI boot mode. I can't recall exactly what it was because I didn't pay attention to it. I didn't think it was going to change my bootloader or anything because I was clicking back in order to get to the window where you can choose Try/Install Kubuntu.\nAnyway, now my computer doesn't boot into Windows anymore. If the USB stick is plugged in, it boots Kubuntu. Otherwise, it tries to do a network boot.\nQuestion: How do I revert what Kubuntu changed (make Windows boot again)?\nEDIT 1:\nFound the pop-up. I clicked 'Go back'.\n\n\nA: A computer that came with Windows 10 almost certainly boots in EFI/UEFI mode, so the message claiming that the computer is booting in BIOS mode is highly suspect. It could be that the computer really is booting in BIOS mode (say, if you re-installed Windows yourself); but it's more likely that something is causing the Ubuntu installer to be confused. This could be related to your boot problem, in fact -- it could be that your disk is failing and returning garbage instead of good data on some critical sectors, for instance. OTOH, it sounds like you got the warning message only after you aborted the installation, which suggests it could be a false alarm caused by a bug in the installer. This is all highly speculative, though.\nUnless you passed the point where the installer actually resized partitions (when you click past the screen on which you can resize partitions), it should not have written anything to the disk. If you did click past that point, then any answer to your question depends on what you did to those partitions, and you've provided no information on that. For instance, if you deleted or created a fresh filesystem on the EFI System Partition (ESP), you would have destroyed the Windows boot loader. If you resized the ESP, you might have damaged (but perhaps not destroyed) its boot loader. In either case, a fix in Windows is appropriate, and you should ask about the situation on a Windows forum. In fact, I'd say this is the way to go unless you finished with an Ubuntu installation; without Ubuntu more-or-less fully installed on the computer, any potential Ubuntu-based solution is likely to fail.\nOne possible source of problems is the Windows Fast Startup feature, which turns shutdown operations into suspend-to-disk operations. This is extremely bad for dual-boot configurations because it leads to disk corruption on shared partitions, including the ESP. If you didn't disable this feature, then it could be that accessing the ESP from the Ubuntu installer caused disk corruption -- especially if you resized the ESP. Before you make another attempt, you should disable this feature, along with the related Hibernate feature.\n\nA: I ended up downloading Windows 10 from Microsoft. I burned the ISO onto a USB stick with Rufus and booted it by repeatedly pressing F12. I tried to save the Windows installation using the automated recovery tools but it didn't work. The original install couldn't be detected. It might've been possible to recover it with further efforts but I chose not to waste time.\nFortunately, the recovery tools allow you to modify the UEFI settings so I managed to disable UEFI and switch back to good ol' BIOS to prevent further dual-booting issues.

The OpenVPN remote address is 176.126.237.214, with port 25000. This tunnel connection changes my public IP to a IP given out by my OpenVPN server. At the moment I can't connect to my personal Ubuntu server remotely. I've already tried opening the port used by my server, 192.168.1.11, with port 8882. How can I remote SSH connect to my personal server?\n\nA: So you want to connect using your server's original (non-VPN) IP address?\nThe problem is that the default gateway gets changed by OpenVPN, and that breaks any connection coming in on the non-VPN interface. Linux will send responses to packets that came in on the real interface out the VPN interface! You need to set up appropriate routes before you start OpenVPN.\nWhat follows works for me. It uses iptables and ip (iproute2). Below, it is assumed that the default gateway interface before OpenVPN is started is \"eth0\". The idea is to ensure that when a connection to eth0 is made, even if eth0 is not the default gateway interface anymore, response packets for the connection go back on eth0 again.\nYou could use the same number for the connection mark, firewall mark and routing table. I used distinct numbers to make the diffences between them more apparent.\n# set \"connection\" mark of connection from eth0 when first packet of connection arrives\nsudo iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j CONNMARK --set-mark 1234\n\n# set \"firewall\" mark for response packets in connection with our connection mark\nsudo iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -m connmark --mark 1234 -j MARK --set-mark 4321\n\n# our routing table with eth0 as gateway interface\nsudo ip route add default dev eth0 table 3412\n\n# route packets with our firewall mark using our routing table\nsudo ip rule add fwmark 4321 table 3412\n\n===\nUPDATE:\nThe above works fine for me on Debian Jessie. But on an older Wheezy system I have just found that I need to add \"via\" to the routing table entry:\n# our routing table with eth0 as gateway interface\nsudo ip route add default dev eth0 via 12.345.67.89 table 3412\n\nThere \"12.345.67.89\" must be the original non-VPN gateway.\n", "Q: Files disappearing in Ubuntu 14.04 Intro: I have a WD My Passport Ultra hard drive.

(119 gb lvm2 pv)\n\n\nI recently bought a new ssd which I hooked into /dev/sdd, with the intent of moving all of my data and boot processes to this new disk, and eventually wiping the old one and using it as storage.\nThus I got a new linux image, threw it on an flash, booted from it, and installed linux on this new sdd drive. I ended up creating partitions:      \n\n\n*\n\n*sdd1 -  a main bootable ext4 partition (983 gb)\n\n*sdd2 - extended partition (17 gb)\n\n*sdd5 - linux swap (17 gb)\n\n\nWhen I currently boot, grub comes up on launch and asks where to boot from. I can boot from both my old sda and my new sdd just fine manually selecting from the grub menu. I think im ready to wipe out the old sda drive, but I want to ensure I have a grub install on the new one that will replace the old one.\nThough I do have a bootable install on the new sdd, I worry that maybe grub only exists on sda and I will destroy my boot.\nI am a bit uncomfortable with the types of partitions I created and have on the new sdd, and really all I want is a partition for everything ( or maybe one for boot  & one for data depending on best practices), and one for swap. I have no clue if this extended partition I already have is holding the already existing new grub, is doing anything at all, or maybe it can be used to install the new grub. Clearly sdd1 is being used to boot off and contains all of the data right now when I use boot through sdd.... just is it ready to hold its own weight after I shut off the old drive?\nReally any tips, advice or links on how to make this process easier would be appreciated. Thanks!\nPS. Where did my sdd3/4 go??? Its not like I need them, but did I do something funky while partitioning?\n\nA: It looks like your new (/dev/sdd) disk uses the old Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system, which probably means Ubuntu is installed to it in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Your original (/dev/sda) disk, OTOH, seems to use the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT) system, and it probably booted in EFI/UEFI mode. I can't be positive of that from the information you presented, though. (As a general tip, do not summarized program output; instead, cut-and-paste such output or provide screen shots. The output of sudo parted -l would remove all doubt about your partition layout.)\nIf I'm right about your partitions and boot modes, then the presence or absence of a directory called /sys/firmware/efi will tell from which installation's GRUB you're booting. If that directory is present, you've booted in EFI mode (and hence from the original installation); and if it's absent, you're in BIOS mode (and hence booted from the new installation). Given the slightly lower than 100% certainty about your partitions and boot modes, though, there will be some uncertainty about that -- maybe a 2% chance of being wrong.\nYou could also learn something by examining the /boot/grub/grub.cfg files on both your installations and comparing them to what you see when you boot the computer. That file's format is very complex, though.\nYou can get some insurance by downloading the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. It should enable you to boot either installation in EFI mode. (To boot the old installation directly from its kernel, though, you'll need to hit F2 or Insert and add a root= parameter to identify the root (/) filesystem.) If you obtain and test rEFInd on a CD-R or USB flash drive, you'll be prepared in case wiping your old disk renders the system unbootable; you should then still be able to boot the new system and make repairs.\n", "Q: How to boot ubuntu 14.04 on an Dell inspiron 15?

The screen\nflash and an error message send that there was no device to read.\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: \nI try to change some boot option but it was not working\n\nIt's important that you provide a full description of problems; \"it was not working\" provides no diagnostic details. For instance, did you see any error messages when you tried to boot? Did you see an Ubuntu logo but the system then hung? Did the computer spontaneously reboot? There are many ways for a computer to fail to boot, and a full description of the symptoms can help more experienced users figure out what's wrong. (I see you posted a brief description of a message buried at the end of your question. I'll address that later....)\n\n1- Do I have to do something after I download ubuntu 14.04 and I put it on a usb key, and before I reboot my computer? For example: to install something on the usb key?\n\nThere's no need to install anything extra; however, there are half a dozen or more programs you might use to transfer the .iso file to a USB flash drive, and they all do things a bit differently, particularly when it comes to EFI-mode booting. Broadly speaking, Rufus has the best reputation for creating EFI-compatible media, whereas Pen Drive Linux (aka YUMI and one or two other names) was worthless for this task, the last time I checked. See here for more on those and a few other tools.\n\n2- What is the best BIOS setting to boot with ubuntu: UEFI or Legacy?\n\nIf you want to dual-boot, it's almost always best to install Ubuntu in the same mode as whatever OS is already installed. For computers that came with Windows 8 or later, that's almost certainly EFI mode. If you installed (or re-installed) Windows yourself, all bets are off. Most systems that shipped with Windows 7 and earlier boot in BIOS mode, but some, particularly from late in the Windows 7 lifetime, boot in EFI mode. If you're unsure of the current boot mode, check the partition table type, as described here. Windows supports GPT only for EFI-mode boots. Although Windows can boot from MBR in EFI mode, that partition table type usually denotes a BIOS-mode installation.\nIf you want to install Ubuntu as the only OS, either boot mode will work; however, on a modern computer EFI mode offers some modest advantages like reduced boot time (usually) and access to EFI runtime variables (which enable more sophisticated communications between the OS and firmware). Note that enabling BIOS/CSM/legacy support in the firmware complicates the boot path, so you should disable that feature if you intend to use EFI-mode booting.\n\n3- Do I have to disabled the secure boot?\n\nIn theory, no. In practice, usually not; but some rare computers have EFI bugs that don't work with Ubuntu's Secure Boot support. If you have a problem, do not jump to the conclusion that it's caused by Secure Boot; based on what I've seen online, 9 times out of 10 that conclusion is wrong. The single most common problem, in my experience, is a mis-prepared USB flash drive.\n\n4- If I do all this setting and it's still not working, do you recommand an other version of ubuntu or an other way to install it? I also try to do it with a dvd and it wasn't working. The screen flash and an error message send that there was no device to read.\n\nSeeing the exact error message would be helpful. It could be that your computer is new enough that Ubuntu lacks drivers for its hard disk. In this case, a more up-to-date Ubuntu (such as 15.10, or even a 16.04 beta, rather than 14.04) may work; or switching to another distribution entirely might help. (I'm not sure what kernel the latest Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mageia, Arch, etc. use.)\nDepending on the exact phrasing of the message, it could also mean that the initial RAM disk (initrd) file was damaged, which could indicate a failing USB flash drive or a bad download.\nYet another possibility is a hardware problem such as a failing hard disk or loose cable.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Install-creating drive: cannot shrink volume beyond the point where any removable files are located I am trying to dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows 10 on my computer.

However, in Disk Management, only 4.85GB is showing up as \"available shrink space.\" Therefore, I cannot make a new drive big enough to run Ubuntu on. Is there any way of getting around this?

My FastBoot service is off and Windows is installed in UEFI mode.\n\nA: You can try creating a different partition through windows and then installing with custom installation(when you boot with the USB or CD there is an option after you press ''Install Ubuntu'' instead of install alongside Windows or delete windows). Here is a program that you can try using and a guide along with it: Safely Create Partition for Windows 10 with Free Software\n\nA: It seems that you can't use wubi with EFI enable.\nTry to disable EFI from your bios and do the followings:\nInstallation with wubi: requires to resize your NTFS windoze partition from Windoze Disk Management  to make free space and then you must create a second NTFS partition for Ubuntu, Note that wubi will install Ubuntu on the second NTFS partition and Ubuntu will be slower since NTFS is not a GNU/Linux file system, you will see the instructions just choose what you want, dual boot etc.\nInstallation without wubi with EFI enable: requires to resize your NTFS partition of windoze to make free space for Ubuntu and set your pc bios to boot from the cd now all you need to do is boot from cd and follow the instructions, is pretty straightforward, will also ask you about dual boot.\nUbuntu on Ext4 partition is much faster since is a file system for GNU/Linux.\nInstallation without wubi is the best way to go.

Your Virtual private server (VPS) does not allow this (OpenVZ (probably the most popular?), Solaris Containers and LXC are 3 examples of such systems). \nBasically there is one server that is divided up into containers of which you use one. Changing swappiness would change it for all containers so you are not allowed to change it. It is set by the provider.\nOn a side note: changing swappiness on a VPS is not going to solve any problem you believe to have. On a VPS like OpenVZ swap is the same as RAM (and I expect it to be the same on any VPS). So your problem is solved by adding RAM.\n", "Q: Drive not appearing after reboot I'm using Ubuntu desktop but it's primarily used as a server.

According to various news sources, GNOME Software is bound to replace the Ubuntu Software Center from 16.04 on.\nI am still using at least one computer that is incapable of running a newer version than 12.04 and I was wondering, what happens to the programs that were installed through the Software Center on these machines running older Ubuntu versions?\nWill the older systems receive GNOME Software through an update as well? Will the programs installed through the Ubuntu Software Center still be updated automatically in the future? Will it be dropped completely or still be running until the end of the 14.04 support cycle?\n\nA: No, they will not receive gnome-software as an update. To get gnome-software as the replacement for software-center, you will have to upgrade to at least 16.04.\nAny computer that you do not update to a version later than 12.04 only has about 13 more months of support. After that, they will receive no security updates.\nAs 14.04 is supported for 5 years, it has until sometime in April of 2019, but it will not receive any new features in software-center either.\nAnd yes, any packages you have installed, will automatically be updated, if any updates are released for them, to the version of Ubuntu you are running.\n", "Q: Juju on Maas, Lxc container not deploying I have the latest juju deployed on maas.\nI also deployed the gui with: juju deploy juju-gui --to 0\nThis seem to work fine.\nBut when I deploy an lxc container on that machine the conatiner stays in pending mode for ever...\n  0/lxc/4:\n    agent-state: pending\n    instance-id: pending\n    series: trusty\n\nWhen I log into the maas machine where Juju agent was installed.

Depending on your connection, it can take a while.\nAfter that, if new containers of the same ubuntu series are created in that environment, a cloning process is used and that's much faster than downloading an image. That's why it was fast.\nIf you destroy that juju environment, then again, the first time a container is used, that image will be downloaded.\nThis is not cached in MAAS's proxy server, because it's a https (SSL) download.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 Wacom Intuos Draw not workig, any help?

I want this space to be added to my root partition sda11. How can I do that? I read few posts related to this but some of them suggest to use live usb and in some posts they asked only to add this command sudo resize2fs /dev/sda11. I don't know which procedure to follow. I tried to run the above command but I get this message The filesystem is already 5594368 blocks long.  Nothing to do!.\nAlso some posts suggested to move up or down my sda11 and then run the command but I don't know how to move sda11 up or down. \nSo for now I have read and tried above things. And I still don't know ho to increase/merge my root(sda11) and 19.34gb space(sda7). Please help. \nNote: I am using dual boot and gparted.\n\nA: First thing to do is back up any important information. \nAs explained in an answer HERE, you can't modify the systems's partitions (and parent extended partitons, like /dev/sda11) when the system is using them - so you need to modify the partitions from outside the system - the Ubuntu install disk should do for that. So first you need to boot from the disk, and open GParted.\n\nNote about Gparted: Once you initiate a task, you must click the green check mark to execute the task. You should only do one of these tasks at a time for this session. \nNow that you are booted up in a LIVE USB and using Gparted, you can navigate to the (sda7) and delete this partition, making sure that you back up any data on that partition first. This will leave a grey area that says UNALLOCATED. \nNet you will need make sure that this empty space is right next to your root partition (sda11) on the RIGHT of the home partition. If there is a small partition called SWAP in between (or any other partition in bewtween) it will need to be moved to the right of the grey unallocated space. \nNote - Do not move your home partition, or you will need to fix your BOOT partition. \nNow that the home partition and the unallocated space are contiguous, you should be able to resize the home partition (sda11) by clicking on on it, then clicking resize, then by dragging the right edge of the rectangle in the pop up menu. After you tell GParted you want those operations to be done, you have to tell it to apply them (click the green check mark). It may take a while, but it should work without problems.\n\nAfter this reboot into your normal install of Ubuntu (not the live disk), and check the partitions again with Gparted to ensure everything went as planned.  \nNOTE: Normally things go smoothly i.e without any problem but sometime they don't and therefore it is important that you backup your data before making any changes to your hardisk. Its better to be safe than sorry!\n", "Q: How to manually install wpasupplicant 2.1? I'm trying to install wpasupplicant 2.1 because I'm having some problems with 2.4 .

I am new to the Linux world, and I have been using Windows and writing Visual C++ for the past year or so. I find that bash seems to be the most popular shell in the Linux world. Is there a Linux CLI shell that would be the closest to bash capabilities but with C/C++ types syntax? \n\nA: There's CSH which fits the bill.\nFrom Wikipedia \n\nThe C shell (csh or the improved version, tcsh, on most machines) is a\n  Unix shell that was created by Bill Joy while he was a graduate\n  student at University of California, Berkeley in the late 1970s. It\n  has been distributed widely, beginning with the 2BSD release of the\n  BSD Unix system that Joy began distributing in 1978.2 Other early\n  contributors to the ideas or the code were Michael Ubell, Eric Allman,\n  Mike O'Brien and Jim Kulp.\n\nMan page\nOr you could try TCSH (Thanks! @muru)\nFrom Wikipedia\n\ntcsh (/ˌtiːˈsiːʃɛl/ \"tee-cee-shell\", /ˈtiːʃɛl/ \"tee-shell\", or as an\n  acronym \"tee cee ess aitch\") is a Unix shell based on and compatible\n  with the C shell (csh). It is essentially the C shell with\n  programmable command-line completion, command-line editing, and a few\n  other features. Unlike the other common shells, functions cannot be\n  defined in a tcsh script and the user must use aliases instead (as in\n  csh).\n\nNote that these shells are not as widely used as bash and hence some makefiles and shell scripts may behave unpredictably.\nMan page\n\nA: Bash supports some C-style syntax. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Function declarations / definitions are sintactically similar to function declarations / definitions in C, except you dont't define neither parameters (which are fetched using the positional parameters $1, $2, $3, ...) nor return types (Bash doesn't use types at all):\nfoo() {\n    # ...\n}\n\nOr again similarily to C using an inline declaration / definition:\nfoo() { #...; }\n\nTo be noted that when using an inline declaration / definition the first and last statement must be space-separated from { and } respectively and that (again similarily to C) every statement must be semicolon-separated from the others and that the final statement must end with a semi-colon:\nfoo() { command1; command2; command3; }\n\nFor completeness, an alternative way of declaring / defining function is using the keyword function, which doesn't need the () after the function's name:\nfunction foo {\n    #...\n}\n\n\n*You can evaluate C-style expression by enclosing them in double parenthesis (()): quite a number of C-style operators are supported, (including assignment), e.g.: =, >, >=, ==, !=, <, <=, &&, ||, !, among others:\n$ i=0\n$ j=1\n$ ((i > j)) && echo True\n$ ((i >= j)) && echo True\n$ ((i == j)) && echo True\n$ ((i != j)) && echo True\nTrue\n$ ((i < j)) && echo True\nTrue\n$ ((i <= j)) && echo True\nTrue\n$ ((i && j)) && echo True\n$ ((i || j)) && echo True\nTrue\n$ ((\\! i)) && echo True\nTrue\n$ ((\\! j)) && echo True\n$ ((i = j))\n$ echo $i\n1\n$ echo $j\n1\n\nThis way of evaluating C-style expressions can be used in conjunction with if, while and until statements:\nif((i == 0)); then\n    # ...\ndone\n\nwhile((i == 0)); do\n    # ...\ndone\n\nuntil((i == 0)); do\n    # ...\ndone\n\nMost notably, (()) also allows to write C-style for loop conditions:\nfor((i = 0; i < 3; i++)); do\n    # ...\ndone\n\n\n*C-style expressions evaluation doesn't support assigning the result of the evaluation; for that you can use arithmetic expansion ($(())), which allows for some sort of C-style expressions assignment:\n$ i=0\n$ j=1\n$ k=$((i > j))\n$ echo $k\n0\n$ k=$((i < j))\n$ echo $k\n1\n$ x=$((1 + 2 + 3))\n$ echo $x\n6\n\n\n*C-style prefixed / postfixed increment / decrement operators are also supported:\n++i\ni++\n--i\ni--\n\n", "Q: How to Reinstall or Remove Wacom Drivers I'm a new user banging my head against the wall trying to get my Wacom tablets to work on Kubuntu 14.04. I have two tablets: a bigger, older Intuos 2, and a smaller, much newer Intuos Pen Small. I tried following all the guides I could find on here and the Wacom Linux Project wiki, but I couldn't get my Intuos 2 to work at all.\nAfter a while, I decided to see if my Intuos Pen Small would work out of the box, as some other forum goers have mentioned. When I plug it in, I immediately get cursor functionality, however I can't change any settings. In the Graphic Tablet - KDE Control Module window, I get an error saying \"Graphic Tablet Error: Profile Default Does Not Exist\". If I try to make a new profile, it gives me the same error, replacing the above \"Default\" with whatever I tried to name it.\nI'm thinking maybe, somewhere on the long winding path I took trying to get my old Intuos 2 working, I messed something up.

This is convenient, rather than using direct path as /home/USERNAME.\nWait or kill\nWhen timeout has reached the duration, the specified command i.e. Screenshooter will be terminated, regardless of screenshot has been taken and saved or otherwise. The command doesn't require a separate shortcut to exit the application. Wait for specified duration to exit on its own.\nIf the specified duration is quite long to wait, user can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the timeout duration from 15 to smaller value in seconds\n\n*Exit immediately by using the shortcut keys for killall xfce4-screenshooter as suggested by @linuxode\nThe latter seems to be an easier workaround, rather than changing the timeout duration that depends on time taken by user to select a region and saving the screenshot with different name, if any. This is why I had suggested 15 seconds and not lesser than that.\nEven better, set optimal duration (neither too short nor too long for user to wait) and use both of the workarounds that will allow user to either \"wait or kill\", to exit Screenshooter in Xfce.\nDisclaimer: This answer suggests a workaround, not a definite solution. The best answer would be to use Esc key that is supposed to work properly with Screenshooter in Xfce. I'm unsure if the said issue is still occurring in Xfce newer than 4.10 or else.\n\nA: The command to do this (or for any unresponsive app) is killall <application name> So, in your case it will be killall xfce4-screenshooter How do you do this?  Set up a keyboard shortcut for this command. Whenever you accidentally press the keyboard combination for xfce4-screenshooter -r, simply press Escape or the shortcut you created for killall xfce4-screenshooter.

I probably have about 100 or so IPs/domains that I am dropping.\nMy problem is that when I drop a new ip like x.x.x.x, it adds it as follows:\n-A INPUT -i br0 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -s x.x.x.x/32 -j DROP\n-A FORWARD -i br0 -j ACCEPT\n\nThis somehow then isnt actually dropping the ip address like I want it to. I have a shell script that I use to drop users/domains:\n./drop-user\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -s $1 -j DROP\nsudo sh -c \"iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\" \n\n./drop-domain\n sudo iptables -A INPUT -s $1/16 -j DROP\n sudo sh -c \"iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\"\n\nTo combat this problem I am manually editing the /etc/iptables.rules files to move the x.x.x.x ip above this line:\n -A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 22 -j f2b-sshd-ddos\n\nand then calling:\nsudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules\n\nWhat is wrong with my process if anything? Is there a better way? Each day I spent about 10 mins dealing with hacks and most of that time is doing the editing of my iptables.rules files and then restoring it via iptables-restore. I would like to be able to just call ./drop-user or ./drop-domain and be done with it but I feel that I don't have enough of an understanding of iptables.\nShould I be doing the following commands before the iptables-restore?\n sudo iptables -F\n sudo iptables -Z\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I would strongly urge you to automate the banning process with fail2ban, which works perfectly well in a default configuration and can be customized further if you want it to monitor more services.\nWhen combined with iptables-persistent, it will preserve rules across reboots which is helpful.\nHere is a basic overview of what I do with any Ubuntu server:\nInstall and configure fail2ban\nsudo aptitude install fail2ban && sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local && sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n\nThis installs it and copies the configuration file to a new file for your customizations. This is best practice because it prevents your edits from being overwritten if the package is updated.\nMy personal preference is to extend the ban time and find time from the defaults. Ban time is how long an attacker is banned for, and find time is the window of time their attempts are counted, in case they rate limit attacks. Find and edit bantime = 21600 (increased to six hours, time value is in seconds) and also findtime = 3600 (max 3 attack attempts per hour).\nFlush existing Iptables rules and set new defaults\nThis is a one-liner that is meant to be used on a typical web server with inbound ports listening on port 22 (SSH) port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS) only. This DigitalOcean tutorial is a good reference for how to build your own or customize mine. Be careful with Iptables and setting DROP rules, if you get the order wrong you will permanently lock yourself out! That said, this one-liner is what I use and it is safe, tested, and working perfectly:\nsudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT && sudo iptables -F && sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT && sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT && sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT && sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT && sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT && sudo iptables -A INPUT -j LOG && sudo iptables -A FORWARD -j LOG && sudo ip6tables -A INPUT -j LOG && sudo ip6tables -A FORWARD -j LOG && sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP\n\nMake changes persistent across reboots\nLast step is to install and configure the iptables-persistent package, which will automate saving and restoring rules across reboots.\nsudo aptitude install iptables-persistent && sudo service iptables-persistent start\n\nIt will prompt you for confirmation for IPV4 and IPV6 rules, and you should use the tab key to select 'yes' for each and save. It will start automatically when rebooting so you don't need to worry about configuring it further.\nOne thing to note about making the rules persistent is that you need to manually tell the process about any new rules you add or edit (like if you added or removed HTTPS on port 443 for example). To do this, run sudo service iptables-persistent save which will update the current set of rules in place. I think the command was changed to \"netfilter-persistent\" in versions later than 14.04 so use sudo service netfilter-persistent save if the first one does not work.\nSummary\nNow fail2ban will monitor attacks on SSH and add and subtract IP addresses automatically according to the parameters you set. Iptables will ignore all incoming traffic for ports you haven't opened and these rules will persist across reboots, so there isn't much else you need to do. Enjoy the extra free time I guess!\nReversing all the above steps if you wish to undo all changes\nIf for some reason you don't want to continue using this method, you can undo everything quickly. This is not recommended but it's your machine so here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flush all Iptables rules and accept all traffic on all ports sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT && sudo iptables -F (you must do this to remove the DROP rule at the end or you will be locked out)\n\n*Remove the previously installed packages and their settings sudo aptitude purge fail2ban iptables-persistent (or maybe netfilter-persistent, depending on your version of Ubuntu server).\nAfter a restart, you should be back to the way you were before - minus any custom Iptables settings which you will need to manually re-add like you are currently doing.\n\n", "Q: Problems with hostmane: unrecognized service Already more than a month as I uninstalled Windows and I use Ubuntu 14 now.\nBut now I have little problem, but could not solve it alone.\nI can not configure the sendmail\nBefore sendmail confuguration I need to configure hostname\nI tried using command \nRMK:~$ sudo hostname localhost\n\nand I get bad response\nsudo: unable to resolve host localhost\n\non the way ls /etc/init.d   file hostname.sh  is missing \ncommand sudo service hostname\nhostname responds me: unrecognized service\nin / etc / hosts I have is\n127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost\n127.0.0.1 RMK\n\nin / etc / hostname \nlocalhost\nRMK\n\nPlese help me in my problem\n\nA: Each line in hosts should carry a unique IP.

I'm using pyrenamer with my photo collection and it works great except for one issue. I want it to rename photos by their date taken metadata, with a three-digit number at the end. Each folder in my library represents a day, and I want the photos ending in numbers from 001-999, starting with 001 for each folder. An example file name would be 2016-01-31-001.jpg.\nShotwell handles creating the directory structure on import with a %Y/%m/%d structure in the options, but when I use pyrenamer recursively in the ~/Pictures directory, I don't see the expected outcome. It renames by date but continues incrementing up across folders, instead of starting at 001 for each new folder. Is there an easier way to go about this?\nI know I could add more metadata variables and rename according to hours, minutes, and seconds, but this gives longer file names than I want. My camera also can take multiple shots per second so this is problematic for renaming.\nWhat's the easiest way to do this please?

This is critical to preserve the image numbering within a day in the original chronological order.\n\n*-recurse recursively processes subdirectories, which is helpful if you use Shotwell to import because photos are placed in directories organized by date.\n\n*-extension jpg -extension jpeg will make sure only JPEG files are processed. (Note these aren't case-specific and jpg=JPG so we catch everything)\n\n*-ignoreMinorErrors Ignore any errors which don't affect our desired result (usually problems reading unrelated tags which aren't necessary for this operation).\n\n*'-FileName<CreateDate' Puts the photo created date in the file name.\n\n*-d %Y-%m-%d%%-.3nc.%%e Here -d sets the desired output date format. We'll use hyphenated four-digit year then two-digit month and day (%Y-%m-%d) followed by a three-digit number starting with 001 (%%-.3nc), preserving the original file extension (.%%e).\n\n*~/Pictures/ is the last item, it's just the directory that exiftool should process with the command.\n\n\nA note about errors, the -ignoreMinorErrors helps but still you may see the message \"Warning: Bad PreviewIFD directory\" which is safe to ignore or \"Warning: No writable tags set from /path/to/problem/image.jpg\".

Then I setup EXT+LUKS partition for the whole 32 GB of space, but I immediately get this error dialog when proceeding:\nError creating partition\n\nError wiping newly created partition /dev/sdf1: Command-line `wipefs -a\n\"/dev/sdf1\"' exited with non-zero exit status 1: wipefs: error:\n/dev/sdf1: probing initialization failed: No such file or directory\n(udisks-error-quark, 0)\n\nI was trying to follow these instructions:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/115955/how-to-quickly-encrypt-removable-storage-devices-with-ubuntu/\nAny idea what's wrong here?\n\nA: I've never used gnome-disks to do that, the guide you linked to is from 2012 & has screenshots of the \"old\" Disks UI (better IMO) but it's not my first choice for these tasks (it is awesome for info & basic mount/umount, unlock/lock LUKS devices).\nBut I have successfully used Gparted (or just parted) to clear / create a partition (/dev/sdf1 in your example) and then in a terminal:\ncryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdf1\n\nand open it with one of these (\"old syntax\" is listed first, less typing)\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdf1 cryptname\ncryptsetup open --type luks /dev/sdf1 cryptname\n\nand then format it with\nmkfs.ext<2,3,4> /dev/mapper/cryptname\n\nthen mount & use it\nmount /dev/mapper/cryptname\n\nThat's if there's not a hardware error on the drive that's causing the wipefs problem. If you can create (or already have) the partition, then LUKS should overwrite everything anyway (or a dd with /dev/zero after it's luksOpen-ed). I'd try not using gnome-disks first - fewer things to go wrong.\n\nFound a confirmed bug report about the error (Erasing disk failed: Error wiping newly created partition) reproducible using Gnome Disks too. Apparently:\n\nSeems like udisks is trying to act on a device before the device node appears. The affected code seems to live in src/udiskslinuxpartitiontable.c, that pretends to \"sit and wait for the partition to show up\" before wiping the newly created partition, but apparently doesn't reliably wait for the device node to appear in /dev.\n\nWith a comment for a workaround using dd to erase the first MB (MiB) of a partition:\n\nsudodus (nio-wiklund) wrote on 2015-09-18:     #3\nMy tip for a solution is independent of waiting for udisks to be fixed:\n\n*\n\n*Wipe the first megabyte (actually mibibyte) *\n\nWhen the target drive is identified and selected (so that there can be no mistake), simply wipe the first mibibyte (use dd under the hood to overwrite it with zeros). This has worked well for me and people I have helped at the Ubuntu Forums. It is part of mkusb and I have used and recommended the method for years. mkusb from ppa:mkusb/unstable has a menu with several alternatives, where the first one (standard) will create pendrives, that work with for example the s-d-c and Unetbootin.\n\nThe workaround should be equivalent to your just using cryptsetup on the partition once it's created, since it shouldn't care if there's an existing filesystem there anyway and warns that it will overwrite any existing data.\n", "Q: How can I restart Unity if it hangs On my Ubuntu 15.10 PC, Unity sometimes hangs.

Immediately the system froze (mouse stopped, time stopped, music skipped).\nI tried mounting it with Disk Image Mounter and from the terminal (sudo mount -o loop file.iso /mnt/file) and both brought the system to a screeching halt. VirtualBox was able to mount the image with no problem, but that doesn't help using it outside of VirtualBox.\nThe ISO image was a HFS formated mac install disk... I also tried mounting the original Ubuntu install ISO Image and had the same problem (immediate freezing).\nI'm running a nearly fresh install of 15.10 Desktop, except that I've been  playing with KVM. I haven't made any major changes to anything yet.\nHow can I see what is causing the freeze? Is there a specific log? I don't see any similar problems on here or google.\nEdit: This is the error from Virtual Machine Manager (mac.iso is owned by my user with permissions set to 777)\n\nError starting domain: internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: 2016-03-13T02:55:19.906457Z qemu-system-x86_64: -drive id=MacDVD,if=none,snapshot=on,file=/home/user/Downloads/mac.iso: Could not open '/home/user/Downloads/mac.iso': Permission denied\n\n\nA: I've also run into my system hard freezing when mounting ISO disk images on Ubuntu 15.10. I've also been using KVM, but it's not relevant in my case.\nUnfortunately I couldn't find any particular log file that explained the freeze, but I did notice that ISOs that were in certain folders (encrypted via LUKS) didn't have the problem, yet all those in normal ZFS datasets did. I traced my issue to the version of ZFS (0.6.4.2) in Ubuntu 15.10 having a bug that causes ISO mounts to lock up the system.\nAfter upgrading ZFS to 0.6.5.7 (via the zfs-native PPA) I no longer have this problem.\nYou don't mention use of ZFS in your question, but this answer may help those with similar issues to determine if it's due to this known bug.\n", "Q: My Android phone doesn't mount on Lubuntu 15.10 Issue:\nI'm using Lubuntu 15.10 Wily i386 and unable to now mount my Android phone via MTP.

While creating the bootable drive went just fine , but  booting from it didn't: \nSo, I searched for a way to install Ubuntu without a cd/usb drive, and found this (first answer).  \nThat worked, and I chose \"Try Ubuntu\", to see if everything was working. It was, so I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 10. I had previously set up 100 GB of unallocated space, because I was told Ubuntu would format it and use it.  \nAfter the installation was done I rebooted, but there wasn't a boot option for Ubuntu. The only options were Windows 10 and Unetbootin, the same as before I installed Ubuntu. \nI checked if Unetbootin would maybe just boot straight to the freshly installed Ubuntu, but I was just presented with the same options as before (\"install ubuntu\" and \"try without installing\").  \nSo I booted Windows, to see if Ubuntu had taken up the previously unallocated space of 100 GB.  The stuff I marked with red was previously 100 GB of unallocated space. Now it's 2 partitions that I can't access with Windows, so Ubuntu must be installed on there, right?  \nIf I'm not wrong, that means Ubuntu is actually installed, I just can't boot to it for some reason. I have been looking through the boot options on my motherboard, but can't find an option to boot to ubuntu. But I found out that my printer is listed as a boot option lol.\nAlso: for some reason Windows Defender has  now blocked me from using Unetbootin.exe... No idea why\nIf you know what I need to do in order to solve this mess it would be much appreciated!\n\nA: Check your BIOS or UEFI settings. Sometimes a UEFI is out of date and needs to be updated. Or you could use the legacy BIOS setting. The problem is somewhere in your BIOS or UEFI settings. \nSee the other post on this similar issue Dual boot Ubuntu (14.04) with Windows 10\n\nA: For windows defender: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-windows-defender-on-off#turn-windows-defender-on-off=windows-7\nYou will also need to search for UEFI and enable boot from usb as your default boot drive.\nI gather unetbootin is an alternative to grub.  Maybe you could install the iso from a usb stick(drive, or whatever) after you make changes to your UEFI (successor to the BIOS).

I have just installed Linux Ubuntu 14.04.4 alongside a fresh install of  windows 10. I have checked the checksum of my ISO and that the Ubuntu USB contained no errors. But I am not able to update Ubuntu, nor use Linux for browsing for example. I continuously have (for me unexpected and random) freezes that eventually lead to a black screen. It seems that doing sudo apt-get update, just after a booting up the system, leads to freezes within a few seconds. But there are no errors messages visible and doing the apt-get update does not stop at the same package every time.\nIs there any log that I could take a look at to shine some light on the problem or any other things to try? I am new to Ubuntu, so all suggestions are welcome.\nEDIT: I have taken a look at the logs in /var/logs, but it I can not find any errors in here. It seems that the system just freezes for no apparent reason. (the other OS is working fine) \nEDIT: I am using a 148f:7601 Ralink Technology, Corp. chipset for my WiFi USB adapter and have no Ethernet connection. I think the issue is related, because the machine only freeze's when I try to browse the web, do a apt-get update, or try a new install of Ubuntu with updates on the fly. Also when I try to update and open Software via the menu, it freezes only if I am connected to WiFi.\nBest wishes,\nBen\n\nA: The logs should be in /var/log/apt/\nOpen a terminal and see what logs are there.\nls -la /var/log/apt/\n\nI have a history.log file and a term.log file.

Maybe take a look at dmesg, syslog too.\ncat /var/log/dmesg\ncat /var/log/syslog\n\nIf you want to watch a log file \"live\", while your system is running, you can run it through tail and log updates will output to the terminal on the fly.\ntail -f /var/log/dmesg\n\nIf you are using tail or less, you exit the command with Ctrl+C.\n\nA: I had this issue on one of my laptops awhile back with limited space.  The logging directory is in /var/log/apt/ .  If is possible that you are filling the temporary space up or maxing out your memory.   Try and do an sudo apt-get clean and just try again.  If it continues I would do a sudo df -h and check the tmpfs to make sure you have some space available.\n\nA: Seems that the wireless USB adapter was the problem The WiFi USB adapter was recognized and worked somewhat, I was able to make some connection to WiFi, but this always resulted in freezing the whole system without any errors messages. \nWith another WiFi USB adapter that works properly out of the box with Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS (ethernet was not available for me), I was able to install the USB WiFI adapter (with a 148f:7601 Ralink Technology, Corp. chipset) by following the directions found on this previously asked question (http ://askubuntu.com/questions/457061/ralink-148f7601-wifi-adapter-installation).

Now after crssh on reinstalling only offers reserved BIOS area for grub but then won't boot - no drive shows\n\nA: The choice of BIOS-mode or EFI-mode installation is made by the way the installation medium is booted -- Ubuntu will install in BIOS mode if you boot the installer in BIOS mode and in EFI mode if you boot the installer in EFI mode. You can launch the installer by opening a terminal and typing ubiquity -b to install without a boot loader, but otherwise you really have no choice in the matter.\nThus, to control the installation mode, you must control the boot mode by using your firmware's tools. If you want to force an EFI-mode install, the best way is to disable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM; aka \"legacy boot support\" or a similar term) in your firmware setup utility. How this is done varies greatly from one computer to another, so I can't provide details. In some cases, you can force, or at least encourage, an EFI-mode boot even with the CSM enabled by using the computer's built-in boot manager. This tool will often provide two options for booting an external medium, one with the string \"UEFI\" and one without it. Selecting the \"UEFI\" option boots in EFI mode and the other option boots in BIOS mode. This isn't always 100% reliable, though.\nAlso, be sure your boot medium is prepared correctly. There must be at least half a dozen tools you can use to prepare a bootable USB drive from a .iso file, and some of them omit the EFI boot loader or otherwise prepare the USB drive in a way that will cause problems for at least some EFIs. Thus, if you can't seem to get a particular USB drive to boot in EFI mode, you may need to try another tool, or at least try other options within the tool you're using.\n", "Q: Dual boot : Ubuntu detects Windows Boot Manager instead of Windows 7 I am installing Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS alongside Windows 7.\nHowewer, during installation it detects Windows Boot Manager instead of Windows 7 so I have an option : Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager.\nIs it a problem or it is safe to proceed?\nThank you very much for help! \nMy partition table\n\nA: Yup, it's perfectly safe.

Hello i am trying to set magic lamp effect for minimizing the windows with compizconfig and it doesnt do it no matter how many times i've tried! Am i doing something wrong or just gnome doesnt support it?\n\nA: Gnome does not support such desktop effects. If you are looking for a Linux OS with those desktop effects, go for Kubuntu, it contains the KDE Plasma 5 desktop, and it supports/contains those features you seek. \n", "Q: Can Ubuntu create another partition when is installing? I only have one partition created and i was thinking, if i wanna have Ubuntu and Windows, can Ubuntu create another partition for itself in the process of installing?\n\nA: Yes, it can, and has to. Since Windows doesn't support creating an ext4 partition, the installer has to do that itself.   \nThere are a few ways to create a partition during the install process. The easiest way is to just run the installer and tell it to \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\"\nIf that option doesn't show up, or you want more control, choose to \"Try Ubuntu\" when booting from the install media. You can then open Gparted and manually resize your Windows partition to create space for Ubuntu.\nOnce you finish the partitioning, hit the \"Apply\" button and open the installer when Gparted is finished processing. In the installer, choose the \"Something Else...\" option and choose to mount the newly created ext4 partition as / to Install to it.\nSorry for the somewhat abbreviated instructions. I'm doing this all from my phone.\n\nA: Yes. My experience is limited to Windows 7.  I Installed Windows 7 first, intentionally wiping the entire drive in the process.  After that, I installed Ubuntu, choosing the \"Install alongside Windows 7\" which is the first option.  From there, the installer let me choose how much disk space to allocate to each OS.  \nAfter installing Ubuntu, there were some minor issues the first time I booted Windows 7 but these were fixed automatically and I have had no problems booting either OS.  From everything I've seen on this board, Windows 8 and higher have serious with dual-boot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't boot because of lvmetad I've followed this tutorial to install Ubuntu 15.10:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180530122126/http://thesimplecomputer.info/full-disk-encryption-with-ubuntu\nAfter restarting my computer I got to the grub menu and chose Ubuntu.

It had run for a couple of months unattended, but when I returned I found the keyboard unrecognized.  When I rebooted, I got the 'cannot connect to lvmetad' message and more about more about not being able to get \"UEFI db list\".\nI had installed without disk encryption.\nThe UEFI message was worrisome because this was my first install on a UEFI computer, so I had no experience, and am frankly still uninformed about the usefulness.  My problem was compounded by the fact that I had made used 'lvm' on what was going to be my '/', root, volume. (In fact, I've already forgotten how I accomplished THAT in the first place! Hey. I'm old.)\nHowever, when the machine would not reboot, I searched for a solution and found nothing definitive, but did notice that a) my EFI partition was smaller than the 500MB recommended on one site, and b) the separate /boot/ partition I had arranged for was probably irrelevant and unused.  I thought it possible that an unattended upgrade, perhaps, had caused something, possibly, to fill up its allotted space.\nI decided to reinstall--which worked, and left my /home/ directory structure unmolested.  I haven't checked /etc/, but did make copies of both of them beforehand[1], so I can check later. /etc/ is really small. \nI also deleted deleted and combined the partitions for EFI and /boot/ into a single, larger EFI partition (>750MB).\nIt reboots now, but a single error message flashes too fast to read, and I am not offered a boot 'menu' of Linux images to boot, it boots directly into Ubuntu instead. There is still more work to do, with grub I suppose, to address this. But at least my files are back.\n[1] I booted the Ubuntu installation from a USB stick, and chose to \"try\" Ubuntu, which allowed me to make copies of etc and home, before choosing \"Install\" from the desktop.\n\nA: I've encountered this problem after playing with my Intel drivers on my laptop. I used a third-party PPA to install the drivers and that went wrong, since I only had one graphics card, the integrated one, I couldn't boot.\nTo solve the issue I've booted in recovery mode, removed the third party PPA and reinstalled the drivers.\nsudo dpkg  --purge --force-all libgl1-mesa-dri\nsudo dpkg  --purge --force-all libgl1-mesa\nsudo dpkg  --purge --force-all libgl1-mesa-glx:i386\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-video-intel libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\n\nTo boot in recovery mode I used grub.\n\nA: I've seen the same error today on a laptop running Ubuntu 15.10 which I always kept up-to-date but had not rebooted for a month until I wanted to test a current kernel (i.e., there might have been a recent change).\nAnyways, I found that in my case the underlying cause was actually a \"missing\" swap partition due to a setup glitch when following the above tutorial. If this is the case and/or you're actually using lvm, you might be able to skip step 2 below.\nOf course, you might also see the above error message in case your system (or a secondary data) partition has been damaged or cannot be found (see step 3).\nStep 1: Mount your system, boot partitions following the aformentioned tutorial\nLet's say your (ext2) boot partition is /dev/sdX1, your (encrypted) swap partition is /dev/sdX2, your (encrypted) data partition is /dev/sdX3 and you've successfully decrypted the latter using cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdX3 data, followed by mounting it: mkdir /tmp/data; mount /dev/mapper/data /tmp/data.\nPay attention to the bind mounts in the tutorial and make sure to mount /dev/sdX1 so that you can access it from your system partition's /boot directory (this is crucial as we have to execute update-initramfs).\nIn the following, we're assuming you've sucessfully executed chroot /tmp/data/@ubuntu1510 (or whatever your mounted system partition is called)\nStep 2: Get rid of the above error message\nI'm using btrfs (as you might have guessed from the mentioned subvolume name), so lvmetad can easily be disabled as follows without loss of functionality:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit /etc/lvm/lvm.conf and change use_lvmetad=1 to use_lvmetad=0\n\n*execute update-initramfs -k $(uname -r) -u ; sync\nNow, you could reboot and the error message should be gone. However, in my case, the next error message[1] pointed me to the underlying problem mentioned above, so while we're at it, ...\nStep 3: Make sure that /etc/crypttab points to the correct, undamaged partitions\nFirst, run sfdisk --list /dev/sdX and check that your encrypted swap partition (in my case, /dev/sdX2) actually does not show up as a (normal) swap partition. If it did (as in my case), this meant that booting, e.g., using a rescue disk will likely make use of that available swap partition, thereby overwriting your cryptsetup related metadata (keyphrase and UUID).\nNext, have a look at /dev/disk/by-uuid and compare the respective UUIDs of your encrypted partitions with those contained in /etc/crypttab. My guess at this point: In your case, there's a mismatch.\nIf the dedicated encrypted swap partition is nowhere to be found below /dev/disk/by-uuid, that's because it's currently in use by your rescue system. In that case, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure to stop using the partition: swapoff -a\n\n*reformat it: mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdX2 (this is crucial, especially when using GPT partitions[2], as it undoes the glitch I mentioned earlier. The likely cause of the partition showing up as type \"swap\" in the sfdisk listing is that you/I mistakenly used mkswap /dev/sdX2 when setting up the partition in the beginning.) \n\n*follow the tutorial to encrypt the partition and set a passphrase; afterwards, open it using cryptsetup and properly reformat the now-decrypted partition (using something like mkswap /dev/mapper/swap) \n\n*ensure that sfdisk --list /dev/sdX will not identify the swap partition as such (in that case, repeat the last steps)\n\n\nNow, recheck that the UUIDs listed in /etc/crypttab are in line which what you see below /dev/disk/by-uuid for your respective encrypted partitions.\nAgain, to make the changes permanent, you must execute update-initramfs as shown above.\nIf you're satisfied, make sure everything is written to disk and reboot the system (no need to unmount everything manually). Afterwards, your problem should be gone. \n[1] maybe I did not pay attention the first time or the first error message \"masked\" the second one; i.e., only after rebooting (with use_lvmetad=0), I was presented with \"Reading all physical volumes. This may take a while...\" (repeated multiple times), followed by \"ALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/... does not exist.\". (It should be noted that update-initramfs also complained about a missing partition.)\n[2] because their type is deducted from analysing their contents and not ultimately specified by a flag/byte (that's why there's no easy way to, e.g., change the GPT file system type using [g]parted.)\n\nA: It's not necessary boot your system from a USB or something else. I had the same problem and a reason - because the disk is 100% full. Next solution helped me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your system. With BIOS, quickly press and hold the Shift key, which will bring up the GNU GRUB menu. \n\n*After press 'e' to edit Ubuntu settings. In this problem you can find screens. Find a string starting like 'linux *', like this:\nlinux     /boot/vmlinuz-4-4.0-22-generic root=UUID=43ad24d3-e\\\nc5b-44ee-a099-a88eb9520989 ro  quiet splash $vt_handoff\n\nDelete: \nro  quiet splash $vt_handoff\n\nAnd add:\ninit=/bin/bash\n\nOnce ready press Ctrl+x or F10 to boot.\n\n*The root partition is mounted read-only. To mount it read/write, enter the command\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\n\n*Find out what is went wrong:\ndf -hT\n\n", "Q: Are there any good antivirus for Kubuntu/Ubuntu as of 2015? OK, I do have to admit I am somewhat new to Linux,(I'm used to Windows), and that's why I'm asking all of these questions about Kubuntu. \nAs of 2015, are there any good, FREE anti-virus programs for Linux, specifically Kubuntu/Ubuntu 15.10? Yes, I have checked for other questions similar to mine, but they are all from a long time ago. And yes, a lot of people say that Linux does not need an anti-virus. \nBut, I'm really more comfortable to have an anti-virus program, just in case. I will appreciate any suggestions.\nThanks.\n\nA: None whatsoever. Yes there are virusses but not a single virus has left the laboratory. Let alone that there is one that can copy itself to thousands of other machines like a virus does on Windows.\n99% (I'll leave me 1% wiggle room :) ) of their claims of finding virusses in a Linux operating system are false positives. Only virus software sellers will tell you you need one for Linux/Ubuntu. The only reason for a virus scanner on Linux is to protect Windows machines in your network. It is better to scan for Windows virusses from a none-Windows machine than from a Windows machine. Linux virus scanners can scan mails or downloads and prevent them from even reaching a Windows desktop.\nThere are currently only virusses to target ONE operating system at a time and the person that wants to infect his own system needs to go out of his way to get it installed. Like actually downloading the virus, execute the installer and run the virus. \nThe main Ubuntu repositories are virus free. The Personal Archives on Launchpad (or PPA's) are virus free. The main other software you could download like apache, mysql are all virus free. \nAnd all other software you can install is your own stupid problem if they have a virus and you did not check the integrity of the download, the person who created it or the website. Besides that: If someone was to create such software it the 1st person infected would post it on-line, twitter would explode on it. Same for all those Linux blogs.\n\nIf you stick to the regular repositories, launchpad PPA's and the websites we can trust, if you stick to the official Ubuntu operating system (look at the disaster Mint brought upon us), if you stick to downloading from websites you can trust (apache, mysql etc) you are fine without a virusscanner. By the way: this last bit also applies to other operating systems. It is the randomly downloading software and the opening of mails on a Windows system that get you into trouble. Don't do the 1st, use on-line mail for the 2nd and you don't need a virusscanner ever. \n\nA: This question is very subjective: even in Windows world there is no consensus right now on which antivirus is the best, and every antivirus is not immune to reporting false positives and missing out on some viruses. Clam AV for Linux is well known for that. \nTruth is there is no best antivirus. The best antivirus is your own behavior - avoid visiting fishy websites and don't install non-legitimate software. That's your 80% security, in either world - Windows or Unix. \nPeople don't realize a virus is software - and it doesn't jump onto your computer  randomly, you as admin let it in. If you do, then you're screwed. \nIn the Linux world that seems to be fairly decent - people stick to official repositories more, install less of the external software. The biggest threat in the Linux world , and particularly for servers, are automated attacks by hackers, mostly on cracking passwords. For instance, my server on digital ocean constantly has tons of random IP addresses trying to brute force my root password. In such scenario, antiviruses are as useful as toilet paper.\nIf you do file sharing between Windows machines or Windows network shares and your system, then you may want to consider running antivirus. There are choices of Avast ,AVG, Kaspersky, Comodo, ClamAV. \n\nA: I would tend to agree with Rinzwind here. But there is one reason why you might want anti-virus software. If you use your Ubuntu installation as your main \"download source\" and transfer a lot of files from your Ubuntu installation to USB-Sticks or Samba etc you would have a chance to \"Stop the virus before it ever comes in to contact with a windows machine\" as Rinzwind said.\nFor more information please read:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus\n", "Q: Dual Graphic Card Setup (Integrated + Discrete) on Desktop My current setup is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD HD Radeon 4250 integrated GPU\n\n*Nvidia GTX 460 1 GB GPU\n\n*Three monitors, two running via the GTX 460 and the other running via\nthe onboard.\n\n\nThis setup works without any issues on Windows 10.

This is because compatibility with POSIX has\n  become more important to most gawk users than compatibility with old\n  programs.\n\nSince Ubuntu 12.04 has GNU awk 3.1.8 and 14.04 has 4.0.1, you must be on 12.04 (or another such old release).\n\nSet POSIXLY_CORRECT for POSIX behaviour:\n$ echo \"a{2,3}\" | POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 gawk '/a{2,3}/ {print}'\n$ echo \"aa\" | POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 gawk '/a{2,3}/ {print}'\naa\n\nOr, use the -r option if you want to keep GNU extensions and use interval expressions:\n\n-r\n--re-interval \nAllow interval expressions (see Regexp Operators) in regexps.

I am learning Japanese so I have installed Japanese (Anthy) through the gnome-control-center, but I have discovered something rather annoying, if I am typing in Hiragana and then I need to switch to Katakana or vice-versa, when I change input sources all the previous text which I have typed in the previous input source is deleted. How can I stop this so that I can switch between Hiragana and Katakana without having to do fiddly copying and pasting?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: There does not appear to be a solution to this that will work exactly the way you would like, but I can suggest a couple of workarounds to make working in Anthy more productive.\nFirst, the behavior that you are seeing is really by design. While you are typing kana (of either sort), you are in pre-edit mode, which is a form of highlighting the text. When you switch the input mode, it's like typing over any highlighted text and causing it to disappear.\nThe solution is really -- before switching the mode -- to just to remove by highlighting by converting the current text via space and/or committing the text via Enter. Once the text has been committed, it's not going anywhere.\nThe key here is to keep in mind that the various kana modes are separate sub-input modes, although this does mean that you might not be able to make as long a sentence as you might have wished that combines hiragana and katakana.\nWhen you have typed in one mode and wish to change everything you've typed to another mode, you can use the function keys without losing what you have already typed:\n\n\n*\n\n*F6 converts to hiragana.\n\n*F7 converts to katakana.\n\n*F8 converts half-width katakana.\n\n*F9 converts to full-width romaji.\n\n*F10 converts to romaji.\nThe above only convert text that has already been typed.\nUnfortunately, there is no default keyboard setting to switch between the input modes, but rather than mousing up to the ibus menu on the top bar each time, you can set the keyboard shortcuts in:\nPreferences -- Anthy >> Keybinding tab >> hiragana mode (and a separate katakana mode)\n\nAnd, finally, a good option when you are only entering a small amount of katakana in a larger string of hiragana/kanji is to simply type the word you want in hiragana, then convert via the space bar and choose the katakana version that appears in the list of candidates.\n", "Q: After Nvidia drivers installed, GUI not starting No clue why, but my computer crapped out after playing TF2, so I looked online.

I suppose a summary of why there hasn't been a move so you can entirely control your ubuntu computer from a google account is (in my opinion):\n\n\n*\n\n*Google does not write Ubunutu, or Unity, or Debian (the upstream version), or even very much of the linux kernel. For them to have the account control tools, or install tools server side would be a lot of work for them, and an uphill battle to keep it up to date.\n\n*Ubuntu is owned by a different company: Canonical. Even if they wanted could based centralised settings for the desktop, why would the have it set up to run with google rather than their own cloud?\n\n*We already have centralised software repositories and apt-get to allow us to keep software up to date. But without all the malware on that is on the android store. And without every program being able to demand ridiculous permissions to look at your data and talk home just to turn your LED into a flash light.\n\n*Finally, Ubuntu has its community, who I assume for the most part, like me, do not want to hand the keys to their computers over to google. We are happy to use cloud services for specific tasks as an when we want. Perhaps even back up all our system settings to the cloud. But google snooping/control fully integrated into my computer no thanks.\nI think the opposite question is on many of our minds.

On Debian-based systems, apache2 is started as root. It then forks off and runs under an unprivileged user (typically www-data). The actual work is done by these processes.\nOnly a privileged process can bind to ports below 1024. So, at least for binding to the default 80 and 443 ports, it will have to run as root.\nAnd, among other things, the original process reads SSL certificate private keys, which are typically only read by root. From /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz:\nThe SSL key file should only be readable by root; the certificate file may be\nglobally readable. These files are read by the Apache parent process which runs\nas root, and it is therefore not necessary to make the files readable by the\nwww-data user.\n\nSo, this is documented behaviour.\n\nA: No. Apache is always started as \"root\" and it then uses \"setuid\" to spawn children that do the actually processing of requests for the apache user.\nIf you want to create a listening socket on a privileged port (so one below port 1024) you must do that as root (or to be more precise: with user ID 0). Port 80 and 443 for SSL.  \nSo ... if you do no trust Apache to bind to a socket you should not run a webserver on your server.\nSee for instance http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/03/apache-hardening/ \n", "Q: How to get Japanese Kanji characters as an input mode? I am learning Japanese and I have found that after installing Japanese (Anthy) through the gnome-control-center that I have several input modes available to type with now under that, Hiragana, Katakana, Halfwidth Katakana, Latin, and Wide Latin. However, there is no Kanji. I could probably install it by installing the Chinese input source, but I may not be able to find the correct characters because of difference in meaning and pronunciation so it would be preferable if I could get the Japanese one (so that I can type watashi instead of I to get 私 - I would be for the Chinese one, and watashi for the Japanese one).\nSo how does one install Kanji? And can one use it as an input mode? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\nJust to clarify: I want Kanji and not Kana (the name for individual Hiragana and Katakana characters) as I've already found that.\n\nA: The Anthy input method that you are using is able to input kanji. \nAfter you type a word (or even a long phrase) in kana, just press the Space bar in order to bring up the kanji conversion.\nAnthy will provide several options based on frequency of use in Japanese, words and phrases commonly used together, and on your local frequency of use.\n", "Q: I Mounted ZFS to /home, but not linked? Both /home and /tank/home have a folder called main (which is my username).  However if I add another folder to /home it does not appear in /tank/home.  If I add another folder to /tank/home it does not appear in home.\nWhen I type sudo zfs mount it says:\ntank/home                        /home\ntank                             /tank\n\n\nA: This is the expected behavior.\nEven while they do match by default at creation time, you shouldn't confuse the dataset names, here tank and tank/home and the directories they are mounted to, initially /tank and /tank/home.\nYou (or someone else?) changed the tank/home mountpoint property to be /home. After doing that, the tank dataset can contain a directory named home and this directory is completely unrelated to the /home directory contained in the tank/home dataset.\nNote also that tank is not a drive or even a volume, both tank and tank/home share the same storage pool so filling either of them will reduce their common available space.\n", "Q: Create a shell scrip from bat script I am trying to make my python program compatible with linux and I honestly have no idea how write a shell script.

How can I make this happen?\n\nA: The Ubuntu setup will give you three options: \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10\", This is the one you select if you are going to dual-boot. \"Replace Windows 10 with Ubuntu\", you can use this solution to erase Windows 10 and install Ubuntu. Or \"Something Else\", which allows you to resize partitions and you can select how much space the Ubuntu install will take up on your hard disk.  \n", "Q: Safest, Easiest Way to Format & Mount Multiple Hard Drives without losing data? Okay, I'm trying to make a switch to Ubuntu from Windows. I understand the file structure is different and different terms are used, which I'm okay with. I also have no problem with waiting on copying/pasting from drive to drive.\nI have 4 drives in all: firstly is what I call my system drive which would contain the OS, OS updates, and related files (it's a 120GB SSD), then I have 3 other drives for anything else - 1x3TB, 1x4TB, and 1x1TB respectively. I want to mount them each in a way that I can install stuff like Steam to my 3TB drive. Or should I just stop using my SSD for the system like I did with Windows and reinstall to one of my other drives?\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: It's a little unclear what you're wanting to do, but I'll have a stab at it.\nIf you want to keep all your windows files, simplest method is to physically remove the SSD from your system. Now install Ubuntu to whichever drive you choose (1Tb, 3Tb or 4Tb). After you've installed you can put your SSD back into your system. \nWhen you boot into Ubuntu you will still be able to see all your windows files, however if you want to run Windows apps you will need to install WINE in Ubuntu. This can be done through the Software Center or through the command-line (open a Terminal and type sudo apt-get install wine\n", "Q: How to install Emmet (or any web development Plugins) for vim editor I am trying to develop my Website but I am not interested on using graphical interfaces.

Again no improvement...\n\nA: Based on this link Intel certifies kernel 4.2 for this wifi card.\nYes there are work arounds that one can try but that might help temporarily. Please refer to my thread.\nI had Intel AC 3165 and i tried to make it work on Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 LTS with the workaround...some amount of success but connection used to drop every 10-15 minutes.\nFinally i upgraded to Ubuntu Desktop 15.10 which comes with kernel 4.2.x and it's working fine after that.\nSelectively you can just upgrade your kernel to 4.2 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS also. But you need to have work around for other apps. \nI believe upgrading to Ubuntu 15.10 is worth trying as it's easy to upgrade to 16.04 LTS coming in next month.\nSome debugging tips\nThere is some good amount of information available in this forum for debugging the isssue:\nGo thru this thread and run the wireless script \n", "Q: Can not boot Boot-Repair live cd I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 and windows 8.1.

Then select this partition through the [ separate / boot partition ] of [Boot Repair ] . ( Https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootPartition )\n\nIf your computer boots directly into Windows , try changing the boot order in the BIOS.\nIf your BIOS does not support changing the boot order , change the default entry in the Windows boot loader .\nFor example you can start Windows , then type the following command in a cmd window with administrator privileges :\nbcdedit / set { bootmgr } path \\ EFI \\ ... \\ grub * .EFI\n\nI won't take the first point very seriously...but the second one is worth trying\nFor example you can start Windows , then type the following command in a cmd window with administrator privileges :\nbcdedit / set { bootmgr } path \\ EFI \\ ... \\ grub * .EFI\n\nGive this a try.\n\nA: Perhaps you could give it a try with Super GRUB 2 disk.\nYou can download it from here.\nThen install it in a usb using Unetbootin\nNow you could restart your system and make sure it is set in the boot option menu.\n", "Q: How to get the intel 3165 wireless adapter to work in Ubuntu 14.04? I understand the 4.2 kernel supports this wireless adapter. But I need to stay in Ubuntu 14.04 for my own purposes, and so I need to make it work in here. All other solutions I've seen are for qualcomm adapters or recommend going to the 4.2 kernel. \nCurrent kernel: \n$ uname -r\n3.19.0-25-generic\nDriving me insane.\n\nA: This is the way to upgrade to kernel 4.2\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-wily\n\nThis way you will remain with lsb_release of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS but kernel is upgraded.

I'd like to use the 120 drive for \n\n\n*\n\n*/\n\n*/var\n\n*/etc\nand so on and make a very minimal home folder on that drive. I would then like to mount another drive (which I would name home) over my home folder. \nIs this possible?\n\nA: (!) Be careful while following these tips (!) because targeting the wrong device may destroy the data on your 120 GB disk (!)\nGuessing your 1TB drive is /dev/sdb:\n\n*\n\n*Setup a new disk with the desired partition:\n$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdb\ncreate a new partition table - command: o\ncreate a new partition - command: n   (accept all proposed values)\nspecify the type of the new partition - command: t / Type 83\nwrite the data to the disk and leave fdisk - command: w\n\n\n\n*Format the new disk/partition:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 -L Home /dev/sdb1\n\n\n\n*Mount the new partition temporarily, change owner, and copy your home-directory:\nmount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nchown -R $USER.$USER /mnt\ncp -a $HOME/* /mnt/\n\n\n\n*Unmount the partition:\numount /mnt\n\n\n\n*Look for the UUID assigned to your new partition:\nsudo tune2fs -l /dev/sdb1 | grep UUID\n\n\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab and add a line:\nsudo vi /etc/fstab\n\nThe new line (take the UUID from the tune2fs command) and replace USERNAME with your username i.e. the name of your home directory:\nUUID=15cc846c-36e4-42dd-8bfe-30acc8965d51 /home/USERNAME          ext4    defaults        0       2\n\nAfter rebooting the system, you should see the 1TB partition mounted as your home directory. If the mount fails, you would see your old home directory as a kind of fallback.\n\nA: If I understand correctly a simple solution is just to use the mount command if the driver doesnt automatically mount and then using the ln command create a link of your driver to your home folder\nbasicly your systems should automatically detect the additional driver and you should be able to see it in your devices in your Files. You can then make a link using ln (kind of like a shortcut in windows) from the driver that would be in your /media/\"username\" to your home folder.\nyou can't however override your home folder with the new driver, but if thats what you want to do I recommend just create your home folder in your other driver.\n", "Q: Mounted Android System.img unable to edit I have mounted an android system image using the command:\nsudo mount -t ext4 -o loop system.img sys/ \n\nWhen I go into the mount point, all of the files are easy to open. I can go through just about everything. The problem comes when I try to edit the files. I cannot save anything. It says that there is not space left on the device. I have plenty of space left on the device itself, so that means that the mount point is out of space. \nNo big deal, right? Wrong. I tried deleting some files that were much bigger than the one I was trying to overwrite, but the same problem happened. In fact, the total disk size actually shrunk by the amount I had removed, once again leaving me at 0 free space.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: If the img file in your /etc/fstab? If it is it may be listed as being mounted in a read-only state (ro). You can either edit fstab to change ro to rw or you can explicitly state to mount the img file as read-write from the commandline by adding rw option after -o in your mount command.\nsudo mount -t ext4 -o loop,rw system.img sys/\nIf you are still short on free space you may need to resize the image file. This can be done with GUI GParted via sudo gparted /dev/loop0 then use menus to make the file larger so you have some free space to work with.\n\nA: [Answer]\nThis was apparently a bug in Ubuntu. The way that I got around it was by using the resize2fs command to make the partition file bigger. The exact command I ran was sudo resize2fs system.img 520M\nNOTE: You may have to run sudo resize2fs system.img 1000M first and then reduce the size back to 520M by using the command above. \n", "Q: Updating Google Chrome gives sources.list error I am using Ubuntu 14.04.

I dug an older (circa 2000) PC out of the garage to teach my kids linux and text mode programming. The motherboard has an intel chipset and the graphics chip is the Intel 82810E. When I install the latest Ubuntu my attached display shows a garbage character set, making the console unreadable. I found out, however, that the 6.10 Ubuntu release supported this chipset; in fact, I installed 6.10 and it worked like a charm. My question now is \"How can I get the graphics driver from 6.10 and install it on my 14.04 release?\n\nA: I don't see why it should be a problem. As long the current kernel is backward-compatible with the kernel used in 6.10, you should be fine.\nHere's a guide on how to add repos from an older Ubuntu release onto the current version\n\nA: I would rather download the source of the 82810 Intel driver, compile and install on UBUNTU 14.04. The old driver from 6.1 must not be forward compatible. The newer kernel versions have often renamed the names of the functions. I would even wonder when the 6.1 driver would work on 14.04. \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu onn SSD (2nd) and documents on hdd (main) on Dell Studio 1737 I am new to Linux in regards attempting installation etc. In past months my several PC's have repeatedly crashed rendering not only my OS unusable but apparently the document folders as well.

Although I have not discovered why my several PC's are repeatedly having boot issues it is my hope that until I can discover the problem, at least I can preserve my documents.\nRecently I installed ubuntu on the SSd but when attempting to re-boot, the system did not recognize the OS. All of the posts about this bring up \"dual boot\"(ing) where as prefer to install Windows on a separate laptop\nI am perplexed and would appreciate any help/instruction as to how to accomplish this installation.\n\nA: In order to make the system recognize your Ubuntu, you have to change the boot order in bios. After turning on your computer press either F2 or F12 (sometimes it Delete key)  and go to bios munu, in the \"Boot\" tab change boot order. It also could be in the advanced tab.\n\nIf you want to have your documents on your HDD. You just have to set your HOME PARTITION (/home) on that drive while installing Ubuntu.\n\nIn the picture you see a box named Mount Point. Its on Root Partition (/) by default. You can set root on SDD and after that select your HDD and click on + sign and from this box select /home.\nThat will do it.\n", "Q: Can I purchase a CD or DVD with Ubuntu Can I purchase a Ubuntu system on a CD or DVD and install it myself?

This post here suggests that in order to upgrade to 15.10, I first need to upgrade to 14.10 and then 15.04 before 15.10, and skipping upgrades in between is generally a bad idea.\nThat's all well and good, but when I try to follow the instructions in the post, I get this when running do-release-upgrade -d:\nErr Upgrade tool signature                                                     \n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]                                        \nErr Upgrade tool                                                               \n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]                                        \nFetched 0 B in 0s (0 B/s)                                                      \nWARNING:root:file 'utopic.tar.gz.gpg' missing\nFailed to fetch\nFetching the upgrade failed.

I don't mind waiting for 16.04 LTS if I need to, but I'd prefer to do the incremental upgrades if its going to result in a more reliable system.\nCould someone please explain the truth to me here? Because these seem contradictory.\nEDIT: I tested the same steps on another machine also running 14.04 LTS, and the do-release-upgrade -d command worked, however it tried to upgrade directly to 15.10 and completely broke the system (wouldn't boot). So it seems like going directly to 15.10 is still a terrible idea. So what is the alternative upgrade path?

I get the feeling I'd need to use Apport to debug the application that's causing the crash (answering question #3), but I don't know how to figure out what application would be causing the crash.\n\nA: I might be over thinking the problem.

EFI partition is common for Windows and Ubuntu. You can look into it and see what is there.\nAnyway you do not need two EFI partitions. You can delete sda6, if there is no Windows EFI in it. I very much doubt that there is something. It looks empty.\nEven if there is Windows EFI, you can boot with Windows installation disk and fix Windows boot from there. sda3 is enough for both Ubuntu and Windows.\n", "Q: AppSocket/HP JetDirect - how to find host and port number In connecting to a network printer using AppSocket/HP JetDirect, how does one determine the host and port number?\n\nA: The host is the printer itself.

Was the readout in the log screen the disk check?\n\nA: A more easy way is to tell ubuntu to check the filesystem on next boot. You can do this by touching /forcefsck (have a look here):\nsudo touch /forcefsck\n\nAnother way is to pres ESC on boot while Grub is loading. You will get the Grub-boot-menu (have a look here).

How can I do that?\nI need a recovering software that points specifically to the folder where the files were deleted and searches for the files there (not at the entire partition) since I have an extremely active partition. \nThank you!\n\nA: If you only moved files into the trash, rather than actually deleting them, you will be able to restore your files by opening your file manager and browsing to the 'Trash folder'. When you open Trash you should be able to see your files. Right click on them and 'Restore' them they will appear back where they were prior to deleting them.\n\nA: If you used the default filesystem when installing (EXT4) you might have a chance with extundelete. As always, there are no guarantees with trying to recover deleted files.\n", "Q: how to run program using png library I installed libpng and zlib and want to run this program using png.h.

Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages \n   (or specify a solution)\n\n\nA: I've already faced similar problems and I figured that in most cases the only thing you have to do is\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nand then\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nIf that doesn't help, you should edit file /var/lib/dpkg/status and delete whole blocks of broken packages. Then repeat first two commands and that should fix it.\n\nA: Try to start aptitude\nsudo aptitude\n\naptitude should also determines the problems and often proposes a solutions with can be applied pressing the \"!\"-key. Have a look in the bottom line of aptitude.

This is because you must unmount partitions that you want change.\nSo, after you booted up Live CD/USB your PC, open GParted and check if is no key icon is showed next to /dev/sdaX labels. If there is a key it is a sign that the corresponding partition is mounted and so is locked from being modified. (As you can see, in your image all partitions are mounted, because all labels have a key next to them).\nTo unmount a partition, right click on it and select unmount.\nThen you have to move toward right in order partition: sda9, sda8, sda7. You can get an idea from this image: partition moving idea.\nAfter that you can extend root partition (sda6).\nWhen you are ready you can apply changes. The entire process will take a lot because GParted have to move 3 partitions, but in the end you should obtain what you wish.\nI've done the same procedure to move a small partition around my hard disk.\n", "Q: \"No Bootable Device\" even after several installations I have purchased a new acer aspire E 15, E5-573 laptop and myself trying to install ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64 bit) OS. I have tried installing more than 8 times and installation successfully completed each time. But finally when I restarting the system, the installed os cannot be booted and \"No Booting Device\" message is coming.\nMyself tried both USB as well as DVD installations but every time result is same. I also checked BIOS using F2 key and set the Boot from HDD Device. But of no use. What is the problem exactly?\n\nA: Disable Fast Startup. Windows 8.1 and presumably future versions have a feature called Fast Startup. When it is enabled -- and it is enabled by default -- Windows shuts down in a hybrid state, somewhere between a full shutdown and a \"sleep\" state. The dual boot manager which Ubuntu will install (called grub) does not presently (March 2015) know how to start Windows from this hybrid state. You must therefore disable Fast Startup if you ever want to use Windows again after installing Ubuntu. Just how to do that is best left to the documentation of your particular version of Windows. But do not fail to do it, or you will never boot Windows again.\nThere also used to be an option to tell GRUB where to install the boot loader. Did you use this option during install? Perhaps you did not tell GRUB to install the bootloader on the correct partition.\n", "Q: Finalizing VPN, won't save I have followed a guide on wiki-how for setting up an VPN tunnel to ensure somewhat anonymous internet browsing. I have created a virtual PC with Ubuntu on it and bought a VPS service. I have also configured an FTPclient through putty (an SSH client) so that I could install openVPN on my VPS. I have logged on to my openVPN and downloaded the client.ovpn and now I am at the final step, I just need to access the VPN via the client.ovpn. The guide was some lackluster at places so it has been somewhat of a hassle.\nAnyway now there is only one step left and that is creating the actual connection from my virtual PC to the openvpn tunnel. Just one problem, it wont let me save at the last window. It seems like I am lacking in a bunch of certificate, how do I get those? Or is there any other problem I need to fix? Any advice or guides will be appreciated. \nThe wikihow guide (I have followed the steps in 'Browsing with Strong Anonymity*): \nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Be-Online-Anonymously\nA screen dump of the problem at hand:\n\n\nA: See all the file selection panels that read (None)?

I accepted all newer versions.  After that I tried booting to the system again and it worked!\nI had to manually reconfigure repositories as there were some enabled from \"trusty tahr\" and most others had been disabled during the upgrade procedure.\nAfter doing this I did:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThe system is still a bit wonky as in Screen Reader from Universal Access gets activated while booting to lock screen and turns off after logging in and booting up takes a while longer than it used to, but It works and when I get fed up with the wonkyness I can back up the data and do a fresh install.\n\nA: As this question comes up quite high when searching on Google, the right solution isn't to restart the computer as you might indeed get into some troubles. \nThe right solution (including for 16.04 to 18.04 update) is to unlock the screen from the command line: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F1 to open the terminal \n\n*sudo loginctl unlock-sessions (as pointed out by https://askubuntu.com/a/921726/111427)\n\n*Switch back to your graphic session : Ctrl+Alt+F7\n\n", "Q: unable to dpkg cups-pdf By mistakenly i removed cups from my system in terminal by command \nsudo apt-get remove cups-pdf\nsudo apt-get remove cups\n\nafter that i tried below \n sudo dpkg -i cups-pdf_2.5.0-16_amd64.deb \n Selecting previously unselected package cups-pdf.\n (Reading database ... 167602 files and directories currently installed.)\n Preparing to unpack cups-pdf_2.5.0-16_amd64.deb ...\n Unpacking cups-pdf (2.5.0-16) ...\n dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of cups-pdf:\n  cups-pdf depends on cups; however:\n   Package cups is not installed.\n\n dpkg: error processing package cups-pdf (--install):\n  dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\n Errors were encountered while processing:\n  cups-pdf\n\ncan you please help me out from this problem.\n\nA: Possibility one (assumption: you don't need the old cups-pdf):\nYou removed the packages it with apt-get remove, so install them back with apt-get install:\nsudo apt-get install cups-pdf\n\nThis will install cups-pdf with all its dependencies.\n\nPossibility two (assumption: you need the old cups-pdf):\nThe message clearly says that to install sudo dpkg -i cups-pdf_2.5.0-16_amd64.deb it requires cups package, so install it:\nsudo apt-get install cups\n\nthen can proceed with:\nsudo dpkg -i cups-pdf_2.5.0-16_amd64.deb\n\n\nNotice:\nIn either scenario it is possible (depending on your system state) that another dependency problem would arise and you will have to read the message that your system displays you and act accordingly.\n", "Q: How to remove Dual booting option and partition of Ubuntu? First of all, I'd like to state my partitions:\nWindows 7 with:\nC:\\ Windows 7 (pre-existing installation).\nD:\\ Data (Already exists and has files).\nI download Ubuntu 14.10 from a bootable usb.

When I click on delete partition, it became as free space not unallocated.\nAlso, I tried to merge this partition back to C: but there's no extend volume option out there. I'm totally confused, how can I get my laptop normal again? How can I delete Ubuntu's partition and Ubuntu's booting option?  I already read this question: How to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on?. I've done the first answer of that question but the partition and the dual booting option persist. \n\nA: First of all shrink that Logical Partition and then delete it, it will be transform as unallocated. In this situation you can extend the volume of C: or D:.

(I don't mind enabling 802.11a, too, but I don't need it. I need 802.11n and b/g legacy.)\n\n*Bridge wlan0 and eth0 together as br0.\n\n*Use DHCP to configure an IPv4 address for p2p1.\n\n*Set up a DHCP server to assign private IPv4 addresses to hosts connected to br0.\n\n*Set up NAT between br0 and p2p1 for IPv4 traffic.\n\n*Use DHCPv6 to fetch an IPv6 prefix for p2p1.\n\n*Set up router advertisement to assign IPv6 addresses under the prefix to hosts connected to br0.\n\n*Route IPv6 traffic between p2p1 and br0.\n\n*Set up a caching DNS server and advertise it as the DNS server to hosts on br0 (but block queries from p2p1).\n\n*Set up firewall rules that block all CIFS/SMB, possibily other insecure Windows traffic and CUPS printing between the br0 LAN and the p2p1 WAN.\n\n*Set up whatever other firewall rules are considered best practice while not preventing efficient Skype, WebRTC and push notification traffic between WAN and the hosts on the br0 network.\nThis should be a basic \"turn an Ubuntu box into an IPv4+IPv6 home router\" kind of thing. I've done a lot of searching already, but I've failed to find a guide that matches my needs. In particular, I have trouble finding guidance for setting up iwlwifi-based wlan0 with WPA2 in the AP mode and then using that as part of a brige interface. (I found guides that talk about WEP or of using wlan0 as the WAN interface that connects to an AP as a client or explicitly using Atheros drivers as opposed to iwlwifi.) Also, I have trouble finding guidance for the IPv6 part. Superficially, it looks like some combination of bridge-utils, hostapd and dnsmasq could address all of the above. Maybe.\nAny pointers to a guide that already covers this or other advice on how to proceed?\n\nA: The significant bit was locating a tutorial for fetching the IPv6 prefix.\nOther than that, the comments in the default config files and the obviously-discoverable tutorials for bridge-utils, hostapd and dnsmasq worked.\nWith ufw the key thing was to use the route keyword in rules that apply to traffic that doesn't terminate on the router computer itself.\n(I used AppArmor to confine wide-dhcpv6-client, dnsmasq and hostapd by following the guidance for aa-logprof on the community wiki.)\n", "Q: Can't install unity tweak tool I tried multiple times installing the unity tweak tool via the terminal but every time it give me the following output.

It is started in /etc/rc.local via \n/usr/bin/xinit /usr/bin/kodi\n\nToday a toddler got hold of the keyboard for a split second and managed, though a keyboard combination, to switch the screen so that the kodi window now takes about 1/6th of the screen. It is in the upper-left corner, the rest of the screen is blank and when moving the mouse, the cursor changes from an arrow (while above the small screen) to a cross while outside.\nIt looks like the case where one starts xinit with just an xterm (which also takes that part of the screen).\n(wild guesses follow) It may be that the keyboard combination instructed kodi to use a smaller resolution, or xinitto use a larger one (and thus pushing kodi into a smaller screen).\nI rebooted the computer but it now boots into this configuration as well (so - wild guesses again - it may be that the keyboard combination switched a permanent parameter, but it was a split second so it could not have been much more than Ctrl-M-Shift-Left Arrow-P)\nSince the conversational possibilities with the baby are tiny I would appreciate any pointer on where to look for a solution.\n\nA: In Kodi goto\n\nSystem → Settings → System → Video output\n\nChange the option \"Display mode\" from \"Windowed\" to \"Full screen\"\nTo toggle between \"Windowed\" and \"Full screen\" mode you also can use the keyboard shortcut \\ (the backslash key).

I really don't wanna install rEFIt. Is there any other way?\nThanks very much!!\n\nA: First, rEFIt is abandonware; it hasn't been updated in six years. Because of this, I created a rEFIt fork called rEFInd, which is under active development and that works better with both Linux (including Ubuntu) and recent versions of OS X than does rEFIt. Thus, if you can't get it working the way you want, please look into rEFInd instead of rEFIt.\nThat said, there are two ways to install Ubuntu under OS X, each of which has several variants. The answer to your question depends on which method, and variant, you choose:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS/CSM/legacy mode -- Much older documentation describes installing Ubuntu on a Mac using the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), aka BIOS-mode or legacy-mode support. In its simplest-to-install configuration, this involves booting the Ubuntu installer in BIOS mode and letting it install GRUB 2. You should then get an option on the Mac's boot menu for booting a BIOS-mode OS. IIRC, it doesn't know the difference between different boot loaders, so it will call GRUB 2 \"Windows,\" but it should work. You could install LILO, GRUB Legacy, or a more exotic boot loader instead of GRUB 2, if you preferred, but this would involve jumping through extra hoops. The big problem with this approach is that it requires the use of a hybrid MBR, which is an ugly and dangerous hack. If you don't understand GPT, MBR, and hybrid MBR, I STRONGLY advise against this approach, because it will become far too easy for you to end up trashing your hard disk. If you do understand these topics, you can probably do it this way without causing too many problems, but it's still not my personal first choice.\n\n*EFI mode -- An EFI-mode installation of Ubuntu obviates the need for a hybrid MBR, which makes it much safer. There are a number of ways to do this, but broadly speaking, they fall into two categories:\n\n\n*\n\n*A standard EFI installation -- On a UEFI-based PC, Ubuntu installs the EFI-mode GRUB 2 to the EFI System Partition (ESP) and adds an entry that points to GRUB to the NVRAM boot manager list. Unfortunately, Apple's EFI doesn't use this boot menu list in quite the normal way, so although this approach can make GRUB the default boot manager, it's not likely to show up on the Mac's GUI boot menu. GRUB might or might not be able to boot OS X (I've seen reports of both successes and failures). Thus, a regular EFI-mode install of Ubuntu to a Mac can be problematic. With enough persistence and knowledge of GRUB, you may be able to get it to work, but not in quite the way you say you want.\n\n*Pretending to be Mac OS X -- OS X installs its boot loader as /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi on an HFS+ volume. If you create an HFS+ volume and copy GRUB 2 (grubx64.efi) to that name, along with a few support files, OS X's system chooser will notice it and enable you to pick it. See this blog post for more on this approach. Ubuntu doesn't support this type of install, though (unless it's new for 16.04 and I haven't yet learned of it). Thus, if you want to use this method, you'll need to set it up manually. Also, there were some changes recently (to El Capitan, IIRC -- or maybe to Yosemite) that seem to require some extra support files for the selection to show up in OS X's own boot picker. I haven't yet researched those changes, so I don't yet know precisely what might be needed. If you want to try this method of installation, it's probably best to do a regular EFI-mode install and then copy the main GRUB 2 file and its support files to a small HFS+ volume, then add the Mac-specific support files. Note that you must either create a dedicated GRUB 2 HFS+ volume or use a previously-unbootable HFS+ volume. You must not try to use your regular OS X volume for this purpose, since that would wipe out the OS X boot loader, rendering OS X unbootable.\n\n\n\nNote also that the initial boot mode of the Ubuntu installer (that is, BIOS vs. EFI) determines whether it will install a BIOS-mode or EFI-mode GRUB. Thus, you must control this boot mode. Apple's boot manager may be unclear on this, or may not even give you the option you want. (Details vary depending on Mac model, firmware version, and how the boot medium was prepared.) Once you've booted Ubuntu, you can check your boot mode by looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If that directory is present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS mode.\nAll together, none of these options is both easy and good -- a BIOS-mode install is easy but ugly and potentially dangerous; and EFI-mode booting is harder to set up but safer and cleaner. This is one of the reasons so many Mac users use rEFInd (or rEFIt before it).\nNote that rEFInd need not add anything to the Ubuntu boot complexity, since it can replace GRUB 2. Depending on how you configure it, a boot through rEFInd involves the rEFInd menu appearing. This menu can direct the boot process to OS X's boot loader, boot GRUB 2 (BIOS-mode or EFI-mode, assuming it's installed), or boot a Linux kernel directly. Because of this last possibility, GRUB 2 need not even be installed. If you want to do this, the easiest approach is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu installer in either BIOS mode or EFI mode (which is mostly irrelevant).\n\n*When prompted, select the option to try Ubuntu without installing it.\n\n*Open a Terminal window in the Ubuntu live session.\n\n*Type ubiquity -b. This launches the Ubuntu installer, but tells it to not install GRUB 2.\n\n*Install Ubuntu. Ideally, do not create a separate /boot partition; but if you do (to support LVM, RAID, or disk encryption), take note of the identity of your Ubuntu root (/) partition (/dev/sda5, /dev/mapper/ubuntu-root, or whatever). Also, use ext4fs for the partition that holds the Linux kernel (the root [/] partition or, if you use one, your separate /boot partition).\n\n*Reboot. OS X should come up.\n\n*Install rEFInd.\n\n*Reboot. rEFInd should come up and give you options for both OS X and Ubuntu. Test them both. If you created a separate /boot partition, you must perform some extra steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you highlight the Ubuntu option, do not hit Enter; instead, hit F2 or Insert twice.\n\n*Add ro root={whatever} to the options, where {whatever} is your root (/) filesystem identifier.\n\n*In Ubuntu, locate the mkrlconf script that came with rEFInd and run it. (You should be able to run it from your OS X volume; or you can re-download the rEFInd .zip file, unpack it, and run it from there.)\n\n*When you reboot, you should be able to boot Ubuntu by hitting Enter after selecting it in the rEFInd menu.\n\n\n\nIf you want to avoid rEFIt because you usually want to boot OS X (or Ubuntu) and don't want to deal with the menu, be aware that you can adjust rEFInd so that its menu appears only if you hold down a key while booting: Edit the refind.conf file so that the following options are set:\ntimeout = -1\ndefault_selection = \"OS X\"\n\nYou can adjust default_selection as desired, of course.\n", "Q: Problems making Afl-fuzzer using BinUtils on 14.04 Aim:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am trying to setup and run Afl Fuzzer (link), as part of following an online course. \n\n\nInfo:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on dvd. \n\n*In the video the teacher uses the BinUtils 2.25 package, and I chose to use the latest version 2.26.\n\n*I don't have much experience with compiling / making software.\n\n\nSteps I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded the latest version of BinUtils to the Desktop\n(/home/ubuntu/Desktop)\n\n*Unpacked BinUtils folder using tar via Terminal.\n\n*Used make to try to create the program in the unpacked folder on the Desktop, which I think worked.\n\n*Downloaded the latest version of afl-latest.tgz from here to /home/ubuntu/.\n\n*Unpacked afl-latest.tgz using tar via Terminal.\n\n*Used make to try to create the program in /home/ubuntu/afl-2.08b, which I think worked.\n\n\nProblems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The output using ls -a of that folder is significantly different to the output shown on the video (ie I don't have all of the files that the Teacher has shown) after make has been run.\n\n*Get error bash: ./configure: No such file or directory when in the folder /home/ubuntu/afl-2.08b/, and try to run the following command: CC=afl-gcc ./config.

Just run this:\nsudo apt-get install afl\n\nand now afl-gcc will be in your $PATH, so you won't get the No such file or directory error.\nNext, install the dependencies required to build binutils:\nsudo apt-get build-dep binutils\n\nNow you can download and build the source to binutils into the current working directory with a single command, no sudo required:\napt-get source -b binutils\n\nThis will take a while to download and build.

This is my first time trying to mess around with operating systems like this, and honestly I don't know much about operating systems at all. I chose Ubuntu 14.04 because I read that it was the easiest/most common for beginners, but if I should give up and start somewhere even more basic just stop me here.\nAnyways I downloaded the Ubuntu 14.04 ISO file and burned it to a DVD, which seemed to go well, the files on the DVD look like they're supposed to at least. However I'm having trouble when it actually comes to booting from the DVD. I've turned off fast boot, but when I try to boot my computer from the DVD it first takes me to the Grub(?) menu instead of the installation menu I saw in the tutorials, and then when I select try without installing, it just gives me the message \"[ 0.0504531] Ignoring GBRT: Invalid Status 0 (Expected 1)\", and then doesn't do anything. At that point I have to force shut down my computer. Did that mess up my DVD? It does this whether secure reboot is enabled or disabled. I'm totally stuck. I've been reading about UEFI vs. BIOS but I don't understand it and can't really figure out how this is relevant to my situation, or if that's what's causing my problem. Does anybody have any insight about this? Like I said I just want to try it right now I'm not looking to install yet!\n\nA: I think its not about UEFI or other kind of booting mechanism. The problem you facing is most probably is that disc burning has not taken place correctly.\nThe grub menu appears usually when Ubuntu boot loader can't find necessary files to boot.\nI would say if you can manage then arrange a pen drive and use Universal USB Installer to make this pendrive bootable with Ubuntu and give it a shot.\nOr you can try burning another DVD/CD.\n\nA: You can try using rufus to burn the iso image onto a USB flash drive then use it to boot has worked for me multiple times.\n\nA: Download the appropriate ISO (32 bit, or 64 bit), and hashcheck it to ensure no errors occurred in the download.  Regardless of which mirror/torrent you use to get the ISO, get the hashes from the main Ubuntu site.  If you are  really concerned about altered ISOs, additionally use the GPG signature\ncheck on the hashes.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\nGPG signature check:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto\nAfter creating the install media, you can run the media-check if offered from the grub menu to ensure the media has no problems.  Starting with good, validated media will eliminate a lot of weird, non-repeatable errors.\nYour Satellite C855 with Windows 8 was one of the early UEFI machines, and had some problems with the secure boot keys.  Since the machine came with Windows 8, it is running in UEFI mode, so Ubuntu should be installed in UEFI mode too.  If you want to run with secure-boot enabled, you should ensure you BIOS is current enough to allow that.  If you disable secure-boot,\nmaybe you don't need to update the BIOS.  Certainly that is easy to try, and avoids the risk of flashing the BIOS.  Addionally, there is a long-standing bug in grub which prevents it from booting Windows with secure boot enabled (#1091464), so disabling secure-boot  will allow grub to boot Windows (instead of having to use the EFI boot menu to boot Windows when you want it).\nJust to confuse things, there are two versions, the BIOS version and the firmware version.  If your BIOS version is 6.50 or earlier, it should be updated for running with secure-boot.  The firmware version of 6.10, with BIOS version 6.60 is a working pair.\nYou have problems after the grub menu, that's not a UEFI/boot problem, it's probably video.  Normally, after an install, you will install any proprietary video drivers, but for the initial boot, you might need an additional kernel parameter like \"nomodeset\".\nIgnore the GBRT... warning.  Shutting down should not harm the DVD.\n", "Q: External Persistant Bootable SSD Mac OSX I've been trying to create a bootable external SSD. I have a 2013 MacBook Air, and a 128 GB external SSD. After a lot of trial and error I finally managed to install Ubuntu 14.04 with a ext4 partition, but it still won't boot properly. I created a bootable flash drive and used that to boot Ubuntu and run the installer/format the SSD. That worked successfully, but I'm still not able to boot from the SSD alone. I can boot from the flash drive, and the whole filesystem appears to be setup properly on the external SSD. I tried to fix it using a couple grub commands I found (here's the output http://paste.ubuntu.com/15378871/), and I managed to get the boot loader to recognize the drive (which it wasn't at first). But when I try to boot from it I get an error message and it fallback to OSX. The error message  disappears too fast for me to discern what it says.

You are making things a little too hard for yourself, here is a quick and dirty guide that ran well for me on Trusty Tahr:\nFirst pick up a few known dependencies:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall \\\n             libx11-dev libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev \\\n             libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev libxml2-dev\n\nThis does not quite catch everything so activate the Source repositories by clicking on 'Souce Code' here:\nDash >> Software & Updates >> Source Code\n\nand then running the following:\nsudo apt-get build-dep imagemagick\n\nCreate a build folder and change to it:\nmkdir $HOME/imagemagick_build && cd $HOME/imagemagick_build\n\nAnd finally download, extract, compile and install by simply copying and pasting the entire code box below into a Terminal window:\nwget https://www.imagemagick.org/download/ImageMagick-7.0.8-28.tar.bz2 && \\\ntar xvf ImageMagick-7.0.8-28.tar.bz2 && cd ImageMagick-7.0.8-28 && ./configure && make && \\\nsudo checkinstall -D --install=yes --fstrans=no --pakdir \"$HOME/imagemagick_build\" \\\n     --pkgname imagemagick --backup=no --deldoc=yes --deldesc=yes --delspec=yes --default \\\n     --pkgversion \"7.0.8-28\" && \\\nmake distclean && sudo ldconfig\n\nAnd finally test this, looking especially for the png you are missing in your own install:\nandrew@corinth:~$ identify -version\nVersion: ImageMagick 7.0.5-10 Q16 x86_64 2017-06-05 http://www.imagemagick.org\nCopyright: Copyright (C) 1999-2017 ImageMagick Studio LLC\nLicense: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/license.php\nFeatures:

you were missing :).\n\nA: I installed ImageMagick7.0.11 as well as ImageMagick7.1.0 by extracting it's tar.gz files.  But it did not work. Finally I had to install it using the rpm only. The 'dnf' command does the trick for you. If apt-get is not working, then 'dnf' might be the right solution for your RHEL/CentOS 8. Check this link for reference - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/555466/how-to-install-apt-get-and-dpkg\nNow, when I hit the magick -version or convert -\nversion command, I can see this output which is correct: Version:\n\nImageMagick 7.0.11-13 Q16 x86_64 2021-05-17 https://imagemagick.org\nCopyright: (C) 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC License:\nhttps://imagemagick.org/script/license.php Features: Cipher DPC HDRI\nModules OpenMP(4.5) Delegates (built-in): bzlib cairo djvu fontconfig\nfreetype gslib jng jp2 jpeg lcms ltdl lzma openexr pangocairo png ps\nraqm raw rsvg tiff webp wmf x xml zlib\n\nInitially, for me too, this 'Delegates(build-in)' section was coming blank, when I kept trying hard using yum command.\n\nA: andrew.46's answer provides solution for building correctly on any debian-like distro, but does not really answer why the original poster's build was not finding libpng.\nEasy way to find the culprit is to run pkg-config --cflags libpng as follows\nuser@mac ~ % pkg-config --cflags libpng\nPackage zlib was not found in the pkg-config search path.\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `zlib.pc'\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\nPackage 'zlib', required by 'libpng', not found\n\nThis provides insight into what's missing. In my case it was zlib. After installing zlib:\nuser@mac ~ % pkg-config --cflags libpng\n-I/usr/local/include/libpng16 -I/usr/local/include\n\n", "Q: AUDIO PROBLEMS: Sound Stopped Working After Reboot!

Chrome 32-bit is no longer receiving security updates (or updates of any kind, for that matter). That means you won't get new features, extensions will soon stop working, and you will be extremely vulnerable to internet attacks.\nThe best thing to do in your case is really to upgrade to a 64-bit version of Ubuntu. However, I realize this may not be possible, as your computer may be limited to 32-bit. If that is the case, there is an alternative to Chrome, called Chromium.\nChromium is essentially Chrome, but it is open-source, and doesn't quite receive the level of support Chrome gets. However, it is regularly updated and receives any security updates released by Google. Many other browsers, such as Torch, and even Opera, are based on Chromium.\nIf you want to install Chromium, simply open a terminal and run sudo apt-get install chromium-browser. You can also open the Software Center and search for it if you so wish.\nThere is absolutely no reason to keep with Chrome on 32-bit or 12.04, but if you really want to install it for whatever reason, you'll have to search for it on Google.

This is easy to parse to get the relevant information:\ncat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/uevent\n\nPOWER_SUPPLY_NAME=BAT0\nPOWER_SUPPLY_STATUS=Unknown\nPOWER_SUPPLY_PRESENT=1\nPOWER_SUPPLY_TECHNOLOGY=Li-ion\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CYCLE_COUNT=0\nPOWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_MIN_DESIGN=10800000\nPOWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_NOW=12408000\nPOWER_SUPPLY_POWER_NOW=0\nPOWER_SUPPLY_ENERGY_FULL_DESIGN=93960000\nPOWER_SUPPLY_ENERGY_FULL=83520000\nPOWER_SUPPLY_ENERGY_NOW=83450000\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CAPACITY=99\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CAPACITY_LEVEL=Normal\nPOWER_SUPPLY_MODEL_NAME=45N1175\nPOWER_SUPPLY_MANUFACTURER=SANYO\nPOWER_SUPPLY_SERIAL_NUMBER=12196\n\nA kernel module is not required since the kernel provides all the relevant information in a generic format for battery information via this simple user space interface.\n", "Q: How to setup ds4drv as DAEMON on Ubuntu?

To install a server via MAAS, there are (broadly speaking) three steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enlist -- You manually power on the sever (via a button press, ipmitool command, or whatnot). It starts up, PXE-boots from the MAAS server, and is registered with the MAAS server so that it shows up in the menu. At this point, the MAAS server has only very basic information on the node, such as its MAC address and IPMI credentials.\n\n*Commission -- To commission, you select the \"Commission\" option from the node's Web UI page. (It's a sub-menu, and I don't recall the menu name, offhand.) During commissioning, the MAAS server tells the node to start up (via IPMI, typically), the node PXE-boots, and MAAS collects more detailed information on the node, such as its available RAM and disk space. When commissioning is done, the node shuts down again.\n\n*Deploy -- To deploy, you select the \"Deploy\" option from the same submenu where \"Commission\" had been. You may also have a chance to choose which Ubuntu version (or custom OS) to deploy, depending on how you've set up the MAAS server. Again, MAAS tells the node to start up, it PXE-boots, and MAAS install Ubuntu on the node. After deployment is finished, the system should stay up and you should be able to log in via SSH from the MAAS server.\n\n\nFrom your description, I suspect that you enlisted the node, but have neither commissioned nor deployed it. Neither enlistment nor commissioning permanently installs Ubuntu on the server; that happens only during deployment. You must do those two additional steps before you can begin using the node. Once this is done, you should be able to log in from the MAAS server via SSH, or conceivably from other systems, if you've added SSH public keys to the MAAS server. Nodes deployed via a \"stock\" MAAS do not support console logins. If you need that feature, you'll need to either adjust your MAAS preseeds or set it up manually after deploying, by changing the password on the ubuntu account or by creating a new account.\n", "Q: Cannot start mongod service on Ubuntu 15.10 I uninstalled mongo using the following commands:\nsudo apt-get purge mongodb-org\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb.list\n\nThen installed it again using following commands:\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7F0CEB10\nsudo echo \"deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu \"$(lsb_release -sc)\"/mongodb-org/3.0 multiverse\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.0.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org\n\nI get the below errors:\nJob for mongod.service failed because the control process exited with error code.

By default, it starts Steam on Big Picture mode, but I would like it to start on regular, windowed mode. Going to settings doesn't work, because \"Start on Big Picture\" is already turned off, so I guess the solution must involve tweaking some starting config file.\n\nA: The file containing such configuration is called steam-de, the newest version of which is located at https://github.com/thor27/steam-login/blob/master/steam-login/usr/bin/steam-de.\nNotice the content of line 63:\nparameters='-tenfoot -enableremotecontrol'\n\nThose are the parameters that make Steam open in Big Picture mode, but luckily the author made it easy to alter.\nFirstly, you need to locate steam-de on your machine. Go to the terminal and type whereis steam-de. You may find, as output, something like steam-de: /usr/bin/steam-de /usr/bin/X11/steam-de.\nNow we edit the file. In this case, we run:\nsudo nano /usr/bin/steam-de\n\nThen, change the aforementioned parameters argument to parameters=''. Save (that's Ctrl+O on nano) and exit (Ctrl+X). If you run sudo nano /usr/bin/X11/steam-de, you will notice your change has carried on to that file.\nNow just run steam-login as usual and it will boot in windowed mode.\nBy the way, you may also want to comment line 88, prefixing it with a #; it will look like this:\n# zenity --error --text \"Ops! Steam had some trouble to run. That can be a problem with steam itself or with your configuration.\"\n\nThis will prevent steam-login from showing an error dialog when you exit steam from the windowed mode. It should, instead, just go straight back to lightdm.\n", "Q: Windows 10 randomly kicks out my GRUB, how do I reinstall it?

All that is needed is to format it FAT32, erase everything, and extract the iso onto it. Try UNetBootIn which works fine for other folks.

I have trouble with the wifi, but I just use a tplink usb wifi dongle now. But I have been struggling with the nvidia drivers. I have now gone through every article here I could find and I either end up with a black screen with a flickering cursor or an infinit login loop. I purge all nvidia drivers and everything works fine again. I have gone through every proposed solution for each of the problems I encounter and no change. I don't know if it's a compatibility issue, or if it's something I am doing wrong but I have put a ton of hours into this and I would very much like it resolved. \nI'm dual booting Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with windows 10, with a GTX965M Nvidia card and a Intel HD Graphics 530. I have heard that optimus could cause these problems and I have tried with Bumblebee, but no dice. Could someone please give me a step-by-step solution to this? Like I said it might be something I'm doing wrong and I am new, so I would appreciate the assumed details, or at least a hint so that I can research it myself.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Generally it is recommended to use the NVIDIA drivers from the official Ubuntu repositories.\nBut as you have very new graphics hardware, you can install the latest official NVIDIA drivers.\nStep 1 : Uninstall every NVIDIA related software that is currently installed. \nHighlight the Ubuntu entry in the GRUB boot menu and press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line - press F10 to boot.\nOn the login screen press Ctrl+Alt+F1 - enter user name and password - execute :  \nsudo apt-get purge nvidia* bumblebee  \nsudo reboot  \n\nStep 2 : Install the latest official NVIDIA drivers that support the GTX 965M.\nHighlight the Ubuntu entry in the GRUB boot menu and press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line - press F10 to boot.\nOn the login screen press Ctrl+Alt+F1 - enter user name and password - execute :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-361 nvidia-prime\nsudo reboot  \n\nUse NVIDIA X Server Settings (PRIME Profiles) to switch between the Intel and NVIDIA graphics.\nNote : Check whether there have settings to be changed in BIOS to manage the NVIDIA graphics.\n\nA: Have you tried installing drivers from software and updates in ubuntu ,\ngo to Additional drivers tab and it will show the drivers for Nvidia cards\nor \nhttps://www.nvidia.in/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-in\ndownload the .run driver files\nchmod +x filename.run\nsudo sh filename.run\n\nA: UPDATE: THE SOLUTION BELOW WORKED BUT THEN I REBOOTED AND NOW IT'S NOT WORKING ANYMORE AND I'M BACK TO THE SAME ISSUE :(\nUPDATE 2: SEEMS THAT IF I PLAY AROUND WITH\nprime-select intel -\nservice lightdm restart -\nsync-\nand\nprime-select nvidia - \nservice lightdm restart -\nsync -\nIt seems to work but a \"System program problem detected\" dialog box to appear at random.\nI think it's fixed!\nfollowed the instructions on this (Answer #20):\nhttps://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/810964/black-screen-after-prime-select-nvidia-and-log-out-using-v346-35-drivers/?offset=16\nI didnt find the files \" /usr/lib/primeindicator/igpuon and /usr/lib/primeindicator/dgpuon \" that he suggests, although simply adding the replacing sh with bash in the file /sbin/prime-offload and then switching back to the GUI by pressing ctr+alt+F7 made my login screen re-apear, and login is fine.\nRan \nsudo lspci -v1\nAnd i can see the last line under the 3D-graphic controller is\nKernel driver in use: nvidia\nThat means it's installed and working right?\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on an internal hard drive, and removing completely to boot Windows from another internal HDD I've seen a few posts about dual booting/partitioning and running Ubuntu from an EXTERNAL hard drive. What I want to decipher is whether it's possible to remove my laptops INTERNAL hard drive which contains windows and buy another INTERNAL HDD and install ubuntu on that? and then on the rare occasions i need to switch back to windows, I could completely remove the other internal HDD. I've read a lot about boot loaders etc, but would my laptop be able to boot into each system as they are on completely separate internal HDDs and would never be in the laptop at the same time.\nHopefully that makes sense, I'm assuming it's not great to regularly swap an internal HDD, but i just wanted to know if this is hypothetically possible?\nThanks in advance for any advice.\n\nA: If u install Ubuntu in a separate HDD there wont be any problem with the bootloaders and you can switch back to windows as you mention\n", "Q: VLC forces all videos to be the same size - cannot resize

It uses OpenGL under the hood to accelerate drawing and scaling and VA-API (if available) to accelerate video decoding.\n\nWhen testing the package for myself, I did not have the resize problem, but playback was choppy and my swap filled up until VLC crashed, so apparently it can cause various problems.

I've been given an IP address specific to this machine, and it connects without problem in Windows 10. However, using the same IPv4 configuration (via networking gui) in Ubuntu 15.10 I get no connection. ifconfig shows I don't have an address. \nIs there any way I can determine if the problem is my machine or the local servers? The support staff here is useless, just verified that I entered the static IP info correctly and then gave up.\nAbout the machine: Windows and Linux are on separate drives. Someone else set up the computer and had networking functioning in both OSs.\n\nA: Im not sure if this will help, but to set up a network, you open interfaces and fill in the details e.g\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.2.11\ngateway 192.168.2.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.2.0\nbroadcast 192.168.2.255\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 ###Googles dns server\n\n", "Q: How to move data to Windows reliably? I have a laptop which has Lubuntu installed and I have about 30-40GB of videos, documents, pictures and music files on it. I would like to move the data to another hard drive/pendrive and use it on a PC that has Windows installed. The problem is that the data on Lubunutu PC is not \"Windows compatible\", what I mean is the file names and paths may contain such characters that windows cannot handle (already tried it), like \"?\" or \":\" characters (not my fault I swear). So when I would like to open a directory which contains a not \"windows compatible\" file or directory on windows, that directory won't be opened, I will get an error. \nOf course, I know that I should correct these on a linux machine and It will work on windows, but my question is, How can I move the data to another path and also correct these problems automatically (delete or replace those characters for example)? I don't want to look through thousands of files manually, just to delete such characters, even then I could miss some of it.\n\nA: You should create a 7z-archiv from your files on the linux-box and also extract the files on the windows box with 7z.\nWhile extracting, 7z will rename the files and preserve file and directory timestamps.\nDoing it this way, files which names cotains a backslash (\\) will be handled unexpected:\nA file named \"foo\\bar\" will get extracted to the folder \"foo\" and be named \"bar\"\n", "Q: How does this bash script for suspending work?

If you were to use a Ubuntu live USB, and do the commands below. Is this literally just giving you root access to the drive?\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n\nA: Physical access is root access as Zacharee1 indicates. This is why people with sensitive data restrict physical access.\nTo break you commands down a bit though, mounting the drive is what prepares the file system and gives you access.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nAfter that mount command you can access all unencrypted data on /dev/sda1\nls /mnt\ncp /mnt/some_data /your_usb\n\netc\nA work of caution, if someone had physical access encryption may not be sufficient to protect the data as people can leverage physical access to break the encryption, \"Evil Maid\" is but one example, see https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/10/evil_maid_attac.html\nThe chroot command switches so that now you are running commands as if /dev/sda1 is mounted at / or root, assuming /dev/sda1 is a valid root file system and not /home or a data partition.\nThe chroot command has many uses above and beyond data access.\nSo after the chroot command, the commands you run in the shell now affect /dev/sda1. So if you change the password or system configuration, it affects /dev/sda1 and not the usb.\nso, for example, if you run\npasswd\n\nthe password you set affects the root user on /dev/sda1 and not root on the usb.\nSome virtualization, Openvz and LXC for example, are similar to a chroot but have additional features.\nFor additional information on chroot see\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicChroot\n\nA: Unless the filesystem is encrypted, you have full access to every file on an offline drive (i.e. from the LiveUSB). You can do whatever you want without having any user's password from that OS.\nThe LiveUSB method is one of the most popular ways to bypass passwords on both Windows and Linux, as it allows a user to set a local administrator password in Windows and a root password in Linux by replacing files or running some commands.\nIt's pretty great, as long as you're the one with hardware access and not someone you don't trust.\nEDIT:\nThanks to bodhi.zazen I now know that, even with encryption, you can gain access to a filesystem. You do need the unwitting interaction of someone who knows the encryption key, but it's still a method for access.\nRead about it here: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/10/evil_maid_attac.html\nEDITEDIT:\nApparently there are a lot of ways to access encrypted filesystems.\nhttps://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/02/cold_boot_attac.html\nI guess the lesson here is don't give people your hard drive.\n\nA: Chroot is not what gives you root, sudo is. Most livecds have sudo configured such that the default user on the livecd has unrestricted no-password sudo access. Typing \"sudo bash\" instead would have given you just the same permissions but with a different view of the filesystem.\nSo yes if you can boot a livecd and the hdd is not encrypted you can easilly buypass any file permissions and read/wite whatever you like but chroot is not what enables that, booting the livecd which contains a system on which you can trivially get root is. \n\nA: Let us say you are asking the following question: \"If I gave somebody permission to run sudo chroot /mnt\" can they get root on the host?\" The answer to that question is yes.\nBesides the obvious hard way involving mknod(), there's an easy way if they can get a compiler:\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\nint main() {\n    int n = open(\"/\", 0);\n    chroot(\"/bin\");\n    fchdir(n);\n    chdir(\"..\");\n    chroot(\".\");\n    execve(\"/bin/sh\", \"/bin/sh\");\n}\n\nChroot jails do nothing if the attacker has root.\n", "Q: Can't login to my user account in ubuntu 14.04 Hi I have problem to accesses to my account I'm installed Ubuntu in virtual box(oracle) and after this install I tried to log in and it just think and then go back to the screen of LogIn what should I do? \n\nA: I had this exact same issue last night!\n1) Enter the terminal (CTRL + ALT + F1)\n2) Login with your username & password\n3) sudo rm .Xauthority\n4) sudo shutdown -r now\n", "Q: Cursor style changed in Unity after installing Sugar DE I have been testing different desktop environments on my Ubuntu 14.04, and have at several occasions experienced that themes, splash screens etc. have changed.

Is there an easy way to change the cursor back, preferably without changing it in sugar too?\n\nA: Problem solved. In case anybody else experiences the same problem, you can change the cursor look with these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run \"Customize look and feel\" (search for it in the menu).\n\n*Click on \"Mouse cursor\".  \n\n\nHere, you can chose between a lot of options, including the one you perhaps got stuck with after the installation of an additional DE.\n", "Q: Can't install debian package I'm trying to create and install my own deb package: fotorator_1.0-1.deb.\nWhen I try to use gdebi fotorator_1.0-1.deb, I get following error:\nroot@kiosk-HP:~/Desktop# gdebi fotorator_1.0-1.deb \nReading package lists...

I have installed Ubuntu 15.10, but i assigned only 4 GB to the /home partition. Now I figured that it's so small because Ubuntu saves files on home! Can i change it inside Ubuntu with some program or something else? I mean to get space from /root and move it to /home?(sorry if my English are bad! :) )\n\nA: You can use gparted and install it via terminal(Ctrl+Alt+T)\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nVia using this you can resize partitions as per your needs.\nHere is a youtube video for this\n\nA: 4Gb can be more than enough. Options:\n\n\n*\n\n*symlink the directories in /home/$USER/ to a another partition.\n\n*edit .config/users-dirs.dirs to point the directories to another partition.\n\n\nOtherwise you can also resize your partition. Boot from a live dvd or from a gparted live dvd and use gparted to resize your partition: make 1 smaller, add it to /home/. You need a live session because you can not alter partitions that are in use.\n", "Q: Live USB and Windows - Using Chroot On Linux you can use the commands below on a Ubuntu live USB to get root access onto the hard drive.

And Grub legacy does not find Ubuntu install out-of-the-box.\nTo restore Ubuntu's boot, all you have to do is re-install grub2.\nDo this:\nBoot using Ubuntu's Live CD\nOpen Nautilus, and double-click Ubuntu's partition. Take note of its mount point directory (if you labeled the partitions, it will be something like /media/label\nNow open terminal and issue:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/your-ubuntu-label /dev/sda\n\nYou may boot into Ubuntu now.\nIf you want to add Fedora 15 to Ubuntu's (grub2) boot list, do this:\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Cifs Share keeps asking for password and is slow I followed the directions here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently\nto mount a windows share and it works as expected. Some issues that I am having is one it is very slow when I load the share in the file explorer. In Windows it is almost instant. Another issue I am having is when I edit a file and I Ctrl+S to save the file it asks me for a password every time. I enter my user password for Ubuntu not the Windows share password. I have tried to search Google and haven't come up with any answers. I tried disabling the keychain but keep getting the password dialog. Hopefully someone here can help me solve the issues I am having. \n\nA: As for the slow file access: I don't know which Samba version you are using, but I suggest to specify the SMB protocol version within the corresponding fstab entry (which is not the case in the examples that the linked article on wiki.ubuntu.com provides). Older Samba versions use SMB1 as standard protocol. Using the outdated SMB1 might slow down folder access, and there are security issues with SMB1. Add vers=2.1 to the options in the fstab:\n//servername/sharename  /media/windowsshare  cifs  username=shareusername,manyotheroptions=andtheirvalues,vers=2.1  0  0\n\nIf this option is not accepted, it might be necessary to update your cifs-utils. It's most likely that your Windows device supports at least v2.1, but to be safe, you could check on that as well.\nAs for the password that you have to enter for writing access:\nThis problem can occur if the username specified in the fstab differs from your Ubuntu username. You could add a share user to your NAS, named identically to the Ubuntu user, and enter this username into the fstab. (There are probably many other approaches to this problem, but this is one of the simplest solutions.)\n", "Q: Why Ubuntu 14.04 not Sending Correct Awakening Signal to a Display after sleep?

Every time I boot up my laptop I can see the Ubuntu logo but then I get a black screen.

Now, I'm a bit of a noob, I've played around with Ubuntu on a VM but nothing too in-depth. \nI've used Ubuntu and it runs quite nicely on my VM so it's definitely a good choice imo. \nQuick edit: As a student Office is super useful, even though LibreOffice is also good but for Excel and etc I do think Office is the best choice. How does Wine handle it? About gaming does Wine give a good performance?\nWhere are my laptop's specs, if it helps:\nIntel® Core™ i5-6200U Dual-Core 2.3 GHz\n8GB ram \nHDD SATA 750GB\n7200RPM 2.5\" Intel® HD Graphics 520 + NVIDIA® GeForce® 940M with 2GB DDR3 VRAM\n\n\nA: Wine is good but not as pure windows, if you need need softwares that is not supported on Ubuntu why you should use one? Plus you already have windows installed.\nBut if you want Ubuntu for whatever reason, you can install it alongside windows and use them both, here is the video link, about how to install it.\nUbuntu is pretty good, but Office is not one of the best side of it. Actually Ubuntu is good when you are beginner programmer, or web developer since it is open source and you can understand how everything works.\nAlthough, Ubuntu is one of the best gaming linux distro, but not better then windows, at this point.\n\nA: I would use 14.0.4 until 16.0.4 comes out as it is an LTS version and therefore more stable.\nEDIT: At least for me (GTX650), Ubuntu 15.10 didn't play well with the Nvidia drivers. (Random graphical glitches, among others)\nOffice in Wine - depends on the version. (You could also use Office Online) For information on your specific version, Check out the Wine HQ\nGaming in Wine - unless it's something like \"Minesweeper,\" forget about it.\n\nA: Ubuntu will most definitely work on your computer.\nI see a potential for issues with your graphics, as NVIDIA isn't stable on Ubuntu, but there's not much chance of failure. If you have any issues, do a quick search and you'll most likely find an answer. If not, ask a question here.\nUnfortunately, Microsoft Office does not run in Wine. Trust me, I've tried; 2010, 2013 and 2016 all crash with some issue. It seems MS has done its best to stop Ubuntu users from using Office products. You'll have to dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows or settle for LibreOffice.\nGaming, judging from discussions on this site and on various forums, is a hit-and-miss situation. You might get great performance with one game and not with another. You might have terrible performance while someone else has amazing FPS. It seems mostly random, but go ahead and try.\nAs for the Ubuntu version: since you have NVIDIA, I'm going to suggest against following Android Dev's advice. 14.04, while LTS, does not have the newer drivers or kernel sometimes needed for NVIDIA graphics to work. Especially with newer cards, you'll want to get the latest version. Once 16.04 comes out, you can upgrade easily.\nI hope this helped. Leave a comment with any questions.\n\nA: Here's what I do . I use Ubuntu for most of my work . For things which runs best in Windows(such as Office , Games ) , I run them using VMWare. As you have 8 gigs of RAM , I don't think you'll face any problem running Windows parallely in a virtual environment. You can share the physical drive or locations with your guest OS , i.e. Windows and use those locations in a very normal manner . Once you get used to Ubuntu and it's customization capabilities , you'll never return to windows. Hope this helps in your transition. \n", "Q: no-proxy includes ports?

I am trying to get my back up onto the server so that i can then regain ssh. How do you guys think i should do it. I really lost and about to give up hope. \n\nA: You have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Physical access. Go up to it and log in. Or reboot into rescue mode and fix your hosts, set yourself a password, etc. Or boot into a live environment, fix the files or chroot and and set yourself a password. Many options here.\n\n*Virtual physical access. If the server isn't physically yours —ie you rent it— your hosts might be able to give you virtual physical access. You'll have to prove you own it but many hosts can give you out-of-band access to a TTY or straight up root access.\n\n*Help from your host. Many hosts are understanding. As long as you can prove its your machine (they can email/phone the billing contact) I don't see what incentive they have to not help. A good technician will be able to see an email begging \"please can you fix my SSH configuration?!\" and be able to help directly.\nShort of that you're asking how to circumvent Ubuntu's built in security.

There'll be a preview at some point and then they'll roll it into the main version. This was only just announced a few days ago. Even once this is out, it will rely on you having a license for the 2016+, and your code being compatible with SQL Server 2016.\nI've no idea when that'll release either. Until that's a real thing, your only real options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pick another database tech (MySQL, Postgres, etc). If you have a tightly coupled system running raw SQL commands, chances are this will require some additional development time.\n\n*Virtualise a copy of Windows within Ubuntu and install SQL Server on that. Of course this comes with all the negatives of running Windows in the first place.\nOther Windows applications can sometimes be run through intermediate libraries like Wine but that likely won't be an option for SQL Server because it has too many server dependencies that just aren't implemented in Wine. You'll need a real copy of Windows to run a real copy of SQL Server.\n\nA: Nowadays you can install SQL Server on GNU/linux, but for now, only for Red Hat and Ubuntu and is still on Beta.\nThe following links tell you \n\nHow to install SQL Server in Ubuntu and Red Hat\n\nInstall SQL Server on Red Hat\nInstall SQL Server on Ubuntu\nI installed that on a Linux Mint 18 which is based on Ubuntu 16.04, and have no problems yet.

There is no reason to ssh out of the server they access.\nAny advice?\n\nA: The simplest way would be remove openssh-clients package.

All SITE commands, SITE CHMOD included, are non-standard extensions. So your FTP server might support recursion. It probably doesn't. You'll only find out by figuring out what server it is you're connecting to and then reading its documentation.\nHowever as a workaround, you could just use a client that allowed you to select multiple files and perform batch operations on them. It isn't recursion but it's like recursion.\nI'm thinking clients like Filezilla. Select all your files, right click them and go to properties and change all their permissions at once.\n", "Q: HP Pavilion P257NL Overheating I'd like to dual boot my HP Pavilion 15 P257NL with Windows 7.\nI tried installing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but it was getting very hot (only on Ubuntu, it stayed cool in Windows 7). I tried Googling, and I found bumblebee and some other programs such as thermaid but they didn't solve the problem. So I updated to Ubuntu 15.10. The heating problem was still there, although reduced a bit. Then, I tried another distro (Fedora 23) but it didn't help at all. I read online that this is likely to be caused by the dual video card, so here's my PC configuration:\nIntel Core i7-5500U\nIntel HD Graphics 5500\nNVIDIA GeForce 840M\n\nI know that there are a lot of questions about this problem but none of the answers solved my problem.

There are several programs that can be used to create USB flash drives from .iso files, and they don't all work perfectly, especially for EFI-bootable systems. Based on posts I've seen, Rufus seems to be the most reliable and Pen Drive Linux/YUMI is useless for creating EFI-mode disks. See these comments of mine for more details on my own experiences with several tools.\nYou could also try using the \"BOOT FROM EFI FILES\" option you mention. Once you select that option, you should see a primitive file selector. (Details vary from one EFI to another.) Browse to your boot medium and find the EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi file and launch it.\n\nA: I guessing the fedora installation image on the  usb drive was an UEFI compatible image, the ubuntu one may not.\nTry to find an option in the BIOS settings to boot legacy devices. It may called \"legacy mode\" or \"CSM mode\".

It will prepare the system for hibernate by storing all memory content to disk and then goes into suspend. The suspended state gives the advantage that it can resume very quick and because it also prepared for hibernate the system is also able to start when the power is lost. \nMore info here:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/pm-action.8.html\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu missing from HP boot menu I have a HP laptop with Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 dual booted. I used to use F9 key to enter boot menu and chose Ubuntu and then GRUB would appear where I would chose Ubuntu again. This was working fine all this while. Either a hardware change or a Windows update has caused the Ubuntu option to go missing from the boot menu itself.\nHow do I fix this and boot into Ubuntu again?\n\nA: I fixed it by making a live USB, selecting try ubuntu, and reinstalling grub by using boot repair. Boot repair worked like magic. All I had to do was to select the option 'Recommended Repair'. Thanks for the answers\n\nA: If you can boot into Windows, try using the EasyUEFI program. If it shows the ubuntu entry, you should be able to activate it and move it to the top of the list. If it does not show that entry, you might still be able to use EasyUEFI to re-create it, but I'm not sure of the details of how to do this with EasyUEFI. You'd want to create an entry for EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP). With any luck the user interface will make it obvious how to do this.\nIf the entry is completely missing and EasyUEFI doesn't do the trick, you should be able to do it with bcdedit in Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate Command Prompt in the Start menu, right-click it, and select Run as Administrator. This action opens a Command Prompt window with administrative privileges.\n\n*Type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi.\n\n*Type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} description \"ubuntu\".\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nGRUB should come up as the default boot entry; or at the very least, you should see a new ubuntu entry in the EFI's boot manager.\nNote that some HPs, especially older ones, have flaky EFIs that can ignore or forget EFI boot manager entries. You may be running into problems related to this -- but the fact that it used to work for you means it should be possible to get it working again. If you continue to have problems after using EasyUEFI and/or bcdedit, you might want to try entering the firmware setup utility and locating the option to reset all values to their defaults. With any luck, that will clear away whatever cruft is causing problems. The down side to this is that you'll probably need to re-register GRUB (using EasyUEFI or bcdedit, as just described; or the Linux tool efibootmgr) after it's done.\n\nA: on windows try installing partition wizard .. open it .. select your entire hard drive! then from the options bar on the left select: rebuilt MBR\n", "Q: Doveconf -n not empty after fresh install - how to update the default, if possible? After a fresh install of dovecot in Ubuntu 15.10, which was done after having purged the old conf, I still have a non empty doveconf -n output, but the man says that it should only output what is different from the default.

But I only get true 144 Hz in games (in this case CSGO) if I completely unplug the 60 Hz monitor before starting CSGO.\nCould it be that Unity uses the lower refresh rate when both displays are plugged in? I can verify that the monitor is running in 144 Hz via the monitors info menu (as opposed to not setting it via xrandr), but it still feels not like 144 Hz.\nUsing Google I could not find a solution yet.\n\nA: This has nothing to do with Ubuntu but with the hardware itself. I could infer that you're running on non-identical output ports (1 HDMI and 1 DP or 1 VGA and 1 HDMI...) on one graphics adapter (Before the comment and subsequent edit). \nIf you want true independent refresh rates, you will need either one the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*An additional graphics card to run the existing monitor\n\n*A replacement monitor that runs at 140 Hz on the existing graphics card.\n\n\nA: I don't have a lot of experience with it, but if you use vsync for the 60hz monitor it seems to also cap the 144hz monitor.

To simply test if any output is produced, use grep:\nsort file1 file2 | uniq --unique | grep -q .\n\nIn this case, since the directories are different, a bit more processing is needed:\nawk -F/ '{print $1, $NF}' | sort | uniq --unique | awk '!a[$2]++{print $2}'\n\nOr, entirely in awk:\nawk -F/ 'FNR == NR {hash[$NF] = $1; next} hash[$NF] != $1 {print $NF}'\n\nIn both cases, you get just the filenames whose hashes differ.\n", "Q: Festival error when trying to use SayText When I enter Festival via the command:\nfestival -q\n\nand attempt to utilize SayText, I get the following error:\nfestival> (SayText \"hello\")\nSIOD ERROR: unbound variable : SayText\n\nWhy does this happen?

I've spent the last few days working on getting the data back. Below I will outline my process and my question will be at the end. Keep in mind this is with a windows 10 system and the problem first came up due to a sudden power loss.\nThe error my computer showed when booting up was a 0xc00000e9 boot/BCD error. I ran startup repair and did chkdsk C:\\f and it said that the drive was in RAW format. This is weird... I never reformatted the drive, and I couldn't even if I wanted to since it's the primary drive. I tried doing the scanos command and it came up with 0 installations.\nNext, I booted a live disk of Ubuntu and ran the testdisk application to analyze the drive and its partitions. When I did it showed 3 partitions each of them being ntfs WTF? Windows System Recovery just told me it was in a RAW format. Interesting note: Windows PE couldn't detect the drive, but ubuntu could.\nAnyway next I ran photorec and recovered a bunch of files, after some digging I concluded all my data was safe, I just couldn't access it. The problem is that photorec doesn't include the various file formats I need recovered. Thus, I searched for another tool and came across R-Studio data recovery and UFS explorer standard recovery both linux versions. I was able to use these programs to explore the whole disk!!! The whole file structure was the same, none of my data was damaged and I was able to recover quite a lot! Here comes the problem, both R-Studio data recovery and UFS explorer standard recovery can only recover a max file size of 256kb with the demo version, the full version can do any file size but it costs a lot!\nSo my question is: Is there any program that can recover all my files from the drive? It's not even recovery per se because my files are safely in the drive, I just can't boot into windows on it, or access the files from ubuntu without either R-Studio data recovery or UFS explorer standard recovery, which only do a max 256kb file with the demo version. Also it's very odd that Windows System Recovery says the drive is RAW, but TestDisk says it is ntfs partition.\n\nA: Get another drive >= your SSD in capacity.\nThen run sudo dd if=\"/dev/sdx\" of=\"/dev/sdy\" Where x is your SSD's mount point and y is you secondary drive's mount point.\n(That could take a loooong time BTW)\nThen, once all your data is cloned to the other drive, you can mess around with it, and not worry about corrupting it trying to get your data back. If you corrupt it, just re-dd from your SSD.\n", "Q: Dell Inspiron 7559 doesn't work with ubuntu linux I bought this new laptop and there are tons of problems in installing ubuntu. \nThere is a not full solution here:\nDual Boot on Dell Inspiron 7559 laptop\nIt doesn't work for me cause I ended up where I cannot do what the solution says.\nLet me start from the beginning.\nI used a USB stick with the latest version (ubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64.iso) and after many tries I could install ubuntu.\nI don't know why but the loading screen and the passages through installation went through smoothly all of a sudden, till the really end when I had to reboot manually cause i couldn't move the mouse and click \"Restart Now\". What ever..\nThe installation left 500Gb to windows 10 and created a new partition of 500Gb for ubuntu.\nI tried to boot the new installed Ubuntu but nothing: black screen.\nI booted in recovery mode and I went to driver settings and I set nVidia ones instead of the wrong ones.\nSo finally when I rebooted Ubuntu normally it worked.\nI installed some stuff and did full updates of the system then I shutted down ubuntu.\nAfter using Windows 10 a bit I booted again ubuntu it gave me the following error:\nkernel panic-not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown block(0,0)\n\nOk then I looked it up and I found out I had to start ubuntu from liveUSB and run some commands like: \nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\nThe problem is  I cannot anymore! liveUSB doesn't start as it get stucked in ubuntu loading screen! \nThe laptop doesn't even have a cd reader I can only use USB!\nThe recovery mode of ubuntu gives kernel problem as well.\nThe BIOS setup is already changed to:\nSecure Boot = [Disabled]\nLoad Legacy Option Rom = [Disabled]\n\nAlso I tried in grub panel pressing 'e' to write nomodeset at the end of linux line. I did it everywhere (installed grub panel and the liveUSB one) hoping that was allowing me to boot something but it never worked.\nPlease read the answer in the old thread to have a full picture.\nHow do I do what they say here if I have no access at all to the prompt?\nDual Boot on Dell Inspiron 7559 laptop\nShould I go on Windows 10, delete ubuntu partition and start over?\n\nA: Might not be the right answer for you, but:\nI have same laptop and I bought M.2 SSD, installed Windows there and then installed Xubuntu on the HDD, with bootloader installed on HDD (/dev/sdb)\nXubuntu works just fine.\nSamsung or Crucial M.2 2280 models are quite cheap nowadays and the performance is worth to buy it. Anyway if you want to use your Ubuntu primarily you can still install it on SSD (don't forget to select your bootloader on the correct drive) and leave Windows on HDD :)\n\nA: Let me share my experience with Dell Inspiron 7559 + Windows 10.\nFirst I had Windows 10 GPT (UEFI) preinstalled. Had the same splash screen freezing problem. Overcame it by specifying acpi=off kernel parameter (same as you did with nomodeset, but that didn't work for me, whereas acpi=off worked). I think I would be able to install Ubuntu  then.\nBut I suddenly got a silly issue with the screen - I've probably held F11 somewhere and that turned the screen off, so I could not see neither BIOS nor Dell logo. So I put my laptop to the tech service and they've worked it out, but also reinstalled my Windows 10. This time that was MBR (legacy, non-UEFI).\nAnd with the Windows MBR, Ubuntu installed like a charm. \nUpon Ubuntu installation, I had the following setting in my BIOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot List Option: UEFI (I left it unchanged, not sure if this setting even took effect)\n\n*Secure Boot: disabled (I disabled it myself because many people reported issues on it)\n\n*Load Legacy Option Rom: disabled (left untouched)\n\n\nAlso, my BIOS was of the latest version (I followed dell.com website instructions to update BIOS).\nAfter Ubuntu installation, the only issue I had is not being able to shut down properly. Resolved this by going to System Settings > Software & Updates > Additional Drivers and selecting this proprietary NVIDIA driver instead of an opensource one:\n\"NVIDIA binary driver - version 361.42 from nvidia-361 (proprietary, tested)\"\nNow it works well. I am able to dual-boot Windows because I have it in MBR. I know this is probably not your case, but you may try acpi=off solution or migrating your Windows to MBR (if you know how to do it - 'cause I am not an expert there :).\n", "Q: Good system for writing coding excerpts (possible cloud based) I am using Ubuntu for some time, and 99% of time I am using Goggle drive Documents for writing code excerpts.\nHowever, Google experience, although super fast when searching, works quite slow when opening Google docs.

The script runs, but tcpdump does not terminate and continues to run at the command line, even after printing some of its exit output.\n(Note: this script requires sudo due to tcpdump and kill).\n#!/bin/bash  \n\n#start a process in the background (it happens to be a TCP HTTP sniffer on  the loopback interface, for my apache server):   \n\ntcpdump -i lo -w dump.pcap 'port 80' &  \n\n#.....other commands that send packets to tcpdump.....\n\n#now interrupt the process.  get its PID:  \npid=$(ps -e | pgrep tcpdump)  \necho $pid  \n\n#interrupt it:  \nkill -2 $pid\n\n\nA: I found part of the answer on this Stack Overflow post.\nTo summarize, tcpdump was buffering its output before writing to the output file, and this caused issues when the script attempted to interrupt it.  Adding the -U (\"flush\") option to tcpdump fixes this.\nAlso necessary were a sleep command immediately after issuing tcpdump to allow it to initialize, and also before killing it, to allow it to write to the file:\n#!/bin/bash  \n\n#start a process in the background (it happens to be a TCP HTTP sniffer on  the loopback interface, for my apache server):   \n\ntcpdump -U -i lo -w dump.pcap 'port 80' &   \nsleep 5\n\n#.....other commands that send packets to tcpdump.....\n\n#now interrupt the process.  get its PID:  \npid=$(ps -e | pgrep tcpdump)  \necho $pid  \n\n#interrupt it:  \nsleep 5\nkill -2 $pid\nFor reference, from man tcpdump, under the -U option:\n\nIf  the -w option is specified, make the saved raw packet output \n``packet-buffered''; i.e., as each packet is saved,\nit will be written to the output file, rather than being written only\n when the output buffer fills.\n\n\nAfter this, the script worked fine.\n\nA: until [ $x -gt 13 ];\ndo tcpdump -i $1 -w /home/paul/chanscan/chan-$x-$now.pcapng -e -s 0 subtype probe-req or subtype probe-resp -v & sleep 10; \nsleep 2;\n\nHere is a direct kill in less code:\nkill $(ps -e | pgrep tcpdump);\n\nAs you can see the instead of other variables I just killed the process 2 seconds after the 10 second sleep. The script i did contains a 10 second scan for every channel between 1-13 this was for probe requests and responses so, importance on killing the tcpdump running process was critical to start the next scan.\nI always give around 2 seconds for using kill or switching channels etc. the answers above are all as equally good just thought I would show you a simplified answer that meets all needs in less code. hope this helps someone out. :-)\n\nA: You can enter the command below:\nkillall tcpdump\n\nThis is relevant if you had a continuous tcpdump running and wanted to end that process. Nothing else is affected.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 desktop freezes upon login So I've been using this distro(with Unity user interface) for a couple of months, and I decided to set up the LAMP and even use vsftpd for my wordpress website.

What do we mean by the empty file ? Be aware that there are files with non-printable characters. Here's an example:\n$> touch myFile.txt                                                            \n$> echo '' > myFile.txt\n$> du myFile.txt\n4   myFile.txt\n\nLook ! I've echoed empty space into the file, and yet it reports some size in bytes ? how can that be ?! Well, we've still written a single newline to the file.\nAs shown in this brilliant answer, files on disks are in chunks of 4096 bytes. When we write just a few bytes to the disk, the operating system still allocates a chunk of 4096 bytes. So technically file here is empty from human-readable point of view, and yet - it contains bytes. \nWe can create reference to a file , which will be 0 bytes, but once we try to fill it with any data, we'll give it 4096 bytes\n$> touch myFile2.txt                                                           \n$> du myFile2.txt\n0   myFile2.txt\n\nBut why directory is 4096 bytes ?  directories are sort of lists. Once you create a directory, even empty one, it holds information (for those interested in C programming language, that's dirent structure , which contains inode number, record length, type, and name; lookup dirent.h).\nSo even though directory may not have files, it will contain information about itself.\n\nA: You can also use stat:\n$ touch file\n$ stat --format '%F' file\nregular empty file\n$ echo 'a' > file\n$ stat --format '%F' file\nregular file\n\n\nA: ...or this:\nfind /dir/to/file -maxdepth 1 -name file_name -empty\n\n", "Q: unallocated space added under sda3, how to add it to sda5 now (gparted) I have an SSD with unallocated space of 18gb, and / directory of 10.40 gb, and the rest is being used for windows.

Any suggestions?\n\nA: Does the file really have a ? in the filename, or is it a non-printing character that ls shows as a ??\n$ touch $'a\\ab' 'a?b'\n$ ls\na?b  a?b\n\nOne file has an ASCII BELL character in the name, and the other has a plain old question mark.\nNewer versions of ls can show it special characters in a clearer form by default:\n$ touch $'b\\aa'\n$ ls\n'b'$'\\a''a'\n\nls -q is how older versions of ls show non-printing characters by default. So, if you just do ls in any current version of Ubuntu, you're likely to see just question marks.\nTry, instead, one of:\n$ ls -b\na?b  a\\ab\n$ printf \"%q\\n\" *\na\\?b\n$'a\\ab'\n\nIf the output from either of these don't have question marks, then the filename doesn't have question marks.\nYou can use the output of printf for deleting:\nrm a\\?b\nrm $'a\\ab'\n\nOr rely on tab completion:\n$ rm a<tab>\na?b   a^Gb \n\nIf it shows ^G, then press CtrlV then CtrlG to enter it. Or tell bash to cycle through tab completions:\n$ bind tab:menu-complete\n$ rm a<tab>\n$ rm a\\?b<tab>\n$ rm a^Gb\n\nIn either case, using rm a?b could work, but is dangerous. It would match all filenames starting with a, ending in b and having one character in between:\n$ touch acb; printf \"%q\\n\" a?b\na\\?b\n$'a\\ab'\nacb\n\nSo, if you do rm a?b (or worse, rm a*b), you could end up deleting files you didn't intend to.\n\nA: The ? is most likely another non-ASCII symbol that your terminal program is unable to display so it displays ?. This is easily proven - you can execute touch ?.mkv and rm ?.mkv - both command execute just fine.\nFiles like that are easily deleted using a GUI file manager.\nAlternatively you could try using wildcards. If command:\nls pathtofile\\FewLetters*.mkv\n\nlists a single file you can safely run:\nrm pathtofile\\FewLetters*.mkv`.\n\nFinally you could try the harder but surer way as described in Can not delete files containing special characters in the file name as pointed by Android Dev above.\n\nA: rm -f 'path?.mkv' works for me. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the ' ' does disable the functionality of some special characters such as ? .

I am following instructions from this web page: How to install Moodle on Ubuntu\n\nA: When you use you own desktop that adress tends to be \"http://localhost\" or \"https://localhost\" if you also activated SSL. Have a look in the hosts file on your system with ...\nmore /etc/hosts\n\nI would expect you to have only 'localhost' here.  If not read on ...\nIf you have your desktop open to the world and this is intended for usages by 'others' on the web that visit your desktop this can also be \"http://{your_external_ip_adress}\" and when you bought a website address it will be \"http://{website_address}\".\nYou are suppose to add \"/moodle\" to the one that applies to you. I would expect \"http://localhost/moodle\". \n", "Q: How to package a systemd service?

I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04, and I did it. In the tutorial I was following, the guy told to install efibootmgr to change the boot order, to put Ubuntu at the first position instead of Windows Boot Manager. Curiously, Ubuntu was already at the first position, so I didn't do anything. I restarted my computer, and it was working fine. I had options to boot both to Windows Boot Manager and Ubuntu. I picked Windows first just to test, and it was everything ok. But my surprise was when I restarted my computer again to try Ubuntu. It just booted automatically to Windows 10. I tried to use the test version in the flash disk again to access efibootmgr, but now, Ubuntu has just disappeared from the list, so i can't configure it again to change the boot order.

Thus is a picture of both of my hard-drives:\n\nMy C Drive and my D drive. I want to put Ubuntu onto my D Drive. Now my question here is if i do install onto my D Drive then how should I do it in order to retain use of the drive. I intend to partition about 60 gigs from it. Now after doing that I should still have about 830 gigs left. I want to still be able to use that in Windows. So how and will I be able to retain use of the drive after Installing? I have installed once before and I believe i did it wrong because not only could Windows not recognize my D drive but I also lost all the data on it. \nMy computer is a Lenovo Y700\nIt is a UEFI (I believe i got that right).\n\nA: If Windows is installed at your \"C\" drive, and your \"D\" drive is empty. Just partition the \"D\" drive, make a 60 GB partition at the end of the disk or at the beginning, and make a partition for the free space too.\nYou can do so via GParted tool from an Ubuntu live USB/CD.\nIf the 60GB partition end at the beginning of the disk, Ubuntu will be the new \"D\" drive, and the free space partition will be now \"E\" whenever you are back at Windows.\nPay attention when partitioning because normally Windows can only be installed on MBR partition tables, Linux however can be installed on GPT and MBR partition tables. Both W. and Linux can use both types of partition tables to write and read data.\nWhen partitioning, after choosing the partition table, pick EXT4 for Ubuntu partition and NTFS for the free space partition.\n\nHowever if your \"D\" drive isn't empty and you would like to preserve the files already present on it, you must leave the partition table format as is and just shrink the present partition to make enough space for a new partition. You can do so via GParted too.\n", "Q: Upgrade IBus or \"export IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE=1\" to fix IntelliJ/Android Studio input issue When using IntelliJ or Android Studio, the application gives a warning that using an IBus version prior to 1.5.11 may cause input problems.

I am trying to create a network using 3 virtual Ubuntu machines (master, slave1, slave2).\nI hope posting this question here is acceptable. I'm not sure if the problem lies within Virtualbox configuration or inside my virtual machines. I expect the latter, so I asked my question here.\nHost: Windows 7, using Virtualbox 4.2.8, network type is set to NAT. All machines have different MAC addresses. My VMs only need to communicate to each other, host machine serves as router.\nmaster: Ubuntu 14.04\nslave1: Ubuntu 14.04\nslave2: Ubuntu 14.04\nInstruction I'm trying to follow: http://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/running-an-mpi-cluster-within-a-lan/\nI want to create an SSH key on master, share it with slave1 and slave2.

This way you LAN side router should take care of the routing. \n\nA: I had to use \"Internal network\" as suggested by others, VMs could still not see one another. The problem was in advanced settings, I had to enable promiscuous mode, allow VMs. I had used a network of physical machines before, so this was something new. Once I found out VMs were blocking each other, only had to find out why.\n\n", "Q: Screen resolution is not saved after reboot I'm using Xubuntu 15.10 on my GA-C847N motherboard.\nI can set appropriate resolution using the following command:\nsudo xrandr -s 1440x900\nHowever, each time after machine is rebooted I'm getting some weird distorted resolution and I need to change it manually again.

How do I preserve the resolution. Maybe I need to pre-generate the xorg.conf file? How do I do that for my configuration?\nI used to have NVIDIA descrete graphic adapters and I'm not familiar with embedded ones.\n\nA: If local screen settings are not \"surviving\" a reboot or re- log in, your issue is almost certainly the result of a bug. For that reason, it is very hard, if possible at all, to solve without a workaround, since the issue occurs locally, and possible global settings are simply overruled with incorrect local settings.\nTo solve (workaround) the issue, we need to (re-) confirm our own settings on log in, by adding a command to Startup Applications.\nWhat to do\nIf your screen is set correctly when using the command\nxrandr -s 1440x900\n\n(no need for sudo), just add the following to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10 && xrandr -s 1440x900\"\n\nIt is a workaround, but it works. The sleep 10 is needed to make sure the screen setting will not be overruled by local procedures on log in. ten seconds after log in, your screen will be set correctly automatically.\nPossibly you need to play a bit with the 10 seconds.\nTo make it work for all users\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=set_screen\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10 && xrandr -s 1440x900\"\nType=Application\n\nsave it as set_screen.desktop\n\n*Copy the file into /etc/xdg/autostart\nNow the command will run for all users during log in.\n\nA: This is an old thread.

It wasn't until I did a \nps -eaf | grep chrome\n\nin a terminal that I saw that part of it was still running. Did a \npkill chrome\n\nthen relaunched Chrome, and all was good.\n\nA: Try the following:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cursor_themes#XDG_specification\nYou should then edit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini, replacing the cursor_theme_name with the chosen one:\n~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n[Settings]\ngtk-cursor-theme-name=cursor_theme_name\n\nIn my experience, this configuration change fixed the cursor theme in Chromium-based browsers to the one specified.\n\nA: Edit the text file /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme.\nReplace its contents with the .theme of the cursor you want.\nIn this case, your cursor of choice is /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/cursor.theme.\nTherefore, replace the contents of /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme with those of /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/cursor.theme.\nRestart Chrome.\n\nA: When you have chromium installed as a snap package, that might be the issue\nbug report\nAt the time of writing, this bug isn't fixed yet. Workaround is to replace the snap by a regular package:\n\n\n*\n\n*First make sure you are logged into an account so that your settings are synced and can be restored later\n\n*In Ubuntu 18.04's software center, remove Chromium (snap package) and\nand install Chromium web browser (regular package)\n\n*Launch the browser and log in to your account to restore bookmarks etc.\n\n\nA: I too had the same problem.\nThe following steps worked for me\n\n*\n\n*Kill all Google Chrome windows.\n\n*Relaunch Google Chrome.\n\nAfter doing this, the correct set of cursors were displayed in Google Chrome.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to group applications used together?

I would like to remove ubuntu and install it in virtual-box within windows.\nI am afraid to remove ubuntu partions fearing windows may not boot after it. Currently I get ubuntu Grub screen on booting computer. How do I get my windows bootloader back so that I don't see grub screen again. Once I am able to do that I can delete ubuntu partions and merge it back with windows partitions.\nPlease help to get me my windows bootloader back.\nThanks :)\n\nA: Before you uninstall Ubuntu, you should do one or both of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove GRUB's files -- On an EFI-based computer, GRUB lives on the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu. Ubuntu stores GRUB in the EFI/ubuntu directory on this partition, so you can remove it by typing sudo rm -rf /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu in Ubuntu. This will not affect the currently-running Ubuntu, but once you shut down, you will be unable to reboot into Ubuntu! (If you change your mind at this point, you can re-install GRUB or some other boot loader in any of several ways.)\n\n*Move Windows to the top of the EFI's boot list -- Instead of (or in addition to) removing GRUB, you can alter the EFI boot order. There are several ways to do this, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*efibootmgr in Ubuntu -- You can type sudo efibootmgr to see the BootOrder variable and all the Boot#### entries to which it refers. You can then alter the BootOrder variable by using the -o option, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 4,2,A to set the system to try Boot0004 first, followed by Boot0002 and then Boot000A. The appropriate order depends on what's entered in the current list, so you should not simply use 4,2.A; that's just an example.\n\n*EasyUEFI in Windows -- The third-party EasyUEFI tool does the same thing that efibootmgr does, but with a GUI. Thus, you can delete the ubuntu entry or move it down the list of priorities.\n\n*Your firmware -- Some, but not all, EFIs enable you to adjust the boot order from their own user interfaces. You'd hit Delete, Enter, or a function key to enter the setup utility, find the option to adjust the boot order, and do so in whatever way the firmware supports. Unfortunately, there's no standardization of this, so I can't be more precise in how to do it. In fact, as I've already mentioned, not all EFIs provide this functionality.\n\n\n\nWith the exception of using the firmware, it's best if you do this before you delete the Ubuntu partition. If you delete the Ubuntu partition first, you're likely to get a grub> prompt when you boot. If that happens, exiting from GRUB or using the computer's built-in boot manager may enable you to boot to Windows, whereupon you can delete the GRUB files or use EasyUEFI to recover permanently.\n", "Q: bash: WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs: No such file or directory I installed python virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper on ubuntu 15.10 following the answer at How to set up and use a virtual python environment in Ubuntu?.

I installed apache2, but I couldn't change charset and language - when I went to try and edit the configuration files, the files were not present in /etc/apache2, which was an empty folder.\nWhere are httpd.conf and the other configuration files?  Have their locations changed in the Apache version on 15.10?\n\nA: The location for Apache configuration files has not changed - it's still /etc/apache2/....\nGiven your comments in response to my initial poke in the comments, it sounds like your Apache conf files were erased, which is a bad thing.  Or you have a broken package, which explains the configuration files not existing.\n\nWe can usually repair the defaults by reinstalling whatever folder contains the configurations.  Though, sometimes we have to do a complete reinstall of Apache in its entirety, by purging the existing installation and reinstalling.\nFirst try: Package reinstall\nThis will reinstall the apache2 package, which I believe contains the default configuration setups; this should install new copies of configs.\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall apache2\n\nIf this fails, though, and there are not new copies of default configurations available in /etc/apache2, then we need to do a more forceful approach involving a removal and purge (to get rid of any leftover configs) and then a full reinstall of the Apache core packages...\nSecond try: Remove apache2, and reinstall\nsudo apt-get purge apache2 apache2-bin apache2-data apache2-utils\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-bin apache2-data apache2-utils\n\n", "Q: How to check if an LXD container runs unprivileged?

(setuid/setgid mapping magic)\n\nA: The page you linked to describes lxc not lxd. lxd is essentially a daemon process that provides access to lxc's features, in a higher-level/more-convenient way. I believe the answer for lxd is:\n$ lxc config get your-container-name security.privileged\n\nIf that shows \"true\", then the container is privileged, else not.\nPer stgraber's post you can also query the set of privileged containers by running:\n$ lxc list security.privileged=true\n\n\nA: It's also possible to check if a container is unprivileged from inside the LXD container by checking:\n\n*\n\n*/proc/self/uid_map\n\n*/proc/self/gid_map\nwhere it will show something like (root 0 mapped to user 1000000):\n# cat /proc/self/gid_map \n         0    1000000 1000000000\n# cat /proc/self/uid_map \n         0    1000000 1000000000\n\n(assuming /etc/subuid & /etc/subgid are correctly configured on the container host)\nThese values can be read by root or an unprivileged user.\n\n*\n\n*source\n", "Q: Installing on UEFI mode I'm trying to install Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 on a new Dell XPS 15 9550. First I found that the live boot system could not find the nvme/m.2 drive. By changing it to AHCI mode in the BIOS settings the live install can see it but the installation hangs at \"Preparing to install\".\nI read in another question that this can be caused by the installer getting confused by the partitions on the disk and that it works if you clear them off first.\nI opened Disks and see this:\n\nThis is my first install on a UEFI system and I'm not sure what's what. I'm not interested in Windows dual-boot, I want rid of Windows! I don't undertstand what the ESP/EFI partition does.\nDo I just wipe the entire disk or will that break something?!\nEDIT: an ubuntu wiki page says I must have a ESP partition. So should I delete all the other partitions except that one? (by delete the other partitions, I mean delete the pre-existing ones and create the ones I want)\n\nA: If you don't care about Windows and are happy with default Ubuntu partitioning, the \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" option while installing in either UEFI or Legacy mode is completely fine and is the easiest way. \nIf you want to manually partition your hard drive in UEFI then you can keep the Windows created ESP Partition or just create your own as the wiki says (recommended size is 200 MiB, ~300MB less than Windows). You can use GParted in Live mode if you prefer it.\nAlso while you still have Windows installed, extract its ProductKey \nbecause you've already paid for it.

Will edit if that changed it.\n\nA: If you want to have a really blank disk just do\ndd if=/dev/zero of=$YOUR_DEV bs=1M\n\nUnder normal conditions this is not necessary but it may be necessary to swipe out the beginning and the end of the disk, because there may be data of a secondary GPT at the end of the disk.\nSo what I do to clean a disk is:\nYOUR_DEV=/dev/sdX\ndd if=/dev/zero of=$YOUR_DEV bs=512 count=100\ndd if=/dev/zero of=$YOUR_DEV bs=512 seek=$(( $(blockdev --getsz $YOUR_DEV) - 100 )) count=100\n\nNow, no OS installer of my knowledge finds any old partitions nor any old installed OS and will setup the disk right correct to the BIOS- and OS-settings (MBR or GPT).\n\nA: Don't do the operation from a running system.\nBoot from the Ubuntu installation media.  \nOpen GParted and delete all partitions.\nClick on Apply ... then click on Device.\nSelect Create a new partition table.  \nSelect gpt when you have an EFI based BIOS.\nSelect msdos when you have a legacy BIOS.\nNow the whole disk is completely blank.\n\nA: You can delete all partitions of a disk instead of just formatting them using Gnome Disks as well.\nOf course this can only work on a disk that is not currently in use, i.e. all partitions have to be in an unmounted state and no swap may be used on this disk. In case you want to perform this on a disk that contains mount points needed by the running Ubuntu system, you can't proceed and have to boot from a live medium instead.\nLaunch gnome-disks, select the device to clear from the list on the left, then click the hamburger button in the top right corner of the window. From the appearing menu, chose Format disk....\nA small dialog window will appear. You have two settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase: Decide between \"overwrite existing data with zeroes (slow)\" and \"don't overwrite data (fast)\". If its for personal use only and you don't have to make sure that there's no chance of restoring pieces of data, it's okay to chose the fast method. Overwrite the data if you want it irreversibly gone. To install a new OS or create new partitions and format them, this doesn't make a difference.\n\n*Partitioning: Decide between \"Compatible with modern systems and hard disks > 2TB (GPT)\", \"Compatible with all systems and devices (MBR/DOS)\" and \"No partitioning (empty)\". Here you select the kind of partition table you want to create. I would recommend you to use MBR unless you have a reason to select a different one.\nThen click on Format..., enter your admin password and watch the progress bar.\n", "Q: What does the double slash mean in `${f// /_}`? I'm learning Bash, and I want to replace space characters with other \"non blank\" characters. I'm using a for loop:\nfor f in *\\ *; do mv \"$f\" \"${f// /_}\"; done\n\nMy question is, why are the double slash and the space in ${f// /_}? What does ${f// /_} do?\n\nA: The section \"{f// /_} means replace every space with and underscore.\nThis is using Bash parameter expansion, the variable f defined in the for f in *\\ *; will be run through for every match of shell expansion (globbing). Each time the filename found will become the value $f.\nThe parameter expansion works with the // meaning every occurrence of the character following // (space in this example), should be replaced by the character after / (underscore in this example).  \n\nA: Thats a replacement pattern using bash parameter expansion.\nIn ${f// /_}:\n\n\n*\n\n*The double slashes // are for replacing all occurrences of space with _, if you put one slash /, only first space is going to be replaced\n\n*The space is there because you are replacing space (with underscore)\nSo the pattern basically is:\n${parameter//find/replace}\n\nCheck man bash to get more idea.\nTo get to the Parameter Expansion section of man bash at once:\nLESS=+/'Parameter Expansion' man bash\n\n", "Q: Can't restore grub after reinstalling windows I was trying to restore the grub after I reinstalled windows, so I mounted the partition where ubuntu was installed but I got:\n$ sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\nmount: you must specify the filesystem type\n\nSo I did\n$ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda3 /mnt \nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda3,\n   missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n   In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n\nThen I tried the solution for bad superblocks:\n$ sudo e2fsck -f /dev/sda3\ne2fsck 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\ne2fsck: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while trying \nto open /dev/sda3\nCould this be a zero-length partition?\n\n$ sudo dumpe2fs /dev/sda3|grep -i superblock\ndumpe2fs 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\ndumpe2fs: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while \ntrying to open /dev/sda3\nCouldn't find valid filesystem superblock.\n\n$ sudo mke2fs -n /dev/sda3\nmke2fs 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\nmke2fs: inode_size (128) * inodes_count (0) too big for a\nfilesystem with 0 blocks, specify higher inode_ratio (-i)\nor lower inode count (-N).\n\nEdit2: And as Android Dev suggested (same using 8193)\n$ sudo e2fsck -f -b 32768 -y /dev/sda3\ne2fsck 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\ne2fsck: Invalid argument while trying to open /dev/sda3\n\nThe superblock could not be read or does not describe a valid ext2/ext3/ext4\nfilesystem.

You should be cautious, though; this type of recovery operation is not risk-free, particularly when non-experts try to recover partitions. You may want to read the Wikipedia article on MBR data structures and the TestDisk instructions before proceeding. There are plenty of questions and answers that touch on TestDisk on this site, too, but a quick search turned up nothing really concise.\nAfter you've recovered your Ubuntu partition(s), you can re-install GRUB. Note that the partition number may have changed, so don't blindly try to use /dev/sda3, as you did in your initial recovery attempts.\n", "Q: How to disable suspend with command line or config file?

In either case it will ask for the password, only once.\n\nA: It appears that nobody else has addressed the obvious concern here.  Putting sudo within your script that you then distribute promotes bad user habits.  (I'm assuming you're distributing it because you mention \"from a user point of view.\")\nThe truth is that there is a guideline in using applications and scripts which is similar to the security principle in banking of: Never give out your personal information to someone who calls you and says they're calling \"from your bank\", and which exists for similar reasons.\nThe rule for applications is:\nNever type in your password when prompted unless you are certain what is being done with it.  This applies triply to anyone with sudo access.\nIf you're typing your password in because you ran sudo on the command line, great.  If you're typing it in because you ran an SSH command, fine.  If you're typing it in when you log in to your computer, great, of course.\nIf you just run a foreign script or executable and tamely enter your password when prompted for it, you have no idea what the script is doing with it.  It could be storing it in a temp file in plaintext, for all you know, and might even fail to clean up after itself.\nObviously there are separate and additional concerns about running an unknown set of commands as root, but what I'm talking about here is maintaining security on the password itself.  Even assuming the application/script is not malicious, you still want your password to be handled securely to prevent other applications from getting hold of it and using it maliciously.\nSo, my own personal response to this is, the best thing to put in your script if it needs root privileges, is:\n#!/bin/bash\n[ \"$UID\" -eq 0 ] || { echo \"This script must be run as root.\"; exit 1;}\n\n# do privileged stuff, etc.\n\n\nA: This'll work:\necho \"$(whoami)\"\n\n[ \"$UID\" -eq 0 ] || exec sudo \"$0\" \"$@\"\n\nexample:\n./test.sh \nblade\n[sudo] password for blade: \nroot\n\n\nA: blade19899's answer is indeed the way to go, however one could also call sudo bash in the shebang:\n#!/usr/bin/sudo bash\n# ...\n\nThe obvious caveat is this will work only as long as the script is called with ./script and will fail as soon as the script is called with bash script.\n\nA: If you'd like a pretty dialog, try something like this. I ripped this straight out of something else I wrote, so it's got extra stuff you might not need or want, but it shows the general idea:\nbrand=\"My Software\"\n\n# Check that the script is running as root. If not, then prompt for the sudo\n# password and re-execute this script with sudo.\nif [ \"$(id -nu)\" != \"root\" ]; then\n    sudo -k\n    pass=$(whiptail --backtitle \"$brand Installer\" --title \"Authentication required\" --passwordbox \"Installing $brand requires administrative privilege.

You can then do a upgrade and update as step 1, and reinstall things you need.\n", "Q: juju 2.0 bootstrap node root access If I want to su to root user in node0 after login as ubuntu how I can do that?\nubuntu@node0:~$ su \nPassword: \nsu: Authentication failure \nubuntu@node0:~$\n\nIs there any way to get root level access of the bootstraped node??

There are a few mistakes in the guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't need some packs, some you should rename (This is an Ubuntu 16.04 only problem).\n\n*nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf\nservice imap-login {\n  inet_listener imap {\n    port = 0\n}\n\nYou need to add here the address = your ip, or dovecot won't open a socket.\n\n*There is a mistake in dovecot-mysqlconfig in the guide. They recommending to uncomment disable_plaintext_auth = yes. But doing this is what doesn't allow you to login via mail clients through IMAP.\n\n*Also an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS only trouble is, that while installing MySQL I have installed a password validation plugin. Thus, it wont allow you to create a 'usermail' user with a weak password from the guide. You should create user like 'dovepost' and with a strong password and change it in those 3 mysql config files for postfix and dovecot that you create in the beginning of the guide.\n", "Q: Trouble with Installation on Acer Aspire One Cloudbook 14. \"Kernel panic - not syncing: IO-APIC + timer doesn't work\" I recently bought a new laptop (Acer Aspire One Cloudbook 14) and wanted to install Ubuntu (14.04.3) on it. I put it on a USB following this guide: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nI erased Windows 10 and installed Ubuntu. I honestly don't remember how the installation initially went as I have been trying to fix this issue for over 12 hours, I know it didn't go too smoothly, as I remember the screen showed a few errors during installation but it eventually loaded, and other than the touch pad not working, it seemed fine.\nOn the reboot however, I was unable to even log in.\n\nBOOT MODE: LEGACY\nIf I have the boot mode set to Legacy, it takes me to a GNU Grub thing if my hard drive is highest priority in boot order, listing a few options (see the picture bellow).\n\nIf I select Ubuntu, that is when I get the messed up screen and \"Kernel panic - not syncing: IO-APIC + timer doesn't work\" error.\nIf I have USB as highest priority (again in Legacy mode) it takes me to the installation menu, though I suspect it doesn't look the way it is suppose to, but that's how it looked when I first installed it, the difference now is, whether I select install Ubuntu or try without installing, I get the same kernel panic error I mentioned earlier.\n\n \nBOOT MODE: UEFI\nIf I run it in UEFI mode, it says \"No bootable device\" whether my hard drive (or whatever the equivalent is on this laptop) or USB is priority.\n\nI believe I installed Ubuntu in Legacy mode by accident, which maybe caused this issue?\nI have been searching online for many hours, but could not find an issue that was close enough to mine, and already tried many of the solutions of problems that were similar. Like disabling secure boot, trying different boot modes, and nothing is listed if I try to select a trusted UEFI file when hard drive is priority, if USB is priority, it just lists files that are on the USB, none of which can be selected.\n\nLaptop Specs:  \nIntel® Celeron® N3050 processor Dual-core 1.60 GHz \nIntel® HD Graphics with Shared Memory \n2 GB, DDR3L SDRAM \n32 GB Flash Memory\n\nA: Assuming you have booted in legacy mode, installed via USB, and are now trying to boot up your freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04. then:\nThe correct boot alteration as detailed here in the Arch wiki\nIs to add the following parameters to the file /etc/default/grub in the line that begins GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX: \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"quiet edd=off noapic modprobe.blacklist=pinctrl_cherryview\" \n\nAfter changing this file, to make the changes effective, run\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis worked for installing Ubuntu 14.04\nIf having trouble booting up initially, press e at the boot options (GRUB) menu and add the parameters at the end of the line with quiet splash:\nedd=off noapic modprobe.blacklist=pinctrl_cherryview\n\nI have bought  the Acer Cloudbook 14 and installed Ubuntu 14.04 on it.\n\nA: (READ LAST UPDATE) I finally got Ubuntu running! I actually had a couple more errors, that are not in this thread, but I put up a more detailed post of my experience here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2317336  \nThe Steps I took to install Ubuntu and resolve this issue: \n1) Reinstalled Windows 10 \n2) Turned off fast start up in the power options menu in Windows \n3) Change Boot Order in BIOS to boot from USB ( I also changed touchpad settings  for my laptop to basic from advanced, but this may not be necessary) \n4) Try Ubuntu Without Installing \n5) Clicked Install when on Ubuntu Desktop \n6) I replaced Windows 10, but this is up to you \n7) Restarted, removed USB and Changed boot order so my hard drive was priority  again \n8) I actually got the 'No Bootable Disk' error again, my heart sank, BUT this time I was able to select a trusted UEFI file as shown on this website: http://itsfoss.com/no-bootable-device-found-ubuntu/\nThat's it! What I learned from this, try before you install to see how it runs on your computer, and have a backup of whatever OS you were using before in case.\nLAST UPDATE: \nOkay, I spoke too soon. I was having issues with getting stuck on a purple screen when the computer would start, it would successfully log in 1/10 times, and after following these instructions: Ubuntu 14.04 loads to purple screen on Lenovo G505s. nomodeset wont work from Taz D (the one about installing xubuntu desktop), that number went up to around 1/5, but I was not satisfied with that and after trying many other solutions online, and trying to install Xubuntu on it, I just gave up and traded laptops with my fiance. She has an HP 15, don't know the particular model. The installation on that laptop went pretty flawless, only thing that slowed me down was I did not know I had to click F9 when it was booting to select a boot device in order to access the USB.\n", "Q: Issue setting up Samba on Ubuntu 15.10 - most likely a permissions issue I'm trying to install Samba on Ubuntu 15.10.

My personal Ubuntu (15.10) experiment just isn't working out; I found out the hard way that I know less than nothing about Linux. I'm completely at sea.\nI have a bootable USB with Windows 10 ready to go, and my product key, but how do I get it to actually run? Is there a startup boot menu or something? I've seen posts that suggest holding down Shift or C during startup, but this didn't do anything.\nEdit: I got a message that this is likely a dupe of this question, and one the answers suggests downloading Boot Repair. This seems to be what I need to do as I'm trying to boot from a USB, so I followed the instructions to do so through the Terminal, but keep getting an error message after the last command.\n\nA: Usually one gets to the boot menu by pressing a function key when the system boots.  Try F8, F12, F1, <Delete>, <Insert>, etc.  It's different on every system.  You'll know you have the correct menu when it asks you if you want to boot to the hard drive, the DVD-ROM, or USB (assuming you have a bootable USB thumb drive plugged in).  Put your Windows DVD in the drive first of course.  Good luck!\n", "Q: Dual Booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu but can't select OS at boot So I finally got Ubuntu installed on my laptop, but the computer still automatically boots to Windows 10 instead without asking me first.  I can still access Ubuntu through UEFI, but the only way I can consistently do that on my computer is to take out the battery and hold down the power button for 30 seconds to get the \"press ESC to pause startup\" message after booting, which is really annoying to do.\nI've tried messing with Windows' settings but it doesn't seem to recognize that Ubuntu's there.  The original installation seemed to go fine as well, and GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 is commented.  So what's the issue here and how can I go about fixing it?\n\nA: The symptoms you report can be caused by at least three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mixed-mode (BIOS/EFI) installations -- If Windows is installed in EFI mode and you install Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode (or vice-versa), you can see something like what you report. The best solution to this problem is to install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. The Boot Repair tool recommended by others can do this, and there are other ways to do it, too; however, it's important that you verify that this is the problem before you try this fix. Also, Boot Repair will do nothing useful if you run it from a BIOS-mode boot, so you must disable your CSM before you attempt this repair. See my page on the CSM and its problems for more on this issue. You can tell if your Ubuntu is booting in EFI mode or in BIOS mode by looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If that directory is present, you've booted in EFI mode and this explanation is most likely not the issue; but if that directory is not present, you've booted in BIOS mode and this may well be the problem.\n\n*Mis-set EFI-mode boot order -- On an EFI-based computer, the order in which the computer tries various boot loaders is stored in NVRAM. If this information is incorrect or missing, you can end up booting straight to the wrong OS. To fix it, you can adjust the boot order with efibootmgr, as described here; or in Windows with the EasyUEFI utility.\n\n*Windows adjusting the boot order on every boot -- This possibility is a special case of the former one. I've seen some reports of Windows adjusting the boot order with every boot. This can result in something like the problem you're seeing, but with the caveat that the boot order remains set to Ubuntu if you shut down or reboot from Ubuntu, but it changes only when you boot to Windows. See this question and answers for more on this problem.\n\n\nBecause the solutions are so different, it's important that you better diagnose the problem before proceeding. Checking your Ubuntu boot mode is the most important diagnostic. Identifying whether the problem occurs with every boot or only after booting to Windows is also important.\nFinally, most EFIs provide some means to enter a built-in boot manager; however, this option is sometimes disabled by a firmware \"fast start\" option. Try entering your firmware setup utility and looking for any option called \"fast start\" or something similar and disabling it. This feature causes the firmware to perform minimal USB initialization rather than full USB initialization, so the keyboard may be non-functional until an OS takes control. Sometimes it's referred to as something relating to USB initialization, so you can look for options like that, too.\n\nA: Enter your terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t to open your terminal and type \nsudo update-grub\n\nAfter that you will see on the last line your other OS name then Done after that restart your system.\n", "Q: can i replace windows with ubuntu and still get the same gaming experience?

Many games aren't available for Linux natively, and some are not capable of being run (even through PlayOnLinux or Wine-driven Steam) without a performance hit.\nSo, no, there's no guarantee you will be able to switch over directly and have the same exact experience.\n", "Q: Ubuntu version for XPS 13 touch screen Is there an Ubuntu version that will enable use of the touch screen on the current Dell XPS 13 with touch screen?\n\nA: My HP Pro X2 612 touchscreen works fine with 15.10\nNo extra driver needed.

I used a Kingston 16gb 2.0 usb drive to boot Ubuntu 15.10 installation image (ubuntu-15.10-desktop-i386.iso). All that appeared at boot was:\n\"SYSLINUX Peter Anvin  etc.\"\n\nBOOT ERROR\n\nAfter searching all the articles with no luck, observed at the command line that the drive itself was marked rw only and although Ubuntu showed it as bootable, the drive itself was not executable. Used chmod +x on /dev/sdc and drive worked perfectly installing the existing iso image of 15.10 that Unetbootin and Startup disk creator both configured it with. No other changes needed to be made to the drive or the software image.\nProblem is that after installation the usb drive becomes rw only again as follows:\n$ls -la /dev/sdc\n\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 32 Mar 19 11:34 /dev/sdc\n\n$sudo chmod +x /dev/sdc \n\n$ls -la /dev/sdc\n\nbrwxrwx--x 1 root disk 8, 32 Mar 19 11:34 /dev/sdc\n\nI tried the install process 3 times with the same results. Each time I received the error was able to make the drive executable from the command line and it worked on reboot. There seems to be an intermittent issue with making the executable setting persistent on the usb drive as the condition and its resulting error can be made consistently repeatable.\n", "Q: How to disable the need for making operations with sudo I can read my Dropbox directory from Ubuntu OS. However, in order to delete/create/move file to this directory I must use \"sudo\". This means that I can do these operation only by shell. \nIs there any option to tell Ubuntu to treat the Dropbox directory just like any other directory? meaning no need to use 'sudo' for the mentioned operations. \n\nA: There is no reason for this, unless the permissions of the Dropbox folder are incorrect.  Make sure that you are the owner of the directory.\nOn my machine, the Dropbox directory has permission 700 with myuser.myuser as the owner.  Obviously, I can move/copy files to it just fine.

My host is Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, and I am running Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.19 in a Virtual Box VM to which I gave 8 GB dynamically allocated disk space to start with. And I have run into a slight problem, I need to do an update in the guest, the update requires more disk space than is currently allocated to the VM. \nI have already looked at this answer but would like to know if there is a GUI way of doing it as I am having issues with VBoxManage. I would also like to know if once I have increased the disk space given to the guest if I need to do anything guest-side to mean that it gets the space and can use it?\n\nA: I was also looking for this info a while ago, but after quite a bit of searching for an easy way to increase the size of a VirtualBox HD, I was unable to find any other way than the method you linked to. \nI even searched Oracle’s  support website, which was where I found the VBoxManage modify hd method that you did, that was the only way mentioned for any host OS on Oracle's site, even Windows does not appear to have a GUI way of doing this.\n\nAs to the second part of your question I can at least answer that helpfully.\nWhen enlarging the virtual HD it will only increase the size of the HD not the partitions on it.  You will have just blank, unformatted space at the end of the drive. \nTo use the rest of the HD you will need to boot into the VM using a Live image(i.e. an LiveCD or booting directly from the ISO, in my experience VirtualBox will not boot from a LiveUSB, but this may have changed with the most recent update). \nAfter booting into the Live system and clicking \"Try Ubuntu\" you will need to use a partition editor like gparted to enlarge the existing partition to the size desired and then expand the file system to fill the space.  \nIf you are just using the space for a new partition you should be able to just boot into the guest OS and format the new partition with a formatting program.  If you have a Windows guest I think that it still comes with some form of Drive Management program that can do this, but my latest experience with Window is Win 7 so I may be outdated. \n", "Q: open ssh connection in background I've looked at a lot of similar questions about this but haven't found anything to solve my issue.\nI would like to be able to open an ssh connection to my university's server and keep the connection open in the background. What I'm doing is I ssh into the uni server and run a script, then scp a file from there to my remote, like:\n$ssh remote@remote.edu \"./bin/script\"\nremote@remote.edu's password:\n$scp remote@remote.edu:~/some_file.txt .\nremote@remote.edu's password:\n\nI do this sequence of commands a ton, and eventually my connection gets refused because the university mistakes it for malicious software. So what I'd like to be able to do is open the ssh connection once, then keep it open so I can continuously run the script on the remote server. I don't want to open the ssh connection in another terminal as its very annoying having two terminals open and constantly alt+tab'ing to the wrong one. Surely there must be a way to do this, I would really appreciate some help.\n\nA: ssh may reuse existing connections.\nHere is a quote of an answer by chepner to this similar question on Stack Overflow:\n\nIf you open the first connection with -M:\nssh -M $REMOTEHOST\n\nsubsequent connections to $REMOTEHOST will \"piggyback\" on the connection established by the master ssh. Most noticeably, further authentication is not required. See man ssh_config under \"ControlMaster\" for more details. Use -S to specify the path to the shared socket; I'm not sure what the default is, because I configure connection sharing using the configuration file instead.\nIn my .ssh/config file, I have the following lines:\nhost *\n  ControlMaster auto\n  ControlPath ~/.ssh/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r\n\nThis way, I don't have to remember to use -M or -S; ssh figures out if a sharable connection already exists for the host/port/username combination and uses that if possible.\n\n", "Q: How to read lm-sensors on AMD FX 6300?

It's like Hwmonitor for Windows.\nsudo apt-get install psensor\n\n\n\nTerms:\nCPU Package = the temperature of the CPU socket, as measured by the motherboard.\n\nCPU Core = the internal temperature of the actual cores on the CPU (This is the one to watch)\nMotherboard = the temperature of the south bridge\n\nSome Notes:\nThe CPU core temp will always be lower than the socket temp, since the CPU has active cooling, whilst the socket does not.\nSince the FX6300 is a 6-core CPU, you would expect that each core has a temperature sensor. There is some confusion about this. It seems that only AMD's overdrive software can detetct all 6 of the FX6300's core temp sensors. However, all the cores will be within 1-2C of each other\n\nTemps in Psensor:\n I have renamed all the temps so I know what is what. If you look at the \"chip\", you can know what is what and rename them like I did.\nMotherboard\nCPU Core Temp\nCPU Package / Socket Temp\n\nA: If you wrote a configuration file for your motherboard you could remove the sensors not connected to anything (fan 3 and temp 3) and correct the limits so that you don’t get all those ALARMs in the sensors output.\nYou can readily see which temps are from the cores by graphing the output using Psensors while you stress them. Install stress with sudo apt-get install stress. For example to stress both cores of a dual core CPU for 10 seconds use stress -c 2 -t 10. Here is the result of stress -c 1 -t 30 on my dual core PC. You can see that the first 15 seconds are run on core 1 then the load switches to core 2. \n\nWhen using sensors and applications like psensors to read temperatures and voltages it is important to check them. You do this by comparing the outputs from sensors with the values displayed by the BIOS (which you can assume are correct). If your PC displays the values briefly during bootup video it and compare the values with those from sensors after the boot completes. Otherwise boot into the BIOS and use the hardware health (or similar) menu selection and photograph or write down the results.\n\nA: I have the AMD6300/m5a97 combo. lm-sensors does not, by default, detect all sensors correctly from the board, and thus psensor does not show correctly. you should run \"sudo sensors-detect\" and answer yes to all prompts. psensor will now show all sensors, but labelled generically. you will need to go through the psensor menus for preferences to edit the labels and choose which to display. \n", "Q: Automatically open applications at start up in Xubuntu 14.04 LTS I have ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed on my pi 2 with Xubuntu as my GUI and I am trying to figure out how to start application automatically after login.

It should work correctly and clean it up:\nsudo sh -c 'cat /dev/null > /var/log/syslog'\n\n\nA: This indefinite growth generally occurs due to repeated log of one or more errors from the same source. \nIn my case it was due to continual report of connection error from the wifi monitoring interface mon0 I have used to monitor my wifi traffic.\nThere have been error reports of such overflow occurring in various other interfaces like tun0 from VPN etc.\nI have resolved my issue by clearing the /var/log/syslog file\nTo tackle this error \n\n\n*\n\n*You need to find the source of this error and stop it from producing any further overflow of log\n\n*Then clear the var/log/syslog file\n\n\nProblems you might face doing the same\n\n\n*\n\n*Cant open var/log/syslog: due to massive size any editor is bound to crash\n\n*Cant clear /var/log/syslog: Again due to massive size clearing is a challenge too\n\n\nSo, for viewing the error that caused the overflow\ntail -f /var/log/syslog\n\nFor clearing use:\nsudo cat /dev/null > /var/log/syslog\n\n\nA: I had similar issues, my syslog file had 115GB and syslog.1 another 115G, plus multiple compressed files.\n1st step\nfind the source:\nwatch tail /var/log/syslog\n\nyou will probably notice the common erro entries;\nafter that; assuming that your files are too big; it is ALMOST pointless to rotate.\nSo, you can delete all the compressed files and files *.1 to recover disk space (my case about 300GB)\n2nd step\nTRUNCATE THE FILE, DO NOT DELETE (or you may have a lot of problems with permissions in the future), there are many methods, including:\nsudo tee /var/log/syslog </dev/null\n\nyou can even do the second step before and keep watching to find the cause, but be sure, if you don't it will happen again.

When running a program as a service it seems that all printfs are diverted to syslog rather than stdout, if you have a lot of printfs then this will fill up the syslog very quickly. I had some issues with some of the methods suggested here but\nsudo tee /var/log/syslog </dev/null\nworked every time.\nNote that (for me) I when the syslog file filled up enough it prevented the pi desktop from starting up - I worked around this by logging in through Putty and using the tee command first then rebooting.\n", "Q: VPN error \"Socket bind failed on local address\" \"Address is already in use\" I'll try not to make this too wordy.

I just followed the instructions for installing the latest driver via the edgers PPA repo. I'm running Kubuntu 15.10 with full luks encryption. The first time I rebooted I got to the login screen to enter my luks password but the keyboard wasn't responding (That happens every once in a while) so as usual I hit Ctrl+Alt+Del and now every time I try to boot I never get to the luks screen. It's just a black screen.\nThe only thing I can do is keep rebooting and of course access grub. I could really use some guidance here. A lot of solutions for older versions of Ubuntu suggest commands that I can't execute because I can't get to a shell. I try Ctrl+Alt+F1 at the black screen.\nI'm good at troubleshooting Linux servers but when it comes to a gpu issue on a desktop version I'm not sure what to do.\n\nA: I fixed this by booting into recovery and removing every single package using purge that the Ubuntu AMD binary instructions had me install in the first place. I believe it was some kernel module blacklisting that was causing the black screen. I was able to boot into previous kernel installs before removing all I had done. Now I have the latest kernel back. I plan to investigate further into what was preventing me from using the latest driver but for now I'm just happy to have my system back to normal. I of course removed the edgers repo as well though I'll be experimenting with it in the future now that I know how to recover from it.\n", "Q: have problem with ceph fs mount I want to mount CephFS with the kernel driver, but when I execute this command on my admin node\nmount -t ceph 192.168.0.164:6789:/ /mnt/mycephfs\n\nThe admin node hangs! and I have to reset my machine.\nMy OS is Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) with kernel version is 3.16.0-60 and Ceph v9.2.1\n\nA: I had the same problem.

I was originally looking for one that works on 14.04, and now on 16.04.\nUbuntu 16.04\nFollowing the advice of some commentators below, I gave another try to these programmes on Ubuntu 16.04. There are clear improvements, but it still is not possible to use a CalDAV calendar on Ubuntu.\nEvolution\nThe most important hindrances to its usage on Ubuntu 14.04 have been fixed:\n\n\n*\n\n*It now shows in the Lens.\n\n*It can be started with the \"dummy\" e-mail account.\n\n\nEvolution comes with a good Help package that explains in detail the configuration of a CalDAV calendar. Although easy to set up, the CalDAV connection fails repeatedly and the calendar contents are never displayed. Naturally, it is neither possible to create new events. An error message is displayed that does not help much:\n\nUnable to connect to 'Calendar': Cannot open calendar: Unexpected HTTP\n  status code 405 returned (Not Allowed) for URI:\n  https://account@my.owndrive.com/\n\nOther programmes connect to the server with the exact same credentials, no clue why Evolution fails.\nKOrganiser\nIts problems have been fixed and now functions almost entirely. It is able to register my CalDAV account, fetch all my calendars and synchronise regularly. It even allows me to use my public SSH key instead of requiring my password.\nHowever, Korganiser is programmed to work exclusively in the UTC time zone. I happen to live elsewhere, therefore all its functionality becomes useless when a new event created for 10h00 appears in all other devices at a different time...\nOnce more: are there any other functional alternatives to use and synchronise a CalDAV calendar on Ubuntu?\nPrevious tries on Ubuntu 14.04\nThese are the programmes from the Software Centre I tried so far, none of which functions on Ubuntu 14.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*Evolution - it does not show in the Lens after being installed:\n\n\n*KOrganiser - displays an error message; the menus remain active but produce no results.\n\n\n*Calendar - displays a cryptic error message and exits.\n\nWhat other clients exist out there?\n\nA: What about the Lighting add-on with Thunderbird? It works well with a NextCloud CalDAV server.\n\n\nA: I finally managed to get Evolution working with my CalDAV service. This answer refers exclusively to version 3.18.5.2, with previous versions this procedure fails.\nThe trickiest bit is the e-mail configuration. You are forced to do so in order to use the calendar (go figure). Install Evolution from the Software Centre and start it up. A configuration menu appears; follow on with all options by default up to the Identify menu.\nEnter your name and use the dummy address. If this address is not already there just use something like dummy@mail.com. Uncheck the Look up mail server... box, otherwise the process fails. Click Next.\n\nIn the Identity menu, you must choose the None option from the Server Type in order to follow on:\n\nIn the Sending Email menu select Sendmail as the Server Type and leave all other boxes empty or unchecked. Click Next on all the following menus to finish the configuration.\n\nAnd finally you are using Evolution. If you are not shown the calendar press the Calendar button at the bottom left.\nNow you must tell Evolution about your CalDAV service. Go to File > New > Calendar; the New Calendar dialogue appears. In the Type drop down select the CalDAV option. Then insert the URL address of your service, insert something like: https://my.owndrive.com/remote.php/caldav/. This is the URL for OwnDrive, it will be different for other services, you must know the exact address of your CalDAV service. Finally, insert your user name and  click the Find Calendars button: \n\nWait for the remote calendars to be listed (it can take a little while). Select one of the calendars and click OK; click OK again in the New Calendar dialogue and repeat the process for other calendars.\n\nA: I was experimenting with  vdirsync + khal or with California, and have found that California syncs seamlessly with my Nextcloud caldav server. No email account necessary. \nI had to add each calendar individually, it couldn't just discover them all via https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/caldav but once I added each caldav link the calendars did sync. \nI will note that it took hours for the first sync to happen, and I don't know what set it off. Then all of a sudden I got a password popup for each calendar and they're now synced. I've tested editing on Nextcloud and locally and the sync seems to be instantaneous.\nI'd still like to know how to do this: Can I force calendar sync? but overall I'm pretty happy with it. \nNOTE: Calfornia is totally unmaintained and after I filed 2-3 different bug reports someone finally told me that. I like California's week and agenda views, so I use it and Gnome Calendar, which has a sync button. \n\n", "Q: SFTP access to other folders My current server setup with 14.04 includes OpenSSH with SFTP configured:\nSubsystem sftp internal-sftp\nMatch group ftpaccess\nChrootDirectory /mnt/earth/www\nX11Forwarding no\nAllowTcpForwarding no\nForceCommand internal-sftp\n\nI have a user named www who is a member of the group ftpaccess.\nI have a mounted folder /mnt/earth/www that is on another Windows 2008 server.\nThe folder permissions on this mount are drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 16 10:03 www\nI can connect to my SFTP server with any FTP program, but all I get to see is the user's homedir files:\n.bash_logout\n.bashrc\n.profile\n\nNot the contents of the mounted folder.\nWhat do I need to change so that this user sees the contents of the mount, instead of his homedir?\n\nA: Due to your comment under your question if i understand correctly you solved the main problem but now you ask \" But I can't write anything to it\". \nThat is why you cannot write > \"drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 16 10:03 www\"\nYou have to mount /mnt/earth/www with a mask of www user\n", "Q: Ubuntu stopped working after update After the actualization of yesterday (3/16/2016) my graphical interface shows malfunctioning (I have a nvidia gtx 750 ti and the login screen has a resolution of 640x480).

If though this is a high number I would suggest you investigate -why- these logs are large and fix the problem it is logging if any or to turn down the amount of logging (by not logging regular messages but just errors and warnings). \n", "Q: How do I get the dash to open on the application scope rather than the home scope I want to be able to do this by clicking on the dash icon in the launcher rather than using some kind of key combination.\n\nA: You can already do it with 2 clicks: \n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the dash icon to open a context menu.\n\n*Left-click \"Applications\". \n\n\nOr with one click-and-drag:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the dash icon and hold the mouse button down to open a context menu.\n\n*Move the mouse over the \"Applications\" option and release the right mouse button there.\n\n", "Q: Permission denied error when installing pyttsx in Ubuntu 14.04 Permission denied error when installing pyttsx\npip install pyttsx\nerror: could not create '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyttsx': Permission denied\n\n\nA: You have to be root or use sudo to go past that screen.\nsudo pip install pyttsx\n\nOn my system:\nparto@parto:~$ sudo pip install pyttsx\n[sudo] password for parto: \nDownloading/unpacking pyttsx\n  Downloading pyttsx-1.1.tar.gz\n  Running setup.py (path:/tmp/pip_build_root/pyttsx/setup.py) egg_info for package pyttsx\n\nInstalling collected packages: pyttsx\n  Running setup.py install for pyttsx\n\nSuccessfully installed pyttsx\nCleaning up...\nparto@parto:~$\n\n", "Q: How to turn up a linux bridge while booting ubuntu machine? I want a linux bridge to get installed and turned up while booting an Ubuntu(14.04) machine. The bridge should be attached to eth0 interface. How can I do so?\n\nA: I am pretty new to bridging network interfaces myself, so i am not sure if this is the perfect solution: On your machine there is a file /etc/network/interfaces, in which your interfaces (and bridges) are defined. To this file, you can add the following:\n auto br0\n iface br0 inet static\n       address 192.168.1.2\n       network 192.168.1.0\n       netmask 255.255.255.0\n       broadcast 192.168.1.255\n       gateway 192.168.1.1\n       bridge_ports eth0\n\nBe aware that this will assign a static ip to the bridge interface, and you may have to change all the IP adresses considering your network structure (e.g. change the gateway address to your gateway/router). The important aspects considering your question are the auto br0, which will automatically bring the bridge up on boot, and the bridge_ports eth0which attaches the bridge to eth0 as you wished. For further information on bridging interfaces, you might have a look here.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 default logon I am new to Ubuntu. I have Ubuntu 14.04 in Vmware what is the default login?  How would I find the password?  What is Ubuntu designed to do?\n\nA: There is no default login.\nIf you have not installed it to the hard disk, (i.e. 'Live' mode or you chose 'Try Ubuntu'), then there is no password.\nBut if you (or someone else) set it up, then there must be a password. If somebody else did, ask them.\n\nWhat is Ubuntu designed to do?\n\nUbuntu is designed to provide a free, open source and powerful computing platform, as an alternative to proprietary OSes like Mac OS X or Windows.\nUbuntu uses the Linux kernel and is based on Debian. It is heavily inspired by Unix.\n", "Q: Is apt-get dist-upgrade required in Docker container? Node Source's Docker image of Ubuntu runs apt-get upgrade, not apt-get dist-upgrade, to install latest version of all packages.\napt-get dist-upgrade is considered a command to upgrade kernel related packages. In Docker container, kernel packages are not installed because host's kernel is used, and apt-get upgrade looks enough.\nHowever, man page of apt-get says:\ndist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,\nalso intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions\nof packages\n\nAccording to this, other packages may require to run apt-get dist-upgrade to install latest patch.\nAre there such packages which requires apt-get dist-upgrade in the current or past releases of Ubuntu?\nIf such packages exists, we need to run dist-upgrade even in Docker container.\n\nA: In general, you are going to want to use upgrade rather then dist-upgrade.\nIn general, unless you have a problem or feel you know more then the docker developers, best go with the defaults.\nIn the event upgrade has problems, dist-upgrade is a potential solution.\nupgrade will update new packages when new versions are available, but will sometimes not remove packages or not install additional packages. dist-upgrade will upgrade and if necessary add or remove packages.\nYou should always review what apt-get is telling you when you upgrade and review the packages list with dist-upgrade.\nFor additional information see\nWhat is \"dist-upgrade\" and why does it upgrade more than \"upgrade\"?\nand \nWhy use apt-get upgrade instead of apt-get dist-upgrade?\n\nA: I would say you should not even use upgrade: rather rebuild the image with --no-cache and execute the usual update and install pair, which will fetch the latest versions of a package.\n", "Q: 14.04 Login Loop I know there are already several questions about this problem. However, I did not find a solution using the answer already provided.\nI just installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS dual-boot alongside Windows 8. When logging in to Ubuntu using the login manager I am stuck in a log-in loop where I find myself at the beginning again after a black screen in between.\nWhat makes this really difficult for me is that the computer does not have an internet connection and it will take a while until this will be possible. So I cannot install any updates or new applications.\nI already tried to create a new (root) user, I changed permissions of my home folder or the /tmp folder, I changed permission of .Xauthority (which worked at first but after a reboot I have the same problem again and changing permission of .Xauthority does not help anymore), changed permission of .IDEauthority (I also tried just moving .Xauthority or .IDEauthority to a different file), restarted lightdm or rebooted the whole system. Also, .xsession-errors does not show any error message.\nNot sure if this is helpful, but the system has an nvidia Quadro K2200 and it is apparetly running with the nouveau driver (at least according to \"lshw -C display\"). \nAny other ideas?\nDo you think I can solve this without internet access?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You might have changed the user or usergroup to your home directory\nIf so, you can change it back to your username with command \nsudo chown -R username:username username/\n\n-R means change the user and usergroup of all the files under username/\nHope this will help.\n", "Q: Clean up partitions I'm trying to fix my partitions, and start using all the space on my hdd again.\nI had Windows 7 installed, using 3 partitions: System, Data, and Other\nthen I installed Ubuntu using the Other partition but ended up with partitions shown at this image: One System partition, one for data (yet smaller than before installing ubuntu), one for Ubuntu and one 'partition' unallocated space. \nNow I would like to extend my root partition (/dev/sda9 or the ext4 partition), but can that be done without having to reinstall ubuntu? I've also noticed that my swap partition is gone, but I have got 16 GB ram installed so would a 1gb swap partition be enough for Linux? I'm not using high memory consuming programs\n\nA: if you want to modify your Ubuntu partition you need to boot a Live Ubuntu CD/USB with GParted. In this way your Ubuntu partition should not mounted (check this when you boot the live cd) and you can extend it as you wish.\nYou have not to reinstall Ubuntu because when GParted extend a partition, it move all the content to align the partition start, but it doesn't change any files.\nTo be sure do a backup of your important file and settings.\n\nA: Instead of expanding your existing partition, you may want to consider creating a new partition to use the unallocated space. This will be safer, since you won't need to move a bunch of critical data structures, which is what will happen if you try to expand your /dev/sda9 into the free space preceding it. Chances are a new /home partition would be the best use for (most of) that free space; this is where your user files go, so it's the partition that's most likely to need to increase in size. This question and answers describes how to create a /home partition after installing Ubuntu. OTOH, if you want to increase the size of your current partition because of non-user files (say, if you're installing tons of software or if you're running a server that stores lots of data in /var), either creating a new partition for the relevant directory (like /var) or resizing the current partition (despite the risks) may be the best approach.\nAs to swap space, the old rule was to create swap space equal to 1-2 times your RAM, which would be 16 to 32 GiB, in your case. Today, it's rarely helpful to have this much swap space. The main reason to have even as much swap as you've got RAM is if you want to use hibernation (suspend-to-disk) operations, which are disabled by default in Ubuntu. That said, the Linux kernel can make effective use of swap space even if you've got lots of RAM -- the kernel will swap out long-inactive data from RAM, freeing the RAM for use as disk caches, thus improving performance. With 16 GiB of RAM, this might or might not be important to you, depending on how much of that RAM is used by programs. If this answer seems a bit wishy-washy, I apologize; but it's impossible to give a blanket statement about how much swap space is necessary or helpful without detailed system usage information.\n", "Q: Installing Snappy core on alix 3d3 So, i want to put my Alix 3d3 board to work and i wonder if i can install Snappy on it.\nIt's a Amd Geode based embedded board which is x86. The install info for snappy lists images that are only for x64 systems. \nAs it says in the \"Notes\" section: \"We only generate and certify images which work on a 64 bit system. If you require 32 bit, You can generate the image using ubuntu-device-flash.\"\nThat kinda gives me hope, that this could work, but i have no idea on how to generate the image.\nI'm using ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: We're working on making ubuntu-device-flash a little more accessible. Until then, my colleague has a github repo with a pretty handy shell script setup for image creation that supports creating i386 images. Simply run it-- it's an interactive script; it'll guide you through:\n$ git clone https://github.com/zyga/devtools.git\n$ cd devtools/\n$ ./ubuntu-image\n\nAt the end of the process you'll have a .img file you can dd as in the documentation. Note that the ubuntu-image script will generate an 16.04 image though, not 15.04. By default it'll put you on the edge channel, too-- you might consider changing line 97 (channel=edge) to channel=stable.\n", "Q: Wine Not Able To Run .exe File(s) Before I installed Ubuntu on my laptop, Windows was infected with a virus, that Avast detected was installed by an .exe file.\nI installed Ubuntu in a dual boot, keeping my Windows data partition, that still had the virus on it. back on Ubuntu, I installed Wine, and ran a program from my data partition. When running the .exe file from Windows, it works fine. The problem is when I run the .exe file from Wine, it shows the following error:\nThe integrity of the EXE file can't be verified.\n\nIf I download the program from the internet, it behaves the same way. Did Wine somehow get infected with the virus? What should I do to fix this issue?\n\nA: First of all, do you know how exactly the virus got onto your pc? Did you open an email, or maybe use a crack for some program that you downloaded from the internet? Was this cracked program maybe the Internet Download Manager? If somehow the virus got executed within wine, it is very well possible that it did some harm, which will probably be only within your wine installation.\nIf the program that you are running is some suspicious file (e.g. if it is a crack downloaded from the internet) it is possible that this program is itself the virus you are talking about. As someone else already mentioned in the comments, there are alternatives for these programs, that don't require wine to run. For now, you should consider using those. Why did you use Internet Download Manager in the first place, does it provide any functions that other (free) download managers like JDownloader or gWget do not provide ?(I'm asking so that we can provide you with suggestions for linux alternatives that provide the same functionality)\nYou should also consider installing clamAV, which is a virus scanner for linux. It will allow you to scan your data partition, and remove any infected files. Otherwise, whenever you copy your data to another windows machine, you will risk infecting that machine as well! You can look into this question for more information on clamAV.\n\nA: My first impression is that wine itself is infected. Have you considered the previous comment to use a good AV scanner? If clamAV is too difficult to run try to run Panda-cloud and scan the wine manifest itself. Other applications that maybe contributing to your issue is using Libre office or some other opensource application that was infected before you installed it. Always start with a clean golive-boot CD written from another PC that was virus tested before committing it to your own OS. I would not run 3rd party scripts to setup wine even if your tempted to do so as a newbie I've often found the wine manifest to be infected with ransomware and that is an easy way to get it on your machine. Have you considered another emulator like playonlinux or Crossover to un your .exe file. These would be my first choice, if your cash strapped like most of us during covid pandemic then you could try an older release of \"win4linux\"\n", "Q: Connected but no internet access in Ubuntu 14.04 I have been using this broadband connection for a long time.

If you don't know where someone lives, but you do know his/her name, you call some service hotline (or look in the phonebook). In the Internet, the equivalent to this service/phonebook is called DNS, which means \"Domain Name Service\". You basically call this Domain Name Service, and ask them, hey, where does this PC named google.com live? In your case, your dns does not work (since you can ping google if you use its address, but not if you use the name).\nTo solve this, open the network manager, click on your connection, edit the settings (not really sure where to find the button in Ubuntu, in my network manager its in the lower right of the window). In the settings window, go to the IPv4 section. There is a field under DNS, in this field, enter 8.8.8.8. If you want, you can add another entry by clicking the plus, and in this field enter 8.8.4.4. Those are googles DNS servers and they should work pretty much all the time!\nEDIT: If you cannot do as mentioned above, because you can't find the option or whatever, just run the following command:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' >> /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\"\n", "Q: How to delete folders every N minutes from comand line I am am trying to run the below command to delete tmp folders greater than 3 minutes using the below:\n find /tmp/tmp* -mmin +3 -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nThe above command fails.

So, if I click on a link that's on Youtube, I'd like it to be opened in Chrome instead of Firefox. Especially, when I click on links in my RSS in Thunderbird. I tried the \"Open with\" Extension in Thunderbird, but when I right click on the link on the URL it only gives me \"Copy Link location\".\n\nA: One solution is to go ahead and copy the link location. Then paste the URL into the address bar in Chrome. To save time,have Chrome running the background before you open Thunderbird. \nProbably better, though, is to install the add-on called \"Open-With\" by Geoff Lankow.

I can first ssh to the Pi and from there to the server, though.\nEven when I copied the /etc/ssh/sshd_config from my Pi to the server, I still couldn't access it remotely.\nWhat could be the issue here?\n\nA: Your home network most likely only has one single (public) IP address that can be reached from the outside. This is the address assigned to your router. If you configure port forwarding, the following happens:\nYou configured port 22 to be forwarded to your pi. Now, if anyone contacts your router on it's ip and port 22, the router will forward those packets to your raspberry pi. For the outside person, it looks just as if your raspberry pi was behind the public ip, and not your router. Of course, you can not ssh to your server now, since your server can not listen on port 22 of the public ip adress! You would have to configure the servers ssh server to listen on some other port instead, and forward that port to the server!\n", "Q: Building LXC, LXD Image Is it possible when using LXC,LXD images and containers that I can build my OWN image for a specific Ubuntu distro? then I use it as a container. thanks\n\nA: Yes.\nyou can convert a container in a image with this:\nlxc launch ubuntu:trusty image_container\n...\n...(you can use lxc launch ubuntu:xenial ... for a different ubuntu release)\n...\nlxc exec image_container bash\n...\n...(prepare your container to be setup for be a new image...) \n....\nlxc publish image_container --alias local_image\n\nafter this you can see your local_image in your container like local image server.\n", "Q: rEFIt Not Working with Ubuntu 12.04/MacOS dual boot after upgrade to El Capitan I have a MacBook Pro Late 2011 and the version of MacOS 10.7.2 Lion and I've always been using it no problem, so I didn't update to any of the newer versions of Yosemite, Mavericks, etc.  On this Mac, I dual booted (a long time ago... in 2013, I believe) by installing Ubuntu 12.04 using rEFIt as was suggested by the guide (Mactel Dual Boot Guide) I used when dual booting.  When I booted up, it would show the rEFIt screen with the choice of booting into Mac or Ubuntu.  (I earlier posted this question in the Apple Stack Exchange and they told me it'd be better to post it here at askUbuntu.)\nBefore I go on, I want to mention that I'm aware that rEFIt is obsolete and no longer maintained, and rEFInd is the more current option.  The reason why I used rEFIt is because (a) that's what the guided suggested and (b) I think I did my dual boot before rEFInd came out.\nNow, I updated to MacOS X El Capitan, and the rEFIt screen doesn't show up and my computer just boots into Mac.  I want the rEFIt/rEFInd screen to come back to allow me to select which OS I'd like to boot into.\nI've searched on Google, and found some relevant links: very similar issue to mine with Yosemite and something which seems to resemble my problems and a very insightful post and here.  However, I'm not sure what to do, especially because I don't want to have to re-install Linux as suggested by the third link.\nSo, my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get the rEFIt/rEFInd installer back to select the OS?\n\n*In order to do the above, do I have to uninstall rEFIt?  (My understanding from the \"Removing rEFIt\" page is that I wouldn't as MacOS X is already my startup disk, so I don't have to go through and rename any EFI directories...)\n\n*Can I do this without re-installing Ubuntu?\n\n\nIf anyone else has encountered this issue or has any insight, I'd greatly appreciate it!  Thanks!\n\nA: Note: I maintain rEFInd.\nShort Answer\nDownload the rEFInd .zip file from its download page and install it. Note that you're almost certain to run into issues related to System Integrity Protection (SIP), which can be overcome as described in the rEFInd documentation. Installing rEFInd should get you booting again. You may well see a rEFIt entry in rEFInd, which will be rendered redundant. You can remove it by deleting the /EFI/refit directory in OS X; or you can leave it in place, if you like.\nLong Answer\nUpgrading your OS X version has updated the OS X boot loader, which has taken control of the boot process from rEFIt. The new SIP feature makes it impossible for the rEFIt support tool called rEFItBlesser to do its job, so even if rEFItBlesser is installed, it can't switch the boot back to one that uses rEFIt. In principle, you could disable SIP and then run rEFItBlesser or re-install rEFIt to get things working again; however, there might be other changes made by installing OS X 10.11 that would create further complications. Overall, therefore, it's probably better to switch to rEFInd -- although rEFIt can be made to work, it's becoming necessary to jump through more and more undocumented hoops to do so.\nChances are your Ubuntu installation is just fine, although I can't be 100% certain of that from the information you've provided. Partition table information would be helpful in making that determination; but as I suspect it's all fine, and as installing rEFInd shouldn't create any real problems even if it's not, you might as well go ahead with a rEFInd installation. There's certainly no call to completely re-install Ubuntu unless you have reason to think that the OS X upgrade has damaged the Ubuntu installation.\nNote that rEFInd can launch Linux kernels directly, provided it can read them. Once you install rEFInd, you may see two or more ways to launch Ubuntu. One is likely to show up as a generic penguin icon and will launch a BIOS-mode version of GRUB. This option might or might not still work. Another is likely to show up with an Ubuntu icon and have a description that references a file with a name beginning with vmlinuz. This option boots Ubuntu directly via the kernel in EFI mode, and is the preferred way to launch Ubuntu. If this option works, you can eliminate the BIOS-mode option by editing the refind.conf file: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is not among the listed options.\n\nA: A 2007 Mac Mini can't see a 64 bit cd/dvd so I took out the hard drive, cleaned up the inside of the mac, doubled the memory to 4 GB, installed 64 bit os in a USB box on a laptop, put HDD back in, couldn't see linux with refit. Next installed rFind in the Apple OS. Still no luck so moved partition over 10 GB and installed 2010 LTS 32 bit using CD and it was there. Holding down the option key on the boot and rFind comes up.Choose between Apple or Linux. So using 2010 32 bit for a bootloader. Next moved down to the 64 bit for default. It's triple boot, but it works!  Trouble is Linux can only see 2.9 GB ram, Apple sees 4 GB.

You can test various things (is owner, same group, etc) but ACL might apply, there might be no permissions in the mount, who knows. It's hard.\nIf you can turn into that user, you can test -w <path> to see if they can write. This isn't as fast as just looking at the inode but it's possible with sudo.\nsudo -u oli test -w <path> && echo \"HOORAY\"\n\nWe can then squirl that onto the back-end of find. Instead of just using -exec to change to the oli user over and over and over again (see past revisions), we pipe everything into a xargs instance running as oli. This is much faster.\nsudo find / -type d -print0 | sudo -u oli xargs -0 -I{} sh -c 'test -w \"$0\" && echo \"$0\"' {}\n\nA somewhat optimised (but visually flabbier) version of this involves minimising the amount of subshelling the xargs performs by piping a stream of paths into a low number of bash subshells. This is undoubtedly faster for big searches.\nsudo find / -type d -print0 | sudo -u oli xargs -0 sh -c 'for p; do [ -w \"$p\" ] && echo \"$p\"; done' -\n\n\nA: In chat we came to the following instructions for user and group: \nsudo find / -type d -user rinzwind -perm /u=w\nsudo find / -type d -group rinzwind -perm /g=w\nsudo find / -type d -perm /o=w\n\nOr combine all three into one:\nsudo find -type d \\( \\( -user rinzwind -perm /u=w \\) -o \\( -group rinzwind -perm /g=w \\) -o -perm /o=w \\)\n\nWithout the / it searches current directory. \nTook less than 2 seconds on 67Gb of data on my system ;) \n\nA: Answer under construction, please be patient\nTesting for oneself\nOne can test write permissions for him/herself with the following code:\n[ -w /home/$USER ] && echo yes # using home directory as example\n\nUsing -d flag for test , we can test if something is a directory.\nKnowing all that and find we can do\nfind /home/ -print0 2> /dev/null | while IFS=\"\"  read -r -d \"\" file ; do [ -d \"$file\"  ] &&  [ -w \"$file\" ]  && echo \"$file\" is writeable ; done\n\nSide note:\nObviously , if you get permission errors with find, you cannot read that file, hence there's no reason to output those errors, hence redirection to dev null. Obviously this won't work if we want to find out permissions for users other than oneself, and note - /home is just an example here. Such folders as /var do have folders shared between multiple users\nTesting for others\nOne could use stat per each file the find finds and filter it out with awk\n find /var -type d -exec stat --format '%g %n'  {} \\; 2> /dev/null | awk '$1=='1000'{print}' \n\nHere i am filtering for numeric ID of my own user , 1000, but it could be ID of any user. Of course one can play with options, use group name instead of numeric ids. It's something that is very pliable and adaptable to the purpose you need\nSmall adjustments\nSo I've noticed that you mention being logged in as root. Here's an output of my command, where I stat files and print their group and file name, then filter out using AWK by appropriate group name.\n$ find /proc -type d -exec stat --format '%G %n'  {} \\; 2> /dev/null  | awk '$1==\"syslog\"{print}'\nsyslog /proc/560\nsyslog /proc/560/task\nsyslog /proc/560/task/560\nsyslog /proc/560/task/560/net\nsyslog /proc/560/task/560/attr\nsyslog /proc/560/task/562\nsyslog /proc/560/task/562/net\nsyslog /proc/560/task/562/attr\nsyslog /proc/560/task/563\nsyslog /proc/560/task/563/net\nsyslog /proc/560/task/563/attr\nsyslog /proc/560/task/564\nsyslog /proc/560/task/564/net\nsyslog /proc/560/task/564/attr\nsyslog /proc/560/net\nsyslog /proc/560/attr\n^C\n\n\nA: If you have GNU find, you can use the -writable test (note the spelling, it's not writeable).  That uses the access(2) system call instead of just trying to figure things out from looking at the permissions, so it works correctly with ACLs.  (But might break on NFS with ID mappings).\nIt will also find directories that are writeable by the user thanks to being a member of a secondary group.  (e.g. a directory in /usr/local writeable by users in the admin group, or something like chown root:users /data/share && chmod 2775 /data/share, where some accounts are members of the users group.)\nusername_to_check=peter base_dir=/   # for example\nsudo -u \"$username_to_check\" find \"$base_dir\" -type d -writable  2>/dev/null ## GNU find, not POSIX\n\nThere will be errors when find encounters directories the user can't descend into, so we redirect errors to /dev/null.\nThis will not find any directories that are writeable but inside directories without execute permission, because find running as the user can't traverse the higher directories.  However, if a process they own is started inside such a directory, they will be able to write to it with relative paths.  (or they get hold of an open file descriptor to such a directory, they can use openat(2)).  pwd won't work if they don't have exec permission on one of the directory components of the full path, so it's not a common setup.\nThis also misses writeable directories that are inside executable but not readable directories.  To work around those limitations, probably run find -type d as root, and use find -writable as the user to check the resulting paths.  That might be more efficient than a shell loop using [ -w \"$f\" ].\nPOSIX find(1) has far fewer options than GNU find.  If your script has to be portable to POSIX, it's probably easiest to pipe into something else that checks permissions, like a shell with [ -w \"$f\" ] (see the other answer that suggests this.)\n", "Q: Windows 10 will only connect to Ubuntu wirelessly but not via LAN I wish to transfer files between a Windows 10 desktop and a media server running Ubuntu 14.04.1.

I have resolved the underlying problem.  \nThe solution to this problem:\n   1.  backup the partition information [  sfdisk -d /dev/sda > sfparts.txt ]\n   2.  Using gparted /dev/sda, under the device tab, I used the create partition table entry\n   3. At this point both gparted and fdisk showed the same single partition\n   4. Using  [ sfdisk /dev/sda < sfparts.txt ] i restored the partition entries\n   5. Both gparted and fdisk had exactly the same view of the existing partitions  \nIn the install process, I was able to delete some partitions, create new partitons, create the filesystems and then complete the basic install\nthank you to those who responded\n", "Q: Rename a file to parent directory's name in terminal I have to deal with a large number of files nested inside of directories (one file per directory), resembling something like this:\nfred/result.txt\njohn/result.txt\nmary/result.txt\n...\n\nI am currently using the following command to process each of those files:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type d \\( ! -name . \\) -exec bash -c \\\"cd '{}' && processResult result.txt\\\" \\;\n\nI am looking for something I can add into the end of this command that will change the filenames to fred.txt, etc. and then later move the file into the parent directory to eliminate the extra layer of directories.\nWhat would be the best way to do this?\n\nA: The small python script below will do exactly as you describe; it will: \n\n\n*\n\n*rename any file in given directory, named results.txt, according to its superior directory\n\n*move it one (directory) level up\n\n*delete the (now empty) directory where the file initially was located\n\n\nThe result:\nThis:\ndirectory\n|\n├── fred\n│   └── results.txt\n├── john\n│   └── results.txt\n└── mary\n    └── results.txt\n\nwill become:\ndirectory\n|\n├── fred.txt\n│   \n├── john.txt\n│ \n└── mary.txt\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport shutil\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ndr = sys.argv[1]\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(dr):\n    for file in files:\n        if file == \"results.txt\":\n            spl = root.split(\"/\"); newname = spl[-1]; sup = (\"/\").join(spl[:-1])\n            shutil.move(root+\"/\"+file, sup+\"/\"+newname+\".txt\"); shutil.rmtree(root)\n\nTo use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the code below into an empty file, save it as move_rename.py\n\n*Run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/move_rename.py <directory_to_reorganize>\n\nNote\nas always, first test it on a small sample\n\nA: I think this is legit (using the perl-based rename command)\nfind dir -name 'results.txt' -exec rename -nv -- 's|/(.*)/(.*)$|/$1/$1.txt|' {} +\n\ne.g. given\n$ tree dir\ndir\n├── fred\n│   └── results.txt\n├── john\n│   └── results.txt\n└── mary\n    └── results.txt\n\n3 directories, 3 files\n\nthen\n$ find dir -name 'results.txt' -exec rename -v -- 's|/(.*)/(.*)$|/$1/$1.txt|' {} +\ndir/fred/results.txt renamed as dir/fred/fred.txt\ndir/john/results.txt renamed as dir/john/john.txt\ndir/mary/results.txt renamed as dir/mary/mary.txt\n\nresulting in\n$ tree dir\ndir\n├── fred\n│   └── fred.txt\n├── john\n│   └── john.txt\n└── mary\n    └── mary.txt\n\n3 directories, 3 files\n\n\nIf you only need to go 1 level below dir, you may be able to simply do\nrename -vn -- 's|/(.*)/(.*)$|/$1/$1.txt|' dir/*/results.txt\n\nAs always, the -n option is left in for testing purposes\n\nA: We can use the classical approach : find  with while read  combo:\nDemo:\n$ ls *\nfred:\nresults.txt\n\njane:\nresults.txt\n\njohn:\nresults.txt\n\n$> find . -type f -name \"results.txt\" -printf \"/%P\\n\" | while read FILE ; do DIR=$(dirname \"$FILE\" );\\                            \n>  mv .\"$FILE\" .\"$DIR\"\"$DIR\".txt;done                                                                                             \n$> ls\nfred/  jane/  john/\n$> ls *\nfred:\nfred.txt\n\njane:\njane.txt\n\njohn:\njohn.txt\n\nUse echo before using mv to test the line with your files.\nMinor improvement\nWe can embed the call to bash into exec , with parameter expansion (specifically prefix removal). Basically it's embedding a script into exec call. \n$> find \"$PWD\" -type f -name \"results.txt\" -exec bash -c ' DIR=$( dirname \"{}\"  ); echo \"{}\" \"$DIR\"/\"${DIR##*/}\".txt  ' \\;                \n/home/xieerqi/TESTDIR/fred/results.txt /home/xieerqi/TESTDIR/fred/fred.txt\n/home/xieerqi/TESTDIR/jane/results.txt /home/xieerqi/TESTDIR/jane/jane.txt\n/home/xieerqi/TESTDIR/john/results.txt /home/xieerqi/TESTDIR/john/john.txt\n\nTo make the command general, (working for any file, not just results.txt) just remove -name \"results.txt\" part. Also see this post for alternative Python solution to this.\n\nA: If you have multiple files in folders with the same extensions, some of the above commands will overwrite all but one, renaming all files with the same name. \nfolder1/file1.txt file2.txt --> folder1/folder1.txt\n\nTo avoid this, you can use this command or equivalent:\nfor f in */*.txt ;do fp=$(dirname \"$f\"); fl=$(basename \"$f\"); mv \"$fp/$fl\" \"$fp/$fp\"_\"$fl\"; done\n\nBy keeping the full filename $fl rather than just the extension, you preserve all the files.\nfolder1/file1.txt file2.txt --> folder1/folder1_file1.txt folder1_file2.txt\n\n\nA: Doing it through find seems overly complicated. Why not use a simple for loop?\nfor folder in *; do\n    (cd \"$folder\" && processResult result.txt)  # This replaces your previous find(1)\n    mv \"$folder/result.txt\" \"${folder}.txt\"\n    rmdir \"$folder\"\ndone\n\n\nA: You can do a trick with rsync + a for loop\nmkdir renamed # here we will transfer the renamed files\n\nfor dir in ./*/ ; do echo rsync -Pavzh $dir\"*.txt\" ./renamed/$(basename $dir )\".txt\" ; done | bash \n\nrm -r ./renamed/result.txt # only error due to having renamed included in the loop above\n\n", "Q: Mouse movement wakes computer from suspend, can't disable it When my laptop goes to suspend, a slight mouse movement wakes my laptop up.

For a 64-bit system you can as well use the following links to download the packages. Best do the now stated commands in a separate directory so you not install any other downloads you maybe did before.\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wxwidgets2.8/libwxgtk2.8-0_2.8.12.1+dfsg2-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wxwidgets2.8/libwxgtk2.8-dbg_2.8.12.1+dfsg2-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wxwidgets2.8/libwxgtk2.8-dev_2.8.12.1+dfsg2-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wxwidgets2.8/libwxbase2.8-dbg_2.8.12.1+dfsg2-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wxwidgets2.8/wx2.8-headers_2.8.12.1+dfsg2-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb\n\nNow you can go and install those by:\ndpkg -i wx2.8-headers_2.8.12.1+dfsg2-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb\ndpkg -i libwxgtk2.8-0_2.8.12.1+dfsg2-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb\ndpkg -i libwxbase2.8-dbg_2.8.12.1+dfsg2-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb\ndpkg -i libwxgtk2.8-dbg_2.8.12.1+dfsg2-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb\ndpkg -i libwxgtk2.8-dev_2.8.12.1+dfsg2-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb\n\n\nA: This is either a bug in the Ubuntu packaging (my guess) or a bug in code::blocks.

I wanted to be as detailed as I could. Also, I tried everything from this link: My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?   and it didn't help.\nFirst here's some background: A few days ago I successfully installed ubuntu 15.10 on my toshiba satillite c855d-s100, which has 4gb ram and an amd processor (I can't give you more details at the moment because I can't get into it).\nAt first I was having some trouble getting the live cd to run, but I fixed it by going into bios and enabling secure boot (I read that secure boot had to be disabled, but I couldn't boot the live cd until I enabled secure boot). Anyway, after I did that, I was able to successfully run the live cd and install ubuntu 15.10 on the laptop.\nAt first I had no problems. I was able to run ubuntu and reboot it several times without any issues, except that \"ignoring bgrt\" would appear on my screen for a split second before loading but otherwise ubuntu ran fine.\nSo now here's the problem: Last night I rebooted the laptop and after selecting ubuntu in the grub, the laptop booted to a blank purple screen. I let it sit there for 30 minutes and nothing changed. \nI tried adding nomodeset to the grub and the same thing happened. Sometimes it's a purple screen, sometimes it gets frozen at \"ignoring bgrt\" and stays stuck there. I tried putting nomodeset in front of quiet splash, I tried deleting quiet splash and adding nomodeset, I have tried putting nomodeset in between quiet and splash. Sometimes I get past 'ignoring bgrt' and see a string of text that ends with \"wmi: mapper loaded\" but it freezes there. \nI have also tried adding radeon.modeset=0 with the same results. I also tried adding either nomodeset or radeon.modeset=0 to the gfxmode line and got the\"wmi mapper loaded\" screen. I even tried deleting the gfxmode line completely and got nothing.\nI tried going into bios and disabling secure boot, but that leads to the same results as above.\nI have tried clicking on advanced options in grub and booting in recovery mode, but I get the black screen with a string of text that ends with \"wmi: mapper loaded\"  and freezes there. Also in the advanced options screen I tried to boot using a different kernal, but that froze at \"loading initial ramdisk\"\nI have tried running the live cd again, both with secure boot disabled and enabled, and I get to the grub that says \"try ubuntu without installing\" but I get frozen at the same \"ignoring bgrt screen\" again when I click on it\nDoes anyone have any ideas?\nAm I using nomodeset and the other commands wrong? Here is what the linux line in the 'edit grub' screen says:\n/boot/vmlinuz-4.2.0-34-generic.efi.signed root=UUID=c0e7414a-8d97-43c8-b9fb-0d1994fa5452 ro quiet splash $vt_handoff\nI described above all the ways I've added nomodeset and radeon.modeset=0 to that line. \nI have also tried adding nolapic with no effect. I also tried adding acpi=off and that led to a screen that had a string of text that ended with \"switching to radeondrmfb from EFI VGA\" where it then froze.\nWhat else can I do? I just don't get it. Ubuntu itself was working perfectly for two days and now this. \nUpdate: Now I've somehow managed to accidently wipe out the grub completely and the laptop boots directly into windows. And since I can't get the live CD to work anymore as described above, I can't do anything about that either. \nFor now, unless there's another solution other than what I've already tried, I think I'll just use that laptop to store my backups on the windows partition (I don't want to go back to using windows in my daily life, I love ubuntu) and just switch to my spare laptop, which has had ubuntu on it for months, and use that as my main laptop from now on.\n\nA: I ran into a similar issue with 4.2.0-34 not booting correctly, in the kernel params, I changed intel_pstate=disable and it worked, maybe you are seeing the same issue?

I've been considering upgrading my system from 14.04, but have been reading that LTS releases are probably the best for the long run. That being said I noticed that Ubuntu 14.04 will be discontinued after April 2019. \nAt this point there do not seem to be any other Ubuntu releases with dates beyond April 2019 so my question is  what will be the next LTS release from Ubuntu?  Or... which release will be maintained the longest?\n\nA: The usual Ubuntu documentation spots haven't been updated yet, but it is expected that 16.04 will be an LTS release, and that it will be supported until 2021. As can be seen on the Ubuntu wiki page on LTS:\n\nA new LTS version is released every 2 years.

I have windows 10 on the SSD and I have it set to boot UEFI only in BIOS (secure boot is off).\nI booted the installer USB perfectly fine in UEFI mode by selecting it from the bios (clearly said UEFI) and was created using dd on an ubuntu distro on my linux laptop with the ubuntu install iso , in UEFI mode (F12 boot menu). That booted okay. To install it on the other USB, I ran the install ubuntu menu function on the installer drive. Then setup my own partitions on the Installee USB. I made a 512mb efi partition (primary), a 27gb ext4 part (primary), and a 4gb swap part (also primary).\ni selected to install the bootloader to /dev/sdc. It installs great and reboots.\nOkay...so now things get a little odd. And I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here.\nWhen I look at my boot options at the F12 bootselector there are 4 options listed. Windows boot manager, ubuntu, ubuntu, (yes 2 of them) and Samsung 32gb UEFI boot (the usb drive is a samsung). If I select Windows it boots to windows. If I select Samsung 32GB UEFI it still boots to windows?! But if i select ubuntu...it boots to ubuntu on the 32GB USB drive.\nMore frustratingly, if I pull the USB drive out, the samsung UEFI boot option disappears but the ubuntu options remain. When you click on them without the USB drive in, it goes to a grub menu and won't boot. In bios those two ubuntu options are listed under the SSD drive meaning even though i specifically told it not to install there, it still installed grub on it?\nWindows fortunately will still boot if the windows boot manager is selected but this is very frustrating. Why did it mess with it? I went to windows repair and used bootrec and did both /FixMbr and /FixBoot but the ubuntu options remains. Grub seems to have stuffed itself somewhere but I don't know where! The USB drive will not boot on my laptop either (though the installer will boot in UEFI mode just fine). \nI'm not sure what I did wrong. I made sure I was in UEFI mode not BIOS mode when installing and I never selected anything that would touch /dev/sda in the booter to have it mess with my HD.\nFedora 23 will install just fine and boot in UEFI mode when installed to a USB drive.\nWould really appreciate some help! Thanks!\n\nA: You bumped into a known bug 1173457 in grub of always installing to the primary EFI instead of where you indicate.  However, you are also confused by the new UEFI boot mechanism -- The Ubuntu bootloaders (shim, grub) get put into the EFI filesystem in their own directory, /EFI/ubuntu, not overwriting anything Windows.  The simple solution is just to copy the primary disk's EFI filesystem over to the USB, and select it for the first boot device.  The other gotcha is that Ubuntu's grub is still unable to boot Windows with secure boot enabled, you will need to use the EFI boot menu (some function key at power-up to select device/oses), or disable secure boot.  \n\nDo add yourself to the bug \"list\" on 1173457 (the \"does this bug affect me question).  Since a second person has never added themselves, this bug, filed in 2013, has never even gotten to \"confirmed\", so maybe that's why it was never fixed.  \nGood question about the updates, but even if they go to the wrong ESP, the old versions keep working, so you might never know.\n\nA: When installing under EFI, the \"device for boot loader installation\" option (or whatever it's called; I haven't checked that detail) is ignored. I haven't verified that it actually works, but there is another way to specify where the boot loader goes: It's what partition is marked as an \"EFI boot partition\" or \"EFI System Partition\" (the term varies with the Ubuntu version) in the \"Something Else\" partition list. In theory, if you mark the ESP on the USB drive, and unmark the ESP on the hard disk, the installer should put GRUB 2 on the USB drive. I haven't tested that this actually works, but it should work.\nThat said, you're running into another problem, too: The EFI boot manager entry that you describe, for booting from a USB drive, does not launch the EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi file, which is where Ubuntu stores its first boot loader. Rather, that option launches the \"fallback\" EFI boot loader file, EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. This filename is used as a \"generic\" boot loader filename for removable media. The idea is that an OS installer or other external medium isn't likely to have a working NVRAM entry, so a standardized boot loader location is needed to boot OS installers, emergency disks, etc. Thus, if you want to make a USB drive that can be booted on any x86-64 EFI-based computer, you must copy EFI/ubuntu to EFI/BOOT and rename EFI/BOOT/shimx64.efi to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. IIRC, you'll have to leave EFI/ubuntu in place, too, since there are hard-coded paths in one or more binaries, so both directories are needed.\nAnother point: If you intend to use the USB drive on just one computer, you may be able to get away with not copying GRUB to EFI/BOOT; however, some EFIs clean up their NVRAM entries if they boot and notice that an entry is inaccessible. Thus, if you remove the USB drive and boot without it inserted, you may lose the ubuntu entry. For this reason alone, copying GRUB to the backup filename is desirable.\nThe reason you're seeing a grub> prompt when you try to launch the ubuntu option with the USB drive unplugged is because Ubuntu's GRUB configuration relies on a GRUB binary on the ESP (on your internal disk) and configuration files in the Ubuntu /boot partition (on the USB drive). Thus, when the USB drive is unplugged, GRUB launches, but can't read its configuration file, so it fails miserably.\n", "Q: xmodmap: where are its local settings stored?

I want to  know that If I will install ubuntu by completely erasing Win 10 then what will happen to the files of another drive (D) which has all the stuffs stored. I don't have any external hard disk to make a backup.\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu it will ask you where you want to install it. One of the options should be the c partition you want to install Ubuntu on (although Ubuntu dosent give drives a letter so check which one it is) and if you install it on 'c' it might not leave the other alone. If you want to be sure you can use the 'something else' option and choose the c partition.\n", "Q: Used apt-get to install chromium but how to start it? I am new to Ubuntu.

A password like \"lastyeariwenttolondonformyholiday\" is far superior over anything you can enforce even though it lacks numbers, capital letters or special characters.

If more info is needed, then feel free to ask.\n\nA: It doesn't really matter from what location you boot Ubuntu from and in what location you have drives with other data partitions. As long as it's connected, it's accessible.\nI'm now describing the possibilities. Probably the likeliness of infecting your Ubuntu system with malware that is capable of performing all those tasks is very close to zero, but it would be technically possible.\nTheoretically possible attacking scenarios:\nLet's first assume the easiest situation for malware: You have mounted the file systems on the internal Windows (? I assume this, but it doesn't matter) somewhere. This allows every program to access (read and write, depending on your mount options you might also restrict that though) all files on the mounted device simply by their path. Programs can/do usually not distinguish between data from different disks as Linux systems mount all partitions into the same virtual file system tree structure. So it's just like the files were on your Ubuntu drive. No difference as soon as it's mounted. The risk of damage is pretty high.\nThe other possible situation is that you did not mount the Windows partitions from Ubuntu. In that case no application (including malware of course) running as normal user can access the files there. To mount the partition root privileges are required, so that would be impossible as well unless you voluntarily enter your password in the wrong place. As long as you don't enter your admin password or run any possibly infected software as root, your Windows data is pretty safe.\nBut how would the situation change if either the malware you get is smart enough to bypass Ubuntu's user privilege restrictions and become root by itself or if you accidentally give it your admin password or manually run it as root? In that case the application can not only mount all available drives to access the contained file systems and do whatever it wants with the data there (steal data, delete or overwrite data, install other malware), it can also get direct read/write access to all connected raw disks and partitions without mounting them. This raw disk access is pretty useless to steal your data or modify something to inject other malware to your Windows system (unless it ships its own NTFS/other file system driver), but it is perfectly enough to make a data massacre and simply overwrite or format the entire partition or disk. This is an extreme risk for all your data on any connected device!\nConclusion:\nSoftware running under your normal account without root privileges can only damage data on unmounted devices/partitions if it is smart enough to exploit a not yet discovered and fixed security vulnerability in the Ubuntu system to cause a privilege escalation and become root without user interaction. You can protect yourself from this pretty unlikely case vary well by always installing all available software updates as soon as they get released. The risk that you yourself grant a malicious application root access by simply entering your password where you should not have done so is much higher. Be vigilant.\nData on a mounted device/partition is always in danger. Usually you mount the partition in a way so that your user account has full read/write access. So all applications you run can do the same, including malware.\nIf a malicious application somehow manages to run as root (by tricking you to enter the admin password or rarely by exploiting a vulnerability), there's nothing that can stop it from accessing all physically connected devices. It can either mount them and read/write access the containing file systems to get to your data or it can simply access the raw partition/disk and just format or overwrite it to harm you. Whatever runs as root on your system has ultimate powers over everything connected to the computer.\nHow to protect myself?\n\n\n*\n\n*Never enter your admin password in a password prompt you did not expect!\n\n*Always install the available updates as soon as possible.\n\n*Never install software or run scripts from untrusted sources.\nThe official Ubuntu repositories can be trusted, third party PPAs are usually safe (especially those maintained by well known teams) but are not necessarily checked. Remember that everybody can create a PPA. .deb packages downloaded from any arbitrary online source are highly insecure.\n\n*Never run anything as root that you do not ultimately trust.\n\n*Avoid doing anything as root wherever possible. Prefer a restricted user account for daily use over your admin account. \n\n*When you have to operate as root, do that using sudo or similar tools, do not log in as root. \n\n*When you have to run interactive applications as root (such as your files manager or an editor) try to keep the session as short as possible to avoid accidentally performing other tasks as root.\n\n", "Q: Partially moving samba user to the new server There are many questions like this one and many other good links, one of these link is: \nLink1\nBut this answer is useful too:\nThis\nI must not move all of the users from the old to the new, only some of them.\nI did already the part of adding the user and copying the hash password on the new server with the exception that the users got a new UID and in the /etc/shadow I only added the hash password in place of \"!\".\nThere is no way I'm able to sync the system password of the users with the samba's one.\nI created a test user and I've done the same thing, but I also run the command smbpasswd -a userTest with the result that after setting a random password and a service restart, this user can log into its folder\n(It's like I created a new samba user then.. nothing special and not even close to my goal).\nBut, I do not know the samba password of others and I can't even move all of them (not all and not again).\nDo you know how sohuld I proceed?

I run Ubuntu 15.10. Yesterday I installed some updates. As requested, I rebooted the computer and it froze at the very first screen with the Acer logo. I switched it off and on again and everything went fine. I got home later and i switched it again and the same story, computer freezes on the Acer splash screen. I found out that if I tried several times switching off and on more or less 1 out of 20 times it worked fine and the OS booted properly.\nWhat is happening? It is very strange to me that an OS update could be responsible for a problem like this, pretty much because the OS is not even booted when the computer freezes, but on the other hand the problems did start right after that update so I cannot help but wonder if they are related. \nSo, what could it be and what can I do to fix it?\n\nA: I changed a parameter in the BIOS so that now it does not by default show the ACER page splash screen, where the computer froze, but rather a screen with computer info.

My question is how can I expand the /dev/sda1 in order to get 14.3Gb - 3Gb  more space ?\n\nA: It seems that what you are having trouble with is a communication between Virtualbox, and your physical machine. When you load any OS/VM in Virtualbox you are asked to allocate a certain set space that it can use. What happens is that a \"fake disk\" is created, and that is what is used for the VM.

When parent process was killed , init process will possess the orphan process.\n\n*Is it necessary to use nohup if I want background a process?\n\n\nA: I don't fully understand your question, but I'll try to explain the use of nohup:\nFrom the manual page man nohup:\n\nnohup - run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non-tty\n\nSo nohup disconnects the standard input and output streams from the terminal (/dev/null becomes input, output goes to file nohup.out) and also shields the application from SIGHUP signals (hangup signal). This allows you to terminate the shell process from which you started the nohup-ed command without killing this child process.\n\nA similar way to prevent killing of a process when the parent shell gets terminated is disown:\nmy_command & disown\n\nThis runs my_command in background and disowns it from the parent process, but without performing any I/O redirection. It effectively makes the command an independent process, no longer being a child process of the parent shell.\n\nWhen you only want to run a process in background, but don't want to disown it from the current shell (so that it will be killed when the parent process exits), you can omit the nohup or disown and only use Bash's & :\nmy_command &\n\n", "Q: Recovery bootable partition How to create a partition on my hard drive containing Ubuntu/Windows ISO files so i don't have to create flash drives every time i screw something up?

I have done it and can confirm it works. Here's my procedure (this is assuming your computer is UEFI compatible, and that you have a UEFI boot menu):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the ISO for the version of Ubuntu you want.\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run sudo apt-get install unetbootin.\n\n*Install Gparted if you haven't already: sudo apt-get install gparted.\n\n*Open Gparted by searching for it in Dash or running gparted in the terminal.\n\n*Let Gparted scan your drives.\n\n*Select a partition on your hard drive that you are willing to downsize by about 8GB.\n\n*Right-click that partition and select the Resize/Move option.\n\n*In the MiB After field, enter 8192 and hit Enter before hitting OK.\n\n*Format the partition as FAT32. Feel free to label the partition something like \"UbuntuLive\".\n\n*Click the green check button toward the top of the Gparted window apply the resize and creation.\n\n*Let Gparted scan your drives again, and take note of the new partition's number (it will look something like /dev/sdXY). Close Gparted.\n\n*Once you're done with partitioning, search for Unetbootin in the Dash, or open it from the terminal by running unetbootin.\n\n*Once Unetbootin has opened, select the second option in it. (Something like \"Use an ISO file\").\n\n*Browse to your downloaded ISO and select it. (Go to Computer>>/home/username/Downloads)\n\n*There should be a dropdown in Unetbootin that has USB Drive currently selected. Change that to Hard Drive.\n\n*To the right of that, there should be another dropdown with a list of partitions. Select the one you created in Gparted.\n\n*Click the button near the bottom right to confirm your settings and \"burn\" the ISO to the partition.\n\n\nNow you should be able to reboot, go into your computer's boot menu, and see something like UEFI OS, or, if your computer is more featured, the actual name of the partition (UbuntuLive). Just select that to boot into an Ubuntu Live environment from your hard drive.\nIf your computer isn't UEFI capable, comment that, and I'll edit in a second set of instructions.\nIf any of the instructions confuse you, leave a comment, and I'll help walk you through the process.\n", "Q: Icon Missing Dolphin I freshly installed Ubuntu 16.04 with the Gnome environment.

By following this guide i was able to get it up and running.\nOnly issue now is I want to expand the current partition to fill up the rest of the disk, and it is encrypted and using LVM.\nGparted doesn't support this type of operation, so I have to resort to the CLI. However, I don't understand anything about manually resizing partitions and all the guides I can find are either focused on shrinking the partition or are horribly outdated.\nCan some partition guru provide a guide for me to follow?\nThanks\n\nA: After fiddling around for a long time, and failing multiple times (thank god for backups) I was able to resize it. Here goes my guide.\nThis assumes you have a partition table like mine: sda1 is swap and around 250MB, sda2 is a container with sda5 (our crypt volume) and a lot of free space in front of sda2, like so\n|sda1|sda2 (sda5)|free space|\n\nBoot to a LiveCD of your favourite distro. Run gparted and shrink your sda1 partition by around 20MB. This is because fdisk requires a buffer of unallocated space between the start of sda2 and sda5, dunno why. While you're at it increase the size of sda2 as far as it can go, all the way to the right.\nYou should end up with \n|sda1|free space|sda2 (sda5)|\n\nGo ahead and launch fdisk\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\npress p to print out the current partition scheme. Write down where sda5 starts.\npress d to delete first sda5 then sda2. Scary.\nNow press n to create a new volume. Press e to select type extended and number it 2. The defaults for start and end should be ok.\nNow create a new partition, type is Linux (should be default) and number it 5. The start value should be the same as the one you wrote down for sda5 before, the end value is the default one (as far as it can go).\nPress p again to be sure that everything is OK and press w to write your changes to disk.\nReboot into your live CD again.\nIf you open up gparted you should now have\n|sda1|sda2 (free space) (sda5)|\n\nFollow these steps:\nDecrypt your file system.\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda5 crypt1\n\nGet the live CD to recognize (activate) your LVM.\nsudo vgscan --mknodes\nsudo vgchange -ay\n\nResize the Crypt.\nsudo cryptsetup resize crypt1\n\nResize the (LVM) Physical Volume.\nsudo pvresize /dev/mapper/crypt1\n\nResize your root (LVM) Logical Volume.\nUnlock the (LVM) Physical Volume.\n sudo pvchange -x y /dev/mapper/crypt1\n\nResize the (LVM) Physical Volume.\n sudo lvresize -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/root\n\nRe-lock the physical volume.\n sudo pvchange -x n /dev/mapper/crypt1\n\nResize the filesystem.\nsudo e2fsck -f /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root\nsudo resize2fs -p /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root\n\nNow you should be OK to reboot and if everything went well you should have a bigger encrypted partition.\nNote: This method has the downside of robbing you of around 20MB of swap. If the swap resize isn't done, fdisk won't let you write sda5 in the required position (which may lead to corruption, I suspect). This caveat is necessary until someone explains exactly what fdisk is doing behind the scenes and if there is any way to get it to do our bidding.\n\nA: I just found a much simpler solution, needing just gparted under a live system boot and then one more command. It works with Ubuntu 20.04 and up.\n\n*\n\n*Create full backups, because any messing around with partitions and LVM can really lead to full data losses.\n\n\n*Boot from a live CD or installation medium. Because gparted cannot modify mounted disks.\n\n\n*Start gparted.\n\n\n*Decrypt. Right-click on the partition and select \"Open Encryption\".\n\n\n*Resize. Right-click on the partition and select \"Resize/Move\". You can try to resize so that it includes all available space, but gparted may tell you that this is impossible because it would \"allocate more sectors than available\". In that case, leave ~10 MiB of free space at the end.\n\n\n*Apply. Click the \"Apply\" button in gparted to actually do the resizing.\n\n\n*Reboot to your installation. All remaining tasks affect only LVM volumes inside the now-resized partition, and can be done with the partition mounted.\n\n\n*Determine the LV Path of the LVM volume you want to resize by looking at the output of sudo lvdisplay. Here, we assume it's /dev/ubuntu-vg/root, which is the default for the volume mounted to / in Ubuntu installations.\n\n\n*Resize the LVM volume and its filesystem. For that, execute the following command, using the LV path you determined.

What is logic behind it?\n\nA: tr is for translating characters, not for complete words. It can translate sets. In your example you have \"nik-pc\" as first collection chars, and \"root\" is another. In fact, k-p is a range, so it includes all chars from k to p. It will match chars one by one, so n will translate to r, i to o, k to o, and whatever else beyond 4th char will be t. That's why you have \"Desktop\" translated to \"Desottt\"\nYou can see it more clearly in this example:\n$ echo \"ABCDEF\" | tr \"ABCDEF\"  \"12\"                            \n122222\n\nHere you can see tr  set 1 have D in position 4. But set 2 has no position 4, so it will use last position set 2 has to translate.\nWhat you are doing is translating one word into another. What you want to do is use more advanced tool like sed or awk.\nFor instance,\n$ ls -l /etc/passwd | awk '{gsub(/root/,\"TEST\");print}'        \n-rw-r--r-- 1 TEST TEST 2575 Feb 29 12:30 /etc/passwd\n\n\nA: tr translates a string character-wise. It searches the letters from the first set and replaces them by those form the second set.\nYou had nik-pc as first set. tr expands the k-p part in that to all letters in the range from \"k\" to \"p\", so the set is equal to niklmnopc.\nYour second set was root. \nWhat tr now does is to search all occurrences of the first character in the (evaluated) first set and replace them with the first character of the second set. When there is no more character in set 2, it simply repeates its last character. See the table below:\nn --> r\ni --> o\nk --> o\nl --> t\nm --> t\nn --> t\no --> t\np --> t\nc --> t\n\nSo now it's clear why e.g. \"Desktop\" becomes \"Desottt\". The behaviour is fully correct and intended this way.\n\nWhat you're looking for instead can be achieved using sed:\nsed 's/nik-pc/root/g' ma.txt\n\nThe syntax is this:\nsed 's/SEARCH_PATTERN/REPLACE_STRING/FLAGS' INPUT_FILE\n\nSo we let it search for the pattern \"nik-pc\" and replace the entire match with \"root\". We need to add the \"g\" flag to enable global replacing. Without that, it would only replace each first match per line.\n", "Q: Why chown command can't take effect?  chown -Rf www-data.www-data /var/www/html/test/\n ls -l  /var/www/html/test\ntotal 192\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   418 Mar 17 21:31 index.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 19930 Mar 17 21:31 license.txt\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  7360 Mar 17 21:31 readme.html\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  5035 Mar 17 21:31 wp-activate.php\ndrwxr-xr-x  9 root root  8192 Mar 17 21:31 wp-admin\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   271 Mar 17 21:31 wp-blog-header.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  1369 Mar 17 21:31 wp-comments-post.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2866 Mar 17 22:10 wp-config.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2853 Mar 17 21:31 wp-config-sample.php\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 Mar 17 21:31 wp-content\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  3286 Mar 17 21:31 wp-cron.php\ndrwxr-xr-x 16 root root 16384 Mar 17 21:31 wp-includes\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2380 Mar 17 21:31 wp-links-opml.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  3316 Mar 17 21:31 wp-load.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 33770 Mar 17 21:31 wp-login.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  7887 Mar 17 21:31 wp-mail.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 13021 Mar 17 21:31 wp-settings.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 28594 Mar 17 21:31 wp-signup.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4035 Mar 17 21:31 wp-trackback.php\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  3061 Mar 17 21:31 xmlrpc.php\n\n df   /var/www/html/test\nFilesystem     1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda7        4869120 56812   4812308   2% /var/www/html\n blkid \n #some info ommitted\n/dev/sda7: UUID=\"   \" TYPE=\"vfat\" PARTUUID=\"   \"\nsudo chown -R  www-data.www-data /var/www/html/test/\nchown: changing ownership of ‘/var/www/html/test/’: Operation not permitted\ncat /etc/fstab\n# /var/www/html was on /dev/sda7 during installation\nUUID=3E3D-09A6  /var/www/html  vfat   defaults  0    0\n\nid\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\n\nmount\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\nudev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,relatime,size=10240k,nr_inodes=488907,mode=755)\ndevpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000)\ntmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,relatime,size=785640k,mode=755)\n/dev/sda3 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)\nsecurityfs on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\ntmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)\ntmpfs on /run/lock type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=5120k)\ntmpfs on /sys/fs/cgroup type tmpfs (ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=755)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,xattr,release_agent=/lib/systemd/systemd-cgroups-agent,name=systemd)\npstore on /sys/fs/pstore type pstore (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpuset)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpu,cpuacct)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/devices type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,devices)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,freezer)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls,net_prio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,net_cls,net_prio)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,blkio)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,perf_event)\nsystemd-1 on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=23,pgrp=1,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct)\ndebugfs on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw,relatime)\nhugetlbfs on /dev/hugepages type hugetlbfs (rw,relatime)\nfusectl on /sys/fs/fuse/connections type fusectl (rw,relatime)\nmqueue on /dev/mqueue type mqueue (rw,relatime)\n/dev/sda7 on /var/www/html type vfat (rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=utf8,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro)\n/dev/sda6 on /win7_d type vfat (rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=utf8,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro)\n/dev/sda1 on /win7_c type fuseblk (rw,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other,blksize=4096)\n/dev/sda2 on /home type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)\nrpc_pipefs on /run/rpc_pipefs type rpc_pipefs (rw,relatime)\ntmpfs on /run/user/109 type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,size=392820k,mode=700,uid=109,gid=118)\ntmpfs on /run/user/1000 type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,size=392820k,mode=700,uid=1000,gid=1000)\ngvfsd-fuse on /run/user/1000/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=1000,group_id=1000)\n\nIt is so strange for the fact ,i am root user,why no permission?\nWhy  chown command  can't take effect?\nHow to fix it?                                                              \n\nA: Based on your edits provided, your /var/www/html/ folder resides on an external device, /dev/sda7.  Based on the information provided, we can infer that the partition is a FAT/FAT32 partition (type='vfat').\nFAT/FAT32/exFAT partitions do not support UNIX-style permissions.  This is why you cannot chmod or chown the files sanely.\nTo make this work, you have to provide additional mount options in your /etc/fstab to automatically mount the partition to where it needs to be and to mount it with the permissions schema you need.\nIn this case, you should add to the existing mount options the following options, which will set the entire directory to be owned www-data:www-data and all files/folders with 755 permissions.  This should be added to any existing mount options, and NOT used as a replacement for existing options:\nuid=33,gid=33,umask=0022\n\nAdditional details on mounting Windows-style partitions may be found on the Ubuntu Help Pages on \"Mounting Windows Partitions\".\n\n\nAs a system administrator, I STRONGLY urge you to NOT use FAT/FAT32/Windows-style partitions for storing your website data.  There's no way to apply the same security permissions and schemas and settings to these types of partitions that can be done in a UNIX filesystem.  I will not go into detail on how to create such filesystem here, as you will need to have downtime and a lot more work to create such a filesystem to work with, as well as reloading data after the fact.\n\n", "Q: Create a progress bar in Bash How can I create a progress bar with bash?\nThis is my script:\n #!/bin/bash\n pass='number1 number12 number13 number14 number15 number16'\n chk='number14'\n for i in $pass ; do\n if [ \"$i\" == \"$chk\" ]; then\n echo ' Found ^_^'\n else\n echo 'loading 50%'\n fi\n done\n\nI want to replace echo 'loading 50%' with anything to create a progress bar.\n\nA: You can use zenity to create simple GTK dialog windows.

To make it useful, you should specify more information by adding some of the options below (excerpt from man zenity):\n   Progress options\n   --text=STRING\n          Set the dialog text\n   --percentage=INT\n          Set initial percentage\n   --auto-close\n          Close dialog when 100% has been reached\n   --auto-kill\n          Kill parent process if cancel button is pressed\n   --pulsate\n          Pulsate progress bar\n   --no-cancel\n          Hides the cancel button\n\nThere are two modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*pulsating: The progress bar is pulsating, it just indicates that something is running, but does not tell anything about the progress. You do this by setting the --pulsating option.\n\n*manual: You have to pipe the current progress percentage to the zenity command's  standard input to update the progress bar.\nAn example for this could look like that below. Note that the previous commands are grouped to a subshell so that all the output is redirected to the zenity dialog and not just that of the last command:\n(echo 10; sleep 2; echo 20; sleep 2; echo 50; sleep 2) | zenity --progress\n\n\nA: This code will do it, and doesn't require anything (other than bash, of course). It prints # signs, like you asked in your comment:\npass='number1 number12 number13 number14 number15 number16'\nchk='number14'\npassarr=($pass)\nlenProgressBar=${#passarr[@]}\n\necho -n '['\ni=0\n\nwhile [ $i -lt $lenProgressBar ]; do\n    echo -n '-'\n    ((i++))\ndone\n\necho -n ']'\ni=0\n\nwhile [ $i -lt $lenProgressBar ]; do\n    echo -e -n '\\b'\n    ((i++))\ndone\n\necho -e -n '\\b'\nfor i in $pass ; do\n    if [ \"$i\" = \"$chk\" ]; then\n        echo -e '#\\nFound ^_^'\n        break\n    else\n        echo -n '#'\n    fi\ndone\n\nHowever, if you have a lot to check, this will just fill your screen with # signs. To fix that issue, try this code:\nlenProgressBar=5\npass='number1 number12 number13 number14 number15 number16'\nchk='number14'\npassarr=($pass)\nlenPass=${#passarr[@]}\n\nif [ $lenProgressBar -gt $lenPass ]; then\n    lenProgressBar=lenPass\nelif [ $lenProgressBar -lt 1 ]; then\n    lenProgressBar=1\nfi\n\nlet \"chksForEqualsPrint = $lenPass / $lenProgressBar\"\necho -n '['\ni=0\n\nwhile [ $i -lt $lenProgressBar ]; do\n    echo -n '-'\n    ((i++))\ndone\n\necho -n ']'\ni=0\n\nwhile [ $i -lt $lenProgressBar ]; do\n    echo -e -n '\\b'\n    ((i++))\ndone\n\necho -e -n '\\b'\nn=1\n\nfor i in $pass ; do\n    if [ \"$i\" = \"$chk\" ]; then\n        echo -e '\\nFound ^_^'\n        break\n    else\n        if [ $n -eq $chksForEqualsPrint ]; then\n            echo -n '#'\n            n=1\n        else\n            ((n++))\n        fi\n    fi\ndone\n\nChange the 5 in the first line (lenProgressBar=5) to the length that you want your progress bar to be. It'll take longer to print a # sign with lower length progress bars than with higher length ones, but don't let the length of the progress bar exceed your screen size; it won't work well if you do. (It won't let you use a progress bar higher than the number of items you're checking or lower than 1)\n\nA: whiptail comes preinstalled on Ubuntu and many other distros, and will show full-screen (but still terminal-based) progress elements.\ndialog is a superset of whiptail, so this example will work equally well with both. It does provide more advanced UI elements, so it may come in handy if you're looking for user interaction such as file pickers and forms, but it has the disadvantage of not coming preinstalled on many systems.\n\n\nfor i in $(seq 1 100)\ndo\n    sleep 0.1 \n    echo $i\ndone | whiptail --title 'Test script' --gauge 'Running...' 6 60 0\n\nNote that the script output is interpreted as a percentage, so you may have to adjust your output accordingly.\nWhiptail and Dialog also allow you to modify the text at run time via a rather cryptic syntax:\nphases=( \n    'Locating Jebediah Kerman...'\n    'Motivating Kerbals...'\n    'Treating Kessler Syndrome...'\n    'Recruiting Kerbals...'\n)   \n\nfor i in $(seq 1 100); do  \n    sleep 0.1\n\n    if [ $i -eq 100 ]; then\n        echo -e \"XXX\\n100\\nDone!\\nXXX\"\n    elif [ $(($i % 25)) -eq 0 ]; then\n        let \"phase = $i / 25\"\n        echo -e \"XXX\\n$i\\n${phases[phase]}\\nXXX\"\n    else\n        echo $i\n    fi \ndone | whiptail --title 'Kerbal Space Program' --gauge \"${phases[0]}\" 6 60 0\n\n\npv shows the progress of a file or stream being piped through it.

This is required because volume level can change many times a second and the default bubble message behavior is for a message to stay on the desktop for many seconds.\nSample popup bubble message\n\nPopup bubble message bash code\nFrom the script above the main function was copied to a new functioned called VolumeBar in an existing bash script called tvpowered. The exit 0 command in the copied main function was removed.\nHere's how to call it and let Ubuntu's notify-send command know we will be spamming popup bubble message:\nVolumeBar $CurrVolume\n# Ask Ubuntu: https://askubuntu.com/a/871207/307523\nnotify-send --urgency=critical \"tvpowered\" \\\n    -h string:x-canonical-private-synchronous:volume \\\n    --icon=/usr/share/icons/gnome/48x48/devices/audio-speakers.png \\\n    \"Volume: $CurrVolume $Bar\"\n\nThis is the new line which tells notify-send to immediately replace last popup bubble:\n-h string:x-canonical-private-synchronous:volume \\\n\nvolume groups the popup bubble messages together and new messages in this group immediately replaces the previous. You can use anything instead of volume.\n", "Q: Will xubuntu and lubuntu give better performance for software development tools I have tried xubuntu and lubuntu and found battery sacing distro. Will these distros provide me enough performance for using software development tools like eclipse, netbeans, tomcats, xampp etc\nThank you\n\nA: xUbuntu, lUbuntu and any other official release based on Ubuntu share the same pool of repositories. It is just that all of them use a different desktop and use different default applications. \nIf you need to run any of these systems you probably have a system that is not as powerful as needed to run Ubuntu. But that does not stop you from picking Eclipse, Netbeans, Tomcat to install if you do not like the default or preferred applications for that system. They will work. Some will install a lot of dependencies you would not have to install otherwise but it is possible. The applications made for your system should be preferred over the other applications since those are optimized for that system. Kate (editor) works best on kUbuntu, works on Ubuntu but you really should use gEdit.\nThe only one I would avoid is Xampp. Our native lamp stack (installed with sudo apt-get install lamp-server^) is far superior, better documented and works out of the box. \n", "Q: How to upgrade only the software (but not upgrade Ubuntu release) via shell?

So I was wondering if it is possible to boot from a dvd and continue on a usb drive with linux installed on it (so not a live usb).

It's a much simpler process. I'm only posting all this because I tried that first and it didn't work.\nSteps I took:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Windows.\n\n*Delete Ubuntu's partitions (type 'partition' in the search and it should come up; make sure you only delete ones that Windows says it\ndidn't create/doesn't recognize).\n\n*Create a Windows recovery drive (again, type 'recovery' into the search and there should be an option that says \"create a recovery\ndrive). I used a USB thumbdrive for this step.\n\n*Reboot your computer, and spam the key your motherboard uses to start setup (in my case, this was Del,\nbut it could also be Esc or one of the function keys.). This part may require some trial and error, but it shouldn't\nbe too hard to figure out after a couple restarts.\n\n*Once in your BIOS/UEFI, change the boot order to have USB drives at the top. There should be an abundance of videos on YouTube to help\nwith this, but just in case, here's a helpful article.\n\n*Save and exit the BIOS/UEFI (usually F10).\n\n*Your computer should boot into the recovery environment stored on the USB you set up. I have Windows 10, but the process should be more\nor less the same for other versions: go to Troubleshoot > Advanced >\nCommand Prompt, and enter bootrec.exe /fixmbr.\n\n*After Step 7, both Ubuntu and GRUB (the screen that lets you choose between booting into Ubuntu or Windows) should both be gone.\nAt this point, you can re-install Ubuntu from a Live USB, etc. as\nnormal.\n\n\nSource I used (in case my instructions are unclear): \nUninstall Linux and GRUB from Windows 8 Dual-Boot\nNote: I did this on a Windows 10 dual-boot system, but the process is almost identical.\nAfter all this is completed and Ubuntu is set up again, simply search for \"Disk\" in the Dash, unmount the partition/drive you're trying to rename (click the \"stop\" square), then right-click and select \"edit filesystem\".

If I run a sudo command it will ask me for a password, however in that Terminal session for the next few minutes it will allow me to run sudo commands without asking me for a password as it will cache that I am allowed.\nThis is good for convenience, and I find it rather convenient so I don't want to fix this by meaning it asks for a password every time instead of caching.\nBut what I have recently found has been something rather worrying, if I create a little script like this for instance:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo rm -rf /\n\nAnd I execute it as the normal user in Terminal before I have executed any sudo commands then all is well and works as expected, it prompts me for the sudo password. However if I am to run a sudo command before executing this script without sudo it will cache that sudo commands should not ask for a password for a few minutes in this session and then even though I did not give the script sudo privileges it will not prompt me for a password and the script will be allowed to execute whatever sudo commands it wants.\nNow I'm not the sort to execute many scripts without knowing what's in them but sometimes I have to install stuff from a script which I got from a trusted location, but I don't know for sure if there isn't anything bad in the script so I would like the piece of mind that it's not going to just hijack the sudo ability that has been granted to my Terminal session.\nSo my questions is, is it possible to make it so that I can run sudo commands and it will cache it for me, but then if I run a script not with sudo for the script not to be able to just hijack that ability? I understand that me executing the script is basically the same as me just executing the commands in the script in the order they are in there, but is there not a way of doing something clever so that it runs in a slightly different way or so that sudo is restricted for scripts that I run?\nReally anything though that I didn't run with sudo shouldn't be able to run things with sudo. Including commands. If they are only hijacking the cached ability that is...\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\nI have a suggestion for how this could be done but I don't know the practicalities of this: could I make it so that when I execute a command and it starts running it it logs that to a file (like is done with all Terminal commands though maybe a bit too late for this - with the history command) and then when sudo is run it checks if I executed that command in Terminal (through the use of the log that logs when I do) and if not then it is assumed that it's not by me so it prompts me for a password?\n\nA: You can run\nsudo -k\n\nbefore you run your script.  It will clear the cached credentials and the next sudo will ask again for your password.\nHere's a way to do what you want (I think).\n\n\n*\n\n*Move your sudo elsewhere: \nmv /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/sudo_real\n\n\n*Put the following into usr/bin/sudo:\n#!/bin/bash -i\n# Allows 'sudo' to be run with cached credentials from the command line,\n# but clears the cache if run from within a script.\n# Get the last command executed manually from the history\nLAST_COMMAND=`history | tail -n 1 | cut -c 8-`\n\nif [[ \"${LAST_COMMAND}\" == \"sudo \"* ]]; then\n    # The last command was 'sudo' - i.e. the user ran sudo \n    sudo_real \"$@\"\nelse\n    # The last command was NOT sudo - so this sudo was called from within a script.\n    # Force the cached credentials to be cleared. \n    sudo_real -k \"$@\"\nfi\n\n\n*Make the new /usr/bin/sudo executable: \nchmod a+x /usr/bin/sudo\n\n\n*Alias sudo to update the bash history when you run it from a shell by putting this in your ~/.bashrc: \nalias sudo=\"history -a;sudo\"\n\nNow, when YOU run sudo ... it will put the sudo ... into the bash history and the script will find it and run sudo_real.  But when another script runs sudo, it won't be in the history, and it'll call sudo_real -k.\nI think this is incredibly hairy, and I'd just live with the risk or use a new shell for scripts I didn't trust, personally :-)\n\nA: My stance on this issue is this : if you are unsure whether or not you may or may not run an app with root privillege while your credentials still haven't timed out, then just disable the timeout at all, make it 0. Specifically you need this setting in your /etc/sudoers file:\nDefaults    timestamp_timeout=0\n\nMan page defines it like so:\n timestamp_timeout\n                   Number of minutes that can elapse before sudo will ask\n                   for a passwd again.  The timeout may include a frac‐\n                   tional component if minute granularity is insufficient,\n                   for example 2.5.  The default is 15.  Set this to 0 to\n                   always prompt for a password.  If set to a value less\n                   than 0 the user's time stamp will never expire.  This\n                   can be used to allow users to create or delete their\n                   own time stamps via “sudo -v” and “sudo -k” respec‐\n                   tively.\n\nHowever, if you intend to be prudent, you can define the following function in .bashrc\nsudo_check()\n{\n  real_path=\"$( realpath $1 )\"\n  file \"$real_path\" | grep -q -i script\n  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n     grep -q 'sudo' \"$real_path\"  && \\\n     { echo '>>> ALERT: Its a script that requests sudo';\n       echo '    resetting sudo timestamp';\n       echo 'please rerun with sudo appended ';\n     }\n     sudo -k\n  else\n     sudo \"$@\"\n  fi\n\n}\n\nThis function will check whether or not a script contains call to sudo and alert you of that. Bellow is example of me running that function on a script ( which is my login screen background  changer by the way )\n$ sudo_check sergrep/chgreeterbg.sh                            \n>>> ALERT: Its a script that requests sudo\n    resetting sudo timestamp\n\n\nA: How can you differentiate between a script and an executable binary command?\nOf course you can think of defining a function named sudo that will have the sanity checks before running the actual binary but \n\n\n*\n\n*As the script can have any name, what if a script has a name like ls? So checking for extensions like .sh won't help\n\n*Also reading shebang as the first line of the script won't help too because a script can run without having a shebang\n\n\nI think, if you are too paranoid about it, you can think of disabling password caching altogether by creating an alias like:\nalias sudo='sudo -k'\n\nand put it in your ~/.bashrc.\n", "Q: How to disable integrated webcam on ubuntu? I have a notebook Dell Inspiron Model 14 3437-A30 and in my gtalk appears that the camera is turned on and is automatically turned on, but the light is not on. Also, unfortunately there is no keyboard shortcut.\nI tried to use the cheese program, but it only activates the webcam.\nI feel that my webcam is being automatically turned on without turning on the light.\nHow do I disable my webcam so the gtalk not show that my webcam is turned on? or how to make my webcam is not automatically activated?\n\nA: Try to find the driver for your webcam and unload it. I don't have Dell Inspirion so I don't know what driver you have for webcam. Try to find it with\nlsmod\n\nIn my case it was uvcvideo. When you find it unload it. In my case the command was:\nsudo rmmod uvcvideo\n\nAfter I removed it, the cheese did not find the device any more and it couldn't work. Then try to load it again. In my case the command was\nsudo modprobe uvcvideo\n\nIf your driver is not uvcvideo replace it in the commands with your driver name. Make a test too to see that your application does not load the driver. It is a small possibility for that also because root privileges are required to load kernel modules.\n\nA: Instead of disabling the uvcvideo driver (which disables all the webcams), you can also disable one webcam and keep all the others functional. For that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out the device string of the webcam you want to disable:\nfor device in $(ls /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/product); do \n  echo $device; cat $device; \ndone\n\nThis will show result lines like this:\n/sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.6/product\nIntegrated Camera\n\nIn which case the device string we look for is 1-1.6.\n\n*Disable the webcam using your device string in a command like this:\necho '1-1.6' | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind\n\n\n*To enable your webcam at a later time, use your device string in a command like this:\necho '1-1.6' | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/bind\n\nFor more details, see: \"Disabling the Webcam or USB Ports on Linux\".\n\nA: As an alternative command to rmmod you can use this to disable the camera until reboot:\nsudo modprobe -r uvcvideo\n\nAnd if you get the error message: modprobe: FATAL: Module uvcvideo is in use, you can try to force its removal with rmmod using the -f parameter:\nsudo rmmod -f uvcvideo\n\nTo enable your webcam back again, type:\nsudo modprobe uvcvideo\n\n", "Q: Edit EFI file paths for Windows Boot Manager from Xubuntu 14.04 I've been trying for some time to fix a mistake I have made around a month ago with Windows 8 after installing Xubuntu beside it. In order to make my laptop run GRUB2 instead of the original Windows Boot Loader I edited through command lines using bcdedit on Windows the EFI file paths of the Windows Boot Manager.\nAfter many issues, I had to format my HDD and I could only install a Linux operating system. Windows ones could not, my laptop not even finding a boot file on the Windows recovery disk. I do believe that, since the Windows Boot Manager has different paths that it should have for loading EFI files, it cannot boot any Windows anymore. I have attempted with windows 7, 8 and 10 on disks and USB keys.\nBy the way, I have attempted to boot Windows disks by using VirtualBox using the physical HDD. When in non-EFI mode, the installation software runs well but refuses to install anything because of the disk's format. When in EFI mode, being my HDD's, it freezes before launching.\nI have seen posts about rEFInd and boot-repair but before trying these out I'd love to know if someone could reply to the question beneath.\nIs is possible to manually edit these paths from Ubuntu ? It has to be stored somewhere but I cannot seem to find where.\n===============\nSolution found with the help of ubfan1 :\nI opened a terminal and typed the command bellow to have a list of the UEFI boot entries :\nsudo efibootmgr -v\nI deleted the Windows Boot Manager entry and another boot entry called \"Yes\" by typing :\nsudo efibootmgr -B {boot_entry} for both.\nI rebooted and noticed I no longer had the Windows Boot Loader. I booted into Ubuntu and added it back by typing :\nsudo efibootmgr -L \"Windows Boot Manager\" -l \"/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\" -p 1\nI then rebooted into Ubuntu and noticed the changes had been made. It was possible once again to boot Windows from any device.\n\nA: efibootmgr is the program to manage the UEFI boot items and their order.  The man page has full instructions.  \n\nMaybe Packard Bells have to set \"trust\" on your (new) efi boot files.\nSee problems with dual boot om package bell  Set secure boot, select \"Select a UEFI file for trusting\".  You might get additional choices after you enable the supervisor password.  Search this site for Packard Bell and see what you find.\n  Entering Windows boot entries in efibootmgr is pretty much the same as entering Ubuntu entries.  \nsudo efibootmgr -v  \n\nto check what's there.  A typical Windows entry looks like:  \nBoot0004* Windows Boot Manager  HD(2,e1800,82000,04b9edc2-fc48-11e1-8ec1-e7137b3aaf29)File(\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi)WINDOWS.........x...B.C.D.O.B.J.E.C.T.=.{.9.d.e.a.8.6.2.c.-.5.c.d.d.-.4.e.7.0.-.a.c.c.1.-.f.3.2.b.3.4.4.d.4.7.9.5.}...n.............\n\nEntering a new one (-p for the EFI partition, defaults to 1)\nsudo efibootmgr -L \"Windows Boot Manager\" -l \"/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\" -p 1\n\nMaybe -c to create or -b to edit an existing entry, check the man pages.  Maybe need the backslash \\ instead of slash / for the paths.\n", "Q: Problems running anything with elevated privileges in GUI This problem started today.

I sort of solved the problem by creating /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/60-myauthority.conf and specifically adding my username to AdminIdentities\nThat still doesn't explain why PolicyKit is not honoring the sudo group in /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/51-ubuntu-admin.conf, as I've stated I'm in the sudo group.\n\nA: I just had exactly the same behaviour - adding the users to the authority list gives them access, but not the group.\nIn my case I had to reinstall the package libpolkit-gobject-1-0, which I somehow accidentially removed.\nSeems that policykit needs that library to find out in which groups a user is.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Problems with Firefox 44 and Firefox 45 I am a user of Ubuntu 12.04 x64 almost since its release and i can say that i am very satisfied with it.\nBut recently i ran into two problems both concerning Firefox which is my main browser.\nWhen Firefox was updated to version 44 i had serious problems with videos and Firefox crashed every time a video was present in the page i visited.\nThis problem is also mentioned here. I followed the instructions and the problem was fixed until the next update of Firefox where the problem returned. I have also seen this thread and i even found this in Mozilla and submitted my feedback, but unfortunately i had no success in finding a solution. \nOf course there are no such problems in the corresponding version in windows which i use for work.\nMy solution was to use FF43 or, since i plan on upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 when it is released, i used an extra disk and installed ubuntu 15.10 just to see if i still had such a problem. \nThe result was that in Ubuntu 15.10 FF was working ok until version 45 in which videos are OK but one of my main add-ons, (x-notifier) stopped working properly to the point that it is unusable. Again the only viable solution for me is to use FF44.\nAgain, no such problems in the windows versions of FF and my FF profile is always the same.\nNow, i am aware that i maybe mixing two separate problems in one post and i apologize if it is so. But as an end user i find it hard to not combine these two, because to me it seems as there is a pattern involving FF and Ubuntu.\nAs i am planning to upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 anyway, it is not a big problem for me to wait for a couple of months and in the meantime use FF44 or FF43.\nBut i am afraid that there will be something wrong with FF and Ubuntu 16.04 also !\nIf someone is aware of anything that might help it will be great.\nThanks in advance for any feedback submitted, and i am always grateful both to all the people who make these awesome pieces of software and to the people answering questions !\n\nA: I believe it is a problem with Firefox 45 and 46, I had the same.

It appears to be bug with that kernel version reported on 3/16/16:\ncryptsetup tcryptOpen doesn't work anymore\nMy temporary fix was to revert back to the previously installed kernel version.\nConfirm current version:\n$ uname -r\n3.13.0-83-generic\n\nRemove 3.13.0-83 version:\n$ sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.13.0-83-generic\n\nReboot your machine and confirm version:\n$ uname -r\n3.13.0-79-generic\n\nKernel 3.13.0-79-generic works for me and no longer get any error messages with cryptsetup.\nSince you appear to be on a much newer version 3.19.0-56 you may need to somehow get to 3.19.0-51 which one of the commentators in the bug indicates it was still working \"fine\".  \nInstead of downgrading, you may try booting into that specific version via grub and setting it as your default.\n", "Q: Definitive and immediate way to export a path Assume I want to export a path, let's say FOOBAR and make the changes not only effective immediately and everywhere but also permanent. My goal is to have a list of commands that can be entered manually in an active shell session as well as executed from within a shell script (which in turn might be executed via the shell or a GUI file manager etc.).\nOld processes don't need to be aware of any changes.\nHere's what I want to happen to FOOBAR:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a new value without overwriting previous values.\n\n*Make the change accessible system-wide (for any program or shell session, no matter how it is launched) within the current user context.\n\n*Make the change effective immediately (i.e. no logout required etc.)\n\n\nMy current approach is exporting the value as a set-command to both .profile and .bashrc:\necho \"export FOOBAR=$FOOBAR:$HOME/example/\" >> $HOME/.profile;\necho \"export FOOBAR=$FOOBAR:$HOME/example/\" >> $HOME/.bashrc;\nsource $HOME/.profile;\n\nHow can this be improved in terms of:\n\n\n*\n\n*It does work, but are there cases where this will fail and how can I avoid them (i.e. are there any common processes or actions a ubuntu user will make etc. that will break my exported path)?\n\n*Are there any security concerns to this approach and how can those be fixed?\n\n*Are there any other collisions or negative consequences I have to pay attention to, in order to make this as universal as possible (within the ubuntu family)?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*it should be either ~/.profile or .bashrc. Not both since /.bashrc is loaded -from- ~/.profile. \n\n*A non-login shell will only load ~/.bashrc and not /etc/profile, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login or ~/.profile so if that is a concern ~/.profile is not going to be used. \n\n*a non-login with no shell will load the configuration set at $BASH_ENV. Have not found what is loads but ~/.bashrc should be one of them.\n\n\nRegarding your 1st bullet point:\n\n\n*\n\n*That is probably not a good idea. And probably not how it works. When you reload environment variables they will start from empty (assuming you meant it should not empty on reloading them ;-) ).\n\n\nRegarding your 2nd bullet point:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you want it for all users use /etc/profile or /etc/environment. /etc/environment is the correct place for system wide environment variables. And also: this rules out ~/.profile.\n\n\nRegarding your 3rd bullet point:\n/etc/environment does not require a reboot. It requires a re-login. And it should be done with a re-login; you can source it again but that only applies to your session and what is started after you sourced it. Not for already running processes.\nNevertheless\n. /etc/environment\n\nis a method to reload all variables. But again: this does not reset them for currently running processes. Only for the current shell and newly started processes.\nRegarding 4th, 5th, 6th bullet point: \nOnly problem I can see is it could run wild. If you add it to ~/.bashrc and source that 10, 20 times your variable is going to get flooded with the same parts. \nAnd no and no.

Now navigate to the 'lightdm-gtk-greeter-conf.d' directory and you should see a file similar to '99_ubuntu-mate.conf'. For me, this was the right config file for the greeter, or login screen. \n5) Open the file and then you want to go to the line [greeter], where the commenting ends. Below that line you should see a line labelled 'background = /usr/share/backgrounds/ubuntu-mate-common/Ubuntu-Mate-Cold-lightdm.jpg'. This is the line you want to edit. Replace the original file with any jpg image of your choosing, save, and upon reboot your login screen background image should be changed. If you wish to replace the background with another stock Ubuntu Mate background, then the images are stored in /usr/share/backgrounds.

I'm not at all concerned with being able to toggle/turn off the LED, I simply want the LED to turn on before login, i.e. while looking at the login screen, the LED should already be on.\nI've set up a keyboard shortcut to run xset led 3, but this is less than ideal, as I have to be logged in in order to use the shortcut. I'd like this to happen automatically instead.\nI'm very new to both Linux and scripting, so please ELI5/walk me through it. I know that you can run scripts at startup as per this, but I don't understand how to actually write the script or how to \"put it in\" /etc/rc.local. Do I simply fire up gedit and type xset led 3 directly into rc.local below the #comments, but above the exit 0? Do I make another script somewhere else and link to it in rc.local?

I want to add some files to a .hdd file, but I do not know how I can mount it.

In the case of that guide, to qcow2 format which is a Qemu format.\nRelevant part:\n\nFrom the command-line, run the following (substituting xxx for the name of your .hds file\nsudo qemu-img convert -c -p -f parallels -O qcow2  xxx.hds  myNewVM.qcow2\n\nThis should start the conversion, which in my case took a few hours for a 40 GB  hds file.

Then insert the disk into the DVD Drive of your laptop. During the setup, it will ask you where to install Windows.Then click \"Drive Options\"  Then you will see a list of drives and partitions similar to this: Now you will be able to either remove Ubuntu completely or just re-size the partition.

Somehow since updating Kubuntu to version 15.10 the Dolphin filemanager refuses to start by clicking on the icon. It appears to start as shown by the 'dancing' icon but then does not show up.\nHowever it can be started by typing the command: dolphin in the Konsole. Then at first it shows an empty screen and the error message The file or the folder file:/home/user does not exist where user is my username and I've translated this text from Dutch, so the English version might be a bit different.\nWhen pressing the enter key the text in the addressbar file:/home/user is replaced by /home/user which is the correct folder and then I can see my files.\nKubuntu is fully updated.\n\nA: Problem #1 Dolphin doesn't find it's start-folder (solved)\nGoto the dolphin-menu-bar choose \"Adjustments\" -> Start\nlookup -> Start-Folder\nWhat adress is inserted there?\npick \"/home/USERNAME\"¹ (without exclamation marks) or browse to it.\nWhat was exactely right, was starting the program from commandline via Konsole. This gives hints. You can easily switch to reporting-language like this:\nLang=C dolphin \n(this is valid for any program-then it returns the output in english and you don't need to translate it for publication). It's always prefered to have the output of the command in full.\n(1) USERNAME must replaced with the real username -> Type in Terminal\nwhoami – to make sure it fits.\nProblem #2 Dolphin can't be started from the menu\nAs you say, you can start Dolphin from Konsole - than the same error might appear in the .desktop file. This files resides in /usr/share/applications/ . As normal user you can read it, but not change anything. This would need kdesudo kate to edit & correct. I would recommend you to copy the current text-content & use paste.ubuntu.com to link this then to here.\nThis allows us to see if the contents are faulty. One of the rules of error-correction is doing a proper error-analysis (especially via distance). \nA personal tip (that helped me lot): before you make any changes to the file, make a screencopy beforehand (KSnapshot). Such helps most times, if an error is worth qualifying for a bugreport or if you have to revert it to the previous state. \n\nA: Finally solved the problem. The command to invoke Dolphin reads dolphin %i -caption \"%c\" %u while it apparently is supposed to be dolphin %u. After this correction Dolphin starts immediately.\n", "Q: Can I install Nessus on two different systems with the same email address?

But I want to use the mousepad of my laptop. \nCan anyone help me to fix this?\n\nA: In general, a little bit more information is needed in order to have an idea of the computer you are running. Although most hardware is supported in linux nowadays, it does not mean that yours is fully supported. What was the laptop running before you installed ubuntu 14, was it another linux distribution where the touchpad was working? \nThe fact that it does not work could mean that you may need a more recent distribution for that hardware (What made you think that ubuntu 14 was fully supported?). \nAbout debugging touchpads in general, some useful reading can be found here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingTouchpadDetection.\nOn my laptop if i run \ncat /proc/bus/input/devices | grep -i touch\nI get the following device N: Name=\"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad\"\nWhat do you get?\nBe aware that in some HP laptops, there is a button (often on the touchpad itself) which will turn off the touchpad -- unlikely for that to be your problem, I thought it worth mentioning.\nCheers.\n\nA: Try going to \"Mouse and touchpad\" in your settings and should be a button to enable or disable the touchpad.\n", "Q: What is \"Ubuntu Web Browser\"? Even though Firefox is the default browser on the desktop version of Ubuntu, there's another option included in System->Default Applications.\n\nEnabling this option brings up \"Ubuntu Web Browser\" with no titlebar menu and only a number of options in a small menu.  \n\nHowever, there's no information about what this browser is, what web engine it's based on, or even who built it (obviously we can presume it's Canonical, but then, why not say that somewhere?).  There's no \"About\" in the menu, either.\nThe process appears to be called webbrowser-app.  Calling webbbrowser-app --help yields some command-line options, but still no actual information.\n$ webbrowser-app --help\nUsage: webbrowser-app [-h|--help] [--fullscreen] [--maximized] [--inspector] [--app-id=APP_ID] [--new-session] [URL]\nOptions:\n  -h, --help         display this help message and exit\n  --fullscreen       display full screen\n  --maximized        opens the application maximized\n  --inspector[=PORT] run a remote inspector on a specified port or 9221 as the default port\n  --app-id=APP_ID    run the application with a specific APP_ID\n  --new-session      do not restore open tabs from the last session\n\nAnd there's no man page either:\n$ man webbrowser-app\nNo manual entry for webbrowser-app\nSee 'man 7 undocumented' for help when manual pages are not available.\n\nWhere is the information on this software?\n\nA: This is the browser designed for Ubuntu Touch.\nIt's designed for touch screen devices, and is not very intuitive when used with a keyboard or mouse.  It's designed to be swiped with your finger.\nThis browser is a lightweight UI on top of the Oxide browser engine.  The Oxide browser engine is just a web view control allowing a Chromium web view to be embedded in other apps.  So, technically, it is webkit based.\nIt's only relatively recently that it's been included in the desktop editions of Ubuntu, and was never really intended to be used much on a traditional desktop, which may explain (but not excuse) the relative lack of documentation.\n\nA: The browser is called Oxide (blog post announcing it).\n\nHow can Canonical be so remiss in providing no manpage, no \"About\", and no general information on how or what this software actually is?\n\nFile a bug.\n\nA: I'll answer only on your first question:\n\nWhere is the information on this software?\n\nI've been able to find the information about this software easily, using the native \"Ubuntu Software\" app: I found this \"Browser\" in the list of installed apps. It's said there:\n\nBrowser\nBrowse the World Wide Web\nA lightweight web browser tailored for Ubuntu, based on the Oxide browser engine and using the Ubuntu UI components.\n\nThis is not much info, but this is all that was there.\nBTW, by googling its description I immediately found an article mentioning it on Ubuntu Help Wiki pages and its project on Canonical's Launchpad (and the Oxide project too).\n", "Q: Is nomodeset still required? I'm going to be installing Ubuntu 15.10 soon after a break from Linux for a while. I would like to know if nomodeset is still required on newer Ubuntu releases and newer nVidia GPUs. I have a GTX970.\nAlso, would be better to install the proprietary driver from nVidia, or choose the driver from \"Additional Drivers\", or use the edgers PPA and grab the latest one from there?\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Xubuntu 18.04 version that runs on Nvidia GPU.\nI  tried to installed the latest Nvidia-390 and nvidia-prime drivers and updated my driver installs as these solutions show [1] [2], and I added nouveau to the block list, but none of these worked. \nSo what I did is that I added the parameternouveau.modeset=0 to grub.cfg file in \\boot\\grub\\ directory. \nI added the line after every \"linux...\" line, for instance:\nmenuentry 'FAILSAFE' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n    recordfail\n    set gfxpayload=$linux_gfx_mode\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='(hd0,msdos8)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 36286167-4eba-4a1e-a202-155c6baafa01\n    linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.37-12-generic root=UUID=36286167-4eba-4a1e-a202-155c6baafa01 ro vt.handoff=7 quiet splash nouveau.modeset=0\n    initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.37-12-generic\n    } \n\nSo, I believe you have to add this parameter in all the script. I tried this solution and Nvidia GPU driver stopped crashing. \nAnother approach as described here\nExecute sudo nano /etc/default/grub and add the parameter nvidia-drm.modeset=1 to the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. Save the change you've made and run sudo update-grub.\nRestart the Ubuntu operating system, and now, everything should work properly - right as expected.\n\nA: You should use the parameter nouveau.modeset=0 instead of nomodeset.\nInstall the Ubuntu system and the proprietary NVIDIA drivers in this way :  \nBoot from the Ubuntu DVD/USB installation media you had created before.  \nHighlight the option 'Try Ubuntu without installing' and press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line - press F10 to boot.  \nInstall the Ubuntu operating system - when finished reboot the computer.\nHighlight the Ubuntu entry in the GRUB boot menu and press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line - press F10 to boot.\nOn the login screen press Ctrl+Alt+F1\nEnter user name and password - execute :\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352\nsudo reboot  \n\nGenerally it is recommended to use the NVIDIA drivers from the official Ubuntu repositories.\nBut as you have very new graphics hardware, you can install the latest official NVIDIA drivers.\nThe xorg-edgers PPA does not provide the drivers anymore and was replaced by GPU Drivers.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-361\nsudo reboot  \n\nAfter the installation adding the parameter nouveau.modeset=0 is not necessary anymore.\n\nA: Just an observation: our machines with NVIDIA GTX 10xx GPUs and Ryzen CPUs often got stuck with \"soft lockup\" and needed hard restart. Other machines with nomodeset and also the said machines after this setting did not get stuck. So there seems to be causality beyond boot.\nSee also: NMI Watchdog: BUG: soft lockup\n\nA: No, it's not required anymore. I was also facing similar problem. Using nomodeset I can boot into the system but now I solved the problem another way round. Only thing we need to do is to upgrade or downgrade the kernel version. https://askubuntu.com/a/1014753 This forum has explained how to access advanced option in ubuntu. Now when we enter into advanced option we can see linux kernel versions like: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6PEl9.png\n\n\n*\n\n*Now navigate to the lower version of kernel using arrow keys but\nleave all the recovery modes kernels.\n\n*Leaving the recovery modes kernel, select the lowest version of\nkernel and hit enter.\n\n*Now it will boot normally without using nomodeset. Remove nomodeset\nbefore if you have written it in grub file and update the grub.\n\n*Now to make changes permanent go through this below given link and\nremove all the above kernels but don't remove the running kernels.\nhttps://itsfoss.com/upgrade-linux-kernel-ubuntu/ This link will guide us through the procedure to update or downgrade the kernel.

If so, why deny capability dac_override and deny capability dac_read_search?\n\nA: From doing a quick search, I think the answer is that Ubuntu does not actually have a guest account, it uses a \"guest session\".  Guest sessions cannot make any real changes to a system, so if you log on and try to save a file to the sessions home directory, when you log out, those files are removed. \nYou can almost think of a guest session as a live USB/CD session.\nMost of my searches on guest session only give me options to remove it, I did find one that talked about creating a guest user, and that is different from the guest session.\n", "Q: ImportError: cannot import name CompletionFinder I am using Ubuntu \"14.04.1\", with python version 2.7.6\nI have installed python-argcomplete package (version 0.6.9-1) but still getting an error while importing CompletionFinder from argComplete.\nThis is import line in my code:\nfrom argcomplete import CompletionFinder\n\nWhile compiling this file I get this error:\nImportError: cannot import name CompletionFinder\n\nAny suggestion?\n\nA: Version 0.6.9 in the Ubuntu 14.04 repositories doesn't have the CompletionFinder class, it was introduced in version 0.8.0 according to GitHub.\nCompletionFinder is almost identical to the autocomplete function, so you might get away with just using that.\nAnother solution might be to uninstall the package and get the latest version from PyPI with the following command:\nsudo pip install argcomplete\n\n", "Q: cannot login ubuntu desktop after change passwd Yesterday I changed passwd with recovery mode.

I have googled for this information and I am simply lost. I just need a simple, standalone and a single table database with GUI. I tried Libraoffice base, but it keeps giving me an error \"S1000 java.lang.Null\" and destroys all the record in the table. Then, I installed firebird and it doesn't have GUI to work with. I don't mind the terminal but it gets tedious after awhile having to enter commands in the terminal. Plus, when it comes to viewing your records in the terminal window, it won't be easy on your eyes and sometime it can be confusing. I even download a GUI razorsql for firebird but that is not FREE. All I am looking for is a simple database with GUI like liberaoffice base. Nothing fancy.\n\nA: Workbench together with MySQL are my favorite combination. Both are available in the Ubuntu repositories but both can be install through their own repository to get the latest versions. Both are also very well documented.\n\nTo install from the repositories:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\nsudo apt-get install mysql-workbench\n\n\nYes, both are not simple. But it will pay off when you get the hang of Workbench. \nExample images:\n\n\n*\n\n*the localhost connecting is created by installing mysql. All you need to do is provide a password during install.\n\n\n*I created a database \"discworld\" with create database discworld and for creating a table in database \"discworld\":\n\n\n*insert and select table \"wizards\":\n\nIt really is that easy. Most of the problems come from creating the more difficult SQL instructions. Not from mysql or workbench itself.\n\nA: Mysql as database and phpmyadmin as frontend might be a well known combination. \nKeep in mind this need a LAMP stack and is therefore not really standalone using a single app. \nComes with the big advantage of being well documented if it comes to examples,  tutorials  etc. \n\nA: Try use SQLite. One file for database, SQL inside, used in many products, for example Chrome/Chromium, Firefox. On official site you can download simple command line utilites for database. I used it in online game Travian for mapping from command line :) \nIf you use any GUI, all compatible. I'm not sure whether it is possible a better simple database.\nFirst GUI - SQLite Studio, crossplatform.\n\nOther - addon for Mozilla Firefox. Only Firefox needed.\n\n\nA: Libreoffice Base is awful (as in unstable) when used as a stand alone solution (if you save data and queries in the same odb container). That being said the error you are referring to, is often a rsult of illegal null values in your database.\nLibreoffice Base is great if combined with a real database and used as a graphical frontend. I use it with MariaDB and never had any problems. Only problem is that when I switch from my work desktop to the laptop, I need to make an sql dump. But, this is only 5 minutes work and really worth the added stability and future proofness.\nThat said, other alternatives include Kexi (though this was not stable enough when I tried it about 5 years ago) or glom (never tried that one)\n and a variety of sqlite solutions.\n", "Q: How to know if a downloadable file exists on my computer?

I have a fairly new computer that uses UEFI instead of BIOS and the windows 7 installed on it uses a GPT partition table. (I've looked thoroughly, it's GPT and not leftover GPT scraps). Now, I have a free partition where I want to install Ubuntu but it won't detect my partitions that exist there.\nI ran the \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" option and ran this command in the terminal\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nand the result was MBR: protected and GPT: present\nI've tried using fixparts and it didn't detect any problems so I assume it's a complete GPT table. So what would be the solution to make ubuntu installer recognize those partitions and install in it?\nDo I have to repartition the drive with MBR tables?\n\nA: The reason for Ubuntu not displaying GPT partitions was becuase the installer was loading in BIOS mode. To view and edit/create/delete gpt partitions on a UEFI system, ubuntu installer must be loaded in UEFI mode.\nI followed the instructions on Ubuntu's Community Page and selected my USB as the UEFI version and installer displayed the partitions.\nAnyone going through the same thing in the future, my bootloader didn't gave me options for selecting the uefi option in boot order in the Setup page but the direct Boot Menu did showed those options. Boot Menu opens with F12 on my Gigabyte motherboard.\n\nA: No, you don't have to and should not create an mbr related msdos partition table.\nWindows is installed in EFI mode, so you have to install Ubuntu in EFI mode as well.  \nBoot from the Ubuntu installation media and select Try Ubuntu without installing.\nOpen GParted, create an ext4 partition and a swap partition from the free space.  \nStart the installation process - choose Something else.\nSelect the ext4 partition and choose / as mount point.  \nMore comprehensive information you will find here.\n", "Q: Re-install VirtualBox, keep all configuration and machines I had this problem and followed, quite blindly, all steps.

Will these machines be there after this?:\nsudo apt-get purge virtualbox\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nThanks\n\nA: You pre-installed Virtual Box virtual machines and the machine's setting which are stored in your home directory will not be affected by removing or purging the Virtual Box application.\nYou will be able to access them after re-installing Virtual Box just the same as before. I did this several times, not only on every major version release of Virtual Box where we need to remove the previous version to be able to upgrade.\nIn case you had installed the Oracle Extension Pack you will however re-install this too before you can run your VMs. Also it is recommended to also upgrade any Guest Addition we may had installed before.\n\nA: The uninstaller just removes the VB application and the drivers (kexts), it leaves your virtual machines and their settings files alone. As mpack said, it's the same as updating any other program, it updates the software but doesn't touch the documents (your VMs).\n", "Q: Stable Wake-On-LAN PCI-e card for Ubuntu?

I have dual monitors, but I don't really notice it. The computer monitor's aspect ratio is most likely different than the external display's aspect ratio. If so, there's your problem, and the only way to solve it is to get a display that matches the laptop display's aspect ratio, or make the resolution of both displays the same.\nEDIT: Both of my monitors have a 16:9 aspect ratio, so that explains why I don't notice the cursor speed changing.\n", "Q: Clean Install of Ubuntu 14.04 on Dell Latitude e6420.

Do I have to rerun the Deep Search, or can I create the partition after my reboot?\nI'm so excited now ...\n\nA: As the new partition table was created and the copying of data started, the data loss is inevitable. The integrity of your old Data partition depends on how fast you managed to cancel the process. According to the partition sizes of your old and new configuration, the new root partition starts beyond your old Data partition, so you still have a chance.\nYou are right, if you have your old partitions structure and restore it exactly, then you can get your partition back. But I doubt that you stored this info when you were creating your first configuration and this info should be precise.\nTestdisk is a good tool for that job. Here's nice tutorial which explains several cases of data loss: http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/linux-data-recovery.html\nThe author deliberately destroyed his partition table to recover it lately. But complete recovery can be obtained only if it was held immediately after the partition table destruction, without data copying.\nNevertheless, Testdisk has an ability to analyze partition structure on standard and deep levels and try to recover your old partition configuration if it is possible.\nAlso check recovery tutorials on the author's site. Here's step-by-step explanation how TestDisk works: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\nAs regards your last question, all files after their deletion or partition table loss remain at their old positions. You mentioned Photorec, another program of the same author, which has an ability to recover files even if Testdisk failed. It uses a database of signatures of the different file types. It scans the hard drive sector by sector and seeks for these signatures. If it founds one, then it reads contiguous block of the data, checking its consistency. So if the parts of the file weren't overwritten, then it can be restored wholly. Principles of recovery are explained on this page: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec\nFirst of all I advise you to perform all recovery operations from other system. If you have a possibility to take off your laptop HDD and connect it to some desktop machine with adapter - that's the best way. If not, you can boot from Live CD/USB. There are special distributions aimed at data recovery, for example SystemRescueCD. Also if you've got an external HDD you can dump an image of your defective disk using dd and later work with it, so if you'll spoil the recovery, you will still have the original disk with data intact. An example of the command:\ndd if=/dev/sdb of=/media/ext_disk/disk_dump\n\n/dev/sdb in this case is your defective disk and /media/ext_disk - some external HDD which is mounted to your system. Be warned: don't reverse the order of if and of by mistake!\nDefault block size for dd is 512b so you can add bs=64K to the end of the command to speed up the process significantly, but this is advisable only if your original disk is error-free. There's a tool ddrescue which is used when original disk can contain errors.\nNow you can work with your image instead of your disk:\ntestdisk /media/ext_disk/disk_dump\n\nHere's the last link where some other recovery tools are mentioned and briefly explained: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\n\nA: I GOT IT!!!\nI finally recreated a partition with sudo fdisk /dev/sda then n, as explained there\nThe last difficulty I had to face was to convert the CHS format to the Sectors format. It worked with the following formula found there :\nLBA = (((cylinder number * heads per cylinder) + head number) *\n  * sector per head) + sector number - 1\n\nWhich in my case was: \n\n\n*\n\n*Start: (10941*255 + 201) * 63 + 13 - 1 = 175779840\n\n*End: (59572*255 + 98) * 63 + 46 - 1 = 957030399\nThe partition immediately mounted itself and the data was available again! \n", "Q: The home directory content deleted My home folder disappeared all of a sudden (Desktop, Downloads, Documents ... all deleted) and now my system considers my Desktop as the home directory.

If I want to interpret a Python 3 script, I need to rewrite the command to python3.\nI've just installed the numpy package. In order to test the successful installation, I run the command import numpy. It works well when using the python command. However, python3 does not find the package.\nHow is this possible? Do these two commands use different path variables? How can I change the behavior?\n\nA: You're absolutely right, they use different PYTHONPATHs.\nYou can think of Python 2.x and Python 3.x as completely different programming environments. And yes, they store their packages in different locations.\nTo get numpy working, you can type:\nsudo apt-get install python3-numpy\n\nIf you want to find out where exactly a package is kept, you can look at the module objects __path__ attribute:\n>>> import numpy\n>>> numpy.__path__\n['/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/numpy']\n\nYou can also install python3-pip and then run pip3 install whatever to install packages for Python 3 with Pip, for packages that aren't available in Ubuntu as python3-whatever.\nIn case you're confused about the difference between distutils, setuptools, easy_install, pip and the rest, use pip. That's the cool one. :)\n\nA: No, they use the same PATH.

It would be an awesome feature to access recently used documents from LibreOffice with a dynamic quicklist in the launcher. There is quite some experience on how to create custom static quicklists. \nBut is anyone out there who might give some constructive orientation on how to build a dynamic quicklist for recently used docs in lo?\nThe Ubuntu wiki has a very brief description on how to create quicklists with python or vala. I am not experienced in either of the two and I did not find comprehensive example scripts for dynamic quicklists out there. Therefore I'm looking for some easier way to implement it or somebody who has already done/seen it. \n\nA: Adding a dynamic \"recently used\" section to the launcher of an application\nThe full integration of an application with the mentioned dynamic quicklist -entries most likely needs to be done from inside of the application. After all, the most direct information on used files comes from the application itself.\nHowever, since editing the source code is outside the scope of what we're doing, that would not be the road to take.\nThen what?\nThat doesn't mean we cannot achieve pretty much exactly the same result, maybe even in a more flexible and general way, from \"outside\". All the information we need is available in the dynamically updated file: ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel, from which we can retrieve the complete history of opened files, the corresponding date & time information and the application that was used.\nFurthermore, to add a dynamically updated section to a launcher can very well be done as part of the \"traditional\" (static) section. The key of the solution is then to create a process that takes care of the above actions without adding a noticeable burden to your system.\nAs mentioned in the link from the question, some background process would be needed anyway to keep track of the changes and pass the instructions.\nThe script below is pretty much doing exactly that.\nThe solution; a background script\nThe values in the script below are specifically set for LibreOffice and its documents. Without any editing, it can be used to add a recently used -section to the LibreOffice-Writerlauncher. It will show the last 10 used documents, opened by any of the LibreOffice -modules. \nThe solution can however be used to add a \"recently used\" section to many applicatiosn with a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications. Since the file ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel is Gtk related, most likely, applications with a Gtk window will be our potential candidates (that is, if the application opens and edits files). Furthermore, the number of files to show is arbitrary.\nHow it looks\nThe solution adds a section to the targeted launcher in the Unity launcher, showing an arbitrary number of recently used files, e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*show the last seven files:\n\n\n*or the last ten files:\n\n\n*With the same ease however, we can give the gedit launcher a dynamic section, showing the last seven files, opened with gedit (see image further below)\nHow to use\nAssuming you have LibreOffice preinstalled (the downloaded version does not have a referring .desktop file in /usr/share/applications which is needed by the script, but somewhere else, please mention if you need to setup the separately downloaded LO version)\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as dynamic_recent.py\nFor LibreOffice, the process name is soffice, already set correctly in the script.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\nimport shutil\n\n# --- set the number of docs to show in recently used\nn = 7\n# --- set the process name of the targeted application\napplication = \"soffice\"\n#--- ONLY change the value below into \"xdg-open\" if you do not use LO preinstalled\n#    else the value should be the same as in application = (above)\nopen_cmd = \"soffice\"\n# --- set the targeted .desktop file (e.g. \"gedit.desktop\")\ntarget = \"libreoffice-writer.desktop\"\n\n# --- don't change anything below\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.local/share\"\nloc = home+\"/applications/\"+target\nrecdata = home+\"/recently-used.xbel\"\n\ndef runs(app):\n    try:\n        #

If not, set the appropriate launcher.\n\n*Test- run the script by running from a terminal:\npython3 /path/to/dynamic_recent.py\n\n\n*The script copied the global .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications (in this case ~/.local/share/applications/libreoffice-writer.desktop). Drag the local copy to the launcher (else you'd need to log out/in).\n\n*If all works fine, add it to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\npython3 /path/to/dynamic_recent.py\n\nTo use it on other applications\nAs mentioned, you can easily use the script to add a dynamic \"recently used\" section to other application's launcher(s). To do so, see the gedit example setting for the head section of the script:\n# --- set the number of docs to show in recently used\nn = 7\n# --- set the process name of the targeted application\napplication = \"gedit\"\n#--- ONLY change the value below into \"xdg-open\" if you do not use LO preinstalled\n#    else the value should be the same as in application = (above)\nopen_cmd = \"gedit\"\n# --- set the targeted .desktop file (e.g. \"gedit.desktop\")\ntarget = \"gedit.desktop\"\n\n\nHow it works\n\n\n*\n\n*The script periodically looks through the file ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel to find matching files, opened with LibreOffice (processname: soffice)\nIt uses a pretty fast algorithm to do so, \"shooting\" through the file in a single pass, to retrieve the needed lines (two per \"record\"). The result is that the script is very low on juice. \n\n*Once the relevant lines are retrieved from the file, the lines are sorted by date/time, creating a \"top ten\" (or any other number) of most recently used files of the corresponding application.\n\n*ONLY if this list is changed, the .desktop file is updated.\n\n\nI could notice nor measure any additional load to my system, running the script in the background.\nTested on 14.04 / 15.10\nHow to restore the original launcher\nSimply remove the local copy of the launcher in ~/.local/share/applications\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*In case you use Unity Quicklist Editor to edit your launchers (quicklists), you should avoid editing launchers  with a dynamically updated \"last used\" -section from this answer. The edits you make with the QUicklist Editor will instantly be overwritten by the script.\n\n*You can edit your quicklist manually, but make sure you add new item before (on the left side of) divider1 in the Actions= - line\nActions=Window;Document;divider1;aap.sh;Todo;pscript_2.py;currdate;bulkmail_llJacob;verhaal;test doc;\nAll items on the right of divider1 belong to the dynamically updated section.\n\nMajor edit\nSome major improvements were just made:\n\n\n*\n\n*The script now only checks the .xbel file while the targeted application runs (since there won't be changes on the recently used list if the application does not run). The script already was low on juice, but now, only keeping an eye on if the application runs, means even less to your system.\n\n*In 15.04+, it turns out the .xbel file had double mentions of new files; one with, and one without extension. The effect of that is now eliminated.\n\n\n\n", "Q: NTP is not working in ubuntu I installed NTP on my server and client then I changed time in client.

So far everything works; apart from the docking station, but that's another story. (I \nam not sure whether it is relevant, however, a second screen is connected \nto the laptop via hdmi-to-dvi.)\nHowever, it seems like the system does not use its full potential.

However,\nboth under compiz and metacity I got the same problems. I even tried\nto remove all relevant effects using the Compiz config settings manager as well as the Unity tweak tool.

We can create a new one by copying an old one and changing the uuid and MAC address.\nSo, working as root, put the following into, say, copyconnection.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif (( $# < 1 )); then\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Parameter is the profile to copy\nORIG_PROFILE=$1\n\n# Get the MAC address of wlan0\nNEW_MAC=`ethtool -P wlan0 | cut -d \" \" -f 3 | tr [a-f] [A-F]`\n\n# Copy the profile\nSUFFIX=`mktemp -u XXXXXX`\nNEW_PROFILE=\"${ORIG_PROFILE}.${SUFFIX}\"\necho \"Creating $NEW_PROFILE from $ORIG_PROFILE\"\ncp \"$ORIG_PROFILE\" \"$NEW_PROFILE\"\n\n# We will need a new UUID line and a new MAC address line\nNEW_UUID=`uuidgen`\nNEW_UUID_LINE=\"uuid=$NEW_UUID\"\nNEW_MAC_LINE=\"mac-address=$NEW_MAC\"\n\n# Drop the lines in\nsed -i \"s/^uuid=.*$/$NEW_UUID_LINE/\" \"$NEW_PROFILE\"\nsed -i \"s/^mac-address=.*$/$NEW_MAC_LINE/\" \"$NEW_PROFILE\"\n\nMake it executable\nchmod +x copyconnection.sh\n\nThen run it, with your old profile as parameter\n./copyconnection.sh /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/MyHomeWifi\n\nIf you want to do lots of them:\nfind /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ -type f -exec copyconnection.sh {} \\;\n\nFinally, restart Network Manager:\nservice network-manager restart\n\nand you're done.\nFull disclosure:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't test this, because I don't have an external wifi dongle to hand.  I've tested a very similar thing, adding a new profile for my only wifi adapter, and that works.\n\n*The use of mktemp is hacky.  It could, conceivably, go wrong and produce a duplicate file.  It won't, but it could.  Cleaner way would be to set its tmpdir to the location of the original file, but it clutters the script up so much I thought it better to just wing it :-)\n\n", "Q: Bq Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition: desktop mode question I'm so interested in buying the Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition! Ubuntu on desktop rules, I'm using it since 2008 :-) I'm actually a light computer user and I do 99% of my daily tasks in the cloud (using tools like OneDrive.com, Word Online via OneDrive, Transifex.com, etc.) So I'm looking to make this tablet both my tablet and laptop.\nBut I need to know one thing: as I also want to make this my laptop, will the desktop mode on screen (desktop mode on the tablet itself, as demoed at MWC 2016 using bluetooth kb/mouse) be available when the tablet goes on sale? 'Cause I really want desktop mode when needed on the tablet itself rather than hooking it up to a big screen.\n\nA: Yes, You will be able to switch to windowed mode, even when not connected to an external display (a switch will be available in the quick access top-menu). And yes, it has been confirmed that this will be available on the Aquaris M10 when it is released.\n\nA: I can confirm that on the M10 (I'm writing using it) there's a switch to enable Desktop mode even without any connected keyboard or mouse.\n\nA: Yes, switching to desktop mode is possible and easy. However, installing Ubuntu Desktop Applications is not not easy. Gimp, Firefox and Libre Office are per-installed. Installing additional applications is more complicated. Firstly you need the application for the ARM CPU platform. Regular applications for Intel or AMD CPUs will not run on the tablet. Therefore I am not aware of any possibility to install Google Chrome - which would allow to watch Netflix. Also installing Thunderbird (standard in Ubuntu for Desktop) is not that easy and on a fingertip.\nDon't get me wrong, I love my Ubuntu Touch on the Aquaris M10 - but I am limited in the things I am doing. I am eager to see more functions becoming available, even so it will take some time. What I am missing most these days is not being able to stream Netflix or Amazon Prime.\n", "Q: calling bash command in python i called bash command in python in subprocess.call, and the return should be a number for example 3, and in the output, it gives the number as output, but it doesn't put it in the variables for example, the variable y here is still =0 \nx is the shell command\ny=subprocess.call(x,shell=True))\nprint \"this is y\",y\n\nthe output is \n3\nthis is y 0\n\nI need to use the return 3 in my script, but i can't use it because y still return value 0, any idea how to put the returned value in a variable\n\nA: Short answer\nThe zero means the command ran successfully (else it would be 1)\nI guess this is what you wanted:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport subprocess\na=[\"wc\", \"-l\", \"file.txt\"]\ny = subprocess.check_output(a).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\nprint(y)\n\nWith output:\n35 file.txt\n\n", "Q: Allocate space from NTFS to ext4 with GParted I installed Ubuntu on a 20 GB space and now I want more space since my disk is almost full. I downloaded GParted to increase my Ubuntu disk size by decreasing Windows disk. I resized my NTFS disk from 884 GB to 787. With 97 GB, I created a new partition of file system ext4. My partitions are as follows:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8oOGMWv.png\nNow I want to increase the size of my Ubuntu by those 97 GBs but couldn't find a way to do it. How can I achieve this? Thanks.\n\nA: While the partition you want to change (i.e. your Ubuntu partition) is in use (mounted), you can't make many changes to it, especially if those changes involve moving the partition. Of course, with data partitions, you can unmount them and edit them how you wish, but you can't do that with the partition that is currently booted.\nThe procedure to resizing your Ubuntu partition requires that you have some sort of Linux LiveCD/USB handy. If you have another Linux OS on the drive, don't use that. It can cause problems. If you still have your Ubuntu installer lying around somewhere, just skip these steps and continue on with the rest. If you don't have your installer, follow these instructions to create a new one.\n\nUSB Method:\nYou will need a blank USB flash drive that is at least 4GB.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run sudo apt-get install unetbootin.\n\n*Once that is done, close the terminal and search for and open the application, Unetbootin.\n\n*Inside Unetbootin, select the first option.\n\n*In the Select Distribution dropdown, select Ubuntu, and choose 15.10 for the version.\n\n*Toward the bottom of the window, you will see options for the desired target of the Ubuntu installer. If you only have one flash drive plugged in, Unetbootin will have selected it automatically.\n\n*Click the Confirm button near the bottom right of the window to 'burn' Ubuntu to the USB drive.\n\n\n\nNow that you have an installer disc or USB stick, reboot and boot into it. Choose the Try Ubuntu without installing. option when prompted. Once you are in the Live Environment, you can start the procedure to moving your partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for and open Gparted and let it scan your drives.\n\n*Once you see your partitions, and can interact with them, right click that new ext4 partition your created.\n\n*Select the Delete option to delete it. Please make sure you aren't actually deleting your Ubuntu installation. Delete the 97GB partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you should have about 97GB unallocated space in that area again.\n\n\n*Now, right click the Ubuntu partition and make sure it is unmounted by clicking the Unmount option if it exists. If not continue on.\n\n*In the right-click menu of the Ubuntu partition, select the Resize/Move option.\n\n*In the window that pops up, drag the partition shown at the top of that little window as far left as it can go.\n\n*Now, drag the right of the partition as far right as it can go, filling up all the space in that little diagram.\n\n\n*\n\n*If there is a little extra space, don't worry about it.\n\n\n*Click OK to exit the window and then click the checkmark button near the top of the window to apply your changes.\n\n*Let that run and when it's finished, close Gparted and reboot.\n\n\n\nThere is a chance Ubuntu won't boot after this. If that happens, use the boot-repair ISO from community.ubuntu.com. You'll have to burn it with another computer or from the Live Environment, using Unetbootin.\n\nIf you have any questions, comment. Sorry for the rushed ending. I have to leave for a while.\n\nA: You can't move this space until you remove the active partitions, those where your system runs. Sectors can't be moved to a space after the running partition scheme. I had this problem, and the only way to repair it was a clean install on a new partition scheme without deleting my Win partition. Not a Linux problem, is just physics on data stored on hard drives.\nPlease, anyone correct me if I'm giving a wrong approach on that.\n", "Q: Partitions of Default Install When the installer automatically sets up partitions during a clean install, what is the outcome?\nThe question is intended to be general, unless of course other factors play a role in allocating space which would make everyone's setup a bit different.\n\n\n*\n\n*HP Pavilion dv7\n\n*InsydeH2O BIOS Setup Utility (v)F.26\n\n*No option for EFI Boot\n\n*Ubuntu 15.10\n\n\nA: On a recent installation of Ubuntu 15.10 in a VM, this was my layout after I let it use the entire disk, without LVM:\n$ lsblk\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nvda    253:0    0   15G  0 disk \n├─vda1 253:1    0   14G  0 part /\n├─vda2 253:2    0    1K  0 part \n└─vda5 253:5    0 1021M  0 part [SWAP]\n\nOne huge* ext4 partition, with a swap partition to accompany it.\n\n* for appropriate values of huge\n", "Q: Swap space on new install Ubuntu 14.04 I am completely new to Linux but totally tired of Microsoft.

Ubuntu -must- be used on a filesystem that uses permissions (officially called POSIX-compliant). \"ext4\" is such a filesystem, The Microsoft filesytems are not.\nIt could be that you installed using \"wubi\".

I just installed the latest version of Ubuntu Server in VMWare. My ultimate goal is to run a service which will use websockets to communicate with an Android app.\nI installed Apache (which I don't even know if I need), and my IP is 192.168.137.130. However I can only see the site from my local computer. Other computers can't open that IP.\nHow can I make that computer visible on the internet?\n\nA: I can't find very much documentation on your router (ZTE ZXHN H168N), but from what I can see, it should have the necessary features to make your computer visible from the web.\nThe main feature you need is port forwarding, which allows you to open up certain ports used on local IPs to connections from the internet. For instance, the default HTTP port is 80. This is what you want to use if you plan on having some sort of web interface.\nTo set up port forwarding, go to your router's web config interface (most likely 192.168.137.1). Log into it and find the page where you can set up port forwarding. Like I said before, I can't find very much about that router, so I'm not exactly sure where this is, but it shouldn't be too difficult to find.\nOnce you are on the port forwarding configuration page, you can now set up the port forward. In the IP Address field, put the IP of the computer you plan to use as the server. For the port, use whatever port you want. I will use 80 as an example. If you so need, you can also set up other ports to point to the same IP address. This will probably come in handy for your ultimate goal.\nNow that you have your router set to forward incoming connections on port 80 to your server, you will need to find your external IP address. To do this, Google \"what's my IP\" and it should be the first thing to show up. Now, test that port forwarding works by entering this IP address into the address bar of your browser. Since you have Apache installed, you should see a test page. If not, verify Apache is running and that you set the port forward up correctly.\nSince most external IP addresses are dynamic, meaning they change every so often, I recommend setting up a service that will give you a sub-domain that will always point to your public IP, even when it changes. The service I use is called No-IP. It requires the installation of a program on some computer on your local network (preferably one that is always on), which it uses to find your current IP address at all times.

Currently if I hold ALT + TAB and then while still holding down ALT I press TAB I am able to go between applications in a little view and then when I release all the keys that application and all its windows come to the front. \nAnd this is very useful, but I would like to know if there is a way of switching between individual windows with this keyboard shortcut in the same way rather than grouping windows with an application to switch to?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: You can use Alt+` (the key above Tab) to cycle between windows of the same application. \nYou can even mix Alt+Tab to cycle between application and  Alt+` to cycle between windows of the selected application.\nThere is an exposition of the rationale in  this blog post from Canonical's Didier Roche. It's part of a series discussing the development of gnome integration in Ubuntu 17.10.\n\nA: This behavior may also be achieved without a GNOME extension. I have found a similar question at Super User that points out how to set the proper GNOME key bindings.\nTo do it using gsettings:\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-windows \"['<Alt>Tab']\"\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-windows-backward \"['<Shift><Alt>Tab']\"\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-applications \"['<Super>Tab']\"\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-applications-backward \"['<Shift><Super>Tab']\"\n\nUsing the code above when you press ALT+TAB you'll switch between windows, while pressing SUPER+TAB will get you to switch applications.\n\ndconf-editor allows the same with a graphical interface.\n\nA: Alternatetab is just the Extension you were looking for!\nFollow the Managing Extensions instructions here in order to activate it (you should read the text before that section too though). As it is a pre-installed Extensions you will only need to activate it (unless you have removed it, in which case you will need to follow the Installing a new Extension section).\nSo now upon pressing ALT + TAB and then pressing TAB without letting go of ALT (until you have selected the window you want to switch to - then simply release both keys and it will put that window on top) you should be able to switch between individual windows as opposed to applications!\n\n\nA: As someone still quite new to Ubuntu, I found the other answers confusing. After a bit of digging I found a simpler solution, as I also want Alt + Tab to toggle through all the open windows, not just through the open applications.\nIn Ubuntu 18.04, you just need to go the Keyboard settings as shown here\n \nThen set Switch windows to Alt + Tab. It will automatically disable Switch applications which is assigned that key combination by default.\nNo extra software required.\n\nA: You may use alt+esc combination.\nIt's not as aesthetically pleasing as alt+tab, it doesn't show the overlay with application icons/windows. But it does the job, it just switches to the next window and so on.\n\nA: alt tab - down-arrow is the way for me.\nFor example, if I have multiple terminal windows, after pressing alttab if I then press arrow down I get the various windows to pick from with <- and -> arrow keys.\n\n\n", "Q: Should I install these packages for python3?

I'm not sure where /etc/hosts is.\n\nA: You can easily edit /etc/hosts by typing sudo gedit /etc/hosts in the terminal.\nWhat you are doing here is exactly what people commented on your question: there is a etc folder at the root of your filesystem and there is a hosts files inside the etc folder. There is no extension to this file, it is a plain text file called hosts. \nYou edit it and the system knows where to go when looking for a given nameserver. So if you wanna block google you add\n127.0.0.1    google.com\n\nOn your hosts file.\nOn a sidenote, 127.0.0.1 is an special address every IPv4 computer uses to refer to itself, which explains \"localhost\".

This SDK documentation says I need to install the AMD Catalyst (or fglrx driver) at first, which I did successfully after a lot of troubles. I used the archive from the AMD site, named as radeon-crimson-15.12-15.302-151217a-297685e.zip.\nNevertheless the fglrx driver doesn't see the GPU cores.

This may not be ideal for many reasons, especially if you use this script more generally, since the sleep is not directly linked to libvirt being up.\nIt might be better to have the script check if libvirt is indeed started.

You are using the intel graphics, the NVIDIA card is not in use. Currently installed are intel and nouveau drivers, what you describe is normal and NOT a bug.  \nThe reason is that you are having hybrid graphics, the integrated intel graphics and the dedicated NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 960M graphics.

Is this even feasible? I have extensive knowledge with Windows, and even server related functions; however despite a year of use with Linux 3 years ago, I'm struggling to find a solution.\nI'm using a 120 GB Samsung 3D VNAND SSD for booting Ubuntu and updates to the OS and a secondary 2TB Western Digital Black Drive (that i'm hoping to get ubuntu to install programs onto)\nSince I was confused on the formatting I simply partitioned the 120 GB SSD to load Ubuntu and left the data cable to the 2TB unplugged from the motherboard\nAfter loading in and playing with the partitioning tool I realized that the HDD was appearing in a separate window\nThere was no tie whatsoever with the original SSD where Ubuntu is located\nWhile I can format the 2TB and 120GB Drives I'm unable to determine how to make them work the way I want them to.\n\nA: I would advice against it and keep the OS on 1 drive. And on the SSD to have the fast boot.\nIf you want to use a 2nd drive you need to mount the directories onto partitions on that disk. \nSoftware is installed into a lot of directories since software is placed into directories intended for that part of the software. /bin/, /usr/, /lib/, /var/ and more directories will contain parts of an installation. And you will need partitions for each of them where you need to make sure you create plenty of room so the partition can not fill up. Each directory will have overhead decreasing the space you can use for your own files. See this answer on U&L where it is explained how you so this with symlinks or binding (that is a bit high level though).\nIn the end you will see you probably are going to copy -everything- over to that 2nd disk. \nI myself would put the / on the SSD and if you want a separate /home/. And use the 2Tb as a data partition.  This is what I have:\n$ df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda2        46G  5,9G   38G  14% /\n/dev/sda1        47M  3,5M   43M   8% /boot/efi\n/dev/sda5        34G  540M   32G   2% /home\n/dev/sdb1       917G   69G  802G   8% /discworld\n\n(I remove the tmp's). \nMy /home/ is empty.

When that is possible your idea will be possible. You put all the read only stuff on the SSD and the system will remount it writable to do updates and then mount it as read-only for using it. \n\nA: Rinzwind has explained the basics, but I want to make a few more points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most Ubuntu installations consume no more than about 15 GB for the OS plus all the programs you might install, but some can be more than that. The system on which I'm typing this uses 28 GB for the OS plus its programs. On a typical desktop or laptop, user data goes in /home. Servers might store lots of data in /srv or /var. Other locations may see heavy use on some systems, but details depend on the purpose of the computer and how it's administered.\n\n*It's possible to split off /usr (where most program files reside), /home, /var, /srv, /tmp, and many other directories into their own partitions. This can be done to segregate data for safety, to take advantage of unique filesystem features, or for other reasons. A few directories, such as /etc, cannot be split off into their own partitions in this way.\n\n*I disagree with Rinzwind's use of a non-standard location (/discworld in his case) to hold most user data, at least in most cases. That's re-inventing the wheel, and results in greater complexity. There can be exceptions, such as if you're in a dual-boot configuration and you need to share your personal files across both OSes. This could be a very long debate, though.\n\n\nOverall, it's not clear why you want to set things up as you suggest, Arosrheoc. If you care to state the reasons for your suggested layout, we might be able to offer better specific advice. Overall, it sounds like you're trying to apply a common Windows habit (namely, segregating the OS from its applications) to Linux. Linux has a very different model of how programs are installed, so that Windows habit just doesn't work in Linux. Understanding the practical goal (optimizing speed, having space for specific big programs, enabling easy OS re-installation, etc.) may enable us to suggest an alternative that will work as well or better.\n", "Q: After a power failure, unable to mount the drive \"Get a newer version of e2fsck\" I have a desktop computer with Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.4 LTS 64-bit with an attached HDD USB 3.0 4TB Intenso 1 partition ext4 data drive only (no OS or Apps).\nAfter a sudden power failure, I am unable to mount the drive (checked different host Linux machines with no result).\nerror message:\nsudo mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdd1,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail  or so\n\nTried with fsck, e2fsck with no result.

I'm looking at building a computer that can virtualize two or more gaming machines at once. I'm hoping to be able to play two (or more) games at the same time, and I'm hoping to be able to display them both on the same monitor at the same time.\nThe intuitive way of making this work would be to use the \"window\" you normally get when running a basic Virtual Machine, but you don't seem to get this when using GPU passthrough. Are there any VM suites that can use GPU passthrough and still display the GPU's output on the \"host machine's\" monitor?\n\nA: 2021 Edit: try Looking Glass, it's been around for a few years now and people are having great, low latency results (i.e., usable for gaming).\nOriginal 2016 response:\nI don't think this is currently possible. The most sensible I've seen is plugging both GPU cards into the same monitor, and using that monitor's input switching features when you want to flip between your host and your guest.\n\nA: Here's a possible solution, but you'll need an HDMI Dummy Plug.

I'm dual-booting Windows 10 (the original OS) and Kubuntu 14.04.\nMy Kubuntu installation doesn't recognize wireless (the QCA6164 Driver issue) so I tried using ndiswrapper to solve the issue. This I didn't expect that while in my Kubuntu boot I also have access to the windows side through Dolphin.\nSince I needed to have the Windows drivers to install with ndiswrapper and could not find an available zip to download, I went into the Windows side and copied the files from there to no avail.\nThe thing is that while on the Windows OS I ran a diagnostic test and it returned an invalid PCI/PCI-e on the test. I used Systemback to restore my Kubuntu after the failed driver solution attempt.\nMy question is if I made changes to one OS could it directly affect the other?\n\nA: In short NO just adding drivers to Ubuntu will not affect Windows, they are on different partitions and do not interact, however if you mount you Windows partition in Ubuntu (or Ubuntu in Windows via a third party app) and modify any system files, this could potentially break Windows.\n\nA: If either partition is mounted (I doubt W10 can mount Ext4) then yes they can touch each other. If Windows does a nasty thing and pokes at/reads off your Ubuntu partition, it just did.\nWindows can parse partition maps but not Ext4 - like one might be able to copy German but not read it.\nLinux can read Ext4 but the odds of it mounting your Windows partition without you telling it to or adding it to fstab is very unlikely.\n", "Q: Send programs from ubuntu partition to mint partition To begin sorry for my bad English (I speak french).\nI had some problems from my Ubuntu system and for this I'm going to install Ubuntu mint on another partition to keep safe my data...\nAnd I want to transfer some of my program from Ubuntu to mint, because I can't have internet all time (~500Gb of games and programs).\nIs this possible?\nI know with some terminal commands its possible du \"update\" installed programs list, but to transfer i don't know how to do.\nI had try to copy the /use folder but the boot failed etch time when I used Debian\nThanks before :)\n\nA: *\n\n*Do you have a separate /home partition under Ubuntu installation?\n\n*If yes, then install Linux Mint normally and direct it to use the /home as new /home (Don't format the partition)\n\n*If no, you can install Mint normally and mount the Ubuntu partition in your Mint file manager and use as is, no need to transfer data. You can copy-paste anything anywhere as per your requirement\n\n*For program transfers, your packages are stored in /var/cache/apt/archives/ (unless you cleaned it with apt-get clean), copy those .deb files to the Desktop of your Mint installation (use sudo for permission), then in Mint use 'sudo dpkg -i /home/Desktop *.deb'\n\n*For more info: https://superuser.com/questions/378686/when-you-do-apt-get-install-where-are-the-deb-files-stored\nHope it helps, thanks\n", "Q: How soon will Ubuntu update the firefox web browser?

Here's one:\nHow to hear my voice in speakers with a mic?\nThere is also a program called Rakarrack which apparently does guitar effects.\n\nA: As you say your preamp is USB, here is how I use my USB preamp in Ubuntu.\nFirst you need jack to control the interface\nsudo apt-get install qjackctl jackd\n\nand  Rakarrack as the amp simulator\nsudo apt-get install  rakarrack\n\nFor setup run qjackctl from dash and set it up with your usb device in the interface section and your speakers as the output, then tweak the other settings to your liking, here are my settings\n\nYou may also need to click connect in qjackctl and connect the input to the output, this can be done in just a click or two.\nNow restart qjackctl and run Rakarrack (qjackctl MUST run first), if you set your interfaces correctly that should be all you need, you will here your guitar from the speakers and can use Rakarrack to set up some nice tones ;)\n\nA: To properly use any audio interface with Linux, you first of all need a working ALSA driver. You may already be out of luck with the iRig there. If you have\nsudo apt-get install alsa-firmware-loaders\n\nAnd you connect the interface but it doesn't show up in Pulseaudio (or aplay -l), then I'm afraid it's likely going to be very hard to get it to work on Ubuntu at all. You may consider getting some other interface with reliable ALSA drivers.\nIf the interface does show up, then you should next get jack to do the patching.\nsudo apt-get install qjackctl\n\nFinally, you'll want some way to process the signal. For sure, this can be done with the big commercial programs like Guitar Rig, Amplitude, or (better) BiasFX, iZotope Trash... but I'd think twice before Wine-infiltrating a Linux install with such closed-source behemoths.\nBefore you do so, I'd recommend you check out Pure Data. It's completely different from those programs – not at all specialised at simulating existing guitar amps/pedals; instead it gives you really nice ways to design completely new sound effects, completely from scratch. (But, this is definitely nothing for quickly getting some impressive standard sould; perhaps Rakarrack will serve you if that's what you want.)\n", "Q: How to recover/reset forgotten Cryptkeeper password? I am using Cryptkeeper in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to encrypt my important files. Unfortunately I have forgotten my Cryptkeeper password. It is very important for me to recover all those files. I have frustrated searching on google. Would you please someone help me :(\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: Why did you use cryptkeeper?\nTo protect your data from other people's eyes. \nIt would not have been protected if anybody could simply crack the encryption. And how should the application distinguish between an evil attacker and you?\nBecause you should know the encryption password. When you forget it, that's your problem. The application will be as graceful to you as to any evil attacker and that's good this way, because otherwise it woud be useless. \nIn my view, you have three options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Forget about the data. It's gone. Poof! \n\n*Buy a supercomputer for millions of dollars and spend days/weeks/months/years (depending on the strength of your old password) with letting it try to brute-force decrypt your data.

So, I created a bootable Usb drive with pendrivelinux, wiped out my Windows and installed Ubuntu 14.04 from Usb. The installation process worked like a charm and at first everything looked ok, until I attempted to connect to net. The connection seems to be established, AFAIK. If I set one terminal to ping Google (or some other address) it will respond as long as I don't make any http requests. When I make a http requests (browser, wget, etc) the network manager seems to go haywire and further ping will fail with a message \"Destination host unreachable\". When I restart network manager service, http works for a few kilos or seconds. I already tested Ubuntu 15 and Linux mint, but they suffer from the same problem.\nThe thing is that I have no clue how to even start to fix this issue. I googled around and noticed that there was (is?) a pesky problem with libnl. Someone suggested that in this case one should try to downgrade it, but this didn't fix the problem.\nI tried to change MTU values for the connection from auto to hardcoded values, as suggested, but this prevented me to connect at all. Also, the suggested solution addressed an issue between wireless and wired connection.\nI don't want to revert back to Windows!\n\nA: I couldn't find a reason for this behaviour or the root cause for it.

Is it possible to add my own? Any (HP specific?) system drivers that enable this?\nThe only way I've seen the LED change colors is when activating both Wifi and Bluetooth, but that only worked on a specific set of drivers and/or under specific ACPI setting (can't remember which, but it caused some of the key features not to work, so I gave up on using Bluetooth at all).\nNot sure if it has to do something with the generic drivers I'm using: \nGENERAL.PRODUCT:  RT3290 Wireless 802.11n 1T/1R PCIe (Ralink RT3290LE 802.11bgn 1x1 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 Combo Adapter)\nGENERAL.DRIVER:   rt2800pci\n\n\nA: These commands worked for my HP Pavilion g7 2269wm running elementary OS freya (based on Ubuntu 14.04).\nMake LED orange\necho 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/hp::hddprotect/brightness\n\nMake LED white (default)\necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/hp::hddprotect/brightness\n\nAfter running the first command your LED should turn orange even when there is no disk activity and becomes a mix of white and orange with disk activity.\nThe second command will make it white again and turn off when no disk activty like default.\n\nThis file is used by the lis3lv02d kernel driver to change the color when the\n  laptop is dropped while also parking the hard drive.\n\n", "Q: how to configure a desired Kernel version on Grub?

This one:\n\nThe files are in /usr/share/unity-greeter/ that I know, but can I change the Icon for a WM if it has none?\nThanks\n\nA: The package unity-greeter-badges provides icons (or badges, as they're called in this context) for about 30 window managers. unity-greeter-badges is available from the default repositories starting with Ubuntu 15.04. deb packages for Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 can be found in this blog post.\nYou can also add your own badges. To do that, you need to know the X session name of the window manager in question. Say you want to create a badge for 'xfce' sessions. Then you need your badge as a png image sized 22 x 22 pixel. Name that image file after the pattern custom_SESSIONNAME_badge.png, in this example custom_xfce_badge.png. Put the image to /usr/share/unity-greeter, and it should be recognized automatically.\n\nA: In there, there should be a file named \"cof.png\". But you cannot edit the file in the normal way. Here are the steps to do it:\n1. Press Alt + F2 and type:\ngksu nautilus\n\n...then do what it prompts you to do.\n2. Go to the unity-greeter directory\n...and look for cof.png.\n3. Open and edit it! it (done!)\nLet's analyze what we have just done here:\nNautilus is the name of Ubuntu's native file browser. However, that file browser is desogned to protect crucial files that the system uses by only allowing access by root. That's when gksu comes along. When you open gksu along with something, it runs it as root. Being a root user and using a root file browser will enable you to modify essential and crucial parts of your system. That includes the icon you see at login.\n", "Q: 404 Not Found - can't access login page after upgrade to ownCloud 9 I have tried both the package manager upgrade and a manual upgrade to move to the latest ownCloud version (9).

How do I start troubleshooting based on the symptoms of apache saying that a file cannot be found, but exists?\n\nA: There is a tracker for this issue at https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/22970 .\nThe workaround for the moment is editing the file /var/www/owncloud/.htaccess and commenting out the line\nRewriteRule .* index.php [PT,E=PATH_INFO:$1]\n\nlike so\n# RewriteRule .* index.php [PT,E=PATH_INFO:$1]\n\nSave and from the command line do sudo service apache2 restart.\nI would appreciate anyone's time explaining to me what that line is meant to do.\n", "Q: How to upgrade Apache HTTP Server from version 2.4.16 to the latest stable version i.e. 2.4.18 on 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

My current set-up is all devices connect directly to the router.  I am wanting to keep a log of all websites visited, by what device (IP is fine), and datetime visited.  OpenDNS does not work in my situation.  Also, my router does not have website logging etc enabled and I would prefer not to flash ddwrt or tomato or something like that.\nIs there a wiki or a guide out there that explains how to use my Ubuntu machine to record all of this information?\n\nA: You need to setup your ubuntu box as router / proxy / transparent proxy. For best results your box need two network interface cards (nic). In such configuration all systems which should be monitored are behind the nic1 of your box and all traffic flows through your box. Your box monitors the traffic and forwards it through nic2 to the router to the internet.\nIt is a complex szenario which goes beyond the scope this answer and maybe of  this site. You get more detailed information on sites with tutorials to squid transparent proxy configurations. Good search terms are:\nhowto squid transparent proxy https\nSome sites I found are superuser, serverfault, ubuntuserverguide and Robert's.\nI don't reviewed those sides, so I can't state how useful the informations/tutorials are.\n", "Q: How do I set all program data and downloads to a separate drive? I have a 120GB SSD and a 1 TB HDD. I would like to dual boot Ubuntu alongside Windows 10. I installed Ubuntu on a partition of the HDD, but Windows 10 was installed on the SSD so using a boot manager wouldn't work and I'd have to change which drive to boot up in every time I start my computer. Is it possible for me to install Ubuntu on a small partition of my SSD, but only the actual OS itself, with all other data on the HDD? \n\nA: Yes, it is possible, and supported.\nThe general way people split their installation is to put / (the root) on the smaller partition and /home (where most of the data is stored) on a larger partition. However, you can also put just /boot on the SSD and the rest of your OS on the HDD.\nHowever*2, you can install Ubuntu completely on the HDD without worrying about split drives and double bootloaders and all that, which is what I recommend you do. When you install Ubuntu, it will install GRUB to the EFI partition on your primary hard drive, which should be the SSD. GRUB will be able to boot into both Ubuntu and the Windows bootloader, even if they are on separate drives. All you need to do is install Ubuntu, and it should configure everything for you.\nI recommend choosing the Something Else... option in setup when prompted and manually telling Ubuntu to install to the partition you want there. While in this setup, also make sure that the EFI partition is going to mount as /boot/efi.\nIf you need any more details, comment, and I'll help out.\n", "Q: How to move the logo on the login screen?

Every time I shutdown or restart my laptop (Ubuntu 14.04), I would like to run a script that checks, whether I pushed my newest code to my remote git repository. If I forgot it, then it opens a terminal, asks the user to enter a commit message and pushes the changes. I already got the script working. \nNow I am looking for a way to make this script run automatically when I shutdown or reboot, but before the GUI exits.\nMy approach so far is with System V Init (yes, I know it's a bit dated):\nI copy my init script with LSB header to /etc/init.d: \nsudo cp ~/git_checker /etc/init.d/\n, change permissions: \nsudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/git_checker\nand configure execution scenarios:\nsudo update-rc.d /etc/init.d/git_checker defaults\nWhen I test this script with sudo service git_checker start,\n I get the error: \"Failed to parse arguments: Cannot open display:\"\nReading up on it, I found out, that init scripts should not be used to open terminals (like so:\nsu user -c 'x-terminal-emulator -e /home/user/git_check.sh'\n ), because the X server is not guaranteed to be running when init scripts are executed.\nSo init scripts seem to be the wrong way. Is there another way? Maybe with upstart or systemd?\nIn the case of running the script at system startup, I can simply put it in startup applications. Does something similar exist, like shutdown applications?\n\nA: I've created a small monitoring script some time ago that will call an interrupt function once the script detects user's attempt at shutting down the computer. The small modification that it needs for your specific case is to cancel the shutdown action , run the script and then call shutdown.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmain()\n{\n  dbus-monitor --profile \"interface='com.canonical.Unity.Session',type=signal,member=RebootRequested\" | \\\n  while read -r line;\n  do\n#   echo $line\n     grep -q '.*NameAcquired.*' <<< \"$line\"  && continue  #  Ignore that first line\n    if [ -n \"$line\"  ];then\n       interrupt \n    fi\n  done\n}\n\ninterrupt()\n{ \n  # The first command will close the shutdown dialog\n  qdbus com.canonical.Unity /com/canonical/Unity/Session com.canonical.Unity.Session.CancelAction\n  # place call to your script bellow this comment\n  zenity --info --text='Remember to push changes to git repo'\n  # Uncomment line bellow for shutdown\n  # qdbus com.canonical.Unity  /com/canonical/Unity/Session com.canonical.Unity.Session.Shutdown\n\n}\n\nmain\n\nThis script of course must be added as part of startup applications or you can create manually .desktop file for it\nNOTE: This script  works only with GUI, so if user issues a command sudo shutdown -P now , it won't work. You would need to also monitor for shutdown command through another script using pgrep shutdown or integrate another funciton into the scrip.\nFor example, in my script up above , youd want to add this function\nmanual_shutdown_monitor()\n{\n  while true \n  do\n  if pgrep shutdown > /dev/null\n  then\n      zenity --info --text=\"GOT MANUAL\"\n  fi\n  sleep 0.25\n  done\n}\n\nAnd then call that function in main() like this\nmanual_shutdown_monitor &\n\n", "Q: How to copy all current output in Terminal to a file when too large for clipboard after it has already been outputted? I have a slight problem at the moment, I have a large amount of output in a Terminal (gnome-terminal) at the moment, so large in fact that the clipboard won't take it... So I wondering if there is any way for me to get a script to run through all the current output there or something and then put it into a file, line by line if it has to? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\nClarification: As this seems to be confusing a few, I do not want to be told how to pipe the output or similar to a file before it's outputted it into Terminal, I currently have over 100k lines in my Terminal and I wish to move them into a file but the clipboard won't take them and rerunning the command which outputted them and then piping into a file isn't really an option at the moment...\n\nA: Pasting large data into terminals is often troublesome (I don't quite know why), so I recommend to perform Edit -> Select All, followed by Edit -> Copy in gnome-terminal, and then Paste into some non-terminal application such as gedit.\nI tried with 600k lines. It took a couple of seconds to Select All and Copy in gnome-terminal, followed by a minute or so to Paste it into gedit, but luckily it worked flawlessly (on Ubuntu 16.04 beta; 15.10 is unlikely to behave differently).\nBut if nothing gets copied to the clipboard then you just need to copy in smaller chunks as the limit will have been reached.\n", "Q: After an update, locking and logging in puts me back at login screen Sometimes, after running an update, if I lock my screen and then try to log in again from the lightdm greeter, it goes black, sits for a while, then puts me back at the login screen.\nUbuntu gets stuck in a login loop talks about ~/.Xauthority or /tmp permissions, but those seem OK.\n/var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log shows things like this:\n[+330172.81s] DEBUG: Seat seat0: Session authenticated, running command\n[+330172.81s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: Running command /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-greeter-session /usr/sbin/unity-greeter\n[+330172.81s] DEBUG: Creating shared data directory /var/lib/lightdm-data/lightdm\n[+330172.81s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: Logging to /var/log/lightdm/x-3-greeter.log\n[+330197.83s] DEBUG: Activating VT 10\n[+330197.92s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: Greeter connected version=1.16.7 resettable=false\n[+330222.99s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: Greeter start authentication for unhammer\n[+330222.99s] DEBUG: Session pid=21031: Started with service 'lightdm', username 'unhammer'\n[+330222.99s] DEBUG: Session pid=21031: Got 1 message(s) from PAM\n[+330222.99s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: Prompt greeter with 1 message(s)\n\n\n\n[+330258.19s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: Continue authentication\n[+330258.22s] DEBUG: Session pid=21031: Authentication complete with return value 0: Success\n[+330258.22s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: Authenticate result for user unhammer: Success\n[+330258.23s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: User unhammer authorized\n[+330258.23s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: Greeter requests session xubuntu\n[+330258.23s] DEBUG: Seat seat0: Returning to existing user session unhammer\n[+330258.23s] DEBUG: Unlocking login1 session c44\n\n[+330283.23s] WARNING: Error unlocking login1 session: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.TimedOut: Failed to activate service 'org.freedesktop.login1': timed out\n[+330283.23s] DEBUG: Activating VT 9\n[+330283.36s] DEBUG: Seat seat0: Stopping greeter\n[+330283.36s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: Sending SIGTERM\n[+330283.36s] DEBUG: Activating login1 session c44\n[+330308.37s] WARNING: Error activating login1 session: Timeout was reached\n[+330308.37s] DEBUG: Session pid=20966: Exited with return value 0\n[+330308.37s] DEBUG: Seat seat0: Session stopped\n[+330308.37s] DEBUG: Seat seat0: Greeter stopped, running session\n[+330308.37s] DEBUG: Registering session with bus path /org/freedesktop/DisplayManager/Session11\n[+330308.37s] CRITICAL: session_real_run: assertion '!session->priv->command_run' failed\n[+330308.37s] DEBUG: Activating VT 10\n[+330308.52s] DEBUG: Locking login1 session c44\n[+330333.52s] WARNING: Error locking login1 session: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.TimedOut: Failed to activate service 'org.freedesktop.login1': timed out\n[+330333.52s] DEBUG: Session pid=21031: Exited with return value 0\n\n\nA: https://serverfault.com/a/742102/104546 gave a solution to a different question that also applied here: after an update, you may have to run sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind (ctrl+alt+f1 first to get to a plain terminal), then you can log in again.\n", "Q: Install Genymotion in a different location When I try installing it using sudo it says:\nInstalling to folder [/opt/genymobile/genymotion]\n\nAnyone knows how can I change the path?\nI also tried opening a terminal as root and changing its path.\n\nA: I've installed Genymotion to play CoC several months ago.

I read online that with the newer Ubuntu systems Gnome programs don't integrate with the configured online accounts, so I'm wondering what's the point of adding them if users have to import and export data manually. I've already tried a lot of solutions I found online regarding this issue, but none of them solved anything (most of the solutions were written for older systems and didn't work for Ubuntu 15.10). So I'm basically wondering if anyone has a solution for syncing Google contacts and calendar with Gnome contacts and California Calendar.\nInfo about my system: Ubuntu 15.10 64-bit.\n\nA: Many GTK+ apps use evolution-data-server as their backend for calendaring and address books. Adding your calendars and address books in Evolution will make they appear as data sources in Maya, GNOME Calendar, California, GNOME Contacts, Dash, GNOME To Do, and a bunch of other programs.\n", "Q: Launcher customization in unity?

I was taking the Steps for Setting up and Running sudo located here http://snag.gy/JAGgt.jpg. But every I type sudo \"whatever\"  as user ($), I get the following message:  \n sudo: unable to stat /etc/sudoers.d/README: Permission denied\n sudo: unable to stat /etc/sudoers.d/ken: Permission denied.\n\nso I leveled up as root and did ls -l | grep sud.

All admin users (including the default user account that gets created during the installation) are already allowed to use sudo to run commands with root privileges.\nRemove the file /etc/sudoers.d/ken again and revert all changes you might have done to /etc/sudoers.d.\nYou can use pkexec as temporary replacement for sudo to fix the issues while that does not work:\npkexec rm /etc/sudoers.d/ken\n\n\nAdmin users on Ubuntu are defined by their group membership in the sudo (formerly admin) group.\nWhen you add new admin users through the Unity Control Center GUI, it will take care of those group memberships automatically.\nWhen you add a new user from the terminal using sudo adduser USERNAME, it will not be a member of any additional group. In this case, you have to add those two groups manually to make the account an administrator that is allowed to use sudo:\nsudo adduser USERNAME sudo\n\n\nAnd in the rare case where you really would have to edit /etc/sudoers or a file in /etc/sudoers.d/, never do that manually but **always use sudo visudo to edit it! This command will verify the files and check for errors before applying the changes and prevent leaving you with a ruined sudo command.\n\nA: First, based on the instructions it's ALL=(ALL) ALL , so there's one mess up. \nSecond , instructions say  If your system does not already have sudo set up and enabled , which you really should have checked before doing the rest.  \nThird, just remove that ken file. Your username is added to sudo group automatically during installation (if that's the username you picked during installation of course, and not created manually).  \nFinally, look at your /etc/sudoers.d permissions:\nroot@ken-:/etc# ls -l | grep sud\n-rw-r-----  1 root root       745 mar 19 12:11 sudoers\ndrwxr-----  2 root root      4096 mar 19 14:53 sudoers.d\n\nA directory requires execute permissions bit set in order to navigate into it. You cannot navigate into the directory because only the owner( root ) has x set for it (Related post on serverfault demonstrates that well enough). So your navigation to /etc/sudoers.d  issue has nothing to do with sudo but with folder permission bits\nBut if you are still unconvinced  heres a demo on a directory, owned by my user, in my home folder.\n$ ls -ld testdir                                               \ndrwxrwxr-x 2 xieerqi xieerqi 4096 Mar 17 16:34 testdir/\n$ chmod -x testdir\n$ cd testdir\n/bin/mksh: cd: /home/xieerqi/testdir: Permission denied\n\n\nA: I resolved issue by elevating as root, then did root@root# chmod 755 /root/etc/sudoers and sudoers.d.

Same behavior when trying to create a new document, or when trying to save the output from a program into any of the subfolders.\nI can, however, create files or directories in the /home/user folder without issue. \nI know there are many things which require elevated permissions in Ubuntu file management, but I can't believe that saving a document to my Documents folder would be one of them! \nIs it normally possible to right-click-create a sub-folder of Documents, Pictures, etc?

It should looks similar to\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 rinzwind rinzwind  4096 mrt  2 19:21 Documents\n\n\nAnd to explain this: the permissions on a directory are a bit different to files.\n\n\n*\n\n*\"r\" or \"read\" permissions means you can list items inside that directory.\n\n*\"w\" or \"write permissions means you can create, rename, write and remove files inside that directory and edit the directory's attributes. \n\n*\"x\" or \"execute\" permissions means you can enter and access files and directories inside the directory. \n\n\nSo \"execute\" is a must to be able to do anything inside the directory. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"s\" or \"sticky\" bit makes it so that only the owner can rename and remove files and directies inside the directory.\n\n", "Q: If I dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu, could a keylogger affect me if i'm on Ubuntu? If I have a keylogger on Windows 10, can it affect me when I boot into Ubuntu on the same computer.\n\nA: As some comments have already stated, it's absolutely possible that a malware can jump between different operating systems on dual boot. There are only two barriers the malware must overcome:\n\n\n*\n\n*It must bring its own ext3/4 driver to handle the file system used by Ubuntu\n\n*It must run with high privileges in order to access the required APIs\n\n\nEverything else is just a question of the attackers intentions and skill. I don't know any case where \"COTS\" class malware did this. But when you look at some \"weapon\" class of malware you'll see modules to persist in BIOS or even the firmware of your hard drive. You will also see that it's highly modular so that every kind of functionality can be added at any time. So if the attacker thinks its necessary, there will be a module for it.\nHowever if you are using full disk encryption (not only /home) it's much harder to jump over.\nOtherwise the attacker could just modify existing binaries or scripts which are executed by default by the system.\n\nA: Windows 10 can only track you when it is booted. As privacy-invading as Microsoft is, they can't legally (I hope), make it so something is injected into Ubuntu to track you there too. Unless Windows is booted, it is completely inactive, tracking features and all.\n\nA: No: when you boot into Ubuntu, programs stored on the Windows 10 partition cannot be run and cannot log what you are doing on Ubuntu.\nWindows also can not store files on an Ubuntu system since it does not recognize ext4 filesystems. \nSo for a virus/keylogger/whatever to infest Ubuntu, it would need to magically move itself to something you can open in Ubuntu. You need to activate that something by making it executable, clicking it in Ubuntu to run it and it would need to have valid instructions for an Ubuntu system to be able to run.\nNot going to happen any time soon.\n\nA possible method (but it is a stretch): from Windows you get infected by  UEFI malware; when Ubuntu is booted it copies some software over to your Ubuntu system and executes itself. (that is assuming something can be copied over from an UEFI partition to another partition). \n\nA: I think it's safe to say, no. If it's a program on the windows OS it would be extremely un-likely it would function on Ubuntu. If it's a hardware key-logger then it would work regardless of any OS running. \nJust make sure there aren't any strange devices plugged into your computer. \n\nA: Depending on if the \"malware\" was coded to look for dual boot configs which many rarely do as it adds many, MANY more lines of code and is an overall headache, but i wouldnt put it past microsoft to do so.... if it can check for dual boot systems it would most likely remain in the bootsector, reason for the bootsector would be to detect the presence of a grub loader, which, id suggest poking around there with EXTREME caution, and it would be worth seeing if you could modify the \"malware\" so that it was unusable, but still showed as though it remained on your system.\n\nA: No.\nIf you install keylogger in windows it doesn't effect on ubuntu.\nBecause ubuntu didn't support exe excution without wine virtual enviorment.\nSo don't worry.\n", "Q: Sierra E7455 mobile broadband modem has someone got a Sierra EM7455 working on Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04?

This disables the radio until the driver sends a \"magic message\" to the modem. This feature is well known from older Sierra modems. ModemManager supports the magic message for modems in QMI mode, but we have so far got away with ignoring it in MBIM mode.  The EM7455 changes that...\nBasically we know a way around the issue but it isn't yet implemented in current libmbim/ModemManager versions. Sorry about that. I'm sure this will be fixed soon, being a show stopper for the Lenovo EM7455.\nSee the discussion here for full details: https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libmbim-devel/2016-April/000703.html\n\nA: Possible solution, based on similar problem on Dell. Was not tested on real hardware:\nTo get the card working, you have to switch the USB commication mode from MBMI to QMI mode! The ModemManager will apply the FCC-Auth command automatically, but this requires a QMI interface!\nYou can switch the mode by using https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/USB_ModeSwitch or the prefered solution, by adding a special udev rule which also loads the required kernel modules. Additionally you have to install the qmi-utils:\napt-get install libqmi-utils.\n\nThis ruleset was modified to match Sierra E7455 modem.\nAdd the following content to a new udev file, e.g. /etc/udev/rules.d/99-sierra.rules.\nAfter adding these rules, you should reboot your system!

The install process from USB seems to run fine, but I then find that I can't boot the system.\nIn the bios only usb and network boot are shown as options - no bootable hard disks. UEFI boot and Emmc discs are new to me, but I guess that it only wants to boot from the mmcblk0boot0 or mmcblk0boot1 areas of the emmc drive. Should I try to install grub onto one of these drives?\nI had read in a couple of places that ubuntu installs and works fine on this laptop, so I'm curious as to why the installation didn't quite work perfectly for me.\nFurther info: I'm using the 64-bit version. I first tried to install in 'classic boot' mode, and then under UEFI but the end-result seems the same.\nI have poked around in the bios a little bit, but there are not really many options and none that look to me like a solution.\nMore info as requested: Ubuntu is installed on the drive under /dev/mmcblk0p1 - I can see this by running ubuntu from usb and looking around. When the machine boots it goes straight to booting from usb again or attempting to boot from the network (cue error message advising me to check cables, presumably because there is no network). The bios offers me no other option than booting from usb or from the network - no hard disks are shown (though they are there and seem to be working. There is also a small /dev/sda disk, which is dos formatted and I understand is a windows rescue device of some sort).\nAny help appreciated.\nMany thanks.\n\nA: Switch to UEFI mode. Disable secure boot. Then reinstall Ubuntu under UEFI mode. It should work then, at least it did for me.\n\nA: I now have a system that boots. The solution I used was to manually partition the EMMC drive and explicitly include an EFI system partition. This has resulted in a system that works, so I am satisfied and disinclined to tinker any further for a while. Nevertheless, questions remain...\nFirstly, I don't know why I had to do this manually. In my previous attempts the installer asked for confirmation that I want to use UEFI boot, but did not create the EFI system partition anywhere I (or UEFI) could see, and also did not report any failure to do so.\nThe EMMC drive is permanently divided into 4 separate 'devices': mmcblk0, which is the largest part of the drive and intended for general use; mmcblk0boot0 and mmcblk0boot1, which I had assumed were intended to be the EFI partitions but I have been unable to find any way of writing to them; and mmcblk0rpmb, which I gather holds the pre-installed digital signatures and I can't seem to access at all. Only the mmcblk0 device is offered for partitioning by the ubuntu installer (the others are also invisible from gparted). All are visible under /dev in the running system. I don't know what's supposed to be done with those 'boot' devices, but it doesn't seem that they are key to getting the system running, as I had feared they might be.\n", "Q: VirtualBox shared folders are owned by root in Lubuntu guest My Setup is as follows -\nHost: Ubuntu Server 14.04\nGuest: Lubuntu Desktop 15.10\nI have shared dirs on host to guest with automount option, and the directories show up in Guest OS's just fine - /media/sf_sharename\nAlso, the user of guest is added to vboxsf group.\nThe problem is that all the shared dir and its contents are owned by root.

In addition, the version of\n  Linux, the kernel, included in Ubuntu contains firmware blobs.\nThe “Ubuntu Software Center” lists proprietary programs and free\n  programs jumbled together. It is hard to tell which ones are free\n  since proprietary programs for download at no charge are labelled\n  “free”.\nSince October 2012, Ubuntu sends personal data about users' searches\n  to a server belonging to Canonical, which sends back ads to buy things\n  from Amazon. This does not, strictly speaking, affect whether Ubuntu\n  is free software, but it is a violation of users' privacy. It also\n  encourages buying from Amazon, a company associated with DRM as well\n  as mistreatment of workers, authors and publishers.\nThis adware is one of the rare occasions in which a free software\n  developer persists in keeping a malicious feature in its version of a\n  free program.\nUbuntu appears to permit commercial redistribution of exact copies\n  with the trademarks; removal of the trademarks is required only for\n  modified versions. That is an acceptable policy for trademarks. The\n  same page, further down, makes a vague and ominous statement about\n  “Ubuntu patents,” without giving enough details to show whether that\n  constitutes aggression or not.\nThat page spreads confusion by using the misleading term “intellectual property rights”, which falsely presumes that trademark law and patent\n  law and several other laws belong in one single conceptual framework.\n  Use of that term is harmful, without exception, so after making a\n  reference to someone else's use of the term, we should always reject\n  it. However, that is not a substantive issue about Ubuntu as a\n  GNU/Linux distribution.\n\nSo ...\n\n\n*\n\n*repositories show non-free and free applications. I am afraid in 16.04 this is still the case and I doubt Canonical is \never going to give in on this. Commercial applications have a place in Ubuntu. The 1st page that shows does not even tell you that there is software we need to pay for when we want to use it. \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Regarding personal data: Canonical still does this though it is now an opt-in instead of opt-out. It still will not make the FSF happy: they consider Amazon to be evil (they support DRM and claim it abuses its employees). Does the deal with Amazon make most of us unhappy? Maybe. Some users did make a switch to another operating system. Will this stay in Ubuntu? Probably. Ubuntu is not making a profit and this will generate a little bit of revenue. Do I personally like the Amazon link? Well no. It is the 1st to disappear from my launcher and all the \"send data to\" options are turned off. Minor nuisance ... big deal for the FSF.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Regarding \"redistribution\". No problems there it seems; the vague comment regarding patents has not stopped someone from creating Mint. Nor any of the other clones (I counted 45 on that wikipage). But have a look at this image: http://futurist.se/gldt/wp-content/uploads/12.10/gldt1210.png (not including it in the post itself). But the spin-offs from Ubuntu is astonishing. \n\n*The last one about copyright. There has been a change in that so the FSF is a bit more happy about it.\n\nConclusion: If Ubuntu ever will become 100% GNU it will not be in the near future. Plus there needs to change a lot in the way everyone looks at using operating systems. MP3/MP4 is not going to go away and if Microsoft keeps supporting those and not switch to OGG we (users) will need the codec to play it. The same goes for the video drivers. nVidia and AMD can support open source but they will also always provide binaries to protect their software. \nNot going to happen. Proprietary blobs are not going away in the near future.\n\nAlso maybe list the ways you can list all blobs on the system to better highlight what is limiting its GNU stamp of approval.\n\nSearch for \"restricted\" in software center and you will get the codecs that are proprietary. Then there is the additional drivers in dash that will show proprietary drivers. \nA kernel with proprietary modules is considered \"tainted\" (see What does the kernel taint value mean? or https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/118116/linux-what-is-a-tainted-kernel )\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/tainted\n\nwill show a number on how tainted your kernel is. And What does the kernel taint value mean? has a list on what the number means (if it shows 75 it means 64, 8, 2 and 1).\n\nA: GNU thinks that all software should be open source.  They therefore object to things like the proprietary video drivers ( nuovo, and the just discontinued amd drivers ), as well as even the firmware that runs in most of the hardware in a modern PC, which is provided by manufacturers as binary blobs that the linux kernel community is willing to ship with the kernel to make the hardware work.  They acknowledge however, that while morally objectionable to them, they have no right to prevent you from using such closed source software in conjunction with their open source software, at least under the GPLv2 ( GPLv3 was created in an attempt to clamp down on this, though as far as I can see they have no legal leg to stand on for this ).\nThis is not really related to the recent controversy surrounding ZFS, which centers around the somewhat hypocritical belief held by some in the linux kernel community ( which is GPLv2 ) that while they do not mind shipping binary blobs that get loaded into other processors on your system, nor you running closed source applications on your system, they think they have the right to prevent you from loading non GPL'd drivers on your system when it suits them.\nMost modern hardware at least requires proprietary firmware blobs to function.  For a complete list, see the linux-libre project, which has removed them all to adhere to the GNU beliefs.  As a result, it doesn't function with a lot of hardware.\nOutside of the kernel, Debian and Ubuntu have many software packages that do not meet GNU's definition of free software.  In Debian, this software can be found in the nonfree repository, and typically contains the string \"dfsg\" in their version number, standing for debian free software guidelines, which the package in question violates. \n", "Q: Python: create variables using loop how can I create a dictionary variables and every variable has an identical number using a loop in python if it is possible?\n for example:\ncounter=0\nfor line in {1..5}:\n     counter +=1\n     line_dict_%counter={}\n     line_dict_%counter[a]=1\n\noutput\nline_dict_1={'a':'1'}\nline_dict_2={'a':'1'}\n.1\n.\n.\n\n\nA: In Python, you can use the exec() function:\n>>> for i in range(1, 6):\n...     exec(\"line_dict_%s = { 'a': 1 }\" % i)\n... \n>>> line_dict_1\n{'a': 1}\n>>> line_dict_2\n{'a': 1}\n>>> line_dict_3\n{'a': 1}\n>>> line_dict_4\n{'a': 1}\n>>> line_dict_5\n{'a': 1}\n\nUsing exec() is not a good idea most of the times, i would rather prefer a dictionary to keep the mappings:\n>>> kv = {}\n>>> for i in range(1, 6):\n...     kv['line_dict_{}'.format(i)] = { 'a': 1 }\n... \n>>> kv\n{'line_dict_4': {'a': 1}, 'line_dict_5': {'a': 1}, 'line_dict_1': {'a': 1}, 'line_dict_3': {'a': 1}, 'line_dict_2': {'a': 1}}\n\n>>> kv['line_dict_1']\n{'a': 1}\n>>> kv['line_dict_2']\n{'a': 1}\n>>> kv['line_dict_3']\n{'a': 1}\n>>> kv['line_dict_4']\n{'a': 1}\n>>> kv['line_dict_5']\n{'a': 1}\n\n", "Q: How to run in low resolution 640x480 I need to reduce the resolution to 640x480 to connect to my tv that can detect only that resolution.Any idea on how to do it so that my laptop screen resolution doesn't get affected?

Please elaborate!\n\nA: export is a shell command. It affects the current running instance of the shell. It does not make changes in any file. The changes are temporary, only in effect until the shell exits. Once you set a new variable in the shell, to make it available to other programs started from it, you export it.

It will be my pleasure if someone can explain why can we use LTS Enablement Stacks or backports package to solve this kind of problem. \n\nA: The Hardware Enablement Stacks and backports use newer kernels to support devices.  LTS Hardware Enablement is usually preferred as kernel updates are automatic, backports need to be recompiled after a kernel update.\nBackports will not break dkms packages like LTS Enablement Stacks can\nIt seems you are already using the LTS Enablement Stack from Trusty as it originally had the 3.13.0- kernels and your wireless would be supported in Wily's 4.2 kernel series as the modinfo ath10k_pci from 4.2.0-34-generic reveals\nalias:          pci:v0000168Cd0000003Esvsdbcsci*\nalias:          pci:v0000168Cd0000003Csvsdbcsci*\nThe first line shows that it supports the 168c:003e device\n", "Q: How do I install GnuPG 2.0?

What do I do now?\n\nWhat I think could work.\nCan this be done using aliases?\nalias python=python2\n\nBut I ain't sure.\n\nA: Good answer here: \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/24405561/how-to-install-2-anacondas-python-2-7-and-3-4-on-mac-os-10-9\nconda create -n python2 python=2.7 anaconda\n\nthen, to switch:\nsource activate python2\n\n\nA: In case anyone is looking to change their python default version back to 2.7 after messing it up(by changing default one to: anaconda or python 3) and ending up with non-functional software, just follow this link: Link with instructions to change default python version.\n\nA: I went through the installation in a VM, and the following happend.\n\n\n*\n\n*The installer asks for an install location. Default is /home/myuser/anaconda3. \n\n*At the end you'll be asked\nPython 3.5.1 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc.\ncreating default environment...\ninstallation finished.\nDo you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda3 install location\nto PATH in your /home/myuser/.bashrc ? [yes|no]\n[no] >>> yes\n\nPrepending PATH=/home/myuser/anaconda3/bin to PATH in /home/myuser/.bashrc\nA backup will be made to: /home/myuser/.bashrc-anaconda3.bak\n\nTo restore the old behavior, go to your home directory and do\nmv .bashrc-anaconda3.bak .bashrc\n\nthen start a new shell.\nAs you suggest, you could alias python=python2, but I find that a bit weird.\nI would \n\n\n*\n\n*Restore the original .bashrc\n\n*Create (if it does not exist) ~/bin\n\n*Link ln -s ~/anaconda3/bin/python3 ~/bin/python3\n\n*[Prepend $HOME/bin to $PATH](Should already be set by default by ~/.profile)\n\n*Relogin.\n\n\nThat way, calling python3 will start the one from Anaconda.\n\nAn important point is, that the original /usr/bin/python is still there, and still points to python2.7. The ramifications of having python->python3 in your path depend on how a specific script is called.\n\nIf the shebang #!/usr/bin/python is used, like it probably is in all executables that ship with Ubuntu, nothing will change. \nOn the other hand, for better portability #!/usr/bin/env python is sometimes used, which will now cause python3.5 to be called.\n\nA: This worked for me but for Miniconda, it should also work for Anaconda but please correct me if I'm wrong.\nFirst get your $PATH variable:\necho $PATH\n\nIt will probably look like this (miniconda path before everything else):\n/home/your_user/miniconda3/bin:$PATH\n\nCopy that path to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file, but with Miniconda at the end instead of the beginning of the path like so:\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/home/your_user/miniconda3/bin\"\n\nThe system will look for programs at the start of the $PATH variable before the miniconda3/bin folder.\nIt should restore the versions for previous programs you had like python.\nStarting in Conda 4.4, they changed the code added to ~/.bashrc. Now, to achieve the same thing, edit ~/.bashrc and comment out the line below like so to prevent the base layer (base environment) from activating in every terminal. No need to touch any other part of the new additions. I am uncertain what significance CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false has, but haven't run into any issues so far.\n   # CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false conda activate base\n\nAnd while you won't see the conda folder in the path anymore, the conda command will still run fine, and your original python, python3, and pipenv commands will as well.\n\nA: Here is my answer, and it may or may not be the actual specific answer to what you have done to your own system.  \nHowever, I am in a similar situation and had the very same concern.  \nI am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Python 2.7.12, and just recently installed Anaconda.\nSo now, when I go to the command line and type python it still goes to my Python2 installation.\nConfirmed by this sequesnce:\n$which python\n/usr/bin/python     <  Catch-all for max compatibility\n$python\nPython 2.7.12 . . etc\n\nSo in my case, anaconda does NOT cause any problem with my default Python2 shebangs.  \nUltimately, that is the question. \nWhen you ask the system which python you can trust that to be correct string to use in the first line of your command-line style Python programs.  \nIn my situation, all my same Python command-line script files continue to execute just fine.  \nI tend to write Python in a 3-compatible mode.  Such as using parentheses around my print statements.  But I am actively resisting a major change to the system that might cause hard-fought Python 2 programs to encounter glitches.  Python 3 sounds great but unnecessary for my needs.  Python 2 is an amazing language.  \nMy computing environment does not allow me to go back and re-engineer past processes that have been tuned to work correctly without taking a mjor time hit since I would have to go back and figure out where I used it in the first place. \n\nBottom line for me:  Upon install anaconda for future use, I have not had any speed bumps nor problems.  \n\nThat is the point where I am in the process...   Just finished re-certifying all the past software.  \n\nNext step is to actually use some of the cool stuff that is promised in the package.\n\nSo, I must suspect that other simply installing anaconda there must be more to your situation. \nFrom my experience it is not a problem at all.\n", "Q: Is there any virtual 7.1 or 5.1 surround sound software for Ubuntu?

If you are capable to administrate the server completely from a console (even when problem occurs while a ssh connection is not possible), then there is no need to keep any GUI.\nIf the machine hast quite much ram, the footprint of Xserver staying in the login screen is very small and the cpu consumption is nearly 0%.

This prevents most attempts at brute force attacks from the web, as these bots tend to only look on default ports.\nYou are also going to need to assign the server a static IP address on the LAN, as it needs to be accessible at all times. You can set this in System Settings --> Network. To prevent IP address conflicts, it's also advisable that you tell your DHCP server (the router in most cases) that this IP address is taken. The method varies by model, but there should be an area somewhere in the router configuration that lets you reserve IP addresses.\nThe reason for the static IP is that you need to set up port forwarding in your router setup. This allows connections from port  to you external IP to be routed to that port on your server.\nIf your public IP address is dynamic, which it probably is, you're going to want to set up some sort of dynamic DNS service. My recommendation for this service is No-IP. It gives you a free sub-domain that always points to your public IP. This setup does require the installation of a program on an always-on machine on your LAN (called the DUC, provided by No-IP).\nOnce you have the SSH server set up how you want, SSH to it by entering\nssh user@remotehostip -p XXX\n\nor by using whatever SSH/SFTP client you prefer.\nIf any of these sections need more detailed instructions, comment and I'll add them in.\nIf anyone else has trouble following, here is a chat room that has further/more detailed steps: http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/37251/discussion-between-homunculus-reticulli-and-zacharee1\n\nA: In addition to Zacharee1's answer, you should install either Fail2ban or DenyHosts (get the .deb from the Precise repos). You should not authenticate with keys if you are travelling. Use a \"secure\" password as well. Maybe set up a dedicated user account with reduced access for the times you don't need to be admin. \nI would not touch the network settings on the Server, the static IP can be assigned from the router. The router ip address should be the \"gateway\" address assigned in DHCP. In the cases where it is not (!) the default address should be written underneath it somewhere. If you have changed this, you should have left the last value alone.  So if you have a class C home network the address will be a.b.c.x where a.b.c matches all your other ip addresses and x is the trailing value from your router sticker. The ISP should have help pages for that in any case.\nWhen you use a non standard port, avoid '22' as the final digits (8122, say). It leaves clues.\nNB. you can access X based applications over SSH without VNC, another topic entirely. \n\nA: Instead of NoIP, I may suggest to write a script and run it repeatedly to save your IP in your cloud of choice (DropBox, MEGA, etc.).\nSomething like:\n#!/bin/sh  \nwget  http://wtfismyip.com/text -O ~/Dropbox/myip6.txt \nwget  https://ipv4.wtfismyip.com/text -O ~/Dropbox/myip4.txt\n\nAnd then run it with watch -n 1800 sh get_ip.sh which runs the script for you every half an hour.\n", "Q: Brightness problems on ubuntu15.10 for UEFI compatible laptop I have recently installed Ubuntu 15.10 alongside Windows 8.1 with UEFI compatibility i had to disable nouveau.modeset now i cant reduce my brightness on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Now that you're booted with nouveau.modeset=0, you need to actually install some working graphics drivers.\nOpen the Additional Drivers app by seearching for it, and let it scan.

The second drive's usage is also consistent and the contents are available in both the container and the host.\nThe differences between the two drives are that /dev/nvme0n1 is a nvme drive which was mounted manually, whereas /dev/sdb is a magnetic drive and was mounted using /etc/fstab.\nWhat could be causing the difference in the behaviour and how to make /dev/nvme0n1 available in the container?\n\nA: The reason is, the host has access to the mounted drive, the container does not. This is because there is nothing mounted at /mnt/SSD in the container. So the host accesses and stores data on the SSD (/dev/nvme0n1) when it goes beyond /mnt/SSD while the container does access a directory on its root disk (/dev/mapper/sifr--vg-root).\nTo have this in the container you need a bind mount and you may let create a directory in the file system of the container. To do so you need to add the create=dir option in the fstab of the container:\n/mnt/SSD      /moint/point/in/the/container    none   bind,create=dir\n\n>\n\n  \n*\n  \n*create=dir (will do a mkdir_p on the path)\n  \n*create=file (will do a mkdir_p on the dirname + a fopen on the path)\n\n", "Q: Get past times new roman font installation Can someone tell me how to get past this image in the terminal.enter image description here\n\nA: Press TAB to highlight the OK button.

You'll want to make sure the URLs are correct.  If you have created two interfaces, the cluster controller most likely would be your external network.

Multiple persistent casper-rw files can be used by adding the persistent-path to grub.cfg right after persistent, ie persistent-path=/foldername/\nIf you reuse a persistent partition for a different version of Ubuntu, without first deleting the data in it, you will end up with a total mess and it will probably not boot. \nJust open the casper-rw partition using \"sudo nautilus\" and delete the data in it and the new version should run persistent fine.\nYou can also make a second persistent partition labeled home-rw it will store the home folder and it is usable from version to version.\nYou can make multiple casper-rw partitions, however Ubuntu always seems to use the one with the lowest number ie sda4 not sda5.\nYou do know that currently, (16.04), syslinux type installs, (Rufus, UNetbootin, SDC, Universal) do not work with persistent partitions.

Should root or the user who makes the backup be the owner of that partition and why? Which group should it belong to?

I am also thankful for further reading recommendations.\nThank you for your time.\n\nA: \nShould root or the user who makes the backup be the owner of that partition and why?\n\nIn general I would use the \"sudo\" user to create backups. Ubuntu does not use \"root\" as a user; only for the internal workings of the system.\nI do not believe this is an issue? Regardless on who owns the partition you need to keep the files and directories as they are. \nOnly advice I can give: use ext for the backup and not a Windows filesystem.\nIf the permissions change on the backup restoring it becomes a nightmare: software might depend on files having a specific user, or settings. \n\nWhich group should it belong to? \n\nNot an issue. If you have a multiuser system and you want more than 1 user to be able to restore you could use a group. But you should then also have 2 admin accounts, since a restore is not a user task. It is an admin task.\nIf you worry about an unstable system do not set up your system to have more than 1 user to be able to restore. Otherwise that 2nd user might restore something the 1st user does not expect potentially removing something unintentionally. \n\nWhy does ubuntu have so many groups by default, why are they necessary?\n\nSecurity. Hardware is owned by \"root\". So for a user to be able to access a printer, a dvd or device plugin system, admin tools etc you need some method for the system to know a user is allowed to use these. \nSo the initial user created when the system is created is added to these groups and the verification of a 2nd admin user is done by providing the \"sudo\" password. And now the system knows it can trust these users. Any other user needs to provide the \"sudo\" password (and maybe a user to switch to) before they can use this hardware.\nIt also makes it easy to remove permissions: do not want a user to use a \"dvd\"? Remove the group, and done. \n\nThis is what I already know. It still doesn't help me to decide which permissions to give to files in order to not make my system vulnerable/unstable. \n\nWhat are you using to need to worry about permissions? Hosting a website? Otherwise I would assume you do not need to worry about permissions. The defaults the system uses (through the command \"umask\") are good enough. Only when you download something that needs executing you need to set that yourself with \"chmod\". \nThis totally depends on what you want to realize but permissions used on your own files do not make your system unstable and only using full permissions on \"others\" makes your system potentially vulnerable. \nRead the link posted in comments. It does explain it all ;)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Core snap writable location I am new to snappy. For learning purposes I'm trying to make an apache2 snap. \nCreated the snap with snapcraft and installed it on Ubuntu core. The problem I am facing is that Apache is trying to write the log files and it is complaining they're read-only. \nAs I understood, ubuntu-core should be read-only file system and the snaps should be writeable. Or should I point the log files in Apache to /writable/tmp ?\nI am using ubunfstu core 16.04 and created snaps in Ubuntu server 16.04.\n\nA: I would propose that you set your logs in $SNAP_DATA for now. Note that we will have soon some unversion DATA path available for your snaps, so that those data aren't copied for each upgrade/rollback.\nThen, you can ship something in your snap like logrotate to handle log rotations and removal at your own convenience.\nHowever, your use-case is quite interesting and not something that was discussed about AFAIK (logs best practices), do you mind raising this on the snappy-devel ML to trigger the discussion?

I'd like to view logfiles with colored output, scrollable and searchable. How do I do that?\nI tried less /var/log/syslog | ccze | grep error, but it is not scrollable.\n\nA: That's because you're doing it the wrong way around. It's less that is scrollable so that needs to be the last command in the pipeline:\ngrep error /var/log/syslog | ccze -A | less -R\n\nThe options used are:\n\n-A, --raw-ansi\nIf one wants to enable raw ANSI color sequences instead of using\n       curses, this option does just that.\n\nThis makes ccze use ANSI color codes instead of curses. While less can deal with ANSI escapes with the -R option (see below), curses are more of a problem. Using the -A option of ccze neatly sidesteps that issue. \n\n-R or --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS\n            Like -r, but only ANSI \"color\" escape sequences are output in \"raw\" form.  Unlike -r, the screen appearance is maintained\n  correctly in most  cases.\n            ANSI \"color\" escape sequences are sequences of the form:\nESC [ ... m\nwhere  the  \"...\" is zero or more color specification characters For the purpose of keeping track of screen appearance, ANSI\n  color escape sequences\n            are assumed to not move the cursor.

I used mkfs.exfat /dev/md0p1 by mistake, and killed my RAID 1 instead of formatting a micro SD card. Very dumb, I know. How can I undo this colossal mistake? I'm reasonably confident that the two hard drives that used to make up the RAID are still intact, since all I have done is run pointless mdadm and testdisk checks since The Incident. It's just that the MD file system has been ruined and/or made inaccessible ever since I told the machine to make it exfat.\nI'm obviously happy to post the results of any checks that anyone needs to see to help with this, but it is a little tricky since I can only run the damaged machine in \"recovery root shell\" mode--I just have to retype any output on the tablet I'm using to post this question.\nEDIT to add a few details:\nUbuntu 14.04 is installed on a separate hard disk. The RAID was mounted as my /home directory.\n\nA: Break the mirror by placing one of the two drives on the shelf and do not do anything to it. (At least you'll be no worse off than you are now)\nTry to access the other drive directly with sudo testdisk to see if you can find the ext partition that you mangled and/or files that remain on the disk.\nIf this fails and the data is critical to you, you can use a professional data recovery service such as Ontrack to recover most of the data from the unmodified (since the incident) disk on the shelf.\nEDIT: Based on your recent comment regarding family photos you might try photorec which is part of the testdisk package. Since the photorec approach is based on the underlying data and ignores the filesystem you may get decent results. You will need a drive with sufficient space to recover the files to.\nMore information is available here and a step by step tutorial can be found on this page as man photorec might seem a bit cryptic.\n\nA: This is what I would do:\n1º Unplug the hard drive you accidentaly formatted and plug it in another computer\n2º Install in that computer the RAID controllers\n3º Use an app like GetBackDataNTFS (windows) to recover your hdd\n", "Q: How can I get around Grub?

But both devices were still connected to it, but unable to access the Internet.\nSo, just to test, I tried to establish an SSH connection from my mobile to the desktop (using the ConnectBot Android app). To my utter astonishment, I got a successful SSH session.\nWhy were the two devices able to connect through SSH?\n\nA: Your router is only a Gateway to another WAN network; the router in itself is just another node on the local network. As your other nodes have the same network settings, they should be able to connect just fine. Since they are indeed connected, you have a valid local area network (LAN).\nHowever, if you try to connect to a WAN, you wont be able to do so.\nHere is the definition of SSH.\n\nSecure Shell, or SSH, is a cryptographic (encrypted) network protocol\n  operating at layer 7 of the OSI Model to allow remote login and other\n  network services to operate securely over an unsecured network\n\nAn internet connection is not required to SSH into your device, unless you are trying to do it through the internet!\n\nA: Your mobile (WiFi) and your desktop (Ethernet) are in the same local network.

In the past these functions would have required separate devices in separate boxes\n\n\n*\n\n*broadband modem - communicates with ADSL or similar long-haul service.\n\n*router - connects internal network(s) to wider world\n\n*ethernet switch or hub - connects locally wired ethernet computers together\n\n*wireless access point (WAP) - connects local wireless devices together\n\n*DHCP server - assigns IP-addresses (etc) to local devices\n\n*DNS server - allows local devices to locate each other and locate Internet servers\n\n*NTP server - provides time to local devices.\n\n*etc (print server, USB NAS, ...)\n\n\nWhen your broadband cable is disconnected, only the broadband modem function is put out of service, the router function then has little to do. The switch and WAP functions (etc) can continue to work, enabling local devices to talk to each other.\nIn short, the local area network (LAN) is autonomous and can mostly function without the wide area network (WAN).\n\nA: Devices have IP address and Hardware address(MAC). Router has a table which has MAC address and IP address mapped . Your mobile has an IP address as well as a MAC address. When mobile app tries to find the computer Router's datalink layer makes use of a protocol called ARP(address resolution protocol) to find MAC address of Computer and sends a broadcast in a subnet.when your PC's NIC gets the request it replies to request and sends its IP of your computer from the filter table.Router saves the information in its records and maps MAC to IP.Since PC and Mobile are in same network there is no need to go out of the network (public network such as internet).Everytime router will rout the data packets to the right place when mobile tries to connect the to it.Even if the IP address changes it will again make use of ARP.\n", "Q: Using checklist in Bash file I want to create a bash script that do the following:\nCreate a project folder based on Project -- Name this is OK.\nCreate some folders based on user choices --This is the main question\nHere is my code     \n#!/bin/bash       \nif [ ! -d /home/latreche/wienlaid ]; then\n    mkdir -p /home/latreche/wienlaid;\nfi;\n\ncd /home/latreche/wienlaid\necho -n \"Project Name:\"\nread pn\ndir2=`eval echo $dir1`\nmkdir $pn\nmkdir $pn/optimization\nmkdir $pn/optimization/$pn\nmkdir $pn/scf\nmkdir $pn/scf/$pn\n\nHere is the user input section\necho \"Do you wish to calculate elastic properties?\"\nselect yn in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    case $yn in\n    Yes ) mkdir $pn/elastic;mkdir $pn/elastic/$pn ;break;;\n    No ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\necho \"Do you wish to calculate band properties?\"\nselect yn in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    case $yn in\n    Yes ) mkdir $pn/band;mkdir $pn/band/$pn ;break;;\n    No ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\necho \"Do you wish to calculate DOS properties?\"\nselect yn in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    case $yn in\n    Yes ) mkdir $pn/dos;mkdir $pn/dos/$pn ;break;;\n    No ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\necho \"Do you wish to calculate Electronic Desnity properties?\"\nselect yn in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    case $yn in\n    Yes ) mkdir $pn/eldensity;mkdir $pn/eldensity/$pn ;break;;\n    No ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\necho \"Do you wish to calculate Optical properties?\"\nselect yn in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    case $yn in\n    Yes ) mkdir $pn/optic;mkdir $pn/optic/$pn ;break;;\n    No ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\necho \"Do you wish to use Hubbard DFT+U correction?\"\nselect yn in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    case $yn in\n    Yes ) mkdir $pn/$pn+\"U\";mkdir $pn/$pn+\"U\"/$pn ;break;;\n    No ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\necho \"Do you wish to use mBj correction?\"\nselect yn in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    case $yn in\n    Yes ) mkdir $pn/mbj;mkdir $pn/mbj/$pn ;break;;\n    No ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\necho \"Do you wish to Antiferromagnetic calculation?\"\nselect yn in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    case $yn in\n    Yes ) mkdir $pn/antiferro;mkdir $pn/antiferro/$pn ;break;;\n    No ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\nThis is working OK but there is a lot of repetition and waste of time.\nI wanted to do the above tasks using a checklist so i have tried this\nDISTROS=$(whiptail --title \"Do you want to\" --checklist \\\n\"Do you want to\" 15 60 4 \\\n\"AFM\" \"Do Antiferromagnetic calculation\" OFF \\\n\"SO\" \"Include Spin Orbital correction\" ON \\\n\"mBj\" \"Do mBj correction\" OFF \\\n\"DFT+U\" \"Do DFT+U calculation\" ON \\\n\"Elastic\" \"Calculate Elatic properties\" OFF 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3)\n\nexitstatus=$?\nif [ $exitstatus = 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Your favorite distros are:\" $DISTROS\nelse\n    echo \"You chose Cancel.\"\nfi\n\nThe last code is not doing what i want because i do not know how to retrieve decision data from it and use it.\n\nA: If you use whiptail's --separate-output option, it might be easier to work with:\n--separate-output\n      For checklist widgets, output result one line at a time, with no\n      quoting.

I am an avid gamer that used to play off of steam on windows, and am now finding that steam doesn't work and I cannot play any non- linux games.

What will it result to? \nI wanted to save some time by not changing my folder before running the command as well as not typing the full path as I was in current directory where I wanted to change.  \n\nA: That command will change permissions to anything inside /var/www/html/mysite to read, write, execute for owner, group and others. You basically void all form of security.\nIn case anyone from the outside world gets access to your system they can do anything with these files. Including deleting them. \nBy the way: I consider this also bad for a development server.\n\n\n*\n\n*how are you suppose to decide if some script will work on an active server. It might be that the \"777\" on the development server make it seem like something is working properly but it is not. \n\n*what do you do when stuff needs to go live? Check every file for proper permissions?\n\n*at some point you will find that the active server acts differently and you will decide to use a \"chmod 777\" on your active server. Opening a can of worms. \n\n\nFor a correct working website the permissions can be set (and reset) with these 2 commands:\nfind /var/www/html/mysite -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\nfind /var/www/html/mysite -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n\n\nA: chmod 777 makes a file/folder readable, write-able and executable by everyone.\nSo essentially on your site folder, you have given everyone permission to write to that folder, so you have reduced security on the folder. Not a good thing on a public web server, but I am guessing this is for development purposes on your local box.\nThe -R argument also means that it is recursive so the permission change applies to every file in that directory.\n\nA: The result of your action is full read, write, and execute permissions via chmod 777 on every file in the directory you ran the command in and dur to the -R (recursive) switch every file in every directory under that.\n", "Q: Choosing \"something else\" when installing I am in the process of installing Kubuntu 14.4 on my Windows 10 computer.  Normally I would simply use the whole disk, as I don't really like Windows, however there are a few programs I like to use, and want to keep it.\nI have tried this in the past, and failed.  Ending up erasing the entire disk and using it for Linux  (have used several flavors in the past).\nMy problem is configuring the hard disk.  I have never quite been able to understand partitioning.  I usually screw it up, one way or another.  The last time totally messing up a hard drive in my laptop, to the point I had to install a new one and start from scratch (hey now I have a better hard drive with double the space) I always manage somehow to mess up the order of the partitions. Don't ask me how.  It should be fairly straightforward.  The last time I tried I ended up with no mount point, and could not get anything to install.\nI would like to see some sort of graphic showing just what I will encounter when I choose \"something else\".  (I have already tried Kubuntu on this machine and it worked fine, even the touchscreen).\nI remember trying to install another distro some time ago, and being presented with questions I had no idea how to answer, regarding formatting the disk.  So if there is someone out there who has the patience to walk me through this, I would appreciate it. I also have problems converting MB's to GB's. For some reason it always is much less than I thought. I have a 2 TB hard drive. So figuring it out in MB's is a bit confusing.  Hey for years, I couldn't make change for a dollar!\nWhat I have now is two small volumes at the beginning that simply say \"Healthy\" and nothing else.  I assume they are something that came with my HP 23 Aio.  Both are in the  milibytes.  Then There is C drive which is Windows. I have 196 GB free out of 496 GB. There is a recovery drive D marked \"new volume\" that is 450MB, Then there is a drive E that is the largest being 1.5 GB.  It is also marked \"new volume\" and appears to be empty. At least that is what the file manager says.\nI really don't want to shrink C drive as I have quite a few video and music files stored. Which is why I believe the drive is more than half full.  Windows not showing what is stored just where. That leaves E, which I had tried to shrink, and D which I had deleted after making a recovery USB.  Those two mistakes left me with unallocated space after D drive, and after E drive.  So I restored from a recovery USB (it's still doing its thing two hours already).  Supposedly that will restore everything to the way it was before I tried to manipulate the partitions. I have my important files saved to an external HD.\n\nA: Okay, from your post I'll assume that Install alongside Windows is not working.\nNow for the partitioning:\nPartitions needed by Linux\nLinux needs the following partitions to install:\n\n*\n\n*A root partition -- mounted at / -- contains all files\n\n*A swap partition -- used as additional RAM -- if you have decent amounts of RAM (8 GB or more), you may not need this\n\nHow to partition\nDo not start the installer yet!\nI'll assume the entirety of the disk is taken up by Windows partitions.\nIf you want to install Kubuntu on your hard drive, you'll need to shrink a partition or there won't be any space!\nUsing Partition Manager (found in the menu), right-click on the partition you want to shrink and select Resize/Move.\nThere will be a rectangle with something like sd... on it. Select the edge of it with the mouse and drag it to resize.\nThe recommended amount of free space (indicated by a rectangle divided by a line from the previous rectangle (it's so hard to put GUIs into words!)) is 20-25 GB.\nClick Apply or OK or something.\nNow you will have some free space.\nNow, start the installer!\nWhen you get to the Something Else... option, choose it. Right click your shiny new free space and choose \"New partition\".\nSelect it to mount at / and used as Ext4 ... filesystem and check \"Format\".\nNow do the same for the little bit of space, except this time, don't change the mount point and select it to be used as swap.  Its recommended size should be\namount_of_free_space - half_of_RAM_size.\nYou are now ready to continue!\nP.S. Still in doubt? Refer to this excellent answer.\nWelcome to Linux and hope you like it!\n\nA: Why to resize Windows C drive and invite difficultly? Rather use the E drive for Ubuntu plus Swap. Format it with EXT4 for / and keeping 2-4 GB swap. Install normally after selecting grub on MBR (sda). Post installation you can mount Windows partition via File manager and use whatever file you want. \nAs you have 1500GB space in E, why not breaking it into 2, maybe 100GB and 1400GB. 100GB for Ubuntu plus Swap and 1400GB Formatted as NTFS for data. So that it can be used by both the OS. Just mark it as do not use this 1400GB partition while installing Ubuntu. \n\nA: Most if not all long time Linux users will omit any tips to preserve any W's related usability. Windows installer doesn't format partitions since long time now. The last time I saw that I was still in W XP. So you need to leave the disk Unallocated from a Live CD session and do the restore again if you want total control over partition Layout which in W's is not total. But you can install in any order with another method and just leave unallocated space where you want W's.\nI assume you want Windows in one piece so in that case you are going to need a little help of a flash drive.\nIf this is a laptop great in most cases because laptops usually have a SD card reader so you buy the fastest bad boy card and use it during installation ( empty but with a Fat 32 partition ), what you would is sort out the partitioning layout problem and install Kubuntu in the hard drive but the bootloader in the memory card. Last, go to your Bios settings and set the first drive for Booting as the memory card.\nWhen in Kubuntu make a disknimage backup of the booloader and in every update to it.\nThis is actually all you need to sort out if you want Windows to be really intact.\nThe Boot loaded used in Linux commonly support W's so it will be included in the boot loader for Kubuntu.\nAFAIK Kubuntu shows the menu when two or more OS's are installed but you can change that to skip the boot menu and just pull out the card and W's will boot.\nThat's is done in the GRUB configuration.\nA more correct way (and less painful ) would be to install W's last after any Linux distro you use and a copy of Hiren's boot CD in an USB drive to make the process faster but I haven't done that. The idea is that Windows will set it's bootloader and will work well with upgrading and other utilities that could be affected by not having it's original loader.\nIf you desire this, ask for help in the Ubuntu forums and double check everything stated here.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Steam not installing - unmet dependencies I can't seem to install steam.

These are the settings I have in my smbd.conf file:\n#======================= Global Settings ===================================== \n[global]\nworkgroup = WORKGROUP\nserver string = Samba Server %v\nnetbios name = ubuntu\nsecurity = user\nmap to guest = bad user\ndns proxy = no\n#============================ Share Definitions ============================== \n[MyShare]\npath = /samba/share \nbrowsable =yes\nwritable = yes\nguest ok = yes\nread only = no\n[test]\npath = /home/michael/test\nvalid users = michael\nread only = no\n\nWhen I try mapping my network drive to the samba server. Windows cannot find it. How do I find my server and establish the connection? Thank you.\n\nA: Are you sure you can contact the server VIA the VPN? \nHave you tried pinging it by IP address and by hostname? (To get the Internal IP address of your server go to your command line and type ipconfig)\nif you can ping via IP address and not by hostname you will need to map the drive as such \\XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX\\Sharename (Replacing the X's with your internal IP address) \nIf you dont wish to map by IP address every time you will need to edit your windows 10 Host File to include the name of your server, confirm this has worked correctly by pinging the hostname in CMD.\n", "Q: Sandisk usb stick wont show up on computer new here.

When attempting the top answer, the ls command returned unknown file system for each hard drive listed, the same problem as described here: Using testdisk for windows 10 upgrade\nI booted into Ubuntu with a thumbdrive, ran test-disk which came back with no problems, and then I ran boot-repair which claimed to successfully fix any problems.  Windows 10 finished updating but now there is no option to boot into Ubuntu.  As far as I can tell Ubuntu has been completely erased from the system. According to disk management there are 2 small unnamed drives but I reserved a lot more space for Ubuntu when I originally partitioned for the dual boot.  I'm not worried about any info lost, everything important is in Dropbox.\nI would like to know if windows really did erase Ubuntu and if yes is it safe to reinstall?  If it didn't erase Ubuntu how do I clean up my computer and get Ubuntu working again, I don't mind reinstalling and creating a fresh partition I just want a \"clean\" system.\n\nEDIT\nI booted from a live usb and ran gparted as suggested.  I got this error message:\n /dev/sdb contains GPT signatures, indicating that it has a GPT table.  \n However, it does not have a valid fake msdos partition table, as it    should.  \n Perhaps it was corrupted -- possibly by a program that doesn't understand GPT \n partition tables.  Or perhaps you deleted the GPT table, and are now using an \n msdos partition table.  Is this a GPT partition table?\n\nI just clicked the red x to close the error message and this is what gparted shows:\n\nIt looks as though there is a small amount of unallocated space and a small amount of space left over from Ubuntu. I'd like to clean up these partitions before reinstalling ubuntu.  Is it safe to just merge the unallocated space into my main windows disk and also reformat the leftover linux partitions, absorb them into the windows partition and then reinstall?\nBasically I don't want make sure everything is cleaned up before reinstalling linux, I don't like having all these small fragements but I don't know what I'm doing really.\n\nA: I certainly don't see any partitions that would be large enough for Ubuntu and which Windows doesn't recognize. This is honestly the first time I've seen Windows remove Ubuntu like that.\nIt should be safe to reinstall. Just format that free space as ext4 in the installer and install to it. That deletion should not happen again. I have a suspicion that TestDisk is the cause.\n\nA: I am not 100% sure but we have here a MBR style disk.\nThe two unnamed partitions are recovery partitions. Don't delete them.\nThe small unnamed partition is what Windows 10 creates always on installation/upgrade - it holds Windows PE recovery.\nThe unnamed ~8 GB partition should be factory Recovery - holds a complete image of your system as it was delivered.\nThe 116 GB \"free space\" is where Linux is. Windows does not recognize it.\nWindows always rewrites MBR on major updates/upgrades just to be sure that it is in control of the booting! THIS WAS ALWAYS THE CASE so no surprise.\nReinstalling GRUB to MBR should do the trick. Use a Linux live CD/DVD/USB and reinstall GRUB - How to Repair, Restore, or Reinstall Grub 2 with a Ubuntu Live CD or USB \n\nA: It's unclear from your information whether you're booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode or in EFI/UEFI mode. If the former, be aware that the built-in Windows partitioning software is dangerously broken, and has been for years. Specifically, it doesn't handle extended and logical partitions properly, which can result in partitions being deleted or changed in ways that violate the MBR partitioning standards.\nIf this is the problem you've run into, TestDisk might be able to recover your Linux partition(s). (Yes, I know you say you've tried it, but you may have missed a recovery option in your first attempt, so it's worth going back and trying again, perhaps following the official documentation rather than somebody else's instructions.) If you can recover a Linux partition in this way, you'll probably have to re-install GRUB to get it all working again.\nAll that said, I'd like to reiterate how I began: It's unclear how you're booting. If you're booting in EFI/UEFI mode, as may well be the case, then your disk probably uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which the Windows partitioning software handles much better than it handles the old Master Boot Record (MBR) system, so my hypothesis is almost certainly wrong in this case. You can determine the partition table type, and therefore the probable Windows boot mode, with parted from an Ubuntu emergency boot:\n$ sudo parted /dev/sda print | grep Table\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nThis example shows a GPT disk. An MBR disk would show up as having a partition table of msdos.\n", "Q: how to see the connected device to my hotspot in ubuntu 14.04 I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and I have make a wifi hotspot using kde-nm-connection-editor.\nNow I am looking for a way to I can see the device that connected to it.\nI try nmap but that what I have got the following terminal output for sudo nmap -sP 154.96.48.199:\n\n\nA: arp -a should return you a list of all connected devices.

So some packages are upgraded while some are not. Hence your system is in a unstable state. You can resume your upgrade by running dpkg --reconfigure -a. If the upgrade finished successfully, it's perfectly fine to reboot. \nBut if the upgrade was interrupted again, there is a fair chance that the system may not reboot properly.

The server may give you a directory listing of a directory if you request a directory path rather than a specific file and there is no default file to send available (i.e. index.html). But this directory listing is not a directory listing as the output of the shell command ls -l, but a server generated html-document which contains a well formatted and linked representation of a directory listing which, of cause, must not contain all files of the server directory.\nIt is up to you to analyse the delivered html document and take the information you need to traverse through the server file system.\nBut as I say, the server may send you that listing. But it is more common that there is a default file in the directory (i.e. index.html) which the server would deliver or that it sends you a html-document with the content \"404 - Not found\" to inform you, that the requested directory has no default file to deliver and that there is nothing else the server could do for you.\n\nA: From man page\nWget - The non-interactive network downloader.\n\nIf you do not want to use GUI based browser, try something in commandline as lynx\n$ sudo apt-get install lynx\n$ lynx www.google.com\n\n\nA: with browser cat (bcat) and wget:\nsudo apt-get install ruby-bcat\nwget -O - http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget | bcat\n\n", "Q: Pycharm does not start because \"No JDK found\" I installed Pycharm, which automatically created then a shortcut at the Applications Menu.

(I'm running fvwm with multiple virtual windows and I need to be able to see all of them on the external monitor.)   When I attach the external monitor, everything works, but only in extended or \"twinview\" mode.      From gnome-control-center display, when I switch to mirror mode, and click Apply,  I get the same error that has been reported elsewhere, in particular here and also here, with a screenshot i.e., \nGDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.gnome.SettingsDaemon was not provided by any .service files\n\nMy problem seems different from those previously reported, since I have no problems with extended mode.

The image below is a schematic map of what my setup looks like, i.e., there a six virtual desktops, in a 2x3 configuration, each one has multiple xterms open.\n\nJacob, your xrandr suggestion enabled me to view the left-most and the right-most columns, but not the middle column of these virtual desktops.   Currently, I still have a 2x3 setup with the left column, the right column, and a blank column.   As I mentioned last time, it's striking that the middle column of virtual desktops (each screen in the middle has two xterms, including the one that's in focus in the image) is the column that's not visible now. But when I attached the external monitor originally, and was in extended mode, the middle column was the only column that I could see.   \nI'd very much like to be able to have access to all six virtual desktops, when I'm attached to an external monitor.   I hope this is clear!     \n\nA: Looking at your screen names (eDP1, DP3), the xrandr command:\nxrandr --output eDP1 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output DP3 --pos 0x0\n\nshould allign both screens on position (x)0, (y)0 of the spanning screen layout, setting your screens mirrored in an alternative way.\nEffectively, this would be exactly the same as mirroring your screens.\nPut the command under a shortcut\nTo use the command in a convenient way, you can create a shortcut key with the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"xrandr --output eDP1 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output DP3 --pos 0x0\"\n\nChoose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"xrandr --output eDP1 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output DP3 --pos 0x0\"\n\nto a key shortcut of your choice.\nExplanation\nThe two screens combined make a rectangle,\n\nin which you can position the screens with the xrandrcommand:\nxrandr --output <screen_name> --pos 0x0\n\nwhere 0x0 are the x/y coordinates of the screen in the whole picture. By setting it to 0x0 for both screens, the screens coincide, effectively the same as being mirrored.\n\nEDIT\nfrom your edit, I read you are using FVWM window manager, which apparantly (still) assumes the second screen is next to the first one. In that case\nxrandr --output  eDP1 --auto --output DP3 --auto --same-as eDP1\n\nshould mirror the screens, but you'll have to see how FVWM reacts on this one.\n", "Q: Grub menu doesn't appear on dual boot with win8.1 After installing Ubuntu 14.04.3 on a HP Pavilion G6 that had windows 8.1 pre-installed, I am unable to see the grub menu.

The tracefs directory was created to allow people to mount the tracing directory directly at /sys/kernel/tracing and not require enabling debugfs. But for backward compatibility, when mounting the debugfs directory, it would automatically mount tracefs in the \"tracing\" directory of debugfs.\nNow when you perform lsof it looks at the /proc/filesystems file as well as /proc/mounts. It sees that tracefs is mounted at /sys/kernel/debug/tracing, and thus tries to stat it. Unfortunately, because /sys/kernel/debug wont let non-root users see inside of it, you get the error message when trying to stat the directory \"tracing\" from within /sys/kernel/debug. If you unmount the debugfs directory, the warning will go away.\n\nA: The answer to your question is in the file permissions:\ntry:\n$ ls -l /sys/kernel/debug/tracing\nls: cannot access '/sys/kernel/debug/tracing': Permission denied\n$ ls -l /sys/kernel\ntotal 0\n...\ndrwx------  31 root root    0 2016-06-15 11:06:47 debug\n...\n\nSo, normal users are not allowed to access /sys/kernel/debug/tracing and there seems to be no way to ask lsof to avoid accessing it.\nWe could then discuss whether this is a bug or not, but the answer to your question boils down to this.\n\nA: The Warning is written to stderr. You can always just redirect this to the /dev/null:\nlsof <any-file> 2>/dev/null\n\nCheers,\n", "Q: jre and jdk installation I got following error while installing the open jdk from ubuntu 14.04.\nhow do i solve this ?\nYou might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n default-jre : Depends: openjdk-7-jre (>= 7~u3-2.1.1)\n openjdk-6-jre-lib : Depends: openjdk-6-jre-headless (>= 6b27)\n openjdk-7-jdk : Depends: openjdk-7-jre (= 7u95-2.6.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1)\nE: Unmet dependencies.

So I cannot move downwards by two-fingers like in other views. \nI think this is a bug in BTsync's frontend that causes most complications in limited view environments like running the software in VirtualBox's Ubuntu where I have about 5\" screen/display size because of memory limitations. \nVirtualBox is here just a test environment and I can reproduce the bug in running Ubuntu in embedded systems of small displays. \nThe bug is specific to Linux because they have unique login through the internet browser. \nI successfully created the user ID just before going to the view in the screenshot; however, I cannot get forward as described above. \nI cannot completely see the view below in the internet browser. \nI am running VirtualBox inside OS X El Capitan. \nHow can you pass the view in the internet browser by some Terminal command?

But after a bit, nothing was on the screen. Only a dark violet background. So, after 5 minutes, I kept pressed the power button and my laptop shut down. When I booted it back, the laptop showed somthing. I think that the most important thing is:\n\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root contains a file system with errors, check forced.\n  /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root: Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked list found. /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root: UNEXPECTED INCOSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY. fsck exited with status code 4. The root filesystem on /dev/dm-0 requires a manual fsck.\n\nBut fsck doesn't work. I also attached a photo. I wouldn't like to reinstall Ubuntu, because I have lots of important stuff. I have another (Windows) laptop, which now I use. What should I do? The error\n\nA: Yup. It looks like you have a bad superblock. First I'll tell you the cause of the problem, and then give you the solution. : )\nThe cause:\nOk. So when Ubuntu boots, it goes through 4 stages:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS\n\n*Bootloader\n\n*Kernel\n\n*System Startup\nBIOS\nWhen your computer goes through BIOS, it executes the firmware code, which tells the important components like the CPU, RAM, Display and others: \"Hey guys! Wake up, its time to work!\" So once everyone wakes up, the computer moves on to the next stage:\nBootloader\nWhen you see that purple screen that says something like \"GRUB\", then that's GRUB, the bootloader. It lets you choose which operating system you want to boot, advanced options for them, and other things like opening a command line. Once you have chosen an OS to boot, it moves on to the next stage:\nKernel\nThe kernel stage is probably the most important of all because that's when the system mounts the hard drive, reads the important files on it, and actually 'put together' the computer. That's where you're having your problem. The system was most likely trying to mount the hard drive when you force closed it. It stuck midway through, and even though it reset, the drive still has an error. The superblock was damaged.\nSolution:\nStep 1:\nGet the DVD that you installed Ubuntu from, boot into it, and choose the 'Try Ubuntu without installing' option when it shows its temporary 'bootloader'.\nStep 2:\nOnce it loads, open a terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T\nStep 3:\nExecute this:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThat will list all disk partitions. Now, you can find the partition your broken boot is on. Usually, the partition that holds your main OS is usually the one marked as bootable. This is the output of mine, as an example:\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   637770013   318883983   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2       637771774  1953523711   657875969    5  Extended\nPartition 2 does not start on physical sector boundary.\n/dev/sda5      1945303040  1953523711     4110336   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda6       637771776  1945303039   653765632   83  Linux\n\nThe bootable partition is marked with a *. That is most likely the broken one.\nStep 4.\nExecute this command:\nsudo dumpe2fs /dev/(sda the live cd is on*) | grep superblock\n\n\n\n*\n\n*if your linux is a dual-booted one, list the partition that the broken boot is on\n\n\nIt will list all backup superblocks to fix the broken superblock.

And, by the way, the -y at the end is to answer all the Fix? questions. Trust me. There are a lot of them. \nSo, once you run it, it gets really cool, or creepy, (it's cool to me XD) because it will start to imitate a TV that is on a static channel. That was really funny when i first saw it! Take a video recording and turn it into a GIF if you like. (i might attach one one time ; )\nSo! Enough talking while we wait! Once that's done, move on to the next step:\nStep 6.\nMount the drive:\nsudo mount /dev/(sda that cd is on) /mnt\n\nSo you can test the filesystem.\nStep 6.\n6A.\nLogin to root:\nsu\n\n6B.\nRun command: \ncd /mnt\n\n6C\nRun command:\nmkdir fixtest\n\n6D\nRun command:\nrm fixtest\n\nIf you're able to do all these commands without errors, then you're all set!
