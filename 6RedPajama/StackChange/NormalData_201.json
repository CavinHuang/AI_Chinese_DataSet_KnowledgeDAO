How can I do this?\n\nA: The sleep command make delay for a specified amount of time (in seconds). With sleep 1 delay would be for 1 second (one word per second). You can change for more time delay by incrementing the second parameter or for delaying less than 1 second divide it to low units; Like sleep .1 for 1/10 second delay or sleep .001 for 1/1000 second delay and etc.\nSo if you want to display 120 words per minute you can use sleep .5 (that means display each word in 0.5 second which also means 120 words in a minute)\nAnd your final script would be as following:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor word in $(< \"$2\");\ndo\n    echo \"$word\";\n    sleep  $1;\n    clear;\ndone\n\nSave the script named scriptname.sh and make it as executable by chmod +x scriptname.sh and then run the script with ./scriptname.sh .5 infile\n\nA: It's a frequent practice to use while read line ; do . . .; done structure in bash to read file line by line. Assuming your input file has one word per line, it's easy to do something like this:\nwhile read line; do printf \"%s\\n\" \"$line\" ; sleep 3; done < input.txt\n\nPython can do this quite easily:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys,time\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    print line.strip()\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    time.sleep(1)\n\nUsage:\npython print_with_delay.py <input.txt \n\n", "Q: Bluetooth on Lenovo Ideapad S20-30 Today I installed Ubuntu on my Lenovo S20-30 and most things work but I can't use bluetooth.

My only option to launch ubuntu is through the tryout on a usb flash drive I used to install it in first time.\nHelp would be really appreciated!\n\nA: Since you cannot enter Advanced Options menu during boot and then into recovery mode, you will have to recover your system through live USB or cd. Load it, enter tty1 by pressing  CtrlAltF2  or open terminal in the live-session (Try Ubuntu option). \nNext mount your Ubuntu partition with \nsudo mount /dev/sdax /mnt, where x is the number of your Ubuntu partition, (use lsblk command to identify it by size, most likely it is 3 or 5).\nNext, sudo chroot /mnt.

All the guides I've found are outdated. I have 3 partitions on my disk: / (formatted as ext4), /home (ext4), and swap. Is dual booting possible? If so, how would I do it? I'm mainly concerned because 13.2 uses BTRFS as it's default file system.\n\nA: Yes, you can do it. The SuSe installer will ask you how to partition your hard drive. At that point, you'll be able to choose to create a new partition using the empty space of one of your existing partitions. Then, you can choose to format that new partition as BTRFS or whatever else you like and install your new system there.\nA safer approach might be to boot into a live session and create your partition manually before installing but, strictly speaking, that shouldn't be necessary.\n", "Q: Broadcom chipset tx power I recently found an online guide about reducing electromagnetic radiation.Following the steps i get this output from     sudo iwconfig\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:\"pi\"  \n      Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.432 GHz  Access Point: 5A:55:28:42:8A:4E   \n      Bit Rate=72 Mb/s   Tx-Power=1 dBm   \n      Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n      Encryption key:off\n      Power Management:off\n      Link Quality=49/70  Signal level=-61 dBm  \n      Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n      Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0\n\nAre those values safe because i'm spending a lot of hours with my laptop.Any help would be appreciated\n\nA: Yes, your tx-power is very low (1dBm). The most restrictive international standard is set at 20dBm or roughly 100mW. Right now, you are at about 1% or 1.25mW\nIn the United States and in Canada, the limit is set to 37dBm which is roughly 5W! \nI would also recommend adjusting the txpower of your wireless router. If this setting is not available on your router, use a different firmware. Although, I'm pretty sure the linksys txpower is pretty low like 40 or 70mW.\nAlso, you can set the txpower even lower so long as it is still functional:\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 txpower 0\n\nThe setting above will equal 1mW\n", "Q: UBUNTU 14.04 LTS tearing and black screen I had no problem with nvidia card and suddenly lost driver...\nI tried everything in the Internet with no luck.

I did the dd method and it wrote the iso to the USB drive, but I'm not sure that's all I have to do because it is Windows and may not have GRUB and I'm not sure so I'm asking the experts. \nwinusb does not work for Windows 10 so this is different from earlier questions.\n\nA: You can copy all the ISO contents to the flash drive and make it bootable.\nSo, first of all, install GParted from software center or from terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nThen, open it from dash or terminal:\ngksudo gparted\n\nAfter that, choose the flash drive from the menu in top right corner.\nThere should be one partition. If you haven't any data to backup, reformat it as ntfs (bootmgr doesn't work right on fat32), click Apply (the tick in the header menu). Right-click the partition, choose Manage flags and check boot.\nThen, you can mount it through your file manager (nautilus is default for GNOME and Unity).\nMount the ISO file:\nsudo mount -o loop [path to iso] [mountpoint]\n\nThen, you can copy all contents from the ISO mountpoint to the flash drive via the file manager.\nReboot your computer and set the USB Flash Drive to boot first.\n\nA: I tried all the ways in this thread and none worked (and seriously, the question is about specifically writing to an USB key, why would people propose copying the ISO to another partition instead ??).\nThe solution that did the trick for me (assuming your USB drive is /dev/sdc): \n\n\n*\n\n*Run gparted\n\n*Create a new partition table on sdc, type msdos\n\n*Create a NTFS partition, set the boot flag on it\n\n*Extract the iso (can be done with 7z x windows10.iso)\n\n*Copy the content (via cp, rsync, a GUI, whatever) to the mounted NTFS partition (certainly /dev/sdc1)\n\n*The last, critical step, taken from this post : https://superuser.com/a/817656/248812 is : \nsudo ms-sys -7 /dev/sdc.\nms-sys is available in a ppa :\nhttps://launchpad.net/~lenski/+archive/ubuntu/ms-sys\nWithout ms-sys, blinking cursor on boot when the USB key is inserted.\nWith it, windows logo shows up.\n\nA: I managed to do this with the very simple GUI application of woeusb. https://github.com/slacka/WoeUSB\nIt's a fork of WinUSB.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt-get install woeusb\n\n\nA: The ms-dos package is quite old an unmaintained. It does not load on ubuntu 16-04. Instead use the syslinux package which most likely already is installed:\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/08/repair-windows-mbr-from-ubuntu/\nAlso cp to an ntfs partition is slow. Extract the iso directly to sdc1\n\n\n*\n\n*Run gparted\n\n*Create a new partition table on sdc, type msdos\n\n*Create a NTFS partition, set the boot flag on it\n\n*Copy the iso\nsudo dd of=/dev/sdc1 if=Win10_1703_English_x64.iso bs=4M\n\n*Create MBR\nsudo dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr/mbr.bin of=/dev/sdc\n\nA: You don't need a USB, DVD or other external medium to install a Windows 10 Install Disk (ISO) starting from a Ubuntu only installation. It is possible to extract the image or ISO file to a partition of one your hard disks, preferable not the one your will use for a new Windows installation, and use it. \nFor the following steps, a working GRUB configuration should be present:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have a bootable and formatted NTFS partition present. Below, the partition will identified by (hd0,5) where hd0 is the containing hard disk with MSDOS or MBR partition table layout. \n\n*Mounting the image will make it easier to extract it's contents. If Disk Image Mounter refuses to mount the iso file you can always use this command to mount any iso file:\nsudo mount -o loop [Image_Path] [Mount_Point]\n\n\n*Copy the contents of new loop device to the NTFS partition.\n\n*Now add a GRUB entry for Windows 10. This will make it possible for the bootloader GRUB to find install disk contained in the partition. Open /boot/grub/grub.cfg in text editor as root and add these lines\nmenuentry 'Windows 10 Install Disk' {\nset root=(hd0,5)\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ntfs\ninsmod ntldr\ndrivemap -s (hd0) ${root}\nntldr /bootmgr\n}\n\nchange the root if needed, accordingly.\n\n*Save and restart computer. Boot into the right item of your updated GRUB menu.\nWatch this Youtube tutorial https://youtu.be/1Y4JXv9r5Ug\n\nA: If you weren't sure, then how can you say that the dd method worked? Also, that ain't the way. You have to use Rufus to make the USB drive bootable;not that I discourage the dd practices, since it is Windows we are talking about, I believe it is best to use Rufus to handle this for you.\nIf you have a Windows installation already, then boot into it and follow the steps below or else, use virtualbox.\nPROCEDURE:\nAccording to: http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-install-windows-10-technical-preview-from-a-flash-drive/\nyou'll need at least 4GB flash drive (8GB for 64-bit).\n--> Download and run Rufus, then insert your flash drive, making sure it doesn't contain any important data. (It's about to get wiped.) Rufus should automatically detect the drive and list it in the Device field. (If not, select the drive manually.)\n--> Notice the check box marked, \"Create a bootable disk using.\" Click the drive icon at the far right, then navigate to wherever you saved the Windows 10 ISO file. Select it, and then click Start. (All the other default settings in Rufus should be fine.)\n--> This will take some time, perhaps as long as 20-30 minutes. Don't be alarmed (or confused) if an Explorer window appears for the flash drive; just leave it alone until Rufus reports \"DONE.\" Then you can close the program and drive window and remove the drive.\n--> Now it's time for the old PC. Plug the flash drive into a USB port, then power up the system. Most likely, it won't be configured to boot from an external drive by default, so you may need to jump into a startup menu or the BIOS during the POST. Ultimately, you need to force the machine to boot from the flash drive. Once you've done that, reboot, then follow the Windows installation instructions.\nAll the best!\n\nA: Found a much easier solution. Mount the ISO with loop etc and -t udf. Copy everything in a spare NTFS partition. Mark this partition as boot in gparted. Run sudo update-grub and reboot. \n\nA: I tried with the ms-sys, it ran but I could not get the USB to boot. However, this worked:\nsudo apt install woes\nsudo woeusb --target-filesystem NTFS --device Win10.iso /dev/sdX\n\nwhere the /dev/sdX must be your USB key.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 14.04.2 dual boot with Windows 7 Based on the results shown below, I believe that my next step would be to shrink the C/: volume from within Win7 and install Ubuntu in the free space.

The installation process is not prompting me to re-partition my Windows 7 Hard Disk. Should I do this manually from within Windows 7 or Is there a utility I can use from the Ubuntu DVD? \nHow can I partition my Hard Disk?\n23/03/2015\nThank you for your reply David. I am attempting to install Ubuntu on a HP Pavilion dv4 with 4GB of RAM and 500GB HDD. The fdisk -l, gdisk -l, and parted -l commands yielded no results (although I'm not sure what you meant by (MBR)?). \nFrom the Win7 Computer Manager screen I see the following volumes:\nUnnamed:  NTFS 199MB;\n(C:)  NTFS  446.38GB;\nHP-TOOLS (E:) FAT32 99MB;\nRECOVERY (D:) NTFS 19.08GB.\n\nAll of these Volumes are 'Simple' and 'Basic'. These Volumes were also shown on the Ubuntu Desktop running from the Live CD.\nIf I shrink the (C:) volume from the Win7 Computer Management screen, will Ubuntu be able to install in the free space?\n\nA: There is no such thing as 'not prompting to re-partition the HDD' in a OS installation. Even if your HDD wasn't detected, the setup would warn you about it. \nAt the Installation Type screen, you can choose Something else and define your own partitions for Ubuntu setup. It would be best to use this option rather than choosing to install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\nBesides, without sufficient information, we cannot help you any further. Post some screenshots of each step starting from the Welcome prompt.\n\nA: You've got 4 primary partitions, so shrinking one will not allow you to create an additional one as you've got an msdos partition table and 4 is the maximum.\nSo you've got to:\n\n\n*\n\n*make an image backup of the entire disk\n\n*delete one of the partitions (I would take the HP-TOOLS) \n\n*resize your partitions as needed\n\n*create an extended partition (sda5)\n\n*create a partition inside the extended partition (sda6)\n\n*restore the deleted partition (sda6)\n\n*install Ubuntu in the free space of the extended partition (I would create 2 partitions: one for / and one for /home )\n\n\nAlternatively, (not recommended) you could also take an image backup of only one partition and restore that...\n\nA: Success :) I now have a dual boot Win7/Ubuntu PC. For those of you who are like me and only somewhat technical, and are experiencing similar difficulties in installing Ubuntu on a Win7 PC, let me outline the steps that I took to solve this problem. \nAs Fabby noted, the problem was that my HP Dv4 PC already had 4 primary partitions and no unallocated space for Ubuntu to use. To resolve this I navigated to Computer Management -> Storage -> Disk Management in Win7. I then deleted one small partition (HPTools in my case) and shrank the largest partition (C:) by roughly half. This created roughly 200 GB of unallocated space. \nI then rebooted the PC from the Ubuntu Live CD. When prompted, I chose Install Ubuntu and Install together with Win7. The installer created an extended partition and two additional partitions inside the extended partition automatically. Once the installer was finished I was able to restart the PC and choose whether to boot in Win7 or Ubuntu. \nOne other small thing to note. When you are presented with the boot dialog where you select Win7 or Ubuntu, if you do nothing, the system automatically boots in Ubuntu after a few seconds. So if you want to boot in Win7, don't dilly-dally :) Good Luck.\n", "Q: How do I cast my Android screen to my Ubuntu HTPC? I have an Android phone running 5.0 (CM12) that has \"cast screen\" on the quick settings page, but no devices are listed. I don't own a Chromecast, but I have an Ubuntu HTPC running 14.04 and Kodi.\nWhat can I do to make the HTPC a receiver and show up on the network?\n\nA: Currently, i am finding a way to perform the casting operation by the default cast screen button given in the drop down menu for android 4.4 above(most probably). But there is another way using software and apps available in the Google Play Store.\n\n\n*\n\n*All Cast Receiver\n\n*Vysor\n\n\nIn both of these cases its as simple as installing the android app on your android device and adding the extension for the corresponding app installed and then just launch the extension and connect to the available network available from your android device. Note-> Both These extensions are for Chrome.\nCheck this list: http://www.topalternativeto.com/vysor\nIf you are still having problems with getting started just Google the application names and you would find someone making money with your required video on youtube.\n\nA: You can do this with the use of AllCast Receiver for Chrome and Mirror on your Android phone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Allcast Receiver for Chrome.  \n\n*Download Mirror for Android.  \n\n*Make sure your computer and smartphone are on the same WiFi network.  \n\n*Start AllCast Receiver through the Chrome App Launcher.  \n\n*Start Mirror on your Android phone.  \n\n*In Mirror, choose the Network Device that matches your PC. It will still start with \"Chrome @\" followed by an IP address.\n\n\nSolution grabbed from: makeuseof.com\n\nA: In addition to the answers above, you can't try using an Apple AirPlay sender app for Android in conjunction with Shairport-sync, which is available from this PPA. Just do\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:dantheperson/shairplay-sync\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install shairport-sync\n\nto install it. I personally have not tried it out,  tu it looks promising. If you just want to cast from the YouTube app or Google Play Music, there are a few older Google Cast receivers you can try. For instance, if you have Chromium or a derivative you can try CR Cast, which while no longer on the Chrome Web Store, still works happily on my Raspberry Pi. You will need to download as a zip and lad in the extension manually though. You can also try Nodecast which runs on NodeJS. You'll need to run it as root for it to work right. Just note that the previous two options don't support full screen mirroring, just YouTube.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu along with Windows 8.1 I'm using Windows 8.1 and also want to install Ubuntu as dual-boot?.\nShould I install Windows 8.1 on a separate partition and Ubuntu on another partition? Is there any problem like file distortion in case of installing both operating systems on a single partition?\n\nA: Unless you use Wubi, you need to install Ubuntu in a separate partition. Alas Wubi is deprecated and unsupported by Canonical and doesn't work at all in UEFI environments. Please perform a regular installation and choose \"alongside Windows\".\nWhile there is no practical risk, that Ubuntu damages your Windows installation or data on Windows partitions, both the manual or the automated re-partitioning, that occur before or during the first installation of Ubuntu on a system with pre-installed Windows, may fail or be interrupted (e. g. by a power failure), in which case your data would likely be lost. It is important that you back up your data. Data without a backup is by definition unimportant. And that's not just for Ubuntu or its installation procedure.\nRelevant resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (UEFI Supported)\n\n*Install Alongside Windows or Something Else - Which should I use?\n", "Q: Error Web page not available I am using Ubuntu 14.10 and always getting the error web page not available when I try to access certain web pages like http://www.edx.org, http://www.coursera.org and many more on chrome and mozilla. can anybody tell me why I'm getting such error with chrome and mozilla and how to fix this.\n\nA: Try pinging the website:\nping www.edx.org\n\nIf that doesn't work, try resolving the domain:\nnslookup www.edx.org\n\nIf that doesn't work either, test if you have internet connectivity at all:\nping 8.8.8.8 # public Google DNS server\n\nIf all commands failed, you're apparently not connected to the internet.\nIf the all but the last command fail try changing your DNS server to Google's public DNS.\nIf only the first command fails continue diagnosing your problem using traceroute:\ntraceroute www.edx.org\n\nSome tips on diagnosing connection problems: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-network-diagnose-tools.html\n", "Q: Dual boot Problem with windows 7 and ubuntu 14.04 i made dual boot of Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04,but after installing the Windows Drivers the Computer is not showing the option to choose between Windows and Ubuntu..it is directly moving to Windows..Why???\n\nA: Do you mean after installing the windows drivers, or after installing Windows?  My guess is that you installed Ubuntu first, then Windows, and after installing Windows you saw this problem.\nWindows doesn't know about the GRUB2 bootloader (the menu used to select between different operating systems) and writes its own bootloader when you install it.\nYou need to reinstall and reconfigure GRUB2.  This looks like a reasonably detailed description of how to do it, but there are other ways (google, now you know what you're trying to achieve) if that doesn't suit you.\n\nA: I think you have installed ubuntu first and than windows. If Yes, then you should go with the software Boot-Repair-Disk\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/\nBoot-Repair-Disk is a live CD that repairs multiple Linux distributions. Boot-Repair Disk repairs the GRUB boot loader of Linux and can repair multiple editions of Microsoft Windows operating systems.\nInstructions to use Boot-Repair-Disk are on links below\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n", "Q: Copy and overwrite directory recursively I have a directory called 'existing_folder' and another directory called 'temp' \nI want to replace the contents of 'existing_folder' with those of 'temp' along with any sub directories.\nBecause the directory contains web pages, this has to be done in a way that ensures minimal downtime. \nIs there a way to do this? What command should I use to achieve this? \n\nA: If both orig_folder and temp are on the same physical hard drive, renaming (moving) them is essentially instantaneous. That means you could simply do\nmv orig_folder foo && mv temp orig_folder && rm -rf foo\n\nThat will rename orig_folder to foo, then rename temp to orig_folder and finally delete foo. On the same filesystem, the two mv operations will take next to no time (0.004 seconds on my system). \nIf the source and target directories are not on the same file system, in order to minimize the time that the files are not available, you would first need to move the source directory to the same filesystem and then rename:\nmv /path/to/temp . && mv orig_folder foo && mv temp orig_folder && rm -rf foo\n\n\nA: Combining the accepted answer here with the command to copy one directory into another, the below command should do the job:\nrm -rfv <existing_folder>/* && cp -r <temp>/* <existing_folder>\n\nBut, as the answer in the link says, note that:\n\n\n*\n\n*the /* part is very important. If you put a space before the *, it will delete all your files in your current directory.\n\n*this won't delete hidden files\n\n*\"be very (very) careful playing with rm, -r and * all in the same command. They can be a disastrous combination.\"\n\nA: Have you tried rsync ?\nFrom your requirements I think it is the best tool. It will replace only the files that changed, copy new ones and it can remove those that are gone in origin.\n$ rsync -av --delete temp/ existing_folder/\n\nNotice the slash after temp, it is required because you want to sync the contents. Without it it would create a directori temp inside existing folder.\nThe delete argument makes the files that are no longer in temp be removed in existing_folder.\nYou can also do a dry-run if you add -n argument.

It's primarily intended for use with One Time Passwords, and the emerging U2F protocol - but since Yubikey version 2 it also supports HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response authentication.

For the most part, I'm following these instructions, with some added comments. The process is actually very easy to do. \nI've tested this on Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 and 18.04; using a Yubikey Neo. It should work with any recent Yubikey, with firmware 2.0+, and with any version of Ubuntu after 14.04. I've also tested Ubuntu 19.04 with a Yubikey 5C, some additional work was needed but it can be made to work. There could also be other hardware HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response devices that this works with, but I'm not aware of any that exist. As always, make sure you have a backup of your data before proceeding - there shouldn't be any issues here, but there's always the chance this will destroy everything on your computer. These instructions come with no warranty. \nUpdate: Since Ubuntu 16.04, the needed packages are in the main repositories and no PPA is needed.\nUpdate: Since Ubuntu 19.04 the software in the main repository seems to be broken after an update to cryptsetup. See my other answer for details on how to work around the problem..\nAdd a comment if you have questions!\n\n0. Prerequisites\nFor this to work, you will already have to have LUKS full-disk encryption set up and working. You can do this by selecting the appropriate option when installing Ubuntu. For maximum security, you should have a chosen very strong passphrase during the install. If your passphrase isn't up to scratch, you should change it to a better one before continuing (more detailed instructions here). \nThe method below will not replace any existing passphrases, but will instead add another passphrase to one of the LUKS slots. Hence if you lose your Yubikey you can still unlock your computer using any existing passphrase - I suggest you make a note of it and hide it away somewhere safe - you will also need it a few times during this procedure. Your new Yubikey challenge passphrase should still be reasonably strong, but doesn't have to be as long as the passphrase you used when installing Ubuntu. \n\n1. Add PrivacyIdea PPA and install package\nOn Ubuntu 14.04\nOpen a terminal, and run the following command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:privacyidea/privacyidea \n\nPress Enter when prompted, then run:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen install the package with:\nsudo apt-get install yubikey-luks\n\nOn Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04\nThere is no need for a PPA, you can install the package with:\nsudo apt-get install yubikey-luks\n\nOn Ubuntu 19.04\nSee this answer for how to build the yubikey-luks package from source for Ubuntu 19.04. \n\n2. Install Yubikey software\nIf you are using the HMAC-SHA1 functionality of the Yubikey for something else, you can skip this section. It will erase any configuration in the second Yubikey slot, so don't perform this step if you use HMAC-SHA1 for other purposes with this Yubikey. \nYou'll need to set up your Yubikey to work with Ubuntu by installing the required software, either from the Yubico PPA on Ubuntu 14.04 or from the main Ubuntu repository on 16.04 and later. \nOn Ubuntu 14.04\nIf you have not done so before, add the PPA and install the package with:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yubico/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install yubikey-personalization\n\nOn Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 (and later)\nsudo apt-get install yubikey-personalization\n\n\n3. Initialise Yubikey Slot for HMAC-SHA1\nNow we need to program the second slot of the Yubikey with a HMAC-SHA1 configuration. This will erase your previous slot configuration, which is empty by default. Again, if you are using HMAC-SHA1 for something else do not issue this command - it will erase your configuration. You can safely use the same secret key inside the Yubikey for this LUKS setup as for your other uses.  (For example, with another computer using LUKS+Yubikey).\nykpersonalize -2 -ochal-resp -ochal-hmac -ohmac-lt64 -oserial-api-visible\n\nThe terminal will display some information about the changes made. You don't need to note this down, but it will show the secret key used by the Yubikey in the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm to calculate the response when given a challenge. \n\n4. Enroll Yubikey to LUKS Slot\nNow we will edit the LUKS configuration to append the response from the Yubikey as one of the decryption keys.\nThe partition that we need to specify depends on whether you are using BIOS or UEFI to boot your machine. For BIOS, the encrypted volume is at /dev/sda5 by default, for UEFI it is at /dev/sda3. You can check this by opening the disks utility and confirming the path of the partition - it should either be sda3 or sda5. NOTE: On newer computers with NVMe disks, the path will be something like /dev/nvme0n1p3.\nRun this in a terminal: \nsudo yubikey-luks-enroll -d /dev/sda3 -s 7\n\nThis will write to slot 7 of the LUKS configuration, follow the prompts in the installer (they vary slightly depending on which version you're running). \nThen you're all done! You should be able to reboot your computer, and if your Yubikey is inserted then you can type in your challenge password and use the Yubikey as a second factor to unlock the LUKS partition and boot the system. Once you've decrypted the hard drive you can remove the Yubikey. \nIf you lose your Yubikey you can still enter your original (hopefully very long) passphrase to decrypt the hard drive, and then you can follow this procedure again to register a new Yubikey. \n\nChanging the encryption challenge passphrase\nChanging the password at a later date is quite simple, just use this command to reset the secret key. It is not entirely necessary to reset the secret key, but it won't hurt. Bear in mind that this will destroy the previous secret key, do not do this if you use HMAC-SHA1 for something else with this Yubikey. (For example, with another computer using LUKS+Yubikey).\n ykpersonalize -2 -ochal-resp -ochal-hmac -ohmac-lt64 -oserial-api-visible\n\nThen, similar to Step 4, above, to enroll a new password into the LUKS key slot, except opt to clear Slot 7 with this command:\nsudo yubikey-luks-enroll -d /dev/sda3 -s 7 -c\n\nWhen prompted to Enter any remaining passphrase, use your backup passphrase - not the Yubikey challenge passphrase. Then enter a new Yubikey challenge passphrase, twice, then finally you will need to enter the backup passphrase one last time. \nNow your old Yubikey challenge passphrase has been removed and only your new one will decrypt the hard drive. Your previous backup passphrase will still be the same. You can change that passphrase by following the links in Step 0. \n\nNote on security implications\nAdding a Yubikey will add a certain level of security to your system - someone has to know both the challenge passphrase and have your Yubikey to be able to unlock your hard drive (or find your initial passphrase, which you are now using as a backup). However, it is technically feasible for an attacker to decrypt the hard drive if they know your challenge passphrase (for example, by \"shoulder surfing\" you while you type it in) and can gain access to your Yubikey for only a short time. Using the challenge passphrase they could get the response from the Yubikey and store it, and then use it to decrypt the hard drive at any time without the Yubikey. Or, again if an attacker or a piece of malware knew your passphrase and was able to run code on a machine connected to your Yubikey they could also issue the challenge and store the response. It is therefore still extremely important to be vigilant when entering your challenge passphrase, and to ensure that you always have the Yubikey in a safe location. You should also only ever plug it into a machine that you trust. If you lose track of your Yubikey and suspect someone may have been using it to try to learn the decryption key, perform steps 2 and 3 again to reset the secret key inside the Yubikey and choose a new challenge passphrase. Note that if an adversary has managed to learn one of your passphrases (either the HMAC-SHA1 response from the Yubikey, or your backup) they could make a backup of the LUKS master key, and then use that to decrypt your hard drive even if you change the passphrase in the future. The man page for cryptsetup explains this, look at the luksHeaderBackup section. If you suspect this has happened then you must make an entirely new LUKS volume to protect your  data. \n\nA: Update for Ubuntu 19.04:\nIt seems like as of Ubuntu 19.04 (and maybe 18.10, I didn't try that release), cryptsetup has changed just enough to break how yubikey-luks used to work. This commit from the upstream repository seems to implement a fix, but the original repository doesn't seem to have been updated since October 2018. I found this fork of the repo which has the fix, as well as a few other bits of tidying-up, and managed to build a package which works on 19.04. \nSince I couldn't find an existing build of the updated fork, the method for getting yubikey-luks working involves getting the source code and building the DEB package locally, then installing it. \nFollow the steps in my previous answer, except replace step 1 with the below:\n\n1. Fetch yubikey-luks source, build and install package\nInstall build dependencies with:\nsudo apt install dh-exec devscripts expect yubikey-personalization\n\nThen download and extract the source archive:\nmkdir ~/tmp\ncd ~/tmp\nwget -O yubikey-luks.zip https://github.com/thuandt/yubikey-luks/archive/master.zip\nunzip yubikey-luks.zip\ncd yubikey-luks-*\n\nBuild the package with:\nmake builddeb NO_SIGN=1\n\nThen install it:\nsudo dpkg -i DEBUILD/yubikey-luks_*.deb\n\n\nThen continue following the remainder of the steps in my first answer. \nHopefully by 19.10 the version of yubikey-luks in the main Ubuntu archive can be updated so that manually building isn't required. \nAs a bonus, the newer version has a configuration file, which can be found at /etc/ykluks.cfg. The message shown on boot can be configured in this file. \n\nA: Even if you use 2FA, somebody still can get your LUKS key after you unlocked the volume and use it to unlock it later.\nThere are two projects (non-Ubuntu) that use yubikey and also change LUKS key every time when the user logs in. This way it becomes much harder to get access to the system even if the previous key and/or password is somehow known to the attacker. It is for really paranoid ones :)\nThese projects are:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/flowolf/initramfs_ykfde/ (Gentoo)\n\n*https://github.com/dmitryd/kali-yubikey/ (Kali)\n\nWhile they will not work directly for Ubuntu, they still can be adapted.\n", "Q: Create UEFI bootable USB stick to install Windows AND Ubuntu from it I know how to make a UEFI bootable stick to install Ubuntu (explained here) and I know how to make one to install Windows 7 (guide in German, sorry). I guess for Win 8 the procedure would be similar, but I haven't looked into it.\nI also know how to make a legacy bootable stick from which I can install Windows and Ubuntu using YUMI. I have failed so far though at creating a UEFI bootable stick that can do this. When I do a UEFI boot from my YUMI multiboot stick it gives me no option to choose between Ubuntu and Windows (hardly surprising I guess) and instead simply UEFI boots Windows (which I find kind of surprising to be honest but maybe this is due to the fact that I added the Windows image after the Ubuntu image and this simply replaced Ubuntu's EFI boot files).\nSo how would I proceed to create such a bootable stick?\n\nA: For EFI booting move all MS content under /EFI to another folder, call it /EFI.ms for example, with BOOT and Microsoft subfolders; this is to disallow certain UEFI firmwares to force boot Windows when they see it. Now under the EFI folder copy the BOOT and Ubuntu folders created for your bootable stick. Under /EFI/Ubuntu append this menu entry to the file grub.cfg you'll find there:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8.1 EFI Setup\" {\n    insmod ntfs\n    chainloader /EFI.ms/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n    boot    \n}\n\nMake sure you know which folder is which in case your Ubuntu files got replaced after you added the Windows image, I mean the /EFI/BOOT folder; it may contain two files for Ubuntu, bootx64.efi and grubx64.efi; those come from /EFI/Ubuntu folder, I think bootx64.efi is copied from shimx64.efi.\nFor MBR style booting from the same USB stick, append this entry to the txt.cfg file under /isolinux:\nlabel w81\n    menu label ^Setup Windows 8.1\n    COM32 chain.c32\n    APPEND fs ntldr=/bootmgr\n\n\nA: Old Obsolete Question\nThis question is about Windows 8\nThis is 2020 and Windows 8 has been replaced by Windows 10. The Windows 10 ISO is greater than 4GB and does not work on a FAT32 USB stick.\nIt is now much easier to make a bootable USB that will install both the latest Ubuntu and Windows, (and just about every other OS available).\nVentoy\nVentoy installs to a USB disk in less than a minute.\nAfter installation, most OS ISO's can be copy/pasted, dragged/dropped to the USB.\nNo further setup is required, (unless adding persistence, of which greater than 4GB is allowed).\nMS Windows installer disks can be be added.\nLinux OS can be added.\nFreeBSD, etc, etc can be added.\n90%+ distros in distrowatch.com are supported.\n550+ ISO files are tested.\nThere are versions for Windows and Linux.\nIt is simpler to use than Etcher.\nIt is open source.\nhttps://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html\nhttps://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy\n\nA: YUMI\nYUMI has many loyal users.\nIt appears that YUMI is still well supported.\nHave just tested the latest version YUMI-UEFI-0.0.2.7.\nPreformatted the USB to NTFS, started YUMI and installed Windows-1909 installation ISO.\nThen installed Ubuntu 20.04.1. (I think Windows should be installed first).\nBoth items installed and ran without problem. The NTFS USB worked in UEFI mode.\nNo work around was required as shown in a previous answer to this question.\nYUMI still lags Ventoy in that Persistence is limited to 4GB Max. Also YUMI still needs to be run each time a new ISO is added.\n", "Q: How to use zenity file selection I am new to zenity and I am trying to make a simple script for loading a file using zenity --file-selection and the wc command to get the word count of that file.

They are constantly adding and removing cars. When a new one comes in, they add a batch of images and the website generates a thumbnail for each. The site stores the base filename (through which I can access both thumbnail and original). Here's an example:\n5e1adcf7c9c1bcf8842c24f3bacbf169.jpg\n5e1adcf7c9c1bcf8842c24f3bacbf169_tn.jpg\n5e1de0c86e45f84b6d01af9066581e84.jpg\n5e1de0c86e45f84b6d01af9066581e84_tn.jpg\n5e2497180424aa0d5a61c42162b03fef.jpg\n5e2497180424aa0d5a61c42162b03fef_tn.jpg\n5e2728ac5eff260f20d4890fcafb1373.jpg\n5e2728ac5eff260f20d4890fcafb1373_tn.jpg\n\nThe problem comes after a product is removed. In my existing workflow, there isn't a simple way to remove old images. In a period of a few months we end up with 10,000 images, where only 10% are live.\nI can search the database and generate a list of live image stubs:\n5e1adcf7c9c1bcf8842c24f3bacbf169\n5e2497180424aa0d5a61c42162b03fef\n\nI want to delete the images that don't begin with these stubs.\nNote that time/space performance is an issue here too. There are ~500+ stubs at any one time. I have tried grepping ls like: \nls | grep -vf <(\n    sqlite3 database.sqlite3 'select replace(images, CHAR(124), CHAR(10)) from cars_car'\n)\n\nThis works but it's critically slow (and you shouldn't parse ls). The query is fast so it's the grep bit that bogs it all down. I'd like better solutions. Bash isn't necessary but it's what I do most of my maintenance scripting in.\n\nA: While writing the question, I started playing around with grep. Part of the performance problem is that grep is running a ton of regex searches for every file. These are expensive.\nWe can just do full-string searches without the regex, using the -F argument. \nfind | grep -vFf <(\n    sqlite3 database.sqlite3 'select replace(images, CHAR(124), CHAR(10)) from cars_car'\n) ### | xargs rm\n\nThe output is the same, and runs in 0.045s.\nThe old one took 14.211s.\n\nOne of the problems with parsing ls is the problematic filenames. muru's comment below highlights a pretty decent way of using null-characters through the entire pipeline.\nfind -print0 | grep -vzFf <(\n    sqlite3 database.sqlite3 'select replace(images, CHAR(124), CHAR(10)) from cars_car'\n) ### | xargs -0 rm\n\nThe reason I'm not switching my main answer to this is that I know my files will always be clean and that I've been running this into wc -l to make sure I'm seeing the correct number of files for deletion.\n\nA: I would guess it will be both simpler and faster to just use GLOBIGNORE (assuming your shell is bash anyway):\n   GLOBIGNORE\n          A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of filenames\n          to be ignored by pathname expansion.  If a filename matched by a\n          pathname expansion pattern also matches one of the  patterns  in\n          GLOBIGNORE, it is removed from the list of matches.\n\nSo, you could just read the patterns you want from your file, add a * to make them globs and convert into a colon separated list:\nGLOBIGNORE=$(sqlite3 database.sqlite3 'select images from cars_car;' |\n             sed 's/|/*:/g; s/$/*/')\n\nThen, you can just rm everything, and reset GLOBIGNORE (or just close the current terminal) :\nrm * && GLOBIGNORE=\"\"\n\nBecause GLOBIGNORE will now look like this:\n$ echo $GLOBIGNORE \n5e1adcf7c9c1bcf8842c24f3bacbf169*:5e2497180424aa0d5a61c42162b03fef*\n\nAny files matching those globs will not be included in the expansion of *. This has the added benefit of working with any type of file name, including those with spaces, newlines or other strange characters.\n\nA: If you are using bash as your shell, then shopt -s extglob can enable some more features in glob patterns. For example\n!(5e1adcf7c9c1bcf8842c24f3bacbf169*|5e2497180424aa0d5a61c42162b03fef*)\n\nwill match all names not starting with one of the two strings.\n\nA: When pure bash doesn't cut it (or gets unnecessarily awkward), it's time to switch to a proper scripting language.  My tool of choice is usually Perl, but you could use Python or Ruby or, heck, even PHP for this if you'd prefer.\nThat said, here's a simple Perl script that reads a list of prefixes from stdin (since you didn't specify exactly how you're obtaining this list), one per line, and deletes all files in the current directory with a .jpg suffix that don't have one of these prefixes:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\n\nmy @prefixes = <>;\nchomp @prefixes;\n# if you need to do any further input mangling, do it here\n\nmy $regex = join \"|\", map quotemeta, @prefixes;\n$regex = qr/^($regex)/;   # anchor the regex and precompile it\n\nforeach my $filename (<*.jpg>) {\n    next if $filename =~ $regex;\n    unlink $filename or warn \"Error deleting $filename: $!\\n\";\n}\n\nIf you'd prefer, you can compress that down to a one-liner, e.g.:\nperl -e '$re = \"^(\" . join(\"|\", map { chomp; \"\\Q$_\" } <>) . \")\"; unlink grep !/$re/, <*.jpg>'\n\n\nPs. In your case, since it's easy enough to extract the prefix from the file names, you could also use a hash instead of a regex to optimize the lookup, like this:\nmy %hash;\nundef @hash{@prefixes};   # fastest way to add keys to a hash\n\nforeach my $filename (<*.jpg>) {\n    my ($prefix) = ($filename =~ /^([0-9a-f]+)/);\n    next if exists $hash{$prefix};\n    unlink $filename or warn \"Error deleting $filename: $!\\n\";\n}\n\nHowever, even though this method scales better asymptotically (at least in practice; in theory, the regex engine could optimize the match to scale as well as the hash method), for just 500 prefixes there's no noticeable difference whatsoever.\nAt least on current Perl versions, however, the regex solution gets a lot slower once the number of alternatives exceeds a certain limit.  For 32-byte prefixes, my testing showed a massive jump in execution time when the number of alternatives reached 6553, but the exact threshold apparently also depends on the length of the prefixes and on what else, if anything, the regex contains.  This is apparently a quirk of the Perl regex engine and its optimizer, so other regex implementations (even PCRE ones) may exhibit different behavior.\n\nA: You could simply remove the images within the product removal script execution. This way the load will be balanced across each product removal over time. Additionally you won't have to worry about running a script to clean them up at all, and the whole application will be self-sufficient. Not to mention it would solve the space issue to this end.\nI have no idea about which DBMS you're using, nor about which scripting language you're using to manipulate it or about how your database structure looks like (no idea about the images' path as well), but for example, assuming MySQL as the DBMS, PHP as the scripting language and a Products table in a 1-to-many relationship with a Images table, with the images' path pointing to a img folder placed under the root directory, it would be something like this:\n<?php\n    // ...\n    $imgPath = $SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/img/';\n    $result = mysqli_query($link, \"SELECT Images.basename FROM Products, Images WHERE Products.productId = Images.productId AND Products.productId = $productId)\n    while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n        unlink($imgPath.$row['Images.basename'].'.jpg');\n        unlink($imgPath.$row['Images.basename'].'_tn.jpg');\n    }\n    // ...\n?>\n\nIf you're concerned about unlink() performances, you could always use:\n<?php\n    // ...\n    $imgPath = $SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/img/';\n    $result = mysqli_query($link, \"SELECT Images.basename FROM Products, Images WHERE Products.productId = Images.productId AND Products.productId = $productId)\n    while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n        shell_exec(\"rm {$imgPath}{$row['Images.basename']}*\");\n    }\n    // ...\n?>\n\nConcerns about these solution might be about the additional query you'll have to run each time, unless you're pulling from Images already before in the script and if that's a concern at all.\n\nA: The long term solution I'm erring towards is something at the end of my update script (Python/Django). I have a list of Car objects —so no more database querying— which makes this even faster. It also happens at the exact time old images cease being useful.\nI'm using a Python set because it's probably the fastest way of checking. Into that I'm adding all stubs of the images I want to keep, then I'm iterating through the thumbnails (easier to glob), and deleting the files that aren't in the set.\n# Generate a python \"set\" of image stubs\nimport itertools\nimagehashes = set(itertools.chain(*map(lambda c: c.images.split('|'), cars)))\n\n# Check which files aren't in the set and delete\nimport glob, os\nfor imhash in map(lambda i: i[25:-7], glob.glob('/path/to/images/*_tn.jpg')):\n    if imhash in imagehashes:\n        continue\n\n    os.remove('/path/to/images/%s_tn.jpg' % imhash)\n    os.remove('/path/to/images/%s.jpg' % imhash)\n\nThere are a few tricks with map and itertools to save a bit of time, but it's mostly self explanatory.\n\nA: \nThe query is fast so it's the grep bit that bogs it all down.\n\nAnother solution would be to simply invert the query, so that you can pipe the results to rm directly.\nThis shouldn't introduce any difference in timing at all.\n", "Q: ISC DHCP Different DNS Server For Different Client OS Is it possible to configure isc-dhcp in a way that it can send different DNS server addresses to different clients in the network? \nLet say I have some Macs, PCs with Linux and Windows in the network.

If you are worried that current version of YUMI isn't supported then download some older version (e. g. YUMI 2.0.1.2 ).\n1.2. If you don't have WINE installed and you would like to create USB for Linux OS then you can use Disk image writer. In previous versions of Ubuntu Unetbootin was the primary solution, but it doesn't do the job well in my 14.10. Instead I use Disk image writer which came pre-installed.\nThe procedure is simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*format your USB to FAT32 with MSDOS partition table and mount USB (as shown on picture in 1.3. No need to adjust the flags.)\n\n*right click on your ISO and select open with/ Disk image writer\n\n*select destination and click restore.\nThe only drawback is after this procedure USB will have messy file system, so you have to correct it afterwards. It will create a bootable USB no doubt, but it need to be formated for further use.\n\nAfter you're done with your OS installation and you would like to use your USB for something else then do this:\n-select sdc1 (black field) and unmount. Ignore the errors (GParted can't read filesystem properly).\n-change partition table (e. g. back to msdos)\n-open view/device information to see if it has been changed, if not simply repeat once again\n-format (e. g. FAT 32).\nTo install Clonezilla do not use Disk image writer:\n-format your USB to FAT32 with MSDOS partition table\n-right clik on image and select open with/Disk image mounter. You're image might not be visible in nautilus. Open Disks and mount it hitting play.\n\n-simply copy paste all files from ISO drive to USB (don't forget to pres CTRL+H for hidden files)\n-in Gparted manage flags and select boot (as shown on the picture in 1.3.).\n1.3. In case you want to create Windows USB then perhaps you should use WinUSB for previous versions of Ubuntu and for the current 14.10.\nBut actually, the GUI based solution would be interesting. It requires, ironically,  Unetbootin. That's right, all you need to do is to trick Unetbootin to install Windows ISO by changing the file system. I have tested it with Windows 7 x64.\nThis is the procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*format your USB to FAT32 and mount\n\n*open UNetbootin and prepare it to write, just before the installation, but don't install the ISO yet just leave it open\n\n*format your USB to NTFS, check if it has a boot flag in Gparted and mount USB\n\n\n*switch back to Unetbootin and press OK.\n\n\nIf Unetbootin during installation freeze do not be alarmed, it will take slightly more time to finish.\n\n2. GPT based systems\nThis should be a very easy task and ordinary issues occur due to poorly formated USB drive (it should look like this picture), but unfortunately the recommended solution - Startup disk creator failed for me in Ubuntu 14.10. Nevertheless, basically what you should do is this: \n\n\n*\n\n*create FAT32 formated USB with GPT partition table \n\n*copy all the files (including hidden) from ISO to USB. \n\nWhile this solution worked like a charm for Linux Mint, Clonezilla (read about mount problem in 1.2.) and Windows 8 copying files from Ubuntu and Kubuntu mounted ISO reported problems with symbolic links. Now, I have installed my Ubuntu using this method and have been using it for past 5 months.It is convenient because it is easy to set persistence. But you can play safe and use Disk image writer I already explained in 1.2. Of course your USB drive have to be formated GPT FAT32, as I already explained, but when Disk image writer finish it will have structure like on 1.2. picture.\n\n\nUPDATE:\nTo install Linux OS you can use Startup Disk Creator. It is simple and straightforward, but I find the application a little buggy. Since Ubuntu 15.04 it got updated so you can give it a try, but while creating Clonezilla USB some errors occured. The USB booted though.\n", "Q: Acer Aspire power management I'm working to fix my Acer Aspire One netbook so that power management is working.\nCurrently, it goes to \"suspend\" when either the lid is closed or it is idle.\nHowever, it must still be using significant power, if I open the lid after 24 hours it is dead (I have an extended 4-hour battery).\nI followed the steps in:\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/04/enable-hibernate-ubuntu-14-04/\nThat enabled the \"Hibernate\" option from the \"gear cog\" in the upper right corner, and that works.\nIt does not hibernate when the lid is closed.\nI got greedy and when editing \"logind.conf\"  I also tried changing:\n#IdleAction=ignore\n#IdleActionSec=30min\n\nto\n#IdleAction=hibernate\n#IdleActionSec=1min\n\n(I figured I'd test it, then change it back to 30 minutes... changed it back, still not working)\n1)  Any further suggestions to enable the computer to Hibernate when closing the lid and when left idle?\n\nA: *\n\n*Re-enable hibernate\n\n\n*\n\n*su\n\n*cd /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/\n\n*gedit com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla\n\n*Copy and paste below lines into the file and save it.\n\n[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\n[Re-enable hibernate by default in logind]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\n\n\n\n*Hibernate your laptop when lid is closed:\n\n\n*\n\n*su\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/systemd/logind.conf\n\n*In /etc/systemd/logind.conf look for HandleLidSwitch=suspend and change it to HandleLidSwitch=hibernate and save the file.\n\n*Restart your computer to apply changes or run sudo restart systemd-logind\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04 Synaptics Touchpad works on login screen, stops working after login The last thing I remember installing was Wine and some library (I'm new to linux and I've forgotten) and after I rebooted the touchpad would not work anymore.

I performed a clean install off a usb of 12.04 which I can confirm is fully functional from having used it without fuss to put 12.04 on my desktop. The computer gets to the purple splash screen and hangs so I have gone in through GRUB and it can load Ubuntu if I boot it through recovery mode although the resolution is locked at 800x600. The drivers are also misreporting as as Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 0x300). I have tried sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel which delivers the response that I am already running the latest version. I'm pretty much out of ideas at this point and way out of my depth. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I also have a ASUS X200m, but I'm running Ubuntu 14.04.  Had a similar issue which I have just resolved.  Updated to new kernel in February and as soon as I restarted, just got a black screen.  Had to connect external monitor and install GRUB customizer via PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nAnd set it to show the GRUB screen on each boot so that I could use an older kernel that functioned properly with my display.  I went through that for months asking the community for help...\nEnded up, last night, removing all but the newest and the functioning kernel, following instructions outlined here:\nRemove Old Kernels in Ubuntu\nToday I installed package the package linux-firmware-nonfree and\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nWhich updated my kernel once more and the package linux-firmware.\nRebooted and the newest kernel booted up with no display problems...\nNot sure which step did the trick but thought I should let you know.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I had the same problem, it's due to the graphics driver being broken in recent kernels. I found a work around that recommended installing the mainline kernel 3.11.5-saucy and booting that instead. It works but grub breaks every time so it's necessary to edit the grub file so that it boots by default to 3.11.5 and not another kernel.\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/?C=N;O=D\nDownload the kernel, unzip the directory and install using the dpkg command (dpkg -i) [dpkg -i filename]. Then sudo update-grub. (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/update-grub.8.html)\nAfterwards, you'll need elevated privileges, running as root. Copy the grub.cfg file, save it as another file name (e.g. grub-new.cfg), edit this grub-new file by removing all kernels listed except 3.11.5. Rename grub.cfg as something else (e.g. grub-original.cfg). Rename grub-new.cfg as grub.cfg. Then reboot the machine. It should work fine. Just beware that any kernel updates will break grub!\n", "Q: From WAN, VNC fails to connect through ssh 5900 tunnel if not also proxied locally On my local network, I can VNC-over-an-ssh-tunnel quite easily.  I wish to do the same from abroad.\nThe server is set up to accept WAN-side ssh connections, and this works reliably.  The problem is, when abroad I cannot start a successful VNC session over the ssh tunnel.  A similar tunneling setup is used when I do the same on my LAN (which works perfect).\nSo \"from over there,\" I can connect SSH, but when I try to connect VNC to 127.0.0.1, I get on UltraVNC: Connection failed - End of stream Possible causes - Another user is already listening on this ID - Bad connection\n...with whatever ports I may use.\nLuckily TightVNC provides some level of logging.

I then used a VNC client that allows a proxy connection, RealVNC VNC-Viewer, and pointed it at localhost port 1080 (type SOCKS 5).\nTHIS.  WORKS.  I am now sure my VNC session is secured, but only if I go through a local SOCKS proxy when I am abroad.  The down side is I can not use my favorite client UltraVNC Viewer.\nAlso, I do not understand what is going on; I am looking for an explanation.  Why doesn't the simple L5900 tunnel do the job from then WAN, when it does within the LAN?\n\nA: The problem here is the SSH tunnel setup in PuTTY.\nBased on a web tutorial, I set up my 5900 SHH tunnel with the LAN IP adress of the server 192.168.1.110, so it looked like L5900  192.168.1.110:5900 in PuTTY.  Target host was also 192.168.1.110.  As we know this worked fine.\nThen I configured my SSH session with PuTTY for use abroad.  Shame on me, I used the WAN IP in both the target host and the tunnel.  I now realize that when it received packets destined to port 5900, the OpenSSH server did as instructed - it forwarded them to my NAT router (or tried to, anyway, as the pointer was to a WAN address).\nThe sure way to configure PuTTY is to always use the LAN IP for the 5900 tunnel.  Better yet, as in my case the VNC server is on the same machine as the OpenSSH server, just use localhost for the tunnel, as in L5900  localhost:5900.\n", "Q: Wireless xbox360-like pad Can you please suggest a good wireless xbox-360 compatible pad (rechargeable via USB) which would work out of the box with Ubuntu 14.04+ and steam?\nCheers\n\nA: The wireless Xbox360 controller works in Linux, you just have to get the Xbox360 Wireless Receiver adapter (sold separately or bundle with the controller, depending on which version you pick). For USB recharging you also need the Play&Charge kit, which is sold separately, normally the controller just runs on AA batteries and can't be charged with a regular cable. Also note that Play&Charge cable is for recharging only, it doesn't transmit input data to the PC, the Wireless Receiver is always required for the wireless controller.\nXboxOne controller doesn't yet support wireless communication, but that might come in the future.

You can do this with a tool such as gparted from the Ubuntu live session.\nAlso, if you don't have much ram, you should not select \"try ubuntu\" before selecting install as this option eats allot of ram and a certain amount is needed for install. (For Lubuntu, you need at least 200mB of free ram to run the installation and running the desktop eats 700mB. Also, Lubuntu uses less ram compared to regular ubuntu.)

I first noticed that youtube videos weren't playing in firefox on my desktop a couple of days ago. Instead of playing, I'd get the message \"an error occured, please try again later.\" Even though I had the flash plugin for firefox and chrome installed from the ubuntu software center, flash had stopped working in firefox. However, it was still working in chromium. Today I only have access to my laptop, but I've just noticed that the flash plugin has stopped working in firefox. In Chromium, youtube videos will play, but the shockwave flash plugin for games has stopped working. I get an error message that shockwave flash has stopped responding.\nI'll also mention, since I'm unsure if it's related, that up until a day or so ago I was using a custom theme on my ubuntu desktop (numix), but after a software update I lost the ability to change the theme and my desktop had reverted back to the default theme (switching to gnome from unity allowed me to change the theme again, but in unity I was stuck with the default theme). It was at this time that I noticed flash had stopped working.\nI have tried updating both web browsers and reinstalling the flash plugin through the software center. I also tried installing flash directly from the flash website using the downloadable tar.gz file, but I'm not sure if I installed it correctly since I was trying to follow instructions I had found online on how to install a tar.gz.\nDoes anybody have any ideas as to how I can fix these issues?

I know that there are a few threads around trying to answer this question, but none of the answers are working for me, so here we go. I have an 8 gig microSD card that was being used as memory for my old android phone. The card was formatted using ClockWorkMod Recovery.\nWhile that phone was still working, I could write to the card by plugging the phone into my computer via USB. But I accidentally deleted the entire operating system off of that phone, and now I am trying to fix it. I don't want to accidentally ruin another microsd card, so I need to gain write access to this one.\nWhen I insert the microsd into my computer, I cannot write to it. It says that I am not the owner, even if I am running as root.

I am also not familiar with the 'b' flag above. In another thread, someone suggested using a Windows machine to fix it, but I don't have one around, and I already tried doing that through a VM and it did not work correctly. Common sense tells me that because the phone was able to write to the sdcard, it is not damaged, but rather configured in an irritating way.\nSo, any advice? This is driving me insane. I've tried all of the usual stuff, like gparted, remounting as read-write, the Ubuntu disc utility, editing mount options... etc. Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: This may work -- I recently helped my neighbor with a similar problem.  Although this could be a software issue, it may indeed be a hardware solution that solves your problem.  Look for a switch on the actual card and set it to the off/unlocked position, then reinsert it and you should be able to write to it as it will no longer be write protected (locked).\nRegardless of brand, look at this example which clearly explains what I just briefly summarized:\nmemory-card-is-write-protected\n\nA: Do you have access to a Mac or Windows computer? If you do, go to sdcard.org.\nhttps://www.sdcard.org/downloads/index.html, scroll to the bottom of the page and agree to the terms and your download will start.

Ruby\nRuby doesn't  come with Ubuntu by default, unlike C compiler and Python interpreter, but if you ever find yourself using it, the solution in Ruby would be this:\nruby -ne 'puts $_.split(\":\")' <<< \"$PATH\"\n\nAs suggested by 7stud (Thank you very much !) in the comments, this can also be shortened with \nruby -F: -ane 'puts $F' <<<$PATH\n\nand this way\nruby -0072 -ne 'puts chomp' <<<$PATH\n\n4. Alternative awk\nWe can utilize split() function to break down the line read into array, and use for-each loop to print out each item on separate line. \nawk '{split($0,arr,\":\"); for(var in arr) print arr[var]}' <<< $PATH\n\n\nA: Here's the equivalent in Go:\n$ cat path.go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    for _, p := range strings.Split(os.Getenv(\"PATH\"), \":\") {\n        fmt.Println(p)\n    }\n}\n\n$ go run path.go\n/usr/local/sbin\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/usr/bin\n/sbin\n/bin\n/usr/games\n/usr/local/games\n/snap/bin\n/home/nathan/.local/bin\n/home/nathan/go/bin\n\n\nA: Here are a few more approaches. I'm using a PATH with directories containing backslashes, spaces and even a new line to show that they should work with anything (except the cut one which fails on newlines):\n$ echo \"$PATH\"\n/bin:usr/bin/:/usr/local/bin:/some\\ horrible thing:/even \nnew lines\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Some Perl ways:\n$ perl -pe 's/:/\\n/g' <<<\"$PATH\"\n/bin\nusr/bin/\n/usr/local/bin\n/some\\ horrible thing\n/even \nnew lines\n\nThe -p means \"print every input line after applying the script given by -e\". The script is using the substitution operator (s/oldnew/) to replace all : with newlines.    \n$ perl -lne 'print for split /:/' <<<\"$PATH\"\n/bin\nusr/bin/\n/usr/local/bin\n/some\\ horrible thing\n/even \nnew lines\n\nThe -l adds a newline to each print call. Here, the script is splitting its input on : and then loops over each split element and prints it. \n$ perl -F: -ane '$\"=\"\\n\";print \"@F\"' <<<\"$PATH\"\n/bin\nusr/bin/\n/usr/local/bin\n/some\\ horrible thing\n/even \nnew lines\n\nThe -a makes perl behave like awk: it will split each of its input lines on the character given by -F (so :, here) and save the result in the array @F. The $\" is a special Perl variable, the \"list separator\", whose value is printed between each element of a printed list. So setting it to a newline will make print @list print each element of @list and then a newline. Here, we're using it to print @F. \n$ perl -F: -ane 'print join \"\\n\", @F' <<<\"$PATH\"\n/bin\nusr/bin/\n/usr/local/bin\n/some\\ horrible thing\n/even \nnew lines\n\nSame idea as above, just less golfed. Instead of using $\", we are explicitly joining the array with newlines and then printing.     \n\n*Simple grep with PCRE magic:\n$ grep -oP '(^|:)\\K[^:]+' <<<\"$PATH\"\n/bin\nusr/bin/\n/usr/local/bin\n/some\\ horrible thing\n/even \nnew lines\n\nThe -o makes grep print only the matching portion of each line, so each match is printed on a separate line. The -P enables Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE). The regex is looking for stretches of non-: ([^:]+) that follow either the beginning of the line (^) or a : character. The \\K is a PCRE trick that means \"discard anything matched before this point\" and is used here to avoid printing the : as well.     \n\n*And a cut solution (this one fails on newlines, but can deal with backslashes and spaces):\n$ cut -d: -f 1- --output-delimiter=$'\\n' <<<\"$PATH\"\n/bin\nusr/bin/\n/usr/local/bin\n/some\\ horrible thing\n/even \nnew lines\n\nThe options used are -d: which sets the input delimiter to :, -f 1- which means print all fields (from the 1st to the end) and --output-delimiter=$'\\n' which sets the, well, output delimiter. The $'\\n' is ANSI C quoting and is a way to print a newline character in the shell. \nIn all of the above examples, I am using bash's (and some other shells') here string (<<<) operator to pass a string as input to a program. So command <<<\"foo\" is equivalent to echo -n \"foo\" | command. Note that I am always quoting \"$PATH\", without the quotes, the shell would have eaten the newline character.  \n\n@7stud gave another approach in the comments that's just too good not to include:\n$ perl -0x3a -l012 -pe '' <<<\"$PATH\"\n\nThat's what's known as golfing. The -0 specifies the input record separator as an octal or hexadecimal number. This is what defines a \"line\" and its default value is \\n, a newline character. Here, we're setting it to a : which is x3a in hex (try printf '\\x3a\\n'). The -l does three things. First it removes the input record separator ($/) from the end of each line—effectively removing the : here—and second, it sets the output record separator ($\\) to whatever octal or hex value it is given (012 is \\n). If $\\ is defined, it is added to the end of each print call, so this will result in a newline appended to each print.\nThe -pe will print each input line after applying the script given by -e. Here there is no script because all the work is done by the option flags as described above!\n\nA: Through awk.\necho $PATH | awk -F: '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)print $i}'\n\nThrough python.\n$ echo $PATH | python3 -c 'import fileinput\nfor line in fileinput.input():\n    for i in line.split(\":\"):\n        print(i)'\n\nNote that Indentation is very important in python.\n\nA: We need more Java!\npublic class GetPathByLine {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        for (String p : System.getenv(\"PATH\").split(\":\")) {\n            System.out.println(p);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSave this to GetPathByLine.java, and compile using:\njavac GetPathByLine.java\n\nRun with:\njava GetPathByLine\n\n\n┌─[17:06:55]─[kazwolfe@BlackHawk]\n└──> ~ $ cat GetPathByLine.java \npublic class GetPathByLine {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        for (String p : System.getenv(\"PATH\").split(\":\")) {\n            System.out.println(p);\n        }\n    }\n}\n┌─[17:06:58]─[kazwolfe@BlackHawk]\n└──> ~ $ javac GetPathByLine.java \n┌─[17:07:02]─[kazwolfe@BlackHawk]\n└──> ~ $ java GetPathByLine \n/usr/local/sbin\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/usr/bin\n/sbin\n/bin\n/usr/games\n/usr/local/games\n/snap/bin\n\n\nA: Using IFS:\n(set -f; IFS=:; printf \"%s\\n\" $PATH)\n\nIFS holds the characters on which bash does splitting, so an IFS with : makes bash split the expansion of $PATH on :. printf loops the arguments over the format string until arguments are exhausted.\nWe need to disable globbing (wildcard expansion) using set -f so that wildcards in PATH directory names don't get expanded.\n\nA: I use Stephen Collyer's \"Bash Path Functions\" (see his article in Linux Journal). It permits me to use the \"colon separated list\" as a datatype in shell programming. For example, I can produce a list of all the directories in the current directory by:  \ndirs=\"\";for i in * ; do if [ -d $i ] ; then addpath -p dirs $i; fi; done  \n\nThen, listpath -p dirs produces a list.\n\nA: Explanation for @Cyrus answer \necho \"${PATH//:/$'\\n'}\"\n\nNotes:\nANSI-C Quoting - it explains $'some\\ntext'\nShell Parameter Expansion - it explains ${parameter/pattern/string}, If pattern begins with ‘/’, all matches of pattern are replaced with string.\nSo we have:\n\n\n*\n\n*a pattern /: which start with '/' to replace all matches\n\n*a string $'\\n' which is quoted with $'anytext' contraction to treat new line symbol (\\n).\n\n\nA: Using xargs:\nxargs -n1 -d: <<< $PATH\n\nFrom man xargs\n-n max-args\n          Use  at  most  max-args  arguments per command line.\n\n -d delim\n          Input  items  are terminated by the specified character.\n\n\nA: Probably the only way that hasn't been mentioned is the way i've been using it for years:\necho $PATH | tr \":\" \"\\n\"\nso, in your .profile or .bash_profile or whatever, you can add:\nalias path='echo $PATH | tr \":\" \"\\n\"'\n\nA: You can do this with any one of the following commands, which substitutes all occurrences of : with new lines \\n.\nsed:\n$ sed 's/:/\\n/g' <<< \"$PATH\"\n\ntr:\n$ tr ':' '\\n' <<< \"$PATH\"\n\npython:\n$ python -c 'import sys;print(sys.argv[1].replace(\":\",\"\\n\"))' \"$PATH\"\n\n\nA: Another AWK way is to treat each directory as a separate record, rather than as a separate field.\nawk 'BEGIN{RS=\":\"} {print $0}' <<<\"$PATH\"\n\nI find that syntax particularly intuitive. But, if you like, you can shorten it by making the print $0 implicit (it is the default action, and 1 evaluates to true, causing it to be done for every line):\nawk 'BEGIN{RS=\":\"} 1' <<<\"$PATH\"\n\nAWK's default input and output record separator is the newline (line break). By setting the input record separator (RS) to : before reading the input, AWK automatically parses a colon-deliminated $PATH into its constitutent directory names. AWK expands $0 to each whole record, the newline remains the output record separator, and no looping or gsub is needed.\nek@Io:~$ echo \"$PATH\"\n/home/ek/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin\nek@Io:~$ awk 'BEGIN{RS=\":\"} {print $0}' <<<\"$PATH\"\n/home/ek/bin\n/usr/local/sbin\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/usr/bin\n/sbin\n/bin\n/usr/games\n/usr/local/games\n/snap/bin\n\nAWK is often used to parse records into separate fields, but there's no need for that just to construct a list of directory names.\nThis works even for input containing blanks (spaces and tabs), even multiple consecutive blanks:\nek@Io:~$ awk 'BEGIN{RS=\":\"} {print $0}' <<<$'ab\\t\\t c:de    fg:h'\nab               c\nde    fg\nh\n\nThat is, unless you cause AWK to rebuild the record (see below), it's no problem to have spaces or tabs (the default field separators) in the input. Your PATH probably doesn't contain spaces on an Ubuntu system, but if it does, this will still work.\n\nIt's worth mentioning, as a side note, that AWK's ability to interpret a record as a collection of fields becomes useful for the related problem of constructing a table of directory components:\nek@Io:~$ awk -F/ 'BEGIN{RS=\":\"; OFS=\"\\t\"} {$1=$1; print $0}' <<<\"$PATH\"\n        home    ek      bin\n        usr     local   sbin\n        usr     local   bin\n        usr     sbin\n        usr     bin\n        sbin\n        bin\n        usr     games\n        usr     local   games\n        snap    bin\n\nThe curious $1=$1 assignment serves the purpose of forcing AWK to rebuild the record.\n(This is probably more useful for cases where additional processing is to be done on the components, than for the exact example shown of simply printing the table.)\n\nA: jq -Rr 'gsub(\":\";\"\\n\")' <<<$PATH\n\n\nA: \nHow to display the paths in $PATH separately\n\nThese are my preferred ways of doing this based on my respective use-cases and concerns about compatibility and resource usage.\ntr\nFirst, if you need a quick, easy to remember, and readable solution, just echo PATH and pipe it to translate (tr) to turn the colons into newlines:\necho $PATH | tr : \"\\n\"\n\nIt has the downside of using two processes because of the pipe, but if we're just hacking in a terminal, do we really care about that?\nBash's shell parameter expansion\nIf you want a fairly permanent solution in your .bashrc for interactive use, you can alias the following command to path, but the readability of this solution is questionable:\nalias path=\"echo \\\"${PATH//:/$'\\n'}\\\"\"\n\n\nIf pattern begins with ‘/’, all matches of pattern are replaced with string. Normally only the first match is replaced. \n\nThe above command substitutes the colon with newlines using Bash's Shell Parameter Expansion:\n${parameter/pattern/string}\n\nTo explain it:\n          # v--v---------delimiters, a'la sed\necho \"${PATH//:/$'\\n'}\"\n          #  ^^ ^^^^^----string, $ required to get newline character.\n          #   \\----------pattern, / required to substitute for *every* :.\n\nGood luck remembering this when you're just hacking on the command line, if you haven't aliased it, though.\nIFS, tested in Bash and Dash\nAlternatively, a fairly cross-compatible, readable, and understandable approach that doesn't rely on anything other than the shell is use the following function (I suggest in your .bashrc.)\nThe following function temporarily makes the Internal (or Input) Field Separator (IFS) a colon, and when an array is given to printf, it executes until the array is used up:\npath () {\n    local IFS=:\n    printf \"%s\\n\" ${PATH}\n    }\n\nThis method of function creation, IFS, and printf are provided for by posix, so it should work in most posix-like shells (especially Dash, which Ubuntu usually aliases as sh).\nPython\nShould you use Python for this? You could. This is the shortest Python command I can think of for this:\npython -c \"print('\\n'.join('${PATH}'.split(':')))\"\n\nor Python 3 only (and perhaps more readable?):\npython3 -c \"print(*'${PATH}'.split(':'), sep='\\n')\"\n\nThese should work in any usual shell environment as well, so long as you have Python.\n\nA: This solution is simpler than the Java, C, go and awk solutions:\n$ LPATH=$PATH wine cmd /c echo %LPATH::=$'\\n'% 2> /dev/null\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/local/sbin\n/usr/bin\n/usr/sbin\n\nHere's another great possibility:\n$ jrunscript -classpath /usr/share/java/bsh.jar -e 'print(java.lang.System.getenv(\"PATH\").replaceAll(\":\",\"\\n\"))'\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/local/sbin\n/usr/bin\n/usr/sbin\n\nThis would require some dependencies to be installed:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk-headless bsh\n\n\nA: This works in Git Bash for Windows:\npython -c \"import os; print os.environ['PATH'].replace(';', '\\n')\"\n\nIt breaks the lines nicely:\nc:\\Rtools\\mingw_32\\bin\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Intel\\MPI-RT\\4.1.3.045\\ia32\\bin\nC:\\Windows\\system32\nC:\\Windows\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\Wbem\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\\nC:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\vim\\vim74\n\n", "Q: How To Use an iPad as a Graphics Tablet?

How would I do this so that no space is used in my SSD? (other than files that have to be).\n\nA: All of your files will be save in your /home directory. One great thing about linux is that any folder in in the directory tree can be on an separate drive rather than on the same drives as the root directory. So to have your files on your HDD and your documents on your SDD you need to mount your HDD at \\home when you boot.\nThe easiest way to do this is to set up custom partitioning when you first install Ubuntu and select your HDD and give it the mount point /home.\nIf you already have ubuntu installed then you will have to copy the contents of home to the HDD, rename \\home to something else and then edit your fstab file to mount the HDD at \\home. Once you restart and everything works you will need to delete the renamed home directory.\nThis is a rather in depth process but there is a great ubuntu community wiki article detailing the whole process: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\n", "Q: Installing Windows7 after Ubuntu 14.04, other recommendations not working I know this questions has been asked hundreds if not thousands of times, and I've actually successfully done this before, but I've tried several things on this system, and nothing has worked yet.

I plan on installing several programs, including Steam, that will take up quite a bit of space, so I installed, formatted, and partitioned a 1 TB HDD. Is it possible to change the default installation path of programs, or possibly even on a program by program basis? An older similar post suggested mounting an additional harddrive or partion as /usr or as /usr/share, but I am not sure if this is relevant to my issue. Thanks in advance. \n\nA: Not sure about Ubuntu's programs, but with Steam you can specify another partition. When you go to install a game choose the drop down and choose create a new library on /boot then this will open where you can install to. Goto /media/YOURUSER/Your drive..folder. Then you can create a folder here and install games to it.\n\nA: Most of the programs you install in Ubuntu, with the package manager will go to somewhere under /usr. However, other locations will also take up considerable space (/var/lib, I'm looking at you!).\nSteam, however, is a different beast. Although some of it's libraries are installed under /usr, the bulk of it is installed somewhere else: ~/.local, which is under /home.\nMy suggestion would be to mount your HDD as /home.\nThis would solve your Steam problem and allow you to save lots of data in your home dir.\nIt's not as fast - admittedly, but how often is disk I/O the bottleneck when accessing the data under your user's home?\n", "Q: How can I make dropbox back up folders in my Home Folder like Music?

It just untars a large set of files on top of the filesystem you have. Since it knows (because it should be ro) the previous filesystem, this is simply a set of the files that have changed.\nSo you are gambling. Do the changes you have made cause side effects when this happens? In general, yes. In general, you will have modified some file in the / filesystem, and added software that depends on that change. When an OTA is installed, that change will be removed, and potentially replaced with a conflicting change. At this point, what happens next is unknowable, and certainly untested.\nSo, in practice, some apt-get installs will largely add software in parallel to the existing files, so will not be much impacted by an OTA. However, one file set will certainly be impacted - apt's own record keeping (OTA's deliver the records used in construction of the ro filesystem). So your system will lose the knowledge of what is there, and what is not.\nThis is the core danger with apt-get upgrade. It will always be performed with an incorrect database of what is on the device, so it cannot be guaranteed to succeed. As your additions become more complex, and as the underlying system makes major transitions (such as when the phones moved from Utopic to Vivid), apt-get run by hand will do the wrong thing.\nEvery OTA then becomes a gamble, until you perform a wipe & reinstall.\n\n\n*Your system will become slowly broken - see above.\n\n\nA: To be able to use \"apt-get\" in ubuntu-touch, for safety I suggest you use the function \"Enabling/ Disabling read-write mode\".\nOnce enabled the \"read-write mode\", this will disable Ubuntu system upgrades.\nHowerver you can restore automatic over-the-air updates by disabling the \"read-write mode\".\n\n\"By default the system is read-only.

Then hopefully when rebooting, the bios will recognize it as an external drive. If it works then just boot from it. \nAfterwords use the larger partitioned sector (70gb drive) to install the duel boot on. Here is a nice guide for this step. Make sure you remember the # of how much space you partitioned for duel booting.

Perhaps askubuntu is not the best place for this question, however, this pertains to all linux systems, including Ubuntu. After the Snowden leaks, a lot of people have questioned the integrity of RSA keys. Some claim that there is a backdoor in the RSA algorithm. If that is true, than virtually every server on the planet is at risk. Of course, there are DSA keys, but we are told that 1024 bit keys are no longer strong enough to offer reliable protection against today’s computing power. \nThe openssl library has many, many ciphers. OpenVPN can utilize quite a few of them, so why can't ssh use more than just RSA or DSA? And why are DSA keys limited to 1024 bits..? Shouldn't we be looking towards moving away from RSA, and towards a more secure cipher, that does not potentially have an NSA backdoor encoded in it? Another things I find odd is that when I generate a 4096 bit RSA key, it happens in seconds. But when I generate a 4096 bit GPG key, it can take quite a while. That tells me that maybe the randomness of RSA is not so random...?\nAm I missing something? It would appear to me that the entire Linux community is relying on a potentially insecure cipher for protection, myself included. Why aren't there more ciphers to choose from? What gives?\n\nA: *\n\n*This is definitely the wrong place for this question.\n\n*If you're concerned about the security of RSA, you might want to learn more about it, learn the math, or study openssh's implementation (http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/). This is much better than speculation.\n\n*Unlike with DES or AES, the idea of a \"Backdoor\" in RSA doesn't make sense.\n\n*You are now on an NSA list of people interested in very strong encryption, probably under your real name. If you really need to keep anything secret from them, be careful.\n\nA: DSA keys are limited to 1024 bits by design.\nNewer versions of SSH support ECDSA and ED25519.\nOpenSSH changed the Host default to ECDSA. Note, If you have a host in the known_hosts file, it will use that key rather than updating to ECDSA/ED25519 when the host starts offering that by default.\nAlso note that the signature algorithm and the cipher algorithm are two different items (one is usually a public key algorithm and the other is symmetric key algorithm).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 install boots on my pc, but not any others So recently I decided I'd start learning Linux, having 10+ years experience with Windows and feeling quite competent with that OS.

It's not a huge problem, but is the origin of your original problem: effectively, the UEFI boot partitions on the other computers in your lab didn't know about the Ubuntu boot loader as they are missing the necessary information from their boot partitions...  This has nothing to do with Ubuntu but is purely firmware related.\nThe solution to your original problem would have been something like this...\nHowever, in the mean time, you've run a boot repair which very probably saw a MBR partition and tried to repair that, instead of a GPT one...  So now neither Windows nor Ubuntu boot.  \nThe solution now would be to boot-repair Windows and by now you know more of the Windows 8 boot process (UEFI started with Windows 7 but was optional, with Windows 8 it's recommended and with Windows 10 it will be enforced) so you should have a better shot at re-installing Ubuntu in UEFI mode so it can boot on your machine and all the others in the lab.  ;-) \nLast piece of advice: If you're looking for an easy fix, make a BIOS-bootable Ubuntu install on the external HD, turn UEFI off and boot from BIOS whenever you need to clean stuff and turn UEFI back on after you've finished.

I'm trying to install ubuntu for my gaming desktop I am currently building. My current workplace is my laptop.

That way, it'll just boot when you move the HDs as contrarily to Windows, there are no drivers just modules and these are are built into the kernel, so all hardware supported by the kernel will just work out of the box!\nOnce the hard drive is in the new PC, install the proprietary software like graphics modules and ubuntu-restricted-addons...\n", "Q: Deleted Ubuntu Partion, stuck on grub2 I deleted my Ubuntu partition, and tried to boot a recovery drive, but I just get grub.

I fixed the problem by \n\n\n*\n\n*inserting a Boot Repair Utility live USB I made beforehand (but can be made from another device). This works beautifully even if you want to get rid of Ubuntu later. A note from Ubuntu: \n\n\n> It is recommended to install the ISO on a live-USB (eg via UnetBootin or LiliUSB or Universal USB Installer).

Thanks for your clear post. The documentation says that it MIGHT just work once you plug it it, not that it definitely will.\nAccording to the SANE website link, a backend is a driver. SANE is merely a collection of scanner drivers. You need a driver for your scanner so that your computer can 'talk' to it, SANE might give you that driver (automatically) so make sure it's installed and then give connecting the scanner another go:\nIf you don't know if you've got SANE, try installing it.

About inodes\nIn Ubuntu, each file and directory is a so-called inode. You can use df -i to check the number of inodes in use and available for all mounted filesystems.\nQuestion\nIf you create a new EXT4-partition, it uses the default number of inodes, which under normal conditions should be sufficient. However, if you run a system that produces millions of small files, how do you need to create a new EXT4 partition with an extra large number of inodes? What is the maximum?\nComments\n\n\n*\n\n*You can NOT change the number of available inodes AFTER the EXT4-partition has been created\n\n\nA: See the man page for mkfs.ext4.  \nman mkfs.ext4\n\nOption -N allows you to set the number of inodes created in the filesystem, and option -I allows you to increase their size (so they can handle more extended attributes of files).  Adjust to fit your situation when you create the filesystem.\n\nA: Using mkfs -t ext4 -N iNumberOfINodes /dev/XdY where iNumberOfINodes is a 32-bit number so the maximum possible number of inodes on any ext2/3/4 file system is 2^32-1, or 4,294,967,295 (~4 billion). \n\nA: It's always a trade off between inodes and block size.\n32-bit is the max, but the actual max depends on your disk/filesystem size divided by block size. Each file is at minimum one block. You can also specify the group size which determines how many blocks per inode. (i.e. bytes/inode)\nAll that will determine the number of inodes you can allocation for a particular disk size and block size.\nIt's also a trade off between performance versus file capacity.\nSmaller block size mean large files will be fragmented and require more I/O operations to load the file.\nIf you're gonna customize you need to read up or else you end up with a filesystem totally unsuitable for what you thought you wanted.\n", "Q: Boot repair disk shows nothing under \"Grub location\" I am running a dual boot with Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8.

I am using Ubuntu 14.10 with the Unity interface and the Ambiance theme. I like this theme, and any other theme I've tried was much worse for me. However, one thing that really bothers me with this particular theme (it's not like that in others) is that the menus are hardly readable, with very dark background and foreground colors.\nI would like to manually edit the CSS file(s) defining the theme and change the menu colors. Can anyone point me to the specific color definition (there are quite a few)?\nA solution using a fine-tuning tool might also be acceptable, though generally I prefer to get in there and do it myself.\nNote: I've read elsewhere that this might be a bug resulting from me also installing KDE. This doesn't seem to make sense, but even if that's really the case, uninstalling KDE is not an option as I sometimes use it too.\n\nA: Well it seems my problem was not with the theme files (as proven by the fact nothing changed when I replaced them with the files from a friend where everything was working normally), but in ~.config/gtk-3.0. Removing this directory solved the issue.\nUntil shown otherwise I'll assume menu colors can not be adjusted in the theme files. For posterity, please do add an answer regarding manually adjusting menu colors in theme files if you have one (and I'll accept it if it's good).\n\nA: I got the same issue after installing kde in parallel with ubuntu 14.04.

So, we need to use an actual telnet command rather than hack away at Firefox to make it work with 'telnet'.\n\nYou stated in comments you used to use PuTTY for telnet..  PuTTY actually exists in the repositories and you can use it.  This command installs it: sudo apt-get install putty\nYou would then run it from the dash panel on Unity.\n\nThere is also an available telnet program in the repositories, and it should be installed by default.  telnet gives you a telnet interface via the command line and ONLY the telnet interface (you run it from inside of the Terminal).  You can install it by sudo apt-get install telnet if your system says it is not installed.

(to get platform adaptability) So I know I can make a persistent LiveUSB whereby there would be anywhere up to 4GB (I think that's the max) of persistent storage for downloads, etc.\nI am asking the opposite, in a sense. I'd like to configure a USB install to have the platform adaptability that a Live OS offers while fully utilizing the 120GB of space I have.\nIn essence I'm hoping to have a boot up install that reconfigures most/all the hardware/drivers as necessary every boot as I'd like to be able to boot off of it on nearly any machine. (Within reason - they will all be 64-bit)\nThe biggest gripe with doing multi-platform booting is the video driver stuff. Sometimes the system I'm booting off of is AMD, sometimes Nvidia, sometimes Intel.\nAlternatively, a usable answer may be a way to better configure the LiveUSB setup for more storage utilization and customization.\n\nA: No problem whatsoever! (I've got a USB disk just like that but I've never tried anything but BIOS machines, as I rarely encounter UEFI machines and if I meet one, I put them in BIOS mode and revert back when I leave)\nProcedure is exceedingly simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy a decent USB 3.0 SLC USB disk. These are normally advertised as 200-300 Mbps USB 3.0 disks, but your mileage may vary. Read the specs  \nWhy? SLC is vastly superior in speed to MLC or TLC drives and lasts about 4-12 times longer.  This outweighs the cost of these things... (2-3 times as expensive as other \"fast\" USB disks, 3-4 times as expensive as a low-end one)\n\n*Use Lubuntu (in your case: 64-bit)\nWhy? Lubuntu is the most compatible of all of the Ubuntu family and you're not going to use this as a high-end server, so Lubuntu will be snazzy even on a 1GB USB 2.0 machine. I use the 32-bit version with PAE extensions forced as I run this thing on a variety of hardware (mainly to resurrect Windows machines, but I've been told already to wipe the F|@#§g Windows and install this nifty, fast, free OS!)\n\n*Install like you would install any other machine, but treat the SLC as a simple hard disk and install grub, swap, / and /home.\n\n*Optimise fstab as you would for an SSD drive\nWhy 3+4?  Obviously ;-) you basically have an SSD on a stick!\n\n*Set the sysctl.conf parameters as follows:\n# Prevent USB wear out due to excessive swap usage.\n# Only start swapping when the memory is 90% full\nvm.swappiness = 10\n\n# This percentage value controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim\n# the memory which is used for caching of directory and inode objects.\n#\n# At the default value of vfs_cache_pressure=100 the kernel will attempt to\n# reclaim dentries and inodes at a \"fair\" rate with respect to pagecache and\n# swapcache reclaim.  Decreasing vfs_cache_pressure causes the kernel to prefer\n# to retain dentry and inode caches.\n#\n# Basically, once something is swapped it's probably not immediately needed\n# any more, so increase the kernel's resistance a bit more trying to build up\n# a large cache again.\nvm.vfs_cache_pressure = 75\n\n# Good to improve sequential reads (stop stuttering background music)\n# Can also be implemented per disk using udev rules\n# in KB, so only 3MB lost, so who cares nowadays?\nvm.max-readahead=2048\nvm.min-readahead=1024\n\nWhy?  Read the comments above...\n\n*Install as many command-line tools as you want, but stay away from huge memory-hungry programs as you won't know what kind of machine you'll be running this on.  (OK: I confess: I've got LibreOffice running, but that's about it.  Nu MySQL, no GIMP, no 3D-rendering, ...)\n\n*Stay away from any proprietary modules (aka drivers), just standard Linux kernel modules... And these are extremely good at adapting to their environment! They're like mongrels: they'll eat anything, drink anything and ... well, whatever. ;-) It just works!\nThat's it!\n", "Q: BQ Ubuntu Phone - How do I set media to save on a Micro SD storage card?

But they're terminal multiplexers, which allow you to start concurrent shells from within byobu, and allow you to 'tab' between them.  This alone would solve your issue, but digging a little deeper into their other features may also benefit your workflow - eg, split-panes allowing you to, for example, examine running-config on two routers side-by-side, rather than flicking between them.\n", "Q: How can I change Calendar's Language and adjust Time and its Format?

I get through the installer to the point where it tries to create the partitions.  The first attempt I just told it to \"Use Entire Disk\", so the installer would just make it's own partitions, but this complained about the NewWorld partition was missing.  So, then after MUCH struggle with getting rid of the LVM partitions the first \"Use Entire Disk\" option created, I made a partition for NewWorld as the first partition, then remade the same partitions the installer did, but this time it complained that the partitions were overlapping.\nNext I booted to a PPC Gentoo disk I had made.  Used it to recreate the partitions using mac-fdisk, such that the Apple and bootstrap partitions were back in partitions 1 and 2.  Then booted back to Ubuntu installer.  This time I did a manual partition, created a NewWorld partition followed by a /boot, sway, and /.  Marked both the /boot and the / to format, but when I try to go to the next steps I get the following errors:\n\n\n*\n\n*The file system on /dev/sda3 assigned to / has not been marked for fomatting (it has been, I triple-quadruple checked it!)\n\n*If I then pick No, I get: The installer needs to remove operating system files from the target, but was unable to do so.

To do so, I want to use ssmtp with an external mailserver, inside the network, that doesn't need any authentication. Meaning there is a smtp-server (external-server.com:25) on another host, which I want to use to send mails. Since my host and the smtp-server are in the same network I can access the smtp-server without any authentication.\nTherefore I configured ssmtp to use that external server, here is my ssmtp.conf:\n#\n# Config file for sSMTP sendmail\n#\n# The person who gets all mail for userids < 1000\n# Make this empty to disable rewriting.\nroot=devnull@external-server.com\n\n# The place where the mail goes.

I can't expand further as I have neither the hardware nor the dropbox account required. The solution was tested and confirmed by @Mitch who could likely do a better job of filling in the blanks.\nI can confirm that the patch works perfectly.  I have a Lenovo G50-30 laptop, that I installed the patch on.  If for some reason you can't get the patch from the above link, you can also download it from here.  \nIts in the form of a zip file, and once you download it, more likely to the downloads folder, go ahead, and right click on it, and choose Extract Here.  What that will do is create a new folder called 3.16.0-33.44 inside the Downloads folder, then just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, navigate to the folder where you un-zipped the file, and run the command(s) below:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nOnce the installation is done, go ahead, and reboot. \nI have rebooted multiple times, and ran an update, and everything works the way it should.  \n\nA: Disclaimer: I do not have the laptop in question, so I can't test it.

In there, there is often a configuration option for waking from suspend. You should change it to something that would probably work, like 'enable suspend' or similar. Hopefully this works, some motherboards override the OS when it comes it waking up.\nBe careful, though, don't brick your computer!\n\nA: Its your graphics driver.

I've downloaded the 32-bit and 64-bit current and past version, as well as tried torrent installations. The .iso files install perfectly in VirtualBox, as well as an old HP Pavilion laptop. When I burn the .iso to DVD, the file structure appears, REFit and REFind detect a generic Linux DVD, as well as a \"Windows\" DVD.\nBut here's the trouble:\nThe installation process never begins, always ending with a black screen and the message \"No operating system found.\" The DVD is not booted when depressing the \"C\". \nI'm wondering if there is a problem with the external LG M-DISC Super Multi USB DVD drive I'm using on the iMac. Months ago, I was able to install Lubuntu on the iMac using an LG slimline USB DVD drive. I replaced the slimline because it would not recognize OS X 10.6 or 10.7.\nBecause the installer boots on the Windows machine as well as the virtual box, but not the iMac's external DVD drive, is there a problem with Linux discs booting on this particular LG drive?\n\nA: I'm in the same boat. You need to do a few things:\nIt helps to use the mac modifications from this site:\nhttps://mattgadient.com/linux-dvd-images-and-how-to-for-32-bit-efi-macs-late-2006-models/\nOnce you boot from the DVD, push F6 and select \"no acpi\".

I used Archive Manager to extract files from an archive, but there wasn't enough free disk space. After the process crashed my disk remained full and I am unable to locate and delete what is filling up my hard drive. I cleaned up some disk space by moving some files to an external drive and then I attempted the same operation again. This time it succeeded, but again temporary files remained, clogging my hard drive. Where does this app store these files? I have been unable to find them in every way I have tried so far. I am also a complete newbie to Ubuntu (I use 14.10). Any help will be much appreciated.\n\nA: You can try to clean file-roller temporal folders with this command:\nrm -r ~/.cache/.fr-*\n\nThe above command will delete all the file-roller temporary folders that can remain. Be careful and copy/paste! A typo can be fatal for your data!\nThe temporary folders of file-roller (it creates one for each archiver while contents are open) are stored in /home/$USER/.cache/.fr-somerandomcharacters.\n\nA: Temporary files are usually stored in /tmp, and that's the case even for Archive Manager. Anyway it's not a good practice to batch remove them, since running applications might be using the folder to store temporary files necessary to their current instance to run (as it's the case for Archive Manager), and removing them could break the current instance. So you better either remove the files manually or just reboot, which automatically clears the folder.\n\nA: Thanks you for all your answers. The files were not located in the temp or cache folders, so at the end I installed bleachbit and ran every possible cleanup option that I thought might help. At the end I parted with almost 9000 files and 5.5gb of data so I assume the files I was after are in that mix. Fortunately, the system is still runing fine after all that.

Use xsetwacom list to find name of your stylus, in my case output of command is:\nWacom Intuos S Pad pad              id: 15  type: PAD       \nWacom Intuos S Pen stylus           id: 16  type: STYLUS    \nWacom Intuos S Pen eraser           id: 17  type: ERASER    \nWacom Intuos S Pen cursor           id: 18  type: CURSOR\n\nStylus is \"Wacom Intuos S Pen stylus\".\nDEVICE_STYLUS='Wacom Intuos S Pen stylus'\nxsetwacom set \"$DEVICE_STYLUS\" Button 1 \"button +0\" # nothing on touch\nxsetwacom set \"$DEVICE_STYLUS\" Button 2 \"button +1\" # left click on lower button\nxsetwacom set \"$DEVICE_STYLUS\" Button 3 \"button +3\" # right click on upper button\n\nThat's it, Button 1 of stylus is touching of pad, not real button. Script above disables this action.\nLower button is Button 2, assign left click to it.\nUpper button is Button 3, you may want to assign right click to it or something else.\nIf you have more buttons you can assign additional actions to them. Note that pad buttons belong to pad device, not stylus.\nSettings of xsetwacom are not persisted after system reboot, so you may want to write small script and run it manually or automatically after boot.\nReconnection of pad also resets settings to their defaults, you can play around and then reset.\nYou can check all current settings of each device like this:\nxsetwacom -s get \"$DEVICE_STYLUS\" all\n\nIt may be very helpful to check which options can be changed for concrete device.

I also know the exact memory location to write to 7000c400 in hex. I need to replace 4 bytes there, is there any method which may help me achieve this.\nEdit: What i am trying to achieve by attempting this?\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a Jetson-TK1 board, and an i2c bus is set to a default of 400kHz, but i want to run it at 100kHz. I think i can do that by changing device tree structure and recompilation, but recompilation is a lot bigger headache, as the kernel i am using is not a standard one (nvidia doesn't provide that).\nI had read somewhere that in Linux almost everything is in the form of a file. So looking for it, i found a file which contains 4 bytes which evaluates to 400000, I think changing this file would change the frequency.\n\n*Now the real problem is i was unable to change it (i think i am a decent enough user and as far as i understand, if there is something in memory and i have all kinds of passwords, i should be able to change it. That fact that i mess up something is not the question). I tried all possible methods known to me (as i have added in the question). So how do i do that.\n\nA: I looked into this mostly for fun and for learning (and hopefully for the rep!). I wish I could have some more time to play with ioctl (thanks to Sneetsher for the suggestion) and with what I've done so far in order to make a more elegant solution, but the bounty is about to expire and it's not likely that I can make everything in time, so I'm posting this solution \"as it is\" (at least for now).\nDisclaimer:\nI don't know which are the consequences of changing something into /proc/device-tree, so if you really know what you're doing, keep reading.\nThis particular implementation of this solution requires a running kernel > 3.10.

It returns data if you read the file, set data if you write to the file. And if there is no write function defined for a specific file, writing to the file won't change anything.\nIn this case the /proc/device-tree is a way to read the device tree provided to the \nrunning kernel while its boot. (no write enable)\nMoreover, currently, the device tree is a read-only configuration, you cannot update it after the boot. \nAnd for your specific case, the values configuring your i2c are read and used when the i2c is probed ('installed').\nIf you want to reconfigure i2c, you need as said joshumax, to use the correct ioctl on the i2c device (in /dev/ where some specific \"driver entry\" are defined)\nOne other solution is to build a new device tree, configuring the I2C device as you want. And ask the kernel (check the bootloader you are using) to use the device tree you just compiled.\n\nA: You’ll need rootly powers use sudo for that. \nTry this: you can use gdb (GNU Debugger) running as root to manipulate contents of memory.\nThese may interest you:\nhttp://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/3305164/how-to-modify-memory-contents-using-gdb\n", "Q: An adware has infected 2 browsers A weird adware is popping up every time I open a .com website and shows ad or redirects the page.\nIn chrome, I'm not even able to open an ordinary .com page because it immediately redirects to somewhere else.  \nI've reset Firefox, even purged and reinstalled it but the problem's not solved.\nThis is one screenshot of mine, you see the adware at bottom-right corner.\nI'm using Kubuntu 14.04 with firefox 36.  \n\n\n\n\nA: 1.\nMaybe try to remove your personal files (or backup them first if you need to).

CUDA 7 requires the 346 driver. I didn't install the driver which came with the CUDA toolkit. I installed the open source driver from xorg. \nAfter I install the driver, CUDA toolkit and CUDA samples, CUDA seems to work fine. I ran the executable deviceQuery which is part of the CUDA samples and it runs showing me the specs for my GPU (GT 750M) and its CUDA capabilities.\nBut when I check if the driver is used by going to System Settings -> Software and Updates -> Additional Drivers, the driver being used is the nouveau driver from Xorg. There isn't even an option to switch to the 346 driver (there is to 331, 331-updates and 340)\nWhen I check if the driver is part of the kernel through lsmod | grep nvidia I can see a module with the name nvidia. \nWhen I run nvidia-detector it returns none\nWhen I run 'nvidia-smi` the output is \nDo I have to blacklist or remove nouveau ? Or how do I get the 346 driver to work?\n\nA: I figured out what was going on. The nouveau driver uses the 346 proprietary driver binary. So essentially everytime the newer driver is released the Nouveau \"driver\" uses whatever the most recent one and repackages itself. \n", "Q: Run a multi-line script in Screen I want to run this script in a screen:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile true\ndo\n    java -server -Xms2G -Xmx2G -jar craftbukkit.jar\n    echo \"If you want to completely stop the server process now, press Ctrl+C before the time is up!\"\n    echo \"Rebooting in:\"\n    for i in 5 4 3 2 1\n    do\n        echo \"$i...\"\n        sleep 1\n    done\n    echo \"Rebooting now!\"\ndone\n\nHow do I do this?\n(Script is for a Minecraft server.

When I run sudo apt-get update I notice\nThe following packages have been kept back:\n  libgbm1 xorg\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded.  \n\nHow do I get these to upgrade?\n\nA: This is, very simply, a mis-use of sudo on your part.  The redirection in the command\nsudo gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders > /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders.cache\n\nis enacted by the shell and happens before the sudo command is executed with superuser permissions.  So the shell tells you that permission is denied when attempting to overwrite the contents of /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders.cache because it is to you, the unprivileged user doing redirection in xyr unprivileged shell.\nThe correct ways to enact the fix that the message is giving are:\n\n\n*\n\n*To do this in a superuser shell.\n\n*To quote the redirection and pass it to a secondary, privileged process, shell:\nsudo sh -c 'gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders > /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders.cache'\n\nFor what it's worth, the underlying cause of this problem is reportedly an error in the \"maintainer scripts\" for the gdk-pixbuf package that causes it to delete the cache file partway through the upgrade process.  This error has persisted through several Ubuntu versions.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*When using sudo with redirection, I get 'permission denied'\n\n*https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=625203#40\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdk-pixbuf/+bug/1282294/comments/7\n", "Q: How can I resize partition to utilize the extra space in Gparted I have booted with \"Parted Magic ISO\" to see my hard drive.

I have an old laptop Dell Precision M4300, with Intel Core 2 Duo T9300 2.50GHz, 3,50 Gb RAM, HD IDE 150Gb.\nI have it with XP, the pc is working very good but I feel unsafe still using it with this OS.\nI read in in the official Ubuntu site that the minimun requirements that this PC have will work good with Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS, but they advice that with IDE HD it could be slow, so they suggest to use Xubuntu or Lubuntu.\nI used both of them in older compuyters but I am not very happy with them, I would like to have Ubuntu latest version if possible.\nAs your experience, Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS will work well in this Dell Precision M4300 that I described?\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: Yes. Your computer will work \"well\" with Ubuntu 14.04.2 but it mostly depends on what you expect as a definition for the words: \"work well\".\nI own a Lenovo Thinkpad T400 which has an Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU P8600  @ 2.40GHz, 3 GB RAM and 160 GB HDD and I can work with the majority of the tasks I have to face for the day to day work and let's have in consideration that what I do for a living (nowadays) includes (but not limits only to):\n\n\n*\n\n*HTML/CSS/Javascript coding via Aptana Studio 3\n\n*Wordpress deployment via LAMP\n\n*Graphic design with GIMP and Krita, sometimes Inkscape\n\n*Photography retouch with Darktable\n\n*Audio mastering/authoring with Audacity, Linux Multimedia Studio\n(lmms) and other tools.\n\n*Electronic Music creation (like those mentioned on\nhttp://geppettvs.x10.mx/la-musica/) with the previously mentioned\ntools.\n\n*Video Edition with OpenShot and KDEnlive. (Samples here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/geppettvs/videos)\n\n*DVD Authoring with DVD Styler\n\n*And some other useful things.\n\n\nOf course I cannot multi-task with this computer, not beyond 4 or 5 of these software running at once. And audio renders are yet good for high quality audio but... Let's face it. HD Video editing is a nightmare. Specially when we include a lot of transitions, layers, sound effects, video processing, etc.\nBut... Look at this! \n\nAt this very moment I am writing this with 11 tabs open in my Firefox instance, a terminal (idle), playing music via radiotray, haguichi doing its magic for a VPN, bluetooth enabled and I experience no issues at all.\nMy desktop environment -nevertheless- was changed from a fully eye-candy decorated Unity (2D or Normal) to a i3 Tiling Window Manager (https://i3wm.org/) which improves the overall speed when it is about productivity. For eye-candy and to impress your friends you may wish a fancier desktop environment like Unity or KDE and probably the usage of Compiz but they're high resource hungry, so I won't recommend to use it in a computer like this.\nFor what is about the IDE HDD, I would just say that if the HDD is in good condition you may yet find it fast enough to do everything I mentioned over here.\nBut, that's my own experience.

I copied the file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf. I then changed the line \"MatchDriver \"synaptics\"\" with \"Option \"ClickPad\" \"on\"\" and the line \"Option \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"50% 0 82% 0 0 0 0 0\" with \"Option \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"50% 0 50% 0 0 0 0 0\".

I'm not really familiar with regex, sed, etc. and a bit lazy to figure it out right this moment, so how do I extract this line:\n<yweather:astronomy sunrise=\"6:50 am\" sunset=\"7:06 pm\"/>\n\nLet me know if more of the xml structure is needed.\n\nA: Since the input data (your XML file) is structured, you're better off using a query on that structured data, rather than treating it as plain text and messing with regular expressions.\nWe can use xmllint --xpath to evaluate an XPath expression on your xml input:\n$ xmllint --xpath 'string(rss/channel/*[local-name()=\"astronomy\"]/@sunrise)' weather.xml\n6:48 am\n\n- this is a little convoluted, as we have to deal with the different namespaces in that file, but works nonetheless.\nFor more information about XPath, the specification is at http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/\n\nA: You don't use regex or sed. You use an XML parser and an XML query language (XPath or XQuery). And I'm afraid the details do depend on context: for example, \"yweather\" is a short name (prefix) for a namespace, and you need to know what namespace it represents.\n\nA: The correct answer, as Michael Kay says, is to use an XML-specific tool.\nFor a quick and dirty solution, here is a sed approach.  Let's start with this file:\n$ cat file\n<yweather:astronomy sunrise=\"6:50 am\" sunset=\"7:06 pm\"/>\n\nTo extract sunset time:\n$ sed -rn 's/.*sunset=\"([^\"]*)\".*/\\1/p' file\n7:06 pm\n\nTo understand the regex, let's break it into three parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*.* matches from the beginning of the line up until the second part\n\n*This part, sunset=\"([^\"]*)\", matches the characters sunset=\", followed by any number of characters except \", followed by the closing \".  The expression [^\"] means any character except \" and [^\"]* means any number of such characters. The parens, (...), captures the characters inside the \"...\" into sed's group 1 which we later reference as \\1.\n\n*.*  matches all the characters after the sunset expression.\n\nA: I will give same answer of Jeremy Kerr but giving it an xml in example.\nWe have an xml file called config.xml in out root folder, and we want to read a attribute or a property of a tag, let it be the widget tag.\nconfig.xml:\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\n<widget android-versionCode=\"16\" id=\"co.app.world\" ios-CFBundleVersion=\"0.1.3\" version=\"3.0.5\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets\" xmlns:cdv=\"http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0\">\n    <name>AppName</name>\n    <description>Description.</description>\n    <author email=\"hi@ionicframework\" href=\"http://ionicframework.com/\">Ionic Framework Team</author>\n</widget>\n\nWe want to get the android-versionCode property value, we type this in the terminal:\nxmllint --xpath \"string(//*[local-name()='widget']/@android-versionCode)\" config.xml\n\nOutput:\n16\n\nExplanation: we use /*[local-name()='widget'] to map the widget tag, and then @android-versionCode to read the property of this.\n", "Q: Blackscreen - failed to idle channel I've just installed Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 LTS and everything was working fine.\nBut suddenly it freezes and then goes blackscreen, and displays this:\n* Stopping System V runlevel compatibility\n* Stopping save kernel messages\n* Starting crash report submission daemon\n[  797.944847] nouveau E[Xorg[1052]] failed to idle channel 0xcccc0000 [Xorg[1052]]\n[  812.930255] nouveau E[Xorg[1052]] failed to idle channel 0xcccc0000 [Xorg[1052]]\n[  827.971609] nouveau E[gnome-shell[1911]] failed to idle channel 0xcccc0000 E[gnome-shell[1911]]\n[  842.957016] nouveau E[gnome-shell[1911]] failed to idle channel 0xcccc0000 E[gnome-shell[1911]]\n[ 1304.084012] nouveau E[Xorg[3342]] failed to idle channel 0xcccc0000 [Xorg[3342]]\n[ 1319.069420] nouveau E[Xorg[3342]] failed to idle channel 0xcccc0000 [Xorg[3342]]\n[ 1334.110775] nouveau E[gnome-shell[3923]] failed to idle channel 0xcccc0000 E[gnome-shell[3923]]\n[ 1349.096181] nouveau E[gnome-shell[3923]] failed to idle channel 0xcccc0000 E[gnome-shell[3923]]\n[ 1349.096294] nouveau E[   PFIFO][0000:01:00.0] read fault at 0x0000013000 [PTE] from PBDMA0/HOST_CPU on channel 0x021f894000 [unknown]\n\nAnd then, after some time, i'm asked to login, or it just displays weird patterns and does nothing.\nThis is happening more and more often.\nDo you have and ideas how can i fix this?\n\nA: Now everything is working.\nMy solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run software-properties-gtk --open-tab=4\n\n*Under NVIDIA Corporation: ... select NVIDIA binary driver instead of Server X\n\n\n*Click Apply\n\n\nA: Those of us accustomed to a graphical user interface and allergic to text can choose System Settings > System > Software & Updates > Additional Drivers.\nThen we need to wait a couple of minute for the page to update.\nUnder 14.01 I was offered two options for NVidia legacy drivers under three different menu entries.

Furthermore, you can't use an NTFS volume as your Linux root (/) filesystem. If you want to access your Windows partition from Linux, you must give it some other mount point, such as /mnt/windows.

Is it at all possible to install Ubuntu touch or a more relevant Ubuntu operating system on a Sony xperia c1905 with android 4.3?\nThe intention being to fully reformat to Ubuntu.\nWill I have full functionality?\nAre there simple instructions for non-experts?\nWhat might be common problems with installations?\nOr is it not recommended as yet?\nMany thanks in advance, and apologies if this has already been asked elsewhere, please post a link if so.\n\nA: Having just rooted a Xperia z, I know 4.3 can be rooted so you can put a different os on your phone from there.\nHaving said that only the nexus 4,5,7 and 10 are officially supported by ubuntu touch.\nUnofficially a few Sony models have ports available you can get the full list here (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices) \nAnd at the bottom of the wiki you will see a link to xda which is the best place to find out if your device has a current working (unofficial) port. The last update for the Xperia z model was in 2013 so I'm not sure if you'll be able to.\nHope this helps in some way, I've typed this on my mobiles Web browser so sorry for any typos etc..\n", "Q: How to reuse ubuntu (installed on USB HDD) on another computer? I have installed Ubuntu on the USB HDD and successfully used it on my old notebook(acer). After purchasing the new computer(asus), i can't load my Ubuntu. Following the grub load screen i got black screen. Any way, i successfully launched Ubuntu in recovery mode without wireless drivers, but it doesn't look like a solution. Can anyone help me in my problem? \n\nA: You probably have a video issue on the new PC.  Boot the USB, then switch to one of the virtual terminals with ctrl alt Fn1 (or function keys 2 through 6 should work too). Look at the modules with:\nlsmod | sort\n\nand see what proprietary video drivers you are using, and remove them with:\nsudo apt-get purge <the proprietary video driver>\n\nSee if rebooting gets you to a working video, maybe add \"nomodeset\" to the grub command that starts with \"linux\"\nAdd any new proprietary video (wireless gets the same treatment) drivers.  \n\nWith the same video chips, and it working in recovery mode, may be an X problem.  Look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log (or others with higher numbers) for any errors. Does the guest session work?  If so, maybe some config problem down in your .config directory.\n", "Q: How to run automatically Docky at lubuntu? in general: How can I make an application automatically start when I have logged in?\n\nA: This is incredibly easy to do:\nRight-click on the left-most icon on the Docky launcher, and click Settings.

I have a 40GB hard drive with 26GB free with a single partition with an ntfs file system that I want to install Ubuntu 14.04.2 on.\nIf I resize the windows partition for the installation, will the partition erase my data?\nEDIT: The hard drive has no OS on it.\nEDIT: Solved, I partitioned the hard-drive into two 20GB partitions and successfully installed Ubuntu without losing any data.\n\nA: Resizing a hard-drive would not cause data loss. But 40GB hard drive is not meant to be shrinked so as to install another OS. I assume you are a Windows XP or Windows 7 user. \nWindows would require free space so as to accommodate  new programs, page file changes if any etc.\nHence, I request you to think again before you proceed toward installing Ubuntu.\n\nA: I have broken a system by shrinking the Windows partition using Linux tools. (I asked about it in this question.) \nBased on my experience, I would advise shrinking the Windows partition using Windows tools, then moving over to the installer.\nThat said, this is a mighty small drive you are working with, and you may run into trouble because of that.\n\nA: You'll only lose data if you shrink the partition too far. Use the Windows partitioning tools to shrink the partition a safe amount. Doing this manually with a such limited space is dangerous. How to do this:\nClick on your start menu and type in \"defragment\". A tool for this will appear. Select it, and defragment your hard drive (this is to get the maximum amount of space). After that finishes, go to the start menu again, and type in \"disk management\" and choose the Disk Management tool. Right click on your largest partition (which should be C:), and choose \"Shrink Partition\". Windows will fill in a safe amount, but you can make it less. After it finishes, you will have more free space on your drive for Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How can I avoid entering my password for everything? Its getting really annoying having to use my password for everything from opening my internet browser, to doing anything in the terminal, to installing any sort of software etc. Is there a way to disable this? I feel like everytime I sneeze I need to put in my password first. I tried changing it to nothing and then to another variation of my password to make it easier to use (since I'm putting it in all the time) and now some programs/actions require the older password and some require the new one. Its really confusing and its making everything a hassle. Is there a way to disable this or even just make it to where I know for sure which password it wants me to use?\nThanks for any future responses. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: You don't have to enter your password for everything. Either your installation is severely broken somehow, or (more likely) you're not using it correctly.\nConsider running ls in the terminal. You don't need your password for this. Do you always run it as sudo ls? Don't do this. If running ls without sudo fails, paste the result of running sudo ls -l /bin/ls here.\n\nA: Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems handle permissions very tightly. If you launch applications from your terminal constantly, you can switch your permissions to superuser with this command: sudo su Note that this shouldn't be used as a be-all-end-all command. Software launched with root permissions can alter your system without asking for additional permissions. Don't launch your web browser as superuser, for example.\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu compatible with the hp spectre x360? I just bought the new hp spectre x360 dual-core i7, 8 GB ram and 256 SSD. Will Ubuntu run on this computer without issue or is it not yet supported?\n\nA: I have tried Ubuntu 14.04.02 via a USB stick on my Spectre x360 (8Gb RAM Intel 5200). As mentioned, secure boot needs to be disabled.\nWorks without any additional steps: touchscreen, trackpad, windows keys, WIFI, USB, bluetooth, networking, SD card.\nNot working: On board sound. HDMI audio is detected, but no other audio device. (So no speakers and nothing out of the headphone out).\n\nA: EDIT: On recent Arch based Linux it works out of the box (Manjaro & Antergos): as of june 2017 at least\nJust installed Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS on an HP Spectre 360.\nAll worked great out of the box, except... the sound.\nI changed the kernel version to 4.0.9-040009-generic (but I don't think it really helped). It works well anyway.\nAll forum posts talk about the Dell XPS 13, but they are not working for Spectre.\nTL;DR:\nThe only solution can be found here in the GREY zone:\nhttp://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-PC-Sound-and-Audio/HP-spectre-x360-on-linux/td-p/4980797\nYes, you must reboot 2 time! Weird.\nEDIT\nBelow the essential part: --> It is all about kernel parameters in grub config\nHOW TO:\nEdit grub config by doing:\nsudo vim /etc/default/grub\nEdit the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash'\"\nReplace it with:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi='!Windows 2013' acpi_osi='!Windows 2012'\"\nThen run:\nsudo update-grub\nReboot TWO times. Yes. 2 times.\nThen Sound works (FYI The sound card is now in HDA mode -not I2S).\nTo confirm, run: aplay -l \nand make sure you have the following in the output:\ncard 1: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC3242 Analog [ALC3242 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 0/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\nWhen you open the Alsa mixer (the ound mixer settings window), you should see a sound card displayed.\nNote: The Added 'acpi_backlight=vendor' parameter apparently do nothing (it is supposed to keep backlight settings?)\nEDIT BIS:\nThe card seems in mute mode as default. You need to setup pulseaudio correctly ( pulsaudio/Alsa ).\nWith Manjaro OpenRC Linux I had to add the following packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*pulsaudio\n\n*pulseaudio-alsa \n\n*pulseaudio-equalizer\n\n*xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin\n\n*xfce4-volumed-pulse\n\n\nthen start the pulseaudio server manually \npulseaudio --start \nfrom (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio#Starting_manually)\nNow you can successfully launch the pulseaudio mixer (from associated the XFCE4 applet) & go to \"output devices\" and play with \"port\" and the  sliders.\n\nA: Most modern PCs are compatible with Linux. The HP Spectre X360 has Windows 8 installed, so you have to make sure that Secure Boot is disabled. Other than that, Ubuntu will work just fine.\n", "Q: Can I add logic to unattended-upgrades? I'd like to add some logic to unattended upgrades, but am unsure how to do so.  Here's what I'd like to do: If there are security updates, run command exampleCommand1, then proceed with updates. If no reboot is required after updates are installed, run command exampleCommand2 followed by exampleCommand3.  If reboot is required, run command exampleCommand4, then reboot.\n\nA: Reboot is required only after if you want to update kernel by running the command \"apt-get dist-upgrade\" other upgrades do not require reboot of server. This \"apt-get dist-upgrade\" updates your system only if there is new kernel available. \n", "Q: Virtualbox guest additions installation fails for shared folder support!

This happened to me once when I tried to install the nVIDIA binary drivers. This should help you get it back:\nWhen your computer starts up, login. It will ask you for your username and password. After you are logged in, type in sudo service lightdm restart If you still see the command line, type in startx.\nThese commands will recover your graphical shell. LightDM is Ubuntu's desktop manager. X is the graphical server that displays all of the windows and desktop effects.

What's battery got to do with anything?  \n\"...it's now stuck on the ubuntu start up screen with the dots thing.\" If you really can see the ubuntu dots you're in great luck. Just create a live DVD/USB like this: Create a live CD/DVD/USB , boot it up and install it from there.  \nIf you can boot Ubuntu in live mode, then the missing password is from the GRUB (the Ubuntu's bootloader) or from Ubuntu itself (rather the later). You can try to rescue your files from the disk while in Live mode and then reinstall Ubuntu and set a new password for Grub (only if you consider necessary).\nIf you can't boot Ubuntu (or any other linux) in live mode, the situation is a little grim: the missing password belongs to the BIOS/UEFI itself. And that password is coded directly into the hardware (into the BIOS chip to be exact). Very hard to recover. Without BIOS password the computer is in lock down mode. Can't do anything with it at all. \n", "Q: Problem booting Ubuntu after removing Windows so I've got a system that originally had Windows 8.1 on a regular HDD.  I added an SSD and installed Ubuntu on it.  After getting everything setup (this is my new media server), I decided to just format the drive that had Windows on it so I could use it for extra storage in Ubuntu.  The problem is that the MBR or GRUB must've been on that drive (it's sda, the SSD is sdb) and now it's gone so the computer won't boot.  I've booted up using my Ubuntu 14.04 Live USB and have installed and tried running Boot Repair, but it keeps complaining about some GPT partition and I'll admit, I have no clue what that is.  I can't seem to get this working with any of the automated tools so I'm hoping that someone here will be able to help.  Here's a link to the log that the Boot Repair program gave me, any help will be greatly appreciated. http://paste.ubuntu.com/10666549/\n\nA: The warnings and errors concerning a corrupt/invalid GPT (GUID partition table) pertain to a 2 GiB drive, so probably neither the hard drive nor the SSD, and can be safely ignored. Unfortunately that doesn't explain why Boot-Repair doesn't fix the boot loader.\nTo resolve your issue, I recommend a manual re-installation of Grub, which will be slightly more complicated than depicted in the answers to that question because of logical volume management on your system.\nIf you don't know what that is or how to deal with it, I recommend that you re-install Ubuntu without logical volume management (LVM), as it is an advanced option and causes more problems than it resolves in simple setups managed by inexperienced administrators.\n\nA: My recommended solution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from this download.\n\n*If it's not already disabled, disable Secure Boot. (You can re-enable it later, if you like, although you'll probably need to jump through some extra hoops to do so.)\n\n*Boot rEFInd. You should see at least one option to boot Linux.\n\n*Boot Linux from rEFInd.\n\n*Install rEFInd to your hard disk by using the Debian package or PPA referred to on the rEFInd downloads page referenced earlier.\n\n\nIf everything goes right, rEFInd will now be your default boot program and it will boot Ubuntu correctly. You can forget about GRUB at this point.\nAlternatively, you can manually install GRUB in the final step rather than install rEFInd. This will involve running the grub-install command, and perhaps update-grub to generate a fresh configuration file, but I don't recall the precise syntax you'd need to use.\n", "Q: remove the mysql server root:~# sudo apt-get --purge remove mysql-server\nReading package lists...

The message goes on to say: \"This requires installing packages from unauthenticated sources\". I read that it is recommended to apt-upgrade. But I had not found any explanation why this is the intended solution.  \nI would like to understand the process of auto-update releases, in regards to why does it require the apt-upgrade right now, before I touch my otherwise very stable system that way. I do not recall updates requiring this for my system in the last few years.\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS.\nThanks!\n\nA: To understand why this happens, one should first understand how stock apt (that is, apt without any priorities set), works. Let's say you want to run an upgrade using apt upgrade (I assume this is what you mean by apt-upgrade, since I cannot find any info on apt-upgrade): first, apt will check the local versions of all installed software with remote versions in a repository and see if there even needs to be an upgrade of packages. To demonstrate, let's create a hypothetical scenario in which 1 package, sayhello, needs to be upgraded.\nHere's an imaginary changelog:\nsayhello 1.1 now depends on libhello (>= 1.0) to print \"hello.\"\n\nNow imagine you have two sources listed in your sources.list, one being the stock Ubuntu repos, and another being Jim's amazing taco repo.\nJim's repo contains these 3 packages:\njimplayer 2.5 (No depends)\njimsbetterhello 1.0 (Depends on libhello (>= 2.0))\nlibhello 2.0 (No depends)\n\nYou only used this repo to install jimplayer a while back, but later on it seems that Jim decided to add jimsbetterhello to the repository. Now here's where things get interesting...\nUbuntu's repos still use libhello 1.5 for compatibility reasons (as some packages don't work on the new libhello version yet)\nNow, when apt goes to upgrade sayhello, it runs into a conundrum. There are 2 versions of libhello it can install! Which one should it chose? Well, by default apt will chose the latest version of a package that doesn't conflict with other currently installed packages. Now, normally this process is transparent to a user, but if you haven't added the GPG keys for a third-party repository, or the keys changed or some other thing, even though you installed sayhello from the default Ubuntu repositories, libhello 2.0 is going to be an untrusted package, and apt is going to warn you about that. This is just one of the many different permutations of why apt could be warning you about this. It could also be due to missing packages only available in a third-party repository you have added. The best workaround is to set the default repositories to a higher priority, as well as prune any unnecessary third-party repoitories without their keys added to the trusted keychain.\n", "Q: Screen went blank (black) I have been using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for 2 weeks now.

What exactly is \"linux-tools\" set of packages?\nIt is released with every kernel version, but (from what I can see) it contains only a few diagnostic utilities (cpupower, pref, turbostat, x86_energy_perf_policy) and is not required by any other package. These are all command line tools, they seem to deal with CPU settings, and I saw the functionality duplicated in some other graphical programs or widgets.\nSo... are they really needed by a non-technical, console-avoiding user?\n\nA: The linux-tools package contained three optional utilities: a utility for sharing USB devices over network connections, KBuild infrastructure components, and performance analysis tools. (In more recent versions of Ubuntu the tools seem to have moved to the linux-tools-generic package.)\nNo, you don't generally need them, and you probably don't want them. The utilities were separated into a different package because they are not DIRECTLY used by many folks, and not essential to the operation of most systems. \nOn the other hand, on the laptop I am using right now I DO have the linux-tools packages installed because they are a suggested package used by the TLP utility, which I installed to manage power and battery issues. If you are running a system with a different energy management package it might also install the linux-tools package to operate.\n", "Q: How do I reorder scopes on Ubuntu Touch?

My problem was caused because i was using the 32 bit version of the jre. when I installed the 64 bit version of java the errors disappeared.\n\nA: I had exact the same problem under openSUSE13.2 with eclipse. Solution was to move the jfxrt.jar file (can be found in Java SE Development Kit 8u45 tarball) to:\n/usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0/jre/lib/jfxrt.jar\n\nNot to /usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0/jre/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar as I did before.\n\nA: I also had the same issue. It took me several days to figure this out. The error clearly mentions that the problem is with javafx.graphics. You may have downloaded your JavaFX package from JavaFX probably Gluon. You have downloaded the LTS version. All files in this version work but the javafx.graphics. LTS is a good version therefore do not uninstall it. Instead, download an early access version from JavaFX - Gluon. Unzip it and replace the lib of your previously downloaded JavaFX with the lib of the new download. This solves the issue 100%.\n", "Q: Profile picture, whats the point, whats it used for? So I noticed I set a profile picture in Ubuntu.  There seems to be no point of it other than an extremely small icon about 4px by 4px when clicking at the top right.  Its not like it shows up at the login like in windows either.  So is there some point to it that I'm just not seeing or understanding?\n\nA: The old gnome panel used to show the user profile in the power off /reboot etc menu. Also, it may be used by login managers, but not lightdm as far as I know (which is default in your version of Ubuntu). It's more a legacy option than anything, but if you installed KDE or other DE it may show up.\nIf you're curious, your profile pictures is stored as a hidden file in your home, called .face (without any extension). You can open it with:\ngnome-open ~/.face\n\n\nA: Pidgin and Empathy use it as the default avatar.\n", "Q: Select full column in text file (geany)? How can I select a full column of text in Geany?\nI know that Ctrl + Alt allows me to select a rectangle of text, but if I want to select a full column, I have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the file, which is very unproductive.\n\nA: Possibly Ctrl + Shift + selection with the Mouse will be more productive for you.\n\nA: Select a beginning column and pressing AltShift use ↓ key. \n\nA: With the cursor just before the first entry of the column, press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+End. This will enlarge the cursor over the full column. Now press Ctrl+Shift+Right and the full column will be selected.\n\nA: One of ways to get about this limitation is to simply zoom out in the text editor to make your long file shorter and then use box selection. This way you will be able to select the long columns in a few seconds.\n\nA: Similar to Muzaffar's answer, but maybe a little more efficient if you have a Page Down key:\nSelect your beginning column, then and press and hold AltShift and use the Page Down key.\nPage Down will go through the rows much more rapidly than ↓.\n", "Q: Is it possible to convert only audio in video file using avconv? I have downloaded a video file in AVI format and it seems to have A52 (AC3) encoded audio. VLC for iOS can't play this audio format. \nCan I convert audio of this video file to AAC or something more standard across Linux and iOS? How should I go about this?\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract audio from video. Convert audio to standard format.

Look at the minus-key. When clicking the 1/2 button, the minus-key becomes an underscore-key:\n\n", "Q: How can I convert images of pdf files to text? I am looking for a way to convert images of a PDF to a real text file.\nI have tried using Okular, GSCAN2PDF, GIMP, ImageMagick and XPDF but I am having problems with all of them, maybe because I don't have much experience with them and I'm struggling to understand the instructions I've found. I would appreciate a beginner-level explanation.\n\nA: First install poppler-utils which contains Pdfimages. Pdfimages is a tool command line, which allows to extract all images from a PDF file and save them as JPEG files.\nOpen a terminal, by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T\nInstall the software:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install poppler-utils\n\nThe syntax of this tool is:\npdfimages -j file.pdf output_directory\n\nWhere file.pdf is the file you want to extract images and output_directory is the directory where you want to save the images.\nImages are saved in the following format:\noutput_directory/output_directory-nnn.jpg\n\nIt's funny, but they are named with the same name of the directory where you extracted, a consecutive number and extension.\nSecond, just install an application for ocr, for example ocrfeeder:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr ocrfeeder tesseract-ocr-eng gocr cuneiform ocropusocrad\n\nOnce the program opens, select the search engine you want to use. Select the Edit menu and select Preferences from the dropdown menu.\nIn the dialog that opens select the Tools tab. Here you will see an option that puts favorite engine. In this option, select Tesseract and then press the OK button.\nAfter completing the settings we can start with the action\nTo do this we press the + symbol:\nThen select the image file you want to open.\nIf necessary retouch the image, only you have to access the Tools menu. Once inside the Tools menu select the option unpaper. The display will find various options and filters to retouch the image.\n", "Q: Car hands free not connecting with Ubuntu Phone bluetooth I have just received my Ubuntu phone and I'm a little disappointed to see that it is not being recognised my the car's hands free system (Mazda3 2014 model). I never had any issues connecting my Samsung GS5 before - so it's not a car issue. I use my phone in the car extensively.\n\nA: I managed to connect the BQ Ubuntu Phone to my built-in handsfree set (Volvo V60, 2014) by turning the car in discoverable mode and connecting to the car from the phone.\nVice versa, i.e. connecting to the phone (in discoverable mode) from the car did not work.

Everything is running smoothly with some difficulties, but I had a small problem with my input source icon, it is not showing the current language instead it is showing a black rectangle with a red ring in it. \nI tried to remove the check in the Text Entry Settings and re-check it again I get the same result.\nIs there any way to change it.\nP.S: The icon appears correctly in the login screen.\n\nA: In my case I was using Kubuntu then moved back to Unity desktop, when I needed some space on my machine I uninstalled all the Kubuntu packages and problem is now solved.\nIt turns out that Kubuntu has some issues running alongside other desktops.\n", "Q: extra http in http_proxy setting I've just installed Ubuntu on a desktop at work. All traffic flows through a proxy. For some reason Firefox works fine with the set proxy, but nothing else.\nI checked the terminal with:\n    set | grep -i proxy\nand I saw that all my proxies have an extra http:// or https:// in there. How do I get rid of it. I entered my proxy as www-abc.company.com:12345. No idea where the extra http: could be coming from.\n\nA: You can redefine proxies as below in terminal , define these environment variables into the global /etc/environment file , so they will be always available \nexport http_proxy=abc.com:8080\nexport https_proxy=abc.com:8080\n\n", "Q: Creating a symlink from one folder to another with different names? I have two folders, one of which is my webserver root. I want to link it to my project folder so that I can keep things up-to-date with Git.\nIf I try to do this:\nln -s /home/user/project  /var/www/html\n\nThe system creates a folder called project within the html folder, and links that. Is there any way to link it so that the directory 'html' points to the contents of project? Do they have to be the same name?\nNote: I also need to link several hidden files. Can I do this using ln? \n\nA: Make sure html directory is not created under /var/www/.\nThe command then is: ln -s -T /home/user/project /var/www/html\n\nA: From man ln:\n\nBy default, each destination (name of new link) should not already exist.\n\nAs you already have a directory named html, the link will be created inside /var/www/html having the name of the target i.e. project.\nIf you want to have a symlink /var/www/html pointing to /home/user/project then you should not have the directory html present beforehand. So, you should only have /var/www and then running the following will create the desired symlink (don't do this unless you are sure):\nln -s /home/user/project /var/www/html\n\nNote: if you use a trailing slash (like in ln -s /home/user/project /var/www/html/) you will get an error: ln: target '/var/www/html' is not a directory: No such file or directory.\nHere is an example:\n$ pwd\n/home/user/test/askubuntu\n\n$ ls -l\ntotal 4\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 user user 4096 Mar 25 00:16 foo\n\n$ ln -s /home/user/test/bar /home/user/test/askubuntu/foo\n\n$ ls -l\ntotal 4\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 user user 4096 Mar 25 00:17 foo\n\n$ cd foo/\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 25 Mar 25 00:17 bar -> /home/user/test/bar\n\n$ cd ..\n$ rm -r foo/\n\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\n\n$ ln -s /home/user/test/bar /home/user/test/askubuntu/foo\n\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 25 Mar 25 00:18 foo -> /home/user/test/bar\n\nAnd yes, you can create symlinks of hidden files.\n", "Q: Locked out of admin after setting up winbind I followed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise Pangolin: File sharing with Samba by Jonathan Hobson on Sitepoint to try to see my windows workgroup from my Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit machine and now I am locked out as administrator.

Usually their server puts restriction on multi-segmented downloads and interupts resuming also, multi segmented download is not a good option.

Is there any software I could use instead and how would I install it onto Android Studio?\n\nA: Check if your CPU supports hardware virtualization,  by typing:\negrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo\n\nIf the result is 0, your CPU does not support hardware virtualization, which is necessary to run the KVM. If you get 1 or more, that means you’re fine.\nNext, install KVM.

After GRUB repair two Windows 7 boot options are appearing. Both are booting the same Windows 7 OS. The system recovery partition is appearing as separate partition in My Computer. \nI read from Ubuntu help, the older GRUB files are saved in system recovery partition. How can I remove older GRUB files from system recovery partition with removing system recovery files.\n\nA: If they are both booting to the same OS then I don't see a huge problem, my solution simply involves editing the grub menu in order to get rid of the other option. First of I would check your grub.cfg file. This can be accessed typically via the following commands:\n cd /boot/grub/\n **insert favorite text editor here** grub.cfg (you may need root access to perform this operation)\n\nThis is an important file to your system, so messing with it is not advised unless you know what you are doing, hence the DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE at the top of the file.\nIn terms of your question, we are going to be removing a menuentry. Scroll through this file until you find something resembling the following:\nmenuentry 'Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda2 *this may be different depending on the computer*)\n\nThe following lines are important, if I am right about this file there should be two of these menuentry's and THEY SHOULD BE THE EXACT SAME. A simple solution would be to remove one of the entries. I will emphasize this again THEY MUST BE THE SAME. A good move would be to make a copy of this file and save it somewhere where you can access it in case of a failure. Something like:\ncp grub.cfg ~/\n\nThis should solve your problem. I would advise against removing the old GRUB files in the recovery partition as it could cause some problems later, unless they are causing problems now.\n", "Q: Create shortcut for \"MyEclipse\" I use Ubuntu 14.04.

Such errors almost never result from software problems -- and when it is a software problem, it's likely to be a bad driver. I didn't notice anything obvious in the SMART test results you posted, so my guess is you've got a bad cable to the hard disk, or possibly a bad disk controller chip on your motherboard. Try unplugging your disk cable and plugging it back in. If that fails, try replacing the disk cable with a new one. If that fails, try the disk in another computer to see if it works better there. (If it does, your motherboard's disk controller is probably fried. This can be bypassed with a plug-in board on most desktop systems, but in a laptop it's more likely to be the computer's swan song.)\n", "Q: Root user not having permissions My root user is not working how he should.\nsudo works perfectly but if I login with root, autocomplete does not work for all commands which need root permission and I couldn't execute a file owned by one of my users.

Files will be considered unwritable).\nSame problem with 775\nSo the problem is that my webserver needs all permission to \"OTHER\" and not just for USER (or at least for GROUP)\nIn order to avoid this trouble I've added USER1 to www-data group\nusermod -a -G www-data USER1\n\nbut files are still unwritable with 775 or 755.

Firstly, let me say I am very new to the Linux community. I have only been using Ubuntu for 2 weeks, so I do not know a lot. As well I am not tech savvy so it may be obvious, but I don't see it.\nI have a 120 ssd and 1tb hdd, in a rig that was made a few hours ago. I want to make the ssd my boot drive and used frequently files. So how do I set it up so my /home will be on my hdd but specific files/games/boot up will be on ssd.\nI have tried looking online but nothing I found fit what I was looking for. \n\nA: Hey i would seriously consider LVM if you have the time to research. here are some steps to put your /home on your HDD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a partition on your HDD - use a partitioning tool like gparted\n\n*Format the HDD with a partitioning tool - use ext4 filesystem\n\n*Mount /home directory to the device - read link below!\nNote: you may have to mount /home while using a live cd or you can backup and re-install and choose the \"Custom\" option during install as mentioned above.\nUseful links:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount\n\nA: If you want specific programs to be on the /home volume, you will need to manually move them there and replace the original files with symbolic links ( see man ln ) that point to the other location.  After installing a program you can use dpkg -L pkgname to see what files make it up and move them one by one.\n", "Q: Windows 7: No internet connection after installing Ubuntu via Dual-boot Today I've installed Ubuntu 14.10 alongside Windows 7, like dual-boot. So, it Ubuntu works perfectly for now on - connects to an internet and discovers the network IP.\nThe huge problem is in Windows 7: it won't connect to the internet at all. I've tried to use a trobleshooter (though I think it's useless), and that's what it told me:\n\"Local Area Connection\" doesn't have a valid IP configuration\n\nRunning ipconfig /all in the cmd gives the following: Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address: 169.254.251.244 \nSo, there is my full ipconfig output: http://pastebin.com/fD2JjFU2\nNow a small update: I experienced this problem using Ethernet connection. I have a router which uses a different subnet, so I tried to connect the PC to the router via LAN. The connection now works perfectly, but the problem still exists.\n\nA: OK, I'm not extremely familiar with Windows, but as a general techie I'll give my two cents.\nI'll bet your problem is that the card/connection is configured to connect to some weird kind of DHCP server, based on the \"Autoconfiguration IP address\". After a simple Google search, one of the first results was this: \nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/8acb7cd1-7028-4ffe-86c9-eb43041cf8b3/how-do-i-get-rid-of-second-169254xx-ipv4-address-on-windows-server-2008-sp2-x86?forum=winservergen\nScrolling down, you see this\n\"169.254.x.x is the APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) range. This range in Windows is automatically assigned if no DHCP servers responds or is unavailable in the Network.\"\nThere is your problem.\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look in your settings, and check out the DHCP settings. There may be something wrong. I don't really know exactly where that is in the Control Panel, but it should be under Network Settings, since I've been Linux-exclusive for a while.\n\n*Set a static IP. Normally these are in the 192.168.1.x range. Again, I don't really know how to set it, check in Network Settings.\nIf these don't work, remember that Google is your friend.

This is because I have received a multitude of issues while trying to install and use my NVIDIA GTX 750Ti graphics card.\nISSUE 1:\nI cannot get the monitor plugged into my graphics card, to display anything that looks like a GUI. This has lead me to attempt to install a graphics driver, which has lead to several other problems.\nISSUE 2:\nEvery time I attempt to install a driver, it has either done nothing (I still can't plug my monitor into the graphics card) or it has broken my install to the point where I have to reinstall Ubuntu from a bootable USB\nNote:\nA terminal installation is preferred, because my MadCatz gaming mouse doesn't work correctly, and every time I fix it, something deletes/renames/clears the xorg.conf in X11.\nAlso, the way I have been able to see Ubuntu, is using a second monitor that is plugged into the motherboard, and by switching the main monitor between the graphics card and the motherboard\n\nA: You're suffering from the xorg bug 1405696 of the NVIDIA driver version 346. You can watch the status of the bug until it changes to Fix committed to use 346. Meanwhile you should stick with 340 by running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-340. In your case you might be obliged to type it blindly to try to install the driver in a chroot.

I'm trying to use a 3.5 jack microphone in Ubuntu 14.04, the problem is that Ubuntu doesn't have noise suppression by default, so I got a very loud static noise.\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed libwebrtc-audio-processing-0 and libwebrtc-audio-processing-dev and tried to activate it using pactl load-module module-echo-cancel aec_method=WebRTC, but I got an error:\n\nFailure: Module initialization failed\n\n\n*I also tried to enable it in /etc/pulse/default.pa with:\nload-module module-echo-cancel source_name=echosource aec_method=webrtc\nset-default-source echosource\n\nBut it makes the sound applet crash, and doesn't work anyway.\nHow I can make this work?\n\nA: First off, let me tell you my qualifications:  I have a degree in electronic engineering, a degree in audio engineering, and 23+ years experience doing both and as an IT professional.  I say this not to brag, but so you will understand what qualifies me to give the advice I'm going to give you.\nThe very first thing I'd tell you to do is try the microphone on a different device or computer - one that you KNOW for a fact works, preferably in the same location that you are trying to use the system that has the problem.  That will eliminate the mic and location as possible causes of your problem.  Since you are using the standard headphone-style jack, I can tell you that things like florescent lights are picked up by the cord like an antenna, and they are VERY noisy.  The microphone's cable should be shielded, but often times they are not, and this allows EM noise (like that from the aforementioned lights) to be picked up and converted to audio noise far more easily than many people realize.\nAlso try recording with nothing plugged in to the card (no sound source).  That will make sure the recording circuits and driver of your sound card aren't the issue.  If  you are using a player of some kind instead of a microphone, you may be sending too strong a signal in, especially if you don't have separate microphone and line in jacks.  Sending a line-level signal into a Microphone input will cause severe distortion that sounds a lot like static.  If this is the case, turn the volume down - WAY down - and pray you haven't blown the input on your sound card.\nIt's possible you don't have exactly the right driver for your sound card.  Playback, which is (of course) the most commonly used section of a sound card, is far easier to develop a driver for (or so I'm told - I'm not a programmer) because so many of them use the same DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) chip.  It is also more forgiving of minor variations from card to card because the conversion from digital to analog is so basic and straight forward, electronically speaking.  As long as the data gets to the DAC properly, there isn't much more for the driver to do, and that is more or less done the same way by all sound cards, so a generic driver works pretty well for that side of things.\nRecording is a far more difficult process because ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) chips are more expensive and therefore more varied from card to card.  The noise you are getting can EASILY be caused by the recording circuit of your sound card not being initialized properly due to the wrong driver.  If you can't find a driver for your exact sound card, try to find an old Sound Blaster 16 (or compatible) card and put it in your system.  The system will have the proper driver for that built in since it's such a standard in the sound card world.\nGood luck!\n\nA: While some of the other responses are useful, they seem to miss the most common issue with microphone background noise, and that is the base volume.  \nMany people set the base volume on the microphone to full.  This overdrives the sound when there is sound, and makes noise when there isn't.   This is largely because most of us have grown dependent on software, drivers and devices that make this adjustment for us. \nThe simplest solution is to load a volume gauge program and speak into the microphone, adjusting the volume until it hits the ideal range, but does not hold at the peak too long.   A more sophisticated method would be to use an audio program (such as audacity) with clip detection to detecting overdriving and then adjust the microphone until you are the point that you rarely if ever get waveform clipping.\n", "Q: How to signal hook is still in error state after juju debug-hooks I was fixing some stuff using juju debug-hooks.

When choosing the latter a gnome-terminal is displayed to monitor the progress of updating the apt sources and installing the -dbg packages. How can I keep that terminal window from disappearing if the apt-get process finished or crashed?\nThe solution shouldn't require any interaction with the terminal at all after the installation has been started.\nThis is crucial for debugging failures of apport itself. Currently the terminal disappears without any noticeable error and then an apport dialog for the package which didn't finish to create the backtrace or for the crash of apport itself (starting an infinite loop of apport detecting its own crash) is opened.\nNote: This in not about a specific issue that makes the gnome-terminal opened by apport disappear, i.e. I don't care if apt-get makes a segmentation fault or a dpkg subroutine returns != 0, ...\n\nA: Doesn't seem to exist and there's no need to figure out nasty workarounds. I opened feature request/bug 1442159 to get developer feedback.\n\nA: Since apport supports interactive feedback as discussed at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport/DeveloperHowTo#Custom_Invocation it would seem all that's required is to start the process with a variant on the \nYes/No Question psuedo code \ndef add_info(report, ui):\nclose_terminal = False\n\nif ui and ui.yesno('Close Terminal?') == True:\n    close_terminal = True\n\nif close_terminal == True:\n    # user wants terminal to close\n\nNote: I'm not a developer so don't hold my feet to the fire, but logically this seems like something the devs could do without much difficulty.\n", "Q: SSL Node.js Charms with Haproxy When writing a Node.js charm that requires SSL how should I write the Haproxy web hooks?\nI am using the following hooks based on the sample code:\nhooks/website-relation-joined:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nrelation-set \"hostname=$(unit-get private-address)\"\nrelation-set \"port=80\"\n\n# Set an optional service name, allowing more config-based\n# customization\nrelation-set \"service_name=mindproject\"\n\nhooks/website-relation-changed:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nhost=$(unit-get private-address)\nport=80\n\nrelation-set \"services={ service_name: mindproject,service_options: [mode http, balance leastconn],crts: [DEFAULT], servers: [[mindproject, $host, $port, option httpchk GET / HTTP/1.0]]}\"\n\nAfter juju add-relation mindproject:website mind-proxy:reverseproxy the Haproxy charm fails reverseproxy-relation-changed hook with this log:\n2015-03-24 20:17:31 INFO reverseproxy-relation-changed ^MReading package lists... 0%^M^MReading package lists... 0%^M^MReading package lists... 1%^M^MReading package lists... 11%^M^MReading package lists.$\n2015-03-24 20:17:31 INFO reverseproxy-relation-changed ^MBuilding dependency tree... 0%^M^MBuilding dependency tree... 0%^M^MBuilding dependency tree... 50%^M^MBuilding dependency tree... 50%^M^MBuilding $\n2015-03-24 20:17:31 INFO reverseproxy-relation-changed ^MReading state information... 0%^M^MReading state information... 5%^M^MReading state information...

It was pre-installed with Windows 8 and I had a weird problem when I plugged my Android phone to USB port. The USB mass storage would show up and then immediately closes and it would keep doing that until I unplug the phone. It was like as if I plug in and unplug the cable repeatedly. \nI solved the problem by uninstalling the phone driver in Device Manager and re-installing it via Windows update. But now I have the same problem in Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Ubuntu Mate. As soon as I connect the phone, it sometimes mounts the memory and mostly shows random error like:\n - Couldn't found matching udev device.\n - Could not find \"mtp://[usb:002,015]/\"\n - Unable to open MTP device \"[usb:002,105]\"\n - No such interface 'org.gtk.vfs.Mount' on object at path/org/gtk/vfs/mount/1\n\nIt keeps throwing errors and won't allow me to do anything until I unplug the cable. \nI have already installed mtpfs and mtp-tools and I have also created 51-android-rules based on https://github.com/snowdream/51-android.\nWhat is the problem? Does USB3 have anything to do with this repeating errors?\nUpdate:\nI removed mtpfs and mtp-tools and plug the phone to a USB 2.0 port and it works better now. Still some periodic disconnects though. So it's obvious that USB 3.0 has something to do with this. Any tip would be appreciated.\n\nA: So the problem was a bad cable.

The number stays rounded -- even after formatting the column after the file is created.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: For what I know, LibreOffice has no arbitrary precision numbers (decimal or integers). So if the number exceeds the range of a long integer it is stored as an IEEE754 number and so it has a limited precision. \nSo basically you can't do calculations with arbitrary precision in Calc, and if you want to read the long number as a number you will have it rounded off. \nIf you do not need to do calculations, use a string; put in your csv:\n,\n,\n,12345678901234678901234567890\n,\"123456789012345678901234567890\"\n\n(notice the quotation marks) and then when reading it be sure to add \"quoted field as text\" and the correct text delimiter:\n\n...and you have \n\nNow --- if you touch, transform, eval the string --- you will have the rounding kicking in again. \nMaybe you can use currency type which is a 64 bit integer, but as far as I know there is no way to force that via csv. \n", "Q: Find and replace regular expression (matching unicode character class Devanagari) in multiple files Say you have a file named test.txt with the following lines:\nಕದಂಬ\nकदम्ब\n\nThen, suppose you want to replace each devanagarI unicode character (ie in कदम्ब) with a D.

Your processor is not a quad-core, it's a dual-core with Hyper-Threading: Intel.com: ARK | Intel® Core™ i7-4500U Processor (4M Cache, up to 3.00 GHz).\nAccordingly, sudo lshw -C cpu tells this as well:\nconfiguration: cores=2 enabledcores=2 threads=4\n\nThis means that the processor has two physical cores, but each physical core is virtualized from Intel's Hyper-Threading Technology into 2 logical cores so that the system is capable to handle four thread at the time instead of two. From Wikipedia.com:\n\nArchitecturally, a processor with Hyper-Threading Technology consists of two logical processors per core, each of which has its own processor architectural state.\n\nAnd that explains things like the fact that you detect four cores instead of two for example in System Monitor.\n", "Q: Copy row and column of LibreOffice calc with heading?

I removed both with the \"OSremover\" found on boot-repair-disk's live image.\nBefore removing Ubuntu I forgot that I had encrypted the home directory. The removal worked just fine, and now I can boot into windows as usual.\nHowever, now that I'm trying to install a new Linux OS, I can see that gparted doesn't recognize any partitions on my disk and it says that all of the space there is unallocated. I checked with the disk management service on windows and it can see all my partitions just fine, even the ones I previously used for the two Linux installations (which I've deleted and merged with my windows partition).\nI have no idea what's going on, I've tried fixing the mbr with bootrec /fixmbr but that didn't do anything. Also, running fdisk -l from a live image of elementary-os lists my partitions as they should be.\nI'm adding outputs from the from the sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda and /sudo parted /dev/sda print commands as per Rod Smith's suggestion. First, fdisk:\nDisk /dev/sda: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30401 cylinders, total 488397168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xcab10bee\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *          63   484458486   242229212    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2       484472205   488408129     1967962+   f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sda5       486434816   488396783      980984   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nNow, parted:\nError: Can't have a partition outside the disk!           \n\nHope this helps.\nSolution:\nRan fixparts and it automatically fixed the error on execution, just had to save the new table with the w command.\nConcern:\nReceived the following message:\nWarning: 0xEE partition doesn't start on sector 1. This can cause problems\nin some OSes.\n\n\nA: Chances are your partition table is damaged, or possibly just a little bit odd. GParted tends to show disks with such partition tables as being completely empty (with no partitions), which is unhelpful.\nThe solution is to fix the partition table. Unfortunately, it's unclear from your post exactly what's wrong with the partition table. Posting the output of sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda and of sudo parted /dev/sda print might give some clues about what's wrong.\nYou could also try running my FixParts on the disk, although it's probably better to try to figure out what's wrong first. FixParts can fix a number of common problems, but if used inappropriately it could conceivably cause more damage -- hence my recommendation to post your partition data here first. (You can add this information by editing your post. Be sure to add four spaces to the start of each line of program output; this is a flag to the forum software to preserve the formatting.) Please add a comment to this answer if you add this information; that way I'll notice and check back.\n\nEDIT: Your problem is that your disk is 488,397,168 sectors long, but your extended partition extends out to sector 488,408,129. Fortunately, the logical partition within the extended partition is of legal size. This is one of the problems that FixParts can fix, so try using it. Be sure to read its documentation first. The solution is fairly simple, but you have to know at least the basics of how to use the program; it won't guide you by the hand through the process.\n\nA: Gparted is unable to read the partition table of your HDD.

When I try to install it, the following result comes up:\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nSome packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n mono-complete : Depends: mono-devel (= 3.12.1-0xamarin1) but it is not going to be installed\n                 Depends: mono-4.0-service (= 3.12.1-0xamarin1) but it is not going to be installed\n                 Depends: libmono-cil-dev (= 3.12.1-0xamarin1) but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\n\nA: For the benefit of others, here is one scenario where this problem occurred for me: using the latest Jenkins docker repository, which is based on Debian 8 \"jessie\".\nI ran the normal mono install instructions, including \napt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF\necho \"deb http://download.mono-project.com/repo/debian wheezy main\" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-xamarin.list\n\nThen the apt-get install -y mono-devel was failing with unmet dependencies. \nI tried reloading the docker image and running the install without the two commands above.

But, the problem is my desktop look has completely changed to Ubuntu 10.04 where there is no side bar (a launcher which has shortcuts and search button) which is called unity launcher. Now I am getting top and bottom task bars which is same as in ubuntu 10.04.\nI want my Ubuntu 14.10 desktop look back: what I need to do for that (without any re-installation of OS)?

Thus the process (the batch file) will continue running independently.\nNow, suppose that I have an shell script (e.g. file.sh), which I want to launch from Java and has a similar behavior. How could it be the equivalent command (3) in Linux? \n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*See CMD.exe (Command Shell) | Windows CMD | SS64.com\n\n*See Start - Start a program | Windows CMD | SS64.com\n\n*The title (\"Title\") is not required.\n\n\nA: The way to launch a script is to give its path:\n/path/to/script.sh\n\nTo have it continue if the parent process exits, you can just launch it in the background by appending &:\n/path/to/script.sh &\n\nSo, if you have, for example, one script calling another like so:\n#!/bin/bash\nscript2.sh &\n\nYou could run script1.sh which will call script2.sh and, because it is sent to the background, exit immediately.\n\nA: You have many options, the more interesting are these:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it's for Ubuntu, you can use gnome-terminal:\ngnome-terminal -c \"/home/$USER/file.sh\" -t \"Title\"\n\nor:\ngnome-terminal -- \"/home/$USER/file.sh\" -t \"Title\"\n\n\n*If do you want to make it compatible with most linux, you can use xterm:\nxterm -T \"Title\" -e \"/home/$USER/file.sh\"\n\nThe path is /home/$USER/file.sh (Windows 7 equivalent: C:\\Users\\%UserProfile%\\file.bat)\nThe file.sh contents may be something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"In a World without Walls nor Fences, the people don't need Windows and Gates\"\nsleep 2\n\n\nA: Various ways to execute a script in Linux:\nmy arbitrary script name is foo.bat\nex1:$bash foo.bat \nex2:$./foo.bat\nex3:$echo $(~/Desktop/foo.bat)\nex4:`~/Desktop/foo.bat`\nex5:$ /path/to/shell/script/foo.bat\n\nex1: this is is just a regular file at this point, we execute it with bash\nex2: we have marked foo.bat as executable. ($chmod +x foo.bat)\nex3: Command substitution \nex4: execute using \"``\"\nex5: we us the path to the executable.\n\nThese are the most common.\nI would avoid calling things like gnome-terminal, and xterm. These are less common shells compared to things like bash, and sh.\nFor example I use Ubuntu mate. I have neither xterm nor gnome-terminal. But, I do have bash, and sh. as does nearly ever other person running Linux / mac osx.\nYou may appreciate this tutorial on script execution here\nthe script foo.bat does this:\n$ ./foo.bat\nHaving a bash ./foo.bat\n\nwhere its contents are:\n$ cat foo.bat \n#!/bin/bash\necho -e \"Having a bash\" $0\n\nI think the use of $0 can give you the title functionality you may desire.\nMany more possibilities exist. \n\nA: As I understand, you want to run an external command from within Java, and have the Java process continue (asynchronously) whilst that external command continues to run too?\nHere's a little test I whipped up:\n[tai@flenux runproc ] $ ls\nfilecreator.sh  ProcRunner.class  ProcRunner.java\n\n[tai@flenux runproc ] $ cat filecreator.sh \ntouch newfile\n\n[tai@flenux runproc ] $ cat ProcRunner.java \n\npublic class ProcRunner {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            Runtime.getRuntime().exec(args);\n            Thread.sleep(2000);\n            System.out.println(\"Done\");\n        } catch(Exception e) {\n            System.err.println(e.toString() );\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n[tai@flenux runproc ] $ java ProcRunner bash filecreator.sh \nDone\n\n[tai@flenux runproc ] $ ls\nfilecreator.sh  newfile  ProcRunner.class  ProcRunner.java\n\n[tai@flenux runproc ] $ \n\nJava successfully execs the program (which simply creates the \"newfile\" file) ; it also continues on its own merry way to print the Done message after calling the exec.\nIf you wanted a terminal window to open too, prefix the call string\nRuntime.getRuntime().exec([\"gnome-terminal\", \"-e\"]+args);\n\nSo to answer your question, it looks like you would just call the method you specified. Are you getting a different behaviour?\n", "Q: Ubuntu disk start error \"Starting track if upstart is running in a container [fail]\" I made a custum ubuntu distro. when I try to boot from it I get the error \"Starting track if upstart is running in a container [fail]\" and the screen gets stuck on the start screen. What can be the reason for this error?\n\nA: In my case the problem seemed to be the instructions from the LiveCDCustomization guide that said to delete initctl:\n\nIf you installed software, be sure to run ...\nrm /sbin/initctl\ndpkg-divert --rename --remove /sbin/initctl\n\nThe original .iso image does include /sbin/initctl in the squashfs filesystem. Adding that file back into my customized image solved the problem for me. I think the steps to remove initctl are only meant for 9.10, and are intended to undo the related steps from earlier in the guide:\n\nIn 9.10, before installing or upgrading packages you need to run ...\ndpkg-divert --local --rename --add /sbin/initctl\nln -s /bin/true /sbin/initctl\n\n", "Q: Missing File After Destroying KVM I am using virsh to manage my KVMs on Ubuntu 14.04.

Surprising, but ok.\nWhile the KVM was running I mounted the LV. Everything was still ok. Then when I destroyed the KVM my disk image disappeared. \nHow did my disk path target (disk image) disappear? Any way to recover it?\n\nA: Apparently I had saved my img file to right path but wrong device (forgot to mount after restart so it was on my OS device). Thus when I mounted by kvm image device this file was hidden. Found it by accident when I unmounted the device.\nThis response helped to clarify what I was doing wrong.\n", "Q: NVIDIA GTX 750Ti Doesn't Work My graphics card (NVIDIA GTX 750Ti) will display the BIOS, GRUB, then a black screen on launch. I know that this is a graphics card problem because the only way to see Ubuntu is by switching the monitor to the motherboard rather than the graphics card. This means I can access Ubuntu, but I can't use my graphics card, and thus can't play graphically intensive games.\n\nA: Answered here : https://askubuntu.com/a/111298/389736\nThen when you booted in, install proper driver for your GPU.\n\nA: Which Ubuntu version? Ubuntu packages are generally recommended instead of direct from nvidia.com, so everything is coordinated and updates automatically. If you need a newer version than in standard repos, there are ppa packages available for that.\nI have not tried 14.04.2 or 14.10 yet, but 64-bit 14.04.1 live/install iso, graphics seemed to work fine for my GTX 750 Ti using nomodeset boot parameter. However, once installed it would not get to gui login screen because the Maxwell chip apparently was not supported by nouveau yet. And I could not even log into text console (Ctrl+Alt_F1) which would flash motd and immediately return to login prompt.\nWhen I installed nvidia-current from recovery boot by (enabling networking, going to root console, installing it and rebooting, that got me as far as login gui, but could not start X because that nvidia 304 version did not support my card according to logs (even though an updated 304 version in 12.04 worked for it).\nSo I would suggest booting to recovery mode (which I believe automatically uses nomodeset), enable networking from menu (wait for it to return to menu if any errors), then go to root console from menu. Normally you would use \"sudo \" prefix for these commands, but sudo is not needed from root console. If you previously installed any nvidia package (like nvidia-current) do apt-get purge nvidia* then do:\napt-get update\napt-get install nvidia-331-updates\nreboot\n\nThat version worked for my GTX 750 Ti, although, I later purged that and am running nvidia-346 from xorg-edgers ppa which is no faster by default, but allows me to play with video overclocking.\nIf you did not use nomodeset during install, you may need to edit (e) the linux line while in grub during boot adding nomodeset to the end of it. Then edit /etc/default/grub to add nomodeset to this line like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\nThen run sudo update-grub\nNOTE: Do not use nomodeset for hybrid Intel/Nvidia graphics on a laptop. I heard that could cause issues with hybrid graphics and everything worked fine without nomodeset when installing 14.04.1 to my laptop with Intel HD 4600/Nvidia GTX 765m graphics using nvidia-331-updates package.\n", "Q: Difference between desktop-install and copying desktop file to applications directory When we want to add a shortcut to menu. We can do that by creating filename.desktop and copy that file to /usr/share/applications. And there is another way to, that is doing desktop-file-install filename.desktop. What is difference between those two?\nUntil now, I still use copy method because if I want to remove it, i just delete it. And desktop-file-install seems like doesn't have desktop-file-uninstall.\n\nA: To quote man desktop-file-install:\n\ndesktop-file-install will always try to validate the resulting desktop file. A failure to validate might lead to the abortion of the installation of the desktop files.\n\nIn contrast, cp will copy anything.\nSo there is no desktop-file-uninstall since there is no need to validate files you are deleting.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but the answer was either incomplete or has changed over time.\ndesktop-file-install causes a database update, and to be precise, it updates the cache by rebuild_cache().\nMore details can be found in the source, in the official repository \"desktop-file-utils\":\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/desktop-file-utils/-/blob/master/src/install.c#L291\nJust copying with cp does not cause the mime base to be updated, which is important - it does not update its cache.\nThis is important for file updating - you may notice that if you change the text of the *.desktop on path /usr/share/xfce4/helpers/ file itself, the changes will not be accepted immediately.\nThe install call will do:\n\n*\n\n*First validation of the *.desktop file by desktop-file-validate\n\n*Further, if the file is valid, it will update the database by calling the update-desktop-database command\n\n", "Q: freeglut OpenGL GLX extension not supported by display ':0' I am trying to run an application with OpenGL and the following message apears:\nfreeglut OpenGL GLX extension not supported by display ':0'\n\nI already read lots of topics here and in stackexchange and anyone of them presented a real solution; I am running an Ubuntu 12.04 with nvidia driver 346 (installed via file from site).

For example to get help you need to press Fn + F1 together.\nThere is a way to reverse Fn key behavior for Apple devices explained here, basically it suggest to issue following command:\n$ echo 2 | sudo tee /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode\n\nHowever there is no hid_apple folder (of course) in my system and I cannot create a fnmode file under /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/ folder.\nUpdate:\nOutput of lsusb\n$ sudo lsusb -v -d 045e:\n[sudo] password for destan: \n\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 045e:0800 Microsoft Corp. \nDevice Descriptor:\n  bLength                18\n  bDescriptorType         1\n  bcdUSB               2.00\n  bDeviceClass            0 (Defined at Interface level)\n  bDeviceSubClass         0 \n  bDeviceProtocol         0 \n  bMaxPacketSize0        64\n  idVendor           0x045e Microsoft Corp.\n  idProduct          0x0800 \n  bcdDevice            9.34\n  iManufacturer           1 Microsoft\n  iProduct                2 Microsoft® Nano Transceiver v2.0\n  iSerial                 0 \n  bNumConfigurations      1\n  Configuration Descriptor:\n    bLength                 9\n    bDescriptorType         2\n    wTotalLength           84\n    bNumInterfaces          3\n    bConfigurationValue     1\n    iConfiguration          0 \n    bmAttributes         0xa0\n      (Bus Powered)\n      Remote Wakeup\n    MaxPower              100mA\n    Interface Descriptor:\n      bLength                 9\n      bDescriptorType         4\n      bInterfaceNumber        0\n      bAlternateSetting       0\n      bNumEndpoints           1\n      bInterfaceClass         3 Human Interface Device\n      bInterfaceSubClass      1 Boot Interface Subclass\n      bInterfaceProtocol      1 Keyboard\n      iInterface              0 \n        HID Device Descriptor:\n          bLength                 9\n          bDescriptorType        33\n          bcdHID               1.11\n          bCountryCode            0 Not supported\n          bNumDescriptors         1\n          bDescriptorType        34 Report\n          wDescriptorLength      57\n         Report Descriptors: \n           ** UNAVAILABLE **\n      Endpoint Descriptor:\n        bLength                 7\n        bDescriptorType         5\n        bEndpointAddress     0x81  EP 1 IN\n        bmAttributes            3\n          Transfer Type            Interrupt\n          Synch Type               None\n          Usage Type               Data\n        wMaxPacketSize     0x0008  1x 8 bytes\n        bInterval               4\n    Interface Descriptor:\n      bLength                 9\n      bDescriptorType         4\n      bInterfaceNumber        1\n      bAlternateSetting       0\n      bNumEndpoints           1\n      bInterfaceClass         3 Human Interface Device\n      bInterfaceSubClass      1 Boot Interface Subclass\n      bInterfaceProtocol      2 Mouse\n      iInterface              0 \n        HID Device Descriptor:\n          bLength                 9\n          bDescriptorType        33\n          bcdHID               1.11\n          bCountryCode            0 Not supported\n          bNumDescriptors         1\n          bDescriptorType        34 Report\n          wDescriptorLength     223\n         Report Descriptors: \n           ** UNAVAILABLE **\n      Endpoint Descriptor:\n        bLength                 7\n        bDescriptorType         5\n        bEndpointAddress     0x82  EP 2 IN\n        bmAttributes            3\n          Transfer Type            Interrupt\n          Synch Type               None\n          Usage Type               Data\n        wMaxPacketSize     0x000a  1x 10 bytes\n        bInterval               1\n    Interface Descriptor:\n      bLength                 9\n      bDescriptorType         4\n      bInterfaceNumber        2\n      bAlternateSetting       0\n      bNumEndpoints           1\n      bInterfaceClass         3 Human Interface Device\n      bInterfaceSubClass      0 No Subclass\n      bInterfaceProtocol      0 None\n      iInterface              0 \n        HID Device Descriptor:\n          bLength                 9\n          bDescriptorType        33\n          bcdHID               1.11\n          bCountryCode            0 Not supported\n          bNumDescriptors         1\n          bDescriptorType        34 Report\n          wDescriptorLength     319\n         Report Descriptors: \n           ** UNAVAILABLE **\n      Endpoint Descriptor:\n        bLength                 7\n        bDescriptorType         5\n        bEndpointAddress     0x83  EP 3 IN\n        bmAttributes            3\n          Transfer Type            Interrupt\n          Synch Type               None\n          Usage Type               Data\n        wMaxPacketSize     0x0020  1x 32 bytes\n        bInterval               1\nDevice Status:     0x0000\n  (Bus Powered)\n\nIs there a way to do this for any other keyboard?\n\nA: Just press Fn-Capslock.

Have a look at the code:\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"Eneter 1 for UID and 2 for LOGNAME\" choice\nif [ $choice -eq 1 ]\nthen\n        read -p \"Enter UID:  \" uid\n        logname=`cat /etc/passwd | grep $uid | cut -f1 -d:`\nelse\n        read -p \"Enter Logname:  \" logname\nfi\nnot=`ps -au$logname | grep -c bash`\necho  \"The number of terminals opened by $logname are $not\"\n\nThis code is used to find out the number of terminals opened by a user on the same PC.\nNow there are two users logged on, say x and y. I am currently logged in as y and there are 3 terminals open in user x. If I execute this code in y using different ways as mentioned above the results are :\n$ ./file.sh\nThe number of terminals opened by x are 3\n\n$ bash file.sh\nThe number of terminals opened by x are 5\n\n$ sh file.sh\nThe number of terminals opened by x are 3\n\n$ source file.sh\nThe number of terminals opened by x are 4\n\n$ . ./file.sh\nThe number of terminals opened by x are 4\n\nNote: I passed 1 and uid 1000 to all these executables.\nNow can you please explain the differences among all these?\n\nA: The only major difference is between sourcing and executing a script. source foo.sh will source it and all the other examples you show are executing. In more detail:\n\n*\n\n*./file.sh\nThis will execute a script called file.sh that is in the current directory (./). Normally, when you run command, the shell will look through the directories in your $PATH for an executable file called command. If you give a full path, such as /usr/bin/command or ./command, then the $PATH is ignored and that specific file is executed.\n\n\n*../file.sh\nThis is basically the same as ./file.sh except that instead of looking in the current directory for file.sh, it is looking in the parent directory (../).\n\n\n*sh file.sh\nThis equivalent to sh ./file.sh. As above, it will run the script called file.sh in the current directory. The difference is that you are explicitly running it with the sh shell. On Ubuntu systems, that is dash and not bash. Usually, scripts have a shebang line that gives the program they should be run as. Calling them with a different one overrides that. For example:\n $ cat foo.sh\n #!/bin/bash  \n ## The above is the shebang line, it points to bash\n ps h -p $$ -o args='' | cut -f1 -d' '  ## This will print the name of the shell\n\nThat script will simply print the name of the shell used to run it. Let's see what it returns when called in different ways:\n $ bash foo.sh\n bash\n $ sh foo.sh \n sh\n $ zsh foo.sh\n zsh\n\nSo, calling calling a script with shell script will override the shebang line (if present) and run the script with whatever shell you tell it.\n\n\n*source file.sh or . file.sh\nThis is called, surprisingly enough, sourcing the script. The keyword source is an alias to the shell builtin . command. This is a way of executing the script within the current shell. Normally, when a script is executed, it is run in its own shell which is different than the current one. To illustrate:\n $ cat foo.sh\n #!/bin/bash\n foo=\"Script\"\n echo \"Foo (script) is $foo\"\n\nNow, if I set the variable foo to something else in the parent shell and then run the script, the script will print a different value of foo (because it is also set within the script) but the value of foo in the parent shell will be unchanged:\n $ foo=\"Parent\"\n $ bash foo.sh \n Foo (script) is Script  ## This is the value from the script's shell\n $ echo \"$foo\"          \n Parent                  ## The value in the parent shell is unchanged\n\nHowever, if I source the script instead of executing it, it will be run in the same shell so the value of foo in the parent will be changed:\n $ source ./foo.sh \n Foo (script) is Script   ## The script's foo\n $ echo \"$foo\" \n Script                   ## Because the script was sourced, \n                          ## the value in the parent shell has changed\n\nSo, sourcing is used in the few cases where you want a script to affect the shell you are running it from. It is typically used to define shell variables and have them available after the script finishes.\n\nWith all that in mind, the reason you get different answers is, first of all, that your script does not do what you think it does. It counts the number of times that bash appears in the output of ps. This is not the number of open terminals, it is the number of running shells (in fact, it isn't even that, but that's another discussion). To clarify, I simplified your script a little to this:\n#!/bin/bash\nlogname=terdon\nnot=`ps -au$logname | grep -c bash`\necho  \"The number of shells opened by $logname is $not\"\n\nAnd run it in the various ways with only a single terminal open:\n\n*\n\n*Direct launching, ./foo.sh.\n $ ./foo.sh\n The number of shells opened by terdon is 1\n\nHere, you are using the shebang line. This means that the script is executed directly by whatever is set there. This affects the way that the script is shown in the output of ps. Instead of being listed as bash foo.sh, it will only be shown as foo.sh which means that your grep will miss it. There are actually 3 bash instances running: the parent process, the bash running the script and another one which runs the ps command. This last is important, launching a command with command substitution (`command` or $(command)) results in a copy of the parent shell being launched and that runs the command. Here, however, none of these are shown because of the way that ps shows its output.\n\n\n*Direct launching with explicit (bash) shell\n $ bash foo.sh \n The number of shells opened by terdon is 3\n\nHere, because you're running with bash foo.sh, the output of ps will show bash foo.sh and be counted. So, here we have the parent process, the bash running the script and the cloned shell (running the ps) all shown because now ps will show each of them because your command will include the word bash.\n\n\n*Direct launching with a different shell (sh)\n $ sh foo.sh\n The number of shells opened by terdon is 1\n\nThis is different because you are running the script with sh and not bash. Therefore, the only bash instance is the parent shell where you launched your script. All the other shells mentioned above are being run by sh instead.\n\n\n*Sourcing (either by . or source, same thing)\n $ . ./foo.sh \n The number of shells opened by terdon is 2\n\nAs I explained above, sourcing a script causes it to run in the same shell as the parent process. However, a separate subshell is started to launch the ps command and that brings the total to two.\n\nAs a final note, the correct way to count running processes is not to parse ps but to use pgrep. All of these problems would have been avoided had you just run\npgrep -cu terdon bash\n\nSo, a working version of your script that always prints the right number is (note the absence of command substitution):\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nuser=\"terdon\"\n\nprintf \"Open shells:\"\npgrep -cu \"$user\" bash\n\nThat will return 1 when sourced and 2 (because a new bash will be launched to run the script) for all other ways of launching. It will still return 1 when launched with sh since the child process is not bash.\n", "Q: Slow Ubuntu desktop I'm new for linux, but I had some occasion to use different versions of it on other PCs or live-CD on my own PC.\nYesterday I decided to normally install Ubuntu on my desktop computer after several sucks with Windows 7.\nMy problem is, that the installed system is very slow, slow response time (destop search delayes 1-2 seconds when I type characters!), the videos (in youtube) are slow (others not yet working), etc. ANd the window in the Gnome/Kde (default) environment is slow by moving, resizing, opening, closing, etc. \nThe system has following parameters:\n\n\n*\n\n*Amd X2 processor (64bit) dual core at 2.3 Ghz\n\n*2 Gb system memory (therof 1,8 Gb usable due to integrated AMD/ATI X1200 series video card)\n\n*Corsair SSD accelarator (used as single SSD without HDD), read / write is about 200/ 150 Mb/sec.\n\n\nDefault install and updates from internet was done. The processor use in average is about 70-95% each, without running nothing. In system monitor I see a kind of graphic program running and consuming 30-50% CPU time in average, if I close this the desktop tray and icons disappers and CPU useage fall back ca 20-30% per core each (but nothing works after it).\nWhat could be the problem? How I could fix it?  Now this Ubuntu is slower on this computer as a Windows 7 on a 10 years laptop.... Ubuntu version is 14.04, the latest.\nI checked a kind of system properties and drivers panel, it is said up to date.\nThank you for your help!\n\nA: Although you've got a 64-bit processor, if you're only running 2Gb of RAM it might be worth trying the 32-bit version of Ubuntu?\n\nA: Disable automatic startup of any services that are not needed (or even remove the package completely).\nA lot of packages startup services automatically. These services then use memory and CPU even they are hardly ever used. It is better in this case, to stop those services, or take them out of autostart, and start them up only if they are needed.\nTo remove applications from starting up on 10.04,go to System > Preferences > Startup Applications (may be slightly different on other versions)\nOn 12.04, you can go select the startup applications by clicking on the Dash Icon. Then, type startup and select \"startup applications\".\n\nAnd just unmark the apps you don't need. But be sure about it, don't just remove apps you don't know. If you are not sure about one, leave it that way. A google search or new question here about specific programs will help.\n\nA: I would suggest you to try Lubuntu, which is designed for low-spec hardware.\nAnd as Duck Hunt said, it would be better to use a 32-bits version.\n", "Q: Open a file at a certain position and read one byte in bash Since two persons already voted to close this post, I'll try to make the question as clear as possible. A file on a physical device is represented as a binary sequence. That being said, what I need to do is to check the differences between the representations of two files at a such level (i.e. I need to compare the differences between multiple bytes on the same position across two different files), and to output such differences in a bash script.\nExample:\nfile1: 00000000 01010101 10101010 11001100 00110011\n\nfile2: 00000000 01010101 01010101 00110011 00110011\n\nThe script should output:\ndifferences: Byte 3 (file 1: 01010101; file2 10101010), Byte 4 (file1: 11001100; file 2: 00110011)\n\nOr something along these lines.\nSo the first thing I need to do in order to accomplish this is to be at least able to open a file at a certain position and to read one byte and to output/store such byte. I could write a C program to do that, but is there a way to do this within bash?\n\nA: You can try cmp. It will compare two files byte by byte. \nFrom man cmp:\ncmp - compare two files byte by byte\n\nAlthough the number of lines must be equals on two files. Also note that cmp will point to the first difference only, to point to the next differences you can skip specific bytes from the start. \n$ cat foo \nthis is\na test\n$ cat bar\nthis\nis a test\n$ cmp foo bar \nfoo bar differ: byte 5, line 1\n$ cmp -b foo bar \nfoo bar differ: byte 5, line 1 is  40    12 ^J\n\nTo print the differing byte values use cmp -l, from man cmp:\n   -l, --verbose\n          output byte numbers and differing byte values\n\n\nA: You can try with vimdiff:\nvimdiff -b file1 file2\n\n\n", "Q: DNS Resolution Problem on Ubuntu 14.4 LTS I have a Windows 8 host machine running VirtualBox and a running a Ubuntu 14.4 LTS Virtual  Machine.\nIn the Ubuntu VM, I can access and resolve DNS for every external site (Ex.: www.google.com) and I can resolve intranet sites by first name, ex.: anothermachine.\nIf I use the full qualified domain name, like anothermachine.mywindowsdomain.local, which is valid on the windows, this name can't be resolved inside the Ubuntu VM.\nThis box was created by vagrant.\nThis box is using NetworkManager.\nI'm using ping to check if the host name is being resolved.

How can I fix it?\n\nA: So we're looking at a Sony Viao laptop inbuilt camera; you need to be a member of \"video\" group to access it, or run cheese as root - a less good idea - and you may need to add a driver.\nFirst, I would check that /dev/video0 exists; if it does, you probably have a driver & need permissions; otherwise you need to install a driver.\nI found a nice link to driver details regarding the issues around this device - have a look at this, install the drivers it points to (but make sure you read it, don't just install the first thing!), & let us know how it goes?\n", "Q: copy several lines from one file to another I would like to use grep in order to copy from one file to another all lines that are between lines /protein_id= untill the end of the protein sequence shown.

What is unchanging is that the sequence is given in capital letters and ends with a \". Is it possible with grep? \n\nA: pcregrep is a grep utility that uses perl 5 compatible regexes. Perl-style regexps have many useful features that the standard POSIX ones don't. This is basically the same as grep but with a different regexp syntax.\nsudo apt-get install pcregrep  \npcregrep -M .*'/protein_id=.*(\\n|.)*\\\"' path/to/input-file \n\n/protein_id is the start search term and \" is the end search term.\nHere is a generalized example of a command for doing a multiline search for all lines that are between a start search term and an end search term:  \npcregrep -M .*'START-SEARCH-TERM.*(\\n|.)*END-SEARCH-TERM' path/to/SOURCE-FILE >> path/to/DESTINATION-FILE  \n\nwhere:  \n\n\n*\n\n*SOURCE-FILE is the file containing your data  \n\n*DESTINATION-FILE is the file where the results will be copied  \n\n*START-SEARCH-TERM is the start search term  \n\n*END-SEARCH-TERM is the end search term  \n\n*-M, --multiline Allow patterns to match more than one line.\n\n\nA: No, grep can't match across multiple lines. You could do it with pcregrep as shown by @karel, but not pure grep. Instead, since you know that the protein sequences will always be in UPPER CASE and will end with \", you could match that:\n\n\n*\n\n*sed\nsed -n '/\\/protein_id=/,/^\\s*[[:upper:]]\\+\"\\s*$/{p}' two_seq.txt\n\nThe sed pattern /foo/,/bar/{p} means \"print all lines between foo and bar.  The -n suppresses normal output so only the lines requested are printed. Note that the / of /protein_id= needs to be escaped (\\/) because the / is part of the match operator. The second pattern is a bit more complex, it looks for 0 or more spaces at the beginning of the line (^\\s*), then one or more upper case letters followed by a double quote ([[:upper:]]\") and then 0 or more whitespace characters until the end of the line (\\s*$).\n\n*Perl\nperl -ne 'print if m#/protein_id=# ... m#[A-Z]+\"\\s*$#' file.flat \n\nThe same idea here, the ... operator specifies a range and lines between the two patterns are printed.\n\n*awk\nawk '/\\/protein_id=/{a=1}; a==1{print} /^\\s*[[:upper:]]+\"\\s*$/{a=0}' file.flat \n\nHere, we're setting the variable a to 1 if the line matches the first pattern and to 0 if it matches the last. Then, we tell awk to print if a is 1. Since the print is called before a is set to 0 for the second pattern, this will include the line containing the second pattern  as well. \n", "Q: Error when adding torrents to deluge with python: User does not exists I am trying to write a python script to download my tv shows automatically as soon as they become available.

You should use live-cd/live-usb (maybe Ubuntu DVD) for data recovery and save files on different disk.

If someone knows why I have this error please help me...\n\n\nA: Most versions of the Linux operating system include Intel graphics drivers.  Intel recommends checking with your Linux distribution vendor or computer manufacturer for precompiled driver packages.Intel\nThe Intel Graphics Installer for Linux allows you to easily install the latest graphics and video drivers for your Intel graphics hardware. This allows you to stay current with the latest enhancements, optimizations, and fixes to the Intel® Graphics Stack to ensure the best user experience with your Intel graphics hardware. The Intel Graphics Installer for Linux is available for the latest versions of Ubuntu.\nNOTE (updated 18 March 2015 09:15 UTC-7): This release of the Graphics Installer requires Ubuntu 14.10 \"utopic\". The Graphics Installer will not function on Ubuntu 14.04 \"trusty\" and support is deprecated (see this forum announcement and this explanation).The Intel Graphics Installer for Linux \nYou can try using the older driver, but I have no way of verifying that it will work.  Depending on your needs, download the 32bit or 64bit or you can download the file from source: for 32bit or 64bit and then follow the commands below:\nwget --no-check-certificate https://download.01.org/gfx/RPM-GPG-KEY-ilg -O - | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get update\nFor 32 bit:\nsudo dpkg -i intel-linux-graphics-installer_1.0.7-0intel1_i386.deb\nOR for 64 bit:\nsudo dpkg -i intel-linux-graphics-installer_1.0.7-0intel1_amd64.deb\n\nAnd then just start the installer\nsudo intel-linux-graphics-installer\n\nI would recommend you install the file(s) using Gdebi.  To install:\nsudo apt-get install gdebi\n\n\nA: Because the installer could not work with 14.04.2 (HWE) or if a 14.04.1 user of the installer tried to install the lts-utopic mesa stack they've dropped any further support for 14.04.x\nRead here for announcement - https://01.org/linuxgraphics/node/471\nPersonally don't think the Intel installer provided anything of real value, at least here with Haswell (mobile)\nUpdates for libva & vaapi are available from several ppa's, search if interested there.\n\nA: This is how I managed to install Intel Linux graphics driver:\nFor Ubuntu 14.04 with kernel linux-image-3.16.0-30:\n\n*\n\n*Install kernel If not yet installed:\nsudo apt-get linux-image-3.16.0-30-generic linux-image-extra-3.16.0-30-generic linux-headers-3.16.0-30-generic\n\n\n\n*Remove old kernels, e.g.:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.13.0-24-generic linux-image-extra-3.13.0-24-generic linux-headers-3.13.0-24 linux-headers-3.13.0-24-generic\n\n\n\n*Add Intel Linux graphics repo:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb https://download.01.org/gfx/ubuntu/14.04/main trusty main #intel-linux-graphics-installer\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intellinuxgraphics.list'  \nwget --no-check-certificate https://download.01.org/gfx/RPM-GPG-KEY-ilg -O - | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n*Install driver:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall i915-3.16-3.13-dkms xserver-xorg-video-intel i965-va-driver intel-gpu-tools\n\nNext step might be unnecessary if backlight change works for you:\n\n\n*Add kernel param: acpi_osi=Linux instead of: acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor to linux line in /boot/grub/grub.cfg via grub-customizer.\nNext step might be unnecessary if backlight change works for you:\n\n\n*Create file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf with content:\nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier \"card0\"\n        Driver \"Intel\"\n        Option \"Backlight\" \"intel_backlight\"\n        BusID \"PCI:0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\n\n\n*Update initramfs:\nsudo update-initramfs -u -k all\n\nAnd it works after reboot.\n", "Q: Fault Tolerance With MAAS and juju I have juju installed on the MAAS server, is it possible to do fault tolerance ? If is it possible, how do I apply?\n\nA: So you can model fault tolerance in both juju and MAAS. With MAAS you can set up multiple regions, while regions can be anything you want, they typically refer to an entire isolated power+networked area. (Imagine a region being a datacenter). If you configure MAAS in this way using it with juju becomes easy.\nAfter running juju bootstrap you can run juju ensure-ha which will create a cluster of bootstrap nodes. By doing so, you'll have bootstrap node in an high availability configuration. You can even have the extra bootstrap nodes setup in competing regions in MAAS so even if one region goes dark your deployment is still available.\n\n\n*\n\n*See this link for more info on HA mode: https://jujucharms.com/docs/latest/juju-ha\nNow, for when deploying with Juju, you can deploy multiple units of a service and have those units deployed on competing regions (just like with the bootstrap node) this ensures that if a region goes dark your deployment will still be operational.\n", "Q: No Dropbox app on Ubuntu BQ mobile I use my mobile phone, mainly, for work purposes.

There are about 150 files like these.

The following screenshot explains how to do it:\n\nI know it's not the way to do it in the terminal as you requested, but this is an alternate way of doing it that you may find easier because you can browse to the files to be renamed in the pyRenamer window instead of typing the path.\nIn Ubuntu 18.04 and later pyRenamer has been replaced by either GPRename or the Smart File Renamer snap package (sudo snap install smart-file-renamer).\n\nA: Use mmv command (Install it by sudo apt-get install mmv):\nmmv -n '*.zip*' '#1.zip'\n\nFirst * matches everything before .zip and second * matches everything after .zip and they become as group of matches with back-reference #1 and #2 respectively. And we only keep the first one with .zip at the end.\nNote: With using -n option, mmv command runs as dry, so remove it to perform actual renaming.\n\nOr through combination of find and mv commands:\nfind source/dir -type f -name '*.zip*' -exec sh -c 'echo mv \"$1\" \"${1%.*}.zip\"' sh_mv {} \\;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*the source/dir specifies the path of source directory.\n\n*-type f searches files only.\n\n*-name '*.zip*' find those type of files that their names are like '*.zip*'\n\n*{} represent the current file.\n\n*Complete of \"${1%.*}.zip\", stripes file extension and append .zip to file name.\n\n*So mv \"$1\" \"${1%.*}.zip\" renames the current file to *.zip.\n\n\nNote: Remove echo command after you ensure about dry run.\n", "Q: WIFI Drivers for ubuntu 14.04 I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 and I am not getting  wifi signals.Can any one help me with this problem as I have no experience of using Ubuntu?\n\nA: My guess is that you have a broadcom wireless.

I have the Libreoffice PPA added for the latest version of LibreOffice writer. (I have the latest version installed to be able to print to PDF with comments on the side.)\nI see there are a couple of posts on this already. However, they are all at least a couple of years old.  I've looked into it, and I do not see where they've added this feature to change the background color of comments. So, I am assuming it is not a configuration option.  However, I am curious if I can access the LibreOffice writer program files in some location to change this color. For example, in the past in OS X, I was able to change the background color of the native Notes app from yellow to very light gray. In this case, I only needed to change the color of a png file. Or, I am curious if there is a hexadecimal or RGB number in a file that could be changed. Much thanks in advance. Any input is appreciated.\n\nA: I have LibreOffice version 4.4.2.2 in Xubuntu 14.04. I noticed that I can change the background color of the comments to my liking if I go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > User Data. There I would add myself as an owner with a certain name (for example, my first and last name, only my first name, etc.). Then I would close and add a comment. Each time there was a new name, there was a new background color for the comment. I did this until I came across a color I liked. Then I stuck with that name. I think the different colors may be coming from the Xfce theme colors I have installed, although I am not 100% sure.

Best shot is to execute this command sudo apt-get install phpunit.  Always use this command as it'll save your headache.\nBut if you are installing a package that isn't available in apt-get repository, then you will want to configure the package for a specific path.  ./configure --path=/usr or ./configure --path=/usr/share.\nAvoid using /usr/local.\nHope you tackle this down.

I'd like to configure Ubuntu to use that address. Most of the links I am finding are how to disable IPv6. So I'm not sure how to get it working.

You can't run 6rd across a NAT device; it needs to run from the edge of the network since the tunnel encodes a globally routable IPv4 border relay. This allows fully stateless tunneling, but precludes the use of RFC1918 addressed tunnel endpoints (border relays).\nUnless the Ubuntu device is acting as a router with a global IPv4 address, this will not work. You need a router that supports 6rd at the network edge.\n\nA: Comecast have explained how to use OpenWRT to set up 6RD.

I want to call my C++ program in Bash file. \nMy program is myProg.cpp:\n#include<iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main()\n{\n   cout<<\"Salam! World\"<<endl;\nreturn 0;\n}\n\nAnd my bash file is myBash.sh. How can I call my above .cpp program in myBash.sh file?\n\nA: Since your real goal seems to be to automate whatever needs to be done to run your program, I suggest a different approach. Instead of writing a shell script, you can use a makefile. If you like, you can write a rule in your makefile for running your executable once it is built. You will then have two files--your C++ source code file and your makefile--and you will be able to run a single command that efficiently:\n\n\n*\n\n*Builds or rebuilds your C++ program, if and only if necessary.\n\n*Runs your program.\n\n\nThe subsequent sections of this post explain why you can't call a .cpp file directly (but must create an executable from it first); how to install make, how to use it, and what it's doing behind the scenes; and how to avoid common pitfalls. But in case you want to get a feeling of what this approach looks like before delving in, you will run make run after putting this0 in Makefile:\nall: myProg\n\nrun: all\n    ./myProg\n\nI like that better for this purpose than a shell script, and I think you might, too.\nBackground\nUnlike some interpreted languages like Python and Bash, C++ is a compiled language.1 Programs written in C++ must be built before they are run. (Building is also sometimes called compiling, though compiling more properly refers to one of the steps of building.) You cannot run a C++ source code file; it must instead be compiled into object code2, in this case machine language. The object files must then be linked together, and even if there is only one, it must still be linked to any shared libraries it uses. Linking produces an executable which may be run.\nIn short, you have to build your program before you run it, the first time. Before subsequent runs it need not be rebuilt, unless you have changed its source code, in which case you must build it again if you want your changes to be reflected in the program that runs. The make utility is designed specifically for this sort of situation, where one wishes to perform actions conditionally depending on whether or not, and when, they have already been done.\nGetting make\nYou may already have the make command installed; try running it to find out. If it is installed, you'll see something like:\n$ make\nmake: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.\nTo get make you can install the make  package, but I suggest installing build-essential  which provides a number of other handy tools. (You might've installed build-essential  to get g++, which is one way you might already have make.) You can use the Software Center to install it or run the command:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nmake Without a Makefile\nTo see how make works, I suggest running it without a makefile first, passing it the basename of your source code file:\n$ make myProg\ng++     myProg.cpp   -o myProg\n$ ./myProg\nSalam! World\nOn subsequent runs, make compares the modification timestamps (mtimes) on the input and output files, and won't rebuild your program unnecessarily:\n$ make myProg\nmake: 'myProg' is up to date.\nWhen you change myProg.cpp, that updates its modification timestamp, so make will know to rebuild it. (You can also update a file's timestamp with the touch command, if you need or want to force any output files depending on it to be rebuilt. And of course, deleting the output files will also ensure they be rebuilt when you run make--just don't delete the wrong file!)\n$ touch myProg.cpp\n$ make myProg\ng++     myProg.cpp   -o myProg\nHow does make know what to do when you run make myProg?\n\n\n*\n\n*The myProg argument to make is called a target.\n\n*Targets are often, but not always, the names of files to be created. Targets may be defined explicitly in a makefile.\n\n*When a target is not defined in the makefile or (as in this case) there is no makefile, make looks for input (i.e., source code) files named in such a way as to suggest they are intended for building the target.\n\n*make infers what utility and syntax to use in building a file from its suffix (in this case, .cpp).\n\n\nAll this can be customized, but in simple cases like this often doesn't need to be.\nCreating a Makefile to Automate Building and Running Your Program\nTo automate more complex tasks than building a program from a single source code file, such as if there are multiple input files or (more applicably to your immediate needs) actions you wish done besides running the compiler, you can create a makefile to define targets for make and specify how they depend on other targets.\nThe first target defined in a makefile is the default target: it is what make attempts to build when run with no command-line arguments (i.e., when you run just make, and not something like make myProg).\nThe usual way to use makefiles is to create a directory containing all source code files (and any other files) used to build your program, as well as the makefile, which is usually called Makefile. By that name, make will automatically find it.\nTo create a makefile you can use to run myProg and that will automatically build it first when necessary, put myProg.cpp in new, otherwise empty directory. Create another text file in that directory called Makefile.\nYou can use any text editor for this, but the recipe for a rule--the commands listed under it that will be run to make its target--must must be indented with tabs rather than spaces.3 So if your text editor is currently configured to indent with spaces when you press Tab, you should change this.\nFor example, in Gedit or Pluma, you would go into Edit > Preferences, click the Editor tab, and ensure Insert spaces instead of tabs is unchecked:\n\nMany editors default to indenting with tabs and not spaces, so if you haven't changed this setting before, it may already be set correctly for makefiles.\nOnce you're in your editor and (if necessary) configured it to indent with tabs, put this in:\nall: myProg\n\nrun: all\n    ./myProg\n\nIf you copy and paste this, it will be wrong because spaces will be coped in even though your text editor doesn't make them when you press Tab. (This has to do with the way Ask Ubuntu displays code.) But you can simply remove the four spaces preceding ./myProg and press Tab to make a tab in their place.\nSome text editors default to showing a tab as 8 spaces, or some other number. That's fine.\nWhat That Makefile Does, and How to Use It\nUse the command:\n\n\n*\n\n*make, to build the program unless it is already built and the executable is current to the source code. Or,\n\n*make run, to run the program, building it first if necessary (i.e., if there is no current executable).\n\n\nThis makefile defines two targets: all and run.\n\n\n*\n\n*The all target has no recipe of its own, but depends on the myProg target. This target is not explicitly defined, so it implicitly tells make to attempt building myProg from whatever source code files are available for it in the current directory. (See the make Without a Makefile section above for details.)\nBecause all is the first target explicitly defined in Makefile, it will be built when make is run from the directory in which Makefile resides. Thus we have set things up so running make by itself is equivalent to running make all.\n\n*The run target runs the program. Its recipe consists of the command that does so, ./myProg. run declares the all target as a dependency. This makes it so that when you run make run, myProg gets rebuilt if the current myProg executable is not current (or does not yet exist).\nWe could just as well have made run depend on myProg rather than on all, but we would still have needed the explicit all target (or an equivalent target of a different name) to prevent run from being the default target. Of course, if you want your program built and run even when you run make by itself, you could do this.\nAnother benefit of depending on the all target is in case later there are more actions that must be taken before your program ought to be run. You could then add a recipe to the rule for all.\nUsing the makefile to run the program looks like this, if it needs to be built:\n$ cd myProg/\n$ make run\ng++     myProg.cpp   -o myProg\n./myProg\nSalam! World\nOr this, if it doesn't need to be built:\n$ make run\n./myProg\nSalam! World\nAnd if you just want to make sure the program is built (since the source code file was last modified) without running the program, simply run make with no arguments:\n$ make      # Here, I run make and myProg isn't current.\ng++     myProg.cpp   -o myProg\n$ make      # Running \"make\" again after \"make\" or \"make run\" does nothing.\nmake: Nothing to be done for 'all'.\n(make myProg will still work, too.)\nA Refinement: Custom Compiler Flags\nmake is an extremely powerful tool, handy for simple purposes like this but also well suited to large, complex projects. Attempting to detail all the things you can do with make would be a whole book (specifically, this one).\nBut it occurred to me you might want to see warnings from the compiler, when something doesn't prevent the build from completing but still is a potential error. These won't catch all the bugs in the programs you write, but they may catch many.\nWhen using GCC (as with the g++ command), I recommend passing at least -Wall to the compiler. This actually doesn't enable all warnings, but you can enable most of the rest with -Wextra. You may sometimes also want -pedantic. (See man gcc and 3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings in the GCC reference manual.)\nTo invoke g++ manually with these flags, you'd run:\ng++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -o myProg myProg.cpp\n\nTo make make invoke the C++ compiler (g++) with the -Wall, -Wextra, and -pedantic flags, add a CXXFLAGS= line with them to the top of Makefile.\nCXXFLAGS=-Wall -Wextra -pedantic\n\nall: myProg\n\nrun: all\n    ./myProg\n\nEven though myProg still exists and is newer than myProg.cpp, running make or make run after editing Makefile will still build the program again, because Makefile is now newer than myProg. This is a good thing, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*In this case, rebuilding the executable causes you to see warnings if there are any (there shouldn't be, for that particular program).\n\n*More generally, sometimes when you edit a makefile it's because you want different files to be produced, or to be produced with different contents. (For example, if you had added the -O3 flag for heavy optimizations or -g to make the compiler generate debug symbols, the resulting myProg executable would be different.)\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Exercise 2: Make Is Your Python Now in Learn C the Hard Way by Zed Shaw.\n\n*The GNU Make Manual, especially 2.1 What a Rule Looks Like.\n\n*A Simple Makefile Tutorial by Bruce A. Maxwell, for information on other ways to use make.\n\n*\"Using Makefiles\" (p. 15) and \"Makefiles vs. Shell Scripts\" (p. 62) in 21st Century C by Ben Klemens. Page numbers are for the first edition. (The second edition is probably better, but I only have the first edition.)\n\n\nNotes\n0: I recommend reading further to see how to make this work. But in case you want to attempt it first yourself: you must indent lines with tabs rather than spaces.\n1: Strictly speaking, virtually any programming language could be either interpreted or compiled depending on what implementations for it have been written. For some languages, both interpreters and compilers exist. However, interpreted C++ is uncommon--though not unheard of.\n2: Dividing building into compiling and linking, and calling the translation of a C++ source code file (.cc/.cpp/.cxx/.C) into object code compiling, is not the whole story. Programs in C and C++ (and some other languages) are first preprocessed. In your program, the C preprocessor replaces #include<iostream> with the contents of the <iostream> header file before actual compilation starts. And in the narrowest sense compiling converts source code into assembly language rather than object code. Many compilers (like GCC/g++) can combine compilation and assembly in a single step, and don't produce assembly code unless asked to do so.\nWhile preprocessing is a separate step, GCC and other compilers automatically run the preprocessor. Similarly, they can automatically run the linker, which is why the entire sequence of preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linkage is sometimes called \"compiling\" rather than \"building.\" (Note also that building may contain more than those steps--for example, it may involve generating resource files, running a script to configure how things will be built, etc.)\n3: You only have to indent with tabs in the makefile itself. Using a makefile doesn't impose any requirements on the way you write your C++ source code files themselves. Feel free to switch indentation back from tabs to spaces when you're working on other files.

And this is where i'm stuck.\nAlso I found this instructions:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7537008/compilation-error-while-using-librsvg\nBut those are too complicated for noob like me.\nI think my goal (to compile the only small 'svg2cairoxml.c' file) is pretty easy for experienced linux programmers. So can someone please help me to do it? Also I guess I'm doing something wrong like using wrong version of libraries or something like this.\n\nA: When a development package installs its header and/or library files in places that are not directly on the standard compiler search path, you need to specify the locations yourself explicitly. To do that on the gcc command line for example, you would use suitable -I (include path) and -L (library path) directives. You also need to tell the linker which specific libraries to link from those search paths using -l directives such as -lrsvg-2 for librsvg-2.\nSince paths and libraries can become quite complex, and vary depending on the exact platform, some development packages provide a package configuration (.pc) file that can be interrogated by the pkg-config utility to generate the appropriate directives at build time. The librsvg-dev package is one such, so to build your simple program on the command-line all that's required is\ngcc svg2cairoxml.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs librsvg-2.0`\n\nTo achieve the same within your IDE, you have a couple of options: you can either run\npkg-config --cflags librsvg-2.0\n\nand\npkg-config --libs librsvg-2.0\n\nin a terminal and copy the resulting output into the appropriate compiler and linker settings boxes or, following this answer to a similar question on StackOverflow How to setup GTK+ to develop with Code::Blocks on Ubuntu Linux, add the pkg-config command substitutions directly to the Other options tab as follows:\n\n\n", "Q: BQ E4.5 adb fails With an Ubuntu phone BQ E4.5, I have enabled the Developer mode and connected through USB.\nwhen I issue: adb devices it returns nothing and adb shell returns \"error: device not found\"\nWhether I unmount or not the device does not change anything.

During the install I've not received any error, but it took 3h to run the installer and it continued to stay on \"Creating Container:\", as reported on this image:\n\nthen \n\nit remains in this status for long time....\nafter 3hr the situation is invariable\n\nany suggestions?\n\nA: If that screenshot is any indication of the Distro you're running (Utopic) there is a known bug with apparmor that causes the single installer to fail\nhttps://github.com/Ubuntu-Solutions-Engineering/openstack-installer/issues/470\nThe relevant launchpad bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/apparmor/+bug/1408833\nYou'll want to upgrade your kernel from that proposed pocket and report to our github bug if that fixes the installer issue.\n", "Q: Disable every network permanently I have Ubuntu installed on an USB device, I need the system isolated from any network (LAN, wifi, bluetooth, etc.) permanently.\nI read a lot of suggestions but some are user-related, other disable only some networks, other are not permanent.

Depending on the device, I'd remove the network hardware or disable it in the BIOS.\n\nA: If desired, you can also completely disable the NetworkManager:\nchkconfig NetworkManager off\nchkconfig network on\nservice NetworkManager stop\nservice network start\n\n\nA: Uninstall the network manager by:\nsudo apt-get purge networkmanager\n\nYou can't get more permanent then that...\n\nA: You might want to create an upstart script that actually executes rfkill block all OR you could disable from starting any networking script in /etc/init and /etc/init.d/. For instance , every script in /etc/init/ folder has line specifying on which run-levels to run the script. By commenting that line out with # you effectively disable the script from starting and thus prevent interfaces from being brought up. There are scripts for bluetooth there as well. Look into it !\n\nA: thanks for the answers, I eventually followed this drastic solution but hopefully definitive\nsudo apt-get remove -y --purge network-manager network-manager-gnome network-manager-pptp network-manager-pptp-gnome\nsudo rm -r /var/lib/NetworkManager\nsudo rm -r /etc/NetworkManager\nsudo rm -r /etc/network\nsudo gedit /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf\n\nand in rc-sysinit.conf I replace\nstart on (filesystem and static-network-up) or failsafe-boot\n\nwith\nstart on (filesystem) or failsafe-boot\n\nto avoid boot problem\n", "Q: Unable to initialize mon0 interface When I started to recover the wifi key using reaver 1.4, after writing the command\nroot@kunjesh-Ideapad-Z570:~/reaver-1.4/src# reaver -i mon0 -b <USSID>\n\nit is giving the error\nReaver v1.4 WiFi Protected Setup Attack Tool\nCopyright (c) 2011, Tactical Network Solutions, Craig Heffner <cheffner@tacnetsol.com>\n\n[-] Failed to initialize interface 'mon0'\n[-] Failed to recover WPA key\n\nkindly help me.\n\nA: Make sure you have created the directory /etc/reaver; otherwise things won't work.\nRun sudo airmon-ng start <INTERFACE>.\nCheck that iwconfig shows the new interface (usually mon0) as being in Monitor mode. Managed will not work.\nRun aircheck-ng and turn off any processes it tells you might be bad. Afterwards, use airmon-ng stop mon0 and then airmon-ng start wlan0 to recreate the (hopefully) monitoring interface.\n\nA: Had the same problem, and after a few hours I realized that I'm not running reaver as root (run with sudo)\n\nA: mon0 is not a terribly likely name for a wireless interface.

It is possible to track a person by the unique MAC address of their wireless card.

I'm running Kubuntu 14.04 on my private laptop. When the package system updates my Linux kernel it removes the old packages, only keeping the 2 newest versions of the kernel images (and associated packages). At the moment that would be (AFAIR) 3.13.0-32 and 3.13.0-48. How do I get the package system to stop removing the old kernel images?\nI realize this will leave me with a long list of not used kernel images, but I would rather have to do the clean up myself, than risk ending up in a situation where I can't boot my laptop.\nEDIT: Based on the answer from Aaron Digulla I created a file, /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99keep-kernels, with this content:\nAPT::NeverAutoRemove\n{\n   \"^linux-image-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-image-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-headers-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-headers-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-image-extra-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-image-extra-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-signed-image-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-signed-image-*-generic$\";\n   \"^kfreebsd-image-*-generic$\";\n   \"^kfreebsd-image-*-generic$\";\n   \"^kfreebsd-headers-*-generic$\";\n   \"^kfreebsd-headers-*-generic$\";\n   \"^gnumach-image-*-generic$\";\n   \"^gnumach-image-*-generic$\";\n   \"^.*-modules-*-generic$\";\n   \"^.*-modules-*-generic$\";\n   \"^.*-kernel-*-generic$\";\n   \"^.*-kernel-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-backports-modules-.*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-backports-modules-.*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-tools-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-tools-*-generic$\";\n};\n\nBut that didn't work. Ubuntu still only keeps the 2 latest kernels.\n\nA: Pinning won't work for you since it will prevent from upgrading kernels altogether.\nLook into /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove and /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove-kernels. These files contain lists of packages which should be purged automatically. The second file is maintained by the script /etc/kernel/postinst.d/apt-auto-removal\nTo solve your problem, copy the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove-kernels into /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99keep-kernels and edit the patterns to match any version of the 11 packages in there.\nSo\n\"^linux-image-3\\.13\\.0-45-generic$\";\n\nwould become\n\"^linux-image-\";\n\nThis pattern now matches any version of the package and prevents apt from deleting them ever. The post-install script does the same thing which doesn't create a conflict - your version of the file simply matches more packages and prevents any version to be deleted automatically.\n", "Q: ia32-libs-gtk package not found Though I searched a lot and there are lots of thread about ia32-libs-gtk but nothing seems to solve the problem. \nwhen I ran \nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs-gtk\n it says unable to locate. \ni want to install  Forticlient SSL VPN  and for installing it the first step is installing ia32-libs-gtk Help me ?\n\nA: With multiarch you need to explicitly install i386 packages needed, ex.\nsudo apt-get  install libgtk2.0-0:i386\nOtherwise maybe have a look here for alt. packaging - https://hadler.me/linux/forticlient-sslvpn-deb-packages/\n\nA: I finally got an answer to my own question.\nI tested it on ubuntu 14.04 and works smoothly.\nJust run the below commands in order\nJust you need sudo rights for this\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d\n\n*sudo echo \"deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring main restricted universe multiverse\" > ia32-libs-raring.list\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n", "Q: Workspace Stopwatch?

I use a x86_64 bit Ubuntu, but whenever I try to do a live boot of any other 64 bit images like the GNOME 3.16 which was released yesterday, it does not work?\nAlso some times when I try a virtual machine of a 64 bit image, it does not work either.\nWhat is the reason for the same? What is the difference between x86_64 amd64 and 64 bit?\nMy laptop model is an Hp Pavillion dv4 1506tx.\nThe processor is 2.20 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T6600\n\nA: This may not solve exact problem, but I'll clarify the difference between x86_64, amd64 and 64-bit.\nEvery micro-processor implements an instruction set (also called instruction set architecture or ISA in short).\n64-bit ISA or 64-bit processor that the length of address bus is 64 bits. Intel/AMD have variable length instructions - they vary from 1byte to 15 bytes. So, instruction length does not determine what type(32/64-bit) processor it is.\nx86_64 is name of specific 64-bit ISA. This instruction set was released in 1999 by AMD (Advanced Micro Devices). AMD later rebranded it to amd64.\nOther 64-bit ISA different from x86_64 is IA-64 (released by Intel in 1999).\n\nA: Actually... AMD64 is the real 64 bits architecture that AMD created and intel licensed it and uses it even today (just as AMD had the license to use x86 on the 32 bit CPUs).\nx86_64 far as i know is nothing more than a 32 bit CPU that can address the extra memory that a supposed 64 bit system need (so like a 32 bit system that recognizes and uses more than 4GB of RAM).\n\nA: The Wikipedia article for x86 instruction set architectures includes this explanation of the difference between these names:\n\nIn its literature and product version names, Microsoft and Sun refer to AMD64/Intel 64 collectively as x64 in the Windows and Solaris operating systems. Linux distributions refer to it either as \"x86-64\", its variant \"x86_64\", or \"amd64\". BSD systems use \"amd64\" while macOS uses \"x86_64\".\n\n", "Q: Why is wget much faster than downloading via Chrome? I tried to download a gigabyted file where I got 200~300 kb/s in my browser but the same link worked in wget over 6MB/s...Is there some magic behind the command?\n\nA: wget normally works a little bit faster than Chrome because it's a terminal program so there is less resource usage overhead, but that would not explain such a large difference in download speeds between wget and Chrome. You probably have an issue with downloading that large file in Chrome. wget is a better tool than Chrome for downloading large files, if you don't have to solve a captcha in order to download the file.\n\nA: The discrepancies in speed that you are seeing can easily be explained by variable server load. Although I have seen high rates of throughput with wget, I've also seen relatively low rates. However, I've never seen a discrepancy in speed of the magnitude you mention, so I'm certain there is another variable that you are not considering. My experience tells me that the load on the server or network segment(s) you were using was higher when you got the lower rates and lower when  you got the higher ones. This assumes that the tests were done on the same hardware using the same network interface. Different hardware can provide huge discrepancies in results. For example, you'll never get anywhere near the throughput on a netbook with a 100Mbps interface (or WiFi) that you'll get from a well built desktop with a Gigabit interface. Real world tests prove that properly designed and built hardware can provide throughput 30 times or more throughput off the same server on the same network segment. There are more variables involved than one might think. The speed of the storage media, the network interface, the bus(FSB) and even the RAM speed can have an impact on throughput. As others have mentioned the software itself CAN impact the speed of transmission, but the difference is usually minimal in my experience.\n\nA: In my case I was attempting to download android studio for windows (1.1GB).  After about 1 minute of downloading chrome was reporting 18min to go.\nI cancelled that download, logged onto my debian box and used wget, which pulled it in 1m55s.\nMy laptop is over wifi however, the debian box is hard wired to the router.\n", "Q: 1>How does one create a hotspot on Ubuntu Touch ? 2> use a VPN...? As per the title....has anyone achieved this yet? It seems that it is difficult to custom config anything on the touch unless you change over to read/write....but then you are cutting off OTA updates....kind of a vicious circle.... as turning OTA back on after changing config ...will probably overwrite changes on next image update.....hmmm....\nAnd next point ...VPN's not supported out of the box?  It seems that two pretty much core functions are not supported. \nAny tips/hacks/ideas....welcome..\nThanks in advance.\nAlex\nTouch Nexus 4 Devel-prop - latest \nubuntu 14:10 Sony Vaio \n\nA: There is no support for a wireless hotspot on the Ubuntu phone images yet. Nor is there support for VPNs. Both will be available at some point in a future over-the-air update.\nIn the meantime, it should be possible to use the phone for USB tethering, by running android-gadget-service enable rndis in the Terminal app on the phone, or via adb.\nFor VPN, you could possibly install the OpenVPN packages under your home directory on the phone, and manually enable/disable the VPN via the terminal, as there is no UI for it yet.\n", "Q: Could we use Juju without MAAS?

I've got an Ubuntu Touch smartphone. Is it possible to install f.e. sshfs with apt-get install? Or what can I do else?\n\nA: The phone images are designed to be upgraded via pre-installed images, so they are read-only and apt-get is not supported on them. Instead, packages targeted for the phone images are shipped through the app store, which you can access by scrolling to the bottom of the Apps scope, and tapping on the Store icon.\nI'm not sure what you're trying to get out of having sshfs installed on the phone, but it is not packaged for the phone.\nIf you really need to use apt-get to install packages on the device for some reason, the best way to do so is by creating a chroot underneath the /home/phablet directory somewhere, and installing any necessary packages you might need to run, inside that chroot.\n\nA: You need to make the phone read-write. This will almost certainly break system image updates, but you can do it.\nFirst, enable developer mode. Install phablet-tools on a desktop computer, connect the phone over USB to it. Check you can use phablet-shell to get into the device (you need to have the screen unlocked).\nThen, you can do phablet-config writable-image.\nThen, once the phone has rebooted, sudo apt-get install should work.\nKeep in mind the repositories you'll be using are not the main ones, you might need to switch.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Why is my non-system HDD cannot spin down?

My assupmtion was maybe the SMART functionality wakes it up. But even if I turned off smart (smartctl set -off /dev/sdb) the hdd was still woken. Finally I stoped the udevd service, but the parted process still woke it up. And anyway udevd is probably essential for the system. Of course gparted is not running in the background. I also try to add the noatime option into fstab, but it neither helped. I run out off ideas, and I couldnt find anymore tipps on the internet. So I would really appriciate some aimed help, to get a solution.\nFor about some month I havent had this problem, so I assume it could be even a bug. Maybe of the udev/parted processes, or I dont know. Should you need any more information for investigation I can gladly post more. And please dont come with umount of the HDD, I would like to have an automated solution as it is orignially intended to work.

If you can uninstall it, I envy you; if it is depended on by a bunch of GUI programs that you depend on (KDE4 for me) here is my workaround:\nAssuming you have set idle timeouts for your harddisks (hdparm -S), see if sudo killall -SIGSTOP udisksd now lets them spin down by themselves. You don't even need to unmount them – it is enough that they aren't accessed. Which, if your filesystems are mounted noatime, and you have plenty of pagecache, just means you must not write to them.\nIf that works, you will soon discover certain situations where your GUI programs will hang. In my experience, the KDE4 startup and Open/Save dialogs will hang. The solution is to simply unfreeze the daemon again: sudo killall -SIGCONT udisksd. Thankfully, this will NOT spin up your disks again, otherwise this trick would be worthless! They will however all spin up whenever the daemon is started, which is why stopping it is useless. As a matter of convenience, you may want a cron job doing the freezing, so you can concentrate on the unfreezing – you will have to do this a lot…\n", "Q: cannot exec 'anything' : no such file or directory screen I’m running some call of duty game servers with screen. \nI have a start.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nuser=cabe\ngame=cod\nverision=cod1.5\nserver=xxx.xx.xxx:28970\nmod=\nip=xxx.xx.xxx\nport=28970\npunkbuster=1\nslots=20\n\n\n# Don't Change This\n. /mnt/utilities/files/games/cod/1.5/files/extra/scripts/startup/cod/start_cod\n\nand it is linked up to this\ncd /home/$user/$game/$verision/$server ./stop.sh screen -A -m -d -S $port /home/$user/$game/$verision/$server/cod_lnxded +set net_ip $ip\n+set net_port $port +set dedicated 2 +set sv_punkbuster $punkbuster +set sv_maxclients $slots +exec myserver.cfg +set fs_basepath /home/$user/$game/$verision/$server +set fs_homepath /home/$user/$game/$verision/$server\n\nNow every time I run start.sh, it gives me:\nCannot exec 'quit': No such file in directory\n\nSo I went and see, if I did something wrong in my stop script, but I can't see what’s wrong.

So when you run the screen -S $port -X quit command, it looks like ($port is not defined so it results in a blank string):\nscreen -S -X quit\n\nScreen interprets this as \"set the session name to -X, then run the quit command inside a shell\".\nIf you had the port, it would look like:\nscreen -S 28970 -X quit\n\nthis means \"send the quit screen action to the session named 28970\", which is what you actually want.\nSo in order to fix it, simply ensure your stop.sh script has port defined.\nLearn more about screen command line parameters:\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html#Invoking-Screen\n", "Q: Getting Conky to run?

But this is VERY hacky and does not survives reboots, nor resists basic use of the laptop (like switching wifi on and off).\nI have tried setting the option asus_nb_wmi wapf=X to 0,1,2,3, or 4 (in the file /etc/modprobe.d/asus_nb_wmi.conf) seeing no change in the behavior.\nI also tried blacklisting btusb, since it might be loading too early (as suggested by Jeremy31: echo \"blacklist btusb\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/btusb.conf).

I really do not know what is going on. First what is weird is that installation downloads image form the region controller instead of the cluster controller. The result is that installation process takes awfully long. Actually this is why we installed a standalone cluster controller. After that I receive a couple of \"Failed to query node's BMC\" before Deployment is marked failed.\nAnyone can help on this issue?\nSo far my findings are installation works neither on a second cluster interface (https://askubuntu.com/questions/569306/issue-with-maas-and-second-cluster-interface) neither on standalone cluster controller, which is pretty disappointing (and this maybe because region controller is used during installation when it would seem logical that cluster controller is used instead)...\nMy version of maas is  1.7.1+bzr3341-0ubuntu1~trusty1.\nHelp would be very much appreciated.\nEdit\nTo give more details, the architecture is as per below. I also give the event list. I wonder too if it is important that domain name can be resolved as in the event I can see the given domain name of the node (in other words node are provisioned with domain name name.maas but are also edited to be registered as name.domain). With a basic Region Controller and Cluster Controller this works well and I do no see why it would not work with a second interface or a standalone Cluster Controller. I hope this is not too confusing. \nSite 1: MAAS Region Controller + MAAS Cluster Controller with two interfaces/subnets. I am unable to provision nodes on the second interface (the one not defined for the API).\nSite 2: MAAS Cluster Controller with one interface/subnet. Cluster is registered with Region Controller and images have been downloaded from Region Controller after name resolution correctly implemented (I still do not know why this is needed to have the cluster in sync with images). Without pserv.yaml updated with generator using the IP of the MAAS Region Controller (see my other question https://askubuntu.com/questions/601092/issue-with-maas-cluster-controller-no-enlistment), it is impossible to have nodes enlisted. With it enlistment works fine, commissioning too but subsequent deployment seem to download what is needed from Region Controller).

However, maybe the IP in preseed should be the one of the Controller interface on the subnet.\nMany thanks in advance for your help.\nEdit\nAfter giving up for some weeks I have upgraded to 1.8. Same thing happen and I cannot understand why. Enlistment works with remote cluster controller but after commissioning installation uses files from the region/cluster controller not from the remote cluster controller and node is flagged \"Deployment failed\".\nHelp would be appreciated.  \n\nA: Hurray.\nI finally resolved the issue with my remote cluster controller just after editing my post and this by accident.\nThe solution is as following.\nWhen creating the remote cluster controller (named Cluster 2 in my case) add a DNS zone different that for the cluster controller associated with the region controller (named Cluster 1 in my case). By default it is maas so change it to maas2 (so maas for Cluster 1 and maas2 for Cluster 2).\nAfter new node is enlisted when editing for Cluster pick \"maas2\" (in the list box instead of having maas and mass you have maas and maas2). This way to name cluster with zone name is odd to me but this is the way it works.\nNow commission and then install. Boom, installation picks the right cluster controllers and only takes few seconds and most important is successful.\nI hope this helps somebody as it really blocked me for several weeks.\nI still need to find how to have the remote cluster controller acting as a name server as for now the region controller acts as a name serve although the zone.maas2 file seem to indicate the remote cluster controller as a name server too. \n", "Q: How to highlight second vowel from every word in a file?

You can try to see if compiling and installing it as explained in https://askubuntu.com/a/390795/16395 helps. \nGiven the release notes, you can now omit the cumbersome \"cp\" to install the thing and you must use make after the configure stage; I quote (I did not test it, my 480 works ok out-of-the-box): \n\nThis release also slightly changes the build process. Whereas before\n  it was possible to configure and build the driver with a single\n  command, you must now run ./configure and make as seperate steps.\n  Along with this, it is now possible to run make install to have the\n  driver automatically installed to your kernel modules directory (no\n  more manual copying!)\n\nSo the compilation step should be:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThere is a list of supported device IDs here: http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Device_IDs (you can get your own with lsusb after plugging it in). If it's not supported, the next step is asking the devolopers via the mailing lists.\nIn principle, you should also update the xf86 driver and the libwacom library; I never did that because just the kernel driver solved the problem for me. \n", "Q: Restrict su to a group of users Is there someway to restrict su to a specific group of users?\nUpon searching over the web, I came across IBM AIX's concept of sugroup. Whenever a user is created, attribute sugroup can be set; and only members of this group are allowed to su to that user. \nsugroup can help me solve my problem by creating a group which contains only certain users allowed to su. Assigning sugroup means users outside this group are not permitted to be su-ed to by other users. But this concept of sugroup is not available in Ubuntu. How can it be achieved in Ubuntu?\nI made following entry in /etc/pam.d/su:\nauth       required   pam_wheel.so group=sulogin\nI created following:\n\n\n*\n\n*a group called sulogin which is for users allowed to su\n\n*users who don't belong to sulogin are user1 and user2\n\n*users who do belong to sulogin are admin1 and admin2\nNow when I am logged in as user1 and try to su to admin1 or admin2, I am not permitted to do so. This is as per my requirement. When I am logged in as user1 and try to su to user2, I am not permitted to do this. This is not as per my requirement (although my requirements were not clearly mentioned in the original question).\nI need to restrict all the users who are not in group sulogin from su-ing to any user who belongs to sulogin group. Basically, 2 levels of su privilege. So in the above mentioned scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*user1 should be able to su to user2 and vice-versa\n\n*user1 or user2 should not be able to su to admin1 or admin2\n\n*admin1 should be able to su to user1 or user2\n\nA: The equivalent is possible on Ubuntu, it's just not enabled by default. Check out /etc/pam.d/su:\n# Uncomment this to force users to be a member of group root\n# before they can use `su'. You can also add \"group=foo\"\n# to the end of this line if you want to use a group other\n# than the default \"root\" (but this may have side effect of\n# denying \"root\" user, unless she's a member of \"foo\" or explicitly\n# permitted earlier by e.g. \"sufficient pam_rootok.so\").\n# (Replaces the `SU_WHEEL_ONLY' option from login.defs)\n# auth       required   pam_wheel.so\n\nSo, uncomment this auth line, then su will be restricted to members of group root. Or uncomment and add group=sulogin, if you want to restrict to the sulogin group.\n", "Q: Xmodmap unlisted characters. Is there a way to add them?

So I've been attempting to fix a friend's HP laptop (model number unknown) for a few days ago. Hard drive errors. My usual idiot self decided that he wouldn't make SMART testing the first thing he'd do. Anyway, I just got around to SMART testing. I formatted his drive and wrote a new partition table. Ran Ubuntu from a live USB.\nSomething immediately caught my eye. Now I don't know much about SMART test results, but I know that it's probably not a good thing if the SMART dialog says that the read error rate threshold is 62 and the read error rate value is 1,245,235. Seriously. That's 20,084 times the threshold.\nI need at least 10 reputation to post images so I'm just going to post the link to the gallery (I'm not typing out the entire results):\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/neol4s58/f9d3487e/\nOn a scale of the Virgin Mary to the Greek economy, how screwed is this hard drive?\n\nA: Read error rate is an index whose value it's meaningful only if interpreted based on a manufacturer's guideline, since there's no standard way to implement it.\nConversely, the Reallocated sector count index is very alarming: 3736544 sectors * 512B = 1913110528B = 1.91GB~, and this means that almost 2GB worth of sectors are gone already.\nSo, to answer your question, the drive is failing.\nPersonally, I wouldn't store a single byte worth of important informations on it.\n", "Q: How to rebuild my PATH in script?

Currently I have set the scrollback setting of gnome terminal (Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Scrolling) to 10000 lines. I am tempted to tick Unlimited, but I am afraid this could lead to memory crashes (if I leave a program with lots of output running overnight, I wouldn't like it to crash because of this).\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are these scrollback lines stored in memory, or are they cached in a file on disk?\n\n*If I change from 10000 to 100000 or to 1 million, am I still safe? What parameters (RAM, free disk space, number of open terminals) I need to take into account)? Is selecting Unlimited safe?\n\nA: It's apparently stored in deleted files on disk, according to very interesting blog post:\n\nI could just look at what files gnome-terminal had open, so lsof to the rescue. Then I found it was being sneaky, it had a number of files called /tmp/vteXYZ1tv open, but it had already deleted them. Thus you can't see them when browsing, and they will be removed when the program closes. This makes sense, it means that when the process is closed, it doesn't matter how (at least I think), the space of the files can be reclaimed, i.e. we won't get leftover files on a program crash, or a kill -9. They can be restored though, my way (there are probably others), was to do a ls -l /proc/<gnome-terminal pid>/fd to see what they point to. Then you can cat these to make a new file. These are just a verbatim copy of the terminal output. No compression. No nothing. As it turns out, one of my terminal history's was almost 900 MB! But that was only after random data being spat out very quickly for quite a while, unlikely to happen in ordinary usage.\n\nAnd I'll stress this again: The poster had run base64 < /dev/urandum for a while, looking for increases in memory or disk usage - 900MB would be exceptional usage.\n\nA: gnome-terminal (actually vte) indeed stores the scrollback in an immediately-deleted file under /tmp (more precisely: under the standard tempfile location influenced by $TMPDIR and maybe a few similar ones).\nThis design was chosen mainly for unlimited scrollback not to cause OOM errors. The disk is way less likely to get filled up, and even if that happens, it's less harmful to the whole system than running out of memory.\nvte-0.40 (which will most likely appear in Ubuntu 15.10 W.W.) will compress and encrypt these files. This will shrink the required storage to approx third–fourth of its size (if your app produces X amount of data as plain text, somewhere between X/4 .. X/3 is a reasonable estimate for the storage that'll be required), and also gets rid of the privacy/security issue in case someone gets raw access to the hard drive.\nWe're planning to add an option to store the scrollback in memory, pretty much equally to as if your /tmp was on tmpfs. If everything goes as planned, this will appear in vte-0.42 and in turn in Ubuntu 16.04 X.X. LTS. I can't promise it, though.\n", "Q: Uninstall libav packages after re-installing from source I'm running kubuntu 14.04 and don't plan on upgrading until at least these summer holidays.

Where do files go when you delete them?\nI know when I send files to \"Trash\", they go to \"trash\", but when I delete them, I do not know where they go. \n\nA: Basically when you delete a file (\"empty the trash\") the index entry to the file is deleted, but the file information is not scrubbed off the disk.  As explained in this Ubuntu wiki page:\n\nThis is because in Unix file systems, files are indexed by a number,\n  called the inode, and each inode has several attributes associated\n  with it, like permissions, name, etc. When you delete a file, what\n  really happens is the inode is unlinked from the filename, but if some\n  other program is using the file, it still has a link open to the OS,\n  and will continue to be updated. A file is not really deleted until\n  all links have been removed (even then, the data is still on the disk,\n  but not indexed in anyway and thus very hard to recover).\n\n", "Q: Need help with reinstalling grub so I installed windows 7 after installing ubuntu, and as you may already know I can't log back into ubuntu. \nI tried running boot-repair but it seems to be stuck on purging the kernels (I left it for quite a couple of hours, but still no result). \nI tried manually re-installing grub via terminal (using live usb), and I actually managed to load the grub menu but could not see ubuntu on the list (just windows 7 and some memory tests).\nHere is a link to th BootInfo summary from boot-repair: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10686106/\nAny help would greatly be appreciated.

Here is the link: gcc-arm-embedded-misc\n\n\nA: The server reports MIME type text/plain in the HTTP Content-Type header field and Firefox diligently interprets and displays the file content as such. The server behaviour is a known bug in Launchpad itself.\nYou can circumvent the issue\n\n\n*\n\n*with the entries \"Save as…\" or \"Copy link address\"¹ in the context menu of the download link,\n\n*by dragging the link text to a writeable directory in a file manager, that supports HTTP resources, like Nautilus.\n\n\nA side note concerning the reported behaviour of Chrome/Chromium: web browsers shouldn't care about file extensions to determine file types according to RFC 1341. They should only care about the MIME string sent in the HTTP response header. If a browser disregards that string in favour of file extensions or content type sniffing, they may be doing something useful for the user in most situations, but they're violating RFC 1341 in the process.\n¹ Plus an HTTP client, that doesn't try to display file content, like wget, curl, or DownThemAll!.\n\nA: The easiest way to fix this would simply be to right click the link and click on \"Save Link As\". \n", "Q: Apache from 2.4.7 to 2.4.10 I am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS that runs Apache 2.4.7.

It also has a 120GB SSD, and I installed Ubuntu on it with 2 partitions / and /home. My laptop has a 16GB physical memory, so I don't need swap partition at the moment. I have Windows on the HDD and Ubuntu on the SSD. \nIs it possible for me to choose which OS I want to start on startup, because every time I start my laptop, it boots straight to Windows? I can switch to Ubuntu, but it is only when the laptop has fully started and I have to go into the UEFI settings and manually select Ubuntu, but then everything just falls back to normal like it is booting without Ubuntu installed at all. \nCan someone please tell me if I could dual boot Ubuntu and Windows if they are installed on 2 separate hard drives? If that is not possible, please tell me how I can achieve this. \nI managed to get it resolved by fixing the bootloader.\n\nA: I am not an expert on this, but I have been messing with the boot order for a while, so telling from my some-what experience:\nSo like the same way you get into UEFI settings, go to the BIOS settings (you can go to Advance Start-up, choose troubleshoot, advance options, then choose UEFI Firmware Settings - restart to get into it) [like you normally do]. After you get into the UEFI settings, you should see an option called BIOS settings or start up settings (some thing like that). Inside that, you should see an options that says Boot Priorities, Start-Up order (or something that means close to that). If you go into that subsection, you will be able to see which OS or devices have priorities over other installed OS(like Ubuntu)/devices(USB, DVD).\nIn you case, probably Windows OS or UEFI is above Ubuntu OS. So change the order of it via the given control options to bring Ubuntu option above Windows.\nThese things differ for each manufacture, but the base operation is the same. If you give some more information about your computer's (that had Ubuntu installed) manufacture and/or model, I will try to be specific. [the mentioned above is for Dell Laptop]\nProbably this video helps :)\nHope this information helps at least a little :)\n\nA: If you partition your drive, you can make your USB stick bootable (I personally like the rufus program to do this, but there are other options) then go into the bios and change the boot order to USB. This will allow you to load Ubuntu as if you had the disc. In the setup portion on ubuntu you can choose where to install ubuntu. If the hdd is partitioned, you can choose the partition you want to install linux. Be very careful. You can delete the portion of windows on the drive and lose windows completely. I've never loaded this on a ssd, but it should work the same. Good luck.\n\nA: I just needed to fix the BootLoader, and then it allowed me to choose between Windows and Ubuntu now.\n\nA: If you can successfully boot into linux at all I bet everything is installed correctly. You have to go into windows system settings. Turn off fast boot. windows defaults to this every update and hijacks the boot for itself.\ndisable fast boot\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: How to prevent munin from drawing \"warning\" lines on graphs? I've noticed that graphs with lots of values which have min/max warn limits look extremely crowded - all these min/max limits are drawn as lines via rrdtool HRULE.

I typically know where they should be. \nAny suggestions how to disable drawing warn lines?\n\n\nA: I made plugin to monitor the room temperatures at home. I ran into same problem as you are and I've noticed that the graphs are only showing the warning lines.\nHaving only critical values, kinda “solved” the problem.

Not sure how it got this way. Is this a problem, and what are the correct permissions?\n\nA: My server has 000-default.conf with 0644 (-rw-r--r--) permissions in sites-available and as a symlink lrwxrwxrwx in sites-enabled.\nYou should check the permissions of the file in /etc/apache2/sites-available to make sure it's something sane (at least not world-writable) as the link permissions don't matter (accessing the file through the link uses the target file's permissions)\n\nA: Using ls -l I have shown 000-default.conf is owned by root with -rw-r--r--\nroot@ubuntu:~# cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/\nroot@ubuntu:/etc/apache2/sites-available# ls -l\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1332 Mar 19  2016 000-default.conf\n\nThis was tested for Apache 2.4.18\nroot@ubuntu:/etc/apache2/sites-available# apache2 -v\nServer version: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)\nServer built:   2018-04-18T14:53:04\n\n", "Q: Do nvidia drivers update? In order to get the latest nvidia drivers for my Nvidia GTX 560 ti, I am installing the proprietary Nvidia drivers from their website. Will these update automatically? Is it worthwhile to do so?\n\nA: If you installed it/are going to install it from their website, no.\nBecause you manually installed the drivers there isn't any way, unless that functionality is programmed into the driver (which I believe it isn't.)\nAs for the worthwhile-ness of updating your drivers, that's normally a good idea. You get bug fixes and usually better performance. \nHowever, it's smart to back up your system prior to doing so because driver updates can occasionally mess up your system.\n\nA: It's much better to install either using apt-get or through the drivers menu, as these will update and also re-compile when you get a new kernel version (which your downloaded one will not)\n", "Q: 14.04 LTS only boots through recovery A regular boot through GRUB (non-recovery) stops around 75 seconds into the dmesg log.\ndmesg isn't saved during this process (I see older dmesg logs as .gz in /var/log but not the ones from the failed boot attempts)\nFrom what I can see, there may be the end of a stack trace for Radeon graphics drivers.\nThis seems to happen right before filesystems are mounted successfully (around 30s), bluetooth initialization (30-32s), and network initialization (32-75s)\nThere's a few type 1400 audit(...): apparmor=\"STATUS\" operation=\"profile_*\" ... lines around 63s.\nBeyond there, the only changes as I continue to wait are sky2 0000:03:00.0 eth0: rx error, status 0x402500 length 60 errors which happen even when the system is running successfully.

SSH is not yet running or accessible.\nHitting the power button results in kvm: exiting hardware virtualization with nothing else happening (no shutdown or further messages other than the sky2 errors every 2 minutes or so).\nHolding the power button will hardware shutdown the desktop.\nPerforming the boot by selecting recovery mode at the GRUB menu and hitting resume allows the system to boot normally, albeit inconveniently since it requires human intervention to boot.\nI suspect this might have something to do with either the graphics drivers (open source Radeon -- a recent change from fglrx since latest kernel is not supported by ATI proprietary drivers)  or smbd/nmbd which are failing to start (in recovery boot as well, but does not impact boot there).\n\nA: I had a similar problem yesterday and I re downloaded the distribution.

If I install ubuntu on my USB will it affect my Hard Drive or will it delete my Win 7 OS?\nAnd how do I make it to be a live USB so when I take out my USB I can boot Windows and When I plug it in I will get the bootup screen after I restart.\n\nA: First be sure of the drive that you want to install Ubuntu on, ie. A: drive, B: drive, C: drive, which ever one that is your flash drive that you want for installation. During the installation process, choose the custom installation option. At that point, you can install Ubuntu on the USB flash drive.\nThe reason for doing it this way is that you will have GRUB installed on your flash drive and still have BIOS on your Windows 7 computer. After the installation you can boot up on either operation system by pressing the F12 button during  boot up. If you only want to use the Windows 7 during the boot up process than pressing the F12 button is not necessary. With that said it is not a bad idea to remove the USB Ubuntu drive so that you do not accidentally have Windows format it.\nThe partition amount on the custom install is really up to you. The main thing is that GRUB and Ubuntu is installed on the same drive using the custom install option.\n", "Q: How to use CD in way similar to a usb like you can Windows I'm currently using Lubuntu but this seems to happen in other Distros as well. I can't copy files onto a CD without burning it, however in Windows you can use a CD in a similar way to USB where you can put files on and off as you please. So for example, I can't drag a PDF from my documents folders onto my CD folder, as it say it's a read-only. I 've tried changing it's permissions to read and write but it won't let me, saying it's a read only file system. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Actually, when we copy file to CD without burning process in Windows, we just copy the file to windows temporary folder. It will not be permanently written to the CD.\nPlease correct me if I am wrong, but when you move the CD to other computer, the file will not be able to be opened or will not be exist on the CD.\nTherefore, it would be not absolutely true if in this case we compare the function of CD and USB as similar.\nThe easiest way to solve the problem is to use CD burning app or program in Ubuntu.\nAs examples, please check these pages:\nWhat cd/dvd burning software should I use?\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CdDvd/Burning\nGood Luck\n", "Q: Changing kernel driver from wl to b43 im running on ubuntu 14.10 and i want to change my wireless kernel driver from wl to b43. is there a step by step procedure to do this?\nhere's my adapter info.\ni run sudo lspci -k\n\n08:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 802.11b/g/n\n  (rev 01)  Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device 2230  Kernel\n  driver in use: wl\n\ni run sudo lspci -vnn\n08:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 802.11b/g/n [14e4:4365] (rev 01)\n    Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device [103c:2230]\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 18\n    Memory at b5500000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=32K]\n    Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 3\n    Capabilities: [58] Vendor Specific Information: Len=78 <?>\n    Capabilities: [48] MSI: Enable- Count=1/1 Maskable- 64bit+\n    Capabilities: [d0] Express Endpoint, MSI 00\n    Capabilities: [100] Advanced Error Reporting\n    Capabilities: [13c] Virtual Channel\n    Capabilities: [160] Device Serial Number 00-00-27-ff-ff-d8-14-2d\n    Capabilities: [16c] Power Budgeting <?>\n    Kernel driver in use: wl\n\ni already search the net and suggestion says that i should run this sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutterthen this sudo modprobe b43\nalso check the additional drivers but no b43 driver option that i can enable.\ni run sudo lspci -vnnbut kerner driver in use is still:wl\ni checked the broadcom website to check if my wireless model is compatible[14e4:4365] but it says \"NO\".\nis there any work around out there? for this to work?\nany help is deeply appreciated\nregards\n\nA: Is there any workaround to get the impossible to work?

What should I do? I'm afraid I'm being hacked: My Ubuntu is receiving inbound traffic while my PC is disconnected from Ethernet and WIFI, so my question is, how am I receiving inbound traffic? I even have a firewall that is turned on.\nI'm studying to be a developer, so obviously I can't completely disconnect from the web.\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: If you think you're being hacked personally, below you can find a few very stringent rules to make hacker's lives extremely difficult.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remain calm\n\n*Turn off all hardware you don't need to be a developer in the BIOS (this includes: microphones & speakers as they have been shown in the past to be used as communication channels once the PC was hacked, printer ports, USB ports, WiFi, etc)\n\n*Black-list all hardware that cannot be disabled in the BIOS\n\n*Connect through cable connection only and as little as possible (1/day to download mail, updates, upload your work\n\n*Install as little software as possible \n\n*Don't install software known to track you (flash, silverlight)\n\n*Use Firefox with the noscript and modify headers plugins\n\n*Disable all cookies.  Only allow cookies per site and only for the session.\n\n*Make system back-ups so you can roll back to previous versions and make the hacker's life a hell.\n\n*Use these backups to create Live DVDs on DVD-Rs that cannot be hacked in case you need longer online exposure.\n\n*You are already using a firewall, keep doing that.\n\n*Only connect to the Internet through a NAT router and protect it with an admin password and use another DND then the one provided by your ISP.\n\n*Don't give anyone physical access to your computer\n\n\nThat should get rid on 99.999% of hackers.\nOn the analysis of the problem:\nDo the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from an Ubuntu LiveCD\n\n*Do not connect to any network\n\n*go to a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and type: netstat --all\nYou will receive something like this and that will be your baseline. Ubuntu is not only a client OS but also a server so some applications connect to their server part on your own machine using TCP/IP sockets and this is absolutely normal.  Sockets are a very benign and essential part of processes communicating with one-another!\nThen connect to the network (still booted from the liveCD) and do the netstat -- all again.  This will be your baseline for a connected computer\nThen install Ubuntu again following the above directives and especially: keep a cool head and read some more documentation on how Ubuntu works and if you have more specific questions, ask a new question.\n\nA: I am basing much of this on the original post (except for the title).\n\nI think my PC is being hacked. What should I do? ... How should I proceed?\n\nThe first thing you should do is remain calm verify that this is the case. Constructively: Many of the comments in your original post indicate a fundamental lack of understanding of how many of the concepts you mentioned work. In the face of technology that is not understood, it is quite easy (and understandable) to draw incorrect conclusions and become paranoid. I suspect that you have misinterpreted the output of commands you do not understand, normal behaviors of a computer, etc., as being hacked. It is important to use proper critical thinking here.\nThat's not to say that you're not experiencing actual problems, but it is difficult to separate actual problems from suspected problems when concrete information is not given and accurate observations are not made.\n\nMy Ubuntu is receiving inbound traffic while my PC is disconnected from Ethernet and WIFI, ...\n\nHow have you determined that you are receiving inbound traffic? If you would like to actually determine that you are receiving inbound traffic, use proper tools. For example, use Wireshark (available in Ubuntu's repository) to watch traffic. Apply a filter and look for things coming from external IP addresses (rather than local applications attempting to reach out, which they will still attempt in the absence of an internet connection). You can also view live packet counts on all available interfaces to see which interfaces are being actively used. You may also use ifconfig to list your interfaces; network usage statistics are given there and can be monitored as well.\n\n... so my question is, how am I receiving inbound traffic? \n\nYou aren't! Unless you somehow failed to notice a telephone line sticking out of your PC :) and you established a dial-up connection somewhere, or you actively went through the non-trivial process of tethering through a USB or Bluetooth device then forgot you did this, you are not receiving inbound traffic if you are not connected to a network. \nGoing back to the first paragraph, I suspect you are misinterpreting information. For example, in your original post, you wrote:\n\nI don't know if it is b/c now they are only keeping tabs on me b/c they know that I have been talking with the FBI, but they are still listening in on my ports, especially \"sockets\" which is something that I am not familiar with. yesterday, I found information by accident, and I was able to view the \"Sockets\" information and there were over 50 sockets opened and with someone on the other end listening.\n\nHowever, this represents a fundamental misunderstanding. First, \"listening in on my ports, especially \"sockets\"\" simply does not make sense! Your terminology is not quite right and that statement is therefore unclear, and it is impossible to tell what you mean here or where this idea came from. This lends evidence to a misunderstanding on your part (there is nothing wrong with that).\nSockets can be open while offline, this is not suspicious. The idea of \"someone on the other end [of a socket] listening\" doesn't make sense as a concept, and there is no tool that can show such information. However, to explain why I'd have to explain how this works, and that is outside the scope of this answer. I suspect that you misinterpreted the LISTENING statuses in e.g. netstat or something (which actually refers to local applications on your machine listening for connections from outside, not the reverse).\n\nTL;DR:\nThere are multiple other statements along those lines in your original post - I can't address them all here.  The point is, you must remain calm, gain an understanding, use proper tools to concretely verify that your claims are true, and then organize relevant information in a reasonable way so that you can make correct conclusions. This will let you determine a) that there is not actually a problem, or b) that there is a well-defined problem that you can find a solution to. Have no fear: Easy, reliable, and affordable security solutions absolutely exist, but to use those solutions, you must first verify your problem and get a concrete handle on the details. Perhaps, in your case, it could be helpful to redirect your anxiety towards determination and analyses, rather than panic. :)\nAs of right now, it seems that, despite your worries, there is not enough hard evidence to suggest a problem yet. If there is a problem, you have not yet given accurate enough information for us to tell you what it might be and how to solve it.\n\nOne final obligatory point, though (emphasis mine):\n\nFor instance, I was using a Key Scrambler and an Anti Key logger and they would turn them off any time I got on the Net.\n\nI highly recommend against downloading and installing such dubious software tools. Things like this could very well be the source of malware and cause of some of your original problems on your original non-Linux system. Efforts like this to \"solve\" these types of problems problems can easily make things worse, or even cause the issues in the first place.\n", "Q: watch internet connection through shell I just need to run a shell script when an internet connection is available.

It does this by sending a standardized DHCP broadcast request packet to the DHCP server with a source IP address of 255.255.255.255.\nIf your DHCP server has more than one interface, you have to add a route for this 255.255.255.255 address so that it knows the interface on which to send the reply; if not, it sends it to the default gateway. \nAdd the route to your /etc/network/interfaces file. In this case the route is added to the eth0 interface. \n#\n# File: /etc/network/interfaces\n#\n\niface eth0 inet static\n\n       address 192.168.0.1\n       netmask 255.255.255.0\n       up route add -host 255.255.255.255 eth0\n\niface eth1 inet static\n\n       address 192.168.1.0\n       netmask 255.255.255.0\n       up route add -host 255.255.255.255 eth1\n\nNow, You can configure your DHCP configuration as given by @2707974\nSuppose request comes to say eth0, which is configured with address with subnet 192.168.0.X so that client will get ip in 192.168.0.X range.\nSimilarly, for eth1 interface.\n", "Q: How to reenable default window decoration/theme of Ubuntu Kylin?

On the launcher in Ubuntu it created a shortcut to browse my Windows 7 stuff. I'm able to view Program Files, Users folders (Desktop, Documents, etc). Just wondering is it safe (I'm assuming they're formatted differently so don't want problems) to access all these files from Ubuntu?\nOn another note, where can I access Ubuntu folders from Windows 7? When I launched my W7 boot, it just showed my C drive and not the Ubuntu partition.\nThanks\n\nA: Safety is relative, not absolute; thus, there is no correct \"yes/no\" answer to your question.\nMany people use the NTFS-3g driver that Ubuntu provides for accessing NTFS volumes without problems; however, that driver is a third-party reverse-engineered implementation, and problem reports (including reports of data loss) do occasionally crop up. Furthermore, Linux doesn't recognize the NTFS security model, so if you make a habit of regularly accessing your Windows boot partition from Linux, you run some risk of accidentally trashing things because of an errant command.\nOf course, even Windows-only installations also encounter filesystem corruption, accidentally-deleted files, and so on. It's unlikely to be as safe to access an NTFS volume from Linux as it is from Windows, though. Unfortunately, I know of nobody who's attempted to quantify the risk, so it's impossible for me to say how much that risk increases. Does the risk of data loss in a year increase from 0.10% to 0.11%, from 1% to 50%, or something else? I don't know.\nIn any event, my recommendation, if at all possible, is to use a separate data-exchange partition, and leave the Windows boot volume unmounted in Linux. FAT is the safest and fastest filesystem for this purpose, at least from a Linux perspective; but FAT has file-size limitations and isn't as flexible in Windows.\n\nA: Yes it is safe unless Windows is not in hibernated state, Ubuntu supports all major formats including windows native format, NTFS and FAT.\nAlthough Ubuntu by default uses ext filesystem like ext4 ext3 or ext2.\nYou cannot browse Ubuntu files directly from Windows unless you use some third party software like Paragon since Windows doesn't support ext formats.\n", "Q: Bash \"move files\" error message I am trying to move some files based on a search pattern using bash but I get an error message.

Thanks!\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfirstdir=dir1\nseconddir=dir2\n\n\nfor i in 'grep -l matchpattern $firstdir/*'; do\n    mv $i $seconddir\n    echo $i\ndone\n\nerror message:\nmv: invalid option -- 'l'\nTry `mv --help' for more information.\ngrep -l problem $firstdir/*\n\nPS I have been looking for quite some time for an answer, but getting nowhere.\n\nA: You need to change the quotes around the grep command for backticks:\nfor i in `grep -l matchpattern \"$firstdir\"/*`; do\n\nOr adopt the new-style $():\nfor i in $(grep -l matchpattern \"$firstdir\"/*); do \n\nSource: What's the difference between $(stuff) and `stuff`?\n\nA: When writing scripts, if you have an error, you need to echo your variables to understand what is happening. This is the first step in debugging. Had you done so, you would have seen that the grep command is not being executed and is instead being saved as $i:\n$ for i in 'grep -l matchpattern $firstdir/*'; do \n    echo \"i is: $i\"; \n  done\ni is: grep -l matchpattern $firstdir/*\n\nIn order to pass the results of a command, you need to use command substitution. That's either `command` or, better, $(command). So, what you wanted to do was:\nfor i in $(grep -l matchpattern \"$firstdir\"/*); do \n    mv \"$i\" \"$seconddir\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: Take an image of a physical machine using VMWare Converter Standalone - options are disabled I need to take an image of my Ubuntu 12.04 physical machine and keep it in a hard drive.

Anyways, I followed instructions but  then at this step:\n\nThe This local machine option is disabled.

Does it run on VMplayer? I'd appreciate more details on the steps.\n\nA: I don't expect the exe version to work like you expect since they run in wine.\nYou absolutely should have a second disk in your PC and you should boot a live or backup system in order to create an image from your system. Booting a live system should never be dangerous to your current OS.\nThe most straight forward approach is this. It won't give you any software related problems:\nUse dd (disk dump) to create an image from your disk, something like:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/media/hdd/disk.img bs=1M\n\n(if is input file, of is output file, bs is block size and 1M will speed up the transfer.)\nAfter that convert the image using qemu-img:\nqemu-img convert -f raw -O vmdk /media/hdd/disk.img /media/hdd/disk.vmdk\n\nThat's it.\nYou may delete /media/hdd/disk.img as soon as your VMWare works.\nBe aware that you temporarily need up to twice the disk space of the size of your source disk, which means you cannot dump the system without a second hard drive.\nBe careful with dd, if you output to disk (of=/dev/...) instead of a file, you will destroy your data on that disk. Apart from this it's totally safe. I did this a thousand times without backup ;)\nAfterwards you can simply create a new virtual machine with similar specs as your real system. Then instead of creating a new disk choose the one we created using qemu-img.\nAnother idea: probably you can convert directly from disk\nsudo qemu-img convert -f raw -O vmdk /dev/sda /media/hdd/disk.vmdk\n\nbut I haven't tried this yet. Would speed up the process by 90% \nNote: you should boot a live CD for execution of DD else some data on the disk.img might be corrupt. This should not be a problem since most data that is modified (logs, temp) is not vital to a system. But eg. databases will be broken (in theory).\nIf you cannot boot a live CD, please run your system with as few processes as possible. Usually you can achieve this in Linux by calling sudo init 1. This will shutdown your GUI session and bring you to a text mode login.\n", "Q: What Editor has NO Syntax Highlighting and can copy&paste text in GTK interfaces? Simple problem: I have a JSON file that is used for snapshot serialization of a JS-based VM.\nIt contains a shitload of data and every single editor crashes while trying to open it, except vim.\nBut, vim, of course - can't right click and copy the whole file into the clipboard.\nWhen trying out vim-gtk, vim-nox, vim-gnome etc., they don't offer a proper GTK GUI for Gnome3. They all missed updating the library to GTK3, so I have no menu, no mouse, no context menus etc. there.\nSo I can't open the file with any GTK based editor (mousepad, leafpad, geany, gedit, etc. - all will crash, trust me). I tried out every single editor that was mentioned on Google Fu lists, forum posts etc. Really, all will crash because you can't simply deactivate syntax highlighting.\nI simply want the text content of the whole file in the clipboard, so I can paste it into the Web Browser of my choice.\nHow to achieve that?\nPS: No, I won't install whole KDE for a simple clipboard task.\n\nA: You could try pastebinit, you'll get a link to open the json file in your browser:\nsudo apt-get install pastebinit\ncat data.json | pastebinit -b http://paste.ubuntu.com\n\n\nA: Remove the extension of the file, I assume that it is \"json\". Therefore no syntax highlighting should be applied.\n$ cp your_file.json your_file\n$ gedit your_file\n\n\nA: emelFM2 is a file manager that comes with an internal GTK-based text viewer and editor (bound to F3 and F4). It has no syntax highlighting. To install use the emelFM2 PPA (release).\n", "Q: Juju status error I am using MaaS as environment and I have one node as WOL (Wake-On-Lan).\nWhen I do juju status I get the following error:\nERROR Unable to connect to environment \"maas\".\nPlease check your credentials or use 'juju bootstrap' to create a new environment.\n\nError details:\nunable to connect to \"wss://node.maas:17070/\"\n\nHow do I solve this?\n\nA: Assuming bootstrap worked, you need to either add the IP for node.maas to /etc/hosts on the machine where you are running \"juju status\", or change /etc/resolv.conf and include the MAAS IP as a nameserver, assuming you configured MAAS to own DNS too for your node network.\n", "Q: DLNA server with playback progress control I'm relatively new to using Linux on desktop and there are just a few things that I miss from Windows. One of them is Samsung AllShare. This is a DLNA server wich provides \"play to\", progress bar and volume control from PC to TV. My TV is not a smart one but it has DLNA client. Due to that it also doesn't have a progress bar when playing and the jump forward button forwards in 5 seconds steps, so when I must tune to the half of a movie, my fingers are numbing.\nI already tried with MiniDLNA, VLC and Serviio as DLNA servers but they also doesn't provide a faster progress control feature.\nSo my question is: is there anyone of you who knows a DLNA/UPNP server with features described above or any way to control playback progress from server to client?\n\nA: Xbmc/Kodi amongs many other features also provides a DLNA server to stream its content to a DLNA client. \nFor sound only but not video there is an extremely light-weight DLNA server that can stream the output of any media player on your Ubuntu desktop though creating a selectable sound output device: pulseaudio-dlna:\n\nA: It seems like you need a control point.\nI can suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.eezupnp.de/ - simple and clear.

As well, a lot of drivers are readily available through a Google search.\nUnfortunately, it is impossible to say where one should go for a driver, as we do NOT have your entire hardware list.  To that end, you should run Ubuntu in a Live environment (LiveCD or LiveUSB) and test things.  It would be able to determine whether you'd need additional drivers or not.\n\nA: often it is easier to just buy a supported WiFi card or use a USB dongle than to waste days trying to get some vendors products to work.

People complain they can't reduce widths of some columns to fit a useful list into a small window, and hate having horizontal scroll bars.\n    We try to accomodate and make columns able to be made very small if desired. Oh, but Gtk got changed in the mean time, and the list view class we use is actually now broken and we're unable to implement this. You can resize as much as you want, but you never get a horizontal scrollbar, ever. So columns just disappear if you make other columns too wide. The Gtk change also means we can't even go back to the way things originally were - we're on an island.\n    The current behavior is implemented as a temporary fix until we figure out what to do.\n    We patch the gtk we ship with Mint to 'band-aid' the problem (actually a rejected patch someone submitted to the Gnome devs). There's a PR (#611) to restore the original behavior (see list item 1). This of course will only be useful to people that liked the original behavior, but doesn't improve anything, and only applies to those running this patched Gtk (Mint 17 users).\n    You are here.\nSo, yeah it's been kicked under the rug a bit, and that's our fault.

I'll take a look again in the next couple weeks if I can fix the issue at hand here - remembering widths - before 2.6.\"\nA possible but difficult fix:\nA primitive workaround at least to start nemo with increased \"name\" column width is to modify nemo-list-view.c:\ngtk_tree_view_column_set_min_width (view->details->file_name_column, 125);\ninto\ngtk_tree_view_column_set_min_width (view->details->file_name_column, 300);\nBecause that is a 'c' source file, although it is just accessing an API, so could be written in a script language, it is not, so you would need to get all the other sources, and compile them with the right settings then replace the executables, and repeat the whole thing each time nemo was updated.\nSource: Github Forum\n\nA: Just my two cents but after I installed the fileroller I had the same issue.\nHowever, when I ticked the option \nignore per-folder view preferences in prefs > behaviour\nI could resize the columns & it would remember them.\nObvs per folder didn't matter, but at least I could set the size of a column such as the name & it seems to remember it across sessions :)\n", "Q: typing \"android\" in firefox opens a apache2 Ubuntu Default Page Whenever I search for the word android through firefox' address bar, a page titled Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page opens up.\n\nWhat is this page all about and what does it have to do with Ubuntu?\nBTW I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 and Mozilla Firefox 36.0.4\nEDIT: Here is the output of  nmap android\nStarting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-03-27 22:05 IST\nNmap scan report for android (127.0.53.53)\nHost is up (0.00041s latency).\nNot shown: 997 closed ports\nPORT    STATE SERVICE\n80/tcp  open  http\n139/tcp open  netbios-ssn\n445/tcp open  microsoft-ds\n\nNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.60 seconds\n\n\nA: I concur with Eric Carvalho's comment.

It's awesome so far but it's really sluggish on this PC...\nI received a 'busted laptop' from a friend, not a bad Sony Vaio with a first gen i3. However it has half the RAM in it, someone took a stick out. I thought it was 4GB (down from 8) but I was mistaken, turns out it's just 2GB. I probably should have checked first!\nAnyway, it's a bit sluggish. I installed the 64bit version, so it's a bit suspect that maybe I overlooked 32bit. The reasoning was that the site for the iso says (For systems with LESS than 2GB of memory). This is right at 2GB... So, any experienced users suggest I move to 32bit based on lack of memory?\nSide note/question, but may be of importance, I thought I installed 14.04, but ran updates and noticed it's at 14.10. Maybe I just downloaded the wrong version completely. Are the updates what pushed it?\nFeedback is GREATLY appreciated! ::)\n\nA: Changing to a 32-bit OS will have very little, if any, effect on the performance of your computer. \nWhether it is a 32-bit or 64-bit system dictates how much memory the CPU can address. A 32-bit system can only address 4GB RAM where a 64-bit system can address much more. \nSee x86-x64 (Wikipedia)\n\nA: I love Ubuntu, its the first Linux distro that I was like 'this is how it should be!'. However from my experience now (I don't have much) it eats similar resources to that of Windows. So my inexperienced feedback is you could try the 32bit, but I imagine it may operate the same. The sys requirements page advises just the UI (they call 'Unity') its suggests 1GB, so the graphics power of your unit may be the culprit. It suggests Xubuntu or Lubuntu as lighter-weight GUI versions of Ubuntu. Otherwise I have had pretty good experiences with a distro I believe is based on Ubuntu, Mint. If you are persistent about being on straight-Ubuntu, then maybe load an older supported version (I think they call them LTE or something) that may not need as much resources\n", "Q: ImportError: No module named tkinter When I try to install tkinter using this command:\nsudo apt-get install python-tk\n\nI get this message meaning it is already installed:\nReading package lists...

What program do I use to open this file?\n\nA: Downloaded TeamSpeak 3 file needs to be run - its an installer script.\n1. Allow Execution of Installer\nYou have to change its permissions first, allowing it to be executed. You can do it in shell (chmod +x TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64-3.0.16.run) or selecting Properties of the file, and allowing it like this:\n\n2. Run the Installer\nOpen your Terminal (you can press default shortcut of Ctrl+Alt+T), and go to directory where the file is located, eg:\ncd Downloads\n\nAnd run the installer, eg. like this:\n./TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64-3.0.16.run\n\n3. Keep System Clean\nTeamSpeak will be installed in current directory, and its probably a good idea to move it somewhere - /opt is good place to keep additional software like this (which didn`t come from \"normal\" Ubuntu packages):\nsudo mv TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64 /opt/\n\n4. Run TeamSpeak\nTo run installed TeamSpeak enter:\n/opt/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64/ts3client_runscript.sh\n\n5. Create Launcher\nYou can permanently create a Launcher, for yourself:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/TeamSpeak3.desktop\n\n...or for all users on your system like this:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/TeamSpeak3.desktop\n\nPut a content to this Launcher like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=TeamSpeak 3\nComment=TeamSpeak 3 VoIP Communicator\nExec=/opt/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64/ts3client_runscript.sh\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Network;Application;\nIcon=/opt/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64/styles/default/logo-128x128.png\n\n\nRemember to replace file and directory names accordingly to TeamSpeak version (here 3.0.16) and target architecture (here amd64).\n(The default Icon is somewhat too pale - you can find another icon if you wish)\n\nA: Since I can't comment yet I'll post this as an answer.\n@madneon 's answer works but you need to put \"\" around the path in Exec otherwise it won't work (tested on Ubuntu 16.04)\nSeeing how this is one of the first results when searching for this 'problem'\nTo be clear:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=TeamSpeak 3\nComment=TeamSpeak 3 VoIP Communicator\n--Exec=\"/opt/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64/ts3client_runscript.sh\"--\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Network;Application;\nIcon=/opt/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64/styles/default/logo-128x128.png\n\n", "Q: What is the explanation behind the key combinations to enlarge and decrease font size in terminal?

I've been trying lots of workarounds still I cannot find that specific code line for changing that background.\n\nI looked at solutions here and here but my problem appears to be slightly different because everything is fine during surfing the files it's only when renaming a folder or a file it becomes grey and with grey-white font so it doesn't look distinctive. What I want is to replace grey background to darker one that's it.\nUPDATE\nI tried a trick to combine/mix this theme with files/codes from other themes just to find out where is it hidden, I replaced gtk2.0 folder with other gtk2.0 theme folder but nothing had changed but when I replaced gtk3.0 folder with the same from other theme the background was black indeed, though the theme appeared afterwards awkward of course but as I far as I can see it's gotta be somewhere in gtk3.0\nUPDATE\nAfter applying fix:\n\n\nA: After working around for hours with help of theme developer I finally came up with a solution for Nautilus, so to change background entry color when renaming a folder or a file you need to create a small code inside theme folder exactly at:\nsudo -H gedit /usr/share/themes/name-of-the-theme/gtk-3.0/nautilus-entry-section.css\n\nand add this code:\nNautilusCanvasViewContainer.view EelEditableLabel.entry {\nbackground-image: none;\nbackground:black;\n}\n\nYou can edit your way refering to a color even blue or yellow etc... When done, save & close.\nNow we should give gtk-main a path to read it be named gtk-main.css mostly or only gtk.css:\nsudo -H gedit /usr/share/themes/name-of-the-theme/gtk-3.0/gtk-main.css\n\nAnd going all the way to the bottom add at the end:\n@import url(\"nautilus-entry-section.css\");\n\nSave & close it.

I always reboot my computer to solve it temporarily.\n\nA: I'm sorry to tell you this - but those smudges are a clear sign that your HD3650 is starting to fail. Especially if they become more frequent the longer you use the computer.\nI had that same issue on the same card on a laptop of mine.\nRegardless, if you want to exclude a driver problem, you can just download an image of a later (14.10) or earlier (I would recommend 12.04 based on the card) Ubuntu, write it to a USB stick, boot it, use it for a while and check if the issue remains.\nUnfortunately the issue is all too familiar to me. The \"smudges\" started as really small glitches, in 3D or composited images, and then grew to what you see now. In a later stage, most of the screen started getting \"garbled\". \nThe potential goo news is that replacing the card on my laptop with one from ebay solved the issue for me. Although it is not a task for a beginner.\nHere is the guide I followed for my own laptop.\nOf course, this will vary with the laptop, and in some cases it may not even be possible to swap cards.\nI hope this is not the issue with your own card, but if it is I hope I have provided you with some options.\nUpdate:\nAfter looking more carefully at the picture, this does not look like your typical failing card error (although I wouldn't completely discard the possibility).\nThis can also be an issue with hyperz.\nYou can try to disable it by editing /etc/profile and adding this line to the bottom:\nR600_DEBUG=nohyperz\nAfter adding this line, just restart your machine and see it it has helped.\n", "Q: How to access bottom panel in Gnome?

(I actually find this a problem as it opens all the time so use this extension to stop it).\nNote that with Gnome 3.16+ this behaviour I think has been changed so that notifications show in the calendar etc: https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.16/.\n", "Q: Ubuntu can't detect wifi, even after reinstalling the driver (BCM43142) Recently after fiddling a bit with routers in my apartment I discovered that ubuntu can't detect my own home network anymore.

Change the paths below (and in my example bash aliases) if you prefer a different location.\nmkdir ~/Android && cd ~/Android\n\nNext download and extract the platform tools from Google:\nwget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip && unzip platform-tools-latest-linux.zip\n\nNow the latest adb, fastboot, and other tools are available to run directly from the newly extracted 'platform-tools' directory. Use bash aliases to make them easier to use (after uninstalling the obsolete distribution packages to avoid conflicts). This example command will alias the adb command, making it immediately available for use:\necho \"alias adb='~/Android/platform-tools/adb'\" >> ~/.bash_aliases && source ~/.bash_aliases\n\nAnd optionally for fastboot too:\necho \"alias fastboot='~/Android/platform-tools/fastboot'\" >> ~/.bash_aliases && source ~/.bash_aliases\n\nUpdating is as simple as cd'ing to the Android directory and repeating the download and extract step again. Use adb version to check your currently installed version.\n\nA: Improving on Organic Marble's answer, to only install the latest tools (not the whole sdk), use the platform-tool filter as below:\ntools/android update sdk -t platform-tool --no-ui\n\n\nA: If you think, you have latest SDK but the adb tool is older one, \nUse,\n# adb version\nAndroid Debug Bridge version 1.0.31\n# wget -O - https://skia.googlesource.com/skia/+archive/cd048d18e0b81338c1a04b9749a00444597df394/platform_tools/android/bin/linux.tar.gz | tar -zxvf - adb\n# sudo mv adb /usr/bin/adb\n# sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/adb\n# adb version\nAndroid Debug Bridge version 1.0.32\n\nRefernce http://bernaerts.dyndns.org/linux/74-ubuntu/328-ubuntu-trusty-android-adb-fastboot-qtadb\n\nA: I will add some stuff I learned earlier today.\nI had two versions of adb installed at the same time due to a fascinating series of steps, Ubuntu 18.04; somehow an earlier version of the Android SDK created a symlink in /usr/bin/adb, so firing up React Native packager would pull from a conflicting adb and cause fairly difficult to interpret symptoms. I think it was because I installed remove+reinstalled Android Studio.\n/home/<USER>/Android/Sdk/platform-tools is the default location your adb executable will be found in.\nYou can check its version by:\n$ ./adb version\n\nHere are the path variables you might find:\nexport ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk\nexport PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools\nexport PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin\nexport PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools\n\nThen you can make sure your system is using it with:\nsudo ln -s /home/<USER>/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb /usr/bin/adb\n\nThat would allow you to use from a custom installation directory as well; replace /home/<USER>/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb with the path to your executable.\n\nA: You can download the latest SDK including adb here.  When you extract this archive, there is a readme which explains how to install the SDK.  I list it here for your reference.\nWelcome to the Android SDK!\n\nThe Android SDK archive initially contains only the basic SDK tools. It does\nnot contain an Android platform or any third-party libraries. In fact, it\ndoesn't even have all the tools you need to develop an application.\n\nIn order to start developing applications, you must install the Platform-tools\nand at least one version of the Android platform, using the SDK Manager.\n\nPlatform-tools contains build tools that are periodically updated to support new\nfeatures in the Android platform (which is why they are separate from basic\nSDK tools), including adb, dexdump, and others.\n\nTo install Platform-tools, Android platforms and other add-ons, you must\nhave an Internet connection, so if you plan to use the SDK while\noffline, please make sure to download the necessary components while online.\n\nTo start the SDK Manager, please execute the program \"android\".\n\nFrom the command-line you can also directly trigger an update by\nexecuting:\n  tools/android update sdk --no-ui\n\nTip: use --help to see the various command-line options.\n\n\nFor more information, please consult the Android web site at\n  http://developer.android.com/sdk/\n\nOnce installed (you will have to install Java if you don't have it already), you can navigate to android-sdk-linux/platform-tools and execute adb from there by typing\n./adb [options]\n\nI freely admit this may not be the most elegant solution but it works for me.  ISTR that on a different Ubuntu machine I managed a minimal install with just platform-tools sans Java, but I cannot find my notes on that.\n", "Q: Similar to xkill for mir xkill is a command I almost use everyday. That's because my PC is quite crappy [a 10' chilli GREEN netbook NEO XP made in Holland (even if I'm in Greece), with 1 GB ram memory and 2 Intel Atom cores and poor 3d acceleration]. I recently installed ubuntu NEXT 15.04 on my pc and sometimes some programs lag a lot. That's where I usually use Xkill BUT I'm not using x11 now, I'm using Mir. And I tried xkill but it says:\nThe program 'xkill' is not currently installed. You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install x11-utils\n\nBut I'm not using x11 !!!\nSo, if I installed x11, would it work or not? And if not, is there any similar command for mir instead of xkill?\n\nA: I know you want the graphical app for killing a window, but there's a command line alternative, pkill app-name, for example\npkill firefox\n\nwill kill all the open firefox windows. You can use that until you find something for mir.\n", "Q: truncate all files recursively can anybody give me a solution to enlarge all files of same extension by 264 bytes on entire hard disk? truncate -s +264 /*encrypted would enlarge all *.encrypted files by 264 bytes but only in one directory.\nI want it to do the subfolders as well\n\nA: Try this:\nfind /path/to/directory -type f -name \"*.encrypted\" -exec truncate -s +264 {} +\n\nfind will search in the /path/to/directory and all of its subdirectories for files with .encrypted extension and then run your desired truncate command over all of those found files.\nIf you want to search for the files in entire disk:\nsudo find / -type f -name \"*.encrypted\" -exec truncate -s +264 {} +\n\nIf you are not sure about the names, don't run this one rather you should explicitly mention the directories (and its subdirectories) to search for, for example the following will find and execute the command over the only the files found in /home/user and /tmp directories (and their subdirectories):\nfind /home/user/ /tmp/ -type f -name \"*.encrypted\" -exec truncate -s +264 {} +\n\nNote that you need to use sudo to search in the directories where you don't have required permission.\n", "Q: Software that show pressed keyboard to desktop I've found key-mon. But it's very limited is there any program like key-mon that shows keysrokes every time I type to screen?\n\nA: Try screenkey. You can install it with sudo apt-get install screenkey or with the software center. Then open it and try any shortcut.\n", "Q: Any benefit to uninstalling unused applications? I am a newcomer to Linux and after a few months of trying out different distros I have now settled on Ubuntu 14.10 on my aging HP TX2000 Notebook. \nOne thing I am unsure of is if there is any benefit to uninstalling the many apps I will not likely be using. \nBeing used mainly for web browsing / videos / old school gaming on wine etc. I cant see myself using things like the Libre Office apps for example. \nIt seems somewhat ingrained in me when using windows or my smartphone to uninstall / disable as many unused applications as possible and I wondered if anyone can let me know if this will result in any system streamlining performance gains in Ubuntu?\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: As long as the program we are talking about is not a service (examples of those are mysql, apache) it will not impede on the speed of your system. And even those services tend to be rather quiet when not actively used.\nThe only benefit you will see is that there is less to update where there are updates. But that is not worth all the trouble tracking down the software you want to uninstall and uninstall it.\n", "Q: Touchpad won't work after Ubuntu 14.04 install on Toshiba Satellite S55-B5266 laptop So I got a new Toshiba Satellite S55-B5266 laptop that had Windows 8.1 on it, installed at the factory. I decided to remove Windows 8.1, reformat the HDD and install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on it, and so far everything looks okay except for the touchpad, which is completely unresponsive - it can't move the cursor, and the buttons have no noticeable effect. From what I read after Googling the issue, it looks like this may be a known bug:\nDoes anybody know of any workarounds, or other options? I have already tried the FN+F5, FN+F9+F5, CTRL+F5, CTRL+FN+F5, etc. None of those had any noticeable effect.

As far as I can see Ubuntu doesn't detect any problems, but there obviously is one because the touchpad is unresponsive. And to reiterate, I did try the FN+F5 to no effect.\nAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Restart your laptop and while restarting press Fn+F2 to enter into BIOS and press Fn+F5 in order to refresh the hardware settings (although you cant see the BIOS getting refreshed). That's it and now just save and exit from BIOS and your touchpad starts working.\nIt worked for me.\n\nA: Look at me, answering my own question here. Oh well, hopefully this will help someone else. \nMy trackpad works now - I tried installing new packages, hunting around for tips etc and did not find anything that worked until today, when I tried what I found at https://askubuntu.com/a/305263/392351:\npower off, remove the battery and unplug everything else, then hold down the power button for a full 2 minutes to reset. Reboot, and if the BIOS/UEFI screen appears just exit and let the machine boot. Trackpad will work as advertised after that.\nI also tried installing various packages for synaptic (and others), including this one but ran into dependency issues. Don't know for sure if one of the packages did the trick post-reboot, or if it was the hard-reset that I did with the power button, but it works now and thats good enough :)\n", "Q: Hide partitions on RAID0 in GRUB2 I'm trying to hide two Windows versions from each other. I know how to do this on a single drive, however, it seems to be somewhat more difficult on a RAID0. More precisely, I don't know how to determine the exact order for the parttool.\nThis is an example of what I have so far in /etc/grub.d/40_custom:\nmenuentry \"Work\" {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ntfs\n    set root='(/dev/mapper/isw_hjcbchkb)'\n    parttool (hd0,0) hidden-\n    parttool (hd0,1) hidden+\n    parttool (hd0,4) hidden-\n    parttool (hd0,5) hidden-\n    parttool (hd0,1) boot-\n    parttool (hd0,0) boot+\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set B36431DD6432B247\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nThe system boots up, but it seems that I dont' have the exact order for the partitions.

Maybe there's a way to logically divide one display into more display areas?  My current situation looks kind of like this issue which unfortunately was never really solved unless I want to add a source change myself:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/37739/split-a-physical-x-display-into-two-virtual-displays\nIf I look at amdcccle (amd catalyst control center) and view the display info for the monitors hooked up though the displayPort, it mysteriously says that MST is not available.\nSupport wise - everything I have seems to indicate that support is present.  ATI has Eyefinity support on the graphics chip.  DisplayPort is new enough to have Multi-monitor support.  StarTech claims that the adapter supports Linux (this may be an empty notion of course).\nCurrent setup (not working):\nHP Elitebook 8570w + XUbuntu 14.04 x64 LTS + DisplayPort using MST (multi streaming support) + Startech.com SP122DP2DVI (adapter with DisplayPort to 2 DVI ports)\nAlso using 2 ACER 1080p monitors that are DVI compatible.\nNotes -\nGraphics stuff on HP Elitebook is ATI/AMD Chelsea XT GL [Firepro M4000] with Eyefinity support through the DisplayPort connector.  Currently running the proprietary driver from ATI (fglrx) as listed in the XUbuntu system.  An open source driver is available, but I figure I'll get less success that way (xserver-xorg-video-ati).\n\nA: I found a solution after digging for a while!\nThe ATI driver (fglrx) with the Startech adapter allowed me to set one monitor at 3840x1080 resolution (which really was 2 1920x1080 monitors passed through the adapter as one giant monitor).  This worked in terms of hardware output, but my desktop was split down the middle between the two DVI outputs because XUbuntu + ATI driver still thinks it's only one monitor coming through the display port.  Enter fakeXRandr!\nRead more here:\nhttps://github.com/phillipberndt/fakexrandr\ngit clone https://github.com/phillipberndt/fakexrandr\nmake && sudo make install\n\nThis points xrandr to a hacked version of libXrandr.so.  Now at this point, I re-ran the config in the ATI driver to pull in the giant monitor (3840x1080) and doing so re-ran xrandr with the hacked lib which finally spit out the two seperate displays recognized by X!  \nWhen it works you can do:\nxrandr --verbose\n\nThen see that xrandr has detected another logical monitor space ( mine was called DFP_ derived from DFP1 )!\nUPDATE - fakexrandr now provides its own tool that lets you customize how to split displays into logical xrandr monitors. See here:\nhttps://github.com/phillipberndt/fakexrandr\nUnder sections Installation and How To\nAfter configuring with tool fakexrandr-manage, reboot the system to reload xrandr and it will take your fakexrandr configuration into account -- xrandr will then have sub-displays labelled with numbers at the end for each split.\nNotes -\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm pretty sure this solution doesn't solve the MST problem, but the little passthrough box I have is basically configured to output the two DVI displays as one single DisplayPort display.  This works, but is annoying and we have to use a software hack like fakeXRandr to go around it.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to open a terminal in the current directory? I am new to Ubuntu, and was wondering whether it is posible to open a terminal with a path matching your current location in the file manager? In Windows it was very easy, but how do you do it in Linux?\n\nA: Here is a small overview about the three file managers I know:\nThe file manager Nemo (part of the Cinnamon DE) has a built-in context menu option to both \"Open as root\" and \"Open in a terminal\".\nThe file manager Thunar (part of the Xubuntu/XFCE DE) even provides a feature to simply create user defined tasks that appear in the context menu. As an example, there is \"Open a terminal here\" included. I added an \"Open as root\" for directories myself. You can specify the command to execute, which parameters to give it and on which kinds of files/directories to show it.\nI can expand my answer and add a more detailed explanation on how to create a custom context menu entry in Thunar. Please leave me a comment if anybody is interested.\nThe file manager Nautilus (part of the Unity DE, default for normal Ubuntu) provides neither of the two features built in nor the possibility to create custom context menu entries. However, there exists an additionally installable package to extend Nautilus' capabilities to open a folder in a terminal (see the answer of @ethanbmnz).\nPS: I know that \"Open as root\" was not a feature requested by the OP, but I think it's related and not less useful than \"Open in a terminal\".\n\nA: No extra installation required simply right click inside the directory and take \n\nopen in terminal\n\nI am using ubuntu 16.04\n\nA: From https://askubuntu.com/a/207448/371765\nRun sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal in a terminal, followed by nautilus -q to quit all open nautilus windows. When nautilus is next opened, a line saying open in terminal should appear in the right click menu.\nPlease note that the package nautilus-open-terminal is in the universe repositories.\n\nA: comes within nautilus in 15.04 by default.\n\nA: If you mean opening a new terminal in a new window, with the same location as the previously opened terminal.\nThen,\nCtrl+Shift+N does the work for me.\nI am on Ubuntu 17.04.\nThank you.\n\nA: The nautilus-open-terminal package doesn't seem to be available for recent versions of Ubuntu, as noted in the similar question linked in the accepted answer.\nThis answer to that same question works for me in Ubuntu 20.04. Install nautilus-extension-gnome-terminal by running\nsudo apt install nautilus-extension-gnome-terminal \n\nand then quit Nautilus with\nnautilus -q\n\nand restart by opening any folder.\n\nA: Update , April 11\nCreate a simple script opendirectory.sh with the following contents\n#!/bin/sh\n# set -x\nOPENDIR=$(zenity --entry --text=\"Type or paste address\");gnome-terminal --working-directory=\"$OPENDIR\" &\n\nBind that script to a shortcut , for instance Ctrl+Alt\n+i, or whatever you like.\nNow, when you are in some directory in nautilus, press Ctrl+L to open address bar. Copy the address of your current directory with Ctrl+X.\nLauch the shortcut you just created and paste the address with Ctrl+V in to the dialog. Terminal should pop-up with the directory that you told the dialog to open.\nIMHO, this is as \"native\" as it gets and doesn't require additional installation. Sure, it is not a right click type of thing, but it works and can be implemented quickly. Will work for other file managers that don't support this option,too\nOriginal Post\nTechnically nautilus, the default file manager, doesnt have open terminal here option, but there is a plug in for that in the repositories. You might be more interested in other file managers that support this option out of the box\nAs a workaround you could try the following:\nCtrl+L willopen the text filed for entering address, with the current working directory highlighted. Cut that out with CtrlX, and paste into terminal with CtrlShiftV or right click. Alternative , use run dialog to launch gnome-terminal --working-directory= and paste whatever you copied after = sign.\nDrag and drop: Drag the button/tab (not sure how it's called) into terminal, add cd in front\n\nAnother way: Open the file manager and terminal. Drag and drop the folder  you want to access into terminal, and add cd to the path.\nFor instance, if I want to access bin directory in my /home/serg/ directory, i would drag that directory to terminal and it would appear as '/home/serg/bin'. Next, add cd, so that the whole line is cd '/home/serg/bin' .\n\nA: With Dolphin , KDE's file manager, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal as a panel in the same window. Use the keyboard shortcut F4 or the menu: Control → Panels → Terminal. \nThe working directory is synchronized between the two panels; changing directories in either of the two panels will also change it in the other. Sweet!\n\nIn this screenshot you even see the sweetness of having this as a toolbar item in the top.\n\n*Open a terminal in a new window. Use Shift+F4 to do that. It will not have the feature to have the working directory synchronized, but it just opens a new window with the current working directory set.\nThe same applies to other apps in KDE Plasma, like the Kate text editor (enable it in Kate's settings, it's a built-in plug-in). Opening a terminal with a single keyboard shortcut from your text editor with the context of the file, is simply brilliant.\n\nA: I understand that an answer is already provided and accepted, but I stumbled across this from my Ubuntu MATE configuration using the caja file manager, and naturally, couldn't readily apply any of these solutions.\nSo for those of you who may be looking for a way to do this in Caja on the MATE Desktop, here's something that may work (it worked for me):\nFire up dconf-editor from your start menu (or alternatively, from the terminal). Navigate to org.mate.interface and observe a checkbox with description \"Can Change Accels\". Mark that box as true.\nNow fire up caja your favorite way. Go to the alt-menu at the top, look under \"Files\", and spot the option \"Open in terminal\" as always. Except this time, gently move your mouse (or keyboard scope) over to that option, and press a button combination (I like to use Ctrl-Alt-H meaning \"open terminal HERE\"). Now you should see that button combination on the drop-down menu, and should be able to use it. Note that you shouldn't set it to an existing combo such as the default Ctrl-Alt-T to open a terminal at your ~ directory. This method will not override existing combos.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Another solution with a script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nxfce4-terminal --working-directory=\"$(xclip -o)\" \n\nI assign one shortkey to this script (in my case, F4). \nWhen I am in a directory in my file manager, I press CTRL+L to highlight the directory path, and after that I press F4 (the key I chose above to open the terminal). This is a another way of using the PC without taking the hands off your keyboard.\nInstead of xfce4-terminal, you can use gnome-terminal.\n\nA: You can easily open terminal for current file path by right clicking on the folder. At the right click menu there will be an option for Open in Terminal. This option will open the terminal for the current directory.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 20 just install nautilus-actions.\n\nA: It is a really simple matter to deal with. You can simply install nautilus open terminal package and if you install it , then you can simply open terminal from any folder/director you wish just by right clicking and clicking on open terminal here. \nTo install it \nall you want to do is to install it by opening a terminal, hope you know how. \nThen type this command and press enter :\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal\nAfter installing go to a folder and try it. Just open home folder and right click >> Then select Open terminal here\nor you have another choices to install other file manager and in some of them there is the function to open terminal here on right click menu. Nemo has it. Good luck\n", "Q: Run OpenGL apps with CUDA with Nvidia Optimus and Bumblebee I am attempting to start learning CUDA using my old laptop with a hybrid Nvidia GT650M/Intel iGPU setup. I have tried following the instructions on a couple resources[1,2,3]. Those resources helped tremendously and gave me a working nvcc. However, while most of the samples compiled, none of the samples that use OpenGL work at all. I assume this is because my installed OpenGL drivers are for my Intel GPU, but I was forced to not install the OpenGL drivers during the Nvidia driver installation to avoid overwriting the old drivers (for my intel card) that I need.\nIs it possible to install the nvidia opengl drivers alongside the ones I have installed already?

I have a laptop with Optimus technology (Nvidia GT520M discrete card + Intel embedded card), thus I had to pass \"--no-opengl-libs\" flag to installer script. I was following Nvidia guide from here: CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf.  Unfortunately this method turned out to be unreliable if I wanted to run OpenGL samples and work with graphics (samples which don't use OpenGL work properly). It gives me an error \"cudaErrorDevicesUnavailable\". Carefully reading installation guide tells you that CUDA 7.5 works with ubuntu 14.04 and kernel version 3.13! Ok, no problem, I've formatted partition once again and run script... but It didn't work either. And again carefully reading installation guide tells you that using package manager installation type is recommended where possible! So removed runfile installed cuda driver and toolkit and used .deb packages. BAM! and it works like a charm! :)\nIn conclusion, the easies and probably the safest way of installing CUDA 7.5 on Optimus laptop is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ubuntu 14.04 with 3.13 (trusty) kernel version \n\n*Follow Package Manager installation part from Nvidia guide: CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf\n[EDIT]\nUnfortunately it seems that debugging won't work this way...\n", "Q: While in a Terminal doing an update I get a few error messages.

I came across the concept of runlevels.\nWhat confuses me is the fact that when i run the command \nwho -r\n\nI see that i am in runlevel 2 which represents multi-user, text mode, no servers. Why is it that I still have access to my GUI yet I am in run level 2? I thought that I was in runlevel 4 which is multi-user, GUI mode, no servers.\nPlease I need clarification. Thank you.\n\nA: Ubuntu does not use the concept of Runlevels any more. Ubuntu now uses the new upstart based init which depends solely on the occurrence of an event and then triggering defined response(s) to start/kill programs. \nRunlevel on the other hand, is from the old SysV style init daemon that depends on the runlevel to decide which program will start and which will be killed, you need to put the scripts in the defined directories for each runlevel (/etc/rc{0..6}.d).\nFor the reason of compatibility Ubuntu still supports running SysV runlevels scripts from /etc/rc{0..6}.d based on the runlevel set in the variable DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL of /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf, but the concept of runlevels is somewhat obsolete and you should not be too much bothered about it. \n", "Q: Wireless not working Ubuntu 14.04 Lenovo g50 since I installed ubuntu on my lenovo I can only get wireless internet for about 5 minutes after I restart my computer, and then it just stops responding.

I have such a conflict on my own Toshiba Satellite, and solved it with the following steps:\nFirst, make sure your Wi-Fi (or any wireless) switch is ON before booting. The BIOS will see it on and leave it that way. Never use 'Fn + F8' or any other methods to turn off the wireless.

( with jumper resetting )\nAnd it should work.\n\nA: It's critical to know if you're booting in BIOS mode or in EFI mode. Boot to Linux and type the following commands (shown here with possible outputs):\n$ sudo parted /dev/sda print | grep Table\nPartition Table: gpt\n$ ls /sys/firmware/\nacpi  efi  memmap\n\nThe first command reveals (by proxy) your Windows boot mode. (Note that this assumes you've got one disk, /dev/sda. If you've got two or more disks, you must issue that command against the Windows boot disk.) Windows boots from GPT disks only in EFI/UEFI mode, and from MBR disks (which parted identifies as being of type msdos) only in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\nThe second command shows the presence of a directory called /sys/firmware/efi when Ubuntu is booted in EFI mode, and the absence of such a directory when the system is booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\nThis example shows a GPT disk (indicative of an EFI-mode install of Windows, if it were present on this computer) and an EFI-mode boot of Linux.\nBecause there are two possibilities for both options, there are four possibilities in total:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode: In this case, running Boot Repair might fix your problem, although I can't make any promises about that.\n\n*Both installed in EFI/UEFI mode: My suspicion is that you're running into this long-standing bug. Try disabling Secure Boot or installing rEFInd.\n\n*Windows installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, Ubuntu in EFI mode: Install a BIOS-mode version of GRUB to replace the EFI-mode version; or install rEFInd and edit its refind.conf file to add hdbios to the scanfor options. (This combination of boot modes is pretty rare except on Macs.)\n\n*Windows installed in EFI/UEFI mode, Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode: Install your choice of EFI boot loader for Linux. Boot Repair can usually set up GRUB correctly, but be sure to do this in EFI mode; or installing rEFInd will also usually work -- but it's best to do this in EFI mode. See my answer to this question for more detail on this possibility.\n\n", "Q: Can somebody explain this changing `du` output? Just tripped across a weird case of du.

Anything I missed?\n\nA: The highest screen resolution of 1366 x 768 in Systems Settings -> Displays is correct. The Dell Latitude E7240 Notebook comes with a display with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels and a screen size of 12.5 inches. Even with the screen resolution set to 1366 x 768, it's sometimes going to be difficult to read text on the screen without being rather close to it.\n", "Q: xubuntu freezes every time I am asking this as there does not seem a clear way to diagnose the problem.

I have a desktop PC running Xubuntu 14.04 LTS on kernel 3.13.0-48-generic. It is an older PC. \n\nA: I am also seeing this issue on Kubuntu 14.04.  It started after the update to kernel 3.13.0-48-generic\nYou can restart the system without hard resetting it by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1 (brings you to command prompt)  Login and then type: \"sudo shutdown now -r\"  this will at least allow you to bring down the system cleanly.   \nI am going to boot into an earlier kernel until there is a new kernel.

In each language-folder (e.g. fr_FR) the files have to be renamed so the package of each language has (at least) three files with the following names: \n\n\n*\n\n*dict.conf\n\n*main.aff\n\n*main.dic\n\nReview --> Spell Check --> Set Language --> Set Default\n\n\nUPDATE: Ubuntu 18.04 with WPS 10.1, name and location of the dictionaries was not the decisive factor in my case: the new dictionaries would not appear in the list (under Review --> Spell Check --> Set Language --> Set Default) unless they were first added under Review --> Spell Check  --> Spell Check --> Custom dictionaries --> Add. \n\n\n\nAnd there added from any location without changing their names - only then resulting in them being listed as indicated initially under Review --> Spell Check --> Set Language --> Set Default.\n\n\nA: I had a slightly different issue/variations:\nRunning Ubuntu 16.04 and installed WPS Office via Snap\n(First issue (off-topic) was a complaint about symbol fonts so I had to find and install them.)\nWith a Snap installation the dictionaries for me are installed under ~/snap/wps-office/1/.kingsoft/office6/dicts\nJust don't extract the zip in a way that results in the files being owned by root. WPS Office won't be able to read the files (I learnt the hard way).\nIt's possible I didn't have to \"add custom dictionary\"; I can't be sure now, but I've since deleted their entries and I can view and switch my dictionary \"Review > Spell Check > Set Language > (Default)\" as normal.\n", "Q: How to use 'cut' command for finding temperature using tlp?

When I hit the shift key (shift key only, not shift+some other key), the input language will change. It is very annoying because when you type English frequently you need to hold the shift key to type capital letters, and very often by a small mismatch in timing of holding the key, the input language is changed and I need to change it back. How can I disable this shortcut of the single shift key?\nEdit: I've checked the system text entry setting, and the \"switch to next source\" short-cut setting is \"Super+Space\". The \"Switch to previous source\" short-cut is set to be \"shift+Super+Space\". I don't know why I can switch language by hitting the shift key only.\n\nA: Seems to be a bug. I'll explain how to get out of it... as long as you have both US and INTL (US International) input methods available, but first...\nHere's how I found it... (CAUTION: DON'T DO THIS IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE ANNOYED) First, go to US keyboard entry method, while having INTL also available. Now, hold the right Alt key, and press the shift key (tested with left-shift). Now, you are in US-International mode, and the right Alt key you are holding down, is no longer an alt key.... so when you release it, the system gets an AltGR released signal, rather than an Alt key being released. Now if you press and release Shift, it will cycle input methods.\nOkay, now... to get out of that annoying mode, select INTL input method. Hold Alt-GR (Right Alt) and press Space as many times as it takes to select US input method. Then release the Right-Alt key (Alt-Gr).  Note: This MAY HAVE OTHER SIDE EFFECTS, since the system didn't get any signal that Alt-Gr was released.  I haven't noted any such side-effects, but that doesn't mean there aren't any.\nTo anyone who might try to fix this bug: While you're at it, please make Ctrl-Space do something more useful, such as cycling input methods in reverse, or switching to the last input method that some key was pressed in other than Shift, Alt, and Ctrl.  As it is right now, with more than 3 keyboard layouts, there is NO QUICK WAY to switch back and forth between an arbitrarily chosen pair of available input methods.  I'm using multiple input methods for DuoLingo, and it's a pain to have to press Alt-Shift Alt-Shift Alt-Shift Alt-Shift Alt-Shift to switch languages, and then Alt-Shift Alt-Shift Alt-Shift Alt-Shift Alt-Shift Alt-Shift Alt-Shift Alt-Shift to switch back, as I am asked to translate to and from a course's target language.\n(If anyone doubts it's that bad, look at how many language courses I'm taking.

Unfortunately, some older Linux kernels ignored HPA. If you partitioned the disk with such a kernel, a newer kernel (which honors HPA settings) would show the disk as being suddenly smaller than the older kernel showed, and you'd get exactly the symptoms you report.\nTo check this, use hdparm and its -N option, as in:\n$ sudo hdparm -N /dev/sda\n\n/dev/sda:\n max sectors   = 488397168/488397168, HPA is disabled\n\nIn this case, HPA is disabled; but if it's enabled, the output will reveal that fact. If this is what you find, you can set it correctly with the same command, but you must add a p and the correct size, as in:\n$ sudo hdparm -N p488397168\n\nYou'll have to adjust the value passed based on the actual size of your disk.\n\nA: My guess is: 10.4 is so old that the gpt partition tools contained bugs.\nfrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_hard_disk_drives\n\n2010 – First 3.0 terabyte hard drive[23][24] (Seagate, Western\nDigital)\n2010 – First Hard Drive Manufactured by using the Advanced\nFormat of 4,096 bytes a block (\"4K\") instead of 512 bytes a block[25]\n2\n\nSolution:\n\n*\n\n*get a new disk,\n\n*create new table and partitions with up to date tools,\n\n*move your data to the new disk.\n\nsorry for not having a better idea.\n\nA: Other solution:\nIf the bug is known, maybe Ubuntu fixes the partition table during installation.\nif not, at least server 10.4 has not reached it's end of life yet https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases\nSearch for or file a bug at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/\nBut I fear they won't find a solution before end of life is reached (April 30, 2015)\nin any case you will need space to create a backup of your system. So you might need a new disk regardless which solution you choose.\n\nA: Ok.\nThanks to everyone who tried to help.\nIt seems like this had not much to do with ubuntu, and was basically a BIOS bug. \nSome Gigabyte motherboards write a copy of their BIOS to hard disks immediately when the disks are connected. So, simply by connecting a new HD on the motherboard it is likely that it will be written to, and HPA will be activated reducing the size of the disk.\nUbuntu 10.04 by default ignores HPA (libata.ignore_hpa=1 kernel parameter) and so treated the whole disk as if it had not HPA activated, using all the sectors from the disk.\nUbuntu 14.04 by default honors HPA (libata.ignore_hpa=0 kernel parameter) and so treated the disk as if it was smaller than it actually is.\nThe disks were originally partitioned form 10.04 for the total sum of sectors. Changing the cabling resulted in finally activating HPA on all the disks of the RAID.\nI was very lucky because the original partitioning did not use all the available space, but had left enough space at the end of the drive for the sectors that HPA was stealing. I dont know why, perhaps it was aligning to the cylinder previous to last.\nThe workaround I concluded to, was to repartition the drives as if they were smaller than they actually are, as big as they are made to be by HPA. I boot to 14.04 and fixed the partitions with gedit. \nTHE PROCESS WAS VERY DANGEROUS AND COULD POTENTIALLY DESTROY ALL MY DATA.\nDO NOT REPEAT IT IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THE DRIVES.\nAfter I fixed all three drives both OS's could use the raid, so I actually installed 14.04 on hard disk. When I booted at 10.04 the partitioning utilities complained that I was not using all of the disk, but would ask before changing anything so no harm done. To fix this little inconvenience I added libata.ignore_hpa=0 to the kernel parameters of my /etc/default/grub.conf for 10.04 and updated grub.\nFor the sake of history only, here is the DANGEROUS process I used to convert the drives partition scheme for /dev/sda (it was the same for all drives):\nroot@ubuntu:/cdrom/HPA_recovery# gdisk /dev/sda\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.8\n\nWarning!

I want to run a VPS for torrenting Ubuntu's upcoming release. Is it legal?\nSome VPS providers are unsure about it.\nI am not talking about modifying Ubuntu here. Just distributing the ones that Ubuntu already provides.\n\nA: Using torrent is legal (if you don't download or share copyrighted content, or if the copyright holder permits it). Canonical provides some .torrent files to download Ubuntu. You can get them here.\nYou can also create a new torrent of a Ubuntu iso, but this doesn't have much sense. \n\nA: Torrenting itself is not illegal; it's just a method of file transfer using multiple servers (the downloaders act as servers).\nAny legal issues around using it relate to the content. If you do not have the legal right to download or upload material, then downloading or uploading it via Torrent is illegal.\nCanonical (the company that develops Ubuntu) provides links to obtain Ubuntu images by torrenting. Obviously, you have the right to download it, so it is not illegal to do so by this method.\nAccording to Wikipedia (emphasis added): \n\nThe use of the BitTorrent protocol for unauthorized sharing of copyrighted content has led to a variety of novel legal issues. While the technology and related platforms are perfectly legal, law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies worldwide are developing new tactics and increasingly pursuing ways to address this avenue of infringement. Notably, the use of BitTorrent in connection with copyrighted material may make the issuer of the BitTorrent file, link or metadata liable as an infringing party under the copyright laws of various governments. Similarly, the use of BitTorrent to procure illegal materials could potentially make end users liable as an accomplice under various laws.\n\n", "Q: System76 laptops battery life I have been impressed by the System76 laptops as they are designed for and ship with Ubuntu.  I strongly feel the most important feature of a portable computer is that it is actually portable, i.e. has a long battery life.  I could not find battery life estimates on their webpage.  If you have used one of these computers with Ubuntu, how long was it able to run on battery power?\nI realize this varies, particularly when turning on an Nvidia card but what has been your experience?\nPlease feel free to redirect me if this question would be more appropriate somewhere else.\n\nA: I think this is not included as it varies with what spec you choose - e.g. looking at the specs of this model off of their front page, the fact you can have a i5 or i7 CPU, as well as choose what display, RAM, wifi etc it has will affect battery life - I will note that I think 62.16 Wh is very good compared to (lower-power) laptops I have had, but as this is off the front page is may be more expensive than most anyway.\nWhat I would recommend doing is either search for reviews (doing this for most purchases helps anyway) - e.g. this one says:\n\nI’ve not done extensive testing of the battery life, but most of the\n  time Ubuntu suggests two hours from a full charge, and that seems to\n  be true. While it definitely isn’t something you’d completely rely on\n  while on the go, it’s understandable considering all this great\n  hardware this laptop houses. If you’re doing something chilled like\n  casual tweeting and IM’ing, then the laptop should be able to last\n  three full hours.\n\nOr try contacting System76 via their support services and asking them directly.\n", "Q: Packaging bash script with dh-make I have installed dh-make by installing other packages as recommended by this page which depend on it (I am listing all packages which could have installed it as well because I am not certain which one did):\nsudo apt-get install gnupg pbuilder ubuntu-dev-tools bzr-builddeb apt-file\n\nAnd run it with:\ndh_make\n\nIn the directory where my folder is located containing my bash script (the folder's name is based on the template <packagename>-<version>), but now it is giving me these options:\nType of package: single binary, indep binary, multiple binary, library, kernel module, kernel patch?\n [s/i/m/l/k/n]\n\nAs I am packaging a bash script, which one do I choose if any? And what do they all mean?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.10\nRelease:    14.10\n\nPackage Information:\ndh-make:\n  Installed: 1.20140617\n  Candidate: 1.20140617\n  Version table:\n *** 1.20140617 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ utopic/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n\nA: The descriptions of the options are all given in man dh_make:\n   Single binary (s)\n          The package will generate a single binary .deb  package.  It  is\n          the standard case, so if you don't know what to do, choose this.\n\n   Arch-Independent (i)\n          The  package  will  generate  a  single  package  that  is arch-\n          independent.\n\n   Multiple binary (m)\n          The package will generate multiple binary .deb packages from one\n          source  package. Choose this for larger packages that need to be\n          split.\n\n   Library (l)\n          The package will generate at least  two  binaries.  One  library\n          package   containing  just  the  lib  in  /usr/lib  and  another\n          *-dev_*.deb package containing documentation and C headers.\n\n   Kernel module (k)\n          The package will generate a  binary-all  kernel  module  -source\n          package for use with the make-kpkg(1) command. It also generates\n          a binary package for additional utilities,  daemons,  etc.  that\n          may come with the source.\n\n   Kernel patch\n          The  package will generate a package that can be used for kernel\n          patches.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*For a single program, you would normally use s, but in your case, it is a shell script, which does not depend on the architecture of the target system, so pick i.\n\n*For m (multiple binary), it would generate multiple packages (an example would be the various vim packages, which are all generated from the same source package).\n\n", "Q: Grub kernel upgrade (two different systems) My system is partitioned this way:\nhdda 500 giga (/dev/sda)\nssd 20 giga   (/dev/sdb)\n/dev/sda\n/boot(300 mega)\n/home(remaining space)\n(/dev/sdb)\n/ (14 giga main system with ubuntu 14.04 x64)\n/ (7  giga to test another O.S. versions , actually with ubuntu 14.04 )\nswap (2 giga)\nAfter install ubuntu 14.04 to (/dev/sdb) second partition(7 giga) i suppose grub has been replaced . The problem is even after upgrade kernel to last version using my main system ((/dev/sdb 14 giga)it doesn`t go automatically to last version after reboot  even choosing with grub customizer , just if reboot and go to second system installed and use grub customizer there\n\nA: With two installs you have to normally do two updates. Whichever system's grub is in MBR must be booted and sudo update-grub run to find newer kernel in second install.\nBut since you have two drives, put main working install's grub into the MBR of sdb. And keep test install's grub in MBR of sda. When you install grub defaults to sda. Better to use Something Else and on partitioning screen change to MBR of same drive.\nYou can boot into install in sdb and install grub to the SSD's MBR. Then change BIOS to boot SSD.\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb\nsudo update-grub\n\nIf you can only boot from sda, then just change /dev/sda.\nBut if you originally installed grub to sda, it remembers that setting for reinstall on major updates. So you also need to reset that:\nTo see what drive grub2 uses see this line (BIOS only, not UEFI)   - grub-pc/install_devices:\nsudo debconf-show grub-pc  \n\nIt will show drive model & serial number\nto see drive info\nsudo lshw -C Disk -short \n\nto get grub2 to remember where to reinstall on updates:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc \n\nEnter thru first pages,spacebar to choose/unchoose drive, enter to accept, do not choose partitions\nYou can also avoid the double update by manually adding your own boot stanza in 40_custom and directly boot partition or link to most current kernel.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MaintenanceFreeCustomGrub2Screen\nUEFI systems do not use grub-pc but grub-efi-amd64 if 64 bit or perhaps signed versions. So all of above is only for BIOS based systems.\n", "Q: Ubuntu MATE: How replace  by Super_L for opening the menu? I'd like to open the MATE Menu with the Super_L key.

These files contain null bytes (\\00) which is actually part of the php output and should not be removed.\nUp until now, I've been using gedit to view these files. It complains about the encoding but is usueful in that it highlights the null bytes. This only seems to work with small files though.

I'd much prefer an editor which replaces said bytes with the standard 'illegal character' (question mark set in a diamond glyph).\n\nA: You should consider using Hex Editor for such purposes, as normal editors don't display non-printing characters  unless its some side-effect or glitch.\nI suggest Bless :\n\nAnd in console you can use Midnight Commander's  mcview - F4 switches to hex mode:\n\n", "Q: awk to compare two files, extract, output to third I've written a script in Python, but it's not fast enough for this job.\n I'm thinking line-by-line processing would work better.\nI have two files with two columns and potentially hundreds of millions of lines (bioinformatics). The two files (file1, file2) are similar, tab-delimited, with the first column containing strings of letters and numbers and the second column containing integers.  The headers are name, count in each file.\nI need to produce a tab-delimited file where: the first entry of each row is from the name column, but only those names that are in both file1 and file2, the second entry is the count for that name from file 1; and the third entry is the count for that name from file2,  preserving headers.\nAfter much reading, here is my attempt:\nawk '(NR == FNR) {\n   n0[$1] = 0; \n   n1[$1] = 0; \n   next\n }     {\n   if($1 in n0) {\n     n2[$2] = 0\n   }\n } END {\n   for (i in n0) (j in n1) (k in n2) {\n     print i,\"\\t\",j,\"\\t\",k\n   } \n}' file1 file2\n\nso clearly I don't really know what I'm doing with creating arrays (I'm not sure they can be two-dimensional so I tried to use three).\nIf someone could correct the awk script using the same basic flow syntax as in the above, that would be excellent and much appreciated.\nalso, to convert it to an executable .sh file, what should be done?\nfrom  the elements of the first column of the two files (only those elements which are present in both of the two files find the intersection of values between the two files in the first column, and then \n\nA: You would be much better off if your input is sorted on the first column, since then you can directly use the join command:\n$ cat foo \na   1\nb   2\nc   3\nd   4\n$ cat bar\nb   1\nd   4\ne   5\nn   2\n$ join -t $'\\t' <(sort foo) <(sort bar)                                                                                                            \nb   2   1\nd   4   4\n\nIn any case, I'd recommend sorting - without sorting, you're potentially looking at O(m*n) operations, but with sorting, O(m*log(m) + n*log(n) + min(m,n)) operations - it should save you a while if you optimize your methods instead of the language you use. \nWith awk, you can get away with a single array:\nawk 'NR==FNR { n[$1] = $2; next } ($1 in n) {print $1, n[$1], $2}' foo bar\n\nThis should be reasonably fast as well, if $i in n is.\n\nA: With bash:\nAssuming file1:\nabc123 123456\ndef456 789123\nghi789 456789\n\nAnd file2:\nabc123 789123\n\nThis will output file3:\nabc123 123456 789123\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile read line1; do\n    var1=$(echo $line1 | tr '\\t' '\\n')\n    while read line2; do\n        var2=$(echo $line2 | tr '\\t' '\\n')\n        if [ \"${var1[0]}\" == \"${var2[0]}\" ]; then\n            printf \"%s\\t%s\\t%s\\n\" \"${var1[0]}\" \"${var1[1]}\" \"${var1[2]}\"\n        fi\n    done < file2\ndone < file1\n\n", "Q: Drivers / setup for Macbook Pro 11,3 webcam and Ubuntu 14.10?

Context: I have one large monitor, a desktop and a laptop. I use the large monitor and a HDMI switch when I'm at home.

I know how to write the script but I don't know from whence to launch it, or if there is such a place. Note that I am referring to physical screens not synergy screens.\n\nA: Assuming the change in resolution is both causing the error and the trigger to run your script, periodicalloy checking the resolution and run your script if it changes should do the job:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ncommand = \"</path/to/script_to_run>\"\n\ndef get_res():\n    # get resolution\n    xr = subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    pos = xr.index(\"current\")\n    return [int(xr[pos+1]), int(xr[pos+3].replace(\",\", \"\") )]\n\nres1 = get_res()\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(5)\n    res2 = get_res()\n    if res2 != res1:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n    res1 = res2\n\nIt checks the current resolution every five seconds and runs the script, as set in the head section, if there is a resolution change.\nHow to use\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as check_resolution.py\n\n\n*In the head section, set the path to your script to restart synergy\n\n\n*Test-run it by running it in a terminal window with the command:\n python3 /path/to/check_resolution.py\n\n\n\n*if all works fine, add it to your startup applications.\nNote\nThe command as a startup application probably needs a small break to make sure the desktop is fully loaded when the script starts. The command to add to Startup Applications would then be:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15&&python3 /path/to/check_resolution.py\n\nAdd to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add, add the command.\n\nEdit\nJust to be complete:\nIf for some reason, you'd prefer a bash version of the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction get_res {\n    echo $(xrandr -q | awk -F'current' -F',' 'NR==1 {gsub(\"( |current)\",\"\");print $2}')\n}\n\nres1=$(get_res)\n\nwhile true; do\n  sleep 5\n  res2=$(get_res)\n  if [ \"$res1\" != \"$res2\" ]; then\n      <command_to_run>\n  fi\n  res1=$res2\ndone\n\nThe use is pretty much the same except the language extension:\ncheck_resolution.sh\n\nand the command to run it:\n/bin/bash /path/to/check_resolution.sh\n\nand replace <command_to_run> by the command to restart synergy or the path to your script.\n", "Q: how to launch Sketch Up via wine I'm trying to install google sketchup make via wine, the installation is successful but when I click to launch sketchup nothing happens, just nothing... \nwine: 1.7\nubuntu: 14.04\nsketch up :2015\nany suggestions? \n\nA: I solved the problem. \nYou just install playonlinux via Software Center.\nThen search for SketchUp in playonlinux and just follow the installation procedure...\n", "Q: provide_data doesn't send data when required_keys not satisfied (juju charm using services framework) I'm not sure if I'm using this the correct way.

I'm working on a fix for it, but in the meantime, I do have a workaround.\nIn the ServiceManager setup, pass the key=value that you want to send over the relation wire, and don't pass anything for the required_data relation.\ndef manage():\n    manager = ServiceManager([\n        {\n            'service': 'example',\n            'ports': [80],  # ports to after start\n            'provided_data': [\n                RabbitMQRelation(username='example', vhost='/')\n            ],\n            'required_data': [\n               RabbitMQRelation(),\n            ],\n            'data_ready': [\n                configure_rabbitmq,\n            ],\n            'data_lost': [\n            ],\n        },\n    ])\n    manager.manage()\n\nThe Relation class basically short-circuits the required_keys by only setting it if there's no provided data to handle.\nclass RabbitMQRelation(helpers.RelationContext):\n    name = 'amqp'\n    interface = 'rabbitmq'\n\n    vhost = None\n    username = None\n    required_keys = []\n\n    def __init__(self, username=None, vhost=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        This works around a bug with the RelationContext class that expects\n        the required keys to be set before it will call provide_data.\n        \"\"\"\n        if username and vhost:\n            self.username = username\n            self.vhost = vhost\n        else:\n            self.required_keys = ['private-address', 'hostname', 'password']\n\n        super(RabbitMQRelation, self).__init__(self.name)\n\n", "Q: Can you backup with Duplicity (or similar) with Amazon Cloud Drive? There are a number of excellent tutorials on using duplicity (and sometimes duply to simplify) to backup to Amazon S3:\nhttp://old.blog.phusion.nl/2013/11/11/duplicity-s3-easy-cheap-encrypted-automated-full-disk-backups-for-your-servers/\nI have used a few of these with great success, but I was wondering if it would be possible to modify them somehow to use the new Amazon Cloud Drive as this now offers \"unlimited\" space for only $60 per year. (sorry if that sounds like an advert!)\nIt seems like the protocols are very similar, I just would have no idea where to start with authentication and options!\n\nA: Authentication is done via \"Login with Amazon\" which is based on OAuth2. There is a getting started guide here.  They offer an HTTP API for accessing the data. I never looked at the duplicity connectors, but there might be some that utilize HTTP already.\n\nA: This GitHub repo seems to provide the required backend for duplicity to work with Amazon Cloud Drive. \nInstructions:\nGet the latest version from Launchpad (go here and click download file to get the raw version)\ncd to wherever the file was saved and do\ncp adbackend.py /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/backends/\n\nto use, run \nduplicity source_path ad:///backup/my_new_backup\n\n", "Q: Unable to complete Android Studio installation in Ubuntu 14.10 The installation wizard of Android Studio is unable to complete the installation process.

Something like Hex Workshop? I'm looking for something for my Computer Forensics class.\nThanks\n\nA: I think that wxHexEditor fits your needs.\n\nwxHexEditor is not an ordinary hex editor, but could work as low level\n  disk editor too. If you have problems with your HDD or partition, you\n  can recover your data from HDD or from partition via editing sectors\n  in raw hex. You can edit your partition tables or you could recover\n  files from File System by hand with help of wxHexEditor. Or you might\n  want to analyze your big binary files, partitions, devices... If you\n  need a good reverse engineer tool like a good hex editor, you welcome.\n  wxHexEditor could edit HDD/SDD disk devices or partitions in raw up to\n  exabyte sizes.\n\nYou can install it with this command:\nsudo apt-get install wxhexeditor\n\nOfficial webpage: http://www.wxhexeditor.org/\n\nA: LDE - The linux disk editor, but it works mainly on Ext2/Ext3 and its using is little bit \n", "Q: Running Executable Files (Popcorn Time & Gunpoint) I currently have two x-executable file on my system after downloading them. Neither of them run when double clicking on them. \nThe first file is a game, Gunpoint, downloaded from the developer's website.

Oddly enough, this worked for me on a previous install of Ubuntu without any problems. I purchased a new SSD recently so went with a fresh install. \nI'm running 14.04 LTS. \n\nA: right click on the file and click properties. Make sure in the permissions tab That \"Allow executing file as program\" is checked. Open up a terminal, and cd into the directory the file is in. Simply type ./filename replacing filename with the name of your file.\n\nA: The executable files does not open up by default on the last ubuntu versions. Try opening them from command-line:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Dash and search Terminal\n\n*Open the Terminal app\n\n*Drag the executable to the terminal\n\n*Press Return\nAlso you can make a permanent fix for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file manager (a.k.a. nautilus).  \n\n*Go to Edit -> Preferences. \n\n*Under the behavior tab, check the run executable files when they are opened option\n\n", "Q: Large, unexplained gap in Unity launcher As you can tell from the screenshot, there is a large gap in my Unity launcher for no reason.

I can't boot into safe mode either.\nDoes anyone know another way to open a terminal?  Is there a file on the computer I can access directly?\n\nA: Try pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1. That should allow you to enter tty1. If that doesn't work, try Ctrl+Alt+F2, Ctrl+Alt+F3, etc. etc.\nIt will say something like:\nUbuntu 14.10 ComputerName tty1\nComputerName Login:\nType your username here and hit enter, and then your password.\nYou should be able to access tty and go from there.\n\nA: It might be an error in lightdm. Try installing gdm and uninstall lightdm and reboot and see if that works\nIf that doesnt work uninstall gdm and reinstall lightdm. Reboot. Then enter unity-tweak-tool --reset into tty. Reboot. See if that works\n\nA: Try this fix:\nFrom a terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\nThis will reinstall unity and reset the config.\nIf that doesn't work then:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nrm --recursive /home/user/.config/dconf/user\n\nbut be aware that this solution will install all of the packages from ubuntu-desktop (including things like gedit, sound utility, archive managers etc.)\n", "Q: Bootable partition I usually create a bootable live image of a CD on USB devices with this command:\nsudo dd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdx\nThe problem is that after using this command, I cannot copy additional files on the device without formatting it.

To specify a partition, you need to use the little number at the end of the device name: /dev/sbd1 or whatever number it is. Make sure that partition is bootable using gparted, and selecting boot from the \"manage flags\" option.

I can move mouse, but nothing reacts. When I turn on mySQL server and apache and browse hosted web, it freezes really often.\nI don't recall installing anything special that month ago, which could cause this. Before that, I had ubuntu 12.04 and everything was fine. My RAM is only half full and the application for testing a system didn't show anything.\nI am on a Lenovo Z570 notebook, i5 dual core CPU, 4 GB RAM. One physical 750GB disk, three NTFS partitions (I have dualboot with windows) and the linux filesystem.\nAny idea, what might cause this?\nThank you very much for any help!\nEDIT: few new things:\nIt seems that this bug applies only to the Home folder and subfolders. Whenever I create, copy or delete file or folder, everything is fine for 3 seconds and then the HDD starts spinning and everything freezes for 20-30 seconds.\nI remembered, that maybe that month ago a friend changed some config files so that my three partitions would attach during the boot. Maybe that could have caused this issue, but can't tell for sure.\nScreenshot of System monitor: \n\n\nA: Finally I solved it by uninstalling applications and deleting folders in my home folder. I had 4 bitnami stacks (which is apache, mysql server and application each) installed at one time at home folder, each with about 10 000 files inside. I uninstalled 2 of them and the freeze time dropped from 30 seconds to 2 seconds and then I unistalled all of them and it's perfectly quick as it should be now.\n", "Q: Alternative for Google+ auto backup of image... how would I automate resize and transfer? I get by with Linux but I'm by no means a guru, so please be nice :)\nOn my other devices (Android, Windows) I use Picasa and its Auto Backup feature to automatically resize and upload to my Google drive.  Honestly, I don't really know how it works, it just works.  I back up my photos full size to my Ubuntu server locally and from there to Crash Plan so this isn't about data security, it is specifically for Google+ sharing and the \"neat\" features they have.  Because they allow unlimited photos for anything < 2048*2048 I want to resize.\nSo how can I:\n\n\n*\n\n*resize\n\n*upload\n\n*stay synced\n\n\nPreferably from the command line, as it is a headless server.\nOh, I should probably say this:  I did just add my network folder containing all those folders into my Windows machine's Picasa... and that's working - sort of.  Problem #1 is that it says its going to take 42 days to complete.  The bigger problem, however, is that it is really trashing my Internet connection.  I'm not sure why.  I did a test with local photos and it doesn't affect my connection at all, but my VOIP was dying periodically and I narrowed it down to it being whenever the server was being accessed by Picasa for a photo.  Anyway, for long term success I think I'd like to do the above rather than using Picasa for this task.\n\nA: There is a way to install Google photos auto backup on Ubuntu (taken from here on Reddit, worked for me...)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install google photos auto backup on Windows machine (may be a virtual PC or an ordinary PC)\n\n*Start > Run > regedit\n\n*go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Google\\Picasa\\Picasa2\\Preferences\n\n*Then on Menu > registry > export registry file.\nIt should look something like this:  \nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Google\\Picasa\\Picasa2\\Preferences]\n\"GoogleOAuth\"=hex:xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,\\      xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx\n\"GoogleOAuthEmail\"=\"youremail@gmail.com\"\n\"GoogleOAuthServices\"=\"mail,lh2,cp,cp.manager,mailrelay,plus.stream.write,    plus.circles.read,plus.profiles.read,plus.me,plus.media.upload,plus.media.    readonly,plus.settings,youtube,\"\n\"GoogleOAuthVersion\"=dword:00000005\n\n\n*Install playOnLinux. Go to configure, create a new 32-bit Windows virtual drive, call it GooglePhotosBackup. Select the new virtual drive.

I only use one or two passphrases to get in, and I've tried every single password that I can think of using in the last few years.\nIs there anything that I could be missing that would be causing this to happen? I'm stumped and cannot understand why I can't get in. I do not have my mount passphrase, and really need the files off this computer. \nPossibly relevant: this SSD is unable to be booted in the Lenovo computer that I took it from, but it does show up on both OS X and via USB. Could the configuration have gotten messed up somehow? My computer shut down randomly one day and simply refuses to boot into the SSD partition from the bootloader, although it does see it. \nWhat steps can I take to further diagnose this problem and get into my folder? I am willing to try everything and will report back with outputs. Any help is very appreciated, and I will throw btc to anybody that can help me out. Thank you. \n\nA: First of all, if I remember correctly you have to check a box to install Ubuntu with an encrypted home directory, but I could be wrong. It certainly looks like it's encrypted.\nSecondly, the bad news: if you encrypted the home directory at boot, it doesn't use your account password, but a separate pass phrase. After you first booted a pop up comes up with the question if you want to backup your encryption pass phrase for the home directory, recommending you get save it somewhere safe. There is a way to get the password at a later stage, but only if you can access it, so before anything goes wrong with your system. If you don't have the pass phrase, the only possible way to get it back is by brute forcing it, which, at the moment, is practically impossible.\nNow that I think of it, after writing the previous text, if you made regular backups, you should be able get the key back. Did you make backups?\nEdit: \nJust test this answer and it works to get the pass phrase on a still working system, but you should save it somewhere safe, of course. :D\nEdit2: \nSo I just looked further into it and if: \n\n\n*\n\n*you have a backup of your old home files AND;\n\n*it included the ~/.ecryptfs folder with the wrapped-passphrase file\nyou can unlock it with the command:\n\necryptfs-unwrap-passphrase /path/to/wrapped-passphrase\n\nIt will ask for a password. This is the account password you said you remember correctly. It should give you a output of seemingly random characters: this is the pass phrase to unlock the home partition.\nI hope you still have that file backed up. Let me know if you run into any problems.\n", "Q: What's a good Soundflower replacement for Ubuntu? I just made the switch from OS X to Ubuntu a couple days ago.  On OS X, I relied on Soundflower in conjunction with Audacity to help me flawlessly record audio from my computer's speakers to a new MP3 file (or whatever type of audio file).

Problem Setup\nI am working on a home automation system (as a side project), and I plan on using the Odroid U3 running Ubuntu 14.04 in conjunction with ROS to act as individual nodes for this system. Each node will perform different tasks, so the actual source-code housed on each device will be different.

So I downloaded an Ubuntu Distro onto a usb drive, and installed it from said usb drive. \nEverything was fine. Ubuntu was working flawlessly. \nA couple of hours later, I went to shut down my pc. When I clicked on the shutdown button in Ubuntu, the computer froze. I was able to move the mouse around, but I couldn't select anything. I ended up having to just hold the power button in till the pc shut off. \nI then went to power on the pc to make sure nothing was adversely effected, and it booted me directly into windows 8. \nI found out how to access my windows boot menu, and attempted to go in and boot back into Ubuntu. The problem is, there is no Ubuntu entry in my windows boot menu. \nI have went as far as to try booting into \"try Ubuntu\" from the usb drive and running boot repair. It didn't pop out any errors, so I went back into the windows boot menu expecting there to now be an Ubuntu entry, but there is still none. Then I went into the windows boot menu and turned off secure boot, and reattempted the boot repair, still nothing. So basically now I have Ubuntu installed somewhere on my pc, and I can't figure out how to access it!\nI should also mention that this Ubuntu installation was over a preinstalled windows 8.\nI'm stuck dead in the water here, and I need to figure this out. \nPlease help!\nP.s. I am a brand new Ubuntu user, so this is especially confusing to me.\n\nA: After a dual boot install, the Ubuntu boot menu is used. It is called Grub and will allow you to choose which OS to boot right at startup.\nInstalling Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (UEFI Supported)\nHere is an excerpt from the above question's top answer:\n\nYOUR COMPUTER BOOTS DIRECTLY TO WINDOWS\nThis is a common problem and if you do not get a GRUB menu , re-installing or repairing grub will NOT HELP\nEvery BIOS is different, it might look like one of the following pictures:\nUEFI 1\nUEFI 2\nNotice the \"UEFI Boot Option Priority\" or \"Boot Option Menu\" . Usually Windows is the default and Ubuntu (or as in the second picture elementary OS) will be an option.\nOnce you select Ubuntu on the UEFI boot menu you will then get a grub menu. You should be able to boot either Ubuntu or Windows from the grub menu.\nAnother issue that could make the system boot directly to Windows (without even showing the GRUB menu) is if either Windows took hold of the boot manager or after installing Ubuntu, the EFI partition was not properly configured for Windows. To solve this, simply go to Windows and open a terminal, then type the following (Need Administrative Privileges):\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\nThis will configure the Windows Boot Manager to take into consideration the GRUB Boot Manager. This could still happen even after running the Boot Repair from within Ubuntu. So making sure that Windows reads the Ubuntu EFI partition will solve it.\n\n", "Q: apt-get paralyzed by failed dropbox install I tried to install dropbox on my system (Linux Mint 13). apt-get proceeded to download the 'dropbox' package.

It is recommended that I use gksu. My problem is that when I use gksu, it freezes my display, opens a overlay, then asks for my password. This interrupts me while multitasking.\nAccording to this: askubuntu.com/questions/11760, the configuration files will be saved as root in my home directory, this is what I don't want, and gksu will set the home directory to root, so the configuration files will be saved there.

Open a terminal and execute the following commands:\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nMake sure the file says the following, nothing more and nothing less:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nThen, press CTRL + o to save the file and press CTRL + x to exit the file.\nAlso, edit /etc/network/interfaces:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nand make sure that file has only these contents:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nAgain, press CTRL + o to save the file and press CTRL + x to exit the file.\nFinally, execute the following commands and then connect the ethernet cable and it should automatically detect and switch to the wired connection:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nTo explain: You do not want the network as \"managed\" because you want to use \"auto\" instead. Also, you had the default device set to wireless for some reason. Both of those together along with the \"no-auto-...\" flag basically disabled your auto ethernet. \nNormally, however, when the system has a wired and a wireless connection, the wired connection will always be favored and used even when they are both connected because eth0 should be the default device by default.\n\n\nFirst:\nUnplug in your ethernet cable and run the following commands from an open terminal:\nsudo mkdir /etc/NetworkManager/connections-backup\nsudo mv /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/* /etc/NetworkManager/connections-backup\n\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nPlug the ethernet cable in. Click on the network-manager icon on your desktop panel to open the dropdown menu. Then, click on \"Auto eth0\" \n\nIf you see some message similar to \"device is not managed\" or \"device is managed\" please let me know and I'll post instructions on how to get around that.\nIf the network doesn't come up like it's supposed to after plugging in the ethernet cable, run the following command to refresh network-manager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nOr, run these commands to unload and reload the driver:\nsudo modprobe -r b44\nsudo modprobe b44\n\nIf it says that b44 is in use, run \nlsmod | grep b44\n\nand it should show what module is using b44. Use \nsudo modprobe -r \n\nfollowed by the module name you wish to disable before pressing enter.\nThen, use \nsudo modprobe b44 \n\nto load the driver again.\nMake sure your firewall is not blocking ports 67, 68, or 53 (dhcp, dhcp, and dns respectively). If you have not done anything to explicitly block these ports they are most likely not blocked as you would've had to have set a rule yourself to block them. \n\nA: Finally suspected the Ethernet port not working,and at, system setting / network showed wired unplugged. I ordered from ebay \"USB to Ethernet connector\" and soonest i connected, Ethernet became live. \n", "Q: why did my old history and extensions appear in a fresh install of chrome? I uninstalled chrome with:\nsudo apt-get purge google-chrome-stable\n\nThe next day I reinstalled it with: \nsudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable\n\nAll the old settings from the old install appeared when I opened it up. \n\nA: None of those commands removes any files in your $HOME directory. \nWhen you apt-get remove apt will leave the (system) configuration files in /etc in place. When you apt-get purge apt will remove the (system) configuration files in /etc as well.\n\nremove\n       remove is identical to install except that packages are removed\n       instead of installed. Note the removing a package leaves its\n       configuration files in system. If a plus sign is appended to the\n       package name (with no intervening space), the identified package\n       will be installed instead of removed.\n\npurge\n       purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and\n       purged (any configuration files are deleted too).\n\n\nSee http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jaunty/man8/apt-get.8.html for details\nNeither option will remove configuration files in your home ($HOME) directory, those have to be removed manually.\nThus when you re-installed it reused all the files you already have.\nTo remove all that additional stuff run\nrm -rf ~/.config/google-chrome\n\n", "Q: You are missing the following 32-bit libraries, and Steam may not run: libc.so.6 I have recently moved over from SteamOS which is Debian Wheazy.

I found this code:\nconvert *.jpg my_new.pdf\n\nThis worked, but it still only prints one label per sheet of paper. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you all in advance. \n\nA: Instead of making a PDF directly from JPG using imagemagick, I would use Libreoffice  to tile the images onto the sheet size needed, then print directly or export as a PDF - this allows you to easily customize the layout, size, etc (to change the the page size go to Format > Page):\n\nIf you want to use imagemagick and print multiple labels per sheet, it would be possible montage option to convert to a tiled image (the easiest way to repeat images is to make multiple copies within the folder):\nconvert *.jpg -tile 2x3 out.jpg\n\n(to add spacing between each image you can use the geometry option:)\nconvert in*.jpg -tile 2x3 -geometry +2+2 out.jpg\n\nThen you can convert that image to a PDF (if you want a margin of sorts you can try adding a border to the image by adding the options -border 4x4 -bordercolor \"#FFFFFF\"). Here I have specified the page size as A4:\nconvert out.jpg -page A4 -format pdf out.pdf\n\nWith both these options you may want to check if the DPI (dots per inch - how not pixelated it is when printed I supposed) is high enough for what you need to do.\n", "Q: Cannot access internet from WiFi except my home WiFi!

I am trying some ssh tricks and stuck on a server.\nIs there a way to make ssh hosts.deny read before hosts.allow?\n\nA: Access control based on hosts.deny and hosts.allow is provided by the TCP wrappers library (libwrap0). This is what its README file says:\n\nThe wrapper programs have no interaction with the client user (or with\n  the client process).  Nor do the wrappers interact with the server\n  application. This has two major advantages: 1) the wrappers are\n  application-independent, so that the same program can protect many\n  kinds of network services; 2) no interaction also means that the\n  wrappers are invisible from outside (at least for authorized users).\n\nAlso look at the hosts_access manpage:\n\nACCESS CONTROL FILES\n       The access control software consults two files. The search stops at the\n       first match:\n\n       ·      Access  will  be  granted when a (daemon,client) pair matches an\n              entry in the /etc/hosts.allow file.\n\n       ·      Otherwise, access will be denied  when  a  (daemon,client)  pair\n              matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.deny file.\n\n       ·      Otherwise, access will be granted.\n\n\nSo, unless you compile a custom version of libwrap0, there's no way to change its current behavior.\n\nA: As far as i know, if a same IP is on both /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/hosts.allow then the access will be granted. To force the deny you should ensure that the script that adds to /etc/hosts.deny does remove the IP from /etc/hosts.allow.\n", "Q: Where to report a bug/feature for the Today scope of Ubuntu Touch?

Do I need to change any settings on the server running the site ? \nThe server uses ubuntu server 14.04..\n\nA: To be able to port forward from Internet to your web server, you can't have a NAT behind a NAT.\nTo figure that out, your routers external address must be the same as seen when you surf on internet.\nSo log into your router and look up what IPv4 address you have on your external interface. You might get help from this site, it has worked for me before: http://portforward.com/\nThen you have to see what address other servers see when you surf out from your LAN, behind the router.  I use this siter, but there are others:\nhttp://www.whatismyip.com/\nIt the first are a private address and/or those two addresses are not the same, then your modem is giving you a private address and not a public one.  That makes it impossible (or at least hard) to make your server accessable from Internet.\nThe solution for both your problems are of course IPv6, as you will not give you a private address but a real public /64 network of IPv6 addresses for your LAN.

No browser or internet service (dropbox) is working. I've checked the ethernet cable and the wireless connection.\nThe laptop is a macbook pro 2007 running Ubuntu 14.04 with triple boot.\nThe network connection works perfectly form the windows 8.1 installation.\nAny hint on how to get internet connection on Ubuntu again?\n\nA: How does your /etc/resolv.conf file look like? \nTry this command: sudo echo \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\" > /etc/resolv.conf\nor\nDo it manually by open the resolv.conf file and put in the DNS server you'd like use.\n\nA: I think you should check new location.\nAdd your nameserver to/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base. \nAfterwards, run resolvconf -u.\n\nA: If this is a desktop edition, you'd have to use network-manager to check your DNS servers. This can be done by clicking the network icon in the taskbar(bottom right) (if on wifi, it has a wifi symbol, if on ethernet it has a plug-like symbol) and selecting edit connections. Then double-click on your connection and proceed to IPv4 settings. Here, you can add the 8.8.8.8 DNS server. When adding DNS servers, however, I'd recommend you also change the dropdown box which says DHCP to DHCP for address only, so the DHCP doesn't supply you with a DNS server as well. (If you want to do this, you'll also need a router IP, which can be obtained by typing route -4 -n at commandline. It will give output like this:\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         10.0.0.2        0.0.0.0         UG    6      0        0 home\n10.0.0.0        0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 home\n127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo\n\nSimply use the Gateway value as your router.\nIf it's a server edition, you can follow @Kasper's instructions:\nsudo echo \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\" > /etc/resolv.conf\nor manually edit the resolv.conf file and put in the dns server\nyou'd like use.\n\nA: The problem is probably because of the package resolvconf, see man page.\nIt is used to simplify adding and removing DNS servers from different sources.  So the previous contents of /etc/resolv.conf is now managed by the the program resolvconf(8).\nSo, if you manage your network from /etc/network/interfaces, which is is good for servers, you just add dns-nameservers and dns-search for the right interface.  See man page for resolveconf(8).\nIf it is from NM, I don't have a qlue, probably add to the static settings for the interfaces.  If managed from DHCP, it should be set anyway.\n", "Q: File storage location for ubuntu application In my application I plan to store files locally ( exported files ) and import files which user copy via USB to the disk. Where to locate such application files ? Is there some recomendation ?\n\nA: If your application is designed to run under application confinement (usually required if you plan to ship through the click store), it will be restricted to access files only within its own silo.  Files you wish to store permanently should be stored in .local/share/<appid>.  <appid> is the unique string identifying your application, showing up as the applicationName in your MainView (if you're using QML) and the \"Package path\" in the click store.  (Why yes, let's give this thing a few different names!)\nIf you're not worried about these restrictions, you can place the files anywhere.  If these are files which the user shouldn't have to worry about, you should follow the XDG Base Directory Specification.  (Brief summary: configuration files in ~/.config/, data files in ~/.local/share/.)   If these are files that the user may want to access directly, I feel you ought to let the user choose where they get stored.\n", "Q: Blurry screen during and after install process Alright so I've been stumped on this issue for a while now and I'm not sure how to fix it. I'm trying to migrate from Windows 8.1 however when I try to install Ubuntu (or any other OS that supports secure boot) the screen is really blurry during and after the install process. I took a picture of what it's looking like\n \nfrom farther away it looks worse and I can barely make anything out. I'm not sure how to go about solving this issue so any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\nMotherboard - ASUS M5A97 R2.0\nGraphics Card - NVIDIA GTX 750 Ti\n\nA: I had the same issue with my GTX 750 Ti. I was able to resolve it with the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add nomodeset to bootloader (How do I set 'nomodeset' after I've already installed Ubuntu?)\n\n*Run the following commands in terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346\n\n\n*Restart the computer\n\n*Remove the repository after restart (Thanks @Pilot6 ): \nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nStep #1 is just to get you into the terminal since everything on the OS is blurry otherwise. \n\nA: It looks to me as if your X installation is running at too low of a resolution. Try this for diagnostics (and maybe to fix it):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Settings.\n\n*Select Displays.\n\n*Look at the value next to Resolution. Ideally, it will match the maximum resolution of your monitor. If it is, then something else is the cause; but if it's ridiculously low, that confirms my hypothesis.\n\n*If the Resolution value is too low, click it and see if there are other options. If you're very lucky, you'll be able to adjust the resolution to something reasonable.\n\n\nIf the resolution is too low but you can't increase it, there are other ways to adjust it, as described in these questions/answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I set the correct monitor resolution with Nvidia drivers for a monitor that does not send EDID?\n\n*Xubuntu 14.04: Screen Resolution 1440x900, no xorg.conf or lightdm.conf\n\n*How do I configure a xorg.conf to use my monitor's native resolution?\n\n*Nvidia drivers seem to ignore customized xorg.conf in 13.10? How to configure?\nThere are others along the same lines.\n\nA: I've had the same issue.  Installed on multi monitors but disconnecting them after install and reconnecting them so they were redetected fixed the issue. \nI now have the issue again on install after messing up my earlier success by trying to update to 15.04.  \nBack at the installer again. All is blurry.  But changed monitors from a Benq which wants to run at 1920x1080 to a 720p TV has given me a readable screen.

But when I open up digikam, it shows me very few of my albums.  I faithfully copied across my settings, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.kde/share/apps/digikam/*\n\n*~/.kde/share/config/digikamrc\n\n*~/Photos/* with all my photos and including the sqlite database digikam4.db\nBut when I started, digikam didn't find most of my albums.  I opened up digikam4.db from backups and after digikam had opened, and found that most of my albums had been deleted.  How can I get digikam to show everything again?\n\nA: Turns out that digikam saves the full path to the photos directory, not just relative to your home directory.  I had to correct this in a few places as I had changed username when moving laptops, so the full path to the photos had changed from /home/user1/Photos to /home/user2/Photos.\nFirst I had to edit the text file digikamrc - gedit ~/.kde/share/config/digikamrc and search for user1.  The settings were called \"Database Name\" and \"Database Name Thumbnails\".\nThen I had to edit some settings in the sqlite file.  I did this by using the sqlitebrowser GUI app which allowed me to open digikam4.db, choose each table one by one, and then edit the contents by double-clicking on a cell in a table.  The tables that needed updating were:\n\n\n*\n\n*AlbumRoots - this had the full path to the albums in the identifier column.  I had to change volumeid:?path=%2Fhome%2Fuser1%2FPhotos to volumeid:?path=%2Fhome%2Fuser2%2FPhotos and similar\n\n*Tags - the iconkde column has some entries where the tag image is a photo, which is saved as the full path to the photo, so they needed their paths updating.\n\n", "Q: Touchscreen not working on Toughbook CF-C2 I have a Panasonic Toughbook CF-C2CQAZXCM with the touchpad (NOT the touchpad+digitizer) and I cannot get the touchscreen to work.

Before anybody screams at me, I've scoured the internet looking for threads, because Lenovo apparently decides to over complicate things.\nSo here we go:\nLenovo g500s, relatively new. I use elementary OS in a VM typically, but now I'd rather dual boot for school. My CD drive is spazzing out, and whenever I attempt to make a bootable USB drive through UNetBootin or whatever, I can boot into it, but all I get is some white lines and dots across the top half of my screen.\nI attempted to buy an external DVD drive for the live CD...\nSince Lenovos have some button next to the power button which brings you to the bios (UEFI I guess, not really bios) instead of being able to press f12 like any other computer, I go and look at my boot options. The USB DVD drive isn't registering, and all I get under my boot options is the windows boot manager. Disabling Secure Boot doesn't help either.\nBut what does seem to work is changing from UEFI to \"Legacy Support\". But I can still leave the option to try to boot to UEFI first, and not legacy first. After changing this and rebooting into bios, I am greeted by wonderful options showing my external dvd drive, internal hard drive, etc. These are under a title \"Legacy\" and above the \"Legacy\" is the \"EFI\" which holds the Windows boot manager.\nSo now, I'm able to boot into the live cd. Great, all is swell and dandy.\nBut I've been reading a lot of things about dual booting, and they all say that if Windows is installed using EFI, that your other OS should be installed using EFI as well. However, I feel like by changing the option before, now it's running in legacy mode or something, and I'm pretty afraid that it's going to mess something up.\nSo by doing this, am I incurring any risks, or am I just driving myself insane? I still get the options on the live CD to install alongside windows, although I'm not sure if that's what I need to do in this case. I shrank my C:\\ partition in windows to allot some room for eOS, so I think that should just give me the option to use that, correct? Or do I need to go under the \"something else\" part, and start getting lost and trying to figure that junk out?\nAnyways, thanks for the help in advance, and sorry for the horrible paranoia; these machines are pretty expensive, and I'd rather not be sitting on a 500 dollar brick.\n\nA: I have a Lenovo laptop too and i did not want to turn off the UEFI mode, so i Created a Bootable USB that is UEFI and Legacy Compatiable. I did not have to disable Fastboot or UEFI.\nThe reason i did not want to turn off the UEFI is that i feel more secure.\nyou can read about the advantages of UEFI here\nhttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-uefi\nThe main reason for not disabling UEFI for me is that it offer better security by helping to protect the pre-startup process against bootkit attacks.\nbut disabling UEFI should not be a problem and it wont mess anything up.\nLegacy mode is compatible with other systems that UEFI might not be, such as older Windows versions or some Linux operating systems.\nHope i helped\n", "Q: Hard disk fails sometimes I'm using Ubuntu kernel 3.13.0-48.\nSometimes the system fails to boot.

As far as I can make out, in the meantime there is an applet by the name of SoundAbout that is supposed to do just that. \nI installed it, paired the devices. \nAnd what I get is like the image in \nhttps://cjenkins.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/use-a-wireless-bluetooth-speaker-on-ubuntu-12-04/\n, except it says A2DP source (Receive Audio)\nI have installed blueman, and I get quite a lot, but no other output device ever pops up in pavucontrol. Therefore, everything is and remains quiet. pulseaudio-module-bluetooth is installed.\nHow can I get to make the sound system see the device?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I think you misunderstood what SoundAbout is - its not an A2DP profile for your android bluetooth stack - its an audio router that allows you to configure how audio generated in the android device is routed, very similar to what pulseaudio does (possibly it uses pulseaudio?).\nWhat you want is not possible with stock android, because the Bluetooth stack on Android does not support the A2DP sink profile. See this question for further explenation on that and how to create an application that enables bluetooth A2DP sink.\nYou might get ahead more by replacing the default Android bluetooth stack with the bluez stack used on modern Linux distribution, though it does require replacing the kernel which you can only do if you have a rooted or customized device. see here for details.\n\nA: Have you considered setting up a DLNA server instead?\nCurrently, I use MiniDLNA to run a media server that can stream music to devices that can use DLNA. There are apps for Android that provide DLNA clients, like UPnPlay.\nMiniDLNA is now called ReadyMedia, but the software is still called minidlna(d).

I am trying to get lubuntu on to an older dell laptop that will not boot from usb.  The computer is only equipped with a cd drive.  The CD image is 705 mb.  Real cute. that makes it not a cd image as it is too large.  What files can be safely deleted from this cd image to make it fit on a CD?????\n\nA: I don't know if you're aware of this, but the 14.04 is the newest LTS (Long-Term Support) version that's recommended for most users. Non-LTS versions are only supported for 9 months. The latest LTS image, Lubuntu 14.04LTS, fits on a 700MB CD. \nIt is unfortunate that the Lubuntu 14.10 desktop image is 705MB. I'm not sure, but you might be able to use overburn to make it fit on a 700MB disk. Otherwise, you can get a bigger CD, which do exist. You can get 800MB CDs and 900MB CDs. Or you could use a DVD if your computer can read them. \nIf you really do require 14.10 and none of the above can be used, then you'll want to get the Alternate installer. This uses a text-based \"GUI\", but otherwise simple to use although slightly less beautiful. It also requires a lot less resources, so it's useful for old computers with little RAM. Because it installs the system as packages, however, it is slower than using the Desktop installer. \nYou can get the Alternate installer for 14.10 here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/14.10/release/\nBut again; I recommend 14.04LTS for most users. \n\nA: You should burn lubuntu 14.4 (694 mb) to a CD then upgrade to 16.4 from there.\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/14.04/release/\n(second section of the link)\n\nA: If your CD-ROM doesn't support dvd disks too, you could try a 800MB CD. Here is how: http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/453525-how-to-burn-to-800mb-cdr/. Anyway, 800MB are very rare, if not extinct. Maybe you can manage buying one from the internet.

This is what I tried to do and it didn't work (after 50 minutes, still going on with no visible change):\nwhile IFS= read -r -d '' file; do mv $file ${file:0:2}.${file:2}; done\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: One issue you are going to have to face when renaming files in directories recursively is separating the filename (which you want to modify) from the path. You can't simply remove the path component, because then your files will end up being moved rather than simply renamed. \nTo use your original method, I think you'd need to do something like\nwhile read -r -d '' f; do \n  file=\"${f##*/}\"; path=\"${f%/*}\" \n  echo mv -- \"$path/$file\" \"$path/${file:0:2}\".\"${file:2}\"\ndone < <(find -type f -iname \"*.wav\" -print0)\n\n\nAnother option is to use the find command's -execdir instead of -exec. I think it's safe to assume that the results will get presented to your rename command (whether you use rename or mv) with just a leading ./ as the path, in which case you can do \nfind -type f -iname \"*.wav\" -execdir rename -nv -- 's|\\./..|$&.|' {} +\n\nor using a more perl-ish variant\nfind -type f -iname \"*.wav\" -execdir rename -nv -- 's|\\./..\\K|.|' {} +\n\nor using something more equivalent to your original mv approach\nfind -type f -iname \"*.wav\" -execdir bash -c 'echo mv -- \"$0\" \"${0:0:4}\".\"${0:4}\"' {} \\;\n\n(note that the substring indices have been increased by 2 to allow for the leading ./ path component).\nIf your version of find doesn't have the -execdir option, you could modify the rename regex to skip the longest matching path prefix, e.g.\nfind -type f -iname \"*.wav\" -exec rename -nv -- 's|.*/..\\K|.|' {} +\n\nNote: these expressions all have \"no-op\" switches in them (either rename's -n option, or an echo command) so that you can verify what they would do before committing. \n\nA: This can be easily done using rename:\nrename 's/ /\\./' file.txt\n\nExample:\n$ ls -l\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 0 Mar 30 04:22 01 Song Title.flac\n$ rename 's/ /\\./' 01\\ Song\\ Title.flac \n$ ls -l\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 0 Mar 30 04:22 01.Song Title.flac\n\nEDIT: If you want a space after 01.:\nrename 's/ /\\. /' file.txt\n\nIf you want all the files under the directory /directory/to/search and under all its subdirectories having extension .wav renamed as expected, try this:\nfind /directory/to/search -type f -name \"*.wav\" -execdir rename 's/(^\\d+) /$1. /' {} +\n\nTo become case insensitive:\nfind /directory/to/search -type f -iname \"*.wav\" -execdir rename 's/(^\\d+) /$1. /' {} +\n\n\nA: This works (tested):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfilenames=$(find . -type f) # stores all filenames in $filenames\nfor filename in $filenames; do # for each member in $filenames\n    newfilename=$(echo \"$filename\" | sed 's/\\(.*\\)\\/\\(..\\)\\(.*\\)$/\\1\\/\\2\\.\\3/') # edits $filename by adding a . after the second character and stores the edited string in $newfilename\n    mv \"$filename\" \"$newfilename\" # renames $filename to $newfilename\ndone\n\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu to Windows Vista with or without a usb?

Thanks for the help.\n\nA: I assume you want to wipe Windows Vista and replace with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI can try and point you in the right direction based on some recent experience I have had:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have a USB stick that is at least 2GB big.\n\n*Check your BIOS settings and make sure that it is set to boot from USB. It is important to make sure that the USB preference comes before the hard drive in priority.\n\n*Download the Ubuntu image at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop. Make sure you pick 64-bit or 32-bit depending on your computer capability.\n\n*Download a program to burn the image to your USB stick. Look here for the one recommended by Ubuntu. Also see here for the link on the Ubuntu page.\n\n*Once the burn is complete, keep the USB stick plugged in and reboot Vista, for the last time!\n\n*Then follow the instructions during the boot up.

Here is my problem:\n\nMove all non-hidden files with names ending with .jpg (regardless of\ncase - .jpg, .JPG, .JpG etc.) from your present working directory into\n/tmp.\nUse shell expansion characters to accomplish this.\n\nShell expressions are not my thing, I wonder how I can do this. Suggestions?\n\nA: You can use a shell pattern with [ ] character classes.\nTo move each file (and folder)\n\n*\n\n*that is located directly in the present working directory, and\n\n*whose name does not start with a . (i.e., the file is not hidden), and\n\n*whose name ends with .jpg or one of its seven other case variants (like .JPG or .Jpg)\n\nto /tmp, you can use the command:\nmv -- *.[Jj][Pp][Gg] /tmp\n\n\n*\n\n*This uses character classes to match any files whose names end in ., then J or j, then P or p, then G or g. Character classes (with [ ]) use more compact syntax than brace expressions ({ }), and also have the benefit that they only expand to names of files that actually exist, so you won't get error messages even if some case variants of .jpg don't appear at the end of any filenames. (You'll still see an error message if no files are matched.)\n\n*When the shell expands patterns, it excludes files that begin with . by default, so nothing special has to be done to achieve that.\n\n*The -- option ensures mv interprets everything after it as a filename and not as an option. Thus even if the pattern matches files whose names start with -, they will be treated as literal filenames and not options to mv. (This could alternatively have been achieved by prefixing the pattern with ./, i.e. mv ./*.[Jj][Pp][Gg] /tmp.)\n\nYou can enable the nocaseglob shell option and give a simple pattern.\nAn alternative way is to turn on the nocaseglob shell option, which causes filename patterns to matched case-insensitively. Since you likely don't need to change this setting for subsequent commands, you can surround the commands that enable nocaseglob and move the files in parentheses so they run in a subshell, so that the calling environment is unaffected:\n(shopt -s nocaseglob; mv -- *.jpg /tmp)\n\nSince jpg is only three characters long, you may prefer the above method with character classes. However, for case-sensitive globbing of longer words, it becomes quite handy to be able to set nocaseglob.\nWhat happens if there are files with the same name already in /tmp?\nHowever you decide to specify the pattern of files to be moved, if a file with the same name as one of the files being moved already exists in /tmp, then mv's default behavior will be followed, as we have not given mv any options about how to handle a collision. That is to say:\n\n*\n\n*If the pre-existing destination file has write permissions for the user running mv, it will be automatically and silently overwritten by the source file.\n\n*If the pre-existing destination file does not have write permissions for the user running mv, then mv will prompt the user and ask what to do. (Overwriting the file might still succeed in this case, if the user owns the pre-existing destination file.)\n\nTo specify different behavior when the destination file already exists, you can use the --backup, -b, -f, -i, -n, or -u options, as documented in:\n\n*\n\n*man mv and\n\n*11.4 mv: Move (rename) files (in the GNU coreutils reference manual).\n\n\nA: Simple:\nmv ./*.{j,J}{p,P}{g,G} /path/to/folder/\n\nor alternatively\nmv \"$(pwd)\"/*.{j,J}{p,P}{g,G} /path/to/folder/\n\n", "Q: Music on all user accounts?

Underneath, you'll find a \"properties\" field which includes other details, such as \"application.name\". \nI don't know if there are any nice libraries available, but parsing this data shouldn't be too complicated. Perhaps you'll even find some nice regexes out there. \n", "Q: Convert NTFS TO FAT file system How I change NTFS file system to FAT or MS-DOS file system without losing my data using Linux Commands?\n\nA: You can't. While converting FAT => NTFS is possible under Windows, converting the other way around is not. As a general rule, changing the file system means formatting your drive and loosing all your data. There is no way around this. In fact, that's precisely what formatting means (edited for brevity):\n\nDisk formatting is the process of preparing a [...] hard disk drive for initial use. In some cases, the formatting operation may also create one or more new file systems. [...] The third part of the process, usually termed \"high-level formatting\" most often refers to the process of generating a new file system. \n\nSo, changing a file system is formatting and formatting deletes your data. Now, it is actually possible to restore the data lost when formatting a drive. In general, when a drive is formatted, the data is not actually overwritten. It will still be stored on the hard drive but in a way that is not accessible without the use of special tools. This is really not something you want to do unless you have formatted by mistake and need to recover your data.\nIf your objective is to change the filesystem of one of your drives, you should just copy all your data somewhere else, then format, and then copy the data back. You can use mkdosfs as suggested by Dhaval Simaria to create the new file system.\nFinally, you should note that there is very rarely, if ever, a reason to use FAT32 today. NTFS is better in pretty much all ways. \n\nA: You definitely need to backup your data, either to other partition on the disk or to an external hard drive as mentioned by @karel. \nThe package you need to install in your Linux PC to be able to format disk using FAT32 file system is: \ndosfstools\n apt-get install dosfstools\n\nNow that you have the tools installed, it is time to use it, so to format the drive using FAT32.\nFirst check the partition you need to convert using:\n fdisk -l \n\nYou will see something like */dev/sda1, */dev/sda2, etc. Select the drive which you wish to convert.\nNow lets format it with:\n mkdosfs -F 32 -I /dev/sdc1 \n\nWARNING:Make sure you BACK-UP your data. Be really careful before formating a disk, you will not be able to recover your data, double check that you are applying the command to the right device before you hit ENTER.\n\nA: You will see something like */dev/sda1, */dev/sda2, etc. Select the drive which you wish to convert. Now lets format it with:\nmkdosfs -F 32 -I /dev/sdc1\nWhere is the command to \"select the drive you wish to format\"\n", "Q: Terminal error output RE: editing .conf file in Xbuntu [owned by uid 1000 istead of 0] Was curious as to the terminal error output from running sudo Kate.

I don't need it to open any web pages, just send data to the website as if I had navigated there and typed out the query myself and hit enter.\nI'd also like to effectively \"check\" checkboxes and toggle drop-down search parameters before searching.\nIn the end I plan on having a set of scripts I can run at any time to long into some of my accounts and toggle settings automatically. Is that secure? Regardless, I want to experiment with navigating websites and returning search results.\nThis probably involves examining a page's source to decide how to tell it what boxes I've checked or options I've toggled, and perhaps how to handle the returned results.\nWhat terminal commands do I need to know about? What methods should I study?\n\nA: Try lynx. You won't be disappointed :)\n\nA: There are two sides complexities in your question:\n 1. How to retrieve page source,\n 2. How to edit custom data on a parsed HTML page.\nThe first question is relatively easily achieved through such tools as wget or curl (see their manuals for more information.\nThe second question is a bit trivial and really depends on how broadly you want to modify the data. An option is parsing the source of the form and thus building a POST query through curl --data option. \nOn the other hand, current web technologies might offer a lot of trivial techniques to form an object on the browser window, through javascript lazy loading and other. For this you might use Selenium, which is quite popular among those, who automate for testing developed web pages.\n", "Q: Untrusted Application Problems I downloaded a program called I-nex so that I could see my CPU settings in Ubuntu.

I did update grub2.  \nI also tried an automatic fix via boot-repair, but got messages asking me to create a BIOS-Boot partition (think I already have this?  -see the output from GParted below), and \"disable Secure Boot in BIOS\" (could not see anything like that in my BIOS):\nPartition    File system   Mount Point    Size     Flags\n/dev/sda1    FAT32         /boot/efi)     512 MB   Boot\n/dev/sda2    ext4          /              414 GB   \n/dev/sda3     linux-swap                   32 GB\n\nI guess those are the main things.

Just adding Chinese as a language and then Chinese - Simplified for the Keyboard Input.\nBut now I would also like to write the pinyin with tones to make Flashcards in Anki. \nHow can I enable this Input?\n\nA: I found three alternatives to this issue, personally I recommend the first one:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are using ibus:\n$ sudo apt-get install ibus-m17n\nAnd then select the \"input method\": Chinese – hanyu pinyin (m17n). Then you can write the vowel and the proper tone after it, so it gets converted: a3 -> ǎ.\n\n*If using scim: then you can select zh-pinyin as the input to convert pinyin tone numbers to accents: https://eastasiastudent.net/china/mandarin/input-pinyin-tone-marks-ubuntu/\n\n*If you need something quickly: use the Character map:\n$ /usr/bin/charmap\nAfter opening it, select the Latin charmap, there you will have all the possible pinyin tones for each vocal (from 1 to 4)\n\n\nA: There are 3 ways to do it.\n\n*\n\n*By using a Compose key (AltGr), without need of changing English as the input language.\n AltGr + _ + [a] = ā\n\n AltGr + ' + [a] = á\n\n AltGr + c + [a] = ǎ\n\n AltGr + ` + [a] = à \n\nIn order to activate the Compose key, go to: Gnome Tweak Tool (Tweaks) -> Keyboard and Mouse -> Compose Key -> Right Alt.\n\n\n*By using numbers as the tones:\n [a] + 1 = ā\n\n [a] + 2 = á\n\n [a] + 3 = ǎ\n\n [a] + 4 = à \n\nGo to: Language Support -> Install/Remove Languages... -> Chinese Simplified -> Tick and Apply.\nAfter successful installation: Settings -> Region & Language -> Plus button\n-> Chinese (China) -> Chinese (hanyu pinyin (m17n)).\n\n\n*With the suggestions commonly known from web translators.\nFollow the same steps, as described in the point 2).

So you will have to type it there, then copy it and insert it where you want it.\nAnd, obviously, you will have to be connected to the internet.\n\nA: I'm 2 years late, sorry for that, but maybe it helps people getting here through search. I've created a Pinyin Editor here https://www.pinyin-editor.com/ that should pretty much be exactly what you're looking for.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Here is an online Toned Pinyin input service (free) which allow 1-step input:\n(1) go to www.typingChinese.com/main.htm.\n(2) Click on the Chn button under and to the left of the big editbox, so that it is in Western input mode.\n(3) Hold down a vowel key (a, o, e, i, u, or v), then tap a number key (similar to using Shift key to enter letter).  e.g., holding u, tap 2, produces ú; i.e., u + 2 --> ú.\n(4) Likewise, e + 4 --> è;     v + 4 --> ǜ.     o + 3 --> ǒ.    v + 5 --> ü.\n*Note: 7,8,9,0 (corresponding to tone 1-4) can also be used for both-hand-typing convenience; e.g., to type ā, press a, then tap 7 on the right side of keyboard.\nDocumentation:\nhttp://www.typingchinese.com/TypingTonedPinyin.htm\n\nA: Chinese - hanyu pinyin (m17n) in ibus\nThe \"ibus-m17n package\" mentioned above did not work for me. I am in a VirtualBox Linux Mint 19.3 Virtual Machine running on Windows 10. I found \"Rachel's Page\", and went down to the section called \"How to input Hànyǔ Pīnyīn with tones in Ibus?\" I will quote,\n\n\"Sometimes, you don't want to enter 漢字 or 汉字; sometimes, you want to\n  enter Hànyǔ Pīnyīn, the actual Latin script with tone marks. How do\n  you do that under Ibus?\nThe method you want is called \"Chinese - hanyu pinyin (m17n)\" in the\n  Input Method menu; the icon is ā with the other tone marks next to it.\n  Once this is activated, it's quite easy to type Hànyǔ Pīnyīn with tone\n  marks. Just type the spelling (for example, \"han\"), then type the\n  number of the tone (for example, \"4\"). It instantly puts the tone mark\n  over the appropriate vowel -- no additional keystrokes needed. If you\n  want to enter ü (a u with umlauts), use the old \"v\" trick.\"\n\nWorks great!\n", "Q: gcc: Skipping incompatible libraries and returning error This question is related to my previous question.

Basically I want to make the MythMote app which is available on Android available on Ubuntu Touch. Also see my other question for which I would still appreciate some answers/pointers (Ubuntu Touch App with Simple UI (QMake) - how to connect C++ to QML). I found a tutorial on extending QML with C++ (http://www.ics.com/blog/integrating-c-qml) and I'm trying to use that as my starting point.\nTherefore, in the SDK, I chose QML App with C++ plugin (qmake), chose ubuntu-core-15.04 framework and the Ubuntu Device (GCC armhf-ubuntu-sdk-15.04-vivid) as well as Desktop kit.\nRunning the app as is (no modifications) as a desktop app works.\nRunning on device (Nexus 4) fails with first a dialog saying that it found some build errors in current task, and asks if I want to ignore them.\nThe issues are:\nwarning: security_policy_groups_safe_app (debug): (REJECT) reserved policy group 'debug': not for production use\nThe debug policy group is automatically injected and should only be used for development.\nTo create a package for the store use the publish tab!\n\nerror: security_policy_version_matches_framework (app/app.apparmor): 1.2 != 1.3 (ubuntu-core-15.04)\n\nI concentrated on the error and changed the app.apparmor file so that policy version reads 1.3.\nIt then fails:\nCannot install /tmp/untitled.username_0.1_armhf.click: Framework \"ubuntu-core-15.04\" not present on system (use --force-missing-framework option to override)\n\nThe device has the GCC armhf-ubuntu-sdk-15.04-vivid kit. Should this be changed and if so, how can I do so? Auto-creating a kit re-creates the GCC armhf-ubuntu-sdk-15.04-vivid kit.\n\nA: For me, the correct combination was QML App with C++ plugin (cmake) with the framework ubuntu-sdk-14.10-utopic.\n\nA: If you try to create a QML App with the C++ plugin and use the qmake option you will not be able to install the app on a device. The error: \nFramework \"ubuntu-core-15.04\" not present on system\n\nTherefore, in the SDK, choose QML App with C++ plugin (cmake).

Is it the partition I have Ubuntu 14.10 installed on (/dev/sda2) or the one with Windows (/dev/sda1)?\nSolution: The problem was that I was using Ubuntu 10.04 Live CD. boot-repair installed right away from Ubuntu 14.10 Live USB and it solved the problem.\n\nA: The 'main partition' referred in this answer is the partition on which your Ubuntu is installed. It is the one you mount as file system root (/ directory) when you boot Ubuntu normally. So yes, in your case it would be /dev/sda2. \nYour other option was to use boot repair instead of manually reinstalling GRUB. Probably you forgot to install the PPA (sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair) or to update your software index list afterwards (sudo apt-get update). Note that you need a working internet connection for this. Otherwise you would have to download it as .deb-file and install it manually with sudo dpkg -i /path/to/file.deb.\nBut anyway, you should use a newer version of Ubuntu as live system. 10.04 is now 5 years old and hits end-of-life in April 2015. Better use 14.04 LTS (from April 2014, 5 years support) or 14.10 (from October 2014, 9 months support).

You need root privileges to access that folder, so run your filemanager as root (e.g. gksu nautilus) or work with sudo and terminal commands (cd /opt/ && sudo tar -zxvf /full/path/to/eclipse-*.tar.gz)\nNext step is to create a launcher for eclipse:\nOpen an root-editor window on the new file with gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/eclipse_php.desktop and paste the following lines into it:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Eclipse PHP\nType=Application\nExec=/opt/<your_eclipse_path>/eclipse\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/opt/<your_eclipse_path>/icon.xpm\nComment=Integrated Development Environment\nNoDisplay=false\nCategories=Development;IDE;\nName[en]=Eclipse PHP\nStartupWMClass=Eclipse_PHP\n\nSave and close it.

There's vsftpd server in my LAN; there's a hypothetical client machine in another subnet, who can't make direct connections to my FTP server; and there's a router between 2 subnets, actually VPN.\nI don't have access to the router, so I can't do port range stuff with iptables.\nOpenSSH server is running on the client, so I can forward individual ports. Also, I can connect to any port on the hypothetical FTP client. So I thought, I could forward the control port 21 to the client and make vsftpd connect directly to the client for data streams (active mode). But vsftpd says 500 Illegal PORT command, probably, because the ip address reported by the client differs from the ip of the connection made by ssh to the port 21.\n1 2015.03.30 14:28:24:0263 0015|->PWD\n1 2015.03.30 14:28:24:0279 0016|<-257 \"/okimftp\" is the current directory\n1 2015.03.30 14:28:24:0279 0000|->PORT 10,3,2,9,223,67\n1 2015.03.30 14:28:24:0279 0000|<-500 Illegal PORT command\n\nSo maybe I need some FTP proxy on the client machine, which would modify addresses in the control commands (for active mode) and either have its own backend in my LAN or control the ssh session to create additional port forwards (for passive mode)\n\nA: Solved with a pair of 3proxy.\nbackend 3proxy.cfg in my LAN:\nauth iponly\n# only allow connect to control or ephemeral ports on FTP server\nallow * * ftp.company.org 21,30000-65535\nsocks -u\n\ntunnel:\nssh@client.net -R 0.0.0.0:1080:localhost:1080\n\nfrontend 3proxy.cfg on client:\nauth iponly\n# allow host names that are resolvable only remotely\nfakeresolve\nallow *\n# chain FTP proxy to parent Socks5 proxy with remote resolve\nparent 1000 socks5+ 127.0.0.1 1080\nftppr -p2121\n\n", "Q: PPP Connection: Software Center 'Install' button is not active I'm using PPP connection with Huawei Mobile Partner dial up software on Ubuntu 14.04.

Media (mp4, mp3), mail, filemanager, documents (pdf, doc, xls), terminal, images) can all be used with a browser styled with nice modern css3.\nKeep in mind it's a server, not a workstation.\nThere would be no need for GUI applications you never use like games etc.\nAlso a proper browser would allow automatically to use the gpu on some animations of the gui using css3 3d transforms or opengl.\nThe basic stuff is already manually edited in the various config files...\nA simple php/nodejs script could allow me to handle various difficult commands...\nNeeding only the browser dependencies.\nFor example:\nI just put a headless Wheezy on my Raspberry Pi which has node on it... and I control everything over http.\nThe headless Wheezy renders low resource intensive html pages with nodejs, websockets, php, keeping the load very low (30-40mb ram total). Those pages allow me to control the server itself (stats, users), other servers (stats, users, on/off with wol) and render the content inside the browser (documents, images, music, videos). Works great on a remote machine... but if I attach a screen to the 1920x1080 capable device I see a black screen. SO:\nPutting a real desktop on it would bring me to the limit easily. using all the resources to run the environment.\nStarting a session of ONLY the browser with one of those low resource intensive html pages , the overall system usage would be slightly lower then with a real desktop. Theoretically.\nImagine a PictureFrame with touchscreen, that is able to control other devices, while rendering a nice canvas, opengl, css3 3d user interface with realtime stats. With maybe 30-40%? more horsepower.\nAnd not only would the Raspberry Pi take advantage of this but also all other headless servers that are attached to a color monitor.\n\nA: I get what you are asking. You want a browser based GUI without all the added stuff that a typical Desktop Environment provides; however, since it's still a GUI that you are looking for (you will be attaching a monitor and drawing graphics on it, aka a head) you can't call it headless. Maybe call it a \"tiny-head\" server ;-)\nA desktop environment (such as GNOME, KDE) or any other GUI is composed of multiple pieces, here is a quick overview. \nI think what you would need is a display server (such as xorg), and possibly a windows manager. Maybe also a display driver and display manager. However you won't need all the other stuff provided by a DE such as taskbar, file manager, etc. since you will be using your browser applications for that.\nAnyway, I just realized this question is over a year old so you might have figured this out already.\n\nA: This is easily solved using ssh tunnels. \nAssuming the server already has openssh-server installed:\n1.) install http proxy application on the headless server - squid works well\n    sudo apt-get install squid -y\n\n2.) from your GUI computer connect to your headless server using the ssh -CNT2gL command like this: (3128 is the port number that squid or the http-proxy is running on the headless server)\n    ssh -CNT2gL 8080:localhost:3128 username@headless-server -p 22\n\n3.) Now port 8080 on your computer is listening to port 3128 on your headless server. \n4.) configure your browser to use localhost:8080 as a proxy server. Now using your web-browser you should be able to connect to any port listening for http/https running on the headless server using the address \n    http://localhost:<port number>\n\nobviously substitute \"port number\" with the actual # of the port\n\nA: Webmin would provide you with a reasonably full set of management options through a web browser to manage a linux server. If it is a web server hosting multiple sites, you may also want to consider virtualmin for it or if you have multiple non-admin users usermin may be additionally beneficial. \nhttp://www.webmin.com/\nI'd typically recommend away from those tools because they go in and edit text config files and can generally make manually working with the configs more cumbersome. I prefer the CLI, but it does have its place. I'd simply say if you are going that direction stick to one or the other. Mixing can be painful. I haven't used these tools in many years so it could be that they are better about keeping things clean.\nStrictly speaking this isn't a GUI, but more of a specialized web-based text editor. Since all this stuff is done in a text world, I don't think you should require special opengl type stuff to do that and therefore your dependencies are basically just running a web server.\n\nA: If the point isn't to manage the server, but to have a computing environment, you may want to look at various \"personal cloud\" softwares. Here are some options. They vary dramatically in terms of features and capabilities. They typically have mobile features built in to share files and act as a dropbox like service, but some also have custom applications you can run so you can have a mail client, browser, etc.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://cozy.io/en/\n\n*https://owncloud.org/\n\n*http://www.tonido.com/\n\nA: I don't think you understand the concept of headless. Headless systems cannot have a GUI and therefore, no you cannot have a GUI browser on a headless system. Although headless systems CAN have a Text UI as it is just text.

I have recently started packaging a bash script of mine into a .deb file so that I can upload it to my PPA, and I have noticed a lot of talk about a file which seems to have been created from my source code or something called <packagename>_<versionnumber>.orig.tar.xz (<packagename> replaced by the name of the package that I am using dh-make to package, and <versionnumber> replaced by the version number). I have also noticed that a folder called debian with lots of files in it has been created, and I have been following some official Debian guides to edit the files.\nBut I still don't really understand what this .orig.tar.xz file is, what its purpose is, and how it is used with this debian folder. Could anyone explain this to me?\n\nA: Generally, <name>_<version>.orig.tar.xz or <name>_<version>.orig.tar.gz is the source archive, as released by the project. It's simply renamed to fit the vagaries of the Debian packaging system. \nUsually, for packaging purposes, you need to unpack <name>_<version>.orig.tar.xz in the current folder and then place the debian folder inside the unpacked archive. It is important to keep the archive in place. \nTHEN you do the packaging stuff that you wish, either building binaries, or building the source archives (which results in a *.changes file that would be dput-ed to a PPA, for example). \n", "Q: Dell 7537 syslog over 40 GB I am a new user and not a techie, but i love ubuntu.

Obviously, some dependencies are also dependencies for other packages, so those will stay installed. \nHowever, if you run sudo apt-get remove test or sudo apt-get purge test, then it will let you know that there are a bunch of dependencies that can be removed (albeit manually via sudo apt-get autoremove) if there are any dependencies that only that package relied on.\nNow, I don't have a super credible source (no Debian or Ubuntu documentation) currently (searching now.)

If your local IP adress is, for example, '192.168.0.1' then your remote machine should be on that same subnet e.g. '192.168.0.2'. Find out the adress which is on the same subnet using ifconfig on the remote machine, then try to ping this adress from your local machine. Post the details and i'll try to help you.\n\nA: First of all, you should use names to refer to your machines on the network, rather than IPs. You should be able to configure a DHCP+DNS server like dnsmasq fairly easily, to allow you to provide meaningful names that you will remember.\nBeyond that, the device you are connecting to, must be running an FTP server, in order for FTP to be usable.\n", "Q: Why does the keyboard indicator show my custom keyboard on a dark gray background? I am using Ubuntu 14.10 with the Unity interface, and I have created a custom keyboard layout by manually creating an xkb symbols file.

However I checked and the partition is MBR and I have a Legacy BIOS (not UEFI).\nI have made two extra partitions in Windows but when trying to install these don't appear (I tried to format them in NTFS, FAT32, swap, ext...) - it just appears a single partition with 500Gb free space, that corresponds to all disk.\nThe Question Is, How to Install Ubuntu along Windows?\n\nA: Open the Windows disk utility and make sure that it is a \"basic disk\".  If you create more than 4 primary partitions, it automatically converts to \"dynamic disk\", which Ubuntu doesn't support.  You will need to remove some partitions to get it back down to 4 in order to convert it back to a basic disk.\n", "Q: Desktop Settings deleted after update I have installed Ubuntu 14.10 multiple times and after a software update my desktop customizations are deleted.\nI did a fresh install and about 70 programs were updated following a reboot.\nAfter the reboot, the background is missing and my customizations are gone, and other appearance things seem to have changed. \nAs of now deactivating the Auto-Login feature works, but when I open a Nautilus window it opens a half screen window every time & it cannot be changed\nI found that logging out and logging back in gets me back my desktop mostly normally (there's still a Nautilus malfunction.) Though if I just select my name from the gear icon it asks me to log in and my wallpaper's there, but after it's not.\n\nA: Answer found!\nI was also not able to get a menu by right-clicking on the desktop. Searching on this issue brought the solution, which is to use the Gnome Tweak Tool. I had apparently switched off Desktop Icons even though none were selected. Switching this on but leaving no icons selected restored normal behaviour to the desktop and wallpaper.\n", "Q: Join two files keeping the element order of one of them I have two files\nFile1\n03873\n03872\n03871\n03870\n......\n\nFile2\n00001    0.867\n00002    0.855\n00003    0.864\n00004    0.855\n...\n03870    0.825\n03871    0.852\n03872    0.326\n03873    0.852\n\nI want to append the values in the II column of File 2 in File 1, keeping the order of element that File 1 has.\nFile3\n03873    0.852\n03872    0.326\n03871    0.852\n03870    0.825\n......\n\nI could do this with join, but I do not want to sort File 1.

The output is printed in the order it is found in file2 and that is sorted. To keep the order found in file1, just inverse it (I also removed the needless a[$1]\"\\t\"$2, you were already saving $0 in a):\n$ awk -F \"\\t\" 'FNR==NR{a[$1]=$0; next}$1 in a {print a[$1]}' file2 file1 \n03873   0.852   \n03872   0.326   \n03871   0.852   \n03870   0.825   \n\n", "Q: Help with a Bash script or some program to sort files and move to different folders is there anyone out there who can help me sort some files with a bash script or terminal commands (or even a little Java program) that can be used to sort and and move files to new folders? I have been trying for days, but haven't figured it out.\nI have a folder called \"webpages\" with hundreds of html files. Roughly speaking, they are divided in three categories, so I will need to run one script three times with different variables or a script that can do all of the sorting and moving at once.\nI want to search for certain strings in the files and then send the files that match to new folders. To simplify, some of the web pages are about politics, some about business and some about computers. So, lets say I want to search all the files in the folder \"webpages\" for the words \"election\", \"stock market\" and \"open source\" and move the files containing the word \"election\" to a folder called \"politics\", the files containing the word \"stock market\" to a folder called \"business\" and the files containing the term \"open source\" to a folder called \"computers\". \nLike I said, I have tried to figure it out, but just got laughed at for my efforts. I am no expert. Thank you! \n\nA: Suppose you have the following files in the current directory:\n\n\n*\n\n*a/sm1, with the content \"a stock market b\"\n\n*b/sm2, with the content \"x stock market y\"\n\n*sm3, that does not contain \"stock market\"\n\n*destination, a directory where you want to move files containing \"stock market\".\n\n\nLet's find all the files (of type f = file) in the current directory ( . ):\n$ find . -type f\n./a/sm1\n./sm3\n./b/sm2\n\nBut sm3 does not contain \"stock market\", we don't want it. In this list of files that we have now, let's search for \"stock market\", and only display the files that match:\n$ find . -type f | xargs grep --files-with-matches \"stock market\"\n./a/sm1\n./b/sm2\n\nNow let's get each of the files we got, and move them to the destination directory:\n$ for f in $(find . -type f | xargs grep --files-with-matches \"stock market\"); do mv $f destination/; done\n\nMake sure you have a backup before running this, just in case it doesn't move them how you want.\n\nA: I think some plain bash magic might do the trick:\n#!/bin/bash\ndir1=\"\"\ndir2=\"\"\ndir3=\"\"\nshopt -s nullglob\nfor i in *.html)\n    do if [ \"$(grep 'keyword1' $i)\" != \"\" ]; then\n        mv -vf \"$i\" \"$dir1\"\n    elif [ \"$(grep 'keyword2' $i)\" != \"\" ]; then\n        mv -vf \"$i\" \"$dir2\"\n    elif [ \"$(grep 'keyword3' $i)\" != \"\" ]; then\n        mv -vf \"$i\" \"$dir3\"\n    else\n        echo \"$i\">>nomatch\n    fi\ndone\ncat nomatch\n\n\nA: Here are a few ways of doing what you want:\n1. find\nfind . -iname '*html' -type f -exec grep -q election \"{}\" \\; -and -exec mv {} politics/ \\; \n\nExplanation\nHere, we are using find's -exec option:\n-exec command ;\n      Execute  command;  true  if 0 status is returned.  All following\n      arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command until\n      an  argument  consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}'\n      is replaced by the current file name being processed\n\nSo, the first -exec searches the file (here, represented by {}) for election and the second one will preform the move. The -and ensures that the second -exec is only run if the first was successful, if the file matched the pattern.\n2. find & shell.\nThis is the same basic approach as the one in Cos64's answer but with a few improvements.\nfind . -iname '*html' -type f -print0 | \n    while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do \n        grep -q election \"$file\" && mv \"$file\" politics/\n    done\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*The find command will find all files (-type f) whose name ends in .html (or .HTML, the -iname is case insensitive) and print them separated by the NULL character. This is needed because file names in *nix systems can contain any character except / and \\0 (NULL). So, you can have files with spaces, newlines and any other strange character. These need to be treated specially. \n\n*while IFS= read  -r -d '' file; do ... done :  this iterates over the output of find, saving each file as $file. The IFS= sets the input field separator to nothing, which means we can deal with spaces in file names correctly. The -d '' makes it read \\0-separated lines and the -r lets it deal with file names containing \\.\n\n*\n\n*grep -q election \"$file\" : search the file for the pattern. The -q suppresses normal output and makes the grep silent. \n\n*&& echo mv \"$file\" politics/ : the && ensures that this command is only run if the previous one (the grep) was successful. \n\n\n\n3. Bash.\nThis script is very similar to the one in @WilhelmErasmus's very good answer with the difference that i) it can take the set of patterns and replacements from the command line and ii) it also finds files in subdirectories. \n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n## Exit if no arguments were given\n[ -z \"$1\" ] && echo \"At least two arguments are needed.\" >&2 && exit 1\n## Collect the arguments\nargs=(\"$@\")\n## Declare the $dirs associative array\ndeclare -A dirs\n\n## Save the arguments given in the $dirs array.\n## $# is the number of arguments given, so this\n## will iterate over of them, reading two by two.\nfor ((i=0;i<$#;i+=2)); \ndo\n    ## The arguments are pairs of patterns and target directories.\n    ## Set the value of this pattern to the value of the next argument,\n    ## its target directory. \n    dirs[${args[$i]}]=\"${args[i+1]}\"\ndone\n\n## Ignore globs that match no files\nshopt -s nullglob\n## This enables ** to match subdirectories\nshopt -s globstar\n## Find all .html files\nfor file in **/*{html,htm,HTM,HTML}\ndo\n    matched=0;\n    for pat in \"${!dirs[@]}\"\n    do\n        ## Does this file match the pattern?\n        ## The `-q` suppresses grep's output.\n        grep -q \"$pat\" \"$file\" && \n        ## Set matched to 1 if the file matches.\n        matched=1 &&\n        ## If the grep succeeded, move the file\n        ## to the corresponding directory\n        mv \"$file\" \"${dirs[$pat]}\" && \n        ## If the move succeeded, break the loop\n        ## and move to the next pattern.\n        break \n    done\n    ## Report files that didn't match\n    [[ \"$matched\" -eq 0 ]] && printf \"No matches for '%s'\\n\" \"$file\" >&2\ndone\n\nRun the script giving it the names of patterns and their targets.

Ubuntu booted normally with the GUI.\nWithout the xorg-edgers repository the \"additional drivers\" program does not recognized, that the laptop has a GTX 860M card installed. After the installation the \"NVIDIA-Settings\" program showed the correct graphic card, but the \"additional drivers\" program showed only that an Unknown NVIDIA device is present and different NVIDIA drivers 340, 346, 349 and nouveau to choose from.\nThen I tried to install CUDA 7.0 using the .deb package. The installation was not possible, because apt-get  gave me depencies problems as described here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-control-center/+bug/1428972 (comments #9)\nI used sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libcheese7 libcheese-gtk23 libclutter-gst-2.0-0 libcogl15 libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 libclutter-1.0-0 to resolve the depencie problems but since then when I boot I get a black screen as described in the System Specs List. I can access the virtual consoles (tty1- tty6) and the outputs of prime-select query is NVIDIA, nvidia-detector is none.\nI do not understand, why the \"additional drivers\" program does not recognized the graphic card I have Even though I followed the instruction described here: \nHow do I use Nvidia GTX 860M with 14.04?.\nAnd furthermore why I get the unmet dependencies problems. Those problems don't let me install freeglut3-dev. How can I manage to boot normally?\nUpdate 2015-04-15\nHi, I performed a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04.1. The “Additional Drivers” section didn’t recognized my nvidia (GTX 860M) graphics card at all. I added the xorg-edgers and installed the nvidia-356.59 driver and got the black screen problem. I apply the solution proposed here and worked. Then I proceeded to apply all the following Ubuntu updates and updated until 14.04.2. I was happy that everything was running well.\nThen I proceeded to install CUDA 7.0 and now I have the following problem:\nSometimes my laptop hangs on boot: the last line of the booting process before hanging reads:\n‘Starting ACPI daemon [OK]’\nAfter that I only can power off the laptop pressing the power button.\nUsing the nomodeset boot parameter allows me to boot with the nvidia driver selected, without freeze, but I get the login screen and after logging in I only see my desktop background and the mouse pointer. Usint Alt + F2 or Ctrl + Alt + T does nothing (only the tty1-6 work). From there switching to intel drivers using sudo prime-select intel fails.\nWhen the laptop does not hangs I get again a black screen. I can use the others ttys and using prime-select query outputs nvidia. If I wait until the “screen saver” is activated then the X Server works.\nDoes anyone else have the boot problem as described here?\n\nA: I have had the same problem for a long time and I think I have found the solution. I have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, my graphic card is Nvidia GTX 860M. The problem of black screen or freezing on the splash screen is related to nvidia-drivers and openGL libraries that cuda installs alongside. \nSo here what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*First you install the graphic card driver which has 3xx.yy version. For me it was 346.82 (proprietary, tested). Usually, after this step you should not have OS loading problems.\n\n*Next when you take the .deb package which has all dependencies. This dependency is really huge and long, so nobody bothers to look what actually it tries to install. What it does is it installs nvidia drivers again. For me it was the same version 346. Here the subtle difference comes up. It installs 346.00 version and overrides previous installation of the 346.82. Usually, xxx.something means that it was patched several times and bugs were fixed. Cuda installation rolls back to initial 346.00 where a lot of bugs exist.\n\n*Alongside with Nvidia drivers it also installs lib-mesa which overrides the openGL files installed by previous Nvidia driver installation.\n\n\nThis problem is described here: \nhttp://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/7_0/Prod/doc/CUDA_Getting_Started_Linux.pdf \nin the section \"RUNFILE INSTALLATION\" subsection 4.2. Here what it says:\n\"Installing Mesa may overwrite the /usr/lib/libGL.so that was previously\ninstalled by the NVIDIA driver, so a reinstallation of the NVIDIA driver might be\nrequired after installing these libraries.\"\nThis made me dig into that direction and find out the problem causing all this crap with freezing OS. \nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nWhenever you install cuda either by *.deb or *.run files, make sure you apply correct nvidia driver before restarting your PC. After this OS should load properly + you can use nvcc compiler to compile and run cuda programs. (g++ installation may be required separately, depends how you install cuda).\nFor me it worked well.

I use GParted but I am not able to create a new partition. I am attaching a screen shot . \n\nI want to partition the /dev/sda2 drive as only it has considerable space.\n\nA: First of all, /dev/sda2 is not a drive but a partition!\nTo be more exact, it is the main partition of your Ubuntu installation (mount point / = file system root directory).\nIt seems like you want to resize the partition sda2 to get free space for installing Windows. This is not possible from within your running Ubuntu session because ext4 volumes can't be reduced in size while they're mounted. And you can't unmount your main partition. You see that it is mounted because of the key symbol next to the name in the table.\nTherefore you have to boot from a live system (boot from the DVD/USB you used to install Ubuntu and select \"Try Ubuntu\" in the menu) where no disk partition gets mounted. Then you can use GParted and resize the partition. I recommend you to only move the right partition border to avoid getting boot problems.\nI assume you better do not create partitions for Windows but leave the unpartitioned/unallocated space as it is. But this part is not on topic here on AskUbuntu...\n\nA: Please install windows first, then install Ubuntu. What actually happens is when you install windows, NTLDR(Windows boot loader) tries to replace grub(Linux boot loader). And then Ubuntu partition is unable to start.

I went through some answered questions and basically got the idea how to do it from here.\nFirst step is as follows:\n\nFirst, you have to make sure that the 50GB free space is available,\n  resizing your Ubuntu by using GParted if necessary.\n\nBut I can't resize anything:\n\nAnd then:\n\nAlso use gParted or Disk Utility to format the free space as NTFS,\n  this prevents Windows 7 from creating an additional boot partition in\n  addition to the \"C\" drive.\n\nI would gladly do that but I just can't and I'm not quite sure how:\n\nI'm basically stuck here and have no idea what to do, please help.\n\nA: As far as i see, you're using a LVM volume, which is kind of software RAID. For these partitions you cannot use parted. Look into the documentation of LVM at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm on how to resize LVM volumes.\n\nA: You see that little Key symbol on each partition?  That key means the partition is mounted.  I'm telling you this because even if you boot from an external medium such as an ubuntu live boot flashdrive or CD or DVD, you may inadvertently mount a partition and be unable to move or resize it until you unmount such a drive.\nTo unmount a drive you have accidentally mounted, right click on the partition you wish to unmount and click on the menu choice called \"unmount\".\nI would also like to suggest that I am not certain if you can install Windows entirely within the extended partition, SDA2, which it appears you may be trying to do. I mean, you can try resizing SDA5 within SDA2 to make room for another partition there, but I had the impression that bootable partitions had to be primary partitions.  You may need to resized SDA1 instead or in addition.\nOne last comment, and I apologize for straying from the subject.  I would like to add that while I have configured many dual boot installations, I do so while preaching caution.  It appears that MS is increasingly totalitarian and prone to running over linux installations.  I recommend keeping them separate as much as possible.\nOne way you can keep the installations somewhat separate is to remove your linux drive, install windows on another drive, and then connect both drives to the same computer and reinstall grub.  Grub will ask you at boot time which operating system you wish to load.  At one time this could only be done with desktops, but in recent years a couple of laptop manufacturers have made computers with two hard drive bays.  Some even have slots for mSATA solid state drives in addition.\n", "Q: several instances of apache2 I have recently setup xubunutu 14.04 on my computer, today I noticed there are several instances of apache2 running on my computer here is the list\n\nBefore this I only installed owncloud server,\nIs it possible to find out as to why these different instances of apache2 are running by looking some configuration file to identify the package which are making it run ?\nI recently installed owncloud server and this it started happening..\nThanks,\n\nA: Those are instances where your webpage is open some place. I wouldn't worry about it. Every time someone (or something) opens a page on your webserver, that process will start. The process wont tell you who (outside of www-data) is accessing your page. But, your Apache server logs will. when the pages get closed, those processes will clear. \nyou can try this answer for yourself:\ndo:\nps -ef  | grep apache2 | wc -l\n\nthen open a browser and go to your website.\nthen re run \nps -ef  | grep apache2 | wc -l\n\nyou should see the number increase.\nthen close your browser. and run \nps -ef  | grep apache2 | wc -l\n\nthe number will go down again, provided your don't get more traffic in the mean time.\nAt this point, you might be asking yourself, if Apache2 spawns a new process, each time a web page is accessed, wouldn't my system be prone to loading if numerous persons were accessing my page simultaneously? The answer is yes, that does happen, but you need thousands of concurrent connections before it becomes a problem. If you do experience those issues, switch to nginx which handles threads in a way that doesn't create multiple concurrent processes. \nTo have a look at who is accessing your page(s), read logs (access and error) in:\n/var/log/apache2/\n\nA: do this:\n\ndpkg -l | grep apache2\n\nwith this you can read your modules installed.\napache2 by default install the prefork mpm. this is needed because several extensions (mod_php for owncloud) are not thread safe and will go better with this module.

If I use the mint backup tool to backup all my files, will I be able to restore it back to Ubuntu? I know the default backup manager in Ubuntu is deja-dup, will I be required to install the mint-backup in Ubuntu to access the files?\n\nA: Yes, that should be fine. The Mint backup tool is easy enough to install on Ubuntu (and it might be a good idea, it's a useful tool) but it's not needed. It simply copies your files. It doesn't use any kind of proprietary format that would make it hard for you to access them. The choices it provides you with are to either copy the files as they are or to compress them into one of the standard archive formats. This archive is saved in the target directory and you can then copy it on to your new system and extract the files manually. \nSo, yes, you can use Mint's tool for this.You should note, however, that the chances of a problem appearing in Mint and not in Ubuntu are very slim. Not impossible, just unlikely, the two are very, very similar. More likely, your issues are with whatever graphical environment you have chosen to use and not with the underlying system. \n\nA: I'd really suggest doing it the 'old fashioned' way - with a few tweaks. \n\n\n*\n\n*dump a package list\n\n*make copies of /etc/ and /home/ and other important directories\n\n*If you're suspecting that mate config is the issue and want to install mate in ubuntu rename or delete /home/your_username/.mateconf/\n\n*do a fresh install of ubuntu (optionally with a DE of your choice)\n\n*copy over /home/ and /etc/ contents. Replace anything that's already there.

Ubuntu 14.04 desktop, 64-bit\nI came in to work this morning and noticed that the clock on my system was off by approximately 3 minutes, as compared to the clock on my phone. That seems odd, since my system is on 24/7 and should be keeping the time synced with ntp.ubuntu.com, right? And I've never noticed this problem before.\nIn the system configuration, the \"Time & Date\" settings are set to  set the time automatically from the internet.\nSo I started digging...\nFirst I used ntpdate to update the time. This worked, but a few minutes later the time was incorrect again - by approximate -217 seconds.\nNext, I installed ntpd, hoping that continuous updating would solve the problem. I reset the date using ntpdate and started the ntpd service. No luck - a few minutes later, the time was off, again by approximately -217 seconds.\nThe offset of -217 seconds seems pretty consistent - ie. it doesn't appear to drift once it hits that difference. This suggest to me that there's something on my system resetting the time periodically, and because the change is too large, ntpd will not adjust it.\nAfter some more experimenting, I have determined that whatever is resetting my clock is doing it approximately every 5 minutes.

See http://download1.beyondtrust.com/Technical-Support/Downloads/files/pbiso/Manuals/likewise-open-54-guide.html#id2944830 \nI suggest the settings of Likewise make sure that this time difference cannot occur.\nA windows domain member would normally sync with the PDC but it could be possible that your client syncs with an out-of-sync DC.

I presume it would involve some kind of specialized video card to take input from the gaming console and pass it through, but it is possible at all?\n\nA: It is possible but very hard to accomplish, firstly you are able to setup multiple monitors as a single large monitor using Xinerama, now for the hard part, you need a video capture card that is compatible with Linux, Blackmagic cards are the most recognised brand which has support for Linux, however you need to compile the DeckLink SDK and develop a setup that will work for your use case which would likely consume many hours to get working correctly, also for your use case it is recommended to have a capture card with at least 1080p60 so that gameplay will run smoothly which are also hard to come by and generally expensive.\nTo put it simply, It is entirely possible to accomplish what you want to do but it is way more hassle than its worth especially on Linux where capture card support is very bleak.\n", "Q: Possible to have @ in username in Ubuntu 14.04?

I have no experience installing Linux, because the servers I work with are hosted VMs.\nMost of the Ubuntu specific guides I have read are somewhat scattered and hard to understand. I found this article from archlinux which is well written and for me personally easier to follow than the ubuntu articles.\nIt does however leave a few questions and I haven’t yet managed to setup the system.\nHere is my hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Asus Z97-K with i7-4790K\n\n*2x Samsung 850 EVO 120GB SSD\n\n*2x 8GB DDR3-1600\n\n*Geforce GTX 760\n\n\nNow here is what I am trying to setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 or 14.10 with Unity Desktop (I will not install a second OS in this machine)\n\n*Use UEFI because it’s newer and has improvements over MBR\n\n*Use the 2 SSDs in a software RAID0 (striping) to run the OS\n\n*I would like to either encrypt the root partition or at least my home folder\n\n*I know that when one Disk fails the system is gone, but want it anyway :)\n\n\nFrom what I have seen there is not option to setup a software Raid with the Desktop installer.\nSo I could either launch from stick, prepare the software raid and the install the Desktop version.\nOr alternatively boot the server installer, setup the software raid during install and then install unity afterwards.\nIn the main board’s bios I have set CSM to boot UEFI only.\nI have left SecureBoot enabled, because from what I have read it’s ok to do so.\nI have set FastBoot to enabled, because from what I have read it’s ok to do so.\n\nQ1: Are my assumptions correct so far? Is there anything else I need\n  to setup?\n\nEither way, I will have to setup partitions and the raid array in order to install.\nThe archlinux tutorial uses SYSLINUX instead of GRUB and mentions that GRUB requires an additional partition.\nThe way I understand is that I have to create a software raid that looks like this:\nPartitions:\nDisk 1 (sda) \n\n\n*\n\n*1MB for GRUB without filesystem ???\n\n*sda1 1GB for booting\n\n*sda2 12GB for swap\n\n*sda3 107GB for root filesystem\n\n\nPartitions on sdb should be identical to sda.\n\nQ2: I am a bit confused here. Where is the difference between and\n  EFIBoot partition and a partition mounted to /boot? Do i need both or\n  is it either or?\n\nI would then create the Raid arrays:\n/dev/md0 (EFIBoot)\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 + sdb1\n\n*Raid1 (GRUB doesn’t understand raid and will boot either of the two)\n\n*-1GB in total\n\n\n/dev/md1 (swap)\n\n\n*\n\n*sda2 + sda2\n\n*Raid0 (double the speed for swap read/write)\n\n*24gb in total (1.5 * 16GB ram)\n\n\n/dev/md2 (ext4)\n\n\n*\n\n*sda3 + sdb3\n\n*Raid0 (double the speed for os read/write)\n\n\n\nQ3: How do I setup the GRUB partition? Do I have to manually add it or\n  is it the one that gets added by the server installer partitioning?\nQ4: Where to set the installer to install the boot loader? /dev/md0 or\n  is this what the 1MB GRUB partition is for?\nQ5: Do i have to manually set a boot flag.. and how?\nQ6: Am I completely wrong an should stop trying?\n\nI would really appreciate if someone could help me out here, because this is getting a major pain in the a**. \nI am having a brand new system an cannot use it! :-@\nThanks!\nUPDATE 1:\nI have moved the efi boot partition outside the raid array, which solved my booting issues. Now I am getting an error on startup, which according to this seems to bee a bug. After continuing with a keypress everything works just fine. The strange thing is, that my efi boot partition is not in a raid or lvm, so grub should be able to write!?\n\nA: The 1 mb bios_grub partition is for bios booting, not efi.  For EFI, you need one disk to have a 100 mb fat32 partition flagged as bootable and mounted to /boot/efi.  You do not need a /boot partition at all, so you just need two partitions on each disk, combined into two raid arrays, one for / and one for swap.  The server installer should set this all up for you automatically if you choose the guided raid option.\n", "Q: Is MaaS, juju, or the charm responsible for ssh-keygen on nodes? My MaaS system works, enlists, recruits, commissions, issues warrants, does courts martial, deploys and destroys.  juju seems to work fine: bootstraps locally, installs juju-gui, my charms get deployed, units get assigned to services as I would expect, my relations are noted and hooks run and everything displays well in juju-gui.\nThe charms I am using are a matched controller (1) and slave (many) set.  The controller should rsync between itself and each of the slaves.  What happens is that the slaves reject the attempt, complaining that they are unable to open the sseh_host_ed25519_key file.  (tail -f /var/log/auth.log) (I am running script, not charm yet, I rsh'd to the controller as ubuntu, and am running it from there)\nI read that the answer is fairly simple, do ssh-keygen -a on each machine.  First, I run this on the controller and then on the  slave.  I try the rsync, auth.log says connection closed by  [preauth].  I try ssh_copy-id, but it gets \"Permission denied. (Publickey)\", same entry in the auth.log.\nSo, my questions: Where do I put the ssh-keygen to get it to work?  What am I missing in distributing the keys that is hosing me?\n\nA: MAAS will make sure /you/ have access to each node by adding the key that Juju tells it (and that key is only your public-key). Units do not have SSH access to themselves by design (think of the security implications!).\nIf you wanted to make it so that all units or services can access each other you need to have each machines generate an SSH key for the user you wish to interface then send their public ssh-key to each other via the relation. So if this is for a master -> slave setup here is how you would do something like that:\nmaster-charm/metadata.yaml\nname: master-charm\nprovides:\n  master:\n    interface: my-charm-interface\n\nslave-charm/metdata\nname: slave-charm\nrequires:\n  master:\n    interface: my-charm-interface\n\nThen in each charm, you'll need to do something like the following:\n(master|slave)-charm/hooks/master-relation-joined\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ ! -f ~user-you-want-access/.ssh/id_rsa ]; then\n  ssh-keygen -t rsa -N \"\" -f ~user-you-want-access/.ssh/id_rsa\n  chown -R user-you-want-access.user-you-want-access ~user-you-want-access/.ssh\nfi\n\nrelation-set public-key=\"$(cat ~user-you-want-access/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)\"\n\n(master|slave)-charm/hooks/master-relation-changed\n#!/bin/bash\n\nkey=\"$(relation-get public-key)\"\n\nif [ ! -z \"$key\" ] && ! grep -q \"$key\" ~user-you-want-access/.ssh/authorized_keys; then\n  echo \"$key\" >> ~user-you-want-access/.ssh/authorized_keys\n  chown -R user-you-want-access.user-you-want-access ~user-you-want-access/.ssh\nfi\n\nThese are just meant to stub out how you would model something like this. You could do the same thing for access between nodes themselves using the peer relations.\n\nA: In answer to your general question, the cloud-init package is responsible for generating host keys during first boot on cloud images.\nIn your more specific case, I don't think it currently generates ed25519 keys, but this hasn't been known to cause any issues for any users.

After looking through the file the only suspicious thing I can find is in line 4:  \narchey  \n\nI've never heard of an application named archey but it is the only thing that stands out, the rest of the file looks quite stock.

I didn't see any errors populate, but I notice that forked-daapd isn't running as a service. I tried starting the service like this:\nservice forked-daapd start\n\nand\nsudo /etc/init.d/forked-daapd start\n\nWith no results.\nThe repository is cloned to /home/ericstout/forked-daapd/ so I also tried (this is probably very wrong):\nsudo /home/ericstout/forked-daapd/fork-daapd start\n\nI noticed that in /home/ericstout/forked-daapd/src/ there is an application forked-daapd, I tried double clicking it to start (nothing happens) and also tried:\nsudo /home/ericstout/forked-daapd/src/fork-daapd start\n\nWith no avail. How do I get the service to actually run? Any help would be greatly appreciated. \nI am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I had a version of forked-daapd running earlier, and it was working aside from not actually allowing me to play music from my remote machines in iTunes (12.1) and found a fix was pushed to the GIT Hub Repository, thus why I purged and started over.\nHope I gave you as much info as you need, let me know if you need more. Thanks!\n\nA: So there were a few things that needed to be done for this to work correctly. \nFirst was running forked-daapd which was achieved by this:\nsudo forked-daapd\n\nThis seemed to work, but when checking the running processes, forked dapped was not there, so I checked the log file and saw that there was an error initializing the database, and it was a permissions issue. For now, I set the access to root and the username in the forked-daapd config file to root as well and boom! We have a media server.\nSince this is internal only we can get by with root for now, but its a good idea to create a new user to access it. \nHope this helps anyone that might have gotten stuck in the same spot as me. \n", "Q: Need Help Updating NVIDIA Drivers I'm fairly new to Ubuntu, and I'm trying to get it working on a computer of mine. It's an older PC that I've had windows 7 on. Currently, when I boot to the desktop, within a few moments, the screen shows nothing but small horizontal bars everywhere. Using graphic failsafe mode is the only way I can do anything within it at the moment.

You may find suggestions on fixing installation problems in the README available on  the Linux driver download page at www.nvidia.com.\n\n\nA: I would put this as a comment but my rep isn't high enough at the moment so I will post this as an answer/workaround that may help...\nEDIT: first purge any nvidia drivers that may have been attempted by running the following command before trying the below workaround:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*\n\nRather than attempting to install from the .run file what you can do is go into command line and type the following. Keep in mind that it may get you a lower version of the nvidia driver but it will still install a proprietary nvidia driver regardless.\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nI had a major problem with the .run file at first myself when I came back to Ubuntu after so many years away from it (tried different distros in the meantime) and that appeared to work quite well for me. Good luck, and please report back with results.\n\nA: IF you are still interested in installing the driver you got from the site you may be able to do it using sh  . this process is somewhat error susceptible so do it carefully. Check this for guidance.\nIn short, what you need to do is:\n\n*\n\n*Give your nvidia-file permission to run. Assuming it is NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.59.run:\nchmod 777 NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.59.run\n\n*Now you'll need to go tty1, for example, just press CTRL+ALT+F1\n\n*Navigate to the folder where the file is and run it as sudo:\nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.59\nFrom now on you need to be careful and follow every instruction. Since you seam to have only one graphic card you can let the installer automaticly configure your xorg file.\n\nBUT AS I SAID check the link i mentioned earlier for help.\nNow about keeping it updated... Since NVidia does not supply any ppa or other system to update drivers I THINK you will need to go check it for yourself but go here and try to find some info about your driver.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Enable Edge Scrolling - Ubuntu 14 I am running Ubuntu 14, and in my mouse and touchpad options, there is no setting for edge scrolling. There are only settings for \"double click\" and \"mouse speed,\" nothing for scrolling. \nI found a forum answer to install \"Unity Tweak Tool\" for more options. I installed it and switched my scroll options in the Tweak Tool to \"enable edge scrolling\", but it still isn't working. \nIs it maybe that my computer's trackpad simply doesn't support that feature? \nI am running Ubuntu 14 through VMware, with Windows 8 as the host computer, on an Acer Aspire E5. 2-finger scroll works in both Windows and the Linux VM, but I just like edge scrolling much better and was hoping for a way. \nThanks!\n\nA: Very simple solution to that --- \nthe edge scrolling function is not the 'default' function in ubuntu 14.04\nGo to settings, then click on 'mouse and touchpad' then just uncheck the 'two finger scrolling' option. \nThere you go, no restart, no hassle \n\nA: just paste this in your terminal and both scrolls would start working\nsynclient VertEdgeScroll=1\nsynclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1\n\n\nA: You can't have both two-finger and edge scrollings (simultaneously) enabled.

When I started with an Ubuntu home server, fail2ban was a lifesaver - alerting me to multiple attempts at  unauthorized SSH access to my server. Recently, after moving to a way off port, the only thing fail2ban bans is me. Specifically, whenever I use FileZilla for SFTP to try to download multiple items off my home server, I get banned right away, even though I correctly entered my password.\nIt looks like I'm not the only one who has been affected by this issue: http://sourceforge.net/p/fail2ban/mailman/message/32194650/ - but this thread ends with no solution, and I'm not sure how fail2ban-regex will help anything.\nIs there a way to permanently whitelist a certain local IP address as a fail2ban exception? Or, better yet, get fail2ban to stop banning legitimate use that was properly authenticated? (Or is this a bug with f2b or filezilla?)\nMy home server runs Ubuntu 12.04, with fail2ban 0.8.6-3wheezy3build0.12.04.1\nMy clients run a variety of operating systems, but the one that's been getting banned most often recently is running FileZilla 3.10.3 on Windows, but this has also affected other clients.\n\nA: I don't have a solution for your particular problem but to answer one of your questions: yes, you can permanently whitelist an IP address. Open your /etc/fail2ban/jail.local (if you don't have it, I suggest you create it by copying /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf - it's better than modifying jail.conf directly; restart fail2ban afterwards) and search for ignoreip. This option takes space separated list of IP addresses:\n# \"ignoreip\" can be an IP address, a CIDR mask or a DNS host. Fail2ban will not\n# ban a host which matches an address in this list. Several addresses can be\n# defined using space separator.\nignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8\n\n", "Q: Need System Settings Icon back on Launcher So plain and simple. I've never uses Ubuntu in my life.

We've had Ubuntu on my wife's computer at home for several years now and as far as I am aware, she has always had to use her password to login.\nHowever, a couple of days ago, she pointed out to me that after booting up her computer, she can log in simply by pressing the < enter > key at the password prompt.  I checked and she is right.  Interestingly, if you lock the screen, you are then forced to enter a password, you can't bypass it by pressing \nThis seems like a major security flaw but Googling doesn't turn up anything relevant - maybe I'm using the wrong search terms.\nPerhaps also we have inadvertently changed a configuration somewhere without appreciating the consequences.  However, after hunting around the Unity security settings and Googling, I can't find any way of configuring Unity to prompt for a password but allow the user to bypass it.\nOh, and for the record, yes my wife's login does have a password set and on the User Accounts GUI, \"Automatic login\" is OFF.\nSo this leads to two supplementary questions:\n - how do I configure her computer to require a password at the Unity login prompt?\n - If I can't, is this a security flaw that requires a bug report?\n\nA: Try changing password or turning on/off Automatic Login. If it wouldn't work I think you need to report a bug.\n\nA: It doesn't do anything that you wouldn't be able to do by booting up with a live USB drive.  In other words, it gets you into the file system, which you can anyway do in a number of ways.  If you wanted to improve security, you'd need to encrypt the harddrive, which is an option.\nThere sometimes are ways to lock down the boot in the bios, but I wouldn't recommend them, and anyway, you can still generally just take the harddrive out...\nHang on.

It's easy enough to resize/maximize them - but I would like to know what controls their placement and sizing, and then be able to fix it? I've tried using compiz to maximize the window on launch but it doesn't work (compiz works fine for selecting which workspace to place it on, just not resizing). I expect there must be a setting somewhere that dictates this - any ideas?  \n\n\nA: Just to see what happened, I created some webapp- launchers. What you describe occurred to me as well, but in an unpredictable way; sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.\nOpening a webapp window with a pre defined size\nTo guarantee that a newly created window of a certain application has a certain size, turned out to be a bit more complicated than I anticipated. I think however that the solution below works elegantly.\nWhat it does and how to use\nThe solution below redirects the command to run the webapp to a script. The scripts runs the command, waits for the corresponding window to appear (waiting for the pid of chrome to produce a new window) and resizes it to the size that you define.\nIn practice:\nLooking inside the webapp's .desktop file, you see in the Exec= line (as you mentioned) a command, looking like:\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --app=feedly.com/i/my\n\nAfter you made the setup below, all you need to do is to replace the command in this (or any other webapps-) file to:\nExec=run_maximized \"/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --app=feedly.com/i/my\" 100 100\n\nThe last to figures in the command are the horizontal/vertical sizes of the window (in %, related to the screen size)\nThe setup\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses both wmctrl and xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as run_maximized (no extension) in ~/bin. Create the directory if it does not exist. Make the script executable.\n\n*If you just created the directory ~/bin, either log out/in or run\nsource ~/.profile\n\n\n*In the webapp's .desktop file, replace the command in the Exec= line:\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --app=feedly.com/i/my\n\nto:\nExec=run_maximized \"/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --app=feedly.com/i/my\" 100 100\n\nMind the quotes, and don't forget the horizontal/vertical size of the window\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport getpass\nimport time\nimport sys\n\nuser = getpass.getuser()\nget = lambda x: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", x]).decode(\"utf-8\")\nws1 = get(\"wmctrl -lp\"); t = 0\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", sys.argv[1]])\n\nwhile t < 30:      \n    ws2 = [w.split()[0:3] for w in get(\"wmctrl -lp\").splitlines() if not w in ws1]\n    procs = [[(p, w[0]) for p in get(\"ps -u \"+user).splitlines() \\\n              if \"chrome\" in p and w[2] in p] for w in ws2]\n    if len(procs) > 0:\n        command = \"xdotool windowsize \"+procs[0][0][1]+\" \"+sys.argv[2]+\"% \"+sys.argv[3]+\"%\"\n        subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n        break\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    t = t+1\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*I used xdotool to resize the window. It could also be done with wmctrl, but the maximize command of wmctrl has some side effects that xdotool does not have. \n\n*With a minor change of the script, it can be made usable to run windows of a predefined size (or position) of any application. Could be usefull in quicklists for example, to create multiple windows in a predefined layout.\n\n", "Q: Writing a simple Gedit plug-in I love Gedit and use it daily, but there's one simple thing that would make my work so much simpler. And that is being able to use the arrow keys to open and close directories in the File Browser in the Side Panel instead of having to try and hit that tiny little arrow with my wonky mousepad every time.\nI can't imagine this being especially difficult to add, but I'm a web developer with zero knowledge of Linux development so I don't even know where to start.\nSo I was hoping you guys could point me in the right direction. Perhaps a simple XML file with keyboard shortcuts is all I need to edit? Or maybe a plug-in already exists? Let me know.\n\nA: What version of gedit are you using? In mine, you can use the arrow keys to browse the filesystem. Press TAB or Shift-TAB to move the highlight to the area that contains folders and files and then up and down arrows. Press space to go into a directory. Use shift-TAB (just because its faster, you can use TAB if you prefer) to highlight the area at the top-left that shows the current directory,  and press space again to go to the directory you selected.\nHope This helps\n", "Q: custom-keybindings not found When I tried to list the available custom keybindings using gsettings command\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys custom-keybindings\n\nI got the error message saying, \nNo such key 'custom-keybindings'\n\nI graphically checked my custom keyboard shortcuts and it was empty.

You can choose which hard drive to boot from in the bios settings.\n\nA: It will actually, Because I have Windows 10 Build 9926 and my trusty Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS.

Any help?\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot a live system (for example boot from a usb stick).\n\n*Resize sda2 all the way to the right.\n\n*Move sda5 all the way to the right inside sda2.\n\n*Resize sda2 from the left to the right.\n\n*Resize sda1 all the way to the beginning of sda2.\n\n\nApply after each single step in this case. Changing size on the right hand side will go fast, changing size on the left hand side will take way more time.\n\nMake sure to have a backup. If you don't have one, the closest point in time is always the best point in time to make one. Especially when changing partitions.\nYou can make one within the live sessions or you can use the opportunity of being in a live session to copy your entire HDD to an external HDD. Do the latter one only if you have a lot of storage space on your external HDD. You can use this command:\ndd if=/dev/sda bs=8M | gzip -9 > /yourExternalHddMountPoint/folder/image.gz\n\n9 is the best compression. A lower number will make the process faster but will take more storage space on your external HDD.\nIf you choose to copy your HDD rather than backing up you files, you can always take the entire HDD back to the previous state with this command (in a live session, of course):\ncat /yourExternalHddMountPoint/folder/image.gz | gunzip -d -c | dd of=/dev/sda bs=8M\n\n\nA: Updated answer.  Since I wrote the following I've noticed that according to the screenshot, your swapspace is not in use.  If it were in use it would show as mounted.  Since it is not being used (cannot be benefited from) you may as well first delete the swapspace (sda5) and then the extended partition.  This will free up still more space and make the task of expanding the primary partition much easier.\n--- original answer ---\nGenerally speaking you cannot resize the partition you are booted from for the simple reason that before you can resize or move a partition, you must unmount it, and if you could unmount it, your system would stop working.\nFirst backup your data if you have a brain.  I've read too many sob stories here not to recommend this first.\nBoot to external media such as a portable external hard drive to which Ubuntu is installed, rather like the Mubuntsticks self-booting flash drives (pen drives) I keep promoting as a solution.  Alternatively you can use a bootable ubuntu live CD/DVD or Ubuntu installation boot flash drive of you have one.\nNow, provided you are ready, moving the second partition to the right involves selecting that partition, right clicking, select resize move, and make sure the space after it is ZERO.  After you do that, you should be able to resize the primary partition, provided it is not mounted.\n", "Q: How can I type special characters? I want to type special characters such as □ and ■.

Is there another log somewhere that I can reference?\nHere is an example of a .conf file for one of the malfunctioning sites:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n   ServerName www.local_example.com\n   ServerAlias local_example.com\n   ServerAdmin address@example.com\n\n   DocumentRoot /var/www/Websites/example.com\n   <Directory /var/www/Websites/example.com/>\n       Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n       # pcw AllowOverride None\n       AllowOverride All\n       Order allow,deny\n       allow from all\n       # This directive allows us to have apache2's default start page\n       # in /apache2-default/, but still have / go to the right place\n       # Commented out for Ubuntu\n       #RedirectMatch ^/$ /apache2-default/\n   </Directory>\n\n   ErrorLog /home/example/Apache_Logs/local_example.com_error.log\n\n   # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,\n   # alert, emerg.\n   LogLevel warn\n\n   CustomLog /home/example/Apache_Logs/local_example.com_access.log combined\n   ServerSignature On\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\nA: Try the following\nEnable verbose logs\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nLocate the LogLevel variable, and update it from the default warn to info or debug. debug will produce the greatest amount of output.\n# LogLevel: Control the number of messages logged to the error_log.\n# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,\n# alert, emerg.\n# \nLogLevel debug\n\nRestart Apache\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nApache includes a nice little syntax checking tool\napache2ctl -t\n\nChecking Virtual Host Definitions\napache2ctl -S\n\n\nA: after installation index.html has higher priority that's why you still seeing default Ubuntu page\ncheck this folder var/www/html/\nrename or remove this page\nsimple as that\n\nA: Turns out the problem was permissions.\nWhen you're storing the web site in a directory outside of /var/www and connected by symlink, then the source directory, and its parent directory have to have permissions of 755.\nFor some unknown reason, the two misbehaving sites had different permissions, and running chmod -R 755 on the web site directory, and its parent directory, solved the problem.\n\nA: I battled with the same issue.\nI even deleted /var/www/html, did sudo a2dissite 000-default and deleted /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf and even then, the issue persisted.\nIn the end I figured out that the index.html was persisted due to some hardcoding in the c++ code.\nThe built in default DirectoryIndex is in /mods-available/dir.conf and goes like this:\nDirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm\nMy project had no index.html just an index.php\nThe solution was to add a DirectoryIndex to my vhost .conf in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ like this:\n<Directory \"/var/www/mysite\">\n   RewriteEngine On\n   AllowOverride All\n   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n   Require all granted\n        \n   #extra config to disable default index.html\n   DirectoryIndex disabled\n   DirectoryIndex index.php\n</Directory>\n\nThis solved the issue completely for me.\n\nA: For me, one of the suggestions from @Dan solved it.\nsudo a2dissite 000-default.conf\nservice apache2 reload\n\nApparently the default site configuration was overriding my vhost configuration.\n", "Q: can't connected LAN with static gateway router I try to connect LAN with my college network with static gateway router.

It's the QCSERIAL.C  module which need to be patched. You can find the pre patched files here: http://thuis.schroth.nl:8008/qcserial/\nMake sure you download first the kernel headers.\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\n*sudo rmmod qcserial\n\n*Download the 3 files from my given link above and place them in a separate directory, e.g. /tmp/compile\n\n*cd /tmp/compile\n\n*make\n\n*if no errors occured, run sudo make install\n\n*sudo modprobe qcserial\nNow you will find the card in network manager and you can use it.\nRemember to redo this every time when you do a kernel update, until the Ubuntu guys patched this bug.\n-==-= update in relation to what is changed\nCan you please past the output of the syslog after you have reloaded the qcserial module... the problem is that qcserial gives you one device. /dev/ttyUSB2 and it need to have the /dev/ttyUSB3 as well. ttyUSB3 is the device where the network manager talks to...\ni have grabbed the code from : http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/usb/serial/qcserial.c and i have removed and added :\nThis code was\ncase 0:\ncase 2:\n  dev_dbg(dev, \"Modem port found\\n\");\n  break;\ncase 1:\n  dev_dbg(dev, \"DM/DIAG interface found\\n\");\n  break;\ncase 5:\n  dev_dbg(dev, \"NMEA GPS interface found\\n\");\n  break;\ndefault:\n/* don't claim any unsupported interface */\naltsetting = -1;\nbreak;\n\nreplaced by this\ncase 0:\n  dev_dbg(dev, \"Modem port found\\n\");\n  break;\ncase 1:\n  dev_dbg(dev, \"DM/DIAG interface found\\n\");\n  break;\ncase 2:\n  dev_dbg(dev, \"Modem port found\\n\");\n  break;\ncase 3:\n  dev_dbg(dev, \"PCSC interface found\\n\");\n  break;\ncase 5:\n  dev_dbg(dev, \"NMEA GPS interface found\\n\");\n  break;\n         \n\nThis does the job with the given script.\n\nA: \nsudo modprobe qcserial vendor=0x03f0 product=0x581d\n\nThis is always wrong, even when it happens to work!  But you log shows that the qcserial driver binds successfully, so it is not a problem here.\n\nifconfig\n  usb0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:1e:10:1f:00:00  \n\nThe \"usb0\" interface name is unexpected if the driver is qmi_wwan, so I think this device is handled by the cdc_ether driver here.  Is that correct?  The modem probably have several different modes, where one use cdc_ether while another use qmi_wwan.  Could you provide the output of\nlsusb -vd 03f0:581d\n\nThis will show all available configurations for that device ID. I'm guessing that you want a non-default configuration for qmi_wwan support.\n(It is possible to use the modem with cdc_ether as well.  You'll then use AT commands to manage it instead of QMI.  But ModemManager probably doesn't support that by default for this modem, because QMI usually is far superior.  And more \"standard\", being similar among Qualcomm based modems from many different vendors)\n\nA: I got it working on Ubuntu 14.04.2 and 15.04. Hopefully this will help someone figure out what the actual problem is, and fix it.\nRemember to insert SIM card, otherwise the device won't appear in NetworkManager. In 15.04 it is shown as \"not enabled\".\n# lsusb -v -d 03f0:581d | egrep 'i(Product|Manufacturer)'\n  iManufacturer           2 Hewlett-Packard\n  iProduct                3 HP lt4112 Gobi 4G Module\n# echo '03f0 581d' > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/generic/new_id\n# service modemmanager restart\n\nAfter 10 seconds or so, the PIN query window pops up.\n", "Q: Set DNS settings Ubuntu Touch Is there a way to change the DNS settings in Ubuntu Touch?\nIf it's possible, is it possible to use other DNS settings when connected via 3G than the settings used when connected via WIFI?\nI cannot find anything in the system settings.\n\nA: Yes, you can add your DNS to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d, editing \"head\" file or adding \"tail\" file with your dns.\nTo do this you need write permissions to /. You can use sudo mount -o remount,rw /.\nYou can use terminal emulator (download from store) or ssh access to do this.\n", "Q: How to hide administrator account or root in Login screen? I used Ubuntu 12.04 and I want to only user account appear on the Login screen without guest and administrator account. My administrator account cannot view to everybody when their Login.\n\"greeter-hide-user=true\" this command all account disappear.

It is asking me to create a separate partition for boot loader code. It is also asking me to go back to the partition menu and correct the error and that if I do not correct this error, boot loader installation will fail later. I already have a partition labelled: /dev/sda2 fat32 /boot/efi which is 104MB in size and 33MB has been used out of it. It labelled that as \"Windows Boot Manager\". Do I need to delete the OS Partition labelled Ubuntu 14.10 (14.10)? How do I complete the installation?|\n\nA: You need to correctly identify your EFI System Partition (ESP) and flag it as such in the installer. You do this in the dialog that asks for the filesystem type, IIRC. At one time, the Ubuntu installer called the ESP the \"EFI boot partition,\" but I believe that name has been changed to \"EFI System Partition\" in the latest (development?) versions of the Ubuntu installer. Note that when you flag the partition in this way, you don't need to explicitly set the mount point to /boot/efi; the installer does that automatically.\nIt sounds like /dev/sda2 is your ESP, and you've simply set it as a normal FAT partition mounted to /boot/efi rather than setting it as an ESP.\n\nA: First of all check the partitions in your windows 8.1. There should be unallocated space there available to install Ubuntu Linux. All the empty logical partitions won't be recognise by Ubuntu as  free spaces. There is a primary partitions available to make it as Unallocated space.\nLet me know how many logical partitions and primary partitions available in your Laptop?\n", "Q: .sh ffmpeg works manually, not with CRON I make a movie from jpeg pictures with the script:\n#create movie\nffmpeg -i /home/philippe/Dropbox/Public/Cheiron/day/%d.jpg  -r 25 -q:a 5 -pix_fmt yuv420p /home/philippe/Dropbox/Public/Cheiron/day/movie.mp4\n\nIt works fine from terminal, but not from cron (using scheduled tasks).\nWhat is weird is that a similar script NOT using ffmpeg but avconv, works fine both manually and with cron:\n#create movie\navconv -f image2 -i /home/philippe/Dropbox/Public/Cheiron/day/%d.jpg -r 25 -c:v libx264 -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p /home/philippe/Dropbox/Public/Cheiron/day/movie.mpeg\n\nWhat's wrong with my ffmpeg script through cron?\n\nA: It should work if you supply the full path for the ffmpeg and avconv commands.

Stored in: /var/run/nginx.pid\n\n*A command to send a SIGHUP (1) to the process with that PID:\nkill -1 $(cat /var/run/nginx.pid)\n\n\n*A way for node.js to send the kill. I'd go with a child process.\nI'm not a Node developer. I have no way to put these together into something that makes sense, but that's what you'd do if you knew what you were doing.\nOh and your nginx server and Node.JS app need to be running as the same user to allow Node to send the signal. This is fairly easily done but may have security ramifications. You may instead want to make a SUID script for Node to call but if done carelessly, these can also have security ramifications.\n\nAlternatively, you could use the process module to run process.kill(...). You'll still need to read in the PID for nginx and the permissions still need to be sorted.\nSomething like this (again, I'm still not a Node dev, so this might be syntactically incorrect):\nvar fs = require('fs'),\n    process = require('process');\n\nprocess.kill(fs.readFileSync('/var/run/nginx.pid', \"utf8\"), 'SIGHUP');\n\n\nA: *\n\n*create a file inside /etc/sudoers.d/. Call it reload-nginx\n\n\n*Put the following with the following lines inside reload-nginx. %dev is user group of multiple users who can want to reload nginx. You can also restrict this privilege to a single user\n%dev ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl reload nginx.service\n%dev ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl reload nginx\n\nOnce this is done, anyone belonging to the %dev group will be able to reload nginx without entering their password. You can immediately test this from the command line.\nAdd entries for the user under which nodejs will run and then use nodejs' child_process module to invoke unix shell commands like sudo systemctl reload nginx.

How you did it, I don't know, but I can give you directions how to fix it.\nGet an Ubuntu live CD an chroot into your system. \nAnd yes, I strongly suggest you check, how to boot another device, like the DVD-rom.\nIn most BIOSes you press something like F5 or F8, or ESC, ENTER.\nChroot means, you mount your hdd partitions to the loaded live cd session using your own folder e.g. like /mnttmp.\nYou can do this like this...\nOpen up a Terminal and become root\nsudo -i\n\nCreate a mountpoint\nmkdir /mnttmp\n\nMount your hdd root fs to the new mount point\nmount -t <fstype> /dev/<root partition> /mnttmp\n\nIf you have other partitions then that, mount those too AFTER you mounted the root partition, like so\nmkdir /mnttmp/<home or else partition>\nmount -t <fstype> /dev/<home or else partition> /mnttmp/<home or else mount point>\n\nOnce your finished you need to mount /proc /sys /dev to chroot\nmount -o bind /proc /mnttmp/proc\nmount -o bind /dev /mnttmp/dev\nmount -o bind /dev/pts /mnttmp/pts\nmount -o bind /sys /mnttmp/sys\n\nThen chroot in your old Ubuntu-System\nchroot /mnttmp\n\nWith this you can regain access to your running system. From here you can try to fix your grub mistake, or just reinstall grub from the system. \nThis should bring back Ubuntu as a loadable option in your grub.\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\nAnd from there you can ask your next question...

Lately it seems to occur every 12 hours or so. \nHere's the sequence: A password prompt appears for user, using my gmail address. The 1st dialogue box input is never accepted, regardless of what is entered. The subsequent 2nd one accepts anything it seems, and disappears silently. The cycle is repeated every n hours.I assume this is from the Online Accounts app? I use my email address for several accounts, so have no idea which account this is coming from.\nPresently using Gnome-Shell 3.14 on Ubuntu Vivid Vervet, but as I've said have seen this on Debian installs, and on other machines running Gnome-Shell various versions.\nAny suggestions? I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this in order to do a bug report.\n\nA: NEVER use the same username/email - password combination for more than one service! \nI advise you to change all of them immediately. Not only because it is unsafe in general, but because weird popup password requests look somehow suspicious to me.\nIt could be malware prompting you for your credentials to hack your accounts. It does not have to be, but it can be. Find out where it comes from and why!\nAnd in general:\nIf you don't have a good reason for entering a password anywhere (because you yourself manually requested a service that needs it), don't enter it!\n\nA: Not positive, but seems to be the same as:\nI bug goo.gl/XTAkQG this too, goo.gl/Kds4va –  Stephen Allen Apr 3 at 11:45    \nAnd another one which shows the dialogue asking for prompt: goo.gl/13LIMH So it seems to be a regression in both Debian and Ubuntu. :( –  Stephen Allen Apr 3 at 11:56   \n", "Q: Unnoticingly I deleted a directory.

Please do help me.\n\nA: You CAN'T unmount the root partition, while it's in use, that's impossible.\nThe only way to give it a try is to boot the LIVE-CD and try to fix it from there.\nIt would be best, if you don't use the system any longer, because the blocks are set to \"unused\" by the system. The longer you use this system, the bigger the chances are, that you override your data with other stuff.\nGet out of the system now, boot a live cd, open up the link and follw the instructions.\nI wish you all the luck in the world, you'll need it.\nBetter backup your data in the future ;-)\n\nA: It is good advice to shutdown, and boot into a live media as soon as possible. \nif you simply used rm -rf on a directory, then the file data is likely still intact, just the pointer to that location has been removed, or marked with a delete flag. The resource doesn't actually get over wrote until the OS needs to write files to disk, which things with a deleted flag or empty space get wrote to first. When I took Linux+ certification they discussed that there is some sort of algorithm, like use empty space first, then prioritize for contiguous space, and overwrite if there are deleted files in the way. \nI've used a similar method outlined in this article, with success, so you should try it. \nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-ext3-ext4-deleted-files-recovery-howto.html\n\nA: I got this using \"foremost\"\nsudo foremost -t filetype -o ~/out -i /dev/sdaX    \n\nHere out is the directory where your recovered files will get stored and make sure it is just created, i.e., it should be empty. Filetype can be any file format and X is the drive where you deleted it.\nFor example to recover pdf files on sda1\nsudo foremost -t pdf -o ~/out -i /dev/sda1\n\n", "Q: Use Terminal after opening process I am new to Linux and using Terminal.

Is there a way to bypass this or do I just have to wait until I end my session with the process. \n\nA: Use disown command:\ngedit & disown\n\nThis way launched process is disconnected from the terminal it was launched in.\n\nA: There are a number of ways that you can continue working. \nIf you opened a gnome-terminal via CTRL-ALT-T you can choose File from the top menu bar and then choose to open a new tab or a new terminal window via the menu or with the shortcut keys with SHIFT-CTRL-T or SHIFT-CTRL-N respectively(while gnome-terminal has focus). \nIf you've opened a terminal session with CTRL-ALT-F1, you can switch to another with CTRL-ALT-F2 through F6. \nAnother option is to background the task as you launch it by placing an & at the end of the command for example dd if=infile of=outfile &. you can string commands by putting a double ampersand between them. ls /home > dir.file && du /home/Downloads for example.\nOf course placing processes in the background requires a way of handling background tasks. the fg PID command allows you to bring a process to the foreground. you can obtain the PID with the jobs command more information on handling background tasks can be found here\nyou can also use nohup and disown as mentioned in the other good answers here.

Also, you might not be able to easily recover some types of boot entries, such as those for PXE-booting or booting legacy OSes, since efibootmgr doesn't give you a way to create such entries.\nTo add an entry with efibootmgr, you use a command something like this:\nefibootmgr -c -d /dev/sdb -p 2 -l \\\\EFI\\\\newloader\\\\loadername.efi -L NewLoader\n\nThe options shown here are:\n\n\n*\n\n*-c -- Creates a new entry.\n\n*-d /dev/sdb -- The entry refers to a file on /dev/sdb. (/dev/sda is the default.)\n\n*-p 2 -- The file is on partition 2. (1 is the default.)\n\n*-l \\\\EFI\\\\newloader\\\\loadername.efi -- This is the path to the loader file on the ESP (not in Linux). Note the doubled-up backslashes (\\\\) as path separators. Alternatively, you can use single backslashes if the entire path is enclosed in quotes. Some new versions of efibootmgr can use Unix-style forward slashes instead, but I'm not sure offhand whether these new versions are included in any Ubuntu version.\n\n*-L NewLoader -- This is the name of the loader, as displayed in your firmware's boot manager menu.\n\n\nYou can get the last two items from the efibootmgr -v output. The first two items are encoded as device paths and long GUIDs, so it's easier to figure them out by locating your ESP based on its current mount entry in /etc/fstab or by searching for FAT partitions with parted or blkid.\n", "Q: No mail-notifications on Ubuntu Phone (bq Aquaris E4.5)?

I deleted 100gb of files off my desktop the other day and it still seems to be taking up HDD space.\n\nA: By default it doesn't. You can empty it manually by right-clicking on the trash icon in the launcher and then clicking \"Empty Trash ...\".\nIf you want it to do this automatically, open a terminal and enter this command:\nsudo apt-get install trash-cli\n\nThen open \"Startup Applications\" from the dash. Click \"Add\" and enter trash-empty 5 as command, choose some name you like. This will delete all files which are longer than 5 days in your trash every time you log in to your computer.\n\nA: \nI deleted 100gb of files off my desktop the other day and it still seems to be taking up HDD space.\n\nNothing to add to what has been said already, but this is expected because files moved to the trash are not deleted, but just moved to ~/.local/share/Trash. Only by emptying the trash you'll regain your free space\n\nA: No, it does not. The Trash is just a regular folder on your drive (/home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/share/Trash/). \"Deleted\" files are instead of really deleting just moved to its subfolder files/ and another file in the subfolder info/ is created to provide additional information about it (date of deletion, origin,...). Therefore a trashed file still occupies space on the disk.\nThe Trash (of which each user account has its own) usually never gets emptied automatically. At least not depending on the time, maybe if it grows too large, but I don't think so. You have to do it manually (right-clicking on its Unity launcher icon or inside your file manager, e.g. Nautilus) or schedule a job to perform it automatically, but I would recommend you to take the old-school way and do it by hand. :)\n", "Q: Grub2 rescue with Win7 & Ubuntu I installed the Ubuntu 14.04 and a Windows 7 in the same HD.

I have both a 64 bit Intel desktop and a 64bit AMD laptop. I installed the 32 bit on the laptop by accident, having made the install \"pen\" a while back for a 32 bit laptop and it worked fine. Then I installed the 64 bit version on top of that, again no problem.\nBut I rely more on my desktop (more powerful, for one thing) and it's running the aforementioned Intel, an i5 quadcore sandybridge 3.3Ghz to be exact.\nSo again, does it matter? Were the 32 and 64 written for different architectures? \nThank you.\n\nA: If your computer supports 64 bit (which it probably does if it's not older than 10 years), install the 64 bit version. Don't get distracted by \"amd\" or \"i386\".\n\nA: 64 bit architecture was initially developed by AMD, which was then picked up by Intel. Hence, traditionally, 64 bit architecture is also referred to as amd64. It's merely a naming convention, you can install the amd64 iso on Intel's 64 bit-capable CPU as well. \nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64\n", "Q: network icon disappeared in gnome-panel Today I dragged a photo to the gnome-panel.Then the panel background changed,but after a reboot i got an error saying \"reload gnome-panel\".

Rebooting or waiting doesn't help. I think it shouldn't take several days to scan it. Actually the music do appear in the player, but media-scanner-service never stops. If I remove the card media-scanner-service goes away. This might be a reason for relatively poor battery life. Does anyone have this same problem?\n\nA: It's known, yet unresolved but with a possible, temporary workaround: place a file called .nomedia in the root directory of the SD card once all the media is scanned and remove it when you need to add some media. Place it back when all the media is found again. I can't, however, verify if this works, since I haven't used a SD card with a lot of media yet and therefore don't have the issue.

What I do:\nI record and mix audio using Ardour or Harrison Mixbus. Most of the time now, I don't need to create an master audio cd: bands ans artists are happy enough with audio files. Providing them with high quality .wav files, and some mp3 or .aac is enough nowadays.\nHowever, for a new project, I will have to do again a master audio cd. It is used as a reference to press audio cd.\nThe issue:\nIn the past, with Ubuntu or Ubuntu Studio, I used gCDmaster, a GUI for cdrdao. It is not available anymore in repositories, for a long time.\nWith Ardour or Mixbus, I can export one long .wav file and the .toc description file.\nSo I am looking for a burning software that:\n\n\n*\n\n*can import one long .wav file, or many short .wav files\n\n*can import .toc or .cue files for tracks information\n\n*can edit and save tracks informations (e.g: cd text)\n\n*can burn the cd at lowest speed possible for the burner (less errors possible)\n\n\nAny idea ?\n(Brasero and k3b can not do that)\n\nA: You can keep on using cdrdao, without a GUI, from the command line.\nIn theory, it should be as simple as:  \ncdrdao write album-master.toc\n\nbut in practice, it turned out to be a bit more complicated than that. Here's what I had to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*simulate - Before anything else, let's use simulate instead of write. It'll avoid ruining a CDr if an error occurs. We'll revert back to write once a simulation has completed with success.\n\n*device - Next, it can't hurt to specify which drive you want to use. cdrdao scanbus will list your drive(s) address(es). I wanted to use /dev/sr0 so added this to the command: --device /dev/sr0 \n\n*driver - By default cdrdao uses the generic-mmc driver, and by default this driver doesn't write CD-TEXT. We have to specifically state that we want to also burn the text by setting the driver bit to 0x10 like this: --driver generic-mmc:0x10\n\n*speed - I haven't used that option as cdrdao detects the speed of the drive automatically, but if you want you can add --speed 4 to the command to force your drive to write at that speed (mine won't go below 16).\nSo now the command looks more like this:  \ncdrdao simulate --device /dev/sr0 --driver generic-mmc:0x10 album-master.toc\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ardour's TOC - cdrdao can be a bit sniffy with the toc files generated by Ardour(5): \n\n\n*\n\n*If you used the Performer field in any of Ardour's CD markers, then it has to be filled in for every track, otherwise cdrdao fails.\n\n*We have to open the toc file in a text editor to manually edit the TITLE and PERFORMER of the whole cd, located in the first CD_TEXT block (but do not add a COMPOSER entry there or cdrdao will fail).\n\n*Whilst we're here, Ardour hardcodes the wav file location which means that if we ever move the .wav and .toc files to a different folder/device, cdrdao will not find the .wav file and fail.

So I have to fix that every time before exporting.\n\n*I kept the most annoying/weird bug for last. cdrdao kept failing with this error:\nERROR: Cannot set write parameters mode page.\nand telling me to Please try to use the 'generic-mmc-raw' driver.\nBut changing the command to --driver generic-mmc-raw would also fail, this time with a different error:\nERROR: Write data failed.\nThen sometimes, seemingly at random, everything would work perfectly and I could write as many cds as I wanted.\nEventually I worked it out: first run the command once with --driver generic-mmc-raw, let it fail with the Write data failed error, and after that the command with --driver generic-mmc:0x10 works fine.

My computer is pretty much idle with only I-nex open. It says my cpu temp is about 2c. Is that ok and if I overclock is the temperature reading accurate? Also at the most it went to 10c, sometimes 5c.\n\nA: It depends. If you have a water cooling setup such low temperatures are possible if you´re air cooling than your telemetric data is definitely incorrect. The best thing is to check your BIOS data: if it´s displaying +/- 10 °C you can go on. The measured temperature also depends on your sensor location. A thermometer inside the CPU can measure 60 °C while at the same time a thermometer at a different spot inside the CPU could only measure 30 °C.\nFor an AMD fx-4150 a temperature of 70 °C is definitely fine and for a short period of time it also can handle up to 95 °C but try to avoid very hight temperatures. Last but not least I highly recommend you to set up some kind of 'automatic emergency kill switch' inside your BIOS making it that if your CPU temperature reaches hight levels the BIOS automatically lowers the CPU frequency.\n", "Q: List ASCII text files I want to list and sort all the files in a directory that are ASCII text files but don't necessarily have a .txt extension.

I installed Ubuntu so I could dual-boot, but something happened (I cannot say what it was, for I really don't know) and I have not been able to boot into Ubuntu since. Because of this, I deleted the Ubuntu partition, and then tried booting from my Windows 8 recovery USB. When I tried this, I followed instructions that said I would have to use the command prompt to write in bootrec.exe /fixmbr. Doing this was supposed to delete the rest of Ubuntu that was left on my computer after I deleted the partition. \nHowever, I restarted my computer after entering that into the command prompt, and the bootloader brought up the option to boot into Ubuntu. Still!\nNow, I don't know if this matters or not, but I want to get rid of Ubuntu and replace it with a version that isn't missing components or what have you, so that way I can use it again.

Is there anyone out there that might be able to help me? I just want to eliminate the old, broken version, and reinstall a new, working version.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can re-install Ubuntu the same way, you installed it the first time. Format or delete the partitions assigned to the previous installation, to make sure, it's gone and doesn't mess with the new installation. You can use the partition manager built-in to the installation assistant with the Something else option.\nYou can keep using Windows, while Ubuntu is installed, if you don't find it reliable enough (yet). Alternatively, you can choose to “Try Ubuntu” without installation to check out hardware compatibility (see next point).\n\n*Hardware compatibility is a big issue on Linux unfortunately for various reasons. If a piece of hardware isn't brand new¹ or exotic, there are actually good chances, that it runs out of the box or with a few simple touches.\nIn many cases though, drivers need to be installed manually or even compiled from source. Often you'll find a relevant question here.\nIn all other cases you can ask your own question and people will try to help you, if they know how (which usually comes down to searching online for suitable descriptions and instructions and adapting them to the specifics of Ubuntu). To speed things up, it helps if you follow the advice on asking hardware compatibility questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a hardware detection problem, what logs do I need to look into?\n\n*My wireless/WiFi connection does not work.

Where one can rate apps in Ubuntu phone App store. \nExample: I go to \"Ubuntu Store\" search for Calculator and select \"Ubuntu Calculator App reboot\". I install the app, and I would like to contribute review. I see reviews of other users, but I can not fill in my own.\n\nA: You can only post reviews for apps that are currently installed. You can go to the store scope and find the installed app, or long press on the icon in the main apps scope, to get to the preview. Under the information for the app, and above the existing reviews, there is a widget for entering a new review.\nThere seems to be an issue where for some people, the review entry widget is not appearing. If you are seeing this, it is already reported as a bug. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to recreate the condition where this seems to happen, so it is very difficult to debug, and thus get a fix deployed.\n", "Q: where is Adobe Flash Prefrences? I use Mate, on both debian and Ubuntu, periodically I like to use a video chat website that uses flash. I find that if the site doesn't have permissions to flash camera and mic setting prior to visiting the site, when i try to configure camera and mic settings via the flash object, the plugin crashes, and I need to log out of the site, and thus reload flash. In Debian, Mate, under Settings>Preferences>Adobe Flash Player I can grant permissions to sites prior to going to the site. Doing so seems to prevent flash from hanging up when I try to stream video. \nSo, how can I get an Adobe Flash preferences option, akin to what is in Debian, in Ubunutu?\nhere an image of what I am talking about.   \nFor Clarification:\nWhen I try to use the on-line global settings menu, it hangs. Then I must close the tab, and reopen it, because it gets stuck right there.  Also, this link, is hella old, macro-media hasn't owned flash since 2005. \nI get the same behavior when i try to use the online global settings menu in debian. It only works when I can set the site preferences prior to going to the site. \nThis is why I am interested in finding the Prefrences menu for Adobe flash in ubuntu.\n\nA: You can change your settings here\n\nA: Ok, it would be nice to have something in the preferences menu, but I found flash-player-properties in terminal. that launches the configuration menu in debian, when I go home in a few hours, I will test it in Ubuntu.\n::Home sweet Home::\nok, well its wasn't in there by default as part of the package which installed via the software center, and sudo apt-get install flash-player-properties didn't work either. \nThere were no additional packages in the software center for adobe flash (even with all sources enabled), I decided to reinstall from source. In Debian, I can't recall how I installed flash. It might have been from source. \nAnyhow, I downloaded the package from https://get2.adobe.com/flashplayer/\n,extracted it, and cd'd into the source dir.\nas soon as I entered sudo cp -r usr/* /usr I had the adobe flash preferences in my system preferences. \nthe command flash-player-properties  now works too. \n", "Q: 14.04 - How to automatically get sudo rights to objects on desktop When I FTP things from my Desktop PC onto my Ubuntu laptop's desktop, I don't have root priveleges for those files, so I need to remove it manually with sudo nautilus.\nIs there any way to automatically give me permissions to files that are transferred onto my desktop?\n\nA: After you have transferred the files on to your desktop you may use the command\nchown \nto change ownership to yourself \n", "Q: How to store OpenVPN password when using a static-challenge I use two factor authentication for OpenVPN, and I am doing that using the static-challenge directive.\nI also want to store my VPN username and password.\nI tried doing this using auth-user-password up per the man page, but when I do that, it doesn't give me an opportunity to offer a static-challenge, so that fails.\nI tried writing a python script that would pass a username, password, and challenge response via stdin to the openvpn process, but openvpn doesn't seem to get any of the things I send to stdin (even though running the same code against a sample script I wrote that gets input using sys.stdin.readline() worked).

Unfortunately, it's not easy to copy and paste the results, because I don't have network access.\nWhat are my next steps?\n\nA: I discovered the source of the problem.  It's not a driver issue.\nI installed using an amazing script that automatically adjusts to any Chromebook:\nTrue Ubuntu on Chromebook ARM (samsung)\nThe ARM-based Samsungs are the most difficult case, but the script handles it almost perfectly, except for 3 issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*The touchpad doesn't quite work right.\n\n*It doesn't make bash the default shell, which causes some annoyances in the Terminal app.\n\n*At least for me, DNS doesn't work.\n\n\nThe solution to issues 1 and 2 can be found here:\nhttp://withouttheloop.com/articles/2013-07-26-samsung-chromebook-ubuntu/\nFor issue 3, I discovered that the default DNS servers were useless.

I am not sure that this is needed but I did it before modifying the GRUB configuration file as below (and as per the mentioned post).  \nPassing two kernel boot parameters i8942.nomux and i8042.reset gets rid of the problem.\nTo be able to get Ubuntu to load I had to start the laptop and press f8 to get to the GRUB menu, then press e to edit and go down to the line with ro (second to last) and add the i8042.nomux i8042.reset parameters there it, then press f10 to boot. You only have to do this once. \nAfter booting, to set the parameters permanently, edit the file /etc/default/grub, for example using\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nFind the line that starts\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\n\nand add the two extra parameters so that after your changes it looks something like\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash i8942.nomux i8042.reset\"\n\nSave and exit, then run\nsudo update-grub\n\nto make the changes effective, then reboot.\nAfter installing the flgrx drivers, I think the monitor worked as expected. After the boot settings, everything else worked as expected. Even the suspend feature works now. \nOne more thing - in the BIOS of the laptop I set the display to LCD only as per another forum thread.

I installed it and, since then, the laptop has serious problems to boot.\nYou see, I start the laptop using the power button and it displays the OEM logo, goes to a purple screen, and then it shuts down! Shuts down completely, like there was a blackout or some sort of power outage. Then, out of nowhere the laptop starts again, displays the OEM logo and opens GRUB. It lists: Ubuntu, Advanced options for Ubuntu, and System setup. I highlight \"Ubuntu\" and press Enter, but it shuts down again.\nWhen I select \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\", the system displays all Ubuntu \"images\" (if I can describe them as that). Some times it doesn't matter which one I choose, it happens the same over and over.\nIt seems like the more updated my laptop is, the more times to shut down/power on it takes to boot properly. Sometimes it doesn't boot quite well (wrong keyboard layout, no Wi-Fi, etc.) and I have to suffer it all again. The last time I tried to boot, it took 6-8 shutdowns.\nIs there anything I am doing wrong? Is my HDD too old for Ubuntu?\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.

Either open the script link in your browser and copy-paste the script source manually into a text file and save it as \"10_1_1.sh\" in your terminal's working directory, or try to use curl in place of wget (in either cases you can then follow the other instructions):\ncurl -o 10_1_1.sh https://raw.github.com/zpanel/installers/master/install/Ubuntu-12_04/10_1_1.sh\n\n\nA: Basically, it is because of permission issues, so use the Authorization header with the wget command.\nExample:\nwget --header=\"Authorization: Basic A2l0Y99uLmlxQGhh\" \"https://mysite.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1841544/US_export_policy.jar\"\n\nHere A2l0Y99uLmlxQGhh is the base64 of username:password.\nTo convert the username:password to base64 use the command below (in Unix systems only):\nprintf '%s' 'user:password' | base64\n\n", "Q: How to configure 2.1 speakers?

I installed Ubuntu 14.10. Periodically, it will repeat a keystroke about 20 times. At other times the keyboard seems frozen and the key presses never show up. I've seen some very old posts about this, most in the 2006/2007 time frame. None of the work arounds help. Anyone come across this, or know how to fix it?\n\nA: I discovered that the keyboard errors were evident even within the BIOS settings pages. I couldn't very well test the key repeat there, as there is no place to type things, only select settings, but in scrolling through the menus, I noticed the same keyboard freeze issue. Apparently there is a hardware issue at play. I don't think there is anything Ubuntu can do about this.

So you need the port and protocol to make sure that GPG (which is running the request behind-the-scenes) knows exactly where to go to get the key.\nYour first example is equivalent to:\napt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371 0xcbcb082a1bb943db\nSince you need to specify :80 when using apt-key adv, your network administrator or ISP has blocked port 11371.\n", "Q: Broke Gnome Shell while trying to add a substitute themes folder-- now computer boots to a black screen, I'm not really thinking in whole sentences right now, so I'll just break this problem down by sections. Let's avoid laughing at my stupid error and focus on fixing the problem too. And it WAS a stupid error. Fortunately I backed up my critical files before attempting.\nHow it happened: Was attempting to replace the “themes” folder in Gnome-Shell. Original folder renamed “themes-original”, new folder (with themes inside) given the name of the original folder and moved into the directory.\nResult: Gnome-Shell went crazy. Attempted logout via tty1 which was unsuccessful. Force shut down pc as the whole thing had locked up, and was on the fast lane to nowhere.\nProblem: machine will no longer fully boot. When attempting to boot, will clear the Ubuntu logo, but after that is simply a black screen. Tty1 menu CAN be reached, but booting into unity, kde-plasma, or lxde (all are installed) from tty1 seems fruitless as of current writing.\nFurthermore: using a bootable usb drive is not turning out any decent results. Can use the bios to attempt to boot via usb, but each time the computer insists the drive is not valid and knocks me back to square one.\nWhat I need: Preferably some other way of using TTY1 to force another desktop environment, or, a way of reinstalling Gnome-Shell so that it will work again (possibly by telling it to look in the renamed folder with the original theme?).\nEDIT 4/3/2015\nAt this point, I am ready to simply wipe Gnome Shell completely. If I do this from TTY1 via\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-shell, how can I get the startx to denote a different (read: ANY) desktop to load?\n\nA: Okay, so this is a problem solved.\nSeeing as I hate it when people just go \"PROBLEM SOLVED\" in a forum leaving me wondering how they did it, I will elaborate for anyone who cares to know.\nI ran sudo apt-get remove gnome-shell in TTY1 to remove gnome-shell, then followed up with killall -u username.\nFrom what I understand, it was a bit like trying to unlock your door by throwing a nuclear bomb at it, but it successfully forced me back to the splash screen with no gnome-shell option, and Unity loaded safely and reliably.\nI restarted (somewhat nervously) to see if it stuck. It did.\nI'm giving this solution a tentative thumbs up, even if it was a little inelegant.\n", "Q: How to install and/or run Universal Media Server on Ubuntu 14.04? I have installed UMS onto my Ubuntu box according to the manual here. All commands worked fine except two:\n1) I was unable to install ffmpeg package which is absent in this version of Ubuntu.

How to check the installation?\n\nA: You are probably running ums with root privileges, which is what the documentation states against. You need to create a new account on your install or use your own profile. This is also the reason why debug.log is not generated.\nSteps to follow : \nlogin as root or > sudo -i , once you are in your own account command prompt.\nenter password\n> update-rc.d -f UMS remove\n> exit\n> sudo chown YOURUSER:YOURGROUP -R /opt/ums\n> chmod u=rwx,grx,o= -R /opt/ums\n\nNow, if you look in the opt/ums directory you will find a folder named linux. This actually contains the versions of ffmpeg and tsMuxeR we need. so change these paths in UMS.conf\n> cd /opt/ums\n> nano UMS.conf\n\nSearch for section \"# Non-GUI Options\"\nthen start with changing paths as follows :\nmencoder_path = /usr/bin/mencoder\nffmpeg_path =/opt/ums/linux/ffmpeg\nmplayer_path = /usr/bin/mplayer\n......\n\nif you need to check the paths use : whereis mencoder\n\nOnce done, if there are any packages missing like mencoder, manually install them from their respective websites.\nfor remaning just use this with root login:\napt-get install mediainfo flac\n\nThis should install all required codecs.

I just noticed that Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) ships unity 7.3 and it looks promising because of the transparent top bar thingy. I want it on my Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS because I don't want to install Vivid on my computer right now (considering it's a beta) and I want to check some things out before I go burn the beta .iso.\n\nA: You do not install core Ubuntu+1 software in a current release. For something like VLC you could install from source or a 3rd party bleeding edge PPA but if you want to test something as Unity 7.3 you need to install vivid in virtual box or vmware.\nInstalling Unity 7.3 into a current release will pull in every bit of software that is Vivid. Effectively making your system Vivid. \nI also assume you meant to install it and not download.\nIf you do actually want to download it you can from the launchpad page.

I want to KEEP my wired networking.\nThanks\nTHIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE AS I WANT TO DELETE NOT DISABLE\n\nA: I would disable it in BIOS if possible or remove the wifi card from the computer\n\nA: I believe the best method is to blacklist the driver because if you need to use it in the future you simply unblacklist it and you are back online.\nRun this command and it will tell you the driver your device is using:\nlspci -nnk | grep -iA2 net   \n\nthen run:\necho \"blacklist driver name\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nYou put your devices driver name in the command were driver name is now.\nTo unblacklist the driver run:\n sudo sed 's/blacklist driver name//' -i /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nplease note that your driver name will not have any spaces in it.\n\nA: You didn't tell anything about your hardware, but both my Dell and Lenovo laptops have a physical switch to enable/disable wifi :) That would be the easiest way.\n\nA: On my HP laptop (granted, it's a business laptop and I don't think a lot of consumer laptops have the second option I'm about to tell you about) I can disable wifi with a hardware switch and even remove the wifi module through a hatch in the bottom of the laptop just like the hard drive and ram can be removed or changed.\nUsually wifi also can be disabled in the bios settings, so look for this if you can't physically remove any module.

See screenshot:\n\nAny ideas how to get it to show the icon?\n\nA: Google-chrome is famous for its problems with .desktop files and their icons, especially if you had an other version installed before.\nSince you installed it from a .deb file, an icon must be installed. Most certainly, there must be an old, outdated or incorrect .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications causing the \"disconnection\".\nLocal .desktop files \"overrule\" global ones, therefore, if there is a local .desktop that does not \"match\" (the current version of) a globally installed application, a variety of symptoms can occur. An iconless appearance is one of them.\nWhat do do\nSince you technically don't need local .desktop files of a globally installed applications (unless you want do make modifications to its behaviour), you can safely remove all .desktop files, referring to google-chrome, in ~/.local/share/applications. Simply browse to the directory and remove all .desktop files of google-chrome or webapps, calling google-chrome. Then log out and back in and run the application again to see if it is fixed.\nIf you are having doubts on a specific .desktop file, make it executable to make it show its icon and the correct \"interface\" name (as defined in the line Name= inside the .desktop file).\n", "Q: How to autostart an application on Touch device?

In this manner, AppArmor policy groups can be defined for these helpers using standard AppArmor DBus rules, etc. These type of helpers do not need any modification-- apps are either allowed to use them or not, and this is decided by AppArmor.\n\nApps are stopped and killed without mercy:\nTX Linux Fest 2015 - Ted Gould - Ubuntu Phone: Application Lifecycle \nThey shouldn't do the hard work.\n", "Q: Samba, files readable but not writable Environment: PC with Windows 8.1 and Raspberry Pi with Raspbian.

Also, I cannot create a directory; not authorized.\nWhat is wrong is my smb.conf?\n\nA: If I understand, you wish to have total control (read/write/create...) on the 'pihome' share.\nThen, use the following:\n\n[pihome] \n    comment= Pi Home \n    path=/home/pi \n    browsable=yes \n    writable=yes \n    force create mode = 0777 \n    force directory mode = 0777 \n    public=yes\nAbout the 'homes' section: this is normally referring to the directory that belongs to a specific user on Unix (normally /home/uid).  As such, it is intended to be only available per user (which means you have to enter uid + password)\nI would therefore leave it unchanged from the default value:\n\n[homes]\n        comment = Unix user directory\n        valid users = %S\n        read only = No\n        browseable = No\n\n", "Q: How to get version of installed Juju I want to see what version of Juju is installed.

I ended up formatting everything and installing Ubuntu fresh with GPT. It used to be far simpler in my previous laptop where there was no UEFI/Secure boot complication. I tried to get my head around it but couldn't.\nNow, a few months after that, I've realized I need to install Windows 7, but I can't afford to screw up my current Ubuntu installation.\nWhat would be the best way to dual-boot Ubuntu now? I can easily afford 50gigs or so for Windows out of the 386.7 GiB partition.\n\nA: Consider running Windows under VirtualBox, QEMU, VMware, or whatever other virtualization software you like. That will keep it contained and eliminate any dual-boot hassles.\nIf running Windows in a virtualization environment is unacceptable, then you should read up on how to install Windows in EFI (aka UEFI) mode. The Windows 7 installation medium will often boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode by default and then complain about your use of GPT. Some people have jumped through hoops to convert GPT to MBR in response to this complaint, but that just creates new problems. You may need to copy the Windows install files to a USB flash drive or otherwise tweak things to get a clean EFI-mode boot, but that's the way to go. Unfortunately, I don't have a link handy to a good guide on this, but a Web search should turn something up.\nBefore installing, shrink the Linux partition(s) whose space you want to sacrifice, since the Windows installer can't do that. Also, back everything up; it's easy to go wrong with OS installations and accidentally trash your existing partitions.\nI note from your gdisk output that you've got an existing type-8300 partition that presumably holds a Linux filesystem and two type-0700 partitions. The 0700 type code should be used exclusively by FAT and NTFS partitions, but previous generations of Linux (including Ubuntu) used that code inappropriately for Linux filesystems, so it's unclear if those are leftover Windows 8 partitions or Linux partitions. If the latter, I strongly recommend that you change the type codes to 8300 in gdisk. That will reduce the odds of Windows \"helpfully\" setting up these \"blank\" partitions with NTFS, which of course would trash them. If these partitions are your leftover Windows 8 partitions and if you don't need them, you could delete them or use mkntfs or GParted to wipe them clean and prepare them for hosting Windows 7.\n", "Q: 14.04 - Unable to connect Windows PPTP VPN I am trying to connect a Windows PPTP VPN.

Could not exec dpkg!\n\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (100)\n\nNote: My system is set to Spanish Language.\nWhen I try to install somethink I have this same error when running the sudo apt-get install command.\nEdit\nAfter following Geppettvs D'Constanzo advice on permissions on dpkg I receive this in the terminal:\nRoot@ns382469: ~ * chmod 755/usr/bin/dpkg\nchmod: it is not possible to accede to \"/usr/bin/dpkg\": the file or the directory does not exist\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: A quick search on several support places returned many posts talking about dpkg permissions which is solved by providing the proper permissions as mentioned in this site: https://thelowedown.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/debian-apt-get-installs-fail-with-dpkg-error-code-100/\nI am going to reproduce the steps over here for your convenience.\n\nThe Advanced Package Tool, or ‘apt’ on Debian-based systems is the\n  mainstay for installing, upgrading and removing packages.  Behind the\n  various apt tools, the Debian package manager, dpkg, carries out the\n  heavy lifting.  You might wish to install new versions of packages\n  periodically with the sequence:\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\n\nRecently, this and any other upgrade failed on Debian Lenny with:\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (100)\n\nA quick look at /usr/bin/dpkg revealed the following!\n---------- 1 root root 365324 2010-03-08 15:35 dpkg\n\nA quick ‘chmod 755 /usr/bin/dpkg’ fixed the problem!  I know I did not\n  change the permissions, so it must have been a recent patch. \n  Hopefully this gets fixed quickly!\n\nI suggest you to have a look (as mentioned in the page) to dpkg permissions in order to see if this is your case. You can do it by running ls -l /usr/bin/dpkg\nIt should return something like:\ngeppettvs@T400:~$ ls -l /usr/bi/dpkg                                          \n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 261840 jun  9  2014 /usr/bin/dpkg\n\nPlease edit your question in order to add the details of this last command and if you see different file permissions, try the solution previously mentioned in order to attempt fixing your error.\nIf you need further help don't hesitate to drop a comment over here.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: What has problem, when cursor is movable and everything else is not working?

(I have replaced any information I do not wish to provide with *****.)\n\nA: If you received an email with Approved or Rejected, then you've uploaded your package successfully.\nBut, in this case, after the upload the package was rejected with the message Source/binary (i.e. mixed) uploads are not allowed.\nI.e., you need to build a source package only.\nIn order to achieve that, create your package with debuild -S.\n", "Q: How to download Ubuntu without installing? I have a very simple question, can I download Ubuntu without installing it?\nI want to put Ubuntu onto a 4 GB memory card and install on another laptop later as the other laptop is not protected.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible. You didn't say if the computer where you will download runs Windows or Ubuntu. But you need to download the Ubuntu ISO on that computer, then prepare the memory card or USB stick, and finally boot the second computer using the stick or card.\nDownload Ubuntu from here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/\nSee this guide on how to do it for Windows: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nand this one if your first computer runs Ubuntu: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\n\nA: Do you have an USB Stick? If Yes, you can download an .iso Image from Ubuntu and then you have to put the .iso File to the USB-Stick an then you can boot and install it from the USB.\n", "Q: shut down restart command I have a dual boot setup with windows and ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Also, you need to make sure that your playlist is in the proper location before it can be played by Video.\nHere's the detailed procedures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Trasnfer the WHOLE music folder from Windows onto your Linux machine. (e.g. say the folder is initially E:\\MyWindows\\Music on the Windows machine, which includes a sub folder E:\\MyWindows\\Music\\Instrumental)\n\n*Transfer your playlist also from Windows to Linux (if it is not already in the file transferred in the previous step), into the same destination file.\n\n*Open terminal in the destination directory (e.g. say you have put it in /home/MyUbuntu/Music, then open terminal and type\ncd Music)\n\n*Once you're in that directory, type gedit [InsertPlaylistNameHere].wpl (or use Vim if you )\n\n*Ctrl + H to delete all \"E:\\MyWindows\\Music\\\" (i.e. the file location appending the song name) and replace all \"E:\\MyWindows\\Music\\Instrumental\\\" to \"Instrumental/\"\nNote the change in the direction of the last slash.\nOnce you're done just close the gedit and open the .wpl with Video. It should work, although the album arts may not show.\n(I have not found a method to make it work with Rhythmbox though.)\n", "Q: utilise atom or sublime text in ubuntu Python Ruby As a beginner I initiated python with IDLE: You write a code, than save the file and run with F5.\nIn the past days I asked how to run scripts.

It's good but not for all files e.g. files in /home/myname/Dropbox/programs/python.... are not accessible with this method.\nAnd I want to know how to deal with this problem.\n\nA: Python code can be compiled and run from Sublime using Ctrl+B or Tools->Build System->Python. I'm just not sure why the script in your Dropbox folder won't run, have you checked the file permissions? \n\nA: Finally The best is to write cd and the whole path.\nwith the use of the upper array in terminal, it is easy to write again the path.\nThe use of control + B in sublime is less practical, in particular for input() functions.\nand in the terminal it is easy for the choice of python version, 2.7 or 3.4.\nfor ruby too.\n", "Q: Where do I look for cron errors I have 2 cron jobs that were running fine but now stopped running. I looked through my crontab and everything looks OK. How can I tell if these jobs are running? is there a place where cron stores errors? Where do I look for cron specific errors, or even a record of the cron jobs that ran prior.\n\nA: Try directing the output to a log file.  Just make sure that it exists and is writable by whatever user the cronjob is running as.  (In my example, this would be cyphertite)\nI also recommend running date somewhere at the beginning of your script so that you get the date in the log file.  \n 0 15 * * *    /home/andrew/daily-backup.sh >> /var/log/cyphertite.log\n\nAdditionally, cron logs are directed to /var/log/syslog if that helps\n", "Q: QAxObject: No such file or directory I have created a QT 5 Console Application for read an xls file, but when I include QAxBase and QAxObject header files it gives me following error:\nerror : QAxObject: No such file or directory \n\nMy code:\n#include <QtCore/QCoreApplication>\n#include <QAxBase>\n#include <QAxObject>\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\nQCoreApplication a(argc, argv);\n\n...\n\nreturn a.exec();\n}\n\nHow to resolve this error?\n\nA: You've probably already resolved this, but in any case.

I tried messing around with the config files but I ended up just reformatting and reinstalling ubuntu.\nI don't think the nvidia drivers are compatibile with ubuntu so now I'm not sure what to do, how can I get the drivers I need? Seems like a bit of waste to use my integrated gpu if I have a powerful nvidia one on the machine. \n\nA: That's why you're supposed to use the driver which are distrubuted through Ubuntu repositories. When you download driver from Nvidia site, it will modify kernel.\nThe way you are supposed to get to the nvidia drivers (though not newest) is to open Software & Updates from your Ubuntu Dash, click on the Additional Drivers tab and pick the driver from the menu which you want. Chances are that the nuveau driver is already installed, but if you want the proprietary nvidia driver, choose it, click on Apply Changes and after and wait for a while.\nA alternative way to install these these same drivers  - Open a terminal and type\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nFor the tested version, or for the bleeding edge version (possible bugs)\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\n", "Q: Gimp: I can't find any of the controls or toolbars that I used to be able to see I used to use Gimp and really liked it but it's been awhile.

I was running a duel boot windows 8.1 and ubuntu 14.04 when I suddenly could no longer boot my system. After booting into a live usb and run GParted I get this error: \n\nInput/output error during read on /dev/sdb\n/dev/sda contains GPT signatures, indicating that it has a GPT table.  However, it does not have a valid fake msdos partition table, as it should.  Perhaps it was corrupted -- possibly by a program that doesn't understand GPT partition tables.  Or perhaps you deleted the GPT table, and are now using an msdos partition table.  Is this a GPT partition table?\nBoth the primary and backup GPT tables are corrupt.  Try making a fresh table, and using Parted's rescue feature to recover partitions.\n\nIs there a way to fix this? I have tried TestDisk which won't run. Is there also a way I can backup my hard drive before I do anything that might damage my computer.\n\nA: The simplest option is to try to use the backup GPT table. This is stored automatically on the disk. The gdisk utility can do all of this for you. Simply load as normal,\n# gdisk /dev/sdb\n\nAnd enter the recovery and transformation menu (r), and option c to load the backup table.

Then\njuju deploy ubuntu --constraints tags=<tag that we set>\n\nA new node with ubuntu will come up.\nNow deploy the service on that machine\njuju deploy <charm_url> --to <machine_number>\n\n", "Q: Windows share mounts but without write permissions I am trying to mount a Samba Shared Folder in Ubuntu, but I am facing some issues because when the folder is mounted, I have no permission to write on mounted folder.\nFirst of all, the shared folder is on a server called vmfox and the folder's name is apps.

Using various articles, I've managed to get it mostly working, but most examples I've found are centered around tunnel routers, which I've also built, but I guess I'm looking more for best practices when it comes to a native IPv6 router/firewall.\nAs background, eth0 is my internal interface, and eth1 is external.  I currently have something like:\niface eth0 inet6 static\naddress 2605:xxxx:yyyy:zzzz::1\nnetmask 64\n\niface eth1 inet6 static\naddress 2605:xxxx:yyyy:zzzz::2\nnetmask 64\n\nConnectivity has been verified in/out on eth1, so I'm being routed correctly by my ISP.  I'm planning on using radvd on eth0.  I'm also planning on using ip6tables as the firewall.\nWhere I'm fuzzy is how (or if) I should sub-divide my prefix.  I have a number of VLANs accessible to eth0, though given the age of my equipment, I'll probably have to route them via this (virtual) router, so I may end up with either more interfaces or use trunking in some form on eth0.\nMost of the machines on this network are virtual, largely on two VLANs.  There are probably fewer than 200 active machines, most IPv6-capable.\nI originally considered building a bridge instead of a router, but I do want some protection on my network - most machines only want outbound access, and we won't be hosting any public servers at this point.\nMy questions are pretty basic:\n\n\n*\n\n*From a best-practices standpoint, what prefix should I use for a VLAN/subnet? /72? /68?\n\n*Should eth0 and eth1 be on separate subnets?  Is this a dumb question? \n\n*Should I be using a bridge instead of a router?  Advantages/disadvantages?\n\n\nMy main issue is that there don't seem to be a lot of native examples out there that aren't simple, aren't about Cisco equipment, or don't use BGP.  One, good simple example would probably answer all my questions.\nThanks!\n\nA: The size you should route to a subnet is a /64. Things like autoconfiguration don't work if you don't use a /64 per subnet. If you only get a single /64 from your ISP then you won't be able to route it in any convenient way. An ISP should give you a /48, or at least a /56, and route that whole prefix to your gateway router. Then you can create subnets and route.\nBasically, with your current setup you are limited to a single subnet. So you should create a bridge.\n\nA: I would reconsider using your ISP as a IPv6 provider if they have not given you at least one IPv6 /64 net that is routed to you and one IPv6 address for your external interfacenfor your router.\nIt could aldo benthe case that you have misunderstood what they given you.  \nYou need one IPv6 address on a net provided by your ISP for your external interface. That is their net, not yours, that your router reaches Internet. It could be given to you as a static, DHCPv6 or by SLAAC. The first and second need you and your ISP to communicate addresses, like MAC of your router or the IPV6 address and netmask (CIDR format). With SLAA,  all this is automaticly set.\nThe net you have must be /64, or SLAAC and therfore radvd will not work. Then you have to manually set all your machines addresses. No, DHCPv6 will not work either, as it is built on top of same mechanism as SLAAC uses.\nAnd if your ISP doesn't give you an /48 or /56 net when ask, you should again reconsider your choice of ISP.\nSo, one plain IPv6 connection to your ISP, like you would with a tunnel.\nAnd one routed net for your LANs, and nothing less than /64 and when asked /48 or /56 net that you then can divide into different /64 nets for your LANs. Do not use anything except /64 for a LAN, or you will get problems.\nFor firewall, don't use pure ip6tables, unless you have read and understood all relevant RFCs. \nI would recommend ufw for servers and shorewall6 for routers. \nYou should aldo consider configure DNS through radvd (or DHCPv6 if you consider using that and not SLAAC), and then you need a package for each clent to set that.  Also in Debian based distributions like Ubuntu, install the package resolvconf.\n", "Q: IPV6 Still resists I've got a problem in disabling IPV6 under Ubuntu 14.04\nI still have UDP6 port opened even I invalidate IPV6...\nHas anybody a solution?\n$ sudo netstat -lntup\nConnexions Internet actives (servers only)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Adresse locale Adresse distante Etat PID/Program name\ntcp 0 0 127.0.1.1:53 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 1447/dnsmasq\ntcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:631 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 4156/cupsd\nudp 0 0 0.0.0.0:631 0.0.0.0:* 1103/cups-browsed\nudp 0 0 0.0.0.0:5353 0.0.0.0:* 969/avahi-daemon: r\nudp 0 0 0.0.0.0:48634 0.0.0.0:* 969/avahi-daemon: r\nudp 0 0 0.0.0.0:34727 0.0.0.0:* 3090/dhclient\nudp 0 0 127.0.1.1:53 0.0.0.0:* 1447/dnsmasq\nudp 0 0 0.0.0.0:68 0.0.0.0:* 3090/dhclient\nudp6 0 0 :::14820 :::* 3090/dhclient\nudp6 0 0 :::5353 :::* 969/avahi-daemon: r\nudp6 0 0 :::57413 :::* 969/avahi-daemon: r\n\nAnd I did a disable:\n$ sudo sysctl -p\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\n\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\n1\n$ sudo ufw status verbose\nÉtat*: actif\nJournalisation*: on (low)\nDefault: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)\nNouveaux profils*: skip\n\n\nThanks,\nbut I have solved a part of the problem in avahi-daemon:\navahi-deamon.conf 's got a \"USE-IPV6\" that I've put to NO... \nI reboot, (BTW... it accelerates the boot!) and still remains only DHCLIENT in UDP6...\n(that was not available at my first reboot, but come back at second!)\nSO now the goal is to invalidate IPV6 in DHCLIENT! \nmaybe in dhclient-script ?... but I'm not aware of this.\n\nA: Try disabling ipv6 on the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line in /etc/default/grub.

The path /path/to/disk.img can also point to a partition or a loop device.\n\nA: After reading the post update and comments, essentially what you have is an .img of a Windows system that you hope to mount with Virtual Box in such a way that it boots the Windows OS on that .img file you have. In other words, you have the .img of a physical machine and want to run it as a virtual machine because there is software installed on that Window's OS that you need to use (to be sure, this is the equivalent of having a \"host operating system to run a 3rd part operating system\")\nWhile you've been able to mount the drive and access the files, obviously the programs installed under Windows on that disk image won't run in Ubuntu and why you wish to \"...get the image booted up as [you] want to use the windows programs [you] need to access\"\nGranted, it's been 7 years since this question was asked and perhaps the frustrations felt by the OP may have passed by now, but maybe this will serve the needs of others coming across this question or help bring clarity to a miscommunication.\nA Foreword for \"Mount and boot the disk image\"\nTo provide an assured understanding of what the OP hopes to accomplish and to introduce references that may differ to help avoid confusion, let's establish some points:\n\n*\n\n*The file \"ssd.img\" is a dd made copy of another system's solid state drive (SSD) that contained a Windows operating system.\n\n*Hypothetically, that image file could be written to a different physical SSD, and that new or replacement SSD could be installed in the original machine and be booted up.\n\n*With that said, instead of writing the .img file to a new or replacement SSD, the OP (if I'm not mistaken) wants to mount the .img file in Virtual Box to boot it up.\n\nClearing up miscommunication: To boot in VirtualBox, Things Have to Change\nBack in the day, we could create an .iso image of a CD-ROM, mount that iso image file, and run it as if it was the actual CD-ROM inserted in our computer. Since a hard disk image file is essentially the same thing but instead of a being a copy of a CD-ROM disc, it's a copy of an entire hard drive, we might think we could just mount the image file and run it as if it was the actual hard drive installed, through the use of Virtual box. However, that's not necessarily the case when it comes to an existing, already installed, operating system on an existing system's hard drive (or SSD in this case), at least when referring to how simply it might work out.\nThe task which you hope to accomplish is, as briefly aforementioned, is better known as or is more often referred to as the process of taking a physical machine and converting it to a virtual machine. Though it might seem like it would be something as simple as mounting the image file and \"attaching it\", what you're actually doing by mounting it in virtual box is turning it into a \"virtual hard drive\" to run in a virtual system environment created in Virtual Box. And, for booting it up, unfortunately it isn't as simple as just mounting it as a primary hard drive and hitting launch virtual machine, especially with Windows (more so in earlier versions of Windows).\nThus, to accomplish what you hope to do, you would actually need to convert the system itself (or more specifically in this case, the system disk image created by dd) from a raw disk image to a virtual disk or \"virtual disk image\".\nAgain, this is only because you want to boot the operating system contained in the .img file. Not to be confused with simply accessing the files which you've already mentioned being capable of doing, but to run and launch the operating system as a machine existing in VirtualBox, it needs to be converted.\nFurther Explanation: Complications of Booting a System Image containing Windows\nUnlike a Linux installation, Windows is not as adaptive to the changes of system hardware that comes as a result of moving a hard drive from one system to the next, at least, this was the case before Windows 8/10. So, when you create a virtual environment (or virtual system) to boot the .img file, which is acting as a virtual hard drive, you're essentially giving the Windows system that's on therea different set of unrecognized hardware to work with. More details of the complications Windows systems presents are explained on Virtual Box's page for How to migrate existing Windows Installations to Virtual Box and while the page does provide instructions on how to accomplish this, it is not officially supported:\n\nDisclaimer: Migration of Windows guests from a physical host into a\nVirtualBox VM is not supported. These instructions are provided as-is\nin the hope that they are helpful.\n\nThough this may be the case, plenty have reported being able to accomplish this. Personally, I have done this as well but the image file I had was of a Linux system and not Windows, though I was able to run it on Windows in Virtual Box.\nHow to Mount the image created in Linux and run in VirtualBox\nWhile not officially supported, there are still a couple of ways to do this, and with the changes introduced in Windows 8/10, if this doesn't apply to an older version of Windows (i.e. Windows Server 2000 or Windows 7), there are a couple of options to choose from for converting your image file so that it can be booted in Virtual Box.\nOption 1: Convert the .img file to a .vdi file using VBoxManager\nAs previously provided answers have suggested, and as you already know, VBox doesn't support mounting the .img directly so if you want to boot from that .img file, you'll need to convert it to a .vdi file. Hopefully it's become more apparent why the previous two answers both suggested that you use VboxManager to convert your .img file, however the commands they provided you were for the Windows Command line version of virtual box.\nSince it sounds like you're running an Ubuntu system and I would presume it's the one that is hosting the installation of VirtualBox, the syntax to convert an IMG file to VDI file from terminal is:\nVBoxManage convertdd ssd.img converted_ssd.vdi\n\n# You will get an output of something like this:\n\nConverting from raw image file=\"ssd.img\" to file=\"converted_ssd.vdi\"...\nCreating dynamic image with size 6012964864 bytes (5735MB)...\n \n\nOption 2: Use VMWare vCenter Converter Standalone to create a .vdmk file\nSince VirtualBox is capable of reading .vdmk files, others may find it useful to optionally use the VMware vCenter Converter to convert their physical machine (or in your case the .img file) to a virtual machine. For the open source version of the converter, it can be found here.\nFurther instructions for using VMware vCenter Converter will vary based on the version and can otherwise be found here.\nAs of February 2, 2022; as noted in their blog post, VMWare announced a renewed version of vCenter Converter was in progress whereas the link above reference the older original product.\nImport VDI or VDMK file into VirtualBox\nAfter creating a .vdi image file of your ssd.img, you can create a new virtual machine and assign it as the hard disk you wish to use, selecting the option for \"Use an existing virtual hard disk file\" and selecting your converted .vdi or .vdmk file from the explorer window pop-up.\nYou should be all set from there. Hopefully this helped clear up some of the misunderstandings or misinterpretations of what was suggested in helping you be able to mount and boot/run that image file in Virtual Box.\n", "Q: unresponsive keyboard and mouse after update I have Dell Inspiron desktop machine running Ubuntu 14.04 with dual boot.\nAt some moment I started having non-responsive USB keyboard and mouse on wake up after suspend on some occasions.

Specifically, I want the default operating system launched automatically (NOTE: I don't care whether or now the GRUB menu appears for a few seconds before booting into the default OS).  I get the desired behavior the next time I boot by editing the /etc/default/grub file and running update-grub.  However, things a back to bad on subsequent boots.  \nThe following work around suffers from the same issue for me: https://gist.github.com/LeahCim/9332432\nBefore I start digging around the grub.d scripts to band-aid a solution, I wondered if anyone has had recent luck with this issue.\n\nA: Grub OS prober script will check if timeout is 0, and if other OS is present, will force timeout=10.\nYou can edit, as sudo, /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober file and comment these lines (close to line 36):\nif [ \"\\${timeout}\" = 0 ]; then\n  set timeout=10\nfi\n\nComment using # so they'll be like this:\n#if [ \"\\${timeout}\" = 0 ]; then\n#  set timeout=10\n#fi\n\nSave it and close it.\nNow you can run sudo update-grub and your timeout=0 will be respected.\n", "Q: Which nvidia to install? Latest from Nvidia.com or from additional drivers? A very simple question\nWhich Nvidia driver is best to install?\nThe latest Nvidia driver from nvidia website which is 346.47\nor\nNvidia-331.113 from Additional Drivers tool?\nI have updated my kernel version to 3.18.3-031803-generic\n\nA: Which drivers to install depends entirely on how you use your system. The 331.113 drivers are generally more stable as they have been extensively tested for the current version of Ubuntu and are much less likely to malfunction than the latest drivers, the 346.47 drivers on the other hand use bleeding-edge technologies that may improve performance of video games and in some cases add additional features not seen in the older drivers, One example of this is that the 331.113 drivers do not support resolutions above 1920x1080 through HDMI while the 346.47 drivers can support additional resolutions but are generally less stable than the 331.113 drivers.\nIn summary, If you require stability then it is better to use the 331.113 drivers but if you require improved performance for video games or need any additional features provided by the newer drivers then it may be better to go for the 346.47 drivers instead.\nAdditionally, if you do decide to use the 346.47 drivers then it may to easier to install them using the xorg-edgers ppa which will allow you to install the latest 346 drivers using apt-get install:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: Open in Terminal context menu only opens terminal in home directory Been testing out Ubuntu 15.04 on my laptop.

What worked for me, on a MacBookPro5,2 (2009 17\") was simply to append \"nomodeset\" in front of \"quiet\". So the line will end with something like:\nnomodeset quiet splash --\nHope this helps someone else with an ageing (but still useful!) MacBook Pro. \n\nA: After much searching, this is what worked: when try ubuntu was highlighted, I pressed e and replaced the value: quiet splash with this: \"i8042.nomux=1 i8042.reset nomodeset\"\n\nA: This is normal.\nMacBooks have no i8042 controller (i.e. legacy keyboard controller). \nIf you are getting no keyboard function in grub, though, that is not normal.  That means the fallback of USB-HID or (U)EFI keyboard is not working.  In this case you need to add either the USB-HID or (U)EFI keyboard module for it.\nIf you have OS X installed with boot camp (I recommend installing a stripped copy of OS X on macs simply because it's needed for some firmware updates), you can use bootcamp instead of multiboot in order to provide proper USB Legacy emulation for keyboards to work around this problem.  This will also let you use the more reliable legacy BIOS version of GRUB.  (While EFI Grub is better than it used to be, it's still far from perfect.)\n\nA: The error code simply means that a device that was present during the installation is no longer connected. For me this was the USB CD drive.

Windows 7 / Ubuntu 14.04 So I'm gonna start out with this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10720995/\nOkay, so I have Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7 installed on separate hard drives like this:\nsda: Ubuntu 14.04 \nsdb: Windows 7 \nsdc: Extra Storage (badly partitioned) \nWhen I boot, I want to boot to grub on sda, but the boot info script says its on sdc! (the main problem being that grub can't find windows)\nIIRC, I had Ubuntu installed on sdc before and windows on sda. Which would explain the mess. I want to move grub from sdc to sda, but the Boot Repair won't let me (It tells me I have GPT and SRS).\nI think this is because of the sda1 and sda2 partitions. I wanted to delete them, but I still don't quite know what I'm doing and I don't want to corrupt/wipe a drive by accident. So I thought I would ask for advice before I end up with a blinking cursor.\n\nA: First, disk device filenames (/dev/sda, etc.) are subject to change. They can change because you physically move disks around, because you plug in additional disks (even external devices), because of changes in the way drivers load, because of changes in firmware settings, or even randomly (typically because two drivers may be competing to load first, and which one succeeds varies from boot to boot). Thus, don't get too attached to your device filenames or rely on them.\nSecond, your boot configuration is unclear and complex. Using the device identifiers in your Boot Info Script output:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda uses GPT and has an EFI System Partition (ESP), which in theory holds EFI boot loaders. I say \"in theory\" because the Boot Info Script didn't find any boot loader files on your ESP. OTOH, sometimes the Boot Info Script misses things, so they may be there. Also, efibootmgr found an entry for an Ubuntu GRUB in the firmware's NVRAM, so clearly at one point you had installed Ubuntu in EFI mode. It's not clear if that entry still works, but it does exist.\n\n*/dev/sdb uses MBR and has two NTFS volumes with Windows boot files. It therefore appears as if the computer is set up to boot Windows in BIOS mode. This would not get along too well with an EFI-mode Linux boot, although there are ways to get the two to coexist.\n\n*/dev/sdc uses MBR, but with a Windows Logical Disk Manager (LDM) configuration layered on top of that. You should NOT attempt to access your /dev/sdc* partitions directly in Ubuntu, much less install Ubuntu on that disk. If necessary, you may be able to access that disk via device files in the /dev/mapper directory. If you need to do more than that, you must convert from LDM to plain MBR partitions. You can do this with various third-party Windows partitioning tools. To make matters more twisted, you've got GRUB installed in the MBR of /dev/sdc.\n\n\nTwo ways to cut through this mess occur to me:\nMethod 1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Physically unplug /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc.\n\n*Boot an Ubuntu live CD or live USB.\n\n*Use GParted, parted, or gdisk to create a new BIOS Boot Partition on /dev/sda (your GPT disk).\n\n*Install GRUB to /dev/sda. In principle, you should be able to use Boot Repair to do this if you like. Note, however, that if you run Boot Repair in EFI mode, it may try to install the EFI version of GRUB, which you do not want. Check for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi to determine your boot mode; if it's present, you've booted in EFI mode and if it's absent you've booted in BIOS mode. If you're in the wrong mode, you'll need to reboot and select the right boot option in your firmware's boot manager or reconfigure the firmware to not support EFI-mode booting. (Details vary greatly from one machine to another, I'm afraid.)\n\n*Shut down the computer and re-attach the other two disks.\n\n*Boot to Linux using the GRUB you've just installed. (You may need to adjust the default boot order in your firmware.)\n\n*Run update-grub. This should cause it to detect your Windows installation and enable you to boot Windows from GRUB the next time you reboot.\n\n\nThis method has the advantage of keeping everything booting in a single mode (BIOS/CSM/legacy). That boot mode is better understood by the community as a whole than is EFI-mode booting. OTOH, you'll be messing with your disk and boot loader configuration with no guarantee that the changes will actually work, so you could end up making matters worse.\nMethod 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a USB flash drive with rEFInd.\n\n*Mount the USB flash drive and edit the EFI/BOOT/refind.conf file it contains: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is among the options. You might also need to uncomment the uefi_deep_legacy_scan option, although I recommend leaving that as-is for now and use it only if you can't boot Windows in a couple of steps.\n\n*If necessary, reconfigure your computer's firmware to enable EFI-mode booting. You may also need to disable a \"fast boot\" option. (It might already be set up this way.)\n\n*Boot to the rEFInd USB flash drive. With luck, it will show you options to boot Ubuntu and one to three more with gray diamond-shaped icons to boot in BIOS mode. One of those should boot Windows. Test to be sure you can boot both Ubuntu and Windows.\n\n*If all this works, install rEFInd to your hard disk by booting Linux via rEFInd (and not via one of the gray diamond legacy options) and installing the Debian package or PPA version noted on the downloads page. You'll need to edit /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf as you did earlier on the USB flash drive. If you've got too many options in rEFInd, you can use dont_scan_volumes or dont_scan_files to remove redundant options from the menu.\n\n\nThis approach has the advantage that you won't make any changes to your permanent configuration until you've fully tested it via the USB boot of rEFInd, so there's very little risk of making matters worse. It assumes that your computer is EFI-capable and that it provides a CSM, though. It also assumes that your Windows boot loader is intact on /dev/sdb. (Boot Info Script says it's there, but whether it works or not is another matter.)\n", "Q: How to mount UBIFS/MTD partitions? I have a lovely mount: unknown filesystem type 'ubifs' error with Ubuntu 14.04. What package provides this functionality? \nIt should be included in some previous versions of Ubuntu. The mtd-* packages are not helping.\n\nA: The command that you need to execute in order to get UBIFS support is\nmodprobe ubifs\n\nThis will load three kernel modules:\n\n*\n\n*mtd\n\n*ubi\n\n*ubifs\n\nThese modules should allow you to issue a mount command with -t ubifs after first doing a ubiattach -p /dev/XXX command for some device XXX that the kernel knows about.\nThe order of dependency of the modules is mtd, then ubi, then ubifs, so that to remove the modules you need to do:\nrmmod ubifs ubi mtd\n\nUBIFS is not simple to learn. This answer is just a start. Here is a more complete example.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

My question is how can I stop it from popping up?\n\n\nA: Your issue has nothing to do with the browser let alone Ubuntu. Even though some element may look like links, it is possible that it points to a bogus \"URL\". These elements can have a so-called event handler registered to them which can trigger on certain events, like clicking. Depending on the web application, it can then simply change the page URL or dispatch an AJAX request.\nExample HTML code with an inline Javascript event handler:\n<a href=\"javascript:\" onclick=\"alert('You have clicked me!');\">some link</a>\n\nUnless you write Javascript code yourself, you will not be able to trigger these actions by just clicking on it.\n", "Q: Can i edit a bash shell command?

Will I encounter lots of bugs? I have a newer, touchscreen laptop/tablet (a 2-in-1? but it doesn't come apart, it folds back and becomes a tablet), and I'd like the fullest support possible for my newer device. When trying to upgrade by computer to Ubuntu Gnome 14.10 from 14.04 recently, I noticed that the release notes state that Utopic is a devolopment release, not intended for use on production machines. However, I've yet to see a way to install either gnome 3.14, or 3.16 on 14.04. However, I can update the Gnome DE to version 3.14 on Utopic.

See more here\nAs for GNOME, Ubuntu sort of misses out on newer versions due to the timing of GNOME's release and Ubuntu's.

If you rename it to some other one or two character long name, that will also work fine--the problem only happens if its name is three or more characters in length. This may seem strange... so read on for details...\nWhen I run a copy of /bin/ip called eip, I get an error message with p (rather than ip) as the unknown object:\nObject \"p\" is unknown, try \"ip help\".\nI'm wondering if the same is happening to you? (Could there be a typo in your question?) Even if not, I strongly suspect the behavior on your machine is related to what I am seeing.\nI found that when I renamed ip to anything longer than two characters, it gave me an \"unknown object\" error about the rest of the characters:\nek@Io:~$ cp /bin/ip abc\nek@Io:~$ ./abc\nObject \"c\" is unknown, try \"ip help\".\nek@Io:~$ mv abc foobar\nek@Io:~$ ./foobar\nObject \"obar\" is unknown, try \"ip help\".\nek@Io:~$ mv foobar 12345\nek@Io:~$ ./12345\nObject \"345\" is unknown, try \"ip help\".\n\nman ip didn't seem to explain this odd behavior, but I did notice that the first non-option argument to ip is technically called an object:\nSYNOPSIS\n       ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }\n\n       ip [ -force ] -batch filename\n\n       OBJECT := { link | addr | addrlabel | route | rule | neigh | ntable |\n               tunnel | tuntap | maddr | mroute | mrule | monitor | xfrm |\n               netns | l2tp | tcp_metrics }\n\n....\nSo I tried changing the characters, after the first two, to these object names:\nek@Io:~$ mv 12345 12addr\nek@Io:~$ ./12addr\n1: lo:  mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default \n    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n....\nek@Io:~$ mv 12addr XXrule\nek@Io:~$ ./XXrule \n0:  from all lookup local \n32766:  from all lookup main \n32767:  from all lookup default\n\nek@Io:~$ mv XXrule ipl2tp\nek@Io:~$ ./ipl2tp \nUsage: ip l2tp add tunnel\n          remote ADDR local ADDR\n....\nSo it appears ip is designed to check the name with which it has been invoked, and if it contains more than two characters, to interpret the remaining characters as the name of the object on which to operate. Probably this is so that copies and symbolic links of ip with names like iplink, ipaddr, ipaddrlabel, and so forth, can act as if ip link, ip addr, ip addrlabel, and so on correspondingly were run.\nTo double check this, I took at look at the source code. The iproute2 package provides /bin/ip, so I searched for that and found it to be provided by the source package of the same name. (This is often but not always the case.) In the code tab, I selected a branch and browsed the code, entering the ip directory and examining ip.c.\nI looked in the main function, since that's where most C programs start running. This is the function that begins:\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n\nLike many programs' main functions, it consists largely of processing for command-line options. But below that, there's code to handle the various ways ip may be run, and one of them is for when its name is more than two characters long:\nif (strlen(basename) > 2)\n        return do_cmd(basename+2, argc, argv);\n\nCool! (Kinda weird--but cool.)\n\nThe simplest and best solution is probably just to keep your copy of ip called ip, or some other one- or two-character name. Giving it the same name as the copy of ip in /bin (and pointed to by the /sbin/ip symlink) should not be a problem--your script is already providing a path to the specific executable you wish to run.\nHowever, you might want it to be possible for users to invoke your copy of ip with a command like eip--for example, so they can have a separate command to put in directories in their PATH. This is commonly achieved with a symbolic link, but that will fail here for the same reason calling the copy eip failed in the first place:\nek@Io:~$ ln -s /bin/ip eip\nek@Io:~$ ./eip\nObject \"p\" is unknown, try \"ip help\".\n\n(I made a symbolic link to my system's /bin/ip, but the same happens when you symlink to a separate copy.)\nThe solution is to write a wrapper script (named eip, or whatever you like) that invokes ip, passing its arguments along. The script file can look like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n/path/to/your/ip \"$@\"\n", "Q: How to make the terminal prompt make sound every time i am prompted to write a command?

The options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-signed-generic-lts-utopic\n\n*linux-generic-lts-utopic\n\n*linux-virtual-lts-utopic\n\n*linux-signed-image-generic-lts-utopic\n\n*linux-image-extra-3.16.0-30-generic\n\n*linux-image-generic-lts-utopic\n\n*linux-image-virtual-lts-utopic\n\n*linux-signed-image-3.16.0-30-generic\n\n*linux-image-3.16.0-30-generic\nWhat is the difference between these kernels and which kernel is best with VMware?\n\nA: This partially depends on your use case.  the LTS versions are all Long Term Support and are meant for production installs.  Personally, I only use LTS versions so that I can ensure that there will be support for more than a few years.  \nIf you are just looking to test stuff out, I would go with the linux-virtual-lts-utopic kernel, but if you are looking to mimic a realworld server, I would go with the linux-generic-lts-utopic.\nUltimately the choice is yours though.\n\nA: By default, the servers will install the 'generic' kernel metapackages that point to the correct linux image for that release.\nTo that end, use the defaults that were installed with the server installation, as the disk is smart enough to determine which kernel you need.  (Unless you have a specialized use case, which is unlikely in a VMware setup)\nYou should also consider not asking broad questions such as this.\nThe lts-utopic kernel is just an update of the LInux kernel which includes the Utopic hardware enablement stack as well as some kernel updates.  You may wish to use this, but it is not required, as you are on VMware and don't necessarily need the updated HWE stack.\n\nA: It depends on what you are going to do with the image.\nIn general you are not going to notice a huge difference between the kernels in terms of performance.\nI would use either the virtual or the server kernel (assuming you are running a server). If you are running a desktop , generic would work as well .\nsee https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/Flavours\n", "Q: are there any brands of laptops that are not compatable with Ubuntu? I know we used to have lists of laptops that were able to be used for Ubuntu, and that HP and Lenova have supplied some Linux computers. However, the last HP computer I bought, and ENVY, did not allow me to load Ubuntu on it. So, since my old trusty Pavilion has now broken a hinge, I am looking for a new computer but there have been no updated lists that I know of. So, who knows which of the new laptops is good for Ubuntu and which ones to avoid? Since AMD chips sometimes have trouble, is there a good choice for the intel chips? Or does it matter? Has the newest versions of Ubuntu fixed the problems of the Microsoft lock for the computers?\n\nA: So there are a lot of questions here and I will try to answer most of them. Here I will be speaking mostly from experience with Ubuntu over the last couple of years.\nOfficially supported Ubuntu laptops\nCanonical keeps a list of laptops and desktops that have been thoroughly tested. If support is the most important thing to you, find something on this list. Personally, I think the list is a bit restricted. I have used a ton of hardware that isn't certified by Canonical and most of it has worked with no problems at all. That being said, I have wasted hundreds of dollars with hardware that I thought would work, and it didn't.\nThere isn't a specific manufacturer who has good or bad support for Linux, it all depends on the machine. You might notice that most certified machines are made by Dell and HP, but you could find great support from any manufacturer.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/\nSurprisingly I have found Amazon.com a very helpful source of information. You can look at the reviews for a lot of popular products and easily find out if it has Linux support. You will know quickly if something has poor Linux support by looking at the user reviews. If you see a lot of Linux users complaining about bad support, its probably not worth your time.\nQuick side note: System76 makes great (and expensive) Linux laptops.\nProcessor Support\nThis is pretty easy to answer, and I think a lot of people will agree with me on this one: Ubuntu can run equally well on AMD and Intel. A lot of people stick with AMD for building gaming machines because they are cheap, but Intel chips last longer and run cooler. If you're on a tight budget, go with AMD, but if you are willing to spend more money, go with Intel.\n\"Microsoft lock\"\nI'm not sure what you're referring to here, but here are a couple things off of the top of my head:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safe Boot\n\n*\n\n*This is just one of those things that Microsoft has enabled by default that doesn't add that much security anyway. It can be disabled in the BIOS pretty easily on most installs.\n\n\n*UFEI\n\n*\n\n*At first, Ubuntu had some trouble with installing in UFEI mode especially while dual booting windows and Ubuntu. The installer has gotten much better and this shouldn't be an issue anymore.\n\n\n*Manufacturer Locked BIOS\n\n*\n\n*There isn't much you can do here, fortunately this is not very common. P.S. users hate this 'feature' (cough cough Android).\n\n\n\nSummary\nGoogle is your friend. You can find information about Linux support for hardware on many different Linux forums. When in doubt, go with hardware that is certified by Canonical.\n\nA: Simple answer: NO\n\nSome newer models of laptop may have features that are yet supported. Moreover, some hardware features may be from an electronics manufacturer who does not (and will not) release documentation or source code to allow the device to work properly with open source and/or Linux.\nHowever, that is not specific or characteristic of any particular brand of laptop.\n", "Q: TechniSat SkyStar USB 2 How can I use TechniSat SkyStar USB 2 (external USB 2.0 satellite receiver for the reception of digital television and radio on a laptop or PC ) in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nPlease help me step by step.\nlsusb gives me this result:\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 13d0:2282 Techsan Electronics Co., Ltd.

From what I can see, you need to:\n\n*\n\n*Install the firmware package:\nsudo apt-get install linux-firmware linux-firmware-nonfree\n\nSince apparently, that is not enough, download the firmware and place it in /lib/firmware:\ncd /lib/firmware\nsudo wget http://kernellabs.com/firmware/technisat-usb2/dvb-usb-SkyStar_USB_HD_FW_v17_63.HEX.fw\n\nAdditionally you need to enable the responsible kernel module:\n\n\n*Until the end of the current boot\nsudo modprobe dvb-usb-technisat-usb2\n\n\n\n*For future boots\nprintf '# %s\\n%s\\n' 'TechniSat SkyStar USB 2' dvb-usb-technisat-usb2 | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/technisat-usb2.conf\n\nYou can use MythTV to interact with your DVB receiver.\n", "Q: Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and suspend error I just installed Ubuntu MATE 14.04 on my computer 6 days ago, but have experienced that when I put it in suspend, it still empties the battery in a short time (the battery was half full, 4 hours, and went out during the 7 hour long night).\nThis morning I got an error message, saying Ubuntu 14.04 had experienced an internal error. \nHere is the info from the error message:\nExecutablePath: /usr/share/apport/apportcheckresume\nPackage: linux-image-3.16.O33-generic3.16.O-33.44~14.04.1\nProblemtype: KernelOops\nTitle: suspend/resume failure\nAnnotation: This occured during a previous suspend and prevented it from resuming properly\nApportVersion: 2.14.1-Oubuntu3.8\nArchitecture: amd64\nInstallationMedia: UbuntuMate 14.04.2 \"Trusty Tahr\" - LTS amd64\nInterpreterPath: /usr/bin/python3.4\nPackageArcitecture: amd64\nProcCmdline: /user/bin/python3/usr/share/apport/apportcheckresume\nProcEnviron: TERM=linux, PATH=(custom, no user)\n\nSome more, but they have a lot of info, and I don't think they are necessary. \nI am pretty new with Ubuntu/Linux, but am trying to learn. I did some searching, but could only see others having trouble with the part of starting the computer again, while I think my problem is that it don't actually suspend or save the battery as it should. \nAny thoughts what it can be/what I should check or do?\n\nA: The best thing you can do is to upload the information so that the problem can be fixed. That's what it's there for. The gathered information can be used by the system to find similar reports, which helps developers identify the cause. This service also knows what pieces of information could potentially be privacy sensitive and anonymizes it before making it available. \nReporting bugs is how software is improved. It's like calling customer care when you have an issue. It is also a good contribution to Ubuntu, because your report might lead to the problem getting fixed before other users encounters the same bug. \n", "Q: Terminal emulator with no header bar I'm looking for a terminal emulator that lets me get the most out of my vertical space by getting rid of the header bar.

I'm running a play framework and a redis process on my ubuntu 2GB RAM VPS but last night the 2 processes suddenly crashed without any log (which is weird because they always write logs because crashing).\nThus, I am wondering if Ubuntu could be the cause of these crashes? The memory was very low. Could Ubuntu kill these processes to free the memory?\nIf yes, is there any log somewhere that I can read to check what Ubuntu did, why and when exactly?\nAlso, is there a way to disable these \"auto kill\" or tell ubuntu to kill other processes but not these 2 processes?\n\nA: It is not Ubuntu that does this. It is the Linux kernel that does this. Wikipedia has a topic on this: \n\nOut of memory (OOM) is an often undesired state of computer operation where no additional memory can be allocated for use by programs or the operating system. Such a system will be unable to load any additional programs, and since many programs may load additional data into memory during execution, these will cease to function correctly. This occurs because all available memory, including disk swap space, has been allocated.\n\nIn general there should be a notice in either /var/log/syslog (debian based systems) or /var/log/messages. A grep \"Killed process\" /var/log/syslog should show if the system killed a process. \nInteresting topics: \"How to discover what is killing a process?\" on stack and this article on lwn.net. \n\nThe project page for OOM has a lot of tips:\n\nWhat causes these OOM events?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The kernel is really out of memory. The workload used more memory than the system has RAM and swap space. What are SwapFree and MemFree in /proc/meminfo? If both are very low (less than 1% of their total), then the workload may be at fault. (unless mlock() or HugeTLB are involved, see below...)\n\n*The kernel is out of low memory on 32-bit architectures. What is LowFree in /proc/meminfo? If it is very low, but HighFree is much higher, then you have this condition. This workload may benefit from being run on a 64-bit platform or kernel.\n\n*There is a kernel data structure or memory leak. What are SwapFree and MemFree in /proc/meminfo? What is the number of task_struct objects in slabinfo? Was the system forking so many processes that it ran out of memory? What objects in /proc/slabinfo take up the most space? If one kind of object is taking up a vast portion of the system's total memory, that object may be responsible. Check with the subsystem experts for the area from which that object comes. To see the object usage, run this on the command-line:\nawk '{printf \"%5d MB %s\\n\", $3*$4/(1024*1024), $1}' < /proc/slabinfo | sort -n\n\n\n*The kernel is not using its swap space properly. If the application uses mlock() or HugeTLBfs pages, it may not be able to use its swap space for that application. If this happens, SwapFree may still have a very large value when the OOM occurs. These two features do not allow the system to swap the affected memory out, however, so overusing them may exhaust system memory and leave the system with no other recourse. It is also possible for the system to find itself in a sort of deadlock. Writing data out to disk may, itself, require allocating memory for various I/O data structures. If the system cannot find even that memory, the very functions used to create free memory will be hamstrung and the system will likely run out of memory. It is possible to do some minor tuning to start paging earlier, but if the system cannot write dirty pages out fast enough to free memory, one can only conclude that the workload is mis-sized for the installed memory and there is little to be done. Raising the value in /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes will cause the system to start reclaiming memory at an earlier time than it would have before. This makes it harder to get into these kinds of deadlocks. If you get these deadlocks, this is a good value to tune. If you run into a case where tuning this value helps, please report it. We may need to make changes to the default values.\n\n*The kernel has made a bad decision and mis-read its statistics. It went OOM while it still had plenty of good RAM to use.\n\n*Something really pathological is happening The kernel actually decides to go OOM after it has spend a \"significant\" amount of time scanning memory for something to free. As of 2.6.19, this \"significant amount\" happens after the VM has scanned an amount equal to all of the (currently) active+inactive pages in a zone six times. If the kernel is rapidly scanning pages, but your I/O devices (swap, filesystem, or network fs) are too slow, the kernel may judge that there is no progress being made and trigger an OOM even if there is swap free.\nRun this script during your test, and the OOM. Run the script, send the output to a VM expert. Have them parse it. Then come back and update this page. ;)\n", "Q: how to restore data after running rm?

I haven't tried this command on Ubuntu (for obvious reasons) so I am not sure if Ubuntu will allow its execution. But it's famous for deleting everything. Just out of curiosity, what happens when the kernel and /bin are deleted? How does rm maintain a run time stack? How does rm manage to communicate with the file system and complete deletion? How does it communicate with hardware? \n\nA: It doesn't matter that /bin/rm is deleted. It's only being run once and by that point it's all loaded in memory, as is everything else required to keep sending deletes to the filesystem and disk.\n\nSidebar/Update: Per David Hoelzer's answer (and mentioned in the comments), the inode the hardlink /bin/rm used to point to would remain right up until rm finished (because Linux holds in an open state) but that fact is irrelevant; the state of the disk doesn't matter at all.\nThe binary is loaded into memory before it is run. Even if you could manually destroy the rm disk data, it wouldn't affect or stop the deletion from completing (assuming you don't otherwise make the disk unavailable).\nNo idea what an inode or hardlink are? This is the answer where I worked it out.\n\nAnyway, this is also why you can delete the package for the current kernel without the computer imploding. As long as you install a different version, it'll be able to boot up. \nAgain, this works because rm is only called once. The following would fail after /bin/rm died because it calls it once for every filename:\nfind / -exec rm {} \\;\n\nThat said, find / -exec rm -rf {} + and find / -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf would also both likely fail because they both have argument limits, meaning they would only delete a number of files before being called again. At some point along the journey, /bin/rm could expire (and be released) before the rest of the files were deleted. It's not guaranteed though. If /bin/ were the last directory entered, these methods could work.\n\nA: \nI haven't tried this command on Ubuntu (for obvious reasons) so I am not sure if Ubuntu will allow its execution.\n\nI did. rm -rf / --no-preserve-root was running in a root session opened directly on the machine, while I was also connected through ssh from another machine, using the root account as well.\nWhat happens is that you start to get a lot of messages like:\n\nrm: cannot remove '/...': Operation not permitted\n\nor:\n\nrm: cannot remove '/...': Device or resource busy\n\n\nSurprisingly, ssh connection remained opened until the end of the operation. It's only when I closed the connection and tried to reopen it that a error appeared:\n\nRead from socket failed: Connection reset by peer\n\nOn the machine, four directories remain:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev. This is where device files are stored.\n\n*/proc—in-memory filesystem created by the kernel.\n\n*/run, a standardized file system location for daemons.\n\n*/sys. This allows you to get information about the system and its components.\n\n\nThis means that there is not much left, and not much to do there. You can't ls (although when using Tab, the names of directories and files are still displayed). You can cd in different directories, and also echo stuff, but commands such as cat are not available any longer.\nThere is no sudo either.\nshutdown -h now and reboot disappeared as well, so your only option seems to turn the machine down manually. Logout (exit) doesn't work, even if it shows a nice \"logout\" text.\nOnce you try to reboot the machine, you're presented with a nice GRUB error 15, and then, nothing happens, at which point you may start thinking that your rm might have done something bad to your system.\n\nYou can do it too\nNo, wait, don't do it on your machine!\nWhat you can do instead is to run a virtual machine. VMs have a benefit of making experimentation really easy. Since you are using Ubuntu, you may be interested by vmbuilder. This is a tool which allows you to deploy virtual machines in a matter of minutes (the official documentation claims that it can be done \"in about a minute\", but the actual time, even on fast hardware, is more about two-three minutes.\nOnce the deployment ends, you have an environment you can play with. If you end up destroying it, it doesn't matter: you deploy the machine again, and two minutes later you can continue.\nIf you use software such as VMWare, you may also be interested in snapshots (note that the free VMWare Player doesn't have this feature; you have to purchase VMware Workstation). Note that Hyper-V is free and supports snapshots (but you have to run Windows).\nThe benefit of snapshots is that you can take one in a matter of milliseconds. Rolling back to a snapshot takes longer, but is often a matter of seconds. This makes experimentation even easier and faster.\nThis experimentation is not limited to the operating system itself. You can do all sort of things involving software. Got a suspicious application? Test it in a VM—if it's a virus, it won't do any harm. Want to test an operation on a database, given that it might affect the environment? Test it in a VM.\nWhat if you did that on a real, non-test machine?\nBad things happen. Note that rm protects you from yourself: rm -rf / won't work: you need to use --no-preserve-root. Still, what if you actually achieved, by mistake, to remove everything?\nrm only unlinks files, but the data is still there, on your hard disk. This makes it possible to recover it later (which is why you shouldn't just throw away your hard disks with sensitive data when they are not working any longer).\nThis means that you just have to have a spare PC with a hard drive enclosure to actually recover nearly all the files. The important thing is to avoid writing anything to the hard disk to recover: the data you write will overwrite the unlinked files.\nAs noted by the article in 200_success's comment, if you act smart, you can get the machine back even without a spare PC. If you care just about data, I wouldn't bother—recovering it with a spare PC is much easier.\n\nA: The reason is that the file naming layer (what you see with ls) is really just for your convenience.  The file system driver and kernel care only what the inode is.  When a file is referenced by name, it is immediately translated into the inode which contains all of the metadata including the permissions, the data blocks on the disk, the owner ID, the group ID and the link count.\nThe link count is what really matters here.  When you delete a file on a UNIX system, the actual system call is an unlink.  What's happening under the hood is that the link count (the number of file names in the file naming layer) pointing at that inode is decremented.  The file system knows that a file is deleted when the link count reaches zero.\nWhen a file is deleted by rm it will also edit the directory file (yes, it's just a file that contains the file name and the inode in addition to a few other bits that are not important for this answer).  However, it is the unlinking that actually frees the disk resources.\nThis leads to some other interesting effects.  First, it is possible to have a file open whose link count is zero.  This happens when rm -rf / deletes the entry for /bin/rm.  The file is open (there is a file handle to it) but the inode is marked deleted (link count = 0).  The disk resources will not be released and reused until the file handle closes.\nAnother interesting effect is what happens when you have an inode with a link count greater than zero but nothing in the file naming layer that points to it.  This is, in a sense, a very well hidden file :).  To get access to it you would have to use something low level to reference it by inode number rather than by name (because there isn't one) or edit a directory entry to point at the inode using a hex editor.\nA third interesting effect is what happens if you reduce the link count to zero but point a directory entry at the inode anyway.  I'll leave that to you to experiment with if you'd like.  Clearly, though, these last two both lead to the file system being in an inconsistent state.\n\nA: Previous answers are good, but I want to clarify one detail:\nrm isn't just a command. It is a program that is found in PATH.\nTherefore what happens when you execute is following:\n\n\n*\n\n*you call (as root) rm -rf /\n\n*instance of program rm is loaded in memory with arguments -rf and /\n\n*based on these arguments program rm starts its operations (going through everything in mounted / partition and recursively removing references to it [sorry for technicality ;)])\n\n*once it is finished, the instance of rm program is unloaded\n\n*at this point the only things in memory are the programs that were loaded there previously (e.g. bash if you have terminal open in Ubuntu, Desktop environment, kernel, drivers etc)\n\n*if you try to call any another command (which in case of Linux makes it a standalone program), it will fail because there is no such program found in PATH locations (and PATH locations do not exist anymore). However everything once loaded will still run\n\n\nJust for the sake of understanding how it works  try installing LAMP on ubuntu (in Virtualbox), some script and PHP opcode cache, then call this evil command. Surprisingly (if you are lucky enough and your opcode cache won't notice php file deletion) you still can access php scripts from outside via apache webserver!\nPS: this evil command even ran as root wont delete everything, it cannot delete some kernel privileged processes from /proc and cannot delete some of stuff from /dev devices which appear on your system as as files. In fact, root is not as almighty as we think, kernel on the other hand is.\nPPS: Also as a second thought you also will still have files that were locked by another process at the time of deletion attempt.\n\nA: Once everything is wiped from the harddrives the kernel is still working but sort of stuck as there are no devices and programs, commands, etc. left.\nThe OS won't work anymore.\nAnd it's true what Oli says, the command gets loaded/executed into memory and nothing will stop it unless you kill this process (of course, if the kill command is still present ^^).\n\nA: Please be aware that if the system has selinux and selinux is in enforcing mode, and selinux's policies are set up properly; then nothing much will happen.\nSelinux is mandatory access control, which means, among many thing, that the root user really has not much more power to destroy the system than any other user on the system.\nSelinux is enforced in the kernel; you would have to compromise the kernel in order to get around it.\nOn a well designed system with good Selinux policies, root would not be able to do much on the system.\nThe later revisions of Android have Selinux enforcing just for this reason.\n", "Q: libudev.so.1 not found when trying to run spotify I am trying to run Spotify on Ubuntu 12.04.

To use it, you have to enable iBus as an input method.\nFirst, make sure iBus is installed on your system:\nsudo apt install ibus\n\nThen, go to your Language Support settings and choose \"iBus\" as the keyboard input method:\n\nLog out and log in again (or restart your system) for the changes to take effect.\nIf the shortcut is still not working, it could be that the shortcut is being overridden (used for something else) as Mohamed Ramzy Helmy suggested in a previous answer. In that case, you will have to go to your settings and disable the other keyboard shortcut\n\nA: In Ubuntu 22.04, the default hotkey Control + Shift +\nU can be disabled.\n\n*\n\n*Open dconf-editor, go to the path: /desktop/ibus/panel/emoji/Unicode-hotkey.\n\n\n*Remove the default value by set custom value to [].\n\n\nA: The key combination didn’t work because some other program used it.

Here the progress bar jitters a little bit and System Monitor shows a data rate that exceeds what my DSL connection is capable of.\nInternet connection is done through a commercial firewall device.\nIs such a behaviour normal, depending on a slow server?\nIf not, how can I diagnose this problem?\n\nA: No, what you're seeing is an artefact of variable connection speed: Ubuntu does a calculation of the ETA depending on the speed of the connection.  If the speed drops significantly (for a variety of reasons) it will \"jump back to the left\" and when the speed normalises again, it will \"jump back to the right\".\nYou should contact your ISP and have them monitor your line to see whether this is \"normal\" or not...\n\nA: The problem seems to be with the connection to the repositories and the calculated estimate time for package.

I am looking for a solution appropriate to this specific problem - which, at first glance, at least, looks as if a component of the amavis suite (perhaps clamd) is using the wrong umask value.  Of course, this fault may have arisen as a result of a number of bugs or configuration glitches.

Up until yesterday, everything was working swimmingly. At some point on 4/1/15, my right Shift key stopped working as a Shift key and I haven't been able to figure out why. I'm pretty sure that it is software, because in my various tests, I was able to swap the Left & Right Shift keys using xmodmap.\nWhat I'm looking to do is to have both Shift keys function as Shift.

This system has had trouble with overheating back when it ran windows, but only when doing certain activities, and never so soon. \nToday I came back and dusted the machine (admittedly I didn't inspect the cpu heatsink because I try not to mess with it if I can help it) and the flicker did happen, so I continued to use it for about 10 minutes to test it and the flicker came back worse than before. It's impossible to look at the screen almost. And it seems to be linked to actions performed, so it is at its worst when moving the mouse, clicking, a page is loading, etc.\nI installed psensor to see if I could find out what may be overheating as well, and I see that one of the temps (it doesn't say what it is, just \"temp1\") is running at just about constantly at 98-99C from startup. \nI really need an OS and I'm sort of at a loss as to what to do next, so any help is appreciated.\n\nA: I has a similar problem.

first tab on Firefox is in that language. So that is really my question, why do I get this strange language as my startup page and what do these error messages mean?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.10\nRelease:    14.10\n\nPackage Information:\nfirefox:\n  Installed: 37.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.10.1\n  Candidate: 37.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.10.1\n  Version table:\n *** 37.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.10.1 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ utopic-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ utopic-security/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     33.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.10.1 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ utopic/main amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: You normally end up at a multi language web page when starting Firefox, and the language used depends on the browser's language preference settings. Go to  Edit -> Preferences -> Content and click the Choose... button to change it.\n", "Q: Documentviewer as standard After installing Gimp, all PDF files are opened with Gimp instead of Documentviewer (as they used to be). How to change that in Preferences?? I can find the program.\n\nA: You should be able to do this by right-clicking a pdf document, selecting properties in the menu, then open with. In that list, you should find Documentviewer. \n", "Q: Web Publishing using Apache2 I recently installed apache2 in my laptop to host a website. I tried creating a html page and published it. But when I type the link on the browser it tells me the website dosen,t exist. Can someone suggest a solution.\n\nA: First, make sure you put your files into \"/var/www/html/\" or \"/var/www\" (depending on how you have Apache set up) if you are connecting over a local network make sure you are using the local IP address of the computer and not your public IP. To get the local IP of the computer type in \"ifconfig\" and it should be like 192.168.1.6 or something. If you are connecting over the internet make sure you properly port forwarded port 80 and are using your public IP, not your local IP. If you can reach the website locally but not over different networks, and you port forwarded port 80, then your ISP might have blocked port 80. Basically, if you are connecting to a PC in the same house, try using the local IP.\n", "Q: FF 37 Ntlm not working I am using 14.10 \nI just upgraded my FF from 33 to 37.  I have a timecard system at work that uses NTLMv1\nI have set network.negotiate-auth.allow-insecure-ntlm-v1 to true\nI get the Authentication Required pop up box, but it will not accept my name/password\nThis was working fine in FF 33.  I dusted off my old Windoze box, and it works fine.\nAnyone else having problems with this?\nAny Ideas what to do?\nThank You,\nMichael\n\nA: I've set listed parameters to True and now auth works.\nnetwork.auth.force-generic-ntlm\nnetwork.auth.force-generic-ntlm-v1\nnetwork.automatic-ntlm-auth.allow-non-fqdn\n\n\nA: Enter your URL as value of preference: network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris.\nIt worked for me on FF 37 Ubuntu 14.10. I guess that a comma separated list may be entered too.\n\nA: I have set only network.auth.force-generic-ntlm-v1 to true and now NTLMv1 authentication works on sites and proxie.\nI think, this occurs, because parameter network.negotiate-auth.allow-insecure-ntlm-v1 was renamed to network.auth.force-generic-ntlm-v1 (bugzilla)\n", "Q: Problem booting Ubuntu 14.10 I recently tried to install the latest version of Ubuntu on my computer, substituting Windows 7. The installation ran smoothly, but now when I try to boot the system I receive this error message:\nreboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press a key\n\nThe only thing I can do is run the live version via USB, which is what I am doing right now. I looked for a solution in some forums and I decided to run boot-info and post the result of the diagnosis here.\n\nA: You have no bootloader installed on /dev/sda. The bootloader may have been installed on the EFI partition on /dev/sda1 but this partition seems to be not active.\nYou could try to set the partition active using the cfdisk command in a terminal window.\nHint: as the poster of this question pointed out, one must use parted / gparted to edit GPT partitions.\nAttention: it turns out in the comments that this answer was completely misleading.\nIf you however need some information about installing Ubuntu on an UEFI enabled system, you may read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 Very slow boot I installed ubuntu 14.10 and it boots slow.\nI searched the web and found some research about checking the dmesg, i did so and i found out there was some problems with my Bluetooth and i solved that.\nBut as you

XAMPP has php-cli already installed so there is no need to install php-cli via apt-get.\nThe reason for the above problem is, as PHP is installed as a bundle along with XAMPP, the OS doesn't know it is there. So for this we should add the XAMPP php to environment variables.

What I attempted to do get it to work is using the command line because the GNU GRUB does not have an option to boot from CD or USB, correct?\nSo, from the command line I enter the following I borrowed from the standard loader script:\nInsmod chain\nInsmod gzio\nInsmod ext2\nInsmod part_gpt\nSet root ='hd0,gpt1'\n\nThen I run a 'find' command to verify that my USB device is the one set to root, and it appears that it did successfully.

Yesterday I was using Bleach Bit as root to wipe free space. When I woke up Bleach Bit was not Responding and the terminal hangs on \"suffix length = 235\". So I force Bleach Bit to stop. After reboot I have noticed that there is 4GB folder at my home directory.\nWhen I'm trying to remove it with\nsudo rm -rf 'iJ5soqs a3'\n\nTerminal hangs, same issue when I'm trying to open it or using file browser instead of terminal or in recovery mode.\nIs there anyway to get rid of this folder.\n@Andrew:\nYou are right, I was using 1.0 version of Bleach Bit. However I could bet that I'm deleting this folder incorrectly because simply nothing happens, as I said terminal hangs on removing. df -i command shows no change. In task manager I can see that terminal uses very little memory and no CPU. Command have been running for about 4 hours and still nothing happens.\nEdit2:\nAfter 5 hours it finally gets deleted I must admit that I'm pleasantly surprised.\n\nA: I am guessing you are using a version of BleachBit older than version 1.2, right?  If so, there are maybe a million empty files in this folder. \nYou are deleting this folder correctly, you just need to wait much longer because deleting files is slow on Linux.\nYou can watch the progress using the command df -i, which shows inodes usage.\nBleachBit 1.2, release a year ago, prevents this problem, but Ubuntu does not update BleachBit except with updates of Ubuntu. (For example, Ubuntu 14.04 will update to BleachBit 1.6, but Ubuntu 13.10 will never have BleachBit 1.6.) You can download the latest version (1.6) from BleachBit.sourceforge.net.\n", "Q: Creating a virtual video device, processing signal and redirecting it to physical output on Ubuntu 14.04 In Ubuntu 14.4, I need to apply some video processing to the whole screen for a project I'm working on.

Everything seemed to work without error until it restarted. When the computer fired back up, I was greeted with the following message in what was basically a full-screen terminal (which I copied by hand):\nmount: mounting /dev/loop0 on /root failed: Invalid argument\nmount: mounting /dev on /root/dev failed: No such file or directory\nmount: mounting /sys on /root/sys failed: No such file or directory\nmount: mounting /proc on /root/proc failed: No such file or directory\nTarget filesystem doesn't have requested /sbin/init.\nNo init found.

Is this recoverable, or should I scrap everything and do a fresh install? In case it matters, I installed Ubuntu about a year ago as a dual boot with Windows 7 via the wubi installer. I also just read that wubi is being discontinued as of 13.04, so perhaps this was part of the problem.\nEDIT I've found a possible solution here, I'm going to give it a shot. In the meantime, other suggestions as backup if this doesn't work are welcome.\n\nA: I am no expert, but if you used Wubi, I think your Ubuntu might have been running as a Windows program. Do you remember how you installed Ubuntu the first time? There are some simple commands to fix the Windows boot if you have a Windows recovery disk. Here is the Microsoft page that explains bootrec.\nI have used it before and it worked quite well. If you get Windows running again, you might want to use system restore if you have a recently saved restore point. I don't know if you can upgrade an installation of Ubuntu that runs under Windows. I would remove Ubuntu from Windows using Windows' install/remove programs and then do a fresh dual boot installation or use the later version of Ubuntu to do a new side by side installation if you can save all your documents before you delete Ubuntu.\n\nA: I found a solution on another question that didn't want to show up as a possible duplicate when I was writing my question. Note that I cannot guarantee that this is a safe solution, but it should work if you've installed Ubuntu as a dual boot with Windows and have the same message as I had above when you try to boot. I've summarized the answer at the link here:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you turn on your computer, select to boot Ubuntu, and hold down Shift to run Grub, the boot loader for Ubuntu.\n\n*Press E to display the commands that Grub uses to boot Ubuntu.\n\n*Look through these commands to find where it says ro quiet splash and change this to rw quiet splash.\n\n*Press the boot key (it says what you can use at the bottom of the screen; my options were F10 or Ctrl+X).\n\n*Now Ubuntu should boot properly, but the settings that we changed haven't stuck yet. You'll need to run sudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub (or you can use whatever text editor you prefer) to change the default boot settings.\n\n*Find the line which reads GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" and add rw to the parameter so that it's the same as what we used to boot.\n\n*Save the file and exit the editor.\n\n*Run sudo update-grub to generate a new grub config file.\nNow, if you reboot Ubuntu, you should find that it works as expected.\n", "Q: Indentation lost in Libreoffice after hitting enter I teach and create my teaching plan in outline format.

If this is not what you expect please don't hesitate to drop a comment and I am going to change/delete this answer based on the best for you.\nThe Ingredients:\n\n*\n\n*The latest LibreOffice version you can afford.\n\n*Patience\n\n*A drink and some donuts.\n\nPreparation\nFirst of all we should have in consideration that the proper key accelerators for bullets and numbers are Shift F12 and F12 respectively. So the first thing we should do in order to create a bullet list is to hit the Shift F12 in order to start a bullets list as shown in the next screenshot.\n\nPlease notice I haven't added any text yet. That's just because of I am going to perform certain other tasks previous to start typing my list, but you can -indeed- do it on an already made list. The process should result in the same.\nNow, I am going to click the \"Format\" menu and choose the \"Bullets and Numbering...\" option.\n\nNow, I am going to choose from the ready-made presets, or -as in your case- if I need a different kind of bulleting, I am going to hit the \"Options\" tab in the \"Bullets and Numbering\" window, in which I am going to define every options I wish for the main and subsequent bullet levels, see the screenshot.\n\nNow, in the \"Character style\" dropdown I am going to choose \"Source Text\", after which I am going to hit the ... button in order to set the text that it's going to be used.\nA window will be presented with the fonts and text elements that we can use for such purpose. In this example I am going to use the \"Ubuntu Font\" with the \"General punctuation\" Subset (Default) and by choosing the upper left's character I am going to instruct the \"Bullets and Numbers\" to use such element as shown in the next screenshot.\n\nNow, let's hit Ok on the opened windows, after which the solid rounded bullet will transform in a kind of long dash, in which I can start writing the text. See the screenshot.\n\nNow, in the next screenshot we see a bullet list with two levels using the same bullet.\n\nLet's say I wish to use a plus sign + for the second level of the list. What I should do is exactly the same steps as for level 1, but this time let's choose \"Level 2\" and give it the + sign. After which I am going to right click the sub level item and chose the \"Down one level\" option in order to make it use the + sign.\n\nBut! The sub level should be nested inside the previous level, so let's hit the \"Increase indent\" button from the format bar in order to do so.\n\nAnd we can go further with the same steps for any deepest levels you need to give certain format.\nServing\nOh! Yes, I hope you enjoyed your donuts and your favorite drink when reading this.\nSo, don't forget to serve an additional portion of donuts and hot drink for the conversation.\nGood luck!\n\nA: This isn't a bug, it's a feature :-) - but a nice one, you can disable it. It's among the AutoCorrect Options that are enabled by default in LO Writer.\nTo keep a tab at the very beginning of a line (disable AutoCorrect rule):\n\n\n*\n\n*Menu Tools ->  AutoCorrect Options...\n\n*Select Options tab;\n\n*In the AutoCorrect Dialogue, disable the seventh option:\n\nYou can also map the Increase Indent / Decrease Indent functions to shortcuts. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Menu Tools -> Customize...\n\n*Select Keyboard tab;\n\n*In Functions -> Category, select Format;\n\n*In Function -> Function, select Increase Indent;\n\n*In Shortcut Keys, select your desired shortcut (e.g. CTRL+N for Increase iNdent and ALT+N for Decrease iNdent):\n\n", "Q: Wifi keeps dropping connection I am running Ubuntu 14.04 on a Thinkpad X230 with Intel Centrino Advended-N 6205 wifi. On my home network everything is fine, but at work the connection keeps dropping after a minute of being connected. Any ideas?\nThanks,\nAzalus\n\nA: If your work uses PEAP and whatnot for wifi authentication there are several issues with it on ubuntu and other distros.  I have had moderate success by connecting to a hidden network with the corporate network's name rather than clicking on it and connecting to it.  I am still prompted for a password every time I get to work though.  You can troubleshoot most of these issues by editing the connection file in :\n/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ \n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Juju - no matching node available I am using ubuntu server 14.04.2 and running juju environment as MaaS, have 1 node only as the bootstrapped node.\nBefore bootstrap I did juju sync-tools and then juju bootstrap.\nAfter the bootstrap I did 2x juju add-machine and then juju status, got this:\n\nHow do I solve this? \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You have one node.  One node is allocated for juju-gui.  You are asking for 2 more nodes.  \nYou only have one node, and it is in use, so you have no matching nodes available.  \nIf you are using VMs, you need to build two more.  \nIf you are using hardware, you need to buy more.\n", "Q: Run FORTRAN *.exe from Ubuntu terminal I am trying to run a FORTRAN program in Ubuntu. Code has been compiled and the result is that I have the following 2 files:\nsfsptest2.exe\nyyVx6634XC.INP\n\nThese files are located in: /home/user_test/FileList\nAt the Ubuntu command line, I enter:\ncd FileList/\n./sfsptest2.exe yyVx6634XC.INP\n\nI get\nbash: ./sfsptest2.exe: Permission denied\n\nIf I use:\ngfortran sfsptest2.exe yyVx6634XC.INP\n\nI get this error message:\n/usr/bin/ld:yyVx6634XC.INP: file format not recognized: treating like linker script\n/usr/bin/ld:yyVx6634XC.INP:1: syntax error\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nIs there a way to run this FORTRAN .exe file from the terminal in Ubuntu?\nEDIT:\nThe *.exe file was produced in Windows with a FORTRAN 95 compiler.\n\nA: It is important to understand the following:\nYour .exe program is not a FORTRAN program, it's a Windows executable, and nor Bash nor a FORTRAN compiler will understand it.\nWhen I say that it's not a FORTRAN program I really mean it.\nIt might have been a FORTRAN listing on some engineer's computer, but once compiled, it is indistinguishable(*) from a Windows executable built in BASIC, Pascal or C++.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler\nSo the way to go here is to load it in a Windows emulator - Wine, for example:\n$ wine yourprogram.exe\nOf course you can also run it in a Windows virtual machine using VirtualBox or the virtualization environment of your choice.\nIf you can get the FORTRAN sources (and it's not overly complex or dependent on specific libraries) you might want to try to compile it under Linux.\n(*) This is not entirely correct, but that's the gist of it unless you want to delve into the topics of reverse engineering and decompilation :) \n\nA: Your program was compiled for Windows, it won't run on Linux. Compiling is basically a way of translating the programming language that a program was written in (so, something a human understands) into a language that a computer understands. What you have here is a program that has been translated from Chinese to French (Windows) and you are trying to read it in English (Linux). That won't work. \nYou will either need to recompile on Linux or attempt to run it via Wine. \n", "Q: Wireless card does not detect any wireless networks Its a Dell Latitude E6400, dual bot windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04.

The phone is shipped with the languages with highest translation coverage. I'm not sure, but I think it means that Breton will soon be added via updates.\nIf you want you can post a message about it to the ubuntu-translators mailing list.\n", "Q: Using \"while read...\" in a linux script Could somebody please explain how the following code works?\necho '1 2 3 4 5 6' | while read a b c\ndo\n  echo $c $b $a\ndone\n\nSpecifically, I'd like to know why the output of this loop is 3 4 5 6 2 1, instead of 3 2 1 and 6 5 4 on two separate lines? I can't seem to wrap my mind around it...\n\nA: read reads a whole line from standard input, splits the line into fields and assigns this fields to the given variables. If there are more pieces than variables, the remaining pieces are assigned to the last variable.\nIn your case $a is assigned 1, $b is assigned 2 and $c the remaining 3 4 5 6.\n\nA: Rewriting the loop this way reveals what is happening:\necho '1 2 3 4 5 6' | while read a b c\n  do\n    echo '(iteration beginning)' a=\"$a\" b=\"$b\" c=\"$c\" '(iteration ending)'\n  done\n\nThis gives, as its output:\n(iteration beginning) a=1 b=2 c=3 4 5 6 (iteration ending)\n\nNotice first that only a single echo command is run. If it were run more than once, you would, among other things, see the (iteration beginning) and (iteration ending) substrings printed more than once.\nThis is to say that having a while loop here is not really accomplishing anything. The read builtin reads whitespace-separated text1 into each specified variable. Extra input gets appended to the end of the last variable specified.2 Thus variables a and b take on the values 1 and 2 respectively, while c takes on the value 3 4 5 6.\nWhen the loop condition (while read a b c) is evaluated the second time, there's no more input available from the pipe (we only piped it a single line of text), so the read command evaluates to false instead of true and the loop stops (before ever executing the body a second time).\n1: To be technical and specific, the read builtin, when passed variable names as arguments, reads input, splitting it into separate \"words\" when it encounters IFS whitespace (see also this question and this article).\n2: read's behavior of jamming any extra fields of input into the last variable specified is nonintuitive to many scripters, at first. It becomes easier to understand when you consider that, as Florian Diesch's answer says, read will always (try to) read a whole line--and that read is intended to be usable both with and without a loop.\n", "Q: Asus AC55 (AC-1300) WiFi Adapter I am having trouble finding any drivers for the Asus AC55r WiFi Adapter. It is using AC-1300 Wireless and the USB ID is 0b05:17eb.\n\nA: This question is the only meaningful mention I can find about this usb.id 0b05:17eb. I am unable to find any Linux driver for the device. We might then consider ndiswrapper, the package that uses Windows XP driver files.

However, i have heard various problems with its use in Linux, so i have a few questions. Firstly, do i have to use the elgato software to start a recording on the ps4? (which i am sure will not work with ubuntu)  And,if this is not the case, will i be able to access these files once i connect it to my laptop? Like an external storage device? And,lastly, (if i can make it this far.) Will the files on the device be able to be moved over to my hard drive to edit them with Avidemux, Pitivi, Openshot, etc? Thanks in advance! and have a nice day!\n\nA: An experimental Linux driver for the Elgato Game Capture HD has been developed since you asked your question. For more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Driver webpage on GitHub\n\n*Detailed, text-based tutorial for Ubuntu\n\n*A video tutorial using Arch Linux may be found on Youtube\n", "Q: Had to upgrade Postgres on Ubuntu; now, how to access old, missing databases? My local connection on my Ubuntu server (14.04) wasn't working to my Postgres (9.3) database, so I tried upgrading it to 9.4 to solve the connection issues. Luckily I can now connect to the database, but... My old databases (and tables, views, etc.) are now missing...\nIs it possible to recover these? How would I go about doing that?\n\nA: Unless you've removed the old 9.3 cluster there should be 2 clusters running:\n$ service postgresql status\n9.3/main (port 5432): online\n9.4/main (port 5433): online\n\n(or use pg_lsclusters to display existing PostgreSQL clusters).\nPostgresSQL commands accepts -p argument to distinguish which DB cluster you're using (it accepts also Unix socket path). You can export old data using (assuming that the old DB runs on port 5432):\nsu - postgres\npg_dump -p 5432 my_db -f my_db.dump\n# import data into new DB cluster\npg_restore -p 5433 -d my_db my_db.dump\n\n\nA: Unless you have a backup dump lying around, the safest way to do this is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*uninstall Postgres 9.4, \n\n*install 9.3, \n\n*backup the database using pg_dumpall > backup.sql, \n\n*uninstall Postgres 9.3,\n\n*install Postgres 9.4,\n\n*restore the databases using psql -d postgres -f backup.sql.\n\n\nThe 9.3 databases are in a different format than what 9.4 expects and there is no easy way to convert them using 9.4 tools only.\n", "Q: Can't add intermediate cert to ca-certificates.crt via /usr/local/share/ca-certificates On Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS, I'm attempting to add an intermediate cert to the system's store of trusted CA certs. I installed the .crt file in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates, then ran update-ca-certificates. The symlink was created from /etc/ssl/certs to the .crt. However, the cert was not included into /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.\nMan page for update-ca-certificates says:\n\nupdate-ca-certificates  is  a  program  that  updates   the   directory\n  /etc/ssl/certs to hold SSL certificates and generates certificates.crt,\n  a concatenated single-file list of certificates.\nIt reads the file /etc/ca-certificates.conf. Each line gives a pathname\n  of  a  CA  certificate  under /usr/share/ca-certificates that should be\n  trusted.  Lines that begin with \"#\" are comment lines and thus ignored.\n  Lines  that  begin with \"!\" are deselected, causing the deactivation of\n  the CA certificate in question.\nFurthermore   all   certificates   found   below   /usr/local/share/ca-\n  certificates are also included as implicitly trusted.\n\nI was able to get the cert into ca-certificates.crt by editing the /etc/ca-certificates.conf file and giving the path to the cert, then running update-ca-certificates.  So my question is: is the man page wrong and does the /usr/local/share/ca-certificates method not work?  Or did I miss a trick?\nThanks!\n\nA: Works for me. Did you install the certificate in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates with suffix .crt? This is the part in the update-ca-certificates script, which adds certs from LOCALCERTSDIR:\nif [ -d \"$LOCALCERTSDIR\" ]\nthen\n  find -L \"$LOCALCERTSDIR\" -type f -name '*.crt' | sort | while read crt\n  do\n    add \"$crt\"\n  done\nfi\n\nYou might want to check if LOCALCERTSDIR is set to the /usr/local/share/ca-certificates directory. After running update-ca-certificates I got a link from /etc/ssl/certs/xyz.pem to $LOCALCERTSDIR/xyz.crt and its content has been added to the /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK fails to SSH to BQ Ubuntu Phone I'm using the Ubuntu SDK/QT Creator and trying to deploy an HTML5 application to my Ubuntu Phone. QT Creator can see the device correctly and I can SSH into the phone manually from the command line. When I try to publish the application to the phone it gives an error saying the connection is refused.\nThe log on the Devices tab shows that QT Creator is talking to the phone correctly via SSH. However, the logs say that port forwarding is being used and replacing port 22 with 10000. When I look at the Device tab of the Options window the settings for the Ubuntu device are locked to SSHing on port 10000 (i.e. the option to change it is greyed out). Pressing the button to test the connection fails with a connection refused error).\nI've tried adding a new device on the Devices tab of the Options window and using port 22 and the test passes. However, I'm only able to add new devices of type 'generic linux device' and not an Ubuntu device. This means that I can't use it as a kit to publish applications with because the Click package creation stuff is only available for Ubuntu device kits.\nLong story short, how do I get the phone to accept connections on port 10000 or how can I change the settings of QT Creator.\nThanks\n\nA: I had a similar problem and fixed it by modifying \n/home/[user]/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/devices.xml.\noriginal:\n<value type=\"QString\" key=\"Host\">[10.0.1.9]:24</value>\n<value type=\"int\" key=\"SshPort\">10000</value>\n\nmodified:\n<value type=\"QString\" key=\"Host\">[10.0.1.9]</value>\n<value type=\"int\" key=\"SshPort\">22</value>\n\nAt first I fixed this problem by modifying sshd_config on the device and adding port 10000, but that stopped working.

The 64 bit version won't work on your 32 bit system.\nIf you need the 64 bit version, I can't help you with that - someone else might chime in with a virtual solution, but I have no experience in that area.\n\nA: If your system is only 32 bit (32 bit processor) then you can't install 64 bit OS on that. You need 64 bit hardware to install 64 bit OS or applications. You can try use qemu virtualisation solution to run 64 bit OS on 32 bit processor.

After expansion,\n     AuthorizedKeysFile is taken to be an absolute path or one\n     relative to the user's home directory.  Multiple files may be\n     listed, separated by whitespace.  The default is\n     “.ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2”.\n\nI would suggest a setting of:\nAuthorizedKeysFile /some/path/%u/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2\n\nThis should allow a fallback to the default locations, and allow you to use separate files for different users.\n", "Q: Mouse flickering on one monitor I've done quite a bit of googling to find a solution to this but couldn't find anything.

This actually all ties back to the problem I was trying to solve that started the whole mess because the server takes connections from it's host fine but refuses the other laptop.

We are working to release this update at the earliest possible time, sorry for the inconvenience.\nA list of these fixes is at https://bugs.launchpad.net/canonical-devices-products/+bugs?field.tag=battery&field.status%3Alist=FIXRELEASED\n\nA: Personally I use it every day basically for seeing my mails, twitter, the news and some calls/sms, and with the wifi on at home or the 3G outside and the position off, my battery lasts for 24-36h.\nIt's like full in the morning and about 40-50% left at night\n\nA: I have similar \"features\", my battery lasts about 24 hrs with normal use and it is really not influenced by the screen as much as it is by the wi-fi and 3G antenna.\nThis obviously means that during a 8hr sleep it goes down by about 30% (8 hours is about 1/3 of a day, 24 hours ;) ) if I do not switch off wi-fi and 3G.\nI have experienced that the wi-fi is the thing that uses the most battery. Try turning it off when you don't use it; this will save a lot of power.\nAnd, if you can, remember to switch to 2G whenever you don't need 3G.\n\nA: I have been using mine for a while now.\nAfter 2 days of use It usually still has about 20-5% battery left.\nMy usage pattern:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hook it up to the charger before I go to sleep (I turn of the wifi at night).\n\n*Turn on the wifi in the morning.\n\n*Use it normally during the day - 3-4 calls/day, wifi off if I'm on the PC, wifi on during other times. Bluetooth is on during commute time (a little less than 1h/day)\n\n*Turn of wifi while I sleep\n\n*Same cylce next day - but at the second night I have to charge it again.\n\n\nNotes:\nI normally do some browsing on the phone during the day, but it's mostly email, hangups via terminal and a few scopes.\n\nA: My Ubuntu phone has good days and bad days. Often areas of poor reception and losing signal+finding new networks drains the battery, which is probably why it drains quicker in the countryside and underground.\nI find turning off services like location and GPS can help, and wifi is a massive drain.\nI know the next RTM release is going to bring some improvements to battery life, should be out in the coming weeks.\n\nA: My battery sucks hairy ones, and it appears to be getting worse. Last night I charged it around evening time, I made sure to do all my downloads + browsing while charging so as not to overwork when off charger. It is now at 20% and says \"last full charge 14 hours\", I always have GPS off & usually before bed I make sure to close all apps, but left habitRPG on last night, perhaps this is why it is so bad today...\nI like this phone, but there are a few frustrating issues, I am hoping the positives will out weigh the negatives.\nIs there any battery saving app about that will help save power? I had one on my android that I could set up schedules: Wifi, bluetooth, GPS off at night and back on in morning. A scope or app that tells you where power is going would be good, with option to close power drainers. \n", "Q: Check for redundancy before downloading any file Is there a way you can check whether you have already downloaded a file previously or not before actually downloading it.\nI know -\n\n\n*\n\n*wget can do that, only if the filename of the file trying to be fetched is same as compared to the file already retrieved before.\n\n*You can apply checksum or md5hash for finding & removing redundant files, but this can be done only AFTER you have downloaded the file.\n\n\nPlease suggest a way to check whether a file is same in terms of content before actually downloading it FULLY again (independent of the filename its gonna save into).\nTo make it more precise: I am interested in downloading ONLY mp3 files but from different sources like Jamendo, Soundcloud etc. which may have same content(song) but will be having different filenames.   \n\nA: Read the first 500 bytes of the first file:\nhead -c 500 file1.mp3 > fragment1\nUse curl -r 0-499 -o fragment2 http://... to retrieve the first 500 bytes of the second file. Then, do diff fragment1 fragment2 to see if they are equal.\ncurl is a tool like wget only with more options. The -r flag lets you specify a range, which will result in a partial download. wget has a quota option that will not, however, let you do a partial download.\n\nA: Based on Jos' answer, here's a bash script that will compare the two files from byte <file_size>-628 to byte <file_size>-129 (latest 500 Bytes before ID3v1 and ID3v1.1 tags), excluding ID3v1 and ID3v1.1 tags from the comparison. Copy the script's code and paste it into a text file named script.sh (or whatever) and in a Terminal run chmod a+x <script_path> to mark it as executable:\n(Note: the script only works if curl is able to determine the file size)\n\nUsage: <script_path>/script.sh <file_path> <url>\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsize1=$(du -b \"$1\" | sed 's/\\(.*\\)\\t/\\1/' | tr -cd '[[:digit:]]')\nsize2=$(curl -I \"$2\" | grep -i 'content-length' | tr -cd '[[:digit:]]')\ndd if=\"$1\" of=partial1 bs=1 skip=$(($size1 - 628)) count=500\ncurl -r $(($size2 - 628))-$(($size2 - 129)) -o partial2 \"$2\"\ncmp partial1 partial2\nrm partial1 partial2\n\n", "Q: How to fix USB flash on Ubuntu? I tried to create a PC-BSD start up/install on my usb flash drive using dd to try dual booting with it, and now I am left with a USB with only 1GB available instead of 16GB.  The command I used was:\ndd if=PCBSD10.1.1-RELEASE-01-31-2015-x64-DVD-USB.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M\n\nI was advised on their forums to use bs=1M on linux instead of bs=1m in the PC-BSD manual.\nGparted only sees 1Gb now and there seems to be no way to re-format.

I'll go into deep details so you can understand what's going on exactly.\nI've been using Ubuntu and I wanted to experience different distros. On my PC, it wasn't dual-booted, I had only Ubuntu and nothing else. I just had one primary partition which was Ubuntu. There was no exteneded partitions whatsoever. Just to clarify: One partition exist which is primary. I tried to create new primary partition so I could install other distro over Ubuntu partition and Windows 8 to second primary partition that I just created.\nAt first, it didn't let me create new one which ıs I believe because of all the space was used by the first and only partition. So i deleted it. There was no partitions left. I created 2 new ones. It said changes will apply after reboot. I rebooted and what i got was grub-rescue screen. I actually was expecting Ubuntu to open but as I thought again, it didn't make sense because i deleted it and created 2 new partitions which were empty. (This part is my opinion, I am not sure if it is the reason.)\nOn grub-rescue screen, I got this this:\nerror: attempt to read or write outside of partition.\nEntering rescue mode...\ngrub rescue> _\n\nI tried everything on the web so please don't type this solution because it doesn't work.\ngrub rescue > ls\n(hd0) (hd0, msdos9)\ngrub rescue > ls (hd0,msdos9)\ngrub rescue > ls (hd0,msdos8)\ngrub rescue > ls (hd0,msdos5) # suppose this is linux\ngrub rescue > ls (hd0,msdos5)\ngrub rescue > set root=(hd0,msdos5)\ngrub rescue > set prefix=(hd0,msdos5)/boot/grub\ngrub rescue > insmod normal\ngrub rescue > normal\n\nWhen i type insmod normal it says \"error: no such partition\".\nI don't actually want to rescue Ubuntu as you know, so if i can delete both partitions from grub rescue screen, I believe I can install other distro. When there is no partition, it possibly creates its own partition. Then I try to create second primary partition and again I get the grub rescue error and so on and on. (just kidding)\nExtra information : I created partitions to have equal space which are both around 250 gb.\nAny help is very very very appreciated. I had been trying to fix it all day long yesterday and I got sick today because of stress.\n\nA: If what you say is correct - you deleted your only partition and created two new ones - you have left yourself with no operating system. Try installing an OS from scratch.\n\nA: You have deleted your partitions and, perhaps, have created two new ones. There is nothing useful you can do from the GRUB rescue screen, you need to install an operating system.\nDeleting partitions deletes all the data stored on those partitions. Including your OS. GRUB's job is to boot an installed OS. In the absence of an operating system, there's nothing that GRUB can do. So, pick an OS, any OS and install it. If you failed to install openSUSE, you can post a question about that on UNIX & Linux, explaining what you did and how it failed. Alternatively, you can install another distribution or even, if you so desire, Windows. What you can't do is use GRUB to get your Ubuntu back.\n", "Q: Problems with mi WiFi connection I would like to ask you for help with my WiFi connection.

Does Internet access work faster in Ubuntu compared to Windows 7/8/8.1? Is the peer speed also the same compared to what we get on Windows?\n\nA: Network stack optimisation differences between Windows or Ubuntu will pale into insignificance compared to driver issues. Some Linux drivers (especially in the wireless world) are unreliable but so are some Windows versions. There isn't one rule for every bit of hardware.\nI can anecdotally say that I'm very happy with wired networking and I'm occasionally angry with wireless networking but generally speaking, it's always been fast enough for purpose.\nBut it's impossible to give you a solid answer other than: test it and find out. Ubuntu is free and you can run a network test directly from a LiveCD. Then you'll know exactly how they compare.\n", "Q: Touchscreen with KVM switch gives clicks Im currently running a shuttle pc with the latest version of Ubuntu with a ELO touchscreen connected via a KVM switch (Belkin SOHO with usb hub).\nOn the other machine (a custom os) it works fine, instand connection and no random clicks. But in Ubuntu it takes a few seconds after you switch the kvm for the touchscreen to be found and when the KVM is not active the cursor gives random pulses every few seconds/minutes.\nI've installed the original ELO touch drivers and the screen is calibrated.\nWhat could possibly cause this?\n\nA: It was caused by the KVM switch you used.  The KVM switch does not support touch screen sharing which requires keep connecting the touch screen no matter it was switched off to other PC/systems.   \nYou can find a \"DDM class\" KVM switch which will keep the connection of sharing devices (specially for the HID devices - keyboard, mouse and touch screen monitor...etc) even when you switch between/ among connected systems. \nThe DDM class KVM switches will not cause any delay after you switching between/among connected systems.  \n", "Q: How one can install the font MT Extra on Ubuntu?

Members of the public will be using them.\nI want to add a \"press for assistance\" button to the app so that if people get stuck, they can talk to a real person. The kiosk hardware will have speakers and a mic. I'd like the process to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*They press the button\n\n*Something centrally rings\n\n*A support worker \"picks up\" the call\n\n*They talk and eventually one of them hangs up.\n\n\nAlternatively, if the support staff actively spots an issue at a kiosk, I'd like them to be able to start a call without any user interaction.\nI also need support staff to be able to identify which kiosk is calling in.\nA few problems spawn from wanting to do things like this. I need software to handle the calls and I need a way for my application to start (and end) the call.\nThings like TeamSpeak and Mumble seem a poor fit for this because I don't want all the kiosks talking to each other, just as I don't want the support staff's voice broadcasting out of every kiosk at once! I guess I'm after a local-only Skype but something I can actively control at the client end.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Industry standard for VOIP is the Asterisk server. Inside it you configure which telephony protocols are supported, who is allowed to call and to whom the calls are routed.\nAs a client you can use some command-line softphone. It will be easy to integrate it into the project with some shell scripting.\nOr you can take a VOIP library that supports SIP, H323 or whatever protocol and integrate it directly into the application. If it is a web application - WebRTC protocol is emerging now.\nTo start, install some SIP phone with GUI from the Ubuntu repository, set up Asterisk and several accounts on different machines. Call the number of one account from the other.\n", "Q: How to install Hadoop on Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit? \nI want to install hadoop on my Asus laptop running Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nWhen I tried to format the new File system, at that time I got an error\n 1. $ hadoop namenode -format or  \n\n 2. $ hdfs namenode -format \n\nit shows.. \nNo command hdfs found \n\nI am not getting why it shows error like that, because I executed all previous command successfully.  \n\nA: While searching for solution to your problem, I came across the same problem on stackoverflow- Hadoop command not found.\nMaybe this can help you.\n", "Q: Problem installing Ubuntu 14.04 on external hard disk, disk letter changes I have a serious problem installing ubuntu on my external hard disk.

This is frustrating.\n\nA: Have you tried the \"Boot Repair\" here. That just might repair the booting problem\n\nA: I did something similar a few days ago- installed Ubuntu on an \"external\" drive. I installed Ubuntu and the swap partition on the external drive, and the bootloader on my internal drive. Also try when formatting the external drive, I set it up as Ext4, \"primary\" (not logical).

Then I have added this path to my PATH variable. When I try to execute JLinkExe I get the following error:\nCan not connect to J-Link via USB.\n\nWhen I try to execute it with sudo I get:\nsudo: JLinkExe: command not found\n\nThe only way to execute it with success is:\n\n\n*\n\n*to change directory with cd /home/mkru/ARM/JLink_Linux_V498a_x86_64\n\n*then run sudo ./JLinkExe\nWhy does it work like that and how can I change this behaviour ? I would like to use JLinkExe without sudo and without the need to be in this specific directory.\n\nA: Certain features require root elevations. Low-level USB interaction is one of them, I experienced the same when I wanted to use my LEGO NXT robot.\nFirst of all, if the program only works with sudo, move it away from your home. I suggest moving it to /opt/jlink/ or something like that\nTo keep having to cd to the executable directory, add it to the global bath in /etc/bash.bashrc, instead of your home bashrc. Also, define an alias which automatically executes the program with root elevations. The additions to the file may look like this:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/jlink    #or wherever you moved it\nalias JLinkExe='sudo /opt/jlink/JLinkExe'\n\nNow you can execute the program just by entering JLinkExe (you could even assign a easier-to-enter name in the alias, e.g. simply alias jlink='sudo /opt/jlink/JLinkExe').\nHowever, you'll still be asked for your password, as the program still requires root elevation. To circumvent that, you can create an entry in your sudo setup. For this, execute sudo visudo and add this line to the end of the file\nmkru ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/jlink/JLinkExe\n\nAfter saving this, you (and only you, i.e. user mkru) shouldn't be asked for giving the program root elevations any more. Keep in mind that it will still be running with elevated privileges.\n\nNOTE: If the program has a GUI, create the alias as alias jlink='sudo gksudo /opt/jlink/JLinkExe' to prevent it from messing up ownerships in your home directory.\n\nA: There is a slightly better solution. Just copy the 99-jlink.rules file (part of the downloaded package) into /etc/udev/rules.d/ and it should work like a charm.\n", "Q: I managed to completely remove my ethernet card, even from BIOS The problem is that I can't use my built in ethernet card. BIOS can't see it if I use SMART LAN it runs only \"Virtual Cable Test\", Windows can't use the card obviously, not even Xubuntu. Here is what I have been doing which might have caused the removal of the card.\nI have installed Ubuntu/xubuntu with XFCE alongside Windows on another HDD.\nI started to customize it a bit to fit my needs, added programs, utils etc. After that I wanted to enable audio output to 2 different devices at once (speakers/headphones) and I didn't know how to do that so I googled a bit and tried few suggestion, mainly Sound from both headphones and speakers. I haven't really noticed that it is not a solution for me and after I followed the steps I ented up without sound in linux at all.

I am pretty sure I have used also some other suggestions unfortunately I don' remember which since nothing helped at all. I still had only the Dummy output.\nAfter that I gave up and just decided to start from fresh, to remove my Ubuntu to Xubuntu to XFCE installation and install clean Xubuntu.\nSometimes during this time I noticed that my internet connection doesn't work at all.

I tried all the usually suggested commands for listing ethernet devices in Linux and nothing showed up there.\nI have tried to reset BIOS to default, enable/disable/enable the onboard LAN. Nothing helped at all.\nSo the question is can you suggest some fix? I had no idea I could remove my ethernet device like this via Linux. The closest to my issue is this topic here lspci and lshw show no network devices but I have no idea how to fix that. Would reflashing bios work or what could I try to get my LAN to work again?

After clearing CMOS I loaded default settings in BIOS, customized what I needed and was ready to go again.\nHowever after starting fresh with new Xubuntu installation and doing a few configurations, installations the same issue happened.\nI have again tried to enable the simultaneous output however now I tried it by installing paprefs and enabling virtual output device there. (after all I noticed that I just had the devices plugged in wrong holes :D - anyway at least I learned something new.) \nThen I hit \"Restart\" from the menu to restart the PC, after the restart the PC hanged before post screen so basically it didn't boot up. Monitor went into inactive state and nothing happened. I had to force my PC to quit and start it again. After that I was able to boot up however the ethernet card disappeared again.\nSo I had to clear CMOS again using the jumper on my motherboard and it worked fine again.\nWhen I booted to Xubuntu after this latest clear I noticed that the ALSA plug-in [plugin-container] Alsa Playback appeared in PulseAudio Volume control which was added there even with the first Ubuntu installation after all the changes I did. \nSo to conclude I suspect that sometime during the installation of ALSA it does something with BIOS which cause at least on my PC the ethernet card to be removed/disabled. I am not sure what it does or why or whether it is caused by ALSA for sure (70% sure) but clearing CMOS helped in my case to fix the No etherned card found issue.\n", "Q: How do I print a Thunderbird contact name and address on an postal envelope? I want to select a Thunderbird contact and print the name and address directly on to a postal envelope for mailing.\nI do not want to print a list of contacts or fiddle around with single labels. Yes, I can handwrite the details on the envelope but it is not ideal. I have tried LibreOffice>Writer>Envelope but it results in all contacts being included in the output document. Ditto for mail merge.\nLubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\nLibreOffice Version: 4.2.7.2 Build ID: 420m0(Build:2)\nThunderbird 31.5.0\nThis should be such an obvious and simple thing.  Please help.\n\nA: Personally, I put addresses on my letters and use window envelopes but perhaps this will be more to your liking.\nFrom the writer menu select File->Insert->Envelope.\nYou'll see something like this: \n\nHere you'll choose your registered database details for pulling your contact info in. (For more on registering a database see Help, address books;registering)or check the documentation here or perhaps here \nChange to the Format tab displaying this:\n\nand adjust to match your envelope.\nFinally, move to the Printer tab and choose the orientation at which you will feeding your envelope as below, adjusting any other settings as necessary to your requirements:\n\nNow, Click the New Document Button. You'll see something similar to this:\n\nMake final adjustments/corrections so that everything aligns the way you want, insert your envelope in the printer based on the orientation chosen previously and click print. \nIf anything doesn't work as advertised, bugs can be reviewed and reported here: https://bugs.documentfoundation.org//\n\nA: OVERVIEW\nAn additional software application is needed to print a selected Thunderbird (TB) contact to an envelope using LibreOffice (LO).  That software is gLabels and it is available from the Ubuntu Software Centre.\nThis method requires a fair amount of non-technical effort to set up.  Once the templates are there, printing direct to envelopes is easy.\nBEFORE YOU START YOU WILL NEED...\n\n\n*\n\n*LO Base (the database module) installed.\n\n*gLabels installed from Ubuntu Software Centre\n\n\nGIVE LIBREOFFICE ACCESS TO THUNDERBIRD CONTACT DATABASE\n\n\n*In LO Writer select File>Wizard>Address Data Source> Thunderbird/Icedove>[Contact table name]. This creates a data connection between TB contacts and LO. Name the .odb file.\n\n\nCREATE A LIBREOFFICE DATABASE FILE TO PROCESS THUNDERBIRD CONTACT DATA\n\n\n*Open LO Base>Open an existing database file>navigate to your saved .odb file>Finish\n\n*Select Queries>Use Wizard to Create Query>Select the table storing your contact data and pick the fields holding the salutations, names and address data.  Complete Wizard to create query.\n\n*Right mouse click on the query and select Edit.  Change the order of fields and sort/filter the data as required.\nTOP TIP Have the first field/column containing concatenated first and family names (in TB Contacts this is called 'Display').  This will be used as a record identifier in gLabels.\n\n*Save the .odb database\n\n\nEXPORT THE REQUIRED DATA TO A CSV FILE THAT CAN BE READ BY gLabels\n\n\n*Right click on the Base query and select [Copy]\n\n*Select File>New>Spreadsheet to open a new LO Calc file\n\n*Right Mouse click in cell A1 and select [Paste]\n\n*Save the Calc file as CSV in a location you will remember.  This is the CSV that will be used by gLabels.\n\n\nCREATE ENVELOPE TEMPLATE FILES IN gLabels\n\n\n*Open gLabels.  Select File>Template Designer\n\n*Follow the Wizard using the page size to define the size of the envelope.\n\n*Use the dimensions width and height from the Page size tab to define the label dimensions on the 'Label or Card Size' tab.  You only want 1 label - about envelope sized!  This can be confirmed in the Layout(s) tab.\n\n*When your envelope template is completed click File>New>Custom and follow the wizard.  You have an orientation option at this point - select 'Rotated'.\n\n*Open the envelope template you have created.\n\n*Select Objects>Merge properties> Format: Text:Comma Separated Values (CSV). Location: - Navigate to the CSV saved in step 11. You'll be able to check all is OK because you will see data listed from the first field in the preview pane.\n\n*Unselect All> then tick the record corresponding to the contact you want to address on the envelope.  Clicking the left triangle next to the contact data will expand the record vertically showing field numbers and the data held therein. You will need to refer to this later.\n\n*Save the Envelope Template.  You can create a shortcut to this on your desktop for convenience.\n\n*Click the 'Create Text Object' and click/drag to create a text rectangle aligned to the top left corner of the envelope area. Select the Text tab in the right pane and click the Insert merge field button. A pick list allows you to select the fields you need for the envelope using the field numbers mentioned in step 18.  These fields can be arranged on the same line with spaces or placed on new lines by editing the text in the right pane window.\n\n*Save your file.  Check your work with a print preview as follows (and edit if required)\n\n*Click Edit Merge Properties icon to see a list of contacts. Unselect All> then Tick the record corresponding to the contact you want to address on the envelope. Click OK.\n\n*Select File>Print...>Preview to see how the envelope will print.\n\n*Fine tune the layout by editing the gLabels template file. Save the file.\n\n\nHAPPY PRINTING\n\n\n*To print your envelope, open the gLabels template and perform steps 22 & 23.\n\n\nCHECK YOUR ADDRESS BEFORE PRINTING! YOU ARE NOT ACCESSING THUNDERBIRD DATA DIRECTLY. BE PREPARED TO REPEAT STEPS 8-11 TO REFRESH THE LABEL DATA FILE.\nADDITIONAL NOTES\nThis method does not link to TB contact data dynamically but refers to a snapshot CSV intermediate file which means that the more regularly names and addresses are changed, the more frequently the CSV needs to be rebuilt (steps 8-11)\nIf anyone can refine this method to get closer to dynamic data processing - eg. a shell script to create a fresh the CSV before opening the gLabels envelope template file, that would be great.\nIf someone could write an add-in for Thunderbird or LibreOffice that did all this in a simple way, that would be superb!     \n", "Q: Lenovo G580 sound only via headphone plug and freezes Hello Ubuntu Community,\nYesterday I installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, because I got sound problems under Windows 8.0 and 8.1.

However I can only start modelsim using the ./vsim command in terminal.\nI want to be able to run modelsim without using the terminal. Is this possible? If so, how do I do it?\n\nA: You can create a launcher file to place in /usr/share/applications (for all users) or in ~/.local/share/applications (only for you). Use your favorite text editor to create the file (I'd say you call it vsim.desktop) and paste the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=<Name of your program>\nComment=<Description of your program, can be omitted>\nExec=<path to executable>\nIcon=<path to icon file or icon name in system icon cache>\nTerminal=false\nCategories=<categories your program belongs to, semicolon separated>\n\nFor ModelSim, I'd choose Categories=Development;. If you want to be able to open files directly with modelsim, define Exec and TryExec like this:\nExec=<path to executable> %U\nTryExec=<path to executable>\n\nAfter the system notices the new launcher file, it will be available in the application menu, if it doesn't contain syntax errors.

I am using the key capture function so I know the XF86 code is correct\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Very much a workaround but I have instead used compizconfig to map these keys to CLI commands for banshee rather than trying to use the media keys.\nWorks 100% in banshee therefore but no use if you're using other media players.\n", "Q: Run shell script on keyboard shortcut I would like to run a shell script on the press of a button. The script works if I run it like usually: sh script.sh. But assigning a shortcut to it doesn't work.\n\nHow would you do this in Xubuntu 14.10?\n\nA: Awesome post.  I've been searching for a way to do this for the last few versions of ubuntu (currently on 19.04)\nUsing the full path is what did it.  Thank you.\nWhat worked for me was the following...\nI was looking for a way to set a hotkey to insert the date / time into whatever document I had open.\nI found a script online and made a few minor changes (primarily the hotkey association because I didn't like their choice since it was a key combo that was already used by ubuntu) to one I wanted and which was also available.\nCreated a file called 'insertTimestamp.sh' in my root directory.\nI then pasted (and slightly modified) the code to my liking...\nCopy/paste the code below\n# ! /bin/sh\nxdotool keyup \"super+t\"; # needed to refresh the status of the request.  simulates letting go of the hotkey super+t keys, otherwise it interferes with ctrl-v paste function\ndate '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' | tr -d \"\\n\" | xsel -i -b; # add the date/time to the clipboard\nxdotool key \"ctrl+v\"; #simulate a ctrl-v\n# xdotool keydown \"super\"; #unpretend the user let go of the super key\n\nOnce I pasted the above into the file and saved it, it was necessary to change the permissions of the file\nchmod u+x ~/insertTimestamp.sh\n\nOnce done, you simply need to search for \"keyboard\" => choose Keyboard  => Go to Application Shortcuts Tab => Add => For \"Command\" type sh the/full/path/insertTimestamp.sh (update your full path) => Set keys as super+t.\nI hope this provides a decent example of how to set this up.\n\n\nA: I'm pretty sure the problem is the ~. That is a shell (commandline shell) feature and the keyboard shortcuts are handled by the graphical shell. I don't think that ~ or $HOME will be expanded correctly there. So, instead of ~/path/to/script, use\n/home/username/Documents/Various/SyncStuff.sh\n\nThat assumes you have made the script executable. If not, use\nsh /home/username/Documents/Various/SyncStuff.sh\n\nThe sh should be enough since the $PATH is also read by graphical shells as far as I know. If that also fails, try with the full path but I doubt it will be necessary:\n/bin/sh /home/username/Documents/Various/SyncStuff.sh\n\n", "Q: how to turn off ipv6 at startup from console I am a old-fashioned Debian user. And I am confused and frustrated about some differences between Ubuntu and Debian. For example, I tried to edit /etc/sysctl.conf and to the end, I added:\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\n\nThen I run sysctl -P\nwhich runs fine.\nThen I checked\ncat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\n\nwhich output:\n1\n\nNow I am confused because with netstat -tulpen I can still see the machine is listening on IPv6.\nI feel that this is hidden away and I'm upset about it.  Is there anything else like this I should know?\n\nA: There are no reason what so ever to turn IPv6 off. It will not be used if there are no IPv6 router in your network. \nSo follow the \"Don't fix if it isn't broken\". And IPv6 isn't broken. \nAnd there are no difference how Debian is doing this.\nBut if you really don't want IPv6, which there are no reason what so ever to not want, just blacklist the ipv6 module and reboot.  No need to fix in sysctl.conf.\n\nA: actually for many applications IPv6 does cause issues, internal networks many ISP's are still have no IPv6 and both Debian and Ubuntu will choose IPv6 by default and suddenly turn off IPv4 and anything using IPv4 will not work.\nTeamspeak3 is a prime example, webmin also has an issue with this as well if your connected via IPv4 and suddenly Debian or Ubuntu turns if off then you lose connection.\nSo Until both Debian and Ubuntu fix this issue yes many people will want to turn it off.\n", "Q: How do I purge Pantheon desktop?/Why does this window appear? This browser window showing http://elementary.io/ \n appears after I installed then uninstalled the Pantheon environment:\n\nOriginally this occurred after (and possibly before) ppa-purging the PPA only when not connected to the internet - a window without a title that the window manager would ignore would appear, then dissapear.

This is a new feature [1] in Elementary OS which seeks to make connecting to the Internet seamless when behind captive portals (hence the name). It is similar in nature to features on mobile platforms like iOS and Android. When on a restricted connection such as hotel or airport wifi a check is made to see if the computer can reach the 'real' Internet, and not the blocked off bit you have to sign into, in order to gain access.\nSo to me this just looks like a remnant of that feature kicking around, and needs removal.\n[1] https://code.launchpad.net/~spinatelli/elementaryos/captive-login\n\nA: Run\nsudo apt-get remove --purge capnet-assist\n\n", "Q: Brightness doesn't work on acer aspire 4741 Please, can anybody help me ?\nBrightness doesn't work on Acer Aspire 4741.\nI use Ubuntu 14.10 x64.

It turns out that the following two commands create a qcow2 and bare disk image of minimal size, respectively:\nqemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu-trusty.qcow 6527123968\nfallocate -l 6527123457 ubuntu-trusty.img\n\nThe values are curious because\n\n\n*\n\n*they are different (but this might be due to the qcow format)\n\n*because 6527123968=12748289*512\n\n*because 6527123457-1=12748288*512\n\n*because neither one or the other are close to either 6.5 GB or 6.5 GiB. They are about 6.53 GB or 6.08 GiB\n\n*the installer forces me to create a 6.08 GiB disk image but ends up only using 3.4 GiB of the primary partition\n\n\nBut this is now way off topic ;)\n", "Q: QML app with C++ plugin (cmake) subdirectory I am developing an Ubuntu Phone application \"QML app with C++ plugin (cmake)\" but I have so many qml files so I want to separate them by functionality\nApplicationName\n\n\n*\n\n*CMakeListes.txt\n\n*..\n\n*app\n\n*\n\n*CmakeListes.txt\n\n*ApplicationName.desktop.in\n\n*tests\n\n*mainComponents\n\n*\n\n*sub directories of mainComponents\n\n*\n\n*some files\n\n\n*some other files\n\n\n*ApplicationName.qml\n\n\n*po\n\n*\n\n*CMakeListes.txt\n\n\n*ApplicationName.apparmor\n\n*manifest.json.in\n\n\nbut the \"mainComponents\" folder dose not appear in the project tree and after some searches I found that I must add CMakeListes.txt in every new folder and this:\nadd_subdirectory(folder_name)\ninstruction in the parent folder CMakeListes.txt file but I don't if there is more to add and I don't know how to create the CMakeListes.txt\nthanks\n\nA: You just need to learn the CMake language. It is the language of the CMakeListes.txt files that are all over the project.\nThis language specifies how to build the project. And this language is independent from the QtCreator IDE that we are using. So, you can do builds without QtCreator and create CMakeListes.txt manually where you wish.\nBack to the problem:\nYou can use 'add_subdirectory' and write CMakeListes.txt for each subdirectory and append file names to QML_JS_FILES variable in each CMakeListes.txt.\nBut you can also do as the guys who develop core application do: for example in ubuntu-terminal-app (source code is on https://launchpad.net), they use a recursive include in app/CMakeListes.txt:\nfile(GLOB_RECURSE QML_JS_FILES *.qml *.js)\n\ninstead of non-recursive:\nfile(GLOB QML_JS_FILES *.qml *.js)\n\nupdate:\nYes, generally, GLOBs are not recommended, but they are already in the project templates to simulate some kind of 'automatic' behavior.\n", "Q: How to change the default appearance of amarok in Ubuntu 14.04 I started using amarok initially when i used Kubuntu and since then I've not seen any reason to drop it, so i switched to Ubuntu and installed amarok but the only problem i have is that i don't like the default orange appearance(i know it's trying to take the Ubuntu look) i've searched and googled how to change it to some other color maybe blue but I've not seen any answer and it's not under settings in amarok either. please how do i do this\n\nA: Well, Amarok was originally developed under KDE and maybe in Kubuntu it was easier for you to change themes but still you can try these solutions one of them should work:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install kcontrol\n\nif it didn't work then try:\nsudo apt-get install systemsettings\n\nAfter this you should be able to configure KDE apps.\n", "Q: Why can't I connect to Ubuntu One?

To do that I simply put it in /bin and made it executable, but I am not able to execute it and get this output error:\nError: Unable to access jarfile Test.jar\n\n\nA: This sounds like you messed up the permissions of the Jar file. Check what permissions the file currently has using ls -l /bin/Test.jar. Maybe you didn't give execution permissions to all users or didn't assign read permission.\nYou can simply fix this with a chmod guo+rx /bin/Test.jar and the necessary permissions should be there.\n\nAlso, please note that /bin is meant for system executables. For your own executables, use /usr/local/bin.

I have an nForce 430, the newest driver available for it is the 304.x, which is available in the Additional Software, but results in an ACPI error on startup. Someone else suggested that nForce support wasn't very good in some of the later drivers, and I should try the 173.x instead, which is also available through the Additional Software. However, when I select it and click apply changes, nothing happens. It just reverts right back to having the x.org driver selected. So, I'm trying it through tty.\nI've checked, and I have the appropriate headers installed for my kernel version. Even tried installing sources, just to be sure.\nI'm using tty1 Ctrl+Alt+F1, and I've stopped lightdm service prior to installing.\nAlso, just a quick  question? What is the difference in using for Terminal, Ctrl+Alt+F1 versus F2 or F3 .\n\nA: With a passmark of 22, you're better off ditching the card entirely and moving to a low-end version of Ubuntu like Lubuntu as you will have virtually no benefits of installing such an old driver with such an old card.\nSorry to be the harbinger of bad news... :-(\n\nA: Well, I've tested lots of nvidia drivers on different cards as a fan of nvidia and to tell you the truth 173 version is not fully compatible or tested with Ubuntu 14.04LTS, that's why you get:\n..Error - “Kernel module failed to build\n\nHappened to me too, though I have managed to install 173 driver on Ubuntu 12.04LTS it was working and seemed to be fine but it's uncompatible with newer Linux kernels starting off 14.04.2LTS point release it uses Utopic default kernel, so you'll have only to downgrade the system and that's a big mess, you'll face issues with dependencies in the future.\nWhat I can suggest you to install 304.119 driver on Ubuntu 14.04.1 not 2 it worked fine. Or install 12.04LTS. But if you have nvidia 6500 series and up at least the newest available driver version 304.125 will be working just fine.\nAlso, you can use my workaround on how to install nvidia driver\n\nA: Today, I faced similar error, after attempting to update Nvidia drivers.\nIt turned out that the problem was caused by different compiler used to build the kernel module. \nRecently I've set gccto be associated with gcc-6. As it turns out - this isn't the right version to build kernel modules, at least at Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I simply reconfigured gcc alternatives with sudo update-alternatives --config gcc to point gcc-5 and then reinstalled the Nvidia driver, using \nsudo apt-get purge nvidia* followed by sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall.\nAlthough this answer may be little off topic here, I hope it will be helpful for someone, searching the same keywords I did.\n", "Q: cp problems with copying root I have a little bash script going to check if the system has been backed up today and and if it hasn't then it copies the entire filesystem into the backups folder:\ndate=$(date +\"%m%d%y\")\nsudo mkdir -p \"/backups/system/$date\"\nsudo cp -r \"/\" \"/backups/system/$date\"\n\nMy problem is that when I enter this it gives me these errors:\ncp: error reading ‘/proc/1/task/1/mem’: Input/output error\ncp: failed to extend ‘/backups/system/040315/proc/1/task/1/mem’: Input/output error\ncp: error reading ‘/proc/1/task/1/clear_refs’: Invalid argument\ncp: failed to extend ‘/backups/system/040315/proc/1/task/1/clear_refs’: Invalid argument\n\n\nA: In Linux everything is a file\n(That does not mean you can back them up)\nTechnically everything is not files (I am no expert). However, some folders are special in the sense that they are not real folders. /proc is just one of them. It is a virtual file system that contains runtime file information. In other words, its contents keep changing as the system runs. You should not try to back it up.\nOther such folders are /sys, /mnt, /media, /run and /dev . /sys like /proc is another virtual filesystem that provide windows into variables of the running kernel, so you do not want to try and backup or restore them. /dev is a tmpfs whose contents are created and deleted dynamically by udev, so you also do not want to backup or restore it. Likewise, /run is a tmpfs that holds variables about the running system that do not need backed up. This paragraph is adapted from Backup Your System/TAR.\nIn general copying / is not a good idea. Note, /backups/system/$date is also a part of /. So you may end up baking up the backup till kingdom come, or you run out of disk space.\nHope This helps\n\nA: Ignore them. You're trying to copy files from /proc which is both pointless and won't work, as you saw. Those are basically runtime files vreated by the OS. There's no need or reason to have backups of such files. \nSo, the simple approach is to just ignore the errors. You can also stop them appearing by redirecting error output to /dev/null:\nsudo cp -r / \"/backups/system/$date\" 2>/dev/null\n\nA more sophisticated approach would be to specify the directories you want to copy. For example:\nsudo cp -r /lib /usr /mnt /bin /opt /lib64 /tmp /home /sbin /media /etc /root  /boot /var \"/backups/system/$date\"\n\nThose are the ones you care about. You probably don't need /mnt or /media either. \n", "Q: How to change file ownership when chown says \"invalid user: ‘–R'\"? ubuntu64@ubuntu:/$ sudo chown –R hduser:hadoop mongodbdata\nchown: invalid user: ‘–R'\n\nWhen I try to change the ownership of the file, I am just getting invalid user: '-R' error. \n\nA: You must have copied the command from a webpage that uses strange formatting.

You don't \"deal with\" this, it's normal.\n/proc is a virtual filesystem, as are /dev and /sys (if present), meant to present system information and provide a file-like way to change the system configuration - that is, those files aren't really on your hard disk.\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/5/proc\nAll sorts of broken links and loops and I/O errors can and will occur if you try to iterate over /proc it as if it were a \"regular\" folder, because... it's not.\nSo, the answer is: you don't.\nIf you want, you can silence the errors by redirecting them to /dev/null:\n$ ls -alRc 2> /dev/null\nFor the sake of experimentation, notice how doing a cat /dev/null afterwards does not print your errors - because as we said /dev is a virtual filesystem and /dev/null is not a real file but... the closest analogue to a black hole you'll find in a Linux system :)\n", "Q: Trojaned version of file \"egrep\" detected by OSSEC HIDS I have installed the latest stable version of OSSEC

That part I understand, I must have messed the order of which interfaces need to be brought up, which is my second question: What oder should I bring up the interfaces? \nMy primary question though is, how do I cancel or exit waiting for bond0 to be ready?

I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and was attempting to do the upgrade to 14.10 without losing my home folder and it's contents.... however something went wrong because after rebooting I was not able to access anything or boot into Ubuntu at all.\nI used my Live disc to restore back to 14.04 without formatting so it deleted and reinstalled my Ubuntu but also deleted my home folder and gave me a default home folder.  This was last night, and I have made a point to do as little as possible so not to write new data.\nHow can I recover my old home folder? I'm not very good with command line for something this complex so I would prefer a GUI based application to restore the data of my old home folder.\n*ADD\nI've attempted to do a restore using gparted, but my partition table was not changed as it all happened within the existing partition table.  I lost nearly 2 TB of data, but haven't written anything besides the OS since it was deleted and now all of that is free space on the same partition.  I took a look at the data recovery guide but it is mostly for recovering entire partitions and that's not the case here.\n\nA: Start from the live cd then chroot the system and check /home. Chroot is essentially the procedure described on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCdRecovery in the section Update Failure. In addition to this guide mount /home too.\nIf you can't see a folder with your previous username in /home then you lost your data.\nDuring recovery if you choose the same username as before then don't even bother to try the procedure above because your data is gone anyway.\n", "Q: ProFont missing font after reboot I have installed ProFont and enable it by this command:\nsudo rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf\nsudo fc-cache -f -v\n\nAll works good.

I mean I am expecting, from the very first time itself it is trusted.\nIs importing bazaar.launchpad.net's public key a logical thing to do ?\n\nA: No. The first time you connect to any SSH host, you will be presented with a similar message for that host. That is just how SSH functions.\n\nA: If you just accept the key without checking, encryption is moot because of the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attacks.\nYou question corresponds to a bug that was reported on https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/238869\nComment #55 there links to a page where the current fingerprints of keys are listed, to allow checking if these are the real keys and provide actual protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.\nI do not copy the actual fingerprints here because it may/will change in the future and the upstream people cannot update every duplicate copy posted on the Internet.\nFor more explanation, see my answer to similar question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18710120/the-authenticity-of-host-github-com-192-30-252-128-cant-be-established\n", "Q: WiFi+Bluetooth problem I bought an HP 15-203TX DOS laptop and installed Ubuntu 14.04.2 which I downloaded from the Ubuntu website.\nOn starting, the WiFi gets connected and works only for several minutes, then it's connected but data/packets are not working.\nBluetooth is also not detecting any device nor gets detected by any other device.\nWhen I changed my desktop background more errors occur.\nwords missing from icons and list items.\nAfter restarting, the wifi again works for a few minutes then goes off.\nwords remain  missing some time and sometime works fine.\nThe output of wireless-info can be found here.\n\nA: It seems that the bluetooth will only work after installing modules from Larry Fingers Github site\nsudo apt-get install build-essential git linux-headers-generic\ngit clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new.git\ncd rtlwifi_new\nmake\nsudo make install\ncd ~\ngit clone -b troy https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723au_bt.git\ncd rtl8723au_bt-troy\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nReboot\nSince these are built only for the current kernel, a kernel update will cause bluetooth to quit functioning and your wifi may revert to having issues, when that happens\ncd rtlwifi_new\nmake clean\nmake\nsudo make install\n\ncd ~/rtl8723au_bt-troy\nmake clean\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nReboot\n", "Q: How to remove a apt-key which I have added?

I know about where its stored and furthermore guess the file ending. Plus, I don't need the content of the file, the file name is perfectly sufficient.\nThe reason why I'm asking this, of course, is that this file is deleted. I tried recovery tools but it didn't help. Testdisk comes up with a lot files because it's a system partition and its impossible to read all the names.\nIt would be great to have a list of the name of as many deleted files as possible because I then could find it with ease. But I don't see a good way to do this with testdisk except for maybe cloning the output, placing a stone on the keyboard to scroll trough all the results and then to come back after a week to proceed.\nTo you know how I can get such a list? Or a list of as many deleted files that last were in a certain directory?\nEdit: I'm currently downloading Ubuntu 12.04 to check out the software mentioned in the comments below since 12.04 is the newest version of Ubuntu with this package. I thought that I had a machine running Ubuntu 12.04 but as it turned out it's Ubuntu 12.10.\nEdit 2: I guess that I probably should mention here, too, that the proposed solution in the question this question allegedly is a duplicate of, didn't work. I now tried it and got errors: pastebin.com/JtTnPCD9 But I also got a long list of deleted files, none of which even match the file extension candidates. I also know another part of the file name but it also doesn't occur even once, so I can rule out that the file I'm searching for is in there.\nEdit 3: I'm searching for a video. Either the name of the file or its content is okay. I don't need both.\n\nA: If testdisk couldn't see the file, that means that the filesystem entry containing the references to it has been overwritten already.\nAs for any overwritten file, there's no way to recover such overwritten entry (i.e. there's no way to recover the filename).\nBut if recovering the file's content is enough, you can try to use photorec, which will read the device block by block looking for known file structure patterns (also note that per its scope photorec will recover any file of the same type of the missing file's type present on the drive); assuming that your file had a .ext extension:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal by hitting Ctrl+Alt+t\n\n*Install photorec: sudo apt-get install testdisk\n\n*Run photorec: sudo photorec\n\n*Select the drive containing the partition from which the file was deleted and choose Proceed\n\n*Choose File Opt\n\n*Hit s to untick all the entries in the list. Find the entry containing the .ext extension, hit Spacebar and then hit Enter\n\n*Select the partition from which the file was deleted and choose Search\n\n*Select the partition type and hit Enter\n\n*Navigate to the directory in which you wish to recover the deleted file(s) using Left / Right and hit C\n\n*Wait, this might take a while based on your drive type (HDD/SSD) and on your drive size\n\n*Browse to the folder in which you chose to recover the file(s) and see if your file was recovered\n\n", "Q: How to provide acces to my Video folder to Guest account I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and I would like to give to the guest account read access to the Video/Movies folder that is below to /home/myuser/ directory.\nHow can I achieve that ?\n\nA: You can allow everybody (including guests) to access this folder, if you give other users read and execution permissions to\n\n\n*\n\n*the folder in question and everything below it (recursively) and\n\n*every folder between / and the folder in question.\n\n\nExample:\nYou want to allow everybody to access /home/cristiano/Videos/Movies.

Since then I've encountered unexplained total lockups of Google Chrome, and in later discussions discovered that both my girlfriend and another friend had been having the same experiences.\nAt the moment, my solution is to use a third, and much more difficult to install web browser known as Opera.  Since installing it, I've discovered that my home security system software works better with Opera than either Firefox or Chrome, so now I feel I need to have it on any computers I intend to use.  It is not uncommon to find me using two browsers concurrently, and sometimes three.\nThere are many tutorials on how to install it, some even on this site, and I've discovered that not all of them appear to work for me.  The one I continually return to is linked here.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser\nI realize that one might say this isn't a direct answer to your question, I mean I can't tell you how to make the Chrome browser work properly, and I doubt anyone can.  I would advise you to try another browser for a while and return in a few more months to see if Chrome has been fixed yet.\n", "Q: How to install Grameenphone modem in Ubuntu 14.04 I connect the modem with USB and it detects it as a CD-Rom then I Explore the CD-Rom and get 3 folders, one of them is Linux.

I'm currently trying (and failing) to make a system icon theme for the Ubuntu LightDM login screen. I really hate the default ubuntu-mono-dark icons, and would like to use my own set of icons.\nAfter experimenting with icon names for a few hours, Google searching for a bit, and referring to existing system themes like gnome, and ubuntu-mono*, I can't determine which of the hundreds of icons are actually used at the login screen.\nSo, I'm looking for two things here really:\n\n\n*\n\n*What categories of icons does LightDM use? actions, apps, stock, status, etc?\n\n*What are the names of the icons that LightDM looks for?\n\n\nFrom what I can tell, the indicators seem to be the same ones from the Unity desktop space (indicator-power, nm-applet, indicator-sound, indicator-keyboard, etc.). As such, I would've thought that using icon-names associated with those indicators would work, however LightDM doesn't seem to like the names that I'm using and simply shows an incomplete theme at login.\nNote that I am aware that LightDM only looks for icons under /usr/share/icons/ and that I've been the applying theme with ubuntu-tweak.\nEDIT: After struggling with getting the names, I still haven't found the correct answer. Can anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: Turns out that this was a simple matter of giving the wrong permissions to my icon set. There was nothing wrong with my theme, it just couldn't be read. Odds are, if you're modifying an existing icon theme, it has all the required icons. Permissions just need to be set as 755 for directories, and 644 for files.\nLesson from this: Always check permissions!!\n", "Q: PUA.Phishing.Bank Found I scanned my machine (with the latest version of ClamAV) after looking at some images which were loaded from external sites and those sites seem to be dodgy hacking sites, and these were some of the results that I got about my Google Chrome cache:\n/home/arthur-dent/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_009bb4: PUA.JS.Xored FOUND\n/home/arthur-dent/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_00b45d: PUA.JS.Xored FOUND\n/home/arthur-dent/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_00afd9: PUA.JS.Xored FOUND\n/home/arthur-dent/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_00b45e: PUA.JS.Xored FOUND\n/home/arthur-dent/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_00afdc: PUA.JS.Xored FOUND\n/home/arthur-dent/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_00b353: PUA.Phishing.Bank FOUND\n/home/arthur-dent/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_00b414: PUA.Phishing.Bank FOUND\n/home/arthur-dent/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_000e30: PUA.JS.Xored FOUND\n/home/arthur-dent/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_0071e4: PUA.JS.Xored FOUND\n/home/arthur-dent/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_00b382: PUA.Phishing.Bank FOUND\n\nNow, I often get the PUA.JS.Xored so I'm not really worried about them, but never before have I got the PUA.Phishing.Bank, so what are these and can they do any damage?

I have noticed that when scanning my machine with:\nsudo rkhunter --checkall --sk\n\nThat part of the output in the log file is:\n[21:50:51]   Checking for missing log files                  [ Skipped ]\n[21:50:51]   Checking for empty log files                    [ Skipped ]\n[21:50:51]\n[21:50:51] Info: Test 'apps' disabled at users request.\n\nWhy are some of these test skipped? And how would I get it not to skip them? Also what does it mean by Test 'apps' disabled at users request, as I have not asked it to not test for anything?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.10\nRelease:    14.10\n\nPackage Information:\nrkhunter:\n  Installed: 1.4.0-3\n  Candidate: 1.4.0-3\n  Version table:\n *** 1.4.0-3 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ utopic/universe amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n\nA: First, according to the manpage --checkall is not a valid command. Probably rkhunter interprets it as just --check.\n\nThe checking for missing and empty log files are performed by the filesystem test. Both are user defined checks; you must tell rkhunter which log files it is suppose to check. This is the relevant part of /etc/rkhunter.conf:\n# The two options below may be used to check if a file is missing or empty\n# (that is, it has a size of zero). The EMPTY_LOGFILES option will also check\n# if the file is missing, since that can be interpreted as a file of no size.\n# However, the file will only be reported as missing if the MISSING_LOGFILES\n# option hasn't already done this.\n#\n# Both options are space-separated lists of pathnames, and may be specified\n# more than once.\n#\n# NOTE: Log files are usually 'rotated' by some mechanism. At that time it is\n# perfectly possible for the file to be either missing or empty. As such these\n# options may produce false-positive warnings when log files are rotated.\n#\n# For both options the default value is the null string.\n#\n#EMPTY_LOGFILES=\"\"\n#MISSING_LOGFILES=\"\"\n\nI think it is self explanatory.\n\nRegarding the Test 'apps' disabled at users request info message, the answer is also in /etc/rkhunter.conf. This is where you should look:\n# These two options determine which tests are to be performed. The ENABLE_TESTS\n# option can use the word 'ALL' to refer to all of the available tests. The\n# DISABLE_TESTS option can use the word 'NONE' to mean that no tests are\n# disabled. The list of disabled tests is applied to the list of enabled tests.\n#\n# Both options are space-separated lists of test names, and both options may\n# be specified more than once. The currently available test names can be seen\n# by using the command 'rkhunter --list tests'.\n#\n# The supplied configuration file has some tests already disabled, and these\n# are tests that will be used only occasionally, can be considered 'advanced'\n# or that are prone to produce more than the average number of false-positives.\n#\n# Please read the README file for more details about enabling and disabling\n# tests, the test names, and how rkhunter behaves when these options are used.\n#\n# The default values are to enable all tests and to disable none. However, if\n# either of the options below are specified, then they will override the\n# program defaults.\n#\n# hidden_procs test requires the unhide and/or unhide.rb commands which are\n# part of the unhide respectively unhide.rb packages in Debian.\n#\n# apps test is disabled by default as it triggers warnings about outdated\n# applications (and warns about possible security risk: we better trust\n# the Debian Security Team).\n#\nENABLE_TESTS=ALL\nDISABLE_TESTS=suspscan hidden_procs deleted_files packet_cap_apps apps\n\nYou could remove from DISABLE_TESTS the name of the test you want to run or replace all of them with NONE, if you really want to run all the tests. Alternatively, you could tell rkhunter to run all the tests with:\nsudo rkhunter --sk --enable all --disable none\n\n", "Q: How to install [filename].txz files I am trying to install the video editor cinelerra but the install file is (.txz).

Could anyone help me with this?\nEdit: I now have it installed, when I try to run it, it doesn't do anything. I'm going to try rebooting then I'll add another edit.\n\nA: .txz is short for .tar.xz, just as .tgz is short for .tar.gz. You can unpack it like a .tar.xz archive:\nRun tar xf *archive*.txz, since tar will automatically figure out how an archive is compressed and decompress accordingly.\nAssuming you downloaded this file (or that one), linked to from here and listed under \"Ubuntu 14,\" there are a few points to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most archives for software kindly keep everything in a top-level folder, but this one doesn't! Therefore, I suggest creating a cinelerra folder, putting the archive in the folder (or downloading it to there in the first place, if you haven't already), and unpacking it there:\nmkdir cinelerra\ncd cinelerra\nwget http://cinelerra.org/2015/downloads/cinelerra-4.6.mod-ubuntu-14.04.1-x86_64.txz\ntar xf cinelerra-4.6.mod-ubuntu-14.04.1-x86_64.txz\n\n\n*Generic instructions for installing software from compressed tar archives are often instructions for installing from source, as source code is commonly packaged this way. However, Cinelerra is distributed for Ubuntu as a precompiled binary in a compressed tar archive. Thus, as the README file says:\nRun `./cinelerra` from this directory.  That's it.\n\n\nA: A .tgz or a .tar.xz file is not an installer, but a compressed tar archive. You need to decompress and to extract the archive to access the files inside it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal by hitting Ctrl+Alt+t\n\n*Create a new folder to hold the extracted files, for example to create a folder in your Home named extracted_files run the following command: mkdir ~/extracted_files\n\n*Decompress and extract the archive by running the following command: tar xf <.tgz_.tar.xz_file_path> -C ~/extracted_files, where <.tgz_.tar.xz_file_path> is the path of the .tgz or .tar.xz file\n\n", "Q: Cannot access samba share on Android Device I'm trying to access my samba share on my android device using es file explorer, but I receive the following message - \"Login Fails: This may be caused by: - The account has no permissions.\" (I think it's logged in as a guest user as I was able to access test shares set to 777) \nI've been able to access the shares before but today it appears I've been shut out.

I have an iMac with a PowerPC chip in it. Can Ubuntu run on it? I have Mac OS X 10.4.11 running on it right now. The brand is Apple.\n\nA: You should be able to run Ubuntu on your PowerPC Mac; you just need to get the PowerPC version.\nSome third-party software is not provided for PowerPC and thus won't work, and since the PPC architecture is community-supported and has a relatively small installed user base these days, you may experience a few more bugs.

If you don't mind prompts for name and password, you skip these options.\n\n*ssh-keygen can create .ssh with the right permissions\n\n*Again, -N \"\" and -f ~ceph/.ssh/id_rsa are used to avoid prompts. You can skip these if you don't mind prompts for the key location (for which the default is fine) and if you wish to set a passphrase.\n\n*Neither .ssh nor .ssh/authorized_keys need to have 700 as the mode. As long as only the owner can write to them, it's fine (755 for .ssh and 644 for .ssh/authorized_keys is just fine).\n\n\nA: Because this is Digital Ocean, the problem can be addressed by setting userdata as part of the initial cloud instance bootup - the following will create a ceph user, put it in the sudoers group, and configure the SSH keys required to provide log in.\n#cloud-config\nusers:\n  - name: ceph\n    groups: sudo\n    shell: /bin/bash\n    sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']\n    ssh-authorized-keys:\n      - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDf0q4PyG0doiBQYV7OlOxbRjle026hJPBWD+eKHWuVXIpAiQlSElEBqQn0pOqNJZ3IBCvSLnrdZTUph4czNC4885AArS9NkyM7lK27Oo8RV888jWc8hsx4CD2uNfkuHL+NI5xPB/QT3Um2Zi7GRkIwIgNPN5uqUtXvjgA+i1CS0Ku4ld8vndXvr504jV9BMQoZrXEST3YlriOb8Wf7hYqphVMpF3b+8df96Pxsj0+iZqayS9wFcL8ITPApHi0yVwS8TjxEtI3FDpCbf7Y/DmTGOv49+AWBkFhS2ZwwGTX65L61PDlTSAzL+rPFmHaQBHnsli8U9N6E4XHDEOjbSMRX f2@digitalocean\n\nI still believe there should be a smart way to do this not involving the cloud fabric.\n\nA: I found a more generic solution by modifying the answer to this question to accomplish this while logging in as another user:\n cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@storage-1 'useradd ceph; umask 0077; mkdir -p ~ceph/.ssh; cat >> ~ceph/.ssh/authorized_keys && echo \"Key copied\"'\n\n\nA: You can use ssh-copy-id to transfer your SSH key to a remote host.\nExample:\nmallard@steamroller:~$ ssh-copy-id mallard@puter\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\nPassword: \n\nNumber of key(s) added: 1\n\nNow try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh 'mallard@puter'\"\nand check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\n\nIt automatically creates directories (such as .ssh) and sets them to the correct permissions.\n", "Q: What is Snappy Ubuntu Core? Before everyone rushes to mark this as a duplicate, I have indeed read the other threads here and here, googled this, and visited the snappy homepage here searching to clear my confusion, and I couldn't. I ask here because I still remain confused. I understand that it is some sort of a minimal working ubuntu, and the spirit of this question is not what is \"in it\", rather what it is and how it works.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the snappy approach to applications? The homepage describes some of it's merits, but as a user, how will I get the apps? Do I still sudo apt-get install XXXX? Or something else?\n\n*Will regular ubuntu applications work if I install snappy (the same thing that works on my normal ubuntu install using apt-get or by downloading a deb package), or does someone need to do something special to make an app work in snappy?\n\n*Snappy Core is available for Raspberry Pi, for instance, which is a different (mobile) processor, if I install snappy on that, will regular desktop apps still work on Pi? Is that the point of snappy?\n\n*If the standard approach does not work, how do I get applications, where do I search for what applications are available for snappy, and how do I install them. \nThank you. My questions are formulated to the best of my understanding of how applications work and are installed in Ubuntu, but please edit them to make more sensible if you get what I mean to ask.\n\nA: apt-get and other utilities for working with traditional .deb packages do not work to install and upgrade applications on a Snappy Ubuntu Core system. Instead you use the snappy utility. See the Snappy Tour for details.\nTo summarize a couple examples from the Snappy Tour, to install the Docker application you would run:\nsudo snappy install docker\n\nAnd to install updates, you run sudo snappy update-versions (which corresponds to sudo apt-get update on a normal Ubuntu system), snappy versions to see what's newly available, and sudo snappy update ... to specify packages for updating (put their names in place of ...).\nBecause Snappy Ubuntu Core doesn't use .deb packages, Ubuntu packages created for regular Ubuntu systems will not work--the relationship between regular Ubuntu systems and Snappy Ubuntu Core when it comes to package files is, in effect, the same as the relationship between any two distributions that use totally different package managers. (For example: Ubuntu and Fedora.)\nLike in just about any OS, you could manually install programs on Snappy Ubuntu Core provided you have or can obtain all the libraries (and any other dependencies) they need. However, just as the best way to install most software on regular Ubuntu systems is with a .deb package, the best way to install software on Snappy Ubuntu Core is with specially built snappy packages. Only a handful of these exist so far.\nTo search for Snappy Ubuntu Core apps from within a Snappy Ubuntu Core system, use:\nsnappy search search-term\nThis finds Snappy packages with search-term in their names. (You'd replace that with whatever you're looking for, of course.)\n\nAs for Raspberry Pi, those have ARM processors, which you're right are not the same as the usual 32-bit and 64-bit Intel and AMD processors most of us use on our traditional PCs. However, Raspberry Pi support does not appear to be the main point of Snappy Ubuntu Core. Instead, as you may be aware, the general aim of Snappy is for better speed, stability, and security, in circumstances where a minimal Ubuntu Core system is sufficient and appropriate.\nSnappy is cloud-oriented (\"Snappy Ubuntu Core is the perfect system for large-scale cloud container deployments...\"), and explicitly supports many x86 (i.e., not ARM) platforms--see the list of options under \"Try the new, snappy Ubuntu yourself!\" on the Snappy home page.\nNonetheless, depending on your needs, Snappy Ubuntu Core may be a reasonable way to get a working Ubuntu Core system on a Raspberry Pi. Depending on which Raspberry Pi board you have, it may or may not support a fuller, more traditional installation of Ubuntu. Note, though, that there are other options that may be more Ubuntu-like in the ways that matter to most users of traditional Ubuntu systems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debian is quite similar to Ubuntu, and provides an experience in many ways more similar to most Ubuntu installations. In particular, like a normal Ubuntu system Debian uses apt-get. In fact apt-get originated in Debian. (Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian.)\n\n*Raspbian is a derivative of Debian made specially for the Raspberry Pi. Like Debian and normal (non-Snappy) Ubuntu systems, uses APT-based package management (i.e., with apt-get). The Debian project's page about Debian on Raspberry Pi even says, \"Generally, your best bet is to use Raspbian\".\n\n\nSee also this list of operating systems for Raspberry Pi.\n\nA: Snappy Ubuntu Core is like a Lego system, each snap (app) is a block not affected by other snaps. So security is simpler and higher, dependencies are no longer an issue and the lifecycle of snaps are much easier. With a single command you can exchange versions, eliminate and upgrade any snapp and even the core (OS). \nThis is the default on 16.04 but Mark said that you'll use .apt and .deb also.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 on laptop : is there a way to not see my fixed ethernet adapter?

Would this work? is there an easier way that does not partition my ssd but allows for boot request on start up? I feel like if I do it my way I will always have to go into the bios to request the Ubuntu boot. also I fear Ubuntu will try to change things on my ssd or my windows configured hdd.\n\nA: Instead of swapping out your drives back and forth, you can install all three hard drives right away and then make sure to configure the correct drive/partition(s) for Ubuntu installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*If your 2nd drive is empty, note its size and then run ls /dev/sd*. This will give you a listing of available hard drives, as in sda, sdb, sdc (and possibly more).\n\n*To find out which one is your 2nd drive, do sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdX, where X is the last letter of the drive (a, b, or c). This will list the drive size and its partition table, if any. The drive size should be close to the size of your 2nd drive. If it doesn't, check another drive. If the drives are equal in size, look at the partition table (if one shows up). The Windows drive will have multiple HPFS/NTFS/exFAT entries - that's the drive you do not want to touch!\n\n*Once you found your target drive, launch Ubuntu installer and point it at that drive, i.e. /dev/sdb (or whichever one is your 2nd drive). Unless you know what you're doing, let it auto-partition the drive. It will not touch your Windows drive or the SSD. As a part of the installation, it will add the GRUB bootloader which will auto-detect Windows and will let you choose the OS to boot when the computer starts.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to traverse all packages using python-apt i want to implement a python code which prints all packages using python-apt in ubuntu. I searched about it, looked at python apt documentation in the link, https://apt.alioth.debian.org/python-apt-doc/\nHowever i couldn't find what i want. Do you know how to traverse all packages? If you ask me why i want to do it, it is because that i want to traverse all packages. I can reach the section of a package. If i can traverse all packages, i will group packages by looking the section of packages. As you know, there are more than fifty section for packages as indicated in the link, https://packages.debian.org/stable/\nI will look at each package's section, then i put that package into some list . For example if the section of a package is Games, i will put that package into list Games, etc.\nHow can i traverse and print all packages? \nThanks in advance\n\nA: You need to use apt.cache and apt.package. Adapting the example given for apt.package:\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\n\nimport apt\ncache = apt.Cache()\nGames = [pkg for pkg in cache if pkg.section.endswith(\"/games\")]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(map(lambda x: x.name, Games[1:10])))\n\ncache is like a dictionary object, with package names (+ an optional architecture label) as the keys. You get use the cache.keys() method to obtain all the keys.\nSome example output:\nfunnyboat\nberusky2\ntorcs:i386\nglaurung:i386\njigzo-data\nbalazar3-common\nval-and-rick\nopenyahtzee:i386\nmupen64plus-ui-console\n\n", "Q: messed up my boot/efi, couldn't boot into anything, now boot repair is not working either i \"accidentally\" messed up the boot/efi folder when i was trying to replace it with one i had copied earlier(stupid I know)\nWhen i rebooted the computer i could not boot into ubuntu 14.04 nor windows 7, asking me to insert boot media.\nSo now i'm trying to use boot repair, but it gives me this: \"The boot of your pc is in legacy mode.

I'm having trouble understanding my current GParted report. \n\nI started out with two partitions so I could dual-boot Ubuntu with Windows 8.  Later, I tried to adjust the settings of my computer so I could more easily access Ubuntu, and it messed up the boot so that I lost Ubuntu completely.  I used rEFInd to enable booting to Ubuntu once again, and now my GParted looks like this.  There seem to be three large partitions on my hard drive now, along with multiple smaller partitions.  Several of the smaller partitions are labeled \"unknown,\" and it's possible that the larger of the unintentional partitions contains my old version of Ubuntu.\nCan someone please help me interpret my GParted screenshot?\nThanks!\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure of what all of your partitions do, but I can identify most of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 -- This is your EFI System Partition (ESP), which is required to boot an EFI-based computer.\n\n*/dev/sda2 -- Based on the filesystem (NTFS), label (Recovery), and size (900MiB), I'd say this is part of your OEM Windows installation. It's probably a stripped-down Windows installation used for emergency recovery, but I'm not positive of that.\n\n*/dev/sda3 -- This is the Microsoft Reserved partition, which exists mainly to have some \"scratch space\" for use by Microsoft partitioning tools.\n\n*/dev/sda4 -- Based on the filesystem (NTFS), label (OS), and size (223GiB), this looks like your main Windows partition.\n\n*/dev/sda5 -- I don't know what this partition holds. You might want to try mounting it and examining its files for clues.\n\n*/dev/sda6 -- Given its name (New Volume) and the fact that it's almost empty, this looks like something you created yourself, but I can't be sure of that.\n\n*/dev/sda7 -- This is a BIOS Boot Partition. It's used in BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boots via GRUB. Since your computer boots Windows in EFI mode, it shouldn't be necessary, although if you installed Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, you might be using it. You mentioned rEFInd, though, and if you're booting Linux via rEFInd, you almost certainly don't need this partition. If you can positively identify your Linux boot mode as EFI/UEFI, you can safely delete this partition. OTOH, it's only 1MiB in size, so there's really very little advantage to be had from deleting it.\n\n*/dev/sda8 -- This is your main (root, /) Ubuntu partition. It's got the wrong type code, though (an \"msftdata flag,\" in GParted terminology). I recommend removing that \"flag,\" since it will cause the partition to show up as an empty disk in some Windows tools, which will then give you the option to format the partition. If you mistakenly accept, you'll end up trashing your Ubuntu installation. See here for more on this subject.\n\n*/dev/sda9 -- This is your Linux swap space.\n\n*/dev/sda10 -- Based on the filesystem (NTFS), label (Restore), and size (20GiB), this partition probably holds restore images for Windows -- that is, it's either a backup location or is used instead of an external restore disc (probably the latter).\n\n\nIn any event, partitions 1-4, 10, and possibly 5 and/or 6 are all part of your original from-factory state. (Partition 10 probably had a lower number originally, though; it was probably renumbered when you resized your partitions to make room for Ubuntu.)

I am trying to do this with find, because I will have many directories with same filename, and I want to change all the test-a to test-10 in one command. Anyone please suggest.\nThanks.\n\nA: The syntax of mv is mv <source> <target>, so the final command that find executes should look like:\nmv test-a test-10 \n\nSo, the first guess would be try:\nfind ~ -type f -name test-a -exec mv {} test-10 \\;\n\nHowever, this will fail, since {} gets expanded to the full path and mv is still run in the current directory, resulting in all the files being moved to your current directory and getting overwritten. To avoid this, you can use -execdir so that mv gets executed in the directory where the file was found:\nfind ~ -type f -name test-a -execdir mv {} test-10 \\;\n\nOr, since the filename is always the same:\nfind ~ -type f -name test-a -execdir mv test-a test-10 \\;\n\n", "Q: Deleting user from sudoers Hi I executed this command sudo adduser username sudo and am wondering how do I take that username out from being able to execute sudo.
